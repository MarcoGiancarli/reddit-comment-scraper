StarWarsEU,3dogo3,Kacen,8,Fri Jul 17 23:03:01 2015 UTC,"Honestly, it is people who haven't read the books but want to act like they know everything about star wars, and if they haven't read the EU they pretend that it isn't ""legitimate"" canon so that they keep up their facade of expertise."
StarWarsEU,3dogo3,jackgibson12,20,Sat Jul 18 10:55:59 2015 UTC,"I love the EU, for the most part. I don't think its fair to group the entire EU by saying ""the EU was crap"", rather I'd say certain portions of it were not very good, either due to subpar writers, lackluster and contrived stories, repetition of previously covered ideas , or any combination of these factors. Personally I think the EU took a decline in quality after the conclusion of the NJO series (which I enjoyed) . Everything that came after just seemed like they were running out of ideas of where to take the characters next,       Need a new big bad? Lets have one of the main characters turn to the Dark Side ! (In a poorly written imitation of Vaders fall) and then have the alliance mirror the Empire in a 2nd civil war. Ok, thats been dealt with, what next? Let's release some uber-powerful ancient entity on the galaxy and have the Jedi be villainized again! oh and lets install an Imperial war criminal as the leader of the galactic government to justify it!       Another thing I believe led to the decline in quality was the sudden need to have every series be told in cycles of 10+ books written by multiple authors. This led to varying characterization of the main characters within a single book series, as well as plot points being ignored or added based on the author's personal preference, (such as the mandalorian subplots in LotF) and an overall feeling of disjointedness from book to book. There's also the fact that these books were on a deadline so the authors had to write them to meet the release date which I believe caused the post NJO era to suffer in quality.       As far as pre-NJO there was the ongoing conflict with the Empire that began to run stale after a while. Series such as the Thrawn trilogy are considered excellent because they took the story in the next logical direction, were well written and had interesting stories, as well as giving us awesome new characters. After that it just became the same characters fighting against the most recent Imperial leader or super weapon, weapons which seemed to get increasingly large or powerful as the books went on; it was like the writers were trying to oneup each other in terms of who could create the most dangerous weapon."
StarWarsEU,3dogo3,Luna2112,7,Fri Jul 17 23:40:22 2015 UTC,"I agree with a lot of what you said, except about post NJO. Now I wasn't a huge fan of Jacen's fall, but I thoroughly enjoyed the way they were going in the FOTJ series.  My biggest disappointment with the loss of the old EU was the lack of finish to where they were taking the character of Ben Skywalker."
StarWarsEU,3dogo3,tyereliusprime,4,Sat Jul 18 02:55:36 2015 UTC,"Yeah... the whole decanonisation never really bothered me. I get why Disney wanted to start from scratch.   What upset me was knowing that I'll never get to see Ben or Allanah grow up, or Jaina and Jag's destiny.  I really hate that it all just... stopped."
StarWarsEU,3dogo3,tunnel-snakes-rule,3,Sat Jul 18 12:37:23 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I wish we had resolution for those arcs. I really wanted to see more of Jaina."

StarWarsEU,3dogo3,solusvod,4,Sun Jul 19 10:42:53 2015 UTC,"Honestly, your complaints about the EU could also be applied to superhero comics. They are out of interesting stories and characters but are compelled to continually churn them out. Comics aren't made when a good writer and story is lined up, they're just made constantly and sometimes you might get an okay tale."
StarWarsEU,3dogo3,Khanstant,5,Sat Jul 18 03:17:28 2015 UTC,"That's true, though Marvel and DC have an option the EU never did, which is to continually reboot your universe, allowing a fresh start.  Your mileage may vary on how successful that is.  I'm glad it never happened with the EU, well until now I guess.  I loved that we got to see Luke, Han and Leia get old, have kids, something that rarely happens in comics."
StarWarsEU,3dogo3,tunnel-snakes-rule,2,Sat Jul 18 12:35:02 2015 UTC,"Yes, I wish comics could do the same. Many of these heroes would literally be very old people by now, if not, sick or I'll from their dangerous lives. Batman Beyond was the closest thing to it, but they cancelled that."

StarWarsEU,3dogo3,Khanstant,3,Sun Jul 19 04:17:49 2015 UTC,"I agree that the shift to multi-book series with multiple authors was a problem. That's really what killed my enjoyment, because major tonal shifts would happen between installments and characters felt like they were inconsistent. I liked stories wrapped up in 1-3 books all by the same author, that felt more like standalones and that didn't require committing to reading 9 or 18 books to know what was going on."
StarWarsEU,3dogo3,flameofmiztli,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:17:06 2015 UTC,"(such as the mandalorian subplots in LotF)   Subplots that were NEVER concluded or expanded on and really seemed to make no sense. I love the Mandalorians and that whole mando shtick they had going on made no sense coming out of Traviss' characterisation of Boba in the previous series, always bugged me."
StarWarsEU,3dogo3,solusvod,5,Sun Jul 19 10:40:15 2015 UTC,"I don't think there is any one reason for a lot of the EU hate that you see on the internet these days. The Star Wars fan base is so nuanced that there are a lot of people all saying different things and it often all becomes mixed up into a lot of negativity that is greater than the sum of its parts. I'm a big fan of the 'Legends' universe, from dawn of the Jedi through Fate of the Jedi, I accept everything for what is it, and generally have a lot more positive things to say than negative.  But most people will understandably not have read any of the EU books, and there is already a common consensus (circlejerk) in place that says that the OT is the best thing ever made, and that the prequel trilogy is the worst.  In a lot of ways, I think people who already have that mindset see their hate of the EU as an extension of their prequel hate; it's not the OT so it must just be poorly made and thrown out to make easy money from fanboys.  What obviously doesn't help is that as you said yourself the novels (while generally good in my opinion), aren't an endless stream of perfect writing or good ideas, so people who already have it in their mind that the EU is bad tend to pick up on some of the worse parts and use this as arguments against the EU as a whole.  On the other side is the fact that even within people who have read any number of Star Wars books, there are people who have really come to dislike especially the later content.  NJO, LOTF and FOTJ all have fairly large camps of detractors who for a whole host of reasons tend to think that the post-ROTJ EU had been ruined and so tend to support the DisnEU to express their criticism of where the Legend timeline went.  I think that there still are a lot of people who love the Legends timeline and want to see more of it (which I am still hopeful for).  But I think that people feel a need to be especially critical of the old EU to help justify the DisnEU.  And because there are all these voices saying a whole range of negative things, the actually criticisms become magnified out of proportion."
StarWarsEU,3dogo3,zaxa13,18,Sat Jul 18 09:22:51 2015 UTC,"I've come to find that rather often in many affairs, the majority is wrong. This is unfortunately a demonstration of that.  Disney offered excuses for wiping the EU which hold absolutely no logical weight (""it wasn't consistent"" - absolutely false, as Leland Chee fixed this rather quickly and authors like Zahn did some great handwaving; ""new fans won't know the whole story"" - plenty of other successful franchises had the same situation without requiring a wipe...oh, and now Disney has announced no less than 20 books in the next year, what happens then, another wipe?).  The EU revived a dead franchise. Lucas was so pleased he encouraged more EU materials and used their success as a litmus test for his PT. He incorporated many EU elements into his PT and even into the re-releases of the OT. He and LucasFilm were very, very involved in the development of EU stories and campaigns (like Shadows of the Empire and the NJO). The EU was always official, real, and canon.  Need I remind people that the official website for SW had a poll to provide the Sith name for Jacen Solo? Darth Caedus was obviously the winner. The EU wasn't some fanfiction or ""unimportant addition"" to SW - it was absolutely 100% legitimate.  And yes, I'm with you - the majority of the EU is amazing. Downright fucking awesome. Only a small minority of it sucks, so there's definitely a lot of strawmanning going on.  So OP, to answer your question - people are assholes. They're apologists and they will latch onto shitty arguments/excuses when it benefits their ignorant/personal stances (meaning, whether they hated the EU because of an incorrect perception that it all ""sucked"" or whether they genuinely hated it all, they're happy to tag-along with any excuse to discredit it).  Also, people are just easily duped/convinced without giving things much thought. A lot of people were happy to have more SW movies, and after the PT, movies not made by Lucas, so pretty much anything that Disney did/will do will be forgiven/apologized. This is brainless, of course - I never wanted more movies, as IMO books are a far superior form of story delivery, and more is not necessarily better.  But alas, this kind of apologist behavior is not unexpected from casual fans. Whether they're just lazy or disrespectful out of malice/ignorance is irrelevant - there is an unfortunate ignoring of hardcore fans in every franchise. I find this unjust, because it's the hardcore fans who often keep franchises afloat, who publicize them, invest in them, and care about them most. Unfortunately, what's being appealed to here is nothing more than the most lucrative business interests.  Rest assured, there are legions of EU fans who don't hate it. The Thrawn Trilogy sold 15 million copies in short time and the first book of the series stayed on the NYTimes Bestseller list for 19 months. TV commercials, toys, video games, mods for non-SW video games, cosplaying, and fanfiction have all incorporated the EU to a radical degree. You aren't alone at all."
StarWarsEU,3dogo3,PR-0927,-4,Sat Jul 18 00:28:26 2015 UTC,"""it wasn't consistent""    Yeah I forgot to say this in the OP. That's a stupid reason to de-canonize it because there's as much, if not MORE, inconsistencies between the prequels and the original movies that the EU struggled to explain, and they're even less excusable than the EU inconsistencies for obvious reasons. Not just inconsistencies that are flat out contradictory, but things that retcon assumptions and implications in the original films that were simply better prior.   For example the whole scene in Attack of the Clones where Obi-Wan asks the ""younglings""(ugh) why Kamino isn't on the star charts, they have them wearing helmets that cover their eyes whilst using their lightsabers to deflect laser blasts from remotes that are THE SAME DESIGN that Han Solo had on the Millenium Falcon. It was always implied that was some makeshift training Obi-Wan thought up using random stuff laying around the Falcon. That's so much more interesting than it being Offical Jedi Training Gear™, and we're also forced to explain why the hell Han Solo, a guy who never believed in the force, had an OFFICIAL JEDI TRAINING REMOTE™ laying around. Okay fine he could have just found it once and not known what it was, but still that's far more contrived and was never what was implied. George Lucas understood Star Wars less than the bulk of classic EU authors.  Little things like them making Obi-Wan's robes Official Jedi Robes, what? He clearly wore them because he was a hermit and just mysterious, why would he wear Official Jedi Robes™ when he's hiding from the Empire who hunts Jedis? The EU did better with the New Jedi Order itself. It was more logical. The Jedi were never my favorite part of Star Wars but the old EU made them far better and likeable from even my perspective than the Prequels did.   The EU revived a dead franchise. Lucas was so pleased he encouraged more EU materials and used their success as a litmus test for his PT. He incorporated many EU elements into his PT and even into the re-releases of the OT. He and LucasFilm were very, very involved in the development of EU stories and campaigns (like Shadows of the Empire and the NJO). The EU was always official, real, and canon.   Yes exactly! George Lucas treated it as canon in the 90's because he used it to make people interested in SW again. He even went out of his way to give guidelines and acted like he gave a fuck.  ""In a 2008 interview in Total Film, Lucas ruled out anybody else making Star Wars films. Asked if he was happy for new Star Wars films to be made after his death, he said: ""I've left pretty explicit instructions for there not to be any more features. There will definitely be no Episodes VII–IX. That's because there isn't any story. I mean, I never thought of anything. And now there have been novels about the events after Episode VI, which isn't at all what I would have done with it. The Star Wars story is really the tragedy of Darth Vader. That is the story. Once Vader dies, he doesn't come back to life, the Emperor doesn't get cloned and Luke doesn't get married...""[25]""  This statement is usually used by people who dislike the EU to claim it was never canon. What they fail to realize is that, put in context, with all knowledge of what went into the old EU and Lucas' involvement in it, you'd realize he should be criticized for this opinion and not being faithful to the old EU in the same vein as he should and is criticized for altering his original films. There's no consistent reason to criticize him for one and not the other, it's just people are ignorant and prejudiced towards the EU and want to dismiss it somehow. It's like he backpedaled and flip-flopped.   I'd even go as far as to say he should have flat out made the Clone Wars what Timothy Zahn said they were. If he didn't want to cater to the EU then he shouldn't have legitimized it in the first place. The end, tough shit faggot. Imagine if the Thrawn Trilogy was a series of films in the early 90's but every other factor was the same or as similar as it could be, primarily George Lucas never writing them and having minimal involvement. Would anyone argue it wasn't canon? No! Would anyone let George get away with contradicting certain things in the prequels? No! Why does the medium determine what is canon and what is not canon? It's fucking ridiculous and arbitrary.  Let's be frank and admit the guy is uniquely mental and insular. He probably has aspergers or something and had very little to do with what made the original movies good. He doesn't have very good taste and the best stuff in Star Wars was mostly not his doing, this includes the original films. Hell, the primary thing that ruined Return of the Jedi, before the completely abominable Jedi Rocks addition, was the Ewoks which HE insisted on adding. They completely detract from the final part of the film and are the only major flaw in the original movies."

StarWarsEU,3dogo3,tunnel-snakes-rule,3,Sun Jul 19 01:22:13 2015 UTC,"I think it's partly because fans of the films see the EU as nothing more than fan fiction.   Also, it kind of reminds me of being a kid where it was cool to like Star Wars but if you mention that you're also a Star Trek fan you're treated with such disdain that you're embarrassing the Star Wars fans by mentioning it in the same sentence.  I think it's the same with the books to a certain extent. It can be seen as embarrassing when you associate book-loving nerds with Star Wars. Because it's cool to be a Star Wars fan.  Not so cool to read.  I guess I can almost understand it for the more ignorant haters too.  From an objective point of view it does sound silly to write books about such a loud, bright popcorn series of films. The original stories weren't particularly innovative, basically just a science fiction twist on fairy tales.  So without having read any of the novels I can understand why people would scoff.  I noticed you had a go at The Clone Wars and someone else addressed this below, but I just want to add my thoughts.  I was pretty hesitant to watch it myself but another redditor suggested I check out certain story arcs starting in the third season.  ""Overlords"", ""Altar of Mortis"" and ""Ghosts of Mortis"" was a good introduction to the series.  Yeah, it's still very kiddy at times, but I actually ended up enjoying most episodes of the rest of the series."
StarWarsEU,3dogo3,VegasSaint9,2,Sun Jul 19 02:24:33 2015 UTC,"I really don't know why it has such a negative stigma attached to it, especially amongst people who never even tried to get into it. I'll admit I didn't read a lot of it since I didn't have the money to buy all those books and I was somewhat younger, and most was created as I was growing up, thus not really having a lot of knowledge about it. I had no clue where to start, so in a way I'm happy for the wipe, although I do like what I have read and am disappointed that it no longer exists like Revan, Bane, and the Plagueis book. I like that I can keep up and choose what i want to read as it comes along and not have 10 books to read to understand what happens in certain eras. I like that they'll have more of a streamlined continuity with probably less contradictions.   I even like the prequels as thats what I grew up with. A lot of people grew up with the OT, so they have nostalgia glasses on as well and act like anything that isn't that is garbage. Like Luke kissing Leia isn't as cringe worthy as Anakin's dialogue? Really? Ewoks are just barely more tolerable than Jar Jar in terms of the plot. There are issues in all of Star Wars and I love the Star Wars universe for what it is. Yeah could certain things have been better? I don't know I take the good with the bad and tend to get over things I don't like. I'm just happy to have more Star Wars movies and content. The ST looks like its going to be really awesome just based on the teasers. I'm sure those movies will have some flaws as well, but I'll accept them.   And about the 2008-14 Clone Wars, I was kinda pissed about it as well at first, but then I watched it and realized it wasn't half bad. I liked the 2003 Clone Wars because it matches up with the movies a little better, but the newer CGI one isn't terrible. I'm surprised they didn't retcon that as well since it just sort of...ends I guess. I think Rebels is more childish than Clone Wars in some instances, I feel like I'm the only one who can't stand Ezra as a character, Kanan's okay, but he's kinda stale. I'm more interested in his comic. The rest of the characters are just kind of lame. Rebels pales in comparison to Clone Wars if you ask me. The only thing I like is seeing more of the Empire in that era and thats all that saves that series for me. Just seeing more Vader, Tarkin, Emperor, and now whatever extras they want to add."

Now me I've watched clone wars, not religiously but on occasion. It has its good moments but is mostly mediocre and honestly bothers me greatly from a lore perspective. For every nice little prequel detail it gave there was something just stupid right behind it. The clone troopers stuff was great and lore building, the ""force gods"" was straight up mental and just chucks every common understanding of the force out the window. Not to mention the clashing lore between it and Episode 3.  Honestly, I despise Ashoka. It's not even her character which does improve over time, it's her very being. A stupid ""secret""  apprentice for Anakin which he gets just because the Jedi apparently love breaking g their own rules with bad decisions all day.

I'm treating the Disneyverse as an alternate universe to the EU. For the most part the EU remains as my headcanon. If something happens in the AU that I like better or doesn't contradict anything (such as Rebels) then I'll add it to my headcanon.Conversely, there are things in the EU that I don't consider canon, such as TORs Revan and most of the post NJO material. In general though, I'm going to treat the EU and AU as two separate continuities."

StarWarsEU,3disr5,RannGast,2,Thu Jul 16 19:16:16 2015 UTC,"Did you have any issues reading the 5 canon books that have been released so far? What is interesting to me, is a lot of people are not liking the style this was written, or have other issues, with the canon stories (outside of being a departure to the Expanded Universe). I am trying to understand how or why the writing style takes the reader out of the experience, since I haven't had issues so far. Possibly, I have not read enough books prior, or I have adapted to the growing increase of present tense writing. I did not know people had issues, with that writing style until the excerpt came out, and commenters pointed it out to me."
StarWarsEU,3disr5,Sapitoelgato,9,Thu Jul 16 19:38:41 2015 UTC,"I'm reading Tarkin right now, and I've got the others en route as we speak. Honestly, most English language novels are told in third person, past tense. The last time I read a book in present tense was one of those ""choose your own adventure"" books, I think. Even first person, past tense would be fine; there are a lot of great books written like that. Take Catcher in the Rye. That's first-past.  Third-present almost reads like something out of a DND campaign (""Jiminey swings his sword at the cricket"") or something out of a fan fiction to me. It just rubs me wrong in a novel setting. It's almost dissonant in my mind.  That being said, I'll definitely read this as soon as it comes out. It just won't be as enjoyable for me as some other books I've read. There are some other grammatical and stylistic errors in the prose, but I'm confident that those will be corrected before the launch, and I'm not as concerned as some of the other commenters I've seen.  I think, though, that since this book is really launching the new canon more than the other books that have come out, the bar is set pretty high, there is more to lose by this book not being up to snuff. I grew up reading all the Star Wars novels, but if this is indicative of how the new canon will be handled, with odd writing styles and the like, I may find myself just reading wiki summaries of most the books."

StarWarsEU,3disr5,Sapitoelgato,6,Fri Jul 17 00:37:20 2015 UTC,"I struggle with some of the Star Wars EU and the writing. Sometimes, they try to be too monumental in their writing and try to write it as an epic. With short sentences. Trying to be forceful. Too much. So much. All the much.   And then: The whooping of klaxons. Red lights strobe. Three airspeeders swoop down from the traffic lanes above—Imperial police. Red-and- black helmets.   This excerpt seems to follow the trend. I know they are trying to write an action sequence, but I find it disrupts the flow and just seems hokey.   Don't get me wrong. I am not author, and hardly a great writer (not a writer at all, I have no delusions), but I am a fan of reading and the written word. Objectively, I am disappointed by the writing style. This might be a series that I Wookiepedia, rather than actually read if the rest are written like this.   I love the stories of many Star Wars books, and what they contribute to the universe. But, sometimes they are just so bad.    He holds his son close.  Then he puts a hunk of statue in the boy’s hand.  And he picks one up himself.   What-even-is-this?

At the time I had only seen the movies as a kid and liked them but not all that taken with the franchise. I asked him what books he recommended, and he said the Thrawn trilogy and the NJO. So I gave them a read and fell in love with the EU and Star Wars as a whole. Since then we've been keeping in touch over facebook and chatting about all the new Star Wars stuff coming out.

StarWarsEU,3dcm0s,wardmart,4,Wed Jul 15 05:37:30 2015 UTC,"There really isn't that much material regarding Soontir Fel (Baron is a title).  He is mentioned countless times in the New Jedi Order books, as well as the Legacy of the Force books, but I cannot think of many appearances from him.    From Soontir Fel's wookieepedia page:   The character of Soontir Fel was created by Michael Stackpole for the Star Wars: X-Wing Rogue Squadron comic series. Editor Peet Janes asked Stackpole to come up with an ""Imperial Red Baron"" to complement the New Republic aces of Rogue Squadron, a concept Stackpole thought was in line with fan desire to see an Imperial fighter pilot perspective. Timothy Bradstreet illustrated Fel for the trade paperback covers of In the Empire's Service and Blood and Honor using his brother, Bob Bradstreet, as reference. Bradstreet and Janes wanted Fel to have a similar look to the renowned World War I fighter pilot Manfred von Richthofen, known as the Red Baron, appearing to be a ""master of the skies.""   Also info on what works he actually appears in (not just mentioned):   Stackpole intended to explore Fel's story further in the X-wing comics before they were canceled, telling the story of his return to Imperial service. He has indicated that he had the story ready to tell when the series was canceled. Stackpole has also stated that he and Zahn had additionally worked on story ideas featuring Thrawn and Fel.[48] Presumably, Stackpole referred to The Reenlistment of Baron Fel, which he created with Zahn as a six-part comic. When the X-wing series was canceled, the storyline was reworked as a four-part short story, a format in which Stackpole and Zahn had collaborated before. While both versions remain extant, in Stackpole's and Zahn's possession, neither has been sold and the story so far has not seen public light.  A Fel impostor appeared in the later X-Wing novels, and the backstory of his disappearance from the New Republic was given.  Fel did not appear again until the Hand of Thrawn Duology, in which Fel reappeared in the Empire of the Hand and a sleeper cell of his clones aided the New Republic. Fel's only other novel appearances were in The New Jedi Order: Dark Journey and The New Jedi Order: Force Heretic II: Refugee, though he received frequent mention throughout the New Jedi Order series and subsequent Dark Nest Trilogy and Legacy of the Force series due to the prominent role of his son Jagged in those series. Despite his relative scarcity of appearances, Fel has a significant fanbase. Fel's popularity is enough that he received his own action figure, a relatively rare achievement for an Expanded Universe character, in the X-Wing: Rogue Squadron Comic Pack.  In August 2011, Fel was added as a character in the online game Star Wars Galaxies, as part of the game's ""Ace Pilot System."" Fel featured as one of a number of Imperial ace pilots that could randomly spawn if a Rebel-Alliance-aligned player character approached certain space stations and performed particular Duty Missions. If Fel spawned, he attacked the player while flying TIE Interceptor and if he was defeated, the player received an award and Fel immediately departed from the system and entered hyperspace. Fel and other elite Imperial pilots could also be found flying in various space battles that took place in the Corellian, Naboo and Tatoo systems.  The loss of Fel's eye was first established in Vision of the Future, and the text of Refugee establishes that Fel still wore his eye-patch at that time. The canonical Japanese cover art of Refugee, however, shows Fel with both eyes. No official explanation for the discrepancy has been provided, though this article accepts that the art is a canonical depiction of Fel at some time around the events of Refugee.  Fel's transition to the Chiss Ascendancy has never been fully described beyond Chaf'orm'bintrano's very vague mentions in The Joiner King, but seems to stem from authors Elaine Cunningham's and Sean Williams and Shane Dix's conflation of the Empire of the Hand with the Chiss Ascendancy; Formbi's discussion in The Joiner King effectively represented a retcon of the conflicting material.   Most of Soontir Fel's infomation comes from the X-Wing comics it seems.    Hey also, don't forget to read the last two X-Wing novels, Starfighters of Adumar and then Mercy Kill.

Plus, they introduced a great character Merei Spanjaf that is way more interesting than Zare Leonis."
StarWarsEU,3d99hd,Sapitoelgato,2,Wed Jul 15 02:13:13 2015 UTC,"I am really enjoying Rebels, so i'll give it a go. Is it set in the same time period (pre ANH)?"
StarWarsEU,3d99hd,OSUTechie,2,Wed Jul 15 03:27:02 2015 UTC,"Book one is set a year before Spark of Rebellion. The story sets up Zare's character, and what lead him to dislike the Empire. There is a minor school sport that connects him to other important characters in the book, but the author doesn't drag on that part as other important things are happening in the story.  Book two is set around the episode Breaking Ranks. Part 1&2 is the lead into the episode, and then part 3 and the Epilogue overlap from his perspective. I suggest reading those parts after researching the episodes.  Book 3 covers his life after the second book, and questions his loyalty and justice. Not everything believes his story, with traitors, and things tense up. You can watch the show up to Vision of Hope. The story mentions a few events from episodes to show it takes place over a period of time. At the tail end does it get to the cameo from Vision of Hope."
StarWarsEU,3d99hd,Sapitoelgato,4,Wed Jul 15 03:36:17 2015 UTC,"I'm about where you are (I think). So far I am enjoying it as well. But I am still having issues with Vos being portrayed the way he is. Same issues when he appeared in the clone wars. I'm use to a more dark and conflicted Vos and not this ""surfer dude"" they used in TCW.   I was also hoping (which they still might) make references to Vos and Aayla Secura romantic relationship. It is obvious Vos is going to ""fall"" for Ventress, so it would be a good parallel/throwback. But alas I have a feeling that part of Vos's history is lost to the Legends."
StarWarsEU,3d99hd,OSUTechie,2,Tue Jul 14 15:12:36 2015 UTC,"The only Legends material brought in was from the unaired scripts. Golden only went by canon sources, when writing the novel."

StarWarsEU,3d99hd,Sapitoelgato,3,Tue Jul 14 17:32:55 2015 UTC,"Not entirely true. Interceptor-class frigates were brought in from Legends and are operated by  just as in EU. They also ported in details from Ventress' backstory on Rattatak and how she met Dooku, as well as"

StarWarsEU,3d99hd,OSUTechie,2,Wed Jul 15 02:12:40 2015 UTC,"Mainly the Star Wars Republic comics which start shortly before Ep.1 and goes all the way through till order 66, at which point it switches to the Dark Times title. Vos had a series of story arcs (enough for his own onimbus) during that time period.  Vos had always towed the line between dark and light which made him work well in the underground, but also caused issues. At one point, I belive his former Master was sent to arrest Vos on the council order because they feared he went over to the Dark Side and joined forces with Dooku.  If you get a chance, you should read the Vos onimbus. It's pretty good."
StarWarsEU,3d99hd,OSUTechie,2,Wed Jul 15 04:00:50 2015 UTC,It's really good. Honestly one of the best comic series I have read and IMHO puts the TCW TV series to shame

Just cause I want to enjoy all the new content as much as I can, and I feel like if i'm constantly going ""that was different in the EU!"" i just wont enjoy it too much"
StarWarsEU,3d99hd,feebos,2,Wed Jul 15 04:14:18 2015 UTC,"I don't think it will fit at all. Vos's personality is what made his so conflicted and what pushed his story line. On top of that, not having g finished the book yet, I would think Dooku would know about Vos if the events in the comics ""took placed"". As Vos got very close to Dooku.   Reading the comics now would just be a ""What if"" story."

In certain ways, i did feel like a five part series of TCW, not that that's a bad thing. No spoilers (only because I don't know how to do the spoiler text), but I thought some of character development was a bit contrived. Still, its a good adventure read. I'd give it a solid B."
StarWarsEU,3d99hd,Skyskinner,2,Wed Jul 15 00:08:27 2015 UTC,"I for the most part really enjoyed it, but I felt like the romance was kind of forced. Which is weird because I thought I could easily picture Vos and Ventress having a relationship before. I'm not sure, I think it was because Vos's POV seemed lacking. The romance just read like it was definitely for a cartoon and didn't have the insight I expect from reading POV. Overall it was a really entertaining read, but I think I would have rather seen the story animated. Also, I don't want to spoil anything, but I was kind of confused by their assassination plan."

StarWarsEU,3d6a0k,llkd97,7,Mon Jul 13 21:20:19 2015 UTC,Luke is so far beyond Zannah in knowledge and mastery of the force it's ludicrous.
StarWarsEU,3d6a0k,bonerpotpie,7,Mon Jul 13 21:57:02 2015 UTC,"I have to disagree. Strongly. Your argument is based on the the assumption that Luke has no defense for the force tendrils. Since he hasn't faced them specifically we don't know and can't assume; however we do see Luke battle a wide range of force-wielding foes throughout his life, many bringing new or unique techniques to the fight. Luke prevails in all of these matches. Luke not only proves that he is one of the strongest force users ever, but also incredibly adaptable and intelligent.   Edit: I should have started with, ""this is a really cool idea, and you put a lot of effort into it. Thanks for adding new a great post to the community, and something for us to discuss."" Sorry I'm an ass."
StarWarsEU,3d6a0k,JohnnyBach,7,Tue Jul 14 00:12:55 2015 UTC,"Luke never got very far with Force lightning? He uses a rare form of green Force Lightning that kills a target instantly.

Well, he probably got on the comm as soon as he left in the shuttle to tell them he was friendly since it was an imperial ship. It's also unclear if anyone in the fleet knew he was on the Death Star at all, since he was supposed to be with the strike team. Leia would have felt if he died so she probably wasn't worried.

StarWarsEU,3d20p7,roninjedi,10,Sun Jul 12 21:54:29 2015 UTC,"Honestly, Grand Master Luke was what I was expecting to see. All this talk of ""Hermit Luke"" has me kinda worried, honestly. But maybe I'm too attached to the old EU."
StarWarsEU,3d20p7,i_do_stuff,13,Mon Jul 13 01:34:10 2015 UTC,"The thing that really bothers me about hermit Luke is that it really cheapens the events of the original trilogy. If, after all that, beating the emperor, destroying the Sith, etc, Luke wasn't even able to manage to put together a Jedi order, he's in hiding, and the rebel alliance is still fighting a guerrilla war (and I'll grant that these are just assumptions based off the trailer), but if that turns out to be the case, then what did they really accomplish in the OT? They're in a similar or possibly worse position now than they were then, so there's been stagnation for 20 years? Suddenly the victory at Endor becomes entirely hollow. I think they earned their happy ending, not a lifetime on the run. To be fair this is something that's kind of bothered me in the old EU since NJO, but at least in the old EU they had a legitimate government and a rebuilt Jedi order. That was progress. Now it looks like they're going to have nothing."
StarWarsEU,3d20p7,fearsomeduckins,5,Mon Jul 13 02:50:51 2015 UTC,"I am inclined to believe the rumors that he actually attempted to build a new Jedi Order, but the Imperials slaughtered the students when they caught wind of it. I can see something like that definitely shaking Luke up quite a bit - his family gets killed by the Imps, his dad dies before his eyes after saving him, and then later when everything is looking up for him the Imps come back and fry his platoon of nascent Jedi. Gotta be kind of jarring. Perhaps all the death in the galaxy is also getting to him, making it hard for him to center himself, so he dicks off to a planet no one goes to where he can wait for the Force users to come to him.  I'm pretty sure that Luke probably tried to rebuild the Order as soon as he could, though it's a big galaxy and finding Force Sensitives likely wouldn't be easy (especially after all that repressing of anything having to do with midichlorians). Any leftover inquisitors were also likely hunting down the Jedi though we don't really know how many Sith flunkies Vader and Sidious had or whether any survived. I can imagine that Luke would have no other choice really; attempt to train people and risk getting gunned down, or hide and wait for them to come to you."
StarWarsEU,3d20p7,DinoDude23,3,Mon Jul 13 03:32:15 2015 UTC,"That wouldnt make sense. If the imps are still that strong, why would Luke set up his new Jedi Order anywhere besides on a Mon Cal Cruiser jumping around. He was able to do it the EU when the Imps were still pretty strong, dont know why not in the mainstream universe."
StarWarsEU,3d20p7,Canesjags4life,3,Mon Jul 13 05:03:17 2015 UTC,"Well remember Luke had to sort of ""get away from it all"" in order to complete his Jedi training (which he didn't since he ran off to go to Bespin, and only completed it after defeating Vader). I imagine that Jedi training requires a certain environment - you have to teach them how to center themselves and use the force without calling upon the dark side, while simultaneously building up their patience, mental fortitude, and physical ability. That might be a lot harder to do on a warship, where you are constantly a target and people are dying around you left and right. That's why they had enclaves on Dantooine, Kamparas, and Almas, as well as the Jedi Temple. A more experienced Jedi like Obi-Wan, Qui-Gon, or Yoda may be able to manage it, though I think even then that's not what they would have preferred.   And recall that in the old EU, the Empire gets it's ass handed to it at Endor and promptly disintegrates. There are powerful warlords like Zsinj and Thrawn, but they don't inflict the same military defeats like is rumored to have struck the rebels at Jakku in New EU. For whatever reason, it could be that the battle of Jakku bought the Empire breathing room, though at a dear cost, and the bounty on Jedi still stands."
StarWarsEU,3d20p7,DinoDude23,1 point,Mon Jul 13 05:44:31 2015 UTC,"Right Luke had to get away from it all in the time between RotJ and Heir to the Empire where in the EU he had called himself a Jedi Knight so it was roughly 5 years before Luke started training anyone. The Jedi Academy trilogy didnt take place until 7 years after RotJ. So Luke might not be super experienced, but he was experienced enough imo to be able to build back the Jedi Order.   As for your second comment, the Empire was pretty much still in power after Endor. Maybe not as big and bad as the new EU. Up until Thrawns demise the Empire still held Coruscant and successfully lead campaigns as seen in the X-wing series. I am interested to see how the battle of Jakku took place."
StarWarsEU,3d20p7,Canesjags4life,1 point,Tue Jul 14 02:15:05 2015 UTC,"I take your points here. Perhaps there is something going on with regards to Luke that will be explained. Perhaps he does attempt to rebuild the order, but the Empire just alpha-strikes it and murders all of his students, and then pursues him for awhile. He drops off the grid, knowing that training Jedi might attract attention, and he's pretty devastated anyway? Idk, I'm definitely in the camp that says Luke attempted and failed to rebuild the Order within those 30 years."

But don't make it seem like you're being forced out.  You're alienating yourself by choosing to ignore the status quo due to changes that were bound to happen at some point.  It just happened now.  Edit: You're to your."
StarWarsEU,3d20p7,Luy22,16,Sun Jul 12 23:44:34 2015 UTC,The argument can be made Disney alienated him before he chose to do it himself.
StarWarsEU,3d20p7,yodamann,5,Mon Jul 13 03:18:32 2015 UTC,"I agree with your sentiment about being a Star Wars fan, but it always confused me when people who claim that Star Wars was their favorite thing ever and were obsessed with it, never tried to get into the EU. Once I discovered there were Star Wars books, I had to read them, I needed more stories. I understand that some fans are fine with just watching movies or tv shows but the people who claim that they love all things Star Wars but ignore the EU, just confused the hell out of me. What kind of fan doesn't want more of the thing they love?!"
StarWarsEU,3d20p7,Ginkasa,3,Mon Jul 13 12:35:53 2015 UTC,"Same, I knew someone like this. To each their own really but wow, I was pretty much the same. More Star Wars? HELL YES"
StarWarsEU,3d20p7,Canesjags4life,11,Mon Jul 13 17:24:27 2015 UTC,"I don't think the changes were ""bound to happen at some point"". The Star Wars Franchise was strong without the presence of these new movies. And just because /u/zaxa13 doesn't feel the need to abandon their preferred universe doesn't mean that this is their fault. In fact, it's Disney's fault for making this change in the most destructive way."
StarWarsEU,3d20p7,Ginkasa,6,Mon Jul 13 03:22:11 2015 UTC,"The EU couldn't go on indefinitely.  You have to remember: Star Wars is movies.  The EU, regardless of how you personally feel about it, was ultimately just a side-show to the movies.  Without new movies, the EU could not go on.  You can't bring in new audiences to ancillary media without additions to the primary media and, in this case, you really couldn't release new primary media (i.e. a Star Wars movie) and still have it make sense in the confines of the previously release ancillary media.  It was either going to make no sense to and completely alienate the cast majority of the movie-going audience, or make no sense to and completely alienate the relatively tiny EU audience.  It wouldn't work.   I also completely reject the idea that this change was made in the most destructive way.  It maybe upsets you and some unknown percentage of people who have enjoyed EU materials, but, as stated, EU fans are a relatively small group.  People unable to accept the new status quo are an even smaller group.  Disney could choose to alienate a very, very small percentage of their audience, or alienate the vast majority of their audience.  They chose the less damaging option.  There was no way to make it work for everyone."
StarWarsEU,3d20p7,Canesjags4life,11,Mon Jul 13 04:31:32 2015 UTC,"Except the EU was operating fine without new movies. The comics would kept going, there were plans for Sword of the Jedi trilogy, and the Sith era books would have kept churning. There wasnt a need for new movies.   I just wish the Legends storyline would have been able to continue. what was set up by Fate of the Jedi never got to end."
StarWarsEU,3d20p7,Ginkasa,1 point,Mon Jul 13 04:45:22 2015 UTC,"It was at the moment, but it couldn't last was my point. Not forever. Not if primary media is never released."
StarWarsEU,3d20p7,fearsomeduckins,7,Mon Jul 13 04:54:21 2015 UTC,We'll never know. It did pretty well for itself during the gap between RotJ and Phantom Menace.
StarWarsEU,3d20p7,Ginkasa,3,Mon Jul 13 05:25:09 2015 UTC,You're right.  We can't know how the EU would have performed in the next decade or two in the absence of new movies.  What we will and can to an extent already know is how much Star Wars will be in the public consciousness like it hasn't been since 2005 and how much money Disney is going to make off of TFA and the spin offs and sequels and tie-ins regardless of how sad a vocal minority feels about the Legends status of tie-ins released prior to 2014.
StarWarsEU,3d20p7,fearsomeduckins,5,Mon Jul 13 06:51:07 2015 UTC,"I disagree that the EU couldn't continue without new movies. The EU took off in a time when there weren't new movies, and it did quite well. It's also been going quite strong in the decade since the last movie. But that question aside, there was room for new movies in the EU framework. There are already plans for spin off films that could have easily fit in with the old universe, and with the entire galaxy and all of its history open there's plenty of room for entirely new series in the universe. The only thing that would have been difficult to do is the continuation of the Han/Luke/Leia story because it would pick up after so much more stuff has already happened. And yet, in the new films, that's exactly what's happening. We're just getting a big empty space in between 6 and 7 instead of a big filled in space. Although I will grant that the Vong made it a bit more complicated. Dropping everyone suddenly into a post-Vong galaxy would be more confusing than dropping them into a galaxy where that never happened. But they could have just tied the main storyline off at episode 6 and it would have been fine, except that getting the old crew back together is the clear money maker, lore be damned."
StarWarsEU,3d20p7,Ginkasa,5,Mon Jul 13 05:52:07 2015 UTC,"The EU took off at a time when there was virtually nothing but the movies.  People wanted to see what happened to Luke, Leia, and Han after RotJ and that's what Heir to the Empire and its sequels provided.  The EU continued on from there.  We're 20 years past that.  Those stories have now been told and the stories following those stories have been told, etc.  The EU was reaching the point that comics have been struggling with for decades.  The story had advanced so far that soon the audience was going to be comprised of only the people who had been following along that long and the few who had the time, inclination, and money to catch up.  The people who wanted Heir to the Empire could still buy Heir to Empire.  There was no guarantee they'd still be on board for The Sword of the Jedi or whatever future stories would have been told.  You are right that TFA is happening a long time after the OT anyway, but you are also right in recognizing its a big empty space.  TFA is truly Episode VII and can truly be the sequel to RotJ.  Any movie released within the confines of the EU would only be the next EU story.  The back story to this hypothetical EU Episode VII wouldn't be back story, but required back reading.  It'd be more like trying to watch RotJ without having first seen ANH and ESB than watching ANH without having seen the prequels.  I mean, yeah, they could have made that movie and I'm sure that everyone who had read the EU would absolutely hate it for ruining this or that character(because, let's be honest, 90% of the EU not written by Zahn or with the title X-Wing is received poorly in general) love it, but the general audience would hate it.    And before someone comments about the evils of Disney looking to just make money, keep in mind that every single piece of EU material was commissioned and released for the sole purpose of taking your money.  They just had a smaller target audience. Edit: Oh, I forgot you already did."
StarWarsEU,3d20p7,fearsomeduckins,6,Mon Jul 13 06:46:09 2015 UTC,"I suppose I agree about the EU audience, but at the same time, somewhat tautologically, the only people interested in the EU were already people who were into the EU, if that makes sense. The vast majority of fans will never crack open an EU story, whether that be an old universe one or a new universe one. Most fans are casual fans who just watch the movies, and the EU was always (and still is) for people who want more than that. Even with the new movies, most people are only going to watch the movies, and they won't care about the EU at all. But now a lot of the people who were interested in the EU aren't as much anymore, because it's all been changed. So from a business perspective, they must be counting on the new films bringing in more new people than they alienated when the dumped the old EU. Which I guess remains to be seen.   And I don't mean to imply that it's evil for a corporation to want to make money, of course they need to do that and that's perfectly reasonable. I just don't want a story that I care about to be compromised for financial reasons. They can keep making money just by putting ""Star Wars"" in the title of a movie, but I would prefer that they also had sound story reasons to make the film, rather than just cranking them out for the money. And that's a criticism that goes for a lot of the old EU as well."
StarWarsEU,3d20p7,tunnel-snakes-rule,2,Mon Jul 13 07:06:58 2015 UTC,"I think you're overestimating the amount of people who will not buy new novels and whatnot due to the reboot.  I'm fairly certain even a lot of people who aren't happy with the EU reboot are still checking out these new releases.  That's just how fandoms work a lot of the time.  We buy and buy and buy and we complain when we don't like something, but we still buy.  It has to be pretty bad before you see fandoms truly abandon their franchise of choice.  And the material released so far its pretty tame.  I don't believe there has been too much blatant contradiction that would be noticeable to anyone but the most detail oriented.  Some people have even applauded a few references, minor they may be, to previous Legends material.  I think this has been designed as such to first protect TFA's secrets, but also to provide a bit of a buffer and ease some pre-existing fans into the new canon.  As far as the new films artistic integrity, I'm waiting to see the movie before making any calls.  Yeah, the OT didn't need a sequel, but stories rarely need to be told.  So long as it works, I'm good."
StarWarsEU,3d20p7,BridgetheDivide,3,Mon Jul 13 07:16:44 2015 UTC,"No, I'm not. Although I can see how it kind of sounds like that. But a segment of the fandom will stop because of this, and a new segment will join because of it, and a core (probably the majority) will just continue on. Because the core was going to continue either way though, what matters is the people who leave vs. the people who arrive. Personally I haven't been keeping up with the new EU, because I already invested so much time into the era that they're currently covering and it's kind of distasteful to see that all go to waste. I'm trying to maintain cautious optimism for the new movie though, and if that's good then maybe I'll decide the new EU is worth the investment after all. For me, the canon wipe basically means that they put themselves back into a position of having to prove themselves, vs just automatically reading everything. Which may actually be for the better, in some ways, because with the old universe I was already so invested that I would just keep going no matter the quality of the story, but with the new one, if it's not good, I probably won't bother."
StarWarsEU,3d20p7,yodamann,3,Mon Jul 13 07:39:59 2015 UTC,"I kind of get where he's coming from. It's like me with Jurassic Park. I was twelve or thirteen when that came out, I watched all the sequels in the cinema, but as soon as I saw the trailer for Jurassic World I wasn't excited or angry or anything really... I just realised I was no longer the target audience.  It's not that I'm less of a Jurassic fan than anyone else, just that it's moved on (or I have) and if I like it then that's an added bonus, but if I don't it doesn't matter because they're not marketing it to me."
StarWarsEU,3d20p7,Ginkasa,5,Mon Jul 13 06:43:24 2015 UTC,I just think of the old canon as the Ultimate Universe or Earth-2 of Star Wars. There's no reason we can't have both.
StarWarsEU,3d20p7,OtakuMecha,8,Mon Jul 13 03:00:50 2015 UTC,"Let's be honest, the DisnEU is the Earth-2 of Star Wars."
StarWarsEU,3d20p7,Ginkasa,1 point,Mon Jul 13 03:28:45 2015 UTC,That's not honesty.  That's denial.
StarWarsEU,3d20p7,OtakuMecha,10,Mon Jul 13 04:33:18 2015 UTC,Same here. The universe I grew up with is the real Star Wars to me but now so many people will just dismiss the universe I care about.
StarWarsEU,3d20p7,Wallsie,6,Sun Jul 12 23:55:13 2015 UTC,Maybe the same way you're planning the dismiss the universe that a whole new generation is going to grow up caring about?  If you're ever been annoyed at a person older than you disliking something you enjoy just because its different: congratulations.  You are now that old person.
StarWarsEU,3d20p7,OtakuMecha,9,Mon Jul 13 00:23:14 2015 UTC,"Maybe so but that doesn't change how I feel. Though I don't dismiss the new solely because it's new. There's tons of other franchises where I like multiple incarnations. I just happen to not like how this new one is going and it makes me sad that is what everyone will know as ""Star Wars"" in a few years while all my favorite parts are just being dismissed as hearsay legends."
StarWarsEU,3d20p7,Wallsie,2,Mon Jul 13 00:36:25 2015 UTC,You have no idea where this current generation is going until the movie releases. Give it until December before you start complaining for no reason.
StarWarsEU,3d20p7,Ginkasa,7,Mon Jul 13 02:02:20 2015 UTC,They've already been releasing stuff in the new canon.
StarWarsEU,3d20p7,thebardingreen,1 point,Mon Jul 13 02:26:15 2015 UTC,"And until the movies come out (the things that impact canon in the biggest way), you will not have a clear picture what they plan to do with the general story of the Star Wars universe."
StarWarsEU,3d20p7,concrete_isnt_cement,2,Wed Jul 15 02:00:56 2015 UTC,In what way is it going that you don't like it?  The thing has barely begun and won't really be in earnest until the movie comes out in December.
StarWarsEU,3d20p7,OtakuMecha,4,Mon Jul 13 02:11:32 2015 UTC,"Without Thrawn, the story is dead to me, a pale shadow of the greatness that could have been.  There is NO penance that J.J. and Disney can offer me, no greatness that they can achieve that will appease me.  You will pry the EU from my cold, dead fingers.  I will not shut up about it.  I will carry the torch.  Night gathers and now my watch begins.  It shall not end until my death."
StarWarsEU,3d20p7,Ginkasa,1 point,Mon Jul 13 08:47:47 2015 UTC,Thrawn could very well still exist in the new canon for all we know. We won't know for sure until the film comes out.
StarWarsEU,3d20p7,OtakuMecha,3,Tue Jul 14 06:59:51 2015 UTC,There's some stuff in the newer books and TCW that contradict the old canon that I'm not a fan of.
StarWarsEU,3d20p7,thebardingreen,4,Mon Jul 13 02:24:06 2015 UTC,"So, you're not a fan because it contradicts the old canon? I.e. you don't like it because its new?  I mean, if you don't like it then you don't like it, but acknowledge at least the reason.  You are the old man complaining that the music was better back in your day (as a metaphor)."
StarWarsEU,3d20p7,MitthrawnuruodoVCR,5,Mon Jul 13 02:29:34 2015 UTC,"No I mean I don't like some of the story/lore choices. That's what I'm saying. It's not just cause it's new, I just prefer the stuff in the old one. And even that normally wouldn't be a problem. Things I like such as TMNT for ine example also have different incarnations with different lore. But in those cases, they are treated as seperate but equal universes with the old ones still getting promotion. The ""Legends"" and ""Canon"" label put an obvious spin of ""The Disney version is the true story and the old stories are just myths"" on it which makes one universe clearly superior canonically rather than just selling is as seperate but equal universes."
StarWarsEU,3d20p7,christlarson94,0,Mon Jul 13 02:47:41 2015 UTC,Yep.  So wipe that smile off your face and stay the frack off my lawn!
StarWarsEU,3d20p7,rex_dart_eskimo_spy,4,Mon Jul 13 08:43:17 2015 UTC,"This is me. I read pretty much the entire EU and I have intense nostalgia around most things, so I am not too excited about Disney making a new trilogy. At the same time, I am happy that we even get to see a new trilogy and the origins like movies. It's better than no more live movies. I am quarantining myself as much as possible from news about Ep7, I am going in there at midnight release with little expectations but hoping for a great, great movie."
StarWarsEU,3d20p7,yodamann,16,Mon Jul 13 02:28:44 2015 UTC,"""I can't appreciate multiple things."""
StarWarsEU,3d20p7,Canesjags4life,9,Sun Jul 12 22:48:12 2015 UTC,"Seriously.  I don't know why fans let it bother them so much.  It's different now, sorry if that sucks for you, but you still have thirty years of stories to enjoy.  There's a new goddamn Star Wars movie coming out!  How the hell isn't that something to get excited about?  It's akin to old men complaining about how things are different now."
StarWarsEU,3d20p7,zaxa13,9,Sun Jul 12 23:15:28 2015 UTC,"Because the new Star Wars story is only tangentially related to the franchise I grew to love through the EU. Sure they share the same foundation in the 6 original films, but the EU had so many stories, so many characters, so much stuff that this new story just doesn't. It's like growing up in a house, and then one day someone knocks down all the walls leaving a only concrete pad that they then start a new house on. Sure the most basic element of the house is the same, but most of what made that house special and interesting is gone.  As for the 30 years of stories, sure they're still there, but there were still plenty of stories to tell in that setting. Sword of the Jedi springs immediately to mind."
StarWarsEU,3d20p7,Ginkasa,7,Mon Jul 13 03:27:23 2015 UTC,Man i so wished that Sword of the Jedi had been written and published. Makes me sad that Crucible was the last EU book involving the Solo-Skywalker clan
StarWarsEU,3d20p7,Ginkasa,-1,Mon Jul 13 04:51:36 2015 UTC,Don't put words in my mouth.
StarWarsEU,3d20p7,yodamann,3,Sun Jul 12 22:52:49 2015 UTC,I know this is a bad thing to think. But i feel like people who have only seen the movies but havent read the books or comics aren't really starwars fans. They are fans of the star wars movies but not of Starwars.
StarWarsEU,3d20p7,christlarson94,3,Sun Jul 12 22:54:39 2015 UTC,"It is a bad thing to think.  Star Wars is the movies.  I've enjoyed the EU as much as anyone, but Star Wars is first and foremost a film series and nothing else would exist without those films.  Its like declaring that people who only read Batman comics and don't enjoy the movies are just Batman comic fans, but not Batman fans."
StarWarsEU,3d20p7,rex_dart_eskimo_spy,0,Mon Jul 13 00:24:57 2015 UTC,No thats turned around. The comics for batman came first and the movies later. It would work better if you reversed it. But yes the EU wouldn't be around without the movies but there is so so much it added that when people only look at the movies they find the universe shallow.
StarWarsEU,3d20p7,Ginkasa,5,Mon Jul 13 00:30:28 2015 UTC,"The problem is it works exactly in relation to your comment.  The Star Wars movies came first, but you claimed that anyone who only likes the Star Wars movies and not the books or comics are only Star Wars movie fans and not Star Wars fans.  Batman comics came first, so I likened your comment about Star Wars to someone declaring that a person who only likes the Batman comics are just Batman comic fans and not Batman fans in general.  They're both silly comments and serve only to diminish a person and their viewpoint only because they don't have the same exact opinion and likes/dislikes as you.  And I think everyone who enjoys the movies does so because it provides a universe that isn't shallow due to its variety of alien characters and robots and planets.  You don't need 100,000 pages of story telling wildly divergent in tone and quality to make a universe deep."
StarWarsEU,3d20p7,Ginkasa,12,Mon Jul 13 02:17:36 2015 UTC,"""The post-Return of the Jedi era just got a whole lot more fascinating than it has ever been""  Really. This bare-bones version of the EU is more interesting than the real thing.  Also, ""Grand Vizier Mas Amedda""? Really? This guy from the republic is still around? Everyone knows that Sate Pestage was the Grand Vizier.   Finally, I don't care about EU references I was EU continuation keep these movies separate and let the EU go on as its own entity."
StarWarsEU,3d20p7,Ginkasa,9,Sun Jul 12 22:12:44 2015 UTC,I know and it brings up my hate for how people act like there was no lore in the EU. But it does give me hope.
StarWarsEU,3d20p7,yodamann,-1,Sun Jul 12 22:18:33 2015 UTC,There was lore. And it all contradicted itself.
StarWarsEU,3d20p7,SophieTheCat,16,Sun Jul 12 22:49:01 2015 UTC,"No it didn't. The only times it did was when Lucas told the writers one thing about the universe and then did something else in the movies. No one was on two planets at the same time. The only person who had a confusing back story was boba and that was becasue lucas kept changing it so they had to keep adding more lore onto it. For a 20 year series with 200+ books not to mention games and comics it has the most clear, easy to follow, and least messy lore of any series."
StarWarsEU,3d20p7,solo89,-1,Sun Jul 12 22:53:40 2015 UTC,"No it didn't. The only times it did was when Lucas told the writers one thing about the universe and then did something else in the movies. No one was on two planets at the same time.    First off, I doubt that Lucas had much of a hand in the EU.  He always considered them separate from his movies.  When he wanted to do something in his movies or TV show, it trumped everything else.   The only person who had a confusing back story was boba and that was becasue lucas kept changing it so they had to keep adding more lore onto it.    Again, Lucas didn't ""keep changing"" anything.  He created one origin for Boba Fett, and everything else was non-canonical."
StarWarsEU,3d20p7,solo89,7,Sun Jul 12 23:12:47 2015 UTC,I'm not going to have this debate.

StarWarsEU,3d20p7,Luy22,2,Mon Jul 13 00:33:23 2015 UTC,"I have never seen anyone refer to Legends as not being part of the Star Wars brand or being commissioned as Star Wars or whatever.  I think if you're seeing that you're probably reading too much in to some comments.  Yeah, there's going to be people who don't really care about the Legends because its no longer canon with new materials, but its not a personal attack against anyone who likes Legends or contributes to Legends."
StarWarsEU,3cxpz7,psythedude,26,Sat Jul 11 18:43:45 2015 UTC,"Qui-Gon's explanation in The Phantom Menace is always what I go back to here.  I usually quote the whole thing, but short version: midichlorians are stated to do two things. They make life possible, and they tell you the will of the Force.  They are also stated to be present in the cells of all living things. All of them. Now, the blood test does imply that higher concentrations correlate with Force-sensitivity, but everybody does have some quantity of them.  They are not the Force. They do not make the Force. They only do what I said above."
StarWarsEU,3cxpz7,GodotIsWaiting4U,2,Sat Jul 11 19:55:12 2015 UTC,"the thing is, while i agree with what you're saying, just because Qui-Gon said that, doesnt necessarily make it true.  it think it was also stated at one point that they don't know very much about the midi's"
StarWarsEU,3cxpz7,SexualPie,3,Sun Jul 12 00:52:15 2015 UTC,"They know enough to test for it. The movies give us enough to know they live in ALL living this, but leave enough ambiguibty for us to ramble about it. Here's a ramble, midichlorians make all life possible, and according to cell theory, a cell is the simplest functional unit of life. Think of midichlorians as the next lowest level, their properties giving cells the direction on how to operate individually and symbiotically. They allow cells to communicate across long distances, they can operate together to minutely manipulate surrounding electrons. A person maybe born with a larger than normal midi count, but that only accounts for natural ability. Anyone devoted to jedi or sith teachings could learn how to communicate to their midichlorians, persuading them to divide, thus creating a higher count, but that takes lifelong dedication. Once you have that connection, you can persuade the midichlorians to interact with their surroundings, exciting electrons in rocks and atmosphere to so they temporarily become lighter than the immediately surrounding air and appear to levitate and build momentum, disrupt ionic stability causing violent electric discharge, tell muscle cells to powerfully contract around the esophogus. The Force has always been talking to us, we've been listening for over 30,000 years, it's locked down to a science. To know how to listen and thus manipulate is a deep spiritual journey that only a fraction of a fraction of galaxy can even perceive embarking on. It's not only for the most stoic minds, some are born with a prodegetic perception, often without even realizing it."
StarWarsEU,3cxpz7,thegoodnameswereused,1 point,Sun Jul 12 04:05:47 2015 UTC,Wasn't stated in the films. Maybe in The Clone Wars?
StarWarsEU,3cxpz7,GodotIsWaiting4U,8,Sun Jul 12 01:11:14 2015 UTC,"One way I've always thought of it:  the Force is what gives a Jedi his power. It's an energy field created by all living things. It surrounds us and penetrates us; it binds the galaxy together -Obi-Wan Kenobi  If the Force is created by living things, having additional living things within you would increase your proclivity to being strong with the Force. It doesn't automatically mean you'll be a great Jedi or a Lord of the Sith, but your potential to harness that power is higher than someone without midichlorians.   It's not an embodiment of the Force, its an advantage a force user can have."
StarWarsEU,3cxpz7,t30ne,3,Sat Jul 11 19:44:02 2015 UTC,"I liked it. Star Wars has always been more fantasy than science fiction. Midichlorians make it a bit more on the sci-fi side of things. I do know that they were in the first drafts in the 70's. No one really mentioned them in the OT because they didn't have to. TPM was what established the Jedi Order of old and how the Force actually worked, though they could've executed and expanded on it a little better."

StarWarsEU,3cu29f,edwardantonowicz,10,Fri Jul 10 19:51:56 2015 UTC,I just want a nice Leia figure that has clothes on (meaning not slave Leia).
StarWarsEU,3cu29f,PrincessLeia91,3,Sat Jul 11 04:29:50 2015 UTC,Psyched. Originally I thought that these were 3.75' figures and wanted Sabine but once I found out it was 6' I was Revan all the way!
StarWarsEU,3cu29f,clwestbr,3,Sat Jul 11 00:25:51 2015 UTC,"theyre still doing Sabine. Revan will just get the distinction of being called ""fan's choice"""
StarWarsEU,3cu29f,dagnummit,2,Sat Jul 11 04:06:46 2015 UTC,Ah. Well bully for that then.
StarWarsEU,3cu29f,clwestbr,5,Sat Jul 11 04:07:33 2015 UTC,"Here's hoping that this is official Star Wars information and that solidifies Revan in canon...  I haven't been following this much at all, have they released any information on that?  Is this just in line with the SWTOR game or is this part of the new canon?  I'm sure this question must be asked of Disney day and night."
StarWarsEU,3cu29f,the_gv3,16,Fri Jul 10 20:05:01 2015 UTC,"As far as I know, a character/story is only canon if it passes through the lens of media like novels, comics, or video games. We might see them make an attempt at reeling Revan back in, but it probably won't be for a while, since LucasArts is focused on the timeline immediately surrounding the Original Trilogy primarily."
StarWarsEU,3cu29f,outbound_flight,5,Fri Jul 10 20:33:38 2015 UTC,"Bummerrrr.  Maybe they will take the love for Revan as incentive to keep that era intact, more or less, when they get to that part of the timeline."
StarWarsEU,3cu29f,the_gv3,9,Fri Jul 10 20:52:52 2015 UTC,As long as it's the proper KOTOR Revan.
StarWarsEU,3cu29f,MasterMac94,-2,Fri Jul 10 20:58:44 2015 UTC,Guys this does not mean Revan. This is an fan choice. I even have proof that Revan is not canon and won't become canon.
StarWarsEU,3cu29f,fearsomeduckins,12,Fri Jul 10 22:12:02 2015 UTC,Well then let's see it. Although I'm not sure how you could have proof that he won't become canon. All it needs is one writer to decide to work him back in.
StarWarsEU,3cu29f,the_gv3,1 point,Sat Jul 11 01:36:12 2015 UTC,It was Disney's choice to include him on the ballot...

I wonder if we'll see some of their journey in the comic, or if they're keeping that until after the movie comes out? It will be interesting if the roles of books and comics get flipped now."
StarWarsEU,3co9p6,nickfel,3,Thu Jul 9 14:08:00 2015 UTC,"I imagine the main characters will be in the comic, and then trickle into the book set after Aftermath (since it is a trilogy)."

StarWarsEU,3co9p6,tunnel-snakes-rule,2,Fri Jul 10 01:26:38 2015 UTC,"I think his very presence as a protagonist is actually a clever bit of fan service. The X-wing series was one of the more popular EU series, and I would guess that a lot of people buying the new wave of Star Wars books also read the old EU. I doubt Wendig will do anything drastic to change him from the EU version of Wedge."
StarWarsEU,3co9p6,wookiewin,3,Fri Jul 10 05:38:58 2015 UTC,"It's unclear in the article, but are the Luke, Leia and Han/Chewbacca books Young Adult or full-fledged novels?  The Lost Stars book is the only one actually labeled as ""Young Adult."""
StarWarsEU,3co9p6,Sapitoelgato,7,Thu Jul 9 13:37:50 2015 UTC,I got the impression that those three are also Young Adult books. Still look interesting though!
StarWarsEU,3co9p6,mkaito,3,Thu Jul 9 13:42:14 2015 UTC,"They are all young adult. Amazon lists the page numbers. Lost Stars is the only ""long"" one. The rest are roughly less than 200 pages."

StarWarsEU,3co9p6,mkaito,2,Thu Jul 9 14:07:46 2015 UTC,The young adult books have been pretty good thus far. I'm excited for these.
StarWarsEU,3co9p6,omarh14,3,Thu Jul 9 15:22:06 2015 UTC,"YA doesn't necessarily mean that they're bad. Just that they're short and simple, because they are geared to a younger audience. I like my books to be heavy and deep, and while I don't always get what I want, that doesn't mean I should stop looking for it :P"
StarWarsEU,3co9p6,Sapitoelgato,2,Thu Jul 9 16:17:03 2015 UTC,Makes sense if that's what you prefer. For a person like me who wants to get all canon material these books still hold up as good stories. Regardless of who they are meant for .
StarWarsEU,3cj3ic,afterbang,5,Wed Jul 8 08:38:24 2015 UTC,"Yup, that's what I did."
StarWarsEU,3cj3ic,zaxa13,5,Wed Jul 8 09:39:45 2015 UTC,"Many people will say skip the Dark Nest Trilogy, which you can do, but I personally would recommend reading it.  It's not the best series, it isn't a literary masterpiece, even by EU standards, but it's a change of pace and gives some background into the Legacy of the Force series.  While that background is covered to the point where you can understand what's going on in LOTF, it does add depth that you won't get by skipping it.  So, I would read the Dark Nest and then move into LOTF.  Enjoy!!"
StarWarsEU,3cj3ic,the_gv3,4,Wed Jul 8 17:06:54 2015 UTC,"Dark Nest trilogy is pretty good. Great concept, and I really like Jacen in it."
StarWarsEU,3cj3ic,golgammer,3,Wed Jul 8 19:12:10 2015 UTC,"Apparently Vision of the Future was at one point pondered to be the ""end"" of the post-RotJ EU, and Lucas signaled this to Zahn (who ended the book in a kind of ""the future is hopeful and all is well"" kind of way).  Obviously the story continued, and LucasFilm took an enormous, coordinated approach to making the NJO. I enjoyed it (except Chewie's death - I will always be bitter about that). I was excited to see what happened next. Unfortunately, I don't think The Dark Nest Trilogy was all too great. Definitely not one of Denning's better works, and the story was a bit...collateral. Felt like a distraction from the actual important/main part of the galaxy. My recommendation is to skip it and just read up about it on Wookieepedia.  Legacy of the Force seemed to be trying too hard to establish the ""history repeats itself"" dynamic - a lot of it was plain silly, IMO. And then a beloved EU character was killed off without the permission of the character's creator - ridiculous. I did enjoy all the Mandalorian stuff, and was happy to see the linkage (by Traviss) to the Republic Commando novels. And generally I felt the series was well-written and it was a gripping story. Jaina's kind of awesome.  And then came Fate of the Jedi. Not going to lie - I was hooked for a while. The initial premise kind of made a lot of sense to me from a logical legal/governmental/societal point of view. And then dumb shit happened. A ludicrous, very not-SW antagonist. The return of a certain insidious group...to Coruscant through absurd means. All my WTF. A certain author stuffed like 9 major story events into one book and it was...I had whiplash, and none of the story events were thoroughly fleshed out as a result. Jagged Fel did keep appearing, and I always enjoy stuff regarding Fel/the Chiss.  I love the EU. I regard it as the true story of Star Wars and I abhor Disney. But I cannot recommend the series after the NJO - maybe the LotF series if you're prepared for some serious heartbreak. If you like it, swing through the FotJ, with minimized expectations.  IMO the golden series of the post-RotJ EU were all the ""Tales From ____"" books, The Bounty Hunter Wars, The Courtship of Princess Leia, The Thrawn Trilogy, I, Jedi, The Hand of Thrawn Duology, Survivor's Quest, and The NJO. I'm sure the X-Wing series belong in there, but I've never read them so I can't speak to them (yes, I'm a fool, please don't hit me). I've also heard Luke Skywalker and the Shadows of Mindor is great, but I haven't gotten to that.  If there had been a stop to the post-RotJ story after Survivor's Quest or the NJO, I'd have been alright with that, seeing how things turned out. :/"
StarWarsEU,3cj3ic,PR-0927,1 point,Wed Jul 8 17:15:06 2015 UTC,"Yeah, agreed. It's all a bit of a dud after NJO.  The problem is they wanted to follow up the NJO... but you can't really follow a series of that size and complexity. It's a tough ask to get readers to commit to another 5 year series; but equally, doing the odd book here and there feels directionless and the stakes will be pretty low after the craziness that was the NJO.  Their solution -- 9 book runs -- was even worse, because it didn't really work on either level.  This is why I'm a big advocate of the Legacy comic series. It took a totally different path. And it avoids the fatigue of one galaxy spanning war after another after another. There's a solid break of decades there, and none of the organisations are quite what you expect them to be."
StarWarsEU,3cj3ic,ravih,1 point,Thu Jul 9 11:59:12 2015 UTC,"In terms of the Dark Nest trilogy.  I enjoyed it because it wasn't the usual galaxy threatening super weapon, big-bad Empire/YV invasion.  Definitely towards the bottom of my list of books in order of enjoyment, but it was a nice change of pace.  That being said, I guess the threat was potentially galaxy changing...but if the Jedi hadn't stepped in, the Chiss would have."
StarWarsEU,3cj3ic,the_gv3,5,Fri Jul 10 20:10:47 2015 UTC,"If I may make a slightly off-beat suggestion: IMO, the true ""continuation"" of the NJO series is... the Star Wars Legacy comics from Dark Horse.  Aside from a pretty brief section in the first book of the Dark Nest trilogy, I feel a little like the events of the NJO were basically swept aside. Legacy and Fate make token references to it, but that's about it.  The plot of the Legacy comic series, however, is virtually directly based on the events of the NJO. They don't linger on it, but to me they paint a true-r picture of a galaxy recovering from the effects of a crazy war.  You may not be into reading the comics, and that's fine. To be honest, with Dark Horse losing the license, I'm not even sure how you'd get them anymore. But they're a good read, and present an entirely different and pretty fresh take on the Star Wars universe. Yeah, they don't involve the classic characters we love. But it does allow you to get a new perspective on the GFFA.  And if you want to go back to Dark Nest, Legacy and Fate after that, I think you can -- I don't think the Legacy comics spoil the events of those books, but I might be wrong."
StarWarsEU,3cj3ic,ravih,2,Wed Jul 8 16:28:20 2015 UTC,"And if you want to go back to Dark Nest, Legacy and Fate after that, I think you can -- I don't think the Legacy comics spoil the events of those books, but I might be wrong.   I imagine it implies the ""oh yeah the heroes more or less won. again."" bit, but that can be assumed 99% of the time."

StarWarsEU,3cj3ic,roninjedi,2,Thu Jul 9 01:35:10 2015 UTC,That sounds interesting. I definitely don't mind reading comics so I will try to look for those if I can find them. Thanks!
StarWarsEU,3cj3ic,nate517,2,Wed Jul 8 18:45:32 2015 UTC,"The dark nest trilogy is pretty good the pacing can seem off in them, however I think it sets LOTF well and I absolutely loved that series. So I would recommend reading both of them, also if you like Jacen then I would especially recommend the dark nest trilogy."
StarWarsEU,3cj3ic,DespicableMessiah,2,Thu Jul 9 02:46:53 2015 UTC,An addendum: if you like Jacen prepare for massive nerd rage at his handling in LotF.
StarWarsEU,3cj3ic,nate517,2,Thu Jul 9 21:49:07 2015 UTC,"True enough. Though the early series Jacen I liked, though just post Exile Jacen was a lot different."
StarWarsEU,3cj3ic,DespicableMessiah,2,Thu Jul 9 21:57:41 2015 UTC,"I wish they left more ambiguity, the whole concept of a moral dark side rejecting the dichotomy really had potential. I'm glad the idea was explored, but regret the execution."
StarWarsEU,3cj3ic,nate517,2,Thu Jul 9 23:07:49 2015 UTC,Yeah it almost felt like the writers decided they were not clever enough to go along with it and then went back to the sterotypical evil route.

StarWarsEU,3cj3ic,PotatoQuie,1 point,Wed Jul 8 12:32:21 2015 UTC,"I haven't gotten to Dark Nest Trilogy yet, so I cannot comment on that.    As far as Legacy of the Force, it's complicated.  New Jedi Order was a good series with excitement, drama, and heartbreak.  On the bad side, (In my opinion) it had a lame ending.  Legacy of the Force, on the other hand, had all of the angst and misery of New Jedi Order without any of the excitement.  Read the first book, and if you aren't sold on that, I'd say drop it.  Same for Fate of the Jedi. Legacy of the Force made me miss the days of the standalone Imperial-super-weapon-of-the-week books (yes, even Darksaber)."

StarWarsEU,3cd0bu,Colest,6,Wed Jul 8 17:21:49 2015 UTC,Such a pressing issue. So important. Because girls can only play with girl figurines and people should vote for a character solely based on their sex rather than superfluous things like the depth of their character and their positive influence on the Star Wars universe.
StarWarsEU,3cd0bu,TheNargrath,3,Tue Jul 7 11:23:40 2015 UTC,"I think you're missing the point. Kids often want to play with toys that they can relate to. (Not always, but still.) Girls tend to want to act out the perspective of a girl. Boys want boys.  Bringing more girl action figures into the mix helps make it feel more open to girls. I don't see how that's a negative."
StarWarsEU,3cd0bu,Colest,3,Tue Jul 7 17:00:58 2015 UTC,"The negative is the false dichotomy that people who don't vote for the female action figure are actively voting against girl inclusion into the medium.  The negative is that it's actively encouraging people to vote for a character based solely on their gender rather than the character that appeals to them the most or represents the most endearing aspects of the lore the most.  The negative is that, yet again, a simple vote for a toy is needlessly politicized.  I mentioned the first two reasons in my previous post as well. If I really wanted to push this to an extreme I'd make the argument that by encouraging the dynamic of girls preferring girl action figures you're further entrenching our society into strict gender roles, which is undeniably a negative thing for equality."
StarWarsEU,3cd0bu,KingKablamo,1 point,Tue Jul 7 18:44:57 2015 UTC,"People should vote for whoever they want. I voted for Revan myself, and it's obvious he's going to win.

StarWarsEU,3cd0bu,DarkStar5758,2,Tue Jul 7 05:28:41 2015 UTC,I swear to god if we get Sabine instead of fucking Revan....hell will be raised.

StarWarsEU,3c4ov3,Sapitoelgato,5,Sat Jul 4 23:09:13 2015 UTC,I liked it a lot. It was a fun read and a lot of recent Star Wars books have no sense of fun at all.
StarWarsEU,3c4ov3,Johnny_Welfare,5,Sat Jul 4 21:15:40 2015 UTC,The humour made me miss Allston a lot. :(
StarWarsEU,3c4ov3,Johnny_Welfare,5,Sat Jul 4 22:08:32 2015 UTC,"I think Allston and a maybe a handful of other authors were the only ones to really ""get"" Star Wars. It has to have a sense of humor, but it can't be a forced, Jar-Jar style of humor. Allston's stuff was almost too humorous at times, but he did an amazing job balancing it out with more heartfelt stuff. His description of Ton Phanan dying stuck with me for years."
StarWarsEU,3c4ov3,tyereliusprime,7,Sun Jul 5 00:41:57 2015 UTC,Allston's run with the X Wing series is some of the best character development in the EU.
StarWarsEU,3c4ov3,ganthetjr,5,Sun Jul 5 04:35:59 2015 UTC,"I've heard this view on Luke's characterization, and definitely understand where you're coming from there. I'd like to offer my take on it, since I took away a different vibe from it. Looking at the movies alone, Luke - arguably more so than any other character in the original trilogy - has the most development in terms of personality. The Luke of ESB is very different than the Luke of ANH, just as the RotJ Luke is different from the ESB Luke.  The Luke of Heir to the Jedi is a transitional Luke that we haven't seen before. I mean, externally, we have in Legends, but not quite like this. ANH Luke wanted adventure, self-liberation, and had a young, teenagery streak of whininess (not a dig... I mean in a normal, relatable way). Yes, he experiences terrible loss in the original film, but the events hardly have a chance to sink in before the credits roll. We don't see the fallout. Three years later, in ESB, Luke is a leader. He's still a bit hotheaded and impulsive, and definitely still a bit emotional, but not in a whiny, youthful way. It's more of a despairing self-doubt. He impulsively jumps up to the plate, but not with a sense of adventure, but with a sort of grim sense of duty to his friends.  There's a lot unsaid in regard to the transition between these two phases of Luke. This book delves into a lot of that in a way that I found irresistibly fascinating. Luke is depicted as a bit of an introvert. We don't get a great sense of what Luke is feeling, what his needs are, what makes him tick. One could argue that any attempt to get in his head in the manner of a first-person narrative would be initially jarring. Truth is, the very act of getting in his head and letting him serve as the narrator is going to produce an unfamiliar Luke, because as a whole, what we see of Luke in the films - and most other narratives involving him - is what he does out of duty. While his sense of duty itself implies a great deal about his nature, it leaves unsaid the things Luke elects to set aside for the sake of his duty. This is the first time we've learned anything else about him. In this book, we're directly accessing the personality, likes, dislikes, hopes, fears, joys, and grievances that Luke usually sets aside for the sake of a higher purpose. We're seeing Luke on the inside looking out as opposed to the outside looking in, which reveals things we wouldn't have ever known because Luke has humbly kept them to himself.  In terms of behavior (Fun fact: my iPad just tried to autocorrect a typoed version of ""behavior"" to ""heavy oral"". The fuck?), or more generally, the things that would have been the same whichever way Luke is being observed (internally or externally, first-person or third-person), I still feel as if his characterization here is in line with what we understand and know about the character. Given that every Hamill portrayal of Luke was developed directly to the next stage, so to speak, Kevin Hearne didn't necessarily have to make the choice of going with one film's characterization over another between ANH and ESB. This Luke is wry and has a sense of humor, though it's a bit muted from where it was in ESB, and harder for Luke to bring it about. This Luke still has a sense of wonder and adventure, though it's scarred by the realities of the darker nature of sentient beings and war. This Luke isn't quite jaded, but jading.   I could go on and on about how this transitional Luke fits perfectly between the films that bookend the novel, but that would eventually get annoying for anyone who bothered to read this lol. Also, due to a specific spoilery event near the end of the book, Luke experiences a sort of ""course correction"" in terms of his changing personality. As the book progresses, Luke is developing a certain way, and after said event, we see the beginnings of his ESB persona. I felt like Hearne did a fantastic job of finding many, many little things about Luke's changing personality and hinting about how the little discoveries about life and the galaxy in general snowballed into his overall nature in his later depictions in the films. It was fascinating to experience his worldview (urr... galaxyview?) changing. I appreciated it so much I messaged Hearne on Facebook saying as much, and he (very humbly and graciously) confirmed that that's pretty much exactly what he was going for.  In short, I loved it! :-D"
StarWarsEU,3c4ov3,Thumper13,6,Sun Jul 5 11:31:02 2015 UTC,"I wish the book had been written with this idea in mind, but I have to disagree. Luke jumps from being too worldly (universy?) to suddenly stupid, but not in a savvy ""transitional"" way. The entire structure of the Rebellion has existed with high level military operatives, yet they send one of the least educated among them on a critical mission?  It's almost as if Hearne didn't want any part of the Luke/Leia relationship. I'm sorry, but at this point it's part of the story. He avoided it completely by throwing a random love interest in, which felt forced (huhuh) the entire time. When Luke comments about the ""practicality"" of Leia's outfit I wanted to throw the book away. I pushed through, but in the end the book offered nothing of substance. Hearne didn't do anything to make us need/want this book. It just is, and that's sad."
StarWarsEU,3c4ov3,XAce90,8,Sun Jul 5 18:48:24 2015 UTC,"[WARNING MINOR SPOILERS]  I particularly loved the dark side motif through the book. ""How does one get 'tempted' by the dark side?"" Luke asks himself through the book regarding Darth Vader. Then, in the end, he has this beautiful moment of ""oh shit... that's how.""   Sure, not the greatest Star Wars book ever written, but I don't think it was particularly un-Luke. This is basically the Luke we see at the very end of Ep IV. Unexperienced, untrained, undisciplined, but highly talented and with a strong sense of morality. I thought the author captured young Luke pretty well. But that's all opinion, I suppose.   I also thought this book was leagues above the other NewCanon books I've read =P"
StarWarsEU,3c4ov3,Johnny_Welfare,4,Sat Jul 4 22:25:40 2015 UTC,"Easily the best new canon book so far. Tarkin sucked, New Dawn was good, and even though I haven't started Dark Lords of the Sith I don't hear good things."
StarWarsEU,3c4ov3,thegraverobber,11,Sun Jul 5 00:45:53 2015 UTC,"Wow, I could not disagree more. Opinions are funny things. In terms of both quality and personal preference, I would rank them: Lords of the Sith, Tarkin, A New Dawn, Heir to the Jedi."
StarWarsEU,3c4ov3,XAce90,4,Sun Jul 5 01:48:51 2015 UTC,"Opinions are generally why I stick to philosophy and not 'favorite things' =P  I'd rank them Heir to the Jedi, Lords of the Sith, Tarkin. I haven't read A New Dawn but based on our differences of opinions, I guess I should!"
StarWarsEU,3c4ov3,thegraverobber,3,Sun Jul 5 02:36:58 2015 UTC,I actually really liked A New Dawn - I just loved Lords of the Sith and Tarkin. Those two felt up to par with the best of the old EU.   I probably should've noted the large gap between A New Dawn and Heir to the Jedi. I'm interested in what you'd think about Lords of the Sith.
StarWarsEU,3c4ov3,XAce90,3,Sun Jul 5 11:18:32 2015 UTC,"I thought it was probably the most well rounded and impactful book of the New Canon -- even more than Heir. The problem I have with all the new canon books are that they're really just background books on the main characters of the original trilogy. They haven't really contributed to lore in any way. Sure, we see some great character development in Heir to the Jedi and learn, in great depth, about Tarkin's upbringing and motivation, but we never really learn anything exciting or enriching about the Star Wars universe. No great game changers like Thrawn, Bane, or the Yuuzhan Vong. You can clearly see Disney playing it safe so that they have as much room as possible for future films.   This problem is still true in Dark Lords of the Sith, but I don't think it's as bad as the other books (New Dawn excluded because I haven't read it yet). We get to see important characters doing semi-important things that are actually likely to impact the galaxy. At the very least, they impacted an entire planet. More than Tarkin or Heir can say."
StarWarsEU,3c4ov3,Sapitoelgato,2,Sun Jul 5 19:38:31 2015 UTC,"I am waiting, for them to utilize the Crymorah syndicate and introduce more Imperial agents. So far Rae Sloane keeps getting brought up in short stories, and she plays a role in A New Dawn, but they make it clear she is still new in that story. It will be interesting if she plays a bigger role in Aftermath."
StarWarsEU,3c4ov3,darthideous,3,Mon Jul 6 03:08:36 2015 UTC,I agree with you about Heir to the Jedi - I think it even has the honor of being the worst book I've ever finished.
StarWarsEU,3c4ov3,thegraverobber,3,Sun Jul 5 07:53:34 2015 UTC,"It took me months to get through. The first-person perspective made it feel like a Young Adult novel, and all of the analogies and noodle scenes seemed really silly. Leagues below the rest of the new EU, IMO."
StarWarsEU,3c4ov3,XAce90,3,Sun Jul 5 11:16:33 2015 UTC,"Dark Lords isn't terrible, especially if you read it right after Rise of Darth Vader (now Legends) like I did. You really see how Vader has progressed and how his relationship with the Emperor has changed.   I haven't read A New Dawn yet but Dark Lords is my second favorite (right after Heir)."
StarWarsEU,3c4ov3,Lanuria,3,Sun Jul 5 02:40:10 2015 UTC,The first half of Lords of the Sith was amazing. It was suspenseful and just amazing. The great big ship battle should have been the climax of the book..   Then the last half turned into a lot of 'watch the Sith guys kill lyleks for three chapters!'
StarWarsEU,3c4ov3,Ass_Masster,3,Sun Jul 5 17:12:38 2015 UTC,"Im about 3/4 of the way through it and im getting kind of the same feeling. Towards one of the worst out of 100 star wars books I've read. Though I do feel as if Luke is being luke, and were getting insight into that period of time through his eyes. But I hate the real world analogy, and I don't like the first person, and the writing is pretty weak at best."
StarWarsEU,3c4ov3,Sapitoelgato,1 point,Sun Jul 5 17:35:07 2015 UTC,"One thing that stood out for me is the story structure felt more in line, for a TV series arc or a comic book story."

StarWarsEU,3c4ov3,roninjedi,3,Sat Jul 4 20:33:51 2015 UTC,"Agreed; the ship and noodle moments were cool, but weren't the B-wings originally developed shortly prior to the Battle of Endor?"

That would be my main suggestion of what is good. Other than that, NJO series is long af but has some good moments, the amount of various authors means that it varies in how good different books are, and this trend continues for the most part for all the books after it. Imo, Aaron Allston, Karen Travis, Michael Stackpole, Timothy Zhan, Drew karpyshyn and Troy Denning are worth looking at, the rest are forgettable, as evidenced by me not remembering them."
StarWarsEU,3c2amp,BridgetheDivide,1 point,Sat Jul 4 05:02:55 2015 UTC,"Better than the Bane trilogy? That's tough.  The Thrawn Trilogy is up there, and Traitor is the best Star Wars book period, but it requires more than half of the New Jedi Order as prior reading.  I very much enjoyed the New Jedi Order but I'd be lying if I said it was handled as tightly as Bane's saga. The Jedi Academy Trilogy and the old Han Solo books are great too, but they're not the Bane Trilogy's equal either."
StarWarsEU,3c2amp,outbound_flight,1 point,Sat Jul 4 05:20:09 2015 UTC,"I'm actually not too much of a Bane fan, but if you want SW novels that are dark side-centric and gritty in that way, I would definitely recommend checking out Matthew Stover's contributions. Specifically Shatterpoint, since it's just as psychological as it is violent. Darth Plagueis by James Luceno follows Palpatine's rise to power. It's a very good Sith novel, and was one of the last great stories of the old canon.  Other people are recommending Timothy Zahn's books, too, and I'd definitely agree there. The Thrawn Trilogy (Heir to the Empire, Dark Force Rising, and The Last Command) is a fantastic set of books. They're also good if you want to get a sense of what the EU was built from, since he established a ton of lore in his novels that others followed until they went Legends."
StarWarsEU,3c2amp,MitthrawnuruodoVCR,2,Sat Jul 4 07:47:55 2015 UTC,"I agree, if you read Timothy Zahn and Matthew Stover you are going to get a better understanding of the EU than through reading any other books. Matthew Stover explaining what happened to the Jedi in ROTS and explaining Obi Wan, Windu's, Anakin's and Yoda's strengths and weaknesses is the most valuable reading of the EU IMO.  Timothy Zahn by the same logic got to the core of Palpatine and Luke, and his books are just plain amazing."
StarWarsEU,3c2amp,Luna2112,1 point,Mon Jul 13 02:34:54 2015 UTC,"The Thrawn Trilogy is excellent and a must read, The Hand of Thrawn duology (Specter of the Past & Vision of the Future) is also really good, (Really any of Zahn's work is worth reading)       Death Star is a good standalone that gives some insight into the lives of a few people on the 1st Death Star before and during ANH and ends with the battle of Yavin.        There's also the ""dark lord trilogy"" (Labyrinth of Evil, RotS novelization, Dark Lord: Rise of Darth Vader) which follows Anakin through his fall and into his early days as Vader.  The RotS novel is well worth by itself and adds so much more to the movie and Anakin's character in general. I also enjoyed the Republic Commando and NJO series, though opinions on them seem to be varied.       Just don't read anything beyond NJO, it really becomes a mess. Legacy of the Force and Fate of the Jedi ruined the main characters by having them make decisions and actions that were out of character (particularly LotF), and follow events that were illogical."

To combat some made up quasi-political threat involving a superweapon stuck together by some rogue Moff nobody has ever heard of because Ship told him to do to it.  Also Boba Fett shows up and is grumpy and we find out why Jaina was the sword of the Jedi.  That's where they were going with it.  I thought the Yuuzhan Vong arc was a really interesting way to go.  To roll it back to Jedi vs. Sith and the Empire all over again was not especially interesting to me.  I was kind of displeased to see all the goofy stuff they did to try to set up the future so they could have this comic book I also didn't care about.  I do not think there was a great understanding that the comic and novel star wars fans do have an overlap, but there are a lot of people who exclusively read one or the other."

StarWarsEU,3bojmp,kaitokid1985,9,Wed Jul 1 07:30:44 2015 UTC,"I think Zahn actually does a decent job of delving into specifics.  Admiral Ackbar for example. When Thrawn studies him, he isn't just studying Mon Cal artwork, he studies artwork Ackbar himself collects (and produces himself if I remember correctly. Maybe not). This in combination with operational intelligence can be a platform to make deductions as to the frame of mind Ackbar will be in in various situations, which he then projects onto finite and oft used fleet strategies and formations.  It is true that the first instance is pretty generalized, the one where he comes across a fleet commanded by a specific species that doesn't handle asymmetry very well and BAM, fleet is rekt. However, I think this scene serves as an introduction and we follow along with Pealleon as we actually learn the mechanics behind Thrawn's deductions, much like Watson follows Holmes around and learns how his brain works after one mind blowing deduction."
StarWarsEU,3bojmp,Mythosaurus,4,Wed Jul 1 15:34:02 2015 UTC,"I'm sure that if Thrawn's viewpoints were given, we would see a Grand Admiral constantly studying various cultures and battles fought by them. Grand Admirals project an aura of confidence, awe-inspiring brilliance, and a bit of fear to their subordinates, and we mostly see Thrawn through the eyes of Palleon.   Your reference to Holmes is quite applicable, and I wish I had made the connection sooner. Palleon becomes a great admiral in the future because of his tutelage under Thrawn, learning the strategies that the Grand Admiral hid behind a veil of 'art study and dreamy expressions'."
StarWarsEU,3bojmp,Ginkasa,25,Fri Jul 3 16:21:40 2015 UTC,"Its a little far fetched.  I think the idea, though, is that Thrawn gained an understanding of a species' underlying psychology through their art which allowed him insight into their strategic instincts.  I definitely think this talent was used way too specifically, though, and is one of those EU things that just don't hold up well after too much thought.  Personally, I think Zahn (and much of the rest of the EU, but perhaps following the trend set by Zahn) put too little diversity between members of the same alien species.  He seemed to think that each member of a species (or humans from certain planets) must be exactly like the one character from the movies from that species.  He carried that aspect to original aliens as well.  Its a little annoying and one of the worst aspects of his writing."
StarWarsEU,3bojmp,AUS_Doug,13,Wed Jul 1 02:02:04 2015 UTC,"I definitely think this talent was used way too specifically, though....   Are you referring to when he was discussing individual's like Ackbar and Bel Iblis?  If so, I can agree somewhat that it is a little far-fetched, but not by as much as people make out.  He wouldn't have based his assessments of individuals - especially figures like Ackbar and Bel Iblis - solely on their art (collected or created) but would take that into account with what he already knows.   Personally, I think Zahn.....put too little diversity between members of the same alien species.   While that is true to some extent, he certainly didn't apply that to the rest of the Chiss; While the rest of them are quite militarily minded, none operate at the same level that Thrawn did."
StarWarsEU,3bojmp,Ginkasa,9,Wed Jul 1 06:20:18 2015 UTC,"I was referring to how Thrawn would know the precise maneuver an enemy would make and precisely when they would make it based on a painting.  I think its reasonable to assume that Thrawn used additional sources for his insight, but the book portrays it as solely coming from art.  I also didn't intend that each member of species were carbon copies and certainly wasn't referring to Chiss specifically.  But Zahn does identify a species as having pretty specific characteristics.  Even character who are the sole representative of their species are defined as how their species is.  Almost every time Gavrisom shows up in the Hand of Thrawn duology someone has to comment how Gavrisom is just like every other Calibop in the galaxy.  It should have been that Gavrisom is Gavrisom and the other Calibops are... not to found in that particular novel is all. If that makes sense."
StarWarsEU,3bojmp,AUS_Doug,2,Wed Jul 1 07:25:54 2015 UTC,"OK, yep I get you, my bad."
StarWarsEU,3bojmp,AUS_Doug,16,Wed Jul 1 11:07:35 2015 UTC,"In a few instances, his ability to make these judgements is a bit over-powered and - like anything in Star Wars - can be picked apart if you want to, but it does have some merit I think.  For example, he talks, in The Last Command,with Pellaeon:   ""Until they were contacted by the Tenth Alderaanian Expedition, not a single one of the dozens of Mriss cultures had ever developed any form of three-dimensional artwork.""   He goes on to give his own reasons about why he thinks that is and, by deducing that the cause of such omission is innate to the species, he can feel assured in applying it to the species as a whole.  (My best guess is that they - owing to such a blind spot - would be perfect targets for the cloaked cruiser trick.)  In that instance he has something solid - the report by the Tenth Alderaanian Expedition - to go in regards to this trait.  Another good one to talk about - because it is not so clear-cut - comes from a conversation Thrawn later has with C'baoth:   “The people and leaders of Woostri, on the other hand, are a different matter entirely.   Like the Ukians, they have a strong fear of the unknown and what they perceive to be the impossible.   Equally important, they have a tendency to magnify rumors of menace far out of proportion.""   How he arrives at that conclusion - and how he then feels confident in applying it to the species as a whole - I can only begin to guess.  I get the feeling that a lot of people think Thrawn draws these conclusions solely from artwork........and I believe this to be a mistake.  I think, rather, that he draws just as much from standard intelligence reports and deductions; His opinion on a species psychology is used only in concert with standard information."
StarWarsEU,3bojmp,jandhyde,6,Wed Jul 1 06:39:09 2015 UTC,"I'm not gonna lie man, I'd rather just assume that they overplay the information he gets from art or rather the information he says he gets from artwork.  He's a military commander.  He's going to study things besides art.  He may just try to hide how much he gets from other sources.  He's going to be given briefs on species, he may just study the art and psychology behind it and apply it to the information given to him.  I dunno.  But it's fun to think about and I'm glad I'm not the only one that's thought about this particular topic."
StarWarsEU,3bojmp,Numerous1,2,Wed Jul 1 13:25:43 2015 UTC,"That is a VERY good point.  If you think about it, if you can understand a lot about studying the art (if you are smart enough etc.). Look at art that is popular, intense, aggressive, when they were made, everything.  I'm sure he studied EVERYTHING, but the art was the final bit that wrapped it all up and made him so crazy-good."

StarWarsEU,3bojmp,jethroboom,1 point,Wed Jul 1 14:19:48 2015 UTC,"One thing I've noticed and taken a little issue with (but you can't do anything about it without getting ridiculous) is the planets' (and sometimes systems') cultures vary as much as our world's countries.  It's not a hard and fast rule, obviously, but art styles vary in our world from country to country.  Scale that into the SWEU and you have more or less predominant, predictable styles that in Thrawn's seeming omniscience gives him insight to their psychology and behaviors."
StarWarsEU,3bojmp,antieverything,1 point,Wed Jul 1 12:25:16 2015 UTC,This sort of thing is pretty common in fantasy and sci-fi when an author is trying to write a character as a super genius when they themselves are obviously not a super genius. Given the narrative structure the only meaningful way to portray incredible intellect is to give the character some sort of knowledge to which only the author him/herself has access. Generally this is done by having the intelligent character see what will happen next in the story. The specific mechanism through which they acquire this knowledge is obviously a bit arbitrary since there's no way to detail the thought process of a character who is supposed to be far smarter than the author or the readers. This trope is probably most common in comic books with Brainiac and Lex Luthor being the perennial worst offenders.

Maybe this will help those that can't grasp the purge understand why it was necessary.  I don't want a new trilogy of movies that has to make sense of everything that happened in the EU.  It never even occurred to me as far as parallel timelines go, TFA occurs AFTER the empire became an old, tired story, and a new antagonist was introduced.    A new movie trilogy trying to incorporate EU would have been shit for everyone but the 0.1% that have read the entire series."

So is the new EU filling in the gap between the originals and sequels going to be tiring with the Empire still around for the whole thing?  By setting it so far in the future it does make for a lot of gap filling that has to make sense for the story of TFA.  Definitely easier than staying true to the entirety of the EU, but it won't be easy keeping the Empire as the enemy a fresh story."
StarWarsEU,3bm72k,jethroboom,1 point,Tue Jun 30 14:38:54 2015 UTC,"it won't be easy keeping the Empire as the enemy a fresh story.   That sort of thing never is (with any series or story).  I expect if we see a 4th Trilogy there will be a different antagonist.  That is to say, if we don't see a different form of the empire as one, or an entirely different one altogether in 8 or 9.  We can already see there is a different feeling to the Empire in the trailers, Phasma, no Emperor, etc.  At least it feels a bit different to me."
StarWarsEU,3bm72k,the_gv3,2,Tue Jun 30 14:44:31 2015 UTC,"I meant more in that there is now a lot of empty story line in between the original trilogy and the new trilogy, meaning that the Empire is around that entire time.  Keeping them fresh as the enemy will be difficult, whereas the original EU had new, fresh enemies at that point in the story line.  Granted, this Empire does seem to be different as you mentioned, so maybe that will be enough to keep it fresh."
StarWarsEU,3bm72k,Sapitoelgato,2,Wed Jul 1 01:10:07 2015 UTC,"Yeah, because of the canon purge, they are releasing multiple projects to fill in the gap, including a 3 book trilogy (well at least the first novel) before ...the new trilogy. As someone coming in after the purge, I bet it must suck to have those stories ripped away leaving only a broken shell of what you enjoyed about the franchise. I can only imagine I would feel cheated and abandoned. I am curious to see what Legends stories are still around in the future as newcomers absorb the canon materials."
StarWarsEU,3bm72k,jethroboom,3,Tue Jun 30 18:53:53 2015 UTC,"They're not ripped away.  They're part of a different universe.  They're still there, over 200 books and countless comics and other materials.  No more new stories, but everything comes to an end at some point, except maybe soap operas.  Who wants a shitty soap opera EU?"
StarWarsEU,3bm72k,PR-0927,2,Tue Jun 30 19:04:46 2015 UTC,"Many of us feel a kind of sadness at the replacement of the old EU, and generalized lack of interest in continuing to read a new EU that doesn't build upon what we've been reading for decades. It's to some degree an emotional issue, which I think is what many detractors don't understand. And our personal feelings aren't any less valid than everyone else's.   Hated the prequels or Jar Jar? Feel strongly that Han should have still shot first in the Special Editions? Think the Empire is cooler than the rebels? All of those are subjective emotional reactions, not level-headed, logical truths (however much we may want them to be)."
StarWarsEU,3bm72k,roninjedi,5,Wed Jul 1 08:05:32 2015 UTC,"That's...not true. Nearly every franchise that's gone to movies has a pretty extensive background that most fans don't follow. Sometimes publishers release ""primers"" that sum up events for the masses. Sometimes they don't. Those movies still do great. It was very easily doable for either a) a new story to be made that didn't contradict major EU (the galaxy is a huge place!) or b) a major EU story to be adopted that didn't require much background.  io9 had a great article about this, explaining how that justification makes little-to-no sense, especially since Disney is now busy re-populating the timeline with its own stories. Once that gets filled, what happens? Another wipe?  Moreover, don't underestimate The Thrawn Trilogy's popularity. I've been shocked to even hear casual fans knowing of it. A simple Google search of ""Episode 7 Thrawn"" nets you SO many results, articles, images, etc. No other EU story manages to have that perception at all.  Helps that The Thrawn Trilogy sold like 15 million copies (physical) in a relatively short lifespan and occupied the NYTimes Bestseller list for seemingly-forever (IIRC the first book sat there for 19 weeks). It's literally the series that revived a dying interest in Star Wars and acted as a litmus test for George Lucas to go ahead with the PT.  Anyway, the purge wasn't ""necessary."" It was done because from Disney's point of view, it was a lucrative business decision."
StarWarsEU,3bm72k,PR-0927,6,Tue Jun 30 15:50:07 2015 UTC,"I keep hearing Disney and others say that the Star Wars universe was messy and full of contradictions. And you know what that pisses me off so I want to talk about it and feel free to agree or yell at me and call me names if you disagree. Maybe it’s when I started reading, I didn’t start till around ’98 or ’99, or maybe it’s because I read a lot of the books like the manuals, atlas, or wookieepedia (people please start using this. It really can answer just about every question you have. Which as a side rant is something that annoys me, people ask questions then get them answered by others who have only seen the movies so are just guessing. Those answers get up voted while the right ones get sent to the trash compactor. Ok nerdy side rant over)  I know some books have small problems like how in the Thrawn books it makes it sound like the clone wars was a lot longer ago and was fought differently. But that’s because it was written before the prequils and it was written the way George said it was fought before he changed it in the movies. And I know that the Death Star book was a recon book clearing up how the plans could be stolen four times (the girl from the Han solo novels, Kyle Katarrn, and someone else all stole parts of the plan and the completed plan was what Leia was transporting.) and how it could be built in so many places. And other smaller stuff has changed or been finally explained like what a blaster bolt is (charged plasma in a magnetic shell)  But I still think it has a great easy to follow timeline that doesn’t contradict its self on what matters. Someone is not on two different planets in the same year. Heck in the front on the books it has the time line showing where all the books fall, and the comics are just as good at filling up the blank spaces in years. Really except for the whole clone wars thing or any new messes created by TCW I caint think of any contradictions where one book contradicts the others. I think for being written by multiple authors over multiple decades Star Wars has one of the best, cleanest, and easiest to follow timelines of any series.  Now im just argueing for being noncontradictiory and clean not if it would or would not be hard for someone new to come in from the movies and get confused at the reading. But while im on that idea I say screw it. First off that just seems like an excuse they want to use so they can create new characters and do what they want. They are just using the “Its contradictory/ hard to get into if you are new” excuse as a pass.  And what makes it even more annoying is that’s not really a problem. I mean look at marvel they aren’t changing everything so people won’t be confused by the comics if they start reading because of the movies. And those that do, who actually like it enough to start reading? What do they do? They ask people either friends or online where would be a good place to start or what arcs would be the best to read. And really I don’t see enough people going from the movies and buying books to make a difference.  Yes maby it used to be worse but now most things like Bobba Fett’s back story has been written about and cleared up by other books and comics so at this stage of the game things that were unclear earlier have all been cleared up so their should be no problem.  TLDR: Disney saying it does and would be hard to get into is just an excuse so they can have a blank check to add their own new characters to the series."
StarWarsEU,3bm72k,jethroboom,3,Tue Jun 30 21:15:30 2015 UTC,"Absolutely. The apologists have absolutely no legitimate excuses. This was nothing more than corporate greed. There were hardly any material contradictions - arguments saying otherwise are blatantly and completely incorrect. Minor inconsistencies don't matter, and can be hand-waved away.  What's more irritating is how literally all newer EU had recognized the older stories, George Lucas tapped into it for his PT, and TCW made a million references to so much EU - the Vong were set to appear. This was all the official, well-integrated storyline that Disney, newcomers, and apologists have shat on. They're so wrong, and they downvote/censor anything that proves this to be the case."
StarWarsEU,3bm72k,PR-0927,2,Tue Jun 30 21:39:28 2015 UTC,"Well, the new Lucasfilm actually cares more about maintaining continuity across mediums than George Lucas ever did, so I don't think it's all about Disney's greed. Lucas's legacy provided a strong precedent for extreme creative freedom in the making of the films, which there's obviously a lot of support for among fans other than us. If everyone who's obsessed with Star Wars in some way or another took a vote, I think the majority would support there being new movies that aren't restricted by past EU - however unfortunate that is for us EU fans."
StarWarsEU,3bm72k,yodamann,5,Wed Jul 1 07:58:21 2015 UTC,"I've read all 5 Thrawn books, they are far and above my favorites.  Here's the secret though, the EU is still there.  Mickey Mouse didn't break into our homes and steal our books, they still exist.  No, it is very unlikely there will be new stories with the Legends banner, but I think we have enough to leave that universe as it is.  We now have 1 more entire Star Wars universe than we used to, it'll be at least as good.  Nostalgia goggles and change are hard to overcome."
StarWarsEU,3bm72k,yodamann,6,Tue Jun 30 16:33:13 2015 UTC,"I can't disagree with you on the existence of the EU - you're right, it is still there and no one can take that away. I regard it as the true story of Star Wars, and always will.  What irritates me most though, is the lack of further materials in that universe. I wouldn't mind as much if that world had continued. But Disney basically said ""nope, fuck that shit, didn't happen, here's the story."" That really irks me. It's insulting and disrespectful, and I don't think I can ever get over that.  As for the Disney storyline - I guess I've never been a believer in ""multiple"" universes like how many comics have done. Just one consistent continuity is what I desire - but all the power to you if you can. If you're able to enjoy Disney Star Wars, I seek no interference with that.  Unfortunately for me, however, I believe I will be limited to consuming only new materials that don't materially contradict the EU (so likely none of the new movies)."
StarWarsEU,3bm72k,PR-0927,3,Tue Jun 30 16:40:54 2015 UTC,"I agree with you entirely. I get that having the new movies be consistent is a pipe dream, but if Disney is discounting the EU anyway, why bother with their own? Let the Publishing arm continue the real story, and then the movies can be their own thing for the masses. As for the new books/comics, I can't see myself buying them; I don't support Disney's decision to stop the EU, and so I cannot support the DisnEU financially."
StarWarsEU,3bm72k,jethroboom,3,Tue Jun 30 18:04:37 2015 UTC,"I'm mostly on your side, but in case you want to know the actual answer to ""why bother?"": The publishing arm is rather big money as well, and more because of the thousands and thousands of regular people picking up a book/comic here and there than because of our relatively small club of dedicated readers. (Think about how many EU superfans you've met, and whether they're anywhere near numerous enough to get books on the NYT bestsellers list.)  Plus, having all Star Wars books and comics be set in an alternate universe to the ongoing film series would be super confusing to newcomers. I'm not saying they should have rebooted it - I'd rather they didn't make the sequel movies, or kept them within the established continuity - but I don't think continuing Legends while the movies go a different direction is really a reasonable solution."
StarWarsEU,3bm72k,PR-0927,2,Wed Jul 1 07:53:22 2015 UTC,"I'd rather they didn't make the sequel movies   You would not believe the looks I get when I say this. People assume that I'll be super hyped because ""Man, Yodamann is sure big on Star Wars"" and then when I explain my reasons, I just get dismissed as ""Butthurt"" or told that I ""should try the new stuff, it might be better!""  As for feasibility, and confusing people, I don't know that it would. People aren't confused now, just look at all the article gleefully bashing the EU, their hatred now affirmed by Disney. They could still brand them ""Legends"" or whatever, just to show that they are separate. Or better yet, brand the new movies as ""infinities"""
StarWarsEU,3bm72k,yodamann,3,Wed Jul 1 15:05:28 2015 UTC,"Yeah, there's definitely a deficit of respect and understanding for our perspective. And anyway, it's not as if we chose to feel this way.

It annoys me more than it should, I know it's petty, but I can't begin to fathom how people can't compartmentalize that.  I'm enjoying both universes with no issues.  There are books I've yet to read in the EU, and when canon novels come out I take a break and read those.

StarWarsEU,3bm72k,paper-hanger,7,Tue Jun 30 19:03:15 2015 UTC,"No, I'll just ignore Disney's stuff. Not very confusing.  Maybe you can ""compartmentalize"" because you accept the existence of separate storylines. I (and many others) do not. Until Disney showed up, there was solely one unified story. The story. I don't want multiple storylines.  As for the consumption of materials - no I've not consumed it all, but I've consumed a lot. But some story arcs don't interest me as much - like the Old Republic stuff. I care for the post-RotJ stuff most. Moreover, this means no games or shows from that set of stories, not just no more books (which is egregious in and of itself)."

People can argue that we shouldn't feel the way we do, but there's no reason our ideas of what Star Wars are are any less valid than theirs. We have no choice but to watch their vision come true - they can at least respect us enough to allow us some sadness at the passing of ours."

In Legends, the Imperial Palace was a completely separate building that was built for Palpatine after the Galactic Empire came to power, but now in canon the Empire remodeled the Jedi Temple and turned that into the Imperial Palace. Also, in the Legends timeline the Rebels stayed on Yavin 4 for several months before evacuating, and in the canon Princess Leia comic the rebels start evacuating their base immediately after the end of A New Hope."
StarWarsEU,3bm72k,AthasDuneWalker,3,Tue Jun 30 17:43:12 2015 UTC,"The Imperial Palace has a bit of a confused history anyway, and I would say that contradiction is on the par of ones that happened accidentally within the Legends continuity anyway.

None of the Del Rey new canon novels drastically contradicts Legends as far as I know, and some even make a lot of references to Legends."

StarWarsEU,3bjf96,nickfel,1 point,Mon Jun 29 20:01:16 2015 UTC,It's really a shame they never focused on that era very much. Always seemed like the time around the Jedi Civil War and the First Jedi Purge were rife with story possibilities. At least one novel's worth.

StarWarsEU,3beno5,jackgibson12,4,Sun Jun 28 15:02:47 2015 UTC,"I've liked what I've read so far.  I'd be lying if I said any were as good as even the better EU books, but these new ones don't have the benefit of decades of prior work to draw from.   A New Dawn was a really fun adventure.  It establishes the empire as an adversary based on today's standards.  Force is only one tool of the imperial war machine.  NSA level espionage coupled with forced disappearances and reeducation are a primary weapon.  The empire is no longer the all british white male frat house it once was and is more diverse. I doubt we'll see any non-human officers, but female captains and admirals are not umcommon. The story features the first meeting of Kanan and Hera from the Rebels tv show.  Kanan is just the right amount of snark, heart, douche that you'd expect and the story hints at the beginnings of rebellion in the galaxy.  I highly recommend it, particularly the audiobook. Tarkin is arguably the best written story of the the new canon though some consider it a hard read.  Seeing the events that shaped Tarkin into the man he became is quite interesting as is his relationship with Vader.  I notice it is subtle to some who've read it, but Tarkin interferes in one way or another whenever Vader attempts to murderfy an Imperial who ""fails"" him.  The story establishes Tarkin as the ""third pillar"" that holds up the Empire and why Vader respects him.  Tarkin is also aware of who Vader and the Emperor really are. Heir to the Jedi is 5 really fun interesting adventures.  It would have been a fantastic comic series, but as a book it feels disjointed.  The best part is that you see how Luke first steps into the world of the Force without any real guidance.  People complain about it being first-person but that is just trivial nit-picking and not one of the books many problems.  I recommend the audiobook if you can find it on the high sees or are just a real big Star Wars fan. Lords of the Sith is probably my favorite, but that may be because it is most fresh in my mind.  It takes place earliest in the timeline.  Vader and Palpatine have a roadtrip to the Ryloth while they are being pursued by Hera's freedom fighting father.  I thought the book was very good, but the end feels a bit sudden."
StarWarsEU,3beno5,BridgetheDivide,2,Sun Jun 28 21:48:31 2015 UTC,I remember someone comparing the plot of Heir to a series of fetch quests you would get playing an RPG. Which i think is kind of fitting and makes sense.

StarWarsEU,3beno5,solusvod,7,Sat Jul 4 05:06:13 2015 UTC,"I'm liking it so far. None of the books have been spectacular, but they've all been decent I think. I feel like the slight dip in quality is only because they're doing a bunch of stand a lone books at the moment, all set before RotJ. So while the content is new, it's all in a time period of the Galaxy that we've seen a billion times. I think once the new canon gets into post-RotJ territory it will start to pick up. The first book that will be doing that is Aftermath, which takes place right after the battle of Endor and is the first book in a trilogy. Comes out in September.   The only trouble you might have with the new canon is letting go of post rotj stories, like thrawn/NJO etc. I know I have had some trouble, as I really liked the NJO series and its characters. I've just got faith that the new EU is going to be full of just as much great content. And they seem to be going hard out as well, in the last year alone they've released like 5 new books with even more to come (one in like just over a week). Plus they've got new comics and tv series."
StarWarsEU,3beno5,usernameshmoosername,1 point,Sun Jun 28 15:41:31 2015 UTC,The NJO period was always my favorite period. Which means i was always sad when most games and tv focused on clone wars or old republic.

StarWarsEU,3beno5,MasterMac94,2,Sun Jun 28 22:38:10 2015 UTC,I really like the new books.  They are not softened up by Disney as far as I can tell (there was some concern about that).   I think the main reason for the reset is just that it was becoming too difficult for writers not to contradict other aspects of cannon.  There were something like 350 books out prior to the reset.  I don't see how anyone could write anything with existing characters and the existing time line without contradicting something else.    I've read 3 or 4 so far and they seem to be very much in the same vein as the old stuff.  Kenobi and new dawn are really good.
StarWarsEU,3beno5,expostfacto-saurus,5,Sun Jun 28 17:33:16 2015 UTC,Kenobi is legends.
StarWarsEU,3beno5,Maddukks,4,Sun Jun 28 17:35:58 2015 UTC,You'Re right.  Sorry about that.  Tarkin is also very well done though.
StarWarsEU,3beno5,expostfacto-saurus,3,Sun Jun 28 17:40:34 2015 UTC,"The old EU crew did a remarkably good job of not having stuff contradict one another. I believe the largest contradictions came from the clone wars, which was up for debate on canon at the time. I can't really even think of any major discrepancies."
StarWarsEU,3beno5,Ass_Masster,1 point,Sun Jun 28 21:23:47 2015 UTC,"They really did.  But as more and more stuff came out, they were more and more roped into the grand narrative.  I would be really interested to see the instructions/draft requirements for a Star Wars author that was writing toward the end of that stuff.  Wasn't the Clone Wars issue what ultimately lead to Karen Traviss leaving?  From the little I heard about it, she was writing a book and the cannon folks kept changing up stuff on her.  I think that was going on with the Clone Wars tv show though.    I think we're going to see some really cool stuff since they aren't hamstrung by having to stick the the massive amounts of cannon anymore."
StarWarsEU,3beno5,expostfacto-saurus,3,Sun Jun 28 21:40:11 2015 UTC,"Of all the EU I've read I've only come across Karen Traviss a few times. I think her biggest discrepancy was she said there was something like 200,000 clones in the galaxy when realistically there were millions. I think a decent amount can be found on her wookieepedia article.   Several of Karen Traviss' works have stirred considerable controversy, namely, the ""3 Million Clones"" debate. Books by her give the Grand Army of the Republic's numbers at 3 million clones; this was seen as both impossibly low to protect the Republic's membership of just under 1.3 million planets (meaning 2.3 clones per planet) as well as less than the hundred million men required to fight World War II on a single planet (16 million used by the United States of America alone). These debates broke out between Karen Traviss (sometimes alongside fellow Fandalorians) and the opposed fans she often referred to as ""Talifans."" The debates were usually held on online forums, eventually including StarWars.com."

StarWarsEU,3beno5,Vratix,3,Mon Jun 29 03:04:34 2015 UTC,"I think Vergere was one of the more interesting characters to ever exist, she didn't contradict any old EU by any means as far as I can remember."
StarWarsEU,3beno5,Ass_Masster,3,Mon Jun 29 03:41:17 2015 UTC,I believe he/she is referring more to the fact that Vergere changes from a fairly morally gray character who doesn't abide by the light/dark dichotomy in one series (NJO) to a Sith apprentice that was manipulating things for some higher dark side purpose in another (LOTF). A lot of people took issue with that transformation because it retroactively changes a lot of Vergere's characterization/

Tarkin was ok - listen to the audiobook, the written word is too hard to deal with - you're going to get bored fast.  As audiobook, it was pretty ok.

But I really loved how so many familure places, ships, and groups were named in the show. I mean SW has such a wide, deep, and rich history I am glad to see it being carried forward instead of it all being scrapped.  One other thing it did was kind of make me more of a fan of the emprie. I mean this new empire seems really good and the so called rebels sounded like they were crazy extremists and in the wrong. Also talking about Heir to the jedi for a minuite was anyone else sad that the B-wing is now a regular ship and not something that was made by Ackbar?  Acctually even New Dawn which i liked made the empire seem so much nicer that if i didn't know palps was an evil sith i would question the rebellion. They are no longer male only, xenophobic, or to bad at all. But new dawn was good and Heir was good."

As far as the novels, they ranged from good (Lords of the Sith) to ""Meh"" (Heir, New Dawn), but nothing incredible yet. But then again, the original EU took 13 years to finally take off and become big, so I'd say the new canon is already lightyears ahead of where the original EU was at that same stage of its existence.  I'd say where the new canon really shines is in the comics. I've been following all the series released thus far, and NOT ONCE have I been disappointed. Each series has been hitting it out of the park consistently. My current favorites are Vader and Kanan. If you don't read or watch anything else in the new canon, I recommend the comics at the very least."

I should add I'm probably way too picky with sci-fi - I think everything Zahn has done is pure magic, the Bane trilogy was decent, the A.C.

It's so awful that pretty much every EU author afterward tried to not acknowledge the events that occur in that novel - Zahn, Allston, Luceno, etc.  I think it's right up there with Splinter of the Mind's Eye in what the continuity of the original EU kind of retconned as ""un-canon.""

Official guides and whatnot include EVERYTHING, including in-universe nullifications (reborn Emperor, clone Luke, Splinter of the Mind's Eye, etc.).

As far as I'm concerned, being in the official source materials and forbidden for authors to directly contradict makes them an understood part of the continuity. But I can see how it could have looked a little different from the perspective of people who only read the novels.  Reborn Emperor and clone Luke were very heavily referenced in the novels though. Not sure why you'd think those were an example of something that was ""nullified""."
StarWarsEU,3bbpeq,Evzob,1 point,Tue Jun 30 21:34:38 2015 UTC,"There were different grades of canon, and all would have been included in the sourcebooks. Those are more like encyclopedias than continuity lines. The comics were widely considered by both fans and authors as a lower grade of canon from the novels.  Moreoever, Zahn himself, among others literally wrote something along the lines of ""yeah that stuff about the clone Emperor was just rumors"" in novels. Leland Chee helped direct this, and pretty much all later continuity retconned that away as having never happened. The Jedi Academy Trilogy was one of the few series that did recognize it."
StarWarsEU,3bbpeq,PR-0927,2,Tue Jun 30 21:53:40 2015 UTC,"I think you've misunderstood the ""grades of canon"". In Leland's Holocron, all the Bantam/Del Rey novels and all the Dark Horse comics (except for ""Infinities"") were in the same grade of canon. Some authors and readers of the prose novels look down upon all comics, but that was absolutely not the policy of Leland or anyone else in charge of continuity, and has always seemed incredibly snobby to me. This is again you (and, I grant, quite a few others) imposing your own interpretation upon the EU.  You should know that there are A LOT of us out there who enjoyed and respected the comics just as much as the prose novels. In fact, there were many comics that were considerably better than many of the prose novels, and they got better and better, with almost none of them having goofy premises like Dark Empire (which was actually an impressive work of art, even though I don't like where it took the continuity)."
StarWarsEU,3bbpeq,Evzob,2,Wed Jul 1 08:21:52 2015 UTC,"Zahn's writing off of the clone Emperor only went as far as Mara expressing her disbelief (other characters didn't call them rumors to my knowledge), and he did that despite the editorial team, not in cooperation with them (and I don't think Leland was working there yet when Vision of the Future was written anyway). Leland always considered Dark Empire ""C Canon"", the same as the prose novels. Zahn, on the other hand, is a bit of a maverick who clashed with the editors regarding how much he owned the characters and continuity. Mara's personal doubt was likely the maximum ""hand-waving"" that the authors would allow through."
StarWarsEU,3bbpeq,Evzob,1 point,Wed Jul 1 08:25:52 2015 UTC,"dark side Luke, clone Emperor, etc   Those at least got a nod every now and then. World Devastators, Galaxy Gun, and other assorted OP superweapon asspulls? Can't recall hearing even a peep about those."
StarWarsEU,3bbpeq,ricree,0,Sun Jul 5 08:27:44 2015 UTC,"It was still considered part of the EU continuity on the same level as all the other books - authors just weren't interested in making a lot of references to it. There were some though. Mentions of when the Solo kids had been kidnapped, etc."
StarWarsEU,3bbpeq,Evzob,2,Tue Jun 30 09:58:30 2015 UTC,"I kind of responded to this in your other comment. Official guides and whatnot included everything. But the story continuity did not, and that's critical. The authors basically decided to kill of the lunatic stories in their own novels, referring to that stuff as ""rumors"" or just plain ignoring such events. Leland Chee was a facilitator in this, thankfully.  Solo kids had many kidnapping attempts and semi-successes - from Thrawn's to those in The Jedi Academy Trilogy."
StarWarsEU,3bbpeq,PR-0927,1 point,Tue Jun 30 16:00:08 2015 UTC,"But there were more specific references to the episode in Crystal Star. And there were other references too. For example, in James Luceno's Millennium Falcon novel, there's a Firrerreo character who credits Leia with having helped save her people.   I don't recall many cases of authors writing things off as ""rumors"". It sounds more to me like you're the one who wrote these things off as non-continuity in your own mind. Which is perfectly fine! Just not an objective truth that we all share."
StarWarsEU,3bbpeq,Evzob,1 point,Tue Jun 30 21:39:51 2015 UTC,Plenty of characters from the dumber materials were adopted into other novels. And allusions to a few events within those materials. But a lot was kind of reverse-adverse-possession removed.  I didn't write-off anything. It happened in several novels. Zahn was the one leading the charge. Vision of the Future was the first book to nullify the reborn Emperor stuff.  Getting a bit ping-pongy here from going between your two comments. :P
StarWarsEU,3bbpeq,PR-0927,2,Tue Jun 30 21:56:59 2015 UTC,"I remember Zahn's playing down of the reborn Emperor in Vision of the Future. That's the one good example I remember too. But it was a little on the watered-down side, and IMO far outweighed by robust acknowledgments of Dark Empire in other books such as the Jedi Academy Trilogy (not that there isn't part of me that cheered Zahn on, and even now sees the erasure of Dark Empire as a silver lining to the EU reboot).  Sorry about the ping-pong (which is probably now five times worse after all my comments in the other thread). :-p I think my personality is overly linear: every point needs a direct response, in the order I see it. :-)"
StarWarsEU,3bbpeq,Evzob,2,Wed Jul 1 08:11:33 2015 UTC,"Oh dear lord the ping-ponging and multiple responses to the same comments. D: Oh well, LOL. I'll just respond here.  A while back I remember reading some interview(s) or something of the sort where several major authors discussed ignoring/in-universe retconning as false the clone Emperor/dark side Luke stuff. Zahn was joined in by I think Stackpole and a few other heavy-hitters. He certainly was not alone in expressing his disdain for that entire saga. I think a few authors wanted to acknowledge the Dark Empire, but without legitimizing the clone Emperor/dark side Luke (meaning, having some other warlord/dark side user at the helm). Vision of the Future wasn't the only novel to directly state something - blanking on the others, but I remember being both pleased and surprised upon seeing it. Lot of blatant ignoring of events in Dark Empire as well (that would have been mentioned/referenced otherwise).  I think it's a big part of the reason none of that stuff was referenced/built-up in the PT-era (and pre-ANH-era) novels that came out more recently."
StarWarsEU,3bbpeq,PR-0927,2,Wed Jul 1 15:54:15 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I can definitely see the Bantam authors feeling like it was inconsistent with the world they'd been tasked to build, and it doesn't surprise me that Stackpole (Zahn's closest collaborator in Star Wars storytelling) would have felt that way too. But the EU was a lot bigger than just the Bantam/Del Rey novels."
StarWarsEU,3bbpeq,Evzob,14,Thu Jul 2 08:26:52 2015 UTC,I agree. Luke was also portrayed as kindof a bumbling Jedi who didn't really seem to know what was going on most of the time. Definitely didn't correctly capture the personalities of the characters.
StarWarsEU,3bbpeq,Vlinux,7,Sat Jun 27 18:51:16 2015 UTC,"I feel like Mcintyre was of the ""Han is awesome, Luke is whiny"" camp. She did not seem to have a great deal of respect for Luke as a character and it shows. This was also one of the earliest novels in the EU. 1994 was still the early days and looking back it seems like  things definitely went a little off the rails that year.  I get that Luke does not fulfill all of the romantic fantasies for a main character. He doesn't get all of the cool lines. He's loyal rather than rebellious. He's self-sacrificing and stoic. He's a man on a journey of discovery burdened by his responsibilities but still the hopeful farmboy at heart.   Not a lot of writers really got Luke. I would say Tyers in TaB, Zahn, and Hambly were the best at understanding what drives post RotJ Luke. Hambly was almost in the other direction in that Han takes a back seat in her novels, but at least not to his detriment."
StarWarsEU,3bbpeq,countjared,3,Sat Jun 27 21:34:01 2015 UTC,What do you think were Luke's best stories in the EU?
StarWarsEU,3bbpeq,Sapitoelgato,2,Sat Jun 27 23:07:08 2015 UTC,"Hes in so much haha i cant remember it all :( I will say I thought he was well written imo in LotF and FotJ (my favourite writers, Karen Traviss and Aaron Allston)"
StarWarsEU,3bbpeq,solusvod,6,Sat Jul 4 05:22:20 2015 UTC,"It was written on crack. There thats all of it. I mean Han and Luke are so out of character its not funny. Ohh there is also a gay joke in there about han wanting to see lukes lightsaber. Waru is weird and kind of random. I did enjoy most of Jania and Jacens adventure but there was a wearwolf, centaur, and another alien on a huge artificail planet that palps apparently build."
StarWarsEU,3bbpeq,roninjedi,3,Sat Jun 27 21:56:26 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah the centaur and werewolf were so weird, especially because the werewolf basically evolved  into a child. The artificial planet was also one of the strangest things ever."
StarWarsEU,3bbpeq,hnrbledischarge,3,Sat Jun 27 22:02:17 2015 UTC,Essentially all the bad elements of fantasy on FF.net before FF.net existed.
StarWarsEU,3bbpeq,Khanstant,3,Sat Jun 27 22:27:16 2015 UTC,"Ok, I just browsed this out of curiosity and now I'm just confused. I mean, with everything else in the galaxy, I suppose werewolves and centaurs aren't out of the question, but really, were they just like straight up magical fantasy creatures?  Edit: Just caught the evolving into a child thing. What the hell, sounds like Pratchett's sci-fi novels now."
StarWarsEU,3bbpeq,Khanstant,2,Sun Jun 28 06:40:23 2015 UTC,"Yeah the centaur was like a legit mythological creature. The werewolf was a six-legged dog called a ""wyrwulf"" which apparently was the larvae of a four-armed species which practiced kidnapping for fun. The whole story is insane lol"
StarWarsEU,3bbpeq,Sapitoelgato,2,Sun Jun 28 07:03:41 2015 UTC,Incredible
StarWarsEU,3bbpeq,thebardingreen,4,Sun Jun 28 07:12:45 2015 UTC,"I hear that, but i haven't read it. I also hear Red Harvest is one of the worst as well. What were the weirdest moments?"
StarWarsEU,3bbpeq,PM_ME_YOUR_ALUMINUM,4,Sat Jun 27 18:19:36 2015 UTC,The weirder moments were when Luke was tempted to jump into the lump of golden scales and meet that was Waru in order to gain power. Or when Luke accuses Han of cheating on Leia and then runs away. But there are plenty of other moments
StarWarsEU,3bbpeq,jinnetics,4,Sat Jun 27 19:59:48 2015 UTC,You reread it? That's hardcore.
StarWarsEU,3bbpeq,Sanguiluna,2,Sun Jun 28 04:53:02 2015 UTC,Yeah I am reading the entire post-RotJ EU so I had to read it again. It ties with Children of the Jedi for the worst book haha
StarWarsEU,3bbz02,Sapitoelgato,11,Sat Jun 27 19:37:35 2015 UTC,I was always a fan of Shadows of the Empire. It is set in between ESB and ROTJ and shows a decent amount of development of Luke and his growing skills. Also showed him building his green saber too.
StarWarsEU,3bbz02,rumsmugglerwb,5,Sat Jun 27 20:02:24 2015 UTC,...also bad ass game on the n64.
StarWarsEU,3bbz02,o0cynix0o,2,Sat Jun 27 21:05:57 2015 UTC,"Two questions: does the game hold up? And between the books and the comics, which should I read?"
StarWarsEU,3bbz02,GeorgeEBHastings,2,Tue Jun 30 02:48:18 2015 UTC,For me personally I'd say the game holds up fine. I enjoy playing it. As for the book or the comics...I've only read the book. I'd go that route first then read the comics.
StarWarsEU,3bbz02,o0cynix0o,1 point,Wed Jul 1 16:21:49 2015 UTC,"All three tell the same story from different points of view. I think the comic is more Boba Fett's, Luke's is the book, and Dash Rendar's is the game. I could be wrong."
StarWarsEU,3bbz02,PM_ME_YOUR_ALUMINUM,7,Thu Jul 2 01:03:47 2015 UTC,"Okay so, I think the most obvious choices are Specter of the Past/Vision of the Future.  Other than those, I personally enjoy Children of the Jedi/Planet of Twilight. I know they're maybe pushing the limits of believability with the Callista stuff, but they stand out to me as having some really excellent Luke passages."
StarWarsEU,3bbz02,endlessmeow,5,Sat Jun 27 23:39:57 2015 UTC,Luke Skywalker and the Shadows of Mindor is an excellent book.  Matt Stover is a great author in general but he did a great job with Luke in this book.
StarWarsEU,3bbz02,Evzob,2,Mon Jun 29 17:52:26 2015 UTC,"This is a favorite of mine too. An unusual book, but in a good way."
StarWarsEU,3bbz02,Ass_Masster,4,Tue Jun 30 10:03:30 2015 UTC,"Heir to the Jedi is not all that great in my opinion. Its very odd reading a 1st person star wars novel, and i'm not finished with it yet but i'm not on the edge of seat waiting for the ending. Its one of the first 'new cannon' novels between episode 4 and 5 but i'm not really enjoying where its going."
StarWarsEU,3bbz02,SexualPie,1 point,Sat Jun 27 20:34:06 2015 UTC,"I can understand your frustration. I enjoyed the novel as a character piece of Luke's transition from being a farm boy to joining the rebellion, but lacking so much experience as he adjusts to his new life. At times the story can get really silly, but I found it fun."
StarWarsEU,3bbz02,XAce90,2,Sat Jun 27 23:04:02 2015 UTC,"to be honest, almost all of them do.   you said all novels are fair game, but do you care about what point in the story, like 5, 10, 20 years in the future?  you dont care about legends vs new eu?"
StarWarsEU,3bbz02,MasterMac94,2,Sun Jun 28 03:03:21 2015 UTC,"All stories are fair game. Any Canon and Legends novel (and junior novel if applicable). I am looking, for the best stories that consist of his character, and how well the author wrote him. It's all opinion based. I am curious of reading more on his character outside the movies."
StarWarsEU,3bbz02,MasterMac94,1 point,Sun Jun 28 04:25:48 2015 UTC,"I am really fond of Heir to the Jedi. It's definitely my favorite book so far in the new canon and the ending -- to me, at least -- was very powerful. Sure, the book itself is not on par with some of the older canon, but for a Luke story that fills in his missing force training before Episode 5, you cannot go wrong with it."
StarWarsEU,3bbqpw,Darklots1,2,Sat Jun 27 18:24:28 2015 UTC,"Skip The Jedi Academy Trilogy. KJA is really not a great author, and the Sun Crusher is the silliest thing. At most, just read up on the events on Wookieepedia to gain familiarity with introduced characters.  Actually, read I, Jedi instead. Covers enough of what happened during that trilogy, but is written very well (also yay Corran Horn!).  Also, definitely read Outbound Flight. Anything by Zahn, really. I'd Say Zahn, Reaves, Stackpole, and Stover are among the best authors. Luceno is hit-or-miss - some amazing books, and some mediocre ones. I've enjoyed Allston, but I don't know what the common perception was for him. And controversial, but I did enjoy Traviss's books too. She's not the best at math, but that can be overlooked. xD"
StarWarsEU,3bbqpw,PR-0927,3,Sat Jun 27 20:44:55 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the advice. I think I'll start with Outbound Flight first and then move onto the X-wing series. I'll check out I, Jedi too after Isard's Revenge (trying to stick by the timeline a little, even if it doesn't matter)."
StarWarsEU,3bbqpw,PR-0927,1 point,Sun Jun 28 01:54:23 2015 UTC,"Happy to advise! Outbound Flight for some reason holds a special place in my heart - I might be willing to say it's my single favorite SW book. I'm a little obsessed with Thrawn/the Chiss though, so that might be why, hahaha.  I'm embarrassed to say I've never read the X-Wing series - definitely something I'll remedy someday soon."
StarWarsEU,3bbqpw,Sapitoelgato,3,Sun Jun 28 02:37:14 2015 UTC,Yeah I absolutely loved the Thrawn trilogy and am looking forward to learning more about his backstory and about C'boath as well.
StarWarsEU,3bbqpw,hnrbledischarge,3,Sun Jun 28 02:41:46 2015 UTC,"Definitely check out the X-Wing series. I have yet to hear anything negative about them, and a lot of mixed feelings about the other."
StarWarsEU,3bbqpw,Stinkpickle1971,3,Sat Jun 27 19:16:20 2015 UTC,"Read the Hand of Thrawn duology while stuff from the Thrawn trilogy is still fresh. You can't beat Zahn, especially in terms of expanding existing character development.  I think you should give Tatooine Ghost a shot as well, especially if you don't want to get too caught up in the precise chronology of how things roll in the post-ROTJ verse. Denning's writing can be lukewarm, but it's an overall decent standalone and a good breather between a lot of the heavier material. Complete with silly disguises, no less."
StarWarsEU,3bbqpw,Sapitoelgato,3,Sat Jun 27 22:26:41 2015 UTC,Republic Commando series by Karen Travis was very good. It shows a whole different view of the Clone Wars.
StarWarsEU,3bbqpw,RANewton,3,Sat Jun 27 19:32:05 2015 UTC,"And different view for sure! Not that that is bad. I hear great things about it. Too bad, she threw in the towel, before finishing it."
StarWarsEU,3bbqpw,Stinkpickle1971,5,Sat Jun 27 19:34:50 2015 UTC,To be fair TCW TV show basically rewrote most of the backstory for her novels. I agree it's a shame she didn't finish them but I don't blame her
StarWarsEU,3bbqpw,Lanuria,4,Sat Jun 27 22:20:38 2015 UTC,"From what I understand,  she didn't finish the series because LucasArts bailed out on her contract."
StarWarsEU,3bbqpw,Stinkpickle1971,1 point,Sun Jun 28 00:27:13 2015 UTC,"But if you like Jedi at all, you'll be a bit angry.   Traviss hates jedi and from what I've heard and read, it comes through in her writing."
StarWarsEU,3b72d4,VirtualMachine0,7,Fri Jun 26 14:23:41 2015 UTC,"I enjoyed Apocalypse for the most part.  Jaina was at her ass-kicking best (that opening Skirmish in the Temple was awesome) and the God-mode Luke in this book was the best he'd been all series.  The Tahiri and Fett dynamic was good fun, and their fight with Abeloth was cool.  Vestara as a character stole the show again; Yes she fucked up (again), and it was reaffirmed that she would never have what it takes to become a Jedi, but it was clear that she still loved Ben and her realising how bad she'd fucked up was handled well.   was done well, even if it was unnecessary.  And it was the beginning of Tahiri's road to redemption.    Crucible though is a bit of a let-down....sort of.  On its own merits, it isn't a great book. (I'll place it on par with Darksaber; Not brain-meltingly bad, but I'm not going to read it again for the sake of something to do.)  But all its faults are magnified by the knowledge that it is the end.  Followed by a well written Sword of The Jedi Trilogy - and, despite Golden's shaky start, she can write; Her development of Ves was better than the other authors in FOTJ - Crucible would have been nothing more than another book to join the ranks of those that can be ignored.  But it is the last Legends novel that we are likely to get - barring the oft hypothesised continuation in a decades time - and, for that reason, it will be remembered, and remembered poorly.  It surely marked the last time that Luke and Leia would save the day, and therefore it marked the true passing of the torch to Jaina's generation.  Having said that, I recommend you read it.  For all its faults, it does do some things well; Vestara is as well written as ever - even if there is decidedly less evolution on her part than in FOTJ - and there is a nice dynamic between Ben and Tahiri going on.  EDIT: Typo; 'Hypothesised' not 'Hypothesises'."
StarWarsEU,3b72d4,AUS_Doug,4,Sat Jun 27 02:42:06 2015 UTC,"Jaina was such a badass. And Luke stood mostly toe-to-toe with Force Cthulhu. My biggest gripe was that it was written as if you might forget what happened from chapter to chapter, as if I would suddenly spaz out and forget what Thuruht had revealed. But, we got more Galaxy Far Far Away Lore, which was nice, and the action was intense. I think it was the most visceral SWEU book I've ever touched.    Your comment does help to rebalance my assessment, though. I think I will read Crucible, when I'm ready, and try not to think of it as the end, or at least in the context of an epilogue."
StarWarsEU,3b72d4,roninjedi,2,Sat Jun 27 02:54:53 2015 UTC,"I was looking forward to Ves being Ben's catwoman or Mara Jade. You know, the two of them ruining each others plans before she eventualy turns to the light and they end up together."

StarWarsEU,3b72d4,roninjedi,2,Wed Jul 1 01:11:49 2015 UTC,Yeah well luckily the sw universe is one with happy endings and redemption arcs and not space GoT. Though anything to see Luke or jaina kick ass.

The title of the episode, ""Idiot's Array,"" is a reference to the sabacc hand Lando first pulls off in Lando Calrissian and the Mindharp of Sharu. He also pulls it off in the episode to win a game against Zeb."
StarWarsEU,3b4a6d,bidoof_king,3,Thu Jun 25 22:57:09 2015 UTC,Isn't that also the name of the winning hand that Han won the Falcon with?
StarWarsEU,3b4a6d,outbound_flight,3,Fri Jun 26 05:07:01 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure myself, but it could've been. According to Wookieepedia, it's been used quite a bit throughout the EU, with Mindharp of Sharu being the first."
StarWarsEU,3b4a6d,HuntedGopher,3,Fri Jun 26 06:41:34 2015 UTC,The plagueis references you are thinking of are in Tarkin.
StarWarsEU,3b4a6d,Sanguiluna,2,Fri Jun 26 12:57:18 2015 UTC,Thanks!
StarWarsEU,3b0xl8,tilb40,24,Thu Jun 25 02:11:25 2015 UTC,"Labrynth of Evil gives the background of this. Basically Mace Windu was very close to discovering Sidious's identity as Palpatine, so Palpatine accelerated the invasion to escape from a very tight spot by getting himself kidnapped by Grievous.   So short answer: no."
StarWarsEU,3b0xl8,faculties-intact,7,Thu Jun 25 02:41:44 2015 UTC,"Grievous was always under the command of Dooku, right? So Palps just calls up Dooku and tells him to stage the kidnapping."
StarWarsEU,3b0xl8,t30ne,5,Thu Jun 25 05:48:03 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure.  We see Grievous talking directly to Sidious, so we know he was aware of him.  I'm guessing Grievous took orders from either."
StarWarsEU,3b0xl8,BabyBack_Dragon_Ribs,1 point,Thu Jun 25 12:45:35 2015 UTC,"I am not sure that is the case.  When Grievous kidnaps Palpatine, he doesn't actually know that Palpatine is Sidious.  He does take orders from Sidious for sure, but at the moment of abduction Grievous doesn't actually know he is dealing with Sidious."
StarWarsEU,3b0xl8,SophieTheCat,2,Fri Jun 26 23:35:55 2015 UTC,"I guess they're lucky Grevious didn't just kill Palpatine/Sidious. Even if he was under orders not to, he is such a loose cannon."
StarWarsEU,3b0xl8,Please_PM_me_Uranus,2,Sun Jun 28 01:21:51 2015 UTC,I think if Grevious tried to kill Palpatine he would've been sorely surprised and probably turned into a dead hunk of metal.
StarWarsEU,3b0xl8,sir_writer,1 point,Mon Jun 29 17:21:56 2015 UTC,"In the book that chronicles the actual abduction (can't remember the name now), Grievous has this inner monologue of sorts where he remarks that he seems to be doing whatever Palpatine tells him to.  I am assuming Palpatine is controlling him via the Force.  There was never any danger to Palpatine."
StarWarsEU,3b0xl8,SophieTheCat,1 point,Sun Jun 28 02:32:53 2015 UTC,That would have been awfully ironic- though I doubt that Palpatine would let himself get killed.
StarWarsEU,3b0xl8,dbutlerjr,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:30:41 2015 UTC,Really? How did Mace Windu get so close (I've never read Labrynth of Evil sorry.)
StarWarsEU,3b0xl8,Please_PM_me_Uranus,2,Sun Jun 28 01:20:46 2015 UTC,"It's been years years since I read it, but he and a republic intelligence agent are tracking down some series of clues leading to Sidious's identity. They learn he's part of Palpatine's closest inner circle and track him to the run down district of Coruscant where we see Dooku meet Sidious at the end of episode 2 (it has some special name, like the foundry or stacks or something? I forget). They eventually track him to an apartment or something, but then the invasion happens so Mace goes to deal with that. Intelligence guy breaks into the apartment, realizes Sidious is Palpatine, and is promptly killed."
StarWarsEU,3b0xl8,faculties-intact,6,Tue Jun 30 01:14:47 2015 UTC,"In Legends material they emphasize that Grevious knows Sidious, but thinks Palpatine is a different person. Most commands come from Dooku to Grevious."
StarWarsEU,3b0xl8,Sapitoelgato,1 point,Thu Jun 25 12:56:47 2015 UTC,"At that point, Dooku is still the leader of the Separatists, and Grievous answers to him. Sidious commanded Dooku to kidnap him (as Palpatine, obviously) and Dooku ordered Grievous to do it.  EDIT: Autocorrect's a cruel bitch."
StarWarsEU,3b0xl8,Fenris447,3,Thu Jun 25 13:02:08 2015 UTC,Sirius Black is Palpatine?!?!? Holy shit!!!!! #mindblown

StarWarsEU,3awqxt,AevnNoram,1 point,Wed Jun 24 06:40:13 2015 UTC,Definitely sounds like it to me. It's available on Amazon here

StarWarsEU,3awqxt,dannyisyoda,1 point,Wed Jun 24 15:32:15 2015 UTC,Thank you so much! <3
StarWarsEU,3av7vv,jasap1029,13,Tue Jun 23 19:45:14 2015 UTC,"I would probably suggest reading Heir to the Empire before you read Outbound Flight, I think the Thrawn back-story is more interesting once you've met the character in his trilogy.  Overall you've chosen a very solid list of books, and of them are excellent in my opinion."
StarWarsEU,3av7vv,zaxa13,4,Tue Jun 23 20:30:29 2015 UTC,Awesome! Should I read the whole Thrawn Trilogy before Outbound Flight or will the first one do well enough?
StarWarsEU,3av7vv,zaxa13,5,Tue Jun 23 20:41:01 2015 UTC,"I'd probably read the set, it's so good that it seems a shame to me to split it up."
StarWarsEU,3av7vv,the_gv3,2,Tue Jun 23 20:52:50 2015 UTC,Well that makes sense. I'll definitely try to get through the trilogy soon then!
StarWarsEU,3av7vv,Bovey,3,Tue Jun 23 21:29:53 2015 UTC,"I would read the whole trilogy.  It will go by quickly, don't worry!"
StarWarsEU,3av7vv,BOOK552,3,Wed Jun 24 19:31:30 2015 UTC,Sounds awesome!
StarWarsEU,3av7vv,Sapitoelgato,4,Thu Jun 25 00:20:05 2015 UTC,"The Thrawn Trilogy starting with Heir to the Empire is a common starting point for new Legends readers and doesn't require any background beyond the Original Trilogy films.  It's also widely considered some of the best Legends work.  I would definitely go with those myself, but you can't go wrong with the list you have."
StarWarsEU,3av7vv,zakfennie,2,Wed Jun 24 00:13:26 2015 UTC,Thanks! I've been putting them off for a while sense it is such a trilogy but I've heard so many good things about them that I'll definitely start it sometime soon!
StarWarsEU,3av7vv,jlobasso,3,Wed Jun 24 01:08:54 2015 UTC,The Darth Bane trilogy is pretty legit
StarWarsEU,3av7vv,jackgibson12,3,Wed Jun 24 00:34:05 2015 UTC,"The Bane trilogy is amazing, and leads into Darth Plagueis so well. There is a huge gap between the books though, but the nod at the beginning of Darth Plagueis was nice."
StarWarsEU,3av7vv,jackgibson12,2,Wed Jun 24 00:41:19 2015 UTC,Oh yeah! I've been meaning to pick those up. Thanks for reminding me of them!
StarWarsEU,3av7vv,Sapitoelgato,3,Wed Jun 24 01:07:07 2015 UTC,"I would read Heir to the Empire and the rest of the Thrawn trilogy next if you're looking to delve into a series or Scoundrels if you're looking for a more contained story. Also I would highly suggest reading Labyrinth of Evil and the ROTS novelization before Dark Lord, they form a trilogy and it makes the story much more impactful.  Also, how is Honor Among Thieves? That's a book I'm interested in reading in the near future."
StarWarsEU,3av7vv,Sapitoelgato,2,Wed Jun 24 01:49:26 2015 UTC,Thanks! I'll be on the lookout for Labyrinth of Evil and ROTS! As for Honor Among Theives I loved it. It took a few chapters to get into it but then it took off. For me the characters were pretty good. Every line of dialogue that Han has sounds excatly like something he'd say. The new character of Scarlet Hark was also a really enjoyable character. The story had a bit of an Indiana Jones feel towards the end to me for reasons you might also agree with if you read it. I hope you enjoy it whenever you manage to read it!
StarWarsEU,3av7vv,Sapitoelgato,3,Wed Jun 24 03:15:29 2015 UTC,"Like everyone is saying, you should start with Heir. I'd suggest going in publication order with those, with the exception of Vader. That's is separate enough, so read it whenever. I would even say to read Labyrinth of Evil and the ROTS adaption first as well, but totally unnecessary."
StarWarsEU,3av7vv,exonwarrior,2,Wed Jun 24 06:03:19 2015 UTC,Thanks for the advice! I managed to find some used copies of Labyrinth and ROTS on Amazon. They should be here soon so I can read them too!
StarWarsEU,3av7vv,radiogekko,3,Thu Jun 25 00:21:33 2015 UTC,"If you liked the political aspect of Plagueis, you could try Tarkin by James Luceno."
StarWarsEU,3av7vv,radiogekko,2,Thu Jun 25 00:09:19 2015 UTC,I loved that aspect of Plagueis! I've been waiting for Tarkin to come out in paperback since they're a bit cheaper. Someone else in this thread told me that there is going to be a paperback combo of Tarkin and A New Dawn coming out in October that looks like a pretty good deal.
StarWarsEU,3av7vv,Sapitoelgato,3,Thu Jun 25 00:12:47 2015 UTC,"Then you will probably like Tarkin, as it is a lot of that. Some people found themselves unable to finish it due to boredom, but I am a fan of those types of books."
StarWarsEU,3av7vv,outbound_flight,2,Thu Jun 25 00:19:36 2015 UTC,I'm a fan of those types of books too as long as they can keep my interest. If there's some sort of mystery or tension then I can really enjoy it.
StarWarsEU,3av7vv,Sapitoelgato,2,Thu Jun 25 00:25:13 2015 UTC,"Tarkin was great to read for me, as I got to see more back history on him, and the author incorporated The Clone Wars information."
StarWarsEU,3av7vv,outbound_flight,2,Thu Jun 25 00:31:32 2015 UTC,"Awesome! I really liked the Imperials like Tarkin, Veers, Piett, and Needa for some reason. I'd like to read more about them and Tarkin sounds like a great place to start!"
StarWarsEU,3av7vv,Sapitoelgato,1 point,Thu Jun 25 01:33:46 2015 UTC,"Did you read Winner Lose All yet? It is super short, but so much fun."
StarWarsEU,3av7vv,outbound_flight,2,Thu Jun 25 01:49:12 2015 UTC,I did! It was a rather fun read once I got into it. Thanks for recommending it!
StarWarsEU,3av7vv,Sapitoelgato,2,Thu Jun 25 23:49:14 2015 UTC,"Now all you got to do is check out ""Heist"" short story from Star Wars Insider issue 138. It is a pre-Scoundrels story of Bink and Tavia by Timothy Zahn. The only way I can say to obtain it on here is to track down that magazine issue."
StarWarsEU,3av7vv,zakfennie,2,Fri Jun 26 00:08:53 2015 UTC,I'll see what I can find! Thanks for the help!
StarWarsEU,3av7vv,Sapitoelgato,3,Fri Jun 26 01:10:32 2015 UTC,"As a one shot, Scoundrels is pretty good. If you like heist movies/books, you'll probably like this one.  Allegiance focuses more on the Empire (specifically, Mara Jade and a squad of Stormtroopers) and the Big Three. I found it quite enjoyable.  Dark Lord: The Rise of Darth Vader is a very cool book if you want to find out more about Star Wars immediately after Revenge of the Sith. I especially liked how it focused on Darth Vader's transformation, dealing with his newly acquired prosthetics and reduced Force ability."
StarWarsEU,3av7vv,Sapitoelgato,3,Thu Jun 25 08:49:43 2015 UTC,"Thanks! Honestly, they all sound great! I think I'll start with Scoundrels and then give Allegiance a shot. I've had it recommended to read Labyrinth of Evil and the Revenge of the Sith novelization before reading Dark Lord so I'll read them probably before that one. It'll probably be tough waiting on them since Dark Lord sounds so awesome!"
StarWarsEU,3av7vv,Sapitoelgato,3,Fri Jun 26 02:21:52 2015 UTC,"If you're interested in getting into Rebels, I'd highly recommend A New Dawn! It's incredibly well written, and adds some serious background and dimension to Kanan and Hera from the main Rebels cast. It's a pretty adult book, so don't worry about it being downplayed just because it uses characters that so far have largely been used on a kid-oriented show, and if you're interested in the New EU, it's an incredible start. The audiobook is also fantastic!"
StarWarsEU,3av7vv,Sapitoelgato,3,Fri Jun 26 02:01:25 2015 UTC,"That's great to hear! I loved the first season of Rebels and Miller's Kenobi, which I just finished and really recommend if you like Obi-wan and/or Westerns. I'll look into it though!"
StarWarsEU,3av7vv,Sapitoelgato,3,Fri Jun 26 02:23:17 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the rec in return, I'll definitely look for Kenobi on my next run to the bookstore! :) You'll really enjoy A New Dawn if you like Rebels already. I had watched S1 before reading the book as well, and it adds so much! :D   I'm also going to pick up Dark Disciple when it comes out in early July, it sounds totally fascinating, and all the reviews I've seen of it have been positive. Might be worth picking up if Ventress, Dooku, and Quinlan Vos are characters you are interested in!"
StarWarsEU,3av7vv,Sapitoelgato,3,Fri Jun 26 02:54:12 2015 UTC,You're welcome! I'll definitely keep my eyes out for Dark Disciple as it sounds really freaking awesome!
StarWarsEU,3aphqa,Skkception,27,Mon Jun 22 13:14:22 2015 UTC,"Anakin absolutely was the one. He turned to the light side and killed the Emperor. Balance isn't an equal number of light and dark side users, it's peace and freedom for the Galaxy."
StarWarsEU,3aphqa,Fenris447,11,Mon Jun 22 13:18:14 2015 UTC,Balance isn't an equal number of light and dark side users   thank you.
StarWarsEU,3aphqa,Cern_Stormrunner,7,Mon Jun 22 15:22:40 2015 UTC,You can interpret it all sorts of ways. My favorite: He took a universe with thousands of Jedi and one Sith and turned it into a universe with two Jedi and two Sith. Nobody said he was a good guy in the prophecy.
StarWarsEU,3aphqa,dweezil22,5,Mon Jun 22 15:33:06 2015 UTC,"You can take it any which way you want, but the official line is what Fenris posted."
StarWarsEU,3aphqa,yurklenorf,2,Mon Jun 22 17:32:49 2015 UTC,"More now than ever, that interpretation simply isn't correct."
StarWarsEU,3aphqa,jethroboom,2,Mon Jun 22 18:26:41 2015 UTC,How so?
StarWarsEU,3aphqa,dweezil22,1 point,Mon Jun 22 18:31:03 2015 UTC,"Well, to start, count the number of Jedi in the canonized universe after order 66."
StarWarsEU,3aphqa,jethroboom,2,Mon Jun 22 18:44:06 2015 UTC,"Ah, the number was loose. If you view the Prophecy as a creation of Lucas, who paid little attention to the EU, then he might not have even known about all the other EU Jedi and Sith, there are tons of both if you cast a wide enough net.  But more in general, Anakin was born into a world that where the Force was basically completely controlled by the Light Side. Yes it was waning, but it was still more powerful. He then did more personal work than pretty much anyone besides Sidious to swing the Balance in the other direction (power wise, if not numerically) when he killed off tons of Jedi. Then later he killed Sidious and himself, and basically left a void with just Luke and whatever other vague forces were lurking in the galaxy.  If that doesn't fit with the watered down kids-friendly Han-shot-second the-good-guys-always-win line, fair enough, but I like it better that way."
StarWarsEU,3aphqa,dweezil22,1 point,Mon Jun 22 19:00:19 2015 UTC,"You might as well say 'Well, it's canon to me', it doesn't make it so.  I'm a huge EU fan (why else are we here), and I just always felt like that was trying to hard to grasp at straws when we were given the answer to the question at hand in 1983.  Focusing too much on Webster's definition of balance."
StarWarsEU,3aphqa,jethroboom,1 point,Wed Jun 24 14:41:28 2015 UTC,"we were given the answer to the question at hand in 1983   Is that your interpretation or official canon? In any EU view, the end of RotJ did nothing to foster peace in the galaxy. In fact, in later EU (esp during the Vong wars) people look fondly back on Pax Sidious..."
StarWarsEU,3aphqa,dweezil22,1 point,Wed Jun 24 15:10:24 2015 UTC,"Makes sense though it feels like there's still something missing. In The Force awakens it seems they're about to have an all out brawl of some sort, is there peace? My only guess is that the movie is outside of EU"
StarWarsEU,3aphqa,omarh14,2,Mon Jun 22 13:35:52 2015 UTC,"Well in canon anakin is confirmed as the chosen one in the clone wars when he visited the ones, even though a lot of people including myself think of that storyline as a shared force vision, it still was a confirmation from the force that he is the chosen one. I am also interested to see what they do with it and if somehow during the force awakens the balance has been tipped toward dark again."
StarWarsEU,3aphqa,Sapitoelgato,2,Mon Jun 22 15:12:37 2015 UTC,The interesting thing is the viewers don't get to see the prophecy. We only get to hear the Jedi talk about it. Is there a book that covers the legend of the prophecy?
StarWarsEU,3aphqa,Murdoc_2,3,Mon Jun 22 13:20:28 2015 UTC,"In the Jedi Path book, a guide to Jedi Training which even includes liner notes by characters such as Luke, Obi-Wan, etc.,they included a chapter with a copy of the Prophecy. I was super stoked to find out what it was, but it was all blacked out by Sidious. :("
StarWarsEU,3aphqa,Sapitoelgato,3,Mon Jun 22 13:25:20 2015 UTC,Hahaha that is amazing! I would have been so let down. I hope we one day find out.
StarWarsEU,3aphqa,JonoLFC,2,Mon Jun 22 14:15:36 2015 UTC,In the Clone Wars it's basically confirmed Anakin is the chosen one.
StarWarsEU,3aphqa,Jeydon,1 point,Mon Jun 22 14:35:24 2015 UTC,"In the Clone Wars, when Anakin visited The Ones, we learned that the prophecy was a calling for him to assume the role of 'The Father'. The Father kept The Son and The Daughter, who were in conflict, from becoming more powerful than one another. The Father who had called Anakin there was becoming old and weak and hoped that Anakin would replace him. Anakin learned that The Son was an embodiment of the Dark Side and The Daughter was an embodiment of the Light Side. He also discovered that he was able to control them and prevent either from becoming too powerful. He ultimately decided to reject the role of controling them, and allowed events to play out between them.  The conflict between The Son and The Daughter led to the deaths of The Father, The Daughter, and The Son. Since both the embodiment of the Light Side and the Dark Side were destroyed, it is resonable to conclude that Anakin brought a relatively permanent balance to the force with his visit to them, just as the prophecy foretold neither would ever become more powerful than the other after his interaction with them there. Indeed, this conclusion is evidenced in the events to come. For 1,000 years the Jedi dominated the galaxy nearly unchallenged, unmatched in strength or numbers. Shortly after Anakin's decision with The Ones, the Sith come to rule for a short time and the struggle becomes more evenly matched numbers-wise. Take the conclusion of Fate of the Jedi, in which a nearly equal number of Sith and Jedi are fighting one another for control of Coruscant and the Galactic Alliance."
StarWarsEU,3aphqa,Jeydon,1 point,Mon Jun 22 14:39:09 2015 UTC,"Was the father Palpatine? If so who was the father before him? Is the dark and the light side inevitable? Must there always be a sith and a jedi, can't it be neutral?"
StarWarsEU,3aphqa,outbound_flight,3,Mon Jun 22 15:24:54 2015 UTC,"The Father was also known as Mortis, and he was not Palpatine. However, Palpatine and Plagueis did perform a Sith ritual which caused a vergence in the force, the cause of Anakin's birth. It could be that the vergence gave the Celestials an opportunity to manifest their will for balance through the emergence of Anakin. The Father may have been around as long as a million years before Anakin was born, and I don't think there's any information about who came before him if anyone.  There were certainly times when no Jedi or Sith existed, as short a time as 35,000 or so years before Anakain was born for the Jedi, and 100,000 years for the Sith. There are many philosophies about the shades or colors of the force, the dark and light side simply being the most popular among the Jedi and Sith. The Aing-Tii believed that the force was more like a rainbow, and the Fallanassi believed that the force was like a river current. Perhaps there's a bit of truth in each understanding. Perhaps the Killiks are right, and the true nature of the force is incomprehensible to the mortal beings of the Galaxy."
StarWarsEU,3aphqa,Sanguiluna,1 point,Mon Jun 22 16:53:43 2015 UTC,"There are already some good answers here, but here's an article on the subject if you're interested. It was written by Abel G.

I read over 160 books, I think I counted to around ~164, including all those silly young novel things (Jude Watson books, etc.). No comics. Part of the reason I felt absolute dread when Disney did what they did.  And I felt like I only hit only half the material. Somehow I never read any of the X-wing books (I'm a sinner, I know, and I'm sorry - but I'm a law school graduate studying for the bar exam right now, so I don't exactly have time to remedy that yet).  Everything I read was worth it, save for a few silly books/series here and there. I'd stay away from The Jedi Academy Trilogy, if you've not read it.  And I'd highly recommend Shatterpoint, Outbound Flight, Shadows of the Empire, The Thrawn Trilogy, and The Hand of Thrawn Duology.  Also, pretty much any Zahn or Reaves novel gets my stamp of approval. I've not seen people praise Reeves books much, but I've loved them all. The MedStar series are very underrated, IMO."

They are the only Star Wars books I've read more than twice."
StarWarsEU,3amh8j,MitthrawnuruodoVCR,3,Sun Jun 21 21:29:58 2015 UTC,"I agree - I, Jedi was great. Corran Horn is a favorite of mine. Thrawn-related books will always be my number 1."

StarWarsEU,3amh8j,MitthrawnuruodoVCR,2,Sun Jun 21 22:16:02 2015 UTC,Will do! I think when I was a child I just struggled to find all the X-wing books in the library so I decided not to read them. Eventually that wasn't an excuse but I guess I got lazy/busy.
StarWarsEU,3amh8j,PR-0927,3,Sun Jun 21 22:27:47 2015 UTC,"hahaha same here, I only read them a couple of years ago. My library never had them so I bought them from the used book store. I think I got some from ebay, you can probably get them all there.  Be careful though, after I bought those books I started a star wars book collection....... Even though I don't really read them anymore."
StarWarsEU,3amh8j,MitthrawnuruodoVCR,2,Sun Jun 21 22:39:38 2015 UTC,"OH and its really awesome if you ever played the X-Wing computer games, the books describe a lot of the illustrations, physics, and battles in the game."

I do not mean to be morbid, but any of the old characters seem like plausible plot related deaths if necessary. I would imagine at some level they have a contingency plan for some of these folks' characters if the actors are for some reason unable or unwilling to perform. Or maybe that's fucked up and I'm fucked up for thinking it.  Edit: surprise twist R2-D2 dies."

I'd rather none of them die, ever.  Chewie dying almost made me ragequit NJO. I had tears and all."

And I do t know what youre talking about SW being uplifting, episode 3 was the last time anything really good happened for the empire. They have some good things here and there but by and large their run is marked by tragedy, terrorism, petty partisan politics, etc. SW is incredibly bleak, so I'm not sure I get what you're saying."

StarWarsEU,3amh8j,PR-0927,2,Mon Jun 22 08:45:26 2015 UTC,"Absolutely fantastic, and it really encapsulates what I love about Star Wars. Don't get me wrong, I love the Thrawn trilogy, X-Wing series, etc. but my absolute favorite era has to be the Clone Wars. Medstar and Republic Commando are really good at humanizing the clones and the non-Jedi, small-time personnel on the ground like medics, engineers, reporters, etc. This is pure Star Wars at its finest: a collection of individual stories carefully taking place in some corner of the galaxy, affected and sometimes driven by plot events introduced in other novels and the movies themselves.     At the end of it all, it's really the vastness of the EU that makes it so amazing. There are so many stories to be told."
StarWarsEU,3amh8j,darkhalo47,2,Mon Jun 22 16:42:38 2015 UTC,"Yeah, totally with you! I love the stories about the non-Force users. It's more relatable since we, uhh, don't have the Force, hahaha.  And yeah, the vastness of the EU is amazing! Which makes it all the more absurd Disney felt the need to wipe anything - they could easily have created new stories without stepping on any toes (I saw an interview where Luceno mentioned he and other EU authors would probably write ""around"" the EU to avoid nullifying it in Disney's canon). The galaxy is a big, big place."
StarWarsEU,3amh8j,PR-0927,2,Mon Jun 22 21:29:51 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure the new films won't contradict much, if any, of the CW or old Old Republic eras. But the NJO and really everything after Battle of Endor? The writers probably want to be able to kill off any character for any reason: what they feel is a better/more marketable story, a more accessible movie, a product that hits the target audience, etc.      I don't like it, though. I feel like Disney could make a fantastic series of movies directly from X-Wing or the Thrawn Trilogy. They're good material, and they wouldn't bore people who've read them... because the only people who've read them, are ones who love Star Wars enough to watch the new movie."
StarWarsEU,3amh8j,darkhalo47,2,Tue Jun 23 01:43:58 2015 UTC,"Yeah they want to be able to pander to casual fans and non-fans (to turn them into fans) and because, simply, of corporate laziness/greed. If they wanted to not contradict the EU without leaving people in the dark, it would have been possible, rather easily - other franchises have done it.  I'm with you - Thrawn-related stuff on the big screen would have been magnificent."
StarWarsEU,3amh8j,PR-0927,7,Tue Jun 23 03:11:07 2015 UTC,I've read most of it. Probably 80%+ and yea it was worth it. There were a few books I put down because they were bad but over the course of about 2 years I enjoyed most of them.
StarWarsEU,3amh8j,idfeiid,5,Sun Jun 21 18:45:49 2015 UTC,"I am in the process of it, been reading for about half a year now and it is quite interesting actually."
StarWarsEU,3amh8j,realy_tired_ass_lick,4,Sun Jun 21 18:00:09 2015 UTC,"Hard to say, I've been reading EU books for like 15 years but that covers a lot of rereads and waiting for the next series. I imagine I could read the whole thing in a about a year and a half to two years while still functioning in life but I wouldn't have time for much else in my free time"
StarWarsEU,3amh8j,501st_legion,4,Sun Jun 21 20:04:23 2015 UTC,"I can't say I have read all of it. I probably missed half a dozen books and the YA novels. But it was absolutely worth the ride over all these years. I started in 1997, and it has been wonderful. It only took a few years to catch up at the time/age."
StarWarsEU,3amh8j,namer98,5,Sun Jun 21 22:27:55 2015 UTC,"I Just went on wookipedia and counted all the star wars books I have read, 211 In total. Now I won't say all of them were masterpieces  but by Christ some of them were down right awesome. Anything to do with thrawn  is imediatly worth reading. I'm probably going to get but hurt for saying this but I really enjoyed the Republic commando  series  good set of books in my eye. Also the x wing series I love books 1-4 but as soon as you hit 5,6 and 7 they make the series and mercy kill was brilliant. I have not read the old republic books before 50yrs bby  but what I have read has been well worth it. I started when I was 13 and am now 27 And still I go back and re read books and look forward  to reading them to my kids."
StarWarsEU,3amh8j,watto1000,3,Mon Jun 22 09:41:03 2015 UTC,"I've probably read around 75% now if you include all the young reader books I haven't read.  I've been reading on and off for around 5 years, but really stepped up how much I was reading this past year.  My honest opinion is that it is completely worth it, if you love star wars and love the idea of an expanded universe then the good books are amazing and the bad ones don't matter."
StarWarsEU,3amh8j,zaxa13,3,Sun Jun 21 22:50:27 2015 UTC,"I read pretty much all of the adult-level books and a lot of the teen stuff (Young Jedi Knights) between 1998 & 2010 and...yeah, it was worth it. There were some books that were downright terrible (I'm looking at you, Crystal Star, Planet Of Twilight, & Children Of The Jedi), but also a lot of really good works like ""I, Jedi"", the New Jedi Order, and the X-Wing & Republic Commando series.   Honestly, my favorites all explored something that few people seem to care about in the GFFA: day-to-day life & consequences. Star Wars has always been really epic & mythic, but it tends to gloss over the nastier aspects of the world. For instance: everyone sexualizes the hell out of the metal bikini & Twi'lek dancers, but when you really get right down to it, Leia & pretty much all female Twi'leks are victims of some pretty horrific sexual assault by murderers & drug lords. And the clonetroopers are child slaves meant to die for the Sith Order's genocidal galactic domination plan."
StarWarsEU,3amh8j,TheDemonClown,2,Mon Jun 22 01:42:23 2015 UTC,"Most are amazing and worth a read. Some are horrible and should be avoided.   Some I recommend are the SWTOW novela, Darth Bane trilogy, Darth Plagous, X-Wing series, New Jedi Order, Legacy of the Force, Fate of The Jedi.   Some that can be skipped are, most of the prequel books are rather boring. Would only recommend Clone Commando series out of these along with Laberanth of Evil. The Calista ( I think that is right) series Ali's dreadful alone with the Shadow Academy.  Other then that pretty okay across the board. I do recommend reading it if you can."
StarWarsEU,3amh8j,Vadernoso,3,Mon Jun 22 00:03:02 2015 UTC,Well i started reading Starwars when i was around five but it wasn't untill i was 18 that i was able to get all the books and comics from some nice people who like eyepatches. I had already read most of everything post Yavin at that point along with a few comic arcs and some clone wars and young reader stuff. But once i got all of the other books i devoured them. Eventaully i managed to get a hardcopy of every SW book and data book so now i have a hard and soft copy of EVERY SW publication except for the SW insider magazines. So i would say its taken most of my life to read the entire EU since i was started reading in 95' and the EU kept growing so eventually when i caught up i was reading them as they came out. And yes i would totally say its worth it. SW is my favorite series and i do enjoy it. Though it has led me to feel like people who have never read any EU works aren't real SW fans.
StarWarsEU,3amh8j,roninjedi,1 point,Mon Jun 22 00:01:28 2015 UTC,Think I've got less than 10 to go. Plan to reread some for sure as well.  I love all of them. :D  Worth 100%

StarWarsEU,3amh8j,NixonInhell,-2,Mon Jun 22 06:23:55 2015 UTC,"My experience reading the Eu doesn't lend itself well to figuring out  a time frame. Like a lot of others I started reading them about 15ish years ago, and have retread a bunch and had to wait on new series and new books to come out. I also didn't go at all into the pre-movie side of things, I stuck strictly to post movie stuff.   If I had to guess I'd say I could probably do it all again from start to finish in about 2 years.   That said, I've been working really hard on trying to make peace with it all being thrown out so I haven't read any of it in a while. I tried to redo the NJO series recently and just got bitter because it's all going away. The star wars Eu was a major part of my life for a lot of years and I don't know how to handle the new cannon yet, mostly because for me it doesn't exist yet - since I haven't done any prequel stuff I haven't watched clone wars or the new show or any of the new books because they aren't post-movies. The real test for me will be when aftermath comes out, I hope so hard that it's good.   So if you haven't read ANY of the Eu yet then I wouldn't bother. There are some real gems in there along with the crap, but I would just wait and stick with the new cannon stuff moving forward."
StarWarsEU,3al152,AUS_Doug,4,Sun Jun 21 06:10:25 2015 UTC,"It's also worth noting that C'baoth's delayal of Thrawn's siege of Coruscant gave Han, Luke, & Co time to leave for Mt Tantiss. Had he not had that distraction, the raiding party would have been grounded.   On the other hand, I got the impression that part of the reason why Thrawn's campaign was so effective was that C'baoth's battle meditation made their limited forces infinitely more effective in combat. They performed better, more men survived, and did more damage to the enemy. It certainly was a major component of how fast and virulent the offensive was."
StarWarsEU,3al152,Ahesterd,2,Sun Jun 21 13:32:35 2015 UTC,"Hmm, very interesting proposal. I'll have to look closer at this."
StarWarsEU,3aklx4,ThetaOmega,2,Sun Jun 21 03:04:39 2015 UTC,"If you've never checked out the Lando Calrissian trilogy or the Han Solo trilogy, they're worth your time.   Personally I enjoyed the Lando books a lot more although they are less well known.  Also Tales from the Mos Eisley cantina was a really good one.  Fun with Lando"
StarWarsEU,3aklx4,JnnyRuthless,2,Sun Jun 21 03:11:40 2015 UTC,I've never read the lando books but I love him. I'll have to hunt down a copy from a library.
StarWarsEU,3aklx4,flameofmiztli,1 point,Sun Jun 21 04:59:07 2015 UTC,"I don't know if I would count Tales of Mos Eisley, since it takes place pretty much during New Hope.  I forgot that I have the Han Solo Adventures, I just haven't got around to reading it yet (I have it in omnibus) but I am moving to the top of my stack now, just need to finish Fate of the Jedi.  I have yet to see a copy of the Lando Adventures, and I was going to put it on the bottom of my list, but I will bump it to the top of my ""To acquire list"". I do plan on owning every Star Wars book (on the fence if I am going to bother trying to find the young adult ones since they are not on the novel timeline in the newer books), its just a matter of when they are available at the local bookstores.  Thanks for the input!"
StarWarsEU,3aklx4,timmypix,2,Sun Jun 21 03:23:01 2015 UTC,The Han Solo adventures and Han Solo trilogy are different series. The adventures were written first and cover a very short time period; the trilogy by AC Crispin is from the Bantam era and covers Han's backstory from childhood to ANH.

StarWarsEU,3aklx4,outbound_flight,2,Sun Jun 21 10:09:08 2015 UTC,"This is my go to list to preBoY:  If you plan to start reading the canon novels and comics, and want some Legends material to support it I suggest this set up of stories. I am not recommending post-Return of the Jedi stuff, due to not having read any yet:  [Legends] 1-3 Darth Bane Trilogy: Great start into the Expanded Universe, where you learn the legend of the creator of the ""Rule of Two."" You don't need prior knowledge to jump right in at this point, but there is a ton of cool stories set prior to this.  [Legends] 4 Darth Plagueis: This is an amazing bridge between the Darth Bane trilogy and the prequels. The story fills in so many gaps that The Phantom Menace only glosses over. In addition, you get an origins story to Darth Plagueis, Darth Sidious, and Darth Maul (keep in mind that Maul's origin was tweaked in The Clone Wars).  [Legends] 5 Shatterpoint: This is a dark novel that deals, with Mace Windu and Depa Billaba, and what it takes to win a war. Loosely based off of Vietnam War and the movie Apocalypse Now.   [Legends] 6 Dark Rendezvous: haven't read it yet, but is a story of Yoda and Count Dooku.  [Legends] 7/8 Labyrinth of Evil / Revenge of the Sith novel: Labyrinth of Evil is a great set up story that leads straight into Revenge of the Sith, and the novelization of the movie takes the story to the next level of amazing.  [Legends] 9 Kenobi: Western story about Ben's first few weeks on Tatooine. After all the destruction in Revenge of the Sith, this story is a nice change of pace.  [Canon] 10 Lords of the Sith: Vader and Sidious trapped on a planet fighting to survive.  [Canon] 11 Tarkin: This story is a great continuation of characters and elements from Darth Plagueis, while focusing on what made Tarkin the man he grew up to become.  [Canon] 12 A New Dawn: Set 10 years before A New Hope, the novel is how Kanan meets Hera. The story is meant to introduce those characters and tease them to the readers before they saw Star Wars Rebels.  These 12 books would make a great foundation into the Star Wars universe. There are many many other great stories, but I am focusing on the time before the Original Trilogy. Others will suggest other great stories, but these are the ones I know."

StarWarsEU,3aklx4,woodenbiplane,1 point,Sun Jun 21 17:06:14 2015 UTC,"Here's a timeline of Star Wars novels from the Legends EU. It'll give you some idea of where a lot of the books are in relation to the Battle of Yavin.  Some of my personal recommendations:   The Old Republic: Deceived, Paul S. Kemp Darth Plagueis, James Luceno (Definitely in my Top 3 EU novels.) Shatterpoint, Matthew Stover (My personal favorite SW author.) The Medstar Duology (Battle Surgeons and Jedi Healer), Michael Reaves & Steve Perry Dark Rendezvous, Sean Stewart Revenge of the Sith, Matthew Stover (Personal favorite EU novel.) Kenobi, John Jackson Miller   And then there are some others in there that I haven't read yet. From what I hear, you can't go wrong with Michael Reaves or Karen Traviss' novels, the Republic Commando stuff in particular.  And then three of the recent canon novels take place before Yavin, but I haven't read them yet either. In chronological order:   Tarkin, James Luceno Lords of the Sith, Paul S. Kemp A New Dawn, John Jackson Miller   Hope that helps!"

For that reason, the Story Group have said that while SWTOR's storyline -- past, present, and future -- is still considered Legends, they don't want to shut down such a big project with so many people employed under its banner for lore reasons alone.  They basically want to keep it running until it doesn't make sense to have it up anymore. Maybe in the future we might get another MMO that replaces it, in the same way SW: Galaxies was shut down to make way for SWTOR, but for now I think they're content to let BioWare do their thing."

StarWarsEU,39yecj,DarthEwok42,8,Mon Jun 15 20:38:33 2015 UTC,"I like it a lot!  If you've never played any of it before, the 8 class stories are up to par with any Bioware single player RPG (The Inperial Agent story in particular has some of the best interactive storytelling they've come up with, ever). The post-class-story stuff varies in quality but much of it is pretty good."
StarWarsEU,39yecj,outbound_flight,7,Mon Jun 15 21:47:21 2015 UTC,"I've been playing on and off since the beta. There's a reason it went F2P in the first place; they made a lot of silly decisions during its development that kept/keep it from achieving its full potential. It's not a perfect game by any means, but it does capture the feel of Star Wars in a lot of good ways.  If you're more interested in story, I'd actually recommend subscribing for a month and giving the game a try, since they have a 12x XP promotion going on, so that really all you have to do to level up is play the class missions, which are easily the best part of the game.  As for this new expansion, I'm not as excited as most. The last two have kinda been duds in my opinion, and the cinematic trailers (while unarguably awesome) never come close to capturing the realities of the game. They talk about pulling a 180 this time, but I'll probably wait until I see some reviews before I consider resubbing for this."

We're expecting a little jedi/sith in july so the plan is to resub then and play at night when she's feeding and such. we'll see how it goes...prolly not smooth. but star wars makes everything better.      edit: oh as for gameplay, we both think of it more as a coop story game rather than mmo. we're both playing the same game in the same room together...and sometimes we interact. heh..."
StarWarsEU,39yecj,abk006,1 point,Tue Jun 16 15:22:02 2015 UTC,"I personally like it. I'm not big on MMOs, but there's enough focus on story to make it good for me. Here are your options:   Play totally free. This is definitely doable; you'll just need to do a ton of side-quests to finish your class story, and you'll be limited once that's over. Spend ~$5. If you make a purchase (I think $5 is the minimum), you'll be a preferred player. You're not paying to win as much as you're paying for some quality-of-life improvements: a movement speed increase outside of combat, extra quickbars, etc. I'd recommend this at a minimum. Subscribe. Right now, this is great if you want to run through the class stories: there's a 12x experience bonus for class story missions, so you can go through without having to slog through sidequests. You get other QOL benefits, too. In a few months, the 12x bonus will go away and you'll get access to the new expansion."
StarWarsEU,39yecj,DarthDonut,1 point,Thu Jun 25 14:52:28 2015 UTC,It's pretty much a nightmare if you play it completely for free. If you pay into it it becomes bearable.
StarWarsEU,39yecj,Rizzan8,1 point,Tue Jun 16 05:05:17 2015 UTC,"I have played it since beta and a bit till the first expansion. I have played Jedi Knight, Sith Inquisitor, Imperial Agent and Sith Warrior. The stories were medicore at best. Most of the choices were meaningless. As a JK you could butcher or sacrifice dozens of innocents and you would only hear ""Uh, Jedi should behave like that"". Character animations are clunky and stiff. Even Kotor I had better battle animations. And there are quite a lot of graphical bugs which haven't been fixed since beta. If you want to play it for just a gameplay of WoW clone, then go ahead. But if you want to play it for the stories, think it through. Luckily the most of the game is free so you can check it out whenever you want!"

StarWarsEU,39ywen,edwardantonowicz,9,Mon Jun 15 22:28:35 2015 UTC,"Ranking Jedi can be a little complicated because there are a few categories.  To preface, everyone confused ""the best"" with ""the most powerful"" in Anakin's case. He had the most natural talent with The Force in history, but his personality never meshed well with the Jedi code, and flaws inherent to his character eventually drew him to the dark side.  Obi Wan was allegedly the ""ultimate Jed knight"" and there's nothing that really happened in his life to contradict that.  Luke is remarkable in a few ways. Beating Darth Vader in single combat was unheard of, and doing it with his minimal training indicates more talent with The Force than even his father.  http://www.starwars.com/news/the-starwars-com-10-best-jedi Check out the writeup on Luke in this article, it'll give some insight."
StarWarsEU,39ywen,Amitai45,6,Tue Jun 16 08:29:39 2015 UTC,"I'd say he's the best jedi of his Era,  and of the new jedi order.  There's just too many jedi that came before him in the old order for him to be the best of both,  and he wasn't a jedi until after the order was wiped from existence. But yeah its going to be a long time before another takes his place."
StarWarsEU,39ywen,Monster502,2,Mon Jun 15 23:52:21 2015 UTC,I belive Lucas said at one point that he believed Luke was. And looking at his EU feats i would say he was definitely first if not in the top 5.
StarWarsEU,39ywen,roninjedi,1 point,Mon Jun 15 23:57:13 2015 UTC,"I'd say top 5. Nomi Sunrider has him beat, and if pushed I'd say Yoda in his prime probably did as well."

StarWarsEU,39ywen,roninjedi,3,Tue Jun 16 23:40:14 2015 UTC,"She literally ripped the Force out of a man. Luke has nothing on that. Saber skills, sure, but Nomi was so completely immersed in the Force that she could dictate who could connect with it."

StarWarsEU,39ywen,clwestbr,3,Wed Jun 17 00:00:42 2015 UTC,"Really i think the amount of stuff she did with battle meditation and being the leader of the jedi order was a greater achievement than severing the force.   http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Sever_Force  Apparently Jacen did it to ben when he was tourtering him, Verge did it to Jacen, Keira did it to Meetra Surik, Palpatine was able to do it, So could others  I think Nomi is a really great character and a really powerfull one. I just don't think she is strong enough all around to be better than luke who has as great a controll over the force as she does plus saber skills to boot. I do think that Nomi could take Bastila when it comes to the battlemeld or take Yoda in force controll.  Also luke is also special in that he turned the battle meld into not just something where he could guide people but where the jedi in his squadrons could talk to each other. So he took it a step beyond.   Also even though i love Nomi (becasue she is awesoum and a female character) i am a die hard Luke fan so im way beyond biased."

StarWarsEU,39ywen,abk006,1 point,Wed Jun 17 17:10:28 2015 UTC,"Stands to reason that he was, at least of those in known Galactic history. Palpatine was pretty clear that he believed that Anakin would become more powerful than himself or Yoda. His injuries and personal flaws prevented this from happening. (Not to mention that the strict code of his adoptive family ill-equipped to be there for Anakin emotionally in the way that he needed. This was especially true of Obi Wan, who loved Anakin but couldn't bring himself to accept that the Order clearly didn't fit his apprentice).   As a new Qui Gon style Jedi who embraced (healthy) attachments, it stands to reason that Luke actualized the potential that his father never could and gained a master of the Living Force that even Qui Gon couldn't (himself raised in the Order and a product of its culture, even if he saw the flaws in it). Luke also benefitted from not having trained from childhood. A big theme of the Legends material surrounding Vader was how his injuries made him a stronger Force user in some regards because he had to focus more on technique and nuisance because his injuries prevented him from falling back on raw power. Luke's handicap is that he wasn't trained from childhood. Anakin may have started late, but he was still pretty young. His son, by contrast, brought an adult sensibility to the development of his skills that tempered their use. Having gone most of his life without being able to overtly call upon his skills (e.g. levitating objects), he would have a greater appreciation for what his skills are and mean.   So if we are measuring greatness in terms of how attuned a particular Jedi is to the Force, the pace of Luke's development in the films strongly implies that he probably surpassed even Yoda in less than twenty years after the Battle of Endor. As far as the non-Legends cannon goes, I guess we'll get some clues about it in TFA.   Edit: typo"

A species is often defined as the largest group of organisms capable of interbreeding and producing fertile offspring. (there's a lot more to it than this  but this is the basic)   Races are defined according to any identifiable characteristic, and also by gene frequencies. These characteristics are relative, not absolute.   So to recap:  Gand and Rhodian, different species.   Blue Twi'lek and green Twi'lek, different race, same species.   Duros and Neimoidian, possibly same species and different race. (there's not enough to go on, but it's possible they're close enough to be the same species, different race. Regardless they're likely part of the same genus or at least family.)  Is the Empire racist? No.   They are speciest.   They may be racist towards blue Twi'leks vs green Twi'leks, but that's nit picking and not the point we're trying to make here.

It got to the point where I would zone out and realize I didn't even know or care what was going on anymore. I'd end up reading my Econ textbook instead. Even that was less boring.   I'd rather read the back of shampoo bottle for 8 hours than fight my way though that book again.  I'd watch the 8 hour made-for-British-tv version of Pride and Prejudice over reading that book again.   I'd rather sit in a room all day and try to pick the stickers off of apples once they've gotten a little overripe and the sticker has kind of melted into the skin of the apple a little bit and you just can't quite GET YOUR FUCKING FINGERNAIL UNDER THE EDGE OF THE STICKER. As much as that frustrates me, I would rather do that than read this book again.  Obviously that's just my opinion and I know a lot of fellow Star Wars fans really enjoyed it and some of my own friends (who's opinions I really respect also did). So if you liked it, good for you. I just found it a little on the dull side."
StarWarsEU,39c7px,AnusHoldus,6,Thu Jun 11 01:09:05 2015 UTC,"Haven't read Tarkin, but I've definitely found Star Wars books that were widely lauded to be very horrifically dull. The Darth Bane trilogy gets so much praise that I figured I'd give it a go, but I ended up barely making it through the first book and not even attempting any of the others. For me it was like the dark version of I, Jedi. Whereas I, Jedi gets (probably rightly) panned for atrocious plot, its fun characters and pleasurable writing style make it one of my favorites. I found Darth Bane 1 to have an equally bad plot, but none of the compelling factors of I, Jedi.   I find that it's a good idea to try the crowd favorites and maybe even slog through them for a bit if it doesn't grab you right off the bat, but there's no point punishing yourself and continuing indefinitely with a book you don't enjoy. There're too many fun books out there to waste time on ones you don't like."
StarWarsEU,39c7px,DocCalculus,3,Wed Jun 10 23:05:11 2015 UTC,Darth Bane is an awful series. I have no clue where it gets that reputation for being so great from.
StarWarsEU,39c7px,Johnny_Welfare,1 point,Wed Jun 10 23:33:35 2015 UTC,Probably because it establishes the history of the rule of two
StarWarsEU,39c7px,kelling928,1 point,Thu Jun 11 03:53:35 2015 UTC,That is odd.  Darth Bane is what started my journey into the EU.  I was browsing the local library and saw Rule of Two - which is book 2.  I loved it.  Didn't even realize it was a part of a trilogy initially.  Then I read book 3 - also pretty good.  I went back to the 1st book - and found it to be dull and boring.  So maybe give it a shot with book 2 - you might like it.
StarWarsEU,39c7px,SophieTheCat,8,Fri Jun 12 06:13:14 2015 UTC,"I'm with you, couldn't even finish it. It's also the book that gave us ""Sheev"" as a name for Palpatine so it loses points for that. Then there's that scene where Sheev and Tarkin are sitting around complimenting each other and you start expecting Sheev to ask Tarkin to take his pants off.   Heir to the Jedi was fun. A New Dawn was much better than I expected. Haven't read Dark Lords of the Sith yet but I haven't heard good things.   So it's looking like the new EU isn't shaping up so great. Only a 50/50 success rate so far."
StarWarsEU,39c7px,Johnny_Welfare,4,Wed Jun 10 23:35:25 2015 UTC,"Lords of the sith was just named incorrectly. It really doesn't even focus on the sith and certainly doesn't tell you anything new or substantial about them.   When I just think about the story and ignore my expectations about the sith, then I don't think it was a bad book."
StarWarsEU,39c7px,Windtalk3r,5,Thu Jun 11 00:04:02 2015 UTC,"I think the problem with Lords of the Sith is that it's a book about trying to kill A alps and Vader.  Before A New Hope.  I mean, I know the story is what people are interested in and all but when you know the ending, then there's no sense of drama.  Everyone just want Palps and Vader being badass. And they weren't even in half the book."
StarWarsEU,39c7px,KamuiT,2,Thu Jun 11 04:58:36 2015 UTC,"There were maybe two scenes of Palps and Vader being badasses together. And no discussion of Sith-ness. I'll give it credit for having some reflection on Vader's past and how that affects his relationship with Palpatine, but overall the book was not as advertised.   I was disappointed. My second new EU book and I'm 0/2."
StarWarsEU,39c7px,imakevoicesformycats,3,Thu Jun 11 13:07:21 2015 UTC,I thought the first half was great but the second half just couldn't keep up and led to an overall mediocre book.
StarWarsEU,39c7px,matty25,3,Thu Jun 11 06:13:34 2015 UTC,"I agree completely! You actually made it way farther than I did. I only got a hour or so in (audiobook) before I called it quits. I think Tarkin is sort of an intriguing character but the book is just a giant, boring snoozefest.  Admittedly, I didn't make it much further in Heir to the Jedi, but that had less to do with it being dull and more to do with the fact that I've read Kevin Hearne's Iron Druid series and I just kept imagining it as Atticus and Granuaile in Space."
StarWarsEU,39c7px,PrincessLeia91,4,Wed Jun 10 21:21:34 2015 UTC,"I really liked Tarkin. The character development is absolutely brilliant. I found myself really liking Tarkin and rooted for him a lot of the time.   However, I will absolutely agree that the book has some real padding issues with the actual story. A lot of the pursuits and space battles were really drawn out and long winded. I much prefer the ""downtime"" in these books, when there's no action (or at least minimal) and more words"
StarWarsEU,39c7px,thewildbeard,1 point,Wed Jun 10 23:32:12 2015 UTC,"Agreed.  I listened to the audio book and found myself day dreaming sometimes.   If I had to actually read the book, I'd probably drop it."
StarWarsEU,39c7px,SophieTheCat,3,Fri Jun 12 06:15:52 2015 UTC,"Wow interesting opinion, not because I think your wrong just that your right not a lot of people share the opinion. For me I read 60 percent of tarkin before I decided to read Heir to the jedi and then read Lords of the Sith (which I'm currently on) and afterwards I do plan on finishing Tarkin and move to a New Dawn.  Tarkin for what I was reading was really good, I felt like I got to know tarkin a lot, I enjoyed his back story but I do understand there where moments it certainly felt it dragged.   Heir to the Jedi for me was  a semi fun read, granted I enjoyed it, but I doubt id read it again, it was barely above average. My main issues being the structure of it felt too 'mission after mission' like, and the author went far in explaining things that I certainly didn't care much for, I feel it didn't get good until halfway through the book.  But hey its your opinion, I wouldn't say give up reading after one book that disinterested you. You just might find your favorite star wars book if you continue on :)"

Everyone else i know hated heir to the jedi and thought a new dawn was meh but i loved them. Ive noticed that between my friends that grew up watching the old trilogy and the others that got into star wars later they seem to really have different likes when it comes to the books. The ones that love the old trilogy dont like bew stuff that has to do with them like heir to the jedi. Guys like me that got into star wars later tend to like just about anything that relates even remotely to star wars. Seems like the ""purists"" that love the old trilogy dont want what they remember star wars to be like changed at all. Which is understandable."
StarWarsEU,39c7px,AmunRa666,3,Thu Jun 11 15:57:49 2015 UTC,"As much as I liked Tarkin for it's exploration of his background and the relationships it broadens I totally get what you are saying, the majority of the story is dull. However getting a deeper background on probably one of my favourite characters is what kept me reading until the end.   It's an average book otherwise with a below average plot.   flavour wise its awesome!"

Draw up representations of these characters. What flaws do they have? what makes them heroes or villains.   Understanding the characters you are writing about, or the people/species you want to write about is important. Look at source material that is out there to give you an idea of what are dealing with.    For example. you have a Gran you want to write about. so first we find out that Grans are from Malestare (sp?) - they run the political system but the home world itself was populated by dugs and the gran basically subjugated them and made them slave like. So from this we know that they are at least a cunning if not an agressive species  this is the type of stuff you may want to dive deeper into, and I would honestly suggest not having a discussion until you have those parts figured out."

StarWarsEU,3939ls,smokeyjoey8,2,Tue Jun 9 02:15:22 2015 UTC,"What do you mean ""when they get cheaper""? Disney owns X-Men and Fantastic Four, because Disney owns Marvel. The problem is that Disney/Marvel have to give FOX a cut of the X-Men and Fantastic Four merchandise sales. It really doesn't make sense for them to be making toys and having to give away a good cut of it. Toys and other merchandise are also pretty much just advertisements for the films, so it wouldn't make sense to help advertise a competitors film.  The don't have the same problem with Spider-Man, though, which is why he's in DI and pretty much dominates Marvel's toy shelf presence. Sony had the merchandising rights to Spidey, but thanks to their financial troubles they decided to sell the animation and merchandising rights back to Disney a few years ago. Now Disney can make all the Spidey toys they want, even ones based on Sony's films, and they don't have to share a cent.   Should the day come where FOX gives back the X-Men (unlikely to ever happen) and the Fantastic Four (much more likely to happen, especially if the new movie bombs) rights, you can pretty much be guaranteed to see FF and X-Men toys and merch on shelves withing six months."

Sidious wasn't powerful because of his political machinations, he was powerful because of what he did with those machinations. With promises, assassinations, bribes, and the stoke of a pen, he brought down the Jedi Order. Lord Kaan and other brute force Sith Lords were only able to claim a small part of the galaxy before they eventually fell to infighting, betrayal, and the fact that the Force always balances itself out.

Palpatine could have abandoned the rule of 2 when he came out as emperor,  as it was no longer relevant at that time.  I think he did abandon it a bit with his hands and such.

Even with the most generous definition of ""about 30 years"", clearly this is after 25ABY. I am well aware of the Empire's continued relevance, see my initial comment where I mention that they are not known as ""The Imperial Remnant"". Even internally, they continued to call themselves ""The Empire"", see Jagged Fel's bristly reaction to Jaina's use of ""Imperial Remnant"" in FOTJ. Thus, the Empire as seen in the EU is not the ""First Order"" to be featured in TFA. No, the fact that they said that the EU is non-canon means that all the original characters from the EU are gone. I quote from Darth Plagueis ""I haven't rejected the dynasty I was born into. I've rejected the name I was given."" ―Palpatine Palpatine rejected his name. Since Palpy doesn't seem to be the sort to mellow with age, it stands to reason he wouldn't go by his first name 30 years down the line."

StarWarsEU,38edti,yurklenorf,3,Thu Jun 4 07:45:28 2015 UTC,"In their defense, there's a very strong argument that the franchise isn't scifi, but space fantasy   The sub isn't ask+sciencefiction, it's askscience+fiction."

I haven't watched the show personally so I may be a bit off base, but I hear that handled order 66 by saying that all clones had mind control chips implanted? That just rubs me the wrong way. It removes all moral complexity from order 66 and in my opinion completely contradicts one of the main reasons for creating a clone army instead of a Droid army.  I much prefer Republic Commando's version."

Not at all happy with DisnEU, especially because it was motivated my corporate greed and not practical need - their excuses for the wipe were incredibly insulting and false. The only reason the PT was even possible is because of the EU - and Lucas had a very fair understanding and respect of this, and adopted EU into his movies. EU is what allows Disney to even create its ST.  The only way DisnEU can rope me in is if they add in the most important elements of TruEU in (and not invalidate their possible existence) - Thrawn, Mara, Jaina/Jacen/Anakin, etc. Else, fuck Disney and fuck Fake Star Wars.  So yes, I also hate those assholes slamming TruEU. They know nothing, and they're pretenders to the throne of true fans. Decades of a fairly consistent story - often integral parts of our childhood - and we most loyal fans get nothing more than a slap in the face.  io9 had a great article about how Disney's behavior is absolutely not like Marvel's canon shenanigans - their old fans were not disrespected - old materials were canonized."
StarWarsEU,38edti,Ginkasa,9,Wed Jun 3 21:51:20 2015 UTC,I don't see how you're post is any better than what OP is talking about. It's just over the DisnEU rather than the old EU.
StarWarsEU,38edti,PR-0927,-1,Wed Jun 3 23:58:30 2015 UTC,"Because TruEU is what deserves respect. DisnEU is fake and created through corporate greed, not loyalty to the base which allowed the franchise to exist. It's biting the hand that feeds. These aren't on an equal playing field - they're very different.  Also what OP is talking about is the nasty treatment TruEU fans get on the other subreddit. Anyone posts anything from TruEU, and some asshole Disney apologist can be counted on to say ""that's not canon"" - that's not only fucking annoying, unnecessary, and rude, but false to TruEU followers. Any comments Innocently praising TruEU get downvoted to hell. The reverse is NOT true."
StarWarsEU,38edti,Ginkasa,9,Thu Jun 4 00:19:31 2015 UTC,I think you're idealizing what the EU was. Functionally it was no different than DisnEU other than one supplanted the other.
StarWarsEU,38edti,PR-0927,1 point,Thu Jun 4 00:31:28 2015 UTC,"No, I'm most certainly not - read up on the value and influence of TruEU and you'll see. SW was a dying franchise after the OT until EU revived interest. Also you're still missing the point in everything I wrote."

My point is that your posts, with such strong verbiage dismissing the new stories, is just as bad as the people who dismiss 20 years of material just because it's not canon."
StarWarsEU,38edti,PR-0927,-2,Thu Jun 4 00:43:02 2015 UTC,"I don't have a problem with strong verbiage - yes I'm using it. I have a problem with their stance and behavior.

StarWarsEU,38edti,throwaway_for_keeps,-6,Thu Jun 4 02:12:38 2015 UTC,"Look, first of all I think that's a bit of an ego trip here to have ""banned words"" because you moderate the subreddit and personally find it pretentious.  Second, the term didn't originate here. It's on many SW communities on and off Reddit.  Third, no I'm not ashamed of myself. I'm just a more loyal fan to the franchise and I'm not O.K. with the bastardization of my childhood by Disney."
StarWarsEU,38edti,PR-0927,0,Thu Jun 4 02:28:12 2015 UTC,Apparently hateful people slamming the new eu is also a thing.
StarWarsEU,38edti,pchc_lx,3,Sat Jul 11 18:21:11 2015 UTC,"So, you're saying Star Wars popularity was declining until the Expanded Universe revived interest?  So they decided to write more books and ride the gravy train out of the goodness of their hearts, but Tarkin was written out of greed?  I'm trying to wrap my head around that gigantic gap in logic and I just can't seem to make it.  And turning this into an ""us vs. them"" or ""old vs new"" is absolutely bananas.  James Luceno writing Tarkin for Shelly Shapiro at Del Rey, advised by Leeland Chee and Pablo Hidalgo at Lucasfilm is not any different from James Luceno writing Labyrinth of Evil for Shelly Shapiro at Del Rey, advised by Leeland Chee and Pablo Hidalgo at Lucasfilm.  The only difference is now Disney gets a percentage of sales.  But if you want to do your part to splinter the fanbase, have at it.  I'll be celebrating everything while you're stuck with your old stories."
StarWarsEU,38edti,PR-0927,2,Thu Jun 4 06:27:13 2015 UTC,"Thank you for deliberately misstating everything and putting words in my mouth.  Your initial question - yes. It's an interesting business study, actually. After the OT, SW popularity waned severely. It received a resurgence from several EU books (The Thrawn Trilogy, the X-Wing Series, etc.) which boosted the franchise back out of obscurity and landed NYT Bestseller spots.  That resurgent popularity allowed for a) video games based off EU stories (JK series, anyone?), b) the whole Shadows of the Empire marketing run, coordinated with LucasFilm, c) advertisements for EU books (even TV ones), d) toys based off EU stories (yes, even the absurd Sun Crusher has toys), e) a litmus test for George Lucas to unveil the PT once the demand was well-established.  GL took a lot of EU ideas and incorporated them, and by creating the PT allowed for an enormous realm of additional EU stories. It really just ballooned from there.  BTW Tarkin was contracted in before Disney got involved, so that's a weird example for you to use - to make a point that is neither relevant nor exactly accurate.  The fanbase is already splintered BTW. It's inevitable when you shit on fans of existing canon that you will anger them. And you go do you - whatever floats your boat. But don't expect angry fans to shut up and become apologists for disrespectful Disney actions."
StarWarsEU,38edti,pchc_lx,3,Thu Jun 4 06:49:06 2015 UTC,"Man, great point about Shadows of the Empire. That was massive! Books and magazines and toys in every store. Prince Xixor and Dash Rendar were real SW characters and everyone had the action figures to prove it.   The dismissal of the EU is so crazy. They act like all it was was Dark Empire and whacky 70s Marvel comics.   This stuff was real, it really happened, it was STAR WARS® in every sense- and a lot of us grew up with it. Just so insane to do a complete wipe like they did. Just so lazy and dismissive.."
StarWarsEU,38edti,throwaway_for_keeps,3,Thu Jun 4 09:00:37 2015 UTC,"Absolutely! I'm so annoyed at people who are rushing to make excuses for Disney. Before Disney there was KotOR, Kyle Katarn, Shadows of the Empire, Thrawn, etc. The overwhelming bulk of it was amazing stuff - Dark Empire being rather well-accepted as non-canon.  Moreover, the toys and ads! Even Vector Prime from the NJO had a TV advertisement. People are out of their minds pretending this stuff is disposable. Major books regularly made the NYT Bestseller list.  Even ignoring the toys, video games, clothes, advertisements, etc. which incorporated EU, how about video game mods? If anything, that demonstrates the well-accepted reality of all the pre-Disney stuff among fans - it's even what got more mainstream fans to read the EU.  ModDB is FILLED with so many professional-grade mods for so many games with EU materials - be it Vong or Thrawn or Ssi-Ruuk or Clone Wars EU stuff:  http://www.moddb.com/mods?filter=t&kw=%22star+wars%22&released=&style=def&theme=&game=&type=  Glad I have at least some allies here not so easily pushed-over."
StarWarsEU,38edti,PR-0927,2,Thu Jun 4 09:42:22 2015 UTC,"Oh shit, yeah the Vector Prime ad actually had Mark Hamill in it right?? At least the voice over ad I'm thinking of..  I honestly think JJ could have still made a 'whatever-the-fuck-i-want' movie, plopped somewhere into the EU timeline, with a small team of folks to determine which 3 or 4 books and characters it overwrites.  A way smaller wipe, leaving the rest of the EU intact.  Why should Shadows of the Empire get wiped in order to make a post-ROTJ film? It just makes no sense unless you literally do not want to have to think about it at all and would rather just wipe everything than take 5 minutes to have a look and see what already exists...  Sorry.... I get worked up about this."
StarWarsEU,38edti,throwaway_for_keeps,-2,Thu Jun 4 10:03:30 2015 UTC,"Dude, they're science fiction stories.  None of them really happened."
StarWarsEU,38edti,PR-0927,2,Fri Jun 5 05:46:34 2015 UTC,So what? Is there a problem with having a passion for science fiction? OP (in this thread) means that the stories really happened as Star Wars stories. And that they did.
StarWarsEU,38edti,clwestbr,2,Fri Jun 5 06:57:42 2015 UTC,"I'm still trying to wrap my head around the fact that you pass off the new canon as a cash grab, but completely ignore that quite literally everything in the old canon was ALSO CREATED TO MAKE MONEY.  Disney's acquisition was announced on December 21, 2012.  Tarkin was announced April 25th, 2014.  Unless you have a source that states it was contracted before Disney got involved, you're just gonna have to settle on being wrong there.  But it's funny, because let's pretend you weren't wrong and Tarkin was totally written before Disney got involved, but sat on a shelf for two years.  Because then, we'd have something that was published under Disney but written before Disney.  But since it was published under the new canon for Disney, it's automatically shit.  Nevermind that it would have been written for the old canon.  It doesn't even make sense, though.  You get mad at Disney for shitting on fans of existing canon for what?  getting rid of Luuke?  Ensuring we never have to see Jaxxon again?  Not having Even Piell die twelve different times?  Unless you only liked Star Wars because it told a relatively cohesive story, there's no reason to blindly hate this new canon.  Because there were some huge fucking turds in the old EU.  So far, every novel released under Disney has been of the same caliber as the majority of the old EU books.  If we exclude Heir to the Jedi, which was a little weak, the new books are better than most of the old.  But you don't care.  Because it's more worth it for you to sit and whine about losing your stories than actually read what's out now.  And that makes you edgy.  Or special.  Or a hipster, I'm not really sure.  So when you're talking to your friends or coworkers on December 21st, after everyone saw Episode VII over the weekend, you can tell them all about what things ""really"" happened after Return of the Jedi and why the movie is wrong, and everyone will look at you like you're crazy."
StarWarsEU,38edti,shit-I-justfuckedup,-1,Fri Jun 5 05:45:39 2015 UTC,"Everything in the old canon was created to create money yes, but not at the expense of continuity and respect for the franchise and other authors' stories, as a whole (minor inconsistencies aren't a big deal, and can easily be explained/retconned). Disney on the other hand just blanket-shat on everything because they're lazy, greedy, and it can maximize their profits more easily by appealing to those who have no EU background.  I could have sworn the initial concepts for a Tarkin book happened before the wipe, and then the book carried over into DisnEU - maybe I'm mixing it up with another Luceno book.  And again, you're putting words in my mouth - STOP. If it aligns with the EU, fine by me. I happen to enjoy Star Wars Rebels - for now. The moment it steps out of line and violates the EU, buh-bye, no longer considered Star Wars.  And you're doing exactly what all the other ignorant fans are doing (which is repeatedly called out in this entire thread by many other fans) - equivocating the bad EU stories as ALL OF THE EU. Your examples were for a) minor inconsistencies and b) stupid stories. The overwhelming majority of EU was consistent and well-written.  Also no, the new Disney novels have been nowhere on the same caliber of the older novels - Thrawn, Shatterpoint, Outbound Flight, Shadows of the Empire, etc. Get real.  BESIDES, who the fuck says it's not a legitimate reason to hate stories which destroy continuity? It totally is, and you're out of your damn mind if you can't comprehend this. I don't care if the stories are good. I don't care if they're popular. I care if they respect the continuity (and once we get to the respect of continuity, THEN we can  move to stage two - were the stories of quality). It's a hierarchy of assessment.  And no, I don't care. Guess what? That's my right. I, and many others, happen to think you and those like you are the ""special"" ones for having disloyalty and an inclination toward Disney apologism (thanks for the ad hominem attack BTW, totally establishes you as lacking severe class and sophistication).  Will they look at me crazy? Maybe. Maybe not. Probably not because everyone has passions about fictions - plenty of folk rage about Star Trek and Marvel universes, and that's totally fine. I don't give a fuck, frankly. I'll do what I want. Besides, I'm not some random ass neckbeard - I'm capable of dispassionately explaining my argument in great detail, supported by cold, hard facts - as I already have with non-SW fans. They get it."
StarWarsEU,38edti,throwaway_for_keeps,2,Fri Jun 5 07:13:30 2015 UTC,"None of this is new. People have acted like that for years (you should see /r/startrek sometime...).  Enjoy what you enjoy.

StarWarsEU,38edti,Biwin,8,Wed Jun 3 22:46:35 2015 UTC,"Don't act like you ""voiced an opinion"" that you didn't think what Disney is going to do is going to be as good as the EU.  There is verifiable proof of you being petty, belligerent, and entirely dismissive of the new canon for absolutely no reason other than it's not the old canon.   Also, everything pre-Disney except the movies is non-canon, because they can't be fucked to put in work researching. Thanks Disney, but could you stick to kids' films so I don't have to watch your shit?     \   Fine. JJ and Jar Jar are on even footing, responsible for one terrible movie each. Happy now that that's cleared up? Can we go on with our lives agreeing to disagree? Or must you continue this futile attempt to make me excited for this needless continuation of the films?   \   JJ: entirely to blame for the third trilogy sucking (I don't need to see it, Star Wars films had their time, that time has passed). STOP IT DISNEY!   \   I sound bitter because they bought out the franchise from a man who was letting it run its course after he fucked it up with a prequel trilogy, and then totally disregarded 95% of the franchise purely because it would've been too difficult (I'm sure a quick search of Wookiepedia would've killed them) for them to make things in accordance of the EU, then decided to repeat the thing that disappointed fans 15 years ago by making a new trilogy which, unlike that trilogy, is completely unwarranted and unneeded. They then move to cater to new audiences, rather than people who have been fans for longer, so that they attract younger (child) audiences with things that even fanfic writers recognised as stupid, such as the ball-droid and the three-blade light-saber. They are bringing back the original cast to trick older fans into seeing the first film, and will likely completely replace them within the next 2 films, leaving us with a brand-new cast of people that (let's be honest) nobody would give a shit about were it not for the fact that it's this or nothing. If this were a fan-made film on youtube, it would get fuck-all views, however because it is made by Disney, it will likely break records with the sales, and have millions of 6 year olds world wide shouting ""Daddy, I want the ball-droid!""   \   It really upsets me that all the stuff written over the last 40 years was forsaken just so Disney could make money from the franchise without doing any background research. But hey, that's corporate greed for you. No consideration for the real fans.   \   The scream of horror when you realise Disney is about to ruin another of the great nerd franchises   \   The New Hope was back in 77 with the first movie, and there hasn't really been any more hope since they ballsed up The Phantom Menace. You don't like me saying that Disney making everything non-canon to decrease the work they have to do making money from something that wasn't their idea is wrong? Fuck off buddy, I'm entitled to my opinion. Wish /r/StarWars is free of people with this opinion all you want, but you're basically telling me I have no right to my opinion by saying this place would be better off without me, so how about you stop telling me I shouldn't be allowed to stay on /r/StarWars and go back to sucking Disney's dick without trying to tell me I'm wrong for not doing so. They're playing around with something I've been a fan of most of my life, and just because I don't like them discrediting nearly the entirety of the Star Wars universe I shouldn't be allowed on the subreddit? Screw you!   \   The best Episode VII news would be that they cancelled Episode VII   I can do this as long as your comment history will allow, I'm not working tomorrow.  For the record, I don't care if you don't want to see Episode VII.  If you loved the EU so much you cried when they said they wouldn't be continuing it, I sympathize with you.  I'm glad there are more people out there who understand why Soresu is the best lightsaber form.  However, it's a little premature to talk shit about this new film like you've already seen it.  You're absolutely entitled to your opinions, but when you imply that people aren't ""real fans"" if they accept this change, you're gonna get downvotes.  And when you respond to those downvotes in an aggressive manner, you're gonna get more downvotes.  And when you make posts complaining about the downvotes, you're gonna get more downvotes.  And when you make posts complaining about the downvotes you got from your post complaining about the downvotes, you're gonna get more downvotes.  No one chased you off the subreddit except your own stubbornness and refusal to take a hint that maybe fans there are excited about the new movie, and rightly so."
StarWarsEU,38edti,AmunRa666,2,Thu Jun 4 06:17:16 2015 UTC,"When they call it fanfic, they're just wrong.  It was officially licensed literature written by professional authors and okayed by Lucasfilm.  Don't get overly worked up about people who are like that.  And as I've learned from the comments here, don't feel that the proper reaction is to swing the pendulum in the completely opposite direction, either.  We're all Star Wars fans.  If you think it's acceptable to insult people because they like a Star Wars story that you don't like, you're hurting the fandom at large.  There were so many books in Legends written by so many different authors, we didn't have ""one thing"" that made them all Star Wars.  You could change the title and character names and no one would know they were supposed to be Star Wars.  Death Troopers is not a Star Wars book.  It's a space zombie book that they put Han and Chewie in for no reason.  But they called it Star Wars and everyone went with it.  Tarkin is Star Wars.  It's a detailed backstory to one of the most memorable, if least utilized, characters in the first movie."
StarWarsEU,38edti,thegraverobber,2,Thu Jun 4 06:38:53 2015 UTC,"Old EU is all that really matters to me.  Just because Disney wants to make a boatload of money does not affect in the slightest the incredible stories and universe I grew up reading about.  On the other hand, I certainly bought myself some Disney stock."
StarWarsEU,38edti,Sanguiluna,0,Thu Jun 4 12:57:51 2015 UTC,"Here is the thing, many people are entitled to their opinions. I know I am, and I run this joint.

StarWarsEU,38ecpu,roninjedi,6,Wed Jun 3 17:37:12 2015 UTC,"This just screams ""Hey look at this crazy thing we're doing. Buy the comic!"" There's no way it ends in anything but death or divorce. Han and Leia are obviously together in episodes 5 and 6, so unless Han is an even bigger scoundrel than we thought...  Stuff in the old EU, like Bria Tharen or whatever sorta worked because the relationship took place before Han met everyone else. This - not so much. Writer is just going for shock value."
StarWarsEU,38ecpu,FrontierBrain,4,Wed Jun 3 18:59:48 2015 UTC,I think Bria worked well for explaining why han was reluctant to commit fully to the rebellion at first and why he comes across as more of a playboy (he doesn't want to get hurt again)
StarWarsEU,38ecpu,G-42,3,Wed Jun 3 19:03:05 2015 UTC,The only way I accept Han having a wife pre-Leia is if it ends up like Homer and Ned's Vegas wives.  Han and Luke(or Chewie) got drunk in Mos Eisley or something and married a couple of floozies.

StarWarsEU,38ecpu,Ginkasa,2,Thu Jun 4 22:44:37 2015 UTC,"I think it's fine. There's obviously more to the story than just they're married. Yeah, it's obviously meant as shock, but if they never did anything big or different then the DisnEU would get real boring real quick.  Overall, though, I'm going to see how it pans out before I start judging it bases on just a cliffhanger ending."
StarWarsEU,38ecpu,Ohmstar,1 point,Thu Jun 4 01:39:29 2015 UTC,"This is a pretty common trope in comic books (and a lot of other media, really). We meet a new character towards the end of the book, and they reveal themselves to be so-and-so's husband/wife/girlfriend/baker/whatever. Then, the next issue starts with an explanation... ""Well, she's my ex-wife."" or something of that nature. That's what I imagine will happen.   Seriously, though. We know whatever happens, Han and Leia get together."

I'm pretty close to dropping this comic from my pull list. It feels like they're just cramming things into the comic without any regards to whether it actually makes sense inside of the movie universe.  Vader and Luke having a lightsaber duel being the other biggest thing.  If this were still considered EU or some sort of fun tale not necessarily canon then I could stomach it.  Don't get me wrong, if Aaron can somehow explain this away as a psycho ex or something then I'm back in.  Otherwise this may be too much for me."

StarWarsEU,386hfi,taulover,6,Tue Jun 2 04:55:05 2015 UTC,"For reference, you could check out Matt's Expanded Universe for a chronological breakdown of The Star Wars Expanded Universe. He basically attempts to piece together comics, novels, short stories, etc as best he can in chronological order. He does admit to not follow the canon novels/comics, and instead focus on the Legends material as that is Star Wars to him. He does respect people, who read them, but they are not for him. He is still in the pre-The Phantom Menace on his timeline, but he updates once a week. If you are reading chronologically, then by the time you catch up, he will have gotten farther in his quest.  Matt's Expanded Universe: http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLls1N_myfiawOnVd5yVNV7Mp2418__C53  Anyways, as far as the Old Republic novels go, there are two generally lackluster novels you could get away, with skipping: Dawn of the Jedi: Into the Void and Red Harvest. His reviews of them are pretty on point. The other novels set during that time has varying opinions, so it is up to you to decide. I am working through a lot of books right now, so I don't have the best of advice. Hope some of this helps."

Also the dark empire graphic novels before that were decent."
StarWarsEU,386hfi,NullCipher,2,Tue Jun 2 15:08:05 2015 UTC,"I actually just started to do this myself. I've also read the Zahn novels and a few others from post-RoTJ but it was a while ago.  I'm only doing Novels, no comics.  Dawn of the Jedi is really just a tie in for the comics and since everything else was cancelled in that timeline, it really has very little tie to anything else because it happens so far in the past.   I think Red Harvest is a prequel of sorts to one of the later Stormtrooper books (Death Troopers?), so that may make more sense to be read later on instead of in direct chronological order, although I havent gotten to Death Troopers yet.  The Lost Tribe of the Sith short stories are OK but they also tie into a later series (Fate of the Jedi I think) so they might have more context to be read out of order.  I liked the Old Republic books, and now I'm on the Bane trilogy. But overall the ones I remember reading from post-RoTJ were much more engaging."
StarWarsEU,37uah8,The_Pale_Blue_Dot,59,Sat May 30 13:21:06 2015 UTC,"The Revenge of the Sith legends novelization and legends novel Dark Lord: Rise of Darth Vader cover that topic.   Dave Filoni, who worked many years under George Lucas, and is leading the direction of the show Rebels said this in an interview:  StarWars.com: When I was watching Vader in the last episode, I thought about how you really see a different version of him in each Star Warsmovie. Do you have an idea of where Vader is at mentally during Rebels?  Dave Filoni: Oh, yeah. You have to. I’ve always believed that Vader has no repentant bone in his body until he realizes his son is alive. Luke is the opportunity that triggers everything that occurs. His awareness of Luke being alive forces him to remember his past in a way that’s uncomfortable for him. It forces him to remember Padmé. It forces him down a path of, “Maybe my son will join me, and together we can rule the galaxy.” Luke really has to get him past that thought, which kind of culminates in that scene on the bridge on Endor, when Vader says, “It’s too late for me.” That realization only happens because of Luke.  Up until that point, I think he’s a destroyer. He’s an incredibly angry, hate-filled destroyer. He hates himself. He hates what happened. He hates all his former friends because he thinks they betrayed him. Anakin Skywalker thinks that he never switched sides. He thinks he’s still fighting the good fight. He thinks Obi-Wan betrayed him. He thinks Padmé betrayed him and that led to her, and their child’s, death. He thinks the Jedi were staging a coup against the Republic. He thinks the Republic was weak, and that’s why it became corrupt and fell apart despite Palpatine’s attempts to save it. Overall, he internally hates himself for everything that occurred because he thinks that he wasn’t strong enough to make things right.  He’s consumed by these ideas and is pretty much trapped. He has no option aside from embracing his new persona — Darth Vader. What we encounter in Rebels now is just a wall of anger and hate — everything that the dark side manifests.

Anakin still absolutely hates the Jedi and still loves and trusts Palpatine. He goes on about how his anger at the betrayal from the Jedi fuels him. He briefly things about what it would be like to fight Palpatine but in the end is utterly loyal to the Emperor.  He tries to not think about the past. He basically pushes all thoughts about what happened and his former life away because they make him weak and Palpatine picks up on it whenever he does."

In Vader's world view (galaxy-view?), holding the Empire together is ""fighting the good fight"" all the way.  How Padme fell in love with someone so completely naive about her life's work, I have no idea.... then again, my wife had not seriously watched Star Wars until years into our relationship, but finally just read Thrawn Trilogy last year, so there ya go. I'm sure Padme had hopes..."

A lot of his influence in the current stuff is echoed from conversations from Lucas as he was being taught to take over the reigns. And then he brings in his own spin to things."
StarWarsEU,37uah8,Sapitoelgato,18,Mon Jun 1 22:55:13 2015 UTC,"I thought the same thing until I read the novelizations of EP1-EP3.  The books do a much better job of leading you through his gradual descent than the films do.  In EP2, he is already kind of hanging on by a thread.  His massacre of the sand people gives him a real taste of his power when fueled by hate.  He is already fostering resentment toward the Jedi (and Obi-Wan in particular) for holding him back.  His secret marriage to Padme drives a serious wedge between him and the Jedi as it creates a constant fear they will discover their secret (fear -> anger -> hate and so on).  He also has a real disdain for the corruption and inefficiency in the Republic (remember his conversation with Padme about how the government 'should' work?  They should be 'made' to agree.)  As for Palpatine, Anakin has great admiration for him.  Palpatine has been stroking his Ego since he 1st arrived on Coruscant, and consistently sewing seeds of doubt and resentment toward the Jedi council in particular.  By the start of EP3, it's almost inevitable that Anakin will fall to the Dark Side.  His faith in Palpatine is much greater than his faith in the Jedi council, and his fear of losing Padme is his primary motivation.  When Palpatine reveals himself as the Sith Lord, there is really no question that Anakin is going to stick with him.  He has this last gasp of trying to do what he 'thinks' he should do (by reporting him to the Council), but he already knows that he can't/won't allow the Council to kill him.  When it comes time to choose, kill Mace or let him kill Palpatine, he knows he doesn't have a choice.  Palpatine and the Dark Side are his path to the power he so desperately needs.  As for the Jedi overthrowing the Republic, technically that is 100% true.  Palpatine was legally elected, and legally given supreme war powers.  While it may be the 'right' thing to do, the Jedi are in fact attempting to overthrow (and technically assassinate) the legally elected chancellor of the Republic, and as I already mentioned, Anakin has a stronger allegiance to Palpatine (and the 'Republic') than he does to the Jedi by this point."
StarWarsEU,37uah8,Bovey,10,Sat May 30 15:13:50 2015 UTC,"I'd say that Anakin deciding to stick with Palpatine has less to do with his friendship with Palpatine, and more to do with his ability to save Padme. If you'll recall, Anakin actually did do the right thing and brought the news to Mace Windu. Anakin only intervened when Mace made it clear that he was going to kill Palpatine and thus have his knowledge to save Padme die with him that forced Anakin's hand and set him on the Dark Side."
StarWarsEU,37uah8,PM_ME_YOUR_BURDENS,7,Sat May 30 18:43:48 2015 UTC,"I'm gonna base my answer off how the issue is covered in the RoTS novel.   It is in this blazing moment that you finally understand the trap of the dark side, the final cruelty of the Sith - Because now your self is all you will ever have. In the end, the shadow is all you have left. Because the shadow understands you, the shadow forgives you, the shadow gathers you unto itself. And within your furnace heart, you burn in your own flame.  This is how it feels to be Anakin Skywalker.  Forever…   Anakin realized he was duped the very second he woke up in his suit. But by that point his life was utterly ruined, and Palpatine was all that was left. So he went along and did his duty.  Also in the book, Anakin wasn't eating or sleeping at any point between Dooku's death and the Mustafar duel. Palpatine was using the force to disrupt his biological rythms so he would be mentally off balance and his bullshit detector would be faulty (Anyone would succumb to doing crazy shit if they haven't slept for a week).  Also worth considering is that while Anakin was the most talented Force user in galactic history, he was never really that good a Jedi. Due to his childhood trauma of slavery and having to abandon his mother, he never had the mental discipline needed to live his life by the Jedi philosophy. Jedi doctrine dictates that you must let go of all attachments and let the Force dictate your whole life. Anakin constantly rebelled against this, primarily by marrying Padme. He always put loved ones above all else, which reflects on his choice to save Luke.  With that in mind, while Anakin passed away aware of the evil he had committed, I don't think he ever thought that the ""Jedi were right all along"". Not only was the Order not that important to him in the grand scheme of things, it's not even certain that the Jedi order was ""right"". After fighting Palpatine, Yoda reflected that the Jedi were destroyed because of his failings to adapt the Order's archaic philosophies to an ever-changing world."
StarWarsEU,37uah8,Amitai45,7,Sat May 30 17:53:10 2015 UTC,"He knows Palpatine is just using him but until Episode VI atill holds onto the belief that the Jedi are something that should not exist. Though while Palpatine sees it as him manipulating Vader, Vader sees it as him putting up with the Emperor long enough to learn all he can and then killing him, becoming Emperor himself over the government he helped create."
StarWarsEU,37uah8,OtakuMecha,5,Sat May 30 14:26:06 2015 UTC,"Not to mention, since they're both sigh lords, rule of two is in effect so eventually Vader would need to kill Vulvatine for one reason or another"

StarWarsEU,37uah8,morgue27,2,Sun May 31 02:57:46 2015 UTC,That's true. Though Vader and Sidious are very different philosophically despite both being Sith. Sidious just wants power and doesn't care who or what has to be destroyed as long as it benefits him. Vader does truly want a better galaxy but it is fully willing to do terrible things to achieve that.  And he comes to know Sidious doesn't really care about improving the galaxy as he does.
StarWarsEU,37uah8,OtakuMecha,5,Sat May 30 15:50:00 2015 UTC,"I think by the time the original trilogy, Vader knows full well he was/is deceived by Palpatine, and that he was wrong in his slaughter of the Jedi. But he's so far gone by that point that he doesn't care anymore and he just continues to do what he does because 1) it's all he knows and is good at, and 2) he literally has no one left other than Palpatine; everyone else he knew or cared for are either dead or they hate him."

Anakin only has his own point of view, and he very much respects Palpatine. The viewer, on the other hand, already knows that Palpatine is evil. We see everything that's going on, and have the benefit of that knowledge."
StarWarsEU,37uah8,thebadgerofhoney,2,Sat May 30 22:14:17 2015 UTC,"While that's true, I'd like to think that even if I was in Anakin's shoes Palpatine's line of ""you are the only Jedi with no knowledge of this plot"" would make me raise my eyebrow, even if I'd been groomed by him for years."
StarWarsEU,37uah8,thebadgerofhoney,2,Sun May 31 11:17:52 2015 UTC,Wouldn't it make sense to keep it away from the Jedi who is closest to Palpatine?
StarWarsEU,37uah8,pewqokrsf,3,Sun May 31 12:19:17 2015 UTC,"Even with his concern for Padmé, anyone with a brain can see that Palpatine's story is tosh. This, of course, comes down to Lucas' writing.   You're removing the Force from Star Wars.  Palpatine held the whole Senate under his sway.  It wasn't just because they liked him; it is heavily implied that he used the Force to manipulate everyone around him.  Someone powerful enough in the Force to not just blind, but manipulate the whole of the Jedi Order and the Galactic Senate for decades will have no problem whatsoever eroding any sense of distrust that could arise in someone like Anakin."
StarWarsEU,37uah8,morgue27,4,Sat May 30 21:12:55 2015 UTC,Was there not something about the Jedi temple being built on top of an old sith burial ground that contributed to the clouding of the councils minds as well?

However, with this now being ""non-canon"", I guess we all have to sit and accept that Vader is the ignorant idiot Lucas portrays him to be in the films... I mean, seriously, his wife was pregnant, he ""killed her"", then 20 years later the kids that should've been killed at the same time show up?

He's hopelessly, naively idealistic. He never stops being the little boy that wants to see the galaxy as all sunshine and rainbows, and he dreams it so badly that he can't bring himself to see all the rain and clouds are not somebody else's doing, but his own. Palpatine uses that. He whispers promises of peace and stability. All Anakin wants might someday happen maybe, if he joins Palpatine."
StarWarsEU,37uah8,clwestbr,2,Sat May 30 15:59:31 2015 UTC,"I don't know about what the novelizations say like others here, but i always figured that Anakin's change when he accepted his name as Darth Vader - dropping all rational thought and believing what the emperor told him and all that - was him embracing the dark side, letting it take over. I mean, what else is going to happen once you decide to openly let all that evil in? It's gonna take over and make you think bad things... It's evil, after all.

StarWarsEU,37poeq,astoughastoph,5,Fri May 29 12:39:48 2015 UTC,"Sight challenged individuals can get access to their library.  Most unfortunate that is currently the only way to get those versions (read by Chuck Benson, if you want to google it, knowing that name helps a lot).  I mentioned that I have read the JAT.  Already read everything Zahn I think.  Trying to get to NJO while skipping as little as possible, unfortunately I might be skipping the Callista trilogy (just realized it's called that), which I guess would put Black Fleet and Correllian trilogies next, just hoping for some feedback on pros/cons of skipping Callista."
StarWarsEU,37poeq,Scootch1233,2,Fri May 29 12:46:17 2015 UTC,Oh sorry. I missed that.
StarWarsEU,37poeq,Sapitoelgato,3,Fri May 29 12:54:40 2015 UTC,"I recommend Kenobi and Darth Plagueis.  Two of my favorite EU books, and the audiobooks are really solid.  Also, the Darth Bane Trilogy is pretty cool."
StarWarsEU,37poeq,Sapitoelgato,1 point,Fri May 29 14:18:40 2015 UTC,"I did not like Dawn of the Jedi: Into the Void. The time of that book was mostly dealt in the comics, and cut prematurely. If you want to go chronologically, I suggest jumping ahead all the way to the Darth Bane trilogy, as it leads into the prequel era. You could read the Old Republic books, but they are enhanced by the comics and video games set during that time."

StarWarsEU,37nn1i,namer98,4,Thu May 28 23:41:09 2015 UTC,Actually I heard that about the hardcovers too. Not that the paperbacks are 'filler' but the idea was that the hardcovers were the lynch pin of the overarching plot.  Not that I'd recommend only reading them.
StarWarsEU,37nn1i,tunnel-snakes-rule,1 point,Fri May 29 01:55:58 2015 UTC,"They're mostly where large things happen. The beginning, the introduction of Tsavong Lah, the Fall of Coruscant, the turn of the tide, and the finale. But those 5 big moments aren't enough to really know what is happening."

StarWarsEU,37nn1i,zaxa13,1 point,Fri May 29 07:50:23 2015 UTC,"I would definitely agree with this, just read them all!  It's a good series, and a nice change of pace where the stories are more dark and gritty."
StarWarsEU,37nn1i,the_gv3,5,Thu Jun 4 14:45:15 2015 UTC,I'd really really recommend the whole series if you're able. And any list that doesn't have Traitor on it is horribly incomplete.  Its the best Star Wars book. But you really need the whole New Jedi Order to get to know all the Solo kids and Nom Anor so you can appreciate it to it's fullest.
StarWarsEU,37nn1i,BridgetheDivide,2,Fri May 29 00:41:17 2015 UTC,So very much this.  Cannot overstate my agreement.  Traitor was remarkable.
StarWarsEU,37nn1i,PictureofPoritrin,4,Fri May 29 01:58:09 2015 UTC,"Paperbacks as filler?  If you skip Traitor (Stover) you are missing what may be some of the best written and most deeply philosophical writing within Star Wars -- Classic EU, New Canon, or otherwise.  It's a kind of spiritual extension of Siddhartha within A Galaxy Far, Far Away, and it is a foundational element into the evolution of one of the critical characters within the EU.  They went to some phenomenally dark places in that thing.  And that was one of the paperbacks.  It's not all in the hardcovers.  Those signaled, generally, major plot pivot points, wrapping up of some arcs and the beginning of new ones, and the refocusing on some story elements or characters over others.  To a degree.  You will not get the whole story just reading the hardcovers.  You need every ounce of NJO to fully understand the Yuuzhan Vong (and you'll want to; they're alien in the most alien sense, but then they're not) and the wandering path that is the direction they took exploring the nature of the Force within the series.  Most Star Wars books were sort of non-impactful on the EU at large; a few new characters would show up, one or two of them would die, and then you'd still have the Big 3, the Wookiee, the Droids, Lando, and the kids.  Yeah, ok.  I mean, there are a few books here and there that really shone through some lesser quality stuff (as fun as some of those were).  NJO is sort of a masterpiece because they said ""we're going to change things.""  The evolution of the relationships between these characters is really something, and part of the beauty of this story arc is we kind of get the sense that they're all aging.  And it sort of felt like nobody admitted that through the Hand of Thrawn books.  NJO is a sizable shift in the way these books were written and the way LucasBooks planned things.  I would highly recommend starting with Vector Prime and just moving full steam ahead.  It may seem daunting, but there's so much there that I'd hate for you to miss some of the most inventive storytelling we got in the EU."
StarWarsEU,37nn1i,PictureofPoritrin,2,Fri May 29 01:55:46 2015 UTC,"I stand corrected. Well, I have already started, looks like I will finish the series someday!"
StarWarsEU,37nn1i,clwestbr,3,Fri May 29 08:54:09 2015 UTC,"There is almost no way that could work. While the paperbacks aren't as impressive to have on the shelf they are a significant part of the series, in fact they are about a quarter of it. Most of the storytelling happens in those books. The paperbacks were not 'just filler'. Without them you would not know where Onimi came from, nor Nen Yim. You would have no idea how Jacen's life changed or how he and Vergere ran away together. You would have almost no Anakin Solo screen time, and he is the first half of the series. You would also have nothing on Zonama Sekot, it would show up as a cheap deus ex machina at the end."
StarWarsEU,37nn1i,the_onion_night,3,Fri May 29 01:35:35 2015 UTC,"If you are short on time for some reason and absolutely can't read them all....i suggest doing something else. Use your precious time left to learn a skill or go bang some chicks.  If you do have the time, read um all. Its a pretty solid arc all said and done, and ya don't want to miss any of the smaller plot points.  And, like some user said, absolutely  don't skip Traitor."
StarWarsEU,37nn1i,tunnel-snakes-rule,2,Fri May 29 20:13:11 2015 UTC,"Just curious why you'd want to skip so many books in the series.  Sure, they're not all five star reads, but they're all part of the story."
StarWarsEU,37nn1i,tunnel-snakes-rule,2,Fri May 29 01:57:44 2015 UTC,"Ehhh, time really, I'm no noob to the old EU, ive read ALOT, just never ventured out past Hand of Thrawn. NJO, LotF, and FotJ are about the only things I haven't read, give or take a couple random books here and there. I read all of Legacy comics though and it got me interested in the Vong. I'm really hooked on the new canon and all those new novels/comics coming out and to start NJO as long as it is and as late as I am seems very tiring, almost like it gets in the way you know?"

StarWarsEU,37ag54,LeoNemean,3,Tue May 26 04:23:53 2015 UTC,The issue is they covered the past that has been revealed in the legends EU. Basically anything before 5000boy and after the Rakata war is pretty much conjecture and hasn't been explored that much. Unless they covered it in some book I don't know about.
StarWarsEU,37ag54,Coppercredit,2,Tue May 26 15:28:50 2015 UTC,pretty much conjecture and hasn't been explored that much   That's why I was hoping they would do more videos about those time periods. It would be great to find our more about how the Jedi first came into being for example. That's why I'm not happy that the comics went from Dark Horse to Marvel.
StarWarsEU,37ag54,Coppercredit,2,Wed May 27 05:23:44 2015 UTC,"I know and Dawn of the Jedi went to bantha foodo when they lost the license, but Marvel wanted Star Wars."

StarWarsEU,36z11b,frogtaku,6,Sat May 23 09:14:22 2015 UTC,For me NJO/LOTF/FOTJ have better stories than the movies but sadly some of the books are poorly or even badly written (especially Dark Nest trilogy).  But well... this is very unpopular opinion and most people here will tell you to stop reading after Hand of Thrawn duology.
StarWarsEU,36z11b,Rizzan8,1 point,Sat May 23 10:16:39 2015 UTC,Thanks for sharing your opinion on this. It's set on a low priority for me but I might read them anyway depending on my mood. Are there books among those you think are bad that aren't necessary to continue with the stories? Looking at the publication dates some were probably completely optional.
StarWarsEU,36z11b,Rizzan8,2,Sat May 23 12:02:15 2015 UTC,"You shouldn't skip any books from NJO/DN/LOTF/FOTJ because they create a whole story. There are no ""spin-offs"" among them. There  are also three books between LOTF and FOTJ - Crosscurrent, Riptide and Millenium Falcon. They could be taken as ""spin-offs"" but the third one slightly serves as an introduction to FOTJ."
StarWarsEU,36z11b,zaxa13,4,Sat May 23 12:57:17 2015 UTC,"I think you would be making a mistake if you didn't realy NJO, it's a really good series and one of my favorite parts of the EU."
StarWarsEU,36z11b,zaxa13,2,Sat May 23 12:28:17 2015 UTC,"Since you are the second person to tell me that, I guess I'll give it a shot. What do you think of the stories set after NJO?"
StarWarsEU,36z11b,nate517,3,Sat May 23 12:39:30 2015 UTC,"I've not read FOTJ so I can't comment on that.  Dark Nest was quite boring to me, and having only read it 2 months ago, I already feel like I've forgotten most of it.  I finished LOTF yesterday, and I think there are lots of pros and cons to it; I certainly don't regret reading it, but then I'm a pretty big star wars fan and I'll read anything."
StarWarsEU,36z11b,SithSidious,3,Sat May 23 12:54:37 2015 UTC,"I loved LOTF, though I was fairly young when I first read them but I still love the dynamic of them with a bunch of characters from NJO. Though if you are going to read LOTF I would suggest reading Dark Nest trilogy even though the writing is not great but as it kind of sets up LOTF."
StarWarsEU,36z11b,Fofolito,2,Sat May 23 17:57:01 2015 UTC,"I think Legacy of the force and FOTJ were in my top 5 series in star wars.  I really like how the characters in those arcs (along with NJO) are only found in the legends universe, so the authors didn't have to force their character traits to fit a type of character who works well in a film.   I think FOTJ was a really good series for reasons that some other people may knock it.  I think it has a new and novel villain; and I really like how this new villain overshadows the threat posed by old enemies.  I really like how it serves as a foil to the prequels of star wars.  You will notice some parallels, but the layers of intrigue and realism make it more suspenseful and exciting than the site plot in the prequels (partly because, well, everyone knew palpatine was going to take over sometime).  It also had some great characters.  I liked how it didn't shy away from the fact that some characters have been around for so long that they should be powerful.  Luke was very skilled, yet I don't think that ever made me feel as if victory was a foregone conclusion.  Legacy of the force also has some solid characters and a pretty good story.  I remember the first time I read invincible (last book of the series): I finished it in one day and couldn't put it down because it had a tight and focused plot with high intensity.  Throughout that series, I also had characters I liked on both sides, so at times I wasn't sure who I wanted to win.  Overall I would highly recommend."
StarWarsEU,36z11b,InnermostHat,1 point,Sat May 23 21:39:51 2015 UTC,"That's the kind of detailed arguments I like to read, thanks! Did you think like everyone(?) that Darknest was bad?   If I ever go post-NJO I'll read it anyway. I endured pretty terrible things in the past in order to get to the good parts in stories, like a 39 episodes dull and badly aged TV series for an awesome movie."
StarWarsEU,36z11b,Fofolito,4,Sun May 24 07:31:52 2015 UTC,"Let me put it to you like this:  The NBA has been a sport in decline for many years (some people have told me viewership has declined every year since Micheal Jordan retired nearly 20 years ago. Suppose Pepsi saw a financial opportunity and bought the league. I know this is unlikely and/or impossible but bare with me for the sake of the argument. Pepsi buys the league, dumps a bunch of money into it and promises die-hard Basketball fans and potential fans alike that they will respect the sport, the league's history and impact, and do all they can to bring it to a new generation of fans and players.   Then Pepsi reveals their first move. All player statistics, all team win/lose records, and all numbers relating to probabilities and abilities are wiped clean. Pepsi decides that the best way forward is to not be tied down by what came before. Maybe there is merit to this idea: maybe the statistics and rivalries and emphasis on individual players' statistics was killing the sport and Pepsi wants to be able to start the new season off their way. Regardless of the reason, Pepsi will alienate a large number of old fans (maybe even players as well!). There are people who have spent their entire lives rooting for the Denver Nuggets and see everything that they've supported and followed and invested in suddenly wiped out in a blink? Its devastating. Is it even the same sport? Is it even the same league after that?  Disney axed the EU. I've spent far more time and money in reading the books, browsing the comics, playing the games, roleplaying in clubs all based on the EU than I have ever done on the Movies alone. To me, the movies are the smallest and least interesting part of the Star Wars Universe. Sure, there hasn't been a new live-action film in ten years and I've been leaving the target demographic of the franchise for nearly 7 or 8 years now but Disney has very nearly killed Star Wars for me and there's not much I can do about that. Without Jaina and Jacen Solo, without Admiral Wedge Antilles, without the Sith Empire and Great Sith Wars, without Dark Side Sorcery and without a certain Mandolorian by the name of Boba Fett I'm not sure it is Star Wars anymore."
StarWarsEU,36z11b,VegasSaint9,2,Sun May 24 06:28:11 2015 UTC,"Are the books gone though? The real problem here is that you won't get sequels anymore. It's dead. But you can still headcanon the thing the hell out of Disney with past works and give them the middle finger if that's what you wish.  I understand the fact that the strength of the old EU was that there was a coherent set of stories that enriched everything officially. And that that last element is gone. But I think you are giving a corporate entity too much control over your own cultural appropriation if you think all those stories can't be read and thought about it anymore.  If I think the new movies and EU are shit, well there is still the old EU (just take in account everything pre-axing).  If it's good, well there are two continuities. I have seen worse.  I grew up with japanese pop-culture and if you haven't discussed Gundam or Macross continuities for exemple, you have seen nothing. Heck, even Tolkien's canon has issues that seem much more delicate than Star Wars since he passed away before he could fix important continuity problems (to the point of being cosmological, like the origin of orcs or dragons).  Anyway, I'll read the hell out of the old EU as much as I want. Disney has control over the IP. Not my mind."
StarWarsEU,36z11b,VegasSaint9,3,Sun May 24 07:21:32 2015 UTC,"Its not just continuity though. I personally own around half of the ""Legends"" old canon and have spent 10 years reading the books and comics and playing the games. What Disney did is essentially a slap in the face and the sting is yet to come.   EU had some great writing in it, sure it had bad too but a large majority of what I have read was enjoyable or even great. The new Canon is not off to a great start. They are re-treading old ground in new shoes until the movies start flowing and they can get on with it in earnest. Honestly I think part of the reason why the EU was so great was because there were no more movies coming. With the disney production machine at full steam we are going go get alot of movies but very little in the way of quality novels as disney will want to use all the best storylines for the movies.  For now its not a big deal to headcanon. But give it 5 years. 10 even. The canons will be so different that you wont be able to follow both which is going to cause a split between fans. Diehards who prefer old canon because either it was better or simply they put more time and money into it and newer fans who only really know new canon or people who think hanging onto old canon is dumb. I dont think you even need to wait to see that schism starting. Everytome old vs new canon is brought up it generally turns out that people who have no investment in old canon dont understand the position of those emotionally and monetarily invested in old canon and that starts arguments when people are just told to let it go.  Tolkien for example is different there is really only a handful of books all by the same authour while EU is a 35 year effort by dozens of authours.  And again, disney has no control over your mind but they do have control over the new products to market. Its like buying model one of something to find it suddenly unsupported due to the new version. Even if there is a passionate community of 1.0 users eventually that will come to and end and only 2.0 will functionally remain."
StarWarsEU,36z11b,MandolorianWookie89,2,Sun May 24 07:52:02 2015 UTC,"Quantity is only a problem if you are set on reading absolutely everything, except that by the time the new EU is bloated you'll have read most if not all of Legends. Because no more of the later is coming.  I doubt Disney's EU will be all quality like everything that gets tons of material in a short timespan. So you'll have a pretty moderate list of books/comics that are worth a shot. And I think old and even new converts will still recommend some Timothy Zahn or KOTOR if we are talking ""quality over quantity"" (for the sake of an exemple, those are some of the most mentionned).  As to explain to the new ""Legends archeologist"" how it works: the old EU stopped pre-Disney, the new EU started post-Disney. The delimitation is pretty clear.  I know I am being optimistic, and you are right that there will surely be some of the most retarded fanbase divide ever. But hey, that kind of divide always happen even without corporate intervention, and it probably already existed for subsets of the EU anyway. If worst comes to worst, there will be Legends communities and everyone will hug likeminded people in their own enclaves."
StarWarsEU,36z11b,smash909,2,Sun May 24 08:08:20 2015 UTC,"I would have preferred a Gundam like situation. Concurrent series but seperate continuities. The Universal Century and Correct Century can coexist and because both exist the franchise as a whole is enriched. What Disney did is a monetary decision. Make no mistake. Whereas Tomino and Bandai have owned and profited from Gundam since 1979 Disney hasn't made a dime (aside from their licensed productions) off Star Wars until now. They can't claim profits from Movies released in the 80's or 00's. They can't claim profits from the comics or the books, from the games or the Holiday Special that doesn't exist. So what did they do? They made it all irrelevant and have opened the franchise to new stories, new media, and new toys (read: new profits). Disney bought Star Wars not because they love us and want us to be happy. They bought it to make a buck."
StarWarsEU,36z11b,PR-0927,1 point,Sun May 24 08:10:15 2015 UTC,"I wasn't actually thinking about its universes but more on its canon definition and its paradoxes: ""only animated works are canon"" -> meaning 0079 TV and movies versions, as well as IGLOO and the new Origin OVA that all have huge events alterations are canon. Same for Zeta and its alternate ending that retcons pretty much everything happening after except Late UC.  And then you look at the books and mangas anyway, and have alternate retellings. And you can't even fixate on something: the first half of Hi-Streamer explains most of Char's Counterattack BUT is not re-explained in the alternate retelling Beltorchika's Children that leads to Hathaway's Flash that is somehow mentionned in Unicorn. Zeta Define is supposedly The Origin's sequel but things are lifted from Char's Deleted Affair that is the sequel to the Movie Trilogy's interpretation of Gundam.  And that's just a few of the exemples on top of my head."

I havent gone too far into the Legends EU as I would've liked, since by the time I found out about it, there were 100s of books. So this new EU gives me a chance to catch up.  With the new canon I would read Tarkin, as its written by the same guy who wrote Plagueis, and I'm reading through it, but I've heard wonderful things. Try reading the new comics if you get a chance. They're set between ANH and ESB except for Kanan."
StarWarsEU,36z11b,zaxa13,2,Sat May 23 17:19:44 2015 UTC,"Yeah the new canon has a few things that are quite intriguing as well, like Tarkin or the upcoming Aftermath.  Speaking of comics, I might also start to look for those Omnibus/Hardcovers for:   X-Wing Republic Dark Times Tales of the Jedi Knights of the Old Republic Legacy Vector(?)   Perhaps for Empire and Rebellion as well.  God, there are so many things I want to read."
StarWarsEU,36z11b,BoltedGates,2,Sat May 23 17:38:30 2015 UTC,"I know right? Thats why I love the EU, so many amazing stories. Tales of the Jedi/ Knights of the Old Republic are awesome and have some of the best characters in the SWU. I heard the X-Wing series is good for the first 4-5 books then gets kinda ehh. Havent read much past the events past RotJ except the Thrawn trilogy/ Vector Prime when I was like 12. So much good content though. The novelization to Revenge of the Sith was amazing even though its not EU, but it fully digs into the events of the movie and a lot got cut out. Try it when you get a chance."

StarWarsEU,36z11b,fearsomeduckins,1 point,Sun May 24 15:45:56 2015 UTC,"I also mostly read the comics. Not just because I like the format, but also because I only tend to do it in the evening and then I'm to tired to read a book."
StarWarsEU,36z11b,PR-0927,2,Wed May 27 08:27:12 2015 UTC,"Stop after NJO. The stuff later is really divisive among the TruEU crowd for a reason - The Dark Nest Trilogy is not very well written, and FotJ/LotF REALLY get silly in their ""history repeats itself"" attempts.  For what it's worth, I read all, and I'm furious about this DisnEU nonsense. But, those last three series - ignore 'em and focus on better post-RotJ series (The Thrawn Trilogy, the Hand of Thrawn Duology, Survivor's Quest, NJO).  And give The Black Fleet Crisis Trilogy a go if you're down for some dark storytelling - it's about a genocidal species and their realm of space butting heads with the New Republic."
StarWarsEU,36z11b,fearsomeduckins,1 point,Sat May 23 21:09:54 2015 UTC,Pretty cool recommendation you have here with Black Fleet Crisis: fleet maneuvering talks to the Legend of Galactic Heroes/Gineiden fan in me.
StarWarsEU,36z11b,fearsomeduckins,2,Sat May 23 21:19:02 2015 UTC,"I'm just going to have to jump in here and counter this recommendation.  The black fleet crisis is one of the worst sets of star wars books I can think of, the only reason I think there is to read it is if you are set on reading absolutely everything, otherwise this is a definite skip in my opinion."

StarWarsEU,36vgwv,Sapitoelgato,2,Fri May 22 13:30:08 2015 UTC,"I didn't read the short story, but one thing about scoundrels is the larger cast.  If it helps establish that better then start there.  Granted I listened to audio book and it can be hard to keep things straight, there was still a lot going on."
StarWarsEU,36vgwv,jethroboom,2,Fri May 22 14:31:13 2015 UTC,"It doesn't matter too much. If I had to pick one, I'd say check out Winner Lose All first, since it introduces/gives a bit of background some of the characters from Scoundrels without spoiling anything, iirc."
StarWarsEU,36tdz0,TheDidact118,7,Thu May 21 23:35:59 2015 UTC,"This is my default response (for comics add legends Knights of the Old Republic)  If you plan to start reading the canon novels and comics, and want some Legends material to support it I suggest this set up of stories. I am not recommending post-Return of the Jedi stuff, due to not having read any yet:  [Legends] 1-3 Darth Bane Trilogy: Great start into the Expanded Universe, where you learn the legend of the creator of the ""Rule of Two."" You don't need prior knowledge to jump right in at this point, but there is a ton of cool stories set prior to this.  [Legends] 4 Darth Plagueis: This is an amazing bridge between the Darth Bane trilogy and the prequels. The story fills in so many gaps that The Phantom Menace only glosses over. In addition, you get an origins story to Darth Plagueis, Darth Sidious, and Darth Maul (keep in mind that Maul's origin was tweaked in The Clone Wars).  [Legends] 5/6 Shatterpoint/Dark Rendezvous: These two stories I have not read yet, but are important books to read. Shatterpoint fleshes out Mace Windu and Depa Billaba's characters, and Dark Rendezvous fleshes out Count Dooku.  [Legends] 7/8 Labyrinth of Evil / Revenge of the Sith novel: Labyrinth of Evil is a great set up story that leads straight into Revenge of the Sith, and the novelization of the movie takes the story to the next level of amazing.  [Legends] 9 Kenobi: Western story about Ben's first few weeks on Tatooine. After all the destruction in Revenge of the Sith, this story is a nice change of pace.  [Canon] 10 Lords of the Sith: Vader and Sidious trapped on a planet fighting to survive.  [Canon] 11 Tarkin: This story is a great continuation of characters and elements from Darth Plagueis, while focusing on what made Tarkin the man he grew up to become.  [Canon] 12 A New Dawn: Set 10 years before A New Hope, the novel is how Kanan meets Hera. The story is meant to introduce those characters and tease them to the readers before they saw Star Wars Rebels.  These 12 books would make a great foundation into the Star Wars universe. There are many many other great stories, but I am focusing on the time before the Original Trilogy. Others will suggest other great stories, but these are the ones I know.  Edit  To add, these retellings of the original trilogy:  http://books.disney.com/star-wars/"
StarWarsEU,36tdz0,Sapitoelgato,1 point,Thu May 21 23:55:37 2015 UTC,Interesting. I read many threads before this and everyone seemed to mention the Thrawn trilogy. Any reason why you didn't include it?
StarWarsEU,36tdz0,iRaphael,2,Fri May 22 11:59:44 2015 UTC,"1 it is on my to read list still.  2 don't know how different canon will be to those events. Everything on my list can work around canon so far, but there are little contradictions throughout."
StarWarsEU,36tdz0,Sapitoelgato,2,Fri May 22 12:19:05 2015 UTC,"That's a good list you've got going!  Here are some of my personal favorites (though I still haven't read a good portion of the EU, so there are probably some missing):   Dawn of the Jedi: Into the Void, Tim Lebbon The Old Republic: Deceived, Paul S. Kemp The Bane Trilogy, Drew Karpyshyn (Not personally a fan, but it's good Sith action.)   Path of Destruction Rule of Two Dynasty of Evil  Darth Plagueis, James Luceno Shatterpoint, Matthew Stover The Medstar Duology, Michael Reaves & Steve Perry   Battle Surgeons Jedi Healer  Dark Rendezvous, Sean Stewart Revenge of the Sith, Matthew Stover (Favorite EU novel. Anything by Stover is a must-buy!) Kenobi, John Jackson Miller Death Troopers, Joe Schreiber Scoundrels, Timothy Zahn (Along with the prequel novella, ""Winner Lose All,"" which comes with the new paperback edition.) Luke Skywalker and the Shadows of Mindor, Matthew Stover The X-wing Series, Michael Stackpole and Aaron Allston The Thrawn Series, Timothy Zahn (Essential for the EU, and a good starting point.)   Heir to the Empire Dark Force Rising The Last Command Specter of the Past Vision of the Future Outbound Flight (Technically a prequel, but I'd read this after the previous five for the best effect.)  The New Jedi Order Series   I'll be starting up on the new canon novels this summer, but I think the only one out of the bunch that I've been seeing mixed reviews about is Heir to the Jedi by Kevin Hearne. It was a book that was due to release as the third part of the Empire and Rebellion trilogy (which was enjoyable, but not essential), but ended up being held back and edited down to fit the new story.  Good luck!"
StarWarsEU,36tdz0,outbound_flight,2,Fri May 22 03:48:47 2015 UTC,"OBVIOUSLY The Thrawn Trilogy. On top of that: Outbound Flight, The Hand of Thrawn Duology, and Survivor's Quest.  Many more books too, but that's my barebones minimum."
StarWarsEU,36tdz0,PR-0927,2,Fri May 22 07:42:39 2015 UTC,"For comics, I thoroughly enjoyed KOTOR, Republic, and Legacy. Not to say the others are bad, but those three were my favorite. Also recommend the tie-ins to those series.  For books, x-wing series and Thrawn books are the obvious standouts. Lots of people talking about books already though, so I'm going to pass over it.   Games, most of them are pretty old now, so your mileage may vary. Most of them were excellent at time of release, though. TIE Fighter and KOTOR are both in my top 10 all time list. Empire at War has some really spectacular mods that bring in most of the entire Legends canon (try Phoenix Rising, it was my favorite. Bit tough on the game engine, though). Jedi Knight games, Battlefront, and Republic Commando are all quite good. I was disappointed by Force Unleashed, but lots of people liked it."

StarWarsEU,36g7tq,RVierra327,2,Tue May 19 19:53:34 2015 UTC,Do you really NEED to explain the origins of the symbol? They don't need to go into the backstory of every single thing in the universe.

Problem is that    A) Plagueis seems genuinely shocked and surprised by Anakin's existence. B) There's no point where he seems to come in contact with Shmi Skywalker, although he does have some early dealings with Gardulla the Hutt."
StarWarsEU,367s8y,DarthDonut,4,Sun May 17 00:16:05 2015 UTC,Maybe the suggestion was that Sidious learned the ability and he created Anakin?
StarWarsEU,367s8y,Zulithe,3,Sun May 17 00:27:38 2015 UTC,"In my reading of the situation, this is correct. In Revenge of the Sith, Palpatine lays out the whole ""[he was] so powerful and so wise that he could influence the midi-chlorians to create... life."" Just as he turns his head and looks directly at Anakin. To me it is clear that Palpatine learned this power from his master, and we will eventually find out the full story. Maybe he even created more lives than Anakin's. It's just that Anakin turned out more the way he was wanting."
StarWarsEU,367s8y,UbermenschIsDead,3,Sun May 17 03:18:55 2015 UTC,Especially since he states the he learned everything from his master before he killed him. Tragedy it is.
StarWarsEU,367s8y,darthstupidious,4,Sun May 17 03:52:39 2015 UTC,"I think it was implied, but not stated outright. If I'm not mistaken (I haven't read it since it first came out), a lot of the Plageuis events happen around the same time that Anakin is conceived/born, so I think we're led to believe that it was Plagueis was the one who inspired Anakin's birth, but not stated outright.   I, too, thought there there was going to be an Aha! moment near the end, but I liked the ambiguity of it all."
StarWarsEU,367s8y,Sapitoelgato,9,Sun May 17 00:21:52 2015 UTC,"Since, Lucas stated that the dark side is like a cancer to the force, and Plagueis and Sidious were working to manipulate the force create life that the force fought back in opposition, which lead to the creation of Anakin. That could explain why they didn't know about Anakin, until he came to Coruscant, and were all unsure of themselves at first. That is only my theory on it."
StarWarsEU,367s8y,Emerson73,3,Sun May 17 00:43:12 2015 UTC,This is the theory that I heard before. It seems to fit nicely and it doesn't push either Plagueis or Sidious into the realm of creating my life which keeps the characters more grounded and keeps a mystery of the nature of the force.
StarWarsEU,367s8y,Sapitoelgato,4,Sun May 17 01:01:05 2015 UTC,"Plus, it also leaves it ambiguous to what really happened. Their attempts could have also lead to nothing, but they don't know for sure. At least it keeps the force mysterious."

StarWarsEU,365z6g,hknutsen,6,Sat May 16 13:55:31 2015 UTC,"Tales of the Jedi is okay, I think. It was written early in the Expanded Universe. I would read them, then move on to the much (in my opinion) better series, Knights of the Old Republic, which I consider one of the better stories in the entirety of the Expanded Universe. Some of the backstory from Tales carries over into Knights (the story of Exar Kun and the Mandalorians, the repercussions of the Sith War, etc)  Knight Errant is a good series too, but it's set much later in the timeline (between 2000 BBY and 1000 BBY).   I have no opinion on the Old Republic MMO comic tie-ins - they're fine but nothing noteworthy. Not really missing much unless you ever decide to play the MMO and want some extra backstory.  Keep in mind these stories are currently non-canon - I see them as in limbo. It's possible they could be reintroduced into the canon in the future. But that doesn't detract from them as good tales."

The Aing-Tii monks could use flowwalking to perceive and alter (in a personal sense) what had happened subjectively, and it was intimated that the Aing-Tii monks with their 'rainbow of colors' in their idea of the Force might be able to do more than just perceive."
StarWarsEU,35xmfl,SenseiZarn,3,Thu May 14 17:29:09 2015 UTC,"Time travel (from Starwars wikia):       The term time travel describes the concept of moving between different points in time, either traveling from the present to the future without experiencing the intervening period, or shifting backward in time to the past. Time travel was a rare phenomenon, but it was achieved on several occasions, mostly by accident. The known incidents mostly involved people or objects traveling to the future,    however, several occurrences of time travel to the past were also documented. Though most variations of time travel were discovered accidentally, at least one method of traveling to the future at a seemingly faster rate was widely known in the galaxy. Time dilation—though not strictly defined as time traveling, as there was no actual ""skipping"" over any period in time—was a phenomena that caused time to flow differently for two observers due to them being in relative motion to each other. This way, a period of time that lasted several hours from one person's point of view could take days and even years from the other person's perspective. Because of the high velocity of hyperspace travel, time dilation was a common side-effect of it, and the ship traveling in hyperspace would normally move forward in time faster than the rest of the galaxy. To counteract this effect, relativistic shielding was installed aboard hyperspace-capable starships, which aligned the hyperspace-traveling object's time perception with that of the outside world. The shielding, however, was not perfect and could malfunction in some rare cases, leaving the person inside the starship open to the effects of time dilation.  As an extension of the above effect of hyperspace, a malfunctioning hyperdrive could open an unstable hyperspace tunnel leading to another time frame,  and even to a different part of the galaxy.  In addition to hyperspace travel, time dilation could be achieved by entering a large mass of black holes with high gravitational fields, such as the ones that formed the Tyus Cluster. Provided that the traveler survived the dangerous trip, he could virtually emerge from the anomaly at any future time period, as time moved very fast at the center of the mass, to the point that it appeared not to exist at all.  There were also several items that allowed time travel. The Darkstaff was a powerful and seemingly sentient Sith artifact, which power could be possessed by a Force-sensitive to create a Force storm leading to another time period.  Another artifact, the Orb of Passage, was implied to control the flow of time; it was discovered on the planet Benja-Rihn and kept by the Jedi Order.  Finally, it was rumored that the Jerni civilization used the so-called Eternity Crystal to reset the timeline in case of a major crisis.

StarWarsEU,35rp3e,Numerous1,3,Wed May 13 19:44:52 2015 UTC,"It depends on what your definition of ""Young Adult"" books are. No Star Wars book is particularly complex or difficult, but they are definiteily worth reading. Here are how I categorize the different good styles of Star Wars books   Easy, fun, simple : these are the books that you can just unplug and enjoy. They are simple, but fun. Example : Darth Bane books. The books that are really well written : some of the books can still be pretty straightforward but written very well. These books are super enjoyable and sometimes have interesting situations that are worth thinking about. Examples : Thrawn Trilogy and Thrawn duology The books that make you think : there are some books that are surprisingly interesting or philosophical and that let you see/think about different situations from different points of view. Example : Legacy of the Force series. People will judge it pretty harshly, and the ending is kind of weak, but the series poses really interesting questions concerning family/bloodlines, internment of citizens (makes me think of WWII Japanese-Americans), state's rights, nepotism/bending the rules for someone you know, and the road to Hell being paved with the best intentions."
StarWarsEU,35rp3e,Snorhax,2,Wed May 13 01:23:09 2015 UTC,I agreed with almost everything there except I would replace Legecy of the Force as a thinking book with a better one like Traitor.

StarWarsEU,35rp3e,darthstupidious,1 point,Fri May 15 02:46:03 2015 UTC,"Fully agree with your thoughts about LOTF, from this post and your original.   I think the ending was very weak (wasn't a fan at all of Daala becoming head honcho of the GA, and the rushed Jacen/Imperial finale), and I think the series definitely peaked with the fifth book, but it definitely did address a lot of cool things. I thought it was cool to take the beloved hero of the NJO and turn him into a villain that the audience could sympathize with and even root for, as opposed to the pretty one-sided, comically evil villains that the EU was known for.   I really enjoyed LOTF, but thought that the followup (FOTJ) was a major disappointment and a pretty poor way to wrap up the Legends series."

Its good they scrapped it in a way because now they have the freedom to do what they need, but they can also bring back some awesome characters/ settings/ etc. Like if they brought back Thrawn I'd be very excited.

In the new Leia comics Ackbar is a leading member of the Alliance military at the Yavin base, yet he makes no appearance in the movie.   Likewise, the existance of B-wings and A-wings before the battle of Yavin begs the question - why were they never used before Endor?   I get that they're trying to establish new things, but these kinds of leaps in logic were precisely the issue with the old canon."
StarWarsEU,35ex70,CT-1138,3,Tue May 12 04:33:11 2015 UTC,Actually old cannon was kind of better. I mean in the old EU no one or ships showed up before they did in the movies
StarWarsEU,35ex70,Leninator,1 point,Tue May 12 18:06:53 2015 UTC,I like to believe that there were multiple Rebel bases and operations going on in the galaxy at the same time. It makes sense to me that Ackbar and B-Wings were not in the Battle of Yavin simply because its easy for me to assess that they were not available at the time. Ackbar was elsewhere and it X-Wings were best for the assault or all they had at the time.
StarWarsEU,35ex70,stegasp,1 point,Thu May 28 08:41:09 2015 UTC,"But the new canon establishes Ackbar as being at the battle of Yavin.

Because I was really excited to here that it could easily fit into my old EU collection since it doesn't contradict the old stuff. But then I heard it mentions Ahsoka who I don't consider canon to the Legends universe so adding that into my personal collection would cause some problems?

StarWarsEU,35ex70,woodenbiplane,3,Sat May 9 21:52:13 2015 UTC,"Well mostly it's not that I don't like her, I just don't think she fits into the timeline. I consider her canon to the Disney universe but not the Legends universe as she isn't mentioned literally anywhere else which shouldn't be the case if she spent most of the war alongside Anakin. Most of the EU makes no indication whatsoever that Anakin had a Padawan during the Clone Wars and IMO it kinda messes with his character. He's not suppose to be the responsible one who can take care of a Padawan. By Episode III, he's still the brash and arrogant person who seems like they should have way more experience before taking a Padawan under their belt. Not to mention that the TCW show in general contradicts some of the stuff in Legends so I don't think it should be considered to have happened in that universe."

StarWarsEU,35ds2s,FabricateReality,4,Sat May 9 15:42:00 2015 UTC,"Completely agreed. ""Star By Star"" is full of so many freaking outstanding moments (the fall of Coruscant, Anakin's death, Numa Rar's death by vornskr voxyn, the asshat Borsk Fey'lya going down with the ship, Jacen being left behind, etc.).   I also love ""Traitor"" almost as much.

It's from the a second Battle of Borleias, where Wedge lures the Vong to the surface before subjecting them to an orbital bombardment by a Star Destroyer. It's great for so many reasons: Wedge's ingenuity; the Vong being logically unprepared for a tactic from the long-dead Empire; being a big f-yeah victory right after the Fall of Coruscant; and the surprise element to the reader.  Also, it's set up with this:  Wedge: ""We're going to face them with an enemy they've never had the displeasure of fighting. We're going to hit them with the Empire.""  Tycho: ""They're not going to like the Empire."""

StarWarsEU,35ds2s,Rogue_3,6,Mon May 11 18:26:42 2015 UTC,"I completely agree with your choices. I really disliked Banner at first (which I guess was maybe the point). But I loved his transformation and the way he just showed up trying to help Jacen. Total redemption story.  Corran has always been one of my favorite EU characters. His beginnings in CorSec and then an integral part of Rogue Squadron really invested me in his story. His duel in NJO was epic, and his last move to finish it was awesome. I'd love to see that on the big screen (pipe dream, I know). I can't imagine his anguish when the Vong destroyed the planet anyway.  The assault on the voxyn cloning lab was good too. It had a very Dirty Dozen/Magnificent Seven/Suicide Squad feel to it. Anakin's death and Jacen's capture heightened the emotion and almost made the mission not worth the sacrifice. Especially considering post-NJO events."
StarWarsEU,35ds2s,AUS_Doug,6,Sat May 9 16:58:25 2015 UTC,"Oh god, so many to choose from.    The entirety of the Borleias campaign was brilliant, but particularly when Czulkang Lah realised how he'd been bested, and gave his son the best ""I'm not angry, just disappointed"" speech ever. The Jedi/Wraith mission to Coruscant; That was super fun. Mara owning Nom Anor, and actually hoping she'd lose control for just a second and kill him. Luke, Jaina & Jacen fighting in the Citadel; Ignoring that the previously invincible slayers were now killable, that was brilliant.   Many of my other favourites (Horn vs. Shedao Shai, Operation Emperor's Hammer, parts of Traitor) have already been mentioned, so I'll cut to what are my two favourite of my favourite moments.   “I know something about pain you don’t,” she said. “Pain drowns other people. I just swim in it.”   Coupled with how good those books were generally, that quote from Tahiri probably cements the Enemy Lines books as my favourite from the NJO.   “What name did she choose?” Luke asked.  “She still calls herself Tahiri, but—” Leia stopped suddenly, her eyes narrowing as she studied her brother.   “Don’t tell me you knew what was going to happen to her.”  “I suspected,” Luke said. “I thought she just needed time to work things out—and the opportunity to prove herself.”   Reunion was probably my least favourite of the Force Heretic Trilogy - It wasn't bad (I felt that the Zonama Sekot stuff was a bit weak, though balanced by the Awesome-Pellaeon factor at the Battle of Esfandia) just not as good as the others - but Tahiri coming through like she did was my favourite part of it.  EDIT: Missed a pretty important word in the 'Mara v Nom Anor' bit."

StarWarsEU,35ds2s,roninjedi,3,Sun May 10 05:16:31 2015 UTC,"The battle at Ebaq 9 was my favorite. The piloting, the trap making, jacen holding in a oxygen bubble till he could be rescued. Corrans fight was good but I like his rescue mission where he uses his energy absorbtion by burning his arm with a light saber. Ohh and of course there is luke loosing all of his clothes after he dives into some kind of Bio junk while on Vong occupied Coruscant."
StarWarsEU,35ds2s,the_gv3,3,Sat May 9 18:09:41 2015 UTC,"Top moment has to be Ganner's Last Stand.  It is just such an epic moment and such an epic universe.  I don't like using the word epic, but I feel that it really fits in this instance.  Ganner's redemption in this moment really seems to fit.  He is so selfish his whole life, full of pride and arrogance, and it takes a hopeless situation to get him out of it.  I don't think he would have full redeemed himself outside of a hopeless situation, but he also could have just folded and tried to run anyways.  Other top moments are the whole assault on the Voxyn Lair.  Great scenes that are thrilling and suspenseful.  Sad to see Anakin go, but I feel that it was well written.  Corran Horn's duel with...Shedao Shai?  Is that who it was?  Great battle, I really enjoyed that.  Some of the other battles and scenes were also a lot of fun to read.  In particular I am thinking of the attempted escape off the prison planet where three aliens with incredible memories were memorizing a code or layout to help with a rescue.  I believe only one escapes?  Not even close to Ganner's Last Stand, but a riveting moment in the NJO series nonetheless."

It does seem anything beyond that is conjecture until further information is provided.

The model was first introduced by Swiss psychiatrist Elisabeth Kübler-Ross in her 1969 book, On Death and Dying, and was inspired by her work with terminally ill patients.  Motivated by the lack of curriculum in medical schools on the subject of death and dying, Kübler-Ross examined death and those faced with it at the University of Chicago medical school. Kübler-Ross' project evolved into a series of seminars which, along with patient interviews and previous research, became the foundation for her book. Since the publication of ""On Death and Dying"", the Kübler-Ross model has become accepted by the general public; however, its validity is not consistently supported by the majority of research. [citation needed]  Kübler-Ross noted that the stages are not a complete list of all possible emotions, and can occur in any order, and that not everyone who experiences a life-threatening or life-altering event feels all five of the responses.

Episode VII already invalidated the Thrawn series, which means everything that was written afterward has been compromised. The entire EU leaned on those books, building away from them and building toward them. Removing them didn't spare a whole lot.  I look at the Legends EU as a big jumble of Legos, now in a big colorful pile. Authors can pick up pieces and throw them back into this new thing they're building, but they won't be where they were before, or what they were before.

StarWarsEU,357hca,MoreCowbellNow,6,Fri May 8 03:00:19 2015 UTC,"I think you're right about all the causes you cited - those are at least implicit reasons why Luke 'passes' his trainees to Knights so quickly. But thte major, explicit reason, the one Luke thinks about a lot, is that he's the only Jedi at that point. He needs to quickly form a core group of Jedi that are at least competent enough to help him lead the NJO. He doesn't want to be the only person with knowledge of Jedi skills/philosophy, so he's taking a few shortcuts (but still only passing them to Knight, not Master, so he's still in charge and letting them know they've got a ways to go).  I also don't think that Luke would support the idea of taking children away from their families at birth to train them. Can't remember if he ever mentions it specifically, but I'd think that his experience - as someone who grew up without his parents and was lied to about his family for his whole life by Jedi/at the Jedi's request - would turn him off of that. Also since he's obviously a pretty successful Jedi without being trained since birth, he knows it's not as necessary as the old Order thought."
StarWarsEU,357hca,darthideous,2,Thu May 7 20:32:45 2015 UTC,Good points. Yeah it's definitely a looser Jedi order than the old which doesn't seem have the problems the old jedi were worried about if they loosened the rules. I read recently that Qui Gon Jinn was pretty non-traditional and had differing philosophies than the council and that after the Purge Yoda felt that Qui Gon had been right about the living force. Maybe Ben and Yoda changed their own thoughts on training Jedi before Luke's training. If they still felt that the traditional way was best I imagine that they would have just trained Luke and Leia on Dagobah at a young age. Maybe I'm reading into it too much
StarWarsEU,357hca,Soleless_one,3,Thu May 7 21:41:14 2015 UTC,"At the beginning, Luke's knowledge of old training techniques was extremely minimal, plus the need for new Jedi required him to train his original class very quickly. Only 3 of his first 12 were knighted after only a year, and Kyp never really became a ""good"" Jedi until the Vong War. Eventually he did start training Jedi as kids, as in the Swarm War, and it took Jaina over 15 years to become a Master after her knighting. The training definitely became more like the old order as more knowledge and experienced trainers became masters."

After all Anakin Skywalker was the chosen one and it took him somewhere around 11 years of training to become a knight. I think the way they were trained has to be different or something.  How does Corran being a part time student account for him progressing so quickly as well? I feel like it would prolong his training.

The moniker of Knight also doesn't make one impervious to temptation or evil (look at the Masters Dooku or C'Boath) but it does mean mastering the skills, philosophy and moral compass enough to operate autonomously.

StarWarsEU,3542h6,OtakuMecha,1 point,Wed May 6 23:16:38 2015 UTC,"SotE wasn't a direct adaption of the novel. Basically, the novel, comic and game all told different parts of the same story. To quote Wookieepedia:   ""While each part of the project can be enjoyed on its own, fans will need to collect several items in order to fully experience the adventure since certain elements from each part of the story do not overlap and are described only in another part. The novel tells the overall story, focusing on the main characters. The comic book series focuses on bounty hunter Boba Fett's battle to keep possession of the frozen Han Solo. The video game allows players to control new character Dash Rendar, whose adventures in the game weave in and out of the overall storyline."""
StarWarsEU,3542h6,KamSolusar,3,Thu May 7 06:03:31 2015 UTC,"Darth Bane had a comic first (Jedi vs Sith) that they included in the first two novels, with modifications. The events of the comic show up at the tail end of the first book and the beginning of the second."
StarWarsEU,3542h6,Sapitoelgato,2,Wed May 6 23:21:59 2015 UTC,"The Bane novels also made some retcons to the original story, such as the Rule of Two now being something that Bane borrowed from Revan instead of his own idea. Of course the Bane novel was also written by the head writer of KOTOR, and Revan is to him what Thrawn or Mara Jade are to Tim Zahn, so I think that might have had something to do with it. Every writer has his or her ""favorite child"" so to speak."
StarWarsEU,3542h6,Sanguiluna,1 point,Thu May 7 14:53:23 2015 UTC,"Revan inspired the idea with his ""one master and one apprentice"" philosophy, but the idea for only two Sith in the entire galaxy was Bane's.

StarWarsEU,34y242,Leninator,7,Tue May 5 14:44:44 2015 UTC,"To be honest it really isn't covered too in depth by the Legends in that regard - Some of the X-Wing Rogue Squadron comics talk about Sate Pestage and his conflict with the Imperial Advisors and Ysanne Isard, but that's about the best I can come up with on the Imperial side. The early X-Wing books touch on it, and maybe Truce At Bakura might be worth a read if Imperial-Rebel relations are interesting to you. Ultimately, in my experience the Legends universe doesn't speak up a whole lot about the dissolution of the Empire and founding of the New Republic."
StarWarsEU,34y242,drewsoft,3,Tue May 5 15:12:33 2015 UTC,"Damn, woulda made for a cool GoT kinda thing in the old legends.   I've ordered the first couple of X-Wing books and comics, and I'll give them a read.   Thanks!"
StarWarsEU,34y242,howlingchief,6,Wed May 6 02:04:21 2015 UTC,"Truce at Bakura starts with the rebels still based on Endor after their victory there.

StarWarsEU,34y242,tacomcnacho,2,Tue May 5 18:28:17 2015 UTC,"Hmm, the best match to what you're asking would be the Thrawn trilogy, honestly. It's not set immediately after Endor - 5 years after - but it does provide insight into the imperial thought process after their loss. But surely you've read the Thrawn Trilogy if you're at all interested in SW literature.  The Hand of Thrawn duology deals with the Empire coming to terms with the fact that they have lost years later. It was very interesting."

StarWarsEU,34y71y,HobbieK,5,Tue May 5 19:20:10 2015 UTC,"If you plan to start reading the canon novels and comics, and want some Legends material to support it I suggest this set up of stories. I am not recommending post-Return of the Jedi stuff, due to not having read any yet:  [Legends] 1-3 Darth Bane Trilogy: Great start into the Expanded Universe, where you learn the legend of the creator of the ""Rule of Two."" You don't need prior knowledge to jump right in at this point, but there is a ton of cool stories set prior to this.  [Legends] 4 Darth Plagueis: This is an amazing bridge between the Darth Bane trilogy and the prequels. The story fills in so many gaps that The Phantom Menace only glosses over. In addition, you get an origins story to Darth Plagueis, Darth Sidious, and Darth Maul (keep in mind that Maul's origin was tweaked in The Clone Wars).  [Legends] 5/6 Shatterpoint/Dark Rendezvous: These two stories I have not read yet, but are important books to read. Shatterpoint fleshes out Mace Windu and Depa Billaba's characters, and Dark Rendezvous fleshes out Count Dooku.  [Legends] 7/8 Labyrinth of Evil / Revenge of the Sith novel: Labyrinth of Evil is a great set up story that leads straight into Revenge of the Sith, and the novelization of the movie takes the story to the next level of amazing.  [Legends] 9 Kenobi: Western story about Ben's first few weeks on Tatooine. After all the destruction in Revenge of the Sith, this story is a nice change of pace.  [Canon] 10 Lords of the Sith: Vader and Sidious trapped on a planet fighting to survive.  [Canon] 11 Tarkin: This story is a great continuation of characters and elements from Darth Plagueis, while focusing on what made Tarkin the man he grew up to become.  [Canon] 12 A New Dawn: Set 10 years before A New Hope, the novel is how Kanan meets Hera. The story is meant to introduce those characters and tease them to the readers before they saw Star Wars Rebels.  These 12 books would make a great foundation into the Star Wars universe. There are many many other great stories, but I am focusing on the time before the Original Trilogy. Others will suggest other great stories, but these are the ones I know."

StarWarsEU,34y71y,tacomcnacho,3,Tue May 5 22:35:30 2015 UTC,"Here are the must-read Star Wars books that are even better than the films:   The Thrawn Trilogy [Timothy Zahn]   -Set 5 years after the Battle of Endor, what was supposed to be a ""mopping up operation"" of the Empire's forces quickly turns into another full fledged war for the New Republic when Grand Admiral Thrawn returns from deep space to lead the Empire into a new era under his leadership. Thrawn is one of the greatest villains in the history of science fiction due to his strategic brilliance, perfect memory, and seemingly omnipotent nature. The old gang is back, of course. Luke is wiser and stronger, Leia and Han are married and expecting twins, as well as a few new faces that bring a lot to the SW universe.   -Simply put, this is my favorite book trilogy of all time and for good reason. You will not be disappointed.  -I highly recommend grabbing the 20th anniversary audiobook version because the voice actor is incredible. Many people are surprised to learn that it was only one actor and not the original voices. It's all on youtube   The Darth Bane Trilogy [Drew Karpyshyn]   -Written by the lead writer for KOTOR and the Mass Effect trilogy, this book series reshaped Sith philosophy into the most badass thing it could possibly be. Now, you're probably thinking ""philosophy? Sound's boring,"" right? Wrong. This is an action book with an amazing plot. But it also introduces the Rule of Two: The principle introduced by Darth Revan and restored by Darth Bane that at any given time there may only be two Sith; no more, no less. If you've ever wanted a Star Wars story with a darker tone, this is definitely it.    -This is an Old Republic book so don't expect to recognize any characters you know from the films.    Darth Plageus [James Luceno]   -More politics and subterfuge than action like the above two, this book delves into the planning of the usurpation of the Republic and the purge of the Jedi Order by Darth Plageus and his apprentice... Palpatine. It also explains the origins of Darth Maul and his early apprenticeship to Palpatine. This book makes the prequel trilogy seem much, much cooler. It was extremely interesting seeing how all the plans were set in motion. A slower read, but nevertheless a high quality book.  Other great reads:    Tarkin  (the first canon SW novel after the Disney takeover) Kenobi I, Jedi The Truce at Bakura Outbound Flight* Allegiance* Hand of Thrawn Duology* Survivor's Quest* Deceived Crucible**   *Part of a story arc. Should be read in a certain order.  **Requires foreknowledge of characters and universe developments in the set time period.  Hope this helped!"
StarWarsEU,34y71y,postoasties,2,Wed May 6 04:27:24 2015 UTC,Just a note.  The Plagueis audiobook read by Daniel Davis is probably one of the best audiobook productions I've come across; outstanding.

StarWarsEU,34vulv,Shaggy9342,3,Mon May 4 23:58:47 2015 UTC,"Nice work. Obviously spoiler filled but it gives a good overview of the Chosen One, although I think it's worth noting that 'balance' of the Force has multiple interpretations.  Taken from the Star Wars wiki:   The idea of balance of the Force, a central tenet of the Jedi Order, referred to the ideal state in which the Force existed in nature, namely as the light side. According to Jedi dogma, the presence of the dark side corrupted and destroyed this natural balance, and the Jedi viewed it as their duty to restore it.   Which is actually a contradiction of the balance you presented, namely light and dark must coexist to form a balance.  It's interesting reading about George Lucas's own interpretation of what constituted balance, he seemed to change his mind about what the true balance actually meant.    If balance truly meant a combination of both the Light and Dark sides of the Force, it clearly means the Jedi were wrong and ended up either directly or indirectly causing their own downfall."
StarWarsEU,34vulv,tunnel-snakes-rule,2,Tue May 5 02:40:39 2015 UTC,And one concept I've never really understood. What kind of messed up metaphysical energy field demands the coexistence of both selfless monks and evil despots? Perhaps the Force may be going through metapause and the story of Star Wars is just the result of its mood swings.
StarWarsEU,34vulv,Praxada,2,Sun May 10 06:38:54 2015 UTC,"This was really excellent, and a great first topic too. I would love to see you do one on the relationship between life and the force.

You should strip out the Rakata, and add something about how Anakin was possibly created from Darth Pleagus and Episode 1.  I don't remember where it is, but someone also first knew about the prophecy from somewhere.    I'm also not sure where you are going with the part on Cadeus, so that should be explained further on your belief of why that fulfills the balance, or keep the focus on Anakin.

StarWarsEU,34rk8u,timscheller95,4,Mon May 4 02:19:06 2015 UTC,"First off, I hope Aftermath doesn't try to cover too much. The 30-ish years between Jedi and TFA offers so much storytelling potential that I don't want them to box themselves in. One thing I would like to see, if it fits with the new story, is something like Rogue Squadron that details the Rebellion taking Coruscant. That has to be an important milestone.

StarWarsEU,34n97s,ConBro8,9,Sat May 2 18:36:12 2015 UTC,"The official stance is that it's canon only where it coincides with the film. I actually JUST wrote a seminar paper about this, in which I argue that the new canon policy strips the film novelizations of all narratological validity, since it basically just reduces them to ""paper-and-ink clones"" of the films instead of adaptational works of their own merit. In addition, there's also a fundamental logical flaw with Lucasfilm's policy:  1) During the novel's creation, George Lucas personally line-edited Matt Stover's manuscript before it was approved, meaning that everything that ended up in that book is there because Lucas wanted it, and anything that isn't is not there because Lucas wanted it out.  2) If you read Lucas's actual screenplay, then watch the film and read the novel, you'll see that those scenes Lucas cut from his film because of time constraints, he had Stover keep in there. Meaning that in order to experience Lucas's complete narrative, you'd have to both watch the film and read the novel. Watching the film or reading the novel alone only gives a fraction of the complete Episode III narrative."

This was the one thing I wish LucasArts had covered during the buyout event, because if they constructed the new canon around the idea that anything George Lucas had a hand in creating was included, Stover's novel should technically qualify. Same with Darth Plagueis, which was probably the only other novel that had a lot of oversight from Lucas."

It's a shame that the extra stuff isn't canon.  There's nothing in them that fundamentally changes the stories but they do enhance the stories.

StarWarsEU,34n0xr,dorkofnight,6,Sat May 2 17:23:40 2015 UTC,"I was also disappointed.  I did like the assassination plot and watching it unfold.  The destruction of the Perilous was cool.  The book shined when Vader was being a badass.  But yeah there was too much else going on I didn't really care about.  So far I don't think any of the books have lived up to Legends material.  They all feel very self-contained and small.  It feels like the Story Group is saving the best stuff for the films, which I get, but it seems like the books just don't get to tell a lot of new story.  Also we know going into Lords of the Sith basically how it will end.  Obviously Vader and the Emperor survive.  So it's hard to get too invested."

StarWarsEU,34n0xr,Riceatron,3,Sun May 3 04:46:16 2015 UTC,True.  I am definitely more excited for Aftermath than any other new book so far.
StarWarsEU,34n0xr,Damonstration,2,Sun May 3 05:35:00 2015 UTC,"I think they're avoiding the post-RotJ era for the same reason they de-canonized the old EU: to give the new films breathing room. It's just like the prequels, how we didn't start getting prequel era novels until after Episode II.  Personally I think if Del Rey wants to break new ground with their new canon, they should explore the Legacy era (centuries after the films). The old EU only did a few comic series, so the era's still relatively untouched."
StarWarsEU,34n0xr,Sanguiluna,2,Sun May 3 13:22:45 2015 UTC,Nobody but the Story Group and those working on the films know what The Force Awakens is bringing to the table. I bet it won't be for a few years until we start seeing book only series akin to Darth Bane or the Solo/Skywalker Kids stories.  Maybe they'll touch the prequel era again in a way that wasn't done before.
StarWarsEU,34n0xr,Riceatron,3,Sun May 3 16:00:00 2015 UTC,It agree that the Perilous going down was great. The scenes of Vader striding through the dying ship were great. But then there was 3 more chapters of people talking about things I don't care about and characters I didn't care about.  We just need a book called Vader and the Emperor Fight and Kill Everything. lol
StarWarsEU,34n0xr,legendarymoonrabbit,6,Sat May 2 20:12:12 2015 UTC,"I enjoyed the book. I was initially a bit disappointed as well, but I realized that it was because of the foregone conclusion. Just sit back and enjoy the story. I did, however, feel that the ending felt a bit rushed. It would have been nice to see what happens to Mors.  It was fun seeing the Emperor and Vader out of their element while in the village. Palpatine felt like his old Clone Wars era Chancellor self again... and then he shows his true Sith colours and has Vader kill them all :(  Overall, Sidious is the highlight of the book. He, like the reader, knows how the story will turn out. He's never in any real danger and he seems to be having a gay old time going on an old fashioned adventure with his apprentice, watching his subordinates run around panicking, and bullying Orn Free Taa. He's having the time of his life, not having to always be his Palpatine self publicly. Despite still hiding his full power while in the public view, his Darth Sidious persona leaks out when he just stands there with his hood on and smiles evilly, reveling in his minions' fear."
StarWarsEU,34n0xr,HuntedGopher,1 point,Sat May 2 20:32:40 2015 UTC,"I agree with you about Palpatine - hands down, the best parts of the book. I just wish there had been more of it."
StarWarsEU,34n0xr,matty25,7,Sun May 3 17:36:29 2015 UTC,"I loved the book. It really delved into the relationship between Vader and papa palpatine- we see why Vader follows him so fanatically. Also, I thought the writing that developed the assassination plot was wonderful- you found yourself rooting for both sides simultaneously, even though we know the overall conclusion.   I think it's important to remember these first few books seem to be focusing on character development and nature as opposed to overall plot. Which is fine, because I think a lot more plot is filling in then we think it is. We re looking too much for hints from legends. These stories are stand alone, but they are also impactful. This story shows a lot about the start of  rebellion if you pay attention.   Also, the moral dilemmas evident throughout the book were brilliant. Terrorism vs freedom fighting. Sacrifice the few to save the many. They were wonderfully placed directly in the story and narrative."
StarWarsEU,34n0xr,matty25,1 point,Sun May 3 00:27:28 2015 UTC,"I did see that the rebellion was starting. But I didn't really read it to get that. I guess I'm still thinking of the non-canon works now that already showed us this.   But it is exactly the relationship between Vader and Palpatine I came for. Those were my favorite chapters. And yes, we certainly saw why Palpatine is a great Sith. But for me, those chapters were lost in a sea of characters who wouldn't last beyond this story (with maybe the exception of Cham)."
StarWarsEU,34n0xr,roninjedi,3,Sun May 3 17:40:57 2015 UTC,"The first half of the book was great. Vader killing the Twi'leks while their friends listened, Cham using Belkor, the destruction of the Perilous. I thought it was on with a manhunt and a final showdown between Cham's guerrilla forces and Vader and the Emperor.   But then the second half of the book was a dud. The creatures (can't remember their names) really become heavily involved and I just found them to be so boring. And the showdown I was hoping for didn't really happen. It was a much smaller force than what Cham should have had. I mean the whole time I'm thinking he has like a dozen men or so? That's not even close to enough to fight Vader and the Emperor. He should have had a couple of hundred men looking for them and then it would have been interesting. And then when they do find them it's a silly moral argument instead of an actual showdown.   As for some secondary plots, I liked the Belkor and Mors story at first, I thought it was a great tie in to how the Twi'leks were able to kick so much ass. But they flip the script on each character much too quickly. One second Belkor is careful and intelligent and the next he's raging mad. Mors is a spice addicted Hutt in human form and the next thing you know she leads an effective rescue mission.   Also, Orn Free Taa is heavily featured in the beginning chapters and then he's not heard from. I though for sure he would meet his demise or at least face some sort of wrath at some point but he just kind of vanishes.  TL;DR-- This book had the potential to be really, really good but the last half of the book missed the mark with inconsequential and uninteresting storytelling. The stellar first half props the book up to a degree but overall it's pretty mediocre."
StarWarsEU,34n0xr,roninjedi,1 point,Tue May 12 22:55:46 2015 UTC,My TL;DR - too many characters. No clear focus.

There are some other books in that time period (3-19 aby) that you might want to read. I read Planet of Twilight, Crystal Star, Darksaber, and Children of the Jedi.

StarWarsEU,34mqr5,PictureofPoritrin,2,Sat May 2 19:15:05 2015 UTC,"The Han Solo Adventures take place before A New Hope.  The Jedi Academy Trilogy takes place about 7 years after Return of the Jedi.  The Hand of Thrawn Duology takes place about 15 or 16 years after Return of the Jedi.  You can read the Han Solo Adventures kind of irrespective of order to the rest of the Old EU.  I would recommend reading the Heir to the Empire Trilogy (the Thrawn trilogy; 5 years after Return of the Jedi) before hitting the Jedi Academy Trilogy.  You might also want to consult the Wookieepedia about the Dark Empire series (graphic novels), which take place between the Thrawn Trilogy and the Jedi Academy Trilogy unless you want to spend the money.    Also, you will very likely find at least the Thrawn Trilogy at your local library.  When I started reading the EU in 1997, that is where I was getting them.  There is a lot to be said for borrowing and reading; it is lovely to have a library, but space and funds are a limited thing.  A lot of the more recent Old EU books have a chronology inside the front cover, which is incredibly helpful, although I think those go from time after A New Hope (so, my numbers above but add four years).  The books you have purchased almost certainly do not have that.  I think the stuff published after 1999 has that (Vector Prime from the New Jedi Order and beyond in terms of publication date).  Plug for the Stackpole and Allston X-Wing series.  Of the Old EU stuff I read when I was younger, those were some of my favorites.  I am a serious force/Jedi kind of person, and those surprised me in how entertaining they were given how little the mysticism plays into them compared to other series."

The Force disruption thing also made no sense and came out of nowhere and has been used before. The book didn't have many character, and the characters who were involved were just on some bullshit mission. The whole time everything was all dark and brooding for no real reason.   Finally, if you have a book deal in an established universe for one book, you don't just go and introduce some crazy new concept like interdimensional things that have never come up before or again. And you certainly don't take weird, nondescript beings from said dimensions and have them do butt stuff with the main character. Waru was poorly defined, had powers (or anti powers) that made no sense. The ""Final Battle,"" if it can even me called that, was more bizarre dimension bending where the main characters now comes inside of the main villain (if it can be called that) and saves his sister of I remember correctly from the oozing, flowing, jizz river inside Waru's gold-plated body. Then he just like disappears or something, never to be spoken of again, and all is K.  That sounds fucking horrible, and I didn't really go out of my way to do not. The book is bad."

Promoted to Master 1 year into the clone wars and commissioned as a general in the Grand Army. Survived Order 66 and went on to aid the Rebellion heavily. He hid his lightsaber, (still carried it, and used it only when necessary.) and used skills picked up during the Clone Wars including building his own explosives, and maintaining and using many types of blaster pistols. Became a master in the New Jedi Order after the Galactic Civil War.    Physically, (circa Empire Strikes Back) about 50 years of age, in exellent shape, given his work for the Rebellion.   Mastered lightsaber forms I - V.   Force Ability: Mastered the art of Telepathy, taking it from the basic mind trick to hiding his true appearance from others. He used this ability to take on the guise of a cocky smuggler. Also highly skilled in tutaminus, the force repulse ability, and produced the strongest force barriers of his day.    Armament: His lightsaber was of nonstandard design. It was a blue bladed saberstaff with a hilt that was of standard length for a single. (extra points for those who know whose saber this is based on!) As a Rebel agent, he carried a Naboo guard pistol (designation not known to me), and a commando pistol (Those of you who played Republic Commando will know what I mean), a DL-44 Heavy blaster pistol, and a Mandalorian Ripper."

Ben & Tahiri are hunting Vestara Khai. No threat to the people of the Galaxy as a whole, but one group has a bone to pick with the Jedi. (Not an original idea I know.)

The Neti master's arrival is met with joy and confusion, as Master Saa asserts that the Force roused her from her hibernation to teach these students, as the destiny of all life was bound to them.  My idea was to essentially recreate the Clone Wars Force priestesses with morally ambiguous outcasts using the stereotypical inspirational teacher in a strict school setting.

Canonically we don't know who owns or operates it, only that it took off from Mos Eisley a few hours before the Millennium Falcon in 0 ABY.  Now, the fact that this set has the Lucasfilm and Disney labels on it is noteworthy, and it could have been reviewed by the Lucasfilm Story Group. Does that make it canon? No. Pablo Hidalgo explained at Celebration that the story group's credit should not be taken as a stamp of canonicity, because they review non-canon works like The Old Republic as well. When they review something non-canon, what they are doing is checking for authenticity: does this thing seem authentically Star Wars?

StarWarsEU,34empq,namer98,1 point,Thu Apr 30 15:42:22 2015 UTC,"I would say that the reasoning behind not doing as you suggest would be, hypocritically speaking (as a Jedi), fear of Korriban.  I am guessing that the Council would fear any lesser Jedi might be corrupted by the Dark Side aura of the planet if they tried to set up shop there to any extent.  They would also need some of the ""lesser"" Jedi to be there in order to do that, as they couldn't just relocate a section of the council there permanently.  Not to mention swaying the planet towards the light after thousands of years of Dark Side corruption would likely be a lot of work/time/Jedi-power.  In terms of exploring Korriban to find the identity of the Sith Lord, I am forgetting exactly how the Clone Wars arc went, but with everything else going on it would be difficult to devote too much time on searching an entire planet for a Sith Lord that isn't on Korriban.  If they knew they could go talk to Sith ghosts about it and figure out who it was that way, then sure, they should have done that sooner.  I would also imagine that the Jedi would have had some sort of probe or sensor to detect movement around Korriban to see if anyone was coming or leaving.  If they didn't at least have that, then they made a huge mistake there."
StarWarsEU,34empq,the_gv3,3,Thu Apr 30 15:58:53 2015 UTC,"I absolutely agree that it would take an abundance of resources to make Korriban hospitable for any force sensitive, lesser or greater Jedi alike, however it could've proven worth it. Think about it, if they had close control of the sith homeworld they would potentially gain an advantage over anyone trying to learn the dark side. With the lack of Sith masters available to be apprenticed to, korriban would be second best because of such a strong connection to the history of the Sith. In regards to the probe or 'security system' of sorts, the book Plagueis shows Sidious visiting Korriban many times with no response from the Jedi, that I know of."
StarWarsEU,34empq,the_gv3,1 point,Thu Apr 30 17:12:51 2015 UTC,"Ahhh, haven't read Plagueis yet.  I really need to get on that.  So many books, so little time.  Despite my argument about the abundance of resources required, I do agree with you that they could have had a big advantage had they devoted those resources to it.  I think in learning more about the Dark Side themselves they could have given them an advantage, let alone restricting access to the planet and information and all of the other benefits of having control of it."
StarWarsEU,34empq,legendarymoonrabbit,1 point,Thu Apr 30 18:47:06 2015 UTC,A topic I brought up a while ago: Why didn't the Republic just blow up Korriban?  Some of the commenters bring up studying the planet and it's past inhabitants as reasons for keeping it intact.
StarWarsEU,34e19l,chevyzaz,4,Thu Apr 30 11:43:32 2015 UTC,"Hi, Belgian here.  You have some comic stores that should sell these comics. Do you live near a large city? Gent, Antwerp, Mechelen?   Usually, after all issues of a comic are released, the publisher sells a trade paperback (TPB). This is just like the 'sun of dathomir' comic you mention. Offcourse, we haven't seen what these will look like coming from Disney/Marvel, but you can rest assured, they will come in the future. These should be purchaseble in online stores."

Any place to keep up to date to the release dates of these comics?"

Really nice guy too (I think he is dutch).   You should check some comic stores in ghent, they might allready have the single issues. If not, you can allways attend FACTS in Ghent.

StarWarsEU,349uwd,RoscoNYG,5,Wed Apr 29 13:24:15 2015 UTC,"The Han Solo trilogy features the rebellions most interesting special forces group in my eyes but it's a small part of the series overall. I always wished red hand would get its own book but no dice.  Probably your best bet is the rogue squadron series, especially the wraith squadron books. The series is amazing and all about special ground and star fighter forces.  As for other similar stories: The hand of judgment is comprised of AWOL storm troopers fighting corruption though, you might like them as we'll even if they're still ""imperials."" They start off in the book Allegiance and continue in choices of one. And of course the republic commando novels are in the same category."

Being branded as a Battlefront tie-in novel probably might make it seem unimportant, but the game has no story so this is an entirely original book that just happens to be attached to the game. Del Rey gave out a sampler at Celebration that had the first chapter of the book in it and it was surprisingly engaging. You might be able to find it online.  edit- it comes out in November, not September"

StarWarsEU,3450km,Razorray21,4,Tue Apr 28 14:54:13 2015 UTC,"Im sure the empire operated pretty openly, and likely had strong presences in some planets that the Hutts controlled in the old republic, like Tatooine. Still controlled by Jabba, but Vader rolled up in his ISD, and was like ""what are you gonna do?""   the Main Hutt worlds like Null Hutta, and Nar Shaddaa probably remained outside of control, but they still probably had some imperial presence on the planets.   I actually found this on Wookiepedia:   During the rule of the Galactic Empire, portions of Hutt Space were reorganized into various sectors governed by Moffs though their authority was weak at best and non-existent at worst. One such sector was the Baxel sector which was governed by Moff Sarn Shild, and later by Moff Yref Orgege. While the Empire cracked down on slavery to some extent, the Hutts and several corporations were immune from this ruling.[1] Since the Hutt kajidics generated considerable taxes to support the greatly expanded Imperial Military, Hutt Space was left alone by the Empire though the latter established some manufacturing facilities in parts of Hutt Space. Still, the Empire used its military as a bargaining chip in relations with Hutt Space. In 1 BBY, Sriluur and its neighbors were annexed by the Empire while a token Imperial force unsuccessfully attempted to annihilate Nar Shaddaa shortly before the Battle of Yavin.[1] Imperial forces also undertook police actions against individual kajidics that worked with the Alliance to Restore the Republic. Following the fragmentation of the Empire, Hutt Space seemed to have remained largely autonomous even during the New Republic period. During the fighting between Republic and the Imperial Remnant, most Hutts remained neutral.[1]"

StarWarsEU,34798m,MrV2121,3,Wed Apr 29 03:11:25 2015 UTC,"I really liked the first Darth Bane book.  And I have to admit, it was my favorite of the 3.  Not to say that the other two are BAD books, but they certainly lack the thought that went into the first book.  They seemed rushed almost.  As far as introducing new characters such as Caleb and the introduction of his first apprentice, I liked them.  You'll soon see how the rest of the story with Caleb pans out, which is pretty awesome.  Also, I had no idea who his apprentice was going to be as I never looked it up or had it spoiled for me beforehand, so this was a pleasant surprise to me seeing as how the Sith usually obtain their apprentices at an older age than that of Raine.  (Just wait for the start of the second book [the first 1/4 of it], best Raine/Zannah scenes in the whole trilogy, IMO.  Really starts showing what the Sith's true colors should be compared to that of which they were in The Brotherhood of Darkness.)  But yeah, the pace definitely slows down with the end of the New Sith Wars and the creation of the Rule of Two, but it's still very interesting to say the least.  As I've always said, I think that a trilogy of movies or maybe a mini-TV series would be awesome to see.  Mainly because I'd love to see an on-screen version of Githany and Zannah (Raine).  Also, there is a character from the third novel that would be awesome on-screen."

Do you mean it was a stretch Bane found an apprentice so quickly? Not really anymore of a stretch than any other Forceful being discovering another in a setting as large as Star Wars'. At least the Force's mysterious nature is offered as an explanation for these ""timely"" events. Plus we know all Jedi and Sith were called on to fight on Ruusan. Jedi were so desperate they even brought Forceful children to the front (though only because Sith would have recruited them otherwise). Looking at it that way, the chances of finding an appropriate apprentice were actually higher on Ruusan than anywhere else in the galaxy.  I was really curious about Caleb's unique power. He could use the Force but it was neither described as deriving from the light or dark side but as springing from nature itself. This was back when the light side was thought to be the natural state of the Force in nature and the dark side a corruption of it. So in theory Bane should have been feeling the light side from Caleb, but apparently that wasn't so. Caleb's power even healed, just as you'd have expect from the light side? Oh well.  Kind of off-topic but I wish they'd make a book that showed the detriments of having the galaxy sway too much to the light as opposed to the dark."
StarWarsEU,341djd,HuntedGopher,13,Mon Apr 27 15:19:10 2015 UTC,"This is a great guide! However, you skipped two important storylines. Spectre of the past, and vision of the future, by Zahn, and the X-Eing series of novels."
StarWarsEU,341djd,mangostrike,17,Mon Apr 27 16:16:48 2015 UTC,"Personally, if you read nothing else, make it The Thrawn Trillogy and the X-Wing Series. Those were above all my favorites!"

StarWarsEU,341djd,ricree,6,Tue Apr 28 05:02:50 2015 UTC,I would argue that spectre and vision are essential to understand the relationship between Mara and Luke as it is portrayed NJO onward.

StarWarsEU,341djd,HuntedGopher,6,Mon Apr 27 22:37:09 2015 UTC,Seconding adding Spectre and Vision by Zahn.  You might want to bold 'Legends' and maybe throw in a line break.

StarWarsEU,3443rq,ropes34,4,Tue Apr 28 03:32:09 2015 UTC,It's pretty good after the second read through. If you are gonna move on to legacy there's a lot of backstory in the trilogy. The third book it's pretty good.
StarWarsEU,3443rq,Canesjags4life,2,Tue Apr 28 03:55:05 2015 UTC,So it's definitely a required read then?
StarWarsEU,3443rq,AevnNoram,4,Tue Apr 28 04:01:09 2015 UTC,"It sets the stage for Legacy of the Force, particularly with some characters it introduces and some characterization it provides.   Is it particularly good? Eh. Does it have stuff you need to know for other books? Yeah."
StarWarsEU,3443rq,Ginkasa,2,Tue Apr 28 04:27:16 2015 UTC,"Is it stuff that would as easily imparted via Wookieepedia, or is it important to actually read the story?"
StarWarsEU,3443rq,PR-0927,3,Tue Apr 28 04:55:01 2015 UTC,"Generally speaking the entire EU, contrary to what Disney and its apologists parrot, was pretty damn consistent and unified (or retconned out), and was of pretty high quality.  Unfortunately, post-NJO, while the consistency remained in story, the quality was rather dubious (and the consistency in personalities/behaviors vanished). If you intend to go further and read the successive series following this trilogy, then yes, this is kind of ""required reading."" It's interesting to see the foundation for Jacen and some of internal Chiss politics (I love the Chiss!), but you might just be better off reading Wookieepedia carefully.  If not, stop after NJO. Shit just gets weird and the stories are clearly reaching to create a ""history repeats itself"" kind of thing.  For the record, I read it all (though never yet got to Crucible), and even own the LoTF and FotJ books."
StarWarsEU,3443rq,KillKennyG,3,Tue Apr 28 08:52:37 2015 UTC,"It's an interesting series, different from the norm.  Jacen really comes into his own as a powerhouse force user here, and it's helpful because of how often it's referenced in later books. I wish I had read it before legacy, but I didn't know about it then."
StarWarsEU,3443rq,MillenniumFalc0n,3,Tue Apr 28 05:22:36 2015 UTC,I thought it was better than Legacy of the Force or Fate of the Jedi. If you've already read New Jedi Order I'd say it's worth reading
StarWarsEU,3443rq,KrzysztofKietzman,3,Tue Apr 28 06:22:52 2015 UTC,"It is a required read. It's not that good. It's weird, for one thing, getting into some Outer Rim bug species that were not mentioned since Episode II. And Denning's Squibs, ugh... I guess the presence of the Chiss is nice."
StarWarsEU,3443rq,namer98,3,Tue Apr 28 09:19:06 2015 UTC,"It isn't the greatest series, but it is well written and has some plot points that matter for NJO.  I did a low spoilers review here"
StarWarsEU,3443rq,the_gv3,3,Tue Apr 28 10:27:19 2015 UTC,"Just to put in my two cents, it isn't required, but I would recommend reading it.  It isn't close to my favorite series, but it sets the stage for Legacy and gives you some background information that makes the Legacy series more in depth.  I'm of the opinion that you should just read it all anyways!  No matter how important each book or series is."
StarWarsEU,3443rq,Kiwi62,3,Tue Apr 28 14:17:10 2015 UTC,"Jacen Solo never lives up to the incredible character development Stover put him through in Traitor. Other writers try, but fail, and in Dark Nest fail somewhat spectacularly.   It's decent, slightly below average Star Wars writing - all the essential plot points can be derived from Wookieepedia."
StarWarsEU,3443rq,pewqokrsf,6,Wed Apr 29 13:07:01 2015 UTC,In my opinion the last book you should read (chronologically) is The Unifying Force.  IMO they go downhill quickly after that.

If you continue to read them in conjunction with the new books, great.  Head canon is awesome.  I personally am still assuming a lot of the prequel era material is more or less valid until specifically contradicted.  It doesn't make it any more really canon, though."
StarWarsEU,343yiz,Ginkasa,5,Tue Apr 28 04:57:32 2015 UTC,"""Head canon"" is the word you're looking for buddy"
StarWarsEU,343yiz,SHD1313,6,Tue Apr 28 04:46:44 2015 UTC,"You don't know what canon is if you think one person can decide something is canon.

That's not what the word ""canon"" means."

StarWarsEU,33zh4x,carnationsole3,6,Mon Apr 27 02:12:52 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately, not too much was written about Qui-Gon before the Disney buyout. I think the only novel that has him as a main character (besides The Phantom Menace novelization by Terry Brooks) is Cloak of Deception by James Luceno.  As for the information about Darth Plagueis, there was actually a very good novel that was written about him and his connection to Anakin called Darth Plagueis, also by James Luceno. Probably one of my personal favorites from the old EU."
StarWarsEU,33zh4x,outbound_flight,2,Mon Apr 27 03:27:44 2015 UTC,Thanks for the help! I was debating whether to read Darth Plagueis or not but now I'll pick it up.

StarWarsEU,33zh4x,Sapitoelgato,3,Mon Apr 27 14:49:07 2015 UTC,The Jedi Apprentice series centers on Obi-Wan and Qui-Gon. It is definitely worth a look since there is not much about Qui-Gon. Darth Plagueis i s definitely a fun read if you like hearing about how things were set up.
StarWarsEU,33zh4x,roninjedi,2,Mon Apr 27 03:38:37 2015 UTC,"Thanks! This is really helpful, do you remember how long the Jedi Apprentice series is?"
StarWarsEU,33zh4x,OtakuMecha,3,Mon Apr 27 03:47:34 2015 UTC,18 books but they are YA books so are only around 180 pages. Jedi quest books are the next in the series an follow obiwan and anakin up to episode two and there are only ten in its series. There is also a short comic where qui-gon and obiwan go on a mission but i forget its name. On quigons wikipage there should be a screen at the bottom that shows every work he has appeared in.
StarWarsEU,33z208,zekel11,3,Sun Apr 26 23:58:16 2015 UTC,"If you plan to start reading the canon novels and comics, and want some Legends material to support it I suggest this set up of stories. I am not recommending post-Return of the Jedi stuff, due to not having read any yet:  [Legends] 1-3 Darth Bane Trilogy: Great start into the Expanded Universe, where you learn the legend of the creator of the ""Rule of Two."" You don't need prior knowledge to jump right in at this point, but there is a ton of cool stories set prior to this.   [Legends] 4 Darth Plagueis: This is an amazing bridge between the Darth Bane trilogy and the prequels. The story fills in so many gaps that The Phantom Menace only glosses over. In addition, you get an origins story to Darth Plagueis, Darth Sidious, and Darth Maul (keep in mind that Maul's origin was tweaked in The Clone Wars).  [Legends] 5/6 Shatterpoint/Dark Rendezvous: These two stories I have not read yet, but are important books to read. Shatterpoint fleshes out Mace Windu and Depa Billaba's characters, and Dark Rendezvous fleshes out Count Dooku.  [Legends] 7/8 Labyrinth of Evil / Revenge of the Sith novel: Labyrinth of Evil is a great set up story that leads straight into Revenge of the Sith, and the novelization of the movie takes the story to the next level of amazing.  [Legends] 9 Kenobi: Western story about Ben's first few weeks on Tatooine. After all the destruction in Revenge of the Sith, this story is a nice change of pace.  [Canon] 10 Lords of the Sith: Vader and Sidious trapped on a planet fighting to survive.   [Canon] 11 Tarkin: This story is a great continuation of characters and elements from Darth Plagueis, while focusing on what made Tarkin the man he grew up to become.  [Canon] 12 A New Dawn: Set 10 years before A New Hope, the novel is how Kanan meets Hera. The story is meant to introduce those characters and tease them to the readers before they saw Star Wars Rebels.  These 12 books would make a great foundation into the Star Wars universe. There are many many other great stories, but I am focusing on the time before the Original Trilogy. Others will suggest other great stories, but these are the ones I know."
StarWarsEU,33z208,Sapitoelgato,2,Mon Apr 27 01:06:01 2015 UTC,"I also recommend all the Marvel comics as well. Leia isn't the best, but its a 5 part mini-series might as well read it."

I'm sure A New Dawn will be when I finish. I love Rebels and Kanan and am really happy he got his own book.  Edit: I prefer hardcovers. They just look nicer on a shelf.

You might as well get paperback though and save yourself some cash. A New Dawn, in my opinion, is the best of the new canon books. Tarkin is solid, but in my opinion is less engaging than AND. Still, if you're a fan of the empire or Tarkin himself, it's definitely worth a read. The order in which you read them, from an overall story perspective, isn't important."
StarWarsEU,33v23i,Burngis12,1 point,Sun Apr 26 02:47:31 2015 UTC,"Honestly I'm not really a fan of either the empire or Tarkin because I haven't seen anything from the empires perspective other than the opening crawl of the Darth Vader 2015 comics and stuff in SWTOR which is irrelevant now. I've always liked the idea that the empire aren't actually 'evil', rather that they're doing what they think is best for the galaxy. Think more right wing vs left wing politics than outright good guys vs outright bad guys. If Tarkin is anything like that, I'll love it.  Also, I liked all the quotes from Tarkin that Admiral Daala pulls up in the Jedi Academy trilogy. While it's no longer canon I understand they kept the whole 'rule through fear of force' thing so they probably kept pretty close to my idea of him from Daala.  Edit: Also, it's a tougher choice for me than it should be. I want to have them all in one format or another but I'm not sure which I really like more than the other. Another obvious advantage to hardback is they are released first so when something I'm really excited to read comes out, like aftermath, I don't have to wait. But then, as a finance student, I do like to save my money."

Palpatine and the Sith are not discriminating (except against Jedi). Also two of Palpatine's advisors are alien and one of them is female so it would be weird for his empire to suddenly become sexist and xenophobic.
StarWarsEU,33rgh1,Snorhax,1 point,Sat Apr 25 01:45:48 2015 UTC,"Were Palpatine's prejudices limited to EU (now turned Legends)?  He was extremely against any non-human species as far as I recall, but everything bleeds together for me since I burn through so many audio books, so I can't recall wherein that is established.  Of course he had non-humans in his employ, but often times it was unavoidable or had some practical advantage.  One of the biggest examples (definitely non-canon, but still curious if his prejudice is canonized anywhere) is Grand Admiral Thrawn, tactical genius, but resented for being non human."

StarWarsEU,33rgh1,Snorhax,19,Tue Apr 28 16:29:01 2015 UTC,I'm fine with women and non-white humans being in the Empire. There's no reason why they shouldn't be.
StarWarsEU,33rgh1,yurklenorf,8,Fri Apr 24 23:09:32 2015 UTC,"I'm fine with them being in the Empire, the thing I don't like is that is one less thing that makes the Empire evil now.  When they were misogynists and racists, and xenophobic it made them easier to dislike.  If they're all of a sudden very accepting of everyone it takes away some of their evilness.  Then it turns into Grand Moff Tarkin being a dick, Vader and Palpatine being a dick, and everyone else just kinda doing their job as good dudes.  Obviously that was happening in the EU Empire as well, but there was more of the bad stuff running rampant there."
StarWarsEU,33rgh1,the_gv3,6,Sat Apr 25 12:38:35 2015 UTC,"I'm actually rather pleased about it making the Empire less evil. I'd like to see a bit more depth in the EU than a rigid ""very good guys who are all selfless and always do the right thing"" vs ""evil guys who go out of their way to wrong people"". I think that distinction is fine for the Jedi vs Sith (the Jedi being devoted to justice while the darkside makes the Sith needlessly cruel), but I'm not a big fan of making the entire Empire cartoonishly evil.   The Legends books that show an ""evil"" character's POV do a good job of this - they generally make the character feel more real by dialling back needless cruelty, but other books all too often rely on the bad guys being senselessly bad because they're bad guys. The dehumanisation of evil characters by making them stereotypically evil is probably a symptom of the books being aimed at/accessible to quite a young audience, but it's one of the more disappointing aspects of the EU for me.  An obvious compromise would be to have the older, higher ranking officers remain xenophobic or racist, with the lower ranks being more accepting since they've lived and served with aliens. Then you can incorporate institutionalised racism (lesser pay, worse living conditions etc.) if you want to make the Empire as a whole more evil."

Why would you dislike the fiction being that the Empire was filled with good people who did their duty?

It takes away some of the complexity of the establishment as a villain since it makes it so obviously evil. When an imperial character expresses their support for the system, I want to be able to believe that they believe it, and not immediately question whether or not they are also racists. This isn't to say that I was upset that the Legends Empire was this way, but I guess it was never supported enough for me to take it as anything more than something that was thrown in to make the Empire look more evil and explain why all stormtroopers and Imperial officers were human males."

Note that there were several individuals who did achieve high rank and status in the Empire such as Sly Moore, Thrawn, Mars Amedda, and many others, dispite being aliens, provided they were loyal and useful to Palpatine.

I've seen people complain that the Empire is evil, so of COURSE they'd be racist and sexist. But the Star Wars universe has things we don't have... ALIENS. That kind of shifts the hierarchy of hatred up a rung. Instead of ""us vs. them"" referring to race and/or gender and/or orientation, wouldn't it now refer to humans vs. non-humans?  I hadn't even realized that the Empire is less xenophobic now in the new canon. That makes sense, too. What about Sithiness is specifically human? It's not like the Jedi were all non-human, either. If good and evil are opposing philosophies that are chosen instead of deemed as biologically inherent by one side or the other, it makes for much more flexible storytelling, at least in terms of Star Wars.  Tangent alert: If I see one more Facebook comment whining about the Empire suddenly being ""PC"", I'm going to power down for the night. Or something.

But mostly, I think the segregation and refusal to let many outside of a human male into a position of power showed how unfair the Empire was.  Now they're the completely fair group of people that just happened to blow up Alderaan. That's like fighting against a political party because they made one mistake.

What made the Empire evil was that it was a dictatorship that oppressed EVERYONE regardless of race or gender.  When you think about it, having the Empire be racist and sexist never made sense considering that at the end of the day the Empire was really nothing more than just a tool for the Sith to exert their mastery over the galaxy, and the Sith have had more than their share of aliens (Naga Sadow, Plagueis, Maul) and women (Traya, Zannah, Lumiya) among their ranks."

StarWarsEU,33nw68,Greg2727,11,Fri Apr 24 01:32:51 2015 UTC,"The Rule of Two was ultimately the only system that produced the results the Sith so desired. The Republic dead, the Jedi (nearly) exterminated and a Sithocracy with galactic hegemony. Only the Force intervening in the form of Anakin Skywalker managed to ruin the Dark Side party they managed to get going.  Yes, it can be said that if Malgus had somehow succeeded, the Sith would have eventually overwhelmed the Republic, but that's a big IF, knowing the history of the Sith. Pretty much all the big Sith Lords that we get to read about end up betrayed by a subordinate or contemporary, often right before they were about to finish off the Republic. The Great Hyperspace War fails partially because the Sith are too busy bickering. Malak fires on Revan's flagship. Ruin reignites the Sith Empire after it had been more or less extinct, but is cut down by his followers. Wyyrlok III zaps Krayt. Why would Malgus be any different?  The Rule of Two keeps the Sith infighting. Infighting is inevitable and it is essential to the philosophy of the Sith. If you're not the leader, and you're not plotting to stab the leader in the back at the first opportunity, you're a bad Sith. However, Ro2 institutionalizes the infighting so that the Sith as a whole benefits whenever Darth X is chopped up by Darth Y. Darth X has outlived his usefulness, while Darth Y has learned everything the Dark Side needs him to learn from Darth X. But before this point, Darth Y spends all his energy learning and preparing for the confrontation with his master. This is much more productive than trying to stomp Darths A, B, C... etc. into the dirt before he challenges his master, lest they stab him in the back during the attempt. Even more tragic to the cause of the Sith would be if Darths Y, Z, A, B, C and D decided they weren't going to wait around long enough for Darth X to teach them everything and force pushed him out of an airlock while in hyperspace. All the knowledge and power held by Darth X is lost, while the resultant Darth Squad has to expend time and resources to regain what was lost. Time that will never be available to them, since now, leaderless, they will be finding new, creative ways to kill each other.  TLDR: Sith will be Sith and stab each other sooner or later. Ro2 recognizes this and sets it up so fewer resources are wasted as a result of each stabbing, thus bringing the Sith closer to their goals."
StarWarsEU,33nw68,legendarymoonrabbit,1 point,Fri Apr 24 04:16:47 2015 UTC,"You make a bunch of really good points but I could say the same thing for rule of two. What if one day while the master is asleep and the untrained new Darth decided to pull out his saber and stab the sleeping master, then all his knowledge is gone and we are left with one sith who doesn't know anything. Where in Malgus's time if the apprentices kill the master you said all the knowledge is lost, but my point is that all the knowledge isn't lost because A: there are millions more sith lords and Darths B: all the ancient Sith Lord holocrons still exist and are at disposal."
StarWarsEU,33nw68,legendarymoonrabbit,4,Fri Apr 24 04:21:46 2015 UTC,"Funnily enough, something like that actually happened during Ro2, but not in the way we'd have expected. A master decided that the Dark Side wasn't good enough, and started pursuing Light Side philosophies. He went crazy and started smashing holocrons, until his apprentice chopped him.  Speaking of holocrons, the majority of them are like textbooks. They are easy (read: safe) to use and teach Sith 101. But the deeper you go into the greatest holocrons made by the mightiest Sith, you need great ability in the Force to keep your sanity. Maybe the knowledge isn't lost, but a highly talented Force-sensitive would spend a lot of resources into building up the skills needed to access the best holocrons safely. The millions of run-of-the-mill Sith will never get their PhD in Sithology, and those that do can still be murdered by a mob of high school diploma Sith and those with a BA in Sith Studies (with a minor in Force Choke).  And who's to say that the masters are willing to share? In the traditional Sith model, individual Sith may want to keep knowledge as trump cards in case they are betrayed. In Ro2, the master is  obligated to share because of the very philosophy of the order. Of course in Ro2 there can be masters who don't want to share, Sidious being one example. Apparently they don't teach sharing in Naboo preschool.  Have you checked out the Legacy Comics, OP? It deals with a Sith leader who rejects Ro2, and succeeds in getting the other Sith to listen to him long enough to take over the Galaxy."
StarWarsEU,33nw68,Piterdesvries,1 point,Fri Apr 24 05:06:17 2015 UTC,"No I haven't read them, but I've read all about them and I know one part in the comic where Darth krayt is talking to bane through a holocron I think? and bane criticizes him and calls him a phony sith because he going against the rule of two.  ""And who's to say that the masters are willing to share? In the traditional Sith model, individual Sith may want to keep knowledge as trump cards in case they are betrayed.""  But this also can apply for rule of two! It only takes one master to fuck up the whole sith order. If the master in a rule of two situation were to do that then Bam! The sith are destroyed, where in Malgus's empire if one lord does that oh well, we have plenty more.   Also what you were saying is true about how in Malgus's empire there are tons of sith but they aren't as strong and well trained as the rule of two sith. That is true, but if two rule of two Sith Lords who are very well trained are fighting 10,000 medium trained with lords in Malgus's empire who's going to win?"

"" that's the specifically what Malgus's new empire stands for. He wants to reform that idea and change some other laws of the sith that have to do with infighting. Sure it'd be hard to do that but over time I have no doubt that he could create and army of loyal sith lords and Darths."
StarWarsEU,33nw68,arcrinsis,15,Fri Apr 24 04:26:16 2015 UTC,"Thats the point though, is that no Sith Lord would willingly work under another, except to temporarily bolster their own power. Better to rule in hell then serve in heaven, and all that"
StarWarsEU,33nw68,Darth_Ferrilux,0,Fri Apr 24 01:57:34 2015 UTC,"Yeah so what I'm saying is since bane decided to create ""the rule of two"" that when the two Sith Lords eventually fight each other and one dies half the sith empire is goes with him/her/, where as with millions of Sith Lords like in the old republic when two Sith Lords get pissed off and fight each other and eventually fight  it's only one Sith Lord dead out of millions and the sith empire is still massive and powerful."
StarWarsEU,33nw68,dweezil22,16,Fri Apr 24 02:25:49 2015 UTC,"The point of Bane is if their is more than two, the weak form alliances to defeat the strong until only the Sith becomes so weak that they crumble. With one to have the ultimate power and the other to crave it they work together to become stronger, until the inevitable betrayal. Then down the road it repeats. Is either method better? Not sure.   However, 10,000 Jedi couldn't survive against two Sith working at completing a master plan many years in the making, so ""size matters not."""
StarWarsEU,33nw68,dweezil22,-2,Fri Apr 24 03:06:10 2015 UTC,"Well one jedi (Luke skywalker) defeated two Sith Lords who completed their master plan that was many years in the making (Darth vader and the emperor completing order 66) so I'd argue that size does matter, because imagine if Malgus's new empire succeeded, then millions of jedi wouldn't stand a chance against even just malgus and the 15 or so dark council members making a master plan."
StarWarsEU,33nw68,dweezil22,4,Fri Apr 24 03:12:19 2015 UTC,"But the Rule of Two was the only sith plan in history to actually, indisputably work. The Republic was utterly destroyed and replaced by a Sith government. The fact of the mater is the Force itself intervened in the form of the Skywalkers to take them down, but even that only happened after they had achieved victory"
StarWarsEU,33nw68,w1ngd3,5,Fri Apr 24 19:36:02 2015 UTC,"I can't agree, because that simply isn't how the Dark Side works. You have to realize this isn't a world where results will be what we would expect them to be; the Dark Side abhors cooperation and pits its servants against everything they can get their hands on. (Whether it actually has a ""will"" to abhor cooperation with is debatable, but regardless you'll make more accurate guesses if you assume it does.) This is half of an ""entity"" for lack of a better term which literally permeates the entire universe, including time.  Malgus and the other Sith of his time were too focused on killing each other to kill the Jedi, and they lost as a result. Even if Malgus had won, his subordinates would still have connived against and betrayed each other to the detriment of the Empire. Their inability to cooperate (which I'll again note is completely insurmountable due to their reliance on the Dark Side) would still have destroyed them.  In addition, Bane believed that the power of the Dark Side was thinned being used by so many, that it should be reserved for the truly elite, those who were better than everyone else. Abhorring cooperation, the Dark Side thrives on self reliance. I think Bane was right, but not for the arrogant reasons he came to his conclusions; I think the Sith should be whittled down to the fewest possible because no Sith who wasn't arrogant enough to believe they could destroy the Jedi alone would be able to wield the full power of the Dark Side. No true Sith would need an army of weaker Sith, and so to the Sith who understood this the Dark Side fueled them in great abundance, making the Sith of the Bane line some of the most powerful in all of history. (Vitiate, I will note, may seem like an exception, but he did not need an army either; in the end, the entire history of Vitiates Empire is just the story of Vitiate cooking dinner. They were pawns he manipulated so he could eventually devour them and ascend to godhood, not trusted subordinates. No one in the galaxy but those whose minds he had completely obliterated knew his plans. He worked entirely alone, in truth, despite seeming to have an Empire at his behest.)  With the full power of the Dark Side at their command, they wouldn't just have stronger Force Lightning or faster reflexes, the very future of the universe would literally bend to their will. Not perfectly, the Force is not something anyone can truly control, but with its help probabilities shift beyond our ability to determine in any kind of normal manner. It's better to look at it as 1 Dark Side vs. 1 Light Side rather than 2 Sith vs. thousands of Jedi, if you want to get a proper estimate of the probability of victory or defeat.   They don't fear their Masters dying and leaving them helpless because a force equivalent to fate is on their side and they know it. Star Wars is a universe that literally makes epic standoffs between Master and Apprentice, between brother and sister, between father and son etc happen on purpose. Because of the Force, the rhythm of the universe is exactly what you'd expect of a play. In what decent play does the villains Master just die and leave the villains unable to ever recover? It doesn't happen. Force users understand that the world doesn't work the way a normal person would expect it would, and they adjust their expectations accordingly. There may be bumps here and there, but their Master won't die before they're ready to take the mantle of the Sith; it just wouldn't fit the flow of fate, and in Star Wars that matters.  Even if they don't understand it so concretely, there is nothing in the Sith of the Bane era that truly fears they will die before they pass on their knowledge in the end. Bane did worry Zannah wasn't the right apprentice in the end, but he fully expected to find and train another apprentice. And by the end, despite all the twists and turns, the Force had guided Zannah to her apprentice and led her to her Masters defeat, as they had always both expected.  Conversely, Malgus's plan flew in the face of what the Dark Side is all about. Think about it from the perspective of a story. Every Sith sees themselves as the main character, destined to destroy all the weak fools surrounding them and rise to ultimate power. The Force agrees with all of them, because if it didn't they couldn't wield the Dark Side. Its power is thus scattered and twisted as its servants writhe and scramble for power under a system that does not favor the strength of the individual. The Dark Side eats itself alive under such a system, as evidenced by its slow and painful decline throughout the story of swtor. And if you'll notice, most truly good results for Imperials result from Light Side actions, in my opinion evidence that only by abandoning the Dark Side can Force users function effectively in an environment of cooperation.  So yes, you're right, if the Force were just space magic the Rule of Two would be the most absurd nonsense you could come up with. Two against thousands? PFAH! But it isn't just space magic, it's the (possibly literal) will of the universe. Two people wielded the full power of half the will of the universe alone. Those two people held as much pull with the hand of Fate as the entire Jedi Order, and they were hidden. That much power, wielded with that much precision from an unseen position is absolutely a match for the entire Jedi Order, and that's not in any way opposed to logic when you consider what the Force actually is."
StarWarsEU,33nw68,kevtheachilles,2,Fri Apr 24 07:25:54 2015 UTC,"You know what, That's an amazing response you had and I genuinely think you persuaded me to agree with you. The part that made the most sense is when you said that it's just the two of them using the force rather then thousands of other sith wasting it, I guess it really does make sense because the greatest Sith Lords of all time such as vader, the emperor, Darth nihilus, Darth sion, and darth bane all existed in times where there were only a few sith. Zion and nihilous were the only Sith Lords around other then Darth traya and they were some of the most powerful Sith Lords ever! Sion discovered eternal life amd nihilous could literally devour worlds! Of course we all know how strong Darth vader and sidious were. Also bane was one of the best and he existed during the rule of two. Also now that I really think about it, the only Sith Lords that were truly powerful during the SWTOR era was Malgus, the 10-15 or so dark council members, Darth baras, Darth nox, the emperors wrath, and vitiate. So you know what, you've won me over friend :)"
StarWarsEU,33nw68,kevtheachilles,13,Fri Apr 24 07:37:22 2015 UTC,"Any Sith Lord that chose to cooperate and accept someone else's dominion for safety and succor is no Sith at all. Therefore Bane saved the Sith from a slow decline into weakness and irrelevence.  Despite lame attempts by an MMO to convince us all that the SWTOR error was the Golden Age of the Sith, we all know, deep down, that they were all pussies that Bane could, and would, have destroyed."

On one hand, it was a fun read, but it did completely butcher almost every character from the games (all of whom were otherwise excellent). It also shoehorned in the plot and characters from the Old Republic MMO, the most awful disgrace to KOTOR ever seen.  Anyways, sorry for the hugely opinionated post. If you want to learn about that time period (~4000 BBY) then Karpyshyn's Revan really is the worst place to start.

Even if there are people who would like to do a movie like that, they still have to consider that Rogue One, since it is clearly labeled as part of the Star Wars franchise, will attract kids. Just imagine the outrage of parents who are blindly taking their brats to the movies because ""it's Star Wars, what could go wrong"" and then get completly shocked by a legitimate war film. Not sure Disney would want to deal with crap like that, so I don't think they'll go there. Why take a risk when you can play it safe and still make tons of cash?"

Last weekend at Celebration Anaheim, these side-movies were given the label ""Star Wars Anthology"". Here's a blurb on 'em: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars_sequel_trilogy#Star_Wars_Anthology_films  It's very exciting and very clever of an idea! The numbered movies, as always, are the main saga of the franchise, meanwhile we get Anthology films to explore new corners of the franchise. :-D"
StarWarsEU,33gz6m,autowikibot,2,Thu Apr 23 18:13:04 2015 UTC,"Section 4. Star Wars Anthology films of article  Star Wars sequel trilogy:       In February 2013, Disney CEO, Bob Iger confirmed in an interview with CNBC that Disney-Lucasfilm were working on a ""few stand-alone"" films. He said Lawrence Kasdan and Simon Kinberg were both working on films derived from Star Wars characters.  At the annual CinemaCon convention in April 2013, Disney Studios chairman Alan Horn indicated that the first two of these films were planned to be released in 2016 and 2018, between the new trilogy films.    Kasdan was reported in the Los Angeles Times to have said that he was focusing neither on his previous scripts or the extended Star Wars universe in his approach to writing a new Star Wars film. ""I'm trying to start fresh,"" he said. ""There are certain pleasures that we think the saga can bring to people that they’ve been missing, and we’re hoping to bring them that, and at the same time, have them feel that it’s all new.""   On May 7, 2014, Iger further confirmed that three stand-alone films would be happening within the next ten years. Iger did not confirm which characters the films would be based on, however, he said that the original plan was to release new core films every two years from 2015 with a stand-alone in between.  On May 22, 2014, The Hollywood Reporter reported that Gareth Edwards will direct one of the stand-alone films, officially titled Rogue One with Gary Whitta writing the film with a December 16, 2016 release date.  On June 4, 2014, the official Star Wars website announced that Josh Trank will direct one of the stand-alone films that is after episodes VIII and IX.  On June 10, 2014, Schmoes Know reported that Kasdan will be writing the Boba Fett film, which Edwards may direct for a 2016 release date.  On January 9, 2015, Whitta has finished the draft for the film, but has left the film for another project. On January 12, 2015, a news report stated that Kinberg will take over writing the film's script.    On January 20, 2015, The Hollywood Reporter reported that Tatiana Maslany, Rooney Mara, and Felicity Jones were testing for Edwards' stand-alone film.  Days later, it was announced that Chris Weitz will take over writing of the stand-alone.  Jones will star in the stand-alone film with Edwards directing,  titled Rogue One.  On March 25, 2015, Deadline.com reported that Australian actor Ben Mendelsohn has been cast in a role.  On April 19, 2015, Lucasfilm announced that filming would begin in the summer of 2015 and the plot will revolve around a group of rebels on a mission to steal the Death Star plans, director Edwards stated, ""it comes down to a group of individuals who don't have magical powers that have to somehow bring hope to the galaxy."" Additionally, Kathleen Kennedy and Kiri Hart confirmed that the stand-alone films will be labeled as ""anthology films"". Edwards stated that the style of the film will be similar to that of a war film, stating, ""It's the reality of war. Good guys are bad. Bad guys are good. It's complicated, layered; a very rich scenario in which to set a movie.""       Interesting: J. J.

Someone asked how they determine where to tell a story, whether it's a comic or a novel or whatever, and they had a nice response.  Basically, it was as simple as ""Dark Disciple is more character-driven, so we wanted it to be a novel.  Son of Dathomir was much more action-oriented, so a comic was the better way to tell that story.  Kenobi started as a graphic novel, but wound up being a novel because it served the story better.""

I would really like if they continued making some ""legends"" books but I know that wont happen."
StarWarsEU,33holb,Timefiller,11,Wed Apr 22 21:14:07 2015 UTC,Same. And I feel like this sub is the last bastion of being able to say you prefer following the EU. If you say anything negative at all about the canon wipe at /r/starwars you get downvoted to shit.  I mean I get why they did it and the Disney canon may very well be spectacular but it still won't be the same to me. The Legends continuity is what I grew up with and spent so many years learning about. It'll always be the true SW universe to me.
StarWarsEU,33holb,PR-0927,3,Wed Apr 22 22:40:57 2015 UTC,I feel the same way about that and /r/AskScienceFiction. Yes i get it the EU is no longer canon you don't have to tell me in every thread.
StarWarsEU,33holb,OSUTechie,2,Thu Apr 23 03:53:39 2015 UTC,"Do they really downvote ya over there? haha   We've all been punished for being more of a fan than the average person. :p  Yeah. I can see why they did what did. They really just did what was most convenient for themselves.  Really doesnt make much sense to me though. You'd think it would have been even easier to just make all these books into movies. haha  I'm sure it was one of the criteria of JJ to be able to come up with his own unique story. And I would be all for that IF they hadn't changed what was already written. They could have easily made all new characters and had others just make cameo appearances. Of course they couldn't have called it 7 doing that, which probably prompted this canon change."
StarWarsEU,33holb,OtakuMecha,3,Wed Apr 22 23:04:02 2015 UTC,"It's lazy and greedy what Disney did. Especially the nonsense about a convoluted EU - that's a blatant lie. Leland Chee did a damn decent job keeping stuff in order, and many authors even retconned out nonsense stuff (cloned Emperor, etc.). It was actually pretty damn consistent - you'll always have a few discrepancies here and there, but those were easily explained away.  And yeah, fans of True EU are definitely more hardcore, true fans of SW than the disloyal masses bowing to Disney's Fake Star Wars."
StarWarsEU,33holb,OSUTechie,0,Thu Apr 23 01:44:51 2015 UTC,"I think you get downvoted because we are all tired of the complaining. We all are upset about the wipe. Some more than others, but nobody has taken the EU away from you. You still can use it, you still can read it, and you still can love it.   They have said there is the possibility of more stories in the legend timeline, just they want to establish the new canon first. AND there is possibility of elements from the old EU making its way into the new canon.    There are truths, and there are legends touched with truth. ~ Obi-wan"
StarWarsEU,33holb,OtakuMecha,6,Thu Apr 23 00:38:23 2015 UTC,"Couple things:   1) Yes the EU is still technically there but the new canon is gonna get to be the advertised one and it will become the story everyone knows while Legends fades into obscurity  2) It's not like I was saying ""DAE Think Star Wars is ruined?!"" I wasn't hating on those that choose to follow the new canon. I was only saying that I prefer the Legends universe and it is my opinion that is the SW universe. I don't think there's any reason to downvote opinions like that. I don't downvote people who say they like the new canon better. I just disagree.  3) All I see is people hyping up the new movies and putting down the EU in that sub so I don't know what you mean by tired of complaining."
StarWarsEU,33holb,Timefiller,3,Thu Apr 23 00:53:03 2015 UTC,"1.) Well of course it is. Disney has a cash cow, they are going to push it. They are also using the new canon to get new people in the franchise. How many people have not read the EU due to the massive amount of books? Here they have a fairly simple starting point.   2.) I understand that, but I am saying most of the comments I see downvoted in /r/Starwars are posts that state for the most part that ""They hate Disney wiped the EU"" and anytime someone brings up something that is EU and someone says ""That's no longer canon!"" I am not saying you downvote anybody and I am not saying I downvote anybody. I am just stating what I see.  3.) Of course we are hyped for the new movies. WE ARE GETTING NEW MOVIES! As for the second part of your statement, those comments I see get downvoted just as much, if not more than post complaining about the wipe of canon."
StarWarsEU,33holb,OSUTechie,5,Thu Apr 23 01:10:48 2015 UTC,"1) Yes. I'm not blaming them. But that's the reason the EU does feel lost. That and if you bring up any characters like Anakin Solo or Vergere or Exar Kun or whoever you get several responses of ""Fuck those characters/events. They never happened."" so if people are going to be like that then of course my response will be ""Fuck Finn the Stormtrooper and BB-8. They don't exist in the universe I follow.""  No need to be so hostile to those who prefer the EU. That's their canon.  2) Fair enough.  3) Okay so they can be hyped about the movies but not everyone has to be. If all you get is a resounding chorus of positive opinions then criticism can't be made. And things need criticism. People don't have to attack those who aren't excited about the new canon. And I've seen plenty of people cherrypick the worst parts of the EU to make a case that it's bad and then get upvoted way more than an EU supporter.  The best I can describe it is that you spend 20, in some cases 30, years learning the ins and outs of this universe and all there is to know in its lore. You fall in love with this series and pride yourself on knowing all these thousands of years worth of story. Then someone comes along and tells you everything you know is invalid and they're just gonna make it up from scratch and everyone just goes along with it, no longer caring about the series you had such a great connection to. You want to talk about the characters you have learned about for years but no one cares because ""lol non-canon"". And then this new story starts eating all the parts that you loved about the series whole. When I discuss Star Wars lore or go to celebrations I want to hear and talk about people like the Solo twins, Nihilus, Revan, etc. I hate seeing them get tossed aside only for the discussions to be flooded with Ahsoka, Phasma, Finn, and whoever. Those don't exist in the universe I love. But that's all people want to talk about now outside of this sub. But those characters are very alien to me (no pun intended). Those stories are foreign. They might as well be another series like Star Trek or whatever because they are not the universe that I grew up with. Yet no one seems to care outside this sub and is too eager to throw that all away."
StarWarsEU,33holb,PR-0927,3,Thu Apr 23 01:26:23 2015 UTC,"So much this. I am only 27 years old and have been reading Star Wars books since I was 10 years old! Its like the just took away 17 years of my life! And people just want you to ""get over it."" It's just not fair to any of us huge fans.    I couldnt imagine if I had also gotten into the comics. That is thousands more years of history that is no longer canon.  Just a beyond lazy approach to the new stories. That Just straight up punishes the time we've put into this universe.  I understand that they think it makes it ""easier"" for the new fans. But if they didnt read the books before, why would they now?! They wont even know what to read! They will go into the bookstore and buy an ""old-canon"" book and just get even more annoyed by the whole thing.  I'm ranting now but yeah. Its on of the most frustrating things that ever happened in my life. I'm still super excited for the new films. Just so confused on they way they are handling this."

StarWarsEU,33holb,robearification,4,Thu Apr 23 09:17:33 2015 UTC,"Exactly. Their decision to dump the EU was so disappointing to me, I haven't been keeping up on anything Star Wars lately. The EU was my childhood. I was harassed by teachers for reading it in class. I was that kid with the huge glasses in Leia braids wearing boy t-shirts because Star Wars was for boys. I was so excited for everyone to see what they were missing. Now it just feels like another sci fi series, not my Star Wars."

The only stuff that isn't cannon is new republic. Also I'd bet that the new movie will reference SWTOR and revan. And if it makes you feel any better they announced that SWTOR and the clone wars show is still cannon, and since clone wars is cannon tams they reference bane that makes him cannon and bane references revan so that makes him cannon!"

StarWarsEU,33holb,robearification,2,Fri Apr 24 10:50:34 2015 UTC,"See http://www.slashfilm.com/lucasfilm-story-group-star-wars-canon/   As for The Old Republic [...] the basic sentiment at this point is that it’s canon until it isn’t. Meaning, at the moment, they don’t have plans to do stories set in that time period. But they love the story and if and when they decide to make stories in that period, they’d cross that bridge then.   Basically, there are many casual fans out there who love KOTOR and there are still lots of people paying money for TOR. So from a business perspective, it's a good decision not to piss off those paying fans by outright declaring it to be non-canon until they absolutely have to. But when they eventually come out with new movies, games, books or comics set in that era, don't expect them to treat KOTOR, TOR, the KOTOR comics or any part of them as canon that they have to adhere to.  As for the ""don’t have plans to do stories set in that time period"" part, that doesn't necessarily mean that they are not planning something behind closed doors and just aren't ready to reveal anything to the public yet."
StarWarsEU,33holb,Bridgeboy95,1 point,Fri Apr 24 20:09:20 2015 UTC,Also they said any new Star Wars content that comes out is still  cannon and a new swtor expansion is launching in September so that alone proves that it's still cannon.
StarWarsEU,33holb,Timefiller,0,Fri Apr 24 10:51:33 2015 UTC,"I am pretty sure that the launch of a new swtor expansion does not automatically make the game, which is clearly stated as not being canon, into being canon.   I think the new Star Wars content that comes out is more about new books, movies, comics, and games - not add-ons to old SW games.  And it is not about what this random website said. It is about what they transcribed. That quote was taken from the Q/A session with the LucasFilm SW canon group. You can find it here at the official star wars website."

But really was there any point in stopping the projects that were already under way if they really were going to do that?"
StarWarsEU,33holb,Bridgeboy95,1 point,Thu Apr 23 22:35:08 2015 UTC,"Because to be quite frank with you businesses large businesses like disney see that as a problem. They see catering to a minority ""eu fans"" as pointless and see the EU as not as profitable as it could be.  Solution scrap make a new EU and get new fans in. Its hard cold business and I can respect it. They see avenues like marvel now and DCs new 52 bringing  in more customers so they adopted it for star wars.  Honesty investment wise its probably gonna bring in more money. EU fans are a small minority and quite frankly as harsh as it is they/we don't matter in the eyes of a large company.  As someone who is going in to study business it makes complete sense."
StarWarsEU,33hqzz,Sapitoelgato,3,Wed Apr 22 16:53:28 2015 UTC,"Not yet. I'm doing a full chronological movie/book/comic/tv run through of the new canon leading up to TFA, so I'll be saving this and the new book 'til I get up to it. Hope it's good!"
StarWarsEU,33hqzz,BeesInABar,3,Thu Apr 23 02:53:33 2015 UTC,"While everything in the new canon is (so far) pretty self-contained, I usually recommend publication order over chronological order, even with Legends material. A chronologically-first appearance of a character or element isn't a debut if it was originally introduced later in the timeline (earlier in our real-world timeline).   Take Thrawn for example. The Thrawn Trilogy is his debut. It shows you what he is at his core, as a character. If you read material that involves him earlier in the timeline first, you're a) spoiling the mystique of his personality and nature in the Thrawn Trilogy, and b) denying yourself the experience of reading his chronologically-earlier stories through the lens of familiarity that the writers assume the reader already has. Part of the excitement of reading the earlier tales of characters we already know is wondering how they got where they were when we first met them, and that revelatory flavor is removed when you put chronological order over publication order. It's fun to see the clever ways dots are connected when you take in franchise media as it's released."
StarWarsEU,33hqzz,ganthetjr,2,Thu Apr 23 18:08:18 2015 UTC,"Well, I've already seen/read most of it. Just going through again to psych up for TFA. This and (depending on how long I take to rewatch Clone Wars) Dark Disciple are really the only ones I'll be experiencing first in chronological order."
StarWarsEU,33hqzz,BeesInABar,2,Thu Apr 23 18:31:15 2015 UTC,"Well, until Dark Disciple comes out, Lords of the Sith comes after RotS, but before Tarkin. This short story falls right before Lords of the Sith. However, keep in mind the preface to A New Dawn takes place before the Kanan The Last Padawan comic. If you have the book already, it is safe to read just the preface before the comic. You could wait if you want, but it is awesome."
StarWarsEU,33hqzz,LunchBox540,3,Thu Apr 23 04:38:24 2015 UTC,I really want to read this now. Looks like I need to buy an issue of Star Wars Insider. Or is there a place online I can read this as well as the other SWI short stories?

StarWarsEU,33euiu,IDontWASHMYFeet,9,Tue Apr 21 23:14:54 2015 UTC,"I, and seemingly most others, agree that Dark Empire's premise is pretty ridiculous. It was the first comic published by Dark Horse so they obviously tried (a little too) hard to make their mark on the continuity. Luke's dealings with the dark side are interesting, as I think it would make sense for the future grandmaster of the order to have knowledge of such things. The art is kind of love it or hate it, as it's among the most stylized art styles of Dark Horse's run. It's not personally my thing since I don't think it really jives with the Star Wars look and feel but I appreciate it for what it is aside from that.   However, a really great piece of EU material should enhance the events of the movies when you reflect on them, not diminish them or their importance as Dark Empire so boldly did. Congratulations Anakin! You redeemed yourself by killing Emperor Palpatine and destroying the Sith! Only you didn't at all. Frankly I'm not a fan of how often the Sith were used in post-Jedi material since it all pretty much diminishes the actions of Vader, but I could live with it. Bringing Palpatine back from the dead? Not so much.  I haven't read the Thrawn trilogy adaptations so I can't really speak to them, but if the KOTOR era interests you, I would dive right in. It's great and creatively unrestrained, plus there's plenty of solid material in many different types of media to experience. It has more of a high-fantasy feel which I think is cool for the era it takes place in. Additionally, the door is open for it to be brought into canon down the road if new pieces of canon don't contradict it (which, based on what Pablo Hidalgo said at Celebration, won't be anytime soon)."
StarWarsEU,33euiu,sillywookiee,4,Wed Apr 22 01:00:31 2015 UTC,"I actually saw an article not too long ago that says The Old Republic can be considered ""canon until it isn't"" the other day, unless this is fake. Which it could be, as with anything on the internet."
StarWarsEU,33euiu,itsbaaad,2,Wed Apr 22 08:38:10 2015 UTC,"In my mind that's what I'm doing with everything pre-ROTJ. It's pretty easy to do. Heir to the Jedi was supposed to be the third part in the Empire and Rebellion series, but when the Disney acquisition happened and the cannon decision was made they just switched that to cannon. While the other two remain in Legends. The plans for future releases seem to concentrate mostly on POST-ROTJ."
StarWarsEU,33euiu,GeneticBlueprint,2,Thu Apr 23 03:17:56 2015 UTC,"I feel like they should do something/make a decision concerning Bane and whether or not his back story is canon, because officially right now all he is is a ghost and the Lord who created the Rule of Two, from TCW, and that makes me sad."
StarWarsEU,33euiu,itsbaaad,2,Thu Apr 23 03:47:01 2015 UTC,"I'd say it's safe to say that everything pre clone wars in cannon, such as KOTOR, Darth Bane, and SWTOR, the only things that aren't cannon is the new republic stuff."
StarWarsEU,33euiu,Greg2727,2,Fri Apr 24 01:12:24 2015 UTC,"I concur, with the Knights of the Old Republic comics."

StarWarsEU,33euiu,Charlemagne_III,6,Wed Apr 22 17:34:09 2015 UTC,"I'm actually pretty fond of the art style, but I can understand why people wouldn't like it. Both the penciling and colors are strange, but I'd invite you to peek ahead to Empire's End if you really want to make your eyes bleed. There are far worse artists in the Star Wars EU, I assure you. Cam Kennedy also drew the art for a short series of Boba Fett Comics, which is actually one of my favorites from the 'old days.' I think the style works a lot better for the seedy-underbelly of the Star Wars Universe, as it has a nice gritty feel that even the new Abrahms film seems to lack (from what I can see).   As for the story... yeah, it has some problems. I think Dark Empire 2 and Empire's End were the first stories in the EU that I just sort of tried to pretend didn't happen. I just couldn't make it fit with what Star Wars was for me at the time.   Dark Empire 1, however, is serviceable with a little imagination. There's a great moment in the Hand of Thrawn books where Mara Jade says something to the effect of: ""I'm still not certain that was really him..."" in reference to the clone Emperor. This implies, very cleverly, that the emperor we see in Dark Empire is actually just a mad clone who BELIEVES himself to be Palpatine, much like Joruus C'Boath in the Thrawn trilogy believed himself to be the old Jedi Master C'Boath, thus preventing Anakin's redemption from being utterly pointless. It's conceivable that Palpatine had the knowledge and power to transfer his essence into a clone body upon his death, but that still wouldn't affect this theory. In fact, it would better feed the clone's delusion that he had indeed survived Endor. It would also be of benefit for a group of former courtiers of the empire to want to prop up a figure-head to revive a power structure that they thrived in. Maybe I over-think these things a tad, but the events of Dark Empire make a lot more sense when you read it this way- as the shadow of an old, vanquished power structure trying vainly to reassert itself.   The overarching theme of Luke being left in the dark, so to speak, with regards to how he should go about reviving the Jedi was already established earlier in the EU, which could kinda explain his mistakes in Dark Empire- and the need to try to understand his father is pretty self explanatory.   So, in answer to your question, I'd say go ahead and read it but don't worry about Dark Empire 2 and Empire's End. They rarely, if ever, come up again in latter stories. DE2 has some interesting parts with Boba Fett that imply that he was once an imperial stormtrooper (before the prequels this was huge) but other than that I think it's a little too silly to read, even for the EU. ""Galaxy Gun?"" smh."
StarWarsEU,33euiu,lanktank,7,Wed Apr 22 14:05:25 2015 UTC,"Worst story and art in my opinion. I slogged through it but really didn't enjoy it.   Knights of the Old Republic and the short set of TOR comics were good. Also read the Republic line of comics, they are awesome."
StarWarsEU,33euiu,kalzeth,5,Wed Apr 22 03:22:45 2015 UTC,"I personally love the art style. It was very unique and expressive. You don't see a lot of chances taken with the art in a Star Wars comic. Mostly you end up with decent but uninspiring art like Republic comics or the KotOR comics. Only occasionally to you get something like The Heir to the Empire adaptation.   I even really like the story, of the first Dark Empire at any rate. I like a lot of the elements introduced in Dark Empire 2. The post RotJ EU was always lacking Dark Jedi minions for the heroes to face off against and Dark Empire 2 answered that need. There was a lot of interesting tech and world building in the first 2 like the Shadow Droids, the Emperor's Sentinels, and the War Droids. The Dark Empire series took a big chance and swung for the fences. It dared to be grand and it mostly worked. There were a number of elements of DE2 that were over the top and so that's why I typically ignored it and Empire's End in my head canon.  Empire's End however was a mess of story and art. No defense."
StarWarsEU,33euiu,countjared,5,Wed Apr 22 05:58:54 2015 UTC,Obnoxious? It's the best-illustrated and coloured SW comic book of the entire lot.

Booted it straight out of my head canon. . . and found it colored almost everything that came after.  I like to blame KJA for starting the immediate downslide from the high point Tim Zahn launched the EU on, but I'm forced to admit, Dark Empire helped grease the slope."
StarWarsEU,33euiu,thebardingreen,2,Wed Apr 22 08:56:57 2015 UTC,"I read the series all the way through. With comics I feel that you usually need to fill in the gaps with a little headcanon because of the short format, but Dark Empire required that of me to an excessive degree. There was so much it seemed to leave out and skip, with ye weird characterizations and such. I wasn't a huge fan of the art either."
StarWarsEU,33euiu,Thumper12albania,2,Wed Apr 22 01:03:28 2015 UTC,"I didn't really have a problem with the choice of color. The plot was cool on a a high level, like the Emperor having a secret dark planet with high technology, and he was given a second chance at being a badass since he got wrecked in the movies. It falls short on the details though, because they get carried away with super weapons, crazy powers, and skipping key plot element. I mean we barely got to see Luke's touch with the dark side. It's still one of my favorite comics, but only because the Emperor is so cool."
StarWarsEU,33euiu,Charlemagne_III,2,Wed Apr 22 01:47:33 2015 UTC,"I started working at my local comic shop the month prior to Dark Empire's release. I recall picking it up when it came in, and to be fair considering how fledgling Dark Horse was at this time I never really gave the art style much thought.   This of course was caused by the fact that many comics in the 90's just had horrible art. I feel their was this wave of nostalgia going back to the 60's style for a little while, and it just kind became the norm for production houses at the time. Marvel did it, DC did some, and Dark Horse. The only publisher around that era that put it's best foot forward was Image. - Image to this day produces some of the Best and Highest quality comics in the Industry. - If it wasn't for Injustice I would never read any of the Big Two, and Darkhorse really doesn't have titles that interest anymore currently."
StarWarsEU,33euiu,AmunRa666,1 point,Wed Apr 22 12:55:48 2015 UTC,"The art style and coloring was just typical of that era in comic books. Like at X-Wing comics, it isn't much prettier, but the colors are more yellow/red and blue/purple."

The art style is different but like some of Roque stories are a little bit far fetched, the whole of Dark Empire is worse. The emperor creates Dark Jedis like I drink beer (yes I drink a lot of beer). Makes no sense with everything we have read before."

StarWarsEU,337g4b,Riceatron,7,Mon Apr 20 06:06:22 2015 UTC,"There are a few important things that stand out in my mind. All of the following are spoilers but since you tagged the post I won't bother to tag my comments.  TARKIN   Tarkin suspicions that Vader is Anakin Skywalker and that he and the emperor are Sith. He seems unconcerned at these facts and appreciates the strength they exhibit in governing. There is a Sith temple/tomb underneath the Jedi temple that the Jedi were unaware of that the Emperor uses as a base for Sith alchemy/magic/research. Seems like it may play a role in a future work. Vader and Tarkin become friends, sort of. Through the book they earn a respect for one another. Tarkin was raised to be ruthless, with ideas resembling social Darwinism. The strong survive and prosper. He was sent into the wilderness as a young teen with his uncle to live off the land and to test himself against the the wildlife of the planet he lived on. Tarkin is overseeing the construction of the Death Star in this book.  He takes on the title of Grand Moff by the end of the novel. Tarkin Doctrine is introduced. Very similar to the old Doctrine's concept of ""Rule by fear."" Interdictors are back.   HEIR TO THE JEDI   Lightsaber construction revealed in new canon. Sabers have 3 crystals. One large, main crystal that likely denotes the color of the saber and is the crystal we see the Padawans gather in Clone Wars TV series. Two other crystals that need to be perfectly aligned, likely to focus the blade. These crystals can only be placed properly via the Force, according to Luke's senses. Luke's well known in the Alliance for destroying the Death Star. It doesn't seem to go to his head. First instance of Luke using telekinesis in the new canon chronology. He moves a wet noodle across a table. Luke gains and loses a love interest (Nakari Kelen) in this book. Luke has a brush with the dark side after the death of Nakari. He nearly kills a bounty hunter in his rage. He describes it as a feeling of addictive invincibility and realizes that had he succeeded in killing the bounty hunter that it would forever dominate his destiny. Givin were reintroduced into canon, they're still renowned as mathematical geniuses. The Givin in this book is Drusil, she has agreed to help the Alliance in exchange for the safety of her family.     I'll add more if I remember anything."

StarWarsEU,337g4b,roninjedi,1 point,Wed Apr 22 18:57:34 2015 UTC,They don't give a purpose for the crystals but I assume that they focus the blade in some way. The preferred number of crystals in a lightsaber in Legends canon was 3 as well (Shadows of Mindor) so it's not new really but to have it restated leading up to TFA is leading some to believe that the misalignment or absence of these crystals is the reason for Kylo Ren's cross guard saber.
StarWarsEU,337g4b,Ritz527,1 point,Wed Apr 22 21:17:35 2015 UTC,Been a while since i read Shadows but now that you mention it i do remember the Young Jedi knights books and the Kotor games talking and using three crystals/gems.

StarWarsEU,337g4b,Morlaak,4,Thu Apr 23 23:14:17 2015 UTC,"Honestly, Heir to the Jedi didn't include too much new - a new species is about it. Tarkin mentioned that there's a Sith shrine deep underneath the Jedi Temple on Coruscant (and that said Temple is now the Imperial Palace).  Heir was meant to be the last book in a Legends series but somewhere along the way they decided that it was better served as a part of the new canon. Tarkin is... Luceno doing his continuity business, bits from the Plagueis novel as well as Dark Lord: The Rise of Darth Vader are mentioned in passing."
StarWarsEU,337g4b,yurklenorf,2,Mon Apr 20 13:47:09 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I figured they wouldn't have too much new info considering they had to have been started before or right after the continuity reset."

StarWarsEU,337g4b,HuntedGopher,2,Mon Apr 20 16:57:28 2015 UTC,"Luceno includes mentions of Plagueis definitively as Sidious' master, and mentions the droid that Sith had during the prior novel. Events from Cloak of Deception and The Rise of Darth Vader are mentioned, specifically, Tarkin and Vader go to a planet that Vader visited in that novel, and there are strong implications that Vader had a mission there like the mission in that novel."

StarWarsEU,337g4b,Charlemagne_III,3,Wed Apr 22 19:03:05 2015 UTC,"Heir to the Jedi was very specific about how technology works, which I really like.  It told you exactly how lightsabers work, specifically differentiated between particle and ray shields, had slugthrowers, explained how lightsabers react to stun weapons, explained how hyperspace routes are mapped, explained personal stealth fields, had an interdictor, and explained some sensor limitations. There were a lot of other things as well. The attention to detail was amazing, and felt like a natural part of Luke's thought process as opposed to getting in the way of the story. The author did an excellent job of giving the people who love the technical details of the canon what they want. It probably had more information in it than any other Star Wars book I have read."

Speaking of Sidious, you get to see Anakin give Palpatine the news about Maul's return. The interesting part about this story is the ship Maul and Savage leave on, because it ties into the next story...  Star Wars: Darth Maul-Death Sentence https://www.amazon.com/dp/1616550775/ref=cm_sw_r_awd_4oinvb0EE81XT  This story is a graphic novel, so the budget is way better, and tells an interesting story. The fun thing about this episode is the ship the use is the same one they leave in in Sith Hunters. I found that as a cool bridge between the two. After this story ends, there is a gap in the ""adventures of Maul and Savage"" until the appear again in TCW.  Anyways, check them out. They are two Legends stories that fit nicely in TCW universe."

StarWarsEU,33731x,Coonsan,6,Mon Apr 20 13:47:21 2015 UTC,Hard Contact is your best bet. Nothing but clones on a clandestine mission. I would skip the rest of the series. It gets too complicated and strays away from the mission oriented style of the first book.
StarWarsEU,33731x,Charlemagne_III,9,Mon Apr 20 03:46:14 2015 UTC,"While that is true, I would still recommend at least trying the rest of the series. The series goes as far as the early Imperial era, and shows a clone's (albeit somewhat extreme) view on the Clone Wars. Although I am pretty biased, it was the Republic Commando series that got me into the EU."
StarWarsEU,33731x,swinstigator,8,Mon Apr 20 04:02:39 2015 UTC,"I'd second the Republic Commando series.  Definitely some of the better stuff.  It does get a bit dramatic, but I'd still say it's worth it."
StarWarsEU,33731x,pewqokrsf,7,Mon Apr 20 04:57:23 2015 UTC,"I will agree, this is actually one of the best series that shows you a lot of different aspects of the clones. It shows you Arch Troopers Training (this is very different than what it shows you in the show) and how they ran their missions. It shows your their bonding and a sense of family. It really adds a human element to the clones. Finally it gives you a sense of how the clones actually looked at everything. They knew they would not be around forever (both figuratively in the sense of the war, as well as, literally as they were genetically altered to rapidly age) and they start questioning that and start looking into that. I will say that when you read the books you have to keep in mind that the EU has a VERY different take on the clones than that of ""cannon"" that you see in the shows/movies."
StarWarsEU,33731x,Starnold87,5,Mon Apr 20 13:37:34 2015 UTC,"The Karen Traviss ""Republic Commando"" book series is controversial (and officially decanonized even before Disney bought out Lucasfilm) but in my opinion, it provides a fascinating and unparalleled look at both ground level Clone trooper thought process and Mandalorian culture!

StarWarsEU,3370bk,flcl4evr,3,Mon Apr 20 03:48:01 2015 UTC,For me it was them talking down about the EU so much and saying it was such a big mess. Yes there are little things that are wrong in some places but thats what you get for working in an evolving universe. Personally i think SW has one of the best and easiest to follow timelines of any series.  They also say it would have stopped new people from wanting to read or get into it. But it dosent seem like marvels and DC's wonky timeline and cannon keeps those who want to get into it from starting so that was just an excuse to me for them to trash it.

What really irks me is the loss of so many cool stories by authors that kept Star Wars alive during the decades between the trilogies. Thrawn, the X-Wing Novels, and many others generated the hype that helped bring us episodes 1-3.   This opened up the door for the Clone Wars novels and the original cartoon series, which will always be my favorite.

If the main characters just come across this Vong scout ship and learn that they're a race of extragalactic invaders who are disconnected from the Force only to forget about this threat immediately after the episode ends, it would feel kind of silly.  That said, I think it would have definitely been an awesome episode, certainly in the visuals department. It also would have been great to see such an infamous species on-screen for the first time."

StarWarsEU,3318h1,tunnel-snakes-rule,9,Sat Apr 18 18:07:46 2015 UTC,"Yes, I like that idea, although I would have liked an unknown fleet to drop in at the end of the episode, eliminate both the Vong and the Republic commandos.  As both ships are wiped out, the scene cuts to the interior of one of the unknown ships, we can't really see the crewmembers, they're just humanoid silhouettes.  A voice says ""All combatants have been eliminated.""  It cuts to the rear of a command chair.  ""Very good.""  Finally, an extreme close-up of the commander, all we see are his eyes.  They glow red, what little we see of his face is blue.  ""Take up back home."""

StarWarsEU,3318h1,yodamann,4,Sat Apr 18 17:50:01 2015 UTC,The NJO wouldn't have been 'canon' though... just whatever pale imitation Filoni and company cooked up.
StarWarsEU,3318h1,Fenris447,14,Sat Apr 18 23:57:58 2015 UTC,Filoni did his damnedest to keep the EU represented in the Clone Wars. He had to balance that with George's willingness to ignore it all and make shit up. I can imagine riding the line between telling your boss he has his universe wrong and keeping your job isn't easy.
StarWarsEU,3318h1,kalzeth,2,Sun Apr 19 04:42:26 2015 UTC,"I think this is tough. I think in general he did a good job but then things like the Bane incarnation, Bariss, Evan Piell, and Depa retcons are frustrating.  The mandalore stuff or not including Revan is totally understandable to me and not a big deal.  I really want to see him put Xizor or Dash Rendar in Rebels"

StarWarsEU,3318h1,cupids_hitman,12,Sat Apr 18 18:38:01 2015 UTC,You seriously can't see why people might have liked them to continue the series?
StarWarsEU,3318h1,dbutlerjr,6,Sat Apr 18 19:27:21 2015 UTC,"While I'm somewhat inclined to agree with your way of thinking, I love the NJO series from the EU and it would have been cool to see the YV live/animated.

StarWarsEU,3318h1,bonerpotpie,1 point,Sat Apr 18 20:44:09 2015 UTC,I agree with you there about the Vong. I meant specifically trying to cram more stuff into the Episode II- Episode IV time period. Nothing wrong with moving forward.
StarWarsEU,3318h1,dbutlerjr,3,Sat Apr 18 21:27:41 2015 UTC,I've personally been more interested in the post-ROTJ time period than I have been about the TCW and OT era.  I've enjoyed the SW we've gotten (and are getting) but I've always wanted more of what came next after ROTJ than what came before.  Ah well.
StarWarsEU,3318h1,yodamann,3,Sat Apr 18 21:33:06 2015 UTC,"I agree, save for the ""happy with what we're getting"" part.   I was  a huge fan of the EU. Pretty much all the books I've read for pleasure over the last 4-ish years have been EU. Disney comes along and ruins 30+ years of continuity, and then expects me to jump right into their ""DisnEU""?   I don't think so. Sure it's great that we're getting a new Star Wars movie, but there has to be a way to continue the Legends timeline. Since they decided that people don't care about the books, why bother publishing books in the new timeline anyway? Just keep going for the people who like the books, and let the new movies do their own thing."

I imagined the look of the Vong themselves as pretty R-rated, so I'm not feeling the pencil sketch as much. I always like the story arc with the species; perhaps this will be re-purposed in a later show or movie."
StarWarsEU,3318h1,yodamann,5,Sat Apr 18 18:22:05 2015 UTC,"I'm glad it didn't happen. Filoni would have mishandled them just like he mishandled the Mandalorians, the Nightsisters, Asajj Ventress and canon in general."
StarWarsEU,3318h1,Fenris447,3,Sat Apr 18 23:57:12 2015 UTC,"You realize Lucas was directing the story for all those, right? Any time the show got it right in regards to the EU, you could thank Filoni."
StarWarsEU,3318h1,Spam78,2,Sun Apr 19 04:48:41 2015 UTC,"Except when he overrode Lucas over Ahsoka's age and proceeded to fuck up the canon over how a Youngling transitions to a Padawan and with it, large amounts of Obi-Wan's backstory."
StarWarsEU,3318h1,yodamann,2,Sun Apr 19 08:42:08 2015 UTC,"I saw Filoni taking an awful lot of credit for the crappy mandos. I do realize that Lucas was also big on ""Screw the EU, I'm the king"". His daughter was also terrible for that I saw an interview with her that was pretty much ""I don't care what other people write, I want to tell the stories that I want to tell. If that conflicts, well, we are higher in the pecking order."
StarWarsEU,3318h1,samferrara,5,Sun Apr 19 15:55:01 2015 UTC,"The Vong were the lowest point in the EU that I've loved since ~1997, and are one of the reasons I'm sort of glad for the new canon."
StarWarsEU,3318h1,BeesInABar,2,Sat Apr 18 17:44:31 2015 UTC,Is there a chance that more CW material will be released like Son of Dathomir and Dark Disciple? Maybe it could set up a post-sequel trilogy Vong invasion.
StarWarsEU,3318h1,yurklenorf,3,Sat Apr 18 17:12:00 2015 UTC,"I think Filoni mentioned he'd prefer not to do more adaptations of what content they had. Plus, Son of Dathomir was already written and had been storyboarded but didn't have the preliminary animation work done, and Dark Disciple sounds like they put together a couple different arcs that they had half-written."
StarWarsEU,3318h1,Kubrick_Fan,2,Sat Apr 18 20:48:34 2015 UTC,I read about the Vong on the wookiepedia. It sounds to me like someone breaking all the toys in the toybox so no one else can play with them.
StarWarsEU,3318h1,RoguePilot09,8,Sat Apr 18 19:01:40 2015 UTC,It's more like someone breaking all the toys in the sand box because they had been taught that the toys were evil and were an affront to their religious zealot heritage.
StarWarsEU,3318h1,bearded_jedi,6,Sat Apr 18 22:28:28 2015 UTC,"I agree with you, but understand the reasoning for it. The entire arc was a multi-author event with key points mapped out in advance. The project was green lit after Lucas officially confirmed that he would NOT be making any more films. Previously this time period was considered protected since Lucas had hinted at more films. With the notion of no more films this time period became free game. The Vong arc was meant to ""break all the toys"" to show that THIS was the story going forward. There are parts and directions that I wish hadn't happened, personally, so I'm not too upset that it's no longer canon. That being said, I had a great time reading it and couldn't wait for the next one to come out when I read through them. It was a monumental effort and it was pulled off by multiple authors quite well and I really enjoyed it."
StarWarsEU,3318h1,wraithpriest,4,Sat Apr 18 22:00:37 2015 UTC,"I loved it, I really did.  The only thing I disliked was that bit set the precedent of the aforementioned multi-author arcs, and well...

StarWarsEU,330rvb,Ginkasa,2,Sat Apr 18 14:00:06 2015 UTC,"So what do you feel would be the alternative?  How do you make a sequel trilogy that stands on its own, feels important and legitimate instead of just ""another adventure,"" while also including all the EU stories and not stepping on any toes?"
StarWarsEU,330rvb,pchc_lx,4,Sun Apr 19 22:14:34 2015 UTC,"they could have still made whatever movie they wanted and then just de-canonize the specific characters or events that are explicitly overwritten and contradicted.  sure, that could get messy, but let the authors bear the burden of retcon and when it shakes out you're only looking at say 5 books and a handful of characters that get the axe, rather than hundreds and hundreds of books, characters, thousands of words written...   of course, in my nerd's dream world, the could have taken like 3 or 4 meetings during the writing of the film, with a roundtable of EU authors and LF heads.  come up with a solid TL;DR of where the EU is, what the timeline is like, where a movie could fit.  make the cuts where they need to happen, but take like FIVE FUCKING MINUTES to just see how feasible it would be to fit a new trilogy into the established world.  honestly... they could rewrite Han & Leia's kids, they could un-kill Chewie, they could do whatever the fuck they want... make half an effort to fit into the EU or don't, just don't fucking cut the ENTIRE THING, people's whole lives of writing and reading and living in this universe....  TLDR blacklist vs whitelist the EU.  TLDR nerd's feelings hurt."
StarWarsEU,330rvb,Ginkasa,1 point,Sun Apr 19 23:39:43 2015 UTC,"Whose to say they didn't take five minutes to how feasible it would be to fit a trilogy in and came to the conclusion it wasn't very feasible at all?  But let's say they do what you say and make the movie they want and just erase what's affected.  Guess what?  The Force Awakens is the movie they wanted to make and there is very little in it that gives me confidence that anything could have fit.  What's the point of keeping Corran Horn, for example, around if literally every story he's been in no longer makes sense with the groundwork laid by the new movies?  I get its rough to not get new stories with Jaina or Ben Skywalker or whoever your favorite was, but the old stories are still there.  They're not gone.  You can still enjoy them.  I'm reading them right now, some I've read before and some I haven't, even though I know the new movies won't follow along.  Its okay."
StarWarsEU,330rvb,Charlemagne_III,-1,Mon Apr 20 00:30:36 2015 UTC,"Get over it. They have a new, properly curated universe to play in"
StarWarsEU,330rvb,Colest,3,Mon Apr 20 04:04:18 2015 UTC,Legends re-canonization only happens when it makes sense (Hutts are no longer hermaphrodites for this reason)   Actually it made perfect sense until you liquidated the canon. That's really bad cyclical logic.
StarWarsEU,330rvb,Colest,2,Sun Apr 19 02:50:47 2015 UTC,"I don't know, there was a lot of crap in the old EU, I don't think anyone can deny that. This way they can use its best world-building aspects so everything still feels familiar, while (hopefully) getting rid of the stranger/less sensible aspects."
StarWarsEU,330rvb,Colest,2,Sun Apr 19 08:32:32 2015 UTC,I was referring to the Hurt hermaphrodite thing.
StarWarsEU,330rvb,zeonchar,0,Sun Apr 19 18:56:04 2015 UTC,"Ah fair. I can see both sides with that one. With them being giant sentient slugs the hermaphrodite thing made sense, but I think it could be argued that when you're trying to market characters like Jabba to an audience that includes young kids, covering the fact that Jabba might sometimes be a girl could take focus away from the fact that he's a big bad space mob boss; you don't want to know about his sexuality or his past or his private life, you just want him to be a bad guy."

The silliest example I saw of that was (a couple of years ago) on the Urban Dictionary page for 'Anakin Solo', where someone had provided something along these lines as a definition:   ""Doesn't exist because Star Wars is only the movies. Glad the little fucker is dead.""   At the opposite end, I don't know of anyone who loves every aspect of the (old) EU.  99% of the people who have read any Legends enjoy parts of it, and are indifferent to, or dislike, other parts.  In terms of Reddit specifically, other than what /u/SiS-Shadowman points out, the reception the EU gets depends on mostly two things:  (This is a bit of a TL;DR)  1) The sub you're in.  2) The part of the EU under discussion.    On /r/StarWars, you'll find a lot more negativity directed towards the New Jedi Order than you would here for example, and Legacy Of The Force and Fate Of The Jedi have a particularly difficult time over there.  I find it quite interesting actually; While I find the criticisms of LOTF and FOTJ to be the same between the two subs, I think that the larger crowd at /r/StarWars gets a much bigger hive-mind going on some things, and some people will just downvote LOTF and FOTJ topics for the sake of it.  (Also, could you provide a source on JJ knocking the EU? This is the first I've heard about it.)"
StarWarsEU,330m7a,AUS_Doug,3,Sat Apr 18 10:42:48 2015 UTC,"I don't really know how many don't like the EU, nor do I care much about it (or the opposite for that matter).  There's a lot of stuff about the EU I really like (Thrawn Triology, X-Wing Series, Republic Commando) and those are the books I cherish.  However I didn't notice that much hate for  the EU. Since you're mentioning reddit, I feel the need to share my experience: Every now and then I read from a person that claims ""reddit can't make up its mind"", ""subreddit XYZ can't make up its mind"". The reason for that is that even within the same subreddit, you won't have the same (or even similar) set of people commenting / voting on a topic. So depending on which way such a binary discussion falls, you will probably see those on the ""wrong"" side simply leave the thread - giving everyone else the impression that it's a clear and cut case. Once a new thread sways into the opposite direction - the people on the now ""wrong"" side leave - making it appear as if the subreddit can't make up its mind."
StarWarsEU,330m7a,SiS-Shadowman,3,Sat Apr 18 10:04:59 2015 UTC,"Honestly, there has always been hate for the EU. People scron it because it's ""less canon"" so that means it can't be telling a good story right? And, ""Why does it matter? They're just movies."" And,  this guy.    I've seen more obvious scorn since the Legends banner came into being but honestly not as much as I expected. Recently I've met a ton of people who genuinely enjoy it whether canon or not.

What if the first order is the empire trying to take back worlds from the republic. The awakening in the dark could be kylo ren rallying the forces of the empire to take back their worlds. We don't know the republic is not on their way to deal with the empire, but the planet has its own resistance group. I know I wouldn't sit around and wait weeks or months under control to have a full scale war go on over my planet."
StarWarsEU,32vyn6,edipil,1 point,Fri Apr 17 15:16:52 2015 UTC,"My theory is that the Empire has gone through reform, hence the new name, with new leadership quite different from Palpatine and still has a strong hold over the majority of the galaxy meanwhile the Rebellion is referred to as the Resistance now because they have made a significant dent in the systems the Empire controls, and have become more than just a little rebellion, but haven't taken control of enough systems to be recognized/established as a strong galactic government next to the Empire/First Order"
StarWarsEU,32vyn6,lupicorn,1 point,Sat Apr 18 15:57:15 2015 UTC,The Battlefront synopsis refers to both the New Republic and the Imperial remnants. Likely the Empire was throttled so bad that they reformed and the New Republic has specific resistance fighters for dealing with them. It's a safe merger between the big gov't of the prequels and the gung-ho 'murca of the originals.
StarWarsEU,32vyn6,Bigglesworthicus,0,Sun Apr 19 00:44:49 2015 UTC,"I reckon that the First Order is just a rebranding of the old Empire affected by whatever COMPNOR staff and Moffs manage to seize control. They choose the name because without the Emperor, it isn't really an Empire and the inclusion of 'order' in the name gives them the image of the faction opposing the chaos of the rebellion and upholding Palpatine's ideology; The New Order. They display propaganda which shows them as the government that rescued the Republic from discord and corruption, and crushed the Seperatists. They damn the rebellion as a group of terrorists bent on throwing civilisation into chaos, and stir the populace into a patriotic frenzy to quash 'unimperial behaviour'.  In the face of this fanaticism from the reeling Empire, the Rebellion decides to give itself an air of legitimacy. It decides to rename itself, replacing their image as a group of petulant vagabonds and upstarts with a reputation for upholding liberty and justice. Several systems notice the alternative provided by the rebel 'terrorists' and openly throw their lot in with them, contributing military equipment and supplies. The rebel leadership declares its new name; the New Republic. Partially to spite the New Order by taking a name that claims inheritance to the legitimacy of the Republic, and to name the fledgeling state forming under its wings.  The newly enlarged rebel fleet converges on an Imperial base in the outer rim, one year after the Empire's defeat at Endor. New Republic intelligence had predicted that a battlegroup of Star Destroyers would be docking at the base above Jakku. The fleet expected to emerge from hyperspace just as the New Order's warships were rearming and taking on fuel, and therefore defenceless. Bothan agents had recently disarmed the base's defense system, so the rebels expected little resistance.  Upon arrival, they realise they had sprung the Empire's trap. Instead of a helpless set of drained destroyers ripe for the plunder, a vast Imperial armada awaits the startled New Republic attackers. It is led by a vast star dreadnought, the Lusankya. Immediately, the Interdictor's maelstrom of artificial gravity seizes the rebel craft. Their fleet of repurposed vast deep space explorers and stolen frigates begins to be shattered under the merciless battering from the Imperial guns.  Arrested in real space and unable to flee, Ackbar orders the fleet into battle formation and prepares to dive into the Empire's throat. Rebel craft disgorge from their carriers and dive into swarms of TIEs with a grim desperation, swatting back the torpedo laden bombers threatening the cruisers. The vast impromptu battleships of the Mon Calamari soak up the Imperial battlegroup's relentless barrage, and tangle themselves into the melee of broadsides. Star destroyers and rebel capital ships plunge into the grasp of Jakku's gravity, the shattered hulks plunging into the desert sands below. Unable to put a dent into the vast Imperial Dreadnought, even with its shields down, the Republic resorts to the only way they were ever able to take an Executor down in the past; ramming into its vulnerable bridge with a doomed fighter.  The two fleets ultimately fight each other into a standstill. The New Order's bruised battlegroup affords the losses much more easily than the rebel armada. While a sizeable portion of several sector's worth of Destroyers had met their fate in the desert skies, the fledgeling New Republic had been shattered. The imperials lick their wounds and limp back deep into N.O. space to refit, while the Moffs prepare retribution upon the renegade confederation of systems. However, the Resistance worlds beacon of hope spreads across sectors and their membership swells across the outer rim. With the support of the shipyards of Dac and the industrial might of the Incom Corporation, the Resistance prepares to stand against the oncoming Imperial onslaught.  After the blow at Jakku, most of the leaders of the rebel movement manage to escape but not without losses. General Solo and Chewbacca found themselves marooned on Jakku, while Wedge Antilles' fighter was forced into the desert by a pack of interceptors as his ejection seat failed. Leia and the two Solo children were marooned with Solo and Chewbacca, but the group is split when an Imperial patrol sent down to finish survivors ambushes them and kidnaps one of the two infants. Han and Chewie are driven into the desert with the Solo's daughter. Leia is captured too, but rebel agents manage to liberate her from Imperial captivity. General Calrissian, Admiral Ackbar, Mon Mothma, Dodonna and Luke Skywalker manage to make it back to Resistance space to set up a provisional government and organise the breakaway states.  The war rages on for the next thirty four years, the Resistance doggedly facing down the reincarnation of Palpatine's legacy. Over this time, Luke's mastery of the force becomes undeniable. He flees the Resistance outpost on Yavin and goes into exile, gibbering of the danger he would pose if he were coerced into opposing his friends.  The fanatic, almost religious zeal of the new Empire shows itself in the Imperial deification of Palpatine's ideology. The Solo's son, named Kylo by an Imperial Moff who adopted him, makes use of his force sensitivity to hone himself into a competent warrior. Rumour eventually circulates through Imperial circles that the young man is the descendant of Vader, and more fanatic elements of the N.O.'s establishment speculate on whether or not he is the Sith Lord's reincarnation. He becomes a figure of adoration in Imperial Society, and takes a position in the military as a force-sensitive advisor to the Moff Council. He acts as a sort of 'court wizard', and an almost cult-like following develops around him. He is granted his own brigade of Stormtroopers to aid him in searching through the Emperor's abandoned storehouses and far flung worlds for relics to aid the Imperial cause. The Imperial war machine is fuelled with ancient, almost arcane power dug deep from the late Emperor's distant vaults.  Kylo Ren has the ear of the N.O.'s head of state, a former Inquisitor turned sector Moff, Supreme Leader Snoke. Ren acts as Snoke's enforcer, and they begin to see each other as the rightful replacements to Palpatine and Vader.  Luke realises the jeopardy he finds himself in. As Vader's son and the ability to prove it, he realises that he would have a chance at becoming the new Emperor if the First Order knew of his continued existence. He was assumed to have been killed at Jakku due to the reckless abandon through which the Imperial picket-cruisers tore through rebel fighters. He removes himself as far as possible from the conflict.  Rey is stolen from Han and Chewie while they are on Jakku by a scavenger ganger in need to sell something. He brings her up as his daughter, unable to bring himself to sell the child into slavery to fund his debts. She becomes a scavver with her 'father', and lives a life of danger on the run from rival gangs and scrambling through the bowels of dead starships. Han and Chewie are distraught, stranded on a distant world and separated from their friends and with the Solo children gone. They vow to get the Falcon working again, find Rey, and get back to the rebellion. However, they gradually become absorbed into the anarchic wasteland society. Their status as heroes of some faraway revolution means nothing to the roving tribes of scavengers and vagabonds.  Years later, an ace of the Resistance's fighter corps by the name of POE DAMERON is assigned by Intelligence to track down Leia's daughter. He sets of to Jakku, but is waylaid by an Imperial squadron led by a man searching for a powerful asset to bring back to the NEW ORDER."
StarWarsEU,32vrc1,BeesInABar,7,Fri Apr 17 02:52:46 2015 UTC,"A series set in between 1 and 2 would be nice. 10 years is a long time, and you can introduce new characters that die before episode 2, and explore old characters."

StarWarsEU,32vrc1,VegasSaint9,7,Fri Apr 17 03:39:12 2015 UTC,A whole Plagueis-styled novel about Dooku would be amazing. His PoV sections in Revenge of the Sith were a great read.

Tackle things like the background of Wedge, or the squadrons in general, Valorum, Obi-Wan's training, Qui-Gon's training, Dooku's fall, that sort of stuff.   Aside from that, I'd love an ongoing about Anakin and Obi-Wan pre-AOTC.  Edit: It would be awesome to have a series of miniseries, or an episodic ongoing about the Jedi featured in the prequels.

The Clone Wars is a great show, but to me it just feels so disconnected from the films.  Personally, I'd like to see a Han Solo miniseries recanonizing his tenure as an Imperial cadet and describing the events that led to him meeting Chewbacca. A pre-Episode I series featuring the adventures of Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan would be nice too. It could begin with Qui-Gon choosing to train Obi-Wan and lead right up to them being tasked by Chancellor Valorum to help resolve the blockade of Naboo."

I loved how they characterized Anakin in that show. His fight with Asajj Ventress on Yavin was amazing. Also: It justified Grievous in RotS. In the new Clone Wars he was just a pest. The old...wow he was quite the Jedi-slaying machine.
StarWarsEU,32vrc1,VegasSaint9,1 point,Tue Apr 21 15:58:08 2015 UTC,A Qui-Gon/Obi Wan series. Boba Fett/other bounty hunters. Han Solo/Chewie. General Grievous. Dooku. Mace Windu mini series.

Ditto for Bane. I'm in favor of pretty much anything from the Old Republic (Revan, Malgus, etc).  Love Shadows of Zahn but don't think it will happen.  For what would be realistic, I'd love to see some things they could pull from Legends. Maybe a Rahm Kota story without Starkiller, maybe some of the stuff from Dark Times (K'kruhk, Dass Jennir).  I'm curios to see what happens with Quinlan Vos and if he survives and gets darker could be a good arc.   Cad Bane and Boba Fett arcs to find out what happens. Heck all the bounty hunters from TCW would be good."

I am really hoping it is his wife or child, but I doubt it.   Assuming Han meant the Falcon, why is he happy to be home with weapons drawn? Where's the Falcon been and who needs a pair of guns in their face during the homecoming.   I think he means back in action. Out of the game for a while and back with guns blazing.   Are the differences in troopers armor related to separate governments or separate roles? 30 years after the fall of the Emporer, are these Imperial Remnants in a de facto civil war?   Roles, I think."

I thought the Coruscant intrigue was a refreshing conflict and also a logical one considering that I could imagine the average, non-force user easily believing that the Jedi were the source of the problem because 1) they have a harder time understanding the force and 2) the conflicts of the galaxy involve jedi.    I also like the tie in to the Clone Wars.  It was really cool to have that continuity, even though the Mortis arc in the Clone Wars was a short and isolated incident.  I really liked how it seemed as though the Star Wars universe was starting the become better linked, with ties spanning across eras and less conflicting story arcs from different authors.  However, that is all gone now.  With regards to Abeloth, I think she was somewhat poorly developed; I never felt fully comfortable with how quickly she went from being essentially indestructible to defeated in the end when the only difference I can remember was that she had multiple entities in different places.  However, I think that was part of what made the series cool: there was a more creative threat to the galaxy than just another sith lord."
StarWarsEU,32pcbx,SithSidious,2,Thu Apr 16 03:36:00 2015 UTC,"""more creative threat to the galaxy than just another sith lord"".   Yes. She made a volcano with the Force. A fucking Force-volcano! Can you imagine if ""Force Volcano"" became a common in-canon power?"
StarWarsEU,32pcbx,littleTARDIS,1 point,Thu Apr 16 11:24:09 2015 UTC,"A few things to keep in mind.  1) Many of the Star Wars novel readers have not seen The Clone Wars tv show. It's always tough referencing something from one medium in another medium, because you don't know how many people consume both forms of media. I have not watched much of the Clone Wars tv show, though I did start it a bit ago and am up to episode 7 or 8 of season 1. I am not a fan of tv shows and their massive time commitment so I find it hard to wade through the ""filler"" episodes. Therefore I have no idea wtf the Mortis thing is even now. It would have been fine if it had been adequately explained in the FotJ books, but it wasn't. It just came out of left field near the end of the series and expected you to know a bunch of stuff that wasn't from movies or other books.  2) Abeloth was not a well-defined or interesting villain. She was this evil thing that could shapshift and was really powerful and had tentacles. That's about it, really, that we know for sure. Her characterization was fuzzy (which unfortunately happens in multi-author series). At least LotF had villains that made sense even if the authors changed their characters to fit the plot (Lumiya, Jacen, Alema).  3) I disagree about the internal struggles on Coruscant being better than in LotF. I liked that they avoided yet another war, but to me the stuff with the Moff was no more interesting than Jacen's slow rise to power and issues with Omas and the Mon Calamari Admiral (forgot her name). The Jaina and Jag stuff was pretty interesting, true, but it should have been more a part of the story, such as Jaina and Jag being the main characters for the ""good guys"" from the beginning.  At least FotJ didn't kill off anyone I particularly cared about, though. Not sure if that is a good thing or a bad thing (because I didn't care enough about the new characters to feel bad if one died)."

The late Legends EU had a serious habit of offing characters that still had room to grow, and replacing them with characters that no one gave a shit about or just giving Luke more page time. It went from a massively diverse galaxy in the Bantam and NJO eras, to being ""the adventures of the Skywalker/Solo clan"", and I feel like that really hurt the overall storytelling for the EU as a whole. And this is coming from a Jacen Solo fanboy, too."

I'll deal with 1 first:  By what metric do you measure a particular series level of Star Wars?  If you say that the OT are Star Wars, then there are plenty of other EU works that I'd argue aren't Star Wars.  NJO is the most prominent one, with it's extra-galactic xenophobic aliens who murder billions.  Compare it the Harry Potter novels if you will.  The first and last novels there are entirely different books, and both are quite good.........but which one them is Harry Potter and which isn't?  If LOTF can't be Star Wars, then I don't see how Deathly Hallows can be Harry Potter if Philosopher's Stone is, or vice-versa.    Number 2:  I've only read through LOTF, in it's entirety, once.  I find everything pre-Sacrifice to be slow and hard to read.  But, from the last few chapters of Sacrifice - i.e, from the beginning of 'the fight' - onwards, it is brilliant.  You have to read the entirety of the series, as painful as the first few books may be.  When I picked up Vector Prime, I had real trouble getting through it; ""God, if the other twenty books are like this.........""  But, having read NJO several times, I now appreciate more the hard task which fell to Salvatore with that novel; He had to introduce to the scariest, most horrendously savage big-bads we've ever had.  The guys that will drop a FU*KING MOON ON A PLANET, and kill one off one the heroes in the process.  And yes, at times it wasn't done well, but when it was.........  I have to look at the first few books of LOTF the same way; They were taking one the more popular EU characters - plenty of people grew up 'with' Jacen, reading the Young Jedi Knights novels - and playing with his new and radical understanding of the Force that came from Traitor and his time on Zanoma Sekot in NJO."
StarWarsEU,32l404,AUS_Doug,16,Wed Apr 15 01:34:18 2015 UTC,This is why everything was retconned by Disney they say the eu as a train wreck and it is.  They killed many birds with one stone this way.

Reading the Unifying Force was the peak of my Star Wars EU interest.  And the Legacy books were so awful, I stopped reading. Specifically, I put down the book midway and never read another. It was in the one Karen Traviss wrote, during a scene where Jacen inexplicably uses the force to torture Boba Fett's long lost daughter.  My mind took in that scene, and couldn't recognize any 'Star Wars' in it. It was so far removed from what I wanted to read about, I rejected it wholesale.  And that's the story of that."

The only new Star Wars book I've picked up since then was Millenium Falcon which was okay.  Legacy of the Force killed the EU for me.  Disney mercifully put it out of its misery.

It looks like Lords of the Sith will take over as to what to read after RotS (unless you read Kenobi first, which I found very entertaining). Tarkin, gave me a nice closure to James Luceno's novels that he wrote during the prequel era. I still have to read Cloak of Deception, but I plan to read that after I dip into the Jedi Apprentices series.   I found it easier to read preANH stories as it is easier to know which ones are close enough to the canon stories to fit them in together.

Everything pretty much demands that you've read everything else up to that point, and it's just a huge nightmare.

Accepting that people die. Some really deep shit. Then they just kind of went, ""Nope, Vergere was evil and so that means Jacen is too."""

He was afraid for allana because of Darth Krayt and that caused him to do stupid stuff.  I like to think that a gradual descent into the dark side or evil, even in the real world, is a lot harder to see in yourself when all that's presented to you is diverging choices and you're taking the next logical step."

I don't give a damn. None shall pass."" ―Nom Anor and Ganner Rhysode[src] The Battle of the World-Well took place in 27 ABY at the Well of the World Brain on Yuuzhan Vong-occupied Coruscant. Jedi Jacen Solo and Ganner Rhysode were led to the Well by several thousand Yuuzhan Vong warriors in order for Solo, who had pretended to convert to the Yuuzhan Vong religion while in captivity, to sacrifice Rhysode. Instead, Rhysode accepted his own lifelong desire to be a hero, channeling it into a strength as he engaged the thousands of Yuuzhan Vong at the entrance to the Well while Solo communed with the World Brain, turning it to his side. Rhysode engaged the warriors first one-on-one, but as he proved unable to be defeated they came in greater numbers. Rhysode became completely one with the Force, slaying all the warriors who came against him until there were none left, buying time for Solo. Finally, when faced with a tank beast and infantry, Rhysode brought down the ceiling, killing himself and his opponents. Solo was able to escape with the aid of his mentor Vergere, returning to the New Republic. Rhysode's display of skill and strength earned him tremendous respect among the Yuuzhan Vong warrior caste, as well as gaining him a place in the *Jeedai heresy and entering the Yuuzhan Vong religious pantheon. Solo's conversion of the World Brain and return to the New Republic proved vital in finally defeating the Yuuzhan Vong and retaking Coruscant.

And while I don't think I can hold Borleias, I might be able to make it a name that causes little Vong children to whimper."" ―Wedge Antilles[src] The Battle of Borleias consisted of a series of last-stand actions by the New Republic forces during the Yuuzhan Vong War after the Fall of Coruscant. It commenced with the New Republic's Fleet Group Three retaking the planet Borleias from a Yuuzhan Vong occupation force following their retreat from Coruscant, the galactic capital. Senator Pwoe and his advisors later arrived on the planet and ordered the commander of Fleet Group Three, General Wedge Antilles, to hold Borleias in a delaying action. Antilles complied, but only under the condition that there would be no more political influence in his defensive actions and requisitioned additional military forces for his command. As expected, the Yuuzhan Vong sent a fleet to retake Borleias under Wyrpuuk Cha. While Antilles had planned to whittle away at Cha's forces in a war of attrition, the sudden arrival of the Star Dreadnought Lusankya as part of Antilles' reinforcements inflicted severe damage on Cha's fleet. In response, the Yuuzhan Vong sent a much larger force to seize the planet under noted strategist Czulkang Lah. Lah's goals were to seize the planet, destroy a supposed New Republic superweapon called the Starlancer Project, and capture Jedi Knight Jaina Solo. The Yuuzhan Vong's goals were thwarted early by Antilles' use of orbital bombardment to stall a ground advance, but Lah was soon reinforced and began slowly overwhelming the garrison. However, Antilles deceived Lah, as Project Starlancer was a fake designed only to dictate Lah's responses. While the Yuuzhan Vong successfully retook Borleias from the New Republic garrison, they suffered heavy losses, including the death of Czulkang Lah and the loss of a Koros-Strohna worldship thanks to the use of Lusankya as a ramship. Antilles and his forces evacuated the planet after a sustained defense that cost the Yuuzhan Vong heavily. As a result of New Republic personnel, volunteers and Jedi such as Wedge Antilles, Tycho Celchu, Lando Calrissian, Luke Skywalker, Jaina Solo, Kyp Durron, and Jagged Fel, the New Republic was able to buy some breathing room from the Yuuzhan Vong invasion, which eventually allowed the election of Cal Omas and the formation of the Galactic Alliance. Also, the battle helped inflate Solo's reputation as an avatar of Yun-Harla, a Yuuzhan Vong deity.

In addition to that, I think some fans didn't like the bio-tech of the Vong because it didn't really fit into the theme/flavor of Star Wars. Kind of like how Star Trek has lots of clean sets in the movies while Star Wars looks more lived-in.  Personally, I think NJO was the best book series at the time because it made the story feel real.  I mean, I know the books are fictional, but I felt invested in the story and felt a connection with the characters. The good guys were losing, and dying, and it made things much more believable when I read them. It wasn't just another good guys win story like all the ones before it."

But you said you don't understand the opposite point of view so I thought I might shed some light on the issue for you.    Up until the NJO happened, the EU was a very easy escape. It was vast so you never had to be sad about the end of a book because there was always the next book. There was comfort in the familiarity of a repeated plot. You never really had to have anxiety over whether your favorite character would die. You didn't have to think about the tough choices that real life presents you: what really is right and wrong? and, where is the line between good intentions and their actual outcomes? It was just for enjoyment. It was just for fun. It was safe.    And I know none of that actually makes a story good. But I think people were used to it. So Vector Prime was kind of a hard slap in the face with reality, which isn't usually a pleasant experience.

Unlike Bantam, they insisted on these sprawling, multiauthor storylines that always became a huge clusterfuck that kept changing focus and tone from book to book.  The average quality was largely better, especially in NJO, but in the Bantam years it's possible to name a handful of well written self-contained series that stand well together. The rest, Crystal Star, Darksaber, etc, can be safely skipped with no loss.   You can do no such thing for NJO. You largely have to take it as a whole, the good with the bad, even as it careens all over the place. Not a terrible read, but an inferior one.  The prequel stories were somewhat better, but mostly because  they were allowed to stand alone, with only loose ties from series to series."

Sorry if I don't remember the details, it's been a while. That being said, I really enjoyed the series as a whole, but not so much the stuff after it. I've tried re-reading the whole thing and can't seem to get past book 3 or 4. I'll try to give it another go."
StarWarsEU,32caed,Canesjags4life,3,Mon Apr 13 01:27:15 2015 UTC,"Well when they infiltrated Coruscant they were on a well of force energy. So that was quite different. I wasnt the biggest fan of the two Han Solo novels, but just get through to Star by Star. Easily one of the best Star Wars books in general."

StarWarsEU,32caed,qwartx,8,Fri Apr 17 05:14:22 2015 UTC,"As a huge fan for over 20 years of the EU, I can tell you my original problem with the NJO had nothing to do with any character death(s). My problem stemmed from the quality (intermittent) of the writing and the varying (wildly) of the capabilities of the Vong.  In some books a few of their fighters can chew through anything and their singularity-based shields are at time just shields that can be overwhelmed, at other times they can cause fusion explosions by sucking in hydrogen gas. In some books it's almost back to star wars with ship to ship engagements, then there's a sudden biological increase and their newest generation is suddenly back to being undefeatable.   That said, overall with the distance of years and liking things that came later out of that series, I liked reading, most of it."
StarWarsEU,32caed,Argoti,5,Sun Apr 12 18:47:30 2015 UTC,If I remember right they do explain the back and forth of ship powers with changing tactics/tech on the Galaxy's side and the Vong shaper bioengineering around it. Definitely happens in the last book and I remember it being mentioned in other books.
StarWarsEU,32caed,TheDemonClown,8,Sun Apr 12 20:13:25 2015 UTC,"Yeah, starfighters being able to counteract dovin basals by tagging it with low-power shots to lull them into security & then hammering them with a full-power salvo was one of the first tricks the GFFA pilots learned, and it remained surprisingly effective the whole war."
StarWarsEU,32caed,Argoti,1 point,Mon Apr 13 05:31:34 2015 UTC,Yeah I think the Vong finally countered it in the final book. It's been almost a year since I read so I forget how.
StarWarsEU,32caed,TheDemonClown,3,Mon Apr 13 05:36:23 2015 UTC,"Honestly, it seems like all they'd have to do is train the basals not to fall for it, like how you'd housebreak a dog. That was why it worked so long - dovin basals are powerful, but also fucking stupid."
StarWarsEU,32caed,Ghostkill221,2,Mon Apr 13 05:42:20 2015 UTC,"IIRC the trick was to fire a bust of shots in a slightly spread out pattern, with 3 weaker shots hitting the area in a slightly wide pattern before a full power shot hit the exact center of their target. dovin basals were having to strain themselves having to move and stretch the singularity rapidly across the feild of incoming fire, and it meant they the final shot cause the dovin basals to suffer a lot more strain exhausting them pretty quickly which led to dovin basals acting a lot more like typical shields."
StarWarsEU,32caed,namer98,3,Mon Apr 13 15:46:07 2015 UTC,I did a reread of all the books in like 4 months. I agree with the wildly variant capabilities.
StarWarsEU,32caed,Rizzan8,6,Mon Apr 13 01:47:52 2015 UTC,In MY opinion NJO was one of the best things storywise that happened to EU. I liked that the autors had balls to kill you-know-who. But I can't deny the fact that some books suffered from bad writting.
StarWarsEU,32caed,Ghostkill221,1 point,Sun Apr 12 19:48:51 2015 UTC,"Yeah if i could have the series just go Movies, Thrawn, NJO, with the Xwing, and Katarn books scattered in a long sides It would be a lot better IMO.  (maybe the Kyp Durron books as well but IDK)"
StarWarsEU,32caed,timscheller95,4,Mon Apr 13 15:47:40 2015 UTC,"I think star wars fans tend to get more and more disillusioned with the EU the farther you get away from the movies. They aren't too mad about say, The Trawn Trilogy, because it feels close the movies. Eventually you get to the YV and crazy tech and people feel like it's not ""Star Wars"" anymore."
StarWarsEU,32caed,gameld,6,Mon Apr 13 03:48:33 2015 UTC,"I, for one, don't like NJO because of a couple of reasons.  First, it continues a problem in the EU that is best described by Lieutenant Gordon in Batman Begins:    Jim Gordon: What about escalation?  Batman: Escalation?  Jim Gordon: We start carrying semi-automatics, they buy automatics. We start wearing Kevlar, they buy armor piercing rounds.   Star Wars starts off with a pretty big hammer: the Death Star, a planet-destroying superlaser that is surrounded by a ridiculous amount of armor and guns manned by millions with an insane amount of fighter support (that was woefully under-used).  Then the second movie is all about the people, and then they threaten the galaxy with another Death Star in the third. It's like they said, ""It worked once, why not again?"" I'm not saying it didn't, but it was a redoing of the previous menace.  And then the EU comes along and provides superweapon after super weapon (Sun Crusher, Death Star prototype, The Eye of Palpatine, rebuilt superlaser without the whole Death Star, World Destroyers, the Galaxy Gun, etc. etc. etc.). The BBEG's superweapon was the name of the game for EU writers.  The biggest exception to any of these was Thrawn. Yes, he had new tech (not going to give away spoilers), but they weren't superweapons in the vein of the Death Star- they were tactical weapons. They were manipulative instead of forceful (no pun intended). Thrawn found a way around problems instead of through them. He was so good at it one of his tactics was to fake superweapons. Thrawn was such a different villain than any of the others in the EU because he so ridiculously intelligent.   And then there were the Vong. They had (from the little bit I read) unbeatable armor made out of plants. They had ships that were worlds. They destroyed a planet by throwing its moon at it. They were the nuke in the war of escalation in the EU- the be-all-end-all weapon. There's simply no topping what they had.  And then there's the Force- or lack thereof. Their immunity to the Force was based on a stupid manipulation of semantics from ANH.   When telling Luke about the Force for the first time, Obi-wan says, ""It's an energy field created by all living things. It surrounds us and penetrates us; it binds the galaxy together.""   Did you catch the important part? ""...it binds the galaxy together.""   So some writer got the idea that if it only binds the galaxy together, not the universe, then something from outside of the galaxy could be immune to the Force- you know, that thing that is central to the story? The source of power for the rebuilding of the Jedi Knights which is the point of Star Wars in so many ways? The replacement for God (specifically the Christian idea of the Holy Spirit)? The source of all life?   So now you have superweapons, which have traditionally been beaten by the Force guiding someone in how to defeat it, that are immune to the Force. I say this is unacceptable. When Obi-Wan was speaking he wasn't saying the Force was limited to the galaxy- he was using an idiom like we would say, ""The ends of the Earth,"" or, ""the world."" He was speaking about the extent of his experience and concern, not the technical limitations.  So yes, I very much dislike the Vong and what they did to the story of Star Wars. I dislike their claim upon this galaxy because, in every conceivable way, they have no part in it. They truly don't belong.   But with the end of the war against the Empire and the establishment of the New Republic they thought they needed a new enemy to fight. The EU authors wanted to continue telling stories of galactic scale instead of considering their original source material: Authurian legend. They could have re-established the Jedi and then gone on to tell the stories of oh-so-many knights doing great deeds for small places. Much of Authurian legend is focused on the various deeds of the knights independently of one another- off in some fantasy land fighting their way through dragons and witches. Aurthur himself has little role except as context to the other knights' deeds of valor.   The same could have been done with Luke in the place of Aurthur (who was his model in many ways). After the Knights of the Holotable were established they each go and do their own work. You have the story of Corran Horn off fighting a monster that has been plaguing a Corellian outpost (i.e. St. George and the Dragon), or use Tionne Solusar to tell of some great place of evil that inspires Kyle Katarn to go seek it out.  This is what a New Jedi Order could have been instead of constantly trying to up the stakes on the galactic scale. Certainly occasionally Luke, Leia, and the others would show up as cameos, and sometimes there would be a threat on the galactic scale for them to join (Aurthur marched on Rome, after all), but mostly they wouldn't need to be more than context.   The establishment of a peaceful rule over all would have been a great boon to all and, in my opinion, the storytelling of Star Wars in general."
StarWarsEU,32caed,klove861,1 point,Tue Apr 14 03:07:29 2015 UTC,"I think to assume that the force is present in the entire universe would be very fallacious. With the truly staggering scale on which an entire galaxy is placed, I don't think it is would be ridiculous to think that life and the fabric of it could have developed differently.   I think it would be analogous to assuming that every form of life is carbon-based. It maybe be extremely difficult to comprehend something different, but does that mean it cannot exist? Of course not, we don't know every single law of the universe, and neither do those in the star wars universe."
StarWarsEU,32caed,Malkavon,2,Fri Apr 17 22:52:19 2015 UTC,"NJO has some stand-outs (Traitor and Rebel Dream/Rebel Stand in particular), but overall I found the writing quality to be pretty mediocre. Also, the plot hinges on a whole bunch of people being completely and utterly incompetent for way too long to be even remotely believable. Especially when other books established those characters as being actually functional beings.  However, my towering contempt is reserved for the stuff that follows the NJO. In particular, literally everything that happens with Jacen's characterization."

Up until then, I had dutifully followed along and read every book as they were released. I didn't particularly HATE the NJO (some of it was very exciting), it was just a slog of content. Nothing of that length had been attempted in the EU before...trying to follow along as it was released was frankly a pain in the ass.  I guess I just like my Star Wars stories as trilogies/duologies/one-offs/etc. Maybe it would be different if I went back and tried to get through it nowadays. The complete story is available.   TL;DR: I don't hate it, but I never finished it. It was too damn long and I got sick of waiting for the story to wrap up."

I don't disagree to be honest, but I still enjoyed the series."
StarWarsEU,32caed,blade55555,1 point,Tue Apr 14 10:39:51 2015 UTC,"I can see why others don't like it. It can be seen as overly dark and can see like it is trying to top past works in scale. I'm currently on book 6 and I actually really like it. I liked killing off Chewie, it shows that original trilogy characters are not immortal. I also like the Post-ROTJ EU in these books stopping the entire focus on the original trilogy characters. It is refreshing to experience the new generation of Jedi. I like the scale of the story and the desperation the invasion causes. This isn't like some dumb Imperial warlord trying the reclaim the Empire of old. No these are almost unstoppable monsters that aren't even affected by the force. I also like the politics of the story, at times Borsk Fey'la is frustrating but the overall feeling of the political system falling apart at the seams just adds the desperation to stop the Yuuzhan Vong. The only thing I really haven't liked so far is Vector Prime. That book was so boring and it felt like it had 3 different climaxes.   Also one thing that I have heard people gripe about but I like is the large series with multiple authors. The Bantam books were all largely different stories with some trilogies thrown in. It was refreshing to be reading a EU story that felt as large spanning as the movies. I really liked just reading this long serial of stories."

StarWarsEU,32caed,TheDemonClown,0,Sun Apr 12 18:44:07 2015 UTC,"To me, the Vector Prime version of the Vong felt like a big stinking caricature of a villain-sue, who were random and weird for the sake of it. The plot was dull and forgettable, the characters meh, and all in all it was a terrible introduction to something that would so thoroughly shake up the established order."
StarWarsEU,32caed,Timballist0,2,Mon Apr 13 08:23:20 2015 UTC,"It was slow-paced, but I didn't find the Yuuzhan Vong to ""be weird for the sake of it"" at all. They were simply alien, in a way that only a species from another galaxy with a whole different status quo can be."

There's no journey for him. Good character but this is not his story.  But then I realised that almost none of the characters learn anything or go through any change. Jar Jar is the only character with any kind of arc. He goes from being the outcast among the Gungans to being a general - from being a coward to a hero.  But really, it's an ensemble. Primarily, Qui-Gon, Anakin, Jar-Jar and Padmé. But really, there is no main character. None of them own the story. It's not the story of any of them really. But that's mostly down to bad writing."

StarWarsEU,323g84,alfonsoelsabio,3,Fri Apr 10 19:01:19 2015 UTC,"I mean, his death was admittedly rather weak. I loved Allston's earlier stuff, but Mercy Kill was just fan service, and it wasn't his best work. He didn't have a ton of creative freedom, and he tried too hard for theme and what he thought fans wanted (the return of familiar characters and locations), and the story suffered."
StarWarsEU,323g84,Saith_Cassus,2,Sat Apr 11 01:43:34 2015 UTC,"Sure, but that doesn't mean there's anything wrong with the essence of the character. Just the plot of that book.  And yeah, there's no question in my mind that Mercy Kill was the weakest X-wing book."

StarWarsEU,323g84,GodotIsWaiting4U,10,Fri Apr 10 14:13:49 2015 UTC,"And Luuke, with two u's, was part of the Thrawn trilogy, some of the greatest and best-loved works in the EU. You know that, right?"
StarWarsEU,323g84,AUS_Doug,9,Sat Apr 11 01:15:16 2015 UTC,"Further, that Luuke made sense, because of how the C'baoth clone pronounced his own name?"
StarWarsEU,323g84,alfonsoelsabio,9,Sat Apr 11 01:22:36 2015 UTC,Still silly though. But such a minor thing in a great trilogy.
StarWarsEU,323g84,asterioskokkinos,2,Sat Apr 11 02:10:26 2015 UTC,It's entirely possible to both like the Thrawn trilogy AND think Luuke is a dumb idea and a dumb name.
StarWarsEU,323g84,Canesjags4life,28,Mon May 25 04:27:26 2015 UTC,Luuke clone wasn't that bizarre at least the way Zahn explained it
StarWarsEU,323g84,lysosome,17,Fri Apr 10 07:55:28 2015 UTC,"The clone wasn't stupid, but the convention of adding a 'u' to the names of all clones was. What happens when you clone someone who doesn't have a 'u' in their name? Does the cloning process fail? Is that the real reason that mass-producing clones was difficult?"
StarWarsEU,323g84,The_Last_Minority,9,Fri Apr 10 20:39:49 2015 UTC,"I was under the impression that the 'u' thing was specific to these two. Jorus C'baoth became Joruus for whatever reason, and he was the one who created Luuke, keeping the same naming convention as himself, no? He created his own apprentice, so why not give him the same name change?  Or I could be totally wrong."
StarWarsEU,323g84,lysosome,3,Fri Apr 10 21:57:24 2015 UTC,"I don't think the extra 'u' was ever explained for either of them, but I vaguely remember that Joruus didn't know (or at least didn't admit) that he was a clone.  It isn't really that dumb but everything else in those books was so good it sticks out."
StarWarsEU,323g84,x73rmin8r,3,Fri Apr 10 22:06:53 2015 UTC,"I think the extra ""u"" wasn't actually literally an extra ""u"". Like if they signed their name it wouldn't have extra vowels in it.  IIRC, Thrawn explained it as a ""mispronunciation "". Some kind of cloning brain damage gave clones a speech impediment, evidently."
StarWarsEU,323g84,ricree,1 point,Fri Apr 10 23:18:17 2015 UTC,"Agreed, there was nothing wrong with the clone plot, but the naming convention was odd. I get that he wanted an easy way to distinguish the two through an extended fight scene, but that was contrived."
StarWarsEU,323g84,Canesjags4life,5,Mon Apr 13 08:48:27 2015 UTC,"Was that from the Thrawn trilogy? Because I quite enjoyed those books back in the day, and Luuke is ringing a bell for me."

Not necessarily the star part. It's overpowered, but whatever.

Were they true? Maybe, maybe not, who knows?  The idea with Tales was that it was a creator showcase, where any writer or artist could show off Star Wars stories, but in order to give them the freedom they needed, Tales stories were non-canon until declared otherwise."

StarWarsEU,323g84,Timballist0,7,Fri Apr 10 17:56:33 2015 UTC,"I'm going to vote for Kevin J Anderson.  Everything he wrote had tons of shoehorned connections to the movies (for example Darksaber includes both the Hoth system and Dagobah as major locations and of course they run into the same Wampa from Empire Strikes Back), repeated plots (like using super weapons mimicking the threat of the Death Star), and really poor characterization.  While Zahn did a great job of making an Empire without the Emperor still a credible threat, KJA made them come across like villains who belonged in a really bad Saturday morning cartoon who couldn't help but trip over themselves and screw everything up.  For everything authors like Zahn and Stackpole and Stover did a great job of making an awesome expansion to the movies, authors like KJA made things so bad I honestly am not sure if it's not better to throw everything out and start over."
StarWarsEU,323g84,Oddblivious,8,Sat Apr 11 04:37:45 2015 UTC,Oh I SO agree.  Zahn launched the EU into an awesome high point and then KJA immediately started it's downhill slide.  He really got to cash in on Zahn's success though.

StarWarsEU,323g84,Oddblivious,2,Fri Apr 10 22:19:27 2015 UTC,I think the confusion comes if the night sisters are supposed to be zabrack or not. Obviously they weren't though because the chicks never had horns while female zabrack do

One of the most instantly ""bad"" looking people in the universe since Vader himself. From first glance you knew he was the bad guy.   Bringing him back was questionable, but I actually liked it. It was far fetched but once you accepted his revival the events he concocted were actually awesome. Who would have guessed he could conjure up enough to make a legitimate 3rd power in the galaxy to combat the republic and separatists!  Lastly, you know his resurrection has actually come up in the EU before. I believe it was some monks on some planet that brought him back to fight Vader."

One literally used hatred to make himself invincible. The other ate the life force of an entire planet at once and bound his consciousness to a plate of armor...

Later, he became a slave to the Empire, and was used by his Imperial masters to communicate with other Wookiees. At first, he tried to resist Imperial occupation forces, but forced himself to comply after they executed a dozen women and children from his family unit. His proximity to Imperial officers provided him with information vital to the Alliance's effort to free Kashyyyk. Like most Wookiees, after the Alliance freed Kashyyyk, he felt he owed a life debt to the Alliance. At some point in his life he moved to the capital of Kashyyyk, Rwookrrorro.

What they don't want is for fans to be split down the middle between Legends canon and movie canon; one side excited for a completely different set of stories and products than the other. You might say ""oh but they're missing out on my money"" -no they're not missing your money.   They want the fanbase to move forward as a cohesive unit, and EVERY piece of content released in the future is a way of promoting the sequel trilogy era. A new KOTOR book or a continuation of the Clone Wars in comic form for instance would be completely counterproductive to their goal of uniting the fanbase's excitement for The Force Awakens.  Even the prequel era Kanan comic is totally relative to promoting the new era. Also, what authors out there do you think would be interested in making non-canon stories? None."

Star Wars is trying to avoid doing this to fans at all costs. They actually want people to read the books and comics without getting confused which is why all of them are now considered film-level canon.  It's a bad idea to split the fans, plain and simple. The only thing splitting the fans at this point besides the prequels is all of the EU and clone wars fans bitching about not getting what they think they want but in reality what they want is just plain self-important.

However, all of her children made claims to become Calimondra's heir, so in order to decided which one would inherit her empire, she organized a contest, which she called the Charge Matrica, challenging her children to expand her territories. However, her daughter Xelian soon declared war on Calimondra's son Chagras, resulting in all of her children waging war against each other. Eventually, only Chagras was left, and Calimondra made him her heir. Chagras maintained a shaky peace through the shaky cooperation of several cousins and grandchildren. He also became the titular ruler of an empire known as the Chagras Hegemony. However, Vilia still lived and controlled some holdings.  By 1042 BBY, Chagras was ready to challenge the Galactic Republic. In that year, Xelian's eldest son Sith Lord Odion convinced Vilia to authorize an invasion of Aquilaris Minor under the pretext of capturing the Jedi Knight Vannar Treece, a perennial foe of the Sith. However, the invasion was a cover of his own operation to capture several researchers from the University of Sanbra who were involved in a research project to locate the Helm of Ieldis, an ancient Sith artifact created by Ieldis that was capable of driving sentient beings into a homicidal frenzy. The researchers were then conscripted into a task force known as Project Pandemonium which was tasked with locating the Helm. In 1040 BBY, Chagras was killed after being exposed to a nerve toxin. Calimondra then initiated a second Charge Matrica, pitting her grandchildren against each other to fight for the right to become her heir.

Just like Anakin, if you watch The Clone Wars I think you'll come to appreciate Jar Jar a little more. You see that in the show he makes considerable efforts to improve the Republic and saves his friends on numerous occasions, and that while he's always bumbling and often exacerbates an issue before solving it, he still always succeeds.  In my mind, Jar Jar is an example of how the Force works in mysterious ways. He may not have the mental fortitude or discipline to be a Jedi, but I believe the Force is definitely strong with him."

Viewed as a starting point for further study in the Force, the Council of First Knowledge designated the study of tutaminis to be taught during the very first classes at Jedi academies. While the basics were expected to be mastered upon graduation from the academy, development of these skills would come over an entire life time; for a Jedi was never done learning.  In addition to deflecting energy weapons, this ability could eliminate the harmful effects of other energy based Force powers such as Force lightning. With additional effort, after absorbing a blaster bolt or Force power the user could utilize the absorbed energy to heal his or her wounds or manifest other Force powers.

I think he does a good job of focusing on the main characters but also having interesting secondary plot lines with more minor characters that are still actually really interesting (and are some of the more interesting moments in the books). And since Luceno wrote both, if you like his writing and would want to read Dark Lord, you'd probably enjoy Labyrinth too.

They attempt to Force Push each other at the same time and the result is a stalemate, basically.  Personally, it has to be possible because frankly there's no way any of these duels are possible without it in my head.  EDIT: a word"
StarWarsEU,31xj3l,pjlovesauce,2,Wed Apr 8 22:58:25 2015 UTC,"I also feel like it has to be possible, but I don't know what would stop me from ending a duel before it started by reaching out and crushing my opponent's heart with the Force."
StarWarsEU,31xj3l,Spartan152,3,Thu Apr 9 00:25:08 2015 UTC,"If your opponent can utilize their battle meditation enough to sneak a force push to your feet and knock you down, boom, concentration broken, free moment, lightsaber at your throat.  it was the way to break force grip in Jedi Academy and the entire Jedi Knight series, and mechanic or no, canon or not, it makes sense to me."
StarWarsEU,31xj3l,ricree,1 point,Thu Apr 9 07:19:07 2015 UTC,"But like he said, if you're able to use the force directly on an opponent, someone with decent enough control would have a much easier time killing by ripping the other guy's aorta in half. Or just pinch the corotid artery for a second or two if incapacitation is your goal instead."
StarWarsEU,31xj3l,dingodego,2,Tue Apr 14 02:13:12 2015 UTC,Gah that duel was simply over-dramatized. I think there are other better examples in canon and i will re-edit when i find it.
StarWarsEU,31xj3l,BlueSmoke95,18,Fri Apr 10 19:23:09 2015 UTC,"In Legends, yes.  In canon, there has been no mention of it, though it is assumed."

StarWarsEU,31xj3l,BlueSmoke95,9,Thu Apr 9 01:17:01 2015 UTC,Episode 3 (Anakin vs Obiwan Force Push) is not an example of a Force user preventing another Force-user from doing something to them.  It is an example of equal-power Force Push being applied at the same time.  I think OP was talking about the 'Force-Shield' technique used in Legends that prevented one Force-User from crushing/throwing around another Force-User right off the bat.
StarWarsEU,31xj3l,matty25,4,Thu Apr 9 01:25:40 2015 UTC,Doesn't Yoda block and absorb force lightning in EP II?
StarWarsEU,31xj3l,BlueSmoke95,3,Thu Apr 9 14:04:33 2015 UTC,"I would argue that is activly doing it, rather than having a 'shield' that prevents it out right"
StarWarsEU,31xj3l,matty25,1 point,Thu Apr 9 14:37:10 2015 UTC,"Yeah that is true, Yoda stopping the force lightning (he does it in Episode 3 too against Sidious) is more like a medieval shield where you have to actively use it to block an attack.  I suppose this is space fantasy so shields mostly refer to an encompassing energy field that blocks attacks. I don't know that there is expressly one in Canon but it is kind of implied as more powerful Sith simply don't force choke there opponents at whim."

StarWarsEU,31xj3l,Ginkasa,3,Thu Apr 9 08:56:34 2015 UTC,"Only in the secondary question.  The original was much more general.  Even with the second question, he's not asking about some specific technique named in Legends canon.  He doesn't know.  He's just wondering if there's anything.

StarWarsEU,31xj3l,Canesjags4life,11,Thu Apr 9 00:33:22 2015 UTC,"Choking out their opponent, unless they are a novice padawan, does not prevent the jedi from doing anything. They could still employ their own force techniques or keep on fighting with that lightsaber.   What id imagine is that once combatants are immersed in a lightsaber duel based on their attunement to the force, either the sith or the jedi would get sensations of when concentrated force abilities are being employed. Basically, trying to use a force choke would be pointless as it leaves you open to attacks or your opponent simply blocks it."

Then again, the movies dont seem to have the same rules when it comes to this stuff. I live a sad life."

StarWarsEU,31tua4,idejmcd,1 point,Wed Apr 8 18:58:43 2015 UTC,The way I read the Thrawn Trilogy is not that Joruus C'Baoth uses Battle Meditation but rather use the Force for precise long range Communication - something that seems to be impossible with shields and the chaos of battle.
StarWarsEU,31tua4,JonathanRL,2,Wed Apr 8 16:31:13 2015 UTC,"You're right in a way, but it was more than just communication. He wasn't making their walkie-talkies work better  That feeling of unity, teamwork, the feel of a comrade you know and trust next to you in battle, like a football team or soccer team having great chemistry and all working together, is crucial to success. Have you ever seen a team that didn't have it? It's like watching a bunch of little kids just running around.  What C'Baoth was doing was using the force to give that feeling, that teamwork, to troops across the empire. He was taking a bunch of individual groups spread across huge distances and helping them work as one, lending strength to all. Which did enhance their performance."
StarWarsEU,31tua4,Vultatio,1 point,Wed Apr 8 18:46:00 2015 UTC,I do not agree. Thrawn was the opinion that this was not the way a war should be fought. He argued against the Emperors use of Battle Meditation.

StarWarsEU,31tua4,Vultatio,1 point,Wed Apr 8 18:56:45 2015 UTC,"Because you describe what Battle Meditation does, a technique Thrawn does not agree with. He already creates that chemistry by his victories and treatment of the crew and the Empire at large. That is part of why he is so revered.   My interpretation is that C'Baoth only enabled communications, nothing more. As I will be cosplaying Thrawn in about two weeks, I am pretty confident that my view is correct. We could however just ask Zahn about it :P"
StarWarsEU,31tua4,JonathanRL,1 point,Wed Apr 8 19:05:42 2015 UTC,"I don't remember Thrawn disagreeing with it being used to enhance the performance of the troops. But it's been a couple years since I read the book, so I'm a little hazy.  With that in mind, my original comment was just on what the battle meditation accomplishes, not what was intended with it.  I wonder on the ability of a force user to limit the effects of battle meditation to only one particular thing. I wonder if the force was that precise. Like someone spraying someone else with a high-powered fire hose with only the intention to back them up or disperse a crowd. They would be backed up by the force of the hose, but they would also get wet, even if that wasn't the intention of the person using it.  And as another note, C'Baoth wasn't exactly one to follow orders. I doubt he really cared enough to follow Thrawn's direction to the letter. He thought he was better than Thrawn. That he knew more. Even if Thrawn looked down on enhanced troops, C'Baoth most likely would have done what he thought was best anyways.  edit: But we should definitely ask Zahn! I think that would be an interesting question."
StarWarsEU,31tua4,Vultatio,1 point,Wed Apr 8 19:45:02 2015 UTC,"Well, it seems like Star Wars Wiki agrees with you:   However, he also believed that Palpatine had a Dark Jedi Guardian there, and was aware that such a being would be useful to his campaign; he knew that a powerful Force-sensitive could use battle meditation to increase the efficiency of his forces.  Though Thrawn was losing his patience for C'baoth's antics, he still relied on him, knowing his battle meditation ability was indispensable."

If you haven't played the games, it'll be a decent read.  Not on the same level as Darth Bane, but good.  It was my very first Star Wars novel and I thought it was great.  There are definitely better, but people typically play it up as terrible because they didn't like the direction one of their most beloved characters (Revan or the Exile) took."
StarWarsEU,31n403,GodotIsWaiting4U,2,Mon Apr 6 22:49:30 2015 UTC,"Drew Karpyshyn's been on a downward slide since he wrote Knights of the Old Republic. Darth Bane: Path of Destruction was fantastic, I'll agree, but in my opinion Rule of Two was a bit weaker, and then we had Dynasty of Evil, which I actually hated because the action sequences were too long and written like a high schooler's Bleach fanfic, but more importantly because it was a book that just felt relentlessly and pointless cruel to its characters. I'm not squeamish or anything or uncomfortable with villain protagonists, but I feel like in a story there should be some REASON why bad things happen to the characters, at least sometimes. DoE just seemed to be like ""why are we making these people suffer and die? BECAUSE WE CAN.""  The story ultimately goes nowhere and is just an excuse for Bane and Zannah to murder people, and Bane and Zannah are in exactly the same position story-wise going into the final chapter that they were at the start of chapter 1. The final chapter has an actual POINT to it and finally does something that actually matters, but until then it's just Sith wank.  Revan has different problems, and they're quite serious. One problem is that Revan himself is written in a manner wholly inconsistent from how the character worked in the actual game Knights of the Old Republic, and inconsistent with how the dark side actually functions as portrayed in the movies and damn near everything else. The dark side is addicting and intoxicating, it controls its users...except Revan, apparently, who is somehow able to use both the light and the dark with no apparent penalties or problems. He's just special and edgy like that.  There's also how the book mutilates the character of Canderous Ordo. Where Canderous in the games played himself off as this proud honorable warrior character, being as he is a Mandalorian mercenary and the future Mandalore, Revan turns him into this horny dull-witted Duke Nukem ripoff.  The worst character assassination of all happened to Bastila Shan, Revan's lover. In KOTOR, she went from being a dedicated Jedi Knight to a Sith apprentice, and was redeemed and led back to the Jedi. Suddenly, in the novel, she and Revan have some extreme beef with the Jedi and refuse to be considered part of the Order, and Bastila herself has turned into a mega-jealous hyper-bitch jumping down the throat of any woman who even glances in the direction of her man.  The only other character from KOTOR who comes back for the novel is T3-M4, who loses all the interesting character traits he had in KOTOR 2 and goes back to being the emotionless trash can he was in KOTOR 1. HK-47 is briefly mentioned, but never appears.  In the novel, we discover that after the Mandalorian Wars, Revan and Malak found the ancient Sith Empire, the same empire once led by Naga Sadow. The remnants of this empire escaped destruction in the Unknown Regions. Revan and Malak faced the Sith Emperor, and he mind-controlled them into going back to attack the Republic as a vanguard force to pre-conquer it, so that when the Sith were ready to strike they would have it all ready for them. All the interesting discussion of Revan's motivations in KOTOR 2? Gone. Now that Revan is starting to remember this, he's going back and hoping to put an end to the Sith Empire once and for all. Since this is the same Sith Empire that is the main enemy in Star Wars: The Old Republic 300 years later, it's not much of a spoiler to tell you that he fails.  The other major characters of the novel are the Jedi Exile -- now named Meetra Surik -- and Lord Scourge, a pureblood Sith of the ancient Empire. KOTOR 2 is so sparingly mentioned that many people who read the novel mistakenly believed most of the game had been retconned away by the novel, especially since it frequently APPEARS to contradict KOTOR 2 (doesn't actually, but you have to examine it hair-splittingly closely to realize that) and feels at some level like Karpyshyn got really jealous of KOTOR 2 and tried to take cheap shots at it.  The Exile is, quite frankly, really boring in the novel, and Scourge spends most of the novel as merely a vehicle for more clumsily-written action scenes. Despite this, Scourge somehow manages to be our most-developed and most interesting character out of our main three (Revan, Meetra, and Scourge), even though his character concept appears to be ""what if Darth Maul was boring?"".  Also, the reason WHY Revan fails to stop the Empire is REALLY REALLY STUPID and makes no sense at all."

StarWarsEU,31k2ik,MrRexTheGreat,6,Sun Apr 5 21:39:16 2015 UTC,"Allegiance by Timothy Zahn has it's main story set a few months after Ep 4, but much of the story follows a small unit of storm troopers.  I thought their back story was in interesting perspective on that period from the infantry ranks.  These are guys that were civilians until 'joining up'.  It also has the benefit of being a Zahn novel and I enjoyed it very much.  I listened to the audio-book and the narration was good too.  Tarkin by James Luceno is a good high-level imperial perspective.  The story spans Tarkin's rise though the ranks as the Republic gives way to the Empire.  It was good, but I would say more informational than action-packed.  A New Dawn by John Jackson Miller provides several different perspectives on this period.  The story takes place 8 years after EP 3 and follows several different characters.  On the Imperial side, there is a low level intelligence employee, and an ambitious young naval officer who's stories do a good job of contrasting how the transition to the Empire affected the 'working man' in the imperial ranks, as well as the new opportunities the transition opened up.  Best of all though is the main 'villain' of the story who is an efficiency expert tasked with transforming the lax industries and organizations of The Republic into the brutally efficient Empire.  I would call this more of a corporate perspective on the transition which I found fascinating.  I enjoyed and recommend all three of these.  The second two (Tarkin and A New Dawn) are both part of the new Cannon which means opportunity for future tie-ins which I like.  A New Dawn is also back story for the animated Rebels series, introducing two of the characters, and takes place six years prior to that series.  The Wookeeepedia Timeline of Media is a great resource for these kinds of questions too.  It now has separate links for Canon and Legends."

The use of the expression ""gray Jedi"" in EU canon actually predates the strict Jedi/Sith taxonomy that came with the prequel trilogies. In the pre-Phantom Menace universe, gray Jedi wasn't just used to contrast renegade Jedi with their more orthodox brethren  but also in relation to ""dark Jedi"" which was, in some materials, used pretty much interchangeably with ""Sith"" (although I think the implication was that all Sith were dark Jedi but not all dark Jedi were Sith)."

StarWarsEU,317rvz,mnky9800n,1 point,Fri Apr 3 03:01:54 2015 UTC,Vader's entire suit and the fact that he is even alive is Source Alchemy and not anything at all like force lightning.  Nor is it obviously evil if you consider that the act of saving Vader's life is inherently a noble act (before you consider Palpy's motivations)  Edit: I should look this up but in retrospect I don't think it was the entire suit but either elements of the suit have Sith alchemy in them OR Palpatine's knowledge of Sith alchemy helped keep Vader alive. This is mentioned somewhere in the EU but I'm not certain where.   Think of Maul's legs as an example of what alchemy can  accomplish. This is an extreme example of what I meant in my original comment about Vader's suit.
StarWarsEU,317rvz,idejmcd,1 point,Wed Apr 8 19:26:02 2015 UTC,That's really lame if it's true. What happened to Vader being more machine than man?

Likely not the entire suit.
StarWarsEU,317rvz,idejmcd,1 point,Wed Apr 8 23:58:46 2015 UTC,I could buy him sustaining his life while they wait to get to the ER. That makes sense given that he was sitting next to hot lava and had his arms and legs cut off. But I really like that he is mostly robot. It makes him all the more sinister in the original series. And it makes Luke's progression more real as well. He looks at his robot hand and realizes he is becoming Vader who is mostly robot. He doesn't want to be that so he throws his lightsaber away and declares victory. That is robbed if all the robot stuff that Vader has is powered by the darkside.
StarWarsEU,317rvz,mnky9800n,1 point,Thu Apr 9 01:19:20 2015 UTC,"The difference is in their philosophical approach, and how they wish to connect with the Force. abilities like lightning and choking people arent just from the dark side, but people who use them  tend to be of that philosophy and tradition. Jedi and Sith define schools and ways of thought, as we as concrete traditions and lineages ( and effective ones too, just look at how many who followed those teachings became masters of the force) but are not denoted by certain powers alone. Thought of in another way, think of rival colleges with different teaching methods. to become a full fledged Harvard or Yale grad, you need to fulfill a certain number of requirements. they may be different subjects, but you can only have a Masters degree from Yale if you go there, learn from those teachers, and subscribe to their program. if Yale were destroyed, you could still research their programs and pick up a rudimentary education from bite and pieces of their surviving texts, but it would be much harder ( Luke's struggle)"

But Yoda in the Clone Wars animated series reminds some of the clones that despite similar faces they each look very different through the Force. So the question remains how much can the layman control the Force without training? Most of the training comes from either the Jedi or the Sith. But enclaves exist like the Night Sisters of Dathomir who learn to bend the Force in their own way and actually have nothing to do with Jedi or Sith. The really interesting characters, imo, are the ones like Aurra Sing who was trained a little as a youngling but then got kidnapped and raised to be a bounty hunter/jedi hunter. What brought me here was the question, ""Is it better to become a Jedi or to remain neutral?"" Balance in the Force is a much more fluid thing than Sith or Jedi/black or white. In season 3 episodes 15-17 of The Clone Wars a god-like family of force wielders known as The Ones. The Son is dark side, Daughter light side, and the father keeps the two in balance. This raises a lot of questions for me. It brings up the philosphy of yin and yang. Balance means if you have the Jedi you must have Sith. There's no winning, only balance maintenance. It brought up a lot of questions for me."

Palpatine was a tyrant at heart, and while he was a native son of Naboo evidence shows he despised his culture and viewed them as weak. Hence why I feel he played right into the hands of Hugo Demask."

StarWarsEU,3113jb,Llujoo,3,Wed Apr 1 07:22:09 2015 UTC,"I found the Corellian Trilogy allright, not one of the best but I read it more than once, which is more than I can say for some books. (Planet of Twilight)  I would really recommend the rest of the Zahn books: Allegiance, and  to a lesser extent Choices of One, and also Outbound Flight and Survivors Quest."
StarWarsEU,3113jb,Hawk-bat,3,Wed Apr 1 08:30:15 2015 UTC,"The Corellian trilogy isn't too bad really, just a bit slow at times since it should probably have only been 2 books for the amount of plot in it.  The Black Fleet Crisis is genuinely quite bad in my opinion, it has a few redeeming qualities, but the only reason I see to read it is if you're a real star wars completionist who wants to read everything."
StarWarsEU,3113jb,zaxa13,2,Wed Apr 1 14:20:57 2015 UTC,"Just to add another voice, I think it's generally agreed that Zahn and Stover are the best authors of the EU so go for stuff they've written (as seen in other comments).    Also, The Black Fleet Crisis was probably the least enjoyable of all the Star Wars books I've read."
StarWarsEU,3113jb,littleTARDIS,2,Fri Apr 17 20:32:23 2015 UTC,Darth Pleagus and the Vader trilogy would be good reads.  It's been so long since I read Corellian Trilogy and Black Fleet that I don't remember if they were good or not.
StarWarsEU,3113jb,xilban,2,Wed Apr 1 09:35:03 2015 UTC,"I would definitely second Outbound Flight (out of username obligation!), since it kind of acts as a prequel to the Thrawn Trilogy/Hand of Thrawn Duology.  I'd also recommend Matthew Stover's entries. You would've read his first SW novel, Traitor, in the New Jedi Order series. His others are really great reads, as well.   Revenge of the Sith Shatterpoint Luke Skywalker and the Shadows of Mindor   And then here are some odds and ends I'd recommend:   Darth Plagueis, James Luceno - For my money, one of the best EU novels outside of Stover's work. Acts as a plothole destroyer for the Prequel Trilogy. Kenobi, John Jackson Miller - Details Obi-Wan's life on Tatooine. Takes Star Wars back to its Western roots. The Medstar Duology (Battle Surgeons and Jedi Healer), Michael Reaves and Steve Perry - Basically a neat combination of Star Wars and MASH. Scoundrels, Timothy Zahn - A heist novel that features Han, Lando, and Chewie. Dark Rendezvous, Sean Stewart - Details Yoda and Dooku's Master/Padawan relationship, in addition to covering the story of a Jedi who can't wield the Force. The Old Republic: Deceived, Paul S. Kemp - Might be a little too far away from what you are looking for (this takes place around 3650 BBY) but I thought it was one of the better novels from this part of the timeline. Covers a time when the Sith were able to take the fight all the way to Coruscant.   Hope that helps!"
StarWarsEU,3113jb,outbound_flight,1 point,Wed Apr 1 11:00:28 2015 UTC,Should i read Decieved and maybe the other Old Republic books before Darth Plagueis or is it unnecessary? And i think Revan would be helpful to read before the Darth Bane trilogie as well?
StarWarsEU,3113jb,xBrucki,1 point,Sun Apr 5 07:13:36 2015 UTC,"I don't think it's necessary to read The Old Republic books before Darth Plagueis, since there's no real significant connection between them. On the timeline, I think they're a few thousand years removed from each other. Same for the Darth Bane Trilogy.  If you want to read them in that order, it's all good, but putting off The Old Republic stuff won't leave you in the dark when you read Darth Plagueis and the Darth Bane Trilogy."
StarWarsEU,3113jb,outbound_flight,2,Sun Apr 5 07:48:43 2015 UTC,"Thanks, thats good to know. But isn't Bane kind of based on Revan's theories or something like that? Anyway i'll read Plagueis for sure."
StarWarsEU,3113jb,xBrucki,1 point,Sun Apr 5 09:37:09 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but the Revan novel doesn't really cover any of that, unfortunately. It's very limited in its scope and mostly action.

StarWarsEU,305i7w,autowikiabot,5,Tue Mar 24 19:39:52 2015 UTC,"I disagree with /u/jettrooper33 based on source materials.  According to their Star Wars the RPG stats, those ships were perfectly serviceable as line ships in the modern era.  Where they seemed to be deficient was   A) Age of the systems.  Old cars run fine if they're well maintained, but they require more and more maintenance the older they get.  B) Weight category.  The dreadnoughts were smaller and less heavily armed than Imperial star destroyers and Mon Calamari star cruisers.  But in a toe to toe between a Dreadnought and Victory class star destroyer, there's no clear victor.  Part of the reason a Dreadnaught heavy cruiser will lose to an Imperial Star Destroyer is that the ships have different mission profiles.  The first was designed as a deterrent (we have a fleet of these so don't mess with us) the second is supposed to be able to single handedly fight a small planetary militia fleet and then subjugate the planet.  Fleet tech in Star Wars is hyperspace capable World War II Naval doctrine in space.  Big ships with big deck guns engage each other in tactical formations and wail on each other until one side or the other is rubble while bombers engage in torpedo runs that don't do that much more damage than the ships guns do and fighters attempt to shoot down the other side's bombers before they can bomb the capital ships and engage one another in the process.  (It's worth noting that this is not REMOTELY realistic space warfare and isn't even realistic naval warfare anymore.)  So, baring weird technological monstrosities like Death Stars, World Devastators and Sun Crushers, when comparing ships from different eras we're just looking at straight up tonnage and firepower plus the little advantages a new tool has over an old and used one.  If I understand things right, by the Alliance era there was a strong reliance on Star Dreadnoughts. . . things that made Super Star Destroyers look small.  These didn't even have bigger guns usually, just MORE of them.  Ignoring tactics, leadership and crew quality, one of these juggernauts is worth an entire Old Republic fleet. . .and probably cost as much to build and maintain.  In a contest, you're still going to just break it down by mass and fire power.   Yes, it can chew up an old fleet, but it's going to take a bunch of damage in the process."

Or does the future gun have a lot more power to it? Do we have any examples in universe where this is more or less stated the weapons designs and armor designs are different?

StarWarsEU,305i7w,thermiteguy,1 point,Tue Mar 24 18:36:14 2015 UTC,"re the turbolaser designs, power outputs, and efficiency more or less the same.   No, they are not. Things like the ""quick recharging"" turbolasors that the Hapans wanted so badly during the NJO, or the ""long range"" turbolasors of the Anakin Solo would absolutely give an overwhelming advantage to the newer ships.   And things like Mon Cal shield redundancies would make even something as ""outdated"" (in the GFFA fleet) as an MC80B, like the Mon Remonda, pretty much impervious to ANYTHING the Old Republic could throw at it. A good example of this would be that the Mon Remonda took the entire frontal battiers of the Iron Fist and didn't have its shields battered down in an extended engagement. A Venator, the very very best the Old Republic ever had, has a tiny fraction of the firepower available (as in, 10 turbolasorss TOTAL versus 4,000 for the Iron Fist).  There is simply no comparison between the two time periods: even one capital ship from the GA, if dropped into the Old Republic, could decimate fleets on it's own."

I'll give you the long range turbo lasers, but were they new or just weren't main stream BC of the massive energy requirements to use them? And yes I know the newer ships have more guns, and the overlapping shield redundancies, I'm asking if you were to take one main line turbolaser and shield generator from each and test it, could they deal a comparable amount of damage, and.

I've always though this really just applied to military advances during the extended peace of the Old Republic.  With no major military threat to the Republic, there was no real need for innovations in military technology, and as a result there wasn't much in the way of advances.  This all changed however with the rise of the Empire, and the Clone Wars where necessity once again becomes the mother of invention, and we once again see advances in military technology.  Ships and weapons of the late Empire and New Republic era would (I expect) outclass their Old Republic and Sith Empire counterparts."

The personal portion of the name would be selected with the clan name in mind, often involving an intentional alteration of the words or a shift in the letters to change the meaning of the name as a whole. This change was meant to symbolize a way of unity. A Twi'lek's name would also be split into multiple parts if they were exiled as a criminal, as this was considered very dishonoring. In some cases, Twi'leks would combine the multiple-part name of a non-Twi'lek into a single name, often changing the pronunciation in the same way that they would alter their own given names and clan names. For example, Twi'leks often pronounced Wedge Antilles's name as Wedgan'tilles so that his name meant Slayer of Stars — if a Twi'lek were to use the Galactic Basic Standard pronunciation, it would mean, in a generous translation, ""one so foul he could induce vomiting in a Rancor.""[20] An example of a true Twi'lek name would be Nawar'aven. This name would be split into two parts when used outside of the local culture, becoming Nawara Ven (the clan name in this case being Ven, but the name Nawara was selected with the intention of moving the last a into the second half of the name, thus changing the meaning). It is worth noting that this naming convention did not appear to be in use during the waning days of the Galactic Republic, when even prominent Twi'lek leaders such as Ro Fenn and Pol Secura preferred using their core names even in private conversation with each other on Ryloth."""

The Koon family name, for example, meant 'explorer'. Kel Dor given names were based, loosely, on the sounds generated by Dorin's unique atmospheric phenomena. This tradition was highly popular among the Kel Dors, and the upper classes considered it bad luck to name a child away from Dorin. Kel Dor names tended to be short, usually monosyllabic, due to an ancient superstition about the ""wind spirits"" of Dorin. Upon hearing the sustained wind-sound of a long name, so the story went, the wind spirits would have mistaken the child for one of their own, and carried him or her off to be raised as a wind-child. No one believed in this myth for thousands of years, but the effect it had on Kel Dor naming conventions remained. The tradition of using the sounds of atmospheric phenomena meant that Kel Dor given names appeared to have almost no meaning to an outsider, but another Kel Dor who had heard the sound in question and could identify the phenomenon would understand the significance and meaning of the name. Likewise, objects and techniques were often named after their purpose or effect. For example, the Baran Do Force technique ayna-seff, which caused brain activity to become undetectable, translated to ""dead brain"" in Galactic Basic Standard."

Lightsabers are known to instantly cauterize the wounds they make due to their intense heat, so the explanation is that there would be enough trapped oxygen in the brain to stay alive for a short time after.  This also explains why people who get limbs chopped off get a robotic replacement. The Sith Simus survived (just his head) such an attack due to this side effect.  A real world example is that several (though unreliable and sensationalized) sources reported that those killed by the guillotine survived long enough to make eye contact, mouth movements and could even non-verbally respond to questions.  These observations were notably made by Dr. Beaurieux during the French Revolution."

This ties into Naboo. Outside of the actual profits from the plasma on Naboo (i mean, the profits are important, he is a Muun, after all), Hego had been looking for a planet from which he and his cabal of shady top strata of society manipulators could use as a base of operations, outside of Sojourn. Furthermore, he wanted another place in which the Trade Federation could be seen as the cause of fermenting chaos in the Inner Rim, which was the goal of that portion of the Grand Plan: to cause strife and chaos in an attempt to coalesce the Republic into a bunch of fractured in fighting between the lawless Outer Rim, the exploited Inner Rim, and the wealthy Core Worlds."

The Darth Bane books are fantastic, and there are two more after the first that you can still read  Disney has stated that the EU will become what's called ""legends"" and that Disney may base some of their work off of previously established EU concepts. In the meanwhile, you can still enjoy all the Expanded Universe has to offer, particularly before the time period where the movies occur, because Disney has not announced any projects in that time frame (as far as I know). The Darth Bane novels occur about 1000 years before the movies, so they will remain relevant for a while.  In the meanwhile, the Darth Bane books are awesome, a crucial time period in the Star Wars timeline, and you still have 2 to go! Enjoy them!!

StarWarsEU,2zds86,Damonstration,1 point,Tue Mar 17 23:56:31 2015 UTC,"That sounds like a good plan.  Obviously they will make Episode VII so that you can go in cold, having only seen the Films.  So that will be a great experience.  Also because of the branding for the books (journey to the force awakens), and the title (aftermath), it sounds like the tie in novels and material will serve you much better as background for the movie.  Rogue Planet and the other PT novels were relatively unrelated to the movies, so this plan should pay off quite well."

At least with Legacy, you still have 60+ hours of story, it ends up equating to 4-5 unabridged novels, so I feel/hope that it still tells a good story.  Plus it'll be awesome to have 60 hours of Thompson shortly followed by another 120 hours in Fate of the Jedi, since somehow, they commissioned every single one unabridged.  Those will take me 4-5 months of work commutes to get through."

StarWarsEU,2zbcod,GSlayerBrian,10,Tue Mar 17 12:48:30 2015 UTC,"This is just my own theorycrafting, but here's why I would venture that the Jedi/Republic would want to preserve Korriban (or at least not destroy it):  The Jedi value knowledge and preservation. Keeping Korriban pristine for the Jedi to study over the eons might have value to them. Jedi of all skill levels could go there for trials. Repelling the dark influences found on Korriban would help Jedi grow. There is always risk of corruption even without a Sith planet out there, so it's not like exposing Jedi to Korriban would be the only dark influence they'd ever encounter.  I would imagine that anything that the Jedi can learn about the The Force, its history, and their enemy's history, methods, and philosophy would be valuable to them. Know your enemy. Destroying Korriban would be eradicating eons of knowledge. Some Jedi might say that the cost of the knowledge is too great. That the risk of corruption is too great. But I say fie on that.  As far as the Republic is concerned, as another comment said, they're not really in the business of eradicating planets, for any reason."
StarWarsEU,2zbcod,Boiscool,7,Tue Mar 17 05:00:03 2015 UTC,"Great points! Part of the reason why Bane's Order of the Sith Lords worked out was because the Jedi stopped learning about the Sith. Only Yoda sorta had knowledge about the Sith, and he's one of the few Jedi to bother visiting the place. Studying Korriban would be valuable, but it would have to remain a tightly guarded secret."

StarWarsEU,2z8haa,HatsandLiquid,8,Mon Mar 16 14:35:23 2015 UTC,If you read Knight Errant which is set about 50-100 years before the Bane novels you get an idea of what some of that time was like.   The Sith Empire breaks into a lot of fiefdoms with a lot of internecine warfare.   The Old Republic solidifies behind existing borders but never really pushes back out to reclaim the territory lost to the Sith during the Emperors attacks.   From there I would imagine that eventually Kaan consolidates the Sith territory and re-ignites the overall war again.
StarWarsEU,2z8haa,qwartx,3,Mon Mar 16 16:53:32 2015 UTC,The new Sith war in the Bane books was the result of the Forth Great Schism which occured around 2000 years before the battle of Yavin.  There isn't really much written about this period and most of what is written comes from chronology books and source books.
StarWarsEU,2z8haa,zaxa13,3,Mon Mar 16 15:57:41 2015 UTC,There were lots of smaller engagements with one off Sith Lords but never a large scale conflict until a few centuries before Bane.

The galaxy falls into a dark age and is filled with wars between pirates/sith/warlords in the rim areas.
StarWarsEU,2z8haa,roninjedi,2,Wed Mar 18 03:56:18 2015 UTC,"Republic Dark Age (from Starwars wikia):       The Republic Dark Age was the term given to the last century of the New Sith Wars, from around 1100 BBY to the Ruusan Reformation of 1000 BBY. During the Dark Age, the Republic, in the eyes of later centuries, had essentially ceased to exist. Since the start of the Draggulch Period in 2000 BBY, the Republic had been in decline. During the series of conflicts known as the New Sith Wars, thousands of worlds were abandoned to the New Sith Empire, while more were abandoned during the Republic's retreat. Thousands of longstanding corporations went bankrupt; lawlessness spread as the Republic government became increasingly overburdened and ineffectual; and numerous mines of valuable minerals dried up. The collapse escalated following the Sith victory at the Battle of Mizra in 1466 BBY.  However, all these events were merely a prelude to the Dark Age. The Senate granted almost all of its authority to the Supreme Chancellor, many of whom were Jedi at that point, such as Jedi Master Genarra. Throughout the galaxy Jedi joined in bands to defend individual worlds, and even regions of space, from Sith, pirates, slavers and warlords. In some regions, the Jedi supported existing governments, though in others, Jedi became rulers themselves in order to protect the population from external threats. The more troubled regions of the galaxy were divided by the Supreme Chancellors into Jedi baronial sectors, in an attempt to coordinate the continuing war against the Sith. Although the unity of the Sith seems to have been broken by infighting, and the ongoing conflict was officially portrayed as merely a series of clashes against an illegal organization, the situation wore down the Republic Navy and Army, which likewise fell under increasing Jedi control.

They introduced characters in video games, they introduced characters in comic books, and then had the video game characters influence the comic book characters in a separate novel.  I understand why people say that it's not consistent, but especially compared to Marvel or DC comics, which have been rebooted no less than 17 times in the past week and where Wolverine, Superman, Spider-Man, and Batman have ""officially died"" a total of 372 times, Star Wars's EU was consistent."

StarWarsEU,2z7nj2,anothergaijin,0,Mon Mar 16 14:14:01 2015 UTC,"The key fact is that the Star Wars EU was great despite George Lucas, not because of him. Continuity and strong canon were what made it special and the #1 person who threatened that was always Lucas (all sorts of broken canon in the prequels, meddling in later EU character deaths, etc; Karen Traviss comes in a distant second).  Lucas then sold to Disney without any stipulations regarding keeping the existing EU alive, and anyone with an understanding of Hollywood economics could probably have assumed that the existing EU canon was DOA the day that happened (just look at the Marvel movies).   I can't even fault Disney, with the price that they paid for Star Wars of course they wouldn't want to be shackled to an extensive EU that would complicate the billions of dollars of media they will need to produce in the coming years necessary to justify and profit from the expense. The fact that Disney has at least recognized existing EU under the ""Legends"" brand is frankly better than I would have hoped.  TL;DR Disney isn't the Empire, but Lucas is Jabba (an arrogant and uncaring but incredibly rich being whose early amazing successes blinded him to the fact that he was more lucky than talented and that no one around him really likes him). Of course Lucas gets to chill out as a billionare instead of getting strangled by Carrie Fisher, so that's kinda different...."

StarWarsEU,2yzpz9,Blitz7x,11,Sun Apr 19 04:37:29 2015 UTC,"To echo some of the other sentiments here-- The Wraith Squadron books (Wraith Squadron, Iron Fist, and Soli Command) do a great job of running the emotional gambit. The characters are all funny and likable and human, so they're easy to grow attached to. You want them to succeed, and when they fail, it hurts. When they break down, you understand why. And when they die-- it's like a kick in the gut. They weren't just background names; these were your dang friends they killed.   Additionally, Statfighter's of Adumar will only make you cry tears of laughter, not tears of emotion, but it's still a great read that gives you closure on some of your favorite characters.   Traitor is also amazing-- it goes through something of an existential crisis for Jacen Soli during the Yuzhan Vong war. Just fair warning-- it's set in the middle of that series, and it makes no apologies for such. Don't know the names of the planets? Don't know what a Yuzhan Vong is? Don't know the basics of Luke's Jedi philosophies, or who Ganner Rhysode is? Too bad, cuz this book ain't explaining crap to you. You've got to read at least the bare bones minimum of the rest of the NJO books up to that point in order for the novel to impact you emotionally. But it really, really manages to. It's about 75% just Jacen and Vergere chatting about what constitutes good and evil in the Star Wars universe, as well as what constitutes the light side and the dark side, and the ideas of the Jedi and the Sith being wrong about everything. The end result is great and highly rereadable.   Speaking of good books like that-- I know that it isn't EU, but the novelization of Revenge of the Sith is leaps and bounds better than the film for characterizing Anakin's fall to the dark side. I found it emotional when I read it, but I was also 14 at the time, so take it with a grain of salt. I think it probably held up, though."

Honestly, the first few Fate of The Jedi books were pretty emotional IMO because I fully understood Daalas point of view concerning the Jedis lack of culpability. It really struck a chord because I was reading marvel civil war at the same time. Unfortunately instead of resolving that. They just made daala go power crazy and reverted all of her fairly well considered rulings along with her bad ones."

I hope they keep the same style of story for Rogue One and while I know the names and events will be different, it would be nice to feel like it's just an extension of the X-Wing stories.

StarWarsEU,2yz4c8,ProffessorJ,3,Sat Mar 14 04:11:26 2015 UTC,"It depends on what you're feeling like reading. A lot of people aren't liking Heir to the Jedi, but I think they were expecting a huge game-changing novel that connected dots and revealed all sorts of things like the other novels, so I'll break them down differently:  -A NEW DAWN: An informative story about Kanan and Hera that introduces versions of them both that are (especially in Kanan's case) very different from the duo we know in Rebels. It reveals the nature of the galaxy between trilogies and has far-reaching implications in terms of where various characters are coming from and how the Empire is operating in this era.  -HEIR TO THE JEDI: An personal, more intimate story that serves as a character study of Luke's shifting personality. The Luke we meet in ANH is very different to the Luke we see in RotJ, and this is the beginning of the shift in his personality from whiny farmboy to sagely Kenobi figure who learns to keep his cool.   Both are fairly revelatory... A New Dawn in terms of events impacting the saga at large, and Heir to the Jedi in terms of Luke's understanding of who he is and what he wants to be. I love both for different reasons.  As far as what to read next, I'd say go ahead and read A New Dawn. It takes place next chronologically, and was published before Heir to the Jedi. Also, A New Dawn works as a good bridge between the styles of Tarkin and Heir to the Jedi, being both epic in scale and personal, whereas Heir to the Jedi is very low-key, which (at least for me) works in its favor given what it sought out to do."

StarWarsEU,2ywp4n,SenseiZarn,3,Sun Mar 15 00:52:41 2015 UTC,"You realize, of course, that the ""True Sith Empire"" of the Old Republic era has basically nothing to do with the Sith of Darth Bane's era?    The Brotherhood of Darkness maintained the name Sith, but that's the only thing I can think of that they had in common with the Sith Empire.  They were separated by millenia, they held different ideals, had a different power structure, etc."
StarWarsEU,2ywp4n,Vratix,2,Fri Mar 13 15:08:58 2015 UTC,"I agree, at least partially, that the Sith Empire of the Old Republic era didn't have much in common with the Sith of Darth Bane's era, apart from the name and some trappings. However, I still think that the holorecordings of master Gnost Dural is some of the more fun background given. Lance Henriksen has a magnificent, gravelly voice.  Though you're quite right that the Brotherhood of Darkness maintained the name Sith - and their creed, to some extent - I do disagree that they have basically nothing to do with the True Sith Empire. I still feel they're related in spirit, though perhaps not in direct lineage.  The fourth schism in 2 000 BBY gave rise to the New Sith Empire, whereas the second great schism in 7 000 BBY gave rise to the True Sith Empire. After about a thousand years, the New Sith Empire was then reformed into the Brotherhood of Darkness by Skere Kaan. The third schism and the Vultar Cataclysm is incidental in this case. Or so it was, at least. Nowadays, it's all Legends canon at any rate.  Still, the New Sith Empire that became the Brotherhood of Darkness likely felt they were the heirs of the Sith Empire of The Old Republic, given that they took the name. And therefore, the Brotherhood of Darkness that arose in part inherited the history, and the deep seated conflict between the Galactic Republic and the Sith Empire, whichever Sith empire it was at the time. Or that's my opinion anyways.  At any rate, I think it's a bit of fun Legends lore that could shed some light on the greater conflict, and the tendency of the cycle to repeat itself, to some extent."
StarWarsEU,2ywp4n,SenseiZarn,1 point,Fri Mar 13 18:50:22 2015 UTC,"Agreed, although I will note that the Third Great Schism was actually a result of Sith influence, so perhaps more relevant than what you might think. It can be assumed that Vitiate's reformed Sith Empire was behind it, although I grant that there were other Sith remnants that could have instigated it (e.g. the Sith Lords secreted within the Tapani sector during this period)."
StarWarsEU,2ywp4n,KOTORman,1 point,Fri Mar 13 22:04:42 2015 UTC,"One musn't forget that Darth Ruin united surviving Sith clans to build his Sith Empire. With Darth Phobos running around ""many years"" before 2,000 BBY, and Darth Phobos' activities over a century after TOR, one can only assume that the True Sith Empire fractured and declined over the course of several centuries, leaving remnants for Ruin and his fifty Jedi renunciates to unify.  So the Brotherhood (and other factions of the Draggulch Period) and the True Sith are about as connected to each other as the various incarnations during the Old Sith Wars period."

However, these post-Cleansing lightfoils were weaker than the authentic or ""archaic"" lightfoils due to the poor quality focusing crystals used in their manufacture and the relatively low level of craftsmanship compared to Jedi artisans. However, the knockoff lightfoils apparently did not require any connection to the Force to create, and were fully usable by non-Force sensitives.

Both were centrally based around a videogame, had novel and audio book tie in (although I do admit Shadows also had a soundtrack and a little more panache).  It binds main characters to more things that have happened outside the movies, which is ultimately the business decision here. They want a clean slate with the new movies to make on-boarding new fans as easy as possible and to sell new content.  That said, they can also learn from, if not the mistakes, but the missteps of the EU prior to the Great Lengend-ization.

I do like that it was handled in a matter of fact way but when it's so subtle that readers might miss it, it's like they're scared of making it obvious, almost as if having a blatantly gay character is a bad thing.  And when I say blatant I don't mean a flaming queen or whatever, just an otherwise 'normal' character who happens to have relationships with characters of the same sex.  Whenever these issues pop up people always say stuff like ""as long as it's not shoved in our faces"" and ""don't make a big deal about it"" but they usually mean they want to continue pretending it doesn't exist, like the gay Mando couple.  I think it's great that they're gay but it shouldn't be so subtle that you can read it without realising they're a couple.  I wish they'd just treat gay characters like any other, their sexuality shouldn't define them, but it also shouldn't be hidden.  Sorry for ranting to you directly, your comment just triggered something that's bothered me for awhile about gay characters in Star Wars."

StarWarsEU,2yplkn,AnusHoldus,-4,Thu Mar 12 01:09:37 2015 UTC,"I understand, however my point is that if it's that subtle that some readers would miss it entirely, it's a little disappointing.   I mean, have any of the heterosexual relationships been depicted in such an easy-to-miss way?  I'm not saying they shouldn't have done anything but like I said, it bothers me that even up until a few years ago we still had to be a little coy about whether someone was gay in the Star Wars universe."
StarWarsEU,2yplkn,tunnel-snakes-rule,7,Thu Mar 12 01:41:45 2015 UTC,"I'm going to guess yes, but I'm not sure because I probably missed them. On the whole, due to the target audience, there isn't a whole lot of sexual content in Star Wars, and as such, the sexuality of the characters isn't particularly relevant, in almost all cases. Shoehorning in obviously gay characters just for the sake of having a gay character to point to so they can say how progressive they are would actually bother me a lot more than having none at all. Similarly, oversexualising Star Wars, whether straight or gay or alien or whatever, would also feel pretty weird. Basically, I don't want their focus to be on ""making things diverse,"" I want it to be on making a good story that fits the universe. Some of the people in that story will probably be gay, others will probably not be. And unless it's really relevant to the story, I don't particularly need to know which is which, just like I probably don't need to know about their religious affiliation or whatever other unrelated private details of their life they may have."
StarWarsEU,2yplkn,fearsomeduckins,1 point,Thu Mar 12 06:46:26 2015 UTC,"Sure, I get that. And to be clear I'm not talking about sexualising Star Wars in any way, I agree that there's no need for sexual content in Star Wars.  But there's a big difference between sexual content and acknowledging a non-heterosexual relationship. At no point did I suggest we should oversexualise Star Wars.  For example, looking at any the existing relationships, Luke and Mara, Corran and Mirax, Han and Leia, Wedge and Iella, Jag and Jaina... if you took any of those relationships and make it same sex, but treat it the same as it was originally.  Not making a big deal about it, not pointing at it and saying how great everyone in Star Wars is for being open to it, just let it exist in an open way.  I mean romance has always been a part of Star Wars and no one bats an eye when there's a straight couple, but these conversations always seem to crop up where people say there needs to be a reason if there's a gay character.  No one ever needs to justify a straight relationship in a story.  When you say ""shoehorning in an obviously gay character"", does that mean if Wedge calls up all his Rogues for a mission, Corran is out on a date with Mirax, Tycho is out with Winter and another Rogue happens to be out with a member of the same sex, would that be shoehorning?    And I'm not having a go, I'm genuinely curious.  Because if that is shoehorning then I don't know how they could include a gay character at all without it seemingly like they're making a point.  Something I always go back to is the TV series Caprica.  There are gay characters in that, one of the main character's brother is married to another man.  At no point do they make a big deal about it.  They just treat it exactly like a straight relatioship, and I think that's fantastic."
StarWarsEU,2yplkn,tunnel-snakes-rule,2,Thu Mar 12 09:12:23 2015 UTC,"No, I wouldn't call that shoehorning. Well, I suppose they could do it in a shoehorn-y way, like going really far out of their way to point at that these two characters who aren't really part of the scene are also there and are dating each other and are the same sex, but assuming that isn't the case, then no. It's kind of... the important thing in the relationship, for the audience, is not the sexual aspect. It's everything else; how the characters understand each other and support each other, an so on. That should be the focus, for straight or gay relationships. And for the relationships we've seen so far, it usually is. There's very little even implied sex in any Star Wars books, comics, movies, etc that I'm familiar with. But if you write a gay relationship like that, some people are probably going to assume they're just bros. I think that's fine, I don't really care about their sex lives, but it's the sort of ""some people don't even realize"" that you're talking about. So if they try to get around that by going out of their way to make it very clear to the audience that these two characters are having sex, then I think it becomes shoehorning. If we see them dating, or we know they're living together, or something like this, that's different, because that's all stuff that's public. That's not to say that there's no room for more private stuff, but it needs to be there for a reason beyond just letting the audience know that these characters have sex."

StarWarsEU,2yplkn,Konlir,8,Thu Mar 12 00:21:08 2015 UTC,"But isn't this the wrong way to introduce something to a society?

We have straight couples by the bucket in the Star Wars universe, and as a queer woman I'm super glad about this. Straight people are normal and a dime a dozen in the Star Wars universe, but so far, LGBT people are not, so don't act like announcing a straight character would equivalent. that's just ignorant.

There has to be at least some reason why after twenty years most worlds in the Empire didn't just rebel, even under threat of military retribution.  They had to be doing some good somewhere. They're also going to have some Imperial protagonists in the new trilogy, and most people would think they were either stupid or doing some crazy mental gymnastics to work for the space Nazis."

I thought it was really interesting to show the Empire from that point of view. That they were fine with a little oppression in return for order and stability, but they had a line that was crossed. I think thats why not all worlds rebelled with the dictatorship. They weren't ""evil"" to everyone, and not everyone has that same line. Dictatorships aren't inherently evil, just the power they have lures them into evil. Look at Palleon's Empire. It was still basically a dictatorship(military to boot) as far as I can tell, but it was more meritocracy than anything."

That's weird, and something that bothered me a lot about the old EU.  2) It makes young (and old!) readers of Star Wars who belong to the LGBT community feel like they belong (or at least like they're not actively being excluded). You don't NEED straight relationships, but they're there in Star Wars, and in such abundance they make the lack of LGBT relationships really obvious,. If you're gonna have straight relationships, you need LGBT relationships too, in a world this big. Representation matters in media mostly because the vast majority of stories being told in the movies are about straight, white, male people. You could say that this is the SW universe, so the social factors that matter in the real world don't matter there, but that's wrong because the readers and writers and consumers of this media live in the real world; real writers are the ones making the choice about what people to include, and real readers are the ones who empathize with these characters. When writers choose (either deliberately or through carelessness or ignorance) to only include a very small subset of the population, it excludes and alienates readers who don't belong to that subset. It says, ""this world is made up of these people, who don't look or act like you, and therefore it's not for you, and people like you can't have these kinds of stories told about you."" I know that as a queer woman, I would've treasured a story featuring a women who likes other women set in the Star Wars universe as a teenager. Heck, I'm super psyched about it now! I would have felt like I belonged. When writers include exclusively straight romances (as in the old EU with ONE VERY SMALL EXCEPTION) in this wide universe, it's sending a pretty clear message.  3) It's good for the story. Science fiction isn't just about space battles; it's about putting our world in a new light, seeing what's possible when you put issues from the real world in a different society. Star Trek is great at this (though they do go into hamfisted territory at times); Star Wars has not been. Star Wars is almost pure space opera (or space fantasy, even) with disappointingly little attention paid to the things that make science fiction interesting (like differently structured societies, like truly foreign aliens - and on a side note, I really enjoy some of the weird early EU novels because they try weird and different things, like Lando getting to know some invisible space manta rays who poop gemstones).  4) And this is news because is a (huge) first for Star Wars, and a really great start for the new EU if it wants to rectify any of the problems with the old EU."
StarWarsEU,2yplkn,BlueSmoke95,1 point,Wed Mar 11 21:22:53 2015 UTC,"Not a first for SW, apparently.   Also there are tons of different structured societies and weird aliens in SWEU. Compare the old Star Trek rubber forehead aliens and pseudo-Shakespearean social customs."
StarWarsEU,2yplkn,tunnel-snakes-rule,6,Thu Mar 12 02:23:38 2015 UTC,"I don't care if there is a gay character, so long as it advances the story.  If it does nothing for the story, why bother mentioning it at all?"
StarWarsEU,2yplkn,BlueSmoke95,1 point,Fri Mar 20 16:28:52 2015 UTC,"Why does it need to advance the story?  What if I said ""I don't care if there's a straight character as long as it advances the story""?  It just expands upon the universe by having gay characters.  They don't need to make a big deal about it, it doesn't need to define the character, in fact it should be treated exactly like a straight character... but it does help show that they at least exist and trust me, that means a lot to the young LGBT Star Wars fans."
StarWarsEU,2yplkn,tunnel-snakes-rule,5,Wed Mar 11 20:49:33 2015 UTC,"I said, if it doesn't advance the story, don't mention it.  If having an explicitly straight character doesn't advance the story, don't mention it.   For all it matters, Thrawn, Sidious, Dooku, or Lando could have been gay."
StarWarsEU,2yplkn,BlueSmoke95,3,Wed Mar 11 22:21:58 2015 UTC,"Yes, and I said that there's more to it than just advancing the story. Whether you're mentioning a character's taste in food or interest in podracing, it's all part of building the character and the world.  Not to mention the effect it has on the reader simply knowing that gay characters exist.  But yeah I guess you could just go ahead and downvote me instead because you disagree."
StarWarsEU,2yplkn,darthideous,2,Wed Mar 11 22:39:59 2015 UTC,"Did not downvote you, but building characters and world is part of the story.   Simply saying a character is gay, and never elaborating on it is pointless.  Just as saying Lando is a gambler, but never referencing that again."
StarWarsEU,2yplkn,BlueSmoke95,3,Wed Mar 11 23:33:21 2015 UTC,"I apologise, I assumed it was you.  Clearly this is an issue many people are still uncomfortable with, which is a shame.  I see what you mean, and if it's a case of the character is introduced in such a way like ""She had blonde hair, a steely gaze and bonked women"" I agree.    But if it's a case where she goes home and talks to her wife about her day, I think that's the best possible scenario.  Treat her like any other married character, don't make a big deal about it."

StarWarsEU,2yplkn,thekenzo,-2,Thu Mar 12 00:02:50 2015 UTC,"Because it's a first, and for those of us who 1) love Star Wars and 2) want it to be slightly more realistic (in that this is an entire GALAXY where in the old EU we had ONE gay couple ever even mentioned) and 3) belong to the LGBT community, this is actually exciting.  Edit: This whole 'as long as it's related to the story' thing bothers me. Does Han and Leia's romance really advance the story, aside from the story of their romance? Not really. It fleshes out some characters and gives Han an opportunity to show his character development, yeah, but it's not related to the plot in a major way. And there are dozens of straight relationships in the old EU that are unrelated to any plot. Are you saying we can only have LGBT relationships if they're strictly plot-related but we can have straight relationships no matter what? Or should we ban all relationships ever? Ooh, we should ban every moment that doesn't explicitly advance the plot. Only shooting and space battles allowed. No character development moments! No pretty scenes of scenery! Only the mechanical sequence of actions following actions!"
StarWarsEU,2yplkn,wfree,3,Thu Mar 12 00:08:06 2015 UTC,"You clearly do not understand literature.  Character development, dialogue, settings; these all advance the story.   Saying a character is gay, then dropping it, never to be mentioned again, is pointless.  However, establishing a gay character, and using that to expand upon the character's background and motivation advances the story."
StarWarsEU,2yplkn,flameofmiztli,0,Thu Mar 12 02:36:19 2015 UTC,"I was taking your point to its extreme, because it seemed at the time that you were implying that LGBT representation is only permissible if it's directly plot-related.

A subject like this will always get a mention though because issues like this will still be seen as newsworthy or 'hot topics' unfortunately when in reality they shouldn't really matter. I don't know if anything has been released about said character but lets hope its a good character in it's own right and not one that is defined by lifestyle choices."

You might laugh, but what are the chances that there aren't Luke Skywalker action figures? I mean, we have them, and here he's just a character from a movie. In universe, he's galactic hero #1. Entirely apart from any government funding he might receive, that's enough to make him excessively wealthy. Then on top of that, you've probably got all kinds of wealthy people who remember the Jedi fondly and are willing to donate to get them going again. Also, Luke has a lot of influence, as a hero, a celebrity, and a close friend of the highest galactic political elites. Tons of people are going to be trying to buy his friendship with gifts (I don't think he would take bribes, but if someone leaves a new spaceship on your landing pad, what are you gonna do with it?). Not to mention, Luke has done a whole hell of a lot towards freeing various entire planets, which will no doubt be grateful and very willing to support him financially. Put all that on a galactic scale, and it would be much more surprising if they didn't have money."
StarWarsEU,2yozub,fearsomeduckins,1 point,Thu Mar 12 01:35:40 2015 UTC,"Concerning in-universe Luke Skywalker action figures: Maybe, but then again how many real-life heroes in our world have action figures (that sell well, anyway)?

At least, not in this sense. If you do something like land a troubled plane safely or jump on a grenade, we call you a hero, but Luke Skywalker is on an entirely different scale. He's literally saved entire planets. Plural. Not to mention that he has literal superpowers. He's a perfect storybook hero (because he's from a story, but we're assuming it's real life here). That's the kind of person who would get action figures. If captain sullenberger blew up deathstars and moved things with his mind, I daresay he'd get action figures too."
StarWarsEU,2yozub,fearsomeduckins,2,Fri Mar 13 07:34:27 2015 UTC,"I suppose. Really, I found it hard to even think of a hero that the majority of people would agree on. Most war heroes these days, I think, are disregarded by many who don't agree with the war as a whole. Most of the ""heroes"" that people worship are sports players or other celebrities (and some of them do have action figures, come to think of it).  And then you can say ""well he's a real life superhero"" but maybe that's not such a special thing in-universe for everyone. I'm thinking of how, in the Watchmen universe, it got to the point that no one wanted superhero comics because they had them in real life...and they weren't so ""super."" Not everyone loved the jedi, as seen in Fate of the Jedi and elsewhere (this is all assuming we are in Legends EU canon).  Which brings me to the funny thought of some Star Wars villain busting up a Luke Skywalker action figure to take out his/her frustrations (actually kind of happened in Spaceballs)."
StarWarsEU,2yozub,jwasko,1 point,Fri Mar 13 15:32:53 2015 UTC,"Yea, actually I was thinking of like how the Rock has action figures, and figured Luke probably would too, since he's so famous. But ultimately I don't really have any evidence for the existence of in-universe Luke action figures beyond simple probability. In a galaxy the size of the GFFA, they're almost guaranteed to be out there somewhere. Even if 90% of the galaxy hated Jedi, there are still enough beings left in that 10% to make Luke super wealthy. Of course, there's also an even chance that they're all unlicensed and Luke doesn't see a credit from the sales. We'll probably never know for sure.

They each at some point or another, if not the entire span of the EU (i'm still working my way through it) have official positions and titles, and presumably salaries.  Given their important and highly visible positions, it makes sense that they have pretty hefty salaries.  Leia may well could have an inheritance from Bail Organa, depending on the economic fallout and transition from old republic to empire, at the very least it wouldn't have been some Alderaan only currency that was wiped out with the planet.

Besides that, I believe Luke, Leia, and Han all draw pensions from being generals and head's of state, and could make millions from advertising for Corellian ships and X-wing products. In the Dark Nest crisis, Han did some sort of agreement to for him and Luke to sign a percentage of models of their iconic starships that the Killiks were producing.   And besides, Han could always start a casino. He's won planets in high stakes games, and his star appeal could make any venture profitable."

I assume if he fixes it he will lose it sometime before Empire Strikes Back.  Or maybe he'll use it as a template for his green saber.  At any rate I think it's very cool.  Also this book sees the canonization of Interdictor cruises.  I always liked those ships and I'm glad to see them brought back.  Finally, as a huge Biggs fan, I appreciated the time Luke spent reflecting on the death of his good friend.  Not only Biggs but Kenobi, his aunt, and his uncle.

The books tell the story of Luke Skywalker's attempt to resurrect the Jedi Order on Yavin 4, and his search for possible Jedi candidates. There are several stories told throughout the three books. The main plot is that of Exar Kun's spirit attempting to turn Luke's trainee Jedi, he kills one of them and turns Kyp Durron who goes on a rampage with the Sun Crusher. The Jedi trainees eventually destroy Kun and Kyp is brought back to the light by his friend Han Solo.

Sounds like they're including comic books (possibly each issue counting as an individual ""book""), several YA novels (possibly in the same vein as the recent novels based on Zare Leonis), and one confirmed adult novel (Aftermath). Assuming there are more beyond this, there will likely be a couple more adult novels in this mix (possibly some of the ""alternate viewpoint"" retellings, akin to how Darth Plagueis somewhat retold Episode I from a different view point). I am excited for a new batch of novels though. All the new canon novels released to this point have been at least passable (IMO: New Dawn>Tarkin>>>Heir to the Jedi)"

StarWarsEU,2yj2hv,BeesInABar,1 point,Fri Mar 13 11:15:44 2015 UTC,Actually that might explain why I didn't like them very much. I had read about half of them years before and then listened to the whole series. It felt rushed and the characters actions didn't always seem explained well... They were much better than earlier books.
StarWarsEU,2yj2hv,Morlaak,2,Tue Mar 10 16:21:53 2015 UTC,"I listen to audiobooks while I work a lot, and I did one of the star wars audiobooks (Scoundrels. Really good audiobook, btw. I do recommend it, the voices are pretty spot on) that I got for free (thanks, audible, haha!). I figured I'd try some of the others, since I was rereading some books anyways, and picked up an abridged version from the library. It was... not great. I don't remember for sure which one specifically I tried, but I know it was one of the NJO books. There was a lot cut out. Like, I hadn't read the book in a while, so it's not like I knew it inside and out, but I could tell when stuff was missing, a lot of times it was really jarring. Because it's not abridged were like, they summarize some sections. There was just stuff straight up missing. Mostly it went unnoticed and the pacing was just weird, but there was one time they referred to something, that just straight up didn't happen in the audiobook. I think the abridged versions would be okay if you're just trying to refresh yourself on what happened if you have read the book but don't quite remember. I don't think I'd recommend them if you haven't read them before though. Although, I'm a bit more of an avid reader than the average person, and so I really care about what's cut out and stuff even if it takes way longer to get through a book. IDK, maybe it'll be more tolerable to you?  as far as how bad the cuts are though, the best thing I think I can say is, scoundrels is about 500 pages, and the audiobook is 14hrs. The closest NJO book I can find in page count is 'the unifying force', at 450 pages. It's audiobook is only  6hrs. So, that means there's about half the book missing.... pretty big chunk."
StarWarsEU,2yj2hv,cg91,1 point,Tue Mar 10 07:11:44 2015 UTC,"Scoundrels is definitely on my list so thanks for the recommendation :), but yeah I'm someone who's entire Star Wars EU experience is through the audiobooks as like you said it's just easy to listen to them while working so I haven't read any   That being said is the example that you gave about things being taken out then mentioned leaving the reader confused the norm ? Or can you follow the stories through each book easily enough  Although like half the book is pretty horrible :/ is that the case for a lot of them ?"
StarWarsEU,2yj2hv,perfectworldly,1 point,Tue Mar 10 07:27:56 2015 UTC,"I can't say if being confused by cut stuff is the norm, as I only tried one abridged book.

StarWarsEU,2yj2hv,qwartx,2,Tue Mar 10 18:01:04 2015 UTC,"I listened to Outbound Flight, which I haven't read, and it was very clear that there were chunks of the story missing. There was one storyline that was just entirely abandoned. Super jarring."
StarWarsEU,2yj2hv,qwartx,2,Tue Mar 10 12:32:18 2015 UTC,haha same and listening to it i started to notice things near the end but for me as a whole i think it was a decent listen :P
StarWarsEU,2yj2hv,the_gv3,2,Fri Mar 13 11:10:02 2015 UTC,"9 out of 10 times, I'd recommend unabridged audio books.   Sure, they're usually really long, but it goes by faster because you get much more inmersion.

StarWarsEU,2yj2hv,the_gv3,1 point,Tue Mar 10 17:26:09 2015 UTC,"Oh I agree without that unabridged are better but if I'm to listen to all the audiobooks in order, I'm going to run into a lot of abridged   And in your opinion do they take too much out to enjoy or are they worth a listen"
StarWarsEU,2yi2lg,dyltrocity,5,Mon Mar 9 23:59:13 2015 UTC,"No list is complete without Matt Stover and James Luceno; their works are consistently thought of as the very best in the EU. Abel Pena strikes me as the easiest to get in touch with, as he often interacts with fans online (Halagad_Ventor on the JCF, can ask him for you if you want), and, like Luceno, he's a continuity god.  I'd also suggest you interview Tom Veitch, the mind behind Dark Empire and Tales of the Jedi. The former, along with the Thrawn trilogy, was a pioneering effort that was responsible for the renewed surge of interest in Star Wars, and not only served as a foundation for the EU of today, but remains a very popular and also controversial work. And without TOTJ, you'd have no KOTOR, and so on.  I'd suggest the early-mid 90s birth of the modern EU thanks to the quintessential ROTJ sequel in the Thrawn trilogy and Dark Empire be a segment, as well.  Good luck with it!"
StarWarsEU,2yi2lg,KOTORman,5,Tue Mar 10 10:22:12 2015 UTC,"I would suggest for segments you may wish to look at the different eras:   Prior to 91 (heir to the Empire) Bantam Era (Heir to the Empire through to Starfighters of Adumar) Del Rey, specifically New Jedi Order and Prequels Del Rey, Post NJO Legends (The Dark Times!!!)   I myself always wanted to know more about these history periods but since I was only active during Bantam and Post NJO periods and it's hard to find out the behind the scenes after the fact."

Obviously this is going to be very subjective, but I'd probably cast my vote for Revenge of the Sith by Matthew Stover. The fall of Darth Vader was the story that everyone went to the theaters to see, but I feel like Stover was the one who was really able to translate that story into the tragedy it was meant to be.  It also didn't hurt that Stover did his research, and was also able to tie it all back into the Expanded Universe. Just a truly epic story that felt like a proper ""end"" to the saga.  My runner-ups would probably be Darth Plagueis, the Thrawn Trilogy, and Shatterpoint."

StarWarsEU,2ydlxg,the_gv3,6,Mon Mar 9 20:32:03 2015 UTC,"The RotS novel was pretty good, but it would also have been inaccessible to many more casual fans or fans who haven't delved into some of the breadth of the EU. I only knew what he was talking about when mentioning lightsaber forms because I played the d20 rpg.   That said, I think Stover got RotS in every way that the movie missed, especially the ending where, without giving too much away, you're in Vader's head was one of the best scenes I'd ever read."
StarWarsEU,2ydlxg,gameld,3,Mon Mar 9 09:20:59 2015 UTC,"I don't know I'd place it as the best (just because I have no idea what I would consider the best), but the RotS novelization is very very good.  It is basically everything we wanted from the prequels condensed in a single novel.  It also feels like its just a novel and not a novelization, if that makes sense."
StarWarsEU,2ydlxg,Ginkasa,2,Mon Mar 9 09:22:38 2015 UTC,"This book was available about a week before the movie came out.  I made the mistake of reading it immediately, before I saw the movie."

Part of the beauty of that series is that it fluctuates in quality, making the best stuff really shine.  I actually came into the series at the Edge of Victory duology and was fine, they gave enough to know what was going on and I went from there. I built up well and learned what I was getting into and by Traitor I was ready for what I got, and it leveled me. Such an amazing book."

I guess X-Wing: Rogue Squadron."

StarWarsEU,2ydlxg,IDontWASHMYFeet,4,Sun Mar 8 23:58:14 2015 UTC,"Ooh, so many to choose from! I hope you're not using answers as an arbiter for which you should read first, as some of these, being part of a series, require extensive prior reading, such as my (joint) second favourite, Traitor.  My favourite would have to be Darth Plagueis. Works as a standalone, yet bulging with references to the EU and stitching together previously disconnected lore and history, serving as not only the ultimate prequel to, well, the prequels, but also pioneering exploration of Palpatine's backstory and the exploits of his Master, as well as being excellently written and full of compelling dialogue.  After Plagueis, the excellent Shatterpoint and Yoda: Dark Rendezvous definitely contend with Traitor for second place; I wouldn't be able to choose between them. The Revenge of the Sith novelisation would be fifth, simply for Stover's typically fantastic prose rather than any abundance of new story content, and I've very much enjoyed Luke Skywalker and the Shadows of Mindor and the very recently released and reference-intensive novella SkyeWalkers as well."
StarWarsEU,2ydlxg,KOTORman,2,Mon Mar 9 02:00:47 2015 UTC,I'd forgotten about how much I enjoyed Dark Rendezvous
StarWarsEU,2ydlxg,AevnNoram,4,Mon Mar 9 04:13:58 2015 UTC,Id go for Plagueis every time. My runners up would be the bane trilogy and the thrawn trilogy.
StarWarsEU,2ydlxg,Snotaap,2,Mon Mar 9 08:45:18 2015 UTC,This would be my exact answer as well. They're just so good. I'm constantly rereading them.
StarWarsEU,2ydlxg,dreamer_dw,9,Mon Mar 9 15:17:00 2015 UTC,"If I have to choose just one... It's tough. I think I'd have to go with Shatterpoint. I think the Thrawn Trilogy and Traitor are both superior, but the Thrawn Trilogy is obviously 3 books and Traitor is so deeply steeped in NJO lore that it's hard to claim it as best single novel as a standalone. Shatterpoint is just fantastic, though. It was one of my first big introductions to Mace Windu outside the films - where he was, at best, a minor supporting character - and Stover is the best at really diving into a character's psyche.  Maybe I should reread that before I dive back into the NJO..."
StarWarsEU,2ydlxg,Ahesterd,3,Sun Mar 8 22:31:16 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I'm not a huge fan of the prequel era stuff, but I did read Shatterpoint and I remember really enjoying it. Easily my favorite prequel era material I've read/seen."
StarWarsEU,2ydlxg,AnusHoldus,2,Sun Mar 8 22:52:37 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I have very little interest in prequel era, but I love Stover, and Shatterpoint  did it for me."

I don't like how Stover pushes his ideas about the force onto every character regardless of if it suits them or not. With Traitor I could look past it as Jacen was always in flux but Mace? An ""edgy"" Mace just made me cringe."
StarWarsEU,2ydlxg,Ansoni,3,Sun Mar 8 22:53:59 2015 UTC,"It's really the only Mace I know - it's one of the only prequel era things I've read - so I can't really compare it to other author's characterization. So far as Stover's characterization of the Force - I really like that there's a concept of it as more than just the straightforward light-or-dark we see so often. For the most part I like the way that Star Wars tends to be optimistic and, well, mythic, but every once in awhile I also appreciate letting it descend into the gray areas, especially because it's a relatively rare occurrence."
StarWarsEU,2ydlxg,Ahesterd,2,Sun Mar 8 23:01:22 2015 UTC,"Having not read any of his books, what are his ideas on the force?"
StarWarsEU,2ydlxg,mnky9800n,1 point,Sun Mar 8 23:27:39 2015 UTC,"That was poor wording on my part. It wasn't just about the force but also about morality.   It's been a while since I read any of his works but in general he takes takes any light out of the light side. All of the characters he writes stories about suddenly become a murky neutral instead of any good they are portrayed as having before and after his work. A lot of dark for dark's sake.  And the edginess. I remember the moment I decided I wasn't going to enjoy shatterpoint.  It was very early. Mace is completely stumped when a character points out that it didn't really matter that he couldn't save someone because everyone he saves will die eventually.   However, shatterpoint, traitor, and the rots novelisation seem to be fan favourites so don't let me tell you how to think about them."
StarWarsEU,2ydlxg,Ansoni,2,Mon Mar 9 00:19:52 2015 UTC,"I very much disagree with you.  Stover doesn't force neutrality on characters, but he does force them into situations where they have to question the morality that they stand by."
StarWarsEU,2ydlxg,QWERTYPOIUYqwerty,1 point,Mon Mar 9 03:18:49 2015 UTC,"This is probably one point where traitor surpasses shatterpoint. Stover could put his voice into vergere and teach his views to Jacen, which was much less insufferably unnatural than edgy mace."
StarWarsEU,2ydlxg,Ansoni,2,Mon Mar 9 06:13:37 2015 UTC,"I'm going to first say that I don't enjoy much I've read that takes place outside of the OT/New Republic eras so that's what you're going to see here. The NJO era is what made me stop reading Star Wars novels.  Second, my favorite single novel would probably be Solo Command from the X-Wing series. It is a great finish to the Wraith Squadron storyline with things that seemed like throw-aways in earlier novels wrapped up in amazing drama. RIP Aaron Allston.  Third, my favorite books, if I could choose any combination, has to be Zahn's Thrawn trilogy. I especially like the way he consistently references Earth literature and mythology from Sturm and Drang literature to the use of Thrawn's viper versus C'baoth's lion and Pellaeon's goat on the Chimera makes it incredibly complex in pleasing ways to my adult mind but still worked amazingly well in my teen years without me knowing these things."

StarWarsEU,2ydlxg,Lanuria,2,Wed Mar 11 04:19:19 2015 UTC,"EDIT: There are some spoilers below, I tried to hide them using the (/spoiler) method, but it doesn't seem to be working. If you haven't read the Hand of Thrawn Books and would like to one day, be warned.  Timothy Zahn's Spector of the Past and Vision of the Future (aka the Hand of Thrawn 'Duology') were, for me, a huge moment in the EU. Arguably, the original Thrawn Trilogy in the early 90's is what reignited interest in Star Wars for new fans (including myself at the time), and it set the stage for a lot a great work to come, but for the most part none of it really hit the mark in the way that trilogy did. In the years between The Last Command and Specter of the Past there were very few creators who really seemed to care about a coherent continuity the way Zahn did. Most authors just didn't do their homework and created stories that made little sense given where the core characters were in their lives during the times the books were supposedly taking place. One notable exception would be the late A.C. Crispin, and if you haven't read her Han Solo Trilogy I would check it out.   Anyways, the Hand of Thrawn books were, I believe, an attempt by Zahn to tie up a bunch of loose ends in the EU and set it on the path to something bigger and better. He really did a fantastic job of exploring Luke's motivations throughout the more bizarre events in the EU, including Luke's brief fall to the dark side in Dark Empire and the subsequent effects it had on the Jedi Academy's rough start, a failed romance with Callista, and his weird soul-searching during the Black Fleet Crisis books. It also put an end to a lot of the story tropes that were seriously getting stale. No more super-weapons, no more big-bad imperial warlords hiding on a back-water planet just waiting to strike out, thanks to a peace treaty signed by Admiral Palleon, no more fighting the Imperial Remnant. It even tied up the budding romance with Luke and Mara Jade in a way that was pretty heartfelt - at least to me at the time. Additionally, they set up what could have been some really cool explorations of the Unknown Regions and Chiss society, a place in the Star Wars universe that we hadn't really been before (and yes, I read Survivor and Outbound Flight; they just weren't enough). Vision of the Future even introduced a whole new philosophy of the force near the end that would get us away from the light/dark, jedi/sith dichotomy, at least a little bit.   After this, I was seriously stoked for where Star Wars was going. Then the prequel trilogy happened, then the New Jedi Order happened and I pretty much stopped paying attention to it. I got to the point in NJO where there was a guy with lightsabers on his knees and elbows and I was just kinda 'out' after that. I know that pretty soon none of this is going to matter since it's not canon anymore (and that I'm officially an old fart when it comes to Star Wars) but I just thought I'd share my thoughts."
StarWarsEU,2ydlxg,lanktank,1 point,Wed Mar 11 14:38:24 2015 UTC,"That's tough!  I would have to say Revenge of the Sith or Traitor might be the best written novels that I have read.

StarWarsEU,2ydlxg,HobbieK,1 point,Thu Mar 12 17:36:03 2015 UTC,I've read almost all of the EU novels and I'd say my favorite series is the Republic/Imperial Commando series. I really loved the character development. The books brought me to tears at times and made me laugh out loud at others. They're my favorite books I've ever read. I've reread the series a bunch of times. I'm actually currently rereading them right now.
StarWarsEU,2ydw5m,encycl,14,Sun Mar 8 23:37:07 2015 UTC,"How far do you want to go back?  I'd recommend starting with the Tales of the Jedi comics, set 4,000 years before the movies. This explores the very first conflicts between the Jedi and the Sith, when they numbered legion and ruled their own rival Empire. Read them in the order they came out, so Ulic Qel-Droma and the Beast Wars of Onderon first, delving into Golden Age of the Sith and Fall of the Sith Empire (set a thousand years before the others, a prequel of sorts) after you've finished Redemption. I cannot recommend TOTJ enough; the art might be outdated, TOTJ having been published years before The Phantom Menace, but this really is the work that established so much of Sith and Jedi history, on which were built all later works.  Next up are the Knights of the Old Republic comics, and then The Old Republic novels (Revan, Deceived, Fatal Alliance, Annihilation), however I would suggest not reading the latter if you haven't played the Knights of the Old Republic and The Old Republic video games, which these novels complement (serving as a sequel to KOTOR & KOTOR II, and backstory to TOR). So instead jump forward to 1,000 years before the movies, where the Sith Wars rage anew in the Darth Bane trilogy (Path of Destruction, Rule of Two, Dynasty of Evil), covering the alleged extinction of the Sith and how the Sith came to number only two. While set chronologically earlier in-universe, I would recommend until after reading Darth Bane to read the Knight Errant novel and Knight Errant comics. Note: the latter was cancelled, so don't expect much for story resolution. Still very good stuff, though.  Closer to the prequels, we have Darth Plagueis and Cloak of Deception, which, together, serve as an excellent prequel to TPM. In terms of works set during and after the prequels, I'd most strongly recommend the novels Shatterpoint, Yoda: Dark Rendezvous, Labyrinth of Evil, the truly unpareil Revenge of the Sith novelisation, Dark Lord: The Rise of Darth Vader and Kenobi, and the Republic comics.  If you want to go really, really far back, there's always the Dawn of the Jedi comics and tie-in novel, set over 20,000 years before TOTJ and nearly 26,000 years before the movies. Guess what it covers. ;) Note: Also, sadly, incomplete.  There's plenty of other stuff that's good... Republic Commando, Lost Tribe of the Sith, and even the very recently released novella SkyeWalkers, but what I've suggested above is more than enough to start with. Enjoy!"
StarWarsEU,2ydw5m,KOTORman,3,Mon Mar 9 01:45:41 2015 UTC,Knights of the Old Republic comics was great. Darth Bane trilogy also good.
StarWarsEU,2ydw5m,Sapitoelgato,1 point,Sun Mar 8 23:59:24 2015 UTC,"Depends on which Old Republic you're talking about. There's the Republic shown in the prequel trilogy and then there's the Old Republic thousands of years earlier. The Darth Bane trilogy is the most recommended for the older era. There's also the Old Republic series (Revan, Deceived, Fatal Alliance, Annihilation) that is to my understanding largely backstory to the MMO SWTOR. For the prequel era, Darth Plagueis is supposed to be pretty good, following the exploits of Sidious and his master. Rogue Planet and Outbound Flight have some ties to events in the New Republic era. There are the Republic Commando novels. I think most people liked Shatterpoint, and there's the unofficially named Dark Lord trilogy, consisting of Labyrinth of Evil, the Revenge of the Sith novelization, and Dark Lord: The Rise of Darth Vader. That covers most of that era."
StarWarsEU,2ydw5m,darthsci12,2,Mon Mar 9 00:53:14 2015 UTC,"Annihilation is a sequel to the vanilla MMO and one of the comic book miniseries and takes place before the Rise of the Hutt Cartel expansion. Revan is a sequel to KOTOR1 and KOTOR2 and a prequel to the MMO. Deceived and Fatal Alliance are both prequels to the MMO, with Deceived taking part after the first trailer and Fatal Alliance - 10 years before the game."

Probably my favourite novella! How glorious that Legends' last gasp is one of its strongest. Loved Atha Prime's Dawkinsian references to The Selfish Gene (the immortality of genetic information), quantum immortality and timeless identity theory (identical mental copies being oneself), as well as the exploration of various hitherto unknown Force mechanics (such as resonance between Force-sensitive clones due to shared midichlorian signatures, midichlorians resisting the dark side artifice of memory rubs, and so on).

He's the '66 Shelby Cobra of his kind so to speak.   Also, in his decades of existence he never once had his memory wiped which is extremely rare. This allowed him to develop a personality. And since he was always owned and surrounded by heroic people I imagine that's how he developed his sense of determination and bravery.  Finally, I also think he's been very lucky."

I don't have any solid source for the 'best model' point, but it I know it's established in one of the Thrawn books (and perhaps plenty of other books) that R2's lack of memory resets gives him a much quicker reaction time (and sorta, in a robot way, makes him smarter).    As for luck, yes. Never underestimate luck."

StarWarsEU,2y3yed,kaitokid1985,6,Wed Mar 11 19:31:05 2015 UTC,"I am not a fan of the POV...but I loved the book.  It just felt like the same universe in which the Legends novels took place. The care of matching the Givin personality and mannerisms to the X-Wing novels, the travel time and complexity of hyperspace (which I feel they do really badly in Clone Wars and don't address too much in New Dawn), the presence of familiar ships and so on. At times Clone Wars feels like a different universe and that scares me that this sets the tone for the new canon. Heir to the Jedi put me at ease somewhat. Loved it."
StarWarsEU,2y3yed,Sapitoelgato,3,Fri Mar 6 15:17:17 2015 UTC,I am excited to pick it up! I have read all the new comics and they are great too.
StarWarsEU,2y3yed,CogzillaAttacks,2,Fri Mar 6 05:40:50 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your review!   I'm reading through it right now... I'm in chapter 7 and I can't help but think it's moving along a little slowly. I feel like it's going to be a struggle to get through.   I'm having a hard time with the first person narrative, at times it feels a bit forced. The world-building seems a little weak to me, after having just read Tarkin, it just seems a little lacking. The action doesn't seem to be there (although I'm still in the opening stages of the novel). A New Dawn was quite the opposite, I felt hooked from the beginning... I wanted to know more about Kanan, Rae Sloane and Vidian right from the start. Maybe that's the inherent nature in writing about someone we feel like we know so much about already. Luke's development between ANH and ESB is something I want to experience, I just hope it feels ""right"" to me. I'm hoping it picks up.  I do appreciate Luke's naiveté with the force and life, in general, but it just doesn't feel like he's the guy who just piloted the ship that blew up the Death Star in the Battle of Yavin.   That being said, I'll probably finish it up early next week. I'm hoping it picks up."

I'm a little uncertain about the title, I'm not sure whether to take it as a kind of tip of the hat/respectful nod to Heir to the Empire or just a cheap clone title.  Either way, I look forward to discussing it -spoilers and all- with you guys when I've read it. I just have to finish the Jedi Academy trilogy first :P"
StarWarsEU,2y3yed,tullan12,2,Tue Mar 10 00:38:27 2015 UTC,I just finished Tarkin and I loved it. I think it gives a great idea on how tarkin works and what he did for the empire!
StarWarsEU,2y3yed,IDontWASHMYFeet,2,Tue Mar 10 19:03:34 2015 UTC,"I'm reading through/about to finish Dark Apprentice and Admiral Daala is pretty much a Tarkin copy-cat so I can see how it would be somewhat interesting. Having said that though, those parts are really boring. I'm just not sure how anyone can make life on a Star Destroyer/Death Star that stimulating. I'm sure there is a lot of space combat action but personally I can't really picture that when reading, they often name specific maneuvers to describe movement that I just have no idea about.   Anyway, enough rambling. I'll probably pick it up at some point. I like that I'm getting the chance to jump in at the beginning of a canon, I never had the chance before cause you know...the whole not being born thing made it difficult :P"
StarWarsEU,2y3yed,tullan12,1 point,Tue Mar 10 19:55:09 2015 UTC,Oh for sure. It actually doesn't take place on the star destroyer which I was expecting as well. Either way I think its worth a read.   Good luck with finishing Dark Apprentice! I enjoyed that too!
StarWarsEU,2y3yed,RVierra327,1 point,Tue Mar 10 20:47:33 2015 UTC,My main complaint with the book was that the first half of the book felt completely random and barely connected to the larger narrative of the second half.

StarWarsEU,2y2muu,tx2005,5,Thu Mar 5 22:31:43 2015 UTC,"A New Dawn is how Kanan Jarrus meets Hera Syndulla and her Ghost ship. It is set 5 years before the Rebels TV show, and is a quick fun story.   Tarkin is set 5 years after Revenge of the Sith, and follows Tarkin and Darth Vader as they deal, with a rebel cell that is causing sabotage. The story explores Tarkin's motivation and back story growing up. There are a lot of references to the EU and The Clone Wars. It is a fun read.  Heir to the Jedi is a first person story set after A New Hope, but before the new Star Wars comics. It deals with Luke Skywalker going on a mission to retrieve a code breaker, and he teams up, with a new female character. Some parts have math in them, and other parts have a little horror. This one I have not read yet.  Hope that helps!"

I've read A New Dawn and am working on writing a review of it on my Star Wars blog. Quick version of review is it that is entertaining, especially if you are a fan of the Rebels show, but not earth shattering by any means.   Tarkin I started but didn't finish yet, so can't say much about it other than it's about the rise of Grand Moff Tarkin, and I think the beginnings of the Death Star.   Heir to the Jedi just came out on Tuesday and I'm working on it now. It's a first person story about Luke helping the rebellion while trying to expand his personal aptitude with the force. It is probably the best place to start for fans because it features Luke Skywalker."

Lords of the Sith is coming out in April, and is about Vader and the Emperor getting stuck on a planet doing a mission together.  Dark Disciple comes out in July and is based on an unused script from season 6 of Clone Wars featuring Asajj Ventress and Quinlan Vos.   Other un-named books have dates on Random House's website, but not names or summaries."
StarWarsEU,2y2muu,touchmyid,2,Thu Mar 5 23:00:57 2015 UTC,"I will also throw out that new Marvel Star Wars Comics. There are three series (soon to be four) that are on going right now. Star Wars, which started in January, Issue 3 comes out this month. Takes place between the events of ep. IV and V  Darth Vader, which also started in Feb, issue 3 also comes out this month and takes place shortly after the events of Issue 1 & 2 of Star Wars comic. Princess Leia which started this week, picks up right after the end of Ep. IV with the evacuation of the Yavin. In April, a 4th series will start called Kanan, and you guessed it stars Kanan from Rebels. It takes place shortly before and after Order 66.  Both Princess Leia and Kanan are short series, 5 or 6 issues. While Star Wars and (supposedly) Darth Vader are going to be on-going. If you want, you can wait for the trade paperbacks, which collect a few issues together at a time. But those won't be out for a while."

StarWarsEU,2xzbfh,Dfost35,5,Thu Mar 5 02:55:46 2015 UTC,"If you get it digitally there might be some occasional sales to take advantage of? There was a sale for all the comics for $300 at the end of Dark Horses' reign, but Marvel might do something similar as they re-release the classic.  Personally I think there're enough great legacy comics that it's worth picking those up one at a time and enjoying them, but prioritise keeping current on the new canon."
StarWarsEU,2xzbfh,Esteluk,3,Thu Mar 5 17:39:49 2015 UTC,I have had good luck getting maybe a 3rd of them used on Amazon and then watching eBay for the more rare ones. I have gotten a coupe fifty dollar ones for twenty
StarWarsEU,2xzbfh,ryan_schlueter,2,Thu Mar 5 03:54:50 2015 UTC,"I don't know where you're getting the $900 estimate from. I've basically done the same thing as you, and started collecting all the Dark Horse Omnibuses (not the new Marvel Omnibuses that are coming out soon collecting the old Dark Horse comics, though they do look cool.) To be fair I'm skipping a few of the omnibuses, such as the ones collecting the Marvel years (A Long Time Ago...)and the ones collecting the odds and ends (Wild Space/Tales), but I'm still aiming to get about two thirds of the whole collection, and I'm almost done. So far, most of the books have cost me £10-£15 on eBay, with a couple of the rarer/out-of-print books being closer to £30. I reckon with 5 books left that I want to buy, I've spent just over £200, and if I were to buy them alll it'd probably take me to £350, so nowhere near $900. Still, a lot of it is patience in waiting for the older ones to appear at a sensible price.  As for the current stuff, I've picked up the first issues of each one, but to save money in the long run I'm now going to wait til the trade paperbacks come out in September, for ease of reading and storage.  So yeah, sounds like you're in a similar boat to me and that's how I'm approaching it. Hope this helps."
StarWarsEU,2xzbfh,timmypix,2,Sat Mar 7 13:01:18 2015 UTC,"I can't comment on the quality of the newer 'canon' stories, but I definitely recommend collecting the various omnibuses (omnibii?).  They sometimes vary in quality, but I loved Knights of the Old Republic and Legacy.  I also quite enjoyed the Rebellion/Empire series and Dark Times and even Jedi vs Sith.  I recommend this everytime someone asks about comics but if you don't mind a bit of spoilage of storylines, I'd suggest reading the Vector crossover story that covers Knights of the Old Republic, Dark Times, Rebellion and Legacy.  I believe these are all collected as part of the various omnibus collections but if you check these out, it will help give you a taste of what the stories and artwork is like for each era of the Dark Horse comics."
StarWarsEU,2xzbfh,tunnel-snakes-rule,3,Thu Mar 5 03:28:12 2015 UTC,"Star Wars #1 was pretty basic, but good.  Darth Vader #1, if the quality it started with remains, will be recommended reading."
StarWarsEU,2xzbfh,technologicalbrian,1 point,Thu Mar 5 03:43:41 2015 UTC,I'm a little hesitant to read any of the new comics.  Is there much in the way of world building or introducing new characters?  I am worried that they'll be forced to stick between the lines until the new films come out and expand the canon which doesn't really appeal to me.
StarWarsEU,2xzbfh,tunnel-snakes-rule,3,Thu Mar 5 04:39:06 2015 UTC,"I will admit that so far, and I've only read #1 of each so I'm guessing this will change, it's been more character driven than world-building.  However, I suspect later in the arcs, there will be a bit more world-building, especially in the main anthology title (the one simply called ""Star Wars"")."
StarWarsEU,2xzbfh,technologicalbrian,2,Thu Mar 5 05:52:12 2015 UTC,"Not really too many new characters for the time being, it's been very much a safe, familiar start, and that is by no means a bad thing.

StarWarsEU,2xzbfh,timmypix,1 point,Sat Mar 7 13:10:55 2015 UTC,"Knights of the Old Republic was 50 issues long (or 3 omnibuses), and was a blast to read.  I had trouble getting into Clone Wars comics as it differs greatly from the TV shows (both the canon and legends show). I finished it, but elements were just off.  Do pick up Son of Dathomir as it is a continuation of The Clone Wars Maul story.  I am still going through a lot of the comics myself."
StarWarsEU,2xzbfh,Sapitoelgato,1 point,Thu Mar 5 04:00:27 2015 UTC,"I would start reading the new canon, the comics that are out now are far better than anything they ever released in Legends because they actually tie in directly to the main and supporting characters of the films with details relevant to the plot of the films.   Pretty much all of the old comics are just spinoff material. You also have the benefit of being able to collect brand new works as they come up if you are a collector."

StarWarsEU,2xzbfh,Charlemagne_III,1 point,Sat Mar 7 16:18:08 2015 UTC,"Well, you said the new ones are far better because they're not spinoffs, therefore there is an implied value judgement that spinoffs are bad, or at least that's how I interpreted it; my apologies if I was mistaken. I just want to have a conversation, see which comics you liked or didn't like to prefer the new ones so much. It's always cool to see different perspectives."
StarWarsEU,2xzbfh,timmypix,1 point,Sat Mar 7 22:07:17 2015 UTC,"Pretty much every comic is good except Dark Empire gets a little carried away with the superweapons, but none of them really matter because whether or not they happened is completely irrelevant to the main story arc."
StarWarsEU,2xysg8,zakfennie,11,Thu Mar 5 00:16:09 2015 UTC,The events of Kenobi take place roughly over a two week span. Definitely read it before Dark Lord.
StarWarsEU,2xysg8,Sapitoelgato,5,Thu Mar 5 00:31:31 2015 UTC,I don't know Dark Lord but Kenobi also takes place almost immediately following Revenge of the Sith. The prologue of the book could almost have been an epilogue to the movie.
StarWarsEU,2xysg8,XAce90,1 point,Thu Mar 5 02:55:59 2015 UTC,Well if you read Labyrinth and Episode III then Dark Lord is an easy answer to complete that storyline.  But Kenobi is great. It is one of my favorite books in the Legends EU. Highly recommend it.
StarWarsEU,2xysg8,touchmyid,0,Thu Mar 5 22:22:16 2015 UTC,Kenobi was a huge disappointment.  What I imagined it would be was way more interesting than what it actually was.  I wish I hadn't read it.
StarWarsEU,2xysg8,G-42,4,Thu Mar 5 13:28:47 2015 UTC,"Aw, come on. Sure, the parts about the Calwells and the Gaults (not sure if I spelled them right, I listened to the audiobook) were rather slow, but to me the A'yark and Obi-Wan parts were phenomenal. The stories of the Tatoonians, while relatively boring, were still a glimpse of the lives of normal people in the galaxy. Not everyone is running around with eventful lives. To me that made up for it.  A'yark's story was fantastic. Tusken culture is so interesting, and it was expanded on here, which was very good.  But to me, the highlight was the eponymous character. Kenobi's personality was captured perfectly. His regret, his kindness, everything. I couldn't help but smile whenever he had the spotlight."
StarWarsEU,2xysg8,sombraptor,3,Thu Mar 5 19:25:14 2015 UTC,100% agree. I wish there was a Kenobi series.
StarWarsEU,2xysg8,getridofwires,1 point,Thu Mar 5 22:08:05 2015 UTC,"The Tusken aspect was well done, although when it comes to Tuskens, I'd prefer a lot be left mysterious rather than having every detail of their culture, psychology, and physiology explained in total detail.  What bothered me was Kenobi himself was doing everything opposite his mission - instead of keeping to himself, he made sure he was famous as soon as he got there.  Everyone for 100 miles or more knew he was there and what his name was.  Like his face had never been on the news, or on whatever they call the internet.  Nobody in all of Tattooine can tag him on Galactic facebook and let their facial recognition see who he is?  And of course he has to let everyone know he's interested in the Lars family, but don't ask why!  It's a big secret!  He couldn't even bother to come up with an innocent-sounding lie to cover his ass.  Not to mention the very first scene in the book is a total ripoff of the cantina scene from A New Hope.  And other than that first scene, the first 100 pages had pretty much nothing to do with Kenobi.  You could skip those pages and miss nothing at all.  Believe me, I wanted to love that book.  I waited for months to read it so I could take it on holidays and read it in the hammock beside the lake.  But no way."

StarWarsEU,2xvz3l,timmypix,1 point,Sat Mar 7 13:15:05 2015 UTC,"They were not explicit about things with continued support which is the gray area. What's even more gray is that EA, the sole wielder of the Star Wars license, owns SWTOR. I can quote them directly if you'd like but every Star Wars titled launched after a certain date was said to be canon and SWTOR launched an expansion after that date. There's been no official confirmation one way or the other that I've seen."
StarWarsEU,2xvz3l,Colest,1 point,Sat Mar 7 14:06:21 2015 UTC,"Point being that that was an expansion on an existing title - it's still not canon. Any brand new games - like the new Battlefront - will take place in the canon, but TOR isn't and expansions don't change that. Not that it matters, as it doesn't make it any less enjoyable. To be honest, it's still in my ""head canon"" as it hasn't really been contradicted by anything in the canon proper, and maybe they'll accomodate for it later, as I'd bet on it being a while before they do anything in that time frame. But for now, it's Legends."

StarWarsEU,2xves4,CircumstancesAsunder,5,Wed Mar 4 04:37:14 2015 UTC,"I'd agree.  Bane's book really gets into the nuts and bolts of the basic concepts of the Sith that made for a fascinating read.  Not to mention the references to Bane in Plagueis' book.  Read both, Bane first."
StarWarsEU,2xves4,CursoryComb,7,Wed Mar 4 16:43:34 2015 UTC,"Hmm, depends on the era you want to explore. Both would be great. I say do this:  Darth Bane trilogy, followed by Darth Plagueis, Revenge of the Sith and then Tarkin."

On the other hand, although a lot of vocal members love Darth Plagueis, it is definitely a more divisive text. I personally wasn't a big fan and I know there are at least dozens of us.  Honestly I'd recommend reading at least Path of Destruction before Plagueis if only to have a better context of the 'bane lineage' that they keep talking about. You can even read Rule of Two and Dynasty of Evil if you have the time and enjoyed PoD but, as /u/Charlemagne_III said, those books cannot hold a torch to the original."

Maybe it was just because it was so hyped up by the time I read it that it just sort of fell flat for me.  I was actually hoping that Rule of Two and Dynasty of Evil would help re-contextualize it in way that I'd find more meaningful, but apparently they're not as good?  That being said, I HAD read Plagueis (and absolutely loved it) before PoD, so maybe that had something to do with it?"

StarWarsEU,2xves4,Eric_Schooley,2,Wed Mar 4 04:39:22 2015 UTC,"I loved the bane trilogy, great insight into the rule of two and modernish  sith philosophy"
StarWarsEU,2xves4,Apex2113,2,Wed Mar 4 05:21:00 2015 UTC,"I think Path of Destruction is excellent, but Rule of Two suffers from a Mary Sue, and Dynasty of Evil is all over the place. Plagueis was decent but not excellent. The Duology was likewise decent but failed to capture like the original Trilogy."
StarWarsEU,2xves4,Charlemagne_III,1 point,Wed Mar 4 05:35:03 2015 UTC,"Hmm why do you think it's a Mary Sue? And although I think all three books are excellent, the first book is indeed the most excellent. Simply because it's only focused on Bane and the Sith, whereas the other ones introduce other characters, which aren't bad by any means. But you really want to hear mroe about Bane and Zannah, just because they're great characters"
StarWarsEU,2xves4,youguysgonnamakeout,1 point,Fri Mar 6 08:11:04 2015 UTC,Are you serious? He is basically invulnerable throughout most of the book.
StarWarsEU,2xves4,Charlemagne_III,2,Fri Mar 6 15:45:05 2015 UTC,"No I was kidding... I was actually asking. You mean because of the Oribilisk (sp?) armour? I didn't see that as an issue because he only got into one real fight, and was almost killed during it."
StarWarsEU,2xves4,youguysgonnamakeout,2,Sat Mar 7 02:27:55 2015 UTC,It doesn't really matter that you know he only used it once against Jedi after you read it. While reading it you knew nothing could possibly happen to him.
StarWarsEU,2xves4,Charlemagne_III,1 point,Sat Mar 7 16:18:57 2015 UTC,"Well yeah I knew because he was the main character lol I'm curious, what would you have changed? What do you think should have happened to him?"
StarWarsEU,2xves4,youguysgonnamakeout,2,Sat Mar 7 19:51:23 2015 UTC,"I'm personally not a fan of Bane, but Darth Plagueis is great if you want to read a book that acts as the Prequel Trilogy's plothole destroyer."
StarWarsEU,2xves4,outbound_flight,1 point,Wed Mar 4 23:33:53 2015 UTC,Sure would love to have a book that fills in the gaps of the prequels.
StarWarsEU,2xves4,JediGrandMaster,1 point,Fri Mar 6 01:20:32 2015 UTC,Thanks for all the responses!  Plagueis referencing the lore laid down in the Bane trilogy is a pretty good reason to read them first.  Just got Path of Destruction to start.  Thanks again!
StarWarsEU,2xves4,youguysgonnamakeout,1 point,Wed Mar 4 17:36:48 2015 UTC,"I would say read Bane first, not only a great read, but also Plaguies in one sense caps off what Bane started."
StarWarsEU,2xves4,KOTORman,1 point,Wed Mar 4 21:12:34 2015 UTC,"Well it just makes sense chronologically to read the Bane trilogy first. Also if you're into audiobooks I suggest those, holy shit they're so well done, with sound effects and all"
StarWarsEU,2xves4,dyltrocity,1 point,Fri Mar 6 08:05:04 2015 UTC,"The Bane trilogy is written by Drew Karpshyn, who comes from the gaming industry and it shows in his prose. Entertaining, but shallow. Darth Plagueis is unquestionably better written, and given that it serves as the quintessential prequel to The Phantom Menace, I'd suggest reading it first."
StarWarsEU,2xrf89,AmunRa666,3,Tue Mar 3 06:17:48 2015 UTC,"I got really disappointed for a minute after I saw the guards, expecteing fulcrum to be Leia. Made the reveal so much better."

StarWarsEU,2xrf89,pjlovesauce,2,Wed Mar 4 01:20:34 2015 UTC,"Watched this tonight (it's on during my son's bedtime, so we watch it on Tuesdays). Very exciting. I was always drawn in by Ahsoka's character after season 2 of TCW. I think it's a sensible addition to the Rebels story arc.  Begs the question of what happened to Ventress. I wouldn't mind seeing both puppets (if you will) representing disillusionment doing what they can in their own way to bring down the establishment."
StarWarsEU,2xrf89,xilban,2,Wed Mar 4 01:19:50 2015 UTC,"Aw dammit.  I thought I was done with her.  I was also hoping Fulcrum was Mon Mothma, but I see that was too much to ask.  I'm just bitter for seeing that girl.  Let's see, for next season Vader better show how much of a overwhelming force and tactician he can be.  There needs to be several episodes where Vader outsmarts the team as they are trying to implement missions.  If he took out Fulcrum, that would be justice in my eyes.  I'd also love to see a Hand of the Emperor, but that's probably asking too much."
StarWarsEU,2xrf89,FrothingTapir,1 point,Wed Mar 4 01:51:07 2015 UTC,"My biggest issue with the show is how cartoonishly unthreatening the empire is. How many times can you use ""lol Stormtroopers r dum"" as a plot device before your villain is totally flaccid?"
StarWarsEU,2xrf89,BrandenR1,0,Sun Mar 22 21:48:17 2015 UTC,Can someone clarify how this is still cannon? I know some Jedi survived the purge but does this just mean that all the Jedi in this show need to die before A New Hope? I'm loving the show just having trouble wrapping my mind around it.
StarWarsEU,2xrf89,SQUI_,6,Tue Mar 3 08:11:07 2015 UTC,It's likely they'll kill them off or send them into hiding. Legends had several Jedi that survived and came out of the woodwork when Luke was setting up his academy.
StarWarsEU,2xrf89,ganthetjr,4,Tue Mar 3 10:14:57 2015 UTC,"Technically speaking, none of them are Jedi, merely individuals who are trained in the Force, but as far as where they'll be when the OT starts, who knows. Either dead, hiding, or something else. I'm sure we'll get to find out."
StarWarsEU,2xrf89,styxtraveler,8,Tue Mar 3 13:29:11 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure Kanan became a jedi last night, I would say that qualified as passing his trials, just like Luke became a Jedi after facing Vader."

One question I've always had is this, if a bounty hunter wants to catch his prey, shouldn't he not stick out in a crowd? I feel bristling with weapons like Boba Fett, even in a universe where everyone has a gun on their hip, is a little obvious.  And apparently everyone hates the plinkett reviews now and talks about the amazing storytelling in the prequels. I don't think I watched the same movies as everyone else.  Don't get me wrong, I love star wars, I just think it's okay to say ""this part over here is fucking stupid."" I mean we might as well talk about how Waru is the greatest fucking star wars story ever."

I didn't know there were stories after ROTJ and reading the ""What has gone before"" section and finding out everything that had happened, not only in the Corellian Trilogy, but some of the previous books, was one of the greatest moments in my Star Wars fandom. I won't forget it. After that I bought and read most of the books, but Assault at Selonia, while not the greatest, will always be special to me."

Actually now I think about it why isn't she using Luke's blue one that he gave her at the end of the last command? Either way. That's interesting, Thanks :)"
StarWarsEU,2xh4ze,Gryat,3,Sat Feb 28 18:32:48 2015 UTC,I don't really think so. Do you know how many floors there is on coruscant? There is more than one purple crystal in whole galaxy. Just like this from my mind i can think of Jaina and Jaden Korr both of which had purple crystal. And I'm sitting on a toilet not even trying to remember others in New Jedi Order with this color crystal.

StarWarsEU,2xh4ze,dopefiendeddie,0,Sun Mar 1 06:38:01 2015 UTC,It may have said magenta and I read purple for whatever reason.
StarWarsEU,2xh4ze,XAce90,1 point,Sun Mar 1 07:55:53 2015 UTC,I only brought it up because everyone is saying it in this thread. I'm not too familiar with her post Thrawn stuff but it does seem like her second lightsaber is purple (according to wookiepedia) and her first is magenta (with luke's lightsaber being used in between). That could be causing some confusion.

StarWarsEU,2xh4ze,mnky9800n,1 point,Sat Feb 28 18:45:07 2015 UTC,Luke kind of did the same at first
StarWarsEU,2xh4ze,autowikiabot,1 point,Sat Feb 28 20:38:20 2015 UTC,Not really. Obi-wan taught Luke how to use it on the Falcon with the training droid. He picked it up extremely fast because he was a Skywalker but he was trained non the less.   Kyle on the other hand literally picked up a lightsaber and could instantly block blaster shots and taught himself to use the force when he doesn't even come from a family of Jedi.
StarWarsEU,2xh4ze,mnky9800n,2,Sat Feb 28 20:49:59 2015 UTC,"You have to remember that when the game came out there was very little in the way of ""how you learn to use the force"" described to people. In the original series it does sort of seem like Luke teaches a lot to himself. Like, how did he just develop telekinesis between ANH and ESB? You never see anyone do any sort of telekinesis in ANH so the audience when first watching ESB was like ""WOW THAT WAS AWESOME"".  This doesn't change much between ROTJ and Dark Forces 2.  Honestly, I sort of liked the natural progression of abilities. You notice, most of Yoda's training in ESB isn't about blocking blaster bolts, swinging a lightsaber, or doing anything else you see in the prequels. It's about teaching Luke how to think and how to expand his mind to the possibilities of what he could do with the Force.  Life experience does this plenty. Can you imagine learning that your father was friends with a Jedi Knight and was force sensitive, helped hide is secrets, and then you realize that the reason you are quicker and faster is because you have a connection to the Force as well? I think this would motivate a lot of initial learning."

StarWarsEU,2x6x6n,VegasSaint9,5,Thu Feb 26 03:14:13 2015 UTC,"From the Canon and Legends points of view, Obi-Wan did know that Anakin and Vader were one and the same, and this happened in Episode III when he watched the security hologram in which Sidious referred to Anakin as Lord Vader. At first he thought he did kill Anakin. But when he heard of the Empire's terrifying enforcer Darth Vader, he knew Anakin was alive--as others have said, it's likely the news of this guy made its way to Tattooine. In Episode IV, Vader was able to sense Obi-Wan's presence aboard the Death Star, so it's safe to assume Kenobi was capable of doing the same. Then in the final confrontation, Kenobi refers to Vader as ""Darth."" While this could be taken as Kenobi saying, ""Aw shit who's dis Sith I'm fightin right now,"" I think it is actually recognition on Kenobi's part, especially considering the conversation that they have while dueling."
StarWarsEU,2x6x6n,Fox_shirt_guy,2,Thu Feb 26 14:21:57 2015 UTC,"I knew in RotS he heard the holo recording of him becoming a Lord of the Sith, but I didn't know after their duel on Mustafar if he knew he still existed. As far as I know, and since everythings retconned there was nothing to verify whether Obi Wan knew anything about him afterwards, but I guess he could feel him through the force. And when they duel on the Death Star i know he knew who he was after he sees Vader waiting for him. Idk i was just seeing if that perspective was possible.  Note: I haven't read any of the new canon books, just the new comics."
StarWarsEU,2x6x6n,Fox_shirt_guy,1 point,Thu Feb 26 19:05:46 2015 UTC,"I haven't read any of the new stuff either. /u/jethroboom has commented further down that Vader is well-known in ""Tarkin."" And unlike Yoda, Obi-Wan's exile wasn't total. He had to keep eyes and ears out to know what's going on to make sure Luke is safe on Tatooine. It's safe to assume that in the nineteen years between Eps III and IV, Obi-Wan heard something about Darth Vader's survival. It may have been a while before he found out. Maybe months or years, considering Vader had to recover from his wounds. In that time I'm sure Obi-Wan figured he'd killed Anakin. But he would have known he was wrong as soon as he heard someone utter the word ""Vader,"" because not very many people had access to that information before the duel on Mustafar."
StarWarsEU,2x6x6n,optimal_primate,4,Thu Feb 26 19:38:48 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure if this counts as canon, but at the end of Dark Lord: The Rise of Darth Vader, Sidious makes Vader known publicly as his enforcer, and Obi-Wan ends up seeing him on the HoloNet while on Tatooine."
StarWarsEU,2x6x6n,XAce90,2,Thu Feb 26 16:34:50 2015 UTC,"Obi-Wan ends up seeing him on the HoloNet while on Tatooine   Oh good to know. I figured he had to have heard about Darth Vader, even on Tatooine, but I couldn't be sure. Any clue where this is in the timeline?"
StarWarsEU,2x6x6n,mking22,2,Thu Feb 26 18:09:08 2015 UTC,I'm fairly confident it's right after arriving and giving Luke to his family.
StarWarsEU,2x6x6n,Charlemagne_III,1 point,Mon Mar 2 19:09:53 2015 UTC,Anakin didn't have any powers in the dark side when he was beaten. There is no way to attribute his surviving to that.
StarWarsEU,2x6x6n,XAce90,9,Thu Feb 26 04:07:34 2015 UTC,"Force powers aren't like skills you learn in an RPG. With a strong enough connection to the force, and the will/emotion to turn that connection into reality, there really is no limit to what one can do. And we all know Anakin had those two factors in spades."
StarWarsEU,2x6x6n,Charlemagne_III,1 point,Thu Feb 26 13:51:13 2015 UTC,"No, you have to train yourself to do things just like any other skill. The Jedi dont just dick around all day thinking about how powerful they are."
StarWarsEU,2x6x6n,JimJamJahar,3,Thu Feb 26 17:22:23 2015 UTC,"I think there is some element of natural affinity though. Look at Anakin in the Phantom Menace. He has received no Jedi training, yet he is the only human who has fast enough reflexes to podrace.    Since his hatred fuelled his connection to the dark side, it is reasonable to assume that this large connection would allow him to sustain himself until he was put into the suit, even without any training in the art of the dark side.    Kind of like being very strong versus being a martial arts expert. A black-belt may win a lot of fights, but a strong guy will too."
StarWarsEU,2x6x6n,Charlemagne_III,2,Thu Feb 26 19:04:24 2015 UTC,"When you put it that way it makes more sense. The comparison to Darth Sion threw me off. Sure, his latent powers were strong enough to keep him alive for a while, but I think it just had more to do with his overall strength in the Force. Saying he had ""dark side powers"" is probably a little much, especially even comparing him to Sion. I mean he was literally already dead, he just kept himself alive."
StarWarsEU,2x6x6n,brown_felt_hat,1 point,Thu Feb 26 20:03:39 2015 UTC,"I remember reading somewhere (maybe one of the non-canon novels) that Vader ended up being kind of a poster child of the evils of the Jedi in Imperial propaganda.  Like a ""Kind and benevolent protector?  Think again."" type of thing.  Obi-Wan thought he did leave Anakin to die, but Darth Vader was not a secret figure in the eyes of the public."
StarWarsEU,2x6x6n,jethroboom,4,Thu Feb 26 07:06:31 2015 UTC,"Even in 'Tarkin' which is in the new canon, 5 years after RotS, Vader is a well known entity in the galaxy.  Obi Wan will have known who he was, and that he was alive."
StarWarsEU,2x6x6n,XAce90,1 point,Thu Feb 26 14:24:37 2015 UTC,"To me, it seems that Obi Wan didn't even know Darth Vader still existed until he met him on the Death Star.   You know, after my Obi-Wan post, I started thinking about exactly that. Did Obi-wan eventually learn of Vader's continued existence? Even on remote Tatooine, wouldn't word have reached him of a Darth Vader? Maybe not.   I've been meaning to rewatch Episode IV (and maybe parts of V) with this in mind to see if I can better gauge his reaction. Last time I saw it (which was a couple years ago now), I interpreted Kenobi's face as knowingly disfiguring the truth (or, ""telling it from a certain point of veiw""). But maybe I was wrong.   P.S. thanks for the shout out! =) made my morning"
StarWarsEU,2x6x6n,Highest_Koality,1 point,Thu Feb 26 13:56:05 2015 UTC,Vader is well-known in the Galaxy in the novel Tarkin. Plus the way Obi-wan talks about Vader in A New Hope sounds like he knows he's alive.

In the audiobook excerpt Luke mentions the political structure of Rodia in which the Chattza clan rules the Tetsu clan. This is accurate to what I recall from Greedo's story in Tales from the Mos Eisley Cantina. Perhaps some of the details of the Rodian clan wars will change but it's clear, at the very least, the basic outline remains intact. They didn't have to keep the clan-centric political structure in Rodia or the Chattza as the ruling clan over the Tetsu. They didn't even have to keep the names of the clans Chattza and Tetsu. Fo that matter, they didn't even need to keep the planet's name as Rodia, but they did. To me that is a very encouraging sign."

People seem to be having a really hard time accepting that the EU didn't basically just get handed off to new people to continue -- things that we thought we knew are going to change, sometimes dramatically. I'm excited!"
StarWarsEU,2x3xzw,the_gv3,2,Thu Feb 26 00:29:34 2015 UTC,"The most exciting part is that now, at this age, I we can finally follow along with the new canon all the way. Reading each new material as it comes out and not having to browse through a few decades worth of stuff to catch up.  I mean, don't get me wrong, as a Star Wars fan born in the late 80s, I spent a huge amount of time catching up. I've read almost everything post ANH and some stuff from the Old Republic as well, but it is exciting that we can know/have read EVERYTHING much easier now."

I think the Princess Leia Marvel comic and Tarkin will be good starting points as I get to know some more or less established characters in their non-movie re-debuts."
StarWarsEU,2x3xzw,QWERTYPOIUYqwerty,-1,Thu Feb 26 06:21:32 2015 UTC,"I know this is a bit of an unpopular opinion but I always thought of the EU as glorified fan fiction and nothing else. While the stories were written well and had compelling arcs, I never once considered the content to have anything to do with the overall story of Star Wars in any way. Now that there is a story group who is overseeing the continuity of everything I am much more interested than I ever was before, and these new books, comics, and shows are more meaningful to me than the EU was before. These new stories actually count for something, if that makes sense. So I have no problem ditching what I've read in the past for the new canon. I'm glad Disney is doing what they're doing and making an attempt to establish brand new lore that doesn't contradict itself and flows smoothly from one author to the next. Am I sad about all of that being gone? Not at all. Do I wish they'll revive some EU stuff? Definitely. It still exists, I can still read and enjoy any one of those books, but they've never been canon to me. I've never been more excited to be a Star Wars fan than I am right now."
StarWarsEU,2x3xzw,mnky9800n,17,Wed Feb 25 14:54:01 2015 UTC,"Despite your opinion, the fact remains that the EU was canon, and not glorified fan-fiction.  There was a group overseeing continuity, and one that did a pretty good job since it really turned into something much larger than originally anticipated, and with a cranky overlord who would randomly throw his weight around on stories here and there.  Part of me feels sorry for you that you weren't able to appreciate the EU like I do, and part of me is confused as to why you looked at it like glorified fan-fiction before, and now that Disney dropped the ""Story Group"" title on a few people that are now doing the job was actually was done before, it is suddenly legit.  I mean, c'mon, the biggest continuity errors are within the movies.  Leia mentions that she remembers her mother as a young girl in Return of the Jedi, but we all know that Leia's mother died giving birth to her."
StarWarsEU,2x3xzw,mnky9800n,3,Wed Feb 25 15:26:17 2015 UTC,"I appreciate the EU, I just didn't ingrain it into my mind as this is definitely how the story of Kyle Katarn played out and nobody could ever tell me otherwise (just to give one example) in the way that other people have."
StarWarsEU,2x3xzw,ChiSoxBoy,4,Wed Feb 25 15:34:33 2015 UTC,"Gotcha.  So why will you feel that way about the ""new EU""?"
StarWarsEU,2x3xzw,mnky9800n,2,Wed Feb 25 15:40:00 2015 UTC,"Like I said in my initial post, I guess it's just because I feel like these stories will actually count for something. Disney announced that these will all connect with each other. Maybe because of the impact they'll possibly have on the films I'm taking them more seriously?"
StarWarsEU,2x3xzw,ChiSoxBoy,5,Wed Feb 25 16:01:37 2015 UTC,"Makes sense.  From my perspective I don't see how the previous EU didn't ""count for something"", but I got hooked on them pretty young and when the EU was also fairly young, so maybe that's why I view it as more serious than you do?  Knowing that stuff was taken from those books for the prequels and subsequent works of various formats made me feel like they were pretty legitimate."

StarWarsEU,2x3xzw,SoloIsGodly,10,Thu Feb 26 06:12:53 2015 UTC,"No offense (and sorry for post history creeping to confirm my suspicion), but I'd wager you have this opinion because you're 21. For the longest time there was nothing but the EU, and so Star Wars fans devoured it as there was only really the novels or the comics going. As you're 21, you didn't have to wait even slightly long for the prequels to come out, likely grew up with the Clone Wars cartoon and really only had a paltry wait for 7/8/9 to be announced.  So for you Star Wars as a movie franchise was alive and well just about the whole time, and you seem to be taking movie canon massively serious while downplaying decades of EU canon. Notably, this EU canon that also had to go through Lucas and get storylines vetted and approved, so it's not as fanfictiony as you make it out to be. Disney is not at all the first group to have a story team working on the canon. It's only notable because the franchise has now shifted hands and they had decades of canon to work through. Instead of doing that though, they took the easier route and decided to make their own stories, especially since their old main actors are definitely up there in age. Now, that said, I wouldn't care if Luke Skywalker was no longer Mark Hamil and we still got to see him starting young, kicking ass and raising the Jedi Academy from the grave.  You're absolutely entitled to your own opinion, but just like Barney in HIMYM has his ewoks theory with Star Wars, I was heavily suspecting your age group and how it might cause you to have that opinion. Confirmation bias just sealed that deal for me :P"
StarWarsEU,2x3xzw,ChiSoxBoy,6,Wed Feb 25 15:38:42 2015 UTC,"I find it odd you'd say this, I'm only 18 and yet I love the Legends continuity and barely care at all about the new 'canon'."
StarWarsEU,2x3xzw,QWERTYPOIUYqwerty,5,Wed Feb 25 17:04:42 2015 UTC,"Well there's no hard and fast rule of course, and you are actually a few years above the target demo for a lot of the new canon out to date(Rebels, for instance). My lazy deductions and sweeping statements are based on:   Odds that people below 25 read these days -- low and getting lower Odds that people below 25 have read THESE specific books and lots of them -- much lower Odds that OF the 18-25 age group they prefer the EU canon to the new prequels and Clone Wars canon -- Could go either way since it's just story preference, but again, odds are low that most people your age have read even 1 EU novel, and certainly not 10 or 30.   So, my one guess hazarded at the guy's age factoring into his likes was somewhat of a lucky, but educated, guess. I just know that reading is nowhere near as popular as it once was now with masses of streaming video services always demanding attention, and that the books kids do have to read often up being dried up old ""classics"" that don't hold their interest and hurt their interest in reading in the long run. My personal love for the EU comes from many places, but one is the quantity and span of them. What I mean by that is, while we only have about 13-14~ hours of actual Star Wars movie footage, I have probably hundreds of thousands of pages spanning decades up on my bookshelf. That's the biggest thing I feel cheated out of, is that all these fantastic stories I read likely will never grace a movie screen, and that just seems criminal with how great some of the books were. Alas, most of them would likely be difficult to adapt anyhow, but it doesn't mean you just leave them by the side of the road :("
StarWarsEU,2x3xzw,howlingchief,2,Wed Feb 25 17:17:50 2015 UTC,"I think your logic is fairly sound, I'm probably a bit of an anomaly as a star wars fan and Star Wars means all kinds of things to all different people.  I know my love of the EU started when I got the first issue of the official star wars fact file and there was a page on ancient lords of the Sith.  I remember being awed at the deep history of the star wars universe and really wanting to explore it.  I wasn't much of a reader when I was younger, but in the past ~3 years I've been reading a lot more and have been methodically going through everything in chronological order (just finished NJO: Traitor last night) and I'm loving it more than ever."
StarWarsEU,2x3xzw,Sapitoelgato,2,Wed Feb 25 18:07:02 2015 UTC,"<3 NJO and the Yuuzhan Vong storyline. It actually started to feel more visceral, real and that there were high stakes when characters started to get offed. If I could ever pick an EU storyline to come to life it'd be that one, but there'd be like 50 characters that the average viewer knows nothing about and it'd be like 15 movies long. I can dream....  Glad you're enjoying it!"
StarWarsEU,2x3xzw,thebardingreen,2,Wed Feb 25 19:49:14 2015 UTC,As a 21 year-old who started reading the EU over 10 years ago I take some offense to this. The Academy trilogy and Thrawn were the first 2 pieces of the EU I got into. They are integral to my headcanon. The TV show drastically changed everything. I did really enjoy Star Wars: Clone Wars though
StarWarsEU,2x3xzw,Timballist0,2,Thu Feb 26 04:41:05 2015 UTC,"hahaha No need to apologize, I understand that my young age could be a contributing factor to the way I feel about the EU. If I had never read any of the EU books then I wouldn't feel comfortable taking the stance that I've taken. But I feel like you've reduced my Star Wars fandom severely just due to my age. While I haven't had to wait as long as most other people for new content, I have had access to all of the same books, comics, and stories as any other Star Wars fan. I know there's no way to measure this but I wish I could be judged by the amount of Star Wars content I've consumed and not by the amount of time I've had to wait for new movies.  EDIT: It would be like saying I can't be a ""true"" Cubs fan because I haven't suffered through 106 years of losing seasons. If I've done all the research and I know the history of the Cubs, am I not still as much of a Cubs fan as a 90-year-old?"
StarWarsEU,2x3xzw,ghanbak,3,Wed Feb 25 16:10:39 2015 UTC,"You actually provided a perfect metaphor for this yourself, so I'll just go with it.   It would be like saying I can't be a ""true"" Cubs fan because I haven't suffered through 106 years of losing seasons. If I've done all the research and I know the history of the Cubs, am I not still as much of a Cubs fan as a 90-year-old?   Am I going to argue your level of fandom in either scenario? No. What I would argue is that your fandom and perceptions were very colored by the events that happened for you during your life, in the same way that older fans have different loves and perceptions. You may like the Cubs for what they are now and have passing knowledge of the older teams, but you didn't grow up with them, ONLY having those early rosters to root for and put up with for years and years. So for the same reason an older cubs fan would be over the moon about Frank Chance and a ""younger"" one (using that loosely here) might be way more into Ernie Banks or Billy Williams, Corran Horn or Kyle Katarn may mean nothing to you but why Ahsoka or Grievous means very little to a fan in their 30s.  I apologize if you feel that I denigrated your fandom in any way, and I admittedly have no idea if you've read 10 EU novels or 100 (though having ""access"" to the tidal wave of content that became the EU isn't the same as reading it, for the record). I just was hazarding a guess as to your age based off your opinion, happened to be right and got a little proud of myself :P"

StarWarsEU,2wz1ri,fatalblur,2,Tue Feb 24 18:47:32 2015 UTC,"Wookieepedia is, regretfully, being very resistant to the Legends shift. The novelizations of the six films (and the one for the TCW movie as well) are in a weird place, where Del Rey stated that they are actually still canon, but ""only where they align with the films."" So if a scene in the book matches up to the scene in the film, it can be considered canon - but for example, the Showdown of Coruscant (the fight between Mace et al and Palpatine) is completely different in the book than it is in the movie, so therefore that version of events isn't canon."

BioWare said that last year, they asked Disney if Star Wars: The Old Republic (which is ongoing) is canon. Disney didn't say ""no"", they just told BW ""You guys do a great job, keep doing that"".   So, (my prediction) there are chances that Disney (with some modifications to the story maybe) will make the Old Republic era canon. Also, the Old Republic story is set over 3000 years ago, so it will not contradict any of the movies in any way."

StarWarsEU,2wveu0,JediEnder,1 point,Mon Feb 23 19:50:12 2015 UTC,Form III is often devalued as it does not provide any means of offense. Zannah specialized in Soresu because it allowed her to stall her opponents indefinitely in order to defeat them with her psychological force powers.
StarWarsEU,2wveu0,Liamisaspy,4,Fri Mar 6 02:26:28 2015 UTC,"The most well known users don't seem to have any style that necessarily favors a DBL.  Darth Zannah used Soresu, Exar Kun used Niman, and Darth Maul primarily used Juyo. It seems any style could be adapted to the DBL but if you're looking for a good lore-based justification Niman is traditionally the most flexible style since it allows for a lot of individual creativity and I imagine it would be the easiest to adapt to a new kind of lightsaber."
StarWarsEU,2wveu0,Ritz527,2,Mon Feb 23 16:55:21 2015 UTC,"Because the movements are so different, there is not a traditional form for someone using a double bladed lightsaber.

StarWarsEU,2ws7z5,Tularemia,12,Sun Feb 22 18:53:34 2015 UTC,I like the X-wing books and the rogue squadron comics
StarWarsEU,2ws7z5,phantomcosmonauts,9,Sun Feb 22 20:44:15 2015 UTC,The Dark Empire series is ridiculous. It sort of just assumes the Empire doesn't suffer at all from the events of RotJ and is probably even more powerful at this point.  Additionally it makes the Emperor's power exponentially larger than it seemed to be in RotJ (force storms and force wormholes anyone?). Not to mention that Luke has about as much motivation as Anakin does to turn to the dark side when he did (don't hate me for not gushing over the RotS storyline).  BUT  I love the art in that comic series. It's some of my favorite art in any of the Star Wars comics.
StarWarsEU,2ws7z5,mnky9800n,5,Sun Feb 22 20:16:59 2015 UTC,"Exactly. It essentially negates everything the characters struggled to accomplish in the OT. While I sort of like the idea of Luke being this increasingly powerful loner post-RotJ, Luke's fall to the dark side is so abrupt and without motivation that it is just utterly baffling.   Also, World Devastators are lame. When characters have to explicitly say every 2 pages how big of a threat the supposed threat of the story is (I swear to god somebody said something to the effect of ""wow these are WAY more threatening than the Death Star"", a statement which is never actually confirmed by what is shown to us), that's just sloppy writing.  And I can't decide whether I love or hate the weird art style. It's certainly memorable."
StarWarsEU,2ws7z5,mnky9800n,5,Sun Feb 22 20:51:54 2015 UTC,"I really enjoyed the Nar Shadda visuals and the secret rebel base and all the various Star Destroyers.  Additionally I like that Han Solo knows people other than Lando and Chewie. Although I sort of wish that the EU recognizes that Han Solo goes from rogue to hero over the course of the original trilogy.  The EU treats Han as if he is this rogue smuggler with all these connections and whatever. Life doesn't work that way when you leave your connections and fight a war for five years. Everything changes and people think of you differently. I also found it rather transparent that Lando was in charge of ships that shield you from the sun while looking exactly like cloud city but whatever, Lando can do whatever he wants.  Ultimately this seems to happen to all of the characters except for Luke. Luke turns into this weird ""I'm not trying to be Obiwan"" character who manages to start a jedi academy and train hundreds of jedi while never being at the jedi academy because he is off adventuring even when he is in his 70s. Leia on the other hand manages to have babies, run a government into the ground, learn Jedi powers (or not depending on the book), all the while fighting off random people from trying to kidnap her children who just end up becoming a dark lord of the sith, dying when they are 16 (I'm pretty sure Anakin is 16 when this happens, also, why is it okay to send children to war Star Wars?), or going bad, going good, or just being completely PTSDed out (sorry Jaina, you had a rough time).  There are plenty of stories that are reasonable and plenty that are not. I like that the Thrawn trilogy recognizes that the Empire doesn't die completely but is weakened (both politically and militarily) by losing two Death Stars in a five year span. It sort of makes sense that they still are fighting but to stay in the game they have to be smart about it. Then KJandy comes along and says, ""lets have another death star plus some other crap."" Or the Hapans show up with giant fleets of Cylon battlecruisers and Klingon bird of preys and everyone is like ""yeah sorry we never mentioned this even though Hapes is twice as close to Coruscant as basically any place else we go in the movies"".  At least the Corporate Sector is super far away and so the Emperor never cares about them."

As other people said, the Bane books and Old Republic books might also work better for you. Path of Destruction is arguably the best single EU book. Deceived and Fatal Alliance were also enjoyable.  The former delved deeper into characters while the latter was a bit more shallow but had a lot more 'holy hell' moments."

I had the same issue initially; Vector Prime was my first stop after binge reading the Thrawn Trilogy and Duology and then Survivors Quest, and I really struggled.  After that however, it changes pace dramatically.  (Although, in subsequent re-readings, armed with the knowledge of what was being set up, I've come to regard VP as a pretty alright book.)  VP cops a lot more flak than it deserves I think, if only because people don't like what happened at Sernpidal (spoiler free for the OP please), but it is actually written quite well.  Also, reading the NJO is quite important in the scheme of things, and you get to experience what are some of the best books in the EU; The Enemy Lines books, parts of the Force Herteic novels and Traitor (which has grown on me massively in re-readings, despite parts of still seeming a little forced) are brilliant."

I rather dislike VP, and it's not because of Sernpidal (i actually thought that was a quite satisfying and fitting series of events). My problem with it was that it didn't feel like Star Wars. I don't know why exactly; maybe it was the dialogue, or the jarring characterization jump in Jacen and Anakin, or maybe just the way the book was put together, it just has an altogether oddness about it.  That said, it is a technically solid book, and pretty good, just such a jarring experience after the Bantam stuff."

That seems to be one of the most common niggles I see people talking about.  But what does Star Wars feel like?  For me, the Thrawn Trilogy comes the closest to the OT in terms of 'feel', but I can't say that Star Wars feels like that; Legacy Of The Force and Fate Of The Jedi are most certainly Star Wars, but they don't feel like any of the other series that I've read.   or the jarring characterization jump in Jacen and Anakin   This one wasn't an issue for me, as the only previous experience I'd ever had of the Solo kids was Jaina and Jacen as babies in the Thrawn Trilogy, and of the three together at the start of the Thrawn Duology.  I certainly get what you're saying though.   VP - and, by extension, the whole NJO - is just so utterly different to any other EU work that it is hard to adjust; I think that, if the first EU you were to read was NJO, apart from being confused, you'd have trouble adjusting to the shift in style if you were to then go and read Thrawn."

I think it's the very pinnacle of the EU. It is just specifically VP that I think feels off, and I'm fairly sure has to do with Salvatores writing style (which is not a knock against him; he is a very talented writer).

Ignoring Star Wars nostalgia, virtually any given best selling sci fi book will be better than 80-90% of the EU books (perhaps even 99% depending who you ask) If you liked Kotor, I think you'll enjoy the Darth Bane trilogy, they're the only books in virtually the entire EU that reflect KOTOR's awesomely dark side options (I will never forget the time I had ZaalBar kill Mission; wow) Given that Disney is soft-killing the EU, a lot of the benefits of of the earlier and later EU stories is gone (IMO Legacy of the Force sucks, and now it probably isn't even important, so why read it?). I still find many of the tight movie tie-ins very interesting, even if they will someday be invalidated. These include things like ""Death Star"" and the ""Tales From..."" collections (Tales From is edited and often written by Kevin J Anderson who can be a divisive figure here; but I love these stories, for example the Tales from Mos Eisley Cantina tells the story of virtually every alien you see around Luke and Ben in the bar and Tales from Jabba's Palace tells the sad but hilarious life story of the crying Rancor trainer)."

I loved the Thrawn series but that was back when it came out and I didn't think we'd see a Star Wars movie again.  I'm sure if I went back and read it now I'd struggle.  You have to set aside a lot of standards to enjoy it.  I gave up when I started to read Kevin J. Anderson's stuff.  Absolutely ruined the EU for me."

You didn't like the beginning of the only trilogy that I can recommend as being a worthy successor to the Star Wars of the 80s.

So my guess is that the ones without ball-turrets were being optimized for something other than close ground support."

StarWarsEU,2wp3d8,Charlemagne_III,1 point,Sun Feb 22 00:51:21 2015 UTC,"It was most likely just that it was cheaper to animate. The turrets probably added a ton of polys to the model for the Larty, making rendering them for the show take up both more modelers' time and computer time.  In-universe it could easily be justified that they didn't produce as much damage to the enemy as it was causing to the ships themselves when the turrets got frequently blown off."

My only complaint is a mild one ava I understand it, I just started Outcast yesterday (I know, I'm jumping around a lot) and he didn't put any effort into aging the characters out of their original voice as far as I could tell. 40 years worth of story, same 20 something voices. As I said, I understand it, you want the characters to be recognizable. That said, I also love the use of sound effects and music.

It increases the odds that everyone will like something.   Personally, I would have been more concerned if they were either (1) restarting the franchise with a movie solely focused on the original cast, or (2) rebooting entirely by retelling any of the original story-lines. Arguably, the new cast isn't YA material. Oscar Isaac is in his mid-30s and a really solid actor. John Boyega has some outstanding roles in his catalog. Daisy Ridley I'm not as sure about. The younger supporting actors like Driver and Gleason are also quite diverse. This isn't a pretty girl/pretty boy, angsty, romcom cast."

I'm sure there are only two explanations for the Episode VII spoilers (which make up a whole version of the movie distinct from EU lore just waiting for the video part — they are surprisingly detailed) — either the cat is out of the bag entirely or the whole Making Star Wars leak scene is a group delusion. Kinda like the Force.net virtual sequel thing. So I'm not convinced the spoilers are true, or that Rey is an alias, and I'm sure not convinced she's actually named Jaina.   On the other hand, we haven't heard anything at all about ST-era novels. Zip. Nada. Zilch. We have no idea what they're going to be like, and complaining about YA dystopia because girl characters is a bit premature. Remarkably so, compared to anything I said.   And I mean I can get annoyed that the words ""Katniss expy"" are being thrown around, because I mean by that logic Princess Leia is one? This isn't exactly a serious adult  literature kind of movie series.....   The point is, complaining about this is premature and silly. Especially since as much as I love all the Star Wars books, not a one of them are good. The YJK had the exact same plucky rebellious female archetypes OP thinks Star Wars is going to become.

I wouldn't call it the New Republic's hey day, there are a bunch of books that came out in the nineties that are better representations of that era. A good place to start would be the Thrawn trilogy, or try the X-Wing series which deals with the formation of the New Republic.  Judging by how you wrote, I'm assuming you're relatively young and got into Star Wars with the prequel trilogy (ep. I, II, and III) and preceded to read the novels of that era. Take a look at this subreddit's sidebar for reading guides and other info, that should set you on the right track.   The New Jedi Order series is great in my opinion, but there are others who absolutely hate it and pretend it never happened. You're already a few books in, so you should see it through to the end. The reason this series is so controversial is because of the massive changes it makes to the Star Wars expanded universe. I wouldn't recommend it as a starting point for that era, but you should be fine. Reading the books that came before will fill in a ton of information and a better understanding of the characters and events of the series, but it isn't necessary, the New Jedi Order series is perfectly enjoyable on its own.  Also, the Legacy of the Force series takes place after the series you're reading now, which (if you hadn't now noticed), is the New Jedi Order."
StarWarsEU,2weaci,Timballist0,2,Thu Feb 19 07:42:01 2015 UTC,It does pick up. I made several attempts to finish the series while in high school but got stuck in book 2. I finished it last summer and thought the later books were good.
StarWarsEU,2weaci,8amalarm,2,Thu Feb 19 16:08:38 2015 UTC,"It's been said a few times, but I can't stress The Thrawn Trilogy enough, it was my first foray into the EU and I didn't regret it.  It set me on fire wanting to know more.  If Zahn wrote it, it's good.  On that note, if you like audio books, if Marc Thompson reads it, it is also good."

StarWarsEU,2wcu0q,CT-1138,4,Wed Feb 18 21:27:32 2015 UTC,Lando has just gotten the Falcon. His opinion of it changes a lot over the course of the books. I loved Vuffi Ra and I keep hoping he'll show up in Rebels ( even though I know it's very unlikely). All in all I really enjoyed the series. I had a copy of Flamewind of Osean since I was a little boy and only finally read it as a teenager when I found Mindharp at a yard sale.
StarWarsEU,2wcu0q,countjared,3,Wed Feb 18 22:05:52 2015 UTC,It would be great to see Vuffi Raas history retold and reworked in Rebels!
StarWarsEU,2wcu0q,Its_NOT_Loose_dammit,6,Wed Feb 18 23:20:50 2015 UTC,loose the ship   Lose is the word you want.  : )
StarWarsEU,2wcu0q,pwn3r0fn00b5,4,Wed Feb 18 22:04:34 2015 UTC,Done. Thanks friend.
StarWarsEU,2wcu0q,pwn3r0fn00b5,3,Wed Feb 18 23:18:43 2015 UTC,"The second book of the Han Solo Trilogy (Trilogy, not Adventures) explains why Lando isn't a pilot at the time. Vuffi Raa also makes an appearance.  Lando is fond of the Falcon but is used to some of the finer things in life that the Falcon doesn't provide.   Lando loses the Falcon to Han at the beginning of the third Han Solo Trilogy book. All three Han Solo adventures take place during a gap in the story."
StarWarsEU,2wcu0q,Liquid_Senjutsu,2,Thu Feb 19 02:39:17 2015 UTC,So the first two Han Solo Trilogy books would take place around the same time as Lando Calrissian Adventures?

Coupled with his aggressive Form V Djem So style, he would hardly have to worry about being on a defensive front.  I think Bane would quickly overwhelm any opponent who faced him in light saber combat alone."

StarWarsEU,2w9vd1,itsbaaad,5,Wed Feb 18 15:44:54 2015 UTC,I seriously couldn't put that book down. Shits too epic.
StarWarsEU,2w9vd1,Chocolate_Charizard,2,Wed Feb 18 16:29:37 2015 UTC,I just ordered the second in the series on Amazon and am eagerly awaiting its arrival.
StarWarsEU,2w9vd1,itsbaaad,2,Wed Feb 18 17:16:22 2015 UTC,"While the whole series is good, none of them touch the first book in its epicness. But that's just my humble opinion, I suppose.   That said... the fight discussed above IS one of my favorite fights in Star Wars lore and happens at the end of the second book."
StarWarsEU,2w9vd1,XAce90,1 point,Wed Feb 18 20:37:05 2015 UTC,"The fight discussed above is at the end of Path of Destruction, not the second book of the series, unless there's a different ancient temple on an unknown planet destroyed at the end of the second. (I haven't read it yet.)  I think what makes the first book so good is that Bane goes from a fairly caring individual who just had a rough life, to a totally uncompromising monster to anyone who stands in his way.  The people who helped him the most in the first book he barely bats an eyelash at when they perish under his own blade or from his own devices.   He really is the embodiment of the Dark Side when it comes to using attrition, cunning, deception and the likes to further his means.    He single handily helped to bring the galaxy to a momentary peace for no other reason than to further his own power and enact his own Sith philosophy over the current.  Putting aside a war against your most hated enemy to wipe out your own faction lose so you may rebuild it in a way of your choosing is hard-fucking-core."

(I haven't read it yet.)   Sorry, misunderstanding! The fight where he levels a temple in Path of Destruction is epic, yes, but the fight I'm thinking of is at the end of the sequel. It's him vs like 6 Jedi. Freakin awesome. I thought that was in a temple somewhere too but maybe not."
StarWarsEU,2w9vd1,XAce90,1 point,Thu Feb 19 18:53:00 2015 UTC,Now you've got me even more eager to start the second novel of the trilogy!  Pay day can't come soon enough for me...  Bane is easily my favorite Sith Lord now.
StarWarsEU,2w9vd1,itsbaaad,13,Thu Feb 19 20:26:41 2015 UTC,"If, as you say, you exclude Luke - bearing in mind my lack of knowledge on pre-ROTJ EU, and that this is purely an EU list - my top list, in some semblance of order, is as follows:  1) Darth Caedus  2) Kyp Durron  3) Corran Horn/Kyle Katarn/Jaina Solo/Saba Sebatyne  4) Ben Skywalker/Vestara Khai/Tahiri Veila/Mara Jade  Some of the other Sith introduced in Fate Of The Jedi could well be up there - I don't believe we ever had their Grand Lord using a lightsaber - but, for the most part, they got taken apart in every encounter with Jedi.  Some justification:  Caedus was awfully sure of his ability:   All that mattered was that Luke was here, somehow, and that he was the one swordsman in the galaxy whom Caedus did not dare fight one-armed.   And the fight he put up in Legacy Of The Force - Invincible - as well as the duel with Luke in Inferno and the fight with Katarn in Fury(?) - shows that it most certainly wasn't self-delusion.    It was Kyp that Luke chose to accompany him in their attempted boarding of the Anakin Solo in LOTF - Fury(?), and this endorsment, coupled with what already knew about Kyp's skills, is the sole reason for his high placing.    On some of those that I couldn't properly separate:  The badassery Jaina unleashed on the Sith in the last two FOTJ books are, for my mind, a much better illustration of her ability than her duels in Invincible, so I would probably err on the side of placing her above Corran, Kyle and Saba.  The implied intertwined-destiny of Ben and Vestara - coupled with the vision of the Masters in Apocalypse - suggests they are very much equal.  At the peak of her powers - the brutality of her fight in Sacrifice was beautiful - I would place Mara at least on par with Jaina at her peak - Apocalypse - but, on average, I rank her as less skilled than either Corran, Kyle or Saba.  Tahiri is a tricky one; her hybrid personality gives her a distinct, if not automatically advantageous, combat style and she proved quite capable in fighting alongside Saba in the Temple in Apocalypse but, other than that, there isn't a great deal of information to go on in regards to her lightsaber skill."
StarWarsEU,2w9vd1,AUS_Doug,2,Wed Feb 18 10:23:22 2015 UTC,"Caedus is probably a good choice even if you consider the entirety of the EU. Luke is pretty well accepted as the best of the best and Caedus managed to severely injure him in their duel, giving tit for tat, before Ben stabbed him. Even taking into consideration Luke's emotional state that is no mean feat."
StarWarsEU,2w9vd1,Ritz527,1 point,Mon Feb 23 17:44:16 2015 UTC,"Caedus is probably a good choice even if you consider the entirety of the EU.   Someday I plan on getting around to reading about Revan and Bane and the rest of the big names, if only for help with lists and questions like this.   Even taking into consideration Luke's emotional state that is no mean feat.   Absolutely; Perhaps more than anything else, it was that duel that best illustrates that Caedus wasn't fooling himself about how good he was."
StarWarsEU,2w9vd1,AUS_Doug,8,Mon Feb 23 21:48:59 2015 UTC,"the novelization of episode 2 states that Dooku was a bad-ass duelist, at a time when Jedi didn't focus on dueling. which is probably why he was able to own Obi and Ani, and do well against Yoda."
StarWarsEU,2w9vd1,BentronZero,4,Wed Feb 18 06:28:26 2015 UTC,"That said, in the novelization of episode 3, he was completely outclassed by both Obi-Wan and Anakin separately, and he caught Obi-Wan offguard only with a extremely powerful telekinetic attack. He was losing the duel, even when he didn't have to focus on both simultaneously."
StarWarsEU,2w9vd1,mr-doc-prof-zark,5,Wed Feb 18 13:48:00 2015 UTC,"He was double teamed by one of the finest swordsman the Order ever produced and the Chosen One, and he was well beyond his prime. It's also worth noting that Dooku's classical Makashi was never designed to counter Anakin's aggressive, modern Djem So, which generated far more kinetic energy and easily broke his guard. But he still held them at bay and would have defeated them if not for Anakin tapping into dark side abilities - the battle was eventually decided not by dueling abilities but by Anakin's insanely powerful mastery of the Force."
StarWarsEU,2w9vd1,CaptainLepidus,2,Wed Feb 18 16:05:39 2015 UTC,"That's true to a point I think, I'm not saying that Dooku wasn't one of the greatest duelists of that age, I'm simply pointing out that as time progressed and as both Obi-Wan and Anakin prepared for that encounter, the odds definitely tipped. As for saying he would have defeated them, I disagree. While I'm admittedly a bit of an Obi-Wan fanboy, I'd say the absolute mastery of Soresu that he displayed throughout that novelization would be able to handle even Dooku's perfected Makashi. Again, the only reason Obi-Wan was knocked out of that fight was the overwhelming strength of Dooku's telekinetic attack, and that has no bearing (in my mind) on a discussion of dueling skill. That said, any and all of this is highly speculative, and I certainly would never say that Dooku couldn't possibly beat Obi-Wan, as he'd clearly done so before."
StarWarsEU,2w9vd1,mr-doc-prof-zark,2,Wed Feb 18 17:15:20 2015 UTC,"The problem with Soresu is that it's an inherently defensive form, designed for fighting multiple ranged opponents rather than enemy duelists. Both of Obi-Wan's great dueling victories were a result of his defensive abilities - Grievous died because Obi-Wan wore him out and disarmed him with a protracted chase, and Anakin's loss was due to a tactical advantage that gave Obi-Wan a more defensible position. (Obi-Wan's killing move against Maul was very much an Ataru style attack, which Obi-Wan doubtless favored in his younger days.)  The thing is, in the throne room on the Invisible Hand, there wasn't any deadly terrain or external advantages like a blaster - it was just three saberists pitting their swordsmanship against each other. Had Anakin not been present, I feel sure Dooku would have outclassed Obi-Wan, with or without telekinesis.  That said, this is all indeed speculative. One of Obi-Wan's greatest strengths was his partnership with Anakin, and vice-versa...and as Anakin pointed out somewhat ruefully in the actual scene, they'd learned their lesson about taking on Dooku individually the hard way."
StarWarsEU,2w9vd1,CaptainLepidus,2,Wed Feb 18 20:04:30 2015 UTC,"Interesting points, fun discussion. Let's do it again sometime."

StarWarsEU,2w9vd1,CaptainLepidus,2,Wed Feb 18 21:08:27 2015 UTC,I think Dooku is such an underrated character/Sith. I believe he could easily best Maul.
StarWarsEU,2w9vd1,LaserQuest,7,Wed Feb 18 15:42:24 2015 UTC,"Excluding Palpatine and Luke Skywalker.  Exar Kun is up there with the great masters of all time. Malgus isn't too shabby himself, he was probably superior to most other sith lords with the exception of MAYBE vititate. As for Jedis....hmm...Mace Windu was also probably one of the greatest swordsman of his era. Equal to Palpatine but overshadowed by Yoda. Mace could probably defeat most jedi/sith of previous and future eras save for a VERY small few.  For siths I would say Exar Kun and or Malgus. For jedis I would say Mace Windu and Yoda."

StarWarsEU,2w9vd1,Not-Stephen-Colbert,4,Wed Feb 18 06:19:55 2015 UTC,How has Mace not been mentioned yet? He took Palpatine apart. The only reason he didn't walk away was because he wasn't prepared for Anakin's betrayal. Vaapaad FTW
StarWarsEU,2w9vd1,Icancloseit,3,Wed Feb 18 20:10:20 2015 UTC,"The most common Jedi I've seen mentioned as undeniable master swordsmen are Yoda, Dooku and Windu. You could maybe argue adding Kenobi as well, since his Soresu mastery was eventually so badass that he could have possibly defended himself endlessly against the three mentioned.  Sith side I'm guessing armored-Bane, Plagueis and Sheevy-P. Bane was nearly invincible in the Orbalisks, Plagueis was declared a master of the art by Darth Tenebrous, and Palpatine made a complete mockery of 3 out of the 4 master Jedi sent to arrest him, then held his own against Windu, then held his own against Yoda.  I just convinced myself the answer is probably Palpatine.  edit - Luminara was also considered extremely proficient if I'm not mistaken"

Although... I'd still not want to face him!   I just convinced myself the answer is probably Palpatine.   Didn't Windu technically win that duel? It was only Anakin's intervention that saved Palpatine."
StarWarsEU,2w9vd1,XAce90,1 point,Wed Feb 18 20:43:36 2015 UTC,You know I still really don't know how that was supposed to be viewed. I thought P threw the duel to bait Anakin. Those movies are terrible.

StarWarsEU,2w9vd1,NoRaSu,4,Wed Feb 18 04:45:45 2015 UTC,I think it'd be hard to justify putting Revan over someone like Mace who's a master of all 7 forms and the definitive master of Juyo.

StarWarsEU,2w9vd1,Not-Stephen-Colbert,2,Wed Feb 18 04:28:06 2015 UTC,"Obi-Wan is probably THE master of Soresu and an incredibly skilled duelist because of it. In the RotS novel the entirety of the council, Yoda and Windu included, believe him to be the most skilled wielder of Soresu in the Order and that he would be perfect so subdue Grevious and his incredible 4-sword offense. Unfortunately this does not make him the best duelist of all time. Many others used multiple styles proficiently and could switch in and out of them as they chose."
StarWarsEU,2w9vd1,Ritz527,1 point,Mon Feb 23 17:23:08 2015 UTC,No love for General Grevious?
StarWarsEU,2w9vd1,Chocolate_Charizard,1 point,Thu Feb 19 00:33:02 2015 UTC,I feel like you should exclude Sidious too. He's pretty much the Dark-Side equivalent of Luke when it comes to being unrivaled in everything.  Lots of folks say Bane and Bane was certainly ferocious but considering his style I think someone like Obi-Wan could beat him in saber combat. It's a bit of rock-paper-scissors sometimes; Bane is a great duelist but not the most flexible. Caedus was second in his era only to Luke Skywalker and could have equaled him given enough time as seen in his duel with Luke where he managed to injure Luke about as much as Luke did to him. If we then consider Luke to be the top of the class in saber combat then it stands to reason that Caedus would be salutatorian.
StarWarsEU,2w9vd1,Ritz527,1 point,Mon Feb 23 17:41:12 2015 UTC,"I like Makashi because it is focused on dueling and outmaneuvering your opponent. Count Dooku used this style very proficiently, and I would rank him ad one of the best duelists of all time, being on par with Mace Windu and above all other Jedi at the time, often taking on multiple powerful and physically stronger opponents at the same time, such as Anakin and Obi-wan, and Ventress and Oppress.  It is hard to say between eras who is the best duelist, although generally the best guy at the time is about as good as the best guy at any other time."

StarWarsEU,2vscrn,namer98,23,Fri Feb 13 17:58:25 2015 UTC,"An ""aggressive"" DLC plan doesn't sound too good. I'll hope for the best, but I'm already a little nervous."
StarWarsEU,2vscrn,pod476,8,Fri Feb 13 23:20:50 2015 UTC,"Seriously, why is that considered a good thing... Going to have to wait it out like the Battle field games to drop in price. I'm not paying $60, then $10 every two or three months so I can actually join servers."
StarWarsEU,2vscrn,element515,1 point,Sat Feb 14 05:31:34 2015 UTC,"I understand that dlcs bear a negative connotation, particularly with EA. However, the concept of having sweet battlefront addons to a game is awesome, provided they don't cost. Which they probably will, but a fan can hope, right? Right??"
StarWarsEU,2vscrn,timscheller95,4,Sat Feb 14 20:28:32 2015 UTC,"DLCs were awesome when they first started doing it. I think with forza 2 it was sometime later and T10 got some new licenses to make cars. That was great! Similar to how Assetto Corsa works now, they are constantly working to get new licenses and even asked the community to vote for their most preferred companies.   It's understandable when it was clearly stuff you worked on that couldn't make release... but DLC a month later? Or even less, that's what I hate. Stupid to withhold stuff just to make more money."
StarWarsEU,2vscrn,element515,1 point,Sat Feb 14 20:35:32 2015 UTC,"I agree. It's annoying. But I guess that's a self-interest driven gaming economy, isn't it :("
StarWarsEU,2vscrn,timscheller95,1 point,Sat Feb 14 20:44:41 2015 UTC,"Smack Where are your balls, bro? Did EA chop them off and sell them back to you as DLC?! We have to show them that we as customers won't tolerate it. We have to show EA that we know their reputation, and will not allow them to gut their games and sell us piecemeal that which was once considered an integral part of a fully developed product.   If you want to stop greedy practices, you have to not give in to their artificial hype. If they want to sell us DLC, we have to make them work for it, and not just fork over money for content that should have shipped with the game."
StarWarsEU,2vscrn,Mythosaurus,2,Sun Feb 15 05:36:07 2015 UTC,"Usually I find rants about EA redundant but that was brilliant. EA SMACKS my balls off. Not chop, smack. That's next level."
StarWarsEU,2vscrn,timscheller95,1 point,Sun Feb 15 05:44:44 2015 UTC,"I don't know, I try to be rational about this. What if their budget doesn't cover the DLC? Maybe it's naive of me to think that way. If I feel the base game is good enough to warrant the price then I'm good. Or else you get caught up in the rhetoric that if there's early DLC then you've automatically been ripped off, no matter how much content is in the base game.  Now when it comes to maps I agree, I hate when the community becomes fragmented. Maybe there could be a compromise, like have the maps become free after a few months. Or when the next pack releases, like they used to do for Halo 3."
StarWarsEU,2vscrn,youguysgonnamakeout,2,Mon Feb 16 23:51:29 2015 UTC,"Maybe I'm missing something, but if their budget didn't cover dlc, then how are they making it?   I would think that in that case, they need to wait for release to make more money and then work on the dlc."
StarWarsEU,2vscrn,element515,1 point,Mon Feb 16 23:56:17 2015 UTC,"I mean like if they have a budget for the main game, then a budget for DLC."
StarWarsEU,2vscrn,youguysgonnamakeout,19,Tue Feb 17 00:14:32 2015 UTC,including the Revenge of the Sith opening battle.
StarWarsEU,2vscrn,rex_dart_eskimo_spy,3,Sat Feb 14 01:37:52 2015 UTC,some game modes will feature space-to-land battles
StarWarsEU,2vscrn,youguysgonnamakeout,7,Mon Feb 16 23:55:17 2015 UTC,All Aboard!!
StarWarsEU,2vscrn,StillBurningInside,3,Fri Feb 13 22:27:17 2015 UTC,EA... its in the Patch !
StarWarsEU,2vscrn,the_onion_night,4,Sat Feb 14 13:41:09 2015 UTC,I'm not fucking around when I say I might be more pumped for this then Episode VII.
StarWarsEU,2vscrn,JediEnder,2,Fri Feb 13 22:15:12 2015 UTC,it would be nice if they did the dlc like ME3. where the multiplayer dlc stuff is free and you have to pay for single player story type dlc i would not mind something like that not including the premium packs and stuff
StarWarsEU,2vscrn,Unwanted_Commentary,3,Sun Feb 15 07:52:35 2015 UTC,"Woo, heroes!  /r/StarWarsBattlefront"

StarWarsEU,2vr942,JordanBlythe,8,Fri Feb 13 15:20:26 2015 UTC,"Well, I'm celebrating Valentines day with my girlfriend. My Rebel Transport miniature will be delivered by around 3pm so my girlfriend and I are going to the local game shop to play some X-Wing miniatures and then I'll make dinner at home later in the evening (Totally not kosher pan seared pork loin that I'll finish up in the oven, will be great). Picking up some sparkling grape juice at the store on my way home from the office and we're going to eat dinner and cuddle while watching Parenthood on netflix BECAUSE THAT'S A PERFECT VALENTINES DAY, DANG IT.  I also get off at 1pm today instead of 5. It's a good day.   HOW ARE YOU DOING, JEW MAN?"

StarWarsEU,2vr942,Naryn_Tin-Ahhe,1 point,Fri Feb 13 17:59:20 2015 UTC,What's the setup/break down like for this game? i.e. open the box and start playing takes how long? It looks like a hassle.
StarWarsEU,2vr942,pjlovesauce,2,Fri Feb 13 19:32:57 2015 UTC,"Open the box, read instructions, can play out of the box.  It's very much not a hassle.  Starter has two TIE fighters and an Xwing, there are expansions available and recommended with other ships.  /r/xwingtmg is a good resource for getting started if you're interested."
StarWarsEU,2vr942,chucklenut33,1 point,Sat Feb 14 00:13:03 2015 UTC,Cool. All the playthrus have everything unboxed. For display I guess. It is cool to look at.

StarWarsEU,2vr942,optimal_primate,2,Fri Feb 13 15:31:52 2015 UTC,"I'm working on the next chapter of my Star Wars Saga Edition game. Characters think they're going into an all-out battle with a Rakata that's been possessed by a Sith Lord but he actually just wants to steal their ship and get off planet. Not sure if he'll stowaway and surprise them in hyperspace, if they'll intercept him along the way, or if they'll completely ignore him and allow a greater threat to develop from his escape. I like all the possibilities here."
StarWarsEU,2vr942,JordanBlythe,2,Fri Feb 13 16:00:02 2015 UTC,"Slow day at work, so I'll be finishing Darth Plagueis.  Probably hit up a Chapters after to buy a new novel.  Any recommendations?"

StarWarsEU,2vr942,Cern_Stormrunner,1 point,Fri Feb 13 17:24:26 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty new to the EU, so I've only read the Bane trilogy and now Darth Plagueis.  I have to admit, although the Bane books were amazing, I enjoyed Plagueis a bit more.  The politics, scheming, and story line really provided some history into the Trade Federation and Palpatines rise to power. I found it really tied together the events of Episodes 1-3.    I just looked it up, and I think I'll give Tarkin a read.  I always thought Tarkin was a bad-ass character that didn't get enough screen time.  I mean jeez, even Vader had mad respect for him in Episode IV."
StarWarsEU,2vr942,AmunRa666,1 point,Fri Feb 13 17:52:27 2015 UTC,I think you will enjoy Tarkin.

StarWarsEU,2vrp2k,roninjedi,1 point,Fri Feb 13 18:57:51 2015 UTC,There are much better comics to spend your money on.
StarWarsEU,2vrp2k,namer98,1 point,Fri Feb 13 18:30:05 2015 UTC,they are a interesting story but the art is terrible. I only read it once to get the storyline but its not like the KOTOR or Tales of the Jedi comics that i read once or twice a year.   EDIT: The KOTOR comics cover the KOTOR timeline but they are not about revan. The are about an even cooler jedi named Zayne Carrick. Cooler because anyone can be a kickass force user but not many can be a kickass force user when their force powers are more likely to backfire on them.
StarWarsEU,2vsdy2,jethroboom,2,Fri Feb 13 18:07:13 2015 UTC,"If I remember Wookiepedia correctly, Moffs were military governors, meaning they were the head of both the military and political spheres of their sectors. Palpitine did this to give them some autonomy to deal with rebellions that cropped up."
