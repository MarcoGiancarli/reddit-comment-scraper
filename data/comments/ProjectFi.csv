ProjectFi,3e4gdx,raffikki,2,Tue Jul 21 21:51:08 2015 UTC,"I've connected to a few open networks when it didn't auto connect, used it.. later removed it and when I went back it auto connected with wifi assistant. The problem is your connection would have to be open to everyone, not just Fi customers."
ProjectFi,3e4gdx,pilotm,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:11:09 2015 UTC,You could always enable a guest network. Most access points and routers come with that feature. It will isolate your home network and allow others to access the internet.
ProjectFi,3e4gdx,badlo,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:22:13 2015 UTC,"As long as it is just plain open (no login) it might become one.  But you won't be able to discriminate.... anyone will be able to join.  I don't think Google's hotspot testing or system is all that complex.   I suspect if a few ProjectFi folk join it, and google finds it works.... it will just becomes one automatically."
ProjectFi,3e4pud,MidnightHost,2,Tue Jul 21 23:00:57 2015 UTC,I didn't have this issue porting over from Verizon (I did the trial run as well). You just have to enter the account passcode or pin (not website password).
ProjectFi,3e4pud,pilotm,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:16:45 2015 UTC,"Yes, the passcode not the site password. I even called Verizon yesterday and changed it to something simple. Still didn't work. Strange it just happened to me. Maybe just an isolated incident but I thought I'd put it out there."

I can't find the post, but I believe /u/dmziggy said the team is working on it.  I do a lot of work through email, so I usually just have the site send me an email instead of a text. I think the issue is server-side, something to do with the way your number is stored for Fi and how the website sending the code sees your number."
ProjectFi,3e1d77,mechgingeneer,0,Tue Jul 21 11:42:18 2015 UTC,Yeah I've heard of something like this before...
ProjectFi,3e1d77,dmziggy,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:51:20 2015 UTC,Hopefully this is resolved soon. Unfortunately SMS is the only way to receive 2fa codes from some websites.  The google voice support page link in the OP says that some sites send SMS via email but voice doesn't support that. I am guessing Fi has the same issue?
ProjectFi,3e1d77,dmziggy,0,Tue Jul 21 18:43:26 2015 UTC,Sounds right but I don't have official confirmation yet.
ProjectFi,3e1d77,notajith,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:47:50 2015 UTC,I have a similar problem with my Sendhub number.  They say they block incoming SMS from shortcodes or something to prevent spam.  Among the reasons I'm reluctant to join Fi.  Specially I was not able to receive the 2 factor codes from my bank.
ProjectFi,3e1d77,mechgingeneer,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:12:44 2015 UTC,does your bank allow you to change the method you use for the short codes? Like calling or emailing instead of texts?
ProjectFi,3e1d77,psidancer,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:00:34 2015 UTC,"Damn, wish I'd known about this sooner. Might have changed my mind about joining so soon. I just received a text from 4 different automated SMS services (Sonic, Southwest Airlines, Red Box, and USPS) telling me I had been unsubscribed, which all came in one right after the other. But doesn't the fact I just received them imply I am getting texts from automated short codes?"
ProjectFi,3e1d77,neiled,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:07:59 2015 UTC,Hmm I use quite a lot of 2 factor auth sites and they've all come to me ok.

Quick check of hangouts to confirm they're not in there?

ProjectFi,3e1e3p,laszlof,7,Tue Jul 21 05:59:59 2015 UTC,Why would you use a beta service if its that important to you?
ProjectFi,3e1e3p,oridjinn,3,Tue Jul 21 11:17:36 2015 UTC,"I still have my AT&T phone, so I'm not going into this naked.  I figured with all the traveling I do I'd be able to help with the data collection."
ProjectFi,3e1e3p,dmziggy,2,Tue Jul 21 13:26:17 2015 UTC,I have had both a Sprint phone and a T-mobile phone with me at the same time as my Project Fi phone.    Just a nice coincidence. I had all 3 on me for a month.    the t-mobile S6 pretty much had perfect connection all of the time. The Sprint S3 almost never had a good connection and was often without a connection at all. The Project Fi Nexus was random. at times it had a great connection. But at other times when both spring and t-mobile had good connections Project Fi had none.    Beta is beta. But there is my experience so far.    the past 2 weeks have been much better with Fi than my first month. Still spotty however.    My pure T-mobile phone does MUCH better.    Oh i should say. The Sprint was Virgin Mobile and Tmobile phone was standard t-mobile. Not pre-paid.
ProjectFi,3e1e3p,nofxjmf,2,Tue Jul 21 15:22:02 2015 UTC,I highly suggest if you're having service issues that you talk to Project Fi support.  I would note locations as well of service issues.
ProjectFi,3e1e3p,c4v3man,2,Tue Jul 21 15:29:06 2015 UTC,I am usually in Westchester but work in Manhattan as well as went to the Poconos recently on vacation. I have had my FI and Verizon phone with me in all places and mostly had similar connection. I can't recall a spot I had no connection on Fi yet other then a very small period on the train here and their. And it is actually much better then Verizon for me on the train.   I have not tested the bronx yet even though that is my original hometown ;p. Anyway service has been great for me in NY the place I have been and I have already dropped Verizon. Been on it about a month so far.

ProjectFi,3e1e3p,Brandoskey,3,Tue Jul 21 17:24:01 2015 UTC,"My first few days came with some issues, but after 3 or 4 days, they seemed to have resolved themselves. Makes me think that the issue wasn't my device, but Sprint/T-mo's databases and towers figuring out how to handle my phone.  Here's a couple questions that may help us help you:  (1) When you go into the Fi app, is there a ""complete activation"" card as soon as you log in? Fi will activate your service, but to give you the ""best connection"" you have to go into the app and tell it to finish activation when you've got a couple of minutes. My service was massively improved afterwards.  (2) What build of Lollipop are you on? The latest Fi build is version 5.1.1, build LYZ28E (you can find this in Settings>About phone>Build number)  (3) What service provider did you come from, or did you have a new number assigned? And was was this a N6 purchased through Project Fi or somewhere else?  I've had a few dropped calls, sure, but in many areas, I pick up VZW's roaming network (due to Sprint's agreements) so I really haven't had too many signal issues. I live in the rural midwest.  There's loads of us here willing to help with any issues we can - Fi is a Beta service, but that's the nature of cutting-edge technology. As I said, I've got no complaints!  Also, just joking here, but   because NYC summer suck   I'm sure they're not pleasant, but if you'd like to experience the Ohio river valley this time of year, soak a t-shirt in water and wrap it around your face to breathe through ;)"
ProjectFi,3e1e3p,mechgingeneer,4,Tue Jul 21 11:55:48 2015 UTC,"LVY48C is the latest fi build. The e build is a general nexus build. I keep seeing this getting confused.   It really doesn't matter that much, the official fi build is said to have very few fi specific tweaks."

I got some bizzare black box ussda code looking pop up with a Yes or No box, I tapped yes, it tried to connect to sprint's sim something or another and crapped out, chrome never made it. Heh. right after it was hopping from schools WI fi to LTE ect after I rebooted it. (mind ya a factory reset it before activating Fi so it was a F i thing) It took the ride home from milwaukee to Grafton pretty well (70mph speed limit)hopping around services.  voice is at best shitty.

Just talked to support 30mins ago. They are still sending out the kits, but aren't giving a time frame on when they will have them to you. Some people get them with their order, some don't get them for another month. The rep I spoke to individually processed a request for me to get one, since I hadn't received one after a week of waiting. Still don't have an ETA, but I know I'm on the list now.  It seems like they ship them in batches, which would explain the odd timing for different groups of people.

So, does that mean any WiFi that has any sort of blocker, such as my work WiFi where they try to block you from browsing so you actually have to work, would automatically be opened up completely?   Project Fi has its own list of ""trusted"" networks that Project Fi will automatically connect to. This is completely separate from your phone's ""remembered"" networks. In my experience, the Project Fi VPN is only utilized on those networks that Project Fi (not your phone) automatically connects to. So I doubt the Project Fi VPN would be utilized on your work's WiFi.   Sidenote: Often, employers who do filtering will block VPN traffic, but I have no way of confirming that for your work's WiFi."

It seems as though Fi is being given leftover N6 models from Google Store's stock, and once they're gone, they're gone. Last I checked, Google Store & Amazon both had 64GB variants available, and either of those will work fine provided they're the XT1103 model.  It's likely that no more 64GB N6's will be distributed through Fi if they support the new Nexus coming in Oct/Nov."

If you text and call via the mobile network, none of this is reflected in your data allowance since these are, you know, normal things all cell networks do. They're carrier functions. If your phone is connected to Wi-Fi, that's what it will use to access the internet just like every other smartphone in existence. However, if there is a usable cell signal, and you aren't in airplane mode, and you don't use the Hangouts dialer, your phone WILL prefer the mobile network to make calls."
ProjectFi,3dy3tb,dmziggy,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:55:42 2015 UTC,Wow so FI is broken right now basically? I thought I was WiFi calling/texting.  Psh
ProjectFi,3dy3tb,Solex159,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:05:44 2015 UTC,"No, it's not broken at all. The point of Project Fi is to give you two mobile networks to use, and when you're not in range of either of them you can make calls and send messages over your run-of-the-mill internet connection. If the cell network aspect wasn't there, what would be the point of having a smartphone to use the service?  /u/dmziggy am I wrong here?"
ProjectFi,3dy3tb,Solex159,2,Tue Jul 21 15:12:04 2015 UTC,"Fi isn't broken.  All the parts work except for the few known issues. In terms of calling, everything works.  Just when it's being used is going to be changing.  What do I mean?  Using WiFi for calls will be more in the future than it currently is.  There are big plans to make WiFi calling happen smarter. Also, once the transfer from WiFi to cell calls is smooth (and vice versa), you'll see more calls start on one and switch.  You may also see more features coming to WiFi calling, such as HD voice, etc.  So, yes you can call and text over WiFi.  Yes, you can connect to two cell networks.  Everything works.  The smoothness of the transition is what us being worked on, and so you won't see WiFi to cell and back right now. But you will in the near future."
ProjectFi,3dy3tb,dmziggy,2,Tue Jul 21 15:22:22 2015 UTC,To clarify further - it's not broken.  It's just not fully turned on yet.
ProjectFi,3dy3tb,hitideblastoise,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:25:42 2015 UTC,I was under the impression the fi is encouraging saving data by using WiFi as much as possible and only using the cell networks as backup. You only pay for mobile data you use. This helps people save money specifically by encouraging people to use WiFi. Pulling people away from the unrealistic expectation of unlimited mobile data forever or even 5-10gb

I have opened countless tickets and support has told me to just keep sending it in. Ive grown tired of wasting data sending it to them (if not connected to WiFi) and the fact that nothing gets done that I can see (it keeps happening in the same locations day after day).   I know its a beta program, but when you're talking to the CEO of a multi-million dollar company and each time the call disconnects because of Sprint (took me a while to think about putting it into airplane mode so I could just use WiFi calling) it starts to lose its fanciness.

ProjectFi,3dunf4,im4degreesaboveu,4,Sun Jul 19 17:20:46 2015 UTC,I wouldn't worry about it.  The phone has excellent specs so unlike a budget phone it will still be very usable two years down the road.  Plus the price has come down on the N6.  So compared to the upcoming Nexus you could probably pay it off sooner if you wanted to.
ProjectFi,3dunf4,Hank_the_opossum,3,Sun Jul 19 17:52:52 2015 UTC,"For what it's worth, I had my Nexus 4 for two years before getting the 6 and I still think that is very usable. With the 64gb N6, I don't see a problem upgrading in two years to (hopefully) a better selection of Fi-compatible phones. Obviously you're aware of the drawbacks, but the biggest benefit is that yes, it has been out for a year. This means that issues and problems with the phone are well known, easy to troubleshoot and finding a solution isn't so hard. Me? I'm not worried at all."

However - as far as I know - you can't make 'extra' payments. It's either keep pay 20 bucks a month OR pay off the entire remaining balance.

ProjectFi,3dqwde,OPCunningham,4,Sat Jul 18 16:17:26 2015 UTC,T-Mobile has varying spectrum holdings. In some markets they have more spectrum allocated for legacy HSPA+ than LTE. Slow downlink and fast uplink is a typical sign of congestion. There are simply too many LTE phones in your area. You can see (on the maps or lookup) T-Mobile spectrum holdings on my site. Your LTE allocation most likely is estimated on the first map. T-Mobile is planning to reduce the spectrum allocated to HSPA+ in many markets this year and LTE spectrum will increase by 5 MHz (second or third map).  I believe Project Fi should profile your area over time to figure out what network is the fastest. Meanwhile you can also force switch to Sprint.
ProjectFi,3dqwde,danrant,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:49:28 2015 UTC,"First map shows green, second map shows red. The lookup says 30mhz available in my area. I think they rolled out HSPA+ here about 7 years ago, give or take, it was right after I switched to Verizon."

ProjectFi,3dr424,wekebu,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:30:36 2015 UTC,"Yea, happens all the time with my employer. When someone activates a new number, residential or business, often times it is one that was used by someone before, and collections agencies never give up, so they'd often immediately start getting someone's collection calls.  The other big culprit was that a residential phone activation is public record, even when the number is not listed, so often times you may get cold calls from services related to the home, such as refinancing, home security, etc because they assume if you activated a number for your home, you just moved in.  Any time I ever got a call from someone with these complaints, is always offer to change their number at no charge, but make them aware it might happen with they next number as well."

Speeds are already capped on VZW's StraightTalk network (the CDMA one in the new activation kits), but if you use too much they'll throttle you for the rest of the month to 64kbps (dial-up)  2) VZW has the worst 3G speeds in the nation. sauce - is there any way you could make do with AT&T or T-mo in your area?  3) ST customer support is the worst thing I've ever had to deal with. It took me a month to activate my phone on their CDMA network because they kept sending me the wrong SIM card after the one I purchased in the activation kit wouldn't work. Just beware - it's a crapshoot.  The service on ST's CDMA network was fantastic, and the ""hi-speed"" 5 MBps on LTE was plenty fast enough, but there were a lot of headaches to get it going.  EDIT: that said, I'm loving Project Fi (even if I have weaker signal in some areas). I agree with the others though, it's really not cost-effective for the high-data users."
ProjectFi,3dsx7s,heyliberty,-1,Mon Jul 20 11:40:41 2015 UTC,"< sarcasm > I'm still angry at everyone who has gotten an invite... <  /sarcasm >  I want it...desperately.  Mostly for the Sprint / T-Mobile as one network goodness.  Sprint in my area had excellent coverage.  LTE speeds for Sprint are about 10 ~ 15mb down, 5 ~ 10 mb up.  Some dicey spots are 3 ~ 5mb down on LTE.  I was a Sprint customer for about 6 years.  I really never had any complaints about them.  But LTE on Sprint is everywhere around here.  I never hit 3G on them.  T-Mobile is stupid fast around here.  I just switched to T-Mobile a few days ago.  I used T-Mobile for a bit during my wild times when I had my nexus 4.  I've already had a speed test with 45mb down on T-Mobile.  Most speed tests have been in the 25 ~ 30 mb down range. But the dead spots can be killer...LTE here...HSPA+...2G edge...LTE again...no coverage... HSPA....2G edge...LTE!  At least that's how it was two years ago.  T-Mobile has greatly improved my area so I thought I'd try it on my Nexus 6 again.  I'm in the Harrisburg, PA area BTW.  I just really, really want Fi."
ProjectFi,3dsx7s,sponslerm,3,Sun Jul 19 04:34:49 2015 UTC,Hang in there. Buddy of mine had his status updated to 12+ weeks but received his invite a couple days ago. It'll come.
ProjectFi,3dsx7s,heyliberty,3,Sun Jul 19 06:54:39 2015 UTC,"Harrisburg represent! T-Mobile is ridiculously fast here and I had them for close to ten years before leaving for Fi. No complaints in central PA, but as soon as you venture out things get hairy. Was so glad to head to Annville last week and have coverage through Sprint. Totally worth it. Hang in there, your invite will come eventually!"
ProjectFi,3dsx7s,sponslerm,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:53:24 2015 UTC,"On T-Mobile 2 years ago, once you got past 114 on 81 south it would go from LTE to 2G edge.  I travel to Shippensburg to meat up with old college friends a couple of times a year and the T-Mobile reception was just flat out bad.  It seems to be A LOT better.  Shentel Networks manages Sprint's network from north of central PA down 81 past  Roanoke.  It's one of Sprint's best network coverage areas.  See here : http://s4gru.forumflash.com/uploads/monthly_04_2014/post-25488-0-49522600-1396965952.jpg The yellow was Shentel's LTE coverage as of April 2014.  I've hit all 3 Sprint Bands (1900mhz band 25, 800mhz band 26, 2100mhz band 41) around Harrisburg (I live in Mechanicsburg actually).  I never had Sprint complaints about coverage or speed.  But given my out of contract status, I thought I'd T-Mobile a go (two lines unlimited talk, text, 4G data, 7gb tether for $100) until I got my Fi invite.  I guess I was a pretty heavy Sprint head...lol...I never had issues with them.  A lot of people look at me funny when I say I loved Sprint."
ProjectFi,3dsx7s,sponslerm,2,Sun Jul 19 19:41:46 2015 UTC,"Never tried Sprint, but the only thing that made me angry with Tmo was the severe drop off of service outside of Harrisburg. Taking a trip down to Williamsburg back in May was rough because of all the dead zones on the highway. If you weren't around D.C. or Richmond, there was no service. Now, with Sprint, I even have coverage in places like Grantville where I had no chance of it. I'm incredibly pleased with Fi and no longer need to try and figure out a route that doesn't lose significant coverage. I'm paying a little more for that, but it's worth it for me."
ProjectFi,3dsx7s,sponslerm,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:23:26 2015 UTC,The thing I noticed about Sprint was quantity of coverage of sheer speed of your connection.  LTE / 3G CDMA or eHRP is nearly everywhere.  Their speeds aren't usually going to win a race...but the coverage has been spectacular.

This is not for the people that blow through tons of data a month. I large cities there might be enough public wifi to get away with it, but if you're not connecting to wifi most of the time and mainly use data to stream video, music and download, Fi will not be cheap for these types of users."

To be honest, I see no compelling reason to use Fi at all, even if you don't use much data. Net10, Tracfone, and Straight Talk are all cheaper even at the bottom tier of data usage.   I'm a Google fan, still am and always will be. I thought there would be more innovation other than WiFi calling and using two (albeit the worst) networks.

If one seldom goes above 2GB then on Fi he would pay $30-40 per month. On Straight Talk it is $45.  $30-40 is really cheaper than $45. It's over $100 annual difference. I don't care if I'm allowed to use whole 5GB on Straight Talk for this price, I just don't use them."

ProjectFi,3djqph,DeskJet720c,4,Thu Jul 16 20:49:37 2015 UTC,"That's what I'm hoping to fix with Fi, coming from TMO. I know going in that Fi isn't going to offer the same coverage that Verizon used to give me, I just want to wind up somewhere in the middle between TMO (useless outside of medium-large cities) and Verizon (Strong LTE in the middle of the Nevada desert, in a town of 300 people).   Hell, my international coverage in Ireland on TMO was better than my domestic coverage. I know, apples and hand grenades, but was still shocking. I just hope to pick up 20% more roaming coverage, and clean up any dead zones inside major cities.   I'm on WiFi 90% of the time, so coverage isn't critical, except when it is... Being at an office .5 miles from I-80, and 3 miles from downtown Reno (population 230k+) with 0 signal just doesn't cut it. Being at another office .1 mile from I-580, .5 mile from a major hospital with 0 signal and/or Edge doesn't cut it. 95% of where I go it's just fine, just need the 4% of densely populated dead zones covered, and maybe a third of the other remote areas that I spend a little time covered. I can live with spotty coverage in the middle of Yosemite or Death Valley, but being surrounded by people, technology, and easy opportunities for coverage with no coverage simply is unacceptable.   That being said, I don't feel like supporting Verizon (excellent service, but horrible network policies) or AT&T (moderate service, terrible/lying customer support) so I'd rather suffer and support TMO's policies with my dollars than the alternative."

There is only 1 ROM that is AOSP based (meaning not based off a stock Google image) that works fully. That is Pure Nexus  Beanstown106 is very open about his source, so hoping more devs add the stuff he has found to their ROMs so there is more to check out.

The difference between rooting and a custom rom is having the stock rom, but basically having administrative rights (root rights).  This allows you to run a bunch of different programs and perform tasks you would not be able to do.  A custom rom adds features, typically comes rooted and thus you get the benefits of being rooted as well as additional features.

I was reading that after the 5.1 update tap to wake isn't as reliable.  What are you using to enable it?  Did you edit the sys file directly or do you use an app?

I don't think invites makes much sense as long as the only supported phone has a somewhat niche appeal.  The dream would be if the rumored 5.2 inch LG Nexus 5 (2015) would be priced similarly to the LG Nexus 5 (2013). That would be a low resistance choice for many people.

ProjectFi,3de75h,Dormont,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:05:39 2015 UTC,"Fi had nothing to do with it. Your T-Mobile build has T-Mobile server built in as its update server. So no matter what network it is on, it looks for T-Mobiles update server.  Think of it like Windows update. Doesn't matter who your home internet provider is, the computer still calls the built in MS server."
ProjectFi,3de75h,if0rg0t2remember,1 point,Thu Jul 16 02:32:07 2015 UTC,I side loaded the 'Z'  build from xda. I'm guessing it must have had the Tmobile under the hood then. Strange that the old VZW build never picked up its version of 5.1.1. I really hope M gets us all the Fi radios.

ProjectFi,3de4ov,ImperatorPC,1 point,Thu Jul 16 00:43:03 2015 UTC,"It would work if they simply add the phone's IMEI or other serial number to their database. These are the XT1103 phones, unless you get them from one of the 3rd party sellers, then it's a toss-up.  They will probably tell you to return it and order from them, but that's just so that they can get the commission or because they are not knowledgeable enough about the subject. They can do it, there are numerous reports of them manually adding IMEI numbers to their database."

Hangouts and Hangouts Dialer (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.hangoutsdialer&hl=en) can solve your issue. Because you can have multiple Google accounts logged in on one phone, once Hangouts Dialer is installed, just check the box to have calls ring in Hangouts for your GV number account. This will allow you to make and receive calls to your GV number inside of Hangouts. It will require that you use Hangouts for texting and calls with your GV number and not use the stock dialer or messaging apps."

ProjectFi,3d9pmw,ImperatorPC,2,Tue Jul 14 19:30:43 2015 UTC,This.  T-Mobile and Sprint have agreements with At&T and Verizon respectively to increase their coverage.  This way you should always be able to receive calls when in an area that's covered by any of the major carriers.
ProjectFi,3d9pmw,VigilanteTech,2,Tue Jul 14 19:08:37 2015 UTC,"I spoke to a Fi rep, who referred this to a specialist before getting back to me, and the verdict seemed to be that Fi couldn't guarantee we could use these networks as roaming agreements may not extend to Fi customers.

ProjectFi,3da3ax,ImperatorPC,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:13:02 2015 UTC,Yea but to get decent speeds you need to have a good amount of upstream bandwidth plus good peering with others which your ISP takes cares of.

When I was in college Comcast was really shotty and when playing online games (cough WoW cough, Halo) I would get massive lag spikes.  Now that I rarely ever play I couldn't say it's any better where I live, but it's reliable enough to stream movies and surf the net.  We pay like $60+/month and have like 10 channels, but get a 50mbit connection.  Ridiculous!  I really hope something in the Chicago area comes along.

ProjectFi,3dbv8t,BrinkoJones,1 point,Wed Jul 15 14:31:31 2015 UTC,"Thankfully the invites don't expire.   This is the main reason I think it's sticking around for a while (maybe only a few years, but that may be all it takes to change the industry). I jumped on the N6 because it's really the first ""flagship"" device Google has released in recent years. The N5 was fantastic, but definitely more of a mid-range device, even in its heyday. I'm excited to see what LG brings to the table with the 2015 N5!"
ProjectFi,3dbv8t,mechgingeneer,2,Thu Jul 16 17:07:11 2015 UTC,If it isn't that essentially means Google Fi is done. I don't see that being the case because I really think they want to put some weight behind this venture.

ProjectFi,3dafpp,Dexter79,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:02:52 2015 UTC,I have looked into unlocking the phone and it does look like either you have to have the contract over with ATT to get the code or you have to buy it from a 3rd party. I just wanted to be sure this model has both types of radio and all in it and that ATT didn't f' it up too badly.

ProjectFi,3d59wc,majkeli,6,Mon Jul 13 17:09:12 2015 UTC,A workaround is to place the phone in Airplane mode and enable wifi. That way you can get text/mms and place/receive calls via wifi.

ProjectFi,3d59wc,dmziggy,2,Mon Jul 13 19:21:06 2015 UTC,"Thanks for this man. It would be a real shame if cellular was always preferred over wifi, because I have a similar situation at home. Low cell signal, great wifi and all my calls go through cellular. Also, it would be awesome to have a way to set a preferred method in the future, like if we're on wifi and would prefer to make calls over cellular, to pick this in settings and vice versa. The ultimate customization in cell service!"
ProjectFi,3d59wc,fweepa,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:53:57 2015 UTC,This is already in the settings to set the preference.  The server has just set the threshold to switch to WiFi calling extremely high.  :) I think you'll find in future updates that threshold will be lowered and more WiFi calls will be happening.

ProjectFi,3d59wc,grooves12,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:20:55 2015 UTC,It sounds like the threshold for switching from Cell to WiFi hasn't been reached so it doesn't switch. You may have to manually turn on Airplane mode and WiFi. You could also try the carrier switching codes to see if you get a better signal on the other carrier.
ProjectFi,3d59ab,Solex159,3,Mon Jul 13 17:04:43 2015 UTC,"MMS doesn't use your data plan, and SMS is plain old text.  When you add a picture to a SMS message, the software/app converts it to a MMS message, which is treated as a standard text message by your carrier.   You can text 100 photos to your friend, and your data plan will still report 0MB of usage.   This goes back to before mobile internet ever existed.  Phones had cameras but no way to send the pictures anywhere, so MMS was developed to transmit photos across existing cellular tech and carriers offered this feature as a perk to customers.  Mobile internet came around and we're still using the same old MMS tech (though improved) to transmit images."

ProjectFi,3d6lqu,RupeThereItIs,4,Tue Jul 14 13:42:49 2015 UTC,"Current phones will prob never be accepted. It has to do with the hardware inside the phone.

However, it isn't officially supported because the N5 can't connect to one of TMobile's main freq bands, so I guess data/call quality is not as great.    Feel free to correct me lol    Overall, as others pointed out, it has to do with hardware. It's like asking if a CD player can play BluRays. Nope."

I will say that the Nexus 6 is right at the limit of my hand's reach, but I get so much screen real estate it doesn't bother me.  As for carrying it around, it will fit in any normal sized pockets. If your S5 fits, the N6 will likely fit too. Unless you're wearing skinny jeans.  I also have the Spigen SlimArmor case on mine, and I have no problem using it, even with the added thickness.
