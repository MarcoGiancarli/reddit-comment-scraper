It's on the absolute fringe for outrun considering the voice is not like most outrun songs.  Listen to these two: The Best Thing - Electric Youth and my personal favorite, Magic ft.

In Leave a Trace the vocals are more at the front and the music is secondary."

outrun,3cqnhg,cultculturee,9,Fri Jul 10 02:45:56 2015 UTC,"Eh, I don't know... It definitely isn't purely outrun, but it has a ton of 80's synth.  Besides, why don't we let the users decide if it fits the genre? There is no dictionary definition of ""outrun"", so why don't we let it come about naturally?"
outrun,3cqnhg,cultculturee,3,Fri Jul 10 02:55:35 2015 UTC,"At surface level the idea of majority vote seems like an appealing idea. Everyone gets to contribute and everyone feels good, right? And the most popular decisions are consequently the best decisions or else everyone wouldn't have voted on them, right?  But here's the thing, not everyone has the same vision. Sometimes those visions contrast greatly right off the bat, and it's obvious they don't belong together. But then other times those visions are sort of similar, but not entirely, but it's close enough so let's just let it slide. But wait how about this other vision, that's pretty similar to the second vision, but y'know not really, but it's close enough, right? Let's just let that one slide too because it's sort of close.  Twenty visions later and you have the one person with the original vision and another person who's vision is barely related at all. It's like trying to sharp shoot with a shotgun.  What I'm saying is that if you want to have a consistent vision you need a dictionary definition created by people with good taste and high standards that is maintained and curated consistently. Otherwise you end up with the Spirit of Pawnee. Or a song that just because it has a synth in it it suddenly sounds like Kavinsky.  edit: lol it's been kind of funny to watch the karma for this fluctuate so drastically"

outrun,3cqfl6,witch_trial,5,Thu Jul 9 23:11:00 2015 UTC,"John Carpenter. The dark tones, driving beats, heavy synth. That's what I consider or how I define this specific niche genre - more specifically than just ""synthy 80s music"".  I haven't listened to every Carpenter OST, but most of the movies he personally scored capture this tone to some degree. A lot of the individual tracks are more soundtracky background ambiance, not so much designed to stand alone, but you can still hear in them the influence that modern artists are drawing from. I've cherry-picked some of the better stand-alone examples:  The End (part 1) - Assault on Precinct 13 OST (1976) edit: I think this is actually a disco remix of the main theme. It seems this version was released in 1986. I'm not sure who it's by, but probably not Carpenter himself. I'll leave it up here because it's fantastic. Main theme - Assault on Precinct 13 OST (1976) Abduction At Airport - Big Trouble in Little China OST (1986) He's Still Alive - Escape From New York OST (1981) Through The Mirror - Prince of Darkness OST (1987) Coming To L.A. - They Live OST (1988) Shape Escapes - Halloween OST (1978)  I think Carpenter's movies also capture a lot of the vibe of that era. Not the visuals so much, but the mean streets, the kind of contrasting grime and goofy, fluorescent excess of the 80s. If cyberpunk is a neon-lit city street at nighttime, I think outrun is the sun setting on Miami beach. Except, rendered digitally, with wireframe grids."

outrun,3cg96o,TheFireStudioss,3,Tue Jul 7 20:48:43 2015 UTC,"No problem man!  Mastering is a bit tricky. I honestly have someone that does some work on the side for tha sort of thing, but what I've learned from working with him is that a mix is essential to a good master. If you're song is mixed to shit, then no amount of mastering will help.  Couple tips I usually try to follow.   Set the max volume on your mixer at -4dB. Louder is NOT always better. Give your track some headroom, so that things won't get muddy in the future. Highs and lows. Synthwave/Outrun is emulating that 80s sound right? Well most equipment from the time didn't have access to the highest and lowest registers of sound. While you can always take creative freedom with this, I usually try and cut anything below 30K and above 13K. Muddiness. If you have a lot of things going, try and make sure that they don't blend horribly, and muddy up your mix. It may not be something you think about, but if you have two sounds going at the exact same frequency, they'll most likely attempt to battle each other for supremacy, making the overall sound shit. Going back to volume again. If your end mix is already at the volume that the end result needs to be, you need to go back and change shit. Mastering will deal with the volume, give the mastering people some headroom to work with, so that your track doesn't become all compressed to hell. The Loudness War is real, and it can degrade your music.   Sorry if this wasn't exactly what you were looking for, but I hope that it helps you out some bro!"

outrun,3cg96o,SourRocketJump,2,Tue Jul 7 23:49:26 2015 UTC,"Let's see, I started messing around with stuff the tail end of my junior year of high school. So roughly 3 years and some change.  I actually started off under a different name, just producing whatever shitty music I could come up with in 2 hours. Over time though I was able to actually learn how to do things, and apply myself.  It helps that one: I was in both concert and marching band during high school, so I had a lot of daily exposure to music.  It also helps that I'm from a fairly musically inclined family. The funny thing is though, it all skipped my parents genreation save for my uncle, and all of my cousins, so inherited a lot of musical interest haha.  If I had to track my interest in making music, I'd have to go back to 8th grade when I learned how to play guitar by myself. From there I learned how to play several types of drums (marching band), keyboard (super rusty and self-taught), accordion (process of learning the family heirloom), drum kit, and bass."
outrun,3cg96o,CertifiedStegosaurus,1 point,Wed Jul 8 00:20:00 2015 UTC,"Very cool!   I too have a small bit of background in music. I began learning piano when I was about 9 after my parents bought us (my two younger brothers and I) a keyboard for Christmas one year. I also was in my middle school Concert band for about 5 years playing trumpet, although I wasn't that great to be honest.  Through my 5 years of lessons of Piano, as well as my time in Concert, I gained some basic music theory. Looking back, the most eye-opening thing from it all has to be the discovery of being able to ""play by ear"" and not having to necessarily read music, but instead just hear it and play it right back. Even with my short time using FL Studio I'd consider it a major plus."

Saw wave, with a lowpass filter that has a quick, plucky envelope attached. Add reverb, and some slight vibrato.  I can try this out when I get back to my computer later, but this is my best guess.   You might have better luck checking out /r/synthrecipes; I frequent there if anything just to find out how to synthesize different things.  And really that's the important bit to take away from here, learning to synthesize your own sounds is massively important. Learn to emulate a sound, in this case Kavinsky, but make it your own."

outrun,3cclfy,hitlersbreastmilk,44,Tue Jul 7 04:25:00 2015 UTC,"I was born in the early 90's.  I didn't really ever have exposure to 80's music or culture growing up in my home because my parents themselves basically worked day and night through that decade, meaning they didn't really experience or appreciate it themselves or pass it along to their kids.  What I did experience though was the remnants of the 80's that didn't phase out quickly and bled into 90's culture.  Things like buildings and architecture, graphical designs, and rerun television shows.  I think the appeal of Outrun for me doesn't necessarily come from experiencing the 80's first hand, but rather as an observer of the culture that preceded my 90's nostalgia.    Additionally, I have a strong love for electronic music and video games.  Many of my favorite musical artists and games are derivative interpretations of what the 80's were like (see Kavinsky, Powerglove, Hotline Miami, Drive etc.)  I think a similar comparison to this would be how people love the aesthetic of the fallout series-just because you didn't grow up in the 50's doesn't mean you can't enjoy the style of music in the game.  The aesthetics of 80's culture are being reimagined by some really great modern artists.  It is not hard to appreciate just how cool some of this stuff is.  That being said though, the appeal for me is much more rooted in Outrun'esque media than it is in the idea of reliving the glory days.  I love the angst and mystery and the token themes that Outrun has to offer.  It is a very stylized approach to art that I enjoy a whole lot."
outrun,3cclfy,IDlOT,7,Mon Jul 6 22:29:28 2015 UTC,"As someone who was also born in the early 90s, my biggest question about the 80s (and to some extent, preceding decades) is about what happened to the aesthetics? /r/retrofuturism is full of things that people thought the future would look like: strong lines and angles, distinct solid colors, and making every component of a product look fused together.   I'm no designer but I feel like we diverged from that path at some point, and now we are in some kind of minimalist arms race (especially with web/mobile apps which, granted, didn't exist at the time). Part of me wonders what the world would look like today if we had kept to that previous 'futuristic' aesthetic as technology evolved."
outrun,3cclfy,Epledryyk,6,Tue Jul 7 06:36:14 2015 UTC,"Industrial designer here, and while I'm doing my best to fill the world with things of that design style the answer in the simplest terms is just ""the 90's happened""  The longer answer is a bunch of different factors. Retrofuturism isn't really Outrun itself, so while this is posted in /r/outrun, I'm sort of ignoring it as an aesthetic. In truth, Retrofuturism straddles the 80's in time: it's what they thought the future (namely, 2000+ because people like big round numbers) would be from their time, which is generally 50's-70's in the post war boom. This is where a lot of those Popular Mechanics covers and crazy different technologies come from: people were super optimistic and it shows in the design language. They really thought they could live in bubbles and ride paddle-wheel jetskies down river roads to work because why not? They were feeling rich and full of life and the factories were suddenly freed up from building tanks and ammunition so they could just build whatever they liked. It's this big cyclical thing of excitement and possibility.  In reality, on the design side, we had people like Dieter Rams and the Eames and many modernists who pulled together that modernist idea of a house being this living thing. The objects were quiet and a little playful and fun. They were clean and elegant and designed for the everyman. The Eames Lounge chair, that one that's like $4k to buy now? It was originally supposed to be in every house, they made it to be perfect for everyone and long lasting enough that it could be used for your entire life. The leather wore in beautifully, the wood would last stylishly. These were the ideals: if not bubble houses and Jetson cars, at least good stuff. Nice stuff. The stuff I think you're talking about above.  It's hard to condense a lot of culture into ""this is the driving factor"" because that's not true or simple, but the optimism died at some point. The corporations of the 80's were taking over, the flower child hippy generation faded into disco faded into Outrun a little bit, but without the nostalgia and ridiculousness we see it as now looking back. At some point we had movie culture fade from Star Trek's exploring the universe as a happy space ship in a post-scarcity society to TRON and Blade Runner and Alien, to Robocop. Suddenly the future wasn't bright anymore, it was run by Patrick Bateman and filled with ads and bureaucracy and brutalist architecture (which, side note, was very idyllic in the beginning). We had the Watchmen as a touchstone of gritty comics and we had grunge and punk as reactionary scenes to the corporate sell-out ""The Man"" thing.  Meanwhile, industrial design got cheap. Profit motive. Chinese manufacturing. Plastic became part of the lexicon in a big way. It was fast to produce, the metal stamping and bending, the steamed wood pressing and fiberglass by hand molding of objects is ridiculously expensive in comparison. Plastic also brings with it an amazing shape flexibility - if you can make a shape in a mold, you can make that shape out of plastic. Even minor things - imagine trying to make an N64 out of metal. It's really quite complex for a simple curvy box. And then the transparent fad happened. And then Apple started to take off. Round and bulbous took over. We saw it in cars (look at an 80's Taurus vs a 90's or 2000's Taurus) especially, and we saw it in human scale things too. Dieter Ram's very stark cylinder coffee maker became whatever the heck they are today: just this sort of melty blob of shapes. CAD as a technology allowed newer, blobbier designs to be real and companies didn't really care about design because they knew that a consumer would look at a $29.95 coffee maker and a $150 coffee maker with a pretty obvious choice. Some people will buy the espresso machine, sure, but we're talking about the masses.   Now we've come back around a bit: suddenly everyone can manufacture and get a $29.95 coffee maker on the shelves. Go to any store that sells them and look at the literal aisles just of machines that look identical and do basically the same function. How do you define yourself as a brand? How do you get bought? Well, they tried (and keep trying) to cram useless features into things. Why do microwaves need a dedicated button for corn? Who knows, but they can sell it as ""18 easy press functions!"" and people will buy it because that other one only has 15. More is better, don't you know. Gotta have buttons for broccoli with and without cheese. But I digress: the actual answer to that original question is ""good design"" - you know that handle that always burns you slightly when you pour the coffee? How about we think this through a bit and adjust things so they're better. Companies still, by the way, think this is useless money. Why would you hire a guy to work for a few weeks making a handle good? That's expensive! We need to be on the shelves tomorrow! and then they wonder why no one buys or likes their stuff. They blame the economy or whatever. Anything but ""we sent out a mediocre product and we admit consumers are smart enough to know that""   Anyway. That got a little ranty.   The answer to your question is that people on the whole buy things based on price and not on happiness or quality or function. As a company it's really hard to sell things that are holistic and well made and still well priced. The side answer to ""can't we still make sharp lines and bold colours like we were promised"" is yes, we can physically make those (and cheaply, if you don't mind the quality) but at those price points people don't really buy them and companies are too scared to manufacture them. On the other hand, we do have IKEA which is essentially that just more Scandinavian 70's rather than American 70's."

outrun,3cclfy,BrogueTrader40k,3,Tue Jul 7 01:02:00 2015 UTC,"I think you're close here with part of the reason why it's so attractive to some. When we imagine the romance of the 40s we tend to think of people listening to records and drinking wine from dusty bottles, women in heels smoking from cigarette holders etc - we don't think about people being separated from their families, having to sleep in Tube stations or being gassed. One side is not ""the reality"" - they are both ""the reality"" together. In romanticising any era we are extracting the best and most attractive elements and forming a new one in our psychoses fashioned out of the former. Similarly when we romanticise the 80s we don't think of Margaret Thatcher or the dreadful financial avarice that abounded everywhere, we fashion a new ""retrofuture"" [a very apt word in my opinion] which takes all of what was attractive from the era and we create a new world from it. One which is very close to the original and maybe should have been, rather than which actually was."

outrun,3cclfy,Tsuchino,24,Tue Jul 7 07:36:26 2015 UTC,"Born in 91, the media/movies/music I was exposed to during my early childhood was equal parts '80s and ""modern"" '90s stuff just due to my parents' tastes and the media they were into and owned from high school/college. I didn't have any kind of notion of what decade/style the movies and music I was consuming belonged to, it was just what I was exposed to and there was stuff I loved and stuff I disliked like any other collection of media. I might have also been more exposed to those kinds of influences than other children of that age whose parents might have prevented a 6 year old from watching Aliens/Robocop or playing Wolfenstein 3d.  Fast forward to the movie Drive; the intro with the chase scene emphasizing the weight of the cars and the roar of engines, then Kavinsky opening the credits, and an era of practical special effects and synthesizers was strongly evoked. It was then I figured out why a lot of movies and styles from the '80s had left a lasting impression on me. It was an age of clashing between digital and analog, of new technology but not the tech of today where everything can be clean, perfect, and tiny. The technology of the day had weight and heft, the parts by necessity were manufactured large enough that they still had character and identity to them, huge CRTs felt like more of a machine than the LCDs and thin displays of today. Special effects were still most effectively done not by CGI but by figuring out a way to put together real materials to achieve something. Cars were not slaves to aerodynamics, everything was flawed in different ways because of the constraints of knowledge and processing power available, and it gave a rich mix of design and technology that is extremely iconic.  Now today I'm a programmer living in a world where a lot of the tech people envisioned in the '80s and some of the fears are phasing into reality. There are mega corps like Google and Facebook that track user data extensively, entities like the NSA monitoring citizens, and many different corporations are pulling government strings more effectively than ever before.  Virtual reality has never looked more likely to succeed and it feels very Outrun to me. I have an Oculus DK2 and have experienced and made my own virtual reality creations, something that was really just a fantasy in the '80s but a lot of the visions are about to become real, it's awesome.  With the programming/3d graphics background I have today, there is just a lot I appreciate about what the engineers and artists of the time were able to accomplish together, and I consider '80s culture and the Outrun style as a kind of pinnacle of cooperation between analog and digital technologies with design that has gotten a whole lot less interesting ever since."
outrun,3cclfy,TheFireStudioss,8,Mon Jul 6 23:56:50 2015 UTC,Take it from someone who lived through the eighties- you nailed the appeal. That is exactly it.
outrun,3cclfy,MedusaOblongGato,7,Tue Jul 7 04:30:03 2015 UTC,"My interest in tech/computers/programming plays a big part in my love for the outrun genre.  You're spot on in pointing out the heft of old tech.  It feels more real than the silicon magic we carry around everyday.  Playing around with old computers and music equipment really makes you appreciate the kind of vision people had when that stuff was first coming out. A lot of the outrun stuff I see is that old vision finally realized to its full potential.  Kinda makes it hard to keep up with the level of quality that most of the new 80's noir stuff pulls off haha.  And I agree again on another point.  That it seems like we're living the dystopian future dreamt/feared of in the 80's.  Mega corporations harvesting data, cameras on every corner and in every pocket, an american government agency spying on its own citizens, literal virtual reality at our literal fingertips, and most people don't care about any of it.  When I was growing up in the 90s I was watching movies about people in virtual reality with a sweet synth soundtrack.  Now I'm making stuff in virtual reality with a sweet synth soundtrack.  The 80's gave us a template, and the outrun genre is its fruition."
outrun,3cclfy,Captain___Obvious,3,Tue Jul 7 04:52:26 2015 UTC,"I agree w/ you 100%.  It all coincides with the ubiquity of the truly miniature computer (I.E. the PC).   the parts by necessity were manufactured large enough that they still had character and identity to them   This was true of pretty much all products up until some time in the eighties or early nineties; the thing's physical design and appearance were necessarily evocative of how it functioned.  The way a modern device actually functions is very abstracted from the way it looks.  This is highly intentionally done by designers, much to my annoyance.  In that link the author's main point is that this distance twixt technology's actual functionality and our perception of that functionality is discomforting to us, especially as the gap widens.  The daily, ""household"" tech of the eighties may have been complex and advanced - take a television set or video game, for example - but it is reasonably easy to understand how this stuff actually works.  But the way the components of a PC (or any of the other tiny computers now in everything from motorcars to washing machines) work for a PC to actually do what a PC does is incomprehensibly far from human experience to be relatable, even if you do intimately know how they work.  The eighties were the end of most machines that most people dealt with having an appearance that was readily, comprehensibly indicative of how they worked.  And these things are all around us today.  It doesn't, a lot of the time, feel like we're even living in reality anymore, it feels like some dreamworld because there are complex machines BSing us into thinking they're simple everywhere.  It's why I like datamoshing, it's a reminder that all these colours and sounds are just carefully organized electrical pulses.  TL;DR: In many ways, the eighties are the last time reality felt real."

outrun,3cclfy,Hannnnn_Solo,13,Sun Jul 12 04:06:54 2015 UTC,"Outrun is heavily influenced by car culture, and vice versa. First, heavy beats and synth are perfect to drive to - music with fast beats or a lot of synth tends to be popular among people who love driving. Second (that someone already mentioned) is that there's a certain aspect of living a second life. For a lot of automotive enthusiasts, that's true. You work your job in the day, you drive at night. This is true for clubs like the Midnight Club (a former group of highway racers in Japan), the original drifters (who drifted in the mountains) and a lot of street racers or enthusiasts who want to go fast in canyon/mountain roads but have to do so at night. I know I sound like I'm trying to be an internet hard-ass (I don't actually do this, fyi).  Finally, there's something predatory about Outrun music. You get the sense when you listen to it, that it's generally very aggressive. When you're someone who likes to go to the track and go fast, you want to see yourself bearing down on those in front of you - you essentially want the thrill of chasing someone down and overtaking them."
outrun,3cclfy,Damage_Inc89,7,Tue Jul 7 02:17:10 2015 UTC,"This is all I listen to in my '80s BMW. It feels right with the roar of the engine as it engages the gear. Even if I'm only going to school, it's truly an experience."
outrun,3cclfy,BurnDesign,12,Tue Jul 7 02:39:24 2015 UTC,"I was born in '89, so I can't claim to remember any of it, but I grew up watching classic sci-fi from that era regardless.  I've always been a huge geek and loved the soundtracks to Terminator, Escape From New York,  and especially Blade Runner.  I craved more stuff like that, but all I ever found when searching for electronic music was dancey club stuff.  Finally I stumbled upon Perturbator, on a metal site is all places, and it was what I'd been craving for years.  I also like actual 80s music too, but a lot of that has to do with my parents' cassette collection growing up."
outrun,3cclfy,Broken_Blade,3,Mon Jul 6 23:29:08 2015 UTC,"This is it. I don't listen to anything but Metal... and now Outrun.  Dance music is fucking toilet compared to outrun. Like metal, it has a rich theatre to it, and an underlying foreboding that you can't get anywhere else."
outrun,3cclfy,ArgonSyn,2,Tue Jul 7 10:07:59 2015 UTC,"I totally agree.  I've gotten a lot of people to listen to outrun because I've described it as ""Electronic music for metal fans""."
outrun,3cclfy,BurnDesign,1 point,Tue Jul 7 11:46:56 2015 UTC,"I am an Electronic fan and my friend is a metal fan, and Outrun style music is something we both like. But do you know why it appeals so much to the metal crowd?"
outrun,3cclfy,BurnDesign,3,Tue Jul 7 14:17:51 2015 UTC,"I won't speak for all metal fans because there are a huge amount of layers to the Heavy metal landscape - and what makes us like what we like.   A big part of it is because the 80s (incidentally, when 90% of the best metal was made) had a great period of violent and dystopian visions of the future, and the more extreme/sinister nature of this appeals to a metal fan in terms of entertainent and theatre.  Other than dubstep, which is mostly off-limits to metal fans, not to mention very mainstream and completely off-radar, there's not a lot of music styles that have that aggression and a menacing edge to the music. I mean, track-based (as opposed to having a traditional song/vocal structure) metal is written in a similar sort of way and from a similar place of emotion as outrun, it's just that it uses analogue instruments instead.  The reason I love it though, is because it's my chill-out place. There are some times when you need something other than metal. And outrun is perfect."
outrun,3cclfy,CthulhuSquid,2,Tue Jul 7 15:25:57 2015 UTC,"You are very right in what you say about violent and dystopian visions of the future in 80s metal, especially thrash. Take a look at the work of Voivod, for instance, and the albums Dimension Hatröss and Killing Technology: there was a respect for the huge advances that digital technology was making, but also a fear about where they could eventually lead."
outrun,3cclfy,alchemeron,1 point,Tue Jul 7 19:56:19 2015 UTC,"Absolutely. It's the fear of this new-found tech that influenced a lot of output from the 80s.

outrun,3cclfy,Epledryyk,9,Sun Jul 12 08:51:48 2015 UTC,"Outrun, to me, is the recreation of a memory that didn't actually exist.  It's the way we remember an impression of something we maybe didn't directly experience.  I shy away from authentically 80's music and styles.  I prefer the music that takes the best elements of that time period then organized, presented, and performed with a more modern sensibility.  That's a great fusion, to me."

One thing I will point out is that the word Outrun is extremely curious to describe this genre - or realm - if we can call it that. I remember playing Outrun in the 80s and you just drive your car around a beach and a few other places. It wasn't dark, sexualised or futuristic at all, which is something I feel that the ""outrun"" genre has in spades. It has developed far beyond its origins."
outrun,3cclfy,littleinvad,9,Tue Jul 7 20:01:03 2015 UTC,"I was born in 1992 and raised on a steady diet of cable TV and the early beginnings of the internet (my dad was a regular poster on newsgroups like alt.binaries.slack). I had a NES and played games created before I was born. The favorite comics in my dad's comics collection came from the 80's (as a side note: late 80's/early 90's advertisements for Dungeons and Dragons are the shit) I didn't live through the 80's but I felt I lived enough of the 80s. My grandparents lived in Ft. Lauderdale Florida, which I firmly believe remained in the 80's until the mid-2000s.  Outrun isn't actually the 80's. It's to the 80's what Fantasyland in Disneyworld is to the medieval era. It's designed specifically for people like me who got a pop-culture only exposure to the 80's."
outrun,3cclfy,lostereadamy,6,Tue Jul 7 04:01:26 2015 UTC,"I was born in 1990, but all my toys and clothes were 80s handmedowns. Any music I was exposed to was a mixture of 80s one-hit wonders and the occasional cheesy adult contemporary that sounded like it was a decade behind. TV was this haze of 90s cartoon standbys mixed in with reruns of 80s movies. As for video games, the first brand new console I ever got was a Game Boy Color. Until then it was all NES and DOS games all the time. Even the PC I played those games on was a 286 from 1984. We didn't get a new PC or household internet until 2002. To me, 80s and 90s culture were one in the same. They coexisted.   Outrun, synthwave, vaporwave, and in general ""a e s t h e t i c s"" scratch this sort of nostalgic itch for me. It harkens back to this feeling of knowing something was outdated and primitive by modern standards, yet here it is, existing in the middle of modern society and everyday life. It's this feeling of making something old new again. It brings me back to the feeling of making do with what I had and enjoying it. Best analogy is like walking through a mall with decor and architecture from the 80s yet all the clothing for sale is from this year (which was incidentally, exactly the situation the local mall was in until it was renovated in the mid 2000s)   And it's weird because nothing's really gripped me like this before. I recently got into analog photography and a big part of that was inheriting my grandad's Nikon FG-20 from 1984. I wouldn't shut up about Hotline Miami for weeks. Pretty much the only thing I listen to while driving is Outrun type music; vaporwave, future funk, synthwave. I find myself wandering into thrift stores and looking at old cassette players and random electronics. People tell me I have an 80s obsession, which I wholeheartedly admit is true."

I'm on a road in the desert, where the only trace of life is in the distant beacon of light caused by a lone diner, or maybe a gas station. The whole outrun vibe just makes me feel alive.

outrun,3cclfy,Sonnington,3,Tue Jul 7 01:56:34 2015 UTC,"I love the '80s aesthetic and the raw sound of the synth.  '80s art direction/design- you have the classic pink, blue, and black, the grid patterns and other early computer-generated imagery, and the angular design language of cars and other products, all of that appeals to me. The '80s had such a distinct aesthetic that I really like.  Then there's the music itself. '80s movies are my favorite, partly due to the use of purely practical effects (no CGI!) and partly because of the tone and occasional cheesiness. But overall I just feel like a bunch of really high quality films came out in that decade. I'm derailing though. You have the synth music in some '80s movies, and synth in '80s music because it was a relatively new thing. I just love the sound of the synth. I also am really into chiptunes- I guess there's something I like about raw electronic music.  There's more to it than that. I just find that I have a fascination with '80s culture and media. It was before my time but I feel as if I have a sense of nostalgia for it, because I wish movies and music were still produced the way they were back then."

For instance, I just rediscovered Devo after 10-12 years and my god, they're shrill as fuck, but I love some of their songs. The songs I used to listen to in high school. They're actually really existential, symbolic, and have some good riffs. But there's no way if I was introduced to Devo today I could like their music, but I do and I think it's good.  For me, I was born in the mid 80's and used to hear a bunch of New Wave growing up on the radio. Also, more than anything else, Sega Genesis, specifically Streets of Rage 2 made me a huge fan of electronic 80's style synths.  If you don't know why you like it, that's fine. But it's kind of offensive to me that you're protesting a desire to understand why people objectively enjoy something.

There's just this feeling of adrenaline, pulsation, life, and energy that bursts through the cover of it all.   it feels like an action adventure romance that can't figure out what the difference between good and evil is. it's just there throwing itself at you for you to decide for yourself.   there's a freshness to the style. this constant theme of ""Remember how we used to do that? well fuck that, here's something completely different"".  There's a part of it that feels really distant and noisy and uninviting, like a room with 4 walls that is cluttered with all the newest and latest gadgets that are supposed to make you happy and improve your life, but no matter how long you spend in the room, there's no door to leave and you cannot get over the fact that you're there alone. It's like the time that we all realize that we are immensely connected in any way possible through technology, but we're still lonely as hell because there's nothing physical to wrap our arms around and love tenderly.   it always has this feeling of newness to it no matter when you find it, and there's this optimism that things are changing. theirs this notion of good things are coming amongst this depressing background of separation, anxiety, and loneliness.   it's sex and danger and fear and excitement all rolled into one. there's this feeling of equality and inadequacy at the same time.   I wasn't born in the era, and i never lived through any part of the 80's, and most of the 90's i was too young to remember. Even still the 80's theme brings this feel of nostalgia and comfort to both the adult and kid sides of me. maybe it's because ""Nostalgia"" of the 90's culture is the 80's, and that's what was depicted during my childhood? im not sure.   all i know is that it's comfortable, familiar, but new, and exciting all at once, and that is how it's always felt to me."

outrun,3cclfy,Mike_trollzowski,1 point,Tue Jul 7 14:31:56 2015 UTC,"I was born in 91 and as a child many of the things I saw I could have thought were from the 80's. I grew up on a lot of synth rock 80's music. John Hughes filled my teenage years with 80s teen culture. On the topic of those movies, I love how goofy they were while being realistic. Big Trouble in Little China is one of my all time favorites.   I also enjoy the things you could get away with saying or doing back then before EVERY thing became politically correct and polished for TV. I watched the Tim Richmond (nascar driver) documentary the other day and you see interviews where people really spoke their mind or may have said something not as polished. Someone asked him, ""do you intend on winning or just surviving,"" and he said, ""I'm here to win, I can't spell survive but win I think is, M O N E Y."" I just thought, hot damn, today it would have been, ""we are gonna come out and run the best race we can, the guys in the garage have worked hard, and we wanna put on a good show for the fans."" Which is good and polished but it's so hashed out.  Also, on the topic of racing, cars looked so much cooler in the 80's. NASCAR, Formula 1, sports cars, all looked awesome in the 80's. Now everything (in racing) is calculated for greatest aerodynamics and look kinda goofy.   Ultimately, if I look deep down at it, what I think draws me to the 80's so much is being able to live or experience a time  I missed out on or was too young to participate in. As a young kid there is so much you want to do and use but you're just too young. To you that style or that dress was your definition of cool. So you anticipate growing up and being able to do those things. But by the time you grow up those things have been phased out so its kind of like going back and experiencing that time at an age where I comprehend everything."
outrun,3cclfy,SkateFluckit,1 point,Tue Jul 7 15:00:05 2015 UTC,"I was born in mid 90s and for me it was video games and movies.  As every cool kid in my neighborhood I watched awesome movies like Terminator, Robocop and such as a kid. On VHS of course.  When I was about 8 years old I saw a GTA game for the first time and it was the first open-world game I saw (I didn't even know those existed). I was absolutely blown away, I fell in love with the game and its setting, I fell in love with 80's Miami and the amazing soundtrack. It's still one of my favorite games of all time.  Fast forward a couple years ago, Hotline Miami comes out. Really fast paced combat, visual aesthetic reminding me of Vice City and movies on VHS, amazing soundtrack that I was addicted to, I loved that game immediately. I was frustrated because I didn't know what outrun was at the time, so I wasn't able to find similar music which made me sad.  Then I see someone recommending the movie Drive to people who liked Hotline Miami which made me curious. After I watched the movie I fell in love with the soundtrack, looked it up and found /r/outrun"

outrun,3c9ust,rhijord,6,Mon Jul 6 05:57:28 2015 UTC,"For sounds: Heavy deep saw synths and early - sounding synth horns, some dancing synths over top. Lots of synths. 707 drum sounds and linndrum samples are popular, but not the only option. 90-100 bpm-ish with  a deliberate back beat and some double time synths for those dancing parts. Synth or fretless bass, rarely any fretted basses. Whaling distorted guitar solos. Floyd rose with a bridge pickup through a solid state amp mmmm. Sax solos, but a good saxophone sound is really hard to find. Basically for sounds, try to think of what equipment was available during the 80s and emulate it as best you can. There are lots of software options to make music: fruity loops, studio one, etc.  Most daw's have a built in synth. Play with all the knobs.  Musically:  Minor pentatonic works great, but I've had some fun/difficulty trying out different scales. The outrun style is rather dark so major scales are tricky. Sometimes you can get away with a bluesy/jazzy lick, but that should be left to the soloing instrument. Maybe the bass too if you can make some slick lines like carpenter brut. Some outrun music uses basic pop chord structures, other songs have a more jazzy structure, but nothing too crazy. Grace notes before chord changes and bending notes up to pitch go well, bending down gets tricky.   Take all this with a big grain of salt, I just started trying out this genre too. This is just stuff I've picked up by listening the last few months. And of course it's music. The fun starts when you bend the rules. Good luck!  edit: oh yeah as far as your equipment, you can do it with a mouse and keyboard. I use an old nintendo keyboard as a midi controller for almost everything, but have been trying to record a live guitarist."

I use samples from 1980s drum machines (the 808 is the big one but check out the Linndrum - thats what I used on this track) albeit with a bit of processing to make them punchier. Look into gated reverb snares for that big 80s snare sound.  Another little trick I use is some very subtle/slow pitch modulation on the master bus. This gives the whole track a slightly uneven pitch which makes it sound like its on an old tape.  Aside from all that, just listen to plenty of outrun style music and listen to the sorts of things they do relatively often."

outrun,3bqrnn,Lihamukimies,9,Wed Jul 1 11:47:57 2015 UTC,"Ya definitely. I think there are 2 big points of contention when labeling an ""outrun"" style track. First is when there are vocals included. I've noticed the inclusion of vocals makes people see it as a different genre. Almost as if you're not supposed to hear anyone sing when you're doing 140+ down a highway.  Second is when the vibe is more ambient and slower. The assumption is that you never slow down or stop when the cops are chasing you. I see it differently though…Part of living the OutRun life is having places to lay low, having something to love, or more importantly having a reason to fight for.   That's why I think artists like Trevor Something (ex: ""So Far Away) and Chvrches (ex: ""Tether"") don't quite fit the typical ""outrun"" chase moments well but they do fit into the story of an ""outrun"" lifestyle reallllly well.  More vocals + More emotion + more dynamics are good to expand our genre. Pure synth tracks are what's becoming more and more mediocre because they are static pieces of music and one's ear can only enjoy so much without a change of pace."

It's like punk kids who think you aren't punk if you don't drive a shitty old car or if you can talk to your parents civilly.   Fact of the matter is, the genre is based off the faded memories of the 80's. It's the distillation of a decade of music, movies and culture, seen through a modern lens, and as with all things, it will change over time.   ""Outrun"" as a genre will not remain the same. If you want a perfect example, look at ""emo"". If you're under the age of 30, you probably have no idea the origins of emo. (This, not this...and even that's not right.)   ""Outrun"" being the most popular term for 80's nostalgic music, will become the catch-all phrase for everything 80's nostalgic. No matter the tempo or feel of the song, plenty of people will wrongly label non-outrun things as outrun, and once critical mass hits, their wrongness will morph into being correct, and the genre will now be something different than it once was.   I think this topic is dangerously close to just being ""Back in my day, it was better!"" Time passes, things evolve, and when you're this close to the ground on an emerging genre, you see a lot of the bad stuff, but the cream of the crop will rise to the top for those that aren't checking out every new start up artist, and overall everything will be fine. But yes, if you've been listening to the genre for more than few years now, you almost certainly will be disappointed where it goes, and you'll swear it was better in your day. It happens to us all. It's called getting old."
outrun,3bqrnn,sample_material,3,Thu Jul 2 14:40:36 2015 UTC,"honestly if you think about it, outrun is just about trying to pick up where the (decent) part of the 80s left off."
outrun,3bqrnn,GhettoBurner,1 point,Fri Jul 3 02:24:11 2015 UTC,"I actually think it's not that simple. The best example is just how little original 80's music actually satisfies people looking for outrun material. I think it's more about the distilled, idealized memory of the 80's, reimagined with a lot of modern processes involved. I think the two decades being in between then and now are a big part of outrun.   I can't help but be reminded of when 70's styles started to come back in the 90's. Suddenly everyone was wearing John Lennon glasses and bellbottoms."
outrun,3bqrnn,sample_material,1 point,Fri Jul 3 02:31:43 2015 UTC,"i can see both of your points but outrun was inspired from more movie soundtracks and films like cannonball run, electric dreams 1984 and drive and while the soundtracks from those films were possibly inspired by the original new wave (79-86) they defiantly ended up in their own style that outrun is trying to develop/bring back/emulate.  sorta sucks since i'm more of a new wave/early synthpop guy but outrun still kicks ass."
outrun,3bqrnn,SageTK,2,Fri Jul 3 02:41:50 2015 UTC,"LOL I hear you. I wasn't saying I'm about to do my best True Survivor impression . I was just begging the question that if we appreciate all the chase scene music , we also need to appreciate music that represents why he's being chased (more personal stuff). That way we can get a full representation of our hypothetical ""Outun"" hero's lifestyle, not just the action scenes."
outrun,3bqrnn,eye2eyemusic,1 point,Thu Jul 2 15:18:28 2015 UTC,"I think what the poster meant with lifestyle was a reference to a character, that pretty much everyone pictures in their head while listening to outrun music and which story the makers of music are telling."
outrun,3bqrnn,WoofWoofKats,3,Sat Jul 4 21:18:13 2015 UTC,"That is really fascinating point you made about ""outrun lifestyle"". I have never thought about it that way. In the end, this whole genre is based upon 80s movies and games so maybe we should look it like that. A well structured albums and movies both have their slower paced and action based parts (and without action, some sort of thing that makes scenes more tense) and the person that listens or watches needs some time off every once in a while, otherwise it's too exhausting.  EDIT: Thanks for the heads up with that Trevor Something! Listening to his album now and i love it! Nice to see Blue Monday by New Order being sampled in it."

outrun,3bm6p4,AT-Fields,2,Tue Jun 30 20:09:07 2015 UTC,"Another way to do it is to create a new image, 1px wide and as tall as you'd like the lines to be spaced. Use the pencil tool and fill in either the top or bottom pixel with black. Then, you can select the whole thing and save it as a pattern. Now you can just use the paint bucket tool to fill an image with scanlines, and the best part is you only need to do this a single time - the pattern stays in memory unless you purposefully remove it."

A lot of people find these albums through these channels (like me) and then proceed to buy them."

outrun,3bhrtg,Bladamir,12,Mon Jun 29 09:30:08 2015 UTC,"New Retro Wave is probably one of the more popular youtubers with Outrun music.  Many of the backgrounds that they use for the videos are 80s inspired original art, and they have much of that available on that website.  You can also find a decent amount of actual 80s art at Luigi Donatello's Facebook page.  He's another YouTuber with outrun music. Also, if you really want to understand the vibe that much of outrun imitates, go and watch the Pilot Episode of Miami Vice from 1984 (It's on Netflix; about 1 hour 30 min long).  The music is definitely more 80s synth than Outrun, but the fashion is very similar. Hope that helps."

outrun,3bgckq,Yackemflaber,1 point,Tue Jun 30 17:04:43 2015 UTC,"For me, outrun has more of a soundtrack sound to it. It doesn't HAVE to be instrumental but it almost always is. It can be synthy summertime music that sounds like it's ripped from Miami in the 80s or even hard hitting synth driven music that feels like someone pulled it straight out of an 80s action or horror movie (my favorite kind).   CHVRCHES does have that 80s sound, BUT in more of a synth pop fashion reminiscent of new wave bands such as Duran Duran or Depeche Mode or New Order.   I'm nowhere near an expert on outrun, but that's what I've always felt it was; a soundtrack to a fun drive, at its core. Sure, you could listen to CHVRCHES on a drive, but it wouldn't be the soundtrack to the twists and turns of the road as you barrel through the city at night; it would just be music to accompany you. There's a lot better ways I could describe it but off the top of my head that's what I can easily narrow it down to.   If you want examples of outrun, check out Lazerhawk (his albums Skull & Shark and Redline are great), Actrazer, Miami Nights 1984, Power Glove, Perturbator, Dynatron, Mitch Murder, and Kavinsky."

outrun,3atraw,acdcfanbill,2,Tue Jun 23 20:06:03 2015 UTC,"Blood Music is actually a pretty cool label, I started following them a bit on Youtube once I realized Perturbator was signed to them."
outrun,3atraw,Ulti,6,Wed Jun 24 04:49:05 2015 UTC,"Eh, it's run by one guy and he posts way too many fucking rants on Facebook for me to think highly of him anymore. Had a few 1 on 1 talks with him too and he's a bit of a tool. He also doesn't listen to the community whatsoever and still is doing such limited releases of like 100 copies for a demand of ~1,000-5,000. I've actually stopped buying their drops."
outrun,3atraw,SirNarwhal,2,Tue Jun 23 14:53:48 2015 UTC,Demand of 5000 vinyls? Less than 1500 Dangerous Days vinyl pressed and there still is some in stock.
outrun,3atraw,LancerFIN,4,Tue Jun 23 17:19:57 2015 UTC,Most people don't know a third press ever occurred.
outrun,3atraw,SirNarwhal,1 point,Tue Jun 23 18:41:35 2015 UTC,"Hah I have heard that about their vinyl releases, but I don't have facebook or really follow them at all. So really all I know about them is what acts are signed to them!"
