WoahTunes,3d50zn,OKB-1,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:04:08 2015 UTC,"Canticles of the Sky: Sky with Four Suns  by John Luther Adams in cooperation with the Northwestern University Cello Ensemble.  John Luther Adams is an exceptional composer. It's like his music isn't made by humans. It's more like if it was made by nature itself.  When listing to his music I imagine being in a place completely isolated from any civilisation, overwhelmed by the greatness of nature and how insignificant we creatures are.  In case you lack the imagination and/or substances I recommend you look at some of these types of video's while listening."
