dota2loungebets,3e58fi,Maverick1982,1 point,Wed Jul 22 03:52:22 2015 UTC,when i said that i meant VG.P prolly knows how Nb.y plays and can counter 'em otherwise they wouldn't win 3 BO3s in a row. 2 of them being 2-0s. THIS IS WHAT I THINK
dota2loungebets,3e58fi,Maverick1982,2,Wed Jul 22 04:24:46 2015 UTC,"EP thought they knew how NB.y played as well.  What did they do?  They got mind fucked.   4 things worked against EP that series and allowed NB.y to win   Given, 1, EP really played poorly They had a swap of players between two series.  They got out-drafted as hard as a quartz rock. They 2nd phase pick huskar when Slark was still in the pool was obvious, but overall, they were just plainly outdrafted (sticking with DK on Old Chicken). The gyro pick was a smoke screen that allowed them to..which is the last thing that is obvious... Giving Ember Spirit to Piao. NewbeeY's run in form is no surprise to their good drafting, and Piao playing at a high level. Pretty much sif the lines of XinQ in TongFu. Piao made a world difference on his ember.   Hence, my point, match history in this instance means nothing. This newbee young team is judged for their recent performance and most importantly, is the odds stacked for or against them.  VG.P, is undoubtedly the most flip flop team you can find in the chinese scene. (Tongfu used to carry that banner but now, they are surely the top tier 2 team. Getting zEXBingo to replace Red made the world a difference).  Match history means nothing in this instance. Same as how TF cannot be ajudged on their poor performance because of their recent strong performances.   50:50 is about right, means, as an astute bettor, there's very little edge on this game on either side."

dota2loungebets,3e58fi,Maverick1982,1 point,Wed Jul 22 04:44:16 2015 UTC,Did you actually see the Ep vs NewbeeY match. Anyone who has played 25 games in captains mode will draft better than what EP did.
dota2loungebets,3e58fi,chrismon08,2,Wed Jul 22 07:00:45 2015 UTC,"I actually did watch the games.  Maybe Dota 2 has to switch to a game mode where the game mode is mirrored mode so that there's no question that teams are playing on equal turf.  EG's been out-drafted before  Cloud 9's been out-drafted before  Even Team Secret's been out-drafted before (1st game ESL was an outdraft by a huge mile).  So, your point being ?"
dota2loungebets,3e58fi,FortressX,1 point,Wed Jul 22 07:55:15 2015 UTC,The point was in top tier teams getting out drafted is not new or unheard off. It might happen at times and fairly understood. But even though out drafted the team at least tries to put a good show. But in EP vs NBY game that was one part which was totally missing.

They don't care on what happened on that tournament until managers of tournament create a special request with proofs of someones guilty.

dota2loungebets,3e4kb2,Finstacker322,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:36:46 2015 UTC,it's with the betting sites as well. they claim that closing the bets will promote DDOSing as well but doesn't letting the bets clear benefit the DDOSers even more? Cancelling the bet will limit how much the DDOSers can gain (gain in the sense that they do not lose what they were supposed to lose) as well as limiting how much the bettors that bet on the DDOSed team lost as well.
dota2loungebets,3e4zd5,excitedgrot,2,Wed Jul 22 00:17:38 2015 UTC,"I'm not a big fan of Blackburn, but his explanation is pretty clear, and I support their decision. Right now, if you try to DoS someone, you can't expect the opposite team to win with ease (you can't be sure that you will save your bet even if you DoS). And if you cancel DoS'd matches, then the DoSer certainly saves his bet."

If not, then I would suggest that .. since as your website gets more investors, the percentage of winners will drop significantly. Major Lotto businesses have successfully moved onto a working model where the prize money is divided into multiple denominations which ensures that the lottery is lucrative and there are more happy people at the end of the day.    TL;DR - How about having multiple winners instead of 1 winner and 99 losers."
dota2loungebets,3e03qx,--Rae,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:37:40 2015 UTC,"How would you propose one does this?  One of the biggest problems with value betting on dota2lounge was splitting wins. If there were two people, one person that won $40 and another person won $30 and they had to share a winning item of $80 it would state that the person that won $40 would get it and the other person would receive nothing.   I can't really split an item in half... any ideas? The best thing I can come up with is daily, weekly or monthly jackpots where people that have used it once in an (x) amount of period has another chance to win another jackpot."

dota2loungebets,3dx93m,FortressX,3,Mon Jul 20 08:01:56 2015 UTC,"Well since TWO teams from the wildcard advance, I can't see anyone else besides VEGA and CDEC, mvp could upset but I think its fairly unlikely.   Its probably the hardest TI to call so far as Secret/EG/VG/iG/C9/Empire/VP can all make very good runsto the top 3. Secret/EG have been MUCH further ahead than any team of late but anything can happen, a team like VG could just show up and exceed expectations. Personally I think this is the year that a russian team like VP/Empire gets top 3.    Secret: Have simply been the best team in the last 6 months. They have both the mechanical skill and understanding of the game to go all the way, they have 5 extremely experienced players who know how to win. Overwhelmingly the favourite going into TI. EG: Since their win at DAC they have been a #1-2 team, however they have dropped quite a few games to teams they shouldn't have but then going and beating teams like VP/C9 VERY convincingly. Its likely they haven't been putting 100% focus on their performance during the last few months but I'm expecting another top 3 finish.  Empire: Historically have come into TI looking very strong and never performed up to expectations. While it could happen again, I feel their experience in international competitions this year will be extremely important in giving them confidence on the big stage. If they can play to their potential they can definitely finish top 6 at the very least.  VG: Seemingly the great hope for china this year, they haven't looked good every since their loss at DAC to EG however you simply can't count out a roster like VG's, they have so much experience and individual skill that they could turn up and completely obliterate their ways to the finals. I think based on their performances of the last few months placing them at 4th place is generous but honestly they could turn up and win the entire thing. If Hao has a good tournament, which if history is anything to go by, he definitely will - VG will definitely go far. VP: Much like Empire they have been on a tear recently, only losing to teams like EG/Secret/C9 and trading games with Empire. I feel like Empire and VP are so close to each other than either team could make a decent run but like always it depends on how either team shows up. If teams give illidan the space he can farm like nobody else on the planet and completely take over games however I worry about what happens to them if that doesn't happen.  iG: How can you count a team with BurNing out of a top 6 finish at TI? He has carried FAR worse teams to top 6 finishes in the past however I feel the competition this year is so much higher than previous years. This iG roster on paper has the potention to be one of the best if not the best in the world but their results have not good enough against arguably teams they should be beating. But its iG and its BurNing so who really knows.   That being said I honestly think that any team other than coL+wildcards with a bit of luck and a good run could get top 6-8, C9 for example could get top 3 but their games are always so clowny its impossible to predict what will happen. As much as I'd love N0tail to do well but I don't think EE's outlook on the game is tournament winning or stable enough to predict a top 3 finish."
dota2loungebets,3dx93m,sl_x,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:19:12 2015 UTC,"Great insight  I think iG is too predictable especially when you are versing great drafters like EG and Secret.

dota2loungebets,3dx93m,sl_x,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:42:41 2015 UTC,"I think with the strength na/eu teams this year and iG having practically no experience playing them it will mean iG, while being great at their roles individually, will struggle to adapt to how the teams play. Who knows maybe iG will play the game completely differently and it will surprise western teams but the fact is we don't know very much about them."

dota2loungebets,3djw9s,MattAvocado,7,Thu Jul 16 21:59:25 2015 UTC,"No. I recently switched to VPgame and it's so much better. More betting options with the f10k and handicaps. And when you win a bet, say for $2.50, you get a $2.50 item, not bunch of $.40 items like D2L. Also I would say the bots and servers are better. D2L bots and servers seem to take forever, especially during a LAN."

Yeah the tax kinda sucks but listing items on VPGame takes forever to sell unless you list it for a lower price and at that point, you might as well just take the steam tax.  Also everything pretty much sells quickly on steam, the most I've waited was only a few days for something of high value to sell."

dota2loungebets,3d3nlz,FortressX,4,Mon Jul 13 06:58:29 2015 UTC,PPD.. that salty motherfucker. What a drafter.
dota2loungebets,3d3nlz,straw28,2,Mon Jul 13 07:01:56 2015 UTC,"I feel like C9 was just experimenting in game 2. Game 1 was close up until that bad rosh fight, but C9 really had no reason to continue trying after being down 2-0 going into the third game with a server disadvantage. I still think C9 is a great team, just below Secret, slightly below EG, and better than the rest of the field, maybe close tie with LGD and iG, hard to gauge because east/western team. But they definately are the third best western team.  edit: I think C9 will finish 4th or 5th at TI. Maybe a personal power ranking/prediction thread later?"
dota2loungebets,3d3nlz,yooorick,1 point,Mon Jul 13 07:05:31 2015 UTC,I think Game 2 was played on Lux wasn't it? The moobot on twitch said servers were US/Lux/Us/Lux. Also how would you compare C9 to Empire and Na'Vi?
dota2loungebets,3d3nlz,yooorick,3,Mon Jul 13 07:07:56 2015 UTC,"Right, I'm saying even if they win lux, they most likely will have no chance in the next game versus EG on US, so they might as well just try and experiment (I went on EG -1.5 and small on EG -2.5 if that matters). They're still a good team, Secret and EG are just on another level at the moment. Remember last week C9 thrashed Virtus.pro also.  I'm not too sure how they compare to either of those teams as there's no H2H matchups recently but if chain logic holds at all, C9 should be stronger than both as they did just recently 3-1'ed VP, who has beaten Empire and Na'Vi multiple times as of late. Empire in general has looked shaky, probably doing the TI-time choke while Na'Vi just hasn't looked too impressive lately, and if Sonneiko is unable to attend, I really don't think they stand much of a chance. Na'Vi to me is the biggest wildcard in the group event, they have some AMAZING games (series vs Vega in qualifiers) and other times they just look like they have no clue what they're doing."

dota2loungebets,3d3nlz,DeusVaretyr,1 point,Mon Jul 13 07:42:31 2015 UTC,I still wanna believe that a chinese team would go against EG/Secret for finals. Oh well theyre underperforming too much. Or just really saving strats and look bad so secrekt underestimate them
dota2loungebets,3d3nlz,Bizarro-aka-WhOaMi,2,Mon Jul 13 11:33:58 2015 UTC,"Good read man, thanks :)"
dota2loungebets,3d3nlz,Bizarro-aka-WhOaMi,2,Mon Jul 13 09:01:17 2015 UTC,"I feel I am reading joindota or some announcer trying to explain a game he doesn't understand. @everyone  G1 - Missed first half but I know EE spammed a bit of Ember lately and from what I saw.. He made the mistakes of a 3k mid - runs around early, all over, getting a few kills but having 0farm 25+ mins (getting solod by aui lol).  G2 - nothing too crazy. Standard Gyro for EE with OD being a bit uncharacteristic, however, I feel they would try anything to win lane vs Sumails QoP.   Off topic:  All this talk about ""Sumail"" only playing a few heroes..  It's inaccurate. He plays some heroes at a higher level - like ALL players - is 15/16 and crushing mids with years of professional experience over him.   Everyone tilts harder on their non sig heroes.   Discuss?  EDIT (gonna be long)    What was the main issue with C9 during the series?   I don't want to be a cliche' or broken record but c9 is doing c9.  Most inconsistent team I've watched in the last two years.  There draft was obviously not try hard or geared to this meta (dota pit 3 GF), however there teamwork in general was sloppy and individually the same mistakes were repeated.    How would you describe the support duo of Misery and Notail in C9?   This Misery is not the same Misery from a few months back (Starladder).  He was out of position, a lot, poor rotations.. he just doesn't look the same.  Notail will come through, and he will fuck up (who doesn't?) overall one of the players with the least variance, imho.      Who is the most imactful player in EG?   EG are not the best (or 2nd w/e you want) looking team going into TI5 because of individual skill (which they have) but their understanding of DOTA, teamwork, and strategy is what wins Championships.  Sumail, as with any mid, should be the most ""impactful"" for spectators, positive or negative.  I fear he will get more confident stomping c9 like that and as an EG fan I am not thrilled.  I want the Sumail from his SF vs VP game, methodical, calculating, doesn't die :)    How do you think these teams will perform during TI?   EG will be in the winners bracket, top 4 going in for sure.  c9 I won't even try except they should get top 8+.     What is your opinion on the Game 1 Advantage? Should they be removed?   Stupid in a Grand Final.  The bonus for winning the upper bracket should = less games and more time to study your opponent, only.  Yes.    How many bugattis did you win?   What's a Bugatti?  x))"
dota2loungebets,3d3nlz,rivatia,1 point,Tue Jul 14 04:16:48 2015 UTC,"I appreciate your thoughts, just try not to be so rude next time. This is meant to be a discussion and not the ""correct"" analysis. In game 1 EE actually did get farm but he got solod by Aui because Aui had a good start and managed to get a few items up. Secondly I never mentioned SumaiL only plays a few heroes. I just brought the point that when he is playing one of his favourite heroes like QoP and SF, it is easier for him to have a game impact and do well, rather than something he rarely plays with the team. Please remember again none of us are professional players or analysts here. Just because you don't agree doesn't mean ""we don't understand"""

dota2loungebets,3cvjic,raizen0106,4,Sat Jul 11 03:16:07 2015 UTC,"Looks like over half of these bets are on f10k.  If that's the case I have zero sympathy as even in the best situation this is the riskiest bet bar none.  If you have shit you don't want to lose, don't bet it on f10k."
dota2loungebets,3cvjic,TheCaptainNemo,1 point,Sat Jul 11 03:54:03 2015 UTC,"Probably because of the payouts. Lets say you win 5$, D2L gives you a bunch of items that add's up to 5$ while VPgame gives a single 5$ item. So in the long run its 'probably' safer to use d2l if you dont have a good bankroll management.Just my personal opinion. :)"

What I realized is in vp game is, if you lose once, you tend to go a bit risky on the next F10K which leads to further loss or just blurs your logic and leads you into further yolos. I stuck to 5% and 8% bets and then it became fine though."
dota2loungebets,3cvjic,plank80,1 point,Sat Jul 11 04:42:20 2015 UTC,"There'are multiple times bet, handicap, f10k, sports..... Ofc you will do much worse on VPgame."
dota2loungebets,3cvjic,Papammmy,1 point,Sat Jul 11 04:51:31 2015 UTC,"Your biggest bets are all first ten kills. Why man? There isn't a sustainable plan to grow bankroll betting on F10K. It's random, and further more, it doesn't really matter in the end. It's kind of like Corners bet in soccer. Risky as fuck and doesn't affect the outcome of the game. Good luck further."
dota2loungebets,3cvjic,rhln,1 point,Sat Jul 11 05:33:16 2015 UTC,Doing worse by only betting on vpgame is expected. They take a cut out of the odds where d2l does not. This would add up if you bet a lot and over time the average bettor would have a significantly worse performance on vpgame.   In addition to this this the f10k and the way you can bet 4 times on one account can serve problematic if you're on tilt. I'm personally down 2k on vpgame where I am up 1.2k on d2l. I just use vpgame for odds comparison now.
dota2loungebets,3cvjic,boomerandzapper,1 point,Sat Jul 11 06:44:21 2015 UTC,"VPgame offers a lot more bets (f10k,normal,handicap) which means a lot more chances of you winning or losing. I have bet on both d2l and just recently moved to VPgame. I can say that I have been doing better in VPgame. Remember the risks of having multiple bets (f10k,normal,handicap) on 1 game. They do yield more if you win but if you don't that's losing 4 bets all at the same time.  This week I have just been betting on football and basketball matches and abstaining on most of the dota2 games since they have been mostly chinese and sea matches. I find the stats of both football and basketball to be a lot more reliable (except that spain match). Remember if you're on a tilt, don't go full yolo on your next bets."
dota2loungebets,3cvjic,drunkmessi,1 point,Sat Jul 11 07:27:32 2015 UTC,"When I was o fire on D2L (+1400 in 2 months) I did horribly on VP (-250) and for the life of me, I coudln't figure out why whenever I bet on VP I always lost  I also struggled a bit when switching to VP completely, but VP was just perfect for bankroll management with 6 item per bet and 4 bet for game limits. I'd say I did OK VP (up 2750 from -250 at the beginning of June)"
dota2loungebets,3cvjic,talawas,1 point,Sat Jul 11 07:49:03 2015 UTC,Once I joined VPGame I actually started to win more. I think the fact that it shows you your earnings and the handicaps which helps.
dota2loungebets,3cvjic,FortressX,1 point,Sat Jul 11 09:36:20 2015 UTC,"I've had more luck on VP and yolo. I bet small, like on F10Ks, handicaps, and single games with small items, and prefer slowly growing my account. I like having new items in my account in <1hr, makes life peachy. D2L makes me literally rage when I lose, and they're just way behind the times with the betting options. I only go on D2L for chinese DOTO, I will never for the life of me understand the insanely skewed odds, so I just bet junk there."

If you think LVT wins 70/30 or so (much more reasonable imo) I would only bet on vpgame handicap for LVT as 0.2:1 returns on d2l is terrible for a tier 2.5 NA team vs a similar tier team."

dota2loungebets,3cr3jc,troll322,1 point,Fri Jul 10 20:13:39 2015 UTC,"I saw them play, their mid and one of their supports are decent but the rest of the team sucks. They do rotations smokes,etc so they might have a chance. Leviathan completely trashed UG and Ehug.  Pain might have improved because their series vs Unkown was their first as a team but who knows"
dota2loungebets,3cr3jc,hewhobets1,1 point,Fri Jul 10 20:23:37 2015 UTC,Well thats weird.3-4 months ago Shibby (Leviathan's mid) was the burden of the team he was even tower hugging midlane against zeus.I guess things change.I have been a fan of pain since the ppdsalt.So you think pain can take a game.?Personally I think pain can also take this series xaxa but who knows about the ping.

dota2loungebets,3cj7ov,AlfredTFM,12,Wed Jul 8 09:39:41 2015 UTC,Recently there have been an increase in posters asking for updates of games in daily threads.     And there was a reason for that - ESCC league matches (and significant amount of them) were not available in TrackDota. You could allow asking for updates for matches not tracked by TrackDota or for matches without proper streams.
dota2loungebets,3cj7ov,TheCaptainNemo,1 point,Wed Jul 8 10:15:48 2015 UTC,Yeah this is worth mentioning.  Non-ticketed matches are very hard to find updates for since you can't use trackdota.
dota2loungebets,3cj7ov,nevermindthebbb,10,Wed Jul 8 15:21:54 2015 UTC,"why not just follow the r/csgobetting format? every game has its own thread, all info/predictions/shittalking/circlejerking etc pertinent to that game alone gets posted on its own thread. much less work for the mods as you dont really need to delete anything and its much less chaotic"
dota2loungebets,3cj7ov,FortressX,1 point,Wed Jul 8 12:07:08 2015 UTC,"Actually it would result in more work for the mods, because they have to make a single thread for each game.

dota2loungebets,3cj7ov,HuskUrsa,5,Wed Jul 8 13:14:46 2015 UTC,Thank you. 800 twitch chat like comments on a daily thread is not okay.
dota2loungebets,3cj7ov,Esg876,3,Wed Jul 8 11:41:27 2015 UTC,"Why not do what you tried before, have the prediction thread and a discussion thread.  If you make what can be posted in the prediction thread more lenient (IE questions are allowed, but asking for predictions, updates, etc are not) it might be better.  I believe users didn't enjoy it last time because they could not ask predictors questions?  Regardless I would like to give it another shot.  A second option would be to have one overall prediction thread that ONLY PREDICTIONS GO IN.  And then have match threads like cs:go where users can talk more in depth about the game.  So in this situation the prediction thread would only have maybe 5-20 comments depending on how many people predict allowing users to get an easy overview if they want one, and more in-depth/discussion in each match thread if they want that as well.  I don't want to only have match threads because I usually only glance at overall predictions when I do check the sub, and having to check each individual thread is not something I would enjoy doing."

dota2loungebets,3cj7ov,tRYSIS3,2,Wed Jul 8 09:44:47 2015 UTC,"I wanted to make a thread on this topic but instead i'll just post my thoughts right here:  I think that match updates should be allowed in this sub for many reasons and ill just list 2 here (i know my formatting/grammar is not that good but you get the idea):  1- People come to this sub to post their predictions and bets, follow others and discuss those predictions. So its only logical that people who betted on a game might need to get updated. Here comes the ""check elsewhere"" argument, which i think is not logical at all. People bet on Soccer/basketball/Dota games how is anyone supposed to follow everything (is it easier to check 10 sources or just 1) ? when many of those matches can be hard to find streams for and some are not even streamed. And that's just for the sports matches. Many Dota games are not even available on trackdota/gosugamers/d2l how are people supposed to follow those ?  2-This in my opinion is the biggest reason we need updates on this sub. F10K ! f10k predictions mainly rely on a team's performance so how can someone bet on those if he has no idea how a team is playing ? and how can people discuss those predictions if there is often no time to bet between matches and people have to bet during the game ?"
dota2loungebets,3cj7ov,tRYSIS3,1 point,Wed Jul 8 10:00:19 2015 UTC,"This is a fair point. I'd like to mention that we would only be moderating this sort of thing in the daily Dota thread, not the one for other sports.   Regarding f10k, how would you or others suggest as a way to follow that if you couldn't do so by reading comments in a daily thread? To me, it seems really ineffective to have to wait on someone to post a reply to update me on the kills or score of a match when I could readily find this information on my own."
dota2loungebets,3cj7ov,hewhobets1,1 point,Wed Jul 8 10:04:25 2015 UTC,"Regarding f10ks, people often post updates during matches which others can use to decide their bets and having an idea how a team is performing is better than not having any info at all, right ?  Also what about the matches that can only be watched on DotaTV how is anyone supposed to follow those ?  My suggestion is to create a daily thread for match discussions or leave it as it is."
dota2loungebets,3cj7ov,Luffy_,1 point,Wed Jul 8 10:18:03 2015 UTC,What about people go to vp game and check if the f10k bet is already cleared?
dota2loungebets,3cj7ov,Fuzzyboots-,2,Wed Jul 8 11:02:05 2015 UTC,I am willing to volunteer for making the daily threads for each individual dota game just like at the csgobetting subreddit.  And it just so happens that I reside in the right time zone. Mods please consider this.
dota2loungebets,3cj7ov,Trilles,2,Wed Jul 8 13:24:37 2015 UTC,"This. After losing interest and skins on CSGO betting, I've made quite a bit off Dota betting, but there's no ACTUAL resources to do research. You can look up match history, but I can't find anywhere for standins, or league status. I've only won because Dota betting seems to almost always be the overdog wins. I'd still like threads to be posted to actually discuss with other users instead of looking at the cesspit that is Disqus, Twitch or misinformation in Joindota/Gosu comments"
dota2loungebets,3cj7ov,ThePa1nfulTruth,2,Wed Jul 8 17:57:20 2015 UTC,"rx25, a good option for the people on mobile phones with really slow internet (not capable of loading images and videos, another option that I like is http://www.datdota.com/live.php You can also see there the %winrate for teams with such advantage @gametime so that you understand how well a team is doing.

I've been lurking this sub for ages and it really made me sad to see that even though match threads got 500+ responses, in some cases noone in the whole thread made predictions.  Maybe making a new post (in the daily thread) for every match (dota2 or sports) would make reading the daily thread more bearable. But this requires constant updates by moderators so maybe not doable. Maybe allow downvoting comments so we can downvote the Bugatti spammers?"

dota2loungebets,3cj7ov,kawy8889,1 point,Wed Jul 8 13:47:09 2015 UTC,"I understand the motive behind the change, but I personally find it unnecessary or short-sighted for several reasons:  1). Reddit already has a function for sorting comments. This is how I managed the daily threads when I either wanted to read match predictions/analysis vs. actual match discussion. Any user can simply sort their comments by TOP for the top posts, usually analysis or an update vs. NEW, which has actual discussion of the matches taking place.  2). D2L ""Disqus"" feature and related sites/features are cesspools of misinformation, trolls, and literally illiterate garbage. Most of the comments are broken English, if English at all. The comments are just barely above twitch chat, and are often intentionally misleading and inaccurate.   3). With the discouragement of predictions and higher moderation of match discussion, daily threads risk turning in to little more than poster boards of the daily matches, void of discussion or analysis. Already the daily ""winnings"" threads and ""losses"" threads see just a handful of comment if any. If we want to talk about clutter within the subreddit, these are two great candidates for removal.  4). Attempting to divide the subreddit, or sending people to a dota2match discussion subreddit is a terrible idea. You are literally sending people away, removing your pageviews, clicks, comments, upvotes, etc. It is an active way of removing eyeballs and interaction from your subreddit.  Solutions   Consider how /r/NBA and /r/NFL handle their equivalent ""daily match"" threads. Every game or ""match,"" has it's own thread. Think ""Cleveland Cavaliers vs. Chicago Bulls Game Thread"" where all discussion on that match takes place. Then, there is a ""POST Cleveland Cavaliers vs. Chicago Bulls Game Thread"" for people to discuss what happened in the game, try and provide insight into the result, why a team won/loss, etc. This helps keep discussions on particular matches specific to that thread. These threads are created by the users not the moderators. Also, threads are appropriately tagged per their content. The only role of the moderators is deleting repetitious match threads, and creating and implementing the thread tagging system. In the end, it keeps comments specific to specific topics, and prevents bleed-over or random comments from cluttering the page."

I would suggest you to break your items into 20 items of even prices and bet no more than 1 item per match. Aim to increase your inventory by 5% a day. With your inventory value if you are able to 5% increase for 60 days, you will end up with $3000 in 2 months. Ofcourse not all the days will be successful but you will eventually end up growing big. I started with $60 and sitting at $16K. I had lot of bad patches(My longest losing streak is 20 matches) and my overall win ratio is just 51% for the past 7 months but with proper bankroll managements and going for the odds rather than who will actually win the match, I was able to hit this mark"

dota2loungebets,3cbop5,Divinations,2,Tue Jul 7 00:58:16 2015 UTC,"I think under has won most bets now and most people have caught up with that. As this is summer league, the games are not 48 mins but 40 (that's why the over/under is lower). Now, most of these players are not that great as the main nba players, that's why they miss more and  thus scores are lower. Nonetheless, one can make the same argument towards the defense players, as they are more likely to let the others shoot, so be careful if there's an outstanding player in a team or if they end up going to overtime."

dota2loungebets,3cbop5,przeraza,2,Tue Jul 7 13:34:41 2015 UTC,Bro nobody blames you... you at least bother to research for us and provide us with insights which most of us are lazy to do... I know many of us have won loads because of you... please don't feel bad... you're still the king of betting here :)
dota2loungebets,3cbop5,AlfredTFM,3,Tue Jul 7 13:38:49 2015 UTC,"From what I've read here today, you guys SERIOUSLY need to learn bankroll management. Reading that people are betting over $20 on Chinese Soccer is actually ridiculous. Even if you win, what's the endgame? You don't know enough about it to profit, so you're actually just rolling dice - which always ends in defeat eventually. You're trusting someone else - which is fine, but only if you know how to use that trust independently.   It's about knowing when to bet, when not to bet BUT ABOVE ALL HOW MUCH TO BET. Throwing $60 on Chinese Soccer is actually stupid unless you have a bankroll of above $600. Stop jumping on trains and bet sensibly. xJelz would have won everyone a lot of money if you consistently bet on him being right, rather than knee-jerk betting high on shit you know nothing about.  Please... for the future of your bankrolls and for Ti5... read some of the key topics on the subreddit and learn about how you profit, otherwise excellent predictors like him are wasted.  Imagine if you put $10 on every one of his bets, rather than $60 on one, that would be a 6-2 W:L for the day and a serious day's profit.   Best case is you win most of your YOLOs and sit on a high bank - what then? YOLO more? Or will you learn how to bet properly then? I'm not an amazing bettor but I know how to not YOLO, and that means I'll be here a lot lot longer than most of you.   /rant because I want to save you guys some rares.   Great stuff today xJelz!"
dota2loungebets,3cbop5,hewhobets1,2,Tue Jul 7 13:40:45 2015 UTC,"I would say abstain these summer league games as these are young players playing for the first time together, and they are all trying to prove themselves so they make some questionable plays."

Like, what do these changes actually tell you, why do they matter. I don't want you to reveal any of your secrets and knowledge, just very short and general idea of this way of betting. I'm really curious, gotta ask ;D"
dota2loungebets,3cbop5,tId3I3rInGeR,1 point,Mon Jul 6 20:16:32 2015 UTC,"It doesn't tell you anything. Big bettors move odds with their bets, and self-respecting bettors won't bet on cointoss matches of low-skilled players. Odds movement can tell you that someone with a big bank has some inside information (not necessarily illegal, some simple things like injuries, stand-ins, etc.) Take yesterday's game of C9 vs VP. VP was a heavy favourite 5 hours before the game (on D2L) - I think many bettors were trying to skew the odds because it became 50-50 in the end. Some people switched their bets because of the swing. And remember, you can not predict a result. It's a gamble."

Okafor supposed to be playing for sixers, and in college this kid was so beast on offense. He's got amazing post moves and good footwork.

dota2loungebets,3cbop5,bkop,1 point,Mon Jul 6 22:07:42 2015 UTC,"Jazz vs Celtics   No one amazingly hype here. Marcus Smart is a starter for the Celtics but it's hard to gauge how good he is in summer league. He'll probably have better stats going up vs weaker opponents but he's inherently inconsistent at times. Depending on Celt's priorities he might get less playing time as well to see how their recent draft picks hold up in summer league.  Jazz list Dante Exum and Alec Burks in their summer league lineup and these guys are definitely NBA tier guards. It's hard to say if they're listing full summer league roster though since theres not many players listed.   Honestly hard to say though. On paper probably just go for the underdog, although I'm slightly favoring Boston just cus I like their draft of RJ Hunter."

dota2loungebets,3cd5kr,miku96,1 point,Tue Jul 7 00:34:12 2015 UTC,/r/dota2trade you should sell it off here for paypal or a normal tb and sweets. It is definitely harder to sell.

dota2loungebets,3cd5kr,kenshi3,1 point,Tue Jul 7 06:21:00 2015 UTC,"of course, PayPal is the most dangerous way to trade, I wouldn't recommend it if u are new to the trading scene.  We can't tell for sure one is a scammer but jus avoid trading with new account, low game played hour, bad reps, banned on steam rep,  cheap inventory.  /r/dota2trade is not scam proof, ask for a middleman if u don't feel safe make sure to use middleman on steamrep or /r/dota2trade ONLY.  You can find many familiar name in /r/dota2trade, as many user lurk here too. They will be happy to help"

dota2loungebets,3cd5kr,Lambda_Senpai,0,Tue Jul 7 11:36:08 2015 UTC,"First step is do not accept any other form of payment than friends and family on paypal . I think that's harder or even impossible to contest !   Other than that , you need to trade with people who have a few years under their belt on reddit or steam ( sadly for steam i've even seen people with 7 or 8 years scam others so at the moment im only trusting people with like 9 or 10 years ) , high level on steam ( at least 25 or more ) and lots of games and items . The more money they have and spend the more likely the trade will be legit ."

dota2loungebets,3camh1,LargeFeline,1 point,Mon Jul 6 12:22:03 2015 UTC,"I think it could go both ways as well.. but with the odds in the area, I think that fact is expressed very well. I mean the odds are what they are for a reason. If any odd is between 40-60% win chance, anything can happen. Even until mid sixties it is very shaky.   I will go small on C9 because they have the better odds. In this situation the risk is nearly equal no matter on which team you beat. C9 is a better bet though cause if you win, you get more."
dota2loungebets,3camh1,Sluethi,1 point,Mon Jul 6 12:58:46 2015 UTC,"I agree. I will most likely be abstaining and from the past few matches, C9 have not been taking this tournament seriously.

dota2loungebets,3c89vl,mervynngwaihong,1 point,Sun Jul 5 22:01:43 2015 UTC,"Women's World Cup Final: US- Japan  We have a repeat of the 2011 final and the extremely well conditioned and prepared Japanese team have proved that win was no fluke and that they are perhaps the best team in the world and few will doubt that if they win this evening. In that previous final they twice came from behind to tie the US, including once in extra time and showed incredible mental strength to do so, I do not think that any other team in world football , would have been able to do so under similar circumstances. My preview of their quarter final win over Australia is reproduced below, that includes my pre tournament notes about how well prepared the Japanese were and how seriously they have taken their role as world champions and they have loved the four years since and I feel that once again they have been seriously underestimated by the oddsmakers and that there is no huge gulf between the two. Of course, this is not a coinflip as the US will have massive support in Vancouver, but Japan have already played here three times and will feel very much at home in stadium and city.They were disappointing against England in the semis, but I think that was the match in which all the pressure was on them, now it is very much on the US, they are going to have to make the running and they will be very vulnerable to the speed and technical ability of the Japanese. I think we might well see extra time again and I am happy to take .....

Imo CDEC and Vega will definitely show us a hell of a game in TI wildcard and eventually advances to join the others.  Though its saddening to see Vega constantly without their full lineup, it is surprising to see that they did well even with so many different standins! They've definitely improved and I believe this year's TI will be a lot more interesting than last year's push strategy, fml rofl .    Finally, I think VP will win this game tonight as well, but Empire would show them a hell of a fight, so it would be VP wins 3-2."

There is a table and it says ""Handicap"" in one coloumn and the line below, a coloumn to the left are the 2 teams of the match. right of that it says ""+1.5"" and ""-1.5"", right of that are the odds for the respective handicap bet. +1.5 means the team in question gets 1.5 points added to their score (so in a Bo3 winning 2-1 with +1.5 would put the team at 3.5-1), same goes for -1.5.   The odds are what multiple of your stake you get as payout. 1.51 would mean you get 1.51x your stake as payout, so 0.51x your stake as winnings. If you want to compare these odds to what they have on D2L or vpgame, you have to substract 1.  The coloumn to the right ""money line"" are the odds for the respective team winning the whole match."

Theres an small room for doubt since they draft the exact same every game but the most peculiar thing is that they keep swapping the drafter during the series which in my opinion means that they dont agree with each other so they agreed on that just to keep the team functioning but every time they switch they get stomped in 20 minutes.  At the same time they were winning everything when all the teams were at their weakest so maybe it just other teams stepping up

I see your Vega flair and I'm curious how you feel, I think Solo and Mag especially are very good at Dota and I'm a fan of watching them play, but it often feels like the supports have to spend so much effort helping No[o]ne mid to go even in the lane that they end up losing other lanes. His plays later in the game are good, I just wish he could be a more consistent mid laner >.<"

dota2loungebets,3bbovu,pisfan,1 point,Sun Jun 28 02:39:53 2015 UTC,Edit:  Nevermind I found you.  If you're talking about the inventory attached to your flair in /r/dota2trade.. it's 5-8$ USD
dota2loungebets,3bbovu,Bizarro-aka-WhOaMi,1 point,Sat Jun 27 19:38:57 2015 UTC,"Easy way - sell all skins on market, buy keys, wait one week, and sell keys. You'll lost about 35% of the item value, but it's quick. Also pretty safe, as long as you sell the keys to reputable vendor. These guys are making a living out of it, so they won't risk ruining their career by stealing your keys.  Harder way - trade items to keys on dota2lounge and similar and then sell the keys. You will probably lose a smaller portion of value, but you need to endure the living hell that is D2L traders, which will haggle for 30 minutes over 10 cent profit.   Hardest way - find someone who will buy your whole backpack. It's not that hard actually, but people will try to rip you off mercilessly. On the other side, it's probably the quickest way, but also most risky, as item buyers aren't that reputable as key buyers."
dota2loungebets,3bbovu,Smolda,1 point,Sat Jun 27 20:14:55 2015 UTC,what to do once i hit limit of 200 sales? i actually already did.  (steam market)

It seems like vpgame's site goes 'down' every once in a while and that's probably the problem, you just have to check and recheck every time you switch. Anyway, I know someone who lost like 800 value (?? not sure exact amount) on one game because of this. He contacted vpgame support, and they replied saying something along the lines of 'you clicked too fast, which made you switch twice'.. You can still try to contact support though......."

I felt for this trap so many time. Now what I do is, I start with 3% bet on any match (BO3 and BO5) that I want to play, then if I lose the first game I will skip that match entirely no matter how convinced I am about the next game. Then I take at least 5 min of silence to only think if I am tilting then I can move forward. Also limiting your max bet to 5% seems to be a good idea, at worst case you lose about 4-5 bets in a row (and assuming these are all ""sure win""  but you lost nevertheless) then you should definitely take a break. By following this rule I have never lost more than 15% of my bankroll in any single day"

My Cat had huge success luck mainly since she bet on her favorite team, who was boasting a 74% WR in pro dota.   Fast forward to Nov. 2014. My cat was spending every waking moment betting. My cats lifestyle had changed and was noticeable to her friends and eventually herself.   She had one of the longest ""runs"" I've witnessed on Esports. Eventually, the lack of balance in her life got to her. My cat was smart and self-aware enough to notice. She trade banned herself on all accounts for 7 days by changing their e-mails.   For fun and research my cat documented each bet she would've made (for as far as she could) and then took her one week break.   My cat believes this saved her from a massive ""fuck up"" of monumental proportions (relative).    My cat is sharing her expierence, strength, and hope for the rest of the day.

Low maxbets, (though finals can go up to $2000 per bet).  betway.com = the bigger betting company based in the UK. Max bets are usually 300-600 euros, you need confirmation though.

BTC sites like nitrogen are the only I've found and trusted to pay out with no restrictions. However, max bet can be as small as .2 btc (50$) to as high ad 2.0 BTC 450-500$. This is per handicap, map, etc. So, you could put max bet on the moneyline, handicap, and map 1, 2, 3, etc if you wanted.   All online bookies that accept U.S. are not for any sharp ""punter"" aka bettor. They have some of the latest lines to come to market and will charge 5% per deposit and another 5% per withdrawal.   Main reason being - online bookmakers like Pinnacle, 5dimes, all whom refuse U.S. clients is due to they refuse to pay the U.S. Government tax and give it all tp their local govenment. It's pretty bullshit and hurt them a lot more than taxes would (at least in the start, according to a lot of data - depending what you believe and can verify yourself).  To answer your question  Where you live, has a lot to do with the ""best"".  I'd suggest BTC sites like nitrogen that have proven on the blockchain they have the coins to payout.

dota2loungebets,3azn8z,nevermindthebbb,1 point,Wed Jun 24 20:49:34 2015 UTC,"For me I make a bracket of brankroll, for example I started off with 200$ BR, my next BR goal is 400, as soon as I've made 400$ profit, I put 200$ aside (often cashing out) and the other 200$ I put back to BR and double it to 400$. And my 1-3-5% don't change from bets to bets but rather from bracket to bracket. If I lose I will reduce my BR to a lower bracket and go from there). Changing amount of max bet after every actual bet does make sense though, it just sounds exhausting to keep track for me personally."

Since you are not betting against the house, it is easier to find skewed odds (often one team being a popular team with huge fan base, and people bet on them out of fanboyism despite of their recent performance i.e. Empire/Navi/Alliance and so on)  I do believe that even though I can't beat complex predictive model made by Pinnacle and such, I CAN beat a biased population and make something out of this.

Noone used to say that in the past, posts like this are plain retarded. I don't mean to point out anyone on purpose, because lots of people actually do this. It makes zero sense at all to say this..  Some people bet by playing around the odds, for example, some people just love looking at bookie odds or thinking about the 'odds' themselves for the slight edge.  Some people bet by pure intuition, they bet on the team they think will win, regardless of odds.  Some bet while using a combination of both.. And more......  But in both these two cases, it is absolute BULLSHIT to say 'bet on the heavy favourite if you're going to make a huge bet, otherwise don't bother'. Why, you may ask? Because if you actually suggested a bet, for most people you would actually think either its good odds or that the team will win. Otherwise its posts like ICB.. (Well not relevant in this case) What's even dumber is the fact that I have seen some people (or just one, I really dunno) claim to bet for the 'slight edge' but say the exact same thing about betting on heavy favourites. This is just dumb man, especially considering the fact that some of these people probably aren't even making huge bets.  Come, I am ready for my downvotes and any sort of critical post condemning me."
dota2loungebets,3avsa4,pisfan,2,Wed Jun 24 01:31:32 2015 UTC,"I agree. TLDR version of your post =  No one calls anyone on their bullshit  I wish we could remove downvoting like on /r/ama , it's worthless here.  As for people claiming to have an ""edge"" on D2L / VPG do not understand the term.  An edge in sports betting refers to placing your bet on the best odds (whenever and who ever has them).  Since, D2L / VPG move their lines almost equal to ""value"" bet on each side, (a luxury any competitve bookmaker does not have the luxury of doing -  Vegas and the big 3 365, pinny, and heritage are the only ones I l know creating their own lines), the only way to get ""an edge"" by defenition, is to bet at the very last second or switch teams (if odds are favorable, last second).  This still does not offer anything compared to placing a wager on an outcome and have it locked. These 2 sites allowing bets to be changed, imho, is absurd and lazy.   Another down side is missing arbitrage opportunities - if you're strictly item betting. If you found one you'd have huge risk in the fact the odds would move and fuck you, defeating the purpose.   I am getting in 2-5 arbitrage bets a day at the moment. I'd like to get more but I've already been limited twice.  We need ""beards"" and ""runners"".  TLDR  Don't co-sign bullshit, you're not only hurting yourself but all involved parties"

dota2loungebets,3avsa4,H20onthego,2,Wed Jun 24 04:28:39 2015 UTC,"Nowadays I keep seeing posts saying something similar to ""odds are bad, if you're not gonna go hugeeeeee don't bother betting""... Noone used to say that in the past, posts like this are plain retarded. I don't mean to point out anyone on purpose, because lots of people actually do this. It makes zero sense at all to say this..   I think that has more to do with the fact D2L doesn't pay out well enough to warrant trying to win $10. However if your payout was $30, go for it you might get an arcana."
dota2loungebets,3avsa4,Ice_Cream_Warrior,1 point,Wed Jun 24 03:06:56 2015 UTC,"I agree that for the most part it is an logical fallacy of the odds are bad don't bet on them unless big bank roll, except for a couple of factors make it an alright play with say a $1000 bankroll compared to a smaller one. D2L fan overpay the top winners on max bettors in certain scenarios that can increase returns to these max bettors. A person with a much larger bankroll can take a max bet hit much better than a smaller bank where there max bet might be 60% or higher of their bankroll and if the off chance the upset occurs they might be out of betting more or less. These top bettors even if they are still the odd time losing $300+ they have a big enough bankroll that with smart betting the loses are easier to recuperate and are losing a smaller percentage of their bank, even if the amount is much higher. Many of these 85-15 and up games are less likely than odds for favourite to lose, but it doesn't make sense with a small bank to all-in on the 90+% favourite when there returns are going to be trash if they aren't a high bettor (you will frequently get under returned on these bets and more likely to get like 12 trash items) on the 10% chance you lose it all. Compared to a max bettor who is betting $400+ they are not all in if they lose and have the ability to get battle furies, staches and more.   It doesn't completely make up the safety of the odds always but there are factors that make it a safer bet if you will for affluent bettors compared to anyone under a couple hundred bucks."
dota2loungebets,3avsa4,FortressX,3,Wed Jun 24 19:51:25 2015 UTC,"Thanks for this post, I think it's a great idea. I recently joined this subreddit and started betting and it's been great help. Everyone has been friendly and I have gotten some great advice from people here. I think one of the main issues is that there simply isn't enough people commenting and giving their predictions. However, I feel like this would change as we approach TI.    As for the subreddit itself, I think the ""rage inducing losses"" and ""winnings"" daily posts are unnecessary and offer nothing to the subreddit itself. I can see how the ""rage"" posts might be good to keep out people complaining in the main one but I still think it is a waste. Furthermore, for big tournaments (like TI), it might be worth creating a separate post for those matches. For example: ""The International 5 - Playoffs Day 6 instead of [August 3rd, 2015]"". This would help if there are other random matches from other tournaments during The International (they can go in the daily match posts). It would also be a direct link for people who only want to talk about TI matches.    Another useful thing might be a ""post-match/tournament"" discussion, similar to /r/Dota2 (e.g. ""The International 5 - Playoffs Post-Day 6 Discussion"". This way people won't have to go to the original match post to give their thoughts on the matches and don't have to head over to /r/Dota2 which is already filled with comments.     Overall I think the mods and the people actively participating in the subreddit are doing great. There is a very friendly atmopshere created. This is all just my opinion as well, so take it as you will."

I can see how the ""rage"" posts might be good to keep out people complaining in the main one but I still think it is a waste   These were implemented a long time ago, and started because there were too many of these posts in the Daily Threads, and we wanted to split those two up because there was a lot of bragging and unneccessary clutter in places where discussion should be held      Furthermore, for big tournaments (like TI), it might be worth creating a separate post for those matches.

I'll definetly put more effort in future surveys question- and answer-wise but for this little ""homework""-project it should be detailed enough.  Could you please elaborate which questions and answers need changes. If you want in a personal message.  Thanks for your input!"
dota2loungebets,3at4f4,ru40342,4,Tue Jun 23 09:51:25 2015 UTC,"problems: question 1 is unnecessary, question 3 is manipulative, question 5-6 are unclear (how do you define ""major""?), question 7 requires better answers, question 8-10 categorical problems (you will have problems when you run your data), question 10 has error in answers provided (where are losses options?)  It all depends on depth of analysis you wish to do. If you simply wana go for descriptive analysis, ignore some technical errors but if you wana go deeper, i'd say you need to re-do the questionnaire."
dota2loungebets,3at4f4,ru40342,2,Tue Jun 23 10:21:38 2015 UTC,"Questions 1 and 3 (dumb questions humans,especially the target group, can easily answer) are demanded by the homework task description.  The games 5-6 were chosen upon the possibility to bet money on. These are the games to have a known betting scene/services. If you feel betting related games are left out I am more than pleased to be enlightened.  7-10 These were categories i thought would be sufficient. In hindisight a higher granularity and a bigger range in the higher up regions are needed because there are several answers that hit the maximum cap. and any further information is lost/can't be evaluated. When i created this survey i coulnd't imagine that these figures are hit that often.  To be honest i didn't think of a losses option. That's a big fault on my side. Thanks for pointing out.  As already stated it's not being used in any kind of research work. Just a simple weekly homework task. So the depth of detail should be fine though it could be better.  I'll consider your input for future surveys for sure."
dota2loungebets,3at4f4,rx25,3,Tue Jun 23 10:53:44 2015 UTC,"5-6: it is not important what games should be included, it is the structure of the questionnaire itself. If the question is unclear, how can you be sure you are getting reliable answers from samples? Hence, you have to be as clear as possible about your questions and answers. You can define the term ""major"" in the question itself.  7-10. The structure of your answers are questionable. Perhaps you should question yourself this: why do i need x answers and why is x answers has such ranges.  It is alright to make such mistakes, especially if you are new to primary data research or the project itself is simply a fun project. You will learn more in research method, if there is one."

dota2loungebets,3at4f4,hewhobets1,2,Tue Jun 23 15:24:41 2015 UTC,"Answered but your questions need a lot of work.   Instead of asking what your betting/making weekly, you should ask for an overall average instead.  For example, I often bet $10 per match, but I go up to around $400 maybe once a week or two, so my weekly bet amounts could be $0 if no real games I follow are happening, or in the case of TI5 qualifiers up to a thousand in one week.    Same issue with profit/loss.  It can be negative, positive, break even etc.  Asking for overall amounts is probably better, because most people don't track how they do week per week unless they are new, or they lost or won a big amount.  For example I never care what my weekly total is unless its a large negative number, and its very hard to actually find this if you use D2L to bet on.  Instead I just look at how I am trending and if what I am doing is working, or if I should take a break/change my method etc."

dota2loungebets,3asapd,tzontzonel,2,Tue Jun 23 02:44:32 2015 UTC,"How are you going to develop your jackpot site if you don't even know how to create a simple website? I saw your posts asking ""Which are the steps in buying a website?""  If you meant, ""How do I create a website?"" I can tell you this. You're going to have to start off with paying for a virtual private server (vps) at the very least for a site like yours. No, the cheaper shared web hosting plans don't work. You pay for a domain (url) for somewhere close to $10 a year, then you pay some more for this vps to host your site (and potentially bots) and then you will have to slowly upgrade as you get more traffic.. You also have to decide if you're going to have a managed or unmanaged vps, it makes all the difference (in both $$ and manageability).Then you design your site, program your bots etc. If this was your question, I highly recommend you just give up now, it is much more work than you think.  If you meant literally buying a website that already has what you want, could you possibly be referring to dotariskwin.com? In my opinion they are a shady as hell site, but of course different people have differing opinions. Also, even if you did go ahead with buying their site, you will have to contact them, do the thing properly in case you get scammed, as well as complete their site, that is to say fix their stupid exploits, bugs, and whatnot. You also have to redesign their system, because as far as I can see you seem to have wanted to have different pots so people can't come in and snipe pots.. Well, it might not be that hard but as far as I can tell you most likely don't have the aptitude for that.  In short, the pricing of items is the least of your worries. I imagine you having some friends who supposedly have some IT know-how and think it is easy money, but it is not (well it is if and only if you can make the site in the first place). If you are in any way affiliated with dotariskwin, well screw you man.  Anyway, to answer your question, you can consider simply ripping off vpgame's pricing on items, but that's not a very nice thing to do. (At least find out where their 'pricelist' is yourself)"
dota2loungebets,3asapd,pisfan,0,Tue Jun 23 03:02:38 2015 UTC,"I have followed your posts as well, especially for dotariskwin.com.  Before I start, without any sarcasm or offense, stop judging. I like the way you behave in this community, but by assuming stuff, you do not have to be so cynical and critical.  Although you brought very good arguments and a lot of useful info, out of which i kinda knew about 70% so to say, the ""tone"" in your writing had me thinking you were sort of rage typing.  I have a team of HTML/CSS + C# + AJAX + PHP experts with a history behind in programming, which are working for the website as we speak. Do not assume I have an IT know-how team or a Valve Super-Experts or w/e company which has badass programmers.  Also, my interest is to bring something fair to the people and to not give others the opportunity to use exploits.  Keep in mind that every website develops overtime, but I am trying to bring it online to the highest quality and with the most reduced number of bugs.  Regarding pricing, I'm not quite interested as it will be steam market based (since Dota2 doesnt have an OPskins or csgoanalyst website). As it will be steam market based, I asked for a betting item list, in order to exclude any unwanted and/or overpriced items.  In the end, my objective is to give the players a proportional and real chance based on their bet items(no snipperino pots) and to give the users a real value on which to cash out or continue to play.  Thank you very very much for the moral and tech advice. I do appreciate the time you used to write everything from above. :)"
dota2loungebets,3asapd,pisfan,2,Tue Jun 23 06:36:23 2015 UTC,"Hmm, I admit I made several assumptions (yes, I am both cynical and critical), but I was in no way rage typing. I typed with something similar to a sense of helplessness, as you are not the first one to propose creating a new site that is related to gambling -- and based on past experiences, they are mostly amateurs who give up eventually.  Anyway, as for vpgame's pricing, not only do they base their values on steam market, but they also mark items as bettable or un-bettable. I am referring to their $ pricing, not their V currency. The only problem with their pricing (or good thing about their pricing...) is that some of the 10 cent items and such may be valued at 1 cent.. So 'trash items' are considered to be trash there.  It's interesting how you continuously mention the word 'real'.. In the end, your site will likely still be profit based, except that it is more accommodating for the lower-end bettors.  In spite of what you said, however, I still think that you are an amateur. You may have a team of experts, but isn't it all hired labour?   A real team wouldn't need to ask how to 'buy a site'.."
dota2loungebets,3asapd,talawas,1 point,Tue Jun 23 06:52:55 2015 UTC,"Indeed a real team wouldn't need to ask how to 'buy a site', that was before i hired the team. :)   By that time, I wanted a website (dotariskwin) to rework it completely keeping the basic PHP gambling process and the bots.  I totally admit I'm an amateur in programming/coding, but as I'm and amateur, I want to bring to the team, all the info needed with which they can work out and in the same time bring a good experience for the users.  Thanks once again."

dota2loungebets,3aqc0g,Lucho505,6,Mon Jun 22 17:22:33 2015 UTC,"I'm no expert in this, but i think i can at least provide bits and pieces of the info that you are looking for.   VPGaming's rewards are more integrated compared to D2L: Giving maybe a $1.78 item + $0.22 item from a $2 return (VPG) compared to maybe a $1.1 item and x9 $0.10 item (in D2L). That gives your returns somewhat more beneficial since you would definitely earn more selling that one item compared to the fragments that you would get. And to scale that up, a single fury is definitely more valuable than 1 SF arcana and 69 loading screens. (but still it's 69 so.... ) Variety. VPG also gives F10K bets (first 10 kills) and Handicap bets for more aggressive / confident betters.  Not only that, you can bet 6 items (same as D2L), but you can bet up to 24 (6 items, 4 times) items on a single match. Sum that up with F10k bets and Handicap bets which naturally gives very good odds due to the risk of the bet allows these aggro-betters to earn a really really high bankroll (i'm sure you heard of peeps earning about 2k+++ on a single night).  All of these compared to D2L, which only let you do a 1 x 6 items bet.  And lets not forget point No.1. Management / service (?). I'm not really sure about this part since i'm neutral to comments and options most of the time but sometimes D2L's management on bet timings are abit sluggish (No fires here whatsoever, just an observation).  Example, if i can remember correctly there was one of the games which was already way deep into the drafting stage in game 1 (4CL vs Vega was it ? TAT correct me thanks !) But people can still switch bets, which is absurd. Not only that, after their DDOS-serino accident which postponed Game 3 to another date, people CAN SWITCH BETS YET AGAIN (for a very short while), which imo is very poor management and a very unfair deal indeed.  Match % =/= value returns. The %, if i'm not mistaken, only shows you how many peeps betted on that side (shell), while the returns will reflect or tell you the value that people has bet on (content).  I suck at this part but its roughly that... TAT      This is as far as i know, but i'm sure there are people who can provide better answers :) I Haz Tried TAT"
dota2loungebets,3aqc0g,Vidarru,1 point,Mon Jun 22 17:43:42 2015 UTC,"Dude that was great, thanks a lot"
dota2loungebets,3aqc0g,Esg876,4,Mon Jun 22 17:49:08 2015 UTC,"The biggest reason is D2L's lack of openness/communication/ever changing rules.  During the IG vs Cdec grand finals, it became known about 45 minutes prior to start time that cdec had a bo1 adv in a bo3 series.  VPG cancelled all the bets immediately and made new ones informing people of the bo1 advantage.    I posted in the D2L forum ~40 mins before it started to inform them of this, and considering in the past its always been cancelled when a 1 game advantage was not known, I wasn't too worried, and went to sleep.  I wake up to find my thread deleted, the game NOT cancelled, and considering I had bet about $150 on IG I was super pissed.  Yes IG won thankfully, but if I had lost $150 on an already terrible day I was going to probably just quit betting altogether or take a break till Ti5.     That's also just the tip of the iceberg.  Combine this with admins being asleep and not closing matches for hours, or even worse not cancelling bets after a game already had 6 kills happen or drafts finish and watching the bets change 5-10% is just too much.  I also asked the D2L admin in this subreddit about the cdec issue, and surprise no comment after a week.  Also you do lose % in D2L.  D2L's system is flawed and favors the biggest bettors, on games that are really skewed if you dont bet 6 battlefuries you dont get what your suppose to most of the time.  Its not always clearly evident, but I have had cases where on 90-10 games I am suppose to win ~$40 and only get $35 or less because of how their system works.  VPG takes 5%, but in every payout I have gotten exactly what I am supposed to, +/- 1 cent."
dota2loungebets,3aqc0g,Esg876,2,Mon Jun 22 17:57:48 2015 UTC,"Yes, that tends to happen to me as well, even with my bankroll  (sound 50usd bets) buy I've always thought that happened because of items prices fluctuating .... Also, do you know of the VP item price refresh rate ? Or is it like D2L, where you have the “certain item that has recently dropped in price"" season because the site didn't refresh prices on the go, and end up winning 10usd worth of arcs of manta ?"
dota2loungebets,3aqc0g,WigginIII,1 point,Mon Jun 22 18:12:07 2015 UTC,I believe they update much more regularly (close to daily) at a certain time.  If an item is dropping/rising quickly they adjust it or prevent it from being bet until the price settles down.
dota2loungebets,3aqc0g,z3alot,3,Mon Jun 22 18:15:40 2015 UTC,"What I have found is:   D2L is better for people with smaller armory values. Hell, my most expensive item is $0.40. Doesn't mean I don't enjoy bidding items on matches and winning multiple .05 to .10 items. D2L values all items at at least 0.03, with most items at least $0.05. VPgame values almost all of my items at 0.01 to 0.02, which doesn't make it worth betting. VPgame seems to have better management, and be more competitive, but I can't get past the poor returns for small-time bettors, plus the broken english throughout the entire site."
dota2loungebets,3aqc0g,przeraza,2,Mon Jun 22 18:18:54 2015 UTC,"my reason to switch is vp returns are better, never got more than 5 items. d2l always gives more trash items.  once i had 5$ return on d2l, d2l gave me 42 commons. i hardly bet on d2l after that. once you switch there is no turning back  another reason d2l most of the time give less value than expected. and admins are really dumb"
dota2loungebets,3aqc0g,fgiveme,1 point,Mon Jun 22 17:38:23 2015 UTC,"Just to sum it up - I'm new to betting, and honestly I quicky realized a simple thing - u are forced start at D2L because VP lowers all trash to 0,01$ (wchich is actually a GREAT thing - no shit returns). Only bet trash and banned items on D2L, and when you get things running: any 0,06$+ = time to start betting on vpgame. So far I always got returns in 1 item + trash items rounded to 0,01$ to make the exact bet number. Handicap bets, F10K and soccer/basketball offer much more space for smart/safe/risky bets - you can do what you want and how you want. It seems much more proffesional in general."

If you have a smaller bankroll and can't reasonably bet 1-3% of your bankroll, you can take on more risk but you must realise that you have a higher chance of going broke. When you can comfortably bet smaller you should immediately.  I would recommend never betting more than 5% if you can avoid it (your items may not be easily divisible).  You should read this article on the Kelly Criterion."

dota2loungebets,3aicq9,bvvgogo,1 point,Sat Jun 20 20:23:06 2015 UTC,"Depends on your bankroll. It differs depending on how much you're total bankroll is. For example, a 25$ bet may be considered a big bet for someone with a 50$ bankroll whereas that same amount may be considered small for someone with a 1000$ bankroll. Just think of it this way, set your own bankroll (how much you are willing to bet and/or lose) 1-5% of that should be ""small"", and so on."
dota2loungebets,3afu3x,sapidolhijau,1 point,Fri Jun 19 20:09:21 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the tips.  For the games up on VPGame here's my recommendation:  Mexico (-0.5) > Ecuador - Mexico needs a win here to advance and they're arguably a stronger team than anyone in the group.    Chile (-1.5) < Bolivia - Chile will probably win this game, but these teams are both sitting at the top of the group at the moment.  The most likely scenario is that both teams will only need a draw to advance to the next round.  I would expect a pretty laid back, defensive game.  This one is riskier than the Mexico game, as it's totally possible for Chile to 2-0 Bolivia.  The nice thing is that the Mex/Ecu game will be played first, so these teams will go into the game knowing what outcome they need to advance.  This is how I'm betting, but bet at your own risk and good luck! =)"

dota2loungebets,3afu3x,socpao08,1 point,Sat Jun 20 00:17:49 2015 UTC,"mali are the slightly better team but this is hard to call as it's a 3rd place play off so the result will depend on which team wants it more. just checked the lineups and mali have put up a very strong team so i'd like to think they're taking this seriously. however, there is no handicap so this isn't a great match to bet on as it'll most likely end a draw and go to extra time which would result in our items being returned. if odds settle around 1:1 for mali, probs worth a small bet. <0.8 = no play for me."

dota2loungebets,3ab364,Ceedoh,0,Fri Jun 19 01:44:30 2015 UTC,Yes please. I have a lot to learn about football betting.  And thus sometimes there are days where there are too little matches to bet on.
dota2loungebets,3ab364,dd5p,1 point,Thu Jun 18 18:06:40 2015 UTC,"My thoughts on England U21 vs Portugal U21:  The English U21 squad are considered favourites along side Germany. Also, the attacking trio of Harry Kane, Saido Berahino and Danny Ings has so much potency and I'm very much excited to see if they manage to gel together. With that being said, the Portugese U21 squad isn't as fortunate relatively, to have such attacking talents. However, they are pretty solid as a team on the whole, winning all their group games and beating the Dutch in the play-off round. They are also widely considered to be third favourites, behind England and Germany, to win this tournament.  It could turn out to be a cagey affair, but I'm leaning towards the likelihood of England nicking it over Portugal. If the odds stay above .90 for England -0.5, personally, I'll be placing a medium-ish bet (as I managed to profit from ESL) on them. Though, this is just meant as a friendly tip and I'm not asking you to place your kidneys on them!"
dota2loungebets,3ab364,Ceedoh,1 point,Thu Jun 18 18:22:15 2015 UTC,berahino and stones are both out. feel as if this will be a cagey affair. feeling the draw tbh.

Football experts out there say it's a 50/50 match, either teams can take this. I'm still thinking whether to go small on Venezuela or abstain since this is pretty much a coinflip match with no handicap."
dota2loungebets,3ab364,kappakappa1,1 point,Thu Jun 18 18:56:30 2015 UTC,"this game is definition of coin flip. both sides can win. peru are very experienced and venezuela have been very good of late even beating colombia and beating peru in their last 2 meetings. Personally, I think this will end a draw which is a no play for me as either team can take this. Unless the odds shift heavily, i will abstain."

It's roughly 2.3% vig over the 4 months I collected data (this is for me, others can be+/-  Competition for D2L is GOOD for us  Your comments about the corrupted hook, well that shits been happening for years. Just more options. Tbh, corrupted/autographed should not be accepted since these prices can easily be manipulated (value and being accepted as a ""bettable"" item.   D2L is a bookmaker.

dota2loungebets,39t0ci,Bizarro-aka-WhOaMi,6,Mon Jun 15 22:27:17 2015 UTC,"They screwed me over by changing the TEAMS fighting with 5 minutes left for the match to start and holding onto bets. Bet big on a team that would have had it in the bag then they changed that team for a low tier shitty team with 5 min left for the match to start (no time to change teams or analyze)    But they also skimmed some of my items 3 times in the last 2 months.  (was suppose to win 5.60, they gave back 1.40, // was suppose to win 8.00, they give back 2.00, etc)   D2L is complete shit. You can see just how lazy they are when after you have been on VP game for a while. VPgame actually adjusts when the game will start and give you time to change your bets. They don't skim your bets, and if the teams fighting change they'll cancel the incorrect match.   Long story short D2L is scum. You can tell how much i dislike them by my username.   Trading is also pretty dead now. It was great 1-2 years ago but now everybody is either a scammer or a ""PROFIT ME NEED PROFIT"" loser. Bunch of wanna be traders who don't know how it's done."

It was suppose to be E.P vs some shit team  Then they changed it to another shit team vs shit team.  You can probably find it if you dig around in the complaints section of the D2L site.
dota2loungebets,39t0ci,D2Lsuckmynuts,1 point,Sun Jun 14 21:24:26 2015 UTC,"I'm not too sure, but could you be referring to the debut of VG.P? It was a completely new team, and only like 2 players were from the team D2L stated.. Need I mention again that it was a completely new team? New name, new brand, but the bet wasn't closed. (So basically D2L listed a bet for something like team A vs team B but turns out team B disbanded long ago, and a new team C is the one playing against team A)  In this case its different from sneaky nyx assassins --> summer's rift, it wasn't a rebranding but a totally different team."

They even do GIVEAWAYS sometimes :) Random drops for using their site. + roll item giveaways from users and organizations. + more options to bet on.      Could go on further but.... I'm sure you get the picture.
dota2loungebets,39t0ci,D2Lsuckmynuts,1 point,Sun Jun 14 16:43:34 2015 UTC,but don't they take a cut from every bet? whereas D2L doesn't?
dota2loungebets,39t0ci,lordKappa,1 point,Sun Jun 14 17:55:38 2015 UTC,from what i read d2l takes a smaller cut compared to VPgame
dota2loungebets,39t0ci,lordKappa,1 point,Sun Jun 14 19:22:46 2015 UTC,"maybe that's true, we don't really know tho. even if that's what happening, items returned in vpgame are much much better and not full of 0.03 trashes like in d2l"
dota2loungebets,39t0ci,dreammyz,1 point,Mon Jun 15 00:56:25 2015 UTC,"No, it is true -- vpgame takes a significantly larger cut. At the very least, they don't go around saying ""we don't take any cut"" and still take cuts shamelessly like d2l. (I'm saying this coz d2l mods go around saying they don't take any commission as an excuse for messing things up so often)"
dota2loungebets,39t0ci,pisfan,1 point,Mon Jun 15 01:30:59 2015 UTC,"yeah, for instance, I don't really mind if vpgame takes a larger cut if they always manage their website far better than d2l. d2l is a much more longer site founded yet they always had server problem like overloading after a match is cleared etc. this just gets to show who is doing work and who isn't. d2l stuff/admin also have a 'I don't give a fuck to you' attitude compared to vpgame feedback system."

dota2loungebets,39t0ci,Esg876,0,Mon Jun 15 03:53:27 2015 UTC,You'd have to be hit in the brain to consider it not safe. And I'm talking about http://dota2.vpgame.com/ not the classic vpgame.com. Give it a try. Most bettors won't return to D2L after migrating. :)
dota2loungebets,39sazr,hyp-R,4,Sun Jun 14 07:21:40 2015 UTC,"Last time when I received such an item, I hedged it against a Big bet. Keypoint being, you still have $50.99 of bet value. Use it well.    If you take the item out of D2L you would lose $30 value. So just use it in D2L as an offset to a big bet you will be making. Sure it will be a no-loss no-gain bet, but you will hopefully get rid of this $50 bet value and get $50 real value    Edit : Was assuming the beaver bet price still to be 50.99, but seems that is not the case. Try posting this in the official Steam D2L community group."
dota2loungebets,39sazr,CrazyRicard0,3,Sun Jun 14 07:35:59 2015 UTC,"Appreciate the response, the item is in requested returns because we wanted to check what gem was in it - we haven't withdrawn it but we can't bet it.   What else can you suggest?  Edit: Just saw you edit. Will do."
dota2loungebets,39sazr,doubleBoTftw,2,Sun Jun 14 07:46:34 2015 UTC,"i suggest to decline 2-3 trades daily involving that courier until you get better effect or better colors. I won an Unusual Demon priced at 12$ (lowest market price), requested it , got the 12$ version, decline the trade then received a 50$ version."
dota2loungebets,39sazr,TukangLedeng,2,Sun Jun 14 08:04:19 2015 UTC,"That's crazy - why do they bother with accepting them as trades at all?  I could buy a heap at $18, sell one to another account for $100 via the steam market and then use them to bet. That just seems like a flawed system if one person can influence the market/betting value like that."
dota2loungebets,39sbzb,Forer0,5,Sun Jun 14 07:38:57 2015 UTC,"Considering that I just lost $300 on LGD, I would say yes"
dota2loungebets,39sbzb,AlmightySenator,3,Sun Jun 14 07:43:55 2015 UTC,"I was like ""Wow, thats a big losing streak atleast he won something looks closer to the green one... its $.50 lolgg""  I often lose 1 big bet and slowly gain it back and lose it again. This has been happening to me for a long time now so theres basically no more thrill in betting since I will know what the outcome will be."

Big bets that are >10% of your bankroll should be considered reckless and shouldn't happen more than once per 10-20 bets (I consider breaking 5% rule and go for 10% max once per 1 week because following rules especially on gambling just too damn ahrd)

dota2loungebets,39pgky,BloodseekersBoots,1 point,Sun Jun 14 08:12:09 2015 UTC,"By better I meant it's probably matematically better. The wider selection the more accurate results. So with a more than 3 times as big sample size, even if it's 10 % less win rate I think it's still better since it has less uncertainty.   Nevertheless, you have a valid point that we don't know what the other has made. Comparing win rate says nothing about the bettor, you can earn bugattis even if you have <50% win rate. Just gotta have a solid bank roll management.   Still a nice win rate though, hopefully you keep it up and win more nice items in the future."

dota2loungebets,394ksb,valentinflorin,1 point,Tue Jun 9 06:37:19 2015 UTC,"K, so I don't know how coherent this is...but fek proof reading..  TLDR; assuming that chests go on sale and the chests follow the current market rules, the 3 month unmarketable period, only rare and very rare should drop (hard). If they follow the same pattern as last year, getting rid of rare and very rare chest drops, such as the qop ruby wings and arc of the manta pack, might be a good idea. i'd be hesitant to hold on to any high value couriers, like baeko, with eth flame and some cool color since, again, assuming valve does the same thing as last year, the market should get flooded with ethereal and prismatic gems from people breaking shit couriers. This shouldn't apply to special couriers/courier effects, though..  it's really hard to say. theoretically, arcana should stand the test of time b/c they have a set price and only one way to obtain them (especially now that drops can only be gifted and not marketed).   then again, this is all speculation...  now that i think about it...the real price drops were the rare items from the chests that went on sale...which took about a 90% price cut.  i'd be much more worried hanging onto items that come from chests than those that cannot be obtained by chests, like your salakot.  then again, it's possible that the only chests that go on sale are ones with sets...  if that's the case...then it seems that only rare and very rare drops should drop because they are immediately marketable...  while i've been typing this, assuming that chests will go on sale again, i think that unusual couriers will be rekt in price...potentially valuable inscribed gems (laguna blade kills, unseen enemies hooked...the latter which was basically only available from getting lucky and getting a tenderizer from treasure of the dark implements last year...the same can be said for the catalyst cap from the same chest)as well, but those will almost certainly be unmarketable for 3 months...  well, i'm sorta just thinking out loud so i'ma just stop  edit: i might go full retard and sell some of my most valuable items and invest in csgo or buy up a bunch of unusual couriers as a long term investment (most nearly doubled in price a few months after the sale ended)"

dota2loungebets,394ksb,zpalm25,2,Tue Jun 9 05:59:15 2015 UTC,last year during the sale they had a different chest for sale every day for $.49 iirc. i'm almost positive that unusual couriers took a huge hit during the sale...i'm thinking that the steam sale combined with the compendium...a lot of items may take some huge hits...but i don't really remember too well what happened last year.  i guess it's a gamble both ways

dota2loungebets,38xoyl,z3alot,2,Sun Jun 7 21:46:23 2015 UTC,its a database bug. dac items are stored in d2l database as genuine + immortal name. so genuine dac immortals are shown as genuine genuine +immortal name. Only np staff is stored correctly in database.  same bug is with cm arcana too (so you cant bet exalted quality cm arcana (shown as exalted exalted frost avalanche) . You can bet normal cm arcana.

dota2loungebets,38ufl7,yooorick,7,Sat Jun 6 22:36:07 2015 UTC,"I usually bet on f10k instead of betting on handicap bets if odds are good enough (I do the other way around if it ain't the case).   f10k is pretty random, yeah, so you shouldn't bet there if odds are too bad. If you don't go greedy and bet on all f10k's then you'll be ok in the long run. Also, even if it is random most of the times, you can always do your own research. I do this in 2 ways. First, I take a look at which teams are playing. For example, old Team Secret (with fly and notail) used to lose early game kills wise (but they had the advantage in networth), yet they won most of their games. That's one good example of a team you want to bet against if odds warrant it (new team secret is kinda different though, I feel like EG is a good example of a team that can easily lose f10k and win the game and NIP is one team that can easily win f10k and lose the game due to massive throws). I also wouldn't bet f10k against teams that are favorites and are really aggressive like Empire (it can also backfire, so I don't bet on them either). Now, the second way is doing your own research. This one is pretty decent because most people don't do it and they go along with the results. They don't care if team A beat team B due to a massive throw or comeback, they just think team A is better than team B because they beat them. You can check for this in trackdota, it also has the benefit that it tracks down kills, so you can also check out which team got f10k and which one didn't. It doesn't guarantee anything, so you have to have that clear, but it's a nice bonus I think."

dota2loungebets,38ufl7,fgiveme,1 point,Sun Jun 7 04:40:11 2015 UTC,This is probably the best description and most you can ever get to actually analyzing f10k.  It's not 100% random but it's very hard to legitimately predict.

dota2loungebets,38sqhb,anbknaga,1 point,Sat Jun 6 14:45:13 2015 UTC,"no, actually it is the otherway round, the one who bet on team y will get more because team X is favourite and every one (majority) will bet on team X, so Team X will get less returns.. Betting on team Y will give more returns (if team y percentage is less than team x). That is what the yolo concept is about."

Corruption is and has been running rampant in dota 2 and other esports.   Edit  I want to be clear.  My above statement about corruption is not referring to ""individuals"" or ""teams"" intentionally losing a match.  I am talking about DDOS attacks, SWAT attacks, manipulation of odds at all bookmakers (which is extremely hard to do in sports with millions + bet), and the inevitable scandals that will come to light sooner than later (similar to DDZ/Arrow situation - which is not on the players, but on the people that take advantage of kids, imho).  If one is to think betting doesn't attract corruption, one is either naive, ignorant, or just lying to themselves.  This is an example of ""scandals""  This is an extreme example involving Divison 1 NCAA Football.  However, in the past year the amount of money being wagered on e-sports has tripled, if not more.. and it will continue to grow.  We're going through a part of history, and years from now when they write about ""e-sports"" becoming recognized as a real sport internationally, they will write of T.I. 1, and no doubt T.I. 4."

dota2loungebets,37wagt,savinoxo,1 point,Sun May 31 02:07:02 2015 UTC,What is line shopping?
dota2loungebets,37wagt,Ceedoh,5,Sun May 31 12:49:26 2015 UTC,"Is Beating the a bookmakers price profitable?    Vig, overround, juice = slang for the same thing, profit margin.   A common strategy is shopping odds at sports books for prices that beat the Pinnacle line. This is because Pinnacle (no US players) offers the lowest margins (-104 base on NFL point spreads) accepts the highest betting limits, and has a solid track record for fast payment. They openly solicit winners. Pinnacle is considered sharp, because they can’t easily get away with offering +EV bets, because their margins are small and betting limits massive. Therefore the strategy many use is line shopping to beat the Pinnacle price. While this is the extent of it for many bettors, those more skilled understand the better use of this strategy is not to just beat the Pinnacle price, but rather to beat their no-vig price. What is a No-Vig win probability/price/odds (how can I remove vig?)  Bookmakers make their profit by charging juice/vig. For example if on a moneyline the odds are -250 / +200, the 50 cent gap between is where their profit lies. In order to analyze bets, it’s common for bettors to work out no-vig win probabilities and no-vig prices from professional friendly sportsbooks such as Pinnacle Sports. It’s important to note that these CANNOT be averaged to find a no-vig line. Meaning -250/+200 DOES NOT have a no-vig line of -225/+225 (this is a common mistake).  The correct way to do remove vig is to first determine how often each selection needs to win to break even (this is called implied probability) and the formula for this is risk/return=implied probability.  -250 = stake $250 to win $100. If the bet wins we get a return of $350 ($250 stake + $100 win). The implied probability is therefore 250/350=71.43%. +200 = stake $100 to win $200, so the return is $300 ($100 stake + $200 win). The implied probability is therefore 100/300=33.33%. Notice if we add the two implied probabilities above 71.43% + 33.33% = 104.76%. The reason the total is higher than 100% is the bookmaker advantage called vig. To remove vig we just divide both implied probabilities by their 104.76% total.  71.43/104.76= 68.18% 33.33/104.76=31.82% The two probabilities now equal 100%; the vig is removed. These no-vig win probabilities represent each team’s true chances of winning IF the starting lines had vig distributed equally."

So you want to bet on Team X, if their odds at D2L are 1.9 and looking around you find somewhere else has the odds at 2.0 then you've instantly increased your reward on the risk you would have otherwise taken."
dota2loungebets,37wagt,savinoxo,3,Sun May 31 13:16:02 2015 UTC,"Expected Value (EV) Explained    View second reply for response to, ""What is line shopping"".       Expected value is a term professional gamblers use on a regular basis. To explain what it means in simple terms I’ll use an example. Let’s say me and you decided to have a coin flipping contest. We flip coins and you give me $1 for each outcome of heads; I give you $1 for each outcome of tails. We could flip coins for all eternity and neither of us will ever have an advantage because on average half the time we lose $1 half the time we win $1. While there will be swings back and forth, as long as we flip the coin enough times eventually we’ll both break even. This particular bet has neutral expected value.       Now let’s say I’m tired of flipping coins, and want to quit, but while begging me to stay you offer me a better deal. This new deal pays me $1.10 for every heads, and I still pay you $1.00 for every tails. What happens now is half the time I win $1.10 and half the time I lose $1.00. If we flip 100 times I should average 50 wins of $1.10 ($55) and 50 losses of $1 ($50). Every flip of the coin I have a positive expectation (+EV) of 5 cents. As the one offering me this proposition you have the opposite, every flip of the coin is 5 cents –EV for you.       Every wager made in sports betting has either a positive expected value (+EV), negative expectation value (-EV) or in rare cases neutral expected value. Winning sports betting requires avoiding –EV and finding +EV bets.     GN, be back later to answer any questions.  Honestly, if you're truly interested in learning start researching.  You are the only one can do this for you."
dota2loungebets,37wagt,Bizarro-aka-WhOaMi,1 point,Sun May 31 13:28:16 2015 UTC,"To keep it simple, you could say ""don't bet on who you think will win, but bet on the team that is more likely to win than what the odds imply. Use the bookie with the best odds for a given bet [as long as he's trustworthy, obviously]""  Though you'd still have to calculate percantage winning chanes that you might have an estimate of into the corresponding odds, which would simply be Minimum profitable odds = chance of losing / chance of winning (if the odds are in the form they are in at D2L or Vpgame). As long as I didn't make a mistake here."
dota2loungebets,37wagt,Lame4Fame,5,Wed Jun 3 22:38:02 2015 UTC,"Bizarro-aka-WhOaMi has some good advice. I'll add the following:   If betting at D2L, wait as late as possible before betting, the odds you get can shift, potentially making a would be +EV bet into a -EV one. At Pinnacle or another fixed odds site, bet as early as possible (unless you have a huge BR) because of market efficiency - you should read up on this, or I can give you a simple explanation. If you're having crazy swings it's likely that you're betting too much of your bankroll on each bet. You should have a quick read of this article on the Kelly Criterion. Betting 20% of your bankroll is effectively saying ""I have a  20% edge over the market"" which is ridiculously high, unless you have inside information (market efficiency again). Stick to <5%, maybe even less if you're just following your intuition. You can bet more if your bankroll is small and can't bet 5% of your items, but you shouldn't do this long term. Use a quantitative model. A model has no emotions and is purely objective. You can back test a model, but it's hard to do this with anecdotal predictions. A model can take into account information from more matches than any human could realistically watch. You can also overlay your own intuition on top of a model's prediction and potentially outperform the model. (Disclaimer: I'm the creator of Smart Dota Betting). Focus on making good, +EV bets and not on strike rate (the % of the time that your bet wins). If you want a high strike rate, bet on the favorite in every match. You'll have a high strike rate, but a low and probably negative ROI. A model can help you with this too."
dota2loungebets,37wagt,savinoxo,-1,Sun May 31 02:00:15 2015 UTC,"I honestly would rely on the model as your point says. It may seem old school, but personally watching games and reading material from players or teams is my way to go. Trusting something else to make a prediction for you only based on game history is honestly just a cop out and definitely hurts in the long run. When you look at ti5 quals, these teams aren't just playing that game, some NEED these wins to get in, and pocket starts come out. Pocket starts mess us the model for the future, since there is no importance gauge per match, and they aren't predictable by the past since they're a pocket strat. The model is trying to eliminate the idea of randomness from betting, when in reality that only harbor complacency which is really dangerous in betting. No matter how many games go through the model, it still would never be able to predict well enough to boost returns higher than a human can. And frankly it seems like such a cop out for those that don't want to put the time in to research instead of just throwing money around. Just seems like another private community that thinks they have all the answers but are far from it."
dota2loungebets,37wagt,moartuba,4,Sun May 31 07:43:07 2015 UTC,"Pocket starts mess us the model for the future, since there is no importance gauge per match, and they aren't predictable by the past since they're a pocket strat.   The model has no knowledge of ""pocket strats"". How can you quantify how a ""pocket strat"" will affect a game? You don't know for certain that the team will pull a pocket strat, and it's incredibly patch, hero and match dependent. Even if you could quantify this, how would you know if you were right? If you over or under estimated the ""weight"" of a team pulling a pocket strat you'd be making -EV bets.  There is no explicit ""importance gague"" per match, but the model is optimised to be as accurate as possible, so this sort of thing is done implicitly.   The model is trying to eliminate the idea of randomness from betting, when in reality that only harbor complacency which is really dangerous in betting.   What do you mean when you say it's trying to eliminate the idea of randomness? It's coming up with a probability of each team winning, it's not saying ""Team A will win!""   No matter how many games go through the model, it still would never be able to predict well enough to boost returns higher than a human can.   I think this is pretty misguided. Unless you're a very good handicapper and you watch every match, your intuition and anecdotal evidence aren't really a match for even a simpler model than mine that has taken into account every match. Think of how much information has gone into each decision.   And frankly it seems like such a cop out for those that don't want to put the time in to research instead of just throwing money around.    I don't really think it's a cop out. I think it's obvious that you could overlay your own analysis on top of the model's odds and potentially out perform the model.   If anything it's the opposite of a cop out. Why limit the information you use for betting decisions to purely subjective evidence?"
dota2loungebets,37wagt,savinoxo,-2,Sun May 31 08:18:16 2015 UTC,"Pocket starts have an obvious time and place based off important of the matches. The model doesn't take into effect that a game may be the grand finals of ti5 for example and thats a huge difference. Ask anyone here, and they'll tell you that if its some tier 1 v tier 2 team, your going to see some completely different playstyles coming out of the losing team simply because they want to win at all costs. And thats the problem I'm highlighting with the model. A human can realize that if the odds are based off previous performance, you may expect an 80-20 or 70-30 in favor of the tier 1 team. But the game is still a 50-50 from the sheer meaning of the game. Trying to use past team history is just not the best method at all compared to present and match details. Anyone who watches any dota would know that you expect to see pocket starts when a team has the possibility of being eliminated for TI.  Secondly, you never expand on how the model gauges important. Because I'm 100% sure it doesn't do that and only takes score and w-l per team and lineup into effect. Its probably the reason you see some crazy good odds for those that actually follow the teams.   The idea of randomness goes along the first two lines. Predictions of probability on who will win is trying to fit both teams to the same model and the same hero pools, the same play styles they've shown before. The problem with using statistics to predict anything is the amount of variables in the solution. When you think about dota2, already you have to conform the teams picks In previous games and (if the model was this in depth which it doesn't appear to be) you would be predicting the hero pools of the players, and comparing that win percentage to datdota data to then more neatly form an opinion. But this single factor is already too large to actually make a prediction on. Players usually have very large pools based on their skill and can pick in reaction to the enemy in half their games.   Then apparently you seem to have an idea that this model is like a god with data. You don't have to watch every match to get a sense of the team, but a good indicator is the patch and the last couple matches and graphs from the current tournament the game is in. Just looking back, many 6.83 teams are struggling in 6.84 for a reason, so when you say that your model is looking at even more games from further in the past, you aren't weighing the current patch and your actually producing a very large problem weighing all games equally.   More and more I read about this model, it just engrains itself as a fanboy style model. Look at recent scores, look at win-loss, look at hero's, done. There's nothing there that matters. When you tote the model as being better than the better because it isn't emotional, you also need to realize that that can be very positive and very negative. You should feel things towards your bets and have a form of confidence in them when you bet, not just slap down the money because some random number cruncher from some random guy said so. I've seen a number of people try and make these models and they just don't seem that effective especially considering TI5 quals. Every time someone has posted the odds for a game, the actual people winning post their own analysis that actually can be followed in the game. Talking about actual game length drafts comps etc. Compared to a 70-30 favor, when in reality the game is a 50-50 for the whole series. The models seem silly, and if you want to compare and mirror real life at least, they don't work. Try any other sport betting."
dota2loungebets,37wagt,moartuba,3,Sun May 31 08:58:02 2015 UTC,"This is really derailing the thread now... I hope the OP doesn't mind.

And thats the problem I'm highlighting with the model.   What you're talking about is something the model considers implicitly.

Because I'm 100% sure it doesn't do that and only takes score and w-l per team and lineup into effect.    It looks at win/loss and line up. The parameters of the model are constantly adjusted for accuracy, this means that patch, meta changes and even ""pocket strats"" are implicitly weighted in the model.   The idea of randomness goes along the first two lines. Predictions of probability on who will win is trying to fit both teams to the same model and the same hero pools, the same play styles they've shown before.

But this single factor is already too large to actually make a prediction on. Players usually have very large pools based on their skill and can pick in reaction to the enemy in half their games.   There are a TON of variables in dota, this is true. This isn't just a problem for statistical models, humans have to be able to process this information too!   The model only cares about each player's ability, and that is dependent on their hero picks, strats, performance in different patches and meta changes. So really it does take into account a lot of this information.   Just looking back, many 6.83 teams are struggling in 6.84 for a reason, so when you say that your model is looking at even more games from further in the past, you aren't weighing the current patch and your actually producing a very large problem weighing all games equally.   This is just flat out incorrect. The model is constantly updated to be as accurate as possible. This means that it ""learns"" how patches and meta changes have affected the game. Including more information fundamentally leads to better predictions.   When you tote the model as being better than the better because it isn't emotional, you also need to realize that that can be very positive and very negative. You should feel things towards your bets and have a form of confidence in them when you bet, not just slap down the money because some random number cruncher from some random guy said so.   You conveniently didn't address the negative side of emotions. Even positive emotions can have a negative impact on betting, overconfidence can lead to -EV bets. Emotions are just flat out bad for betting successfully, you need to be strictly analytical. Following a model that's been very successful over nearly a year of out of sample betting brings people great confidence.  I think you should read about market efficiency, kelly betting and psychological biases. Some of the things you said are quite misguided and you clearly have a lot to learn about betting in a professional way. PM me if you want some book recommendations."

I'd trust an average looking guy with a seemingly innocent trade offer without insisting or demanding anything because of their ""rep."" Also, definitely use the dota 2 trade subreddit to trade giftables. You are far less likely to run into these trashcans and are much more likely to find reasonable people who are willing to make fair trades.   I guess I sort of went on a tangent.."

Every day I see these threads where people complain about getting scammed.  I know there are legit guys, who fullfil their part of a bargain, but gift trades are like bets, there are odds that person on the other side is a scammer, and they are getting smarter. They are using good looking profiles and its hard to tell legit trader from scammer.  I got scammed couple of times myself and best solution is to quit gift trades completely.  This is not a rant, I honestly feel sorry about anyone who gets scammed, I know how that feels, but just wait until your items get tradable and start trading then, maybe you will get lower price compared to what you could get now, but dont let the greed get the best out of you. Most of the times scammers succed because the other person is greedy."

Its been reported on here earlier and usually always gets resolved withing a day max. Yes, i do realise a day is a long time but it is what it is. It is probably run by 'younger' individuals who maybe not so efficient in dealing with problems just as yet.

dota2loungebets,37m4k2,rhln,-2,Thu May 28 19:16:24 2015 UTC,I would agree with you if it were just a glitch that got resolved. Why would it take 3 tickets to get my items back? They kept closing them. Seems really deceptive and malicious to me.

""grow up kid""  ""You come to VPGame website to bet at ur own risk"" + ""Did we force u to bet in VPGame?"" (Trying to shift the blame on me for their system having issues, as though ""bet at your own risk"" implies that you might have to deal with rude people or not get your items back if the system doesn't want to give it back)  ""Pls stop behave like a kid when u are a grown up man""  (I ask what the rake at VP is, and I get this response) ""i think u should write 500000%. it look more dramatic""  ""so be a civilized person will u""  Seems like great customer service to me.

I believe you when you say they said those things but I'm also pretty sure you were rude on your end too.  You also have to take one thing into account : these website is run by young Chinesemen who probably don't speak English as well as you do and they might need more than 2 hours to solve your problem.

dota2loungebets,37m4k2,SC6GodReal,3,Thu May 28 18:32:27 2015 UTC,OP is mad because it took 8 hours to VPG to fix a glitch in their return system and respond to his ticket.

There was mistakes made within the system. You should be upset for sure but this was probably a one time thing, and you should not be so upset or completely abandon VPGame because of one bad experience. If it happened again then you could obviously rage as much as you wanted but it seems to be a one time thing that will not happen again in my opinion. There are far too many huge bettors on that website for this to happen more than occasionally."
dota2loungebets,37m4k2,SC6GodReal,-1,Thu May 28 17:09:39 2015 UTC,"Yes, I would hope that it doesn't happen often. However, the fact that I had to open 3 support tickets to get my items and have them unlock my inventory means that they didn't really care. There are other sites to use, and their rudeness was uncalled for. I just wanted to get my items back in my inventory, but had to open 3 tickets because they kept closing them."
dota2loungebets,37m4k2,uyenbk,1 point,Thu May 28 17:11:23 2015 UTC,"I understand your point from that perspective. Missing out on being able to bet really sucks especially when you could have profited from those missed opportunities. I can understand your frustration and everything but VPGame offers better returns than D2L in my opinion, and the have handicap bets, first to 10 kills, and other sport bets with odds that are so stupid that any person with basic sport knowledge can profit hugely off of. You do not get any of this on D2L so I guess it's up to you."
dota2loungebets,37m4k2,JionFeederino,-1,Thu May 28 17:35:28 2015 UTC,It also isn't the first time I would have won a bet and they screwed up. I bet on IG against EP in a BO3 and they messed up closing betting and had to cancel it. This place seems to be full of problems.

Missing out on betting is annoying, but their rudeness and inability to actually deal with my problem was the biggest problem. They could have easily just given me an arcana, apologized, and I would have been fine. But they were rude and made me jump though hoops to get my items. Very bad.  Also, who cares what you can bet on if your items will sometimes disappear and they are rude when you ask for help?"
dota2loungebets,37nkev,hawk2119,7,Thu May 28 23:15:24 2015 UTC,New immortal for Antimage. A lot of people now don't want their arc of manta now which brings in much more supply on the market.

dota2loungebets,37hl8q,SC6GodReal,2,Wed May 27 18:15:01 2015 UTC,"It's a permanent and new ""feature"" of the market to lessen fraud.  It covers all accounts so someone can't steal an account, buy thousands of dollars worth of dota hats, then trade it away before the account is retrieved. Valve gives a 7 day time window for someone to retrieve their account.  I would say it's very safe to trade money for hats if you retrieve the hat first and send money after, I cannot say the same for the other user even if he receives the money first. That said, nobody is gonna go first in a money trade with someone that has no veterancy or anything."
dota2loungebets,37hl8q,Cryder,1 point,Wed May 27 18:59:35 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I figured that obviously no one would go first in a money trade because I have no veterancy, so where would I find someone who has veterancy in actually doing money trades?

dota2loungebets,37hl8q,Chomatoo,1 point,Wed May 27 19:13:42 2015 UTC,try using an escrow..? even if you had to pay some kind of fee it'd still be drastically cheaper than the steam market.  imo using an escrow is the safest way to get past the 7 day restriction.  side note: why can you sell csgo items the day you buy them but not dota 2? makes no sense.

If you stay disciplined, you will be rewarded. Don't ever regret what already behind (like saying I coulda bet ALL my bankroll and still win that bet etc).

dota2loungebets,379z28,nevermindthebbb,2,Tue May 26 02:03:42 2015 UTC,Thanks a lot. I'm also here to answer to all question about our ValueBet.
dota2loungebets,379z28,trevize23,2,Tue May 26 02:32:13 2015 UTC,there have been a few posts about ggnet taking a huge commission off of bets (13% overround iirc) is this intended or just a bug in your system?
dota2loungebets,379z28,trevize23,1 point,Tue May 26 03:22:35 2015 UTC,"Is not either intended or a bug. As also OP say ""One arguement is that I chose that match 10 hours before it happened so the pool is still small and that my 32.27 value would shift the odds too much."" Yes, pool was very small when he did that test (even when game become live an bets was closed prize pool was small and odds could be affected by a 37 USD bet - when that game was occurred our max user allowed to use valubet was 1000, both CS:GO and Dota2).   Also commission of 1% are taked when game is over and items need to be distributed. Also a big difference from other bet websites are that we have a common prize pool from where items are distributed and not a prize pool for each game. For example if 3 people will bet on Team 1 and only 1 on Team 2, if Team 1 will win all 3 winners will get items from common prize pool and not only 1.  OP can contact me and we can try to remake that test with a 1 USD bet on a game with a big Prize Pool."
dota2loungebets,379z28,trevize23,1 point,Tue May 26 03:49:42 2015 UTC,"Do you work for GG.net?  I've used their valuebet system for the ti5 qualifier and it worked pretty well with 2-3 exemptions.   The item limit is 16 items only, are there plans to change that? I think it heavily limits you if there are multiple games at the same item or many games in a short timespan.  Is the distribution system set in stone? I had 2-3 games where I bet $2-$4 and won $5+, but the payout was in $0,04 items only (over 100 items). Apparently I'm not the only one running into that problem."
dota2loungebets,379z28,Soupstorm,1 point,Mon Jun 1 08:04:14 2015 UTC,"Hello, first of all sorry for late answer and yes, i'm part of GGnet Crew.   We already thinked to change this and very soon we will bring an update. We know about you and few more guys that recived 50+ items of few cents but unfortunately this issue is due lack of expensive items on our Item Pool. Like i say before we have a common Item Pool from where winners are rewarded, but this will grow in time. To explain a little, if loser bets only items under 1% for example we can't offer as reward items that worth 5$. For this we take that cut of 1% so we can have a various list of items to reward."

However, wouldn't it be nice to know beforehand whether or not you're just betting to get your items back? There's no way of knowing for sure that you can only lose. A general ""winnings under X will not be honoured"".  And honestly, .30 isn't that low, if you ask me. It's certainly enough to easily turn out in 1-2 items."

dota2loungebets,36z15n,scarecrow4_20,0,Sun May 24 14:07:19 2015 UTC,D2L should have a promo where they do a cleanup. Trade one $30 item for thirty two $1 items. It could bring back the higher betters. Have a similar system for 4c items.
dota2loungebets,36z15n,jasndream,4,Sat May 23 11:20:21 2015 UTC,You have mistaken d2l with a charity institution Kappa
dota2loungebets,36z15n,scarecrow4_20,1 point,Sat May 23 12:06:13 2015 UTC,"Surely it would benefit them anyway. If people have a large number of items in their D2L inventory, they're more likely to yolo bet. Plus the ingestion of more expensive items will mean big betters will start coming back from VPGame which also benefits them. The amount they lost from trading down would be gained by future revenue.   Or they could keep doing what they're doing, not care and still make the same profit whilst slowly loosing big betters. I don't know why you wouldn't want to tap into the Chinese market."

dota2loungebets,36yizw,nevermindthebbb,1 point,Sat May 23 09:48:39 2015 UTC,"The whole math process you are explaining here simply does not apply to ValueBet on Gosugamers.net.  There are no fixed odds for ValueBet matches that are issued prior to the match, so you are not playing ""against"" the bookmaker, this simply is not the case.  The percentages for each possible outcome (team A/B win/loss/draw) is determined by the value placed on that outcome as bets. It is the amount of value placed, and not the number or bets, that is important. So as the percentage of each outcome changes with the bets it also changes the maximum estimated payout should your bet be successful. This means that your payout for the value you placed could be higher, lower or unchanged when the match is closed for bets depending on how much value was placed after your bet and how much it has changed the percentages. This can be seen by refreshing the page while a match has still not closed for bets prior to its start. An example that illustrates that:  I bet $10 on 'Team 1'  Total bet amount (including mine): Team 1 = $50 Team 2 = $100    I have 20% share of the winnings on 'Team 1' share = my bet amount / my team bet amount $10 / $50 = 20%    My possible winnings are 20% from $100 - up to 1% commission winnings = share * other team bet amount - commission 20% * $100 = $20 $20 - 1% = $19.80"

dota2loungebets,36sr3q,niceApfel,4,Thu May 21 20:42:04 2015 UTC,"If you click on the question mark next the handicap it leads you to an explanation. You don't have to click anything though - just place your bet on either team like you normally would.  It's basically a way for a bet with a high favorite to still have a decent value for either team because it's harder for the favorite to win bet (obvious by the name ""handicap""). It means that you have to subtract the handicap from the final score. For example: Na'Vi plays against Alliance in a Bo3 and you have the chance to bet on a -1.5 handicap for Na'Vi. Na'Vi has to win the match 2 : 0 over Alliance to win your bet because 2 - 1.5 is still 0.5 (Na'Vi) : 0 (Alliance). However a 2 :1 outcome ( Alliance won 1 game) would mean a score of 0.5 (Na'Vi) : 1 (Alliance -> you lost your bet."

I was very careful cause i didn't know the competitive scene that well. I made progress and did my ""homework"". then I started to bet those >5$ items. it went so well that I got greedy and started to bet lina arcanas. I was successfull and got more and more. then came the expected big downfall. I learned from it. I made a long pause and started again. after having thought about it, I decided not to start low again cause I told myself that I knew how betting works on d2l. well, i purchased one LC arcana and I won a lot. I eventually got to 600 $ (from just one LC arcana xD). then I dropped to 150$ and quit. now I bet again and went all in with my only arcana. I started yesterday and made this profit so far:  http://i.imgur.com/gL7zFzu.png  it is equal to 157 $"
dota2loungebets,36nvqd,BotoX88,1 point,Wed May 20 19:44:04 2015 UTC,"Never go all-in (like I frequently do) unless you are almost guaranteed a win (happens rarely, but there are cases: example - Vega Squadron and Virtus.Pro nowadays are on a ""honeymoon"", there's hype around them, and can defeat pretty much any team that is a tier below or more, possibly even better teams). Keep in mind 3 factors: DDoS, 322 and handicap bets. Learn how each works before blaming someone else or biting your own nails. Stay away from SEA and Chinese Dota as much as possible (but there are teams like VG, Malaysia and iG LGD which are relatively more stable than the others). One good example is Mineski, just don't bet on them whenever they've over 70% odds. Use VPGame for better returns; if you're starting small with trash items (under 50 cents), use Dota2Lounge as they're known to give a more evenly spread return. Say, you are supposed to win 10$ on both D2L and VPG. There are 2 ways it's probably going to happen: on VPG you'll likely get a single item (a voidhammer is around this price range), whereas on D2L you could get anything from 5 to 20 items of smaller value. That's a bit more recommended if you tend to bet more often on underdogs. Always remember the golden rule: there are no safe bets.   Good luck, and welcome aboard!"

dota2loungebets,36nvqd,kachus22,1 point,Wed May 20 20:28:27 2015 UTC,"-0.5 = team need to 2-0 or you bet lost   In BO3 is pretty much the same:    -1.5 = team need to win 2-0 or your bet lost   For easier explanation, you take that number out of the team you picked. If the final score is **X* team 2-1 Y team* and the handicap was -1.5 for X, that means 2 - 1.5 = 0.5. Which leads into 0.5 < 1. So Y team wins the handicap bet.     In the normal bet it doesn't matter. I would suggest handicaps when you are confident with the team (Lets say LGD vs NoT, LGD is a better team in general that could 2-0).  Or the other way around. (VG vs EG. VG with -1.5 handicap. You think EG is good and can win a game but not sure about winning the series.)"

dota2loungebets,36nvqd,bravo_six,1 point,Wed May 20 23:38:05 2015 UTC,"I learned about bankroll managment while I was playing online poker. people all manage their bankroll diferently but I suggest that you never bet more than 10% of your bankroll. That means no matter if youre gonna bet on 1 game or 5, never bet more than 10%.   Now as for how much you should start with, well thats up to you. How much do you have and what do you want to do with your winnings. Do you want to make a nice collection for yourself or sell those out. Its all up to you."

dota2loungebets,36nvqd,bravo_six,1 point,Thu May 21 00:41:35 2015 UTC,"well you asked question about bankroll managment. I gave you best answer. If you do have ten dollars bankroll then I dont suggest betting more than 1$. I realize that some people cant get big bankroll for betting, but then you need to understand that everything is a risk. Even in best possible scenario, the favorite is gonna lose sometimes and you have to be prepared for a lost.  If you bet a lot, even if youre really good you have to expect to lose a bet sometimes. And with small bankroll you just cant cover that lost."
dota2loungebets,36nvqd,nevermindthebbb,1 point,Thu May 21 03:06:20 2015 UTC,"the rule of thumb for professional bettors is to not bet more than 3% of your bankroll. it's quite hard to follow such rules with a smaller bankroll, but betsizes are so conservative in order to decrease risk of ruin. if you wanna be a bit scientific about it, the variance in betting is quite huge such that betting 10% of your original bankroll will deplete your bankroll very quickly during big losing streaks, which are unavoidable.  my personal max bet right now is 5% of my bankroll. i'd like to push it down towards 3% as my bankroll gets bigger however, less risk and i wont be subject to wild win/loss streaks as much.  edit: i also want to add: if you're spending hours per day researching teams and watching games, i highly suggest you invest some real money into buying bettables. if youre spending hours per day on this betting thing and are betting like $2 per game, it's not really worth your time"

If you are starting to bet with small items the best place to bet in d2l. I wouldnt suggest vpgame to small value bets because even though they give you a single good value item its also logical that you can use the single good value item to bet only in one match. For example if   gives 8 $1 item you can try betting in different matches but when vpgame gives you only $8 you bet on one match and you may lose/win depending on your luck. Once you have got lot of $2 items you can move to vpgame and start betting with the high value items you get. 1 more thing, when you win your 1st arcana dont start betting it, save it, try winning around 4 arcanas from your trash then move to betting arcanas,"
dota2loungebets,36lg3w,muhbeers,2,Wed May 20 06:59:06 2015 UTC,"1) VPgame / D2L.    2) Start by buying common betting items. It ranges from legendary sets/weapons to arcanas/immortals/genuine items.    3) In your case, $50, I would say $2 = small bet. $5 medium bet and >$10 large bet. Of course, it varies from one to one.    Tips: Always gather team/player information before placing on them. Abstain if necessary.The best way to win a bet, is to not bet. Your brain and your gut will fight one another often, decide the risk yourself. Never be greedy, the ""all-in"" logic only works if you can afford to lose.    Good luck!"

Do not place a prediction in all matches. Know your teams (watch games/observe their picks/their team fights). For myself, I find myself really familiar with SEA matches and win most of them (probably cause I'm a SEA player). Yolo only when necessary :)"
dota2loungebets,36lg3w,xbelieverx,2,Thu May 21 03:13:02 2015 UTC,"Start by reading all of the links in the sidebar (to the right) Look up items on the market worth about $0.5-1 each. Make sure that there is a high quantity of them (so the prices dont fluctuate as much) and it is a stable hero (eg one that is not going to get nerfed any time soon). These are some examples of $1 items: venge legs qop armour. Both of these have a quantity of over 80. If you want to buy other ones, look for atleast 70 quantity because the lower the quantity, the more the price can fluctuate.  Buy 10 of any $~1 items you want and keep the other $40 aside. I'm assuming you are new and because of this, if you spend the full $50 on items you will lose it all.  Bet using Dota2Lounge. Bet only 1 of these items per match, even if you will only win like 0.1$. Read up on this subreddit, gosugamers, joindota and pretty much every dota2 website so you can figure out which team will most likely win. You will not be correct 100% of the time. Look up things like drafts, team composition, team rosters (they may change), if the game is a best of 1 or best of 3 etc, when to abstain, odds mathematics and probability. Also, a big one is to watch the games so you can see how each player plays, if they are tilting, if they played complete crap or dominated the enemy team etc Keep doing this. If you lose it all, buy another $5 worth of items and continue. Once you feel like you can predict matches, then you can start to buy $4+ items and then betting.   Also, a big bet would be 10% of your bankroll, med is 5% and small is 2%. So in your case, a big bet would be $5, med is $2.5 and small is $1."

They could still make listing $ (currency) amount cap, but allow you to hold more.  IMHO, it applies for the same reason a bookmaker (or Vegas and other Casinos) will force a x3 or x5 rollover.  They want that money to keep being bet spent  To clarify: Vegas doesn't force a rollover like onlinke bookmakers, but if you're winning big they will do everything in their power to keep you gambling (offer perks, upgrade to penthouse suite, etc)"

I made progress and did my ""homework"". then I started to bet those >5$ items. it went so well that I got greedy and started to bet lina arcanas. I was successfull and got more and more. then came the expected big downfall. I learned from it.  I made a long pause and started again. after having thought about it, I decided not to start low again cause I told myself that I knew how betting works on d2l. well, i purchased one LC arcana and I won a lot. I eventually got to 600 $ (from just one LC arcana xD). then I dropped to 150$ and quit. now I am planning to bet again."

They've been trending up so you might even end up with a bigger bankroll than you expected, although not sure how much longer this will be the case.  getting keys and betting with them is probably the safest.

dota2loungebets,36dmu3,DirtyTzigan,0,Mon May 18 20:23:39 2015 UTC,"I would say go with keys until you get a feel for betting and a feel for how teams perform.

dota2loungebets,36dmu3,Hot_Beef,1 point,Mon May 18 16:59:56 2015 UTC,"Keys are a consistent trading currency atm in dota. So you can always trade them in and upgrade to whatever other items you'd like. Yeah they are getting removed in a couple of weeks but it doesn't hurt for someone starting off in betting to use something consistent as keys, also you don't get garbage item returns only keys. This helps with keeping of track on how you are doing and also being able to evaluate your bet sizing and how much you are comfortable with betting. Most importantly its hard to all in when you are on tilt with keys."

dota2loungebets,369e5o,egeerdogan,11,Sun May 17 13:33:36 2015 UTC,"I disagree with this suggestion.  This will cause a lot of ripple effect from the current ambiguity of the system.  Users should be posting their perspective as a form of sharing. I believe that's why this subreddit was formed. As a discussion, info sharing platform. Not a competition or to show who is the better person. This will highly encourage users to start editing their post and switching last minute posts which completely disrupts the neutrality of the post itself.  The current reddit karma system is good enough to indicate the user's said post.   At the end of the day, users posts perspective is judged from their perspective and analysis, not because they have more points.  As it stands, there are already very little insights posted. This system will create a competitive nature which will cause user to be more defensive in their post, and resort in to defend their analysis based on their past performance. When instead, they should be ajudged on their post itself.  At the end of the day, people should be posting insights and analysis, not just prediction. Prediction alone just tosses the coin to heads/tail, where your analysis and insights should empower users to make their own choices."

dota2loungebets,365tjx,rhln,1 point,Sat May 16 12:55:40 2015 UTC,"VPgame is MUCH smaller than dota2lounge.  E.g. in the CSW vs GGuard game.  VPgame: 20255 itemsplaced  D2L: 29988 people placed 135033 items.  Of course, since this is value betting, just a few individuals can shift the odds a whole lot. Especially if you are betting on small matches, or 10 kills first, etc.   When I used to bet at D2L with 12 accounts of 4 staches each, sometimes I could shift the odds for unpopular matches by 1%. I could probably throw off the whole odds of vpgame with this amount, judging by the ""largest bet value"" thing which is sometimes not full of staches/bfs."
dota2loungebets,365kcl,charcoalyik,3,Sat May 16 10:19:42 2015 UTC,"One thing you need to keep in mind -    VPGame is a betting website which is highly reliant on its Algorithm of calculating item prices. Since it is a business model, it will always value the item considering average - to - worst case market Fluctuations. This ensures that the website doesn't lose value while it holds the item. Investment Banks use a similar evaluation mechanism to keep itself safe from the Market Risk.    steam.tools is a simple information system which does not have to consider the above Risk scenario. So the algorithm which steam.tools uses will not be calculating such things , simply put steam.tools does not need to care about it because the Market fluctuations have 0 impact to it.    Hence steam.tools prices will be different from the VPgame prices ."

There's always people complaining when you introduce a new betting site and it's really hard to know if those people have been scammed by the website or if they're making up stories to trash the name of the newcomer.

dota2loungebets,35uqsc,Bizarro-aka-WhOaMi,2,Wed May 13 23:24:09 2015 UTC,"Ugh it feels way worse last 2 weeks even as a low bank better. My $1.30 returns on VP turn into not even $0.90. Doesn't matter what you're betting seems like every bet recently I'm getting 15% less. Also the discrepancy between in value between you're inventory, and what you receive is huge. Items that they value at 50 cents for you, count for $0.25 when you are betting them next game."
dota2loungebets,35uqsc,Ice_Cream_Warrior,1 point,Wed May 13 19:54:33 2015 UTC,"The discrepancy should decrease imo. At least I theorized that vpgame suppressed the price of genuines (value of genuines on the market have a much larger discrepancy than normal items) because they basically monopolized betting of genuines. Now that D2L has allowed for genuines to be bet, it is possible that the discrepancy could shrink.  That being said, I withdraw every genuine i win on vpgame, especially qop bloodfeathers, and sell them on the marketplace.  However, d2l may have acted too late and vpgame may have no pressure to increase the betting value of genuines to their (rightful) market value."
dota2loungebets,35uqsc,Bizarro-aka-WhOaMi,1 point,Thu May 14 00:08:01 2015 UTC,"I mean it should already not be there and isn't transparent what values the items are worth. I use the dota 2 lounge helper to see values, and in your returns under bet history the items, and those values always seem higher, than when you are then betting them yourself. This is easy to verify by clicking on them and seeing average steam market price. I don't then understand why it seems like 2 different values for items are being used, and if they aren't using the number that is matching up from the extension and on the steam store, then players are getting an even bigger amount of reduction in bets. There also seems different values between the placing of the items and its individual page if you click on it and on the my bets overview. I get that these 3rd party extensions may be culprit to these errors, but even within d2l as vanilla the math doesn't always seem to be adding up when compared and its hard to know what exactly items are being valued at.  That isn't entirely meant to be as a reply to you on your specific points but more-so the problems of d2l item values and why I don't see it changing with just the addition of genuines and etc being added now."

That's hardly advice and suggestions. Your not even right as it isn't a bet under $1 and you hadn't even explained why that would cause issues if I hadn't have known about d2l item drafting.

dota2loungebets,35uqsc,Ice_Cream_Warrior,2,Thu May 14 02:46:23 2015 UTC,"Long post, spoiler tags to help  Spoiler    Example of how D2L prioritizes returns  When I say $ I mean value.  $=Value    ""Person A"" places bet     x4 5$ items x2 10$ items Person A total Value bet = 40$, highest tier items value bet = 10$     ""Person B"" places same bet, using different valued items     x1 30$ item  x1 10$ item  Person ""B"" Total Value Bet = 40$, highest Tier Items value bet = 30$  Person A and B bet the same ""total value"" however person B bet the the higher valued tier item therefore he will get priority over ""A"" on value item returns.    For simplistic sake, lets say only 10 other items were bet on the opposite team of  Persons A and B. x1 70$ item, x1 10$ items.   Person B, receives 70$ item, whereas person A will only receives only the 10$ item, and quite possibly no item at all if person B was valued at 80$+ value for returns.    TLDR Betting 6 Items that total 6$ is not the same as betting 1 item totaling 6$.  Betting the 1 higher value item will prioritize your returns ahead of others betting lower value items of equivalent total value  I hope this makes sense, it's late, and I'm burnt out, will check back tomorrow.    If you have any questions LMK.     edit:   Formatting  Suggestions!, that will pretty much guarantee you a manta, or ES totem, etc..  Climbing the tiers is the only way that I know to get out.

dota2loungebets,35uqsc,Bizarro-aka-WhOaMi,1 point,Thu May 14 04:12:31 2015 UTC,"Not sure what you were going to spoiler, with those links but nothing is there for me. I was aware of this was how the drafting works, I do appreciate the effort and format though. For a lower end bank roll though such as myself around 15-20, then what do you suggest as a general plan. I'm normally betting currently for returns around  a dollar, with some less some more, trending upward last week or so. I've kind of gotten out of the yolo betting mentality and playing it much more conservative but obviously this tends to make it a slow climb to grow and isn't landing amazingly more valuable items. I've been burned by the yolo way when starting out and was negative for a couple weeks, and have gone from 25+ up to even with that also. What I focus on in my betting is generally on identifying favourites only around 60-70 that I think are locks and betting more on those and finding the strong dogs with a medium bet here and there on them, and not going to hard either way on true 50/50 odds or going after the 80+/20-.also.  In terms of anything dramatic do you think then it would make any sense to sell a lot of my $0.15-$0.40's on the market and buy $0.8-1.5 stuff, while taking the hit of the steam percent on either side? I haven't really been using value tiers consciously while betting I admit, and tend to save any of the big items until I see sure things (which of course doesn't really do anything for me) and unfortunately it seems my in my 5-6 ""sure things"" I of course found out why it's called betting and naturally picked out 3-4 upsets.   Your above info is infinitely more useful than saying originally, and I do realize I need to look more at tier and value betting and not just total numbers even if I was aware of how the drafting worked before. I'm just letting you know that you did come across as arrogant/others are beneath me vibe with a comment that amounts to shit bank equals shit returns that in its current form wasn't clear about looking at tier values where I took it as total value. Then the followup comment that could've easily been to rectify an obvious misunderstanding instead came with increased vile. I know myself I often gain a smarter than you, or how did you not know that sense in reddit comments and just letting you know that is how I took those.  I appreciate this post especially given how concise and calm it is and ignoring the earlier tone exchanged. Thanks for it, and I will at least think more about tiers in betting even if I can't totally change my style too much right now. Been rising over last couple days so hopefully in next couple bets I gain some higher tier stuff to at least get something new to strategize around."
dota2loungebets,35uqsc,WhatTheBet,1 point,Thu May 14 04:39:30 2015 UTC,"here's a tip i can give you and other bettors with a small (<$20) betting size   don't limit yourself to d2l. there are 3 main sites i bet on which are d2l, vpgame and d2by and with my betsize, i tend to move odds by .05 to .2 more often than not, especially on d2by. have items on returns on all 3 sites and bet on the site that has the best return value possible.   one example would be the c9 eg game. on d2l/d2by, betting a dollar on c9 would win you around $1.07 with c9 being at 48/52.  if you had bet a dollar on c9 at vpgame you would have won $0.97 because vpgame charges a significant amount of commission/vig/juice/whatever you wanna call it. 10 cents may not be a lot, but if youre betting 10+ games per day, you could probably save up to $10 in a week, which is a significant % of your bankroll.  this rarely applies to bigger bettors such as myself, because a normal medium bet from me on vpgame and d2by would change the odds against my favor, thus lowering my edge.  keep in mind however that because you're betting sizes are so small, you're basically at the mercy of people who use 4+ accounts to max bet. a lot of those people manipulate odds to their favor especially in vpgame. that, coupled with the fact that vpgame takes a 5%~ is the main reason why its toughest to consistently win on vpgame compared to other sites"
dota2loungebets,35uqsc,Koudelka919,1 point,Thu May 14 06:17:12 2015 UTC,"Fair enough, I've been putting all my extra trashes into it, and so far haven't turned that into much cause frankly I'm going on the better odds too often as most of the stuff is 2 cents. Its stupid I know but I don't like the ui as much and I've found some of the odds aren't as attractive as the d2l odds, specifically many of the 60-70 favourites on d2l. I haven't been betting well on the handicaps with a lot of the inconsistent results in China, but that is definitely where you can make your money. The 4 bets only also makes it hard with many lower items but I think I will try to get a bit more of the bankroll over and start betting more serious."

It's a cycle and it usually balances out in the long run.  i.e. some times you get more items when prices are low and some times you get less items when prices are high."

dota2loungebets,35wbcy,Maverick1982,2,Thu May 14 05:03:06 2015 UTC,"I'm pessimistic that prices will take a small hit when the immortal II chests are released... I think arcanae retain their value the best, but most items should regress to the mean pretty close to what the prices were about a month before the compendium release (give or take), probably within a month, unless something like TI immortal chest II and III cause another plunge in prices. But some items may take a deeper plunge and potentially permanent plunge if an item is released which takes up the same slot as another item (e.g. PA arcana and gleaming seal).  Sort of a damned if you do damned if you don't situation; everything is proportional. price drops for mantas may be like .50, but if you trade up to an arcana and it drops a few dollars, it's about the same...  The best bet to profit, which is also the most risky option, would be to just sell everything and hope for another dip in prices... but, at least for me, it just doesn't seem like it's worth it (at least for cosmetics for heroes you play).  Dunno if i even answered your question"

dota2loungebets,35wbcy,Maverick1982,2,Thu May 14 05:03:14 2015 UTC,"that doesn't make sense. items become more valuable when they're bettable, so no items should really lose value (the number of frozen items really doesn't add a significant number of items to the betting pool). if any item loses value as a result of allowing more types of items to be bet, it should all be proportional, but i still don't believe that d2l changing their bettable items will have or has any impact on the current price of items. afaik i haven't seen any corrupted or frozen items being bet (i haven't really seen much of d2l but i heard aus items are being bet), but betting unusual couriers is just retarded. if you're out there d2l, it's just Fucking Retarded. for instance, D2L, if you're out there, why the Fuck would i bet my eth flame dungeon doom lil'nova for ~45? I'd have to bet it at about 1:3.5 odds to even hope to get the value of my courier back. To top it all off, I can't bet my unusual tinkbot (i assume my frog courier as well, but it's on the market [gold with some random animation]). what the Fuck is the method to this madness? I guess it's ok to let unusual couriers to be bet because only the least valuable gems/colors will ever be bet, but it just seems stupid.  /end rant"
dota2loungebets,35wbcy,Chomatoo,1 point,Thu May 14 06:51:20 2015 UTC,Consider this - earlier there was a limited pool of items that you could bet. Now I have increased the pool of bettables. Even though my item was genuine which needless to mention is a far better collectable than a normal one. But since its only a collectable it started loosing its value to normal one which had same effects in game and definitely had liquidity value since I could use them in bets. Since D2L now has added various items to the list the amount of bettable items increase. The price of a normal items will fall where as price of least preferred cursed / auspicious items which were dirt cheap has increased significantly. Cause now they are having added value.

dota2loungebets,35wbcy,bravo_six,1 point,Thu May 14 10:46:37 2015 UTC,I have listened to someones advice here some time ago. He said that best items to get are immortals.I followed his advice and I pretty much recovered from all I lost during compendium release. They dropped a bit but quicky recovered and with popularity increase of certain heroes I even got some small profits.  Also concering price drop because colored items are now betable on D2L. I dont think its gonna make that big of a difference. Its gonna make auspicious items increase in price but I doubt other items will drop that much. Auspicious and other items were betable on other sites before.

dota2loungebets,35twx4,tiocuca,1 point,Wed May 13 14:37:21 2015 UTC,"I have no clue what their site looks like in China, and they have the advantage of being able to swap items between Perfect World and the rest of the world.  That is the only reasoning I can think of for VP to be using other items; is they're running multiple bookmaking sites.  One in China and one for NA/EU etc, maybe more I haven't researched. edit   vpgame always gives you an item closest to the return value, no matter if you bet on the underdog or not.**     Underdog has nothing to do with how D2L returns works.  It determines priority of highest value by highest value of single items + quantity bet.  So, 6x 60$ Value will = best returns, if bfury are valued over 60$ on market, even with D2L cap, bfury = priority #1 for returns.  This is personal experience of over 500 bets/returns of these items.   Example  6 void hammers returning a stache, consistently.  **I'd need some kind of proof, I don't believe this to be true  I've seen numerous ""bitch"" posts or just in chat about getting trash returns on VP as well."

I'm sure vpgame has about the same amount of junk bets as with D2L on skewed games, what I believe VPgame is doing is absorbing the junk item costs and paying out higher value items at their own expense, something that D2L did not have to resort to all the while because it was either you accept their terms or you dont get to bet on a big doto betting platform at all.  They will most likely lose more money by implementing such a returns system(compared to their current one where they dont have to deal with boatloads of 0.03) but competition is always good for us consumers."

If you do invest  My #1 decision is decide what your goal is.   If goal equal = urn money than you're gonna want to start with the largest bank within your means and never buy back in if you lose, least not for a long break  If goal = have action while watching TI5 etc.. Than I suggest eatablishing a daily or weekly $USD amount and NEVER going over it. Example 80$ a week for ti5.

dota2loungebets,35satv,Ice_Cream_Warrior,1 point,Wed May 13 06:44:18 2015 UTC,You're more likely to win overall with more lower bets than a few huge bets. The doubling up or so of big bets is very attractive and will increase your items quickly but then you make one bad bet and your back to 0. In your case I would find an attractive bet in which you highly think the favourite should win but is maybe only rated 65-70% and bet one of the rapiers on that. Use those winnings and that one rapier and continue betting on some of those safe matches while using some of the 3-6 cent items to put on the underdogs you like. I would not sell both items and buy a lot of little items as you're going to be losing 20% with losses in trade values and steam percentage.

Select those which you think can give you better returns and think you can win that match. Even though they may look small but they are having more chances of not getting you bankrupt.   Wait for the odds to settle and then bet. Like about 15-30 mins before the match starts so that you have approximate idea of what you get/lose on betting on that series. Resist the temptation of getting rich just in a few days. Though you can get some wins and profit by doing that but in a long run, you will for sure end up getting fail. Mark my words. YOU WILL."

I faced the same problem you have: got some wins, tried to up my game and ended up where I started. I remember reading somewhere it's actually a psychological thing, that losing and winning streaks can cloud your thoughts and you make worse decision unintentionally.  Perhaps take it slower? After you get to $100-200 instead of betting bigger just stick with the amount that took you from $50 to $200, do that for a week or so and see what happen."

Recently there have been extended periods when the model completely stopped updating, which is fine for a free service, but not so much for a paid service. Does the discount work for payment in steam items? On the site it says if the amount paid in steam items exceeds the subscription price you will extend the subscription period accordingly, so if the amount is less than the price can it also be reduced accordingly? Do monthly subscriptions start and end each month, or are they for 30-day periods?"
dota2loungebets,359xho,fgiveme,2,Fri May 8 10:30:48 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your questions.   The site updates every 10 minutes. I redeveloped the program that updates the page and it had a couple of bugs that I have been ironing out as they appear. I'm getting an admin who is on the other side of the world (awake when I'm asleep) to help fix these sorts of issues. It will certainly be more reliable now but I obviously can't guarantee 100% up time. Yes, just send LONG20 in your steam offer comment If you send me a little less I'll give you a little less than a month's access. I'm not going to do anything like 1 day access though. They're for 30 day periods.   Update: I have worked for the last few hours on improving the site's reliability.

Completely different from a previous user here who would obnoxiously promote his ""betting predictions"" (old users will know who I'm talking about).  I haven't been too active in posting on this subreddit lately (or for a long time), but had to make this post as a thanks.  Your model helped me tremendously in the past.

dota2loungebets,359xho,caliako,3,Sat May 9 00:18:10 2015 UTC,"You say very successful, but can you post any graphs or charts about the overall stats to back up that claim?  For all we know successful could be breaking even or having 1 more month of positive over negative.    I mean not to sound negative, but without providing any hard information and facts backing this service up, if this was my first look I would probably think of this as a scam, where they just use a lot of leading statements to believe you can make easy money, while in reality you will be lucky to break even.    I want to state I don't think you are doing this.  However if you provided information and posted it such as $X, turned into $Y in one year, highest month was +A%, lowest month was +/-B%, average was C% etc can help inform potential buyers and get more business then simply stating ""successful"".  Regardless, good luck with the project!"
dota2loungebets,359xho,tzzer,1 point,Fri May 8 13:05:43 2015 UTC,"There's months of posts in this subreddit where I posted the output of the model each day, when the site was made public I stopped posting. But it's been running for nearly a year now.  I considered putting a results section on the website and even talked about it in the past. But I have decided not to because I can't really get a ""normal use"" case and I don't really think its fair to post anything else. I've thought a lot about this.  Here's why it's hard:   My bets are made straight after the lines go up on Pinnacle, before they appear on the site, completely automatically. It decides to bet at the open or not at all. This obviously is not ""normal use"". I bet at Pinnacle where the odds I get might be different to the odds you get if we were to bet on the same match (fixed odds).  The majority of people using the site bet at D2L and I never do. The odds differ slightly between Pinnacle and D2L. If you bet at D2L, and you bet early in the day, the odds can shift making it a -EV bet.   Although I put a lot of effort into maintaining the model to keep it as accurate as possible, past performance is not indicative of future results. Pinnacle might get better at setting lines and people might get better at betting, lowering the model's performance."

dota2loungebets,359xho,jukenasty,2,Fri May 8 13:34:11 2015 UTC,Sure. I should be able to do this for most matches. I'll look into doing it tomorrow.
dota2loungebets,359xho,nikohd,1 point,Fri May 8 15:32:05 2015 UTC,"A few suggestions/points to be noted.   I have noticed that model is not able to have higher chances of successful predictions when a recent patch change comes or a new meta is introduced. So if some large patch comes, the prediction will be from past cumulative results. Now suppose a team adapts to new patch better than any other team, they may become source of good profit being underdogs. Like what happened to Newbee after TI as a reverse case. It does not account for 322 cases, which happens alot in Chinese teams. I know that it is not able to predict that, but just mentioning. Users dont know whether the model has considered the standins or any problems the players are facing and their severity for e.g. eye problem of Jeyo or Pajkatt's girlfriend visa problem, etc. It may affect the output a lot, coz that time Rave was drawing Bo2 too much.   Will PM you if I forgot something or find something interesting to tell you.  And Goodluck for your product."
dota2loungebets,359xho,nikohd,1 point,Fri May 8 18:32:01 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your suggestions.   The model will soon automatically update itself as new matches come in. Currently I have to wait for a decent sample of games before I can adjust the model to be accurate in the new patch. This new system will have the model automatically ""learn"" how the patch has changed the game. So this will be improved in the near future. Yes, no way for the model to know this stuff. I'm thinking of how to improve the current system. The Reports system has made it much better than before but it still could be improved upon. This is a hard problem though :P"

dota2loungebets,359xho,mimecry,1 point,Sun May 10 06:34:30 2015 UTC,"Check the stats for iG and VG. They are teams which perform 322 the most. Don't forget Secret too. Do you really think that they can be outplayed by those Tier 2 teams? I mean I have seen VG coming back even from a 7k gold lead by enemy, for if they want to comeback and win the game. They themselves bet on matches they are going to throw. You must have not watched the games of these teams and what potential they have. You must have seen Burning, for example, doing serious amount of hardwork to get iG regain its name and soon after started playing as if has come to DoTA scene recently making poor game choices or trying something very absurd. I knew iG gonna throw against HGT during Summit qualifiers from a trusted source, that i put about 90% of my bankroll on that.(I never go beyond 5% of my bankroll.) Also i know that Chinese teams help other Chinese teams alot to come up and obtain their dominance in Dota, like any other sports they do. They even discuss these things to other teams that how they should proceed.They take Dota too much seriously. Coming to your Gosugamers concern, they don't get each and every info. Do you think these dota players be so much careless for such sensitive matters, like Team Redemption or Solo? I don't think so.  Hope you get your answers."
dota2loungebets,359xho,gaptaodomaysong,1 point,Sun May 10 11:05:55 2015 UTC,"this is fascinating stuff, thanks man. do 322s often occur between tier 2 and tier 3 chinese teams as well, or just the top dogs?"
dota2loungebets,359xho,gaptaodomaysong,1 point,Tue May 12 10:07:11 2015 UTC,For tier 2/3 teams they tend to do 322 in case they have bigger events in front of them or matches on same day. In that case they choose to play well in matches/tournament which they think have more importance for example in terms of prize pool or higher chances of winning.

dota2loungebets,34xbwq,egeerdogan,2,Tue May 5 10:00:04 2015 UTC,Possibly a little more valuable than the ti4 original immortals because there are 8 as opposed to 6 in the chest and leveling it up is way more expensive since you can't buy compendium points on the market anymore. It will heavily depend on how many people are willing to spend money to get multiple immortals. Seems almost impossible to do it through game play... Played probably 12 games since the compendium release and only got one drop of a each 25 xp and 25 coins.
dota2loungebets,34xbwq,Chomatoo,2,Tue May 5 14:43:55 2015 UTC,"well im guessing they will be more expensive then ti4 immortals, since last year it was  so easy to level up with a lot of point drops and the market also had 25 points going for 10c a pop, this year however its nearly impossible to level up without buying points other then the compendium challenges which will only give you a limited amount of points granted you can actually win them but also remember that this year more people got the compendium, the stretch goals are done really faster as well, so overall i think they will be more expensive then ti4 immortals, but not by a huge margin"
dota2loungebets,34xbwq,reapr56,1 point,Tue May 5 15:20:00 2015 UTC,Probably a little bit lower than ti4 immortal. Even that enigma bracer won't be worth much more than a void hammer.
dota2loungebets,34xbwq,manojk92,1 point,Tue May 5 11:51:13 2015 UTC,Immortals 1 and 2 are going to be shit like TI4 ones. Immortal 3 might be a bit better since they're kinda hard to obtain. But they'll still be pretty low probably like the TI3 cheap ones.

They snowball really fast if you're doing it safe). Tada, mission unlocked, comeback achieved.  Or the fast way: Buy arcana or higher value bet items with real money."

dota2loungebets,34ay8h,jawman,7,Wed Apr 29 18:26:03 2015 UTC,"No-- if anything the value will go up in time. It follows the same general trend: initial decrease during 1-3 months of compendium and trove releases, then the price either returns to what it is now, if not higher.  Many sharks will try to dissuade you into selling your items now, just so that they can resell when the time comes. Don't buy into the bullshit or hype. Good luck."
dota2loungebets,34ay8h,tishstars,2,Wed Apr 29 18:47:52 2015 UTC,"I do strongly believe that golden items will fall , as more golden items will be released this TI.  For example, the http://steamcommunity.com/market/listings/570/Genuine%20Golden%20Pale%20Mausoleum . It peaked as the demand was HIGH during the TI time and dropped substantially as more troves (supply) were open. The basic principle of supply and demand from my Economics 201 class.  Low supply, high demand = HIGH prices like the undying item $170+ USD.  After troves were post TI,  High supply, low demand = Dropped in prices. $70+ USD  Another variable that you have to add in is ""how popular that hero is in the Current META.  Undying isn't that popular now, just like how the golden severing crest Razor helm is.  They both went from $150+ USD items to near $70+ USD.  Odds are people that have TI4 golden items will sell, and flood the market, reducing the prices of items to trade up for TI5 golden items. Sure they're eventually recover but probably to around like the price of a Stache?  I foresee the price of mausoleums dropping by around 10-upwards of 20%.  Remember that TI4 golden items are probably going to be competing with TI5 golden items.  Therefore, it'll cause a DROP in prices.  This is all my opinion, and neither am I persuading you to sell.  That's for you to decide."
dota2loungebets,34ay8h,wlam,1 point,Wed Apr 29 21:27:57 2015 UTC,"For most things, the price will drop because people will probably be buying compendiums and point packs. But golden immortals are pretty rare, and the Demiheroes are sold out on Valves site (I think they are still in stock at the EU site that sells Dota stuff). So this could point to something like a Demiheroes #2 with new items, bringing in new items and removing the first golden immortals. In my opinion, hold on to it."
dota2loungebets,34ay8h,afiresword,1 point,Wed Apr 29 21:04:18 2015 UTC,"A. The Law of Demand  The law of demand states that, if all other factors remain equal, the higher the price of a good, the less people will demand that good. In other words, the higher the price, the lower the quantity demanded. The amount of a good that buyers purchase at a higher price is less because as the price of a good goes up, so does the opportunity cost of buying that good. As a result, people will naturally avoid buying a product that will force them to forgo the consumption of something else they value more. The chart below shows that the curve is a downward slope. B. The Law of Supply   Like the law of demand, the law of supply demonstrates the quantities that will be sold at a certain price. But unlike the law of demand, the supply relationship shows an upward slope. This means that the higher the price, the higher the quantity supplied. Producers supply more at a higher price because selling a higher quantity at a higher price increases revenue. C. Supply and Demand Relationship   Now that we know the laws of supply and demand, let's turn to an example to show how supply and demand affect price. Imagine that a special edition CD of your favorite band is released for $20. Because the record company's previous analysis showed that consumers will not demand CDs at a price higher than $20, only ten CDs were released because the opportunity cost is too high for suppliers to produce more. If, however, the ten CDs are demanded by 20 people, the price will subsequently rise because, according to the demand relationship, as demand increases, so does the price. Consequently, the rise in price should prompt more CDs to be supplied as the supply relationship shows that the higher the price, the higher the quantity supplied. If, however, there are 30 CDs produced and demand is still at 20, the price will not be pushed up because the supply more than accommodates demand. In fact after the 20 consumers have been satisfied with their CD purchases, the price of the leftover CDs may drop as CD producers attempt to sell the remaining ten CDs. The lower price will then make the CD more available to people who had previously decided that the opportunity cost of buying the CD at $20 was too high. D. Equilibrium  When supply and demand are equal (i.e. when the supply function and demand function intersect) the economy is said to be at equilibrium. At this point, the allocation of goods is at its most efficient because the amount of goods being supplied is exactly the same as the amount of goods being demanded. Thus, everyone (individuals, firms, or countries) is satisfied with the current economic condition. At the given price, suppliers are selling all the goods that they have produced and consumers are getting all the goods that they are demanding.  As you can see on the chart, equilibrium occurs at the intersection of the demand and supply curve, which indicates no allocative inefficiency. At this point, the price of the goods will be P* and the quantity will be Q*. These figures are referred to as equilibrium price and quantity.  In the real market place equilibrium can only ever be reached in theory, so the prices of goods and services are constantly changing in relation to fluctuations in demand and supply.   Also, see inflation"

Anyway the best way was to watch teams in my opinion.  Some teams get hot, others are on a drought.    There is no safe bet, do your homework and research teams and trends and be wary of team positioning.  If a team has no possible way of advancing, they may use a cheese strat or just kinda fool around.  Also make sure you have the inventory to cover a few losses in a row.  Don't get wiped out on a few bad breaks or lost bets.  Try to avoid ""sure bets"", they usually pay out little to nothing, but if you loose, you loose big."

dota2loungebets,344lrf,tzzer,1 point,Tue Apr 28 08:40:12 2015 UTC,"Based on my experiences, one should never all in. Going all in show your greediness and your stupidity that you are ready to lose all your hard earned items in one bet, in case there is some factors like 322, DDOS, etc. due to which the sure team may get defeated.   I am sure that many who says all in for a game/series on this subreddit, may be just fooling around or short time betters. You can check for the good betters here, even when they are sure the team may get a win, they bet around 10% or 30% max. This enables you that even if you lose, you have something to start over with inspite of buying new items and again tend to fail and end up being caught in a losing loop or on a tilt."

(well, its not literally all-in since d2l only limits bets at six items) it is as if im just betting trashes. but seriously tho, i will not recommend it. [tilting is a shit feeling] especially in cases such as 90-10 or 80-20. 70-30 seems like a bonus but its risky. id rather go all in in cases such as 60-40 or 50-50. ironically, that's way riskier. but here's the real catch. just be familiar with the teams and always consider the odds. tbh, im more comfortable in betting in SEA matches than in NA or EU. i guess the locality is a factor.   nb. i got rekt weeks after DAC and majority of my winnings were put to shit. i stopped betting then. how i got back? rave vs (i think its) underminer; when some members of rave were stuck in PH while other were in KOR. now if you are a filipino too, you should know how inferior our internet is. at that moment, i'm quite 99 percent sure that rave will lose. that's locality haha!"
dota2loungebets,344lrf,tishstars,1 point,Tue Apr 28 18:17:54 2015 UTC,"The problem is that many of these teams intentionally throw games based on risk-reward of getting caught, potential prize awards, and ability to throw games based on where they are on the bracket. Obviously D2L is involved with such insidious dealings, and as such, not even the ""safe"" bets are safe. Add into this the intuitive issue of teams getting cocky and trying out new strats and you don't have ""safe"" games very often."

dota2loungebets,33tdv1,synthstatic,1 point,Sat Apr 25 13:18:46 2015 UTC,? I don't understand. I've heard people talk about it but what exactly is it?
dota2loungebets,33tdv1,rivatia,1 point,Sat Apr 25 13:20:40 2015 UTC,ask urself: why didnt i go all in on my first bet?
dota2loungebets,33tdv1,synthstatic,1 point,Sat Apr 25 13:29:36 2015 UTC,"pretty much an unwise bet you're more likely to make when you're on a poor streak, one which you usually wouldn't were you betting logically and/or on a good streak of wins."
dota2loungebets,33tdv1,Chomatoo,1 point,Sat Apr 25 14:00:11 2015 UTC,Tilt betting is when you essentially chase your losses by moving up stakes or taking high risks to try and win back what you lost. A phrase most commonly associated with poker I think for when someone starts playing wildly after losing a hand they should've won on a one outer on the river or lose with AA v KK all in preflop or something.
dota2loungebets,33tdv1,YourFavoriteRetard,1 point,Sat Apr 25 15:55:15 2015 UTC,You know what you should do you should stop betting for a while give it a rest  give yourself some other things todo for a while say for a month stop betting its going to eat you alive and let you spend more money just to bet. if i were you quit betting for now man.

Be calm.  Don't bet everything anywhere.  Good luck."
dota2loungebets,33tdv1,SomeGuy71,1 point,Sun Apr 26 15:11:05 2015 UTC,Kelly Criterion? What's that?
dota2loungebets,33tdv1,SomeGuy71,1 point,Sat Apr 25 13:37:11 2015 UTC,"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelly_criterion#Statement  You will want to reduce the % of your stack size it tells you to bet.  Also, the bot doesn't capture the equation, go to the wiki page."
dota2loungebets,33tdv1,SomeGuy71,2,Sat Apr 25 13:46:42 2015 UTC,What's b? I understand the rest of it but I can't figure out b. Is it how much money you win from one dollar?
dota2loungebets,33tdv1,SomeGuy71,1 point,Sat Apr 25 13:48:39 2015 UTC,"yes, not including the $1 you put in and get back."
dota2loungebets,33tdv1,autowikibot,1 point,Sat Apr 25 14:08:01 2015 UTC,So if I have 38 dollars and the odds are 63% for the team i'm going for and b is .6 for 1 it would be 38 = .60*63 - 37 / 6  = $13? It doesn't seem like i'm doing it correctly. Then if I divide it by 2 it would be around 5 bucks.
dota2loungebets,33tdv1,TukangLedeng,1 point,Sat Apr 25 14:09:11 2015 UTC,"(.63 * ( 0.6 + 1 ) - 1) / .6 = 1.3%  And that makes sense.  The odds are about where they should be; you're getting a very even return, there's not a lot of reason to bet a lot on it.  Are you ... using DOTA 2 longues odds on a match?    The odds are something you supply based off your evaluations of both teams, and you're probably not going to have better than 5-10% accuracy on it."
dota2loungebets,33tdv1,lethalbuff,1 point,Sat Apr 25 14:17:16 2015 UTC,Why do the .6+1 if you're going to subtract if anyways? And where does the 1 come from? Sorry i'm not good at math.
dota2loungebets,33tdv1,soonique,1 point,Sat Apr 25 15:36:48 2015 UTC,"The 1's come from a substitution where your probability of losing is the compliment of your probability of winning; you either win or lose, so ... p + q = 100%, q = 1 - p.      You're multiplying something else before subtracting the 1.  (.63 * ( 0.6 + 1 ) - 1) / .6  (.63 * (1.6) - 1 ) / .6  ( 1.008 - 1 ) / .6  ( 0.008 ) / .6  0.01333"
dota2loungebets,33tdv1,wad3v3r,1 point,Sun Apr 26 00:31:41 2015 UTC,So it always stays as 1? You don't change it?
dota2loungebets,33tdv1,ikarnus,1 point,Sun Apr 26 02:15:42 2015 UTC,"I'll walk through an example.  I look at Alliance vs C9 today.  I think Secret threw against Alliance last time and now Alliance is hyped.  I think C9 is a solid team that was really competing against VG and Alliance has been pretty weak as of late.  I think the Odds are really about 20% for Alliance and 80% for C9.  So based off the criterion here, I should bet...  (0.8 * (0.7 + 1) - 1) / 0.7 = (1.36 - 1 ) / (0.7) = 51% of my stack  Now I'm going to always scale down my stack % from the Kelly Criterion by a third, because it helps insulate me from days where I have bad judgement / can't make good evaluations...  51% / 3 = 17% of my stack.  Note:  Just an example.  Do more research for how you figure out the odds."

If i remember correctly i got around more than 3000 trash com/unc.  Have made almost 100$ with those trash along with low-price-unable-to-bet things such as kinetic gems (i keep reoffer bots on d2l until i got it, for example bladebiter/odachi, or puck/kunkka tide bringer/silent ripper/omoz, ect.) and other things that has value < 1."

If you sold your high valued items now, it is likely you can earn a few dollars by buying them back later. Trading nowadays is so difficult because almost everyone's trying to earn that small lil bit of profit. Downside of buying/selling on market could be the 7 days restriction, or the fact that you don't even know for sure if you will make a profit or not."

I know if someone offers me something for me item, I'll more likely accept if he offered immortals.  No other items have stable price as those but you can also get Gleaming seal(PA weapon, scythe 1$), Mantas(AM weapon 2.5$ main hand and offhand).

dota2loungebets,33gnpd,jasndream,3,Wed Apr 22 11:10:25 2015 UTC,"I'm only considering 4 contenders to win atm. VG, iG, secret, and c9. Would've added alliance if this was a few weeks earlier, recently they've just been kinda shaky.   Vg - strongest team coming into this tournament. They play well every phase of the game and generally have very solid drafts. Imo the favorites to win due to their consistently high performance.   IG - somewhat of an underdog in my final four. They have all the tools to beat any team in this bracket and have shown that they can perform at LAN by winning major all star in Malaysia. Obviously the competition was not as strong as this tournament but empire and nip aren't really pushovers either. They are most likely going to play secret in the second round of the brackets and I think their chances really will be decided there. Upper bracket has a 1 game adv and I can't see them winning vs secret or vg in the finals being down 0-1 to start. I think the odds here are decent, might be a good value bet  Secret - after their 15-0 hype at dac secret has definitely not lived up to that. They've dropped games against teams like m5 and sfz and just generally have not played as well as expected. They've also showed their vulnerability by dropping 0-2 to alliance a few weeks ago. That being said they're still one of the top 2 teams in the west. Again I think their fate is decided by their second round performance most likely vs iG. I cannot see secret winning vs vg coming from loser bracket being down 0-1. I think their chances very close to iG.   C9 - the dark horse of the tournament imo. They got rekt by secret recently but overall have performed amazingly for the last few weeks. They ran through the summit losers bracket to win the qualifiers dropping all of the top teams in Europe other than secret. Their chances of winning are low as their second round is most likely vs VG. Maybe ee will pull out some strat to catch them off guard who knows. Overall I'll give c9 like a 5% chance of winning.   Other teams are very unlikely to win given the nature of this tournament. It's right before a patch so teams won't hide their shit. And none of that bullshit ""teams will lose on purpose in winners to drop to losers and save strats for the finals"". With a 1-0 adv coming from winner bracket, teams are going to try their best to win every series.   Conclusion: 4 teams have chances to win. 50% vg, 25% secret, 20% iG, and 5% c9.   Gl"
dota2loungebets,33gnpd,Wobbly_Radish,2,Wed Apr 22 13:47:56 2015 UTC,"For anybody wondering, here's the tournament bracket.   http://wiki.teamliquid.net/dota2/Star_Ladder_Star_Series/Season_12  The tournament is Double Elimination, so you won't be eliminated if you lose a set, but note that there IS a Winner's Bracket advantage. From the Teamliquid page:   Grand Finals is a best of five with a one map advantage for the team coming from the winners' bracket.      I'd also like to point out you're only betting for first place. There's no consolation prize for your team placing second or third. With that in mind, I'd recommend not placing a bet on LondonC, Alliance, or Team Tinker. Cloud9 and Team Malaysia seem like a good value bet, but note their placement in the tournament bracket. Cloud9 should win against Team Tinker, but they're basically guaranteed to face Vici Gaming in the next round. Team Malaysia on the other hand has been showing a very dominant performance, but it's only been against weaker teams in the SEA scene. I don't think they've played against any top tier team as of yet.. And to further lower their chances, they face Team Secret in the first round, and probably Invictus Gaming in the second. That is going to be difficult.  I'd say Team Secret or Vici Gaming are the two teams with the highest chance to take the tournament. I'd say at least one of them should clear out the Winner's Bracket with the map advantage, as they are on opposite sides of the bracket. That being said, Invictus Gaming's odds are definitely undeserving for a team of their caliber. Although I don't think they'll take the tournament in the end, it would definitely not be surprising if they did. They are a very strong team that are should be the same level as Vici Gaming and their results would definitely depict that, but for whatever reason, they just can't seem to defeat Vici Gaming. If they had some yield for placing second or third, they would definitely be my pick, but because this is only for first place, I do think they'll be facing Vici Gaming eventually, so I can't bring myself to bet on them, given the fact that they have not taken a single set off Vici Gaming this year. Cloud9 on the other hand, they were looking promising just a week or so ago, going on an extended ten game win streak, with a small hiccup to end it, and then ultimately falling 0-2 against Team Secret. I feel like they are sort of the same case as Invictus Gaming is with Vici Gaming, but to a lesser extent. They haven't beaten Team Secret this year, but they definitely should have won their DAC match against them, so I don't think Team Secret are kyrptonite to Cloud9. Cloud9's placement is actually very favourable, placing against Team Tinker in Round 1. But the fact of the matter is that they are almost definitely going to be facing Vici Gaming and Team Secret/Invictus Gaming afterwards. It's not going to be easy. I'd like to say that they are definitely a good value bet, which they are, (10:1!) but with their track record of never placing first (Except a single odd tournament with four teams.), I cannot bring myself to bet on them with Dota2Lounge's current Starladder betting format.  Phew.. That was a long write-up. I'm personally going to be betting on Team Secret due to favouritism, but I'd say Vici Gaming would probably be the best bet.. I'm not sure why their odds are better than Team Secret, they just won a LAN 3-1 for crying out loud. Invictus Gaming would be my value bet though. Although they haven't beaten Vici Gaming, that doesn't mean it's not possible and should Cloud9 beat Vici Gaming, I'd definitely say Invictus Gaming can defeat Cloud9.   NOTE: I HOLD ALL RESPONSIBILITY TO YOUR LOSS BETS. REMEMBER THAT I AM THE REASON YOU LOST YOUR BET, NOT ANYBODY OR ANYTHING ELSE.  Anyways, for you lazy people..  TL;DR: Vici Gaming > Team Secret > Invictus Gaming (Value bet!)"

Considering that VG just has to beat cloud9/Tinker who they can probably take, and that either IG or secret will be forced to duke it out in the Losers bracket, and risks sudden and unfortunate elimination, VG is mathematically the safest bet.  However, if Secret makes it to the finals I think they can take VG down.  Im not too excited about the prospect of IG winning. They have the potential to take Secret down with their patient Chinese gameplay, but  not VG. Theyve lost to them too many times for me to believe in them."

dota2loungebets,33g8ee,nevermindthebbb,10,Wed Apr 22 07:10:39 2015 UTC,"In short: no  And here are just some of my platonic thoughts just solely based on my time with poker.  First of, this is quite different to traditional sports betting. There are some parameters that can be equated and data's can be mined, but at the end of it, there's a huge swing in variance that cannot be accounted for when we measure match-ups.  Liquidity  Unfortunately, the avenue that provides the most approachable way of profiting, also is the avenue that do not provide value liquidity. Where in sports bettings and poker where currency is finite, crowd funded betting matchups, that provide the best platform for investment such as D2L only allows for item betting. Whilst the argument is that the counter-act to this is to sell the item immediately or within reasonable amount of time, for anyone that wants to do this remotely close to full time will need to have constant need for their bankroll. That means easy accessibility to the items and currency to bet. Volatility of the market, and being subjected to such an unstable form of market evaluation, such as the steam market, makes for a very very risky form of sustainability, say comparing to currency (USD, Euro etc). Just this alone should be a big factor in evaluating how far to push this solely because everything hinges on an unregulated, unconformed steam market as opposed to currencies.  Volume  The best way to be sustainable, is to have enough volume of games. And at this stage, this form of investment is hamstrung on   Website provider Variability   Sure VP games is providing extra forms of betting, but even with that, it is not quantifiable mathematically, and it's still very low in volume. Professional poker players rake in thousands of hands in a day, grind for 10-18 hours a day to deal with variables and mathematical variances. Professional sports bettor have a wide spread of games that they cover allowing for volume betting as well. I talked with Ranogajec through a mutual friend once, and the level of information and network of spotters that he has is something till this day, completely astounds me. This is just something we cannot penetrate at this stage, at least on a wide array of teams.  Regulation  In some ways, betting is not regulated. And that, in it's essence should be the biggest detriment to doing this full time. There's no overseers to ensure that the crowd fund provider are audited, monitored, and regulated. Sure, pinnacle and other cash bet sites have proper regulation in place. However, the rake that they take makes it mathematically harder to sustain over a longer period of time. Also with no proper administration of match fixing and also due to the variety of tournaments and structures, there's the element of lackadaisical approach that teams take which can hinder a betting approach. Abstaining these games is an option, but back to the point of volume, we do not get enough LAN tournaments or big tournaments that allows most games analysis to pull through.    There are other factors that are involved, which should be cue in point to consider. For this to be anywhere close to making a living, you have to be pulling at least 5 figures to ensure that your bank roll can absorb bad days, and what happens during barren tournament times. Especially after TI, which we'll see teams taking breaks. There's no consistency and no backup where else most professional bettors have a juggernaut of other platforms to bet (yes, CSGO is also an option), but it all hinges on one solidarity power, Valve.   Also, if you are racking in high 4 to 5 figures monthly, consider this; I once played poker full time for 2 years. 2011-2013. I took a break from work and made a living just off poker. When Black Friday came, myself and a few of other good mates around the world went through a terrible time since our bankroll were completely frozen, and we relied on it to continue touring and playing. Suffice to say, it took me close to 2 years to withdraw the substantial amount of funds off the provider.   I am only assuming, you are mostly still item betting, and if anything, you stand at a higher precipice of bankroll deficiency due to the nature of the currency used in betting. Continue doing what you are doing, but don't ever make this your sole bread and butter because it is simply not sustainable.    Also, the best approach to betting, is always having a good bank roll management, which I have no doubt you have a good grasp.  To further expand on the issue I have with Dota/CSGO betting for me personally, especially on the volume availability, I wish to share a games betting experiment on one of my other account that has strict bank roll management etiquette.   Never betting more than 15% of bank roll, no matter how good the odds, no matter how high the +EV. Abstaining on all games with teams that has new roster until their 5-6th game Abstaining first day bets on LAN tournaments Abstaining from games where teams have a high history of DDoS Only betting on teams that I've watched played at least 2 series.   This is the current graph of the grind.   Started with $200 worth of items, and as you can see, it is extremely hard to practice good betting etiquette, and move up concisely if we were to follow this paradigm. The problem is volume. Just not enough games worthwhile to bet if we were to follow a strict long term regime aka making a living out of it.  And I also know this betting paradigm is best catered for the long run as much as I would like to have the same liberal betting on my main account which has raked up close to 5 figures now. But since I know this isn't something I'm making a living, being liberal helps since a lot of this gives very high ROI if anyone is astute in their approach to it. But being liberal means that this winning can also evaporate in a whiff.  In short, do what you do right now, enjoy it.   Making a living out of it? No. Too many negative variables attached at the moment. But there's nothing ever wrong with making extras out of it, like you are at this stage. Have an escape plan, ensure that this, isn't your living. It's your luxury."
dota2loungebets,33g8ee,JothHago,2,Wed Apr 22 08:53:00 2015 UTC,"I agree with your reply mainly because anyone that could ""make a living"" wouldn't be asking ""if"" they could.   Betting real money (legally) Esports is an untapped market for professional gamblers, for the most part.   Yes, there is much less money to be made overall, but much less competition.   Now, saying that. Guys that are reading this. You're going to want to avoid quitting your day job. Ideally, you'd want a 5,000$ bank and if you're reading here for advice, you're setting up for failure.   This is in no way hating on this sub. I love /r/d2lb but your op tells me you're not a pro, neither am I or 99% of gamblers.   Check statistics. Numbers don't lie.   I only know 2 pros personally, betting on DOTA 2 (not their main sport) and have seen first hand how a gambling addiction destroys lives.   Think it over for at least 2 weeks minimum OP. And research the hell out of professional gambling.   This is not for people that got below a B in any math course.   My 2 cents"
dota2loungebets,33g8ee,Bizarro-aka-WhOaMi,2,Wed Apr 22 13:51:47 2015 UTC,"yeah i am by no means a pro. pros have runners and models similar to savinoxo's which i follow a lot. idk how he gets his numbers, but his model has some weaknesses like severely underrating new/unknown teams. nevertheless, i have built up a decent bankroll from following the model along with my gut, so i can't thank him enough. i've spoken to him a few times thru pm's and he definitely knows his shit. anyone who wants to build up their bankroll slowly and steadily should follow his model.  tbh, math isn't much of a necessity for professional gamblers. they place a lot more focus on statistics and programming. one simple and popular application of statistics to gambling is using poisson distribution on soccer totals. math was my best subject in uni, and statistics was my worst :) never got more than a C+ in stat.  my bankroll atm isn't where i want it to be until i quit my job, but it's more than $5000, including my csgo inventory but not my initial investment which i have already cashed out. it's actually really easy to make a decent living off betting once you're betting half your country's monthly minimum wage per bet. not saying that i'm a high roller or anything, it's just that the cost of living here is very low. i could probably eat a decent 3 meals for $4-5 a day.  thanks for your input!"

Liquidity:  yup, this is a huge problem that i didn't really see. although it is very unlikely, valve could change the economy of betting with literally one push of a button and i get fucked. i remember having like 50 lina arcs sitting in my invent when valve had that lina arcana sale, that was pretty horrible.  Edit cause my phone autosent an unfinished post  Volume  volume atm is very good since i discovered vpgame. there is a TON of value in f10's imo even though they may seem like degen bets, not to mention the many nba/soccer bets that have off lines compared to pinny which are obviously +EV. along with csgo, volume shouldn't be much of a problem for me. there are about 40-50 games to bet on per day  (including f10s and handicaps and csgo) which is more than enough imo. there also isnt a cs/dota offseason apart from the few weeks after TI anyway.  Regulation  this ties in with the first problem liquidity. the economy is fragile and inefficient, esp with 1 power being able to do what it wants with it. i've been thinking about depositing into pinny, but i've discovered that it's such a pain in the ass that i'll probably put it off until i bet more seriously. pinny openers have been weak ever since they started offering dota 2 bets. it is definitely beatable w/ discipline and a decent bankroll.  right now i make sure to not bet more than 7% of my roll. my roll isn't the biggest now cause i bought a bunch of useless csgo shit for myself and my friends, but my max bet should go down to 3.5% once my bankroll gets bigger  about black friday in poker: yikes, that would be a nightmare for all of us if something similar would happen with d2l/csgl. sirscoots actually reported csgl to the FBI for underage betting LOL. it's a longshot that the fbi closes down csgl but it's a possibility nonetheless."

Would it still be worth all that stress and anxiety you place on yourself, even if you are successful? For me, man, living so close to the edge is not worth it.   Might be for someone else, but not for me. My advice: don't quit your job. If its shitty enough to make you consider quitting to pursue betting, get a different job >.<.  EDIT: I'm pretty trash tier compared to some of you guys :)"

Make sure you've a backup plan and don't end up unemployed after betting.  Working 45+ years, betting maybe 5 years or only 2 years, who knows.

However, I do have a few suggestions about the system:   The reporting system: I don't think this will work if you are thinking of letting random people report stuff. Maybe only let a few trusted people do it? This should alleviate your workload processing all the report as well as concerns that the reports are fake. I may have over think this tho. I also don't think email is the way to go here for reports, possibly something easier to skim should work better for you. (a table maybe? just the first idea that pops up into my head).  Automation wise, you are right, the model does need more automation. You could do it this way, but I think it will take up too much of your time and attention. However, I can't think of any way else to do it besides having other people to do it for you. A new team shouldn't really be a problem since it should be pretty rare? I'm kinda new to the betting scene so I don't really know how many pop up/season.   Just my 2c:D."
dota2loungebets,338glz,fgiveme,1 point,Mon Apr 20 18:03:36 2015 UTC,"You may be right, we will see how it goes. I will probably add an email address to the reports pages so that I know if I see someone who's trusted. This is also why I have the ""post a link to where you found out about this"". I can always change later if it becomes a problem. What do you mean a table? Like a table of the lineup for each team? And a table for the Pinnacle -> Model Name and D2L -> Model Name? There's a couple of ""new"" teams to the model every month I think. This will take up much less time and attention than if someone sends me a vague email saying ""so and so is standing in"". I think it's good to have a standardised reporting thing, but you're right it may be better to have a few people help out with this. We'll see how it goes.   Thanks for your input."

dota2loungebets,32xz7a,JothHago,1 point,Fri Apr 17 18:21:19 2015 UTC,"Joth, has given you great advice, as he did with me when I started.   About MM. Be aware their only job is to record the trade agreement, make sure neither trader has  scammer tags, and hold the item/s until verification of the money transfer is complete. They cannot protect you from a chargeback.Read the guides  If you want to cash out easily, with no hassle, and little time invested I'll buy your stashes at re-seller prices through a non chargeback payment method. I prefer BTC.  Wire transfer/w.u. are other options but high fees.   Check my steamrep, repthread, submitted, gilded, etc   I sell / have sold to many subscribers of this subreddit.   GL either way. I was the same way when i started and it took me forever to commit.   I eventually decided what loss I could live with and sold 1-3 at a time."
dota2loungebets,32xz7a,JothHago,3,Sat Apr 18 00:00:41 2015 UTC,"I'd pitch in a few words hopefully it can alleviate some fears and provide some clarification  Firstly, it's good to be cautious, but do not be overly cautious. This will sometimes work against your favor because I've talked to a few people that started out and this fear causes immense amount of paranoia and just internal struggle mentally to go through the trade, making is extremely hard for all parties involved  Secondly, if you read through this two guides   Common trade scam Real world trading   You will get a 50-70% grasp of the terminology and normality of trading.   Thirdly, manage your expectations. The exact reasoning's to why people always say steam market value != cash money can be intricate, so I'll leave the verbosity out. Why I say manage your expectation, is because we in the mod team have received countless of traders being scammed because of their greed. Staches $60 in market? Okay, I ain't taking any less than $55.  This itself will automatically make you extremely susceptible, and you can be extra cautious but you'd likely end up getting sick and tired vetting out potential buyers. Legitimate, trustworthy buyers, that not only are not out to scam, but also have good cash trading reputation is paramount in your quest to sell, especially if you're going down the path of PayPal.  There'll be individuals that insists on getting max value, to which I will never dissuade. However, it's their own prerogative to do that privately because publicly on /r/Dota2Trade or just advertising on dota2lounge itself wouldn't get you anywhere close to these amounts. Quite simply, why would someone pay $55 for these items when they can get sellers from 43-45 at the moment, that should be the question you'd pose to yourself.  Once you've figured your expectation, the next bit is to vet out your buyers. This isn't hard one bit. Unfortunately, /r/Dota2Trade has become the hive for scammers, and they are swarming in like bees to honey. There's nothing we can do at this juncture to stop this. We can only advise users that posts to   Ignore 90% of friend requests If you wish to accept friend requests, find source. Either suss out their user name, match their flair, or ensure that they have fair amount of value on their steam account (refer to the guide above). Steamrep should be your first line of defense. Always check the users that adds you, against steamrep.  Impersonation is also a common practice, but if you always compare their steam64ID instead of custom name, there's almost 0% chance you'd get scammed via this. Never go first. There are few rules to this when you're familiar with trading but my word of advise is, never go first. Steamrep has affiliated middleman here, and /r/Dota2Trade has 3 official middlemen as well, all between themselves, have MM for over 5 figures worth of item value. Always message us in the modmail if you have questions Don't assume, ask. More often than not, you'd find people more than willing to help out when needed. Modmail's also an option.   Of course, the next few bits are ensuring you don't get chargedback from PayPal. But the guide should be imperative to give you a first understanding on it.  Depending on your location, you should consider   Bank transfer Bitcoin Western Union for bulk, and split fees   Either way, any traders will tell you, as long as you're not cavalier in your approach and you manage expectation, likelihood to be scammed is nearly 0%.   Good luck"
dota2loungebets,32xz7a,kf_parasite,1 point,Fri Apr 17 18:22:11 2015 UTC,"First of all, thanks a lot of this detailed response.   A few questions:    Approximately how long would it take for me to sell 30 staches at 45, and do people generally buy in bulk? Moreover, is 45 perhaps a little too high? If so, what would be a more suitable number.  Does the credibility of the buyer still matter if there's a middleman?  How do middlemen work? Do they take my items, then the money of the other person, and swap that out or something? Do they require fees for doing so? If so, how much, and who generally pays? It's my understanding that PayPal is essentially totally unreliable, and that I should avoid it at all costs unless dealing with someone with really high rep (which I still feel I'm susceptible to getting tricked in that regard). Is that correct? What's the next best alternative for money transfer? I'd rather avoid bank transfers and bitcoin, so would Western Union ultimately be what I'm looking to use here? In which case, how does splitting the transaction fee work?  Assuming Western Union is to be used only in the case of bulk trades, how common are those? Are there a lot of people out there willing to shell out a grand for some hats? If WU is to be used exclusively in the case of bulk trades, what then would be my next best alternative for smaller transfers? I'd rather not anyone prior to speaking with them, or having them post on the subreddit. Am I unreasonable to require that? Will that scare people off? Should I change my reddit name as people have suggested, as to not come off as vulnerable?"
dota2loungebets,32xz7a,kf_parasite,1 point,Fri Apr 17 18:57:38 2015 UTC,"Approximately how long would it take for me to sell 30 staches at 45, and do people generally buy in bulk? Moreover, is 45 perhaps a little too high? If so, what would be a more suitable number   Unless you can find a reseller or a big time gambler, selling 30 at once is rather impractical. Anyone wanting to buy 30 at once will likely ask for a slight discount. Just like any market place, your prerogative. $45 is pretty much the top ceiling for a realistic price. You can hold out for that price, or if you want to move it, you can find buyers easily @ 40-42   Does the credibility of the buyer still matter if there's a middleman?   Yes. Credibility of the buyer especially on paypal to ensure that chargeback chances are minimal. Middleman just facilitates ensuring that they hold the item. They don't provide immunity to chargeback.   How do middlemen work? Do they take my items, then the money of the other person, and swap that out or something? Do they require fees for doing so? If so, how much, and who generally pays?   Middleman will usually invite both users to group chat, finalize trade agreement, screen shot all details. They'll hold your item, and then only trade it off to the buyer when the funds received on your end. No swapping of any sorts. It is paramount that if you use MM to get the right one. Tips, 1-3% depending on MM. No rules set in stone on who pays tips.    It's my understanding that PayPal is essentially totally unreliable, and that I should avoid it at all costs unless dealing with someone with really high rep (which I still feel I'm susceptible to getting tricked in that regard). Is that correct?   Yes   What's the next best alternative for money transfer? I'd rather avoid bank transfers and bitcoin, so would Western Union ultimately be what I'm looking to use here? In which case, how does splitting the transaction fee work?   Yes on WU. Fees would be established prior to trade. Seller/buyer prerogative. WU fees are higher and depending on the country, up to 10%.   Assuming Western Union is to be used only in the case of bulk trades, how common are those? Are there a lot of people out there willing to shell out a grand for some hats? If WU is to be used exclusively in the case of bulk trades, what then would be my next best alternative for smaller transfers?   A grand is miniscule. There are still trades going about for items up to 5-10k USD. WU can be enforced regardless of amount. I've seen people insisting on WU even for $50USD. Again, sellers prerogative.   I'd rather not anyone prior to speaking with them, or having them post on the subreddit. Am I unreasonable to require that? Will that scare people off?   Sentencing seems a little off. If i'm understanding it right, then no. It is not unreasonable. It is a turn off, but since I'm used to trading, I personally find that a turn off. I can understand for new users to insist on that. You can always ascertain their identity before accepting any invites (via reddit UID)   Should I change my reddit name as people have suggested, as to not come off as vulnerable?   Irrelevant. Even with my post history and my mod status, there will still be inevitable for me to get the invites. That will never stop scammers from trying. You can always find out if they are serious just buy their reddit account posting history, dota 2 rep threads."

dota2loungebets,32xz7a,babyjesusftw1,2,Wed Apr 22 05:42:44 2015 UTC,"Don't use the same account to ask for advice when you try to sell them.  A lot of scammers lurk dota2trade to find new people at trading and scam them.  Honestly I would delete this post and make a new account asking for advice, and then when you feel ready post on this account in Dota2trade to sell.   There are a TON of links you NEED to read on dota2trade, they are on the right side in the sidebar, READ ALL OF THEM AND DO NOT SKIM.  When making the post on Dota2trade tell them you are new, and the mods or other traders will often give you links/information you need.  Some people will probably PM you asking to buy right away, DO NOT DO THIS, they are most likely scammers!  To be clear here, I have never done real $$ trading, but what I have heard is that Paypal is very easy to scam with, the buyer can always chargeback and Paypal always supports them regardless.  I believe bankwire is the safest method, but has fees added on, again I am not 100% sure, but what I have heard."

dota2loungebets,32t6pl,noxx123456,1 point,Thu Apr 16 22:52:42 2015 UTC,"Well the economy crashed down a while before the release of GTA. The key prices for expensive items have been dropping ever since Valve added the change that the keys you buy ingame are untradeable for a week due to credit card fraud. Key price went up drastically as well as the demand. After some time, it might settle down, who knows. The change that allowed tradeups for stattrak items mainly hurt the value of the rare skins, for example the usp-s Orion stat fn was over 200 euros on the market before the change, right after it dropped down to 80.  There are a few other top tier skins that will be hurt by that change."

dota2loungebets,32sj7w,Stan_W,2,Thu Apr 16 10:57:00 2015 UTC,2% is huge bro. Take this match for example: 20.000 items placed. Sum of top 10 bets alone is 2661.96  The same match on D2L has 131.000 items placed.  10 games a day.  You tell me how much they profit

dota2loungebets,32sj7w,calmbeep,2,Thu Apr 16 12:10:17 2015 UTC,plus D2L likes to give low value items(eg: 0.03 x N) keep the big themselves
dota2loungebets,32sj7w,Supplycrate,1 point,Thu Apr 16 14:54:53 2015 UTC,"Yeah 2% is massive when you consider the number of items bet and the number of games played per day, plus their overheads must be pretty low since they only need a few admins plus trade bots and server costs.   I am somewhat curious how they go about liquidating them though, I mean it must be quite troublesome to convert such a staggering number of items into actual cash money."
dota2loungebets,32sj7w,fgiveme,1 point,Thu Apr 16 12:59:06 2015 UTC,Maybe D2L sell at 40-50% market price? Then some big traders buy stuffs from them in bulk and resell at 60%.

If you are gonna bet 5-10 bets a day then buy smaller items with that 150 if you are going to bet only on confident matches buy 2 items and progress in adding more slots until u hit 4-6 from your winnings adn after that make a 2nd bet in reserve in case you lose it somehow. then either make extra account or start cashing out moneyyyy. Remember not to get greedy when u get rich as thats the trap i fell a good few times. Also the 2 items method is for experienced bettors as I had betted for almsot 2 years and I could say I do a decent thing out of it but if you were betting less than a year then you dont have the knowledge to know all situations which are still ahead of u. If you lost adn feelign salty/rage which u are then skip the rest of the bets for the day and never think ""If god wants me to stay in betting he will let me win"" etc. wise betting = most profitable betting anyhow you bet from $1x100 to 1x$100 items."

Plus u are not allowed to call a team noob when they were playing under ddos and with 3 standins.  I am not saying that for sure people betting in D2L are doing those DDOS but this possibility will forever exist until proven otherwise!
dota2loungebets,32mgol,ledzepp1109,5,Tue Apr 14 23:38:41 2015 UTC,"first of all brax wasnt ddos'ed. if someone has a shitty internet thats his fault. they usually have a 15min rule or something and otherwise they dont have to wait. its not like the tournament organizers are spnsoring the betting either. its done by 3rd party like dota lounge and stuff, so in conclusion ure just being salty as fuck. get rekt."

dota2loungebets,32mgol,Supplycrate,1 point,Wed Apr 15 11:52:12 2015 UTC,"There's objectively no reason a gambling medium shouldn't be as fair as possible. External factors aren't actually counted in any other game that I can think of, or at the very least, they aren't common enough to warrant any drastic changes. In Dota these issues are essentially omnipresent, and the community has to therefore adjust itself accordingly. There need to be new rules implemented in the scene to mitigate the devastating impact some of these external factors are having, otherwise whatever entity doesn't adjust will never be able to compete with their more serious (physical game) counterparts.   We're not talking football here, this is a whole new frontier of betting, and it needs its own rules."
dota2loungebets,32mgol,LTDN00,1 point,Wed Apr 15 00:17:41 2015 UTC,"Because ""external factors"" are impossible to remove and it would result in D2L admins having to make judgement calls on what is significant enough to justify closing the bet. For example VG losing to whichever no name team it was because iceiceice was sick and had to go to the hospital, that's an external factor that couldn't be predicted.  As was pointed out by Demon on twitter it wasn't even a DDOS, so you're saying any unforeseen circumstance at all should result in the bet being closed. What if a player is getting constant lag spikes but can still stay connected? What if their grandma falls down the stairs and they have to leave the game to take her to the hospital? It's neverending.   Think about it from D2L's perspective, they have to be consistent and making subjective calls would generate far more rage and unfairness. Their rules are clearly stated, if you can't accept them then don't bet."
dota2loungebets,32mgol,Bizarro-aka-WhOaMi,0,Wed Apr 15 00:16:01 2015 UTC,"Well, if the information is out prior to the beginning of the match (which I believe it was), there's no problem. Then it's within peoples capabilities to make an analytical decision regarding their investment. I think these ""judgement calls"" can be outlined pretty simply with a few basic guidelines, one of which would be that external factors influencing the game past the games start nullify the game entirely.   In circumstances you stated, the match should not count betting wise. There's no reason they should. It's better to have stability and fairness, than to have whatever they have now.   It doesn't have to be subjective. And yes, their rules are stated, and I'm saying they can be modified to improve the site. I will continue betting through them since they run a monopoly on the dota betting scene, and so I, as well as others here, have a vested interest in at least trying to promote a balanced system."

The manner in which they handle these external circumstances aren't conducive to running a proper betting site.

dota2loungebets,32izv3,Ice_Cream_Warrior,1 point,Tue Apr 14 04:29:05 2015 UTC,"I've been betting on and off since the end of December, and while I'm not aveteran, here are some seemingly common/obvious stuff that most people ignore/tend to forget, even though a couple of these were already covered in /u/aVENGEANCE_'s post :   Don't bet what you aren't prepared to lose Don't bet to chase your losses, and instead think of each day as a new slate Do your own research and don't blindly follow predictions Accept the fact that dota has a high chance for upsets despite any kind of research that you do, and logic doesn't really apply(example Team A stomps Team B, and Team B stomps Team C. It doesn't follow that Team C gets stomped by Team A) I personally check joindota, gosugamers, and sometimes dotabuff before betting. It helps being able to check if players/a team has been practicing or if they have been inactive recently. Occasionally check social media, moreso for teams that are prone to having unstable rosters(ex. PR, Navi) Asian doto(china/sea) is unpredictable, and specifically chinese doto is 50% drafts When betting for/against CIS teams, always consider the DDOS factor (I wish this wasn't an issue but it can't be avoided) Finally, the biggest salt generator I've noticed is that people tend to bet their houses/go all in on ""safe matches."" I've learned it the hard way, and it wasn't fun. I've seen someone give this advice and it's really true: Never go all-in. Once you do it, you're bound to do it again. If you win once on an all-in, the high is so good and you might feel inclined to do it again. The problem is once you lose, you'll feel like shit.   When starting out:   It's always best to split what you have rather than betting one huge item. Say you have $20, it's better to buy alot of $2-3 bettables rather than one arcana. It allows you more freedom to bet on more matches, and it allows leeway for losses Bet on matches with good odds. Usually, 90-10 odds and betting on the 90% isn't usually worth it. If you have a couple of trash/extra items, betting them on the underdogs are good(nothing to lose, everything to gain). 60-40s and 70-30s are pretty ok. Above that, reconsider. Bet on the underdogs only if you think they have a good chance of winning. Don't be swayed by people who YOLO bet. It's your money and only you lose if you follow them blindly Barring all research, follow your gut feel. Sometimes the only thing you can trust is yourself"

dota2loungebets,32izv3,tiocuca,1 point,Tue Apr 14 12:23:23 2015 UTC,"Hello.I just found this site by accident last January.  I am a student from Singapore,and I started betting on d2l just when TI3 wrapped up.I remember that I started with 4 keys I bought with from a friend back then.There was this Alliance vs Speed Gaming match,wherein Alliance is at 85% and Speed at 15%.Being a Singsing fan put a lot of confidence on me to throw all 4 keys on them,and voila.Speed upsets Alliance.What these 4 keys had become,was a steady flow of extra money for an ordinary student.A date every end of the month :P.    For the past 2 years,here's what I have been doing:  .Check for information regarding the teams,if they have a Facebook page like it for updates,follow their Twitter too if they will play with standins.  .Search the internet for places like this one in Reddit,where discussions can help you make your decisions.Also,try discussing it with friends,listening to others opinion can really help a lot.Also puts some confidence in you.  .After compiling these information,do your own conclusion.Try to stay neutral in boths teams side,that way you can see each's strength and weaknesses.  .Sometimes there are matches with unexpected odds,mostly these are 50-50% games but the end result is clear as water for you to determine.(Can only be applied on Sea and EU doto,where fanboys deeply love the team and risk everything).These one is a good match to bet on,as it is 1:1.  .Dota is a game,which means anything can happen.Mostly odds for matches are 80-20,which is either too skewed or both teams really deserve those odds.This,is the most vital step.Check for information regarding the team with lower %,and use these to come up with a conclusion if they can pull an upset.If you see and feel they can,then go for it.  .Evironment is also a factor here.This one's gonna turn out funny tho.Stay updated for things like:.  .tomorrow would be a pro players birthday  .something bad happened to the team  .they had a week of bootcamp  .There will be blood moon tonight.Remember that LondonC vs Empire game,9gag  gave me confidence to double bet 6x key on LC just because a player named Madara is on that team.  .If possible,choose matches with better odds to bet on.There is always another day.    Here is a breakdown on the risks on all doto regions:  .CIS-midgame doto where ddos is a great factor in affecting the games.Odds for matches here mostly go for 60-40.The teams are closely matched to each other,yet sometimes the outcome of the match is clear(even tho it is still 9hrs from now).There is always the dark horse team(namely Pr,M5 and Burden).Upset happens once in a red moon.  .Chinese dota-aggressive early or farm 3hrs.This one is more risky to place your items on,especially as of now that the draft has a high impact on the game's outcome.Throw rarely happens,as Chinese players play here for pride.They are after all,China's rockstars.Upsets happen mostly in bo1 games,as China currently has the most talented player pool.  .NA doto-most risky bet to place you houses on,even on teams like EG.Most teams happen to perform well in day1,then underperform on day2.Upsets are more likely to happen here,though except for EG games odds are likely 70-30.Betting small on the underdog proves to be worth it.  .Sea doto-a.k.a throw dota.Odds are mostly skewed to fair,upsets occur sometimes.Aside from the Arrow Gaming scandal,the outcome for most games here are predictable.Refering to teams previous encounters can help here(only here in Sea dota),because there is always that teams kryptonite.    That said,the rest lies on you,the better himself,as in the end of the day you will be the one doing those decisions.Wearing some confidence and ignoring your fear is good for your heart.:3.  Good luck and stay happy.:3."
dota2loungebets,32izv3,tiocuca,1 point,Tue Apr 14 12:52:03 2015 UTC,"I'm still a total noob, but seemed to be picking this up alright. One thing that I don't see here, is much more about learning how to balance your bankroll and make reasonable sized bets, and what sort of growth and return you should expect. I started with under $1 and am about at $10 in profit, but I've been having issues where even if I'm winning more than losing (55% so far) I repeatedly have days where I'm losing bankroll overall as I'm making bets I don't need to, for too much. Not even on bad odds, but yesterday for example I went like 7-4 and picked like 4 underdogs but I still lost about 30% as I would just keep betting sizeably on LGD/iG games incorrectly when they are coin-flips, and not trusting myself to put down some decent coin on an underdog or two I had researched out and been confident on. Earlier my winnings graph was much more dramatic, and up and down all over the place (gone to -$4, up to 15) but I've been trying to improve that, and recently it seems more of shorter jumps at least as I'm realizing if I have $10, making $2 in a day is a solid play, and I don't need to try and make $7. I'm obviously doing it for fun, as it increases enjoy-ability in the esports scene and I like numbers and stats and all that, I don't need to go out and try and make $100 in a month, I'm not going to be a full time trader or anything."
dota2loungebets,32izv3,justin0102,2,Tue Apr 14 09:25:36 2015 UTC,"the amounts youre winning may be very miniscule, but if you consider that you're making 20% of your bankroll in one day, it is very significant. keep up the good work."
dota2loungebets,32i1p6,CreationPenguin,2,Mon Apr 13 23:30:26 2015 UTC,"With lower bets you'd want to bet on matches with 60/40 odds, or bet trash items on really skewed odds, especially chinese dota bo1, which has a huge chance for upsets. betting on matches with more than 70/30 odds it's not worth betting on the favourite with such a low item pool.  It's definitively doable, after I lost some big bets I had around 1 dollar in items, 1 month later and many smart bets I'm 26 dollars positive. Predictions on these threads are often on point, but do your own research."
dota2loungebets,32i1p6,ragincookie,2,Mon Apr 13 23:49:16 2015 UTC,"I'm still pretty small time and haven't been betting that long, but I'm steadily working my bankroll larger and larger. My advice for getting over ""the fear"" is to calculate exactly how much you're working with by adding up the value of all the items you have, excluding those you actually use in game and would be sad to lose (if it's very low maybe buy up $10-20 of $1-2 items to supplement). Then set levels for small, medium and large bets, maybe 2%/5%/10%. Doing it systematically like that will give you more confidence in your bets and will let you work your way up gradually. Also if you can say to yourself ""hey, I only put $10 into this, that's less than going to the movies"" it's much easier to justify taking risks and make your peace with losses.  Also I'd recommend looking into VPGame over D2L, payouts there tend to be fewer items of higher value. So if you bet 4 25c items for a 2.0 value payout, you'll probably get a single $2 item in return instead of the two 70c items and four other trash items D2L would deliver. This makes it much easier to increase the size of your bets over time. However one downside is you can only bet 4 items instead of D2L's 6, which can be a little problematic when using really low value items, so a mixture of the two is probably the best policy."
dota2loungebets,32i1p6,Supplycrate,2,Tue Apr 14 00:04:19 2015 UTC,you can actually bet 16 items on VP game. you can bet 4x on a team. 4x4=16

dota2loungebets,324nvr,ic3mango,1 point,Sat Apr 11 15:40:52 2015 UTC,"Sorry if this has already been debated, I haven't found anything about it in this subreddit.  There are some bets for both PR and Alliance that look very suspicious. They are all 3 keys worth and have been made by accounts with very similar, probably improvised names (at least fgiveme, fgiveme1vns, loungesohai, loungesomot, aflame1vns). Considering a couple of those names, they could be related to D2L or not.  Is this someone trying to abuse the system? Is this part of the D2L bet system? Is this supposed to balance the maybe underused key betting system? I don't want to panic and start yelling D2L is trying to fix percentages without any proof or reason, I just want to know if someone knows anything about it.  EDIT: Minor typos. The streaming screen is not related to the game, it is Alliance vs PR, you can check it out live right now if you want.  EDIT 2: So far I've found some of those accounts and they seem to be perfectly fine. Technically, if someone is in charge of all those accounts and he wants to do those bets, it's perfectly fine and legal, so forget my words. I'm leaving this here anyway in case anyone has further information.   http://steamcommunity.com/id/fgiveme (seems like a main account) http://steamcommunity.com/id/fgiveme1vns http://steamcommunity.com/id/loungesohai http://steamcommunity.com/id/loungesomot"

You check which one you think its the most logical or safest (well idk can i say safest, for me theres no safest bet in world, but you know what i mean) bet for you and thats how you build yourself and your bankroll. Its important to understand at the start of betting that you MUST afford to lose and be clear in your mind after you lose, but hey thats betting, one day you win bugatti one day you loose it or not Kappa. You should sometimes just feel when some underdog CAN win a game and place some trash items on them - for example this two games iG vs HGT and Alliance vs HR. Im not some extra pro level bettor but i learn from my mistakes and one of them is NEVER GO ALL IN. GL with betting"

dota2loungebets,321uj3,Robbingrogue,3,Thu Apr 9 22:14:20 2015 UTC,"There's usually a handicap on a highly favored team.   So for example, there's a BO3 match which is Alliance vs 4Anchors, odds are 85/15 on D2L and on VPGame Alliance has a -1.5 handicap if you place a bet onto them and the odds are 1.4. What that means is if I were to place a bet on Alliance with that handicap, Alliance would have to win 2-0 in map score for me to win. So after a match, do -1.5 to your teams' map score and if it's LESS than the opponents, you lost; vice-versa. I know that lots of sportsbooks also do the complete opposite for the underdog (not sure about VPGAME), so any team can have +1.5 and you would have to take that in consideration if you bet on them as well."

dota2loungebets,31wemq,dreamer002418,4,Thu Apr 9 14:33:42 2015 UTC,"D2L is better for the domino effect regarding skewed odds, ex: C9 defeats empire while odds are even, if c9 plays another team later they'll get favorite odds which makes it easier to fade or w/e.  D2L is also better for odds predictability, on vpg I've seen more than 0.2 fluctuation with <10min remaining.  VPG has asian handicap betting which is the shit, I used that site only for that reason alone. Bo2's on d2l are a waste of time because of the lack of handicap betting, betting on bo2 dogs is extremely difficult  VPG has better game diversity, more games from smaller leagues. You can also bet on who will win game #1 + first to 10 kills; as a degen, that shit is crazy.  D2l's majority of users are a bunch of sheep that just follow the trend, they go always for the favorites and the most profitable way to win is to fade a winning team with a streak of 5+ games, while VPG has much more balanced odds.  I've used them all, really liked D2l for underdog bets, you'll never get better odds anywhere else but went with VPG for the asian handicap. In the end got really pissed on VPG because i never knew on what actually odds my bet will remain and cashed the fuck out and went with a legit cash only site. I suggest if you can you do the same. Money is money, you can get lost with virtual money + you know what you get, you'll never get flooded with crimson guards again."

Compared to on D2L where I have around $10 on, but lots of that is in items worth less then 20 cents.
