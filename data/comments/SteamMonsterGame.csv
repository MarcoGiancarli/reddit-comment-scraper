SteamMonsterGame,3bpcvb,Xhell96,3,Wed Jul 1 02:00:06 2015 UTC,"First the point about SMG: The game by itself was barely worth playing, it's all the community events around that made it awesome.   Yes, yes, yes. It was great while it lasted but I really don't see the appeal in continuing it anymore. Wait for scripters to continue refining the optimal strategies and idle harder to make bigger numbers? We already ""solved"" the game, so to speak, and now there's so little interaction that you just install a script and show up at the right time.  I pretty much had the exact same idea with you once the minigame was over. It did a fantastic job of showing the power of a multiplayer incremental game, but I wanted something that could be really fun to actively participate in while still keeping all the idling things there so people could still feel like they're helping even when they're not actively playing.  I've basically drowned myself in JS (and Coffee, both in node and on the browser) the past few years so I'm extremely comfortable with that stuff. It's just a matter of putting together interesting game mechanics, getting a server, and probably some pretty graphics to go along with it.  Anyway, I'm totally down for this if we can figure out how to make the game work well."

I'll sort out some hosting for the full version tomorrow. I also have a list of where everyone is...  Update: full size PNG is here - warning it's 71MB: https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B2am7h6Tso0TfmFkRXBXV0FkcmluM3J0QzBZbHk0LVU1S24yMmYwOU9GTzExTjJIeHVJcGM&usp=sharing  I will also upload the PNG/SVG/PDF files of the word and nick clouds. Those are a lot smaller.  Update 2: Tool to find players in the image: http://al.robotfuzz.com/~al/goldhelm/  Update 3: The process used:   Get list of winners from hall of fame. Resolve vanity URLs into SteamIDs with Steam API. Get avatar URL for each SteamID using Steam API. Fetch all avatars using wget. Make a 480x270 PNG with the desired colours in the final image. Make a 240x135 PNG black/white mask indicating important colours (ie Gold Helm). Scale the colour map to 7680x4320 and cut it into 32x32 tiles. For each source tile compute the squared difference between it and each avatar tile. (This step took 4 hours and produced 48GB of data.) Sort the difference lists least->most. Open the mask image and sort the pixels into two groups: important, not important. Randomize the pixel order within each of the two subgroups. For each important pixel, pick the best matching avatar tile (ie the first one in the list) which has not already been used twice, as long as the number of remaining pixels is greater than the number of unused tiles. For each unimportant pixel pick the best matching avatar that has not yet been used. If running out of unused avatars, clear the list of used avatars. Construct the final image based on the chosen mapping."

I got in the boat late but met a lot of nice people, got excited and was even able to help a little bit.  Of course not everything was flowers and happiness, I felt so powerless being at steamga.me's irc on the last day, monitoring the rooms, and people would come by asking for help for rooms that just couldn't make it to the 100m.  Anyways I had higher hopes that the community would stay alive, but it seems like most people were there only for the badge :)"
SteamMonsterGame,3avluk,grindbr,1 point,Wed Jun 24 09:33:55 2015 UTC,":) <3 thanks for sharing this it makes me happy to see anytime someone finds a community of people helping others. (i may or may not have been the one you saw trying to get people to 1mil, unfortunately my success was limited due to having started so late, and being dragged down by my health issues... but, was pretty cool to watch people join in after my script would start dumping massive amounts of WHs and i did see folks join in a bit in rooms that had otherwise been very inactive... and at least imagined that they were happy to have suddenly gotten help and gotten level upon level after an entire day of gaining little.)  i will try to TL;DR: here... but basically i wanted to say this; i think we form a community that never goes away but isn't ever necessarily completely organized. we all may share some goals though i think sometimes we are completely at odds on other things.   my idea is that of a 'butterflies effect'... its the butterfly effect [~ that a small change early in the progression of a complex system can make enormous changes to the outcome of the system] applied to a lot of people, aiming for changes for the better... that many of us, making many small changes towards what we consider to be better; brightening peoples lives, bringing what we believe to be important into the world... can change it. and i believe we do, every day, through loving others; love as an action. my channel,   so, keep looking for it. there's somewhere out there, every day that you can make a difference, bring some love to someone that needs it. a group of people that you can change the world with. i advise always remember that the eventual outcome is up to factors beyond your control and that you just need to focus on doing things the right way for the right reasons; and let the rest flow from that. but above all, know that you are very much loved! and thank you and i hope that you can find another group that helps you find what you are looking for, because i know the feeling well, and i bet most every one of us that participates in something like this for similar reasons ends up feeling at least a bit emptied out after it's over, in proportion to how much of themselves they invested to begin with. i know i do. :) but, that's not necessarily a bad thing.   <3 love you! and love to you all! lísa (chelle)"

You phrased a sentiment many of us are having quite well, but fear not: the community doesn't end now.  We're now getting together to work on an even more important and more challenging project: saving lives by donating blood.  Expect the full announcement with a a partial list of prizes and the method of entering tomorrow.  Additionally, some of us are sharing hugs  -Harmless Orchid"
SteamMonsterGame,3aukfd,DebentureThyme,17,Tue Jun 23 17:02:21 2015 UTC,"Based on the drx hall of fame data yesterday, (which was marked as missing 200-300 people from 2 rooms) there was 1 person who would have the badge 6 times, and 15 who would have it 5.  (38443 total users hit 100m, 32433 unique users hit 100m)"
SteamMonsterGame,3aukfd,nobody65535,8,Tue Jun 23 18:37:11 2015 UTC,"I'd have it 5 times if I was actually joining MSG rooms instead of working on the project or helping users.  Since we were the ones decide the numbers.  I actually chose room 47051, but wasn't in it.  They were just figuring out the numbers on TS before announcing it,  and I noticed they kept itterating it exactly on the 10's and piped in to say ""No, next is 47051.  Stop putting out numbers that are easy to guess."""
SteamMonsterGame,3aukfd,Spankmeister88,2,Tue Jun 23 18:57:16 2015 UTC,"Also I should add that drx (who was MSG staff as well) was manually adding in the numbers because we were tracking way more room stats than other trackers, and couldn't get it all from the API as frequently for that much data.  He made a tool for us admins to enter rooms in to his server when he wasn't there (but I'm pretty sure I'm the only one who remembered this fact, as I was usually the only on very active when he was asleep).  I was asked to enter in the YOWH group that first hit 100m but since we only could grab the live data for rooms and I was asked AFTER they had hit 100m, the result was after many left their room.  Oh and we were never asked to enter in the cool people or whatever group that hit 100M.  Or something.  IDK, I passed out for four hours finally about a quarter of the way into the final day.  So there's 1500 missed. Drx said he is working on updating the hall of fame, so we'll see if we can get the data.  Probably would need players from that room to confirm their presence and only if the 100M badge was their first (so the timestamp on it would be verifiable)."

Was in the second room to make 100M and 4 after that point, I was in several others trying to get more folks to the 100M mark, but we fell short....  Just glad I got to help so many others get that WH badge!"

SteamMonsterGame,3at7dc,DebentureThyme,2,Tue Jun 23 09:02:03 2015 UTC,What about the leftovers from installing the scripts manually through the console? How to remove them?
SteamMonsterGame,3at7dc,tzetinjiu,3,Tue Jun 23 15:24:28 2015 UTC,"First head over to http://steamcommunity.com/minigame/  and open up your console.  To see the stored settings, type:   localStorage   You'll see something like:     Storage { steamdb-minigame-wormholers/removeCritText: ""true"", steamdb-minigame-wormholers/alertShown: ""true"", minigame_mutemusic: ""true"", steamdb-minigame-wormholers/removeAllText: ""true"", minigame_mute: ""true"", length: 5 }     To clear those settings, type:   localStorage.clear()"
SteamMonsterGame,3at7dc,Nrvnqsr,2,Tue Jun 23 21:25:45 2015 UTC,There are none.  Code put in the console didn't store anything.  It clears out when you closed that tab or refreshed it.
SteamMonsterGame,3at7dc,tzetinjiu,1 point,Tue Jun 23 16:10:50 2015 UTC,"But after refresh it ""remembers"" the options i selected at the bottom like throttling client, praise gold helm and remove all text"
SteamMonsterGame,3at7dc,wchill,2,Tue Jun 23 16:17:57 2015 UTC,"I'll look through the code.  Probably just cached settings or something.  I was basically learning JavaScript on the go, so that isn't really my area of expertise (hence I also didn't code anything to do locally stored data)."
SteamMonsterGame,3at7dc,VitulusAureus,1 point,Tue Jun 23 16:30:11 2015 UTC,In console you can type localStorage.clear() - though this will clear other data Steam has put there.  Alternatively search in your browser's local storage and remove the appropriate keys.
SteamMonsterGame,3at7dc,aidotato5,3,Tue Jun 23 21:26:05 2015 UTC,"This also removes all other scripts you may have installed. On Firefox, instead of going to the ""Extensions"" tab, go to ""User Scripts"", where you can browse Greasemonkey scripts and remove those you won't use."

SteamMonsterGame,3arwc6,scsina,4,Tue Jun 23 01:09:19 2015 UTC,"Here. As for the anime girl, she shows up (similar to gold helm gabe in wchill's script) if, when using the YOWH script, you activate the ""Honk Honk?"" setting checkbox. She's usually quiet, but when you hit a x00 room, she starts shaking and HONKING with a horn, while ""HONKING INTENSIFIES"" flies across the screen.  By the way, one of the memes started during the Panzer room I explained in the above link, was how the ""Honk Honk?"" checkbox makes Gold Helm live longer if activated. People kept telling others to activate it in the IRC chat if they wanted to fight the trolls, to reach 100M."
SteamMonsterGame,3arwc6,LordGravewish,5,Tue Jun 23 04:22:56 2015 UTC,"Actually, it's not an anime. Chen is from a series of shooting games called Touhou. I was so hyped when I saw someone added her in the script.  The honk honk meme is from some touhou fancomic, I think."
SteamMonsterGame,3arwc6,DeRockProject,3,Tue Jun 23 04:57:05 2015 UTC,"I used ""anime"" as a kind of adjective to describe the ""art style"". I did know she was from Touhou, as it had sort of come up in YOWH chat, though I didn't know much more detail."

None of the ones I joined got higher than 52m until the last day where I was in room 992 which maxed at 75m. No 100m for me =(
