tldr,3cby8d,lntrinsic,5,Mon Jul 6 18:47:39 2015 UTC,"Gluten-free food is for Coeliacs/Gluten Intolerant people.  It generally contains more fat, more salt or more sugar than equal non-gluten products and costs a minimum of twice the price, in the case of white bread, six times as much.  Generally as well, gluten-free products taste worse than the gluten containing products they seek to replace.  Gluten is probably most useful in modern catering for it's elasticity - take the bendiness out and you end up with flavoured cardboard.  Who on earth would deliberately choose a diet that cost much more and tasted much worse unless they had to, because gluten had burnt off the scillia in their stomach and they could no longer digest it?  Science says? Fuck me more salt, more fat, more sugar? I would tell you that the diet is less healthy, it doesn't take a rocket scientist to work out that most of the processed products are much worse than their 'glutened' counterparts. How could that possibly be healthy.  Count that out and get a diet down to meat, fruit and veg and any sauce made with corn flour rather than wheat flour - I believe it's known as Corn Starch in the US - and you have a normal diet - generally.  Cakes, biscuits and breads are just something to avoid or get a gluten-free alternative. Everything else, if made at home, or if bought, the labels have to be checked because food manufacturers use wheat flour as the lowest cost food additive to make anything thicker or crunchier.  It would've been better to spend the money researching this on finding ways to make gluten alternatives cheaper!"

Intentional brownouts are used for load reduction in an emergency.  The reduction lasts for minutes or hours, as opposed to short-term voltage sag (or dip). The term brownout comes from the dimming experienced by lighting when the voltage sags. A voltage reduction may be an effect of disruption of an electrical grid, or may occasionally be imposed in an effort to reduce load and prevent a power outage, known as a blackout.

What I'm seeing is people who are fed up with companies that blatantly rip off consumers with $1000 HDMI or Ethernet cables. It seems now everyone's jumping on Sony for apparently claiming that their storage device sounds better, when everyone knows ""a bit is a bit"".   Now, the claimed benefit of these expensive Sony SD cards apparently has to do with minimizing the possibility of electromagnetic interference when used in a portable, analog-to-digital recording device. Apparently some cheap cards can produce an unwanted noise when used in some of these direct-to-SD recorders. These expensive cards then would be a sort of extra insurance policy for pros that want to avoid tainted recordings even if it costs a little extra.  Is Sony making false claims and overcharging people? Possibly. Are they as bad as companies that sell über-expensive 'audiophile' HDMI cables? Possibly not."

tldr,280jfj,Asynonymous,2,Fri Jun 13 06:59:20 2014 UTC,"They are not. They can earn under some programms, but by default they don't. But the prison wards are paid. And the facility have to be build and maintained. The prisoners have to be fed and clothed.   So society pays for the fact, that they stay out of it, whereas young and clever minds have to pay to be able to help the society better so everyone can profit from it."
tldr,280jfj,Beredo,1 point,Fri Jun 13 10:28:26 2014 UTC,Prisoners are charged boarding and food (though the charged amount probably isn't as much as the amount taxpayers pay). When they come out if they haven't been working while in there they'll have debt. At least that's my understanding of it.

It was glorious - cut a couple of slices of rosemary bread, toasted them for a couple of minutes whilst listening to The Walker by Fritz and the Tantrum. When they popped, tossed on some mayo and shredded chicken as I listened to Muse absolutely shredding it up with Knights of Cydonia. Applied American cheese liberally - it might not be the greatest cheese ever, but I reserve my right as an American to relive my glorious youth of grilled cheese and a yellow plate of processed food. I send this whole operation into the microwave with I'm proud to be an American by Lee Greenwood. After a few patriotic minutes, I pulled that sandwich out quicker than soldiers in Vietnam and took it upstairs. My gorgeous girlfriend was studying for finals, you see, and this glorious sandwich was for her. It needed the proper entrance, so I blasted All My Loving by the Beatles.   Then we had sex. Because gender equality is what women loves.   That's right gents, when YOU make a sandwich for her, you get sex. It's unexpected and will get her right in the feels.

tldr,1zlfpx,sodypop,8,Wed Mar 5 03:39:10 2014 UTC,"Some feedback so far:   I feel like I get more content on sodypop days But I also like how latebris will post multiple posts from one sub - I don't know if you've been limiting yourself to one or if it's just coincidence I like how you have the 'New subreddits created today' at the end of your posts. I don't really want to subscribe to /r/newreddits just to find newly-made subs but for some reason I like them in these /r/tldr posts.   I like the general style of curated content like this; do you know of any other subreddits with this model? I'd be interested in someone/something that combs through /r/news, /r/worldnews, /r/politics, /r/technology, /r/science, etc. and delivers the big news stories with the goal of being neutral - perhaps with an updated storyline for ongoing events (like the Ukraine business). I guess I could probably just start using Google News or something for this."
tldr,1zlfpx,syzo_,3,Wed Mar 5 07:23:00 2014 UTC,"Thanks for the feedback! I would love to get more submissions from other users so that it's not solely dependent on us mods to find the links for the day. I generally post fewer links because I generally have less time throughout the day to check for the best posts. I'm working on it!  Regarding the other subreddits you mentioned, I try to include those when there are big posts in the day. We also absolutely try to be neutral and avoid linking to dramatic posts (which pretty much eliminates /r/politics most of the time!)."
tldr,1zlfpx,syzo_,3,Wed Mar 5 22:17:43 2014 UTC,"I should note that that was a very nitpicky post - I love that this sub is active again and I think you guys are doing a good job so far :) I also know how ot feels to be busy and I think overall that user-submitted links, curated by the mods, is a good model for this sub.  As for the the second half of my previous post - I meant that I think there should be such a subreddit focused on that sort of thing, the biggest addition would be the ""story so far"" idea - for example, the ukraine story could have an overall summary of the big events and maybe a little background on the different sides, and then the new news links could follow. I don't expect you guys here at /r/tldr to do that, though. Basically just wondering if thereare any other subreddits with this ""curated"" model of content posting.  Keep up the good work!"
tldr,1zlfpx,Herecomethedrums,2,Wed Mar 5 23:20:33 2014 UTC,"Nitpicky is fine, it'll help us learn how to manage this better, faster.  I am not aware of another subreddit that does that, currently. If it is created, we can probably feature it!"

Gabe Newell makes a post on /r/IAmA saying he will answer questions at 1:00 PST.   At the time of posting, That was 3 1/2 hours away, which is against the rules of /r/iama, stating a maximum of 30 minutes is allowed before you start answering questions.   The mods delete the thread and nuke everything: http://np.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zg3b8/gabe_newell_ama_100_pm_pst/    Shortly after, the mods of /r/IAmA make a post regarding Gabe and his AMA:  > Hey everyone: just wanted to give you an update on the status of Gabe Newell's AMA. Earlier this morning, he posted an announcement saying that he was planning to host an AMA later this afternoon (4 pm EST, 1 pm PST). The moderators responded with information about how to submit his AMA when the time comes, which we normally do with announcement posts. The thread was then locked the thread (disallowed new coments) and removed all other comments so that this information would be the only thing visible, making it easier for him to find. Unfortunately, since then, no one has heard from Mr. Newell. We've been constantly monitoring his Reddit account, and the admins have reached out through their contacts at Valve. But unfortunately, after an hour of waiting, we have been unable to confirm anything. It is possible that he intended to answer on a different date (which does occassionally happen sometimes).

tldr,1noefl,Intellectualzombie,4,Sat Oct 26 05:07:59 2013 UTC,24k gallons/year per roundabout...   Roundabout.  Very nice.
tldr,1noefl,lux514,8,Thu Oct 3 23:18:10 2013 UTC,"Ummm. What is this with the begging for money?  If you need help, please just be honest about the circumstances.  The burden of redditing an hour or two a day is not going to do it for me."
tldr,1noefl,someguyfromcanada,5,Fri Oct 4 08:35:30 2013 UTC,I think he deserves a cookie. This subreddit is dope.
tldr,1noefl,boynumber1,4,Fri Oct 4 10:48:40 2013 UTC,"While I think this question is fair, I also want to ask: You haven't been coming here much have you?

tldr,1noefl,Buglet,10,Fri Oct 4 15:31:06 2013 UTC,That is more of a denigrating statement than a question but: I have read every post for at least a couple of years.  And the last 2 posts are the first that have asked for money I believe.  That is not a usual thing for a mod to do so I was curious about the circumstances and more than willing to help if need be.  If there is some other factor involved other than the burden of redditing then that would be something I would consider.  All of reddit is free for those that do not want to contribute but I understand running things costs time and money so I contribute time and money as I want to keep it going. Just need a reason to.
tldr,1noefl,someguyfromcanada,3,Fri Oct 4 19:12:51 2013 UTC,"Rereading my post I was not kind, thank you for pointing that out. I strive to be polite, so it's good when people pull me up, when I forget.  I hadn't thought of that, and while I agree about extenuating circumstances it's also a thing about reddit that bothers. We seem to, as a community, give too much to some who may need only a little help."

tldr,y9y4r,LoadInSubduedLight,1 point,Wed Aug 15 23:11:31 2012 UTC,"Dude. Who crapped in your coffee?  As another poster noted, the pictures of cute animals serve to act as a counterpoint for some of the darker content which appears here in many forms. It serves a genuine purpose, actually helping people struggling with depression and producing positive frames of mind.  I am no friend of karma whoring; were I to be ruler of Reddit this land would buckle beneath the force of my iron fist. And I would be very busy for very long before my attention ever turned to the whores of /aww. /r/aww is full of original content. It may lack depth, but at least it's people taking new pictures and sharing them. So much of this site is people reposting shit that's been here a million times before because they know it'll get upvoted, and THAT is the real problem with karma whoring; anything new must compete with thousands of tried-and-trued posts which are often upvoted by people who actually know they're reposts, but upvote them because they know they like that thing.  I suppose you didn't read the AMA by the guy who had to sort through child porn all day for the FBI (think it was the FBI); he said that /r/aww helped to keep him sane.  You think that /r/aww is what makes Reddit look bad. Really now. Not the rape apologists? Not the racists? Not the misogynists? The cute animals. They don't even use lolspeak captions. It's pics of cute animals. If they do nothing for you, you unsubscribe, and you don't click the links in the last section of /r/tldr, which as you failed to acknowledge, have been there all along.  I've been unsubscribed from /r/aww for most of the time since I created my account, but I recently resubscribed because I needed cheering up.  I don't know why I bothered to form such a comprehensive answer to someone too far gone to realise that the proper response to content one does not enjoy is to take the extremely minimal and effortless steps required to see that one does not consume said content."

Ten were up followed by two down, (then mostly up) it might show at +200/-50  Numbers don't mean shit after the first few. The scale is logarithmic.
