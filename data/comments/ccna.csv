ccna,3e5am3,PsychoMet,1 point,Wed Jul 22 02:52:26 2015 UTC,One of the switches is a 3550 so it requires encapsulation. The other is a 2960 and it doesn't. I don't think this is the issue because I have another 2960 attached to the same 3550 via an etherchannel and it's working perfectly.

ccna,3e2v1b,apejonk,13,Tue Jul 21 15:14:09 2015 UTC,207 is the broadcast address so not a valid host IP.
ccna,3e2v1b,Learn_Networking_102,4,Tue Jul 21 15:31:25 2015 UTC,"Oh wow, that was obvious - and still I didn't see it. Guess it's the heat. Thank you very much for the clarification!"
ccna,3e2v1b,Jammy_Git,2,Tue Jul 21 15:37:54 2015 UTC,Correct. Address range is 10.220.137.192 - 10.220.137.207 which makes .207 the broadcast.
ccna,3e2v1b,snorkel42,4,Tue Jul 21 15:34:52 2015 UTC,subnetting.net has the answer right.  10.220.137.201 255.255.255.240  255.255.255.240 has a block size of 16 (256-240=16).    10.220.137.201 is part of the 10.220.137.192/28 network.  If you add 16 to .192 you get .208 as the the next network's address.  Which means we are working with 10.220.137.192 - 10.220.137.207 and that .207 is the broadcast for 10.220.137.192/28.  So your valid hosts are 10.220.137.193 - 10.220.137.206

God, I hate frame relay. Feel free to ask any specific questions. If you plan on taking ICND 2 soon, you need to know STP cold. I swear there were 10+ questions on my test about it."
ccna,3e2i3q,Oderdigg,0,Tue Jul 21 21:43:47 2015 UTC,Anything in particular you're having issues with?  I know 802.1D is deprecated so no one uses basic STP. Everything today is 802.1W PVST+ or Rapid STP which has different/better states than STP.

The lammles book was a lot complicated,  I was having problem understanding rapid pvst+ can you explain it as simple as you can? I really appreciate it man..

STP will listen, learn, disable/block/forward. rSTP will learn, discard/forward  rSTP is faster because it has less states to go through to check for loops.  rpvst is just Rapid (Per VLAN) Spanning Tree as you can have different values for each VLAN. This way you can have VLAN10 flow differently from VLAN20. It's the most common for of rSTP."

Although this feature has been available on the Cisco 2600/3600 series since the release of Cisco IOS 12.1(5)T, support was previously limited to Fast Ethernet interfaces only. 802.1Q is not supported on any other Cisco 2600/3600 series 10BaseT Ethernet interface.   Edit 2: If you are anything less than 12.2, you are walking backwards.  If you are 12.2, you are shooting yourself in the foot.  Get to 12.4.  c2600-advipservicesk9-mz.124-15.T14.bin   <---- I'd be searching for something like this."

Proper cidr notation is up to 32 bits.  I'm guessing you mean 10.0.0.192/25, so 255.255.255.128? Correct me if I'm wrong.  So, just to clarify, everything 'internal' to the cisco network can ping everything else internal, but pinging into the cisco lan from your host outside it fails? This line is throwing me:   192.168.10.10 can ping one interface on each router and the interface times out   It sounds like you can ping into the switch from outside, but not from internal host to external host.  Is it possible your static route from your home network doesn't encompass the enterity of the 10.x.x.x subnets you have?  My best guess is that your default route doesn't cover all 10.x.x.x subnets in the cisco network, it covers the switch, but not the hosts? Just a guess.

You've indicated that you can ping an interface on each router and the interface times out.  Did you mean that you can ping at least one interface on a router but other interfaces time out?  You give an examples of addresses that should be on different routers/devices.  Did you mean that you can ping at least on device on each subnet but others time out?  Are you having similar trouble from the 10.0.0.150 host?  Can you provide output from all three routers for ""show ip interface brief"" and ""show ip route""?

Went from a PC Tech to a Network Administrator. Of course, I already had my 4 year degree and about 4 years of various IT experience under my belt when I finished my CCNA, but it did put the cherry on top of my resume for getting me hired at my current company. It also forced me to comprehend network topics to a degree that I would have never comprehended had it not been required for the exams.   -Will getting your CCNA land you a high paying network focused job? Probably not if thats all you have to your name. But its certainly possible, and I've seen people with less credentials pull it off.  -Will getting your CCNA teach you anything? Yes if you don't cheat. The CCNA is one of the toughest things I've ever done academically, and I learned a ton from achieving the certification.  -Is it worth it? Only you can answer this, because there is no ""right way"" to be successful in IT. I've seen people with no backgrounds in IT get hired for six figure network engineer positions, and I've seen people with tons of certs and experience who cant rise above the helpdesk. I've also seen others do it the perceived ""right way"" by getting a degree, getting experince, getting certs, and then getting the job they want. So like I said, the CCNA is just one way of doing it, but to answer your ultimate question: ""YES"" more than likely you will get hired somewhere for having it. Whether that somewhere is a helpdesk, or a NOC is a matter of destiny."

But they would NOT have interviewed me if I didn't have CCNA though.   I did get another--but not so great-- job 1 week later. My CCNA actually makes me ""overqualified"" for the job (on paper), but I got the job anyway. In this instance, my CCNA set me WAY above anyone else. The downside is that this job pays crap. But with that said, if I were your age, this would be a great job to start my career/life. Unfortunately for me, I'm much older and taking a pay cut to switch fields.

I'm eager to hear and discuss your company's offer for salary and benefits for this position.""  I would never give them your current salary, because A) Thats rude, and none of their business. B) What has one position's salary got to do with the next? (Especially if its an upgrade!) C) You are cheating yourself out of money, because they will try to low ball you and keep your new salary close to what you currently make.  On the flip side, its not a sin (but its risky) to tell them what you would like to make, but I would err on the high side (If you want 45k, ask for 65k), because you never know if you might get it. But, its ideal to let them throw out the first figure. You never know if they might have had a higher offer in mind!

ccna,3ds515,tartars,2,Sun Jul 19 13:51:06 2015 UTC,"It depends on your current salary - in general, I ask for 10% to my current salary if an employer asks me for my current salary requirements in salary negotiations.  I rarely list my current salary on job interviews, unless I know that company's HR department will flag my resume.  If your going to move jobs, it also means moving benefits, etc.  Unless your current working conditions are of the ""i need to gtfo"" type, then get a benefit for moving jobs.  I have been on both sides of the fence (hiring manager and employee) and I can tell you that your resume makes all the difference.  Tailor your resume to their job description + plus have some extras.  Don't use generic terms like ""setup network"" in your work history.  Tell them what you actually did.  Your resume should be geared to the technical person hiring you.  HR usually will bail out when you get too technical and ""defer"" to the hiring manager, which means the technical person gets to see your resume, leading to a possible interview.  The type of company paying you < 35k for a CCNA is probably not the type of company you want to work for in the first place, unless it's gov/public sector (which has it's benefits) or you have extreme circumstances in your work area.  Your degrading yourself tremendously - and degrading the benefits of having the CCNA.  A support desk role will be able to hit 35k very easily - a lot make much much more.

At ROUTE, I was grateful to have my old friend Wallace back, and while it was more readable, he's smarter than the three authors above combined. I somehow struggled through both the CCDA books and the just awful INE CCDA boot camp which definitely needed a second take. I've gone through some horrible writing, but then I got to SEC and realized I'd rather read about comparisons in IPV4 to IPv6 headers (Yawn).   The problem is that I know the sec track is probably really good to have. I prefer configuring things to being able to describe what an 'asset' is. These are exams questions, not really world questions. Should I be a CCNP because I can remember that uRPF has three modes (though I've only ever used two) or because I know how to configure them and what IOS' back logic is. I don't know. I don't like studying 'for the exam.' I like studying for the real world.   I wasted about 3-4 hours with CCP yesterday. I imagine no engineer actually utilized this POS, nor would want the net facing Java necessary to run it, through IE no less. Talk about vulnerability.

If there is some sort of position you can take up with your current employer or some other gov't agency that may be the ticket.  .gov tends to want Sec+ instead of CCNA since it's vendor neutral. Will the CCNA hurt? Not at all, but it won't be a listed requirement for many .gov jobs.   I would look into other positions you can move into and see what they would need and go for that."

Earlier this year I saw a Hansang Bae ""Wireshark"" video (he is a legend at the Wireshark conferences) and he blew me away how well he knew network analysis and tcp/ip inside and out. Now I am putting time into CCNA.  For you it really is a 65K question and theres factors involved such as your location, what employment opportunities are available in your region, do you expect to get a redundancy payout and are there others you know who can provide advice. Posting here in /r/ccna and other subreddits such as /r/redhat /r/sysadmin is a good move. If I had known about these subreddits five years ago I would have saved myself a lot of time and $K. Theres practical advice here and a few hundred bucks is all you will spend.  Start self study for CCNA if you can its a good grounding in the routing protocols and way better than N+. The Wendell Odom ""Cisco CCNA 200-120 Official Cert Guide LIbrary"" and your own R+S lab is recommended, Wendell is a elegant and crafted book writer the book is well thought out and presented. The Helpful Resources in the sidebar are excellent sites.   Keep in mind getting CCNA and learning it properly is the easy part.   The hard part is getting a job afterwards. Your location and the user demand for ICT services in your area is decisive in this. Recruitment firms can be diffcult to deal with for tier 1 entry level jobs.  Often Its a Catch 22 you need experience to get a job but can't get experience unless you have a job.   I know a guy certified and experienced he invested in his own business as a sole trader. He didn't earn 65K immediately but he got the right advice from a business mentor and has an accountant do an audit every few months. Now after one year he has a reliable client base. You may want to remain in electronics, switch to networking or provide both services in an all in one solution that is for you to decide.

ccna,3dqukq,akairyuryu,3,Sat Jul 18 16:00:33 2015 UTC,I went CCNA R&S > CCNA Sec and now working on CCNP. CCNA Sec is quite fun and builds on the R&S course and security is a hot topic at the moment!
ccna,3dqukq,MrRiddell,2,Sat Jul 18 16:41:19 2015 UTC,"From what I've heard CCNA Sec. is easy to get but isn't all that valuable. Honestly, the Sec+ would probably get you farther.   Since you already have a Masters in IT Security I'd be inclined to think you enjoy Security work? Maybe you should look at that route with other vendor certs."
ccna,3dqukq,Vontech615,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:39:24 2015 UTC,Any Sec would do fine for you. I find it odd that sec+ is more desirable. It's easier for sure. No config necessary. Just memorize. Yawn.   Take them both. They are similar enough. I understand it's 'vendor neutral' but Comptia is the the Vizio of certs. Let's be honest.  Either cert is dod rated though. Get them both. I know I plan to. It's just another $250 to test.
ccna,3dqukq,HighGainWiFiAntenna,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:34:43 2015 UTC,Good advise. Solid.
ccna,3dqukq,HighGainWiFiAntenna,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:33:37 2015 UTC,I definitely thing CCNP sec is valuable. It's 4 exams and only one of them is even out yet.

ccna,3dqukq,HighGainWiFiAntenna,2,Mon Jul 20 01:50:57 2015 UTC,Pretty obvious that you are on a security track. Probably should look into something like a CISSP or maybe go the ethical hacker path. You should start looking at whether or not you want to be on the pen testing side or the policy side of things. Each has their own distinctive paths of training and certifications.
ccna,3dqukq,travelling_anth,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:05:49 2015 UTC,"I find it odd people go from RS to sec then CCNP. I see it a lot, though I feel like other certs would have more weight, but somehow don't.   Whatever floats your boat. I skipped right over security. I can always go back. What's more valuable. Two ccna or one CCNP?  That's an easy call. Several ccna vs CCNP ? As long as they aren't design and sec.   To be honest, just in testing alone, the ccna doesn't ask you to configure anything (short of the ccna-x). You Better know your stuff and configuration for any CCNP exam."
ccna,3dr2wr,xpboy7,3,Sat Jul 18 17:15:29 2015 UTC,"No one else commented, so I guess I'll try. That's a pretty nice course right there. While MCSA and CCNA are different paths(systems vs network), it doesn't hurt to have exposure in each. Most network admin job description's I see, want experience on both sides. You're very young, so you have plenty of time to figure out what your specialization will be. Those qualifications you listed are more than enough to get an entry level job in the field. Shit, CCNA alone would get you that. All that in 6 months sounds very difficult, though. It took me 6 months just to get CCNA. That was working full time, however. If you can do it, then more power to you. Just make sure you get the certs and not just study the material to pass the classes. What's this course cost?"
ccna,3dr2wr,BroadStreet_Bully3,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:11:54 2015 UTC,"The course's cost is 4000$ which is quite nice here, what do you say about the Exchange? Does that count as MCSE?"
ccna,3dr2wr,BroadStreet_Bully3,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:26:31 2015 UTC,"No. From what I know about MCSE is that after you have your MCSA(3 certs), there about 2 additional certs that can take you to MCSE(5 certs total) level. Doing MCSE in 6 months would be insane, almost a cert per month, but I guess anything is possible.  Here is the Microsoft Cert path that you can check out, see if you can find exchange at the MCSE level. I did a small preliminary search and couldn't:  https://www.microsoft.com/learning/en-us/certification-overview.aspx  Start now and get ahead of the curve. I'm playing catch up at 32. That price is not bad, does it include the price of taking each cert test? Thinking about it again, if you can get all those certs in 6 months dude, you're the shit. You'll still be entry level with no work experience but you will be ahead of everyone else, and you'll be able to excel very fast."

ccna,3dp6d6,GolgothaAvante,4,Sat Jul 18 02:58:13 2015 UTC,Your ccent will give you a very good understanding of subnetting and General network characteristics.   The other half of the ccna will give you a broad overview of stp and your igp routing. So it's a good base. There are some Cisco specifics in there.   Is it a jump off point for a different cert?  I don't know. I'm always wary of people coming in with the Comptia trifecta + (patent pending on the name). I feel like I could score the trio in a month with minor effort.   You can't compare them. It's like saying you have a basket of fruit. Sure. If I pulled the oranges out (Comptia) id still have my apples and bananas (Cisco and Microsoft and juniper and brocade) but I could still have a bad ass fruit basket without oranges.

ccna,3dp6d6,DarthKane1978,2,Sat Jul 18 05:33:44 2015 UTC,"No I don't think it works like that.

But The CCNA won't prepare you for Security+ and having passed Network+ recently, I don't think it does a good job helping with that aside from the broader networking concepts. I took a security class in college that preps you for the Security + exam and I can tell you Security+ and CCNA are two completely different animals. It might help you with MCSA, but not CCNA.  My Network+ had a ton of wireless stuff and wireless is a very small blip in the CCNA NetAcademy courses. There were a few   I'm assuming you're going for the CCNA Route and Switch.

ccna,3dncwk,IArgueWithAtheists,4,Fri Jul 17 17:55:05 2015 UTC,"The only thing with IPv6 that often goes unnoticed is the need for a firewall. Many peoply rely on the IPv4 NATing as a firewall in itself, and when they enable IPv6, they are reachable directly on the internet.  If you go IPv6, make sure your firewall supports IPv6 and firewall at the gateway!  Your work on the IPv6 subnetting is spot on. It's like IPv4 subnetting, with a lot more space to play in."
ccna,3dncwk,CBRjack,3,Fri Jul 17 18:42:46 2015 UTC,IPv6 reluctantly supports NATing called NAT64. (https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6146). I have never implemented nor do I really plan to. I kind of think of just building the logic of the firewall into what would be a router. (which is what a firewall sort of is anyways).
ccna,3dncwk,PazDak,2,Sat Jul 18 03:08:44 2015 UTC,"Firewalls aren't routers. They both can perform functions that the other can but they are best at their strong suites.

NAT is not a firewall."
ccna,3dncwk,jpeek,2,Sat Jul 18 17:44:33 2015 UTC,While yes it requires less math on the front end. It requires a better understanding of things like multicast on the other end. Not just multicast but neighbor discovery as well.

You must NOT subnet bellow /64 because it will break SLAAC and most IPv6 aware-ish code that is too assertive to check for unusual subnet boundaries (that may be the case for many badly modernized software, remember most devs don't have any clue nor respect for network related standards)  You may (and probably should) only use shorter subnets on router to router links, but even if you use only a /126 you will reserve the entire /64 in your address plan."
ccna,3dncwk,chiwawa_42,1 point,Sat Jul 18 10:33:21 2015 UTC,Good to know. So how many bits do ISPs usually lease to customers?
ccna,3dncwk,chiwawa_42,1 point,Sat Jul 18 10:54:49 2015 UTC,"AFAIK, even when they allocate more than a single /64, only one can really be used because the software part of their customer's routers lacks configuration pages or commands to properly use more prefixes.  Still, I've seen most ISP allocate a /56 prefix to each customer, though the historical recommendation was /48.  On most SP networks I've contributed to, I've always set the allocation size at /56."
ccna,3dncwk,chiwawa_42,1 point,Sat Jul 18 11:17:31 2015 UTC,"If the historical recommendation was /48, wouldn't the global prefix have to be smaller than that? I mean, cuz then the ISP could only have one customer.  Are global prefixes typically actually smaller than 48 bits?"
ccna,3dncwk,chiwawa_42,2,Sat Jul 18 11:26:29 2015 UTC,"The idea was to reserve a /48 per ""user"", i.e. home or company, regardless of its size. 216 subnets ought to be enough for anyone.  That's also why the default PI block size is also /48, and why you shouldn't announce any more specific prefix on the public routing system. In fact, you must discard any incoming (eBGP) announcement for a prefix more specific than /48.  Now, the PA allocation default size is /32 (at least in the RIPE region). But they actually offer to go up to /29 without justification. The largest allocation I've seen from RIPE is /19. The DoD got a /13 (source, with more examples). It's like saying ""by default, you can't get less adresses than what you'd need for roughly 60k users"".  The publicly routable addresses beeing allocated from a /3 pool, there's still a lot of space left. And there are 5 more available blocks, because IANA thought ""If we screw up our addressing plan, we'd still have enough address to screw up 4 more times"". The same applies for ISPs."

Check out danscourses on youtube. He explains it slowly and well. And ya just keep searching to find someone on youtube that teaches at your level.

One book that I've found over the years that I really wish I had when starting out is Head First Networking. This book is easily readable, and covers quite a bit of the foundational knowledge one should have before tackling subjects like subnetting and vlans.  Good luck and enjoy the journey!"
ccna,3dnhms,Stoicynicism,2,Fri Jul 17 20:10:14 2015 UTC,"Sounds like you are subnetting, it took a while for me to get my head around that, practice, practice and more practice tends to the solution. Also the top link under helpful resources in the sidebar sends to some awesome videos which I found very useful.   Another thing that has helped me is using packet tracer to test and setup things at home. It helps reinforce some the concepts from the notes and learn your IOS commands."
ccna,3dnhms,nvoidz,1 point,Sat Jul 18 03:55:29 2015 UTC,"You need to learn the fundamentals. If you don't understand how technology works, how can you understand how technology communicates? Get into an A+ class if you can, or maybe consider going back to college for real IT courses. Also you should be spending every waking moment on a computer learning everything you can."
ccna,3dnhms,dgpoop,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:47:36 2015 UTC,"This is my suggestion, as well. I feel like OP may be getting ahead of things if he/she is brand new to IT and starting off with CCNA topics. Some people will call it an intro cert, but it's really not beginner-level material. You typically don't see people getting a CCNA and then going immediately into a networking position.   I mean, there's no reason why you can't start at a more advanced level and succeed, but there's a natural progression starting from beginner material that works better for most people. There's a reason why most network guys first cut their teeth on helpdesk and NOC jobs."
ccna,3dnhms,ModularPersona,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:00:24 2015 UTC,Mind expounding on your last sentence?
ccna,3dnhms,w0rkac,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:10:37 2015 UTC,"You typically don't see people get network jobs without any experience. A lot of people think that they can get hired for CCNA-level work once they've got the degree and the cert, but it rarely works out that way - most people have to get their foot in the door at a tier 1 job and work their way up.  Everyone's experience is different, but it's common for people to spend years at helpdesk before moving into networking - that's pretty much the norm for getting into any advanced role, really."
ccna,3dplen,Bigoncisco,3,Sat Jul 18 05:34:17 2015 UTC,"The reason a certification has value is because it demonstrates a degree of knowledge or skill.  If people obtain these certs, but don't match up to a minimum standard, the certification will start to lose value.  That's bad for everyone."

If you're not confident, then don't take it.  I went into my ICND2 exam knowing that I would pass. Guess what. I failed the first time. I was confident that I knew enough to pass, but I still failed. When there's $150 on the line, then confidence isn't enough. You should KNOW that you know it. Don't just be confident that you know it. Don't take the risk of failing. Learn more than you have too. That's my advice -- don't take the exam just to pass it. Take the exam when you KNOW 100% that you're ready. If you want a career in networking, then there's no time wasted in being over-prepared. Anything that you ""over-learn"" can be applied to CCNP."

About the sixth post down by cadetalain you will find your answer.  https://learningnetwork.cisco.com/thread/66193?tstart=0  Basically.  It's a shit question.  I didn't know that these were anycast addresses.  I also didn't know that an IPv6 address could have decimal instead of ::  The problem is that there have been a lot of deprecated things that happened with IPv6.

ccna,3dbiof,heatseekah,5,Wed Jul 15 00:04:37 2015 UTC,Traffic between hosts on the same vlan can't/shouldn't be routed.  You have routers between between hosts on the same vlan.  Let's consider what happens when 10.1.4.50/24 wants to talk to 10.1.4.100/24.  Both devices are on the same subnet so the default gateway isn't need.  The first host sends out an arp request to determine the MAC address of the second host.  The router receives the arp request and drops it because routers don't forward broadcast traffic.
ccna,3dbiof,ntp_insane,2,Wed Jul 15 01:03:23 2015 UTC,"You're absolutely right, thanks for clarifying that.  I should of known."
ccna,3dbiof,CBRjack,3,Wed Jul 15 01:23:11 2015 UTC,"Normally, you can't have two interfaces in the same subnet. So this topology wouldn't work.  Think of it this way, a packet destined to the VLAN gets in the router. The router looks in his routing table, where is he gonna send the packet? Locally connected has priority, so any packet destined to the part of the VLAN that is on another router would never get there.  There is a way, with bridging subinterface or L2VPN, but that's CCIE level and I don't think packet tracer handles that..."

ccna,3dbiof,HighGainWiFiAntenna,1 point,Wed Jul 15 01:24:11 2015 UTC,"Yea, as /u/CBRjack said you could delve into doing VPN configuration, but as it is currently it will not work. /u/CBRjack is correct in that locally connected networks will have priority and will be what you find in your routing table. I would recommend looking into Administrative Distance and how that influences what routes are added to the routing table.  Ignoring a VPN implementation, none of your VLAN 4 networks will leave their LANs because they will have an AD of 0. You can add those network statements to each routing protocol on your routers and the routers will definetly advertise those networks... but the routers wont add the other's VLAN 4 network because the directly connected route on the local router has an AD of 0 compared to EIGRP (90) or OSPF (110). Lowest AD wins."

You would encounter the same behavior on a single port interface.  The 3550 supports both ISL and 802.1q.  The 2960 only support 802.1q.  With dynamic auto or dynmaic desirable the 3550 will use DTP to determine if it needs to use ISL or 802.1q.

Brian covers about 90% of the things--and pretty much everything you will see in the sims, too. But you will be asked some questions that I don't recall Brian even mentioning.    edit: look at the exam blueprint for BOTH ICND 1 and 2. ICND2's blueprint does not mention things on ICND1's blueprint, but you will still be expected to know ICND1's topics for ICND2. In other words, 1 & 2 are cumulative, so if ICND1 mentions switchport security, but ICND2 doesn't, then you're still expected to know switchport security pretty well for ICND2."

Juniper certs have doubled my salary so I'm biased and happily drinking the juniper kool-aid. Both vendors will serve you well. Most network engineers know multiple vendors languages. Understand the technology and the vendor doesn't matter. And get juniper certs ;)

A lot of the commands are very similar to Cisco, and stuff like routing protocols and IP addresses aren't going to change between vendors anyway.  I'd say go for it.

During and after the recession employers sought to cut down on the insane amount of applications buy requiring a degree and or certs just to be considered for an interview. Paper cert guys and gals is what made the experience so important before 2008 as they had a handful of certs but weren't wroth more than the paper they were printed on.

Day 3 he tagged along with me to a client. Insisted he needed to change a number of things on the network that made no sense. Told the client in front of me that he would fix the network and everything would be great. Two Weeks later he goes out to the client F***ed up the network so bad he was fired on the spot when the boss found out.

ccna,3d4mpe,Sterkenburg,2,Sat Jul 18 20:42:12 2015 UTC,Will a computer science degree teach you anything that you will use day-to-day in your job?  Does every employer demand it?  Do people in the industry typically have post-secondary education?  Possibly not.  Can you get by without it?  Do people successfully get great jobs and start great careers every day without it?  Yes.  Do HR departments expect it?  Is it very much the new minimum standard?  Will it probably limit your options if you do not pursue post-secondary education?  Yes.

I have made the decision now to get my CCNA and CCNP, while going back to school to also get a degree (computer information systems, possibly wanting to minor in computer science as I enjoy programming as well) so that I can have the certs, degree, and hands on experience (I work for an ISP, new position in a few months will get me hands on with equipment) and really lock down the jobs I want.

ccna,3d4mpe,MyEvilTwinSkippy,1 point,Fri Jul 17 04:52:23 2015 UTC,"IMO, a degree is fantastic because it teaches you two things.   how to learn on your own. (learning, and memorizing are two different things.) One memorizes for lower level certs, but learns for a degree. (Again, my opinion) Specific stuff within IT in the coming years will be more and more valuable to have an understanding of specific scholarly things (although they don't necessarily apply in the real world.) For example, I was introduced to the notion of a SDLC, which is not something any employer will require of you to implement (unless stated) but will assume that you understand the importance of and will implement in your work on your own (since no one wants holes and inefficiencies in their systems life-cycle). But I don't think anyone in entry level would really be concerned with a SDLC methodology.    If you want to move past t1 management, a degree is not required again, but it shows that you have an aptitude for learning things on your own, which is hard to prove unless you already know the person giving you the job.   If you want to become a net. Eng. then sure, you could just get a CCNA. But having the degree puts you in a place beyond someone with a HS/BS degree and only a CCNA.   Again this is all my opinion, but speaking to people with an MS and people with BS I always feel like the people with a Masters are far more prepared to understand and convey information and come up with higher quality solutions.   This is not me saying people without a degree(s) are unworthy peons that should lick my boots."

You start with 16 network bits and have the 172.20.0.0/16. This means there are also 16 host bits.   NNNN.NNNN.HHHH.HHHH  You need to take away 11 host bits and add those to the network bits to go from /16 to /27.  NNNN.NNNN.NNNN.nnnhhhhh  Those 11 host bits that were taken from the host portion to the network portion allows you to gain an additional 2048 subnets. This also means you only have 5 host bits remaining. 25 = 32 (minus network and broadcast address for 30 usable).  Basically, you're going to ignore the original 16 bits allocated for the network bits (the /16). That doesn't matter. What does matter is the host bits. That 16 host bits you started with is what matters. Because when you subnet that original space from /16 down to /27 you're creating 11 new subnet bits and will have 5 host bits left over. These ""new"" bits are created within the host bit space. You have 16 host bits to start with, so 11 ""new"" network bits + 5 ""new"" host bits = 16.

I took my CCENT exam about a month ago and scored 100% on the subnetting portion. So I am really confused as to what they're talking about.  From my understanding 172.20.0.0 /27 is a class B network with a class C subnet mask which to me means that a class B address has been variably subnetted with a class C subnet mask.  By default a class B address which we have here has a /16 Network mask.  So NNNNNNNN.NNNNNNNN.HHHHHHHH.HHHHHHHH  So for addresses between 128.0.0.0 - 191.255.255.255 this would be the network mask.  However, from MY understanding this question is using classless variable subnetting because it uses a subnet of /27 Which falls in the range of a class C address  With all that said, this is how I would solve this question if it were on an exam.  For the 172.20.0.0 /27 network how many valid subnets and hosts per subnets are there?  NNNNNNNN.NNNNNNNN.SSSSSSSS.SSSHHHHH  Subnets = 211 = 2048 Valid Subnets Hosts = 2 5 - 2 = 30 (First address = network ID, Last address = Broadcast address)  NOTE: If I am incorrect please explain let me know.

The way I see it, questions like this have to be assuming classful addressing. Otherwise, there's no way we could arrive at the answer.

ccna,3d5pfq,bigfinger76,1 point,Tue Jul 14 04:33:06 2015 UTC,"I've been giving some thought on this question since last night. I think I got it. The bellow is based on my understanding of English wording and phrasing as non-native speaker and I in no way claim I am right.  How many subnets and hosts per subnet can you get from the network 172.29.0.0 255.255.255.224?  The phrase can you get from implies to me that 172.29.0.0/27 needs to be subnetted and you need to find what mask gives the most subnets and what mask gives the most hosts. It doesn't say anything that this subnet is result of already done subnetting, it's not given a larger network. So based on that conclusion:  We have: NNNNNNNN.NNNNNNNN.NNNNNNNN.NNNHHHHH  To find the maximum number of subnets: NNNNNNNN.NNNNNNNN.NNNNNNNN.NNNSSSHH  23 = 8  To find the maximum number of hosts per subnet: NNNNNNNN.NNNNNNNN.NNNNNNNN.NNNSHHHH  24 - 2 = 14  How many subnets and hosts per subnet can you get from the network 172.29.0.0 255.255.255.224?  8 subnets or 14 hosts per subnet  In my opinion and thoughts the way the question is asked, that's the most correct answer w/o assumptions."
ccna,3d5pfq,parcel621,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:45:25 2015 UTC,"The answer is 2048 subnets, 30 hosts, however. OP simply wanted to know why."
ccna,3d5pfq,xfmike,0,Tue Jul 14 23:25:43 2015 UTC,"Ok, I'm going to take another stab at this and try to explain why in my eyes its 8 subnets and 30 host  First off, the fact that it is a /27 means that it is NOT a classful. That means that any notion of a class B address is thrown out the window. If you wanted it to get to the the 2048 subnets it would be a /16 not a /27  so in this network we have 172.20.0.0 /27 NNNNNNNN.NNNNNNNN.NNNNNNNN.SSSHHHHH This means that the first three octets CANNOT be changed. Leaving you with the aforementioned 8 subnets @ 30 hosts per subnet  IF this were a classful question (which I highly doubt you'll ever see in real life, but it was used at one point.) then it would let you know and in that case, yes you would be right.   That is where all of these issues are coming from, nobody can agree on the specifics of the question"
ccna,3d5pfq,parcel621,3,Mon Jul 13 19:52:33 2015 UTC,"This is completely wrong.  Ignoring the switch from a /16 to a /27, you would have 227 networks (134,217,728) and 30 usable hosts in each.  The reason it is actually 2048 networks is because you already start with 16 network bits turned on (216 = 65,536 networks). Since you know you have 16 networks bits, you must have 16 host bits. Why? Because network bits + host bits always has to equal 32. Why? Because IPv4 is a 32 bit long address.  So, when you go from a /16 to a /27, you will be taking 11 bits away from the host portion and adding it to the network portion. 211 = 2048. this will leave you with 5 bits left over for the host portion, both because a /27 has 5 host bits and because your subnetting down the original host portion of 16 bits. Well, when you take 16 host bits and remove 11 bits that went to the network portion, you're left with 5 bits. 25 = 32 (minus broadcast and network address for 30 usable).  If the question was originally meant to go from /24 to a /27, yes, you would only have 8 subnets with 30 usable hosts because in that scenario (which is not the scenario the OP talks about) you add 3 bits to the network portion. 23 = 8."

ccna,3ct6ar,0010000100111111,3,Fri Jul 10 16:10:25 2015 UTC,"I hate to break it to you, but the major network containing 172.29.0.0  is not  a /16.  Before CIDR,  this would have traditionally been a Class B network; however,   there  has been no such thing as a Class B network for a very long time.  The actual RIR allocation is  172.16.0.0/12.  Also,  due to classless addressing,  there is no requirement whatsoever to use the same subnet mask  for every subnet  when dividing a major network,  and it would be very unusual to reuse the same subnet mask on multiple subnets,   Therefore:   the number of subnets you can have is pretty large,  you can allocate a single /27 from the /12,  and then  allocate  the rest as /30s,  so you can still construct about  262136  other /30 subnets,  even if you allocate off a /27."
ccna,3ct6ar,Draco1200,1 point,Sat Jul 11 03:17:36 2015 UTC,"True.  However, for 172.29.0.0 to be a network address like it says in the question,  the largest network mask would be /16."
ccna,3ct6ar,The_camperdave,1 point,Sat Jul 11 04:56:20 2015 UTC,"Yes,  but the only way 172.29.0.0 becomes a network address is by the network operator making a decision about how to apportion the prefix 172.16.0.0/12  In that case,  you are subdividing a subdivision,  and    172.29.0.0/24 is just as valid a choice as 172.29.0.0/16.  The original question doesn't specify the prefix list for the parent 172.29.0.0  network......  therefore,   the number of hosts and possible sizes of sub-allocations are indeterminate."
ccna,3ct6ar,Draco1200,6,Sat Jul 11 15:48:32 2015 UTC,"Technically, there is insufficient information to answer this question.  Classful subnetting was deprecated back in 1993. Since then, all networks have both a base address and a network mask.   You need two masks to do subnetting, and you only have one (The first mask indicates which bits are network bits and which bits are host bits.  The second mask indicates which host bits are being treated as subnet bits).  So you have two cases, one where 255.255.255.224 is the network mask, and one where the 255.255.255.224 is the subnetting mask.  Case 1 - 255.255.255.224 is the networking mask 10101100.00011101.00000000.00000000  Base Address 11111111.11111111.11111111.11100000  Network Mask 11111111.11111111.11111111.111?????  Unknown Subnetting Mask   Since there is no indication of what fills in the last five bits, you could have 2 networks of 14 hosts, 4 networks of 6 hosts, or 8 networks of 2 hosts.    Case 2 - 255.255.255.224 is the subnetting mask 10101100.00011101.00000000.00000000  Base Address 11111111.1111????.????????.???00000  Unknown Network Mask 11111111.11111111.11111111.11100000  Subnetting Mask   Some may claim that 172.29.0.0 is a class B address.  It was, back in the early 1990s.  Today, it is simply an address in the 172.16.0.0/12 private address space.  (Note that this address space is not a set of /16 addresses, but a single /12 address block.)  Now, if you consider that it says that 172.29.0.0 is a network, that narrows the network mask to:  10101100.00011101.00000000.00000000  Base Address 11111111.11111111.????????.???00000  Unknown Network Mask   So that leaves /16-/27 as possible network masks, which in turn means anywhere from 2-2048 subnets with anywhere from 32766 to 30 hosts per subnet."

ccna,3ct6ar,BroadStreet_Bully3,1 point,Mon Jul 13 21:16:48 2015 UTC,"They are erroneously assuming 172 that 172.29.0.0 is a class B network with a mask of /16.  It's not (although it does fall into the old Class B range). There are no such things as IP address classes anymore.  There hasn't been for more than twenty years.  Prior to 1981, they had fixed addressing.  The first octet held the network number, and the remaining octets held the local address number.  Back in those days, routes between networks were hand calculated and fixed.  That was okay, as there were only a handful of networks, each with only a handful of machines.  You can see lists of network in some of the early RFC documents  By 1981, the network of interconnected networks was growing, and they realized that they were going to need more than 256 networks.  They also realized that they didn't need three whole bytes to designate the local address.  So they introduced address classes, delineated by the three  most significant bits of the address.  If the most significant bit of the address was 0, then the next 7 bits would be the network number, and the remaining 24 bits would be the host address.  These are Class A addresses.  If the most significant two bits were 10, then the next 14 bits would be the network number, and the rest - 16 bits - would be the host address; Class B.  If the first three bits of the address were 110, then it would be a Class C address.  The next 21 bits would be network address, followed by 8 bits of local address.  Addresses where the  high order bits were 111 were reserved.  In 1996, they extended the addressing scheme with Class D (high order bits 1110) and Class E networks (high order bits 1111).    In 1993 the IETF introduced classless inter-domain routing.  The network classes of the past were eliminated, and subnet masks were introduced. Because of the deployed equipment, the masks originally kept the same network/host divisions as the former class-oriented system.  The classless system was originally designed to allow Class A and Class B networks to be split and shared.  It was also introduced to simplify the global routing tables."

If you want 2000 networks and 30 hosts in each network then do this:  You have a supernet of 172.29.0.0/16 and within that supernet you have multiple /27 networks, the first would be :  172.29.0.0/27 and the last would be 172.29.255.224/27  That would give you 2048 nets with 30 hosts each within a supernet  range of 172.29.0.0/16, each net would be a /27.  Don't mix classless and classfull, they have nothing to do with each other.  Read RFC 4632 or this Wikipedia page, look at the table at the bottom, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classless_Inter-Domain_Routing .  Just to be clear a /27 absolutely does not give you 2000 nets, it gives you 8."
ccna,3ct6ar,bigfinger76,1 point,Sat Jul 11 01:20:35 2015 UTC,"Classless Inter-Domain Routing:       Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR, pronunciation: /ˈsaɪ.dr/ or /ˈsi.dr/) is a method for allocating IP addresses and routing Internet Protocol packets. The Internet Engineering Task Force introduced CIDR in 1993 to replace the previous addressing architecture of classful network design in the Internet. Its goal was to slow the growth of routing tables on routers across the Internet, and to help slow the rapid exhaustion of IPv4 addresses.    IP addresses are described as consisting of two groups of bits in the address: the most significant bits are the network address (or network prefix or network block), which identifies a whole network or subnet, and the least significant set forms the host identifier, which specifies a particular interface of a host on that network. This division is used as the basis of traffic routing between IP networks and for address allocation policies. Classful network design for IPv4 sized the network address as one or more 8-bit groups, resulting in the blocks of Class A, B, or C addresses. Classless Inter-Domain Routing allocates address space to Internet service providers and end users on any address bit boundary, instead of on 8-bit segments. In IPv6, however, the interface identifier has a fixed size of 64 bits by convention, and smaller subnets are never allocated to end users.  CIDR notation is a syntax for specifying IP addresses and their associated routing prefix. It appends a slash character to the address and the decimal number of leading bits of the routing prefix, e.g., 192.168.2.0/24 for IPv4, and 2001:db8::/32 for IPv6.

ccna,3ct6ar,completelyowned,1 point,Fri Jul 10 18:58:30 2015 UTC,"There is a difference between classful and classless addressing. The old standard was classful addressing. This means that there are three classes (A, B, and C) of subnet masks. Class A is /8, Class B is /16, and Class C is /24 always. Later on they changed mostly to using classless addressing which means that there are more options than just the three classes. The classless system allows options between /8, /16/ and /24.   In classless addressing most people do not refer to any subnet as being Class A, B, or C, even if it is a /8, /16, or /24. This is why he meant that the class didn't matter."

Rfc1518, Rfc1723 was published in 1993.   Since then the standard has been classless IP addressing,  and classful addressing immediately became deprecated with the rapid move to BGP-4 in the early 1990s."

The first two should cover CCENT and ICND 2 (OR CCNA Routing & Switching) while the third is for CCNA Security.   CCENT is a good intro. You can study, take the exam, and have a cert of minimal value, but it's a stepping stone to the 'real' stuff.  CCNA R/S is a 'real' cert (still entry level) that follows on from that.   You can take one big exam for CCNA R/S and save $5 if you pass first try. Totally your call.  Someone else can probably desire CCNA Security better than me, but it's a separate cert of the same 'tier' as R/S."

You need directed study, that is you need to know which topics to study and to what depth.  Lammle is good, that is the book I used but my key to passing was Boson.  I read Lammle and got an overview then I bought the Boson kit with cert guides, exam sim and NetSim.  Then I took exam A and got about 40%, went through in study mode, referring to the cert guide and Lammle for every answer.  Then it was labs, labs, labs and more labs.  Then I did exam B and got 68% and did the whole study thing and labs over again.  Using the Boson exams to direct my learning I ended up with 14 pages of hand written core notes, which along with the labs was what I needed to pass.  I took the final Boson exam on the morning of my real exam and got 81%, just below the pass mark but passed the real exam, if anything the Boson was harder.  I did ICND1 and then ICND2 but used the same method for both.  I needed about 10 x 14 hour days of solid study for each part, I don't know how these people offering CCNA training in 6 days manage it, there is no way I would have passed with only 6 days.

I'm not sure if this works on Windows or Macs, but on Linux machines, you can create a connection to your computer's ethernet card.  That means, you can connect your real world hardware up to the virtual network that you build in the GNS simulation.  GNS's two downfalls are that you have to obtain real Cisco IOS software, and that GNS doesn't do switches very well.  Basically, you have to use a modular router and add a multi-ethernet module to the router."

ccna,3cor2w,I_will_have_you_CCNA,3,Thu Jul 9 15:42:38 2015 UTC,You know a /24 mask gives your 254 addresses. So move backwards.   /23 gives you 510. So that matches the number of hosts.   Does it match the number of subjects?
ccna,3cor2w,HighGainWiFiAntenna,2,Thu Jul 9 15:48:30 2015 UTC,"Actually, should i be solving for the hosts requirement or the subnet requirement?  As I understand it, there are two different methods for both?"
ccna,3cor2w,HighGainWiFiAntenna,2,Thu Jul 9 16:06:06 2015 UTC,"You solve for both. I didn't give you the complete answer, because I wanted you to work the rest of it out.   Which should you solve for (first) when you have two requirements?    You can go either direction. I find it easier to solve for host firsts, as 256 is dead easy to remember. We've seen /24 our whole lives in our crappy consumer routers.   If you solve for hosts first, then you can see if that mask allows the number of required subnets.   This is a generalization, but I've found that subnetting questions are generally trying to find x number of hosts.   It's not like someone can design a network and just guess that they need 100 subnets. No more than likely they will say I have 3 departments that have 25 users each and one department with 120 users. What mask can I use to accommodate this?  We want our networks to be as efficient as possible, and this is easier when they are smaller. Other wise we'd have a 10.x.x.x network for everything."
ccna,3cor2w,HighGainWiFiAntenna,1 point,Thu Jul 9 16:25:36 2015 UTC,I need 29 zero bits to accommodate 260 hosts.  So counting over that puts me at 255.255.254.0 ?
ccna,3cor2w,HighGainWiFiAntenna,1 point,Thu Jul 9 17:22:25 2015 UTC,"EEK.  Let's start from zero (meaning from scratch).  The number after the ""/"" tell you how many NETWORK bits you have.  (Hence subNET).  So a /24 tells you that you are using 24 bits for your network and 8 bits for your hosts. (However, some of those network bits are ""assumed"" because of your class a,b,c networks.  More on that below).    To find the number of host bits, simply subtract the number after the ""/"" from 32.  (IPV4 addresses are 32 bits in length.)  So a /25 mask means 7 bits for your hosts.  (32-25=7) a /23 mask means you now have 9 bits for your hosts (32-23).   How do we determine number of hosts / number of subnets?  Number of subnets = 2^n where N is the number of network bits (or the number after the ""/"" subtracted classful mask)  For a class b network classful mask = 16.  (23-16) = 7 For a class a network classful mask = 8. (23-8) = 15   I finding counting for hosts easier, because I am subtracting the / from 32.  Counting for subnets takes three steps.  Determine class of network.  / - classful mask.  (subtract).  Then multiply 2 to the power of that number.   Number of hosts = 2^H -2 where H is the number of hosts bits  (or 32 - the number after the ""/"")  It's way easier to count based on host bits because the numbers are smaller.  Do you know what 2^15 is off the top of your head?  I can do 2^8 really easily though.    So you need 260 hosts.  2^X (two to the power of what) give you more than 260?  We know 2^8=256.  That won't work. The next highest number?  2^9=512.  So we are covered on number of hosts.    So we have used 9 bits for hosts. (255.255.254.0).  How many bits are left for network?  (32-9) =23.  Hey, 255.255.254.0 = /23!  How many networks does that get us?"

ccna,3co1g6,I_will_have_you_CCNA,12,Thu Jul 9 12:00:59 2015 UTC,Both!  We talk about ethernet frames and IP packets - so a router sends an ethernet frame which contains an IP packet (which contains a UDP datagram) to its next hop.

What changes is at layer 2, so on an ethernet link, the layer 3 packet is unchanged and encapsulated in an ethernet frame.  On a serial link it would be encapsulated in a serial frame like HDLC or PPP.  I am simplifying but I hope you get the idea.  (Its actually a bit more complicated, some layer 2 techs need to chop up the packet and reassemble it but way outside the scope of what you need)."

With the cost of high bandwidth links spiraling down quickly, jobs are created to manage new possibilities.  10 years ago, a client would have had a T1, or a 10Mbps line. Now we provision gigabit links daily. We have a few clients with 10G links. We even have one particular client with a 10G internet pipe (online casino). With all this bandwidth on the cheap comes applications in the cloud, storage in the cloud, private cloud in the cloud (I wish I was joking...).  Every single cloud and subcloud need network engineers. Businesses that relied on fax and papers now run virtual desktop from a citrix farm with their website on AWS and their files on dropbox. Every single *aaS need networking behind it. Every online order, every real time tracking, even billboard ads and bus station that now have IPs requires teams of engineer so everything works as it should.  Everyone is connected all the time, facebooking their friends, instagraming their meals and tindering their nights... All of this on a transparent network. This runs on the sweat, blood and tears of network engineers everywhere.  Is there a lot of competition, yes. Is there a lot of jobs, yes. How can you distinguish yourself, get something more than cisco! Once you have a CCNA, get a JNCIA, or a BCNE. It's the same stuff, just a different syntax, and it will put you ahead."
ccna,3che9d,CBRjack,2,Wed Jul 8 00:06:58 2015 UTC,"These certs take a lot of time. A lot. From zero to ccnp can't be had in under 6 months, and that's if you're REALLY putting the time in tremendously.   Add your other certs for 'distinction' and you've burned through how many months or years. It's disheartening."
ccna,3che9d,CBRjack,3,Wed Jul 8 00:23:02 2015 UTC,"Sure, CCNP is hard, very hard. But take a look at the BCNE for example, I read the given material and passed it 8 days after passing my CCNA. Syntax is very close, OSPF is the same, no EIGRP, ACLs are identical, all in all, Brocade IP switches have a lot less options so config is easier."
ccna,3che9d,CBRjack,2,Wed Jul 8 00:48:40 2015 UTC,I didn't know that honestly. I get confused by the other certs (juniper / brocade) because their acronym structure isn't as logical as cisco's.
ccna,3che9d,DrSilkyJohnston,1 point,Wed Jul 8 00:51:49 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I totally understand you. I've looked at Juniper certs, but decided to go for CCNP first. Brocade however, we are trying to become a VAR, so ai can talk more about the certs.  Brocade has four tracks : FICON, Fabric (FiberChannel), Internetworking (IP) and Converged Networking (FCoE).  In the tracks, it starts by an accreditation (20$, online on your pc), then it goes into certifications. Acronyms are plentiful (and ridiculous, like BFCoEAS, Brocade Fiber Channel over Ethernet Accredited Specialist) but look at the Internetworking track.  You have the BCNE, which is like the CCNA, but a bit simpler. Then you have BCLE, which are for load-balancers.  After that you got the BCNP, which is like the CCNP, without EIGRP, but with advanced BGP and with proprietary MCT protocol. Then you have BCLP, which is again for load balancers.  I did the BCNE by reading the provided guide, studying it at work in my downtime for a few days, then I did the exam. I got 91%, you need 58% to pass (yes, 58%...)  Then I studied for my CCNP Route, and the BCNP guide, for about two months, and di the BCNP. I got 88%, you need 60% to pass. I'm still studying and labbing for my CCNP Route, will try it probably at the end of August."
ccna,3che9d,CBRjack,3,Wed Jul 8 01:04:57 2015 UTC,"To add on to this, I read through the BCNE in a Nutshell guide once, which is kind of like a study guide for Brocade certs, and basically walked in and passed it. I had my CCNA prior so I knew the technology but if you learn the technology and protocols, you can kind of transfer that knowledge to other vendors. Cisco is the best way to learn from the ground up because there is so much material, the commands might be different for other vendors but protocols don't change.   Also a BCNP here, but I didn't really go off the guide for it for that one, had a 2 day course taught by a guy from Brocade and took the exam the morning after our 2nd day of class."
ccna,3che9d,jpeek,1 point,Wed Jul 8 03:42:44 2015 UTC,"It's even more silly to call someone who can answer a few online questions an ""Accredited Specialist"". Or just plainly, the BFCoEAS is a shitty acronym anyway... BFAS would have done the job"

Once you find it you will be comfortable selling yourself in the interview, you'll land the job and you can come back here and post the ""so glad you got your CCNA, I got the job"" post."
ccna,3che9d,jpeek,1 point,Wed Jul 8 13:11:03 2015 UTC,"It's not a confidence thing. It's a reality check that economically things aren't wonderful, that Cisco is being overtaken (slowly) by competitors, and that a saturated work force of skilled workers means less pay and less opportunity. That's simple supply / demand.   If anything has shaken my confidence, it's been the repeated posts on this forum about people not getting jobs or how important it is to have Cisco experience over certs, or just the general air of self-importance I've experienced by (some) people with LOTS of certs and experience (like they are scared the next gen of workers is on their way to replace them)."
ccna,3che9d,jpeek,3,Tue Jul 7 23:18:37 2015 UTC,"To think getting this certificate is going to land a networking job right away is naive. Experience is king in most any field. That being said it can open doors especially if you are already working in a help desk job or some other entry level position.   The same can be said about college degrees yet people still are still getting hired. The short term may seem bleak but once you get your foot in the door, the long term offers promise."
ccna,3che9d,snorkel42,2,Tue Jul 7 23:29:10 2015 UTC,"It's all a matter of perspective, I think. It's not that all these people getting their CCNAs are now more people you need to compete against; the competition has been there the moment that you and they decided to get into networking. Your competition is each and every person going for the same job, and a cert is just one of many factors.   You're competing against new CCNAs, people studying for the CCNA, people already working in tier 1 who want to get into networking positions (I'd be more worried about them), people with Net+ (I got hired with a Net+), people with JNCIAs, people with connections, etc.  That's the thing about getting your foot in the door - that's your chance to really separate yourself from the pack through your hard work and attitude. Plus, it's usually easier to move up, internally. As someone has already said, getting a CCNA doesn't mean having a job fall into your lap. It's just that, with all else being equal, a CCNA makes you look better than someone who doesn't have one and it'll get you past some HR filters. Someone with actual networking experience will be moved to the top of the pile in most cases, and you'll be competing against those guys, too.  It used to be that getting certified was how you rose above the competition; now that the cert industry is a big business and everyone is getting certified, it's becoming more of a baseline and you'll have to distinguish yourself in other ways.  TL:DR - When yet another person gets a CCNA, not much has actually changed in terms of your competition in the job market."
ccna,3che9d,snorkel42,1 point,Tue Jul 7 23:37:33 2015 UTC,"I understand this mindset, as I used to think like this, and often times I still joke around with the network team about how they're competition.   However, the IT field and network field is so rapidly growing that it's hard to consider them a threat. You gotta believe in yourself and sell yourself like you're the best. Remember to look up at the stars and not down at your feet."
ccna,3che9d,vanquish28,1 point,Wed Jul 8 18:01:26 2015 UTC,"There is way more demand than supply. I went from making 40k to low 6 figures in less than 5 years (in a median cost of living state.) The demand for skilled engineers is huge. I welcome more CCNAs!   FYI, we are going to replace the next gen. So guess what, we will need to step up our game. They've had 30+ years with the opportunity to learn these things from the very beginning.  For our industry there are no crappy economic opportunities. Just unexploited ones. If you are struggling to find a job, you're missing the opportunity some how. Maybe you need to work on your interviewing skills. Maybe your resume looks like it's written by a highschooler. Or maybe you're just living in the wrong area."

ccna,3cfe3b,HighGainWiFiAntenna,5,Tue Jul 7 17:35:16 2015 UTC,"There's been a number of changes.  IPv6 is obviously the biggest change (though people report not seeing much of it on their exams, although this is obviously subject to change).    Foundationally they are the same.  It's not like OSPF / EIGRP have changed or that suddenly there are more IPv4 address ranges.  Everything is additional to what you already know.  (Not sure what the content was before), but as a for instance in the CCNP content, OSPFv3 now has two different configuration types.    Some of the other changes have been in terms of command structure, but most of that has happened because of changes in IOS.  (Nothing at CCNA quickly comes to mind, except how can you enable ospf / eigrp on an interface level instead of using net statements in router config mode)."
ccna,3cfe3b,HighGainWiFiAntenna,1 point,Tue Jul 7 16:59:42 2015 UTC,Thanks for the reply. I'll see if I can find some updated material to try and get up to speed.  Do you know of any good simulators other than Packet Tracer?

ccna,3cb70f,verytguy,1 point,Mon Jul 6 20:25:18 2015 UTC,"My assessment center is all PCs and and we have a row dedicated to PearsonVue tests (ie what Cisco tests go through) 2 rows dedicates to other online tests, and a fourth row dedicated to paper tests. They gave me a laminated legal sized graph paper and a thin marker (Fresh out of the box, lucky me. It was very easy to write with, just like a normal pen).   The people at the assessment center have seen me around since I'm a student there and they said I could come in whenever I was ready since I had an appointment. I had shown up an hour early so I had 30 minutes to cram and went in 30 minutes prior to the time.  They take your picture. They need 2 IDs -- one govn't issued photo ID (your license) and another signed ID (I used my Social Security card)  It was crowded this week because it's the end of summer session I so everyone was taking their finals! But even crowded it wasn't terrible. Everyone was quiet.  EDIT: I live in the United States so your mileage may vary elsewhere!

ccna,3cd3ij,Not_Hulk_Hogan,2,Mon Jul 6 23:45:52 2015 UTC,There seems to be a lot of information and understanding that you are missing here. I am on my phone and not able to cover it all but basically on each vlan I am going to use an ip helper command that references the dhcp server. One or multiple dhcp servers on a different subnet can be offered to a different clan via the IP helper. Then on the dhcp server I an going to setup multiple scopes.
ccna,3cd3ij,nibbles200,1 point,Tue Jul 7 17:14:56 2015 UTC,"In an enterprise network, you will usually run a separate dhcp server."
ccna,3cd3ij,CBRjack,1 point,Tue Jul 7 00:29:23 2015 UTC,"It's not uncommon to have a separate and redundant dhcp server. In larger organizations, it may be most cost effective to do this centrally, and use dhcp-relay to hand out appropriate leases to the right networks. I do this myself using ISC DHCPD.  This does create a dependency on the links between your LAN and wherever you have your master/slave DHCP servers. However, in a sufficiently large network, if those links are down, you're going to have worse problems than just failing to get a DHCP lease. Most resources are likely to be an L3 hop away anyway.  EDIT: Re: VRRP. Most dhcp servers that I'm familiar with are bound to interfaces, not IPs, as it is an L2 protocol. Running master/slave servers on the same segment requires that they synchronize with each other; ISC does this handily. Adding dhcp-relay to the mix can get a bit trickier, as not all dhcp-relay clients support multiple upstream servers. (I'm looking at you, Ubnt!) Proper config allows you to specify multiple dhcp servers, and VRRP is probably unnecessary. YMMV with other DHCP implementations."
ccna,3cay8m,I_will_have_you_CCNA,15,Mon Jul 6 14:17:08 2015 UTC,"Loopback's have many uses, not just OSPF. Probably the biggest benefit is that a loopback will always be up/active (assuming someone doesn't shut it down manually). This means regardless of which physical interfaces may be up/down, the loopback IP will always be reachable. This is ideal for management and monitoring of a device - if you were to have your management and/or monitoring set to an actual interface IP, and that interface goes down, you may have a problem checking/accessing the device.  I use them as the source/destination for GRE tunnels as well sometimes, mostly for the reason above (always being up).  It's also good to use the loopback as a source-interface for things like NTP, SNMP/syslog, netflow, etc. It gives a consistent identity to the router that doesn't rely on a single physical interface.  OSPF is just a protocol that makes use of them, other protocols can make use of them too. EIGRP has a router-id parameter that can be set manually or will use a interface IP (like OSPF), and should be linked to a loopback.  Also very useful for labs/studying since you can create as many interfaces as you need (simulating extra hosts/networks) without actually needing more devices/physical interfaces."
ccna,3cay8m,chuckbales,2,Mon Jul 6 14:33:58 2015 UTC,"Just to add to the routing protocol list:  Loopbacks can be all kinds of useful in BGP where you want to have multiple circuits between two peers, but easily load-balance across all of them.  1) Loopbacks  2) static routes  3) update-source  4) multihop  5) ???  6) load-balanced"

ccna,3cay8m,HighGainWiFiAntenna,3,Mon Jul 6 19:35:54 2015 UTC,"It's pretty easy to build.  Just put, say, 3 links between two devices. Put a unique /30 on each of the links. Create a Loopback on each device. On both sides, add 3 static routes to the far-end's loopback, where the next hop for each static route is the opposite side of one of your directly connected /30s. Now build BGP like you normally do, but make the neighbor address that of the far-end's loopback, and make sure to use the router subcommand ""ebgp-multihop 2"" or something greater than 2 if you need to be safe."

ccna,3cay8m,HighGainWiFiAntenna,2,Mon Jul 6 23:40:52 2015 UTC,"Great examples here for OSPF and BGP.  Loopbacks are also quite useful for MPLS, and protocols built on MPLS like traffic engineering, VPLS tunnels and the like. It's imperative to have a unique identifier that is completely independent of the underlying routing architecture, which may be dynamic and should be resilient.  Another handy use is to group loopbacks by a larger subnet. Let's say I'm building firewall rules, and I am using 10.20.30.0/24 broken out into /32s for my loopbacks. I can refer to an entire class of devices, or transit routes, with one mask, or anything from 24-32, depending on how I wish to subnet. This ought to be more handy than building up an ACL from a variety of disparate or noncontiguous networks."

ccna,3cay8m,Joe_testing,2,Tue Jul 7 03:32:25 2015 UTC,Adding to /u/chuckbales   They're mostly /32 (255.255.255.255) addresses used for management and source-interfaces for features mentioned. It's quite handy to SSH to the loopback 10.1.1.1/32 in case you need to clean up your config so you don't risk severing the leg your standing on. i.e. deleting the sub/vlan interface you just ssh'ed to when you've put an ACL denying SSH to the p2p ip.....  It's also used for testing and troubleshooting things - instead of creating interface vlans/subinterfaces etc to test some route you just put the subnet IP on a loopback.

ccna,3c7tqn,IArgueWithAtheists,2,Sun Jul 5 18:33:14 2015 UTC,"a) have you ran ""no ip routing"" on the router with the etherswitch module? - so that its treated as a switch.  b) have you got the trunk port configured on your ether-switch interface connected to the ROAS?  c) if you run ""sh int fa 0/0.1"", does the output confirm that ""Encapsulation 802.1Q Virtual LAN, Vlan ID  10""  Here's Cisco's guide on ROAS interVLAN routing for reference: link"

ccna,3c7tqn,HighGainWiFiAntenna,2,Sun Jul 5 22:50:23 2015 UTC,"I hate to say this, but the ROAS configuration you are trying to do you will NEVER encountered in the real world. You've got a better chance of encountering routing over ISDN or doing IPv6 routing over frame relay.   That etherswitcher card was never designed to emulate ASIC in a switch or to properly do vlans or intervlan routing.   Every moment your spend using gns to learn switching is a moment you've wasted. Download packet tracer, please. You can do all the intervlan routing with both SVI and ROAS you want, without having to learn the ass-backwards method the etherswitcher router uses to do vlans and everything else.   Why do people do this?? Gns doesn't support switching. It just doesn't. Unless you've got IOU (which STILL have limitations and are questionably pirating), gns can't do switching. CAN NOT."
ccna,3c7tqn,0010000100111111,2,Sun Jul 5 19:27:50 2015 UTC,What about hooking up real switches to GNS3 and using virtual routers with it? Is this possible?
ccna,3c7tqn,HighGainWiFiAntenna,3,Sun Jul 5 20:54:22 2015 UTC,"Absolutely. That's the best way to learn the SWITCH curriculum.   To do it properly, you need a usb-to-lan dedicated card.   You can do it with a Microsoft loop back adapter, but then you're bridging your loop back adaptor to your actual adaptor (however your computer gets out to world) and things get messy.   I've got usb to LAN for each of my physical switches."
ccna,3c7tqn,0010000100111111,2,Sun Jul 5 21:08:25 2015 UTC,"Ah, that's interesting. I've never heard of a USB-to-LAN adaptor. I have 6 x 2950 switches I could use in conjunction with GNS3--however, I have no idea how to set it up.  Do you know of any good video tutorials or publications that provide instructions on how to set up switching via usb-to-lan as you mentioned? That would be an amazing help!"
ccna,3c7tqn,HighGainWiFiAntenna,2,Sun Jul 5 22:28:32 2015 UTC,"Here is link #1 along with a full set up of how to do it.  http://www.gns3.net/articles/ccie-routing-switching-lab/usb-to-ethernet-network-adapters-option/  This is definitely the adapter you want.    https://www.monoprice.com/Product?c_id=103&cp_id=10311&cs_id=1031102&p_id=6150&seq=1&format=2  You definitely need a powered usb hub.  These take a lot of power, and without the additional power, the will connect/reconnect.    Here's a second link with some other type of adapters.  http://gns3vault.com/faq/connect-real-switches-to-gns3-using-a-cheap-usb-nics/  Here are two other methods, not using the USB adaptor:  http://gns3vault.com/faq/ccie-lab-using-gns3-and-quad-nics-for-switches/  http://gns3vault.com/faq/connect-real-switches-to-gns3-using-a-breakout-switch/   The breakout switch option sucks.  Firstly, one of your switches is basically ""wasted"" and cant be used for anything but the breakout option.  Secondly, hopefully your inherent ethernet card doesn't strip 802.1 tags.  I wasted a lot of time on this option, and gave up.     NOTE and please read this.  I did not set up GNS3 to real gear to practice ROAS.  I did it to expand my topologies (and for the challenge).  It's hard to get all the proper vlan information to pass over this ""trunk"" link between computer to switch.  I found it easiest to create the ""cloud"" in GNS and add my adaptors. I would dedicate a port and a /30 subnet from one of my (virtual) routers that would connect to the ""cloud"" (USB NIC) which would then feed down into my switches were I used a routed port (layer 3).  I bypassed all the nonsense with vlan tagging not working properly by simply going layer 3 instead of layer 2.    It's also much more enjoyable to see your virtual gear create OSPF/EIGRP neighborships with your real gear.  If the virtual router connected to the switch had full L3 topology information, it would pass that over to its neighbor and real gear / fake gear could talk to each other, including (oddly enough) CDP information, which was report NOT to work."

ccna,3c6e54,allseed,2,Tue Jul 7 00:10:43 2015 UTC,"A great question to ask yourself is: ""Does this invoke a passion in me?"" If you can say yes and find yourself actively being curious about the back end of it, thoroughly enjoying what you're learning and actively asking questions that may or may not either be related or too advanced, then you should aim for it. Go at your own pace, don't be afraid to reread beginning chapters if you're halfway through, just don't doubt yourself or what you've learned and you'll make the best decision for yourself. One thing to understand is that you're never going to have all the answers, but maybe you can get better and discovering what they are in this field."

Also gives a great foundation into the feild if you study and learn the material. It will also give you a better idea of what networking is overall. Then you can decide if you want to continue further. Great stepping stone.

ccna,3c38h0,HighGainWiFiAntenna,3,Mon Jul 6 13:03:28 2015 UTC,"Yikes.... Unless you want to take the exam more than once, read the books. The CCNA is by design very theoretical, and requires a lot of memorization of very specific information. Labs are just a portion of the exam, and usually knowing the various show commands are going to be most important to you. Most videos and lectures aren't going to get into the nitty-gritty details the way the Cisco Press books by Wendell Odom do. You should use videos and lectures as a complement to your book studies, not as a substitute. Its a pain is the rear to read those brick sized books, but its necessary. I know I probably read each of mine at least 3 times through before each exam."
ccna,3c38h0,tartars,3,Sat Jul 4 15:03:36 2015 UTC,"I think you have to go with the grain of what works for you.  I don't like the videos, being British I can't deal with the accents.  I also find the Cisco Press books very hard to read, 30 minutes and I'm ready to hurl myself out of the window!  I do labs, labs and more labs and then fill in by picking bits out of a book.  You have to find a book that works for you, I'm a fan of Tod Lammle, his books really work for me.  My friend prefers 'CCNA in 60 days' which he picked up for free through Kindle lending library.  Chris Bryant over on Udemy offers his video lectures in a workbook, which might work for you.  I would say labs will get you 70% of the way there but you won't pass with them alone.  You need to dip into a book to round out your knowledge, for example at CCNA, the IPV6 labs a re really simple, the ones I've seen all use Global addresses, you need to read around to learn about things like EUI-64, Link local, multicast etc..  Conversely, NAT/PAT labs more than cover whats needed.  So do it your way, use all the resources, videos/labs/books in a proportion that suits your learning style but make sure your learning structure covers all the learning objectives, which you can find on the Cisco Learning website."
ccna,3c38h0,nCognit0,2,Sat Jul 4 21:23:03 2015 UTC,"At least skim through every page to see if there are any terms you're not familiar with so you have an idea of what you need to do a deep dive into. This would be to simply know enough to pass the test.   If you want to master the technology and really understand the why and how, not just be able to configure the devices/protocols, then yes it's very important to read the books."

It does take 3-10 days for the results to make it to Cisco before they 'confirm' it on their end.  I'm sure as it gets closer to that date, I'm going to get more and more nervous..."

I didn't want to write this thread as a bragging post, either, but I definitely scored way higher on the ICND2 than ICND1.  Great job, yourself :)"

ccna,3bxi1c,Spectura,3,Fri Jul 3 01:22:15 2015 UTC,"Thanks, I appreciate it!  Regarding studying, scheduling, and resources, I suppose you could say that I have a couple of big advantages.  I've been in the route/switch career for quite a few years, but never got a college degree or certifications, and I'm catching up.  So I've got a lot of on-the-job training managing our corporate network, where we run BGP, EIGRP, and OSPF for dynamic routing.  The only thing I never really had to deal with was STP, because...it kinda just works behind the scenes...  Also, I'm working on my college degree, and my college offers a lot of Cisco based classes (route/switch, security, voice), and completing those gave me a more solid foundation, not just how it works, but what the technology is actually doing and why it's doing what it is doing.  But I started with Packet Tracer and built up most of my labs in that.  Over time, I've started gathering some routers, L2 and L3 switches, and a couple of 5505's.  I'll be using that equipment for my Security (CCNA/CCNP) and also for my CCNP-RS.  Studying wise, I actually read quite a bit of the Official Cert Guide book, not all 10 million pages, but probably 8.5 million of them.  I worked the labs in that, built my own, and used a lot from our Netacad classes.  I've thought about doing a type of tutor/teaching type thing once I can back it up with degree and certifications, but right now, real life is dealing me a wild hand.  Thanks again!"

ccna,3bylj5,HighGainWiFiAntenna,1 point,Fri Jul 3 07:39:54 2015 UTC,HQ's route back to the BRANCH router was learned dynamically via OSPF. Here are the results of issuing a show ip route command: http://imgur.com/U8EiiiM  I'm not 100% sure if this routing scheme is accurate - so please correct me if I'm wrong! Thanks for looking into it so far.
ccna,3bylj5,Cekuro,1 point,Fri Jul 3 08:14:14 2015 UTC,"Seems like it's okay, HQ has a route back to your PCs, assuming they have a gateway then all should be well.   Although Loopbacks don't respond to any address, just their own so simply pinging the loopback's IP from a PC will determine you have successfully emulated a ""Cloud"" configuration. Although, it's generally better practice to have anything ""external"" not directly created/connected to your edge router, best to set up another router connected to your edge router and have your ISP/Cloud router contain the loopback addresses."
ccna,3bylj5,HighGainWiFiAntenna,1 point,Fri Jul 3 11:38:59 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply, I misunderstood what 'simulating' the cloud was referring to - I assumed the purpose of the step ""configure a default route on HQ that uses the loopback interface to simulate the cloud"" was that all traffic destined for remote networks would be sent to the Lo0 address and a response would be generated as if I was able to contact the external network.  I understand now that Loopbacks will only respond if their IP is pinged."
ccna,3bylj5,HighGainWiFiAntenna,1 point,Fri Jul 3 17:50:44 2015 UTC,"You should post your packet tracer file.  I'm going to address this one piece at a time.    Looking at the show ip route statement from HQ, it seems like you have all your subnets learned (based on looking at your topology).  That's great.  This means that HQ know how to get to each of subnet.   Your ip route statement on Branch router only tells the branch how to bet back to the 209.165.201.16/30 subnet.  (Though this isn't really necessary, as it is directly connected and already in the routing table).   I need the show ip route output of Branch router for complete picture. I need the output of a different show command on HQ to know what interfaces are enabled for the OSPF process.  Is the loopback?     Can you either do a show run and pastebin dump it or zippyshare your PT file?"
ccna,3bylj5,CBRjack,1 point,Fri Jul 3 13:03:23 2015 UTC,"I've uploaded the packet tracer file, it can be found here: http://www12.zippyshare.com/v/FMgPVd5b/file.html  The exact requirements for the practice exam can be found here: http://imgur.com/q5YeMzy  I got up to step 13 (I also made F0/0 on BRANCH passive based on step 15, which technically satisfies the requirement for ""inhibit OSPF updates from being sent to both VLANs"")  Although, I think I may have misunderstood exactly what simulating the cloud meant with regards to the Loopback interface - as someone pointed out Lo0 would only respond if its address was pinged directly. I was under the impression HQ would send all traffic destined for remote networks to the Lo0 interface to simulate a response from said remote server."
ccna,3bylj5,BroadStreet_Bully3,1 point,Fri Jul 3 17:38:00 2015 UTC,"Those are just awful instructions.  I don't know why they want you to send all unknown unicast traffic to the loopback interface like that.  That's dumb.  Why did it have you create a static route when you could just advertise the l0 int via ospf and have it (its ip address) respond to pings from any device on the network, thereby ""simulating"" the internet, meaning it's not an IP address in your network."
ccna,3bwb5t,0010000100111111,2,Thu Jul 2 18:02:52 2015 UTC,"A 1760 is basically 4 VIC/WIC slots and a built in single Fast Ethernet port, right? (Plus Console/Aux).  Make sure you have the right WIC cards: http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/interfaces-modules/wan-interface-cards/index.html  I'm guessing you have something like: http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/collateral/routers/1700-series-modular-access-routers/product_data_sheet09186a00801a9184.html  The T1 WICs have an RJ-45 interface, but it is not a 10/100 port. It just looks like one. It's a Serial interface, with a built in T1 CSU/DSU.   Now the core issue is making t1 interfaces work back-to-back like that. With normal serial WICs you can get a DTE-DCE cable and configure the DCE end with the clock-rate command to fake it, but I don't know if that works with T1s."

ccna,3bwb5t,macbalance,3,Thu Jul 2 19:23:35 2015 UTC,"Yes. (-ish.) The Telco maintains their end, and the hand-off might be as simple as an Rj-45 block on the wall which you cable to your equipment.  T1s are supposed to use dedicated cables (higher quality than Cat5e, differently shielded, I think) but my old work used to run a lot with just Cat5e hand-crimped by me because no one knew any better. Worked fine. T1s are a lot less popular now, which is why you see T1 interfaces available all over the place. (I think I've got a T1 module at home to get rid of...) I'm also near a major city, so there's a lot of options that make a T1 look pretty sad.  As a warning there's also Voice T1s, which use different VWIC modules and terminate voice circuits. That'll cover 24 calls at a time for a company, so one voice T1 can easily handle phones for several times that many users based on actual use. (I.E. for a call center, you want to have enough lines to keep every agent on the phone and not give busy signals to incoming calls. For office workers, expect that only a percentage will be on the phone at any one time, so you don't need as many voice circuits.)  Not useful for data, though, as far as I know."

I think these may in fact be voice T1s because a lot of the config has a lot of voice stuff in it that I am unfamiliar with.  So, essentially I cannot use these WICs to connect the routers together using a fastethernet cable?"
ccna,3bwb5t,Irishman56,2,Thu Jul 2 19:43:53 2015 UTC,"You would need to assemble an RJ-45 rollover or find a pre-wired rollover cable. Wire pins 1/2 and 4/5 to 4/5, 1/2 on the other end.

ccna,3bwb5t,gusgizmo,1 point,Thu Jul 2 20:32:17 2015 UTC,"Hope it works, been a while since I played with them. It should work. Many of these modules are ""Drop and Insert"" capable where you can take a T1 line with say 7 unused DS0 channels and ""insert"" data or voice in these vacant channels. The CO would then sort it all out with what they call DACS cards where they would map the DSO's off to each DSO's destination be it a pbx or another fractional T1 line to another site."
ccna,3bwb5t,HighGainWiFiAntenna,1 point,Thu Jul 2 20:35:51 2015 UTC,"I don't think so. I could, certainly, be wrong though. I hope to be corrected if I am.   The labeling on the interfaces should be different based on voice vs. data. I think the voice ones usually say 'CTRLR T1 0/0' or similar.  The good/bad news is basic serial modules are relatively cheap on ebay. This one should be a Serial with included CSU/DSU while something like this could handle standard serial interfaces... Just make sure you can find the right cables!   I know serial can be run 'back to back' but I'm not sure about T1. I'm hoping someone knows more about that subject."

Most call center jobs are entry level anyway, so don't worry about it sounding simple.  Also, I've found that the following attitude works for me: Maybe I get the job, maybe I don't. Ain't no thing. Maybe they get to hire me, maybe they don't. They should count their stars if they're able to offer me a good enough job.   Of course, this is easier said than done, especially if you have a dead end job, but I think it's a good thing being confident (though not cocky)."

ccna,3bt250,bamajager,7,Thu Jul 2 03:04:21 2015 UTC,"That's exactly how I felt- I wanted to go into that test with lots of confidence.  Not only did I want to avoid paying to fail it; I had a lot of street cred riding on it. I've setup lots of complex networks and am the technology director for my company now and was the CTO for an MSP.  Needless to say I didn't want to fail in front of my peers (I'm not ashamed to say pride was on the line).  As far as tips for another veteran - make yourself study the stuff you already feel you have down pat.  Don't skimp on studying seemingly old technology (10 MBps, 100 MBps half duplex), T1, modems, classful subnetting, etc...  Even if you're sure you know it I guarantee you'll remember stuff you forgot or will learn something new. Recall which protocols operate in which OSI layers.  If you watch videos, use multiple sources (I forgot to mention I also watched the free Andrew Crauthammel CCNA series on YouTube).  Three sources of video gives you lots of overlap but do it anyway to fill gaps.  Use GNS3 and Packet Tracer if you have it to supplement real gear. Do your labs more than once to the point you don't have to think hard about what you're doing and know why you're doing every command.  Most of all the best tip I got during my lessons came from Jeremy Ciora at CBT nuggets- study with the goal of teaching the material to a protégé.  It will make you step up your game if you think you have to explain it to someone and be ready to answer their questions.  As far as specific areas to concentrate on. Know subnetting, route summarization, spanning tree election process, and ACL's down COLD.  All in all I probably dedicated 120 hours to studying and practicing. I got to where I was acing practice tests from multiple sources (many practice tests are MUCH harder than the real exam- wish I knew at the time).  If you find yourself memorizing thr answers to your practice tests, which only have so many questions, just slow down and make sure you're thinking about why the right answer is the right answer.  If you can do well on the Pearson Measure Up, CCNA For Dummies and tests that come with the Odom books you will cut through the real test like a hot knife through butter.  Good luck- let us know how it goes!"

Regardless of if the route is a static route or learned via dynamic routing protocol, the route with the longest matching prefix is used. E.g., if there's a route matching 192.168.0.0/16, but also a route for 192.168.10.0/24, traffic destined to 192.168.10.15 would use the 192.168.10.0/24 route.  If you have two routes with an equal prefix, then the router looks to the AD (administrative distance)  'Normal conditions' being where something like policy-routing is not in use, as policy-routing can override the routing table."
ccna,3bv8z4,chuckbales,1 point,Thu Jul 2 12:58:48 2015 UTC,"Administrative distance:       Administrative distance (AD) is an arbitrary numerical value assigned to a routing protocol, a static route or a directly-connected route based on its perceived quality of routing. The administrative distance (AD) value is often used by Cisco routers to determine the ""best"" route that should be used when multiple paths to the same destination exist.  A routing protocol with a lower administrative distance is considered ""better"" and is given priority over routing protocols with higher administrative distances.  The ""better"" route is selected by the router and is inserted into the router's routing table to be used to route traffic. For example, routes issued by EIGRP are considered more reliable than routes issued by RIP. This is because EIGRP has an administrative distance of 90 while RIP has an administrative distance of 120. The administrative distance (AD) value may be set manually by a network administrator. If a network administrator fails to properly set the administrative distance or configures multiple routing protocols with the same administrative distance, the router will use the default administrative distance.

This was my first job as a Net Admin, but there are several net admins in our department all with the same title for some reason (even my supervisor). I basically handle the grunt work (port moves, rack installs, vlan changes, web filter requests, workstation setups, password resets, etc...), but I'm learning the harder stuff all the while. You basically have to go to work for a company that has the need for more than one net admin, and is willing to give you the title. You would probably need at least 6 months to a year of experience if you don't have a degree already. IT is one of those rare fields where anything goes pretty much. I know guys with twice my experience who are stuck doing helpdesk and desktop support still. You have to be willing to put yourself out there and keep applying even if you get rejected."

I got the parts cut to make a mini-6u rack by buying a set of rails off Amazon (about $10) and making a simple box with some scraps from a home project to make a small rack I can put on existing shelves. All it needs to hold is a power strip, a router, and maybe a NAS I have.  I've got some rack cases from SKB for my 'primary' stuff, but want to move the NAS and such away for various reasons (for disaster recovery, it makes sense to have some separation between the NAS and the machines it backs up, even if its only a few feet...) The SKB  'musician' racks are a good choice. Shipping-grade (so you don't need to box them up to move them if you don't want) and can be closed up if you want to keep fingers out of the rack when you're not using it. I would recommend putting some spacers between them if you want to be able to put the doors on when they're stacked, though."

Syslog is absolutely the way to go.   SNMP traps can do a lot of the same stuff but can also do some different. For example, I have my switches configured to send an SNMP trap to the server if a user enter's config mode on a switch. Once the SNMP server spots that specific message, it sends an email out to me with the details.  Some companies may also just not want to spend the extra cash for both an SNMP trap server and a syslog server (not to mention software and licensing etc), so in that sense it is nice they have overlap in some of the areas."

If you get any questions about how many hosts just figure out how many bits you need to reach that number.  You can use 2 raised to the 8th as your base to avoid calculators. 28 = 256.  If I have 8 host bits each subnet will have 256 hosts. 9 bits = 512, 10 bits = 1,024, 11 bits = 2,048, 12 bits = 4,096, 13 bits = 8,192, 14 bits = 16,384, 15 bits = 32,768, 16 bits = 65,535, 17 bits = 137,072 and 18 bits = 262,144.

I feel like most Cisco exams stick to /16s and higher, probably because they figure if you can't do the math for that, you probably don't get the concept which is more important than the arithmetic.  If you get a tough question, sometimes you can also short-circuit it by thinking through the logic to eliminate 3 of 4 answers. For example, your example is reasonably easy:    It's a /10, which means 32-10 bits for the host part. (22) 222 -2 is the host calcualtion. 222 is the tricky bit. Powers of 2 are annoying but doable. Start at the edge of the paper and just start doubling:  2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024,  2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576 2097152, 4194304 Subtract 2 from the ending number: 4194304 -2 = 4194302   That does take a while. I'd be very surprised to see that on a Cisco exam but I can't say they wouldn't do it. it's a fair question, just an obnoxious one.

Will then want to do the same for charting from Column F where it shows the Mask, bits borrowed, increment, etc to Row N.    By using this chart, things get easy, for me at least.  Say someone gave you an IP of 10.10.0.5 with a netmask of /28 or 255.255.255.240.  You can basically use these bits an pieces of info to see what is referenced.  A /28 IS a.240 mask.  Looking at the /28 or 240 area under column J shows an increment to work with of 8.  Therefore your network here is 10.10.10.0-7  .5 is the host. .0 is the network ID .7 is the broadcast."

I'm expecting it won't take as much effort for the Ccna security compared to Ccnp and I'll get that under my belt then when I go for the Ccnp it will renew that certification for me.

As an example, I'm extremely quick to learn stuff around IT and networking. I studied for two weeks then passed my CCNA. I had one year experience, 6 years ago. Then I studied for 5 days and got my BCNE. I'm passing my BCNP exam tonight after studying for a month and a half, and I expect to pass my CCNP before december.  But I tried to learn German for two whole years, and I can say ""Das ist brot"" (This is bread)... And that's pretty much all I can remember. When I see people that can talk 17 languages, I have no idea how they do it.  Don't stress over speed, there will always be someone faster than you. As long as you learn and you get certified, your experience willmatter much more to an employer than the time it took to get the cert."

In searching, I found this depressing nugget:   http://www.networkworld.com/article/2229719/cisco-subnet/brocade-bcne-most-valuable-cert-on-earth.html  Are those numbers still accurate. Ccie $120k?  And a freaking juniper low level rolling at $95k?   You know why I picked Cisco?  A year ago I searched for best certs to have to be a net engineer. Cisco landed on top. So I went that route. (And switch)   Should I be in /r/juniper or /r/brocade"
ccna,3bi5ln,HighGainWiFiAntenna,3,Mon Jun 29 23:44:51 2015 UTC,"I do believe they put every manager and salesman because that is not a real world salary fro BCNE... The BCNE exam is a bit simpler than CCNA, definetely an easy pass if you read the BCNE in a Nutshell document. Go for it if you want, the cert doesn't expire.  Juniper is very sought after these days. I had to go for Brocade because of work, but I'm looking at the JNCIA in the near future. Juniper is getting a strong foothold with powerful devices at half the price of Cisco, and clients want certified engineers. It's a great value.  Also, CCIE is god-like status for.most employers... Others cert don't have the mystical aura around them, but for IT managers, they will know the JNCIE is at the same level."
ccna,3bi5ln,CBRjack,2,Tue Jun 30 00:16:15 2015 UTC,"I think Cisco is slow to release their product and expensive, but the ASICs in their switches and the propriety elements they add to routing protocols make them a game changer in my opinion.

The closest thing to a server I ever got was running apache2triad on Windows to have a testing environment for a website I was running. I'd played around on my home router, and discovered a few neat tricks, but nothing impressive.   It took me thirteen months to get my ccna in, and I spent those thirteen months breathing cisco. It wasn't some overnight process. It took me a while to really understand things like subnetting and acls(and this one I still need a LOT of practice on.) take your time. Don't worry about how someone else did it, or why they could without experience. Focus on how you're going to do it. Spend time on each chapter. Fall in love(and hate) with each concept. Read a chapter, and then read a Wikipedia page about that topic. Then do some labs. Ask questions about the topics.   You can do this stuff man."

I'm studying ICND2 now, and everything i read in Wendell Odom i test in packet tracer. If i see i diagram with addresses and config commands, i set it up in packet tracer. I remember first learning ""conf t"" and wondering ""how am i going to remember this?"" Now i type it in the terminal at least 20x day while labbing. Similarly, other concepts such as static routes, routing protocols, trunks etc become second nature, since doing them repeatedly to set up labs for more advanced topics in the book.   Everything builds on itself, and drives into memory. It seems only the newest and most unfamilar topic is challenging anymore. Even now knowing my weak points, I'll take a break from ""studying"" and say ""i need a refresher on ACL's"" and i'll see how far i can get through memory before referring to documentation."
ccna,3bhtf3,Coldpawz,3,Mon Jun 29 09:53:25 2015 UTC,You might get one simple question on an exam about cabling but I wouldn't count too much on cabling. Maybe something concerning the dce and dte ends of a serial cable and what end you need to configure clock speed on.

ccna,3bhtf3,macbalance,2,Mon Jun 29 14:33:31 2015 UTC,You will not need to know the different fiber connectors. You should know the various serial connectors. You should also know how a crossover cable is made and when/where it should be used.

You have to know some ridiculously high level and low level stuff about networking to get through CCNA.  Part of the reason I didn't do it was that I didn't want to be that much more valuable as a network guy than a generalist; I know it's flawed thinking...

Your time is already more valuable than that, and you need to exercise some patience picking the 'right' starting job to get experience.  You will be wasting your time on a help desk; you will not be interacting with the tech you already know for 5+ years going that route.  Start at minimum as a Jr. Network Admin or Jr. Network Engineer.  I skipped my BS, didn't do any certs, and spent 2 years working as desktop before I got my sysadmin/sysengi title.  Your degree and certs let you skip to the front of the line.  That being said, if I had no experience, still no degree, and a CCNA, the entry level for that in my area is 55-65k. You can probably do slightly better with your plethora of credentials, but not much more; CCNA is a pretty specific career path where they want you to take over their Cisco network and not do much else, so the rest of your exp is worth less."

I've been working the same large environment for about 6+ years now  As hawk said, I think learning even a little bit of programming is probably a good idea for anyone who works in IT, if nothing else than to learn about what's going on under the hood of all these tools we use.  Scripting languages like perl, python, tcl are particularly handy for data networking because most of us still interact with our network devices via text, which these languages handle really really well.  You ssh to a device to enter text commands or you look at a text config.  So you can do things along those lines with scripts, like poll a list of devices looking for certain text in the config, or push out config changes.  There are 101 other ways to do some of these actions now though, so YMMV as far as how useful you will find it in that regard.  Some people will tell you it's worth learning it for SDN, but honestly that has so far to go before it's widely adopted that no one really knows what it's going to look like when the dust settles and we have clear winners in that market."

Today I learned how to query SolarWinds Orion SQL database for report automation (pymssql).  I completely automated one of my soul sucking reports in Excel; what once took an hour now takes about 5 seconds (xlsxwriter).  I've also written a script to restart ports that have wireless APs on them based on the site (Paramiko) and (getpass).  Coincidental, Kirk Byers recently sent out an email on CiscoConParse, which ""helps you parse Cisco hierarchical configurations.""    I'm still at the beginning of my learning curve but yes, it is totally worth learning.  Once you crack open your imagination and start automating some of your more mundane tasks you will begin looking for ways to leverage Python all over the place.

I've set up some APs (and my home gear, of course... Even had an Apple Airport Base Station (the flying saucer one) when they were a new thing. Even done some low-end surveys to help a local library system with a wireless rollout. Didn't have to deal with a lot of the details.  There's a lot in the early chapters discussing how radio works that will be mostly new to me. It does feel like a good foundation to understand how signal strength really works. No real 'practical' lab stuff until chapter 10 or so!  The foundation stuff is certainly useful career-wise. Placing APs is definitely a skill, especially if you're going from a relatively open office to a factory, warehouse, etc. that might have steel radar-absorbing shelves and such. Even with Cisco moving to different infrastructure (and other companies being pretty strong in wireless) there's no reason to not learn the basics."
ccna,3b7kc7,thesesimplewords,1 point,Wed Jul 1 14:12:29 2015 UTC,"Done the exam couple of weeks ago.  Its not hard. The problem is they ask very stupid questions. Alot of it has to do with memorising. For example, they will ask a question like: where do you click to go to a particular section in the WCS  Minimal on radio theory and math Authentication/guest ssid etc one or two questions. Alot of it is on WCS.  CCNA wireless introduces you to a management software called WCS which is obsolete. I believe the s/w used now is called CISCO PI. Doesn't really matter because they both essentially do the same thing. PI has more bells and whistles. I attended the cisco conference in San Diego, and it was hinted that the exam may be revised near the end of the year since alot of people were complaining about the questions asked.  Home lab - couple of acecss points, a controller and a  layer 3 switch plus some gigabit interfaces called sfp's. If you need more help PM me  I've heard CWNA is a very good certification to have and is vendor neutral. If I was in your position I would do CWNA. Build a good solid base. Then move onto ccna wireless. By then, they may have changed the exam and improved it. Not sure how much practical is in the CWNA as I have just started studying it. There is some practical in ccna wireless, but not nearly as much as CCNA r/s. Basically, you do the ccna wireless to familarise yourself with cisco equipment.   Once you do the CWNA, you can do the ccna wireless in a couple of months."
ccna,3b7kc7,HighGainWiFiAntenna,2,Tue Jul 7 09:19:59 2015 UTC,"I didn't want to post a top level comment about the CWNP organization, but I'll piggyback off this.  I got my CWTS (Technical Specialist, an entry level exam) last year which got my foot in the door to some networking positions.  I found it to be a really good test.  On most exams you have to answer questions the way you think they would want you do, even if that isn't a real-world answer.  I didn't have that problem on this one as much.  I'll be looking at the CWNA eventually.  I've already got the book and flipped through it a bit.  In my circles it is very common for a network to have an entirely Cisco backbone infrastructure and have another vendor just for wireless (Aruba, Meru, Aerohive, Ruckus, etc), so I think that's a good argument to go vendor neutral.  edit: added the last part about vendors."
ccna,3b7kc7,junglizer,1 point,Thu Jul 9 17:33:59 2015 UTC,"Thanks. I will check out CWNA.  I've worked on the WCS rig. Didn't do setup, but put my site in and such. I hope they kept the good parts in Cisco Prime.   My 'lab' right now has an 1811w I am trying to decide to keep for this or just use to see if I can get better coverage for my townhouse. Leaning towards the later, replacing the standard (and old) FiOS router built-in wireless. Dual antennas, tunable, etc.   I'll look at the CWNA, as it does look like it covers a lot of the same subjects, just not vendor-specific."
ccna,3b7kc7,suren130,0,Tue Jul 7 11:49:54 2015 UTC,"Depends if you want to do the LWAP or a stand alone AP.   For LWAP, you're looking at one or more AP, the wireless controller, and at least one managed switch. You'll probably need more like 3 switches and 3 AP to really do it right. (Got to cover each major wireless channel).   For stand alone. Well. That's at least one AP and one switch.   Then ask yourself how you test your wireless gear. You need lots of wireless devices. At least one for each subnet. Got a phone / iPad / iPod / laptop?  That should do it. You need at least two devices that aren't your PC.   Ok. Well now you are set with your $1000 worth of gear. (Bottom end estimate). Throw down $50 for the OCG, another $50 for some helpful videos and $250 for the exam. Then ask yourself why you aren't doing SEC track or CCNP.   I hate to say it, because I see Cisco wireless gear everywhere. I just don't think the time and invested capital are worth it. It's not going to get you further ahead.   I'm not sure how much can be done in Packet Tracer. I don't know if it supports the Wireless manager. It does have AP, but I don't know if they are managed or just dummies.   I'd skipped this track unless you have a company specifically asking for it. Invest your time and dollars in security or move up to ccnp.   I know it's tempting because you only need a CCENT to start wireless track.   Edit: the ccent comment was for anyone else reading. I know you have your ccna.   Looked in packet tracer 6.2. You can create generic wireless devices. You can't do Cisco unified wireless. You can do Cisco Stand alone AP.   This means you either need to get gear or hope you can learn without practice. I am reaffirming my statement that this seems like a huge invest of capital with diminishing returns."
ccna,3b6g0w,jupeepamintuan,2,Fri Jun 26 10:26:16 2015 UTC,"Yes. With the exception of some edge cases, every device that has an interface with an IP Address needs to send a packet to another device on the same subnet, it needs to ARP to resolve it to a MAC Address if it does not have a cached entry.  In the situation where two routers are directly connected via ethernet, they will still ARP. The ethernet broadcast domain is just really small, but the same principle applies."
ccna,3b6g0w,100BASE-TX,1 point,Fri Jun 26 10:37:02 2015 UTC,Interesting.  The ICND1 books I've studied are curiously silent on routers arping other routers.
ccna,3b6g0w,I_will_have_you_CCNA,1 point,Fri Jun 26 14:01:19 2015 UTC,"Well, whether they are direct-connected or switched, they still need to forward frames (L2).   If one router needs to send data to another router, it isn't magic. If they are directly connected by a single link(or across a L2 switch, same thing) they still need to convert their IP addresses to a MAC push Ethernet Frames out to a specific interface. Even if the interface is right friggin' there."
ccna,3b6g0w,Salamander014,1 point,Fri Jun 26 14:39:37 2015 UTC,So are the routers sending packets between them or frames?
ccna,3b6g0w,I_will_have_you_CCNA,1 point,Fri Jun 26 14:48:03 2015 UTC,"Packets are encapsulated in frames in order to be put on the wire.  All Packets. Every last one that ever was, or will be.  If RouterA says I have packets destined to this 1.2.3.4 and my neighbor RouterB at IP 5.6.7.8 announced that, I'll send this packet to the 1.2.3.4 through the interface connected to 5.6.7.8, and that interface Arps for 5.6.7.8, and the other end says I have that MAC address, and RouterA sends a frame out interface 2 that has the packet in it. Router B unpacks the frame and looks at the Packet, and if it isn't meant for RouterB, RouterB will say I know which interface this needs to go out on, because I announced the route, and it'll ARP for next HOP IP that it's still destined for until the Packet gets to the destination IP address.  ARP is only on a subnet basis. It says hey I'm looking for this next HOP IP, how do I get there, and whoever has that IP says here encapsulate that Packet into a frame marked for THIS MAC address, and it sends it along, get's unpacked, and the IP is read and figured out where to push it next. Repeat process."

ccna,3b35qy,DarthKane1978,1 point,Thu Jun 25 18:12:36 2015 UTC,"Copy Pasta  ✦ Shutdown: If you specify shutdown as the action upon violation, the switch disables the port when an unauthorized system connects to the port.  ✦ Protect: The action of protect sends an alert to an administrator if a frame is received on the port from an unauthorized system.  ✦ Restrict: The final option for action is a pretty cool setting, and that option is to set the action to restrict. When the action is set to restrict, the switch allows frames from only the specified MAC address to enter the network. This means that the port will work as long as the correct system is plugged into the port, but the second an unauthorized system is plugged into the port, the switch no longer forwards the frames."

Consider the difference between CCNA, which is controlled by a single company, and medical boards which are state/country-regulated I believe.  It's still an achievement, though, and those other two professions are very dependent on good techs.   Although I hear support for hospitals can be pretty terrible.

My question centers around the perception that most people have NO idea what this stuff is or how complex it can be.  None.  Doctors and lawyers were used as examples because everyone knows what they do and what's involved.  I don't know where programming falls along the spectrum of hardest professions, but I've done it before, and I've actually found that easier than Cisco stuff, but again, programmers are, in my opinion, well respected in terms of there being appreciation for the difficulty of what they do."

Folks who just get a CCENT or CCNA then go to work are closer to nurses, LPNs, physician assistants, paralegals, etc.  and, unfortunately, those people get stomped on by the 'higher ups' all the time.

ccna,3b1pnc,jupeepamintuan,6,Thu Jun 25 07:41:51 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately, the CCNA is no longer a gauge on networking knowledge. Someone with a CCNA is pretty much a NOC technician. Any kind of Network Admin or Network Engineer and you are looking at a minimum of a CCNP. A CCNA gives you a general understanding of networking, but doesn't give you the in depth knowledge you will need.   My suggestion for you is to look into ISPs. Most of the time, they have multiple network admins and are usually looking for fresh blood to move up through the ranks. You will have a very hard time finding an enterprise level position with nothing more than a CCNA. Most of the time, these types of environments have 1 or 2 overworked Network Admins who don't have time to train someone."

ccna,3b1pnc,HighGainWiFiAntenna,4,Thu Jun 25 15:59:12 2015 UTC,I don't think this would make any difference with no experience.  In fact i think it would make most employers think you used braindumps.
ccna,3b1pnc,Ceryn,1 point,Thu Jun 25 16:16:13 2015 UTC,"I've certainly heard it both ways.   The thing is, almost any job is going to have a technical skills or technical questions.  People post about that at least once a week. You may be able to brain dump to CCNP (I can't fathom it, having recently say a ccnp exam), but you can't fake an interview or fake a skills tests.   And I get that everyone worries about brain dumps devaluing the certs as a whole. It's easy to prove otherwise. Scoring perhaps. Even the dates which you achieved each cert or test.   I've thought a lot about this. Employers aren't stupid. They can easily imagine a situation where someone has certs but doesn't have the experience. It's tough Economic times since 2007.   Experience trumps all. Agreed. Ccnp no work experience doesn't mean you cheated."
ccna,3b1pnc,HighGainWiFiAntenna,-1,Thu Jun 25 17:07:43 2015 UTC,I just wanted to follow up my previous post.   This thought of cheating to ccnp doesn't sit well with me. I can't imagine how it's possible. I suppose people can cheat at anything if they want to badly enough. I'm sure there are dumps for ccie.   I would think an employer Might think more about brain dumps when someone walks in with their trifecta collection of Comptia certs.
ccna,3b1pnc,HighGainWiFiAntenna,2,Thu Jun 25 17:18:26 2015 UTC,"It is definitely a good thing to work toward. CCNA is kind of a generalized cert right now. It's the new A+ / Net+. So many people are getting it that it doesn't differentiate you in anyway.   A CCNP on the other hand, you have to have legitimate working knowledge of complex routing and switching environments to get. If you can't get a job and still want to be in networking, the most logical course would be to pursue your CCNP."
ccna,3b1pnc,jdbilodeau,1 point,Thu Jun 25 17:06:26 2015 UTC,"A CCNP with no experience is kind of useless. I've heard that it's better to branch out and get more CCNAs (security, wirelesss, voice, etc). That way you can apply for more types of entry level positions.   Also most people go down the R & S path which means if you get other certs you have less competition (for CCIEs couldn't find one for CCNA)"
ccna,3b1pnc,Yoloswag69lastking,1 point,Thu Jun 25 16:53:17 2015 UTC,"Most people go down the R&S path because the R&S is prerequisite for a lot of other certs.   And this is the age old debate in the Cisco world. What is worth more, many CCNA or one CCNP. I've read articles and opinions and posts. Even Odom's got a post on it. There is no way to measure it truly. Too many variables.   This much I'm confident is true. The only CCNA (other than R&S) worth a damn is security. CCDA and wireless get no love at all and don't open any new doors. Video can literally be had in about five days. Voice (and now collab) has some value, but without the relevant R&S experience, it doesn't matter. At some point your voice packets are hitting my switch and router. And if I didn't bother to trunk my port or enable dot1p or decided to turn off cdp on that interface, you're out of luck.   Security will open doors because it necessary and cogent for our society today. (And yes I know service provider / data center is useful, but that's very specific. It's not broad based, and is an employer looking for something specific).   Then if you look at the ccnp sec track, you need at least CCNA AND CCNA sec, plus ccnp route and four other exams just to get ccnp sec.   So what's really worth more?  I have no idea. However, just because I can't find a job with my CCNA doesn't mean I'm not going to sit my ccnp exams because I don't have work experience. That's silly. It's irritating to see people repeatedly post that, because there are just as many posts of people saying that ccnp (with no experience) opened doors for them. It's all about right place / right time."
ccna,3b1pnc,HighGainWiFiAntenna,3,Thu Jun 25 17:16:32 2015 UTC,"This is always the catch 22 situation with getting your foot into the door. Cant get a job without experience and cant get experience without a job.  Don't give up on your search for entry level positions. As long as you can demonstrate that you're knowledgeable, proficient and motivated than I'm sure you'll find someone who will be willing to give you a shot.  At your level it is quite common for people to give you an opportunity because they feel that they can ""mold"" you into what they need.

I'd write down every network scenario, managerial request, or problem I could think of, and detail your solution to it in expert fasion.  Send this along, in addition to your resume, and let them know that in an interview situation you could explain this or any other network scenario they could throw at you in an interview.  Choose a job you really want, and be persistent.  Follow up every week.  Start a Cisco/Networking blog and demonstrate your expertise that way.  The other alternative is to start your own consulting business: don't wait for them to pick you, pick yourself.  Finally, be awesome in interviews.  I'm talking top 5% of all the people they talk to in terms of confidence, articulation, preparedness, and projecting a strong persona.

If you have a lot of practical experience than studying the official cert guides and taking the composite exam (1 test route) may work out for you.  If you are relatively new to networking than the 2 exam route ;)

ccna,3azpqz,arming10,5,Wed Jun 24 20:20:35 2015 UTC,"Check this out. http://computer.howstuffworks.com/dns.htm basically the host sends the dns request directly to the dns server in the enterprise network. If it cannot resolve the request it will look to 'forwarders' aka other dns servers. If they can't resolve the request it will time out and the name won't resolve resulting in the host being unable to find what it was looking for. Have a look at DHCP leases, DNS servers, root hints, and DNS forwarders."
ccna,3azpqz,strikesbac,2,Wed Jun 24 21:03:25 2015 UTC,That literally is an amazing diagram. So basically it will ask the dns first to resolve it first then it will send it to the router. That makes sense thanks.
ccna,3azpqz,strikesbac,4,Wed Jun 24 21:05:20 2015 UTC,"Almost, it won't ask the router though. The host will ask the enterprise DNS server. If that server can't answer then the server (not the host) will ask another DNS server (which may not be in the enterprise network) for the answer. If it can't answer then the look up fails.   Are you thinking about DNS from your setup at home? I Imagine that you might see your router listed as your DNS server here. In enterprise networks this wouldn't happen.  In an enterprise environment the router is just a router it's not a DNS server. Whilst at home your router does more eg dhcp, dns, firewalling, etc."

R1 and R2 have NM-HD-2V each with VIC2-FXO and VIC-4FXS along with VWIC-1MFT-T1-V2 and PVDM2-64.  R3 has NME-AIR-WLC8 running 7.0 so you have the ability to configure a WLC via command line.  R4 and R5 have WIC-1AM-V2 in slot 2 for dial up simulations.  I really need to get around to getting another developer build a new schedule portal as the one currently used is pretty outdated but still works none the less.

Edit: After seeing http://www.freeccnaworkbook.com/about I think it's safe to assume its you :)  I just wanted to drop a line and say a VERY profound thank you for everything you've done on that website. With the help of your guides (and extensive googling for basic networking philosophies/procedures) I was able to grow my homelab from a simple pfSense Router to 3 2851s, various layer 2 switches, vlans galore, and a firm understanding of basic routing and switching.   I literally had no idea what the difference was between a Layer 2 and Layer 3 switch before freeccnaworkbook.com [mind you this was 8 months ago]  I had no idea what BGP was (or how it worked), what OSPF was, or even what a basic route-map was. I just knew they existed and they worked because various netadmins I've dealt with in the past knew what they were doing.  With the help of your website and my CCNA Workbook, I'll hopefully be one of those 'netadmins that knew what they were doing' within the next year :')  Cheers to you, /u/ccie38216 - you're the real MVP here. I use your website frequently (and by frequently I usually mean 2-3x a week as a reference), and I've got 3 other friends trying to get into networking that I've referred to your website. I've sworn up and down by this website to them, and they're advancing quite nicely with their learning.   P.S. I haven't checked any other guides on the website as I'm no where near ready to get out of the CCNA realm, but a quick BGP write-up would be awesome (and I'd be more than happy to write up a guide on using it - I think it would be helpful to newbies everywhere, and I feel as though not contributing back to what you've given me would be wrong.)"

If home is too much of a distraction, go to the library early, find a table and crank out a full 8 hours, make sure you get a lunch break in there. Don't forget to turn off your phone ;) Go look at how much Network Engineers make and that should motivate you. Good Luck bro."
ccna,3ax5d2,popz2049,8,Wed Jun 24 18:55:44 2015 UTC,"I would consider getting a job in any field right now and studying part time on the side.  Set realistic goals so you can learn the material and become a network engineer and not just certified which is useless without the knowledge and experience that the CCNA just validates.  I'm pretty sure you will fail a technical interview if you are just cheating and even if you managed to land a job, you would be found out fairly quick.  Passing this test is not going to solve your more pressing problems, namely the anxiety, the lack of accountability and transparency.  I would suggest that you have a very open and candid conversation with your parents about who you are and what's going on.  Keeping everything hidden leads to situations like this.  You can have success starting today if you create transparency with your friends and family, establish boundaries for yourself, and setup accountability through your relationships.  We are all weak people and need systems like these to help us succeed.  Best of luck to you brother."

You know that cheating is a short term solution with consequences. What you need now is structure in your life. You don't have a job or something to keep you focused. Even a part time job is going to help pull you out of this valley! As human beings we are meant to work, it fulfills a critical part of our needs and well-being.  Maybe you'll make a friend and get distracted from the studying for awhile. If you've scheduled the test that's fine. People fail that test all the time! Go take it just to see what's on the exam. Few people get that luxury. :) If your parents paid for it offer to pay them back this year.  Once you get more organized and start to find something productive to do with your time you can spend the cycles thinking about what your next career steps should be in life. Sometimes we try to rush things before we're ready. This is normal and its part of growing up in life. You have to know when to apply the brakes and take things a step at a time.

I have completed my CCNA last year and it took approx. 6 months for my fresh mind (as i am from  Electronics background). But i did it really hard and without cheating. Then i left home in search of networking Job and Land up to this silicon valley of India and Joined a Tech Support job (Non IT/Networking). I Thought i can work and prepare for CCNP, but i failed and after 10 months again realized that this was not the job i ever wanted.  I quit that job in feb and went to home for months. Thought and talked with parents , now as they said okay, i have enrolled myself for CCIE in this Institute and attending classes 5 days a week. Unfortunately I also found myself lost in /r/GW and /r/GWAudio (Lets say no to Porn)  too much recently and missing that passion i had at the time of CCNA. I used to watch video tutorial several times a day.   TBH my english is also not that good and I will be working on that too, I have took this step from today onwards that I will be working hard and wont give a fuck to Porn or anything time wasting again. I also think we can skype or talk about it as I am surely going to start my studies again. I have to refresh my CCNA as well coz its a long time back I had that on top of my head. And as i did it seriously its refreshing sooner then i expected.   Take a break for a day from everything and spend it with your parents, tell your mom/dad at least one of them that you are going to reschedule it. And ofc they will understand what you are going through. You can finish all of it in 30days + take 15days for extreme revision, and this will be easy if you have done at least something during your fapping days. If not, add days accordingly.   We all are here with you, some can even join studying with you. Wish you best of luck. And have a good day there."

For easier understanding by humans, the IPv4 address is divided in 4 blocks, each block 8 bits. The same is valid for the IPv6 but because it's bigger, it's been decided to divide it in 8 blocks, 16 bits each. So now you have:   IPv4 address 8bits.8bits.8bits.8bits IPv6 address 16bits:16bits:16bits:16bits:16bits:16bit:16bits:16bits   8bits translated from binary to decimal is a number from 0 to 255. It's easy to remember 4 numbers in that range. However 16bits is quite big range of numbers, in decimal 0 - 65535. It will be really hard to remember 8 numbers in that range.  So it's been decided to divide a 16 bit block in 4 characters but instead translated to decimal, they're translated to hexadecimal. So each character is 4 bits - from binary to hexadecimal 0-F (0-9, A-F). 4 characters, 4 bits each makes 16 bits block.  Hope I explained it properly."

ccna,3atrcv,jibuu,14,Tue Jun 23 13:11:17 2015 UTC,It is safe. You can't have more than one interface/sub-interface in the same subnet on a router.
ccna,3atrcv,PsychoMet,0,Tue Jun 23 13:19:42 2015 UTC,"/u/psychomet has it right.   That's also a class c private address. While it can have a mask of any length, they generally have a /24 or higher. With any mask of /24 or higher, those subnet ranges would not overlap each other.   On the off chance that your address space is something like 192.168.1.x /16 ask yourself why you're making things needless harder on yourself. Cisco likes to throw curb balls in exams, but I've never seen anything that mean."
ccna,3atrcv,HighGainWiFiAntenna,5,Tue Jun 23 13:40:35 2015 UTC,"That's also a class c    NOOOOO - we don't use classes anymore, everything is classless - you even followed it up mentioning variable length mask and CIDR notation. And using the reasoning of ""192.168.x.x probably doesn't use that netmask"" is just bad logic.   curb balls    Curve ball."
ccna,3atrcv,chuckbales,1 point,Tue Jun 23 13:48:16 2015 UTC,"I mentioned that it LIKELY won't have that mask. It is unlikely to see a private class c address with anything less than a /24 mask. That's silly. If you need more subnets or hosts, change to the 172 private range. It's totally logical.   Now what you said is completely true for PUBLIC address space ranges. It would be bad to assume the mask.   Class is very important. It's difficult to really grasp vlsm or route summarization if you don't understand class. Class alone gives you the Jump off point to summarize several addresses.      While I can totally appreciate what you're saying, this is /r/CCNA and the question was a hand drawn image file. Between those two things, it's better to answer the question on the level of the poster rather on the level of a senior network engineer. High level overview.   Plus, as I'm sure you know, when you dig into CCNP and even the CCDA (and other design tracks) that Cisco's recommendation is to use a /24 mask for VLAN subnet range space. And there wouldn't be a a reason to have those subinterfaces on a router unless he were ROAS and therefore, by definition, using vlans. Just saying."
ccna,3atrcv,HighGainWiFiAntenna,-2,Tue Jun 23 15:11:54 2015 UTC,Sometimes the questions are so hard they kick you to the curb. Curb balls. Then you have to start over.
ccna,3atrcv,HighGainWiFiAntenna,2,Tue Jun 23 15:00:28 2015 UTC,I'm just extra careful and consider any possibility. So what /u/psychomet is saying is that IOS won't allow two interfaces/subinterfaces to be configured with the same subnet as another interface/subinterface?

ccna,3asbga,arming10,5,Tue Jun 23 02:50:56 2015 UTC,ABR are just routers that belong to more than one area.   They maintain a link state database for each interface in the areas they belong to.  One interface sits in area0 to route for the ospf  backbone.
ccna,3asbga,bokin,2,Tue Jun 23 03:07:09 2015 UTC,Okay cool can other areas talk to each other?
ccna,3asbga,Kaligraphic,3,Tue Jun 23 03:36:49 2015 UTC,"In OSPF, area 0 is your backbone area. All other areas have to connect to it, and inter-area routing will go through it. Also, ABRs don't give each area full details about other areas they're connected to. Each area gets summary LSAs for the others. It's not like area 12 really needs the full topography of area 47, after all.  (Technically, you can set up a virtual link to cross an area, in order to deal with a physical topography that doesn't match the logical requirement, but it will routing-wise be treated as a point-to-point link. Logically, every area will still connect to area 0.)"
ccna,3asbga,CBRjack,1 point,Tue Jun 23 04:47:32 2015 UTC,"A router running OSPF has to have a database of all the links in the area. This would become too large if you could only have 1 area.  To solve the problem, OSPF can have multiple areas. An ABR is a router with interfaces in two (or more) areas.  They allow routes to be distributed in an area as a summary. Routes has to come from area 0, or another area via area 0 (1 to 0 to 2 is fine, 1 to 2 doesn't work).  The ABR sends a list of all the routes he learned inside his areas. This way, routers in the area don't have to know about all the links, just that they can reach it via the ABR."

ccna,3aq0bg,I_will_have_you_CCNA,1 point,Tue Jun 23 03:21:16 2015 UTC,No joke the CCNA was definitely the hardest test I've ever took. My study schedule was 3-4 hours a day during the week and 12-16 hours on the weekend.
ccna,3aq0bg,I_will_have_you_CCNA,2,Mon Jun 22 20:33:05 2015 UTC,3-4 hours per weekday and 12-16 hours per weekend day? How? Do you not have a family or social life?  Congrats on the pass regardless!
ccna,3aq0bg,CannibalAngel,2,Tue Jun 23 02:21:17 2015 UTC,"Not per weekend day, no. Typically most week days I saved 5-9 for study time.On weekends I usually split my day in half. I'm used to getting up around 6:30-7 am so this plan worked out great. Either I studied from 8am-2pm or Noon - 6.  I'd be liar if I said I followed that regiment to a T. Most Friday nights and Sunday nights was going out / movies / TV / games.   The weird part to me is, I've never been a ""good"" student. I never studied or took classes seriously when I was in high school/ first go round of college. However, now I've gotten into the routine I feel kind of guilty if I'm not watching a video, making a fake network or just doing something networking related. Loving the material makes it easier, but you also have to know a little moderation. Sometimes you're just not in the mood to study, and I always thought fighting that was a bad idea. Mainly because it made it hard to focus.  As far as family and social life, I always made time for family that part wasn't that difficult. Social life definitely has been strained, but due to some personal reason (which I wont get into here) my true friends knew how important finishing college and getting a CCNA was to me. They've all been incredibly supportive and have helped me out with studying or anything else I've needed along the way."

Something always seems to come up that prevents me from studying. I have a pretty unorthodox schedule that I also think is preventing me from getting into a routine.  As far as family I meant like a wife and kid. I have a 2 year old and between my schedule and the child I have almost no free time.

You have 15 minutes to do this. Do it! Better use the full time here and not waste any understanding how to click in the sims during the actual exam.  6- Tutorial is done, you are ready, start the exam.  7- Exam is 50-60 questions, I had 6 simulations, each had 4-5 questions. Total time is 90 minutes. There is a clock in the corner of the screen giving you your current question number and time remaining. You cannot go back once you answered a question.  8- When you are finished, it will give you your score and pass/fail status.  9- There is a survey at the end, around 5 minutes, regarding the exam, the testing facility, and general comments.  10- The proctor will give you the printed report that states your score, pass/fail, and a breakdown of your score in 6 sections. You will have to sign the entry paper stating your exit time. You pick up your stuff in the locker.  11- You are now CCNA! You will receive a pribted certificate by the mail in about 2 weeks."

ccna,3ar8j5,verytguy,1 point,Tue Jun 23 00:23:05 2015 UTC,"For the locker part, the proctor had a key, opened locker #5, and wrote on my exam sign-in ""#5"". The locker where all locked with a key, and it seems that only proctors had the keys.  For the simulations, most where 5-6 routers interconnected with OSPF or EIGRP, questions where like ""why is R5 not forming an adjacency with R3"", or why can't PC2 ping R1. Answers were multiple choice for each ""sub question"" in the simulation, like a) they are not in the same AS b) hello timers don't match c) the cable between R3 and R4 is faulty d) R5 is not running OSPF  All were resolved with different show commands, none required configuring anything. ? works, but I can't confirm tab worked as I didn't use it."

ccna,3apk4b,DrGobo,1 point,Mon Jun 22 13:38:39 2015 UTC,"The network command is used only to tell which interfaces will be enabled for the RIP process.  If you enter 24.0.0.0, all interfaces starting with 24.x.x.x will be enabled for RIPv2.  If you enter 24.17.2.0 and 24.17.2.16 , all interfaces configured with these subnets 24.17.2.0/28 and 24.17.2.16/28 will be enabled for RIPv2.  Not sure if there are any RIP questions on the exam but keep in mind that with RIP version 1 with network statement you should enter the classful address, otherwise it's counted as a mistake.  With classless routing protocols it's better to match the subnet of the interface or better its IP address with the network statement for better control."
ccna,3apk4b,PsychoMet,1 point,Mon Jun 22 14:06:44 2015 UTC,"Neither of the two ways is wrong necessarily. The method where you enter ""network 24.0.0.0 (0.255.255.255)"" utilizes route summarization. Both the network 24.17.2.0/28 and 24.17.2.16/28 fall within the range of the 24.0.0.0/8 network.   Using the method of entering both networks ends up with two routes learned dynamically in the routing table instead of one. In a small network like the one in the lab, this makes little difference. But if you imagine a huge corporation with hundreds of networks - route summarization can save a lot of processing power on the router.  So, in real life both methods can be used but summarization can be very beneficial both on your workload and the performance of the network - specially with large networks!   That being said, the networks involved in this lab could be summarized to 24.17.2/24 instead of 24.0.0.0/8.   Hope that helps!"

That's the RID with which the router will be seen in the ospf domain.

What I should have done was say (looking at the first image example) ""Okay, R1 RID is 10.1.1.1, and while R2 is not configured, I need to consider in the loopback address as the RID, and 172.16.1.3 is greater than 10.1.1.1, and so so R2 is the DR. """
ccna,3an1y6,PsychoMet,2,Mon Jun 22 00:08:35 2015 UTC,"We are talking about the second first picture, right? What about R3? It's on the same multiaccess segment. What is it's RID?  EDIT: Got confused with the pictures. I meant the first picture example."
ccna,3an1y6,PsychoMet,1 point,Mon Jun 22 00:16:50 2015 UTC,"It would be 192.168.2.2, regardless if that interface is configured for the talking on a different segment/network. No loopback address, so it moved onto the active interfaces."
ccna,3an1y6,PsychoMet,2,Mon Jun 22 00:29:09 2015 UTC,"Right. So now for Segment A we have:  R1 RID: 10.1.1.1  R2 RID: 172.16.1.3  R3 RID: 192.168.2.2  Choosing DR and BDR should be very simple.  I would advise you to first write down the RIDs for every router on the multiaccess segment and then determine which one what role takes, it's much easier."
ccna,3an1y6,thingmabobby,1 point,Mon Jun 22 00:34:22 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's great tip. I don't know why I just ignored the router ID if it wasn't configured, as if the OSPF would just move and make do. THanks for the tip."

ccna,3an1y6,thingmabobby,2,Mon Jun 22 00:49:37 2015 UTC,"It looks like you have it down pretty well, but it bases it on active interfaces in just that specific area. Each area has its own DR and BDR."
ccna,3an1y6,alislack,1 point,Sun Jun 21 21:43:46 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I felt confident in this. I'm getting a 60% on a this test for the course, just a bunch of these questions but I think there might be an error.   I wasn't sure if they compared RID's for example, see that maybe some are not configured, and then they look at all the IP's and use that, regardless if the RID is setup to make it fair. But these protocols are not fair, or mean, they just are."
ccna,3an1y6,PsychoMet,2,Sun Jun 21 22:14:51 2015 UTC,It lets you have a lot of flexibility when you want to make sure a certain router is DR or BDR. One thing I noticed during my Cisco Learning Academy course was that they are very tricky in their wording for tests. Make sure you have those different priorities down as well as knowing WHEN the elections take place.
ccna,3an1y6,alislack,1 point,Sun Jun 21 22:27:26 2015 UTC,"These were just simple diagrams, with some information above each router.   Are you referring to when a network is already up and running, and you add a new router, that has the configuration that should make it the DR? Because I'm aware it's on the sidelines until the DR goes down, and only then does that new router move up into BDR position."

ccna,3akslm,chuckbales,3,Sun Jun 21 05:18:05 2015 UTC,"Must just be a bad part of the code.  No version of ASA I've worked with supports wildcards, which is unfortunate as it would make some things much easier."
ccna,3akslm,HighGainWiFiAntenna,1 point,Sun Jun 21 14:13:07 2015 UTC,Hey chuck. Why would you prefer wildcard over netmask. They both can define the Same ranges.   I may have answered my own question. Is it because WC aren't restricted in the values they can have in each octet like a SM is? Adds more granularity.
ccna,3akslm,chuckbales,1 point,Sun Jun 21 18:15:26 2015 UTC,"Yea since wildcards aren't restricted to the rules of Netmasks, you can do things like matching every odd/even subnet, or matching every 10.x.30.0 subnet with a single rule."
ccna,3akslm,HighGainWiFiAntenna,0,Sun Jun 21 18:58:01 2015 UTC,I learned wildcards mainly at the ccna level which called for contiguous numbering. I've seen some interesting masks out there that I generally have to write out the range manually to really understand.   Got any tips?  I see you usually have some good ones.
ccna,3akslm,chuckbales,1 point,Sun Jun 21 19:59:24 2015 UTC,"Not sure if I have any nuggets for wildcards. Most of the time I see them, they are being used as just an inverted netmask, which makes them pretty easy to mentally convert back to the netmask.  Sometimes I use them in IOS to match specific non-contiguous networks, which is an easier example to do mentally. Like if I had  50 sites, all with a voice subnet at 10.x.200.0, its easy to divvy up the octets as Care.DontCare.Care.DontCare, so 00000000.11111111.00000000.11111111, or 0.255.0.255. Then my ACL only would need permit ip SOURCE 10.0.200.0 0.255.0.255.  To do that on an ASA would require either an ACL with 50 lines, or building an object-group with 50 networks.  Some of the tricks like 'build a wildcard to match only even-numbered subnet' is not something I'd ever see doing in production, but is more just to reinforce the binary behind it."

Odom just goes into far more detail (hence the thicker book), which you may or may not necessarily need in the exam, but having deeper but less broad knowledge seems to pay off in the long run.  In all honesty, I'm just a bit spiteful because after I read lammle's Net+ and CCNA books when I was starting, he never once used the acronym ""RIB"" which is relatively synonymous with ""routing table"" and, during my first technical interview, I was asked what another name for the routing table is and I came up blank.

ccna,3ai3cu,DrGobo,6,Sat Jun 20 11:37:22 2015 UTC,Generally these things go from largest unit to smallest.  Some big routers used in datacenters are literally racks that have tons of interface cards slotted into them.  Many of these cards have multiple ports on them.  So usually it goes like this Subrack/Interface Card/Port number.  If the router is smaller it might just be Interface Card/Port number.

ccna,3afhmr,Maximus7713,6,Fri Jun 19 23:50:57 2015 UTC,"The absolute first thing you have to do is say to yourself ""don't panic."" Write it out in some big, friendly words if it helps calm you down, but you will not get anywhere if you've already convinced that you've failed. Remind yourself that it could be worse. Really, I'm confident without knowing a single thing about you that it could be way worse. If you're studying for this test, it means you have your CCENT, which means you are further along then the person without their CCENT, and even further than the person who hasn't started studying. I'm also betting you've got most of your limbs, probably a pair of eyes, and no major mental deficiencies if you've made it this far. So repeat it again: ""don't panic.""   Now for actually getting through the material and making some progress.  Once you're calm, start figuring out what out what you do and don't know. Make a spreadsheet or draw lines on paper, and put things in columns for what you are solid on, what you kind of know, and what completely confuses you. If everything confuses you and you don't have a clue about anything, so be it, at least you've got plenty of places to start.   To address the issue you're having with acronyms and terms, there really is nothing better than repetition and memorization. The way I was able to get familiar with all the terminology was with flash cards. They are tedious to set up and you'll be tempted to type them into a flash card program or use someone else's cards, but don't do either at first. Using good old pencil and paper to write them out is the best way to go as your mind will not only absorb the information through seeing it, but also through the act of moving your hand and creating the words.  If you're like me, you're probably thinking that using flash cards are stupid and useless. If that's the case, get over it, they work. I eventually gave in after plenty of resistance and months of wracking my brain over trying to memorize terms from my study books and websites, and I was able to retain the information shockingly fast and effectively. There are plenty of ways to use flash cards, but I found that the methods on this wikihow page worked best for me.   I ended up with somewhere around 120 to 150 cards - I did not write them all at once, and if you try to do that you'll get frustrated and quit so start small -  and I had them all memorized within about 2 to 3 weeks by studying them for at least 30 minutes a day. I carried them with me at work, while walking the dog, filing brown paperwork in the circular file, waiting for dinner to cook, and during intermission while watching hockey at home. I did not typically sit down and spend a solid 30 minutes, but 5 or 10 minutes at a time goes a long way.  After you're comfortable with terms and acronyms, start making more cards for concepts. Make some that go over troubleshooting steps, or ones that have maximum connections for certain types of technologies, or cards with the specific commands for different technologies. Find practice tests and put questions on one side of the cards and the answers on the other. Also try to reword the questions and answers since you should now know what all the technical terms mean. This worked really well for me, just try not to use those same practice tests to gauge your knowledge and comprehension since you'll have memorized the answers. Repeat the memorization process outlined in that wikihow article until you're comfortable with them all. If you aren't working and have days worth of time, you should be able to get everything you need to know memorized within 5 to 6 weeks.   I saw your comment about being intimidated by the CLI, GNS3, and Packet Tracer. I felt the same way when I started out. I eventually focused solely on Packet Tracer and started using predefined labs which had the equipment already loaded into the environment. The nice with these labs is that they also had clearly defined goals provided, with solutions available.  To get the labs, I did some basic Google searches for ""packet tracer labs,"" and found that there were numerous labs out there. I really took a liking to the Ranet labs because of how each lab focused on one area, but there are other labs if you don't care for Ranet. Doing these labs, even if you have to look up the answers, will get you more comfortable with the CLI while also helping your understanding of the different technologies.   You clearly don't have much time, and based on your comments, you have plenty riding on getting this certification. If you can stay focused and keep calm, you can earn your CCNA. It will be hard. It will make you frustrated. You will want to quit. Keep going and remind yourself that if you don't start now, you'll be that much farther behind when you finally do decide to start again.  TL;DR: Don't panic. Make flash cards. Do labs. Repeat. Repeat again. Never give up, never surrender."

Watch every video from the bottom up (CCNA-CCNP) OSPF is actually really exciting and interesting when you first look at it. I did this and had a pretty okay understanding of OSPF in like a day. MIND YOU I'm not claiming to be a master with OSPF but I learned enough to be able to explain it in an interview quite well.

ccna,3afhmr,bugxter,3,Sat Jun 20 03:06:02 2015 UTC,"There is so much information to learn but its important to move through it at a comfortable pace. Play along with labs while reading through the book. When you read a topic that seems a little fuzzy, look it up in google, read about it from 3 different sources until you have it down pat, never leave anything to chance.  You'll notice things like eigrp setup is just like ospf setup except without areas. While they are different protocols, the legwork is similar to get them running. The material builds on itself to reinforce it in memory. Contrary to what many of the experts say, I don't think it's a good idea to set yourself up with a deadline, because then your just reading a bunch of words to beat a clock. It's better to take your time to understand the concepts, and repetitive repetitive repetitive repetitive lab work will get those commands in your head. I already passed CCENT but i know im weak with access lists. In my spare time i like to practice labbing my weakest topic areas to make my weaknesses my strengths."

ccna,3afhmr,JasonDJ,2,Fri Jun 19 23:56:22 2015 UTC,"Something that I would've loved somebody told me before starting CCNA: It is normal if you feel like something has not been explained at all, because it isn't. There is so much info on the CCNA that is, in my opinion, out of order. They throw at you some weird acronyms as if you already knew them but treat them from point 0 in a subsequent chapter. Don't give up, just go at it at your own pace."
ccna,3afhmr,alislack,2,Fri Jun 19 19:51:21 2015 UTC,"Relax. None of the certifications are that hard, its just time consuming.

ccna,3afhmr,sixandchange,2,Sat Jun 20 03:14:57 2015 UTC,"I've found this method to work best when studying for any tech test and I highly recommend it.  Pick up a good book on the subject. I think Todd Lammie (sp?) is the favorite around these parts for CCNA.    Acquire a good video series.  CBT Nuggets or INE,  preferably, but there are some damn good youtubers too.  Before you do this, find a good video on setting up GNS3 and packet tracer.  Don't worry about doing anything fancy at this point.  At CCENT level, you should at least be able to hook up two routers back to back and ping between them.  Maybe set up a couple loop backs and static routes and ping the loop backs too.  Now we can get started.   For each topic in the book, watch the correlating video first.  This gives you a quick overview of the topic. Don't take notes, don't speed it up, just watch it and pay attention.  After the vdeo, read the chapter in the book.  Take notes. Make flash cards. Whatever works for you.  After you read the chapter once or twice, close the book and put it away.  Open GNS3 or PT and lab out the topic.  Try not to cheat. Use show commands and ""?"" to your advantage. The key here is to figure it out on your own.   Once it's working, review the chapter again.  If you feel like you've learned more from reading, go ahead and lab it out again.  If you feel like you've mastered the topic as much as you need, continue on to the next topic.  Once you are done with all the topics, and you feel you are ready, start reviewing the syllabus on the Cisco Learning Portal ( http://www.cisco.com/go/ccna ).  Ask yourself questions.   Build out a huge network in GNS3 that leverages everything you've learned on that syllabus.   Try to find practice tests.  Don't find brain dumps, you're better than that.  Non brain dumps are around and they have great questions.  If you understand the material, the hardest part of the CCNA is reading comprehension.    If you are truly stumped on a topic, Google is your friend. It's honestly 95% of the job for the first year (then it drops down to 80-90).  And of course, /r/ccna and /r/cisco are here to help as well.  Good luck."
ccna,3afhmr,ChrisA_5845,1 point,Sat Jun 20 13:43:12 2015 UTC,This is good advice. The key is revise and lab often enough so that you eventually learn by osmosis. My own point of view is there is not really a need to take notes as by that time the concepts are learned. Any notes I do take are just simple comments and sketches outlining a concept I can refer to.   I have found that writing detailed notes on paper is a waste of time as it is very difficult to locate information several months later.  Writing into a word document or text file is preferable as the find tool (or grep and sed) can search for keywords.

The lack of confidence that you have can be overcome by getting into the devices and setting things up. I know that the newer installers work great and are not as hard to use as the older ones. What operating system are you running???

For example: Only focus on OSPF before you move onto the next thing.  Break each section into 4 study methods.    Watch CBT Nuggets for the overview. He's really good at explaining from a 1000ft view. Use it for what it is. I always had to have the overview before I started reading. Take notes from the book. Make sure to build ""compare lists"" for each part like pro's and con's. Which protocol is faster? Which protocol is proprietary? Do labs until you're confident. Keep doing different ones until you can set up something like OSPF blindfolded. Practice test over that section."

ccna,3ag1n0,CBRjack,2,Fri Jun 19 22:25:37 2015 UTC,You may see a few ICND1 questions at most.
ccna,3afmtg,flatlineskillz,2,Fri Jun 19 19:12:34 2015 UTC,"Wildcard, think of them in binary. Every ""0"" needs to match, every ""1"" is an ""i don't care"" bit.  192.168.130.2 0.0.15.255 for example. The 0 bits are kept, you end up with 192.168.128.0, the other bits are dropped.  In OSPF, it is used to choose your interfaces, so if you have 10.5.0.1, 10.6.0.1, 10.30.0.1, you can just do 10.0.0.0 0.255.255.255.  10.5.0.1 will become 10.0.0.0, it matches, same for the other two.  Frames, what you have to remember is this : Any layer 3 device will remove the layer 2 to get to the layer 3. Then put a new one. Imagine an enveloppe with a letter to your name in it, and the address of your office on the enveloppe. The office address is the MAC, the name is the IP. The postman is level 2, a switch. He looks at the address (the mac) to deliver to letter, but it never change, even after 3 postmen. Once it gets to your office, the mail clerk is level 3, a router. He opens the envellope and trash it, he looks at your name, the IP, and put the letter in a new envellope with your office number on it. This enveloppe gets taken to your office where you open it and get your letter.  The principle is : a switch looks at the mac and decides.  A router looks at the IP and decides.  To get to the IP, it ""strips off"" the mac, and replaces it after."
ccna,3afmtg,CBRjack,0,Fri Jun 19 19:33:59 2015 UTC,"Thanks  I'm still not understanding how your getting the 192.168.128.0 from 192.168.130.2 with the 0.0.15.255 wildcard. I get that 255 translates to a '0'.  With regards to the frames, When the router strips the mac then replaces it doesn't the source and/or destination change?   Also when a host sends a packet to another host on the network it puts its own source MAC and the MAC of the host or the MAC of the default gateway interface? When a router sends the packet it along does it add the outgoing interface MAC address to it as the source?"
ccna,3afmtg,CBRjack,2,Fri Jun 19 19:42:29 2015 UTC,"For the frames : it changes source and dest mac, but it doesn't change source and dest ip. Source and destination IP should be the same all the way, unless you do NAT, but that's not in the ccent.  For the mask, let's go in binary :  192.168.130.2  11000000.10101000.10000010.00000010  And the mask, 0.0.15.255  00000000.00000000.00001111.11111111  Align the bits, ignore any bits that are 1s in the mask, and you get :  11000000.10101000.10000000.00000000  Which is 192.168.128.0  Windows calc can help you, open it and go in Programmer's mode (alt-3)  You will see your number and the binary at the same time, it will help you a lot"
ccna,3afmtg,CBRjack,1 point,Fri Jun 19 19:51:19 2015 UTC,"OK one last question for the frames to makes sure I am understanding: So with the router, it changes source and destination mac but not IP.

ccna,3aevob,CBRjack,1 point,Fri Jun 19 16:14:46 2015 UTC,Is what your trying to describe like those practice test questions that say based on the output..... or do you mean literally show commands?  When did you achieve your CCNA? Also is the contextual help menu in the test i.e the ? and can you abbreviate commands?
ccna,3aevob,CBRjack,2,Fri Jun 19 16:18:01 2015 UTC,"I passee ICND1 on May 11, and ICND2 on May 13.  You can use ? and abbreviate commands, for example ""sh ip int br"" would work, you don't need to type the full ""show ip interface brief"".  I don't recall if autocomplete works (tab), but I don't see why they would not allow it. Also, the ? will only show you supported commands, this will help greatly. You will only have a few options available instead of a multi page list.  The questions I had usually had 4-5 routers, accessible via ""telnet"", and 4 or 5 questions. You go in the routers, check thinks like ""show ip protocols"", ""show ip int br"", ""show ip ospf neighbors"", and answer the questions.  The best thing you can do is to get familiar with the interface of the simulation during the ""tutorial"" period at the beginning. Before the clock starts for the exam, you have 15 minutes in a tutorial that will show you how to answer each question type, and how the simulation works. Don't skip this tutorial. Use those 15 minutes to get familiar with the interface and you will save time during the actual exam."

Net+ covered many topics that CCENT does not, such as wireless internet and fiber optics. Net+ expects you to learn all the standard port numbers and services, while CCENT really does not (maybe a little bit but not really.) Net+ is like a wide net that catches all kinds of fish (networks in general). CCENT/CCNA is like a spear gun that you point at sharks (routers and switches).  Not only that, but Net+ isn't as intimidating, especially if you grew up in the GUI generation. CCENT is all command line, there's quite a bit to remember. Thats not to say its impossible for a newbie, but if your going from say finance to IT, start with CompTIA A+, then Net+, then CCENT, then CCNA. Yes it's a long road, but it's worth it. I took my A+ at age 16 and passed. Took Net+ at age 30 (yes I waited that long because my career took off), and Net+ filled in so many gaps of my knowledge that CCENT would not have. If your super motivated and focused on salary i would say go straight for CCENT, but if you really have a genuine interest in IT i would say get the Net+ first."
ccna,3ac1cm,KernelLingux,2,Fri Jun 19 06:46:52 2015 UTC,"This is well put.  The instances I've personally seen, where people say N+ is a waste are those that didn't take that route. It's not for everyone but I did the A+ - N+ - CCENT - CCNA thing and my scope of knowledge is a bit more comprehensive than some of my team members that only have a CCNA. That also has to do with my career history, which honestly started at the bottom hence the A+.  Really understanding the OSI Model requires experience with elements other than Cisco Switches and Routers."
ccna,3ac1cm,Vontech615,1 point,Fri Jun 19 16:00:39 2015 UTC,"If i recall, Net+ also covered topics like d-marks, IDF/MDF, UPS's, real world applicable concepts and hardware. Much of that I learned through experience working with contractors building out IT racks, but wish I had learned from Net+ ahead of time, which CCENT didn't cover. Routers and switches are only 2 pieces of networking rack gear in your typical enterprise rack space which can include everything from CCTV, public address systems, digital signage, and servers."
ccna,3ac1cm,KernelLingux,5,Fri Jun 19 19:42:33 2015 UTC,"Get your CCENT. A million times better than Net+.  But they both suck.  I would get the CCNA at all costs. If you can afford it or get financial aid, take college computer science classes and while doing that get your CCNA and then get a job from your college career center and then work/go to school.  My 2 cents.  If you don't want to do the college thing then charge towards your CCNA -> CCNP -> CCIE.    Or CCNA + MCSE. Stay at your mom's house if you have to... just never stop studying.  (Essentially, the ultimate answer is just to work really really hard.)"

Once you have those in my experience no one will care about the Net+ cert. I have the Net+ book and have read it, there is good knowledge there. I was pushed into networking at work as I was doing cable installs and they wanted me to do more. I went from almost zero networking knowledge to being able to do some switch configs and understanding ios after reading and watching videos online for CCNA after a couple of months. Get packet tracer and follow along with the videos doing the commands in ios. To answer some of your original questions. If you really want Net+ the website is http://certification.comptia.org/getCertified/certifications/network.aspx and a good book is Mike Meyers comp tia all in one, it is expensive but there should be used books and digital books that are cheaper."
ccna,3ac1cm,The707kid,1 point,Thu Jun 18 23:36:54 2015 UTC,"I'm assuming since your here and studying for a CCENT that you want to pursue networking. Do you have any prior experience with tech support, repairing computers, or setting up small networks?   You can get a CCNA but your going to find it very hard to get hired without at least something on your resume that indicates your technically inclined. Which just means that you need to be looking for something very entry level, help desk, NOC (if you're lucky) and/or just side jobs doing tech work. Do it for a year and move on.   Bottom line, set expectations low and know that it's going to take time in this industry to get where you want to be. Not forever but ""I.T."" encompasses a massive amount of options. There really isn't a fast track."

Motivation-wise, it's just thinking about my future. My current job is high-stress (911 dispatcher), and it's wearing me down. My motivation is also my reward... well, along with a new 4K TV.  I would also recommend taking a day here and there to not even look at the material. Go to a movie, play some videogames, whatever you want to do. Just don't read or practice anything for a day (I take one every other week), and make sure you still get plenty of sleep.

Honestly, if I was doing consistent 14 hour days I would have probably been fed up with it before I got to the point where I was ready for the test. Don't over exert yourself.

While at work, I study the material with the PDF version of the WO book, and use packet tracer to practice the labs.  For passing ICND1 I was going to buy myself a Cisco 851w as a reward to help me study for ICND2, but my stepfather had an 881w laying around and just gave it to me. I have since passed ICND1, and currently I am studying/labbing an average of 3 hours per day for ICND2 (currently on EIGRP configuration, roughly half way through the book).  What keeps me motivated is indeed.com. Right now I feel stuck in my organization doing what I do, so when I type CCNA into Indeed and view the job offerings, my mouth starts to water, and I jump right back into the books. You have to be hungry to be an effective hunter. Thats not to say that people who are fulfilled with their employment lifestyle aren't able to pull through just as easily, but for me being bored as hell at work while knowing I'm capable of so much more, is a definite motivator.

I spent all of 2008 unemployed, and have been working outside manual labor since then. I got to the point at the beginning of last year that I was fed up.   I love computers and problem solving so I went the networking route. Went to CC full time while working full time and studying on my own afterwards.It's been exhausting and now that I'm at the end of my little journey I'm burnt out (plan on taking a break from everything once I get my CCNA). But every step of the way I can say it's been worth it.  The most important thing is moderation and knowing when to give yourself a break. A typical day for me is : Up at 5:30am, work 6-4, Study 5-9, bed at 10. The funny thing is that I was never this kind of person in my early twenties or ever really.However, now I feel guilty if I'm not learning something new.  As far as rewarding myself, I'm pretty simple in that aspect. When I passed Net +, CCENT and graduated my treat to myself was a very expensive dinner/evening alone.

ccna,3abct8,Prophet_60091_,5,Thu Jun 18 18:46:24 2015 UTC,"The cost is dependent on the media between the switches.  From the wikipedia article on spanning tree protocol :  4 Mbps : 250  10 Mbps : 100  16 Mbps : 62  100 Mbps : 19  1 Gbps : 4  2 Gbps : 3  10 Gbps : 2  The cost was 1Gbps/interface speed originally, but was modified to allow differentiation on interface faster than 1 Gbps.  If you have 2 100Mbps links and 1 1Gbps link between your switch and the root switch, your cost will be 42. (2x19 + 1x4)  Hope this helps!"
ccna,3abct8,CBRjack,1 point,Thu Jun 18 19:11:02 2015 UTC,"Basically, cost is determined when BPDUs are sent from the root bridge by the amount/speed of interfaces the data unit passes through to reach the target router.  In legacy STP, I believe Gigabit interfaces add 4 to cost, and Fast Ethernet interfaces add 19 (not positive on that, determined by link speed).    The faster the link(s), the lower the cost."

I'm not saying it cannot be done, but there are a lot easier ways of doing it.  Furthermore, it depends on what your goal is (and that may change as you learn what IT is like).  Learn a bit of programming.  Learn a bit of digital electronics.  Learn about data structures.  Then you'll have the fundamentals to tackle  networking."

Subnetting is one that gets most people. This is partly because it isn't easy, but also because they teach it backwards, with classful, then classless, then CIDR, when teaching CIDR then teaching how to convert it to classless and classful networks works far better.  VLANs at this level are ""OMGWTF"" until one day you magically understand and wonder why you didn't. VLANs are what it says on the tin, Virtual LANs.

Everything your router sees, smells and tastes is binary.  Once you are able to visualise 0-255 in binary, subnetting becomes really easy. ACL wild card masks are subnets with the bits flipped (for the most part).  Everything in class can be in the exam. They will trip you up with basic level stuff, and oh so effed up way of saying things... But if you had to focus on one thing : understand IP addressing, subnet masks and wild card masks.

ccna,3a6ou2,Darolant,1 point,Thu Jun 18 21:53:17 2015 UTC,"Do it all. If you have the time to spend, do every chapter before you do it in class. Read through it, do every lab with packet tracer. Use packet tracer like the god-tool it is. It has little time-stop feature that lets you see every packet and then see how the layers work and it'll even quiz you. Do that stuff.  Don't worry about not understanding things, but do it all. If you're short on time, just do the chapter you'll work on in class before the class. This way, you have a slight headstart and can ask the teacher better questions.  If it's gonna be split up between more semesters, then take time during your break to do the rest of the material on your own. You'll be miles ahead. If you're gonna do the CCNA Security one or a Wireless one, make sure you do it before-hand. I found both of those boring as hell.

ccna,3a2j5s,CBRjack,2,Tue Jun 16 18:52:48 2015 UTC,"Technically, yes the packet does change since the router can either a) perform SNAT/DNAT, or b) decrement the TTL value by -1.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_address_translation  Although TTL will always be modified, the src and dst ip's in the layer 3 header may not, depending on whether you're routing over a private or public address space.   Your statement is half right, and half wrong, depending on the interpretation of the reading. I assume you mean 'routing' over a private address space with no DNAT/SNAT policies, in that case the src and dst ip's WILL NOT CHANGE.   ALSO, the checksum is recalculated and inserted into the IP header when routed (in the case of network address translation taking place) - since the IP header is 'modified', therefore initiating a new calculation for verification on the next hop."

Think of the MAC as having the source of itself, and destination of the next hop. The IP address goes from the actual source device, to the actual source destination.  Say I wanted to check my email. packets would always have the IP address of my client machine and my email server. But as a packet leaves my PC to that email server, the source MAC would be my PC and destination would be the switch I'm connected to, from there the MAC's change. Now the source is the switch and the destination is the router (or switch depending on your network), then from the router the source would be the router (and to make this less complicated) the destination would be my email server. (Normally, there would another switch between the router and mail server, and also, there would probably just be more switches in your network, and once you get to Layer 3 switching, you may not see a router on your way to your email server)."

At this point in your career experience is more valuable than cash. At least in my mind.   My suggestion would be to say that you researched online what Jr Network Admis make in the area and came to the conclusion that the starting range for someone like you is in (insert range here) Then ask about the other beneifits unless you already know them, if they have crap for benefits then ask for something on the higher end of that range maybe even expand the range a little bit, if the benefits are great then suggest that you are comfortable on the mid to low end of your range."

ccna,39zt19,citizen987654321,0,Tue Jun 16 05:45:23 2015 UTC,If you have 1 management vlan how are you going to access other switches if they don't have ip addresses assigned to each other. Example: An interface on switch 2 goes down and you need to remote in and start it up again but only your management vlan has an ip address and not switch 2. How would you access it? Via console?

Only on the management VLAN of each switch.   And what instance would a port go down where you could simply remote in and bring it back up? If you say switchport security, then that makes no sense. Because you don't configure swithport security on trunk links between switches. If your trunk goes down, there's a very likely chance you can not remote into it anyway.  If there are redundant trunks, then you can still reach the management IP."

ccna,39zt19,jeffinRTP,1 point,Tue Jun 16 15:15:29 2015 UTC,My understanding is that you only have an ip address for management of the switch. You create the vans on the router to allow communication between different vlans as a sub interface on the lan port of the router. You will need to add the vlans to the switch so they know about them.
ccna,39zt19,The_camperdave,1 point,Tue Jun 16 03:09:28 2015 UTC,"Remember that switches operate at layer 2.  They don't need IP addresses at all.  IP addresses are layer 3 stuff. Switches don't care about layer 3 stuff.  As far as each switch having an address in every VLAN, that would be a very bad idea from a security standpoint.  Anyone on any VLAN would have access to your switches, and could attempt to crack the security.  Best practice is to have a VLAN solely for management.  Now keep in mind that you do have to have a router on your network if you want the VLANs to be able to talk to each other.  That router would have to have an IP address in each VLAN."

I've been the 'phone guy' for a company for over 15 years, and I'm a little burned out on it. I feel like it's always been a limited investment area for companies and that's not getting better. People have these new-fangled ""cell phones"" they use for a lot of calling because they're more convenient, so expensive and complicated desk phones get ignored much of the time. Videoconferencing is cool, but it seems to be less reliable and workable in the expensive installed solutions than throwing around a bunch of cheap iMacs running FaceTime.

ccna,39vj9d,arming10,7,Mon Jun 15 03:41:18 2015 UTC,"CCDA has just been discussed recently in this thread: CCDA: What is it like?.     The Title  I don't work in the US job market and my experience with the regular recruiting process is very limited, but from extensive chatter on the subject inside #packetpushers and other sources, my conclusion is that titles are only needed to get past HR and land you in front of a proper engineer for the technical interview.     If you're at the point in your career where you are considering things like the CCAr (you shouldnt, see below) but you still need to ""get past HR"", you're doing something severely wrong.     CCAr   is pretty much a ""cisco employees"" only certification, only 20 people or so in the world have it.      Why? Because honestly it's pretty much a circle jerk. If you're a world-class architect capable of designing global-scale networks and you have the experience to back it, pursuing yet another cert has not the best ROI for your time.      At that point in your career you could bill so much as a consultant that the time and energy invested in such a cert could probably buy you a decent house in a major city, which means you could be doing better things with your time.      There is also not a need for that many architects and not at that level :) There are just so many ultra-large-scale corporate networks you can build today.      The new paradigm for large scale networks  Nowadays the companies focusing on Big scale-out networks are mostly cloud companies and your cisco cred wouldnt achieve much with that crowd.      Physical networks will be getting thinner and simpler in the next years. You will see routing domains push closer to hosts than ever before (L2 broadcast domains will shrink).      That is a requirement of the new underlay/overlay model. Decoupling services and ""value add"" from the underlying network means you can iterate faster (through software) than companies can push out new metal (new switches and routers), but to avoid troubleshooting becoming a nightmare..your ""underlay"" (your physical network on top of which your traffic runs) needs to be dead-simple, reliable and easy to tshoot.      If you need complexity, rather than throwing the kitchen sink of features and options in your network hardware (see: Cisco Nexus 7000), you just encapsulate over your stupid, reliable, fast L3 underlay network and build your smart shenanigans such as OTV, VXLAN, LISP etc. inside that ""overlay"" (or tunnel, or encapsulated connection).     The end result is that said shenanigans do not impact other users of the same underlay network (such as different Business Units in your company or even different customers of your Service Provider).      DevOps / cheaper workforce  There is definitely a hidden work-force advantage as well (that recruiters and decision makers are grossly misunderstanding but that is the way of the world) in the fact that an overlay/underlay network can be made to work with a minimum amount of experienced network engineering staff and having a bunch of cheaper code monkeys istantiate new services inside overlays.      If they fail, iterate again your dev cycle and bash at it again.      I'm not saying this is the way it should be or that it's smart or sensible.. but it is an option and it's easier and cheaper than giving a full-featured core network in the hands of a junior network engineer and hoping he would swing it.     Example: A junior (CCNA level) could (probably) never get a big, complex network to a point where it would work acceptably well for the needs of a business.. but a junior code monkey can very well hack together a network service app that runs ok on a well-built, simple underlay network.      My 2c on the matter :)"
ccna,39vj9d,1karmik1,2,Mon Jun 15 04:34:41 2015 UTC,Why? Because honestly it's pretty much a circle jerk   TL;DR:  ^  AMAZING ANSWER.
ccna,39vj9d,DeeJayMaps,2,Mon Jun 15 21:14:21 2015 UTC,CCDA and CCDP are quite popular in the design fields.   To be a CCAr you need to be a CCDE (and often CCIE as well) also have massive amounts of large scale design experience for your application to be considered. Realistically your company or Cisco themselves would sponsor you if you got to that level.
ccna,39vj9d,the-packet-thrower,3,Mon Jun 15 05:52:16 2015 UTC,"CCDA and CCDP are quite popular in the design fields.   Really?  I'm surprised.  This is literally the first time I've heard that.  It seems like a Cisco joke to be honest.  I mean I know we are all supposed to take Cisco seriously, but at the end of the day, they are a for profit company.  Lets change IOS every year, write new books, make new certs, come out with new product.  Some of it IS innovation.  Some of it is to ride that cache flow.  Shit, CASH.    They are publicly owned company traded on the NYSE.  Their #1 goal is money and market share. The investors have to be satisfied first.  So everytime a random new cert comes out (like Cloud), some corporate fat cat decided it was a time to ""diversify"" and try to take more market share with a new buzzword.  And that rolls down here to us nerds trying to earn certs.  Thus, CCDA was created.

ccna,39vj9d,the-packet-thrower,1 point,Mon Jun 15 22:14:15 2015 UTC,At the E level any cert is valuable.   The design track is highly specific. It's not really an 'engineering' cert in any traditional form. I'd go for it if I weren't working on others. Prob not at the CCNA level though.
ccna,39vj9d,DeeJayMaps,2,Mon Jun 15 22:54:22 2015 UTC,"Your right it's not a engineering cert, I think it has a marketing problem since it's highly specific and not really something that a CCNA level fellow should go after. Though learning design methodology is always a good thing."

It's a fairly tricky exam as it expects you to answer the ""Cisco"" way (""what device/technology would you use in this situation?""), which can be difficult if you have real world experience.

ccna,39rr16,hotstandbycoffee,3,Sun Jun 14 03:29:21 2015 UTC,Print all 4 pages of the exam objectives.  Read each objective and see if you can without charts or notes speak out the definition of what you know what that is.  For instance a VLAN.  Logically separates out blocks of assigned switch ports to be in one group or another and can span across switches.  Used for keeping traffic from hitting all switchports at the same time and can help with security.  A router or L3 switch is needed to go between different VLANs aka interVLAN routing.

ccna,39rvm1,Kraggleflux,2,Sun Jun 14 03:49:25 2015 UTC,They can use the /29 block for setting up NAT of their private IPs. They won't be translating the /29 IPs to the /30.
ccna,39rvm1,chuckbales,1 point,Sun Jun 14 04:01:16 2015 UTC,"To set up NAT in this scenario you need modem/router -> router -> LAN network. The first router is just doing routing w/o NAT, WAN side is /30, LAN side is /29. This is also called transparent mode. Second router is doing the NAT -> WAN side /29, LAN side private IPs.  I've seen Alcatel-Lucent, on more than one occasion, offering this solution to ISPs who are giving more than one IP to customers on some packages.  EDIT: By solution, I mean the routed network. It's up to the customer to use second router, but if he wants NAT, there's no other way to utilise the /29."
ccna,39psb0,verytguy,3,Sat Jun 13 15:56:06 2015 UTC,The ABR tell the routers in the area about routes it knows in other areas. The routers will then be able to decide which ABR (if there is more than one) to send the packet to by knowing which ABR has a proper route.
ccna,39psb0,CBRjack,2,Sat Jun 13 16:34:19 2015 UTC,"To be more precise, the database isn't exchanged, the routers won't know the full topology of the other area.

ccna,39psb0,CBRjack,1 point,Sat Jun 13 16:59:19 2015 UTC,Thanks it makes so much more sense now. I know the backbone area 0 has all traffic routed through it as part of the hierarchy system that exists in ospf. Knowing that all other area's pass through area 0 my guess is that the DR and BDR in area 0 must have to have a pretty good CPU and alot of ram to handle all the information passing through it and all the information it has to store. Am I correct in that assumption?
ccna,39psb0,allseed,1 point,Sat Jun 13 16:42:32 2015 UTC,"Yes, usually you should make sure, if you have a large network, that the backbone routers can handle all the traffic.  Also, the way it works with area 0 is simple. An ABR can only inject routes from his area into area 0 and from area 0 to his other(s) area(s).  So if you have a router with an interface in area 10 and one in area 20, it is an ABR, but it won't feed routes from 10 to 20 and vice versa.  This is done to prevent loops, if you connect 0-10, 0-20, then 10-20, the 10-20 won't feed routes, so you can't have a routing loop."

ccna,39psb0,elsydeon666,1 point,Wed Jun 17 18:09:38 2015 UTC,"I could be wrong, but it sounds like you're just getting to multi area ospf.   The ABR router sends its lsdb during convergence and changes. What it puts into there is a note that identifies itself as an ABR with a message called an LSA. At the CCNA level, we're taught that there are five LSA types. Expect to be asked about them."
ccna,39psb0,autowikibot,1 point,Sun Jun 14 02:39:06 2015 UTC,"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link-state_advertisement  As a CCNA, you are only expected to know LSA types 1-5 TL;DR:  Type 1: ""traditional"" router advertisement, router lists itself and its networks  Type 2: DR advertisement, the DR tells the routers on the same layer 2 broadcast segment (ie, the area the DR ""controls"") which routers it controls, the DR's IP address is also in the link-state ID.  Type 3: Summary LSA, ABRs send these instead reflooding a bajillion type 1 LSAs containing their network (EIGRP has summarization too)  Type 4:  ASBR-Summary LSA, exactly what it says on the tin, the ASBR sends a summary LSA (this may have routes from other, routing protocols, such as EIGRP or RIP, or BGP)  Type 5: External LSA, LSAs with stuff from other routing protocols, these get sent to all areas  Type 6 is pretty much unused, Type 8 is for IPv6 only, 9-11 are for traffic engineering (above your pay grade but important stuff)  Link color is just a grouping of links with a value assigned to make management easier."
ccna,39p4dq,jonbristow,2,Sat Jun 13 11:38:52 2015 UTC,"The two types of memory these files are stored in are Random Access Memory (RAM) and Non-Volatile Random Access Memory (NVRAM).  RAM is where the running-config is stored when the switch is on, but this memory is destroyed upon turning off the switch, whereas NVRAM holds the startup-config file, which will remain saved even when the switch is turned off.  So say you boot up your switch.  Upon booting up, the startup-config is copied from NVRAM to the RAM, and in here it is called the runnin-config.  Prior to making any changes, the startup-config and running-config files are exactly the same, the only difference is where they are stored.  From here on out, all changes you make to the switch will affect only the running-config. To save these changes, you need to copy the running-config from the RAM to the NVRAM via copy running-config startup-config. Think of it as copy THIS FILE and replace THAT FILE.  If you don't do this and decide to just turn off the switch, the RAM (which is where your running-config and all you alterations are) will be erased, and the next time the switch is turned on, it will grab the old startup-config file from the NVRAM, and you'll be back at square one.  Sorry its a little lengthy of an explanation, hope it helped!"
ccna,39p4dq,DrGobo,1 point,Sat Jun 13 12:31:53 2015 UTC,"Upon booting up the startup-file is copied to the RAM which has no file for now. Of course.  My question is, does the switch actually use the startup-config until the file is copied to RAM? And then after the file is copied to RAM, it starts using it (now called runnign config)?  Or the switch waits until the startup-config is copied to RAM and then executes that file?"
ccna,39p4dq,DrGobo,1 point,Sat Jun 13 12:44:35 2015 UTC,"Ah I think I understand your question.  The only use of the NVRAM is to hold a copy of the startup-config.  Basically the steps are: turn on switch, copy startup-config to running-config, start using running config."
ccna,39p4dq,anothergaijin,0,Sat Jun 13 12:51:01 2015 UTC,"Yes, that was my question.  So the switch does not actually read whatever is in the runnign-config? It copies it to RAM and reads the running-config?"
ccna,39p4dq,ElderMarakus,1 point,Sat Jun 13 12:56:31 2015 UTC,running-config is the configuration that is running at that very moment. When you boot a device the running-config is the same as startup-config. When you make changes they only happen on the running-config.  startup-config is what is saved in memory. You generally make changes and then copy the running-config to the startup-config.  This makes more sense if you look at the commands - write memory actually runs the command copy running-config startup-config
ccna,39p4dq,Thraximundane,1 point,Sat Jun 13 12:21:47 2015 UTC,"When the device is booted, the startup-config overwrites the running-config. So when you make changes that need to stay it's important to enter the ""copy running-config startup-config"" or ""write"" commands to save those changes."

You don't need to bring up int vlan 2 or int vlan 4.  This isn't effecting your configuration because the 2950 doesn't have a route processor.  If you had an L3 switch you wouldn't be doing ROAS, and bringing up those interfaces WOULD mess up your configuration.  You want to define speed and duplex, always.  Any time you can, DO IT.  Especially between switches and routers.  If you want to play russian roulette with your end devices (pc,laptop) then that is understandable.    However, none of this seems to affect your issue.  I don't have any live gear with an ETHERNET interface.  That's OLD.  like 2000 old.  However, PT has it working fine.    Your issue is probably in your host.  It's probably firewall."

On an l3 device like the 3750, when you bring up the SVI, AFAIK, the switch will use that logical interface as the default gateway for the ports associated with that vlan.

You're certainly not spending $300 on a cert just to sit in an office and subnet on paper all day long. No one does that.  You went for your CCNA, I assume you like networking? Networking is configuring switches and routers, designing networks, finding where the luser plugged his stupid dlink home router in your network and smashing it on his head.  Everything these days is connected. Fridges are internet enabled ffs. Someone has to run all this! You got in networking only to subnet on paper?... Get a sudoku book!  Playing with the config, seeing what works, what doesn't and finding how to fix stuff is what's fun in networking. I know, some labs are tedious, but by gradually adding stuff, you get stronger. Configuring basic things, then adding on top is how most networks get built anyway.  ICND1 and the associated CCENT covers the basics. What is an IP, how to plug things. CCNA covers routing, switching, the real interesting stuff. You can't hope to learn it all without practice. On the exam, you'll be thrown into configs and you need to be able to answer why X doesn't work. The only way you will know how is by practicing on real or simulated gear.  Packet Tracer, GNS3, old routers, you need to lab to get a feel for the interface. Trust me, when you see the clock on the corner of the screen ticking down, if you haven't practiced your commands, your brain won't know what to do.

ccna,39mgh0,CBRjack,4,Fri Jun 12 20:58:47 2015 UTC,"Packet Tracer is sufficient for ICND2, but personally, I much prefer GNS3.  The big advantage of PT is the easy config of hosts and servers, also switches are properly supported.  GNS3 allows for all commands, but you have to use routers as switches and as hosts so you can run into weird GNS3 specific issues.  Keep using PT, supplement with GNS3 if you want to feel a real router image.  I passed ICND1 with 941, then ICND2 at 868, it is really really much harder."

(DHCP Acknowledge)   It's important to note that at step 2, any and all DHCP servers that CAN give an IP, will.  That means, that if you have three DHCP servers on your network, and only two of them have IPs remaining, only those two will respond.

If not, then just add another /24 or /23 to your /22 and put them on the same vlan.

ccna,39becx,Manb,1 point,Wed Jun 10 17:34:01 2015 UTC,Yeah that was the second part of the first paragraph.

ccna,39becx,Skrp,2,Wed Jun 10 18:40:53 2015 UTC,"Real world you'd hope that you plan ahead and put a big enough subnet there for the possible expansion... but yes if you already have devices in a subnet like servers then you can just add another subnet and let dhcp/vlan sort it out.  Subnetting is super important as a network admin.  I currently work as a Network Admin for an ISP so I work with VLSM on a daily basis.  When working with private IP addresses I wouldn't tend to be so strict in how many IP's you're ""wasting"".  By allocating a /22 or /21 or /20 to a subnet you're not really ""wasting"" real IP addresses.  The odds are that you'll never run out of private space.  Broadcasts don't get too crazy over that size (or you can limit the ports to eliminate broadcast storms).  You can keep adding and adding and adding subnets do a vlan but then it gets hairy trying to track people down if you're trying to identify computers by IP and in separate physical locations.  It's just easier to put all the servers on one subnet and then leave the DHCP clients on another just in case you feel the need to grow the subnet later.  Once you start working every day with /21-/30 subnets then it'll become second nature.  The only issue is to make sure you're not overlapping another subnet."

ccna,3963kr,opg5009,4,Tue Jun 9 15:00:28 2015 UTC,"Well there are several factors depending on the protocol. For example RIP doesn't scale well because of the low hop count maximum.   Single-area OSPF doesn't scale well because every router will have to run the SPF algorithm again for every change.   There's not one factor for scalability, you have to look at that routing protocol and determine what the bottlenecks and scaling issues would be."
ccna,3963kr,coopermorris,1 point,Tue Jun 9 15:08:56 2015 UTC,"So, couldn't OSPF be configured with multiple areas?  Also, who's to say that one network can't use a variety of routing protocols?"
ccna,3963kr,0010000100111111,1 point,Tue Jun 9 18:40:08 2015 UTC,"Sure you can configure multi-area OSPF and that scales great.   Yes you can run as many routing protocols as you want. But you aren't likely to like run RIP at a branch office, EIGRP at HQ because you bought all Cisco routers and then OSPF at all the other branch offices because that's just too much work to configure and maintain."
ccna,3963kr,coopermorris,1 point,Tue Jun 9 18:55:33 2015 UTC,Is RIP actually even used in production?
ccna,3963kr,0010000100111111,1 point,Tue Jun 9 19:08:52 2015 UTC,It sure isn't for me but I'm sure someone out there somewhere is using RIP in production.
ccna,3963kr,coopermorris,1 point,Tue Jun 9 19:21:21 2015 UTC,"Ah ok. Thanks for your responses. They have been very insightful. So, I have another couple of questions for you. Do most companies use one routing protocol? Is that usually the norm?  Also, have you ever come across a company that used multiple dynamic routing protocols at one particular location?"
ccna,3963kr,0010000100111111,1 point,Tue Jun 9 19:26:42 2015 UTC,"If companies are using more than one routing protocol it is likely they're using something at the edge and then something internal. For example up to their edge from their ISP they use MPLS or BGP then in their internal network they would use OSPF, EIGRP, etc.   The use of multiple internal routing protocols while justified in some cases, is usually poor planning. For example a company used EIGRP but then bought some non-Cisco routers so those run OSPF so now their network is using multiple routing protocols."

ccna,394lvt,vvretched,1 point,Tue Jun 9 12:59:27 2015 UTC,OK didn't realize that Cisco changes their exam numbers for each iteration of it. That explains why there's no date for when the exam was published. So do they announce pretty far in advance if they're going to retire the 201?
ccna,394lvt,Haniashez,2,Tue Jun 9 13:27:30 2015 UTC,"Yep, the exam number changes each time. They do announce if they are planning on retiring an exam. They give you a few months notice. The CCNA was recently refreshed (2013 maybe?)."

ccna,3927cl,ibetyouvotenexttime,1 point,Tue Jun 9 00:58:01 2015 UTC,"Confused. If your router (not switch) is serving up dhcp for your various vlans, you shouldn't need the helper address on each subinterface. They are all directly connected networks. The router already knows how to get there."
ccna,3927cl,chuckbales,1 point,Tue Jun 9 02:22:20 2015 UTC,So how would this be done if you wanted to have a different scope for each vlan?
ccna,3927cl,deltasly,2,Tue Jun 9 11:46:38 2015 UTC,"Depends on where your DHCP server is. If the DHCP server is the router/switch doing the inter-vlan routing, just add multiple scopes and the router will recognize which interface the DHCP Discover was received on, and will check its own pools to see if it has a matching one.  If the DHCP server is say a Windows server somewhere, you'd configure multiple scopes on the Windows server, then whatever is doing the inter-vlan routing will need IP helper commands added, pointing to the Windows server.    The router then forwards DHCP requests to the Windows server (inserting its IP in a field called GIADDR). This GIADDR lets the server know which network is asking for an IP, so it can match that to a scope."
ccna,3927cl,DeeJayMaps,2,Tue Jun 9 13:23:29 2015 UTC,"Yes, if those box's ports are on an access port set to their different vlan, which I'd imagine they would be...each of their vlans needs to know where to forward the dhcp packets."
ccna,3927cl,DeeJayMaps,1 point,Mon Jun 8 19:17:00 2015 UTC,"Can you post your topology?  I'm looking at the answers, and they are all correct. It just depends on what your switches are doing. Are they l3 intervlan routing ?"
ccna,3927cl,DeeJayMaps,1 point,Tue Jun 9 02:25:34 2015 UTC,"Yeah they are L3 InterVlan Routing. I think you are getting confused, I did not set my router up with DHCP. I have my own server that is on its own Vlan that will act as the DHCP server. The helper address tells the different vlans where they should look for the DHCP server."
ccna,3927cl,ruready4thepenis,1 point,Tue Jun 9 06:31:13 2015 UTC,"I'm just confused on your topology.   So you're putting the helper address on the vlan interface of your l3 device to point each vlan to the dhcp server.   I ran this is PT last night, just to solidify.   I also ran it as a ROAS with l2 (only) switches. Definitely do not need the helper command in this situation on each router sub-int."
ccna,3927cl,sosabowski,1 point,Tue Jun 9 12:08:28 2015 UTC,"You need the helper command if they are on different subnets than the DCHP to contact it. If you do not have it, even though you set up the sub interfaces, the clients will not know where to look for the DHCP. thats why the helper address is needed.  Yes here is an example: router int fa0/0.1 encapsulation dot1q 100  ip address 192.168.0.1 255.255.255.0 ip helper 192.168.3.1 <--- points to the dhcp server for address.   Then go into the DHCP server: Configure the pools for each Vlan"
ccna,3927cl,0010000100111111,0,Tue Jun 9 17:20:11 2015 UTC,"You would need to set up that way IF another device is the dhcp server. If the router you are using (as the ROAS) with subinterfaces is also the dhcp server for the various association vlans, you don't need the helper command.   The routes are directly connected. The router KNOWS how to get to them. It's the same reason you don't need to set up a routing protocol with ROAS."

ccna,390lgc,Rotundus_Maximus,15,Mon Jun 8 11:09:44 2015 UTC,"Self-study is not for everyone, including people like myself. I learn best when I am surrounded by like-minded folks who are all working to solve the same problems. Being able to sit with someone who is ""on the same level"" as I am, with a CCIE professor to answer literally any question was the best learning experience I've ever had.   My college degree wasn't focused on the CCNA, or even Cisco specifically. A BS with a Network Security focus got my hands on various other technologies and concepts such as Exchange, Disaster Recovery, Linux/Unix Server OS, Java, Incident Response, Active Directory, Wireless, VoIP, Offensive/Defensive Security (extensively), and Data Forensics, to name a few. The degree path I chose also included a handful of business classes such as Accounting, Ethics (business/cyber), Professional Writing, Public Speaking, and Global Culture.   A degree isn't just a CCNA course, it should include a TON of supplementary knowledge that should mold you into an IT wizard as well as a business professional. CCNA and networking only consisted of approximately 5-6 classes out of the 30 or so classes that I took."
ccna,390lgc,NZOR,4,Mon Jun 8 11:54:01 2015 UTC,"I can think of three main reasons.   The first has likely been mentioned. It takes a dedicated person to entirely self study. It much easier to play on reddit, surf the web, or whatever else.   The second reasoned to have someone to ask questions. Sure this subreddit has its advantages. Google has its ups and downs. I've searched for answers to questions only to find posts for 5-10 years ago. Guess what, IOS has changed since then and maybe your device DOES support IPv6, but the Cisco forums post from 2010 doesn't update.   The last reasons is the most useful: connections. In the working world, it's not what you know, it's who you know. Everyone might argue differently, but think about how many under qualified people have a job you would love because they knew someone. Hell, look At politics. It's always good to have contacts."
ccna,390lgc,DeeJayMaps,3,Mon Jun 8 13:08:27 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure where you get your information but i suggest looking for them elsewhere.  A) i paid 1800 euros for my CCNA Discovery course in a legitimate Cisco Academy with in-classroom instructors and physical lab.   Everyone told me i paid the upper-upper end of course prices and i do not regret a penny (opened up my career and was the first step of a great experience).   I've never heard of anyone paying tens of thousands of dollars individually for a course, not even a crash-course bootcamp (which are usually more expensive than a drawn out course like mine that lasted 9 months).  B) CS college degrees, across the world, often blend the CCNA syllabus into a 1-term networking class, they just follow the footprint and depending on your school it might be enough to take the certification but it's not a standalone course and it doesn't cost tens of thousands of dollars on its own (the whole CS degree, of course, might cost a lot of money but not because of the CCNA content).  C) The CCIE program is meant to train the upper end of senior engineers and network architects, people that (by design of the certification track) have piled up SEVERAL YEARS of previous experience before even beginning the certification path. You need at least 7 years of documented experience in the industry before you can even attempt the exam.   CCIE is ,  by all means, an extremely broad and deep certification meant to establish a deep understanding of how networking works. The practical exam is an 8 hours non-stop lab session.   Investing even 1 thousand dollars into CCIE without having a solid, solid, solid professional background in networking would be much more of a waste than investing 2000 in a solid CCNA certification path (let's say course + books + physical lab on ebay)."

ccna,391mu9,HyphMngo,2,Mon Jun 8 16:24:27 2015 UTC,"Okay, so let me think here.  Are you asking if you wanted to cover a group of IP addresses with a range of 192.168.1.10 to 192.168.1.41 could you hypothetically use a wildcard mask of 0.0.0.31 because within such a wildcard mask it covers a range of 32 addresses?  If that's the case, then no. Wildcard masks work a lot like VLSM. They have to line up.  If you wanted IP addresses to communicate without routing in the same range of 192.168.1.10 to 192.168.1.41 you could not use a network of 192.168.1.0 255.255.255.224 (32 addresses/30 hosts). That would give you a range of 192.168.1.0 - 192.168.1.31  You would have to use a subnet that can support all those addresses in a range that works with IPv4 which would be 192.168.1.0 255.255.255.192. This provides a range of 192.168.1.0 to 192.168.1.64 (which covers your range of 192.168.1.10 to 192.168.1.41  And, therefore if you wanted to use a wildcard mask with this subnet it would have to be 0.0.0.63"
ccna,391mu9,0010000100111111,1 point,Mon Jun 8 16:57:55 2015 UTC,"Awesome, thanks for your response. So from my understanding it has to go in blocks. So to restrict 192.168.1.10 to 192.168.1.41 my ACL should read? 192.168.1.10 0.0.0.1 192.168.1.12 0.0.0.3 192.168.1.16 0.0.0.15 192.168.1.32 0.0.0.7 192.168.1.40 0.0.0.1  Is this right?"
ccna,391mu9,0010000100111111,1 point,Tue Jun 9 04:53:39 2015 UTC,To block addresses 192.168.1.10 to 192.168.1.41  These addresses fall into the network of  192.168.1.0 /26 255.255.255.192 This has a range of 192.168.1.0 - 192.168.1.63  So your wildcards are essentially the opposite of your subnet.

ccna,391mu9,0010000100111111,1 point,Tue Jun 9 15:06:53 2015 UTC,"It would restrict the first 64 addresses  However to only restrict the first 10 addresses see what I do here. It may help you understand.  So if we did 192.168.1.0 - 192.168.10  192.168.1.0 /30 (255.255.255.252) has a range of 192.168.1.0 - 192.168.1.3. So we can't use this one. The wildcard mask for this would be 0.0.0.3  Next one on the last (I am doing these for repetition to show you how it works)  192.168.1.0 /29 (255.255.255.248) has a range of 192.168.1.0 - 192.168.1.7.   Wildcard mask for this would be 0.0.0.7  So we can't use this one either. Doesn't cover the address range we want to cover which is 192.168.1.0 - 192.168.1. 10  Next we have:  192.168.1.0 /28 (255.255.255.240) Which has a range of 192.168.1.0 - 192.168.1.15  Oh look! it covers all the addresses we want to block (and a few extras)   So the wildcard mask is 0.0.0.15  So if we apply this wildcard mask to the network of 192.168.1.0 then it would block 192.168.1.0 - 192.168.1.15  Now, like vlsm, we could use this wildcard mask again to block 16 addresses  So say we wanted to block the next 16 addresses after 192.168.1.15  We would do 192.168.1.16 with a wildcard mask of 0.0.0.15 which would block addresses 192.168.1.16 to 192.168.1.31"

ccna,391mu9,parcel621,1 point,Wed Jun 10 05:03:36 2015 UTC,My acl read something like this:  192.168.1.10 0.0.0.1  192.168.1.12 0.0.0.3  192.168.1.16 0.0.0.15  192.168.1.32 0.0.0.7  192.168.1.40 0.0.0.1

You could accomplish this with a 0.0.0.63 wildcard mask."

The bits that are on are ignored by the router, the buts that are off must match.  0.0.0.31 is [...]0.00011111  So any IP with the same first three bits in the last octet will be matched.

Feel free others to interject if I'm way off base (I need practice explaining things)   I look at wildcard masks as an inverse subnet mask.. So lemme ask you this.. Can you have a network 192.168.1.10 255.255.255.224?  If you are having trouble understanding what I'm asking, you might want to revisit subnetting, Specifically VLSM.

ccna,391mu9,chuckbales,2,Mon Jun 8 17:02:51 2015 UTC,"I look at wildcard masks as an inverse subnet mask   Be careful, as this isn't the actual definition of a wildcard mask. Wildcard's don't have the same rules to follow like a netmask (mostly they don't need to have all 0's continuous before all 1's, like a netmask needs all 1's before all 0's.) This means 0.255.0.255 is a valid wildcard to use, where 255.0.255.0 is obviously an invalid netmask."

ccna,391mu9,chuckbales,1 point,Mon Jun 8 17:34:06 2015 UTC,"Hi, thanks for pointing that out. Under what circumstances would someone use a wildcard mask like the valid one you just mentioned (0.255.0.255)?"
ccna,391mu9,0010000100111111,3,Mon Jun 8 18:13:50 2015 UTC,"The only time I personally have used it has been for matching multiple discontiguous subnets with a single ACL. An example would be a common multi-site VLAN setup, each site gets a /16, with /24s broken out per VLAN. Say you wanted to match VLAN 20 (10.x.20.0/24) for 30 sites. You could use a wildcard to match that subnet at all 30 sites, with a single ACE.  Something like:  permit ip any 10.0.20.0 0.255.0.255  Which would match anything 10.x.20.x - 10.7.20.4, 10.8.20.3, 10.50.20.192, etc. I've used this before where a certain vendor needed access to a subnet at each site, but only that subnet (like a SCADA monitoring system), and the customer had something like 50 locations. Rather than build 50 lines, one for each site's SCADA subnet, the single wildcard statement could be used to cover it.  Unfortunately its an IOS-only feature, ASA's don't support wildcards."

Expect a mix of 'look around' simulations (access simulated hardware, poke around to see how things are configured) and maybe 1 or 2 (per test) actual configuration simulations (as in, enter commands to change settings). 3: ICND1 gets you the not-very-valuable CCENT cert, which is good for (I think) 3 years.

For labs - they're just a quick google away - and usually no need to pay for locks of hardware you might not use again, software sims like GNS3 have come a LONG way and even Packet Tracer 6.2 is good enough for most of the CCNA series exams,  Head over to the Cisco website and check out the fundamental topics you need specifically for the exam you're aiming to take, and study study study. Make the time, book your exam for a reason date (say a month away).  It all depends on how much real world experience you have as to how long you should study for too - your 3 months looks good!

ACL's might be involved, if there is some filtering occurring between networks (if you're connecting your network to a customer network, you're hopefully performing filtering somewhere).  Inter-vlan routing is just that - routing between VLANs. On a layer-3 link between sites, you're not passing VLANs, so its not inter-vlan routing - its just routing."

What connects subnets? A router. Most likely, with a leased line, two routers (and a third network between them).  Those could be blocking whatever ports RDP uses in several ways. Access lists, a firewall somewhere, etc."

We use 172.21.0.0 they use 172.16.0.0, how do you set up port forwarding on a Cisco Router for RDP (Port 3389). So that the router allows us to remote in even though we are on seperate networks/subnets."

While I was in school I joined the university co-op program, and after a university arranged interview, I got selected for a paid three semester rotation with a trucking company in their IT department. I did this in order to gain my first experience in the field. After graduation, I got hired as a technician (based on my degree and co-op job experience) at a rural ISP doing anything from residential cable runs and DSL installs, to provisioning central office DSLAM's, layer 2 switches, and PBX's. Worked there for about 1.5 years, and then eventually moved on to a PC Technician job at a local hospital, which really turned out to be more of a systems admin role for less than half the pay. During those first few years out of college, I began to realize I really liked networking, and that there was a lot more money in it with less interaction with end users. I did a lot of desktop support, and learned to interact with various types of end-users which proved to be invaluable.  I also did a great deal of server administration, but I just didn't enjoy that as much as networking. While I was working my hospital PC technician job (worked there for 1.5 years), I began studying for my CCNA after I got home from work in the evenings. It took me about a year of hard work to eventually pass both tests. After I passed the CCNA, I began shooting out my resume to any job in the area that I thought might have a dedicated networking group, because I was tired of being an IT generalist, and I began to understand that it was a very frustrating and low paying career path. I eventually found a job posting for the job I have now, applied, and I got hired 6 months ago.

It's a step on the ladder for something you already want to do  Working a helpdesk is a useful experience, but not the be all and end all. You get to understand how to talk to users, how to decode what their problem is vs what they report. For example ""I can't print"" == Local power outage in the building  I loved my time on the helpdesk, I but it's a tough job. Nothing you do is right. A user never rings to say thank you, an incident is never passed back with praise, you never escalate something to someone who's happy to receive the ticket. Every interaction you have is because something is wrong somewhere. But, it can teach a lot. Likewise with desktop support. Less tough than helpdesk, because you're the hero coming to fix the users' workstation (or whatever). There's a lot more thanks in it, and it's also pretty rewarding, but there's a whole bunch of skills over and above the technical stuff that it'll teach you too  You might be surprised at the skillsets you end up unwittingly learning and using over time. And, it'll all be brilliant  Basically, take any and every opportunity that comes up, and you'll do alright"

Some of it was right place at the right time - Nobody was expecting any kind of skillset from a helpdesk bod (sorry helpdesk people, but that's the assumption. Doesn't always make it true). It's far easier to be promoted from within with no certifications, a little experience, and a lot of drive/enthusiasm than it is to apply for something new without anything to back up what you say you can do  Thing was, this was a little company at the time, less than 250 staff, so there were more opportunities than at a 50k employing multinational would present  When I decided the company was going in a direction I didn't want to, I had over a decade of experience (still no certs) which was on my side to apply for my new, none-network-related, role  In my opinion, certification gets you the interview and experience gets you the job  I obviously don't know your situation. But, maybe try applying for things which are a little below what you're after (in the hierarchy point of view) and work up from within  Personally, I'd not expect to be able to work on a helpdesk in a larger company and work up the ranks.

I got to 21 (5 years in the industry) and had no idea what i wanted to do, i checked out other peoples job titles & asked them about their roles. Pretty much settled on an Infrastructure Architect / Design role as my goal.  I assessed my skillset versus what the people i'd spoken to had, and followed some of their recommendations,  I moved and took an Infrastructure job, expressed an interest in networking (only theoretical until this point) and a few months over our network guy went on a 2 month holiday, i covered - he never came back - i took over.  I've been at the company nearly 2 years, and have 16 months of Cisco routing/switching/mpls/asa/ravpn/s2svpn and implemented a 1600 user VoIP platform on a total userbase of 2000 users across 100 locations."
ccna,38stgr,oouter,1 point,Sat Jun 6 20:17:43 2015 UTC,"I think that I qualify as a network engineer from what I've been reading in this thread. So my Junior year of High School my cousin (who was a senior in high school at the time) said that I could work for the local WISP that he worked for. I went ahead and did it, at the time it was just 5-6 people doing installs for homes and businesses. At the time all we could offer was 1 or 2 mbps (limitation of point to multipoint wireless at the time).  So I spent most of my time that I wasn't in school crawling on roofs, eye-balling wireless shots, and learning basic router configs.  After a couple of years of that, I still had very little idea of networking but knew all about our physical network. So I mostly began managing our physical network (setting up new AP's, constructing new sites, etc.) and just troubleshooting miscellaneous issues with people's/businesses to our networks.  Eventually started going to college for Physics/Comp Sci (had no idea what I actually wanted out of it) while still going back home during summers and extended breaks to continue working for the same company. At about this time the ISP began getting into the Fiber Optic business. For awhile was on construction crew for that.  Fast forward to 3.5 years through college, had also been working as an aide for the CS department's lab (basically IT), had been doing ok but reasons stacked up and dropped out. through talks with the sysadmin at the college I had been piecing together a lot of the details that I didn't get through working in the field at the ISP, so when I came back (didn't want to look for work after dropping out, hard to say no to guaranteed job) I was able to show off some more skills that I had been gaining. ""hey guys i can handle messing with our Cisco Switches and am figuring out our routers"". Time skip to 8ish months ago. Our network/sysadmin said ""hey ive found a different job. local127, you can handle my stuff right?""  At the time I was pretty excited for the posotion and here I am. Had previous tech on call for a couple  of months as I acclimated. After getting I position I got a couple of low level certs from our router's manufacturer and am now lazily working towards ccna and beyond. I think I am basically ready to take it, but just need to schedule it and then study up.  TL;DR: got job doing basic installer stuff in high school for WISP, stuck with company in off time, dropped out of college, eventually became net admin for Fiber/wireless ISP. No certs/formal relevant education for anything until after got position.  Also should mention that this is a small town ISP (if that wasn't obvious)"

Got out and got a job at best buy geek squad. Always been a computer kid/guy. Just knew how to do a lot and could comprehend almost anything computer related extremely well.   Worked at BBGS for almost 2 years. Started my degree at ITT Tech for a Bachelor in Information Systems Security. Left BBGS for a job I found on Craigslist to join a growing company that just started using a ticketing system and realized the need for way more people. Worked as an hourly paid employee there while finishing my degree.   During that time I learned a lot and I have zero certifications. Just got my hands on to as much as I could at work and showed an interest in networking related things and started helping out with routers and servers and such. Graduated my Bachelor and then got hired salary and became a network infrastructure engineer for the same company. They started an infrastructure team and I'm one of a few that were chosen. I was in that position for a little over a year and started focusing a lot on security instead of CLI stuff.   Last February I because the first network security engineer for my company ever. I'm now a key decision maker for a $5bil company and am growing every day. I'm in charge of writing the first ever security policy for the company and everything.

I had done ICND1 material via a local community college partnered with NetAcad in the fall of 2013. I never tested. My job offered to set me up with CBTNuggets and books for the full CCNA so I jumped on it. I did think ICND2 was more challenging then ICND1 but it was likely due to so much hands on with ICND1 material via NetAcad. We did stuff in ICND1 that never came up in any of the CBTNuggets or the Odom books. I would say ICND1 was a 7/10 and the ICND2 was a 8.5/10. Good luck.  My test was a good mixture of Frame Relay and what felt like a metric crap ton of STP. Oh and there were 2 questions on material that was never covered in the books or CBTs at all. Questions about ... well I am not sure if i can say. Needless to say this was agitating.

Cisco wants students to learn its hardware; the more people familiar with it, the more hardware is sold.  Morally, I think it's less of an issue than music or movies.  Cisco doesn't lose the revenue of someone using an emulated system for learning; it's when GNS3 is used in place of baremetal in your office that they do."

They are mostly cisco but have a smattering of other offerings in the infrastructure. People were notified months out that their jobs were on the lines. Yes some people trained replacements but this was in the QA departement. Net eng got outsourced about a decade ago. I'm leaving soon, not because of career longevity but because of broken processes and aweful engineering pushes from management. I basically have to break the rules when deploying because the mandates by management make it impossible otherwise. They also low ball their perm positions compared to market rates. A lot of the top engineers I work with are looking for an out, except those that are fully vested in the original retirement system(which they don't hand out anymore.)  They play games. Being an engineer I'm not interested in politics. But they live and breath it here. I want to spend the day building networks, not figuring the latest broken change procedure because you didn't bother asking the engineers who use it.  I know you can't prove I work here.

ccna,38l0q5,crouthamela,10,Fri Jun 12 18:18:54 2015 UTC,"So I got really interested in routing, specifically earning the CCNA, when I first saw OSPF solve a communication problem for us at work. I had no idea what OSPF was, or what it did, but the tech walked in, checked a couple of things, said ""OSPF is not in effect"" typed something, and the system was working again. I was impressed.  This was about two years ago. And I started my studying then for the CCNA.  I posted here about two years because I didn't understand Ethernet the protocol and I felt lost reading it referenced all the time in beginning chapters.   My knowledge of networking consisted of knowing the ping did, fabricate cat5e/6 and fiber connectors, and that IP Addresses were important for machines to talk.   Anyways, I purchased Odom's books, INCD1 & 2. I had a co-worker who has his CCNA, and I would try to pick his brain, but he told me he used brain dumps and couldn't provide much help. I did take his CBT nuggets videos though, and those were useful.   So fast forward a year, of me just reading these books, watching the videos and lurking here and /r/networking. I return to the states, and enroll in school, Networking Specialist Program. The program provides the perk of offering CCNA Security, and Server 2012 courses, along with A+ and Sec+.   I was hoping that my previous degree an associates in applied science, Electronic Technology would allow me to cut the fat of the program, and move onto the meat of it, but the admin people and guy who decides to take your English, Math and other electives from previous schooling was a prick, and said no. (I went to an accredited school, and this one is accredited as well.   So I'm in the Netacad program, I purchase the CCNA videos from Chris Bryant (A really sweet deal, like he offered 80% off for it and free CCNA security videos), and I watch any youtube video posted here, and read any blog.   And I went to deep into this. I spent a crazy amount of time taking into memory all the different frames. I would walk around and pretend I was teaching a class about how the ethernet frame is broken up into, with the preamble, the number of bytes, what it does. How destination address is before source address, followed by the VLAN. Then there is the type, data, and a CRC.   The OSPF packet has type, length, router ID, Area ID, Checksum and Au, and then authentication.   I got stupid into it.   What's more, I would lurk in CCNP and CCIE areas, and get distracted in those things. I would lurk in /r/networking and see a link like ""NetCrunch 8.7 released with flow analytics, sFlow and Cisco NBAR support added (Also, Legos)"" and think Holy Shit, I need to understand some of these things.   I had difficultly eating the elephant one bite a time. Motivation wasn't the problem, I just had to tame it, reel it in.   Some complaints about this entire process.   I really wish CBT nuggets had better pricing and plans. I will not spend a $100 a month to access all of the content they provide, which is a ton. It's seriously an overkill. Maybe $10 a month for access to a course, maybe $17 for two courses. I don't know something. HBO and Netflix provide quality original content and I can access everything they offer at a cheaper price.   The brain dumps. It motivated me to take this seriously, because I don't want to say I'm CCNA qualified, and not be able to answer how to read the routing table. But it sucks that the person who used a brain dump has his CCNA, and can say he has a minimum of three years experience in that world. I know he is not the only one.   Netacad. Those answers are online for the chapter tests as well, which is a bummer. I do get satisfaction though from the students who had 100% in the course, and absolutely bombed the hands on portion final exam. I may, or may not have looked up to see screens in front of me, and watch people struggle to access a router because they didn't know how the console cable worked, or how to grab devices and place them on packet tracer. The class gets smaller every semester, I hope it continues until people want to actually work on it.   More on Netacad. I really wish they had more packet tracers. I wish there tons of already built networks, with a trouble tickets saying ""Host A can't do this. Fix it.""   They had a couple, and they way things clicked when you're searching and reading different show commands to solve a problem was fist pumping exciting. It was rewarding to actually solve the problem, then just configure things, which is fun in itself, but still.   Anyways, I'm so pumped up for this still. I have to tell myself I need to crawl, walk and then run before I start comparing myself to the experts in this field.

ccna,38l0q5,katarjin,3,Fri Jun 5 01:17:10 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I think so. I'm confident enough in this to drop a pretty sweet paying job that was boring to go this route. Everything is becoming connected. I have no doubt every appliance in your house will be a smart device, even your fridge will be connected the network. You'll be able to monitor and get updates about the temperature, from different zones in the fridge. You can adjust accordingly to better preserve your food.  With cameras in the fridge, you can view remotely to see if you do in fact need more of an ingredient. The fridge would even be able to send you updates letting you know some produce in the fridge is getting funky, who knows.   Now the fridge is just something unnecessary when you think about it, but it will happen, and this is just one example of your appliance becoming connected to the network. Becoming smarter. And those packets have to travel and there will have to be techs to install, fix any issue.   Businesses need these connections more than ever, and people in their personal life will as well.   So the networking world is not going anywhere.   I hope people who in this field  can chime in, because my only concern in this industry. A great deal can be done remotely.   I want to work in a hospital. So I spend time trying to read up on the technology used there, and what they are doing. They are talking about stethoscopes that collect data from the patient and send it to their records, so if doctors ever need to, they can go back and re-listen, compare, and see if anything was missed. I was reading about how x-rays are taken, sent to another country to be read by a cheaper doctor, and results send back. A lot is being done on to the cloud.   That's all pretty cool, because it gives networking people job security. However I can see a future where so much can be done remotely, people will have less options where they can live and do this job. Why pay techs to monitor a network in some of the highest cost of living cities, when a team can do it remotely and live in cheaper cities- meaning less pay. Sure, a place will need a few IT folks to switch things in and out, send spares out for replacement, and load up pre-config settings to get things going again... but yeah...   My last job, for our network, the networking team lived in a different state, and there were able to handle almost all the issues for different sites around the country. I worry those NOCs can be moved to where labor is even cheaper, in foreign countries... Of course it won't all move, there is sensitivity and places like finance, any latency means millions lost. But I feel like it's a job that can be outsourced kind of easily...   It's a great question. Maybe you can ask in /r/networking or something.   Bottom line about this networking- it's not glamorous. You won't pick up chicks up at the bar drawing Dijkstra's algorithm on a napkin. It can be very dry, and sometimes even boring. It's always changing, so you have to stay on top of it. You have to have a thirst for knowledge that cannot be quenched. And you have to be a quiet professional, because I doubt anyone outside your team will every award you or recognize you for doing a job well done.   With that said, this is about as cool as it gets."
ccna,38l0q5,troweigh,2,Fri Jun 5 05:12:38 2015 UTC,"Ahh yeah, the internet of everything, which means installing further points of failure on everything. I've heard of things like pacemakers being remotely shut-off for awhile on places like /r/netsec. I guess there's no point in worrying about what can and can't be outsourced because nobody can predict the future. I'm not a big fan of /r/Futurology, but if they are to be believed then everybody will be on UBI without a job in another decade or two.   Well I've worked help desk for a few years and I was a cable guy for a little bit as well, which was really interesting to see how ISP's ""do it"" so to speak. Mostly it was me crawling around in peoples attics or crawlspaces, or throwing a 32 ft ladder up on some midspan somewhere and hoping I didn't fall -- that job constantly reminded me of this XKCD comic and it was a lot of fun, but not very technically challenging.  And to your last point I'm not worried at all, I've already met the love of my life and she thinks what I do is amazing even though she doesn't understand any of it. She doesn't even know how much of a neophyte I am! Jokes on her I suppose.  Anyway, thanks again for all the helpful information. I'd never seen this subnetting questions site for example."

ccna,38huvk,Dj0rk,3,Thu Jun 4 16:26:13 2015 UTC,"Find an entry level job and work your ass off.  Having certifications for certifications sake is only going to be looked at as padding.  The tests on the easy certs prove you can read a book and regurgitate the requested information, work experience shows you can be thrown into a situation, not lose your head, and resolve issues quickly.    Don't get me wrong, the right certs will get you looked at, but if the next thing out of your mouth is ""This is the first IT job I've ever had"" you'll be punted out the door or hear the phrase ""We'll let you know when we've decided"""
ccna,38huvk,popz2049,-1,Thu Jun 4 17:10:38 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the advice bro. Well I expect to get an entry level job and work my way up fron there. I was just a little bit got addicted on getting certs, I dont think it would hurt, so I was looking for certs that are worth my time"
ccna,38huvk,ModularPersona,1 point,Thu Jun 4 17:36:23 2015 UTC,"The certs worth your time will be the ones that directly relate to your job function.  I'm a networking guy, so I'm not going to go out of my way to get a cert on Apple hardware just because it is easy.  You're going to find you niche in the IT field and it may not be what my niche is (and really, thats the best thing about this field).  But if you load up before having that work experience it just shows that you're chasing initials.  I distinctly remember two situations where having a cert meant nothing:    1) 2013 - They hired a guy with his CCNP to be on the network team with us.  Gave him a project to redesign a site (Needed segmentation because it was flat-vlaned) he configured ROAS to the WAN router for all 50 new vlans.  This site had 300 people and 75% of the traffic stayed local.  When we asked him why he didn't put the DG's on the 4500 his response was ""This is the way it says to do it in the book.""  At the time I didn't have my CCNA but had been doing site redesigns for 4+ years, and I knew better. 2) 2004ish - Hired a MCSA to help with server administration and they gave him a project to spin up a new Domain Controller and join it to the forest.  He got as far as getting DHCP/DNS installed and configured before he re-addressed the entire site with 10.0.0.0/8 IP's in a 172.16.0.0/16 world.  Didn't tell anyone.  Blamed it on the helpdesk.  We took the flak until it was found that he screwed it up.  His excuse ""Thats the steps I followed in the Cram book that I used to pass the exam"". I wish you all the best in the world, I really do, but you need to start focusing on getting the experience now.  Just because it says to do it one way in the book doesn't mean that how you'd do it in the field.  Hell, the CCNA has you walking through subnetting.  And in the field I wouldn't be surprised if 75% of designers use a cheatsheet.  I know I did in the past.  I'd still use it if I wasn't an Instructor."
ccna,38huvk,jtwizzy,1 point,Thu Jun 4 23:43:46 2015 UTC,"I agree with what Dj0rk said, and would add that the Certs are great but the entry level certs are just the tip of the iceberg. If you put in the work to get all the certs you have you should have a good foundation, move to a more advance cert such as CCNP. Interviewers can tell your skill set based on the level of detail and the mention of variables that are beyond the scope of CCNA and entry level certs. So if you go into an interview and have a true CCNP level of understanding you will get that entry level job easily."
ccna,38huvk,BroadStreet_Bully3,3,Thu Jun 4 18:18:48 2015 UTC,"Don't be a cert warrior. Having 20 entry level certs on our resume doesn't make it look better, it makes it look worse because of all the useless crap that's on there. No one cares about the dozen Microsoft MTA and HP ATA certs you picked up in school (I say this as someone with multiple MTAs and ATAs). It may even make some people question your thought process (does this guy think that all he needs are certs?). What you have is fine. With a Sec+ your resume will be close to as impressive as it's going to get without work experience.  With that being said, an MCSA and RHCSA can widen your skillset and add value to your resume. Server knowledge - Linux, especially - is always good, and being an MCP is desirable to Microsoft partners.  Further ways of padding your resume include doing volunteer IT work (you can't put down family tech support in your resume but you could list volunteer experience), listing social groups and activities you're involved in (employers need to know that you will be able to get along with people), and tinkering with a homelab and listing it under your interests/hobbies (and being able to talk about it during an interview).   I also see a lot of people recommending the CCNP, and I have to disagree. At this point in your career it's not going to do anything for you that your CCNA doesn't already do. CCNPs are usually working in senior network engineer/architect positions and you're not getting that job with no experience. It's also not likely to push you ahead in the line for help desk or NOC jobs, either - they'll take someone with experience before taking the zero experience certlord.   Finally, never underestimate the importance of soft skills and personal contacts."

ccna,38jper,IronPacketMonkey,1 point,Fri Jun 5 00:44:18 2015 UTC,For ccna. I wouldn't use gns3 at all except for GLPB.   I would use packet tracer for literally everything. Can't think of a single advantage to gns over PT at ccna level. Can think of many disadvantages.
ccna,38jper,DeeJayMaps,1 point,Thu Jun 4 18:33:04 2015 UTC,For frame-relay and routing I would strongly suggest GNS3 over PT.
ccna,38jper,PsychoMet,0,Thu Jun 4 20:13:03 2015 UTC,"I'd say frame relay is pretty much identical in both.   For ccna I think packet tracer is best because it keeps you in house on a single application. Gns and pt take skill to learn the program. That's overhead that burns study time.   While I'll admit that gns does route better (because it's actually IOS), it's a shit ton of work to get started on. Building topologies is slow. Troubleshooting involves checking gns, qemu, and others.   For ccnp. It's critical. At ccna. Why burn time?"
ccna,38jper,DeeJayMaps,1 point,Fri Jun 5 05:31:52 2015 UTC,I don't think it's so much hassle to make it work as you are describing. It took me 30 mins to make it work by watching youtube videos. And for the CCNA exercises you are hardly going to need more than 3 routers. Routing over frame-relay is sh*t in PT.
ccna,38jper,PsychoMet,0,Fri Jun 5 09:40:56 2015 UTC,I'll bite.   How is pt and gns different with regards to FR?
ccna,38jper,DeeJayMaps,1 point,Fri Jun 5 13:06:02 2015 UTC,"From the top of my head, you can't configure point-to-multipoint ospf interface in PT. PT doesn't support it."
ccna,38jper,PsychoMet,1 point,Fri Jun 5 13:16:55 2015 UTC,(1) frame relay is old. I'm not even sure why it's on ccna.   (2) just configure it as a broadcast network. PT doesn't support a single command in FR. Big deal. The idea is remembering the command when you use it In the real world. (Which will probably never happen).
ccna,38jper,DeeJayMaps,1 point,Fri Jun 5 13:38:48 2015 UTC,"(1) I am wondering the same thing. It's also in CCNP. But the base concept of frame relay will help you understand MPLS easier, imho.  (2) That works but does't give much room for experimenting different things to see what works, what doesn't and why.  Though I somewhat I agree with you, you shouldn't negate the power of GNS so easily. It's still very valuable for learning and experimenting, not only for exams but for understanding the basic principles and concepts."

ccna,38jf57,CannibalAngel,1 point,Thu Jun 4 21:03:20 2015 UTC,"Biggest benefit of taking two is more focused studying.  You know what each exam will cover and you only have to look at one set of material.    Biggest benefit of taking one is the fact that it's over in one.  Really, saving $5.00 isn't worth it.  I took 200-120 because I had spent years in the field, doing configs and design day in and day out.  I bombed it twice (a lot had to do with my study techniques then).  Once I ironed out some issues and really focused I passed with 917.    If this if your first go round, take the two.

ccna,38h07c,rxanderq,2,Thu Jun 4 03:44:35 2015 UTC,Befoe you can obtain the CCDA you have to pass the CCENT.. CCDA is all design so I would recommend passing CCNA first because you'll have the foundation down. Some other people will have different opinions on this... Also if you decide to go onto CCNP after passing the CCNA and CCDA you'll only have to take one exam to become CCDP.
ccna,38h07c,-JediPenguin-,2,Thu Jun 4 04:36:32 2015 UTC,"Quite frankly, the CCDA is an exam worth considering only for Cisco Partners (it's required to achieve ""Premier"" level partnership) and senior engineers that are involved in building networks from the ground up.  Depending on your particular skillset and background, i would wholeheartedly disagree that it's an easy exam.   It containts a lot of cisco's hivemind speak and it covers designing networks (which is something a junior technician still tackling CCNA definitely isn't involved with).   Overall, i disagree with your mentor and i suggest you focus on finishing your CCNA if this is a career path you are interested in."
ccna,38h07c,1karmik1,1 point,Thu Jun 4 09:10:14 2015 UTC,"I'm going to second that. After my ccna, I was hoping just to land bother cert while I was on vacation in celebration. I took about a week reading through the cert guide thinking a lot of it sounded easy.   I took a shot at the Pearson practice exams and Bombed. It's much harder than people give it credit for. It's only really worthwhile once you have higher certs, to be honest.   It's all theory no application. (It's not like typing in command line). You've really got to know that theory inside and out. And the test cover quite a bit of tech theory on top of design theory. If you can't subnet, for get the CCDA.   I'm honestly not even sure the value of the cert unless you have experience or higher certs to back it up."
ccna,38h07c,DeeJayMaps,1 point,Thu Jun 4 12:58:11 2015 UTC,"I recommend waiting until you have your CCNP. It's mostly an add-on for positions that are engineering level.   The best part of the cert is that after you have a CCNP, you take one more test (besides the CCDA) and you have your CCDP.   Get your CCNA knocked out first, then figure out what is truly interesting to you. For instance I spent 90% of my time working on CUCM, UCCX, etc so I went the voice route. But now I'm back into more datacenter stuff now and am focusing on that. CCDA sounds awesome, but it's a late level cert and not as easy as it seems."
ccna,38fmxa,jupeepamintuan,1 point,Wed Jun 3 22:08:58 2015 UTC,"As most people will you tell you you can get everything done in Packet Tracer and GNS3.  If you really want to have a physical lab I would suggest building it yourself. You can find  most of the equipment used for really cheap. For router the Cisco 2611 or 2621 is a really good option. For switches Cisco 2950 or Cisco 3550 (a little more $$$ but layer 3). You can get 2 routers and 2 switches for $100-150. Make sure you get a console cable, ethernet cables, serial cables. Monoprice has really good prices on cables and Amazon isn't bad either."
ccna,38fmxa,Spoonska,1 point,Wed Jun 3 22:58:28 2015 UTC,"Seconding getting everything done for ccna on gns and PT.   PT actually does everything but GLBP.   If your getting real equipment. Focus on switches.   To do a switching lab properly, you really need 3 switches.   I'd try for a 3750 for your 'main' switch. If that's too much, the 3560 is a good second best. It just doesn't support stack wise and a handful of other things that are only mildly important to ccnp.   For your other switches, I've seen lots of recommendations. 3550. 2950. Depends on your budget. The 2950 won't do any of your l3 stuff. 3550 will. However it doesn't support IPv6.   I don't think vpc in gns support IPv6 now that I think about It.

Thay would definitely work for people with different resources.  This is certainly a situation in which there's multiple solutions.  For business use (I'm just upgrading my home lab in anticipation of doing CCNA Wireless or another specialty) using a router as the host has some advantages. It's low maintenance, no moving parts, and you can probably use a leftover router that's been removed from service elsewhere. Dont' need anything high-end.  I've got an entire CentOS box that I use as an expensive version of this for terminal access to the PBX that is the core of my current job. Were it not for some political reasons, I might try to get permission to cut it over to a spare cable on an existing console server to simplify things."

Its not too bad to setup but you will end up having to rely on remote hands to move cables and God help you if you don't document layer 1.

I'll keep the topic updated if there's interest.  The idea is to minimize the annoyance factor of switching the console cable between devices in a lab. If it's a pain, it makes the student (me) less willing to work with it, and thus less likely to study. I'm considering a couple options for post-CCNA R/S options and I think I'll want some physical hardware, especially for Wireless, which I am considering."

ccna,38d4o8,DeeJayMaps,1 point,Wed Jun 3 16:12:05 2015 UTC,Well the ASYNC module works pretty well with basically all cisco gear. Or anything that supports serial connections as a configuration method which is a fairly decent amount of hardware.  For something like a server or some other hardware that doesn't support serial you might want some kind of KVM solution.
ccna,38d4o8,douchecanoo,1 point,Wed Jun 3 16:25:55 2015 UTC,I did this for my lab using a free slot on my 2811. I found an NM-32a ASYNC module on ebay and grabbed a couple octal cables. Once its all cabled up configuration on the router is basically just setting up a loopback and a couple host entries to telnet to the local line # that corresponds to the ASYNC cable you want to work with.   For example:  interface Loopback0  ip address 1.1.1.1 255.255.255.255  ip host asa1 2073 1.1.1.1 ip host switch1 2072 1.1.1.1 ip host router1 2069 1.1.1.1  line 1/0 1/31  no exec  transport input all  flowcontrol hardware
ccna,38d4o8,DeeJayMaps,2,Wed Jun 3 14:59:59 2015 UTC,"Oh! So it's done via loopback addresses? I figured you had to log in to the 'host' router and use some command I wasn't familiar with to grab the serial line kind of like using a linux box and grabbing /dev/com2 or whatever.  I ended up getting an NM-32a as well. It was cheaper than a NM-16A and while I doubt I'll need more than 4-6 devices, it should handle a ridiculous number just in case."

ccna,3886ww,justsoap,7,Tue Jun 2 15:24:04 2015 UTC,"The way I've always described it to friends is like this: Consider yourself a mechanic. Network+ is a broad scope of the entire car. CCENT, CCNA, CCNP etc... are the engine.  In your Network+ class (or book) a topic, OSPF for example will be limited to ""OSPF is a routing protocol and here are some fun facts like administrative cost, metrics and area info"". In CCENT strap in for a ton of material on how routers are elected, how LSAs work, how OSPF if different from RIPv2 etc...   I got my Network + in November and I recently got my CCENT last month. There are overlapping topics like: OSI Model, Ethernet standards, Common protocols and services, and subnetting. However, in my experience the overlap is only equal to about 1/4 of the material that's covered in the CCENT.   Honestly, I've had a lot of people tell me that getting a Network + and a CCENT wasn't a good idea because they cover similar topics and they are close to being equivalent in the eyes of a future employer. That may be, but being someone who didn't know a lot about networks before hand I don't think I would have gone any other route. The information you're going to cover in Network + is going to roll you right into the stuff you'll be studying for CCENT.  Good luck on your journey. If you really enjoy networks like I do you're going to have a lot of fun.   Also, I'm not sure if this info will be helpful but for quick perspective...Like I said I got my Net + in November. I took the Net Academy CCENT pre-course test in January and made a 46%. I wouldn't recommend Net Academy though. I personally didn't like it.  TL;DR: CCENT and Network+ does have some overlapping topics, but CCENT is going to go much more in depth than Network +. What you learn in Network+ is going to really give you a boost when you start studying for CCENT."
ccna,3886ww,Spoonska,2,Tue Jun 2 17:28:19 2015 UTC,Thanks for the info.  One thing I have noticed when looking at job postings is they either ask for network+ or ccna so I figure with the network+ I might have a little more success passing hr until I can finish the full ccna.

It doesn't even reach a human until it passes this screening.  I've heard of people putting the job listing in the background making them the same color as the paper (white). Ensuring that they get through the first screening
ccna,388b6k,duckgrapes,1 point,Tue Jun 2 23:07:39 2015 UTC,"From my experience as a hiring manager, the problem seemed to be affirmative action laws.  If a resume reached a live human being, and that human being decided the person wasn't what the company was looking for then there needed to be paperwork done explaining why the person wasn't considered so that should the company be audited they could clearly show that a candidate wasn't rejected due to some discriminatory practice.  Now put that into play when hiring for a position where you can expect hundreds of resumes to come in for and you quickly see the need to automate the filtering out process as much as humanly possible.  So yeah, you come up with a number of must have requirements that are automatically screened for and any application that comes up short is immediately rejected without a human ever seeing it.  It really, really sucks as you miss out on the opportunity to consider unique/innovative candidates that aren't following the same career paths as the rest of the herd.  It makes your business bland.  My previous company implemented a system like this after being taken to task by an affirmative action audit for not keeping good enough records.  This was a company owned by a minority, whose executive staff was 75% female/minority, and whose employee staff was heavy minority/veteran... In a small down with a 95% white population.  We should have been the poster child for diverse hiring in that area.  And don't get me started on interviewing requirements.. ugh"

ccna,386ltn,xatt16,3,Tue Jun 2 05:41:18 2015 UTC,"If I understand correctly, think of it like this:  Assume you know the network address and the subnet mask. Let's use 10.0.0.0/25 because it's just complex enough to be interesting.  /25 means 25 bits. That's 8+8+8+1. So:  10.0.0.0  8 8 8 1   So, for this example (which is reasonably useful for an internal subnet plan) we know that all of the first three octets (10.0.0) and the 1st bit of the last octet are the network, and the 7 remaining bits (32-35 = 7) are the Host bits.  How many hosts per network?  2n-2 is the formula for this. Which comes up to 126. Let's do it another way:  If all 8 bits were available, we know the last octet would be 0-255 because that's all the possible values for an IP octet. 0 is the network number, 255 is broadcast, so that's 256-2 or 254 possible values.   We're taking away 1 bit from that, the left-most highest value bit.  Think of this chart:     128 64 32 16 8 4 2 1  You wrote this on your scrap paper, right? If not, do so.   So. If we're using all 8 bits (a /24 mask) the math is easy. 256 possible addresses, 2 reserved. 10.0.0.0 starts one network, 10.0.1.0 the next. And so on.   But that's too easy. We're serious network professionals here. Let's do a /25 because heck yeah you should be slamming some Dew right now, this is exciting.  /25 steals one more bit from the last octet. So your network range shrinks by 128 because that's the value of that poor stolen bit. What's left over is 128 options, with 2 'special' so 126 hosts per subnet.   So your first network would be 10.0.0.0 as the network. What's the broadcast? 10.0.0.127. Which is 128 more (the network increment! YOur next subnet is 10.0.0.128 through 10.0.0.255. Then 10.0.1.0 through 10.0.1.127. Etc.   /25 gives you a lot of reasonably sized subnets."

ccna,386ltn,Not_Hulk_Hogan,2,Wed Jun 3 02:29:52 2015 UTC,"Start with the prefix notation. Ignore subnet masks for a while.  When you see a prefix.... say /26. That means 26 bits define the network and 6 are free to define the host.   6 bits allows for 64 different numbers. Two of these are reserved though so only 62 hosts. (The first 26 bits will be the same for every host).   Now in dotted decimal the 26th bit is in the last of the 4 octets since its more than 24. (8 × 3). This means the first three octets do not change for any host on the network. Lets say those octets are 167.34.6.   In the last octet you have 64 possible numbers, because two of the 8 bits are being used as network bits... again leaving 6 host bits. Thats your block size and I am assuming thats what you mean by network increment.   This means one network could be addresses that end in 0 to 63, then the next one would be 64 to 127. Etc   Then you just have to remember the networks are refferred to by the first ip. So.that 64 to 127 is the 167.64.6.64 network. Its first usable host is .65 and its last is .126"

I have read through Lammle's book and I am currently employed as a network engineer and as such have gained a lot of knowledge on the job.  With that background I find Jeremy's videos at CBT Nuggets to be nearly perfect for me, but for someone coming at this material completely green I think there would be too many gaps to use that material alone.  Chris Bryant's videos at Udemy are also really, really good (and affordable!), but move quite a bit slower than the CBT Nuggets ones.  That is not a bad thing at all.  It depends on where you are at and what you need.  For me the best training method has been Lammle's book combined with Nuggets.  I read a section of Lammle's book, then watch the comparable Nuggets video, and then do the written questions at the end of the chapter in Lammle's book and work through the labs.  I find the book and the videos are very complimentary.  It also helps that both Lammle and Jeremy obviously love this stuff and their excitement with the material becomes infectious.

Some of it depends on your role. If you're an IT engineer for the company, you want to do it as cheaply as possible but meat the goal. The sales person from a vendor wants to maximize commission, of course. If you're on the client-side, you realistically need to honestly communicate your real needs (with expansion room) and verify that what they're selling you meets those needs without being overboard.  For example, for the 100 users you mention I might suggest a 48 port switch for each site assuming they're relatively equally distributed. If the switch selected is actually 48+ 2 uplinks (like a Cisco Catalyst 2960X-48FPD-L or similar) that's enough to power 48 'workstations' with PoE for VoIP phones and each phone has a pass-through for a PC. But remember that there's always additions to the number you come up with.  Assume 33 employees per site. Then you need to add:   Printers Servers That one developer who has to have a desktop, a laptop, and a highly suspect machine you have a feeling is his personal mp3 stash. Wireless access points Security gear like cameras, monitoring for UPS systems, etc. IP Enabled toasters   It all adds up. For example, with the above might find it makes more sense to use a different switch platform so you can put two switches at each site. If one blogs, at least you can get the VIPs and infrastructure up while you wait for a replacement.   Also, organizations might try to standardize. I.E. each site might be allocated an XYZ router, an ABC switch, etc. The organization might want to re-use this architecture as often as possible as they're used to them. Need to upgrade IOS? Should be the same process for every site with less chance of a 'surprise' like one site not havign enough free flash to hold the new image."
ccna,384u5q,macbalance,1 point,Tue Jun 2 16:00:00 2015 UTC,"Great info here, well advised, i'd add the following though:  /u/macbalance is correct its bit of an art, you need to really start with identifying 2 things, what you have now - and what you'll have in the short-mid term future.  What you have now: Router: Committed bandwidth on any links/internet connections/WAN etc - this can determine the model of router, low end routers won't have a fast enough backplane to handle 1Gbps links for example.  Switches: Number of ports? PoE needed? How much PoE? Phones tend to use around 7w, a wifi AP might use the full 14w (guesstimating from memory here but its an example). So when selecting your switch from the data-sheets, you can tell how much wattage you're going to require.  Stacking: A lot of cool stuff can be done with stacking, stack power, shared backplanes, less management overhead (5 switches become 1 sorta thing). But stacking is a nice to have, and is pretty expensive for most companies not really needing it.  My advice - get familiar with 2960 (most common Gb capable switch layer 2 switch) data sheets, and 3750 (very common and stackable layer 3 switch) data sheets."

ccna,384u5q,macbalance,1 point,Tue Jun 2 20:26:16 2015 UTC,That's a nice motto! I'm new enough to the field that I tend to work exclusively on current generation kit. New 3750-X's are pimp! And stacked 2960-X's give glorious throughput!
ccna,384u5q,allseed,1 point,Tue Jun 2 21:02:09 2015 UTC,Thanks for the suggestions for the getting familiar with the switches. What about the 3900 Series? Are they very different from 3700? What are some common routers I should familiarize myself with? 1841? 1941? I only know these models due to playing around in packet tracer.
ccna,384u5q,allseed,1 point,Tue Jun 2 22:09:27 2015 UTC,"Yeah the 1900 series routers are a great and popular branch router, 1921,1941's specifically, you can add VDSL modules so that a branch could have a fibre/Ethernet primary line and a DSL backup line.  Would also suggest 897 and 897W integrated services routers for small installations, the basically are small but best of both worlds (router/switch), can have several PoE ports for example.  A good HQ router is a 3800 - generally a 3850 in my experience, they're the kinda thing you can easily put a 1Gb WAN link into, and can also add a redundant power supply unit too.  3900's give abit more power than I've needed so far so i don't know a huge amount about their differences from a 3750.. But i know quite a few of the 3700 series are End of Life now. Cisco is pushing its 4000 series routers big time - and they're pretty epic, but will dint your budget. Generally the newer kit is just bigger, faster, more powerful, more connections, more resiliency - more $$$$"

Any ISR would suffice (you could do it a cheap ASUS router off Newegg, but it won't be as good or reliable as a Cisco).  You can put the phones inline with PCs, so you can effectively eliminate many of them (for this purpose).  One thing is used gear, getting more switch for less cash. ALWAYS wipe the config, delete VLAN.dat, and do ""vtp transparent"" (to kill VTP before it kills your network) before using it in a production environment. This also includes switches you steal from the lab to use for production."

A previous employer, for example, was such that getting through politics was a huge deal... So tough that it was effectively just as hard to get funding for a $100 no-name desktop switch as a new switch that could power a few hundred phones and provide network access for an entire floor of a building. Guess which us peons would rather spend time on?  I feel like it wouldn't hurt if you move a lot of gear around to create a 'decontamination script' to check when bringing gear in-house or moving to a lab environment."

""Write  ACLs that block traffic from the Internet but yet allow all networks to use the Internet except network A.""    I think I may have been interpreting it wrong.  I was thinking of unsolicited HTTP packets entering the networks and traveling to my end devices (which didn't make sense when I thought of it first), but it probably means that it doesn't want anyone requesting from web services from Server 2.  In that case... if I think about DNS services, I could permit DNS traffic coming inbound from Server 3 on R2's F0/1 interface, and deny HTTP packets directed at Server 2.  Or maybe deny DNS from network A heading for Server 3, and deny those same HTTP packets, and finish up with a permit any parameter?    I wish my instructor emailed me back over the weekend.  I hate only having two days of the week to talk to someone who knows what they're doing.  Thank you for reminding me about DNS.  I had completely forgotten about that."
ccna,381wf4,RedCravat,1 point,Mon Jun 1 16:27:11 2015 UTC,"Good Job coming up with DNS, it is very easy to forget about in ACL configuration. I think you are on track with the 'established' parameter. Try googling it for more detail on the correct format.  Also, don't forget about the implicit deny at the end of an ACL. This means that the last configured line should never be a deny."
ccna,381wf4,RedCravat,1 point,Mon Jun 1 22:22:37 2015 UTC,"I thought it just meant that there has to be at least one permit, otherwise everything is denied."

The 'permit any any' is typically stuck last just for this reason.  From the cisco website on ACL's  ""The first match determines whether the Cisco IOS® Software accepts or rejects the packet. Because the Cisco IOS Software stops testing conditions after the first match, the order of the conditions is critical. If no conditions match, the router rejects the packet because of an implicit deny all clause."""

This is done by decoupling the system that makes decisions about where traffic is sent (the control plane) from the underlying systems that forward traffic to the selected destination (the data plane). The inventors and vendors of these systems claim that this simplifies networking.   SDN requires some method for the control plane to communicate with the data plane. One such mechanism, OpenFlow, is often misunderstood to be equivalent to SDN, but other mechanisms could also fit into the concept.

How to Simulate a Break Key Sequence  Break key sequence simulation is useful if your terminal emulator does not support the break key, or if a bug does not allow your terminal emulator to send the correct signal.  Note: The hyperterminal under Windows NT had this behavior in the past.  Complete these steps to simulate a break key sequence:  Connect to the router with these terminal settings:  1200 baud rate  No parity  8 data bits  1 stop bit  No flow control  You no longer see any output on your screen, and this is normal.  Power cycle (switch off and then on) the router and press the SPACEBAR for 10-15 seconds in order to generate a signal similar to the break sequence.
