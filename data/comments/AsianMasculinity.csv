AsianMasculinity,3e35sj,TheSkyIsBeautiful,17,Tue Jul 21 16:31:28 2015 UTC,"I don't think there's a bright-line rule in these situations. If you have enough experience with relationships, you should be able to tell if she's genuinely into you or if she has ulterior/secondary reasons for being with you. I guess you can break it down into a few general factors:    Sex. Is she fucking you on the regular? Does she put up a front? (i.e., ""I want us to build our relationship first before we take it to the next level"" or ""we're not having sex until X-number of dates or until we've been dating for Y-duration""). How does this align with her prior sexual history (if you know about it).  How does she treat you or interact with you around others? Does it appear like she's proud that you're with her? Does she sing your praises, highlight your accomplishments, and/or make you feel like you're important? If you knew the girl before you started dating, does she now have a different ""lifestyle""? What I mean by this is: did her behavior or day-to-day life take a noticeable change after she started dating you? Did she go from a party girl to homebody? Does she no longer hang out with certain people because of their lifestyles?   Does she ever nag you about your job/career?  Did she bring up marriage/children early on in your relationship?    Again, none of these alone would be telling of anything, but these are some signs to watch out for.   Also:     Do we straight up ask them about their past relationships?    I always ask. Not necessarily right at the outset of the relationship, but if I feel like it's got a chance to be serious, this is information I want to know."
AsianMasculinity,3e35sj,thatsreallydumb,7,Tue Jul 21 18:03:25 2015 UTC,"""we're not having sex until X-number of dates or until we've been dating for Y-duration""). How does this align with her prior sexual history (if you know about it).   Girls who grew up in the west (and to a lesser extent third-world girls) are really good at hiding their sexual history. I wouldn't ask them their partner count, as it's probably astronomically high and they're going to lie about it. Just set the litmus test to how much sex you're getting."
AsianMasculinity,3e35sj,-IIII----------IIII-,9,Tue Jul 21 19:22:16 2015 UTC,"True. You can't take what a girl says about her sexual history at face value, it's more useful as an exploratory tool. For example, when I ask a girl about her sexual past, it's not the answer per se that I'm interested in, but rather the manner in which she answers it.   Does she get defensive? ""Pft! You can't ask a girl that!"" ""That's private information and you don't need to know."" ""My past is my past and if it's not an issue for me then it shouldn't be an issue for you."" Bail. Bail on these girls as fast as you can (or at a minimum, wear protection and don't commit).  Does she stammer through an answer? She's likely making up the lie(s) on the spot.   Does she give a straight on point answer? This is pretty rare, and sometimes you won't like the answer you get, but at least she's up front about it."
AsianMasculinity,3e35sj,thatsreallydumb,4,Tue Jul 21 19:59:59 2015 UTC,"This is a good set of rules to follow, my advice OP would just be to follow your gut. If shit stinks...then the shit stinks.  I personally just stay wary of westernized Asian women in general just because I've been burned way to many times in the past myself, don't ever let someone use you as their backup plan"
AsianMasculinity,3e35sj,THE_YELLOW_BANNER,10,Tue Jul 21 18:12:39 2015 UTC,"I don't think there are any hard and fast rules here. You kind of just have to feel them out. Her friends can often be a good source of clues.  That said, I would be suspicious of any girl who's 28+, has a very goal-oriented attitude towards settling down, seems to have a history of hooking up a lot, and is vague about her past. These girls should just worry you in general, not even specific to AFWM issues. Once girls get to their late 20s, many of them go very hard into settle-down mode which should be a cause for concern for any guy who doesn't want to be used. You can spot a girl like this from a mile away.  If you're specifically trying to sniff out girls who prefer white guys but are settling for an Asian guy, I would look at her friends group. Is it mostly mixed or mostly Asian? If her group is all Asians it's less likely. Is she really white washed or is she more connected to her native culture?  At the end of the day you can only make an educated guess. No girl is going to admit that she's using you, and most of them are experts at hiding their past. The scary part is that she may not even realize she's doing it herself. Just look for the hints and be smart about it. If you're a man in your late 20s/early 30s you are hitting your peak, there's no reason why you should settle for a chick with red flags."
AsianMasculinity,3e35sj,kindlebluemoon,8,Tue Jul 21 18:12:39 2015 UTC,"It's hard to know if a girl is really into you until the first time you get a girl that actually IS really into you. After that it becomes really easy to tell. Before that you have no frame of reference.   You should go for her and see what happens. Personally if i go for a girl and she isn't into it or is heming and hawing, I'll cut her off after 2 weeks max.   If you overtly approach a girl, you force her hand into making a decision. If that decision ain't what you wanted that's fine. She was never going to be yours, and there are more girls out there.   If you make female friends they should be true platonic friends. It's a fallacy that being friends with a girl for longer increases your chances of being able to get with her."

Romance implies sacrifice on the part of the man. We don't need any of that. We simply help each other improve ourselves.   She's an expat CC rider. I don't want her as a GF. But I trust her 100% as a friend. We always enjoy each other's company and learn many insightful things from each other. We have done everything possible sexually. No anxiety, games/tricks, doubts, etc. unlike when I deal with other girls.   Even if she goes to suck 100 expat dicks, I know that she will always have my best interest in mind and help me when I really need it. She even encourages me to go have other plates and relationships if they would also help me improve myself. This is because we are just friends who simply accept each other completely. We have deep connections and friendship feelings, but no romantic feelings.   I didn't think such a scenario would be possible, but it's too bad."

Off the top of my head:   She says anything to the effect of ""I had a wild side back in the day, but I've found my culture.."" or other such bullshit. She seems unusually casual when talking about sex. Almost flippant. Yet, is a prude when it comes down to brass tacks and won't put out. Or severe prudishness from the get go. She says anything like ""I've learned to appreciate Japanese/Korean/Indian/Chinese/etc men."" Same as 1. above, it's bullshit. Translation? ""I fucked around with guys outside my race and let them use me like a slut. But now I want something dependable and preferably well-off."" She is constantly nagging you about your finances, is extremely interested in your job, career, or saleable passions. She says things like ""I think all men should take care of their women, don't you? It's just proper and traditional.."" Etc. Eject, she's a fucking gold-digger looking to get hers before you realize how broken she is. She says anything to the effect of ""the past doesn't matter,"" or ""It's not who I was, it's who I am now,"" etc. Another bullshit rationalization meant to absolve them of the guilt of being whores. She doesn't seem to have friends that date back more than a year or two. HUGE RED FLAG. If she doesn't have people she's known for a long time she is fucking hiding something. Unless she is extraordinarily socially awkward (pretty much impossible, given women are more socially attuned than men), there's something she doesn't want you to know so she's cut off contact from her past life. She ever, ever, even in the littlest bit, gaslights you. She be cray if this happens. Get out immediately. She's ever fucked a white guy. No matter how short or passionless the affair, interracial couplings have some damage associated with them always. It might be mitigated by this or that, but don't kid yourself. She fucked that whiteboy for a reason. Ask yourself what that reason is. You'll be surprised. To follow 1 and 3, if she seems very appreciative of her culture but is picky about the parts she likes. If she says that she loves such and such and then turns around and shit talks another aspect of her own culture. Pick up sticks, she hates herself and won't admit it. She's a feminist, Marxist, leftist, libertarian, etc. Run far, far away. To follow 10. If she's ever taken part in Social Justice in any way. If she's marched a Slutwalk, or canvassed, or anything else. It isn't worth it. She is controlling. She demands to know where you are, what your schedule is, and who you're speaking to. Women do this to isolate and psychologically/emotionally abuse men they are going to exploit for security and resources. Tell her to fuck off. If she put on weight from her college days and expects you to be okay with it. This follows 5 and 6. If she was svelte and trim when she was sowing her wild oats, why hasn't she kept it up when she says she wants something real with someone who matters? Hint: she doesn't. She wants to use you to secure her future.   That's what I can think of at the moment. There are definitely more. Many more. Most Asian women I know (of any race), are or have used a combination of many of the above. It's pretty fucking pathetic, truth be told.  EDIT: Grammar."

All you need to know is to always look out for yourself first and not have any positive nor negative preconceived notions about other people. See them for who they really are and what they could offer you.  You're restricting yourself and not really living how you want to live.  AWALT only applies to hypergamy, not other aspects of life that may add value to your life. Your mistake is in fighting against AWALT rather than taking advantage of it."

Sure, I agree that seeing people as they really are is useful, when that person has, or will have, a big impact on your life. Stereotypes exist for a reason. Generalizations exist for a reason. If I had to take into account the individual strengths and weaknesses of every single person I met, I'd go fucking bonkers. Instead, my mind makes heuristic constructs that help me classify the people I meet so I say, ""so-and-so is this, this, and this. That means they go in this box."" And then forget about it and move on. I have neither the time, nor energy to waste figuring out what people can offer me. I know what I want, and generally only deal with people who offer me what I want anyway. Generalized heuristics help me wade through the chaff.   OP was asking for a heuristic to help him determine what he meant to the girl he was dating. I gave it to him. I don't see why you're arguing."

TBH , every woman I've gone out with was way more curious about my past relationships than I was about hers.   Like other posters, I was pretty down on meeting westernized asian women. I had some dates that just seemed like a job interview. If you pass your late 20s-30s still single, you will meet these women. They are out there. If I started getting that feeling of ""I'm a backup plan"" then I tended to sexually escalate rather quickly, even if I didn't want to."

Only that she hasn't met any Asian guys who are open minded and creative enough to accept her until she met me. Then I introduced her to some of my other local Chinese friends who are also very smart and openminded, and now she's joking about dating them after I go back to America, and she realized that she really needs someone who can speak both Chinese and English. She says that I sound super sexy when I speak Chinese, and she felt that was missing from her life. She is working hard towards improving herself, and she also tries hard to help me improve myself, even giving some brutally honest critiques that only my parents would have given me before.  She is super into ancient Chinese literature as well, and sometimes speaks to me like she's an wise old man from ancient China. It's a complete mindfuck. Overall, I think she's simply a super curious person who seeks lots of variety and interesting experiences. I think we can be great on and off FWBs for life, but I will never marry her, and it's pretty satisfying. I can totally engineer a situation where I impregnate her and have a cuckold expat raise our kid. And the great thing is that she's not interested in douchebag alpha fucks game; she always tells me that I'm the most muscular, agressive, and cocky guy she knows and she sometimes gets turned off by that. She's simply interested in art, psychedelics, creativity, and openmindedness.   She showed so many red flags that it's not even funny. But time and time again, she has proven her value as a true friend. I still have incredibly high marginal utility with very low marginal costs in this relationship, and I have arbitrage even if this doesn't work out, so I'm satisfied continuing this relationship as it is, even though it defies all common sense... perhaps it's because she has no common sense. When she told me ""let's just be friends and I feel no sexual attraction to you"", she really meant ""I truly care for you as a friend, and we might as well as fuck anyway."" That's not exactly the normal response from a girl."

AsianMasculinity,3e2z0g,CrimsonQueso,10,Tue Jul 21 15:42:50 2015 UTC,I wish China had soft power on the same level as Corea. Girls be thirsting is real there. Korean guys also look good with the fashion
AsianMasculinity,3e2z0g,SteelersRock,12,Tue Jul 21 19:22:47 2015 UTC,"You gotta give props to the Korean guys themselves, not just the soft power. They know how to take care of themselves, and they're the most alpha/playboys out of all the Asian countries.   They're well dressed, well groomed, masculine due to their mandatory military training, and confident to the point they're annoyingly cocky in some cases. A lot of deez dudes be tall as fuck too, and they dance really well from what I've seen in Korean clubs. I feel like Korea is the hardest place to get action in Asia for any foreigner since the native Korean dudes actually have really strong Sexual Market Value.   It's such a stark contrast, with much more nerdier/beta Asian guys in other places with guys wearing glasses with unkempt hair growing out. In Japan, it was more like the guys were well dressed and shit, but they're not as aggressive and forward as Korean guys. In places like Taiwan, Hong Kong, the guys don't have the necessary concept of game/looks, so that's why ABCS run town there.  Even back in college, I remember the difference between Chinese FOBS and Korean/Taiwanese FOBS were so big. The Korean FOBS were always sharply dressed and roved around in groups, and almost everytime I saw a Korean FOB, it was always a Korean dude with his girlfriend. Chinese FOBS have no semblance of any fashion sense in comparison, and mainly walked around in sausagefests. Taiwanese fobs are also so much better dressed than the Mainlanders. I wonder why the contrast is so sharp? Not only were the Mainlanders poorly dressed, but many of these guys were those introverted, nerdy, league-of-legends playing guys as well who never leaves the room, while the Taiwanese and Korean FOBS I knew were always outside socializing."
AsianMasculinity,3e2z0g,globetrottingazn,6,Tue Jul 21 20:33:18 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the mandatory military training for ALL healthy able bodied Korean men has turned them into alpha dogs. China has way too many glasses wearing nerds. I agree with everything you said. Spot on. Whether the Chinese FOB is tall or short there's one thing for sure: They wear glasses and look nerdy.   In terms of getting foreign girls, I believe Chinese guys in Dongbei and Shandong have the most potential.   ''The Korean FOBS always roved around in groups, and almost everytime I saw a Korean FOB, it was always a Korean dude with his girlfriend. Chinese FOBS have no semblance of any fashion sense in comparison, and mainly walked around in sausagefests''  At my University, I've seen Chinese male FOBS with girlfriends, Chinese male FOBS with his fellow males, and Chinese male FOBS with a group of FOB girls. The height of these Chinese male FOBS was all over the place.  The Bo gua gua type of Chinese FOB is a rare breed. China needs more of that and less glasses wearing nerds."
AsianMasculinity,3e2z0g,SteelersRock,5,Tue Jul 21 20:36:07 2015 UTC,"I befriended a lot of Mainlanders, and they're REALLY really nice people. They have this huge concept of hospitality and treating their guests well, so they would regularly treat me out to expensive meals and shit, and were just really nice people in general. They're not arrogant or douchey for the most part, and easy to get a long with. It's just that I feel like they don't realize how nerdy they look in comparison to others, and it doesn't really bother them. I think it's cause of cultural/media influences. People in Taiwan and Korea due to their longer period of capitalism, were bombarded by media and consumerism to wear the latest fashions and look like the trendiest celebrity, so that's why these FOBS are more inclined to dress well and stuff in comparison to the Chinese ones."
AsianMasculinity,3e2z0g,globetrottingazn,2,Tue Jul 21 20:53:47 2015 UTC,"I believe Mainlanders are catching up in fashion. China moves quick and people are open to external ideas.

Seems like they're the only Asian country that is able to at least resist some of the white supremacy and make it on their own.  This is in direct contrast to China and Japan where white worship runs throughout the country like a damn plague
AsianMasculinity,3e2z0g,THE_YELLOW_BANNER,9,Tue Jul 21 18:02:43 2015 UTC,"This is not true in my experience. korea and Japan are the two countries under white militaristic protection and have the most white worship. Their culture is strongly geared towards the white man. I know even a korean here that uses the fact that she is a christian to try to assimilate to the people in the states. They try to be more subtle about it than Japan but it's still there.  China, being the huge conglomerate of land it is, is more diverse in opinion from my own finding. Yes, there are white worshippers, but there are just as many with their own pride."

AsianMasculinity,3e2z0g,badlores,-2,Tue Jul 21 19:49:15 2015 UTC,"OP makes a good post... but seriously the circle jerk in the comments is getting unconstructive.   Kpop is feminine shit. Period. No one should buy into this. Korean movies on the other hand is a different story. Koreans are more nationalistic, yes. But in my personal experience they still view whites above Asians. And a lot of Korean businesses take advantage of their poorer Asian neighbours for cheap labour and hold negative attitudes. The US has military bases there. Run down by Christianity and western shit. The head of state apologises whenever ABK does something wrong... weak.   You guys must have been to a different Korea because the stories i hear of white dudes going to SK ONLY to have sex with the women there is staggering - much more than in Japan / China as a percentage. Again deep respect for my Korean brothers for keeping it classy and being in general much more ripped, but in terms of the Korean society being a role model for other Asian countries? Not quite there yet."

Been a wingman far harder for me than I was for him.  I believe if you are good enough friends with someone long enough something like race shouldn't matter, which is obviously extremely controversial.   I would never do it for someone I'm not very good friends with.  Also it's super easy to tell if someone is using you for hookup purposes, just ask them straight up what they think of asian girls in casual conversation early on and almost every dude will tell you what they think. They'll usually ask me ""what's the best  asian girl nationality"", ""is it true Koreans are the hottest""? At that point I just go Ayyy lmao"

What I mean by that is how I would go about trying to make connections with people. Instead of being colorblind and talking to anybody, mostly white people, which ended up really draining, I would reach out to other Asians, which has been a much more positive experience. Of course now I don't limit myself to Asian people but when I was just starting out that exposed me to experiences that really brought me down. I haven't gotten laid yet but I've gotten some positive responses and have been told I'm quite attractive so I'm sure it's just a matter of time."

AsianMasculinity,3e02er,Tropicana89,19,Mon Jul 20 22:34:55 2015 UTC,"For our generation, I believe you need to learn how to have at least a few female friends.  We live in a world where women have equal rights, and nowadays they even have more rights in some instances.  Just be warned that many of them will not work out, and you need to be aware of it.  Loyalty is a male concept for the most part.  Women truly do not understand the idea of dying for friends.  There's a stereotype that women can't work together, because of all the backstabbing.  There was a female author who lived undercover as a man, and she was surprised and touched by male bonding, as it was something she said that women do not have.  When shit goes down, many women (even feminists) except some sort of chivalry, or they'll betray their friends.  Men are the ones who go down with the ship.  For your part, you need to learn to establish friendship and romantic or sexual boundaries with a woman.  Take Eliot Chang's advice: Don't Fuck Your Friends.  If you need to fuck them, then you should be fucking.  Otherwise stop pretending your actually friends.  You're acquaintances.  You can have friends across racial lines, but it's just not as easy as same race or same gender.  It's the same with romantic relationships.  Interracial couples just have more things to deal with.  You shouldn't necessarily avoid those opportunities, just like you shouldn't avoid the opportunity to be in a relationship with a non-Asian girl.  Just don't be naive that things like race and gender don't matter.  As an AM, they absolutely do."
AsianMasculinity,3e02er,number888,11,Tue Jul 21 00:41:47 2015 UTC,"Female friends are definitely important but it's critical to not be thought of as another ""orbiter"" in their eyes. A lot of women have problems differentiating between their male friends. Most male friends around cute women are back up plans and it's important for a guy to know the difference between back up plan (aka orbiter) and actual friend.   You know a girl is actually your friend when she's willing to pimp for you. She'll introduce you to her cute besties or friends for dating or hooking up. When a girl knowingly adds to your social value like that then she's definitely looking out for your best interests.  If a girl is not willing to go to bat for you like that then either   1) She thinks of you as her back up plan and she's jealous about other girls getting attention from what she thinks are her orbiters.  2) She's not socially down with you at all and won't introduce you on that level. Very bad sign. 3) Has boyfriend/husband who controls the social narrative. Also very bad.  The first scenario can be changed (with difficulty) if you have some social skills. However 2 and 3 is a hopeless cause, just move on."
AsianMasculinity,3e02er,easternenigma,2,Tue Jul 21 01:11:05 2015 UTC,"Me and this girl really got into it once. Me arguing what you are arguing now, that women don't have a good concept of loyalty like men do. I bring it up sometimes around women and most agree, but this girl was adamant that I was full of shit.   Took a step back and realized her girl crew was actually extremely loyal to each other. One of them literally walked up to one of my guy friends once and was like ""ew why are you hooking up with that girl, my friend Jessica is so much better"" WHILE he was with the other girl, haha. That's pretty ballsy. That group and a couple others I've seen really do have each other's backs the same way an ideal guy crew would be. I've noticed these ""loyal chick-bro groups"" tend to be mostly career women. On the other hand a lot of guys, especially liberal white American guys, have very limited sense of loyalty or camaraderie. Not even just towards Asians, my white friends all think they're little bitches too.   So be sure to evaluate these things on a case by case basis."
AsianMasculinity,3e02er,asianmasaccount,2,Tue Jul 21 10:38:11 2015 UTC,"So true. Non-Asian/female friends are possible, but Asian male friends have such a great ROI that it's hard to imagine why you would intentionally seek non-AM friendships if you're not chancing upon them randomly or making them out of absolute necessity."
AsianMasculinity,3e02er,iherdulikepsydukz,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:51:06 2015 UTC,"so... I guess all I my female friends should be someone I'm not attracted to? Hmmm, I like all kinds of women, but what happens if she says no and I'm afraid that I'll still be attracted, it would ruin a friendship, so might as well lose contact with her then? Right away, delete her number?"
AsianMasculinity,3e02er,somethingpersonal,4,Tue Jul 21 02:14:47 2015 UTC,"When it comes to female friends, the sexual and romantic aspects have to eventually be resolved.  Female relationships rarely remain as friendships, because they were never really friendships in the first place.  They were in the pretend stage, where you both are trying to figure things out.  I've been ""friends"" with a few of these girls, but eventually one of the following happens.  You have sex, you date, one gets rejected from the other, naturally you become the acquaintances you really are, one gets in a relationship with someone else and become more distant, or the worst possibility is that you remain in orbit as a pathetic loser.  Don't be surprised if that you discover in a few years that you actually have zero female friends."
AsianMasculinity,3e02er,number888,2,Tue Jul 21 02:38:01 2015 UTC,"If you're attracted to them and persist on trying to get with them while you're ""friends"" and supplicate to them emotionally then by definition you are an orbiter.   An orbiter is not really thought of as a friend by women. He's a useful tool, an admirer (fan), a backup plan, and sometimes financial support/santa claus.  You absolutely do not want to be an orbiter.  If a girl does not prove her friendship to you and establish a baseline of trust then it's up to you to cut off contact. Sometimes when you abruptly sever social contact like that women come back around. Then you check again to see where you can position yourself. If it's the same shit, sever and move on."

I can expect them to do a good job, probably even depend on them, but for some reason, not many that I respect. Because they don't stand for anything, they don't represent anything in their life, they wouldn't die for anything (except their children), but what I mean is, they wouldn't die for a belief.  Men on the other hand, even guys who don't really have their act together, I find myself respecting. I think this is a masculine set of qualities.  to be fair, I suck at simple things like chatting, shooting the shit, etc. It's something I'm working on."

It's very important to maintain a supportive network especially for asian-american men.
AsianMasculinity,3e02er,easternenigma,4,Tue Jul 21 00:20:23 2015 UTC,"The problem is Asians are self-segregating so it is hard for a lot of Asians to acknowledge ""yep I should trust my race of people more than whities"".  E.g. a Viet may trust other Viets and say some East Asians, but not other Asians. Koreans may only trust other Koreans but treat other Asians same or worse than non-Asians.  It is evident in the news. Asians try to fuck over other Asians literally every single day."
AsianMasculinity,3e02er,badlores,4,Tue Jul 21 06:53:30 2015 UTC,"I think that's a bad attitude.  At the end of the day, the West (particularly the US) doesn't see us as Chinese, Japanese or Korean, or Vietnamese.  They've started wars with and invaded every single one of our countries, and attempted to invade other Asian nations too.

AsianMasculinity,3dyp5e,chineseinjapan,4,Mon Jul 20 16:45:40 2015 UTC,Can you talk about why you moved and decided to stay in Japan?  What kind of contrasts do you see when socializing in Japan vs the US?
AsianMasculinity,3dyp5e,lionspaw1,5,Mon Jul 20 18:19:06 2015 UTC,"I got to Japan on accident actually. I came here on a vacation and ended up with a job interview. I'd rather not say what industry as it's pretty easy to give away but I'm a typical nerdy programmer type asian dude with glasses, as were a lot of my colleagues so actually felt quite natural. I've had a huge interest in Japan growing up of course watching Dragon Ball and other anime as well as playing a ton Squaresoft RPGs as I'm sure a lot of us did. I moved to get more perspective as this is actually the first time I've ever left my hometown, let alone the US. I stayed because I love it. The culture, meeting people who were within my own element, and I also suppose the girls are a distant third. The food is also cheap and amazing depending on where you look.  The contrasts between Japan and US are huge. But it also depends on what you're looking for. For example, romantically vs just finding normal friends to hang out with. The latter I feel is best if you find a local place to hang out at and get to know the people who go there or the people who run it. I really like that aspect of Japan in that there's so many places like that, where in the US you go to a bar or whatever you just don't do that. Either way, it depends on where you hang out, in that regard I guess here and the US aren't too different then after all. The former though, depends on what you're looking for. A quick hookup is as it is in the US if you're forward enough at say a club or something. Actually maybe even easier since there's access to love hotels. It depends on the club as well, especially for an asian guy. You go to a club where chicks are looking for ""foreign"" dudes, you're outta luck. But you go to places say, normal japanese people go, welllllll there ya go. As for actual girlfriends or such, it also depends. I suppose there are also these things called Machikons which are group dates you can do to meet girls who are friends of friends. Apparently people are also really embarrassed to go on them as well. Sorry if this is incredibly vague as your question can go many different ways."
AsianMasculinity,3dyp5e,lionspaw1,0,Mon Jul 20 18:50:45 2015 UTC,"I also suppose the girls are a distant third   Whoa. That's pretty surprising because Tokyo has the some of the best looking and polished women in Asia, and the ratio there is very much in the men's favor.   How are you doing with the local ladies there as an ABC?"
AsianMasculinity,3dyp5e,lionspaw1,7,Mon Jul 20 23:35:38 2015 UTC,"Japan has some of prettiest women I've ever seen in my life. It's a third as women shouldn't be your life, or at least, I try not to be. I've also met so many scumbag english teacher expats who do the whole ""come to fuck Japanese pussy"" type of deals that I do my best not be looped in with that crowd or reputation. Of course I quite like beautiful asian women myself.  That aside, it's been interesting to say the least. Too Asian for the girls who are into foreigners and too foreigner for some of the girls who only date Japanese. But then again, I don't think I'd want either side of that spectrum anyway so no real loss. Key for me has been meeting just normal Japanese women who are just doing their thing. Of course, language is a must. Just got out of a relationship fairly recently with a Japanese girl and have gone on quite a bit of dates and hook ups as well. Compared to back home I'd definitely say I'm doing better just because of pure numbers. The fact that asian guys with glasses are the norm here, or even thought of as attractive in some cases and not something to be downplayed is pretty awesome I would say. It just feels normal. Also always best to have a good Japanese wingman though to ease things along as well. Or even vice versa for being the foreigner who opens things up."
AsianMasculinity,3dyp5e,juanqunt,2,Tue Jul 21 05:52:22 2015 UTC,"Too Asian for the girls who are into foreigners and too foreigner for some of the girls who only date Japanese.   really interesting. so it seems like even though ABC's really just have a small portion of the population willing to date them in Tokyo as well, but this portion is probably still way better than the pool of available women in America both in quantity and quality."
AsianMasculinity,3dyp5e,liquiddrugs,4,Tue Jul 21 06:04:02 2015 UTC,"Looking at it another way, there's also been some articles that have written that Asian Americans do BETTER here because girls actually feel more comfortable with being with an Asian, but still find it fun and interesting to be with a foreigner. So we get all the pros without any of the cons, or is it the cons without any of the pros? So, I have no idea what to believe, which is why I made this thread to maybe get some other opinions. I haven't been able to get a good chance to ask this to any of the local women as it just hasn't come up."
AsianMasculinity,3dyp5e,lionspaw1,2,Tue Jul 21 06:40:00 2015 UTC,"I find that if I up play my American side, I get girls that have a lot of self hating issues even if they are fine with going out with me. I had a date with a girl that knew from the start that I grew up outside of China, where she made comments like ""mixed babies are so cute"".  So as a general rule, I downplay my American side when I'm dealing with local girls in China. But I honestly would not know what the optimal strategy would be in Japan."
AsianMasculinity,3dyp5e,liquiddrugs,2,Tue Jul 21 06:58:44 2015 UTC,"For me, I've in in both situations: all the pros without the cons and all the cons without the pros.  If the girl is actually open minded and smart, then you get all pros without the cons. If the girl is just a simple minded foreign cock riding loser, then you get all the cons without the pros. It's a bit of a self filter.  I play up my American ideas about freedom, fitness, entrepreneurship, and openmindedness, but also emphasize that I have an interest in Asian culture and the advancement of Asian economies."

There's too many guys who get caught up in not being able to pull the club rats over here when they go out because they keep assuming it's so easy. And even so, you really wouldn't want them anyway. Those girls are usually uninteresting (although hot). That's my opinion though as I'm really looking for a good LTR. The real women, usually your normal college educated, has a decent job, and maybe even lives on her own (this is rare) aren't going there. I'm probably going to be here a long time and consider this home now so, all depends on what you're looking for as well.  Ah yeah, good note there, if you meet a girl and she lives on her own here it says a lot considering most 20s - late 30s people still live with their parents, even after finding a job. Always taken it as a strong sign. That or uh, maybe she's a runaway メンヘラ.  And also USE LINE if you wanna meet Japanese girls here. It's absolutely necessary. No one uses SMS and email is getting old here. Facebook isn't as widespread either."

Middle class and UMC families in Beijing and Shanghai have more net worth than middle class families in America from real estate and savings.   Also, it's not 10x any more, it's more like 2x or 3x. 20000 yuan/month is considered a decent salary here, and basically similar to making 100k USD/year in the US."

Although col is definitely lower in China, the luxury items are much more expensive. Shit like bmw/Mercedes and Louie bags have massive luxury tax and its what gets all the women as people in China are obsessed with status. Completely out of reach of most people.   Buying a coach bag for a girl in China has much more of an impact than getting on for an American girl. Instead of a ""well off"" vibe in America, it's a straight ""rich boy"" vibe in China. Making 20k rmb a month will let you eat and live like a king in China, but 3000 usd a month isn't enough to buy luxury items that cost double what they do in the states. Luxury items don't scale well in the col/income comparison.  Shanghai is obviously different as most people make near double what they make in the rest of the county, as well as having much higher col."

I believe you that the situation in Xian is like that, but in Beijing and Shanghai, it's different, and there is much less cachet associated with being ABC or Asian American. People are all making much more money and usually one order of separation from someone who lives abroad, so it's just not a big deal."

Also, if you're being an employee at a large tech company, you're doing it wrong. He should work in a job with high performance based bonuses or do entrepreneurship.

AsianMasculinity,3dyp5e,globetrottingazn,2,Wed Jul 22 02:45:28 2015 UTC,"I can give a bit of insight into this. It's very beneficial to be a asian foreigner if you bring some value to the table. In otherwords you have to establish you're not some migrant worker holding a sign in Roppongi or scrubbing toilets. You need some interesting facet for them to glom onto..  You're a guy who is based in Japan with language skills and knowledge base who is into the culture. You learn and adapt. I do the same thing in every country in the region I travel to.  Sometimes you run into the same issues in SEA as well. This is especially true in somewhat ethnocentric countries like Thailand where if you dont bring some Thai friends and/or speak Thai you're classed as silly or even worse dumb in social circles.   Btw, I don't believe the hype about Japanese girls. The reason why Japanese get that reputation is because of light skin and pretty faces represented in the media. There are TONS of SEA girls with the same features as well.   It's that mixture of Chinese + SEA and it creates some incredible women."
AsianMasculinity,3dyp5e,iherdulikepsydukz,2,Tue Jul 21 15:14:55 2015 UTC,"It depends on the person, it depends on understanding. Every Japanese girl I've been with I've actually been their first foreigner so, YMMV. I guess it was tough in the beginning but as my Japanese got better and got more willing to go out to places where most foreigners don't go to it got a lot easier just meeting people in general. I steer pretty clear of places like say, Shibuya (except to go to Taco Bell recently, because why the fuck not) I suppose.

AsianMasculinity,3dyp5e,lionspaw1,3,Tue Jul 21 11:56:58 2015 UTC,"The best looking and polished women in Asia are by far, and without competition, Korean girls. Go there and see.  As an ABC myself, I've actually had a lot of difficulties trying to pull girls in either Japan or Korea. I think the anti-Chinese sentiment in both countries rub off on us ABCs as well. I thought my English or Americanness would help, but a lot of the girls there lose interest fast when they figure out that I'm a a Chinese-American. But I feel like using the 'English card' to attract girls in Asian countries has lost its allure very fast in the past decade. Even white expats and travelers alike have expressed how hard it is to get any action in these countries in comparison to just ten years ago in 2005 (Korea's hard for any guy. Deez korean bishes are really tough to crack unless you're a Korean-American).  Anyways, if you're an ABC, the definite best place to pull without a doubt is Taiwan. In Taiwan, I was hooking up left and right. Taiwanese-Americans run town in clubs and bars in our motherland. Hit up Luxy, Room18, Club Myst brothas. I heard Luxy closed tho very recently :("
AsianMasculinity,3dyp5e,easternenigma,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:05:55 2015 UTC,If they can't tell the difference and if you're only interested in short term bangs/flings then just say you're nissei or mostly Korean. There's zero incentive to be honest with some chick you're trying to bang at a club or random social gathering.   You owe them nothing.   Trust is earned and not given.   If someone can't look past ethnicity anyways there's nothing wrong with just outright deceiving them. They won't give you the benefit of the doubt anyways so why should you be transparent and put yourself out there. Chances are good you won't have anything to do with them in the future anyways.  I totally agree with you about Taiwan. Best kept secret when it comes to ABC's. Actually it's not so secret since I know a lot of CA Taiwanes/Chinese american brahs who go out there every year. You can tell when it's holiday or college break season because the clubs get packed with the same CA asians you see around L.A.
AsianMasculinity,3dyp5e,lionspaw1,2,Tue Jul 21 00:48:32 2015 UTC,"LOL right on bro. definitely something I tried doing to experiment and see if it worked, but it's much easier said than done.   The more I spent time in different Asian countries, the more I noticed that there definitely are differences in facial traits and characteristics between the Asian ethnicities. Now I can much more easily distinguish between a Japanese dude and a Chinese dude, and I can even see the differences between a northern Chinese person and a southerner now.   I guess it's possible to successfully deceive a bish if you look ""ambiguous"" enough to the point its passable for you to be considered to ""look"" Japanese or Korean. But I've realized even as an Asian, I do look distinctively Chinese. In America people could mistake me for a Korean or something, but in countries as homogenous as Japan and Korea, you stick out from the norm just enough for people to tell that you're not one of them.   You look Asian so you definitely blend in better with the locals much better compared to a non-Asian, but I've realized both Japanese and Koreans can pretty freaking accurately tell that I'm Chinese even without me opening my mouth. I think it's cause both Japanese ppl and Koreans have this pretty similar ""cookie cutter"" look that they all share in their respective ethnicities. Even though Asian-Americans are easily distinguishable from the natives due to stark differences in styling (clothes, tanning, hairstyle), a Chinese-American will still look Chinese, and a Korean-American will still look Korean due to those genetic traits. I think it has to do with those minor differences in facial structure, monolids vs double-eyelids, nose structure, etc. that Asians can easily distinguish, but people from the West can't.   I remember trying to mess with this girl I met at a club in Korea, telling her that I'm a Korean-American from L.A., and she gave me this bewildered stare, then remarked that I ""didn't look Korean at all."" She was also weirded out by the fact that I couldn't speak even a single lick of Korean other than a few phrases that I learned, so I think that broke down the facade pretty quickly lol. The bish gradually disengaged, and then went off back to her friends, and promptly ignored me for the rest of the night.   Similar shit happened when I approached Japanese girls too. Never had an issue like that at all in Taiwan or even in  the Mainland. The language barrier is too real. It's much easier to seduce a girl if you can communicate with her well, but all the sloots that can speak English in Japan and Korea are looking for white dudes, and the ones who can't aren't looking to hook up with someone who can't speak their language.   That's why Taiwan is so good, cause it's nice being able to actually communicate with a girl fully with my decent Mandarin in contrast to very boring and basic level talks with girls with limited English skills."

AsianMasculinity,3dyp5e,liquiddrugs,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:40:21 2015 UTC,I don't think it's either/or. China is decent too but it's so large it really depends on the city. Taiwan on the other hand is very compact with a small population and Taipei is well travelled by ABCs. Plus the girls in Taiwan are objectively more attractive on average in my opinion. This means it hits all the right positive points.

I've been on a few dates in China and all the girls say they don't want to date a white guy because they'll get shamed by their parents. They wanna find a rich asian guy that owns a bmw+ can buy them as much random luxury shit as they want.  White English teachers way too broke for that."

If you speak good Chinese, and have a decent education you will have an easier time than local Taiwanese if you know where to look.  I don't really go to clubs anymore, but in Taiwan I go to hobby clubs, discussion groups, or ask Taiwanese friends to introduce me.  The advantage with a hobby group is that you will find someone that shares your interest and it's easier to strike up conversation if you're good at what you do.  Of course there will be instances where a 5'0"" white American guy will be able to get a girl just because he's white, but those types of girls probably aren't worth it anyways."

AsianMasculinity,3dyp5e,Faznscist,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:18:17 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I never felt any blatant sense of anti-Chinese sentiment in Japan. The Japanese are extremely polite, living up to their reputation, and I had a blast, just not dating/hooking-up wise. It's just that in light of seeing news about polls saying: ""73% of Japanese have an unfavorable view of China"" and stuff and with the rising tensions, it's mainly more of an awareness that such sentiment is held by a certain segment of the population. In Korea however, I felt a bit more of that anti-Chinese sentiment in a way, seeing more cold expressions, getting overcharged in rare cases, and seeing some Koreans show less interest in me/caring about me less once they knew I was Chinese. I mean you can look at this thread that talks about this phenomenon: http://forums.eslcafe.com/korea/viewtopic.php?t=235162   But in general, there are millions of tourists from China in both countries, so I wasn't treated horribly or badly in either country. It's just that it sucked in terms of girls for both countries as an ABC compared to other places. I just feel like there are even more hurdles to go through there, even more than in America. I visited Japan only once, and I mainly went out in Roppongi. I had a Japanese friend from college who showed me around for bit, but I was on my own for the bulk of the trip.

Make yourself presentable, but be yourself. If you don't get bids, so be it. If you need to fabricate a personality to get acceptance from a frat, it's probably not a frat you would enjoy being a part of long term.  That said, I doubt you'll have trouble getting a bid somewhere unless you're completely socially awkward. Affirmative action for Asians is a real thing when it comes to fraternities, or at least it is from what I've observed.  EDIT: 100% back up what keezykid says. You have to be very mentally resilient and secure in yourself to really thrive in the frat bro environment and not lose yourself as an Asian guy. I probably wouldn't have been able to tolerate frat life for more than a couple semesters myself if I didn't have lots of ""away time"" via doing a bunch of study abroad programs."

Yea the whites will try to test you, but sometimes we come out of high school needing a bit of testing.   And I haven't found people to be unreasonable unless the Asian guy just ain't willing to change something that really is a problem for himself and for his friend group.   But any freshman frat guy has to earn respect. It's important to stay mentally strong as the token Asian. Identify what is valued/respected in the group. This step ain't hard. Then be good at it. That step is a little harder. If you can't or aren't willing to do this either because you have some sort of pride/defiance complex against white people or because what the group values is totally fucked up, don't rush that white frat.   Haha I tried to get my white guy friends to eat a thousand year old egg my sophomore year of college out of some weird Asian pride complex. Don't do that.   EDIT: Also I want to add, make no mistake, you're contributing just as much to them as they are doing you a solid. Don't go into it with the mindset ""I'm asking these white boys for a favor."" That's how Asian girls think, and we aren't asian girls.   I could give you some examples about how you enrich multiculturalism in an increasingly connected world blah blah, but I'll give you a much funnier and more salient example.   When all my guy friends graduated in the past couple of years, they had to find a way to get bitches while no longer being in college. This is a HUGE hurdle for a lot of people to get over. The red pill gets depressed about it all the time. Because I was friends with them, I taught them how to pull girls from the outside world when you ain't the big guy on campus but just another guy in the city. Reason being is that I always had to do this since campus was inherently set up to disadvantage Asian guys.   I mean, when you join a white frat you aren't Prometheus stealing fire from the white overlords, these people will actually be your ride-or-die friends.

I think we focus so much on the negatives, but it's also nice to take a breather and focus on the positives of being an Asian male. And I feel like the positives we have contribute much more in the long run, towards a more fuller and better life.   Don't forget to add these advantages we have as well: 1. Amazing Food - our food is fucking bomb, and we're lucky to have our HEALTHY and delicious food be such an integral part of our lives since birth.   Bilingual - a lot of us Asians males were lucky to be born in circumstances that gave us a unique advantage in learning both English and the language our parents speak, giving us amazing opportunities in both Asia and America for jobs, dating, making friends, etc.  Really Good Hair - you touched upon this, but ima expand on it. Asian guys have REALLY good hair if they take of it right. I remember going to many different barbers, and I've always got my hair cut by non-Asians who remark that my hair is really good, and that they think Asian hair is the best to cut and style.  Access to the 8/10's and up Asian girls - Though some of us may not be into Asian girls, for those of who are, we're in luck. The VAST majority of WMAF couples are pairings of beta males with asian girls who are 6/10 or 5/10 on average, and the more alpha non-Asians might be able to land a 7/10 Asian. But for almost ALL of them, Asian girls who are truly bomb are basically off-limits to them, and only the top tier Asian guys have access to these girls. I've encountered way too many posts by expats and other non-whites who lament that 8/10 and up girls are unobtainable for them. Of course there will be an extremely small percentage of non-Asians that are insanely good-looking/rich enough to land an 8/10 Asian girl or higher.

Like I can find a white guy cute and all but my ""like"" threshold before I would date a white guy is waaaaaaay higher because there are things about being a minority that he will just never get.  I'm a girl but a lot of white guys just want to know what it's like to bang a sassy black woman...it gets pretty annoying  Not only does explaining anything racial to white men become tiring, but if they have racist family members, you are kind of doing a disservice to your self-esteem. I hope no black woman sticks around with a white man with a racist family, especially if he never defends you.  I started getting to know this white boy and I'm feeling like it might not be worth it. I have no patience for white male apathy and entitlement.  I've never dated interracially and never will. I love my black men, no other race of men can hold a candle to them as far as I'm concerned. I love that we can connect more easily and I don't have to explain simple things about being black, they get it.   From black guys:   And I hate when niggas shit on black girls and vice versa. Even at my school I've seen a few people walk past 10 black people to get to the one white guy/girl. Shits baffling.  Did you guys know there is a stereotype of us liking obese non-black women (particularly white women). This is actually a thing. It's brought a couple of friendships to an awkward end for me.  My main issue with IR dating is that too many brothas aren't willing to just say they want to date white women or any other women so they make up excuses, usually something negative against Black women. The usuals are: 1- I can't find Black women 2 - Black women don't like me (for some silly reason) 3- Black women are too loud/ hard to deal with / combative  I will also say thing and I truly believer it. Any man not into women of his own race has some self hate issues. So when any Black dude tells me how he don't date Black women.....I instantly lost a shit load of respect for them.   Just do a search on ""dating"" on either /r/blackladies and /r/blackfellas, and see the level of discourse they have.  Look at the black community, the men (who have the analogous role in their community as AF in our ""community"") still value and going the extra mile to support their sisters, and punish anti-BF views/behaviors from their brothers. At the same time, the women have absolutely zero love for white male supremacy.   Unlike our ""community"", where a lot of time, anti-AM views are encouraged, or at least tolerated, amongst AF. Any AF going the extra mile to support AM is an absolute rarity.  Thus the community we need to develop can not mirror in structure like other minority community. We can not copy-n-paste what they did and focus on finding ""gender solidarity"". The will to form a community amongst us is entirely an one-sided skew. We Asian males would like to do so, but Asian females are mostly motivated by assimilation to white power, and if we AM somehow became a roadblock to their path to assimilation to this power, we are misogynist and controlling and their ultimate enemy.  It is not a coincidence that the progress on discourse we made after we split into a male space vastly trumps any progress with a ""coherent gender unified"" community, like r/AA. The things we talked about here VASTLY trumps in substance and interests compare to the things over there.  From this comment of a veteran of our community, it is clear that this issue has come up again and again, and had destroyed any past momentum in Asian American activism before.   When half of your group, love the status quo and are generally in favor of white supremacy, which favors their own interests, there is no possible way you can drag them into helping you and forming a working group with them.  So the only way we can move forward is by mining for non-traditional allies. AF in general should no longer be seen in any special status than any other race, as friends/allies. We haven't nearly spent enough time/effort to get allies from BF or WF or females from any other race. Maybe it is easier to get help and agreement from them, than from AFs.  So there is also no need to expend effort to punish or hate on them. They are just strangers to us now. We just need to realize this fact really clear and not make this mistake again. DO NOT spend any extra moment of your life thinking about AFs. They are essentially like those white liberals who are in tacit approval of white supremacy, in terms of helping us.  Focus on loving and helping your brothers. Realize the fact that any social movement is going to primarily be powered by us alone with support primarily coming from non-AF allies. We just need to think non-traditionally how to go about it with no exact instruction from past examples."
AsianMasculinity,3dvtxo,proper_b_wayne,13,Mon Jul 20 06:31:56 2015 UTC,The thing is the black men with white women phenomenon in the black community is not even at the same level as AFWM (black men do not show a preference for white women over black women according to the stats) but look at how raw the conversation is between the two sides. Find me an AF who'll speak like this:  https://np.reddit.com/r/blackladies/comments/1s0ovm/black_men_and_white_women/cdsuq5u  Compare how they talk about this issue to that discussion in r/AA where everyone on the AM side is basically walking on eggshells always conceding a point before making a point.
AsianMasculinity,3dvtxo,fembot12,-3,Mon Jul 20 07:28:06 2015 UTC,"To be fair, black guys do appear to date a disproportionate amount of obese white women."
AsianMasculinity,3dvtxo,joelstean,11,Mon Jul 20 16:24:31 2015 UTC,"Damn, sadly I think this is the truth, I've previously (ignorantly) encouraged mirroring without respect for differences. Thinking about it, there's a huge disparity between Asian feminist and Black feminist. Even though both of these feminist talk shit about white males and their supremacy they inflict, Black feminists practice what they preach and regardless of any frequent criticism of black men they give, they still primarily date Black men. They embrace and don't criticize Black women who date interracially (because Black men display less racial loyalty, they don't wanna encourage non-reciprocal loyalty anymore) but at the same time they don't generally have the hots to pursue whites. But, most of these Asian feminists are still dating and entertaining white men despite making fun of them because supposedly the white men they're with is the right type of white. This was evident in that thread on AsianAmerican, constant recognition of the problem and willingness to pay lip tribute but not many actual recognition of their personal relationships being a problem and you had AF being defensive about how their white guys are actual ""the good ones"" and resort to constant fall back on how Asian men aren't entitled to relationships with them (which no one actually claimed but hey strawmans are the name of the game).   Asian women usally resorting to saying that if Asian men had shots with white women, they would also do the exact same thing. But, the evidence just doesn't support this. On both Okcupid and Datehookup, Asian men consistenly rated Asian women so much higher than White women. 2014 was actually the only year that Asian men were rated higher than white men and even then, Asian women rated white men 18% whereas Asian men rated white women 3%. Clear disparity. Same goes for arguments that talk about Black women not being desired by white men, which yes to a certain extent is true but Black women also penalized and rated white negatively. Compare that to Black men who rated Asian women positively yet got rated so negatively by them.   It comes back to what I was saying here:   I get it, where on thebluepill where we love to mock entitled and creepy men but the problem is you're looking at this through a colorblind narrative i.e. not seeing Asian men as as Asian men but just rather simply men and that removes a big ass context that underlines the whole problem that's being stated.     We live in an age where there's a huge ass polarization between the genders and because of that Asian men aren't going to be seen as anything other then men (and thus patrichary and everything that comes with that which includes automatic sympathy for women even if they're clearly in the wrong when it comes to this shit). I used to be like these Anna Lu's and it was so uncomfortable for me to constantly see legitimate criticism of Black men's IR and try and rationalize why my one is so different to these. But, not having women victimhood to fall back on, I was forced to confront this head on and realize that I drunk the kool-aid and it was time for me to go on a cleanse which meant no white women and that lasted a year, even though I know occasionally fuck with some, it's at much lower rates than I used to because I lost that drive for them that I (ashamedly) possessed."

Whities don't have a preference for asian girls, some just use racist shit they think will work. There's documented white fever doe...so DOES IT?  On race and gender: We need to remember that race alone isn't enough of a commonality to have a healthy relationship, not when treatment of our race differs based on gender, and certainly not when lots of white guys feel superior to asians because an AF annie Lu puts down asians because of ""genetics and asian patriarchy"". This shit is a power trip for white men, seeing asian men pine for asian girls who put them down.   On relationships for asian men: Why do so many of us lust after those who disrespect us? Why are white women the only alternative? Is your social status so high, your sexual experiences so wild, that you are blind to everything else? Why do we idolize the demographic that legit has no preference for us, even less so than asian girls? Why do we pine after white girls when their friends and PARENTS will give them all kinds of shit and ostracize them for dating you? There are other races too, seek them out. And there are still hispanic whites if you can't see anything else in a sexual/romantic light. I'm not saying to pull a 180 and only date blacks and hispanics, but keep an open mind yo. We are interesting as fuark, the world is our oyster, and that oyster has more than Anna Lus and average white girls. Look at our stats on income, education, crime, and really think.

Consider gay Asian men. They receive the full brunt of Asian male and Asian female oppressions. No group of Asian women receives Asian male oppression in addition to Asian female oppression.

AsianMasculinity,3dvtxo,GoBackToUzbekistan,5,Mon Jul 20 05:17:29 2015 UTC,"IMO, it's the changing attention spans of people today that brought down organized activism. Forums, where people could successfuly mobilize, have largely been replaced by quick-media, such as Instagram, Reddit, Twitter, and Tumblr.   With forums, important topics could be ""bumped"" up to the top by new posters in the thread, leading to a constant stream of ideas building on top of each other and constant discourse. With the newer forms of media, threads are guaranteed to be thrown off from the top by newer posts, based on how each site's algorithms work."

It was much worse back in the day,  Asian women would not even admit to any responsibility in the rift and would always just blame it on the patriarchy.

I don't think it's because of the goodness of their hearts that they will even admit culpability for the current state of the situation. If change is gonna come, it's gonna be very gradual and will probably only be realized when you're in you're 40's. Not worth the time or energy.  Finally, I'd like to finish off with this anecdote which I think illustrates the differences of the two mindsets:  Eddie Huang's Fresh Off the Boat: Attempts to normalize Asian people. Eddie himself even said that one of the goals he had in starting the show was giving America a the Asian-AMERICAN experience - not as minstrels or sex objects, but as people.  Mindy Kaling's recently cancelled show Girls...I mean The Mindy Show is absolutely lacking in diversity and has almost no illustrations of the Indian-American experience to speak of. Mindy Kaling in that show is essentially just another white girl. She only dates white men only has white friends. And despite being set in a hospital of New York City, there are literally no other people of colour on her show except for her brother who is portrayed as an awkward tryhard who lamely appropriates black culture.  When questioned about the lack of diversity on her own show:    I'm a fucking Indian woman who has her own fucking network television show. [Snip] I have four series regulars that are women on my show, and no one asks any of the shows I adore — and I won't name them because they're my friends — why no leads on their shows are women or of color, and I'm the one that gets lobbied aboutthese things.""   That's the difference between Asian men and women."

If AF want to change the ways things are now then tough shit. It is believed that a little knowledge can prove to be dangerous. Here we have accounts of personal experiences being shared that could be made into a encyclopedia.  I think we as AM are entering uncharted territory here as we are in my opinion gaining a strong foothold in the western world that previous generations weren't able to do. So let us become the captains of the ships so that one day our grandsons and great-grandsons can say ""i'm proud of my Asian heritage and i'm proud to be called an Asian man""."

Its pretty hard for a AM to be completely clueless unless they never use the internet.   Some ridicules misconceptions:   WMAF and AMWF are symmetric.  Reality - AMWF face tremendous discrimination and hostility from white relatives, peers, and outright strangers. WMAF has not hurt the asian community.

Fatherhood is a big part of masculinity for those who become one so we should support those who do.

They can and will pursue their self interests whatever and whenever according their own selfish desire, even if people had been very kind to them."

Bad relationship with father is honestly one of the shittiest reasons/excuses I've ever heard to exclude AMs from your dating pool as an AF

Prepare our sons for the dating environment way earlier.  Its clearly not a level playing field.   I personally haven't seen the ""bad father"" theory so much.  Have asian dads been worse than other ethnic groups?  I doubt it. Yet nobody else has a hardcore traitor problem."

AsianMasculinity,3dvtxo,easternenigma,8,Mon Jul 20 19:30:46 2015 UTC,"I believe honest dialogue is impossible because all the mental and emotional issues that plague asian-americans right now could fill another edition of the DSM psychology book.  I hate to say it but in many ways I feel Gen X, Y, and the current millenial generation of asian-americans are complete wasters. There's really no cultural roots or ground being broken here. It's just another cycle of everything that we've seen before. The Millenials are by far the worst and have internalized the worst white liberal SJW bullshit that is very self sabotaging. It's a self defeating and self perpetuating cycle of self hate and negativity that permeates all aspects of the asian-american community.  There is a lack of dignity, a lack of trust, and a lack of direction to asian-americans that I can't quite draw a comparison with any other group of people. As I said other minorities have issues in the U.S. too but what they don't lack is dignity. Sometimes I think dignity is far more important in life. People die regularly over honor and dignity. Yet, asian-americans throw away these things and degrade the community to try and pander to the majority. It's pathetic. It's the mentality of a whore.  This really isn't going to change anytime soon until asian-americans develop a strong and lasting sense of cultural community in the U.S. We see a few very key and vocal figureheads popping up now and then but no major movement of music, media, and icons that are there to shape AA's.   This is why so many asian-americans go all in with white identity. There is a complete lack of asian identity in the U.S. it's ridiculous.   It took me years and years of soul searching before I figured out that my own identity is not keyed into one country at all. I am the shaper of my own identity regardless of the country i'm in at the time. With that realization comes power but it will never be the status quo way of thinking.

Tonight's recap is brought to you by Pizza Hut; home of the Super Supreme (gentlemen) Pan Pizza! Pizza Hut, it seems like a good idea until you've put some in your mouff (dats wat she sed).  Well gentleman that clusterfucko threado was the anticlimactic antithesis of a good idea.  After much hand wringing and justifying of muh feelz in r/A2x, threadstarter's call to arms fell on deaf ears and empty seats, as possibly imaginary AF allies decided reddit's anonymity was too risky to their delicate sensibilities to withstand and boycotted it in droves.  Either that or like many here suspect: dey jus don givva fuck bout us nor a united Asian community.  We are wandering in the desert alone, fellas. Son, I am disappoint.   To the heart of the matter, the five hundred seventy something replied thread devolved into a pissing match and a one-sided appeal to apathy, much to the chagrin of idealist community-minded folks.  Others, including some of the proported ""shitlords"" here, correctly expressed their cynicism. More importantly though, I'm sure other enthic or race-based subreddits and white nationalists got a top kek at witnessing our dysfunction.  Way to go, team.  Uncle Chans and Aunt Tan tag team it up to show all you mofos just who's got the biggest dick.  Spurred by pseudo progressive ideologies and self aggrandizement, White Knights Extraordinaires joined forces with the Queen of the Harpies to let everyone know that it's OK, nay fashionable, to mock the lowly Asian male. I haven't seen this much disingenuous hand waiving and obfuscation of the issues since I read JFang's misandrist take on the Elliot Rodgers kill spree. ""Self reflection is control and therefore unsconscionable"" and ""Old world patriarchy nullfies new world castration"" were their rallying cries which ultimately support the satus quo and white supremacy.  With friends like these, right fellas?  Elsewheres, 30-50 AMs tried in vain to negotiate desire in the few AFs sympathetic enough to friendzone the entire thread, while I bought toilet paper for the ensuing shitshow. Collectively, we westernized AMs inspire pity, not respect; contempt and annoyance, not attraction.  Sorry, they just don't see us in that way and they may never will.   So, where does that leave us and our community?  Like I stated in the earlier AF unicorn thread, you are free from any duty or obligation to  Liberated Outspoken Asian Female Feminists (LOAFFs).  Better to realize a shit hand and cut your losses now then after you've married poorly. Build yourself up. Be the best version of you. Knock the pedestals down.  Big ups, mah ninjas, big ups."

AsianMasculinity,3dvtxo,rexelus,8,Mon Jul 20 16:11:01 2015 UTC,"I don't see how this is feasible. I WILL say that this is KEY to forming an EFFECTIVE alliance, as AW have a significant integration/acceptance in western nations, specifically the US. However, consider these:  1) AF have access to all types of men, as they are hypersexualized. If they only like asian men and don't like others, great. But they CAN date out, EASILY, if they want to. This imbalance (asian men are, at face value, disadvantaged, but it is not impossible) creates a rift in worldviews. Only a mature AF that even has this issue in interest will be worth 'allying' with.  2) Maturity: 9/10 AF I see regularly are unaware or don't want to be aware of these issues. Presenting them with this type of subject will immediately deem you in the ""bitter man who can't get any"" category. You need social proof in order to garner this respect. When I dated white women, the asian women that knew me were very receptive to my points of view (sad but true). The moment I worked at corporate, it started all over. As an asian male, I had to actively demonstrate social proof for people to take double turns and rethinking their prejudices on me."
AsianMasculinity,3dvtxo,annemarielaw,9,Tue Jul 21 04:17:17 2015 UTC,"The only communication that needs to happen is us, as a whole, giving Asian females the middle finger and going our own way.  Remember that women are drawn to male spaces that are powerful. We lack power, we lack prestige, we have no honor, and we are given no quarter in today's society. Until we create a space that is for AM only and is also powerful, it is useless to argue against the hypergamous instincts of women. In this society, white is right. That means that any amount of discourse between us and Asian females would have to happen with us in a position of power. Then we can shock their preconceived notions enough that they might actually listen.  Fuck doing that though. So far as I'm concerned, they fucked us. And continue to fuck us by sucking up to whitey's dick. I don't care anymore. I don't care about them, their struggles, or anything else. I'm indifferent to their suffering and I couldn't care less what they think of me when they see me with white girls. I've been hated on and ostracized for merely having the gumption to take a risk and step outside my race since none of the Desi girls that I know are willing to give me the time of day. It's not even like I'm an unattractive schlub. I'm tall, athletic, well put-together, and I know I'm a good fuck. No, they aren't interested because society at large isn't interested. We have no power, so they afford us no dignity. Their only thought is to control our sexuality so that they can control us with access to pussy once they're done being cum dumpsters for fucking losers. Fuck everything about it.  The only way we'll ever retake control of ourselves and our sexuality is by walking the fuck away. By saying ""fuck you!"" to their shame and self-hate and learning to live entirely for ourselves. I am an Indian Man, I live for myself. My masculinity is for me, my sexuality is my own. I will not consign it to others in the name of cooperation. I will not trade my freedom for the fleeting appreciation of women who don't fucking matter. I go my own way and you can either step aside or get crushed under my heel.  /rant.

Can't cook Chinese food, etc etc. Also if the wife doesn't speak Chinese, the chance that the children also will is slim. If the parents aren't good at English this destroys any possibility of them communicating with their grandchildren. In most instances I doubt it is really a racial purity thing, it is just a strong cultural thing.  With daughters, the grandchildren are the ""outside"" or ""mother's side"" grandchildren. These are, in some sense considered ""less related"" than grandchildren from a son's side. So once again, there is usually a bit less bother about a daughter marrying foreign."

AsianMasculinity,3dn4e4,fembot12,11,Fri Jul 17 16:52:29 2015 UTC,"The problem is that you're equating lack of awareness with race traitor behavior.  This is a false equivalence.  Most people are devoid of awareness.    This comparison is largely between unaware race traitors (sucking up to whites), and unaware non-race traitors (mostly associate with their own kind).  Obviously, the former will have far more issues, but there are also aware race traitors and aware non-race traitors.  Just to convey this in an easy way:    unaware traitor - Uncle Chan, vaguely or strongly believes in SJW stuff, supports feminism, unaware of social disadvantages against non-white males (but may vaguely acknowledge problems with blacks and the police)  aware traitor - Is acutely aware that social value of a minority is low, and seeks to remedy that by latching onto whites.  Enthusiastically rejects aspects of his own race's culture, language (may be embarrassed to use them in front of other whites).    unaware normal - Mingles mostly with coracial individuals.  Doesn't consciously recognizes problems facing men of his race, although he may have a gut feeling of resentment against the outcomes of these problems.    aware normal - Fully recognizes factors which negatively weigh against males of his race.  Doesn't explicitly wish to marry up with a white woman per se, and has enough balls to speak in his native tongue, make native food, etc. without fear of being viewed as a stereotype.  Has coracial friends.    Obviously it's healthiest to be a ""normal"" (not ashamed of your race and seeking white approval).  But it's also healthier, on an individual level, to be unaware.  Awareness, particularly in a racial sense, opens one's eyes to the fact that the entire world (at least the one immediately surrounding you) is subconsciously, and often consciously, against you.  Awareness is undoubtedly healthy for the community at large, because it allows them to effect change.  But at the individual level, it's extra stress.    A good analogy is how smart people are more prone to mental health problems than average people.  Smart people are aware enough to internalize the futility of existence and struggle.  This bodes badly for them.    Or, imagine there was a comet heading toward earth.  If everyone knew about it, maybe the world's militaries and space agencies could do something about it (good for the group).  If only you knew about it, and somehow were unable to tell others, you would just worry about it until it happened (bad for the individual).    Obviously, I advocate spreading awareness, because awareness is needed to change the situation."

AsianMasculinity,3dn4e4,Disciple888,3,Fri Jul 17 23:23:24 2015 UTC,"I'm not quite sure I understand your point. I may need to think more about it. Just to clarify, your definition of traitor on an ethnic identity (as defined in the above post) scale is low/high or can be either? Also,  the same question but on the acculturation scale.  Based on your definitions, I don't feel there are many 'aware traitors' in the community. Most I would think fall into the category of 'unaware normal'. Would you agree with that? If that's true, your argument is that conversion from 'unaware normal' to 'aware normal' is not related to ethnic identity (and hence psychological well being)?"
AsianMasculinity,3dn4e4,reelsies,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:43:53 2015 UTC,"My point is simply that this question--   is it healthier to be a self-aware AM or healthier to be an Uncle Chan?   --presents a false dichotomy by equating Uncle Chan behavior (race traitor) with lack of racial awareness.    You say that ethnic identity correlates with well being.  Makes sense.  However, this doesn't answer your question of ""is it better to be a self aware AM""?    There are plenty of Asians who run in mostly Asian circles who are not racially aware.  If anything, they wouldn't need to be, because they're insulated from anti-Asian sentiments.  These types of people would have high ethnic identity and well being.  This was personally true for me; there was a huge difference in going from a mostly Asian high school to a mostly white college, despite the fact that I'm not even east Asian.     Based on your definitions, I don't feel there are many 'aware traitors' in the community. Most I would think fall into the category of 'unaware normal'.    Definitely true.  The very act of being aware lends itself to pro-racial views.  If one were racially aware AND a race traitor, they would suffer a lot of psychological trauma from consciously realized feelings of inferiority, guilt, and cognitive dissonance.    Still, this type does exist, particularly in women.  Which makes sense, because women are happy to feel inferior on some level.  My opinion is that women who are particularly aware of anything depressing (be it racial or otherwise) tend to have psychological problems, and make for bad girlfriends with moody dispositions and perma-bitchface.     your argument is that conversion from 'unaware normal' to 'aware normal' is not related to ethnic identity (and hence psychological well being)?   I think becoming aware is negatively related to psychological well being.  It is much easier to go through life without consciously realizing that things suck.    In the case of racial awareness, it's even worse, because the negative outcomes only affect certain groups (non-whites) and not others.  In the trope of people getting depressed because life is futile and meaningless, at least our inevitable extinction/death affects everybody equally.  Additionally, it reveals people you know and meet to be subconsciously and even consciously against you, which puts a strain on social relations."
AsianMasculinity,3dn4e4,BKTHROW2,2,Sat Jul 18 05:22:34 2015 UTC,"Those people who are isolated from anti Asian sentiments are quite rare, if not  impossible unless they and the people around them consume no media and are completely unaffected by white supremacy   The only way for the unaware to stay healthy is to not move anywhere outside of these Asian enclaves, otherwise they will encounter racist sentiments that will cause internal dissonance   And personally, that sounds like a pretty restrictive and unsustainable way of life"
AsianMasculinity,3dn4e4,reelsies,1 point,Sat Jul 18 08:26:32 2015 UTC,"On a national scale, they're rare.  I grew up in a heavily Asian suburb, and there were very strong east Asian cliques which consumed lots of Korean and Chinese media.    That often changes after high school, though."
AsianMasculinity,3dn4e4,reelsies,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:55:11 2015 UTC,"Gotcha, I completely understand your point. It was my mistake for overreaching with the racial identity / racial awareness connection. The reason I made that connection was that I assumed the people in the study started from a place of no ethnic identity (whitewashed) and some number of them developed a stronger ethnic identity (those being the ones with high psychological well-being). In my mind, to evolve from no ethnic identity to strong ethnic identity requires a certain amount of awareness (otherwise, why would you do it?). However, some people may start with a strong ethnic identity to begin with and in general the relationship between the two (identity and awareness) may be complicated.  I do think that what was presented in the study was interesting in itself (that having a strong ethnic identity is correlated with psychological well-being and high assimilation is inversely related to psychological well-being) since even though both conclusions may be sensible it wasn't something I knew was experimentally verified."
AsianMasculinity,3dn4e4,iherdulikepsydukz,1 point,Sat Jul 18 05:46:20 2015 UTC,"Someone could evolve a stronger ethnic identity simply by moving.  That generally doesn't happen, but it's been increasing more in recent years, as desirable places to live are now more heavily Asian than they were 20 years ago.  There are such things as Asian suburbs.    Another thing to consider is the role of family.  Traditional societies have big families, which lend themselves to high well being.  Having a higher ethnic identity would correlate to having a big family network, and in turn to high well being."

The thrust of OP's post wasn't really about the intent of the individual or being consciously a sycophant or not.  In the study, presumably the aware/unaware are grouped together and it seems the study's findings hold (although I take your point there may be variation within the group).    I would go further and question the virtues of being 'unaware normal'.  I think those who are 'aware normal' who manage their emotional state, who get beyond the anger phase, who shut down their instinctive negative reactions (ie: when seeing AF-WM) are in a slightly better position than 'unaware normal'.  The latter are following natural instinct to their own, but are at a loss when they are blindsided by white group behavior.  The key is can the 'aware normals' master their emotional state, and not give into blind rage; but find constructive ways to engage with other Asians and keep whites at bay.  The aware normal have to do the heavy-lifting of change; but that can actually be invigorating."

Yes this is true. Ironically, the fog is intentionally hidden from us and this benefits whites.

Do you think WMAF would be as popular if AFs realize all the subconscious racism and propaganda (emasculation) that goes on with the media? It's like democracy, everyone has ""free choice"" but at every step there's propaganda and the media influencing people's mind in one direction. Although to be fair, I'm giving women too much credit here...  Hiding the enemy, and getting Asians to blame themselves (thereby not challenging the legitimacy of the ""system"" and the assumptions that the system take for ""truths"") benefits whites and the status quo.  Once you know, you are no longer in conflict with yourself. The assumptions made by white society is that Asians can receive the same as whites given the same amount of effort. This is a lie. When Asians see the tangible differences in effort/reward, they blame themselves instead of questioning whether the system is fair in the first place. Another assumption is that assimilation is possible. This is also a lie. As long as you look Asian, even if you have been here 10 generations, you will still be considered a ""foreigner"".  Once the system is challenged, the model minority becomes the yellow peril. If the system is not challenged, we are ""good"" Asians that ""know our place""."

I did some weird shit as a kid."

AsianMasculinity,3dn01k,ntran2,2,Sat Jul 18 18:19:06 2015 UTC,"Sup brotha, I can help you out a little bit for grooming and maintaining your facial hair. When I began to grow facial hair I was clueless on how to to groom and clean it up. Thankfully my bro in law is a barber and tells me some great tips. I will gladly make a video if it will help but here are some things you can do: 1. Shave your neckbeard, anything that is below your jawline. It gives a more clean look. An easy way to keep a straight hairline of your beard is to feel where your jawline is and just shave along that. 2. I know there are some oils that are specifically made for beards but I've just put conditioner on it whenever I shower haha. If I get a chance to grow my beard and try out some oils I'll lyk 3. If you plan to grow out your beard just make sure to clean up the neckbeard so you wont look as bummy. But then again, some ppl prefer to have that look, I personally don't.  As of right now I have a chinstrap because my family in Laos arent used to seeing an asian with a full beard so I think it makes my foreign family uncomfortable haha. I also grow ALOT of bodyhair, on my chest, and back (fuckin sucks) Here are some pics of me to get a sense of what I mean in those tips I gave you:  Clean shave  Chinstrap  Stubbz  Full beard"

I remember I went on 3 dates in a row with self identified Native American women once. They all looked completely white, but they had scholarships and shit so guess it's legit?   They were all smart as shit and definitely knew what was up.   Smart Latinas. Their transcending of catholic guilt and the marianismo complex is not dissimilar to what we go through. Emphasis on ""smart"".   Russians. Although Russians can be kinda bitchy.   As a constant backburner project, I'm trying to find it within myself and overcome the whitesplaining and whitewashing and date a black girl at some point. Not succeeding so far though. My lack of success in this endeavor is also why I don't blame Asian girls too much for doing what they do tbh."

She is more compatible with my values than any Chinese-American girl I've met.    So don't give up on Asian females just yet my bros. In the end, if our goal is to strengthen our hold in whatever western country we have found ourselves in, we have to do it primarily with future generations of 100% Asians IMO.

In reality I was attracted to all types of women but I was not confident or had the belief that I could have anything but Asians. During this time in life I had trouble even finding Asian women that were even attracted to me that I connected with.

AsianMasculinity,3do2tz,MrbananasCoco,7,Sat Jul 18 01:39:48 2015 UTC,Because they're not smart and still have the innate desire to wife and cuddle with an Asian woman. When they should learn to evolve from their primitive desires that are coming from their reptilian brain and learn to provide value. This is a serious thing. Asian men need more power and respect in this world and people here are focusing on getting laid and how to get a white girl.  FUCK outta here!  I really fucking hate these faggots having a preference for Asian woman. They date out more than us and Asian men go above and beyond demonstrating loyalty to them.

AsianMasculinity,3do2tz,Genghis-Brah,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:08:15 2015 UTC,"Idk mane, I used to only fuck with white girls, but after this trip to China, I can't imagine women from anywhere else. Getting girls in the West is purely a game that practices your sales skills. I can sell myself to almost any girl, but never really truly connect with them. In China, I don't have to worry about any of that and go directly to making real connections, rather than just making superficial flirty jokes. The really quality girls can see through your stupid funny, cocky tricks and won't take any of the bullshit.  Most white girls are simply too simple minded and one dimensional, I feel like they don't have the brains to deserve being the mother of my children and none of them had been able to keep my interests for very long. I have never respected any white girl or had any real connections with them, but I have true respect for women in China, who I'm able to have very deep connections with almost immediately.   It's not about the looks or personality, or any bullshit like that, but about the long term visions/dreams, social awareness, and wisdom from a different perspective. I don't detect this in Asian American girls at all though.  In China, it is possible to find yin yang balance and a girl who can help you improve yourself long term. In America, regardless of race, there is only fuck bitches, get money, lift weights, eat dinner, repeat."

For me, I'm only interested in dating Asian girls because I care about cultural compatibility with my partner (including her long term expectations about what it means to be in the same family). I also care about being with someone I can pass down my culture with and obviously that's the most easily done with someone that's the same race as me.

AsianMasculinity,3do2tz,fembot12,4,Sat Jul 18 02:06:33 2015 UTC,My take is a Brown girl has to be special to get my long term attention. None of that feminism bullshit and none of that self hate and sexual repression. Kind of hard to find in the west and I could never see myself with a fob.
AsianMasculinity,3do2tz,twezbaba,4,Sat Jul 18 02:09:51 2015 UTC,"I could never see myself with a fob.   I could, and potentially would.  The only thing is that I eat meat, including beef, and I really don't care for most Indian food (excepting a few things, like Tandoori, and some south Indian).  I also hate spicy food (spicy as in piquant, not use of spices)  I also feel like the linguistic problem would severely cut down the viability of a FOB girl long term partner.  All Koreans speak Korean, and large swathes of China speak the same dialect of Chinese.  But if you don't speak Hindi, you're sort of localized."

AsianMasculinity,3dlknk,todaiji,9,Fri Jul 17 06:46:19 2015 UTC,"Your timing couldn't be better.  I just did a study on the major Asian nations. Which one are you from?  I can start posting them so Asians learn the TRUTH about these white ""Christians"" and the horrible crimes they committed against us.  You mentioned Mestizos so I'm guessing Philippines  (sorry, don't have time to format)  First up is Spanish ""Christians""  Spanish crimes against the Philippines: ● gave the natives a lethal epidemic of smallpox and and tuberculosis  Here are some specific ""Christian values"" known as racist hypocrisy and stomping on human rights ● previously communal lands used for substinence were stolen stolen and privitized by ""Catholic priests""  ● forced into hard labor to build churches, forts, shipyards, and perform wood cutting  ● forced household to pay punitive tributes annually ● racist policies made Spaniard's the top class and natives at the bottom. ● bogus ""laws"" to ""buy"" the native's foods and livestock at firesale prices - while the natives were starving. ● Spain punished ongoing rebellions by burning whole villages for each Spaniard killed.  The Philippine resistance: ● The natives burned all their livestock and houses and mountained resistance throughout Spanish rule ● Ever defiant, the natives engaged in mass disobedience and to farm and killed their livestock to starve everyone INCLUDING themselves ● Shipyards were constantly attacked to hinder the oppressive regime.  Sadly, depsite all the overwhemling evidence that there is no god, or at least, no god that cares about the people of the Philipines, many remain Catholics.  In 1899, America aided the Philipines to purge Spain, ostensibly to ""free the Philippine peoples"". However, America forced Spain to ""sell"" the Philipines, a country they invaded and stole, to America, another grand thief, for 20 million usd. A new wave of war crimes would begin with America. See Philipines by America for more white ""Christian"" crimes.    Now, American ""Christians"" (first offense)  Background information:  The Philippine Revolution of 1896 all but defeated the Spanish army. The Philippines was about to enjoy independence from these racist white ""Christian"" imperialists.  Then America showed up to ""help"" them fight for freedom. What the Phillipino people didn't realize was that the racist white ""Christian"" Americans simply wanted to steal the Phillippines for itself. Thus, the Phlippine-American War.  PHASE 1  1898 -  America ""buys"" the Phillippines from Spain   After Spain was defeated by the Philippines,  America betrayed the Filipinos by ""buying"" the Philippines from the Spainish imperialists for a tiny US$ 20 million in the Treaty of Paris in 1898. Thus, denying them their freedom, which these white ""Christian"" hypocrites love to preach about. How can Spain sell something they lost  possession of? They can't, but rule of law and integrity do not apply to the racist white ""Christians"" whether they are Spanish or American.  PHASE 2  1899-1902 - Phlippine-American War  On February 4, 1899 , America faked the Battle of the Manila Bay to wrest control of the Philippines from the Spanish Army which had been all but defeated by the Filipinos since the Philippine Revolution of 1896.  American General Elwell Otis, claims this was not planned. However, scholars conclusively established that this Battle of Manila was deliberately planned by America. Notice a striking similarity in America's ""accidents"" with Vietnam, Cuba, Iraq, Afghanistan etc...always an ""accident"".  Following the FAKE Battle of Manilla, is the first recorded GENOCIDE of the 20th Century, a historical fact conveniently ignored by most history textbooks including those in the Philippines.  During this war, American General Otis ordered the secert executions of many who signed a petition asking for autonomy. This are the western values known as ""democracy"", ""human rights"", and ""all men are created equal"".  Death toll:  That's such a harsh term. The white ""Christian"" Americans would call genocide ""benevolent assimilation"".  20,000 Filipino soldiers died and 250,000 to 1,000,000 civilians died from rapes, massacres, famine, and disease caused by Americans.  Americans during this war killed more Philippine people than WW2.  When Filipinos righteously killed these invading American genocidal ""Christians"", the American military retaliated by slaughtering defenseless civilians.  Here are some ways white rugged heroes (who claimed to ""civilize"" the Philipines with ) waged war: ● raping defenseless women and children ● pillaging villages of all valuables they found and  breaking chairs, tables and mirrors which they could not carry away ● Torching entire civilian villages ● Slaughtering children and adults ages 10 and above - unless they ran out of ""enemy"" soldiers, then they killed them all ● Massacre entire populations such as the 17,000 civilians in Caloocan ● Imprisoning civilians in concentration camps where they would die from diease and starvation.

All these western values has been used and perfected on the Native Indians, whose corpses serve as the foundation of the American ""Christian"" nation.  After math:  Today, as a result of much violence and brainwashing: ● 80%+ are Catholics despite being completely screwed over by white ""Christians"". ● Native stories and folklore have been replaced with American and Spanish ""literature"" that exhalt their ""greatness"" and ""benevolence"". ● Popular culture is based on American sports, tv shows, and films that is simply more pro-western propaganda. ● Spanish art is celebrated  More Revelations:  Here are some quotes from white ""Christians"" regarding this war:  Here are the things the presidents told the public.... ● ""That there was nothing left for us to do but to take them all, and to educate the Filipinos, and uplift and civilize and Christianize them, and by God’s grace do the very best we could by them, as our fellow-men for whom Christ also died."" - President McKinley ""  ● ""a war to extend Anglo-American progress and decency"" - President Theodore Roosevelt  ● ""The war in the Philippines has been conducted by the American army with scrupulous regard for the rules of civilized warfare, with self-restraint, and with humanity never surpassed."" - Secretary of War Elihu Root  Here's what the American military said and did in private.... ● ""I want no prisoners. I wish you to kill and burn, the more you kill and burn the better it will please me...Kill everyone over the age of ten"" - General Jacob Smith, Samar Campaign  ● Black American soldiers , wanting to fight for their country (can't understand why), got there only to hear white ""soldiers"" call the Filipinos ""niggers"" all day. Many white ""soldiers"" called the war the ""nigger killing business"". Some of these Black soldiers switched sides to fight the white Americans instead.  ""the Americans came to the Philippines not as a friend, but as an enemy masking as a friend.""  Do they ever come any other way? No. Just ask the Native Indians, Koreans, Africans, Mexicans, Chinese, East Indians, Middle East, Hawaiins, etc  Notice how white barbarity against non-whites is always far more savage than those crimes during wars against other whites. They are deeply racist savages.  Americans did provide schools, public sanitation, public health, and infrastructure. Although, much of it was self serving so American businesses could make money from the Phillipines more effectively.

AsianMasculinity,3dlknk,countercom2,6,Fri Jul 17 08:57:24 2015 UTC,"American ""Christians"" (second offense - ongoing)  PHASE 1  1942-1945 - Phillipine-Japanese-American War  ● Using artillery bombardment to virtually obliterate the city with zero regard for the innocent Filipinos living there, America murdered hundreds of thousands of Filipinos in its war to remove the Japanese military from Manila. This is a result of their sick racist beliefs.  ● While America did fight alongside the Filipinos to purge the Japanese from the Philippines, it was done to protect American interests (remember, America ""owned"" the Philippines).  PHASE 2  1946 - The Philippines get FAKE independence on paper  The Philippines gained indepdendence ostensibly because America felt they were ready. The actual reason is that pro-us structures had thoroughly infested Philippine's political, and economic systems. Some examples include:  ● imposed free market policies that enrich America by exploiting the Philippines (see the book Bad Samaritans) ● American military bases are installed in the Philiipines despite massive protests ● American gang rapist ""soldiers"" are unpunished ● Their own trade, foreign affairs, and immigration policies require American approval (Tydings-McDuffie Act) ● Thousands of Filipino soldiers during WW2 die without the benefits America had promised them  PHASE 3  1946+ Murdering nationalist leaders and installing pro-western puppets (AKA traitors to the Filippino people)  ● The American CIA assassinated all of the nationalist politicians who wanted to free the Philippines from racist white ""Christian"" Americans. Instead, the CIA propped up the corrupt pro-western elite bourgeois like Ferdinand Marcos who is a traitor to the Philippine people.  ● Estimates of his ill-gotten gains range from US$3 to US$35 billion. Some suggest US$100 billion+  and  perhaps even trillions of dollars.  While these latter sums may he fanciful, the legacy of the Marcos dictatorship is all too real - an economy struggling just to pay the interest on its foreign debt and a seriously compromised democracy seemingly unable to shake off entrenched corruption.   When they are referring to trillions, they are probably referring to The Black Eagle Trust, which was about America's theft of Imperial Japan's lootting of Asia during ww2. The best book on this is  Gold Warriors Americas Recovery Yamashitas http://www.amazon.com/Gold-Warriors-Americas-Recovery-Yamashitas/dp/1844675319/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1418185672&sr=8-1&keywords=Yamashita+gold&pebp=1418185673876 link to????????? added - white crimes against asians and white supremacy blueprint - Gold Warriors - America's Secret Recovery of Yamashita's Gold.pdf  After math:  ● After ww2, white ""Christian"" American GeneralMacArthur along with the CIA whitewashed their crimes in the school textbooks, news, etc. The CIA even call it 'their greatest victory': being able to plunder the Philippines and still brainwash the filipino people into loving them.   But, it's not just school textbooks, here's how one commenter described it...  ""I just couldn't believe how terrible Philippine television is. It's the most brainwashing, white loving propaganda tool I've ever seen.""  How effective was this brainwashing?   Most Asian countries give only 10-30% approval of American foreign policy. The Philippines was the only country in the WORLD to give their former serial raping mass murdering ""Christians"" an 80% approval rating. 150 years ago Filipinos went from heroically slaughtering these racist ""Christian"" rapists and murderers with machetes to becoming their loudest cheerleaders. That's the power of propaganda and why it must be exposed at all levels.  ● 80%+ are Catholics despite being completely screwed over by white ""Christians"". ● Native stories and folklore have been replaced with American and Spanish ""literature"" that exhalt their ""greatness"" and ""benevolence"". ● Popular culture is based on American sports, tv shows, and films that is simply more pro-western propaganda. ● Spanish art is celebrated  Sources: ● Filipino -/ American Postcolonial Psychology: Oppression, Colonial Mentality, And Decolonization: E.

The Islamic Golden Age was when Europe was in the Dark Ages and it was Islamic kingdoms that kept the works of Ancient Greeks like Plato, Socrates, Aristotle. Whenever I challenge my white professor about whitewashed history, they always say this is through a western university or school perspective, and they don't know much about others but they know a lot about themselves.   White people act like all asians are drones, they are smart but doesn't accomplish anything. Just like how they see asians studying all the time during school but they want asians to work hard but never get results, that is why business keep asian down at low levels.   Like Disciple said, a competent Asian is a threat to white supremacy. White bias is in filipino tv, a lot of celebrities are mixed.

AsianMasculinity,3dlknk,BobXCIV,6,Fri Jul 17 14:55:08 2015 UTC,"Studied APUSH in HK. I learned a fair bit about US atrocities against Native Americans, East Asians, and Blacks. What I learned was still a bit filtered, but it's enough to make you really angry. What made me even more mad is that these atrocities are often conducted by historical role models. FUCK DAT.   My guess as to why many americans in high school don't really learn about these atrocities: It's not on the fucking APUSH test, so no one bothers to teach it (assuming they even take APUSH, and most don't). On APUSH tests, they will only have 1 question related to minority treatment in the States. I'm talking about a multiple choice question, not an essay question. They actually make it ""not worth your time"" to study minority-related history in the US. That is so fucked, that is seriously some Japanese right-wing textbook level shit and no one bats an eye. Yeah, those atrocities are somewhat covered in the American Pageant, but who actually reads the whole book anyway. And APUSH is meant to be a pretty in-depth study of American history, so you can bet on them dumber white bois knowing nada (""Where is my white privilege I worked for my success hur dur the last thing that happened to blacks was slavery"").   I went to a good university in the States. My friend took a US history course; his professor gave the class 200 pages worth of notes for an upcoming test. Guess what? 1 page on blacks, a couple lines on Native Americans in Manifest Destiny, and the date of the Chinese Exclusion Act. That's racist.   Racism in education is REAL. Fuck protecting the idolatry of influential whites, fuck protecting them white boi feelings if it means teaching a WARPED HISTORY. That's asshole behavior."
AsianMasculinity,3dlknk,nukacola89,2,Fri Jul 17 13:40:55 2015 UTC,"I took APUSH in the US (I'm American) and it's true that the minorities are generally left out. After learning about the Fort Laramie treaty, Native Americans are left out. The course does focus a lot on black history, but ignore the issues after the Civil Rights Act of 1964.  The textbook I used was actually pretty nice because it still focused on a lot of modern issues concerning minorities in America. Also, my teacher too focused a lot on minority issues.  Plus, I heard this year, though, that there was actually a large focus on Native Americans on the exam. It's too bad I wasn't there to take it since I was actually very interested in Native American issues when I took the course and exam."

I grew up in the Philippines and studied there as well. Unless you didn't go to school there, Romance of the Three Kingdoms was discussed in my 2nd year of HS. Asian history was greatly emphasized since 1st grade. I barely know much of Western history which is one of the reasons I even browse Reddit since this was barely talked about in school. Sure we learned Greek mythology in English class but that was not greatly emphasized on. History classes were heavy on Philippine history and Asian history.

My textbook had a huge list of PROs how it's actually a good thing we were ""colonialized."" Let’s not mention all the people they killed, but let’s list it as a pro that they had the benefit of learning English and getting European blood. Yes, European blood was listed as a pro in my text book.   Was this false?  I didn't go to school in Phillipines so I don't know. I went to school in US.

AsianMasculinity,3dlrlr,Residentblackdude,27,Fri Jul 17 08:22:04 2015 UTC,"Lemme quickly share this (it's non-PC so yeah), I wonder how Asian women would react if she read this thread:http://www.lipstickalley.com/showthread.php/366111-What-s-really-going-on-with-Asian-women - Can't get too defensive cause it's mostly black women in there (therefore no patriarchy/misogyny accusations to fall back on). Highlights:   Since I've been in college I keep meeting Asian women who say to me ""I've only seen myself with a White guy"", or ""I don't even find Asian men attractive"". I'm a black woman, mind you, so no one else think it's weird that 99.9% of the time I have Asian women ( when we discuss men & dating)tell me that they don't find Asian men attractive?  I swear, some Asians are better Uncle Toms than the most Uncle Tommingest Uncle Ruckus black motherfucker. The self-hate is crazy.   I think it's weird for them to be so open with saying how they don't find their race of men attractive. I mean the country is indeed majority white but I'm at the point now where I'm a little uncomfortable, although I know to expect it now. Sometimes I have to defend Asian men when around them and tell them of good experiences I've had with them as friends and what I've seen from them in relationships. I've even had several Asian women who were married to an Asian guy ( like Vietnamese, Japanese or other) say they wish they had married a White.   Asian women and black men remind me a lot of each other. Hmmm   People talk about black men and some of them definitely have self hate issues, but I find Asian Women to be the absolute worst. So many of them seem to think that they HAVE to date a White man. Something is up when 45% of Asian women in the US are married to White Men. I can't tell you how many times i've been outside and seen Asian women with White men and the way they act with them it's just pathetic. They act like they have some huge prize. I've even heard Asian men complain that Asian women are too into White men.   I have an Asian roommate (her family is from Laos) who prefers white men, especially European men. She is average-looking and slightly overweight, although short. I'm paraphrasing her here, but this is what she told me about why she doesn't date Asian men (and no, I didn't ask her): ""Asian men are so boring. They want to control you and tell you what to do. 'Be here at this time, be there at this time.' They're not romantic. Asian men want petite girls, and I'm not petite. I want a guy who'll like me for me. The Americanized Asian guys are better, but they just don't do it for me like European guys.""   This is so true! I thought black men dogged out black women (and black women dogged out black men), but we have nothing on Asian women dogging out Asian men! It was unsolicited too.  asian women will date any white guy. i dont think its about money either, i just think its just that asians think white people are better than them. some of the asian at my job are dating white men who are, struggling teachers, managers and truck drivers. i never understood why people on here think that aw only date rich wm.....big ass myth  Random thought but i've noticed some asian women go for white men who most women wouldn't be interested in. I met this couple recently and this white guy was very socially awkward and odd and he was with this asian woman who was attractive and seemed more normal so I just wondered what she saw in the guy. I guess people like different things, but I have noticed other people mention it isn't uncommon for asian women to go for nerdy white men or vice versa, which just seems ironic when asian women talk negatively about asian men but don't always go for white men who would be seen as a catch.  Why do Black and Hispanic women have much less of inferiority complex than Asian women? Don't Asian women get treated better than Black and Hispanic women in general, by Whites? It seems that Black and Hispanic women are much more loyal to their own races and much more eager to embrace their cultural and ethnic heritages than Asian women. Why is that? Seems kind of strange if you ask me...   An asian women joins in:   I'm Vietnamese and I don't have any self hatred towards Asian men. My ex was Laos and he was very physically abusive. My other ex was Vietnamese and he cheated on me less then 24 hours of our relationship. All of my (6)aunties married Asian men and now there going through divorces. They can be abusive, chauvinist, and cheaters. Thus, changing the ways I view Asian men in general.  Currently, I only date whites, Hispanics, and mixed guys. I just find them more attractive.. It is a ""Preference"" thing. If i'm attracted to you, then i'm attracted to you, thats what it is. You can't force someone to be attracted to a certain race.  Asian women look for financial security because we want the best for our future generation. I look for someone who can provide me medicine, food, shelter, and good looking kids. Love can always develop later.. Ofcourse, i need to be physically attracted to someone in order to love them.   And someone replies:   I just don't understand how you can judge and swear off all Asian men based on TWO men. Just on those TWO experiences. There are plenty of Asian American men who are nothing like your exes. Have any of your non-Asian boyfriends done you wrong? I feel like if some of your white or hispanic boyfriends cheated on you or acted abusive towards you, you would still give white and hispanic men the benefit of the doubt as a whole. It's funny because sooo many of my Hispanic female friends have told me they don't like their own men because their are possessive and don't treat women right.    Another one replies:   So many generalisations. I have seen a study before on sexual partners that showed men from China & Japan have had far less sexual partners onaverage than the many white men in New Zealand & UK. White & Hispanic men have no problem sleeping around & lol at you saying you look to non Asian men to provide you with medicine food & shelter. Can those many Asian men who are hard working & in good jobs not provide that for you?"

Anyways, I wonder has anyone pointed out the role of sexism that Asian women have and still have to endure from their culture and their men that causes them to look down on their men. Many have the stereotype of Asian women being subservient(look at the comments on folks stereotyping the likes of Karrueche who's part Asian) and in places such as China women are still heavily regulated in terms of jobs, birth control,etc.      LOL. A few of the posters there use stereotypes to form their basis of reality. The jobs or birth control stuff... neither of them are true. I also see a few people believe the penis size by race thing.

The fact from what I read on reddit is that the majority of WMAF AF whores know that white dudes don't respect her, yet she still fucks them anyways. She is willing to debase herself for free, whereas an actual whore at least as the self respect to get paid.  The funny thing is that society condemns one kind of whoring, yet calls this even uglier kind of war bride whoring ""progressive"", ""free choice"" and if you don't agree with it, you are ""misogynistic"".  What a fucking joke. A whore is worth 100 WMAF AFs. A hot 20 year old escort, at least 500. There's no redeeming quality of the WMAF AF, do not insult the humble service provider."

AsianMasculinity,3dlrlr,bleuskeye,4,Sun Jul 19 09:49:21 2015 UTC,"Definitely clarifying. Further clarification: women who say these kinds of things have nothing against Asian men; they are deeply insecure about their looks and value because of it. They want their kids to be more successful than they are and hapas are known for their cuteness. Persecution is probably also much less likely to the mother of especially cute babies.  Also, assimilation via childbirth is a possibilty for Asian/ethnic women that simply doesn't exist for men. Assimilation is far more cultural for men rather than biological. That's why our media representation is so crucial. It's a cultural emissary that exists in the minds of people before we even see then and say hello.  I mentioned my dating experience because that's a legit motivation for interracial coupling. The media can say whatever they want about us Asian dudes but you'll never take those cute babies out of the minds of any girl who has seen Jon and Kate plus 8."

Import modeling is essentially a monetization of Yellow fever, or the fetishization of the Asian female body.   So girls who experience this everyday will see real quick what underlies part of the dynamic between AF and white males and become apprehensive. Just a more intense and exaggerated version of what every Asian girl goes through.   As to why Asian frat guys don't like me. I mean I have almost all non-Asian friends and I don't rep the whole ""Ebonics/edm/boba n'bitches"" scene they do. I agree with them that 9/10 Asian guys who live like me are fucked up in their identity, so I can't really blame them for assuming the tenth one is like that too.   It's just annoying to me because I had to figure all this shit out on my own and they had their frat brothers and Asian enclave community to help them. A lot of times I know more and care more about Asian shit than they do but they still acting like I'm the house negro, haha.

I actually lived in the east coast for a little bit where there were a lot of Asians.  I only remember good times.  When our family had to move to this Hicksville, it was really devastating for me.  Coming from a place where we all held hands in the classroom and sang about diversity, then moving to this corner of the country where racism is casually accepted, if not praised, It certainly had devastating consequences.

Some of the experiences of my Canadian FOB friends who grew up in Toronto during the same time period (NYC's Canadian equivalent) had many parallels with the experiences of Asian NYCers--while Toronto now has an Asian enclave, in the mid to late 90s, that enclave was still in the process of being established. A couple of my FOB Chinese friends who went to urban Torontonian middle schools in poor areas and few (East) Asians had classmates from all corners of the Earth who would give them shit: a few classmates would clown on their accents, bully them physically, steal stuff from their locker, etc... It didn't stop until my friends kicked the shit out of them.

This would indicate that whites felt inferior.   Having a race-based migration policy driven by reasons other than notions of supremacy led to a variety of contradictory statements to justify the policy. For example, poet and unionist Henry Lawson stated that he hated Chinese despite liking every Chinese person he had ever met. In his own words:   “I am anti-Chinese as far as Australia is concerned; in fact I am all for a White Australia. But one may dislike, or even hate, a nation without hating or disliking an individual of the nation. One may be on friendly terms; even pals in a way. I had a good deal of experience with the Chinese in the old years, and I never knew or heard of a Chinaman who neglected to pay his debts, who did a dishonest action, or who forgot a kindness to him or his, or was not charitable when he had the opportunity.”   How ridiculous does this sound, ""All chinamen I have met are decent, but chinese is scum""   ""Most of the early Chinese-Australia population was formed by Cantonese migrants from Guangzhou and Taishan, including some from Fujian, they came during the goldrush period of the 1850s. Marriage records show that between the 1850s and around the start of the 20th century, there were about 2000 legal marriages between white women and migrant Chinese men in Australia's eastern colonies, probably with similar numbers involved in de facto relationships of various kinds (ex: Cohabitation, sexual intimacy.)[68] The number of intermarriage declined, as stories of viciousness and the seduction of white women grew, mixed with opposition to intermarriage. Rallys against Chinese men taking white women became widespread, many Australian men saw the Chinese men intermarrying and cohabiting with white women, as an threat to the white race. In late 1878 there were 181 marriages between European women and Chinese men, and 171 couples cohabiting without matrimony, resulting in 586 Eurasian children.[69] Such numbers of Intermarriage would continue until 1880s and the 1930s."""

Lot's of Asian men on that sub even though they lift unfortunately have become Uncle Chans and Uncle Krishna's as a coping mechanism. Which is a shame because some of them are yoked but misguided philosophically. Honestly I did sympathize with them at times. He didn't choose his race. But spamming multiple websites about your issues is narcissistic and autistic. Honestly most of our personal issues would become alleviated if we saw more of our kind fucking non-Asian women in the mainstream media and porn. But not everyone can win the genetic lottery.   I'm under the age of 20 and even I still get vehemently annoyed when I see an Uncle Chan. I honestly don't want to help them because they will not want to see the light.

I only tell people I meet in China about my upbringing on a need to know basis, and pass as a Chinese local as default. Yeah, if I tell people I lived in the US for a long time since I was a kid, they will start noticing little things I do or think that are different, but if I don't, they can't really tell or pinpoint why, other than guessing I went to school abroad, which is common enough that it's not a big deal.

Seriously if we saw more of our own kind fucking white women and non-Asian women in the media and porn a lot of our problems, well the ones predicated in self-esteem issues would be lessened to a degree. Which is very difficult for us to speak on our issues to a wide amount of people, because most people would brush it away. Other races of men wouldmost likely revel in our pain and say, "" Just lift more Asian monkey and try harder.""  Yet how can we voice that publicly without being laughed at. Whites/blacks don't truly give a shit about Asian men being utilities. They enjoy our pain because it benefits them. Well I am not even an academic and I have gotten straight to a blue collar career. Never had the best high school grades anyways as they were shit tier. I don't even know if what I'm writing sounds articulate.   If you believe people are inherently selfish, an Asian woman wouldn't feel inclined to help her own race when she can just monkey branch like a baboon for some dick. Which is why I will never see them as friends. I find it an insult a lot of Asian men have preferences for them. But what can I do to a fucking idiot? Shit there are pricks here older than me who just had a realization they were Uncle Chans.   It is hard to even voice let alone articulate our struggles because of our issues are lack of representation on the media, female problems which tbh is most likely white women thirst, and a stereotype that we are nerdy males who are incapable to be leaders. Most of it is our fault because we desire to integrate with westerns, instead of evolving and having the mindset that we should by our actions become the standard westerns should follow.   I'm under the age of 20 and I don't have the financial resources hell the economical experience to fund a porn company. Just a guy recently out of high school talking shit on the internet.

Alright for the sloots, because they get to enjoy anal without the pain ;)  I'm serious though we don't have any viable mainstream male role models to help inspire our own men to reach greatness. If all we see is failure, what do you think our men will see in themselves? A lot of us here were unlucky depending on your perspective to be born in the world. I do say since I have a lack of role models to get inspiration from. It's time to become the role model I envisioned in my head to become a reality. It just sucks that the older Asian men in western society are simps and just want to work,work,work and to never create a legacy for themselves.

Yes, most of my friends are white and most of my girlfriends (well 2 out of 3) were white, but I'm fine with being whitewashed.   I've also personally never felt discriminated in academic/workplace/dating scene because of my race explicitly.  However I've spent the last month in China (where I truthfully feel completely out of place) and I've met some abcs/cbcs who were very bitter(and use this sub), they called me a race traitor (hanjian) for dating white girls and all this other stuff.  Not a troll post, but just curious on why you guys vehemently hate those of us who don't have a persecution complex.

AsianMasculinity,3dlrlr,asianmasaccount,2,Fri Jul 17 13:36:43 2015 UTC,"Man it's like this: socially we are in a box in the west. Sometimes it's a smaller box and sometimes it's a bigger box depending on where you are. Sometimes it ain't even a bad box. Nothing wrong with being a doctor or an engineer.   You probably just happen to fit into the box well. ""Pretty boy"" as you self described. I get that, I do too in med school. It's nice being mistaken for the ""neurologist"" or the ""cardiologist"" when you walk in instead of the ""nurse"" or ""housekeeping"" like black/Latina med students are when they walk in. People assume Asians are smart and careful, so even if you don't know something or flub a procedure, they STILL give you the benefit of the doubt.   Thing is, not everyone fits into the box well and it becomes limiting for people. A white dude can get girls in a lot of different ways. He can be a pretty boy, the ""dominant man"", even just an average joe. An Asian guy has VERY FEW roles that women find attractive in the box we are put in, but you fortunately happen to be in one of them. Most people aren't though, and at some point, most people hit one of the edges of the box are like ""huh, what's going on here?"" Then you see the box more and develop a ""persecution complex"", as you call it.  Trickiest part of all this is that the box shimmers and morphs. Sometimes you don't know if a setback is race based or if it would have happened to anyone. How an Asian guy is perceived in one country, one city, even one room can be different from another country, city, or room. Because of this, its a useful operative assumption to think that the box ain't real or that it's walls are kinda flimsy, as long as you keep it in your mind that this isn't necessarily the case.  From what you're saying, it just sounds like your life hasn't brushed up against enough racial discrimination for you to see it yet. This is probably a good thing, and in some ways I hope you read this post and are like ""yo this dude is tripping with his talk of boxes and shit, imma go drink some brews and fuck my white girl some more and be happy."" But just the fact that you are here asking about it makes me think that you're starting to see a little bit of what's going on.   Hard to unsee these things once you start seeing them, I guess. The ones of us who get hurt the least by discrimination, either by luck or because we are stronger at negotiating our own terms, see it the slowest."

AsianMasculinity,3dlrlr,ldw1988,4,Fri Jul 17 18:24:29 2015 UTC,"Masculinity personified for both the warrior and academic:   Kuan hastily pulled the reins to retire, but an arrow struck him in the arm. The shock of the blow made him turn the saddle and he fell from his horse . . . Kuan Ping escorted his father back to camp. There the arrow was extracted, but the head had been poisoned. The wound was deep, and the poison had penetrated to the bone. The right arm was discoloured and swollen and useless . . . Seeing that their leader would not retire and the wound showed no signs of healing, the various captains enquired far and near for a good surgeon to attend their general . . .   On day a person arrived in a boat . . . The visitor wore a square-cut cap and a loose robe. In his hand he carried a small black bag. He said his name was Hua T'o . . . He had heard of the wound sustained by the famous hero and had come to heal it . . . So Hua was introduced, asked to take a seat and, after the tea of ceremony, was shown the wounded arm.  ‘This was caused by an arrow,’ said the doctor, ‘There is some blackhead poison [wu-tau, root tuber of Aconitum carmichaeli] in the wound, and it has penetrated to the bone. Unless the wound is treated soon, the arm will become useless.’  ‘What do you propose to do?’ asked Kuan.  ‘I know I can cure the wound, but I think you will be afraid if the remedy.’  ‘Am I likely to be afraid of that when I am not even afraid of death? Death is only a return home after all.’  Then Hua said, ‘This is what I shall do. In a private room I shall erect a post with a ring attached. I shall ask you, Sir, to insert you arm through the ring, and I shall bind it firmly to the post. Then I shall cover your head with a quilt so that you cannot see, and with a scalpel I shall open up the flesh right down to the bone. Then I shall scrap away the poison. This done, I shall dress the wound with a certain preparation, sew it up with a thread, and there will be no further trouble. But I think you may quail at the severity of the treatment.’  Kuan smiled, ‘It all sound easy enough,’ said he, ‘but why the post and the ring?’  Refreshments were then served, and after a few cups of wine the warrior extended his arm for the operation. With his other hand he went on with his game of wei-chi[Chinese chess].  Meanwhile the surgeon prepared his knife and called a lad to hold a basin beneath the limb.  ‘I am just going to cut; do not start,’ said Hua . . .   The surgeon then performed the operation as he had described. He found the bone much discoloured, he scraped it clean. ‘Hsi, hsi,’ went the knife over the surface, and all those covered their eyes and turned pale. But Kuan went on with his game, only drinking a cup of wine now and again, and his face betrayed no sign of pain. When the wound had been cleansed, sewn up and dressed, the patient stood up smiling and said, ‘This arm is now as good as it ever was; there is no pain. Indeed, Master Leech, you are a marvel.’  ‘I have spent my life in the art,’ said Hua, ‘but I have never seen such a patient as you, Sir. You are the real marvel.’  Here as surgeons, there physicians, leeches boast their skill;  Bitter few are those that cure one when one's really ill.  As for superhuman valour rivals Kuan had none,  So for holy touch in healing Hua T'o stood alone.  When the cure was well advanced, Kuan gave a fine banquet in honour of Hua and offered him a fee of a hundred taels [of gold]. But he declined it. He had come to treat his patient from admiration of his great virtue and not for money . . . Then Hua, having prepared dressings for the wound, took his leave, refusing fees to the very last.16"

They're voice matters more on the mainstream consensus. We always hear the view of the Asian woman. The more you understand Asian man how they view you as disposable utilities, the greater the chance for you to evolve.   Meanwhile in spite of how ""good"" men may have been, the amount of back breaking work they may have put into getting the world to where it is, all the billions of men who have died in name of a ""cause"" and how time and time again we have seen THE most selfless, THE most ""virtuous"" actions coming from the male sex, they are nothing more than a third rate citizen behind women and children. Men, they're definitely smarter at just about everything in the world, however they have one weakness and women are definitely worse at everything in the world, but they have one strength. The male's inability to control and tame his sex drive, coupled with the woman's ability to act Machiavellian while suppressing her natural urges is how the gold was plundered. Well NO more, men are waking up, they are going to take back their sovereignty and they will prevail because no more are we going to allow ourselves to be marginalized, no longer will we be minimized and no longer will we give into the toxic shaming of women and society as a whole.  Asian man understand you are playing a zero sum game pursuing Asian woman and attempting to integrate into western society.   Why are we more on average loyal to them than they are? Are we fucking stupid? There is a mental deficiency present in their minds that cannot stop an Asian man, from prostrating to their GOD the Asian woman. It could be a genetic component as to this day, I see people on this sub and in our real life time after time praising the Asian women like a deity. I despise on you older Asian fellas out there for trying to impose the myth of the ""special"" Asian women to younger guys like me out there that they exist.  You do not get the point. The problem with our evolution, is instead of trying to help persuade other Asian women to pity us. Leave them alone to their own vices and let them rot. Focus on the progression of yourself and if possible other Asian men if you choose to do so. We have to create our own distinctive culture in western society. More creation of Asian male safe spaces similar to this one to discuss knowledge. Stop arguing with them. I tell you if more Asian men went their own way on a noticeable than average trend, not wanting Asian woman, going for women of other races, and in general focusing on the acquisition of personal wealth. There will be a scarcity value imposed on us Asian men the more they see that Asian men do not desire them. Ironically it could make us more valuable to them but that is something you should not give to them.   How many years or centuries will it take for our men to figure this out? I really think you're an enabler of this simping disease for you're so called preference for an Asian woman. Trying to convince other men here that there are special ones in Asia.

To impose western culture on us and western narratives of Asians on us and have us accept it because 'we've always been a melting pot'. Meanwhile it's very well recorded in Chinese history and in many primary Chinese sources there is a coherent cultural structure of Chinese culture. That's why concepts like Sinicization even exists. There are many well recorded documents like Book of Rites which detail Chinese culture, native, Han Chinese culture. People should stop downplaying the importance of their own culture, Koreans seem to value their own culture very much and now are promoting their native culture through the media. Why are Han Chinese devaluing their own culture and forgetting their real culture. Then they turn around and compliment how great other people's cultures are and wish they had real culture like others.

And they let themselves be westernized by western media which this sub wishes to fight against.    I agree, this absolutely needs to stop.  I phrased my prior comment poorly. I was referring specifically to the blending and mutual recognition of Buddhist/Hindu/Han religious figures, similar to the Greek/Roman adoption of figures from the Egyptian Pantheon. This phenomenon is better than ""the melting pot,"" because all the figures involved can be considered native to their adopted cultures. Usually, a pre-existing historical/mythical Chinese figure is conflated with his foreign counterpart. This is the basis of Sinicization, where Buddha/Bodhisattvas basically become Chinese. Some figures, like Guan-Yin pusa are revered by both Buddhists, AND Taoists.  The cool thing is, South-east Asian cultures do the same thing with Buddhist figures that originated in China. This is part of why there are multiple types of Buddhism."

I loved the classics like the two I mentioned above, but it seems like our production is still stuck if not worse than decades ago. LMK when China makes a series as good as Game of Thrones."

But that aside, they can't get the production quality up? I honestly feel like the new stuff coming out has WORSE production than before because of how fake and weird it feels whereas in the 90's it at least looked authentic. case in point. The production just looks weird and this format is used for almost all shows in China. I don't know if it's because I'm just used to western movie production styles or this is genuinely just bad."

Asian dude's facial aesthetics is worth absolutely no weight outside of fobbiest of circles. They can't even tell you apart, you think your ""facial aesthetics"" is worth any value? Your entire value derived from other factors, your physical presence, your manner of speech and action, your social circle, etc. Looks like you don't have the other factors at all.   Do not go for that pretty boy look. A pretty boy with no circle gets absolutely no SMV out of his looks.   Stephanie is a fellow BBC though I thought maybe I would be safer with her and that maybe it'd be a good idea to pursue her   Mistake two. There is no fucking racial loyalty. Holy fuck. You probably have the least chance with her than anyone. Date any girls but her. Drop her NOW. It is only going to kill your spirit, self confidence and self esteem, and you are going to have to spend time later in your life fixing this trauma.   Am I really experiencing racism from a member of my own fucking race?!   Yes, exactly.   This whole situation is just making me furious. Why?   This is entirely normal. This is a great reaction. What I am afraid of is that you actually acted ""secure"" (i.e. a cuck bitch who has accepted it) and NOT get angry like a normal non-broken human being.  Now what do you do?  1) Cut off your ties from her and any association with her. Preferably make the cut off as ugly as possible. Make her know why exactly you did this. Make her know that you think she is trash. 2) Hit the gym. 3) Eat more. 4) Get educated on the issues. 5) Find proper friends who actually respect you.  Lift boy. You are still in your growth period. Begin NOW. Eat a shit fucking ton. Up your calorie count and grow heavier. Take more protein, drink protein shake every single fucking day. Did I say lift? You absolutely need this before your growth period stops."

I know exactly what will happen if I take her aside and put her in her fucking place: she'll outright despise me for seeing things as they are and daring to insult her when she's obviously so perfect, it will get out and people will think differently of me and maybe even be outright hostile towards me if they're dudes who want to fuck her.

What? Isn't cathartic something you want? Asian dudes need to stop thinking about consequences so much and just DO it. Release these emotions. Get pissed when you get pissed. Know what I am saying. This is the only way you will stop being apologetic and constantly not thinking about other's mental state more than yours. You will never get to the right mindset, by thinking like this.  This will be therapy for you. You will absolutely feel better. This emotional weight will be lifted from your chest. This is like confronting your childhood bully. If you have never done it, it will impact your whole life, forever be a psychological shadow.  You haven't internalized the fact that you are completely superior to her, and she is the one who should apologize to you. You are still scared of her. You see how ridiculous this is? She is absolutely shit. Picture her as a worthless piece of shit that you can knock out in one punch if it gets to it.  Unless you can internalize this mental model of her, knocking her to think of her image to someone inferior to you, you will never get out of your current state like this.  Do this so that there is no turning back. Maybe you are going to get hate, but now that you have the proper knowledge of what's what, the hate will make you stronger and work harder. You can handle it. Getting hate is only bad when you lack direction to move. Connect with anyone on this sub. Anyone will help you. PM me if you want to connect and talk more."

Because we all know and you know if you just ""sort of break it up nicely"" with her she's going to try to bite your dick off and you will end up being the guilty asshole. A person CAN break it off without causing drama but YOU can't. You will cave in and make her feel like she's done nothing wrong. And she will make others tease you for being weak.  If you just slap the shit out of her then people will GET IT. That you cannot be fucked around with. Because there is ALWAYS a reason for someone getting the shit slapped out of them. That is the reason why you have to be hard with this. This is exactly what she DOESN'T want to happen and thinks that you CAN'T DO. Which is why you must do it.

AsianMasculinity,3djzmu,ipiranga,2,Fri Jul 17 04:16:06 2015 UTC,"Question about lifting.  When do you know you're ""done"" with beginner level stuff like Starting Strength/Stronglifts? Like for a 6', 170 lb guy what weight...250+ squat/deadlift?   And how and what do you move on to?"
AsianMasculinity,3djzmu,ScepticalProphet,5,Fri Jul 17 00:38:33 2015 UTC,"Honestly, it depends on how you feel and your goal. If you want a rule of thumb, I’d change programs every 3 months or so, but when you’re first starting out you can change every 3-6 months, no biggie. Do you feel like you haven’t improved at all in the last month? Change it up. Do you feel bored with your workout and losing motivation? Change it up.  As for goals, what are you aiming for? Strength or size or both?   Strength – You can modify your SS/SL program. IIRC starting strength is 5x5. If you want to modify it basically you can do any amount of reps between 1-5 if you adjust the weights appropriately. For strength, I always increase weight and reduce reps as I go through my set, for example 10, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 reps for deadlifts, 10 reps being a warm up and increasing the weight each time until your last set is your “max”. In reality your 3rd set is probably your strongest lift (tradeoff between warming up your muscles and fatigue). A lot of people do the opposite (reduce weight as they get tired) but my broscience is that I conditioned my CNS to remain closer to maximal output throughout the set, which led to a lot more strength gains. It’s worked for me, may not work for you.  Size – You need to do more volume. Strength training focuses more on compound lifts but you need to throw in more isolation to build size. Generally 8-12 reps.  Both – You do a hybrid of the above training. PHAT is an example of a program that does this. Basically, you follow the strength principles (low rep high weight) for compound lifts and do hypertrophy principles for the isolation lifts (higher rep, lower weight).  Changing up your program can be as simple as switching out exercises for variations or changing reps/weights, or it can be as complicated as switching to an entirely new program. Change it up every 3-6 months, keep eating lots of protein, you’ll be fine.  Cheers for remembering me /u/proper_b_wayne"

AsianMasculinity,3djzmu,juanqunt,3,Fri Jul 17 00:52:28 2015 UTC,"Depends on your genetics, sleep, work ethics, etc. Generally, if you can hit 275-365x5 on deadlift, 225-315x5 on squats, 185-225x5 on bench, and you feel like progress is slowing down, switch to once a week progression. Don't worry about the specific numbers. Don't even worry about how much you weigh. Just look at the speed of your strength progress.   After that, you can do something like Texas Method or WS4SB for a while, then Sheiko or RTS. There's a lot of flexibility in what you could do depending on your schedule and goals. Strengtheory.com is a good website to read.  I would say focus more on food quality than quantity though. Eat until you're full, but focus on lean meats, fish, eggs, fruits, and veggies mostly."
AsianMasculinity,3djzmu,garlicextract,2,Fri Jul 17 05:36:46 2015 UTC,"I would appreciate any advice. I did SS and got my 'noob gains'. Only problem is, they barely got me to shit. Could be because of my size, 5'7"" 155lbs.  I can squat 185, bench 125 (wtf!), and deadlift 215. These are not 1RM, they are what I do sets with, so I could probably get an extra 10-20lbs on a 1RM. Still, these numbers seem pretty underwhelming compared to what I read about online. But either way I've felt the ""progress slowing down"" part and would appreciate advice.."
AsianMasculinity,3djzmu,juanqunt,2,Fri Jul 17 06:49:27 2015 UTC,"How much are you sleeping? Are you eating enough high quality meats and veggies? Are you lifting with the right form? Don't try to force add weight every workout. Focus on form and even leave 1-2 reps in the tank per set. Perhaps it's time to increase training volume/frequency or take a deload.   I would also cut out all dairy and get a blood test. Maybe you have thyroid or testosterone or other hormone issues, which you can fix through diet.  I know Asian guys your height and weight lifting twice as heavy as you. It's not that they are better, it's just that you probably have some training, lifestyle, or diet issues.  Need more details to know exact problem/solution. It's not about having a hardcore #beastmode #getshredded attitude. It's about finding the smart solution for your specific problems."

AsianMasculinity,3djzmu,proper_b_wayne,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:15:11 2015 UTC,"The thing is if your other signals, other than your face, absolutely sucks. For example, you got a bad haircut. You dress like a hobo. You got a pubic peach fuzz mustache. You are skinny as fuck. Those signals are absolutely going to dominate, especially in white people land. It doesn't matter at all, ""how your face looks"".   I have met way too many Asian dudes who stare at the mirror at their face and think that they are okay face-wise (they probably are), but they get absolutely no girls whatsoever. The thing is it is such a small portion of the signal compare to everything else for an Asian male. If you fall into the weak beta nerd stereotype, it pins you as a negative so strongly such that there is absolutely nothing about your face that can recovers your SMV. The weak beta nerd signal so strong that they don't even look at you in the face and care enough to judge.  Also, who are these white girls? They consume Asian media? How did you ask them? Asian pop stars or real Asian dudes around them?"

She's beautiful, she's ** smart** and seemed sweet and like a good person   No.  She is not.  This may seem harsh, but let me explain why.  She is a fellow BBC, and you felt comfortable around her because of shared background. This is not something she did to make you comfortable, this is just something that exists. Your brain recognises that a sweet person makes you feel comfortable, but it does not recognise that correlation =/= causation. You were comfortable because you let yourself be, not because she let you be. She did nothing. You hung around her and shared a background, and developed an idealised perception of her over time. There is literally nothing special about this---the only reason you developed feelings is because you didn't guard your heart like you do with girls and women of other backgrounds because of an assumption you made, you felt safer. You have admitted this in your own words. It's an illusion based on a narrow environment and repeated exposure to one girl. (500 Days of Summer, anyone?)   What did she do that is special that deserves your pining over her?  /u/AsianMascThrowaway nailed her immediately. Thus far, she is just a predictable 18 year old girl. A ""basic bitch"", if you will.  A ""special"" person to you is supposed to * interest you*. Objectively, she is bringing nothing to the table but existing---just like everyone else. So why does she deserve special attention?   Not only is she merely existing, but it appears she alternatively tolerated and rejected you. She never accepted you, which is what made you feel she was sweet.   No matter what way you spin it, she is going for a low blow. This is a case of blatant emasculation. She believes these things about you and other AM----hence why she is taking this path.  All this means is, like AsianMascThrowaway said, is she is easily influenced. She lacks critical thinking skills. She is merely going with the flow, wherever the mainstream takes her. Which goes back to my point in her simply existing, like a plant.   She is complacent. She is doing nothing. And yet your heart aches for her. You covet her, you pine after her---perhaps even grovel for her. A person of 7 billion, who simply happened to be of Chinese descent and lives around you.   Would you gave given this sort of leverage to someone who happened to be born of a different background? No. Because you were preemptively guarding yourself. But you let it down based on arbitrary factors such as proximity and shared heritage. Do you understand this?    She is brainwashed, and you have been mislead. You are in a time of your life as a human male where you, too, also feel like you are drifting. You look externally for an anchor. But Mario, your princess is in another castle (this one apparently has an Anna Lu).  Run away and don't look back. Improve yourself, focus on yourself and what is internal in your search. Do exactly what /u/proper_b_wayne . Read and learn, expand your mind. Start with /u/disciple888's posts, and follow him down the rabbit hole from there on.  Because you, as an individual, deserve better than this and you should know it.  You will not be beaten down like a grain. You are not a servant for anyone, you are a King of your own kingdom---yourself.   If you ever need help or need someone to talk to, just shoot a PM, okay?  And whatever you do, never operate on a mentality of scarcity. There's a whole world out there, you have time, you know."

It's that classic high-school movies scenerio, two former friends (A/B) go and socalize with X group, X groups accepts A but rejects B, A joins in taunting of B. In the movies, A usually starts feeling guilty and reforms but in real life it doesn't work that way. Any continued assoication with her is just gonna fuel more of her taunts at you.   I'd just try and make her feel as low as possible, she'll get defensive but it'll also resonate with her to some extent. Something like:  ""Hey, you're pretty pathetic. You've gained a little acceptance by these lot so now you think it's funny to make Asian jokes at me, you think if you keep joking about me they'd forget that you're Asian (of if you wanna go for shock value, chink) as well?

AsianMasculinity,3djzmu,ldw1988,2,Fri Jul 17 00:19:14 2015 UTC,"This is a super recent thing though. Up until recently she was a sort of shy, sweet girl and sort of hung around the ""outcast girls"" - the girl with the facial deformity, the 6ft obvious lesbian, etc. But since she started hanging out with different groups and going to parties and stuff she's changed.  Maybe this is the first step in becoming a slut? Idk."
AsianMasculinity,3djzmu,ldw1988,10,Fri Jul 17 00:22:24 2015 UTC,"She's  trying  to gain  white  acceptance.  That's  why  she's   shitting  on you, by  trying  to dissociate  herself  from  you.  Making  herself  ""cool"".    If she  started  going  to parties  and shit,  she wants  in to thr  white  high  status  social  circles.   While  your an asian  dude.  You know  what  that  means  in terms  of status."
AsianMasculinity,3djzmu,blue5un,10,Fri Jul 17 02:10:33 2015 UTC,"Alright, this is fun. I got here late so this is not going to be read but I'll still write this anyways. The typical Asian male highschool experience.    Another guy we hung out with was spending a lot of time together with Stephanie. He's white and used to be fat and sort of a dork but in the last few years, like me, sort of pulled himself together. I'd say he's a fairly ugly dude, still has pretty bad acne but he is pretty tall, probably like 6ft2.  This guy is really nothing special: sure, he's tall but like I said he's not much to look at, he's frankly stupid and is probably lucky not to have had to drop out because of grades (he had to resit a few exams) and he's pretty boring to talk to - all he seems to like is football. I may not be exactly a stud but how the fuck is this guy beating me? Am I really experiencing racism from a member of my own fucking race?!    Oh boy. First lesson of being an Asian male in the white man's world. It doesn't matter what the white man looks like, as long as he is tall (or even JUST white), a self hating Asian will prefer her to you.  Second lesson, there's no such thing as race loyalty, especially for women. Keep in mind that in another society, another system, you would be more attractive. But in the system you are in, white is attractive, Asian is not attractive by default. It doesn't matter, even if he's a fucking worthless drug addict, BY VIRTUE OF BEING BORN WHITE, he has more sexual market place value then you do. This is NOT YOUR FAULT, this is the society and system you live in. Obviously lift and improve yourself, but understand that it is not your own fault that you are losing to a worthless white dude whose only accomplishment is being born white. This is something we all have to learn at one point.   Usually it's sexual and about my penis, like everybody will be talking about sex and she'll be like ""you know I'd love to feel OP's fat Asian dick, I need it"" (clearly sarcastically, to laughs from everyone including Adam).   You are going to end up having to cut out everyone that laughs one way or another. If you have any self-respect, you would not associate yourself with anyone that would mock in to fit in with other people, or any ""friend"" that would laugh at you just because everyone else is. The world is big, university has many people. REMOVE ALL PEOPLE THAT UNDERMINES YOU IN ANY WAY FROM YOUR LIFE IMMEDIATELY (unless you need them for money).   She's clearly using me as a fucking prop to tease Adam and I'm sure at some point it's going to work and he'll fuck her and she'll get started on a long line of white men who'll use her before she gets with some poor Chinese guy who'll never make her happy because of her warped standards. Fuck.   Yes, and he'll probably fuck her too, and then throw her aside like the worthless self hating cum rag that she is. That is the nature of the society you live in.   Why the fuck would you care if she's happy though? I'm feeling sad for the fucking Asian dude that is forced to end up with that worthless sack of shit. Remember that women would rather be abused by the strong then comforted by the weak. In the society you live in, WHITE IS STRONG, ASIAN IS WEAK. Understand this.  My advice to you (worthless though it is):   Focus on your studies. No matter what happens, do not let this influence your future. Do all the lifting and self improvement mentioned here. Get rid of the people in your life that are undermining you (that stephanie, and any one of your friends that laugh at your expense, get rid of all of them. immediately) Not sure if this is legal, but save a couple of hundred bucks and fuck an escort (do some research on this first). This will stop you from getting thirsty. Sex is not fucking special. No woman is special (except your mother, you would love her because she's the only women in the world that will love you unconditionally).  Read history books. Since you are in the UK, read up on the opium war. Read about the British Raj, Hong Kong, etc. Realize that although you are born in the UK, white people will never TRULY accept you. You don't have to listen to me, just read history books and you'll see.  There's tons of research that gets posted here, do some readings. Disciple888 has posted tons of studies on this. Remember that everything you have been told by everyone you ""trust"" can be wrong. There's no such thing as race loyalty. No women besides your mother truly cares about you. Your white friends may not truly respect you (if they laugh at Asian dick jokes, try telling them that it's not funny, see how much they respect your opinion).   Anyways, you are young and have lots of suffering in front of you, but you should make it out okay. Enjoy the journey lolol."
AsianMasculinity,3djzmu,AsianMascThrowaway,8,Fri Jul 17 03:05:50 2015 UTC,"You're young so, start a sport that you practice at least twice a week so that you can be good at it by college and join the college team.

AsianMasculinity,3djzmu,AsianMascThrowaway,6,Fri Jul 17 00:12:51 2015 UTC,"Nope it's nothing about connection to culture at all. It's about mocking your own brothers so that you can gain favor with the white ""cool kids"". This is why her kind is not Asian in my eyes. And to be honest here, I don't know why you care about what she wouldn't like. Accept what she is and move on and away. So many great women out there."

You're there to provide favours, validation, and so that she can tell her friends how ""non racist"" she is (See? I have Asian friends, even though I'm taking white cock like a $5 thai hooker). You're to be used as required and don't even think about getting anywhere near her pants, you creep! YOu can't even really call her a friend - if she were truly a friend, she would not be bad mouthing you (unless you have dynamic where you can take the piss at one another in a friendly manner).   See how quickly she dropped her Asian values in favour of shit talking you to improve her standing as a member of the Caucasian circles?  So drop this trifling hoe and find better, truer companions."

OP needs to stop being a loser and get social value, be more funny. when other people make fun of him, he needs to see it as an opportunity to come back with something funnier and wittier. that is what generations attraction. The silver lining is that it seems that other are making fun of him, aka teasing him, more to test if he's socially competent or not. If he was a social outcast, people wouldn't even bother teasing him, he'd just be invisible.  the whole winning an argument to get her to like you? or winning an argument to convince them that society's value hierarchy is wrong... when she's fucking 16 years old... when she's completely surrounded by social conditioning... hahaha. no"

A fucking nothing piece of trash. If you step on a candy wrapper or beer bottle, do you feel bad? No, it's just a piece of trash, who gives a shit. That is how she views you.   Notice I didn't say she sees you as a dog, because people feel bad when they mistreat their dogs. I said actual garbage. I'm not saying any of this to rub salt in the wound and make you feel bad, OP. Read this carefully.  I don't care about all the nice, wonderful conversations where you got to ""truly know and understand her"". I don't care if you guys were up until 4am talking about the world and life and all kinds of wonderful shit. At best you are a set extra, background noise, an animated piece of furniture to her.  Tell me, out of all the dude friends you have EVER known in your life. Would any of their girlfriends, hell, just female friends, have belittled and slandered their dick size in public in front of your friends? You NEED to read this and all the other harsh truths to break out and get the fucking leash that she has on you off your neck. The point of this is not to ""get back"" at her and you get your revenge as if your life is a hollywood movie. The point is to see the truth and not go out of your way to kiss her feet when she has zero respect for you. Cut her out of your life.

I'm sorry buddy, but I don't think she came out of it well. I think she has some mental issues and has become a self-hating asian (not being mean. Kids are terrible and being the only east asian girl in any environment is going to end badly). Aside from the fact that she hasn't shown physical attraction to you like she has to Adam, she didn't have to PUT YOU DOWN to score extra points with Adam. That's a bitch move, and you have to let her go.  On white people: When you two were younger, these guys would say that you two would get married. Those thoughts have somewhat carried over into secondary school. They expect you to like her because she is east asian, and they expect you to like her even while she is sucking some white dude's dick. She probably thinks that you'll always be around. Don't be that guy. Don't let those whities laugh at your expense because of YOUR BEHAVIOR. Don't resume interest if she becomes available.    Physical side: You have some growth spurt left. Eat lots to get taller. On lifting, visit r/gainit.   Mental side: Aside from your studies, enlighten yourself. Read. Develop some interests that you care about.   Friends: You have the info in this subreddit. Not all white people are bad but you need to choose your friends carefully.   Lastly, this is gonna be a tough ride.

AsianMasculinity,3djzmu,Hope_of_Chinese_Dota,6,Fri Jul 17 02:18:57 2015 UTC,"I’m also British-born-Chinese (albeit a little bit older than you and someone who grew up in the pretty toxic environment of Northern England) and I came to the realisation that being a Chinese male is actually pretty damn hard.   But just because some people might view you as less of a man, does not mean you actually are less of a man. If you wanted to be viewed and judged to the same standard as boys like Adam then I suggest you take it up to your parents because they should have emigrated to a country where Chinese men are held up to a more equitable standard. The sad fact is that in England, people are going to attack, stereotype you, judge you, and romantically reject you because of your race. Whats worse, wider society won’t see this as a problem because Chinese men are widely seen as “legitimate targets”, and our stereotypes are believed to be “true.”  But who cares? Why should you care? Is that literally the best they can do? A girl can belittle you in a plethora of other ways. She can attack your personality, or your intelligence, or your athleticism. But instead she chooses to attack your race. Is that literally the best she can do? When someone attacks your race you should just laugh. Because that literally means they can’t think of anything better to attack you with. Anyone who relies upon false myths of “Asian guys are short” or “Asian guys have small penises” are just doing that - desperately relying on false stereotypes to belittle you with. And I would much rather be insulted through fake myths of my ethnicity rather than my genuine shortcomings.  Look, it’s hard being British-Born-Chinese and I think it’s really important to grapple with this reality so that you save yourself a lot of future confusion. I’ve had some very very successful and well-adjusted friends (Oxbridge-educated bankers/ lawyers/ government-type people) admit to me in private that they feel they aren’t held up to the same standard as White men (in the workplace or in the dating scene). So you’re obviously not alone. But just because ethnic minorities are viewed as such doesn’t make this treatment fair or justified. The very worse thing you can do is internalise these attacks. Just because Asian men can be viewed as lesser does not make it so. Obviously, it’s too late for girls like Stephanie. It’s sad that she has such a toxic and immature mentality towards her Chinese father, Chinese brothers, Chinese cousins, and Chinese friends and has internalised the rhetoric that it’s acceptable to bash Chinese men. Part of it is luck that she has not had to walk in our shoes. Another part of it is a natural consequence of a social environment where Asian girls benefit from positive stereotypes but Asian guys suffer from all the negative ones.  You have to remember that you can’t control what girls like Stephanie say or feel. The only thing you can control is you. One day, dumb kids like Adam are going to work for McDonalds whilst you’ll be living a much more successful life. One day, Stephanie might realise her mentality was absolutely toxic (and if she doesn't, she will when she becomes the mother of a half-Chinese son). But until then, the greatest revenge you can take against racist bullying is to move on and become successful in your own right. The greatest failure would be for you to internalise these messages and accept the false myths that being Asian is being lesser. Recently, one of my younger cousins confided in me something along the lines of, “I wish I was born White.” I don’t blame him for feeling this way - there’s only so much racial micro-aggression a British-Chinese male can take before he begins to doubt his own self-esteem and the self-worth of his Asian brothers. But it’s an absolutely tragic state of mind to deteriorate to - so I beg you to be proud of your race, and proud of your cultural heritage, and proud of the fact that no amount of racist mistreatment or belittlement will detract from your achievements, your self-worth, and your masculinity.  Lastly, it’s important to remember that you are not entitled to girls of your race. You are no more entitled to Stephanie than Adam is. If you want a girl’s affection, then you will have to earn it - race does not confer automatic right (though Whiteness is a definite advantage - especially if you want to date outside your race). There’s plenty you can work on so that you can attract your next crush (yes - because you will get over Stephanie). Be more proud of your race and your heritage. Learn Mandarin (or Cantonese as I suspect because you're from the UK) if you haven’t already. You should study or intern in China (or spend some time there). It’ll be a massive confidence booster for you because you’ll get to experience what its like to “live as the ethnic majority” or where “your ethnicity isn’t a disadvantage.” (Personally I spent some time in Hong Kong and actually came to the realisation that I’m actually considered a pretty decent looking guy. This was after spending the majority of my formative years as a bit of an ugly duckling. I don’t mean to brag - I just want to make the point that spending time in China will make you realise that a lot of your problems aren’t actually your own fault: you’re just treated badly in the West)."

AsianMasculinity,3djzmu,bleuskeye,1 point,Fri Jul 17 10:39:00 2015 UTC,"When you first introduced yourself as a BBC, I understood. The English lad culture can be cruel to East Asian guys but friendly to other minorities like niggaz and mulattas.  Hang in der, be skrong, and don do anyfin stupid. BBC girls are shitty like ABC girls."
AsianMasculinity,3djzmu,UncleChanAAACIdiots,2,Thu Jul 16 22:41:04 2015 UTC,"Yes, this is true. Sometimes I feel lucky as a BBC because we do get way less overt racism on the whole that South Asians and black people, I guess because there are less of us, but like you said the culture that a lot of young guys are a part of is just so unlikely to accept me that it's disheartening."
AsianMasculinity,3djzmu,bleuskeye,5,Thu Jul 16 23:52:19 2015 UTC,"This is more a relationship problem than a race problem, though there are some aspects of racism here.  You need to dump her. She doesn't value you as a person. You should find and keep people in your life that enhance you.  Your relationship with yourself is also questionable. You need to get right with yourself before you can be with anyone in any meaningful way. As shitty as it is to hear, to some extent, you've let this happen because you failed to engage in a relationship with yourself and love yourself. If you were your own son, how would you feel if someone talked to your kid like that? If it was your best friend? You'd stick up for them. You'd want to call them out. Yet you haven't stuck up for yourself. You've let yourself down, and you need to engage in some inner dialogue and learn to take care of your own personal sovereignty.   You can't control her. You can't control Adam. You can only control yourself and your reactions. You don't need anger, though it will be there. You don't need vengeance, though the temptation will be there. You need to take care of yourself better.   https://youtu.be/uTAxZPOtGKk"
AsianMasculinity,3djzmu,nanziqigai,4,Thu Jul 16 23:48:14 2015 UTC,"""This is more a relationship problem than a race problem, though there are some aspects of racism here.""  Did you read this part?   I've had a girlfriend (a white girl) before but it didn't work out and she all but said it was because of my race.   Yes? What about this.   Now, if all this wasn't bad enough, recently Stephanie has started belittling me when I'm around her and Adam - ostensibly as a ""joke"". Usually it's sexual and about my penis, like everybody will be talking about sex and she'll be like ""you know I'd love to feel OP's fat Asian dick, I need it"" (clearly sarcastically, to laughs from everyone including Adam).    THIS is grotesque racial cruelty. It's like she's sacrificing this guy at the altar of the Big White Boy. For all to see too. ""Some aspects of racism?"" C'mon, bleu. His story is marinated in racism."
AsianMasculinity,3djzmu,komei888,0,Fri Jul 17 00:40:28 2015 UTC,"I admitted there were aspects of racism, but honestly it sounds like OP needs to learn how to build better relationships. Based on the vague cherry picked racist examples, you can probably justify getting up in arms. But based on the way people act when you  a.) choose good people to surround yourself with,  and  b.) build strong, meaningful relationships with those people,  then I can safely say OP can benefit from developing the way he treats himself, other people, and his relationships to them.  This is /r/AsianMasculinity, but don't lose sight of the Masculinity for sake of the Asian.  Though to be completely fair, these are all kids and they are just playing at having relationships and whatnot. They are highly susceptible to media at this point."
AsianMasculinity,3djzmu,copacetickenny,3,Fri Jul 17 00:55:36 2015 UTC,"I admitted there were aspects of racism, but...   You said ""some"" aspects of racism. I am saying this guy is living in ""some"" British version of ""Auschwitz"" for Asians.    Based on the vague cherry picked racist examples, you can probably justify getting up in arms.   I didn't think it was vague. Cherry picked? You mean there's more I don't know about?  The couple of examples I read was enough for me. Your mileage may vary.   choose good people to surround yourself with,   Where did you get this gem? A fortune cookie?   then I can safely say OP can benefit from developing the way he treats himself, other people, and his relationships to them.   Query: What course of action did this ugly Englishman partake in to make ""Stephanie"" and girls like her become so smitten with him? In other words, what did he do right that OP didn't?  Bleu, I'm being a bit of prick right now. I'm sorry about that. But it looks like you're engaging in a sort of just world fallacy. Sure. This guy needs to learn some things. Work out. All that stuff. But most of all, he needs to get out of there.   Who said this: ""...when I went to college I was finally around Asians and man social life was way easier."" Yep. This is just as much a logistics issue as it is him ""getting right"" with himself."
AsianMasculinity,3djzmu,willymonfret,1 point,Fri Jul 17 01:48:22 2015 UTC,"Auschwitz for Asians! Lol. Dude is in high school and has trouble with girls. Pretty much every guy has been in his shoes.  For all you know with that white girl, there could have been serious culturally based miscommunications. I say this because most problems in relationships stem from communication issues. Why would she even enter into a relationship with someone she wasn't attracted or interested in? So she suddenly realized Asians are actually unattractive, and thus OP was dumped? This could have happened because they're children, but like I said, it's vague. OP never talked about his communication shortcomings. He never pursued or told us about that conversation other than her telling him, ""Yeah, it's cause you're Asian.""  Picking good people to surround yourself with. Yeah. Something wrong with this? You choose who is in your life and who isn't. You choose who you care about and who you don't. Choose wisely.  That dude is tall, he's flirtatious, playful, a jock, and not afraid of girls. She's a child who is just learning about herself as someone who wields social power based on her sexuality. OP is an 18 year old boy without any strong sense of self. Even if they were all the same race, you could see a similar thing play out. Race is a part of it, sure. There's more to just race here.  Explain where I said the world is just? As far as I can tell I'm helping a young man out who was in similar shoes as I once wore. You can cry all you want about being Asian, and yeah, race is a factor here as well. But he can't control that right now, and resentment and resignation to cynicism is about the last thing he needs. He needs to associate hard, worthwhile, meaningful self work with a more robust and meaningful social life. What are you suggesting, exactly? That he blame the race issue and never move on? To learn to associate factors he cannot change with rejection and failure? To learn to hate whitey and post on internet forums for the rest of his life while living a life half-lived?   As far as I am concerned, I am and have been advocating OP grow from this, rather than be focused on fixed outcomes. That is a key component to masculinity.   Here's another part of my story you didn't get: I left that area and with it, a whole slew of Asians. Social interaction was easy. Acceptance was easy. But I'd give it all up again for the meaningful relationships I have now with the people I do. Most are not Asian. They are above all, good people with whom I share strong bonds with."
AsianMasculinity,3djzmu,willymonfret,7,Fri Jul 17 02:13:24 2015 UTC,"Pretty much every guy has been in his shoes.   You mean having a girl of your own race viciously and racially demean you in front of white people for their entertainment? l have never been in THOSE shoes.   For all you know with that white girl, there could have been serious culturally based miscommunications. I say this because most problems in relationships stem from communication issues.    Culturally based miscommunications? Could have been. Or maybe it was his overbite. Who knows? OR it could have been that OP got the message loud and clear from that girl. It was his race.  Are you going keep insisting that ""there's more"" to this?   Why would she even enter into a relationship with someone she wasn't attracted or interested in? So she suddenly realized Asians are actually unattractive, and thus OP was dumped?   Who said she wasn't or isn't  attracted to him? But yes, he was he dumped. Why? Lack of social proof. Her parents. Think a long those lines.   That dude is tall, he's flirtatious, playful, a jock, and not afraid of girls.   I got the tall part. Where did you get the rest? Here's what I remember OP saying: ""This guy is really nothing special: sure, he's tall but like I said he's not much to look at, he's frankly stupid and is probably lucky not to have had to drop out because of grades (he had to resit a few exams) and he's pretty boring to talk to...""    Explain where I said the world is just?    No. I said just world fallacy.  It's a cognitive bias where you believe a person's circumstance is just/deserving because he/she is or must have done something. Like when you say:    ""As shitty as it is to hear, to some extent, you've let this happen because you failed to engage in a relationship with yourself and love yourself.   Yep. He had it coming, huh? Or it could be that he crossed paths with one of the myriads of self-hating Asian girls out there.   What are you suggesting, exactly? That he blame the race issue and never move on?    Never move on? No. The opposite. Move on. Get out of there."

What are the odds she will end up spreading more rumours since she has already sided with the whites. Hmmhmm  You are at an age where pretty much, focus on studying, lifting, get good and restart with liking someone worth liking, you are going to uni right? Well there's your chance, do not let this be a crutch in your life, these kids having a laugh now, later on in life they would realise his foolish they were when you a) graduate from uni b) get a better career. And if these fucks ask you for help on work etc. Fucking no is the simple answer, do not dwell over this moment, otherwise you miss out on other opportunities by being blinded by this wench, and these racist scum. You I hope are not the problem, do not falter, be proud of your race but firstly respect yourself, if say you had a close friend in the same situation. What advice would you give him?
