What they're talking about is purchasing a quantity of power from wind providers equal to their usage.  The grid and the market will actually sort out the rest.

Maybe I'm reading this wrong, but I'm not seeing the benefit.  The metal foam was tested with the same weight as standard shielding materials.  Wouldn't this just make it much larger?  If you're thinking of using this for radiation shielding for interplanetary spacecraft weight is the key.  If you have two things that weigh the same, but one had a larger volume, you're going to leave the larger one and use the compact option.  Now, if these materials could provide equal shielding per volume , we'd have something interesting."

Asphalt also takes rain away from the very surface of the asphalt and let's it dissapate through the grooves.

The cool thing, and even if they only ever took off as parking lot material, is that the honeycomb is open vertically, so that the soil or gravel underneath is exposed.

While it helped reduce the disposal of used tires, it recently has been recognized for its reduction of traffic noise."

What stands out to me is that it's hollow inside so running something like a fiber internet connection can be made much easier now instead of having to wait until other utilities need to make a change as well and then dig up the asphalt already laid. Since this is segmented, you can lift where it ends and continue to run anything you like within it and not damage the road. I think that's the biggest gain we can get from this.  Edit: Why am I getting downvoted? I'm just stating why it would be a good thing."
tech,3dwjr3,blulev,8,Mon Jul 20 07:41:29 2015 UTC,That's actually a very tiny and insignificant gain.
tech,3dwjr3,Airazz,2,Mon Jul 20 08:12:18 2015 UTC,Exactly. You have to close a road and literally uproot it in order to slide cables through it. Compared to just running them underground beside the road as needed.
tech,3dwjr3,DJ_MD9,5,Mon Jul 20 09:00:50 2015 UTC,"You're getting downvoted because honestly, it's a stupid reason. We have an insanely good and efficient system for fiber internet. That is, we dig a trench, put a cable in it and then cover it up with that same dirt. We don't even need to disassemble roads or hire cranes to lift blocks of that road up, to slide cables through it.   My house got connected a month ago, they didn't even dig trenches. They used these horizontal directional drills to put a pipe underground and then slide the cable through it. Just a small manhole is needed every few hundred feet."
tech,3dwjr3,Airazz,3,Mon Jul 20 09:25:19 2015 UTC,"I actually didn't know those drills existed, good to know. But isn't that drill and digging trenches only a plan on top of dirt? I live in Los Angeles and when you're talking downtown, it's just straight asphalt. On the sidewalks too. So when we want to move fiber internet or any other utility, we have to mine out the asphalt on the sidewalk or street to get into densely packed areas. Obviously, it would be tedious to have every utility like water, power, and sewage dig it out and relay it every time. So, for maintenance or what needs to be done, a date is set so all utilities do it on the same day. This can be frustrating for the person living in these areas as these dates can be weeks to months away. But, with these plastic roads the amount that needs to be piped or wired can just be lifted and reset within the same day. And that's a big improvement. What you said only applies to fiber internet albeit it was a valid dispute as that truly was efficient. But there are more utilities that need work on and they are also not only on grass or dirt."

tech,3dwjr3,expert02,0,Mon Jul 20 21:14:51 2015 UTC,Your points are actually counterproductive.  If you lift a damaged section out to replace you are lifting your fiber and other utilities which run through it.  If the road section is a 2 part road so you only lift off the top that's better but that's additional junction points all on the road. 176 degrees makes me wonder how it handles a road fire. Also if I have to lift every section in series to lay something that's terrible vs a bored conduit which runs manhole to manhole.
tech,3dwjr3,youonlylive2wice,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:39:26 2015 UTC,It sounds like 176 is the operating range for temperature. The road by my house has a steep hill that can't always be used in the summer afternoon because the tar softens to the point the vehicles slide back down leaving a trail of semimelted asphalt behind it. Fires already do some nasty damage to the existing roads so honestly I'm not too worried about it. I think having a road that can have the very top panel swapped out in under an hour would be an awesome improvement. One way to improve the carry capacity would be to just fill it with concrete or water or something once on site - similar to how they do the temporary barriers.

Unless another material can be found that does both of those better than asphalt, it is staying this way.   Another:   Asphalt is used because it is cheap, 100% recyclable and fairly durable (if done correctly). I doubt this road could withstand a highway sized load of vehicles, or trucks in an industrial area.   And another:   Sounds great as an idea but: flammability?

And an idea for whether or not people are carefully considering their response. And that can be indicators. But neither of those are sufficient to do much better than chance at identifying lies without spending time first learning a persons usual behaviour to contrast against - you need to look for changed behaviour rather than specific expressions etc.  Once you do know someones typical behaviour you can certainly do better than chance, though people tend to assume they are much better at telling when someone is lying than they actually are.  I don't doubt that we can get computer-assisted hints about body-language - there are certainly all kinds of hints most people never notice.

He basically created the idea of a computer that could compute anything, made entirely out of gears and similar assemblies. The problem was, he didn't get a lot of grant money, and unwisely spent what he did get, so he never finished it.   But he had the blueprints for a fully working computer in 1880. Then it was shelved and partially forgotten for nearly 70 years."

tech,3dsxi3,Metlman13,16,Sun Jul 19 08:32:00 2015 UTC,"You want to know something? One of the first U.S. Computers, the Harvard II I believe, was used for simulations of the best designs of an atomic bomb for the Manhattan Project. Specifically testing gun-type versus implosion-type warheads.   But there would have been many peacetime improvements as well. The original purpose of the Difference Engine (his first, also incomplete machine) was to calculate logbooks. I'm not talking about diaries, but books filled with values for the logarithm function, the sine function, et cetera. These were used for engineering in the day, but were extremely error-prone (average of 7 errors per page), because they were calculated and copied down by humans. He hoped to be able to create perfect logbooks, going so far as to integrate a printing press into the design to remove errors from manually copying down values.   So think of the bridges and buildings that would have been better built, as well."

Of course, the computers would be mostly bound to offices, businesses and government agencies, but the impact they would have would be pretty far reaching. The Analytical Engine would just be a starting point, from there more and more complex mechanical computers based off Babbage's design would be created for more and more computational purposes.   Its actually kind of amusing to think of a society that is dependent on computers while still using oil lamps for light and horses for travel (although trains were well established, but they were more for distances that would take days by horseback)."

They take effectively no risk as long as they ship something close to what they advertised as they mainly risked your money.  It's not how products should be made or how businesses should be based. If you have a product and want it realized, Make it, and sell it, And if you're not confident enough in the products ability to recoup your costs, than you're probably not confident enough in the product for it to be worth it.  Yeah, it's a hardlined opinion, but mostly accurate.   Obviously that doesn't apply to simple widget type kickstarters. like a card game, or dice or something small and near impossible to fuck up."

Invest is a verb that means ""expend money with the expectation of achieving a profit or material result by putting it into financial schemes, shares, or property, or by using it to develop a commercial venture.""  So if you give money to a kickstarter, which is a commercial venture, and you expect to get a material result, how is that not investing?"
tech,3dqkhy,CptOblivion,3,Sun Jul 19 02:32:09 2015 UTC,"An investment is an effort to return a gain on your investment. buying a product is not an investment unless you can make profit from it.   For example, A house is an investment as the value of real-estate raises over time (Traditionally). So you can sell that house and make a profit in the future. That's an investment.  A purchase that is not an investment would be a car for example. You won't be re-selling that car later for a profit, as cars lose value once purchased. Hence why cars aren't an investment.  That's why this kickstarter isn't an investment, it's a purchase."
tech,3dqkhy,FourForty,-2,Sun Jul 19 02:43:58 2015 UTC,"You're ignoring half of the definition to suit your argument. Sure, an investment is typically for monetary return, but the difference between an investment and a purchase is you put the money in ahead of time, on speculation, rather than when you are buying the goods. Whether you're hoping to get money or goods back out doesn't factor in to whether it's an investment or not."

It's not investing just as giving $200 to amazon.com and getting a Chromebook is not investing. It's participating in a marketplace.  Matter of fact, when that kickstarter product gets made (if that ever happens) and gets to be sold in normal retail channel, you can buy said product for a given amount of money.

Hmm. But what if your product idea happens to be for something even more expensive than that; even more than a few friends can pool their money to afford? I guess we need a system where even larger numbers of people can pool their money together to fund an idea for a product they all want. How could we do that?"

(After spending 36 hours in airports and airplanes recently, the current Air was by far the most common laptop.)  The original Air sucked. It was underpowered, had a puny, slow mechanical hard drive, not enough ports, etc.. All it had going for it was the wow factor when Jobs pulled it out of an envelope. But the second generation came out and...well, it's arguably the most popular model of laptop out there right now. They added a better processor, snappy and more compact flash memory and all around fixed the biggest criticisms. It's still underpowered for a lot of things (I wouldn't game on it like I do my MacBook Pro, and some of the development work I do would be impractical at best), but for the majority of users, it's a really nice laptop.  I predict that Apple will make major improvements in round two of the new MacBook, and it will replace the Air eventually. However...that Core M is majorly kneecapping it, all for a fanless design, and CPU tech will have to come a long way to make that practical. And it will still only be practical for general purpose computing, due to the thermal concerns and the compromises to hardware that the fanless design necessitates."

tech,3djcgt,hardgeeklife,2,Fri Jul 17 01:32:57 2015 UTC,"The reason Google started recommending removing SD cards from phones is because of the problems created with separate drives for storage.  It was causing confusion for users because of how things need to be stored.  It was originally intended not to be necessarily swap out media, but rather a choice for the user for how much storage the user wanted.  For example, if you're using the SD card as swap out media, then apps themselves and their data must be stored on primary storage because if you remove the SD card and an app (or its data) is located on the SD card, it's hard to create a functioning phone.  Android allowed users to move apps to the SD card, which really fucked with users that didn't understand what they were doing.  That was a mistake.  An SD card would have worked fine if -- and only if -- you could only use it to store media (music, video, etc).  That's the only thing it is useful for."

tech,3djcgt,rakig,0,Thu Jul 16 23:47:08 2015 UTC,One would hope it uses wpa2 which is completely secure so long as you use a decent passphrase.
tech,3djcgt,kryptobs2000,4,Fri Jul 17 00:07:22 2015 UTC,"http://www.aircrack-ng.org/doku.php?id=cracking_wpa  It's not easy and takes time, but WPA2 can be cracked"
tech,3djcgt,wolfcry0,10,Fri Jul 17 01:38:53 2015 UTC,"There is another important difference between cracking WPA/WPA2 and WEP. This is the approach used to crack the WPA/WPA2 pre-shared key. Unlike WEP, where statistical methods can be used to speed up the cracking process, only plain brute force techniques can be used against WPA/WPA2. That is, because the key is not static, so collecting IVs like when cracking WEP encryption, does not speed up the attack. The only thing that does give the information to start an attack is the handshake between client and AP. Handshaking is done when the client connects to the network. Although not absolutely true, for the purposes of this tutorial, consider it true. Since the pre-shared key can be from 8 to 63 characters in length, it effectively becomes impossible to crack the pre-shared key.  The only time you can crack the pre-shared key is if it is a dictionary word or relatively short in length. Conversely, if you want to have an unbreakable wireless network at home, use WPA/WPA2 and a 63 character password composed of random characters including special symbols.  The impact of having to use a brute force approach is substantial. Because it is very compute intensive, a computer can only test 50 to 300 possible keys per second depending on the computer CPU. It can take hours, if not days, to crunch through a large dictionary. If you are thinking about generating your own password list to cover all the permutations and combinations of characters and special symbols, check out this brute force time calculator first. You will be very surprised at how much time is required. [to brute force a pre-shared key]  *IMPORTANT This means that the passphrase must be contained in the dictionary you are using to break WPA/WPA2. If it is not in the dictionary then aircrack-ng will be unable to determine the key. *"

tech,3djcgt,kryptobs2000,2,Fri Jul 17 02:28:10 2015 UTC,"Yeah that's what my thought was, a lot of devices that broadcast a wifi network come with a really basic key so it's easy for people to connect  I'm sure they'll let you change it one you connect to it the first time, but I'd bet that most people wouldn't bother or know how"
tech,3djcgt,wolfcry0,3,Fri Jul 17 02:32:28 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I consider that a big security flaw, they should just be off by default or make you change it or else block any traffic (in the case of a router).

tech,3djn53,serjlee,0,Fri Jul 17 10:55:29 2015 UTC,The Intel CPU is probably because AMD's GPU drivers are single-threaded and can sometimes be a bottleneck since single-threaded CPU performance isn't AMD's forte.

It's akin to sports cars.  Nvidia delivers a modern sports car while AMD delivers a 60s hot rod.  Performance is very similar, AMD's a little cheaper but AMD's tech runs hotter, their tech is a little less refined, they consume more power and I'm going to say it, their drivers are still to this fucking day are unstable.

Immediately started to get BSODs and I mean the second the driver was installed.  Rolled back the driver, it didn't fix the problem.  Apparently it was a known issue with a lot of other users complaining.  Got a hot fix driver about a week later and my system would still sporadically blue screen.  Ironically, AMD spokeperson comes onto PCPer as a guest that very week touting how their drivers are not a problem anymore.  Look, I want AMD to succeed.  I backed it up by purchasing their card but their driver tanked my system.  It was a relatively new install so I just formatted the drive, got a GTX 970, and to this day, rock solid stable.  Not a single issue or hiccup.  Not one.  Also temps waaaaaaaaay lower as reported by Open Hardware Monitor and Speccy.  Until AMD gets their shit together, I'm not supporting them."

That means that less than 37,000 new cars were sold in Norway that year, compared to 15.6 million in the US in 2013. While great for Norway, globally it's not much for EVs.  Norway's regulatory system is unique, and offers massive incentives - EVs are exempt from road tax, congestion charge, tolls, and even sales tax. This isn't a win on equal footing, and can't be replicated everywhere. Even there, some of the incentives are being re-evaluated, and may be phased out.

We can throw out a lot of the legacy stuff with its bugs and inefficiencies, and better accommodate modern hardware like smartphones and tablets. The trade-off is just that the size and therefore the attack surface of browsers has had to get bigger so that we can eventually get rid of Flash."
tech,3dgx6z,trevaaar,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:07:08 2015 UTC,"I've been a proponent, for a long time now, of the next 'web'. Something other than HTTP and HTML.  The browser, like you said, has become bigger to accommodate more and more, and a lot of it is stuff that was never even a glimmer in the eye of the original developers of Mosaic.  The feature creep and bloating has lead to a lot of inefficiencies and security holes.  It's past time to redesign the 'web' browser from the ground up."
tech,3dgx6z,cpbills,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:32:35 2015 UTC,"For a while now i've thought it could be interesting if we moved to a 'next web' which is completely server side (a cloud based web), where the client's browser merely sends input to the server, and the server handles all the rendering logic (and ofc backend logic), returning the prerendered image/audio to the browser (via either a stream or static connection). So rather than your browser recieving an HTML that it then has to interpret, it just recieves an image to display."
tech,3dgx6z,AtomKick,4,Thu Jul 16 16:40:37 2015 UTC,the server handles all the rendering logic   That will never happen. Companies do not want to spend resources rendering things for you; that will almost certainly always be client-side. That's why javascript has been so bloody popular; it offloads a LOT of work to your system.

Once the details were made public, it left anyone using Flash open to cyberattacks.   This seems to get the blame completely wrong, on two counts. Hacking Team didn't leak the documents; others hacked them and released the documents without Hacking Team's permission.  Moreover, users of Flash have been vulnerable to cyberattacks since long before this leak happened. Hacking Team and their customers (government agencies around the world) have been using this exploit since it was created. But now, thanks to this leak, we should have a fix soon that prevents this particular security flaw—and we should also move faster towards stopping using Flash altogether."

There are methods to patch software that do not actually require a download or change to the client software as long as they have Internet (or some other connection) from which to get that information.  They are like soft-patches. If you were offline, then it is likely that this change would not take effect or even revert. It pulls this information everytime the software starts and applies it in a non-permanent way.  Another example of this is Borderlands 2. They can rebalance a fair chunk of the game as well as change loot drops and their chances of dropping without any download. It's just changing numbers so it looks these numbers up from an online source instead of locally."

So you think someone gave it to them for below book value? wtf.   No, I think these people came to to hotel and sold them on the idea. The idea may cost 1000% of what it would cost for the hotel to contract out the creation of an app, it's probably very expensive, but the difference is that this product already exists and the hotel owners liked it. Not every decision is purely financial. I see how you could interpret that as implying it's cheaper simply because it exists or something, but that wasn't my point.    but you also have to consider that there would be more infrastructure involved than just the development of two apps   Such as?   This one is mostly cost related, but also time and... skill/knowledge maybe? At the very least they would need a server and the server side software which about doubles the programming work, still much cheaper though. They also need some sort of kiosk system for people w/o phones and since they probably only know about running a hotel in addition to hiring the developers and designers they'll probably want to hire an outside consultant to oversee and coordinate everything, one would assume they have money to spend and would want to do it well if they can afford these robots after all.

It seemed interesting and the scientists were very excited by the possibilities it presented but it was all very abstract and didn't really seem like it would affect me.  Fast forward 25 years. Carbon nanotubes (edit: and graphene!), the direct research descendants of buckyballs, are being mass produced and are on the verge of enabling huge improvements in many of our current technologies - as well as opening new avenues to techs we don't even have yet.

The same goes for nanotubes, bulk CNTs are already being used as a polymer component and as a component in AFM probes. They are used in certain high technology alloys.

tech,3d4xbz,kryptobs2000,4,Mon Jul 13 22:20:28 2015 UTC,"I can see you're one of those people that keep arguing regardless of facts. Size is relative. Compared to the the amount of air being pushed through it, yes, it's definitely small, if it weren't it wouldn't lift you off of the ground now would it? Do you consider the opening of a jet airliners turbine to be 'not small' because you realize it's dramatically bigger than this right?"
tech,3d4xbz,Flight714,7,Mon Jul 13 22:33:10 2015 UTC,"Size is relative.   The thrust duct size is considered in relation to the size of its intake, not in relation to the size of other jet engines."
tech,3d4xbz,kryptobs2000,1 point,Mon Jul 13 23:27:53 2015 UTC,"According to what definition? Everything I read just says you need to push a lot of a substance, 'usually a gas or liquid', through a small opening. The wikipedia on jet propulsion the guy linked above, while I only skimmed it, did not seem to really say anything beyond that (though of course gave more details)."
tech,3d4xbz,rspeed,4,Tue Jul 14 01:24:30 2015 UTC,"Size is relative   Yes, relative to the size of the air inlet. They're the same. A ducted fan produces thrust the same way as a helicopter – by moving a large volume of air at a low speed. A jet produces thrust by moving a small volume of air at a high speed, and it does that using a nozzle.   Do you consider the opening of a jet airliners turbine to be 'not small' because you realize it's dramatically bigger than this right?   That's a great example of why you're wrong. The majority of the thrust produced by a modern airliner's engines doesn't come from a jet. Hence why they're called high-bypass turbofans, not turbojets. They're essentially a large ducted fan surrounding a turbojet."
tech,3d4xbz,kryptobs2000,2,Mon Jul 13 23:10:26 2015 UTC,"Maybe you're right, you sound like you know what you're talking about, but do you have a link to back that up? The wikipedia on jet propulsion and basic definitions of a 'jet' do not seem to put further stipulations on it than what we said."
tech,3d4xbz,rspeed,2,Tue Jul 14 01:31:11 2015 UTC,"The source you've already given disputes your claim. The whole reason it's vague is because the terms are describing the output in relation to the input. So, for example, the air exiting a turbojet engine is traveling (much) faster and through a smaller aperture than the air entering the engine – due to the fact that it has been heated significantly before being squeezed through a nozzle. The air coming out of a ducted fan hasn't been heated, accelerated, nor squeezed. It's a moving column of air, but not a jet."

Specifically - refrigerated shelving is a great idea, and if it is as cheap as they claim, should enjoy some level of adoption. A fridge will still be required, but perhaps a smaller fridge that can live out of the way, rather than a large fridge that is the centerpoint of the whole kitchen.

The partial pressure of the water vapor at this point is so low that you can allow it to pass through the heat exchanger and it does not freeze.”   So eventually the water is allowed to pass through the pre-cooler."
tech,3cwjzv,MassiveResponse,1 point,Sat Jul 11 18:08:28 2015 UTC,"That's the part I don't understand. Do they allow ALL of the vapour through eventually? Then they still need a distillation step. If they only allow some of the vapour through, the system eventually fills up.  There are obviously some details they are keeping secret, but I'd love to know."
tech,3cwjzv,LimEJET,1 point,Sat Jul 11 18:37:13 2015 UTC,"Sounds like the pre-cooler itself can handle both water/methanol mix and supercooled dry air.  The issue is getting the supercool air dry enough that the intake itself doesn't freeze solid.  If the channels are small enough, the methanol being consumed is likely not very much.  Plus in the long term, the more usages we find for methanol the better since we can make methanol with excess solar energy from CO2 in the atmosphere as a storage method.  Having a whole new industry to sell large quantities of methanol to would be a big step towards making that economical."
tech,3cwjzv,Shandlar,11,Sun Jul 12 03:33:08 2015 UTC,"It seems like a possible clear winner if so. My gut instinct is that the fine mesh of ducting they're mentioning will be incredibly complicated and difficult to maintain.  That aside, I'm not sure the aviation industry as a whole would adopt it quickly as they're driven primarily by price - but, if the cost of the engine is reasonable offset by low H2 production costs, it might make a more compelling case as hydrocarbons in general get more expensive.    If this does work for making legit space planes, however, that gets more exciting.  Using your jet engine and aerodynamic lift to get you near the edge of the atmosphere and then going a rocket burn from a running head start, miles up, and with less friction with all reusable components seems like it would dramatically slash costs to orbit."

tech,3cwjzv,ctesibius,2,Sat Jul 11 19:59:49 2015 UTC,"Passenger flights essentially can't break the sound barrier over populated areas. Being hypersonic in the atmosphere is also fuel inefficient due to friction with the atmosphere. Ballistic trajectories don't make sense for short or medium distance flights and you still have the sonic boom issue during launch. Which sort of defeats the need for a hypersonic engine of any kind for a lot of passenger flights. Cost probably kills it for the rest although people would argue on that I'm sure.  If you just want a hydrogen powered jet plane, that's been done already. It's just sort of pointless.

Until we can figure out portable high-output nuclear reactors or just use Nuclear Propulsion, staged rockets are way more efficient both cost wise and design-wise. SABRE engines - especially oxygen combusting ones - are viable, but still too far from the ideal SSTO dealmaker."

Even in the of a relatively contained disaster, I can barely imagine the outraged masses forcing the shutdown of massive nuclear propulsion programs.

The energy will have to come from somewhere to extract it - hopefully renewable, but it will basically be coming from the electric grid.  If that electricity comes from renewable sources, then you'd definitely see a massive reduction in carbon emissions.  Otherwise, you're just swapping the energy coming from hydrocarbons on board a plane for energy coming from hydrocarbons in a power station (then being turned into electricity, then being used to extract hydrogen and oxygen from water, liquified and put on board your passenger plane)"

The soviets converted a plane in the late 80s and flew something like a 100 flights.  Problem is that hydrogen requires cryogenic storage, is still four times less energy per volume than jet fuel, and is hard to handle (volatile, leaks through everything, etc). On top of that you still need to generate the hydrogen be using energy. So there's just no real advantages for airlines.

They lost the argument and DB could run its test trains.  The same thing happened when Eurostar (the main train operator for Channel Tunnel services) decided to buy Siemens' trains (German built) over Alstom (the French company).

I would love to be able to hear everything at normal volume, but if it was so loud that it would damage my hearing, it wouldn't play it as loudly. This would be effective up to a certain volume level. Earbuds and ear plugs can block up to -33 db or so.  You could also limit the volume of annoying sounds, and also increase the volume of quiet important ones. There are all sorts of possibilities. I don't think that we quite have compact enough processing power for some of those abilities yet but I think we will within the next few years or so."

My understanding (from talking to my grandfather) is that a big part of his problem with hearing aids is that there is no threshhold filter for noise.  If he's at a dinner party, all the quiet murmering get's amped up, and all he can hear is everybody talking. Maybe he just has shitty hearing aids... But if there as an adjustable dB threshold filter that he could tweak and until he could clearly hear the people talking at 5 feet and completely not hear the people talking at 7-10', I think that'd be pretty powerful.  Right now he just has to turn the volume up or down looking for a spot that 'mostly' works."

tech,3co0mm,shaneration,3,Thu Jul 9 15:38:34 2015 UTC,"Because this isn't for hearing loss.  I require a high powered (65db) receiver in order to achieve ""normal"" hearing.  You aren't getting that with this product.  It's a step forward, and should be where hearing aid technology goes, ABSOLUTELY!  But, sadly, it probably won't since if I have full control over my aids, I'm cutting out the middleman that is my audiologist, which would fuck the entire industry.    Audiologists are a hassle and every single little thing I need to go in for (she set the volume too high last visit, need it tuned again) costs money.  Some are good, and went into the industry to help people, but most are car salesman and simply do it because of the ridiculously high mark up on hearing aids.  They just try to stuff the latest tech down your throat for the highest price, and have zero accountibility when it comes to follow up, or how to even use the technology.  They're constantly calling the manufacturer or the reps to come in and ""fix"" the problems that arise for poor fittings, bad tunings, and just a general lack of product knowledge.  It's a shame I have to have a middleman and can't go straight to the manufacturer.      If I could have full control over the functionality of my aids, I'd be in fucking hearing heaven.  I'm not some 80 year old that needs something cheap so he can hear the Price is Right.  I'm an active Masters student with a full time career, and a life outside work and school.  I need the same functionality that people expect from their cell phones, their tablets, and their laptops.    This is a great product, and I encourage everyone to get it (imagine how less noticeable a hearing aid would be if everyone wore a pair of these), it's just not a ""hearing aid"" in the traditional sense."

I'm still relatively young and tech savvy and to have to go to an expert to tune my hearing aids to work the way I want them to seems ridiculous. To have to pay for each additional tweak is a freaking sham.  That being said, having some limited ability to tune different programs in the field is a great help.

We are quickly approaching theoretical limits in feature size, due to quantum tunneling effects (the barriers are so small that an electron on one side has a significant chance to just show up on the other side.)  What could solve this is making chips out of completely new materials, which would require scrapting everything we know about manufacturing and starting over, AFTER we find the miracle material. As far as I can tell it won't be cost effective for commercial production for minimally 3-8 years after these materials are developed, if ever.   The chips we can make now already work pretty damn well, and there's a huge capitol investment to redoing manufacturing processes from scrap that will be difficult to justify from a budgetary view."

tech,3cnxsj,Heatranoveryou,8,Thu Jul 9 11:30:51 2015 UTC,"wtf, PowerPC is made by IBM?   Well, Motorola was involved too for a while, they were supposed to be the volume manufacturer and allow IBM to focus on the R&D side. But Motorola spun off its fabs a decade ago now, and Apple is gone too.  IBM developed and manufactured the CPUs for the Wii, Xbox 360 and PS3, but AMD/TSMC dominates the current generation and are making the APUs for the Xbox One and PS4 (IBM did still get the Wii U though). It's a weird situation considering TSMC is lagging  behind on the process nodes (volume production still stuck at 28nm while Intel's been on 14nm for a while), but obviously AMDs superior GPU tech and APU integration won the day.  In addition, IBMs cutting-edge R&D is impressive, but their volume production is not nearly as advanced. The Wii U's CPU is 45nm, which was pretty old-school when it launched in 2012 (Intel switched from 32nm to 22nm on its high-performance CPUs in 2012, while AMDs CPUs and APUs have been on 32/28nm from 2011 to today). IBM did go 22nm in 2013/14 with the Power8 architecture, but that's still behind Intel."

tech,3cnxsj,CrateDane,4,Thu Jul 9 14:33:51 2015 UTC,Intel is already at 14nm and should have 10nm soon. Neither GlobalFoundries nor TSMC is competitive at the moment. It takes quite a bit of imagination to believe they'll come from so far behind to beat Intel in getting 7nm chips into mass production. More likely it's just showboating.
tech,3cnxsj,therealscholia,1 point,Thu Jul 9 21:59:05 2015 UTC,Intel created a new CPU to be the middle ground between 14 and 10 nm because they can't create 10 nm in time. 10 nm is still a ways away.  Samsung is on 14 nm so it's not like intel is the only fab running it.  Seems like TSMC will get 16 nm before Intel gets 10 nm.  Same goes for GloFo and their 14 nm.

tech,3cke8o,Mnementh2230,38,Wed Jul 8 19:07:22 2015 UTC,"/u/koolaidman04 has it pretty much down.   The problem that your aviation head might be thinking about is ""whu-wha power turbines what"" - basically, think of the ""decelerator"" bit in the parent post as the free/power turbine in a turboshaft, extracting power from the exhaust flow and turning it into rotary kinetic energy to strap to anything that takes an input shaft. Obviously, the natural way to do this would probably be to build a similar sort of thing in: stick a free turbine in the exhaust flow, etc etc.  The problem is that turbines in general only work well in continuous power modes - cyclic variations in the inlet pressure, power handled, etc tend to create unpleasant resonances since the turbine will be accelerating and decelerating constantly to try to handle the varying conditions (and reach equilibrium with them). This design is pretty much as periodic as you can get: short, powerful explosions followed by periods of no power input, repeated. Hence, designing a system to take the power out of the flowing stream of very hot, very pulse-y gas is extremely difficult, since pretty much the only tool we have in our bag for that is a free turbine type design. But to do that is a fool's errand - it would be easier to not bother with the pulsating jet of hot gas at all, and just take the energy out as heat one stage earlier using conventional heat exchangers. This engine actually does that, to run the lasers for selfsustaining combustion."

For laser ignition, that may be the only practical way to do it since it is less a controlled nuclear reaction and more a tiny nuclear explosion.  Upside is that you could reuse alot of plant knowhow from natural gas plants, since they are basically stationary jet engines as well.  Edit: damnit Jim, I am an Engineer, not an English Major!"
tech,3cke8o,gravshift,11,Wed Jul 8 19:07:50 2015 UTC,"If the pulses happen fast enough, for all intensive[sic] purposes it is continuous.   Really, really not true. Specifically, if the transmission medium has a high speed of sound (hydrogen and helium, the exhaust product of this engine, do) then each individual shockwave will retain an identity of its' own for a considerable distance, as they will require space to decelerate to the local speed of sound and bunch together.  They will still, furthermore, have some fluctuation in power output over time, since perfect uniformity requires the space and time to make the exhaust flow isentropic. This will probably not be forthcoming in what will be a near-hard vacuum punctuated by nuclear explosions. Of course, if one has enough space to get a truly isentropic exhaust, then you're better off using the heat from it to just warm something up than trying to extract the kinetic energy directly, unless you are specifically after a reaction engine (which is why this technology is possibly viable and interesting as a jet engine - it's a novel application of a proven-but-uneconomic design when used as a heat engine)  The pulsed power delivery will create appreciable resonances in the exhaust flow, which at best will require careful design to smooth the power delivery out by blurring each shock together, and at worst will make power turbine design impossible because of the vibrations imparted by the non-uniformity in the exhaust.    Upside is that you could reuse alot of plant knowhow from natural gas plants, since they are basically stationary jet engines as well.   This is a pretty gross oversimplification, since a natural gas powered generator operates in the thousand degree/tens of atmosphere range, with (actual) continuous combustion; a hypothetical turbine for this application would likely have to deal with semi-pulsed, hundred-plus atmosphere pressure ratios, at temperatures closer to ten thousand degrees (but again, pulsed). The technologies are similar in the way that a desk fan and a wind turbine are - lots of similar principles at play, but with implementation differences which are enough to build careers on."
tech,3cke8o,hexapodium,6,Wed Jul 8 19:31:14 2015 UTC,I stand corrected.   So the only real way to extract power in a nondestructive way would be a traditional cooling loop and turbine setup unless you are fine with a rocket engine setup.  Would a heat exchanger even be able to take this?
tech,3cke8o,gravshift,4,Wed Jul 8 19:43:31 2015 UTC,"Pretty much. If you don't need the power as a jet/rocket exhaust, it's significantly easier to get it as heat from the start, because we don't have many options for turning pulsed jet exhaust into other forms of energy.   Heat exchangers: I'd say ""yes probably, but"". The ""but"" here is about temperature, reactor size, and plant size. For low power, the size of the reactor will be quite small and thus we can just surround the whole thing with a cooling jacket; in fact, a lot of the problem with current small scale experimental fusion is keeping the reactants hot enough, as the chamber walls are enough of a (thermal mass) heatsink to cool it down and quench fusion; hence magnetic bottle containments and other things beyond the scope of the answer.  For larger, hypothetical installations which might produce usable power, you have the bigger problem that fusion delivers all its' power in one point source, rather than fission where an operating pile might be a few cubic metres with lots of internal voids. Cooling this is naturally more difficult - you have to get very high thermal flux densities (power per unit surface area per unit time), and this requires either a lot of conventional (water - it's actually still one of the best all-round cooling liquids we have) coolant, or somewhat less of exotic things like sodium and lead (melting points ~400 and ~700°C, boiling points ~800 and ~1800°C) which, though having a significantly lower specific heat capacity, can absorb much more heat before boiling and so can cool very hot objects more rapidly. These are already used in some experimental fission reactors for this exact reason - the pile operates at temperatures where cooling water would flash into steam and inhibit further water from reaching the heat interface. Obviously, metal coolants (and salt coolants, which are similar) must be kept hot (above freezing point) at all times otherwise they freeze in the pipes, which is a Bad Thing. A middle ground is NaK (sodium-potassium alloy) which is liquid at just above room temperature and boils at ~400°C.  In short, yes it's quite possible to make a heat exchanger which could take the insane temperatures involved - it's just difficult and expensive, but then this is nuclear physics we're talking about.   Aside: Other, even higher melting point, coolant materials also exist - things like iron, all the way up to tungsten at m.p. 3500°C (although finding ways to handle it is up to you)."
tech,3cke8o,hexapodium,1 point,Wed Jul 8 20:00:16 2015 UTC,"So all in all, what I am seeing is this wouldn't be practical for electrical power generation but great as a drive technology and could produce maybe enough power to keep itself going by harvesting charged particles going into the stream (since those are small and you don't need heat loops to keep that going).  I had ideas for hypothetical aircraft where civilian and low speed atmospheric craft use a Lockheed style generator and an ionic wind engine (take a box wing and use that as your electrode area) for flight since that is really effecient and safe (and should be good to low Mach numbers).  Then for military and spacecraft launch use this laser ignition system since it would allow you to go WAY faster and give the necessary impulse to punch out of the atmosphere."

tech,3cke8o,krista_,1 point,Fri Jul 10 21:35:59 2015 UTC,"Any reciprocating mechanism is much, much higher maintenance and lower efficiency than a turbine (or a heat engine), just because it has to accomodate parts being repeatedly accelerated and decelerated over and over. This one in particular would have to deal with repeated nuclear explosions on or near the piston head, which is thus unlikely to have much of a service life.   What you're proposing amounts to a very large, nuclear powered two-stroke engine; while we do see very large two-stroke engines in some contexts (large ships, principally) the reason they exist there has more to do with the economics of their fuels and the happy accident that optimal propeller speeds match closely to the optimal RPM range for very large marine engines."

Sure you get a lot of extra heat from a U-238 layer, but you're getting that heat because it's decaying into Pu-239. Which, of course, is the most common fuel in nuclear weapons. Install these on Boeing's fleets, and you're flying a pair of healthy breeder reactors to every country in the world. It would be a proliferation nightmare.

The fission part makes up the excess, and turns the neutron output of the fusion reaction into an asset as well as a problem.  The nuclear proliferation thing is definitely a problem, as would be the irradiation of the craft by the neutrons that don't get captured by the U-238, so I definitely can't see an application for this within Earth's atmosphere, even unmanned, but it'd be fine for a space probe."

I'm saying that this design could never go to market since lots of fertile material flying around with the tool needed to make it fissile is a huge security risk."
tech,3cke8o,TheMeiguoren,2,Thu Jul 9 01:24:57 2015 UTC,"Not quite, the fission powers the fusion, the fusion is being used as a rocket/jet engine with no energy recovery, therefore by coupling this ""thruster"" with a fusion reactor that's capturing energy, then you could remove the fission reactor source.  Basically i'm seeing the lockheed fusion reactor sitting in between 2 or 4 of these thrusters.  Edit: instead of compressing air and fuel to get a big bang, they're compressing hydrogen to get a big bang. the energy for the compression comes from the fission reactor.  This engine still needs an outside Jolt to start it though, which will probably come in the form of a supercapacitor."

First Action allowances with no Examiner Amendments is going to be some very tiny percentage of allowances.  All of them all considered legally valid.  That is a very very difficult question. How many inventions are truly groundbreaking? Pretty much nothing. All technology exists as incremental improvements over old technology. So where do you set the bar for a patent? And who even decides whether an invention is better, or just different?  When granting patents, we look at whether it is novel and non-obvious. It is pretty much impossible to quantify ""worth while"" or ""contributes to society"", however novel/non-obvious is a bit easier to identify."
tech,3cke8o,lordnecro,1 point,Thu Jul 9 14:14:26 2015 UTC,"All of them all considered legally valid.   Then what would be the point of challenging them in court? I'll agree they're assumed to be valid when they are granted until the courts rule otherwise. As I see it, the courts deciding a patent was invalid means it shouldn't have been granted in the first place.   When granting patents, we look at whether it is novel and non-obvious.   Isn't it supposed to be useful too?  Also, most of the patent claims I've seen seemed rather obvious.  (Although I realize they may not be obvious to someone who hasn't thought about the problem at all.)"
tech,3cke8o,aiij,1 point,Thu Jul 9 20:22:37 2015 UTC,"As I see it, the courts deciding a patent was invalid means it shouldn't have been granted in the first place.   Here is what people don't understand. When I work on a patent, I have about 5-8 hours for a First Action, maybe half that for a Second Action, probably 1 hour for an Advisory Action. In that time I have to find all relevant art and write up my rejections, plus find all other issues with the case. When it goes to court, you have entire TEAMS spending literally HUNDREDS/THOUSANDS of hours combined. Yeah, in that amount of time, obviously they can do a better job. But for the most part we do an excellent job with the time given.  However we are specialists in our tech fields, so even if we can't find exactly the best art, we can find something close. Each round of prosecution we force the Applicants to amend and narrow their claims. So while they are still getting a patent, it is much narrower than when they originally filed. The claims are the only important part of the patent application with regard to actual coverage.   Isn't it supposed to be useful too?   Yeah, but that bar is so low as to be pretty much non-existant.    Also, most of the patent claims I've seen seemed rather obvious.    I would be glad to look at a case with you if you have an example.   There are a few things to keep in mind. It is based on obviousness at the time of filing - looking back at a 5-10 year old case, yeah it may seem obvious, but at the time it wasn't. Also ""obvious"" is not the laymans version of it, it is slightly different in patent law. To be obvious, I basically I need to find 1-3 prior art references that teach all of the subject matter and that can be logically placed together. Also, you need to look at the claims. People like to read the abstract and say it is a stupid patent, but only the claim language is important. I don't even read the specification/background/etc. of an application I work on, I only read the claims."

tech,3cke8o,alexja21,7,Wed Jul 8 20:01:03 2015 UTC,"Conservation of energy isn't the goal here (though thermodynamics concepts are certainly being utilized).    The goal here is being able to have on energy type go in (chemical, electrical, etc) and have another come out (kinetic).  it may very well be the case that this can be more efficient than, say, burning gasoline to get kinetic energy.  We also put more (chemical) energy into current day jet engines than we get back in kinetic energy, but that doesn't prevent us from using them.  When it comes down to it, we are not looking for a net positive energy here, we are looking for an efficient energy conversion."
tech,3cke8o,puterTDI,4,Wed Jul 8 18:59:16 2015 UTC,Yeah.. how much fuel (in the form of the deuterium\tritium being burned) is this burning (weight-wise) and how does that compare to the weight and cost of existing fuels? If its much more efficient by weight you can carry less fuel weight meaning less fuel to carry that fuel.
tech,3cke8o,fco83,4,Wed Jul 8 19:13:43 2015 UTC,This is the biggie: The size and weight of fuel consume enormous amounts of space and fuel on modern day jetliners. Reducing this is a massive boon for Boeing. Efficiency is the next horizon for air transportation.
tech,3cke8o,andhelostthem,3,Wed Jul 8 19:20:07 2015 UTC,it doesn't even necessarily have to be more efficient now that I think about it.  If it results in a more powerful engine then they'd be willing to spend more to fuel it.
tech,3cke8o,puterTDI,2,Wed Jul 8 19:34:46 2015 UTC,"I'm talking about sustaining the reaction.  The way a jet engine works, you get it spooled up, introduce fuel and ignition, and it's self-sustaining.  All the potential energy in the fuel is turned into kinetic energy due to the heat of combustion.  Fusion energy isn't at that stage yet.  It takes more energy to unlock the potential energy in the hydrogen and helium than the reaction itself produces.  In the example of the engine, it would be as if all the energy produced by the turbine would go to powering the lasers needed to sustain the reaction, and the engine would still need another source of energy to keep it going.  As far as I'm aware, that's the state of fusion technology today."
tech,3cke8o,alexja21,1 point,Wed Jul 8 21:20:46 2015 UTC,Why do you need to use the engine's energy to power the lasers?
tech,3cke8o,puterTDI,2,Wed Jul 8 19:36:42 2015 UTC,"At the same time, the inside wall of the engine's thruster chamber — coated in uranium 238 — reacts with the high-energy neutrons produced by the nuclear reaction and generates immense heat.  The engine harnesses the heat by running coolant along the other side of the the uranium-coated combustion chamber.  This heat-energized coolant is sent through a turbine and generator that produces electricity to power the engine's lasers. Yes, lasers!   Because that's what the article said.  How else are you going to sustain the lasers?  Mounting even bigger engines on top of the nuclear engines seems counter-productive, especially when these secondary engines have to produce more energy than the nuclear engines."
tech,3cke8o,alexja21,0,Wed Jul 8 20:34:36 2015 UTC,"fair enough, I missed that part of the article.  At this point then this patent is about how to utilize fusion once/if it becomes a net positive.  that being said, they still could make workable engines without a net positive energy output - which is the point I was making."
tech,3cke8o,puterTDI,2,Wed Jul 8 20:45:09 2015 UTC,If they don't patent it now someone else will.
tech,3cke8o,Mister_Alucard,2,Wed Jul 8 20:50:13 2015 UTC,My understanding is we only have trouble getting net positive from controlled fusion (i.e more result than the ignition energy). H-bombs do pretty well on this front.  Because if this it has been proposed before the idea having a concave back of a ship and just throwing h-bombs out the back repeatedly. I've read about it in sci-fi novels that were decades old.  This just seems like a refinement on that.
tech,3cke8o,happyscrappy,1 point,Wed Jul 8 20:54:16 2015 UTC,It's a hybrid fission/fusion engine so the fusion part does not need to be positive. It's there to generate high velocity minutes minimally radioactive exhaust which is what you want for a fuel efficient rockets.

I've been through about 4 or 5 gaming mice because they die young... but I have an old battery powered mx700 that's going on 10+ years, so hey... not too bad overall."
tech,3cjizh,SCphotog,3,Wed Jul 8 13:31:42 2015 UTC,"Having said that I think the G27 Wheel is a damned bargain.   Too good for them to continue selling it as it turns out. They took the shifter away (you can still buy it separately for $80), grafted on the wheel from the driving force gt and updated the packaging all for a mere doubling of the price. But hey, it works with Xbox one now."
tech,3cjizh,lukeatron,0,Wed Jul 8 14:04:10 2015 UTC,"They upgraded the interior components a great deal from what I understand, though I just got my G27 a few months ago, so I don't want to see how much better the new one is. ;)  There's a ton of people who don't use the h-shifter. Which is a shame. It takes a little bit to get used to, but it enhances the experience a great deal.  Of course it's useless in a game like F1, because F1 cars have a sequential gearbox."
tech,3cjizh,SCphotog,3,Wed Jul 8 14:09:22 2015 UTC,"Their warranty support is world-class though - every single time I have dealt with them (which has only been like twice) they have gone way above and beyond any of my expectations.  For example I had a first-gen G600, one of the ones with the non-upgradeable firmware and the less-than-perfect lasers (which jumps around all over the place, supposedly fixable by a firmware update I can't install), and after I started having a few issues with it, I sent two emails and a picture of the serial number tag to them and had a brand new mouse in less than a week. Didn't even have to return the old one, I was told to keep it for parts in the off event something happens with the new one.  The other time I had to get in touch with support was over losing the ball out of a first-gen TrackMan and trying to get a new one. $5 for shipping and I had a new ball in a week.  But all that being said, Linux drivers are very overdue, G27 drivers need some working around and updating (why do I need a separate Control Center from the standard one for a single product?)"

You need equipment like routers and switches to handle all that traffic, and different kinds of servers to make it easy for humans to navigate (because humans don't think in terms of IP addresses - we use letters). You also need people to make sure everything is running smoothly.  After all that work, hopefully someone would start putting up their own server using the IPs you gave them to host their own websites for their little hobby or business...but it ain't sellin' air.

You can use your drive (home network/wifi router) for free, but to go to the shops or to cross the continent you need to use a road system. If you buy access from you local RSP (road service provider) to your local roads then it automatically includes access to all roads on a peering arrangement with other road network suppliers and motorway suppliers. Without the income from your access purchase nobody would maintain the roads and eventually you'd get nowhere.  There's also an argument about road-net neutrality. Some road suppliers will only allow you to go to their shops, or use cars they build, on their roads. Unless you can use your own car and select your own destination you're going to have problems pretty quickly.  To answer your question from the analogy, the bulk bandwidth is the internet equivalent of motorway and trunk road owners / maintainers; they carry large volumes of data between the town road suppliers that you pay, and they have their own equipment and maintenance problems to manage with the payment they get from your ISP."

Well, duh, that didn't happen. 5 year olds and grade school kids today have absolutely no interest in hacking and programming. These things are for adult nerds. Mostly.  And if you think RPi is ""much more complex""... It probably is for someone with an IQ under 42.

You have to build circuits to do anything with an Arduino.  This has a light grid and several sensors onboard.  You can make a metal detector or spirit level without any additional parts.  I'm struggling to think of anything you can do with the Arduino straight out of the box.  Don't get me wrong - I like the Arduino and have about 5 of them myself - but this is simpler.

If the key is actually the public key of a keypair that signs your content, this offers significantly more than a NATted IPv6 tunnel."

Those are very different technologies even though they're both ""flash"". A USB stick will die very quickly if you try to use it like a hard drive (constant reads/writes), the flash in it has far, far less endurance than a SSD does. (Side note: This is also why Readyboost didn't work very well on Vista/7, it tends to kill the stick in a year or less).  On the USB/low-endurance front, Sandisk just released a 200gb MicroSD card, which is pretty impressive.   Felt sort of the same way with phone flash memory. It went from 1GB to 32/64GB really fast - and since then it's just stagnated.   The latest flagships have a 128gb tier (Galaxy S6, iPhone).   But I think it's more that they aren't making a huge effort for higher capacity because they don't think most people care.

With only 4 distinct levels in the cells instead of 8 it takes a lot more before a NAND cell falls to a level of charge which represents a different digital value than it did when written.  Still, I hope you're not too much against rewriting data to fix this, because that's the actual fix. Drives typically have firmware which rewrites old blocks over time to prevent this problem. Samsung applying it as a global rewrite pass is non-standard but it doesn't actually hurt the drive life much more than the ""proper"" fix does.  Either way, unless you are a very heavy user you will discard the drive due to being functionally obsolete (too slow, no one uses SATA anymore or just too small) before it wears out.

tech,3c7gzj,RichardRan,4,Sun Jul 5 16:35:14 2015 UTC,"Most new batteries contain 1.5V of energy when first bought.    I just can't trust anyone who hasn't got the slightest clue what ""energy"" is.   Batteriser uses micro-circuitry that lets you instantly tap into the 80% energy that is usually thrown away.   They seem to be assuming the voltage curve from 1.3V to 0V is completely linear as well, which is not the case, and that the capacity of the battery won't change as the discharge current increases as the cell discharges"
tech,3c7gzj,wolfcry0,3,Sun Jul 5 16:41:39 2015 UTC,"At 1.3V on the average alkaline battery discharge curve, the battery still has about 80% capacity. That part is correct. So if a device cannot operate below 1.3V, this voltage booster will help.  However most modern devices actually run fine on 1.2V NiMH rechargeable batteries, with discharge curve between 1.3~1.1V. The only voltage-sensitive device I've seen lately are motor-driven clocks. So an alkaline battery can drain down to maybe 1.1V and still power those devices.  At 1.1V on the discharge curve, an alkaline cell is almost depleted (~10% capacity). So this device pretty much does nothing if your devices can use rechargeables which are rather cheap now and can be recharged hundreds of times. A NiMH rechargeable pays for itself in less than 10 charges.  DC-DC boost converter topology has a much lower conversion efficiency than simple buck converters. Buck converters can often hit 95% efficiency with good-sized inductors (for low RDC). Boost converters tend to top off at 85% efficiency. So subtract at least 15% from the total capacity for power loss. From the picture it looks like they're not using any good-sized inductors so efficiency is probably lower, therefore I'm going to guess ~70% efficiency. So subtract 30%. Conversion efficiency also tend to suck even more for low-drain applications which Alkalines excel at.  Aside from these issues it looks like the idea is OK. But I would just stick with my Eneloops."
tech,3c7gzj,Y0tsuya,2,Sun Jul 5 23:49:07 2015 UTC,"you can not get your alkaline batteries running all the way down to 0.5v with any other type of boost circuitry   1) These type of products don't have ""special"" boost circuitry.  They're just miniaturized version of existing boosters.  2) You can't really run an alkaline battery down to 0.5V.  If you look at an alkaline discharge curve, the juice is pretty much gone by 1.1V.  By then the internal resistance is too great to output much of anything.  3) Remember that a booster circuit is a power converter.  Boosting a voltage requires higher current draw at the source, and that's before conversion loss.  This runs counter to the higher internal resistance of the battery when it drains.  One thing you'll see with battery boost circuits is that once this happens past a tipping point, the system will quickly spiral down and you'll get no output."
tech,3c7gzj,Y0tsuya,4,Sun Jul 5 19:27:36 2015 UTC,"The juice is not gone at 1.1V, the battery is just no longer functional in electronic devices   It's is 90% discharged at that point.  Google the ""alkaline discharge curve"" and it shall be clear.  It's not worth it for me to wring the remaining 10% out of it.  It is however worth it for me to buy a rechargeable NIMH and just recharge it.   I think of the Batteriser technology as a joule thief   A joule thief has very limited applications because it only supports very low current draw.  These days I can only think of ""dumb"" IR remotes which fit the description.  And the dumb IR remotes run the battery down < 0.9V anyway.  The smart remotes like Logitech Harmony are moderate-to-high-current and eats batteries for lunch.  Those do better with rechargeables.   At the end of the day, I know my batteries have a lot of juice when I throw them away   I implement a different strategy.  Use Alkalines for low-current-long-life devices such as IR remotes, and to test new devices (to see how fast it runs down fresh alkalines).  I pay $10 for a pack of Costco AAs and those last me more than a year.  Everything else uses Eneloops or other LSD NIMHs, which can be recharged hundreds of times.  They pay for themselves after 10 charges."
tech,3c7gzj,Y0tsuya,3,Sun Jul 5 19:35:21 2015 UTC,"My eneloops have always run pretty well at least for tens of charging cycles.  It's true as with all rechargeables that they will hold less charge as time goes on, but that only becomes significant after a hundred cycles or so.  By then I'd have gotten my investment back and then some.   I work in the silicon valley, and I know credible engineers who co signed the gadget.  If it can run batteries all the way down to .5V, would you not consider it an incredible gadget   Well I work in the Silicon Valley too.  And I've done my share of power circuitry so I know my way around the basic DC-DC converter topologies and battery discharge curves.  As I've mentioned before, the battery internal resistance increases as the battery discharges, making it ever harder to pull the stored charge out of the battery.  At very low current draw this is not a problem.  But it is a problem at higher current draws (like in a digital camera).  DC-DC conversion is a power conversion, no matter the topology.  Basically:  (source) V * I * E = V * I (load)  Where E = efficiency, usually 0.85 for a good switcher.  But let's be extremely generous and say this joule thief operates at 100% efficiency.  (source) V * I = V * I (load)  And let's say your digital camera draws 500mA (digicams are high-drain devices) from 2 AA cells (operating the zoom servos and taking pictures).  3V * 0.5A = 1.5W.  Let's assume an unloaded alkaline is 1.6V (open circuit).  A good alkaline usually has 0.15ohm internal resistance when fresh, and 0.3ohm when 50% discharged.  Let's also be generous here and say at 1.1V (90% discharge), it's still 0.3ohm.  2 cells in series give 0.6ohm.  But it still must supply 1.5W to the load.  (2.2V - (I * 0.6ohm)) * I = 1.5W  Solving for I (the current) comes to about 0.9A.  So you're drawing the battery at higher and higher current as it drains in order to maintain the output power.  This just drains it ever faster and the whole thing spirals down quickly.  If the load has low current (< 100mA).  Then this joule thief is more workable.  But it won't work for high-drain devices.  You're better off with NiMH rechargeables there."

Often it's a trade off between the old way of doing things and a newer (possibly better, possibly worse) method.  It's pretty weird, a lot of open source operating systems Linux, BSD,  etc., are so far ahead in certain respects and so far behind in others.  My favorite thing about Linux is package management. It makes installing programs in Windows look archaic by comparison. It's just a bummer I can't have all of my preferred application on that OS.  In all honesty though it's incredibly simple to pin programs to the start screen, or pin them to the taskbar, or add a shortcut to the desktop, or hit the superkey and type the name of the program and hit enter... (you get the idea).  The overall OS is actually much better than Windows 7 in my opinion (minus organization, and the focus shifting away from desktop/power users)."

Virtual desktops are quite a nice feature to have and it's far better than any custom implementation.  Do you have HiDPI screen or plan to have one (that 4k monitor you've been drooling over)? 7 won't handle it too well.  Obviously you are going to miss on the app store - which is huge and might be actually a problem in 2-3 years as it's likely to become de-facto software delivery platform on Windows now that it's able to carry full Win32 programs and games, windowed WinRT apps, web apps, Android apps and iOS apps. There are also some exclusives games to that Store and Windows 10 - if you want Killer Instinct, Gigantic or Fable Legends (as examples), and who knows what later down the line, you'll need to pick 10.  Not to mention you will be missing out on a system that is likely to be supported and updated (free) for 10 or more years with whoever knows that kind of features in the pipeline.

I know there are plenty of complaints about the 8.1 UI, but after you get used to it you realize how archaic Windows 7 is, and 10 only improves on 8.

It is customers getting off of XP (Which can do v6) and their antique routers, then we can reclaim that IP space.   Or at least get them to use NAT and convert that to v6.

tech,3bxe9v,cvmiller,2,Fri Jul 3 23:13:54 2015 UTC,"I see there is a fair bit of IPv6 education that needs to be done.  1) there is no variable subnet mask in IPv6. It is always /64 (and yes, that is a lot of IP addresses per subnet)  2) FE80 addresses are link-local addresses. They are used for, among other things, MAC address resolution (there is no ARP in IPv6). They are not routable, and therefore every device that supports IPv6 will have one.  3) The loopback address (akin to 127.0.01) is ::1/128 in IPv6. That address does not leave the box, just like the IPv4 loopback does not  4) There is a thing called the Internet of Things, it will put something like 20 billion things with addresses on the internet, IPv6 will be needed for this kind of expansion. And yes, your fridge, toaster, lights, temp sensors will all have IPv6 addresses soon enough.  5) If you want to learn more about IPv6, give RFC 2460 a read.  It is great to hear that Comcast (and others) are deploying IPv6 to the end user.

For our P2P BGP connections, they are almost always /126 addresses.  From what I've seen most ISP's do not hand out /64 for single subscriber address space.  There may be some, and hell, we've got the space to do it.  But if you are assigned a block larger than /64 (I've seen /44 space assigned) then you can bet your sweet ass that if you search, or if your neighbors search - there will be an open network somewhere near by.  20 years ago when I got into the game, 4,294,967,296 was considered more than enough from a lot of ""Experts"".  They also thought that the global routing table would never hit 50k routes.  A lot of things have changed since then.  I never thought I'd have a phone I could slip into my pocket and carry around.  The best I could hope for was a bag phone mounted on my center console.  I never thought I'd have to reboot my phone because of an OS update.  At that time, all I thought I'd ever have to do is turn on the power and wait for it to find a cell tower.  Things have changed, and they have changed a lot for interwebz connected devices.  When I first saw a fridge with a twitter connection I laughed out loud and died a bit inside.  I don't need the world knowing what I have in my fridge to help me cook up dinner.

The worm was first noticed and started spreading on August 11, 2003. The rate that it spread increased until the number of infections peaked on August 13, 2003. Once a network (such as a company or university) was infected, it spread quicker within the network because firewalls typically did not prevent internal machines from using a certain port.  Filtering by ISPs and widespread publicity about the worm curbed the spread of Blaster.  On August 29, 2003, Jeffrey Lee Parson, an 18-year-old from Hopkins, Minnesota, was arrested for creating the B variant of the Blaster worm; he admitted responsibility and was sentenced to an 18-month prison term in January 2005.

Remember that in the early 90's was when the next-gen IP was conceived, because of the fear of running out of IPv4 addresses.  I agree with AwesomeFama, it is a mindset  change that is required for IPv6, one from scarcity to one of plenty. Think about when your gas tank (on your car) is almost empty. You carefully marshal the gas, by not accellerating fast, while looking for the next gas station. And when you have a full tank, you are happy to push the gas pedal to the floor. It is a mindset change.  There are so many things in IPv6 which are based on /64, that you will make your life much harder if you decide to ""save"" addresses. It really isn't worh it.

Imagine if instead of that, you were looking to see which of the following peptides you had (all standard notation, N->C):  CAT, ATC, TCA, TAC, ACT, or CTA  I would love to see a spectroscopic experiment capable of identifying the ratios of these in a mixed solution of all 6.

That really is a unique problem, but MS/MS on a small molecule and a known unique structure you could glean a lot more information. From MS. Say you are looking for something with a MW of 456.3251. You can dwell on that peak and knowing its composition #C, H, O you could identify major structures by the fragments that form. It's not easy, but once the legwork is done, that fingerprint should be deplorable like in clinical laboratory MS systems.   In a complex mixture of identical composition but different orientation though. The system would intelligible (other than the potential false positives from identifying common fragments).

Your VPN can be compelled to give up your origin IP address (or maybe the NSA gives themselves a backdoor into the VPNs servers and collect this data without their help or knowledge).  This device helps reduce this risk by not originating the connection from your own internet connection.  You piggy-back off someone elses Wi-Fi (like McDonalds, Starbucks, etc).  You hide the device within range of the McDonalds WiFi, and then the device bridges the connection to your computer via a separate radio wave, which can travel for a mile or two.  So your laptop will send the data over 900MHz radio waves to your box in the bushes outside McDonalds, which then makes the connection through McDonalds internet connection, from McDonalds IP address.  So to anyone who gets your IP from your VPN, it looks like you're sitting in the McDonalds parking lot, when in reality you are over a mile away.  Of course, with the proper hardware they can locate your relay box, and then triangulate where the radio waves are going to/coming from to find your location, but this is a major pain in the ass and requires technicians to physically be on site and performing this work... much more effort/time/money than simply getting their hands on your home IP address.

Bioethanol is an interesting idea, but it's probably never going to be able to more efficient than getting oil out of the ground.

Not to mention the core market segment that used to net Cisco millions is moving away from general purpose networking hardware. Google, Facebook, MSFT, are all building their own customized network hardware solutions now that are developed exclusively in house, specifically to avoid doing business with Cisco. Cisco needs to either recapture this marketshare somehow or pivot in such a way that it regains the lost revenue from these market segments. OpenDNS has had 20% growth each quarter for the past 10 consecutive quarters. To put this into perspective, they've grown more than 200% in the past 2.5 years.   Now how they'll justify it, obviously I'm not sure, but if they take a completely hands off approach here they have a not too shabby revenue stream. Looking further ahead, it would make sense if Cisco just started incorporating ODNS software directly into new product firmware. Just a couple options, but these aren't even all that nefarious, I'm sure the Cisco execs have already thought of something utterly diabolical ;)"

So much of their equipment, often including bread and butter routers and switches are just so hap-hazardly put together, I can't support the idea that they're hatching some plan to take over the world.  Acquiring ODNS seems like just another one of those things.  They don't care WHY it's good, only that it can be bought and I'm sure one of their major customers was interested in ODNS and Cisco made the purchase on the customers behalf so they now have access to that software while still maintaining Cisco's brand of business support.  I am not saying Cisco isn't terrible, they are (sometimes they're ok).

Being able to detect the direction and distance of a sound in 3D space is definitely a big hurdle to overcome in filtering out unwanted noise. What they need next is the ability to filter out unwanted noise the way the brain does it.  It's not all exactly clear how the biological implementation of the brain filtering out unwanted sound works exactly. This article talks about interesting observations though:    After monitoring the brain activity of epilepsy patients, the researchers found that in the auditory cortex, the brain region which processes sound, both noises we want to focus on and those we wish to ignore are jumbled together.  But by the time the signals reach ""higher order"" parts of the brain involved in language processing and attention control, the signals for voices we want to pay attention to are clear, and unwanted ones have vanished.   Maybe if some day we can emulate this process then that microphone system working together with it might be able to do the trick for helping robots hear as well as if not better than us. :)"

The problem is there's generally a certain amount of resistance or apprehension (or simply lack of information) by the target demographic that makes them less willing to want to use such devices. It sounds like it would be less of a headache but when you're a teenager for instance it's far easier to be secretive about injecting some insulin than it is to walk around school with a device permanently attached to your hip.

tech,3bjk4k,_johngalt,3,Tue Jun 30 12:08:29 2015 UTC,"What's to stop the pieces of plaque that's broken off from flowing up to the brain, getting stuck and causing a stroke?   Because of the anatomy. The areas they're looking for this to be used are coronary artery disease, where tough plaques form in the smaller arteries supplying the heart. Once the artery is unblocked, the vessel becomes smaller eventually reaching the capillary stage to carry out exchange of gases and nutrients. But this size is so small that if it can get past it (which it should to treat the issue) then it likely won't present a problem in the brain either. Moreover, after the capillaries the blood flows into the venous drainage of the heart which mixed with the normal venous drainage and then goes to the lung. Here is another capillary stage to get past before it can go to the brain. You'd sooner cause a problem here than in the brain (and this is why blood clots in the deep veins in the leg can cause pulmonary embolism, rather than affecting the brain).  Anyway, I'm not entirely sure what size these robots would break the plaque into, but it would have to be small enough to not cause problems in either the heart or the lungs. And because these plaques are hard and calcified (unlike the softer and 'dissolvable' blood clots) they would really need to be careful to get rid of them properly so they won't just be floating around the body.  Conventional treatments may not be perfect, but they are achievable fairly rapidly through interventional methods which is when they are the most important, so I wonder how fast they'd even be able to deliver this and how long it would take. It's rather useless if the robots work too slow when they can just insert a stent or do balloon dilatation, even if the efficacy isn't super high (which remains a problem because plaques can reform around a stent eventually). It may be more useful when patients would receive elective treatment when their symptoms are more chronic in nature to prevent it from getting worse and causing entire blockage, but I digress..."

tech,3bjk4k,_johngalt,2,Tue Jun 30 15:36:41 2015 UTC,"I'm only a medical student, so this is something you should really speak to your doctor about and get their advice.  With that said, the coronary calcium scan can be another useful independent tool to assess cardiovascular risk of a person (in addition to the commonly used Framingham Risk Score, which combines your age, cholesterol levels and other factors). Questions remain as to how useful it is for predicting an acute event because these sorts of events (where a plaque breaks off and causes total blockage) generally occurs from the rupture of a smaller unstable plaque rather than a thicker plaque. That is to say the amount of plaque may not necessarily be predictive of the acute event happening, though it is thought that if you do have more calcified plaques you likely also have more unstable plaques that are prone to rupturing.  Anyway, besides those details generally studies have shown that this screening method adds particular value in asymptomatic individuals for predicting risk, and generally seems to be viewed as an additional tool to use if your Framingham score shows you to be of medium-risk, but has questionable benefit if that score shows you to be low or high risk. That is to say that screening shouldn't be done in a vacuum and done based on risk factors that have been identified.  For you this means chatting to your doctor and getting your Framingham Risk Score calculated, and asking them if you seem like an appropriate candidate for coronary calcium screening."

tech,3bk667,Dynehart,9,Mon Jun 29 21:56:56 2015 UTC,"Cheap title and weak argument. I do think that Bitcoin is not sustainable enough to replace a country's currency, but for different reasons.  Their main argument is that bitcoin wastes a huge amount of electricity. This is a reasonable argument, but it ignores various faults of the existing centralized systems:   Most centralized networks waste the time of various employees who work on regulating it. Unlike electricity, there haven't been advances to make human's time less valuable per year recently. It compares the BTC system to VISA, that would be like comparing the economy of all of Canada to a single city in the US. VISA doesn't need to do a lot of things that the full economy does. That is they don't guarantee or maintain the value of money, instead they just move it around. To put it shortly, VISA would compare better to a person that allows BTC transactions, but not the system that ensures its value. It handwaves away some reasonable concerns without bringing the evidence. It doesn't actually give sources to believe that they wouldn't matter. A better way to check things out is to consider the cost of bitcoin vs the cost of keeping a coin a-float. Basically you'd have to see how much electricity, hardware and such is used for bitcoin. OTOH you'd have to compare it to how much the ECB spends, how much it costs to print, how much is wasted on security resources to prevent counterfeiting, etc. etc. Security and logistical costs should not be those of managing a transaction (basically what VISA or Amazon does) since that is not about sustaining the currency, instead it's the costs of ensuring that money isn't created falsely, and that currency flow is regulated."
tech,3bk667,lookmeat,3,Tue Jun 30 00:31:29 2015 UTC,"All of these bitcoin unsustainability posts have giant flaws.  First, they look at the electribity from mining in isolation. Finance is 8% of the US's entire GDP.  How much eletricity does that take up?  Not only that but solar is rapidly reaching and surpassing parity with other utilities, driving the price of eletricity down.  We don't have a shortage of electricity now and we won't in the future. It will only come down to price. If the price of electricity makes bitcoin mining unsustainable, less people will mine until the remaining miners are able to make money.  The system adjusts.  A weaker price means less network security.  Lastly all these comparisons are not taking into the account the biggest factor.  Accepting more transactions doesn't scale linearly (not even close).  A miner could accept 100x the transactions for basically the same cost.  100MB in 10 minutes is only 1.3mb and most homes have a substantially faster connection, let alone a mining operation."

tech,3bk667,Antoak,1 point,Thu Jul 9 22:14:48 2015 UTC,"There is no limitation, if there was a large block size a miner could just accept as many transactions as they want.

tech,3bk667,__Cyber_Dildonics__,1 point,Thu Jul 9 22:49:59 2015 UTC,"There is no direct connection between hashing power and how many transactions a miner can accept.   Yeah, but there is a direct linear inverse relationship between how many transactions are accepted and your nominal blocks mined per hour rate, given the current network Target, isn't there? That's why there's transaction fees included, to incentivize your transaction making its way into the public ledger, because without that incentive miners would want to keep blocks small, because of how blocks propagate and make their way into the chain, right?  I thought the hash-rate mentioned in the hardware mining subreddits measure the number of bytes hashed using double sha256 per second, not the number of blocks or transactions hashed. As block size increases, the number of hashes per block increase, and the time per block increases, all linearly."
tech,3bk667,Antoak,1 point,Fri Jul 10 00:38:43 2015 UTC,I think you are getting hashing for mining mixed up with accepting transactions into a block.   The two are totally separate.   Miners compute hashes to compete for who will get to make the next block.    That block however can include as many transactions as they want with very little overhead (right now this is limited to 1 MB but hopefully that bottleneck will be removed).
tech,3bk667,__Cyber_Dildonics__,1 point,Fri Jul 10 03:20:49 2015 UTC,"Yes, it's likely I'm getting it mixed up. I had thought that the transactions included influenced the hash value of the block (the MerkleRoot), as a built in method of transaction integrity enforcement, so that someone couldn't inject transactions into announcements being broadcast to the network.  But in retrospect I guess that the hashes of all transactions only need to be computed once, so mining doesn't need to rehash the transactions, just the nonce."

You might say ML is a subset of AI, but a lot of people have preconceived notions about AI from previous research efforts which weren't nearly as successful as people hoped.  An automated car either has a collision or it doesn't. There's no difference to the computer whether it came within a quarter inch or 5 yards of another object.  Most high speed crashes are caused by overcorrection, something a computer cannot fall victim to. The only real error a self driving car could make would be a mis-sensing.

Any control system (again forget whether it's ML, AI or human) necessarily makes assumptions and simplifications in addition to working with incomplete and sometimes spurious data. There is plenty of room for him/her/it to make a ""mistake"" that leads to an accident.  What I think we can say is that different types of control systems have different strengths and weaknesses - a human can probably handle long term planning (watch out for that truck 4 cars ahead - it's been weaving slightly and the driver might be falling asleep) than any other system in existence today.

The biggest movie we had was actually an animated disney movie.  It was 440GB.  That was 4k JPEG2000 lossless, being broadcast on a 4K Sony projector, with 9 channel audio.  The audio file was only 39GB because it was a DTS stream.  That means the movie itself was 400GB.  They did not get smaller, and that was 10 years ago.  I am still friends with the manager.  He was posting pictures on facebook of their new SAN rack they got to load and store their incoming shows centrally to their 12 projector computers.  It is filled with 32 4TB drives.  Each individual client is fed to the SAN with a 10gigE CAT6a.  They have 11 theaters.  They usually have about 15 movies on hand at once, both current and future.  If they needed that much space to store 12 theaters worth of movies plus a few extra, you know they are big.  Even if they ran it in a RAID60, for double fault tolerance, that is 124TB of space.  Each client is loaded with two 2TB drives as well(I know those are running raid 1).  The movies are not getting smaller, because compression blown onto a huge screen means every defect will be seen.  They just got fed a gigabit fiber line too, specifically so they could download the movies over a VPN instead of having them sent and delivered by a security courier on 1 to 2TB HDDs."
tech,3b9d1d,snrrub,1 point,Sun Jun 28 19:07:41 2015 UTC,That's an irrelevant wall of text. We are discussing DCP size. In that wall of text you have not listed a single specific DCP size. Just something unspecific from 10 years ago.   Now i'll respond with some actual DCP sizes of recent movies: The Expendables 3 138GB (4K DCP) Chappie 135GB (4K) Aloha 126GB (4K) Magic Mike XXL 170GB (4K) Fury 143GB (4K) Maze Runner 110GB (4K) ... and so forth. I can go on and on. They can all be verified.  400GB is at the upper end. Most are 100-200GB. Plenty of 2K DCPs come in under 100GB.

tech,3b6pb5,woprdotmil,2,Sun Jun 28 17:54:41 2015 UTC,"I think you just cannot admit that linux is not for the common person.  Most of the changeovers I see are A) very small token systems, not mission critical systems, or B) moving to Red Hat linux servers, which is not a desktop, and is sold, to that makes it not free, and partially closed source, just like windows, and is definitely not for the feint of heart, with a very steep learning curve.  You could sit just about any windows user in front of a Windows server 2012 machine and have them configuring accounts, shares, ect with very little teaching because MS has included guides within the OS itself for most of it, and on top of that, you don't need to know any command line codes.  I see a few other token things, like supercomputers(not for everyday use).    In large scale deployment, Linux gets just as expensive or more expensive than windows.  You have to factor in additional training, since most people have no issues using windows, but the switch to something that is not windows, and cannot be close to windows will throw them off.  Then you have to factor in updates.  With linux, the user is mostly responsible for finding appropriate updates.  More so with a large scale deployment, because now the IT department needs to keep up with updates, and deploy them after testing.  With windows, MS writes the updates, you test them, and deploy them using a built in tool in windows server.  with linux, you end up hiring programmers to write custom pieces of software and such, which gets expensive really fast.  Switzerland dropped the idea, likely because they ran into the same issues of identical costs with loss of productivity.  A single school in the UK switched.  A district here, a university there, that is not many, and definitly not improving anything.  In closing, while you like Linux, thats great.   I am okay with it, it makes a good server OS.  Businesses have been using varients of Linux, and its base UNIX systems for years for, you guessed it, servers.  Its a very functional server, flexible, powerful, and light on resources.  It is also complex, difficult to master, and you rely on yourself and the community to write updates and fix things.  That last little bit is what most windows users will never get a handle on, which is why Linux, in general, is not for most of the computer users of the world."

tech,3ay8n4,Bag3l,9,Fri Jun 26 23:15:57 2015 UTC,A clear answer on what question?  If 4GB is enough VRAM? That is entirely dependent on the game and how much data the programmers want to send to the GPU. Witcher3 uses less than 2GB of VRAM at 4K (and is gorgeous) while I believe GTA5 can use up to 6GB of VRAM [someone correct me if I'm thinking of the wrong title] as can Shadow of Mordor.

tech,3ay8n4,JustCallMeBen,4,Wed Jun 24 20:55:19 2015 UTC,"Well that's disappointing. I was hoping AMD would actually have something worth paying attention to.   It looks as though the 980 Ti gives equivalent or better performance in all categories, while also being more flexible in its capability of supporting the extra special whiz bang graphical features that nVidia has developed as a part of their GameWorks libraries.  If the AMD Fury X had more on board memory, we might see that it performed better at 4k resolutions, but how many people actually have a 4k monitor?"
tech,3ay8n4,Slotos,13,Thu Jun 25 01:58:01 2015 UTC,"The memory is not a bottle neck. However the drivers, probably, are. I am fairly sure with some better drivers and with dx12 of course, fury will be a lot better.   Don't forget that whole 4gb of gddr5 might not be adequate, you can't put those same measurements on hbm because of its higher speeds.   And the fury beats both Titan X and 980 ti at 4k in some games, and in most ends up between them. It is by no means a bad or disappointing card.  Amd has also said that the coil noise is fixed and will not be on the consumer cards. But we'll see if that is true.   I am just glad that the card is, at the very least, a solid contender for Nvidias cards.  Edit:also, check more places for benchmarks. Guru3d and tomshardware has good tests."
tech,3ay8n4,JustCallMeBen,2,Wed Jun 24 16:15:34 2015 UTC,"Don't forget that whole 4gb of gddr5 might not be adequate, you can't put those same measurements on hbm because of its higher speeds   Right, and we all know that loading data from RAM and permanent storage is instantaneous.  One GPU handling 4K resolution doesn't make a false comparison true due to one-time correlation. Memory capacity and memory to chip speed are not interchangeable: if you lack capacity, your blazing fast memory will idle waiting for data from external sources; if you lack speed, your chip will idle waiting for data form your 32Tb memory bank. Neither can solve problems of the other."
tech,3ay8n4,Slotos,3,Wed Jun 24 18:18:31 2015 UTC,"You're right, but that makes it imo even more impressive: the limited amount of memory will cause slowdowns at higher resolutions and with modern games, as you say, yet still the Fury X performs on par with the 6GB 980Ti, and on average a lot better than the 4GB 980. The 980 clearly has a better GPU (you can see that in the 1080p benchmarks, where 4GB of memory is not a bottleneck), but at higher resolutions, the HBM really starts to shine.  The bandwidth is clearly helping a lot. I really want AMD to release an 8GB HBM GPU with a new chip architecture, and better drivers"
tech,3ay8n4,JustCallMeBen,0,Wed Jun 24 23:43:41 2015 UTC,"You're reducing a complex problem to one variable. Performance depends on multiple factors, memory capacity and performance being few of them. In addition to that it's hard to meaningfully compare basic numbers for different architectures.  The only thing the reviews tell us is that this GPU works nowadays. It will probably work for most multiplatform games for some time too. That's it, don't jump to conclusions.  What they don't tell us, is whether any currently available GPU will work with or even make possible for texture enhancement mods in a year. Those things can both eat up your capacity and clog your bandwidth simultaneously."
tech,3ay8n4,Moleculor,1 point,Thu Jun 25 08:44:17 2015 UTC,"...I know. A simple fact however is that 4GB is a really noticeable bottleneck on 4k gaming.

tech,3ay8n4,Snuffsis,0,Thu Jun 25 09:04:25 2015 UTC,"That bottleneck becomes significantly less of a problem on the Fury X, which is impressive and shows that HBM was not just a marketing thing.    You avoid demonstrating validity of both these claims second time in a row, attempting to use correlation in place of causation.  You haven't demonstrated that 4Gb is a bottleneck, you haven't demonstrated that this implied 4Gb bottleneck is alleviated by higher memory speed, you haven't demonstrated that HBM is a marketing / architectural / whatever thing. So stop making claims beyond what is demonstrable: Fury works and shows this and this performance figures in such and such games and tests. Full stop."
tech,3ay8n4,Moleculor,2,Thu Jun 25 09:25:26 2015 UTC,"You haven't demonstrated that 4Gb is a bottleneck   Well, you can't say ""this is a bottleneck in all situations"", because every game is different. But generally, in more and more games 4GB is becoming a bottleneck at 4k. This is known to anyone that is willing to read a review.  Example.  The 290x is one of the rare cards that comes in a 4 and an 8GB version, making it the perfect card to make the comaprison: everything stays the same except the amount of memory. The minimum FPS is raised from 15.9 to 23.3 fps (+46%).  In Tomb Raider, the minimum goes from 15.1 to 22.6 fps (+49%). In some other titles there is no significant difference, so those games just use less VRAM.  If we look at Tomb Raider, a game that benefits from the 8GB on the 290X, we can see in the psoted review that it also performs significantly better on cards with 6-12 GB GDDR5 (the 980Ti, Titan X) and the Fury X with its 4GB HBM, when playing in 4k: those cards their minimum FPS is higher than the other cards their average FPS. When we look at lower resolutions, this difference becomes much less explicit.  If you don't want to beleive the simple truth that 4K uses more VRAM, fine, that's your right. It's compeltely detachted from reality, but fine, have it your way.  Also:   you haven't demonstrated that HBM is a marketing / architectural / whatever thing. (...) Fury works and shows this and this performance figures in such and such games and tests. Full stop.   I haven't said anything tot he contrary. I have no clue what your point is."

And the fury beats both Titan X and 980 ti at 4k in some games   Did you read the article? Two or three games where there's a couple frames difference is not 'beating' anything, especially when in some of those same games the Fury X struggles to provide consistent/smooth framerates, essentially trading higher averages for choppier motion."

tech,3av3m7,quantumcoffeemug,1 point,Wed Jun 24 12:37:53 2015 UTC,"Call me a luddite if you will, but I find this genuinely frightening in the short-to-medium term. If we are getting good enough at AI to machine learning modernist recipes into existence, there are an awful lot of jobs that are going to become obsolete far faster than the economy or the people in it can cope.  Every time someone voices concerns about, say, self-driving cars putting taxi drivers out of work, a smug chorus is immediately ready to dismiss it by asking how many makers of buggy whips the car made redundant. But there is no iron law of economics that dictates all unemployment created by technology must be remedied by employment growth in other sectors - it's happened to work out in the past for the most part, but remember that we're not really looking at a particularly large swathe of history. The industrial revolution only began in the 1750's in England, and took time to spread.  Moreover, even if we assume that the rule will continue to hold, there's no bound on how long it may take for growth in other sectors to replace employment that's lost. And, moreover, the lives of those put out of work by automation may never recover. It's easy to say people should retrain into another industry in which there's more demand, but realistically a 40 year old truck driver isn't going to have the mental or financial resources to become a data scientist. Most likely he'll either end up working an extremely menial service job or permanently unemployed.   It won't be long before call centers and taxis will be fully automated. Doctors and lawyers will see their numbers greatly reduced, and even programmers may well feel the pinch of ""creative destruction"" - after all, if AI can learn what makes a recipe people like, it can learn to write boilerplate code or perhaps even design a simple website or app.   We are simply not prepared for this as a society. Our ""don't work, don't eat"" attitude is going to run up against the reality that we just don't have a reasonable way to use up the sum total of human labor. Unless we start seriously thinking about radical measures like a universal basic income, that excess labor is going to be put to use peeling grapes for rich people."
tech,3av3m7,mootwo14,2,Wed Jun 24 17:55:44 2015 UTC,"I hope that this doesn't get too off topic, but I think you've touched on one of the key reasons that people view capitalism as a bad basis for society. Under capitalism, the majority of the population requires a job to survive, which means you need at least one job per working person.   But the reality is that there are becoming fewer and fewer jobs as technology improves, and we don't really have a solution for this under the current system of society. This is why we need to consider alternatives, especially ones which don't require every citizen have a job."
tech,3av3m7,lookmeat,2,Wed Jun 24 21:20:50 2015 UTC,"You are correct in your fears. Generally speaking when jobs disappear new jobs do not appear, instead people with free time would focus on growth and doing some thing that weren't possible before.  A good example to look at is the industrial revolution. In the long term it came out very good, but in the short term it was a really shitty experience for many of the workers, which lead to labor movements the international worker's day. Even now when we think of abusive employers and distraught work we think of the 1800s.  Moreover this shifts allow power to focus greatly on a minority of people. Since this power is greatly economical it leads to the creation of new dynasties that can further impose themselves over others.  Things might change from the ""don't work, don't eat"", I don't think that work will disappear completely just yet, but it will get notably reduced again. Things will keep getting cheaper that adds a bit more of hope."

tech,3av3m7,foomanchu89,12,Wed Jun 24 00:29:16 2015 UTC,"Weak AI:       Weak AI (also known as narrow AI)   defines non-sentient computer intelligence, typically focused on a narrow task. Weak AI is defined in contrast to either ""strong AI"" (a machine with consciousness, sentience and mind) or ""artificial general intelligence"" (a machine with the ability apply intelligence to any problem, rather than just one specific problem). All real-world systems labeled ""artificial intelligence"" of any sort are weak AI at most.  Siri is a good example of narrow intelligence. Siri operates within a limited pre-defined range, there is no genuine intelligence, no self-awareness, no life despite being a sophisticated example of weak AI. In Forbes (2011), Ted Greenwald wrote: ""The iPhone/Siri marriage represents the arrival of hybrid AI, combining several narrow AI techniques plus access to massive data in the cloud.""  AI researcher Ben Goertzel, on his blog in 2010, stated Siri was ""VERY narrow and brittle"" evidenced by annoying results if you ask questions outside the limits of the application.   Some commentators think weak AI could be dangerous. In 2013 George Dvorsky stated via io9: ""Narrow AI could knock out our electric grid, damage nuclear power plants, cause a global-scale economic collapse, misdirect autonomous vehicles and robots...""  The Stanford Center for Internet and Society, in the following quote, contrasts strong AI with weak AI regarding the growth of narrow AI presenting ""real issues.""  — Ryan Calo, Center for Internet and Society, Stanford Law School, 30th August 2011.  The following two excerpts from Singularity Hub summarise weak-narrow AI:  — Aaron Saenz, Singularity Hub, 10th Aug 2010.

tech,3avr9g,hbwajb,3,Wed Jun 24 13:34:59 2015 UTC,"This is pretty much correct.  More or less, the advantage to memristors is being able to rapidly turn them on and off and get varying amounts of resistance while switching depending on the previous input current. One thing you didn't mention is that the ""memory"" effect in the resistance is fairly short, meaning the memristor will return to the intrinsic resistance fairly quickly.

tech,3at6ox,Quabouter,6,Tue Jun 23 20:53:29 2015 UTC,"We really are stretching ""app"" to the point of meaninglessness."
tech,3at6ox,mindbleach,2,Tue Jun 23 21:03:41 2015 UTC,So it's a file system embedded in a file and then ZIP is?
tech,3at6ox,tms10000,4,Tue Jun 23 20:25:13 2015 UTC,"No, at no point do you have a file system embedded in a file and zipped. What you're thinking of is probably an image file, which is basically a static snapshot of a (virtual) harddrive. Although containers do often use images, they are not images themselves.   In the case of docker you describe a system in a so called dockerfile. At the bare minimum you specify the base image that your container should start with (e.g. ""ubuntu 14.04""). On top of that you can specify commands to install software, create files, configure the system, or, and this is perhaps the most interesting part, define how the container should interact with its host. For example, a docker container can mount a folder of its host to a location within the container, or expose some service over some ports.   The docker service can read these dockerfiles and use them to dynamically create a new image based on these instructions. It can then launch a virtual machine with this image. Since these containers are created dynamically they provide a great amount of flexibility. You don't need to manually maintain dozens of images and make sure they all get updated regularly, deployed properly, etc. You just need to define how an image should be created, and docker will automatically do the rest for you.  Another important difference between a regular virtual machine and a container is that a virtual machine is isolated from it's host, but a container is not. A virtual machine doesn't even need to know it is a virtual machine, it just acts as if it is running directly on the hardware. A container however is designed to communicate with its host or other containers."
tech,3at6ox,Quabouter,7,Tue Jun 23 20:43:36 2015 UTC,"Now, Docker is donating its popular container format and runtime to the standard, opening them up to further development by an all-star coalition of companies that includes Apcera, Cisco, EMC, Fujitsu Limited, Goldman Sachs, HP, Huawei, IBM, Intel, Joyent, Mesosphere, Pivotal, Rancher Labs, Red Hat and VMware.   So really what it is Docker having done most of the legwork and then donating that to everyone else for everyone's benefit. They should be commended, far too few companies would even consider this let alone actually do it. Cheers to all those at Docker"
tech,3at6ox,jazir5,15,Tue Jun 23 15:57:43 2015 UTC,"Docker was already open source, ie the technology was already open.  Lets understand how Docker, the company, was born. Because docker was originally invented by dotCloud, a company that tried would sell a platform as a service. Docker was made open and shared because the more standard it became the better it would be worth for everyone.  When this new container standard becomes the default it'll be huge. Basically the biggest platform as a service hosts are in this standard and will push it, so it has a huge potential to become a default standard. Docker, the company, would benefit from Docker, the software, from being a standard, because they make their money of a service that allows you to host on their system. If Docker is the default people could make software for Amazon's or Google's service, but realize that Docker might offer a better deal and switch to them easily. The idea is that people will push for services that are as host independent as possible, so you can easily switch to the person offering you the best deal.  So it's great that Docker is doing this, but don't forget: this is just business. Docker is doing this to make the new standard as similiar to their current infrastructure as possible, so switching has a low cost for them. Also tying to work with open standards and evolving with them will help them not go the way of IE (especially when they are not a company with the spread or coverage that Microsoft used to have back then).  With that said, it's a sad thing that many companies think that they can still isolate a piece of the internet for themselves and keep that market captive. The internet seeks to be open and finds overly regulated or controlled systems as an error to work around."

I'm studying the porous effects personally. Introducing this sort of noise reduction exclusively decreases efficiency, hence why the article describes it as not having ""significant aerodynamic effects"". Changing the quality of the flow to ""put less energy into the air"" sounds like it'd save energy but it's much more significant for the craft to have good aerodynamic efficiency (Lift over drag and such) to save energy. If you don't believe me i included a source below.   “When scaled with the measured lift forces, as a simple approach to account for aerodynamic performance, it is visible that porous airfoils with low air flow resistivities are not feasible any more due to their poor aerodynamic performance. Porous airfoils with high air flow resistivities still lead to a noticeable reduction of trailing edge noise, even with only a small streamwise extent of the porous material.”  http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00348-009-0739-x"

If they are made more efficient then they will be able to produce more power with smaller cheaper blades, or make more power in lighter wind conditions.  but I dont think they will simply run them faster.  The blades have physical limits for stress too, thus faster means more stress and cost."
tech,3apilv,indyphil,3,Mon Jun 22 19:06:59 2015 UTC,"They can use gears to match the frequency for the power grid, but if the tips of the blades start going too fast then they aren't as efficient.

Rhino horn is not a commodity to its consumers, there's probably some Chinese medicinal reason why it needs to come from a live rhino and not a lab, so demand for the  real thing will not be abated by counterfeits. I'm not sure if synthetic diamonds increased the demand for the real diamonds though."

tech,3aja3n,shaggorama,0,Mon Jun 22 04:58:32 2015 UTC,"By that reasoning, synthetic diamonds should have long since replaced natural diamonds on the market.  EDIT: Here's an excerpt from a position statement published by The International Rhino Foundation:   Will rhino poaching stop with the sale of synthetic rhino horn?  As Colman O’Criodain, wildlife trade specialist with WWF International, points out, “There is already a huge quantity of fake horn in circulation in Vietnam but that isn’t denting the poaching levels.” (Africa Geographic).  And as a commentator on Safaritalk points out, buying synthetic horn if you could afford the real thing would be like trying to convince Jennifer Lopez she'd really rather have cubic zirconia in her engagement ring. Isn’t marketing synthetic horn to the “intender” group of consumers likely to increase the number of people wishing to buy real rhino horn as soon as they can afford it? Isn’t it also likely to boost the profit margins of the top-tier of horn smugglers who will continue to market “the real thing” on an increasingly exclusive basis?  White rhino with calf -  Ithala  South Africa (C) Steve and Ann ToonFurthermore, “wild” rhino horn might be perceived as more valuable / desirable / potent than “farmed” or lab-grown / synthetic rhino horn, as seen with other wildlife plant and animal products, e.g. tiger bone and ginseng. A report on Ensia explains, “The creation of a large cultivated ginseng industry has made wild ginseng root appear better and more desirable, driving prices up and increasing pressure on wild populations. Ginseng collecting has gone from a small seasonal occupation to a big money spinner in places like Appalachia. Illegal harvesting is rife and violent conflicts now occur over natural ginseng patches in formerly peaceful rural communities.”  Similarly, a Guardian article on plans to manufacture synthetic bear bile raises concerns that wild bears will not benefit: breeding bears isn’t cheap and it’s probably cheaper and easier to capture wild bears; having more bear bile available encourages TCM practitioners to prescribe it for a wider arrange of maladies; and that consumers will regard real bear bile as more authentic / potent than artificial bile.  Position of the International Rhino Foundation and Save the Rhino International:  In summary, we are opposed to the development, marketing and sale of synthetic rhino horn. As discussed above:   Selling synthetic horn does not reduce the demand for rhino horn or dispel the myths around rhino horn and could indeed lead to more poaching because it increases demand for “the real thing” More than 90% of “rhino horns” in circulation are fake (mostly carved from buffalo horn or wood), but poaching rates continue to rise annually Synthetic horn could give credence to the notion that rhino horn has medicinal value, which is not supported by science Users buy from trusted sources and value “the real thing” The availability of legal synthetic horn could normalise or remove the stigma from buying illegal real horn It will take time to develop synthetic horn and meanwhile the poaching crisis continues How can consumers and law enforcement officials distinguish between legal synthetic horn that looks real, and illegal real horn? Companies benefitting from making synthetic horn have shown very little commitment to use their profits to help the core problem of rhino poaching; besides which, those profits would meet only a tiny fraction of the total rhino protection costs that would remain to be met as long as demand reduction campaigns falter, as they would with the marketing of synthetic horn Finally, the manufacture / marketing / sale of synthetic horn diverts funds and attention from the real problem: unsustainable levels of rhino poaching    -- https://www.savetherhino.org/rhino_info/thorny_issues/synthetic_rhino_horn_will_it_save_the_rhino"

Both African species are at their breaking points, and the Javan and Sumatran rhinos are both less than 100 individuals in total. The Indian rhino has enjoyed protection from the Indian and Nepalese governments, but in the wake of the recent earthquake, this species may have just become more vulnerable to poaching.

tech,3adu4q,Xtorting,2,Fri Jun 19 16:08:36 2015 UTC,"It's weird since they explicitly will allow people to make blocks of different depths, but apparently covering the other blocks isn't okay.   And that's why it's not allowed.  How deep do you make the keyboard if modules are all different heights? How do you secure it?  I mean, companies are going to make them anyway, but that's why Google won't officially support them, at least not until the height issue gets worked out."
tech,3adu4q,Charwinger21,1 point,Fri Jun 19 13:17:10 2015 UTC,"Well it's not exactly hard for them to say ""hey, don't buy this block unless your other blocks are the same depth."" I can't imagine most people having blocks of different depths in the first place. Plus Google envisions it as a system where people are actively hot swapping their components based on their current activity.  I assume the allowance for different depths is to mostly allow for things like fancy camera lenses. Have you ever seen a Galaxy S4 Zoom? My girlfriend has one and it's pretty ridiculous, but also proves some people are fine with a misshapen/non-flat phone in exchange for certain things."

So many perfectly good parts of phones get tossed every 2 years when a replacement contract comes due.  It's not like solid state memory goes bad in 2 years, or even 5 years.  A 64GB SSD module may last you 6-7 years before needing replaced.  Buy a high end 400ppi screen module and you may be good for the same length of time.  CPU running hot after 2.5 years, replace it for 100 bucks and the phones as good as new.  Like long battery life?  Focus on high energy efficient components and use two blocks for batteries.  Everyone gets what they want.  The potential here is phenomenal."

tech,3adu4q,gfxlonghorn,6,Fri Jun 19 17:25:02 2015 UTC,"Well, Google ATAP is creating a ""Moonshot Factory"" within Mountain View designed to generate consumer moonshot projects. This factory could have a division for repairs and modifications. ARA modules have the ability to remove the shell covering the PCB hardware, allowing the consumer to customize not only the hardware but the look and feel of the entire module. The module shell is planned to be recyclable, the PCB is another story. I could see Google creating a system that offers a discount on future module purchases for recycling old ones. Just pay for a USPS stamp, place the modules within a semi-thick envelope, and ship it to the closest Moonshot factory to you.   If you build it, they will come."

I think what it really comes down to is whether Google can muster a substantial upfront investment to see if it could possibly work with that kind of model. There is a lot of money exchanging hands, and it's not immediately obvious how Google comes out ahead."

There will also be a huge used market for people who want the best and newest tech and buyers who want a functional phone on the cheap.  This is how PCs work right now.  I can sell my 970 and upgrade to a 980Ti right now for a few hundred bucks and someone else gets a perfectly good 970 for a nice discount and may run it for 4+ years.  I can continually have the best stuff in my rig, and someone else can make a very respectable machine for a very reasonable budget.  Getting this very functional system transfered to the mobile market is absolutely ideal in my mind."
tech,3adu4q,Shandlar,51,Fri Jun 19 14:40:46 2015 UTC,"Each individual module has to have more power components (more isolation and bypass and potentially extra voltage regulators), a small PCB, a mechanical case and an ara connector. In a traditional phone a lot of those things can either be shared or eliminated. And it is likely that they are wasting PCB area because it is a fixed mechanical area.     The reason why the PC market works is because you have a the luxury of more space, better cooling, and a bigger power envelope. Those are the specific reasons why the laptop market never became modular. The Project Ara phones will inevitably run hotter, use more power, and require more space.   You might be right that you can reuse certain components, but it really remains to be seen what the usable life would be for a module. Wear and tear definitely counts for something when your phone is constantly in use."

tech,3adu4q,Sassywhat,10,Sat Jun 20 00:47:07 2015 UTC,"I'm very much in agreement. With Nvidia developing modules, its possible we could upgrade our cpu and graphics modules every 18 months instead of replacing the whole phone every two years, that would be so good. And you shouldn't have to transfer numbers and settings, and teach a new predictive text every two years anymore.  Like you said, buy a high quality screen and it will outlast the rest of the components quite a way."
tech,3adu4q,AeitZean,14,Fri Jun 19 11:10:03 2015 UTC,"Camera.  If you want a really good camera and don't mind having a big lens, I can totally see high focal chips with 24 MP modules happening.  Plus since the thickness isn't standard, someone may figure out how to make it really thin, so the actual lens doesn't stick out past your other modules.  People who don't mind big heavy phones like myself may get a nice price break buying medium powered components that are large 2x2 blocks for much cheaper than the same component in a 1x2.  So much potential here, and with Google providing the platform, and Nvidia on board, it seems like a slam dunk.  Batteries is the biggest one.  It seems like batteries get better every 6 months nowdays, and you'll be able to improve your battery quality on demand at any point, let alone carrying around an extra block charged when you know you wont be around a plug.  I'm already sold.  This is ideal for anyone who doesn't care about a few extra grams of weight or an extra couple mm thickness in their phone.  I think that is a huge market."

tech,3adu4q,breakneckridge,5,Sat Jun 20 01:53:48 2015 UTC,"7 years ago a $99 micro sd held 2 gb. Now you can get 256 gb for that price. How good will they be in 7 years? What sorts of data storage demands will we be placing on our phones in 7 years when everything is in 4k?  Most every other component in a phone has undergone vast improvements in price/performance over the same time frame.   The modularity of a phone is in the software. You customize your phone by downloading different apps, not the hardware. If you want your system performance optimized, you got to buy the full package, so that everything works together well.   Compare phones to bicycles. You can totally build your own custom bike from ordered parts, but it'll cost you double or more than buying a stock bike from the 1000s that are on the market. There's always one that's prebuilt and suited to your discriminating tastes. Similar deal with phones.   My phones get replaced when I break them or lose them. Of course, with my note 4 I can replace the battery, the screen, and swap out sd cards with too much trouble, those are the most vulnerable parts.   In conclusion: project Ara is misguided and will never get you better price performance than the way it's being done now. There's about 2 bucks worth of raw materials in a phone. It's not a big deal to replace it every 2 or 3 years. Save yourself some trouble and buy some lego if you like moving little modular bits around."
tech,3adu4q,fricken,1 point,Fri Jun 19 14:45:44 2015 UTC,"Why would you compare building a modular phone to a bike? It isn't a great comparison, but it still works. I just bought a bicycle last week and they are extremely modular. I changed out the seat, the handlebars and the pedals.  A better comparison would probably be a desktop computer. I can build a comparable desktop for quite a bit cheaper than any pre-built machine.  Some of the modularity of a phone is in the software. You cannot get better CPU, better video card, better camera, etc. very easily.   Most current smartphones run $500 plus within the first 6 months of release. Are you telling me that this modular design can't compete with that?  I would rather have something that I can put together myself."
tech,3adu4q,deciduousness,2,Fri Jun 19 20:43:41 2015 UTC,"A desktop tower computer whether prebuilt or diy is pretty much the same. The components are extremely modular already, the difference is whether you want someone else to put the modules together for you or not.   A laptop is much harder to build yourself. Barebones laptops are kind of a thing in the gaming crowd, but that is pretty much it. Laptop components aren't as modular, and if you want modularity, you give up form factor. Modular batteries, non-soldered CPUs, modular GPUs, extra drive bays, etc. are all things only found in thicker laptops.   That is because modular components have to have modular packaging, and modular packaging inherently is more volume and weight used on plastic and less used on silicon.   If you want a thick, heavy phone, you will be fine with a modular phone. But I don't think people want thick, heavy phones."
tech,3adu4q,Sassywhat,1 point,Sat Jun 20 00:58:08 2015 UTC,"The size factor is a fair point. Simply from my friends and my experience people are starting to treat phones more of a replacement for phones and tablets. In that sense the push to have smaller lighter phones isn't as big of a deal. I can even use it to replace 90% of what I do on a laptop. If I have a phone that can replace my laptop and tablet use, and it can configure it however I want... then having one that is slightly heavier and bulkier than a standard phone is not a big issue."

Every node has to be able to take a battery or a cpu etc... This creates huge inefficiency's in the hardware.  For instance the bus the connects the cpu to the gpu and the bus that connects the memory to the cpu all require a lot of circuit board space and power. By having to have 4-6 times the amount of these they are going to have to be much slower and simpler. Also the interconnects will not be upgradeable creating new bottlenecks even if you ignore the efficiency issues.  A lot of the power saving ability's and techniques that modern phones employ rely on the sharing of resources and rely on close physical proximity. You can gain a great deal of efficiency by putting the cpu, memory and gpu all on the same die, it reduces communication overhead, improves speed and improves battery life.  This will be cool for things like cameras and storage however, kinda like how compact flash was used in the windows mobile 5 days. You could add cameras, wifi, infrared, storage etc all though compact flash slots."

(replaceable hdd and ram doesn't count) or tablet for that matter?  smartphones are a premium product and will continue to improve rapidly and won't slow down for a while.  for example, Samsung Galaxy 3 is released in 2012 and have 267 passmark rating and Samsung Galaxy S6 is released 2 months ago and have 7,623 passmark rating  in just 3 years, 29x the performance.  in comparison with PC cpu, first generation i5 to recent generation, in 5 years apart only 2x performance gain.  so desktop are pretty much mature and just focusing on performance per watt improvement while smartphones are doing catch up. so with this legophone, you will never get the latest performance due to the design and the obsession for thinness.  so it will fail big time because people are dumb and won't realize the truth. just look at ouya for example. omg so cool idea then pffbt crash n burn.  nothing wrong using a $100 prepaid android phone for communication, a laptop for serious work, and a DSLR for media."
tech,3adu4q,nonameowns,7,Fri Jun 19 18:54:51 2015 UTC,"There is no reason every module and the back plate couldn't be completely waterproof (to the same level my S5 is: completely submergeable). Surely they have considered the drop problem already as well. If your phone shuts off because it has popped into 10 pieces, you put it back together and turn it on.  Also, someone is messing with that ""Samsung Galaxy 3"" mark. It has 5 samples, the wrong processor, wrong cores, wrong amount of ram and wrong name for any Samsung phone on the market when the ""Galaxy S III"" came out. The S3 is ranging from 1824 for the 2 core, 1.5GB ram version (which seems to be gamed down to that ranking) to 2589 for the 4 core 1.75GB ram version with the most commonly ranked 4 core 0.75GB ram version scoring 2248.  So I'd say the performance improvement is around 4x depending on how you compare it to the S6.    Similarly the PC ratings are being somewhat gamed as that first processor is prior to the i5 models gaining on die GPUs. A significant portion of the transistor count of the later i5 is the graphics card (and being gimped otherwise for apparently marketing reasons; the i5 models without the GPU compare on passmark similarly to those with GPU even though they have entire execution units disabled). I am not sure what processors you should be comparing to get a sample indicative of the performance improvement over the 5 year range. Perhaps their enthusiast line hasn't been messed with on the benchmark site or by intel marketing as much:  https://www.cpubenchmark.net/compare.php?cmp[]=841&cmp[]=2332  compares the i7-975 extreme edition with the i7 5960X enthusiast chip for an improvement of 2.5x over 5 years.    edit:  I'm not saying the phones aren't improving faster than desktops right now (though I suspect a whole system benchmark would probably find that the desktops are moving at least as fast per price point; there doesn't seem to be a stable mark for whole systems on the desktop side).   I think the phone chips are improving at roughly the same speed as desktop chips. The phone marks are probably being amplified by similar improvements to memory improvements and bus improvements. Neither of those are taken into account on the desktop side."

Conspiracies are absurd; this sounds conspirational; therefore it is absurd. You could discount anything by comparing it to conspiracy. You would have easily been able to do that with activities of the NSA for example.  So if you want to effectively refute this point, demonstrate that the military budget does not put a lot of money in private companies or that legislators cannot be shareholders in those companies.

What is not true, and therefore conspiracy, is that giving money to these private companies is the primary ""objective"" of the project. I fully believe that the objective was to make a better radio system. It was mismanaged and failed. The second truth, and harder to believe than the conspiracy (which is why we believe the conspiracy), is that the government is so terribly inefficient and mismanaged that it trips over its own feet and bleeds money in the process. I've seen my boss in the National Park Service spend $6,000 buying 10 ipads for 4th graders to take notes on in an ecology class because if she didn't spend the money within the next week, she wouldn't get as much money in her budget next year. I saw the Air National Guard spend $210,000 on a temporary parking lot for us to park our cars on the other side of the fence so that we couldn't get to our cars during the military exercise. They forgot that stone can get sucked into jet engines (they put the stone on the runway side of the fence), so the  day after they laid the gravel, they removed it with bulldozers. So, $210,000 of  taxpayer money used for a one-day parking lot. There wasn't a corrupt politician working for the gravel industry trying to funnel money towards his business. It happened because people are stupid.

One of the webs best features has been its openness and the ability for people to see, and even change the code that's being sent to them.

This is still just as cross-platform, cross-browser as javascript. Unless vendors come up with proprietary extensions (like microsoft with VBScript) it's not really any more locked-in than javascript.   with sneaky things they couldn't have of with client side source execution.   Like what? JavaScript is already basically the assembly of the web, see e.g. ASM.js.   I think we'll see things like media players, office suites, and other webapps distributed to browsers as non-free blobs   We already have all of those things. There is no reason to think javascript distributed to your web-browser is somehow in any way less non-free than assembly code.   the user won't be able to determine what the software is communicating/doing.   The user will still be able to use e.g. the chrome dev tools et al to monitor network traffic. A user who is not aware of how to code or use the dev-tools will still be as clueless as before. A user who can code but isn't proficient in WebAssembly will still be as clueless as before, when looking at a stacktrace of a 100 000 lines-of-code javascript app that was minified into a single line. So not much change here.   One of the webs best features has been its openness and the ability for people to see, and even change the code that's being sent to them. I suppose things like YouTube options, Social Fixer for Facebook, and maybe even ad blocking will become less viable, as sites institute opaque and unfriendly behaviour with unviewable software.   This won't impact any of those things. The web is already as un-open as it could be, changing the representation of the code you're executing does not change much in that regard. You can still see and change the code that's being sent to you, using WebAssembly doesn't somehow magically make the code invisible or un-editable. Blocking happens at a domaine/request level, so that will be entirely unaffected.   Maybe I'm being quite tinfoil hat about this   We should be critical about things like these, but I think you're having some slightly mythical impressions about how having assembly code instead of javascript will impact our ability to see, modify and interact with the code, and about how open the web is right now (it's not any more open than executing a .exe file Adobe or Microsoft gives you). Esp. since once this becomes a standard, developer-tools will be made to deal with this as conveniently as we currently deal with javascript."

That is, untrusted blobs everywhere with constant ""pfft, of course you can trust our software; just don't upset when you find out we harvest your data and have backdoors into it"" gotchas.  My other big concern regarding browser extensions and ad blocking is that they could be affected. Of course nothing has happened yet, so I'll say straight up I could absolutely be wrong about how this plays out. However, like I said, the cynical part of me sees the big corporations (ie Google) using overly complex, pure binary blobs to enforce that add's don't get blocked. From what I understand, detecting when adds are blocked is very simple, even with today's JavaScript. If Google threw a kill switch in the YouTube player if it detected add's being blocked, there'd be a public outrage because of the purely contrived, profit focused motives, and people would track down the javascript and be able to point to why and make a fix for it within hours. Similar behaviour could be implemented in a binary blob, but tracking down how it does it will be much harder, and they'll just blurt PR stuff like, 'Disable ad blocking for an optimal experience and so the video player works'. Combine that with a Microsoft-esque 'We'll sue you if you disassemble the code' clause, and your got a much less friendly future web ecosystem."

Also there are plans to include a text format for viewing the code.  https://github.com/WebAssembly/design/blob/master/FAQ.md   Will WebAssembly support View Source on the Web?  Yes! WebAssembly defines a text format to be rendered when developers view the source of a WebAssembly module in any developer tool. Also, a specific goal of the text format is to allow developers to write WebAssembly modules by hand for testing, experimenting, optimizing, learning and teaching purposes. In fact, by dropping all the coercions required by asm.js validation, the WebAssembly text format should be much more natural to read and write than asm.js. Outside the browser, command-line and online tools that convert between text and binary will also be made readily available. Lastly, a scalable form of source maps is also being considered as part of the WebAssembly tooling story."

This is exactly what the web already is? Do you think you can just rip a piece of javascript code out of one side and put it into another, or re-use their widget or UI library?   That is, untrusted blobs everywhere with constant ""pfft, of course you can trust our software; just don't upset when you find out we harvest your data and have backdoors into it"" gotchas.   You don't have to trust the blobs any more or less than any arbitrary javascript code you might be running right now. Javascript code on websites is already perfectly capable of harvesting your data and having ""backdoors"". WebAssembly will be just as sandboxed as javascript is, so anything WebAssembly can do, you can already do in javascript.   using overly complex, pure binary blobs to enforce that add's don't get blocked.   I don't see how binary blobs help in that regard... Some websites have already deployed anti-ad-blockers, and ad-blockers don't really do anything against this. If adblockers were to start doing something against it, WebAssembly will probably not make it significantly harder...   people would track down the javascript and be able to point to why and make a fix for it within hours.   Well, that doesn't change with WebAssembly. You seem to think that assembly code is somehow magical and can neither be seen, understood or manipulated? It's simply a slightly more broken-down version of what the javascript can already do, you can step through it with a debugger and set breakpoints just like you can with javascript right now.

Even then, people who want to obfuscate always will This does not make the situation worse than it already is. If anything, maybe it makes it a bit better, because instead of unmanagable minified JS, we then have a canonical form to look at and create developer tools (e.g. decompilers) against.

A user who can code but isn't proficient in WebAssembly will still be as clueless as before, when looking at a stacktrace of a 100 000 lines-of-code javascript app that was minified into a single line. So not much change here.   There is a huge difference between minified code, obfuscated code and compiled binaries. The first two are still relatively easy to use. You can just run minifide code through any editor that can automatically format the code and you're fine. Obfuscated code can be deobfuscated and again, formatted.  Compiled binary however will have very different structure to the original source code. You could get unfolded loop, substituted constants, whatever.

tech,3aa2he,Zulban,7,Fri Jun 19 00:00:47 2015 UTC,"You can try it yourself. I went for an extreme (though somewhat common) use case: bootstrap and jQuery. Why? Because they already provide very well ""optimized"" minified version as well as the original source code, and they are very common on the web.  I put them all into a tar file as if they were all catenated (which is what you should have), and then just compared the minified, non-minified versions with their compressed counterparts:     plaintext compressed    regular 520KB 113KB   minified 278KB 61KB    I guess my conclusion is that there is a difference, and it's not as insignificant as I thought it would be, but you save like 50KBs on this gigantic codebase (that has plenty of comments inside). And that is probably like half the size of the image you use as a logo for the website. So I guess it does make sense for libraries that you (or nobody, really) ever need to read (from your website's source code), there is no need to do that for a few-hundred lines-long scripts (i.e. the scripts you write yourself to suit the website).    Edit: I also went through a few of my websites, and the CSS usually has about 15 to 20 KBs on average while JS has about 10KBs. That's, say, 30KBs worth of data (none of it is minified). You can compress all that to about 1/4 to 1/3 of the original sized (this is based on the actual transmitted data, so it uses the server's compression).  So you have like 10KBs of data. Even if we assume the same case as with Bootstrap and such, you would get at best around 6KBs when minified instead of 10 (which is not even the case here as I have no comments in my files and use shorter, less descriptive variable and class names and such). And I'd say 4KBs is negligible on the web.  If I did not have server compression it would be entirely different (and much worse in that respect) and minification wouldn't help much either."

You could even argue that as it becomes more and more viable to run things client-side (due to the speedup) more and more of the code will be running in a place where you at least have a chance to decompile and fiddle with it. But the main point is that the good old days - where the 'openness' of the web meant that you could just ""right-click->view source"" and you'd know all about how that website works - they disappeared long ago as web-sites were replaced by web-apps. It's not all doom and gloom though - the web has thriving open-source communities that make it way more easy to figure out how to do something than ""view source"" ever was in the late 90s and early noughts."

Actually, no. If you compare it to something like, say, the C compiler, it's very different.  Minifying just decreases file size and renames stuff into barely-comprehensible strings. You can deal with that by just automatically formatting it and refactoring if you really feel like doing that. And the code is still very well readable.  Obfuscation is, well, obfuscation. It can usually be fairly easily deobfuscated, and it takes away part of performance which is one of the reasons it's not used very much.  Compilation, however, is much worse. Suddenly every single script is automatically obfuscated (which in this case improves speed however). Any decent compiler will make optimizations. It will fix programmers' mistakes. It will remove extra code and just generally turn it into something completly different from what the programmer had written. Much harder to assemble back and get some meaning form it."

If you look at the lua c API or e.g. the V8 (javascript engine) C++ API, they are much better designed and don't really have these problems.  And then CPython of course has the GIL issue and doesn't really perform very well in general. PyPy at least performs better, but still has the GIL and the CPython API issues. Realistically both of these need to be 100% ironed out if we want to deploy something like this large-scale on browsers in e.g. smartphones, tablets, ...

tech,3aa2he,Ikinoki,5,Thu Jun 18 21:58:19 2015 UTC,"Read and mess around with the CPython API, and you will quickly notice. See for instance the PyRun_SimpleString(""... string of python code ..."") function, or the PyImport_Import(...) functions don't take a ""VM"" or ""interpreter_state"" object of any kind (unlike for instance their Lua counterparts, luaL_loadbuffer(lua_State *L, ...)), meaning there can basically only ever one python VM be alive in one process at any given time (barring ""sub-interpreters"" which CPython supports, but these are useless for this purpose.) Since the python VM does not expect to ever be run alongside another python VM, there is subsequently also no strategy for how to sensibly move data between two instances of the VM. Luas API for instance solves this by always enforcing you to make a copy (which is not the most performance-friendly, but makes the API very simple and impossible to mis-use) and other APIs (e.g. spidermonkey for JS) give you a way to ""uproot"" a datastructure and ""pin"" it in the GC, so that you can then re-insert it into a second VM, without having the garbage-collector of the first VM garbage-collect or otherwise do funky stuff with your datastructure mid-flight (which is more error-prone to use but allows you to very efficiently move large amounts of data between VMs).  The GIL is not really ""fixed"" by multiprocessing, eventlets or greenlets anymore than global warming is fixed by throwing truckloads of icecubes into the ocean (although python fanatics will routinely try to make you believe otherwise). SMT comes the closest to being a real solution (and something like that might be acceptable for the browser, as WebWorker semantics already have a pretty restricted model of parallel execution) but I don't know enough about how SMT with PyPy works to really confirm that."

I know reddit uses AWS somewhat but not the details. If they used Amazon Elastic Load Balancers for example, it's basically as simple as uploading a certificate and activating a listener on port 443. And probably running a skeleton website on 80 that just redirects to 443. (Not knowing anything I sort of assume reddit uses their own HAProxy or F5 or somesuch instances. The Amazon ELBs are pretty simplistic.)  If they use cloudfront and if they support older browsers (pre-SNI support) it can get more expensive.  Also I assume all the mobile reddit apps have to be properly updated to support SSL?  So TLDR usually it's not a big deal but for huge sites like reddit, FB, etc it can be more involved."

This is a contentious issue in the security community because SHA-1 at the present moment can't be easily be broken but may be easily broken in the coming years. For legacy support, many old clients don't support SHA-2. Google has announced that it will be deprecating SHA-1, at the present moment Chrome says that the site is using a weak security configuration but in 2017, Chrome will have a big red line through https on sites that use certificates signed by SHA-1.

Security experts have various opinions on Google's actions. Some believe that Google is abusing its market share to bully everyone into using SHA-2 while others are glad that Google is trying to improve internet security. The contentious issue is how Google is approaching this matter by saying that the site uses weak security when at the present moment, it is quite secure. The move to SHA-2 is a forward thinking move by Google, computers at the moment can't break SHA-1 easily but may be able to in a few years time. Many sites don't want to use SHA-2 certificates because SHA-1 is supported by more clients than SHA-2."

If they tried releasing this car at this price point a few years ago, they never would have been able to cover their R&D costs with how few they would sell.  There's a megafactories documentary on youtube about Tesla - its really amazing how much less manufacturing goes into an electric car versus a gasoline one, which equates to lower costs.  Of course the higher end ones are going to be nicer, but Telsa's end game is the average consumer so I would be incredibly surprised if they took a lot out of these."

tech,39y5yw,Jollyx,18,Tue Jun 16 02:22:45 2015 UTC,"Trust me, you do not want a car by a renowned Italian performance luxury car maker at a mass-market price point.  Case in point: the Maserati Biturbo, which rightfully earned its place on Time's ""50 Worst Cars of All Time"" list.   I used to own one, and yes, they are nice cars - beautiful body styling in that subdued, boxy early '80s way, luxury interior with top-tier leather seats and wood dash and door highlights, a great motor with two little tiny turbos attached for awesome acceleration (my stock '85 Biturbo easily dumped all over my rich friend's heavily modded '07 Tiburon in short races, though the Tiburon had better top end performance). They also break frequently, annoyingly, and ultimately catastrophically1. They shipped with a full tool set in the trunk - and apparently the expectation that you would need it early and often.  1 The interesting thing here is that the Biturbo long block (the full motor including valve train), on its own, is actually wonderful - it's the one part of the car that Maserati did live up to its name on. It's durable, well-engineered, and willing to take a lot more boost than the tiny stock turbos deliver. It's just that all of the other parts in the engine bay were shit. My car died of a coolant pipe rupture that I didn't immediately notice, followed by engine damage due to heat that I was never able to fix."

They are also assuming higher volumes, which will drive prices down further, and with Musk's superfactory, some of those costs are going to get amortized by other car makers that end up using the same batteries.  However, even as a huge Tesla fan, I'll only believe that $35k price when I see it.  That's going to be on a stripped version that you'll never see on any dealer lot.

Edit: and if you charge at a supercharger station, your ""fuel"" is free.  Edit 2: the real costs of charging a Tesla are based on the price of electricity where you charge it.

Warranty only covers if anything goes wrong, you have to keep the maintenance plan for normal wear/tear.  All these people saying ""no maintenance cost"" don't have a clue.  The math has been covered hundreds of times....  it would take decades to make your money back on fuel costs with the S.  It will probably take 5+ years with the Model 3.  If you happen to have a battery failure outside warranty after that the costs can easily be over $5,000 (estimated $10,000 for the S).  That is FAR more than replacing the entire engine on a gas car.  The average person will do just as well, or better, buying a used fuel efficient car than buying a Model 3."

Surprisingly, those of us who put less miles on our cars each year are less likely to reach a break even point with an electric car.

At that point, after 5 years, they would have only spent a total of ~$45,000 on the car.   So over the span of 5 years, the total investment into the car is only ~40% of the initial price.  Therefore, hopefully we can expect the Model 3 to be ~$14,000 after 5 years.  Edit: Grammar and formatting."

Maybe less since the Model 3 will have a smaller battery pack and might charge faster. Best thing is to plan a charging stop around a meal, which is why Tesla is putting most of their charging stations near shopping centers and restaurants."
tech,39y5yw,StetsonG,3,Tue Jun 16 02:34:16 2015 UTC,"If Tesla could get deals with the shopping centers where they have stations, they could even have cars drive themselves to the station after dropping you off at the front of the restaurant you wanted to go to, with liability on Tesla. Especially since, if you're going at parking lot speeds, collisions aren't going to cause very much damage."
tech,39y5yw,Bobshayd,5,Tue Jun 16 02:44:13 2015 UTC,"However, it'd definitely be an incredibly difficult place to be a market leader in that. While collisions against other cars would be cheap at best, people are another story- you have no means of seeing them around nearby obstacles, they can come into/out of tight spaces, sometimes even faster than a car at parking lot speeds, and even a small amount of damage can cause significant harm(for example, on a 4 year old).  It's a nightmare scenario, worse than any road-driving circumstance(since cars can't just instantly move laterally). I'm sure someone will get it right in the next few years, but I don't see this being something Tesla tackles soon."

I wasn't thinking about the wearables like smartwatches or fitness trackers. I was thinking about laptops and smart phones.   To answer your question again, I would go for an argumentation based on some good life ethics rather than utilitarian arguments. As a person you would want to be healthy, be fit, be of sharp mind (at least I want that). If my employer offers me ways to track my own fitness because they have a benefit for me being the best I can be than I would accept that.  However if my employer would make choices based on my fitness stats instead of my actual work output than I would rather not be tracked. It might well be that I do my best writing when stressed or even tired. I don't believe we can generalise these stats across a work force.  Still I remain at my previous statement.

Then you can go to companies like Foxconn or Quanta and tell them to build exactly the gear you need based on those open specs.  http://www.opencompute.org/about/  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Compute_Project  Facebook started the initiative but now Microsoft, Dell, HP, Intel or Rackspace are onboard as well (some more or less forced to stay relevant). As stated in the article, the financial industry has embraced it as well, very quickly and very strongly.  Of course it makes more sense if you're operating a very large company where owning its own fine-tuned infrastructure gives a competitive edge."
tech,39x9m5,chubbysumo,2,Mon Jun 15 22:47:26 2015 UTC,"Google and Facebook have been making their own hardware for years, because they get to pick what they need feature wise, and pay the right price for it.  This does not filter down farther though, as you have to be ordering a boatload of hardware for this kind of thing to even be an option.  If I went to Foxconn and asked them to make a single unit of something for me, with my desired features, it would not even be in a reasonable pricerange.  This only works well(custom hardware) when you order a lot and need specific features that makers are not providing(dell, HP, IBM, ect).  Its the reason that Google went to their own custom made server in the first place, because Dell and HP did not have what they needed or wanted, nor at a price that was reasonable."

tech,39tdjv,2_dam_hi,12,Sun Jun 14 21:29:49 2015 UTC,"This design has been out there for 3 years now and I'm looking forward to trying it. But none of the other headset companies have focused on this yet for a reason. They are working to perfect the first generation.   Higher FOV is part of the puzzle. But cost,  ergonomics, motion to photon latency and software ecosystem are also important. And it takes time to develop those.   Before StarVR catches up on those areas, you can already enjoy a couple of years in the Rift consumer version."
tech,39tdjv,alsomahler,6,Sun Jun 14 23:09:39 2015 UTC,"I will wait, Valve+HTC's one looks pretty good too.   Basically I'm going to buy the first VR with a good sensor package (detecting the hands and feet position and nearby objects is a must) and >2K pixel density."
tech,39tdjv,Arcosim,26,Mon Jun 15 01:02:12 2015 UTC,"Wow 210 is insane, the vertical FOV is much higher than other headsets too. It'll pretty much be the same as your natural real liffe FOV, i can't imagine how amazing it would be to wear one. You'd get so drawn into it.

tech,39tdjv,TeutorixAleria,23,Sun Jun 14 20:50:26 2015 UTC,"to add to this, your peripheral vision doesn't need to be super high resolution at all.  games should be able to scale peripheral vision areas much the same way draw distance works in traditional games."

So it could only draw low-res peripheral vision if it were to assume you've got your eyes dead straight constantly. The moment you look in one direction by moving your eyes, that part of your vision is no longer your peripheral vision."
tech,39tdjv,feelix,4,Sun Jun 14 22:54:09 2015 UTC,"Eye tracking is doable. Not sure if they or anyone else would want to bother integrating it, but it's certainly within the realm of possibility."
tech,39tdjv,topazsparrow,5,Sun Jun 14 23:10:16 2015 UTC,Of course it's doable. It's not being implemented in this version though so yes you need a powerful ass computer or you need to run with low setting. More likely both.
tech,39tdjv,10GuyIsDrunk,5,Sun Jun 14 23:41:34 2015 UTC,Another vr tech is going to try to use eye tracking to only render the area in sight at higher res. The eye tracking needs to be very good to be useful and not actually cause more performance problems.
tech,39tdjv,voiderest,4,Sun Jun 14 23:45:24 2015 UTC,Not only that but I would think that our eyes don't move in smooth lines but dart around. The response time would have to be so low....
tech,39tdjv,Boredom_rage,3,Mon Jun 15 01:46:41 2015 UTC,"Maybe not. Our brains fill in what we see when our eye moves, which is why the tick of a clock when you glance at the second hand seems to take longer than you would expect. Ie: the hand moved as you glanced at it already , but your brain misses it because you just finished moving your eyes.  I bet you can cash in on that during rendering time. Just so long as you've given the eye something of similar composition to look at, and fill it in with higher detail in the meantime.  Given that blinking takes 200ms+, so long as you can beat that, I have a good feeling that this will be a winning strategy.  Also, game/api developers could pre-empt where the eye is moving to and bring up the detail in that location for 5or6 frames ""just in case"" the player glances there.  I feel there are rocky days ahead, but I don't think it's insurmountable."

tech,39tdjv,johnt1987,4,Mon Jun 15 02:07:25 2015 UTC,"You have to dual render. It's basically equivalent to creating a split screen experience in terms of extra load. It's a 5120×1440 screen (when combined). That's 3.5 more pixels that a 1080p screen. It's basically a 4K monitor (7% different).  Side note: Them calling this a 5K display is super sneaky.   Both of those combined make it quite a lot harder to hit high refresh rates. Especially as this will require dual DisplayPort cables if they want to actually hit the high refresh rates (so now it's two monitors on your display card so you get problems there), as one cable can only deal with 60Hz at 4K resolutions.  While it might still be possible to push some games (on lower quality) to high refresh rates it will be much more difficult than you make it out to be (4K is so large!).  All that being said, games optimized for VR should be able to cater for this. But say goodbye to porting something like Skyrim over (which has been done to an extent already) and getting it to run well (even on low settings).    But anyway, all the above is completely irrelevant. I don't think there are any 1440p low persistent >60Hz displays out there. All of those are things I see as pretty vital, but we'll see when it gets some testing later. If they have a 90Hz, low persistent display and this is shown to work well I'll be following this with major interest. Right now I just don't trust the claims.  It's a wait and see thing though."

tech,39tdjv,TalenPhillips,-6,Mon Jun 15 08:09:31 2015 UTC,You'd probably need at least two 980s to run any new game at 144fps on acceptable settings. I've got an OCd 970 and the newest game I can run at 144 and decent settings is League of Legends and that runs on anything.
tech,39tdjv,Mister_Alucard,4,Sun Jun 14 21:03:39 2015 UTC,And this vr headset doesn't require 144hz I was just giving an example.   You only need 90 which should be attainable in a lot of games at reduced settings.
tech,39tdjv,TeutorixAleria,-1,Sun Jun 14 21:12:28 2015 UTC,"Well that's good. It'd be nice if this whole VR movement pushes more devs to take a more 'less detail, more aesthetic' route in their visual design since it'd be easier for machines to run."

tech,39tdjv,Ozqo,1 point,Mon Jun 15 16:29:17 2015 UTC,no but do you have any idea how hard it is to run a modern game at medium with the resolution required for VR at 90Hz consistently? This is not going to be remotely accessible for the average gamer for at least 3 generations.
tech,39tdjv,Snoopsta_g,2,Mon Jun 15 17:46:47 2015 UTC,"Even if you turn the detail down it's still hard to run a game at this resolution. It's 4x the resolution of 1080p, so it's like running a game on 4 1080p monitors(at full res) at once. It's still gonna be really intensive even if you turn all the other settings down. Turning the resolution down isn't much of an option with VR because it has way too much of a negative effect."

tech,39lcmf,eliasv,5,Fri Jun 12 23:09:33 2015 UTC,"Legal expert? No. Some experience in the area due to work? Yes. Not loads, but enough to have a basic handle on this stuff.  Basically, my understanding is this:   It is legal to block content (by domain, content, IP address, etc.) Apple is providing others the means to write blocking software, but is not writing specific software to block specific content. All iOS apps are allowed to feature advertising and if you want to advertise, iAds is not your only option for advertising. You are allowed to sell spots in your app for advertising or use 3rd party advertising solutions. These same rules apply for providing content for the News app. You can use iAds, but you are also allowed to sell your own ads or use a 3rd party advertising solution.   Apple is not preventing people from advertising in iOS.   They're providing others the means to write content blocking software for a mobile browser, which will inevitably end up as an advertising blocker. The same means provided could also allow software that blocks adult content or other forms of content that users may want to be blocked.  As far as I'm aware, they aren't selling ads below market value to gain a monopsony, they aren't preventing others from selling ads on the platform, they aren't price fixing ads with other ad vendors, nor anything along those lines. They aren't even preventing others from selling advertising that will appear in the new App, so they won't have a monopoly there.  Apple are not monopolising advertising on mobile platforms. There are plenty of ways for people to advertise on iOS devices and other mobile devices. They aren't writing any software that directly interferes with other people's advertising."

So many lost their jobs when trucking companies had to cut back or truckers were caught driving over their time limit and put on a 72 hour hold by state patrol. The amount earned went way down.  you used to be able to earn $100k as an average.  Now you are lucky if you get 50K per year.  The most a trucking company can pay you for legally is 70 hours per 8 days, or however many miles you can go in those 70 hours.  If you average speed, however, exceeds around 50mph, you usually get reprimanded, since that means you are speeding, which makes the companies insurance go up.  Most truckers have a hard time getting 3000 miles per week now, and most companies now pay less than $0.30 per mile for everyone, so at most, you will be earning around $800 per week, working 70 hours over an 8 day period with your 2 day rest in there."

The only people who earn less are migrant workers who Tim Hortans or McDonalds has to ship over from the Philippines on prearranged contracts - even they get up over $14 an hour in no time (of course the Canadian government banned these arrangements).  The point is that businesses already pay more than the minimum age by a huge margin. Alberta is the highest earning, least expensive province in the country.

You earn a percentage more, but you spend that equal percentage more as well.  Wage increases don't come from thin air, companies want to keep their profit margins, which means that a wage increase to their workforce means that they will raise the cost of services and products.  This happens all the way along the product and service chain as well, which means costs go up even higher.  Raising minimum wage is not a fix for poverty, it never was.  Its a ""feel good"" action to fool people into thinking they are doing better, when they are not.  The economy in North america is going to collapse in the next 10 years, and its going to be violent and ugly.  The FED is pumping out USD, driving inflation up for everyone(yes, including canada), driving the cost of living up even more, and raising minimum wage only compounds the problem."

tech,39l6ka,zdk,-2,Sat Jun 13 01:57:35 2015 UTC,"It's a complicated issue   its not complicated actually.  Money does not grow on trees.  If you pay your workers more, your costs as a company go up.  You keep your profit margins the same, which means you raise the cost of your products or services to pay for that increase in wage.  Look at McDonalds.  When the federal wage went up, it went from a ""dollar"" menu to a $1.30 menu.  That was a direct result of wage increases.  Companies want to keep their bottom line the same, which means they are not going to take a hit in profits to pay more in wages.  Minimum wage raises make those of us who are already earning more than that go backwards, and it does not increase the buying power of the poor.  I run a business, and manage a store.  If my costs go up in wages, the costs of my services go up to cover that, because my bottom line profits will remain the same.     Raising minimum wage therefore increases the purchasing power of the poor relative to society   This is the strawman.  Your entire example relies on a company not wanting to keep its profit margins.  Thats not how a company works.  I have seen 4 minimum wage increases, and the only thing they do is drive the cost of everyday items up."

What they call the innovation here is the rotating magnetic field which serves as a clock: they use the magnetic field to push the droplets to pre-polarized electrodes. This becomes obsolete at the micro-scale (where they want to be in the future as they say) because the electromagnetic force between two pre-polarized electrode pads is strong enough to move the droplet at small dimensions without the suport of such a magnetic field.

tech,399aoe,ozrainmaker,8,Wed Jun 10 04:35:35 2015 UTC,"I worked as a sys admin at a startup from 2006-2010. Right in the window Apple released the iPhone.   Before that the company was all Blackberry. All new hired employees received a Blackberry on day one. It was that good of a product that the company switched from Sendmail to Exchange, just so we could use Blackberrys.   What some people don't realize is that Blackberry in the enterprise often times required the Blackberry Exchange Server (BES) software installed and running. This was the glue to bind the corporate Blackberrys to our Exchange servers.   The big problem we had with Blackberrys was that we were still dependent on all Blackberry traffic to go through the Blackberry servers in Waterloo. If those servers weren't working, people weren't getting mail or other services to their phone. If you Google around, you'll find some global Blackberry outages a few times near 2010.   The other problem was, every Blackberry we added needed a license on that server. We were tied to AT&T and when we needed more licenses for our BES, we had to call the AT&T business line and buy more. Huge pain in the ass.   iPhone comes along initially and doesn't really support Exchange out of the box. Not really the most secured platform either because nobody has really tested it for how safe it was. Blackberry still had remote wipe and policy at the time, so still no brained out the gate to continue using Blackberry.   Flash forward to iOS 3 or 4, and one of the new iPhones with it, Exchange and ActiveSync supported and the phone had encryption our security team deemed worthy of using.   We then made it an option for people when getting hired. Blackberry or iPhone.   Over the course of two years, more demand grew for iPhones. We even had a program at one point where employees who didn't want to wait two years for a company laid upgrade could have pay deducted from their phone and could upgrade early to the iPhone if they didn't want to wait.   I guess my overall point from the business IT side of the downfall of Blackberry is, Blackberry had too many variables in their chain of how their product worked. Apple took the road of implementing an already existing technology and licensed it for their phones. It was a no brainier for us when it became lower cost over time. Not only that, one less service to maintain.   As a consumer, I've never owned a Blackberry, so I could never tell you what it was like."
tech,399aoe,dmareddit,3,Wed Jun 10 13:07:15 2015 UTC,"I also managed a BES server, I was so glad when we got rid of it eventually. My employer stopped issuing cell phones for tax reasons a few years back so we didn't support Blackberry anymore. When I was in charge of our Verizon account, the only business friendly phones Verizon offered at the time were Blackberry and Windows Mobile 6.5 or whatever it was. Blackberry had an advantage over the Windows phone IMO but the BES was horrible and syncing seemed to take a while. We dumped phones before Android started becoming a thing and before Verizon got the iPhone. I remember I had a Blackberry Storm through work and I hated it so much. I hated the clicky screen, it seemed sluggish and crashed on me a lot. I also had a personal iPhone at the time because I had an AT&T account when I started at my work and didn't want to switch over to the company Verizon account. Having both an iPhone and Blackberry at the time, the iPhone just seemed to flawlessly integrate with Exchange. I only used the Blackberry for company calls and demo pretty much to employees interested in the Storm."

Probably my favorite email device over the years wasn't even a BB, but a GoodLink G100. It had a command line interface which allowed you to cache the last week of emails on a newly provisioned device (which was a big deal as an admin). BB sued them out of the hardware business.

In this game you need to collaborate to prevent an impending catastrophe (meteor hitting the earth), and thus to survive you need to develop an economy, governance, and technology to prevent it.  The game is really focused on collaboration and using resources efficiently and making decisions as a group using laws. On top of that, the resources you're using come from a simulated ecosystem which is affected by what you do, and you can cause your early demise if you don't take that into account. The game is first and foremost a game for players of games.  We're not targeting an 'educational audience', we're making a game that we want to play, and we're making it so that it has value beyond just entertainment.  The Department of Education recognizes the value of that, which is why they funded our grant application. The goal of the game is not to 'protect the environment', the goal is to build a civilization capable of protecting itself from disaster, and indeed there is no way to do that without taking resources from and damaging the environment.  This is not a game that preaches to you about the environment, I hate that stuff and it's counter productive anyway.  It embraces the complexity of the situation.   Check us out on Greenlight, we got our page up and will be posting blogs about the game. http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=455323554  Email subscription for updates: http:///www.strangeloopgames.com/eco  Thanks and happy to answer questions about it, -JohnK"

tech,3913y4,batypus,7,Mon Jun 8 17:07:45 2015 UTC,I think the real advantage is being able to go slower than game speed.

tech,3913y4,ssav,3,Mon Jun 8 20:57:19 2015 UTC,"It's useful for reading and evaluating defenses and recognizing who is or will be open and forcing a quicker evaluation and check down.  Does this throw a person's timing off? Potentially. But if the camera is moving at an increased speed the body and brain does a good job of adjusting for these changes. Since they aren't actually throwing the ball, the intuition of when to release should not be affected but if it's damaging or beneficial regarding going from virtual to real, we'll have to wait and see."

It will be a great tool in this regard. What does this player look like when he's running at full speed? This question can be answered and understood in a different way at variable speed."

If you're lucky, someone might even take it as a request and doodle it for free.  To more directly answer your question, when it comes to erotic artwork: yes, especially when it comes to certain artists who have set up paysites or Patreons. Because erotic artwork (parody or not) is rather niche, it's harder to come by, moreso if you're looking for work from a certain artist. On top of that, prolific artists might leave watermarks on their images so if someone gets caught distributing stuff from a paid source, that person's account access is revoked along with getting their credit/debit card info blacklisted.  And then consider how much artwork out there was commissioned to be private. Or just sitting in an artist's sketchbook. There's stuff out there that will never see the light of day."

I really wish someone would set up a porn site with a good tagging system like what various Booru sites did for Japanese porn. They have their own shortcomings too, but being able to do specific tag searches like ""1080p + dp + black_hair + petite"" in a massive database of western pornography would be the holy grail of porn searching.  Empornium have (arguably) the largest porn database in the world and they also use a tagging system, but they don't specify the subjects of sexual acts or anything like that. Good luck finding a scene where a specific actress gets both spitroasted and dp'd, all you'll get is a metric shitton of megapacks and full DVDs with multiple actors and no idea who those tags apply to. Someone suggested they fix this by specifying subjects for tags but it got shot down because ""uploaders have enough to do already"" (ironically, adding tags to uploads isn't even required, and everyone can add tags, not just uploaders).

tech,392430,alteraccount,4,Tue Jun 9 00:45:17 2015 UTC,"Modern languages are typically composed of (at least) two major parts: a compiler (gobbles files in the language syntax, produces machine code) or interpreter (in the case of scripting languages), and a standard library (a set of “built-in” functions that you can assume will be available on all compliant language implementations, without having to hook into other libraries which are not guaranteed to be available on all machines).  Most modern languages also typically have a “reference” implementation, written by the creator(s) of the language. Sometimes, they also have other implementations too. For example, for Python there is CPython (which is the reference implementation, for which the core interpreter is written in C), Jython (written in Java: runs Python scripts on the JVM), IronPython (writte in C#), and PyPy (basically an almost self-hosted Python). Not all languages have a reference implementation (for example, C and C++ don't, although typically each platform has an implementation which is considered the de facto standard on that platform).  Every[1] language can have an open source implementation (of the compiler and the standard library). But typically, a language is considered open source when its reference implementations of the compiler and of the standard library are open source.

It's an Apple-centric development language and now it's possible for other people to make it work elsewhere, but... why would they bother? There's no big selling point.  What this DOES give developers is access to the source of the libraries and so on, which can help them identify bugs (and potentially fix them).   So the message ""hey developers, you can now work for free to improve and extend our walled-garden language"" is... <shrug> fine. But not exciting.  (Edit: And yes, I realize you were talking about anti-Apple hate. But I meant that as a platform-agnostic developer, the news is... yawn.

tech,392430,dhicock,6,Mon Jun 8 21:59:34 2015 UTC,"Fundamentally it isn't, but like everything in life, timing (and market share) is critical. If you'll allow me to ignore a ton of details (like MS's stupid patent threats, Sun's posturing, and so on) and generalize heavily, Microsoft's offering had three things going for it:    It had market share: Windows programming was still a big deal so people were learning it just to make Windows programs. It had sexiness: it was positioned as a more-fun version of Java, and Java was not at all sexy. And it had good timing: people were searching for multi-platform solutions at the time. So people were porting .NET even before Microsoft gave their official permission.   Swift doesn't have any of these things. Swift isn't even the language most programmers use to make iOS apps! (That'd be Objective C, a different Apple-centric language). So they certainly don't have lots of already-trained programmers chomping at the bit. And the world is just not currently crying out for a new programming language.  If we DID need a new language, we'd have a ton of options these days. Google's new language, called ""Go"", is very cool. And nobody seems to be using it.  I certainly don't dislike having more options, and maybe some day Swift will be seen as the ""fun"" version of Python. (Speaking broadly, Swift is more like Python than it is like C#.) But... probably not. Not due to anything about the language, just the timing and positioning won't work out."

I don't see this as a bad move or bad timing or anything.   They aren't hoping to be the dominant language. If they get 1% extra market share, that's 1% they didn't have before. This move allows swift to be reviewed and scrutinized, and more eyes can make more secure code. I truly don't see any negatives to this move, just like with Microsoft.   If it doesn't take off, so what? They got free code reviews and possibly more devs! What's not to like?"

In other words, why is this /r/tech-worthy? And the answer is that it's really not. Swift is a new language, and new languages are usually open-source. So this is really just fixing a flaw in their initial release last year.  It's good for people using Swift, no doubt about that. But their PR arm is why people are talking about this. People assume it's something big, like C#'s open-source-ification was, and it's not. I don't mean to imply it's bad. Just uninteresting."

They need a contour controlled by press of button to let warm liquid go into room and in case it's summer - go outside to cool down with a cooler outside.

tech,38xan5,thegerbilofdoom,2,Mon Jun 8 05:25:10 2015 UTC,"Servers or Home system? Those are different.  1u/2u/3u systems are made for free flow (so called air corridor), basically air gets up in front of the rack, goes through the system and sucks in the back to the top to go to chiller. (example http://www.thehotaisle.com/wp-content/fronttoback.png)  This can be optimized by introducing chillers in front of the rack or else-wise. But still the systems are built for high noise.  I've never heard a silent datacenter, even the liquid cooled ones have a lot of noise due to chilling equipment."

I feel like even with it pushing heat outside, you'll still end up having higher power requirements from your AC unit.

They should really do something to measure ambient temperature radiation and offer to pay for the extra cooling required."

No.     I feel like even with it pushing heat outside, you'll still end up having higher power requirements from your AC unit.   You will.  A rack full of servers needs a source of cool air from somewhere.  Being able to ventilate the waste heat outside solves that side of the equation, but you still have the issue of cooling the servers to begin with.  In data center parlance, we call this concept ""hot aisle"" / ""cold aisle"".  The cold air doesn't materialize magically."

tech,38xan5,Gymnocalycium,2,Mon Jun 8 15:19:45 2015 UTC,"Cooling a datacenter is all an exercise in airflow.  You pipe the cold air from air conditioners under the floor, and then open up floor tiles wherever you need cold air.  Then you put similar perforated tiles in the ceiling to capture the hotter return air from the back of the servers.  The return air is sent back through the air conditioners, completing the circuit.  The heat from the entire system is ventilated to the outside the same way it would be in your home, using refrigerant lines that run to a blower somewhere outside the building.    In a datacenter, it's just on a much larger scale.  Look around the back of the building sometime and you'll see a shit ton of outside units ventilating waste heat from the refrigerant lines."
tech,38xan5,Philo_T_Farnsworth,1 point,Mon Jun 8 18:31:58 2015 UTC,Why not just vent the hot air outside and take in fresh air that's (presumably) cooler?
tech,38xan5,cjbentley,2,Mon Jun 8 18:43:56 2015 UTC,"There are a variety of reasons for that.  The biggest one being that it's not always cooler outside, but you also would have a potentially significant problem with humidity if you bring in fresh air.  Air conditioners do more than just cool, they also remove humidity.  You need to control both temperature and humidity in a datacenter environment.  Another factor is if the air is ""cooler"" but not ""cooler enough"", for example say it's 75-80 degrees outside, that air may not have quite enough thermal capacity in it to sufficiently cool the server.  I want to say intake air coming out of an air conditioning vent is usually around something like 45-50 degrees.  If it were 75-80 (i.e. from outside), the fans in the server would have to ramp up to compensate, which sounds like it wouldn't be a big deal, but in the real world when you do that you significantly shorten the life of the server components (not just the fans, the CPU and RAM and whatnot don't particularly like living at those higher temperatures either).    I've worked in a datacenter long enough to see that happen.  You might have a server sitting at the end of a row that doesn't get adequately cooled, sitting there for a long time (years) that fails prematurely.  Also, fans have a maximum speed so if they're running at 100% and you're still getting over temperature alarms, the server has to start shutting down CPUs at some point, or potentially powering off entirely.  Running a commercial server is significantly different than a PC or a laptop.  The environmentals that a consumer type device is comfortable with are engineered to be a lot more variable.  Not to mention your average consumer device has a much shorter lifespan.  A server sitting in a rack in a datacenter might be in there for years, running 24x7."

In the article it says the data is decentralized since the servers are decentralized. It could mean a certain task has many files, and those files get split across many servers, or maybe go as far as you say, have the files themselves get split apart across servers.  The main drawback is time, which was noted in the article a hair. You're adding transmission time between servers which is extremely slow when compared to keeping it under one server. Literally comparing nanoseconds to microseconds.   Another reason depends on the problem being computed, but some files, if large enough, can be logically split up and computed separately then a result spit back and merged with the others. Other problems are very linear and require results from the previous part of the file to progress towards a solution. Splitting a file up like that doesn't really make sense."

That would need servers to be in the same building, it's not something suitable for a high latency lossy network."
tech,38xan5,Mnementh2230,2,Mon Jun 8 03:27:05 2015 UTC,Problem with that is it does need cooler water to keep its own hardware at a safe operating temperature.  Recycling water through the water heater wouldn't do the job.
tech,38xan5,Mnementh2230,2,Mon Jun 8 11:04:57 2015 UTC,"but in the house setup the hot water would be used up and refilled with cold water so the temperature of the water would be regulated that way   Think about it plumbing-wise:  Your water heater keeps a lot of water at the right temperature and only makes room for more water when you're using hot water.  What does your water-heating data furnace do for the 8 hours of the day you're asleep, or while the family is out of the house and not using water?  The water heater is already full, and that data furnace needs to do something with all the heat it's constantly using.  It can't just cycle water through the heater, because that water is hot, and it needs cold water to keep itself operating.  Running hot water through the data furnace is asking for a hardware meltdown."
tech,38xan5,Mnementh2230,2,Mon Jun 8 13:54:35 2015 UTC,"I think you've missed the point that the water in the tank is hot, and it is hot perpetually.  You can't just run that through the data furnace, it needs cold water going through it."
tech,38xan5,Mnementh2230,2,Mon Jun 8 04:54:29 2015 UTC,"The problem is that water cooling systems require a temperature differential to function.  Do you know what temperature most water heaters keep the water at?  120 degrees F at the low end, sometimes as high as 140.  That's not enough heat difference to efficiently cool the hardware:  it'll damage it."
tech,38xan5,hariseldon2,2,Mon Jun 8 12:48:10 2015 UTC,"I'm 100% sure that the hardware will be at least 50 degrees c in one   Yes - with a temperature differential that's sufficiently large on the business end of the cooling mechanism.  Google says they keep their cold aisle at 80 degrees because it's more energy efficient, and keeps the server hardware within its operating temperature (JUST!).  Most server rooms are kept between 65 and 70 degrees, with automatic shutdowns at 80-85 degrees.  Server farms don't as a general rule operate in the open air in the middle of Death Valley, but that's exactly what you'd be subjecting the data furnace to with its cold-return at 120 degrees F or more.  It's not just the ambient temperature, it's the differential that's important here, and that's an important point I don't think you understand.  My last water cooled PC ran at 55 degrees C (I did some overclocking), but the water in the return loop was luke-warm at most (slightly above room temp).  Car engines, for example, operate at scorching hot temperatures.  They're able to do this because the massive radiator up in front of the car gets the coolant fluid chilled to ""reasonably warm"" before it goes back to the engine - the entire loop isn't constantly at crazy-hot!  Edit:  Something else to keep in mind:  many cars will overheat when driving through Death Valley - but the ambient temperature is only 120 degrees, well within the engine's operating temperature.  end edit  The same is true for your computer:  the cold-return needs to be cold!  If cooling your CPU worked as you're describing it, you wouldn't need a radiator for your water-cooling loop at all, but thermodynamics doesn't work that way."

tech,38xg0v,Absay,7,Sun Jun 7 22:05:19 2015 UTC,"In case your comment was serious (I hope not):  Recently, the Automoderator was included as a built-in feature for moderators. It's part of Reddit now. FYI, previous to this decision, the Automoderator used to work as a non-official functionality within the site, it was a user that grabbed the rules it needed to work with from a public wiki page. It's still working kinda in the same way but since it's a mod tool now it makes sense the configuration page remains hidden from public view, the same way the moderator log and the mod mail are not public.  As the top comment suggests, this doesn't prevent the mods of each subreddit mirror the rules on a separate, public wiki page. Totalitarianism would be banning any public display of how the automod is configured, which is not the case here."
tech,38xg0v,thang1thang2,7,Mon Jun 8 02:00:40 2015 UTC,"To play devil's advocate...  If the AutoMod's configuration is posted in its entirety, it's much easier to post content that goes against the spirit of AutoMod but follows the ""letter of the law"". I actually tend to prefer that AutoMod's configuration is left private so that mods can effectively use it without spammers being able to look up the configuration and devise ways to get around it.  I guess it comes down to, if you can't trust the mods, then whether or not AutoMod's configuration is public is the least of your worries. If you can trust the mods, AutoMod becomes more effective if its configuration isn't public knowledge.  (There is a third option where AutoMod's rules are so extensive and elaborate that they work effectively even while being public and viewable. This almost always means more manual work on the part of the human mods, though)"
tech,38xg0v,thang1thang2,2,Mon Jun 8 03:11:58 2015 UTC,"I'm not quite sure the slippery slope argument is the one to make, here. it's AutoMod, a robot that only acts in predefined behaviors. Federal law is agreed upon by those who make the law and then enforced by police officers. If the police officers were robots, you could probably guarantee that the robot AI would be kept top secret so that people couldn't rig the robots to allow them to break the law.  Having AutoMod's configuration hidden doesn't mean that it's not following the publicly declared and agreed upon rules of the subreddit. Of course, there's always an element of accountability and distrust that should happen, but that's relatively easy to account for without viewing AutoMod's configuration (which you can't trust is the real one, anyway). AutoMod's configuration isn't actually a set of rules, it's the code that enforces the rules already publicly set. There's no ""two rulesets"" scenario happening that couldn't have already happened without your knowledge; nothing has changed in that regard."

Often this set is too large to consider hypotheses one-by-one before the universe dies, so algorithms are built with heuristics to avoid big chunks of probably-worthless hypotheses.  Sometimes many hypotheses will be consistent with the data and more heuristics will be used to select one final answer. For example, the algorithm might apply Occam's Razor to choose the ""most simple"" hypothesis.

The drivers don't cache any registry preferences and read multiple values from the registry for every input event. The result is thousands of registry calls per second. The cursor will freeze for a few seconds periodically if your hard drive bandwidth is saturated. The driver locks while it is trying to read something off the hard drive (possibly registry keys).

The best solution is to use poor-man’s authentication: encrypt the data and trust to the fact that changes in the ciphertext do not translate to semantically sensible changes to the plaintext.1 For example, an attacker can change the ciphertext of an executable, but if the new plaintext is effectively random we can hope that there is a far higher chance that the changes will crash the machine or application rather than doing something the attacker wants.  We are not alone in reaching the conclusion that poor-man’s authentication is the only practical solution to the authentication problem. All other disk-level encryption schemes that we are aware of either provide no authentication at all, or use poor-man’s authentication.  1 This is not a compromise we like, but the only one that makes sense for the problem we’re trying to solve.   It's ironic that Microsoft was aware that people would be concerned when Microsoft invented their own cryptographic primitive:   On the disadvantage side, the diffuser is a new unproven algorithm, and this inevitably leads to questions. Without extensive public scrutiny and analysis of an algorithm there is a justified scepticism about its security. People are reluctant to trust new algorithms.  So why did we choose this option anyway? In our final analysis we decided this was the better choice for our product. The performance gain over the alternatives was important enough to outweigh the disadvantages of a new diffuser algorithm. Time will tell whether we made the right choice.  It bears repeating that even if the diffuser algorithm is utterly broken, all the data is also encrypted using AES-CBC and the confidentiality is still ensured. The only task of the diffuser is to make manipulation attacks harder by providing better poor-man’s authentication than plain AES-CBC provides. Given the limited BitLocker attack model we consider it extremely unlikely that a practical attack against the diffuser will be found   And 4 years later Microsoft was criticized for removing it.

I think you mean CBC alone, I don't see any direct evidence that XTS was considered.  It was standardized in December 2007, so it wasn't FIPS approved (sp800-38a was 2001, I don't see an update) so wouldn't have been available for consideration (edit: during the development of Windows 7, which was released in July 2009).  https://css.csail.mit.edu/6.858/2011/readings/bitlocker.pdf  In any case XTS doesn't provide authentication either, it's just better than the alternatives. ""For the crappy job we ask it to do, XTS is probably up to the task.""  http://sockpuppet.org/blog/2014/04/30/you-dont-want-xts/  Edit: AES-XTS was approved in NIST SP-800-38E in January 2010, but in fact Microsoft's researchers submitted public comments arguing against adoption of XTS as a standard.  Their objections included patent issues.  http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/800-38E/nist-sp-800-38E.pdf"

I’m also going to explain why more open alternatives like TrueCrypt don’t resolve these concerns, and take a brief look at proprietary products like BestCrypt, which Schneier recommends.

If you have Verizon FIOS or one of the dozens of smaller cable tv providers in the US, OneGuide does not work.   your comparison is nonsense nonetheless   It can't decode the actual cable signal.  It can only take the signal from the cable box and pass it through the hdmi.  It can only change channels by ir transmitting to the cable box.

The capacitors failed prematurely due to an incorrectly formulated electrolyte which caused corrosion accompanied by gas generation, causing the capacitor's case to bulge, venting the electrolyte and sometimes rupturing the case.  High failure rates occurred in many well-known brands of electronic equipment. The problem was particularly evident in the motherboards, video cards, and power supplies of personal computers, causing failures of these devices.

OFETs can be prepared either by vacuum evaporation of small molecules, by solution-casting of polymers or small molecules, or by mechanical transfer of a peeled single-crystalline organic layer onto a substrate. These devices have been developed to realize low-cost, large-area electronic products and biodegradable electronics. OFETs have been fabricated with various device geometries. The most commonly used device geometry is bottom gate with top drain and source electrodes, because this geometry is similar to the thin-film silicon transistor (TFT) using thermally grown SiO2 as gate dielectric. Organic polymers, such as poly(methyl-methacrylate) (PMMA), can also be used as dielectric.

""But the total distance is the same!"" one might say, which you might be right in most cases, for the eyes, but typically you don't have to turn your head to read a full screen of text just move your eyes. Instead, when you have an ultra wide monitor it involves moving your head/neck AND your eyes, then doing it again for each line of text. Also, in programs like adobe reader or word where it mimics a page, it is very clearly designed for you to read it as you would a book, so making the document larger just gives you bigger margins, or you have to zoom in on the page instead of changing the page orientation - so you now have less text per screen than you would if you had a different aspect ratio."

Typically 16x9 screens have a resolution of 1920x1080, 1080 in the vertical.  16x10 screens typically have a resolution of 1920x1200, 1200 vertical.  That extra 120 pixels can be very useful.    For example when using remote desktop to connect to a system I can have a full 1280x1024 window displayed on a 16x10 screen whereas it would have scrollbars on a 16x9 screen (1024 pixels plus menu bar plus start menu).  This is largely remedied for me anyway by higher overall resolution.  I don't mind 16x9 when it's 2560x1440.  I much prefer a 16x10 screen when it's 1920x1200 vs 1080 though."

For me, it's very important for coding, the more vertical space I have, the more of the code I can display at once - horizontal space is usually not an issue.  The same can be said for displaying a website like reddit - increasing the vertical space tends to allow for more links to be displayed on screen at once compared to increasing the horizontal.  It's also fairly important for gaming to get more information displayed on the screen at a time.  I find 16:9 or higher to make some field of view issues worse than I would get at 16:10.  It also tends to compact the UI more, making it seem more cluttered.  At the end of the day, I suppose it's just a personal preference, but I greatly appreciate that extra vertical space when I have it."

tech,38imq6,Yodamanjaro,7,Thu Jun 4 15:09:37 2015 UTC,"It's an attempt to keep the display perpendicular to the eyeline.  I have multiple displays and they are angled so that when I look right at them they are square to me.  Makes it look better from a viewing angle perspective and maintains a consistent eye-to-image distance which reduces parallax barrel distortion, which is a real issue with really large displays at close distances.  EDIT: wrong distortion name.."
tech,38imq6,Szos,6,Thu Jun 4 16:38:37 2015 UTC,"Yep, this is the answer.  People with multi monitor setups almost always angle them into a circular shape around themselves.  However, since the panels are all flat, you wind up with a very discretized polygon.  Curved displays are just taking that idea and making it continuous instead of discrete - which is generally what you want to do with any function anyway."
tech,38imq6,atdifan17,1 point,Thu Jun 4 17:20:39 2015 UTC,"That image is a parabola.  The monitors are on the radius of a circle.  It makes a huge difference when it comes to the collection of light at a focal point - circles don't do that, parabolas do.  That said, if you happened to (for some reason) put a light source directly on your face, yep, that'd glare out the whole thing.  But that doesn't seem like a very common use case."

I'm not buying a monitor tied to a particular brand of video card.  Nvidia should give up on Gsync.  They pioneered the idea but it's got to go.  I don't want more resolution yet, video cards can't keep up.  Is it that crazy to want a monitor that can beat a 13 year old Dell 2001fp?  For 10 years monitors went from 1200p to 1080p and stayed at 60hz refresh.

tech,38imq6,leif777,2,Thu Jun 4 17:18:09 2015 UTC,"Using one u28d590d right now:  Pro: 1. Color reproduction is surprisingly good for a TN panel when you are looking at it straight and staring right at the center. 2. Amazing response time per pixel. Decent display lags. (I think it is only around 5ms input leg, gtg is 1ms as claimed but I can't test that) 3. On screen display are very nice. Has Picture in Picture function that actually works okay too.   Con: 1. Viewing angle is not good. Honestly for a display this size IPS is -almost- mandatory. However this display still managed to pass because anything better will be either double the cost + worst refresh rate / triple the cost. The magic angle feature appears to work at first but is a gimmick in reality, It discolor everything.  2. Absolutely terrible stand. There are also zero adjustment and on any unstable surface it will wobble. Compound with no VESA option. 3. Need Display port. Does not have HDMI 2.0. It has HDMI port for 1080p / 4k@30hz only. Does not have DVI input 4. No power button. LED keep flashing after computer turned off. Very annoying if you use it with a non-24/7 computer  Other: 1. Watch out for bad pixel. On a display this size it is pretty much unavoidable, and Samsung does NOT have a clear bad pixel warranty policy that lead to lots of arguing. This is a YMMY thing.  2. If you are using Windows 7 and plans on using other less dense display with this, be aware of the text becoming too small. Windows 7 does not have monitor independent scaling setting. So be warned.  Overall, for the price, it is still good. I do not regret my purchase. However I did made myself a new stands for it cause it still wobbles a little when it is on an Ikea metal frame computer desk."

tech,38dfhp,redwall_hp,4,Wed Jun 3 20:03:10 2015 UTC,"Literally has two definitions now, like a million other words. I understand it's weird that the definitions are opposite, but the word is obviously still very useful, and I have never seen a case where it's confusing which definition a person means. If it meant nothing, nobody would use it.  In fact the new definition is quite useful. It's like ""figuratively"" with an emotional component.  A dictionary is not a set of rules, it's a record of the current state of a language. English has been evolving for thousands of years, it would be very arbitrary to say ""today, the language is perfect, we must never change it again.""  And finally, tons of words mean their own opposite. This isn't new. A couple examples:  Steve and Sarah are at a party. Steve goes home. Who's left? Steve has left, but Sarah is left.  The US can sanction (approve) Iran's nuclear program, or it can sanction (punish) Iran for developing nukes.  Cleave used to mean ""adhere strongly to"", but now it commonly means ""to split apart"". An example of the older usage: https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis%202.24&version=AKJV  If I screen a movie, am I showing it to you, or concealing it?  And so on. You can find many more if you search around.  There's nothing wrong with this development, and these words are always clear in context. It's only a problem in contrived examples like these."
tech,38dfhp,PlushSandyoso,4,Wed Jun 3 22:42:16 2015 UTC,"If dictionaries are not a set of rules, why does ""your"" not mean ""you're""? It's been used this way so many millions of times."
tech,38dfhp,redwall_hp,3,Wed Jun 3 23:22:06 2015 UTC,"In times of yore, before Samuel Johnson, there was no dictionary, and everyone spelled as he saw fit.  Specific dictionaries (Oxford for UK, M-W for US) are not rules, but are guides.  If you want to communicate to a wide audience, you follow the guides.  If you only want to communicate to people who use your local variation of the language, you can do what you want.  Kind of like Chicago/APA/MLA style guides.  It's all about effective communication.  Literal effective communication."
tech,38dfhp,TagMeAJerk,0,Wed Jun 3 23:33:56 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's a little more concise than what I said. You use Chicago style references so that everyone understands the format. If you invent a new format, it would be ""wrong"" because nobody would understand it and you couldn't communicate effectively. If you and a million other people invent a new format, then it's not wrong anymore, it's a new format."
tech,38dfhp,Em_Adespoton,1 point,Thu Jun 4 00:15:07 2015 UTC,"Well that example goes a little beyond the dictionary, because ""you're"" is a contraction, so we'd have to bend the rules of grammar to make ""you're"" mean ""your"". Grammar does change too, but a lot slower and less frequently.  But really, the only reason they don't mean the same thing is that people don't use them the same way. It's totally possible that in a hundred years, ""you're"" will be a synonym of ""your"" and you'll have to say ""you are"" in place of the old ""you're"". That would be different, but not worse, and only confusing for time travelers and historians.  Who cares how long ""you're"" has been around? How many times do you think ""cleave"" was used to mean ""stick to"" before the ""split"" definition crossed anyone's mind? It doesn't matter. A dictionary is a reference to aid in communication. If a dictionary and popular usage differ, then the dictionary is wrong. Refusing to change the definition would be like refusing to change an encyclopedia entry after its subject dies. The reference should reflect the world. If it doesn't, change the reference, not the world.  Definitions change when enough people use a word ""incorrectly"", but in a way that's still clear and useful for communication. That's how new words are created, and how definitions are created and destroyed. It's wrong until everyone knows what it means, and then it doesn't make sense to call it wrong anymore. If it communicates an idea in a way that everyone understands, then it is a part of language basically by definition.  So when you see someone use ""you're"" wrong, you should correct them, because it can actually be ambiguous when used incorrectly. It hinders communication.  But when you see someone use ""ironic"" wrong, there's no reason to correct them. You know what they mean. Everyone knows what they mean. There has never been a misunderstanding caused by a misuse of ""ironic""."

The in- prefix does not universally mean a negative, as a word could obviously begin with it. ""Invent"" is not the opposite of ""vent,"" for instance.  The use of ""flammable"" on warning labels arose due to ignorant people assuming as such and not exercising caution around a combustible material.  On a related note, the term ""invaluable"" means that something is so special that one could not possibly assign a value to it. Its value is so great that any value would be selling it short. Whereas ""valuable"" would mean an object is commonplace and easily  given a price tag."

Q1: Are you going to Taco Bell?  Q2: Aren't you going to Taco Bell? [Alternately, without modern colloquial phrasing: ""Are you not going to Taco Bell?""]  We usually infer from context what the speaker means, and assume that a simple ""yes,"" in both cases, means that the person answering intends to enjoy some Doritos Locos tacos. But we get the occasional silly misunderstanding, where a simple one-word affirmative or negative isn't enough, due to the ambiguity of a question like the second one. You could be answering yes to going...or yes to your intent to not go.  Once upon a time, English had a solution for this. Yes/yea and no/nay. You'd use a different one depending on how the question was worded, specifically clarifying your intent when answering the negatively phrased question.  So, we could say the loss of this is either deterioration, due to lesser utility. It's debatable. I'd definitely argue that the loss of ""literally"" is a very clear case of deterioration, though.

I don't want potentially dirty power going down the same route as my data, as I don't trust the hardware at the other end to always not fail.  The second reason is that data-over-mains emits all sorts of RF; when you're using the ground line to push data AND you're alternating the current in parallel lines, you end up inducting current, which increases data failure rate and can have knock-on effects with other RF sensitive equipment in the area.  For really light use in a well terminated and grounded network, it's fine -- but I've seen enough horrid wiring and out of phase grounding in my time to not want to count on that when plugging one end of my device into mains and the other into a data port."

You used to have to transfer every polygon to the video card on a per-frame basis. Now the GPU stores a lot of them on-memory thanks to vertex buffer objects.  You used to have to transfer any texture that wasn't in video memory from RAM. Now you only need to transfer any 4kb chunk of a texture that shows up on-frame but isn't in video memory. Also, texture compression is significantly more commonplace. (they use up 1/4th to 16th of the space they used to)  So video cards are more efficient in how much they transfer over PCI-E, and transfer less. Whatmore, they have a lot more of their own memory (4-8GB in the higher end leading into next year) to begin with.  Anandtech actually did some tests using the hacky options available on Thunderbolt 2 and they saw everything from a 50% decrease in speed at the worst to a 10% decrease at best. With double the bandwidth available to TB3, and further improvements in video card memory management coming with DX12/Vulkan, things'll probably get even better."

tech,38hqkd,dirk_bruere,3,Thu Jun 4 08:07:59 2015 UTC,"Sad most people are not reading the article and are just reacting against the description. Here's a bulleted list explaining why this works.   Classical batteries (your AA, AAA, D, 9V etc) are designed for analogical  devices that are not finicky about exact voltage or current. An example would be a flashlight, remote control, etc. Many modern devices are digital or are voltage sensitive in one way or another. These devices should use a DC-DC converter to keep voltage stable throughout the life of the battery. Many will, in order to make the device cheaper, stop working when voltage drops under a certain rage (a huge cost in batteries, but that's Vimes' theory of socioeconomic unfairness an issue for another post). Examples would be wireless bluetooth (or such) digital devices (mouses, keyboards), game console pads, things with electrical motors, digital toys, etc. Batteries will drop voltage as they are used (notable even early in their lifetime). This applies even to 9V batteries: they used to be mercury based batteries that had very stable voltage throughout their life, but that is not the case any more. This means that many modern devices will stop working when the battery is still useful. When you are about to throw away the batteries for your device try instead putting them on a lightbulb and see if it works (it might not be 100% bright, but 80% bright is good enough for most people). This sleeve adds what all voltage sensitive (as above) devices should have but often don't: a DC-DC converter that guarantees stable voltage. If your device is not voltage sensitive (can't think of a device that would be current sensitive and run on batteries) or is voltage sensitive but it already has an internal regulator this sleeve will not improve the situation at all. If your device is voltage sensitive and does not have a regulator (again as a cost-cutting measure) then this sleeve will help you gain more of your device. You could also, instead of throwing batteries away from a device, try using them in a non-voltage sensitive device and see if it still works."
tech,38hqkd,lookmeat,5,Thu Jun 4 19:03:34 2015 UTC,"At 1.3V on the average alkaline battery discharge curve, the battery still has about 80% capacity.  That part is correct.  So if a device cannot operate below 1.3V, this voltage booster will help.  However most modern devices actually run fine on 1.2V NiMH rechargeable batteries, making them not-so voltage sensitive.  The only voltage-sensitive device I've seen lately are motor-driven clocks.  So an alkaline battery can drain down to maybe 1.1V and still power those devices.  At 1.1V on the discharge curve, an alkaline cell is almost depleted (~10% capacity).  So this device pretty much does nothing if your devices can use rechargeables which are rather cheap now and can be recharged hundreds of times.  A NiMH rechargeable pays for itself in less than 10 charges.  DC-DC boost converter topology has a much lower conversion efficiency than simple buck converters.  Buck converters can often hit 95% efficiency with good-sized inductors (for low RDC).  Boost converters tend to top off at 85% efficiency.  So subtract at least 15% from the total capacity for power loss.  From the picture it looks like they're not using any good-sized inductors so efficiency is probably lower, therefore I'm going to guess ~70% efficiency.  So subtract 30%.  Conversion efficiency also tend to suck even more for low-drain applications which Alkalines excel at.  Aside from these issues it looks like the idea is OK.  But I would just stick with my Eneloops."
tech,38hqkd,Y0tsuya,0,Fri Jun 5 01:05:44 2015 UTC,"Thanks for this post, I only focused on explaining the reasoning behind the idea and why it wasn't snake oil. That doesn't mean that it's worth the benefit or useful. As I said in only a subset of devices would you see a notable improvement.  Your point on DC-DC converters inefficiency is interesting. The patent and other information I was able to get from the article doesn't point to any revolution in voltage regulators or anything like that.  I had assumed that they used a switching voltage regulator, which (if memory serves right) has an efficiency rate on the level of 9x% until you start approaching 1V where it drops to 8x% and lower very quickly and stops working at all around 0.7V (which the patent seems to imply). At least the lower level were on that range. They are normally integrated circuits for such small voltage/amperage. So the efficiency loss might be closer to 15%-20%. Considering the problem they are trying to solve such loss seems reasonable.  Still the question remains: just how many devices would benefit from this?"

tech,38hqkd,Em_Adespoton,1 point,Thu Jun 4 10:57:43 2015 UTC,"The whole point here is that it costs you significantly less to spend an extra $2.50 and do DC-DC conversion until you've drained the battery than it costs to buy rechargeables and charge them regularly.  Making disposables last 5x as long means they'll last longer than may rechargeable batteries' usable recharge cycles -- and the extra $2.50 is a one-time sunk cost (when your battery eventually dies, you can keep the sleeve and just replace the battery).  There is also a huge amount of environmental savings at play.  Yeah, I sound like a shill -- but this is an issue I've toyed with for decades.  The problem before was that DC-DC converters were too big and clunky to use with small batteries.  So I'll withhold judgement on the specific product until they go to market, but the concept is sound."

FedEx and I believe UPS have a few of these already and have run them for 40 hours straight doing delivers over the holidays.  So the same diesel infrastructure can still be used. This is a big win for bio-diesel users.  One of the better points companies can retrofit older trucks that would have needed large scale maintenance anyway."
tech,389nra,Dark_Shroud,2,Wed Jun 3 13:40:22 2015 UTC,"large vehicles are more suited to go full electric because of their huge sizes.  Garbage trucks could easily do it, but their range would be very limited, and likely not feasible for all but the tightest packed of cities.  Here, the garbage trucks have to drive 35 miles just to get to a waste transfer station so the garbage can be hauled farther, and that is just 1 way, to the dump.  Until a commercial electric vehicle can keep up with and drive the exact same route as current ICE vehicles, then they are not going to ever be considered."
tech,389nra,chubbysumo,2,Fri Jun 5 11:20:18 2015 UTC,With 30 second quick swaps. This is entirely feasible.
tech,389nra,hunt_the_gunt,3,Tue Jun 2 23:49:52 2015 UTC,"No quick swap needed, these are hybrids like the Chevy Volt.  Electric drive train and motor with an on board generator that runs on diesel or Natural gas variants.  Much more efficient method especially for stop and go hauling like deliveries."
tech,389nra,Dark_Shroud,1 point,Wed Jun 3 13:45:14 2015 UTC,"It's still more efficient to ditch the hybrid completely, but that would require quick swaps."
tech,389nra,hunt_the_gunt,1 point,Wed Jun 3 21:36:03 2015 UTC,Right now a delivery truck either normal diesel or Wrightspeed hybrid can spend the whole day on the road and stop at any gas station as needed.  Quick swaps will not be more efficient for years between limited batteries and very limited infrastructure.
tech,389nra,Dark_Shroud,1 point,Wed Jun 3 23:31:08 2015 UTC,Can you put solar on the top of trailers (not shipping container trailers because they need to be stacked) and get any kind of power as you drive?
tech,389nra,grodgeandgo,4,Wed Jun 3 00:16:53 2015 UTC,"You could put solar on the top of trailers, but even if you did, you wouldn't do anything more than maybe get an extra 10-20% of energy... trucks use a lot of power.  This idea in general isn't particularly sound, but there are some advantages. One is that truck infrastructure is setup very well. There is truck stops/gas stations/circuits that they regularly use, so it wouldn't be too hard to map that all out and figure out where hot-swap stations need to be. But, trucks use so much power that I find it hard to believe we have the battery technology that wouldn't make this just extremely wasteful."
tech,389nra,pppowernz,4,Wed Jun 3 01:57:27 2015 UTC,"It wouldn't even be 10-20%, it would be more like 2%."
tech,389nra,diesel_stinks_,2,Wed Jun 3 04:31:01 2015 UTC,That could be enough for long haul trucks to have power while the operator is resting for things like AC/Heat and a TV.  That would save a lot of idling time.  It could also provide some power to offset the refrigeration units.
tech,389nra,sdoorex,3,Wed Jun 3 15:20:55 2015 UTC,"True, but it would be a very expensive way to provide that energy."
tech,389nra,diesel_stinks_,2,Wed Jun 3 15:31:45 2015 UTC,"Agreed, at today's prices.  Using thin-film cells may help with the expense as $/W continues to decline.  Edit:  I am going to make some really rough estimates on expense:     Their figures for a Sprinter van show 1.2 kWh/m2 and 250W/m2 A 53 foot long trailer that is 102 inches wide (assuming that you can't use 10% of each dimension) has an area of 33.9 m2   This would provide 40.68 kWh per day and 8,475 watts   The best figure I can find for price is $0.59/W (manufacture not installed) from First Solar for thin film which would add $5000.25 to the price of the trailer before installation and batteries   Edit 2:  It appears that many trucks already that the ability to use shore power for their APUs.  This should save on expenses of adding solar into the mix.    It also appears that there are many eTRUs (electric powered truck refrigeration units) available.  They use 7.7kW on average which would mean that a solar system could offset ~5.25 hours of operation per day."

tech,384ni6,Shaggyninja,5,Tue Jun 2 09:49:22 2015 UTC,"I think the last time the mistake was in not adequately communicating the change. It felt like they sort of just sprung it on people.  Netflix had built up what felt like a relationship with their clients, giving people an out from the damned cable companies. The service was good and the price was, and still is, a steal. Then, seemingly without notice they upped the price.  If they communicate the price hike, give a solid business reason why, tell us that it needs to happen to keep up with the demands, to be able to continue to provide original content at the quality that we've come to expect, then I think more people would be receptive.  But wtf do I know."

Other than House of Cards, I don't know what else they have. So I would be interested in knowing about their other original programming (especially if they pick up the Top Gear guys!).  If they used the time for something productive, like caching more of the program I'm about to watch in high-definition rather than starting out in a shittily compressed mode first, then I'd be ok with a short trailer."

Netflix on the whole has been drastically better than the cable companies, and isn't known for taking things to the extreme, but I can fully understand why some might get a bit ancy when seeing the ""oh we'll just put a little comercial here, and find out if anyone objects loud enough"" tactic used anywhere."

It's pretty solid in my experience and quick and easy to set up with minimal mucking around in config files (once you get the interface online,  you can finish fully configuring it through that).  I'm well aware of the issues with the desktop versions and that's why I use qBittorrent, but the server version is pretty legit.  I've been running it on a seedbox for over a year with no problems with any private tracker...hasn't felt like such a terrible idea to me.    But I'll give rutorrent another look one of these days.  It's been a few years since I've touched it."
tech,384ni6,secunda,1 point,Tue Jun 2 08:30:21 2015 UTC,"The ""terrible idea"" bit was from a chunk that I ended up removing but apparently missed. I edited it out a while ago. Sorry about that mate.   Otherwise utorrent server is proprietary software. You can't claim to know what the software is or is not doing. The desktop and server editions share the same codebase, if there's something malicious going on deep down with the desktop version it's ported to the server version. And considering the utorrent developer's track record there really is no reason to trust any software they release."
tech,384ni6,arcticblue,1 point,Tue Jun 2 08:49:22 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah, I totally understand.  But all the nasty stuff that came in the desktop versions were part of the installer AFAIK, not utorrent itself, which is why I trust the server version more.  I usually use it because it's quick and easy to set up on a server and I don't really have much free time these days.  When I do get some time though, I'll take another look at rutorrent and whatever else is out there."

That being said it's at least only before and after the video. Not like horrible hulu which blasts you with countless ads in between.  People enduring ads should at least have to pay less. I.e. I think there should be the option to pay less and have ads in exchange. Although it's probably more realistic that they would increase the price for those who don't want any ads at all.
tech,384ni6,ThatCurlyHairedKid,42,Tue Jun 2 08:07:25 2015 UTC,"But thats how it started with Hulu. I remember being a beta tester for Hulu way back in the day. I got to see a single ad and then watch the program. It then became ads in the normal ad slot. Only one and it was short so no biggie. Then they got longer and longer and there were now multiple ads. And now, its the crapfest we all see."

tech,384ni6,Purpledrank,7,Tue Jun 2 09:23:28 2015 UTC,"The irony/problem with that is that people who are able/willing to pay more are high income earners/spenders. Those are exactly the kinds of people they want to advertise to, not the other way around. I suspect Netflix/streaming model is screwed and most people here will go back to pirating while most of the lay people will just have an on demand TV with commercials.  Netflix is screwed because they don't own the IP rights. They have to negotiate for it about once a year for a set of shows/movies from a producer/conglomerate like NBC/Universal. Those people have a lot of power, and if they want ads they can make Netflix show ads. They have the IP rights and the exact licensing rights too (eg: All rights reserved)."

Today I went into TV shows and had it show me their best suggestions for me with my new preferences, hoping to find something that I haven't watched that could be good. In the top 5 was that new shitty, stupid looking show that has horrible reviews called Between.   I hover over it and they expect me to rate it at what looks to be 1.7. One point fucking 7. So I go down about 6 rows and they're listing shows I would give a rating of 4 on! So not only did they completely ignore the fact that I would most likely HATE this show by putting it at the top, it's THEIR show. This is blatant advertising of their shitty content their trying to cram down my throat, and I don't want them showing me the same stupid fucking 1 minute commercial for this dumb fucking show before every video I watch on the site.

I'd rather just look through the genre categories and make my own decision.  But honestly, its such a low price per month and I get so much satisfaction and enjoyment out of having hundreds of movies/shows legally available to me. If they had 1-minute ads before each Netflix show, I wouldn't even personally care. Especially since its at the beginning and I won't be interrupted later. Hulu's model, though?

Binge watching an entire season or 3 is perhaps one of the most appealing features Netflix offers, to me. I really hope they don't change this model and move further towards a ""traditional tv"" model.

We see advertising all the time for processed foods and things that aren't good for us -- I never see billboards or TV commercials about how awesome the broccoli at the farmer's market is.  Our culture makes it more difficult for people to eat healthy, and our politics also contribute to this mess.  We subsidize corn and so we have corn syrup in everything.  We zone commercial areas so far away from housing so it makes it less likely for people to walk or bike to the store or to work, and we don't provide adequate bike lanes for the people that decide to do it anyway.

These sort of products started to exist around the 1900's and once they started coming into existence, our ability to scale up complexity has been increasing at a very fast rate.  What is more mind blowing, IMO, is the internet.  The internet is a platform that is cross platform/device/manufacturer.  It works on everything. Every single day there are 1000s of changes being made. Hard changes.  New products are being brought up all the time, new servers, new software.  All of this connected by a global network of interconnected devices.  We have huge transatlantic and even transpacific cables spanning the oceans for the sole purpose of the internet.  We have multiple satellites in orbit who's sole purpose is the transport of internet information.  You say ""No one person could make a laptop"".  Don't make me laugh.

In fact, ""learning"" and ""memory/cognition"" are also usually taught as two separate classes and represent two fairly distinct disciplines within psychology. One way to understand the distinction between the two is to consider B.F. Skinner’s often quoted definition of learning, ""a relatively permanent change in behavior as the result of experience."" One basic difference between memory and learning is that memory is not necessarily relatively permanent."

They use something called vitrification, where they use the circulatory system to pump an anti-freeze agent into every part of the body. They are then able to lower the temperature enough to where all chemistry stops without any freezing occurring. Thus, ice crystals don't form and cells don't burst.

While I don't necessarily think that taxi regulation is perfect, I see Uber and taxis as roughly equilivant, so this seems kind of underhanded.   Besides that, when they wanted to expand into my city they were banned, but started operations anyway. I didn't look into the situation much, but people on the subreddit said that the city government had tried to be accommodating, but Uber didn't meet with them, and instead went for the ""we'll do what we want"", along with some marketing thing that was general anti-authority.   This is all vague recollections though. I have no particular bone to pick with Uber, and if I needed a taxi I'd likely look to them, but I've just read a couple things I don't like about them, but nothing enough to get up in arms about/let it affect my life."
tech,37zitr,orangejake,3,Mon Jun 1 04:13:25 2015 UTC,"As a liberal, it's weird for me to ask this, but why does Uber need to be regulated? I have had awful experiences with taxis...they're ALWAYS late, they never call if they can't find your place, they rarely speak English, you have little recourse if they take a weird route, and for some reason they don't take credit cards. Why do I, an individual, contacting another individual to ask for a ride and offering reasonable compensation that we both agree upon need to be regulated beyond normal business taxation?  With Uber, you don't even need to have your wallet, just a phone. They will call and/or text you if they are having difficulties. They have strong incentives to give you the best ride possible (Uber is extremely strict about review scores that must be maintained if they wish to continue driving). There's no tipping. The prices are low. And they're PROMPT; and if they're not, you can see the car on GPS and know where they are and when they'll be there.  Taxis are outdated, and cities that ban them are corrupt; there is no legitimate reason to ban Uber."
tech,37zitr,mardish,6,Mon Jun 1 05:07:17 2015 UTC,"While that may be true, I view regulating only some companies in a certain sector as wrong.  Whether that means abolishing taxi regulation, or regulating Uber as a taxi company, I don't particularly care (it isn't something I'm knowledgeable on, so I don't feel responsible picking either viewpoint).  But the current system of having a set of regulations for Taxi's, and nothing for Uber, I disagree with."
tech,37zitr,orangejake,1 point,Mon Jun 1 05:15:05 2015 UTC,"Agreed; there needs to be an even playing field, whether that's regulating Uber, or de-regulating taxis. There's advantages and disadvantaged to both options, but Uber and their like are exploiting questionable legal ground to build a business model, and it all could come crashing down with one DOJ/FBI action.  For example, see poker sites after UIGEA."
tech,37zitr,ComebackShane,2,Mon Jun 1 07:30:43 2015 UTC,"As a liberal, you should know a bit about what outsourcing does.   With regulated taxis you can set it so that the drivers are protected from employers, that they need to be provided with health insurance, sick leave, and that their wages won't be below a certain point. Uber has their drivers as independent contractors though, but their also obliged to go at uber prices. Since uber doesn't need to pick up the tab for payroll taxes, health care or anything else they can push down on the price customers (thats you) pay but of course it pushes down on the money the drivers earn. Oh and the drivers are responsible for gas and maintenance too.   Not only is there a legit reason to ban uber, there seems to be a legit reason to sue them."

I use taxis/Uber because I do not have a vehicle of my own, and I sometimes desire the convenience of taking a direct route to my destination downtown/home or to their airport or Megabus/Greyhound, for example. And from my perspective, Uber is bringing much needed competition to the local taxis who act as if there are no alternatives, and thus only provide the minimum standards that are required of them."

There are lots of situations where people act as a contractor rather than an employee, and that's fine. If someone needs their healthcare managed by an employer, or can't manage to pay taxes correctly, or don't like the way Uber manages pricing, they should just not work for Uber.  Another example of a successful company that doesn't pay healthcare, pay payroll taxes, and forces pricing on their contractors is Twitch. Should they be heavily regulated as well?"

Regulation is to the point that they essentially act as a monopoly, de-emphasizing modernization and smart business practices that they would have to follow if they wished to be competitive otherwise. If we are going to treat them like a public utility, it needs to be ALL the way--roll the companies together and, instead of just oversight, put some management in place that can bring about positive changes instead of just keeping to a bare minimum. Because, as I see it in my region, that is all that the regulations have done."

And it's not because of regulations, it's because they thought t hay had a monopoly and had no incentive to improve.   Uber found a loophole and is in the process of breaking up these monopolies. They might have some shitty practices but not really worse than these taxi  lobbies/mafias, and they are actually improving the situation for the customers in most of the places where they operate.   Ideally, competitors to Uber will come and prevent another monopoly to go haywire. I  any case,  Uber provided the opportunity to change a situation that was stuck."

tech,37zitr,TerminallyCapriSun,-1,Mon Jun 1 05:41:21 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying they're equilivant in implementation, just that the industry is essentially the same.  The ""rent a vehicle for transportation from point A to point B short term, generally within cities in a fairly private manner"" should be a single industry, and should be regulated as one industry.  If you allow an analogy where Comcast takes the place of Taxi's, and Google Fiber of Uber (or any other situation where there's a shitty option and a great on in one industry), then I'd argue they should be regulated the same.    My issue is one of preferential treatment: even if Uber had the best implementation possible, and had literally no naysayers of all their customers, I'd want them to be regulated the same as the taxi industry.  I'm against preferential government regulation because of ""good behavior"" of a company, which seems to be what you're arguing.  This all isn't to say that Uber should be regulated, just that any regulation of the industry should apply to all companies.  If Uber isn't regulated, Taxi's shouldn't.  If Taxi's are regulated, Uber should be.  Otherwise, the government is giving Uber an unfair advantage within the industry, which I see as wrong."

In a swift moment, its head peaks, listening to its environment carefully. Twas not the hunter that had made a sound, yet it is still startled. The buck then, in a moment's notice, charges straight at the hunter, who is now in a panicked state. He takes aim with his rifle, but the adrenaline is causing him to shake uncontrollably and is interfering with his shot. The hunter, seeing no way to protect himself in time, leaps to his side to evade the buck. He looks up to see the buck still running away, but it was as if it weren't trying to attack him. The hunter hears the sound of a cracking branch nearest the area where the buck was feasting and is immediately filled with disbelief and embarrassment from what he sees.

From the article:   How it folds: when placed on a heating element, the PVC contracts, and where the structural layers have been cut, it creates folds, said Ackerman. The self-folding exercise takes place on a flat sheet; the robot folded itself in a few seconds. Kelsey Atherton in Popular Science, said, ""Underneath it all, hidden like the Wizard of Oz behind his curtain, sit four electromagnetic coils, which turn on and off and makes the robot move forward in a direction set by its shape.""

tech,37u3s2,dan4334,6,Sat May 30 16:08:01 2015 UTC,So wouldn't it be more efficient to use directional antennas?  Using power to radiate signals then trying to convert those signals back into power doesn't seem like the best way to do it.
tech,37u3s2,Preowned,2,Sat May 30 16:13:32 2015 UTC,"but then the antenna needs to turn in some way right?  also, would not be able to pick up singles from every direction when idle or when the cell tower changes. Also, any moving part in a device is prone to breaking.    It works only when a phone is transmitting.   This means it only kicks in when there is an active back and forth, so you can ""cut off"" and recover energy going the wrong way.   This device seems to have potential, assuming they can get it working so it will not cut off active communication, or if the cell tower switches.   Recover energy from a signal, but be able to stop recovery or dampening instantly so communication is not broken. I think the idea is sound.

Easier how?  Does anybody have any web links to tutorials that give an overview of what Polymer is and examples of how it's useful (rather than examples of how to use it)."
tech,37pq1d,bslade,26,Fri May 29 15:40:22 2015 UTC,"I can give you the very simple answer, from the perspective of a web developer.  Polymer is the first serious user-facing release of somethign called web components.  Let's use a very simple example.  In the past, if you want an image carousel on a website, the way you did it was pretty universal.  You'd make a div or other block and fill it with images, looking something like this:  <div class=""js-carousel-hookup-class"">   <img src=""..."">   <img src=""..."">   <img src=""...""> </div>   Then, you would plug in carouselHookupScript.js, which would find that div and turn it into something like this at the user's client side:  <div class=""slider single-item slick-initialized slick-slider"">                 <div aria-live=""polite"" class=""slick-list draggable"" tabindex=""0""><div class=""slick-track"" style=""opacity: 1; width: 4480px; transform: translate3d(-560px, 0px, 0px);""><div class=""slick-slide slick-cloned"" data-slick-index=""-1"" aria-hidden=""true"" style=""width: 560px;""><h3>6</h3></div><div class=""slick-slide slick-active"" data-slick-index=""0"" aria-hidden=""false"" style=""width: 560px;""><h3>1</h3></div><div class=""slick-slide"" data-slick-index=""1"" aria-hidden=""true"" style=""width: 560px;""><h3>2</h3></div><div class=""slick-slide"" data-slick-index=""2"" aria-hidden=""true"" style=""width: 560px;""><h3>3</h3></div><div class=""slick-slide"" data-slick-index=""3"" aria-hidden=""true"" style=""width: 560px;""><h3>4</h3></div><div class=""slick-slide"" data-slick-index=""4"" aria-hidden=""true"" style=""width: 560px;""><h3>5</h3></div><div class=""slick-slide"" data-slick-index=""5"" aria-hidden=""true"" style=""width: 560px;""><h3>6</h3></div><div class=""slick-slide slick-cloned"" data-slick-index=""6"" aria-hidden=""true"" style=""width: 560px;""><h3>1</h3></div></div></div>                  <!-- tons more code here, that's just the outer wrapper! -->              <button type=""button"" data-role=""none"" class=""slick-prev"" aria-label=""previous"" style=""display: block;"">Previous</button><button type=""button"" data-role=""none"" class=""slick-next"" aria-label=""next"" style=""display: block;"">Next</button><ul class=""slick-dots"" style=""display: block;""><li class=""slick-active"" aria-hidden=""false""><button type=""button"" data-role=""none"">1</button></li><li aria-hidden=""true"" class=""""><button type=""button"" data-role=""none"">2</button></li><li aria-hidden=""true""><button type=""button"" data-role=""none"">3</button></li><li aria-hidden=""true""><button type=""button"" data-role=""none"">4</button></li><li aria-hidden=""true""><button type=""button"" data-role=""none"">5</button></li><li aria-hidden=""true""><button type=""button"" data-role=""none"">6</button></li></ul></div>   Alternately, you might use something server-side that would serve this to the client machine in the first place.  To customize these scripts, you would need to manually edit very specific CSS rules and possibly even adjust javascript to extend functionality (a well-built one like slick, which I used for the above sample, will perform most customization through a series of JSON properties fed to the js instantiator, e.g. on their homepage).  With a web component, you won't need anything after the first block but for one line of code to spin up the web component.  So you'll have a link somewhere that pulls in the web component (say, slick-carousel-component), then you'll just do something that looks like vanilla HTML, e.g.,  <slick-carousel-component prop1="""" prop2="""">   <img whateverproperties src=""..."">   <img whateverproperties  src=""..."">   <img whateverproperties  src=""...""> </slick-carousel-component>   All those JSON instantiators and all that stuff can virtually disappear into very easy-to-use markup code.   Now, the example here is for a simple image carousel.  The scripts aren't really hard at all to use in this case.  But the second we're talking about, say, a web plugin for chatroom commenting or email forms or even eCommerce, it's not hard to imagine that the complexity would grow really quickly.  And the code to create an eShop would be much easier when you can just have <shop-item>, <buy-button>, <shopping-cart>, et. cetera.

If my website looks shitty or doesn't work right on your ten-year-old piece of software, I'm sorry, but I'm not going to hamstring the 98% of users who don't have these issues or waste countless hours trying to build fallbacks. I believe strongly in an accessible web, but I also believe the customer isn't always right. If they want to run a decade-old piece of software like IE 6 and expect the same experience as someone using the latest version of Chrome, well, they're no better than a customer who walks into a BBQ restaurant demanding a vegan option. If you want to serve those people, go ahead, but after wasting countless hours of my career trying to accommodate dinosaurs I've come to realize that one of the reasons that so many users have been slow to adopt new browsers is because there's been very little pressure to do so.

That's a significant increase to the minimum specs required to play a game in VR vs today's PC/Console games, and IMO, will be a major driving factor in creating demand for faster/cheaper hardware in tomorrow's PC/PC-like-Consoles market (Steambox and Google TV devices have a lot of potential for VR). I also think it means current console VR devices (looking at you, Morpheus) are a bit 'doomed'.. not that they wont have compelling experiences, only that those will be a far-cry short of the type you'll get on a high-end PC (in terms of graphics fidelity and thus, to some degree, immersion). PS4 simply doesn't have the raw horsepower required.  So.. that said, there are untapped software/driver tricks which can help a lot too. I believe AMD is already talking about dedicated VR driver/hardware which will eliminate a lot of geometric calculations needed for stereoscopic rendering, and modern graphics API's like Vulkan and DX12 will help game devs get the most out of the hardware soon.  I think perhaps the most exciting thing though is the prospect of ray-tracing + time-warp in VR.. Raytracing makes some sense for VR because the resolution can easily be dynamic (high-density at the focus point and gradually decreasing towards the edge of your vision) which also significantly lowers the amount of rays needed to be traced to complete a scene (unlike with traditional image viewing where the entire image needs uniform detail).. combined with time-warp you can significantly speed up ray-tracing (in many scenes) by reusing time-warped pixels from the previous render and filling in the ""torn"" pixel gaps (which isn't beneficial with rasterization, but has been shown to increase ray-tracing ~2x, depending on the amount of motion in the scene). If these things get more dedicated hardware & drivers (by market-driven push for more realistic VR experiences) we may finally be on the cusp of a ray-tracing revolution in graphics hardware.. for VR no less... though similar claims has been made in the past (we remember you, Larrabee), so only time will tell.

tech,37jmrt,H3g3m0n,3,Thu May 28 19:31:53 2015 UTC,"Depends more on the game, rather than the system. Heck, even the PS3 has some silky smooth 60-fps 1080p titles, WipEout HD/Fury comes to mind.  That's not to ignore the relative low-power hardware that consoles have in comparison to high-end PCs, but smart game design coupled with efficient programming can lead to some visually stunning results even with those limitations."

If it costs $600, I might not even get one and I've been wanting one since before the DK1 came out.   To be completely honest though I care more about what the HTC Vive and Lighthouse will cost, I think they'll ""win"" the VR competition this generation."
tech,37jmrt,10GuyIsDrunk,3,Thu May 28 21:58:59 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that was a probably a bad move... whether influence by that or not, $400 is about the top of my range for price point... below $400 I would probably pick one up just for the novelty factor (consider how much I would have to drop on GPU/CPU upgrades).

Newegg shows computers between $1100-1580 with a 970, so I think $300-$400 still makes sense for the potential range of Rift prices."
tech,37jmrt,-Josh,12,Thu May 28 13:46:16 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't expect Rift to ever be priced much differently from an upper range phone or tablet. The guts are comparable, and even mass production won't push the costs down an awful lot."

tech,37jmrt,cyberdark10,0,Thu May 28 12:38:05 2015 UTC,Yeah. Isn't the highest end GPU like $700? It was last year. That's not a $1000 rig.
tech,37jmrt,RegretfulEducation,4,Thu May 28 13:52:31 2015 UTC,If you want absolute highest end (that isn't a workstation card) at the moment that's a Titan X @ ~$1k. Buying one is...likely unwise.  If you want realistic highest end at the moment that's a 980 at ~$520. AMDs new flagship allegedly drops next month and will likely be in the $600-700 range but that's pure speculation.
tech,37jmrt,Namell,1 point,Thu May 28 18:12:38 2015 UTC,"Plus with the release of DX12 and possibly some competition with Intel from AMD with their Zen CPU architecture may make this much, much cheaper.

tech,37jmrt,from_dust,6,Thu May 28 18:58:15 2015 UTC,I would imagine the cost of the computer able to run it well would be closer to 800-900 (when considering all component costs) and a pre-built may run closed to a thousand. Leaving about 500 for the cost of an oculus would be about right in my opinion when considering the cost of high end gaming monitors can be upwards of 700.

tech,37jmrt,from_dust,3,Thu May 28 06:59:29 2015 UTC,It is pretty stupid to buy it for few years anyways. Just wait until it has been tested few years and we see if it will actually be fun or just another short lived gimmick. By then prices should be down a lot.

tech,37jmrt,nerfdude,2,Thu May 28 08:18:27 2015 UTC,"Having used the Dev kits, i can tell you that this will certainly not be a short lived gimmick and it is indeed fun. The Dev kits are fairly comfortable, there is no reason to expect the production version to be worse than the development prototypes. You're welcome to be skeptical, but dont ignore the fact that VR headsets are already in the wild and have been ""tested for a few years"" There are literally over 200,000 Oculus Dev Kit headsets (incl v1 and v2) out there."
tech,37jmrt,Breadhook,2,Thu May 28 12:03:55 2015 UTC,"I doubt this will be a short lived gimmick.  I picture this going down a lot like the mid-90s when games transitioned from 2d to 3d.  It was an exciting and fun time in gaming while devs experimented and figured out the formulas that worked best.  Instead of waiting for the dust to settle, you have the opportunity to be a part of a similar transition period.  It should be fun and interesting."

I'd say it's pretty high-range for most applications:   GTX 970: 365€ i5 4690k: 230€ Mainboard: 150€ CPU Fan: 70€ RAM: 140€ PSU: 85€ tower ~100€ (invested more here, but a basic one would suffice, I guess) SSD: 100€ HDD: 75€   that's 1300€ for the main components alone, add another 150-200€ for keyboard, mouse, cables, additional fans, etc. - and maybe another 100€ for an additional screen, since I don't want to wear the Rift for everything.  Now, I'm already over the suggested 1500€ for a pretty high-end gaming rig and I can run pretty much any current gen game on the highest settings with a suitable framerate.  But for the love of Odin, Allah and Jeebus - I am 100% sure that I cant run any of those games at a stable 90 frames per second on a 2160x1200 resolution... even on midrange settings  I want to see that 1500$/€ solution that can run games, at least current generation games, that don't look like absolute shite on the suggested parameters (90 fps, 2160x1200 resolution) with at least somewhat immersive graphics-settings ...  I don't think anyone would pay 1500€ just to have a glorified facebook-machine that's able to run a few simple indie-style games and virtual video chatting or whatever"

Virtual reality is a new territory that requires like 4x the GPU power of a similar, non VR game, and because of that the paradigm around designing graphics needs to change.

Expect similar things to happen to the GTX Titan X and to some extent the GTX 980 as well.

tech,37n3ud,brjacobso,8,Thu May 28 21:10:46 2015 UTC,It's just you.  Keeping it very high level...    EMV is a card-present technology that adds a locally-kept and encrypted PIN to the charge validation process.    Apple pay introduces a third party to the account relationship and uses a distinct account number on a per-merchant basis.  It is a card-not-present technology.    Source: I helped implement Apple Pay.
tech,37n3ud,flopsweater,3,Thu May 28 21:18:06 2015 UTC,EMV cards can also be implemented so that the PIN is verified by the bank. They can also simply not have a PIN at all (in the case of the vast majority of US credit cards).
tech,37n3ud,tmiw,3,Thu May 28 21:23:18 2015 UTC,Right - one of the major issues many of us complain about on a regular basis.  Immediate theft and usage of an EMV card can continue to run wild if we do not demand that second authentication factor and instead rely on signature.
tech,37n3ud,peaches-in-heck,1 point,Thu May 28 23:03:34 2015 UTC,"My understanding is that the main problem with chip and signature before was with unattended locations like ticket machines and gas pumps. In the US EMV terminals will all correctly process the card's CVM list regardless of whether it's C&P or C&S but elsewhere (especially in Europe) the unattended locations pretty much get totally lost if they see a card without PIN anywhere. Supposedly Visa is mandating that almost all unattended terminals work correctly with chip and signature (and they supposedly do so now, at least in tourist areas), but I'm not sure how big of a problem it still is in practice.  Plus, of course, the security problems of relying on signature or no authentication in the worst-case."
tech,37n3ud,tmiw,1 point,Thu May 28 23:53:03 2015 UTC,In Australia we allow transactions up to $100 without pin verification.  After that of course you are required to enter a pin.  What I have never tried is doing multiple consecutive $100 transactions at the same POS.
tech,37n3ud,lordspesh,2,Fri May 29 21:14:47 2015 UTC,"Yeah that makes sense. I was thinking very high level  as both methods rely on hardware present tech, using info generated on the fly that would be useless if intercepted. But yes, they are more different in implementation and concepts."
tech,37n3ud,happyscrappy,1 point,Thu May 28 23:53:43 2015 UTC,"Why do you say Apple Pay is CNP?

For example, you state that Apple Pay is CNP - that is not true for in-store transactions, but is true for in-app.  To which were you referring?  When you state that Apple Pay ""introduces a third-party to the account relationship"", to whom are you referring?  Apple?  I understood it that the relationship during transaction remained between consumer and issuing bank and that Apple only was involved in the initial on-boarding.  I work in the field, same as you.

tech,37n3ud,AbsarokaOnMyMind,3,Fri May 29 00:19:19 2015 UTC,"Apple Pay does use the EMV (Euro MasterCard Visa) protocol that is found in EMV cards (Chip and PIN). However, EMV cards still store your Primary Account Number (PAN) on your card, just in a more secure manner. Apple Pay stores a Device Account Number (DAN) that is related to your PAN on the back end and not at the phone level.  So if a transaction was somehow compromised (None reported as of yet), they would only get your Device Account Number and it would be worthless to them.  The Pin in Chip and PIN is taken care of in Apple Pay by the FingerPrint authentication.   Additionally, Apple Pay uses tokenization where an encrypted token is created using the DAN and is only good for that one transaction. Again if it is intercepted it is useless.  It is rare but some EMV cards get compromised and are available in the Black market, much less frequently than non Chip cards.  With Apple Pay you have the securest option because the information is useless without the phone and fingerprint.   Apple Pay does require the NFC, Near Field Communications protocol a short distance radio. It is possible to surreptiously intercept NFC communications but as stated above, a criminal doesn't intercept anything they can use."
tech,37n3ud,kirklennon,2,Thu May 28 21:22:15 2015 UTC,"Additionally, Apple Pay uses tokenization where an encrypted token is created using the DAN and is only good for that one transaction. Again if it is intercepted it is useless.   That's not quite accurate. The DAN is the token (""Payment Token"" in the language of the EMV spec). The token/DAN is created when the card is added to a device. The security over the PAN comes in the fact that this token will work only as part of Apple Pay because it requires a dynamic security code that only your iPhone/Apple Watch will be able to generate. A stolen PAN can be used any place that doesn't require a security code (which isn't everywhere, but isn't rare either). The DAN will not be accepted by the bank unless it has the security code (aka cryptogram)."

tech,37n3ud,Em_Adespoton,1 point,Thu May 28 21:24:04 2015 UTC,"EMV cards are typically compromised by obscuring the chip contacts in the payment reader-- EMV always falls back to Track 2 if the chip read fails.  Once you're dealing with Track 2 data, compromise is a piece of cake, as the data is stored in the clear and is only validated by a LUHN check digit.  Other compromises involve theft of the physical card, after which the card can be duplicated if the transport code is known, or if scanned with an electron microscope.  A third method of compromise involves a man-in-the-middle attack where a fake reader is placed inside the legitimate reader.  Payment is then made using a soft-chip in the fake reader, and the payment from the card actually ends up elsewhere."

Going for text recognition works better in some ways, but is about as accurate as a phone's preditctive text feature -- meaning it screws up all over the place.  If a phoneme is messed up, it's usually at least similar sounding, so it comes out sounding more like an accented affectation than a clearly wrong word.  The second bit is the voice mapping -- extracting all the phonemes from your own voice.  This is the bit you need the dev kit for, as standard Macintalk that's come with all Macs since 1984 has canned ""voices"" that don't include your own.  Creating your own involves isolating the timbre and mapping the phonemes.  Then once you're done, you can use the Macintalk tool to record your voice (or anyone else's voice), do a phoneme mapping, then output the result using your custom macintalk voice.  So you can take a famous song sung by someone else, and swap out the singer's voice for your voice, being exactly as pitchy and accenty as theirs originally was, preserving the timbre of your own voice."

No it isn't (yes i'm double negativing you)  The relevant quote from Post is this one,   Now, after further development, Dr Post estimates it's possible to produce lab-beef for $80 a kilo   So with a 100g burger pattie at $8 (+ $4 bun etc.) the fastcoexist.com article is a reasonable approximation of what Post said.  And sure he doesn't say how but your comment and mine was about what Post had said, not what has been proven."
tech,37cuao,holloway,4,Wed May 27 01:24:57 2015 UTC,"As has been said in other threads, ""estimates it's possible"" is extremely vague. It certainly doesn't imply that he has done it. To say that in vitro meat is ""now"" $12 is factually incorrect, because nobody has ever produced it for that price. More likely, Post was talking about the theoretical minimum price that would be achievable with perfect technology. Which is analogous to saying that microchips should have the cost of sand. That's just my guess, because $80 a kilo has no basis in modern biotech."

Setting aside the intentionally inflammatory tone, I really am genuinely hopeful this technology goes somewhere because of the potential it has to impact various ethical or moral concerns around the consumption of meat.  If we can just pop down to wal-mart some day and buy a Mr. Meat machine, we suddenly become potentially able to do all kinds of stuff that we couldn't or wouldn't do now due to ethical concerns.   Hypothetically:  Cultured meat addresses the ethical issues of vegetarianism and veganism  Cultured meat lets us ethically eat endangered species. Imagine buying a cell culture to grow whale or rhino meat or something, and the proceeds go toward conservation of that species.  This one comes off as horrible and creepy, I admit, but imagine celebrities auctioning off a cell culture to support their favorite charity or something.

I think the tech will continue to advance. In fact, I can envision a point in the not too distant future (if it's not already here) where an artificial system is better at detecting emotional states than are people... even the people experiencing those states! I think that with things like being able to test for biomarkers (sweating/body heat/heart bpms/eye movements/nervous or calm gestures(body language)/even neurotransmitter levels or electrical patterns and blood activity in the brain)... that machines/programs will get really good at it. Probably better than untrained or even trained humans.  People do have emotional blindspots... like they're not sure what they're feeling... they're not aware that they're sweating, or nervously fidgeting or sitting relaxed, or that their heart rate and body temp is up. Or... even like with the tech in the article... that they're typing differently than they usually would.

Google has actually made a great deal of effort to prevent copyright infringement for exactly that reason.    This doesn't make sense. For what reason?   In reality, Google has made a great deal with the major media conglomerates, allowing those conglomerates to bypass the DMCA protections for both consumer and corporation, and utilized a one-sided ContentID system that only benefits the corporation.

All google is actually doing is forwarding correspondence sent to them about you.  It would be like if you rented a house, one of your neighbors complained about noise and said you owed them $100, and the landlord sent you a copy of the complaint along with a note that said ""Heads up, we got this note, we wanted to show it to you. If it turns out that your are being exceptionally noisy, we may have to kick you out.""  The article is making it sound like google is saying ""Hey, your neighbors say you're noisy and you owe them $100, so we're charging you a $100 fee."" Which is deliberately misleading... Heck, the email from google that they posted specifically said that google hadn't turned over any information about them and wouldn't unless they were subpoenaed. They are literally doing nothing more different from Comcast, AT&T, etc. except for making you aware of complaints filed against you. I've gotten emails from AT&T before warning me about my download habits, and honestly I would actually prefer to see the complaint filed so I could know how seriously to take it."

Unless there is some sort of warning from google attached, eg 'get 3 more of these and we will disconnect your service' then it's effectively nothing more than spam mail and you can disregard it.   It doesn't mean google cares or not, they receive these notices and they have to choose to do something with them, even if that something is nothing, it's an active choice they have to make.

Hinton explained, work at a higher level by extracting something closer to actual meaning.  With the advent of huge datasets and powerful processors, the approach pioneered by Hinton decades ago has come into the ascendency and underpins the work of Google's artificial intelligence arm, DeepMind, and similar programs of research at Facebook and Microsoft.

Then came Ivy Bridge with 22nm, then followed up by Haswell. Then came broadwell at 14nm which will be followed up by Sky Lake with the same. Fitting 50% more every 2 years isn't Moore's law.  Cannon Lake will have 10 nm, to be followed with the same the next year.  Then we get to the ill fated 7nm territory where silicon transistors go quantum and no longer work. Sure, they could try some new material, but given that there is a hard limit of at best 1nm (maybe 10 atoms across per transistor). That might sneak a few extra years in, but regardless there is a hard limit.  That's not to say that there won't be some other way to keep this pace going, but it won't be Moore's law. Personally I prefer the ""Law of Accelerating Returns"", but people are more skeptical of this term."

tech,36ndhn,tripler6,5,Thu May 21 06:36:45 2015 UTC,"Well, the oculus is a bit more complex than a normal monitor, though... using the oculus requires using their software development kit, so they could in principle forbid the use of their SDK for creating pornographic content.  So unlike a normal monitor, the oculus has software specifically developed for it, containing software licensed by facebook, which they have a certain degree of control over. That doesn't mean that end-users cannot just run whatever they want on it (facebook has no real method of preventing you from doing whatever you want with your oculus), but if facebook were to take a strong stance against pornography on the rift, and if they were to legally codify such restrictions into the licensing agreement of their SDK, a lot of developers would certainly drop it.   You certainly don't pick a fight with facebook if you are a small-time erotic game studio, even when you have the moral and/or legal high-ground."

In the EU, we have strict data protection laws that allows individuals to request a company stops processing their personal information (within reason of course, you can't take out a loan and then request your bank forgets about you for example), amongst other things. So all you would need to do if you're within the EU is to send them a request for what data they have on you, and then send them a request to stop processing that data.  Of course, in order to do this, you need to send them your personal details in the request anyway, and they'll no doubt store a copy of the requests for quite a while to cover their backs, since it is after all a legal issue.

The Spectrum was intended to work with a normal domestic cassette recorder,  and despite differences in audio reproduction fidelity, the software loading process was quite reliable, if somewhat slow (by today's standards).  Although the ZX Microdrive was initially greeted with good reviews,  it never took off as a distribution method due to worries about the quality of the cartridges and piracy.  Hence the main use became to complement tape releases, usually utilities and niche products like the Tasword word processing software and Trans Express, (a tape to microdrive copying utility). No games are known to be exclusively released on Microdrive.  Although the Interface 2 proved popular, the relatively high cost of ROM cartridges meant that very few titles were released in this format.

The HBM stack ends up trading speed for width, it runs at a 500MHz clock, two bits per clock and 1024b width vs 1750MHz and four bits per clock and 32b wide for GDDR5. The end result is 7Gbps per bit or 28GBps per chip for GDDR5, 1Gbps per bit or 128GBps per stack for HBM, quite the massive difference on a device level. The lower clock speed means less heat, the architecture means a smaller footprint that can be made on an older die process and therefore save money.  In the end, we're talking about a card that will make better performance, at a lower power consumption, and friendlier heat profile and a similar price point to current GDDR5 cards. It seems to me that this is a win/win/win. A game developer that cant push 4k graphics on a 128GBps pipe shouldnt be allowed to make fart apps.   Also the implications for this architectures application in Laptops and mobile devices (APU's especially once the cost becomes amortized) is staggering for AMD's future."

tech,36hai0,Deltigre,2,Tue May 19 22:24:51 2015 UTC,This proposal is not viable for the vast majority of grid uses.   Transformers are one of the main sources of impedance on a network in order to maintain fault levels within the safe limits of switchgear. Were companies to go around swapping transformers for superconducting ones it would require a huge upgrade to all switchgear.   Modern transformers could already be built with significantly reduced impedances but generally they are specified to match the impedance of the existing one. They can't even be altered when switchgear is modernised as with increased levels of generation on networks is already causing significant increases in fault levels.
tech,36hai0,airija,0,Wed May 20 08:18:53 2015 UTC,"What we really need to do is redevelop the grid to dc, using dc to dc converters.  This will eliminate the frequency matching equipment needed now for grid interties, save inductive losses, reduce shock hazard (although arc and flash hazards increase and must be accounted for), and eliminate considerable waste heat.  It will also make incorporation of renewable dc sources such as solar panels less expensive.  It will take decades to do so, but the benefits are worth it."
tech,36hai0,IranRPCV,3,Tue May 19 20:24:30 2015 UTC,I thought dc to dc convertors used relatively similar electronics (IGBTs) with the addition of capacitors for the charge pump or to smooth out the voltage from a switched supply.   AC-AC phase connections seem to be a bridge built out of insulated gate bipolar transistors between the phases.   Incorporating DC sources doesn't seem like it would be much simpler because you'd still have to convert your output to match the grid voltage.    The few remaining places with local DC grids seem to make them look like a bad idea. http://spectrum.ieee.org/energy/the-smarter-grid/san-franciscos-secret-dc-grid
tech,36hai0,big_trike,2,Tue May 19 21:17:23 2015 UTC,"Europe is moving in this direction.  In the US, the power generated by Columbia river dams has been sent south to LA through a DC intertie, and has been in operation for decades.  It has been proven to be less costly in materials and footprint, and gives large savings from inductive losses that would otherwise be incurred.    Small local dc grids are already in use aboard ships with great success, and the pace of such installations is increasing."
tech,36hai0,IranRPCV,2,Tue May 19 21:46:44 2015 UTC,"That looks like more of a proposal than something that is moving forward.  The technology for an HVDC grid versus using it just for point to point connections seems very new and not well tested.  Multi-tap HVDC distribution seems to be in its infancy, and there's only 1 company making circuit breakers so far.  I'm not saying that we won't get there eventually, but I think it's going to take some time for the technology to catch up before it's cost effective to convert the entirety of the grid over.  It looks like we'll probably see more HVDC point to point connections first. Newer semi-conductor gates are decreasing the price for DC-DC conversion, AC-AC phase matching, and AC-DC conversion, so we'll probably see a much more diverse grid in the near future."

All our employees have macbooks and iPhones that they take home and can use for personal purposes as well. A lot of services that we use can potentially track these devices.  For example we use Google Apps for work, I believe tracks the location where a user has been logged in to their account (also for phones and private computers) by default. See https://maps.google.com/locationhistory/b/0 it also tracks your search history if your logged into Google with your work account.  We use Munki tools that allow us to update our laptops remotely. This also shows their current IPs and can therefore give a rough indication where the user is. We use Apple's device management Tools that allow us to do something similar.  You can also use theft prevention tools like Prey https://preyproject.com/, this allows locating devices that have been misplaced or stolen. It also allows tracking and is invisible for the logged in users.  Basically if you are using a work related device and you take that device home you allow yourself to be tracked. This also holds for any work account you log into when working from a you personal devices.  Now I've disabled most of the features, like location tracking and history tracking for all my users. I'm not interested in what my users do. I am interested whether my co-workers can work efficiently.   I agree that being tracked is a reality in our society.

I'd recommend using a braindump, and getting them, and using a real source of teaching/information to learn what's relevant to whatever job it gets you.   Stupid places and stupid people think that just because you have those certs you know what you're doing.   The absolute worst thing you can do to yourself in IT is get a cert and think it qualifies you to do the type of work it's supposedly for.   Edit: Some companies actually require an A+. I worked for a place like that. They required an entire department of barely technologically literate people who were only tangentially considerable as IT get an A+ cert. None of them were any the wiser when it came to IT stuff after getting an A+ cert.   The Comptia certifications are literally the standardized testing of the IT world."

tech,36g0zg,TheProfessorX,1 point,Tue May 19 11:39:05 2015 UTC,"I'd work on getting certified in something more vendor specific.  I work in telecommunications.  My entire field runs on the equipment certifications.  For me, I might be certified in CS1000, SV8500, or CM 6.3.  Absolutely no prospective employer would hire me if I'm certified in CM 6.3, and they have a CS1K switch.  The underlying technology is identical, but the deployment/support is extremely different.    Being specialized in one subset of a field will limit your employment options, however, there is a smaller qualified applicant pool.  Salaries in my subset range from about 55k entry to 200k for the most experienced engineers.   If you're interested in MS systems, check out their certification paths.  I have the MCSE which is a huge resume booster, as employers can obtain partner status and reduce costs by having me around.  MS is a good starting point because the study material is easy/cheap to find and most of the business world uses AD/Exchange so finding jobs aren't too hard.  You could always start with that and branch out.   edit Just keep in mind that at some point certs will become a burden.  Right now I'm studying for 7 different certs that are due to expire soon.  They open many doors, and create many headaches."

But instead of using only a password to use the keyfile, you use a hashed combination of   a password mood detection (I'm assuming here that everybody has a personal sort of 'fingerprint' in terms of mood detection)   the keyfile can only be unlocked by the correct combination of the correct password, and your personal mood, which has to be relaxed.  This way, you cannot extract the password from somebody that is under stress. aka: nobody, not even the government, can pressure you to hand over your data. Even with legislation that would force you to hand over your password, the government can't compel you to be ok with them accessing your data.

tech,36c2c5,delfinom,8,Mon May 18 04:49:18 2015 UTC,"all builds shouldn’t be done locally but sent to some build server and the results downloaded   Yep, he definitely worked at Samsung.  I worked closely with Samsung on certain projects and have had some insights into their Build and VCS systems.   They have the most borked build system in existence, which is totally incapable of making incremental builds.   They refuse to make incremental builds because their projects are a collection of distinct projects and they're not interested in debugging issues that may occur due to binary incompatibility (what are the odds of that, when you're compiling everything from source?).  On a side note, I think this is why they send builds to a server, since full builds take fucking forever locally, whereas the blade server just takes a hour max.  Not only that, their versioning system is pretty poor.  They use Perforce, but ""use"" is giving too much credit to them.  Despite using a versioning system, they actually don't preserve commit history of projects.  Somehow they manage to squash the history and replace with a commit that says ""2015-5-18 version"".  Basically it's a equivalent of a tarballed archival system.  I'm not really sure who drives the devops related decisions in that company, but he's a blithering idiot.

Stuff like:   No version numbers for FW releases (""Marketing determines version numbers""). Different bits of code are all worked on by different teams, some of which are in India, some in Korea.  Then one guy who isn't familiar with any of it slaps it all together, bangs on a keyboard until it compiles, then sends it to partners.  Clearly NO testing is done; ""fixed"" issues are still there, old issues re-appear, etc.  Segfaults and kernel panics are common.

They just want to shovel it out the door in a lot of half-baked hardware items, many of which shouldn't have seen the light of day.

tech,369kan,ShadoWolf,2,Sun May 17 20:00:29 2015 UTC,"Titanium biocompatibility:       Titanium was first introduced into surgeries in the 1950s and used in dentistry prior to that a decade earlier. It is now extensively considered by medical professionals to be the metal of choice for prosthetics, internal fixation, inner body devices and instrumentation. Titanium is used from head to toe in biomedical implants. One can find titanium in neurosurgery, bone conduction hearing aids, false eye implants, spinal fusion cages, pacemakers, toe implants, and shoulder/elbow/hip/knee replacements along with many more. The main reason why titanium is often used in the body is due to titanium's biocompatibility and, with surface modifications, bioactive surface. The surface characteristics that affect biocompatibility are surface texture, steric hindrance, binding sites, and hydrophobicity (wetting). These characteristics are optimized to create an ideal cellular response.

My parents bought a set of encyclopedias (which cost like $2000+) so me and the rest of my family would have access to information. The ability to research topics and form opinions, etc, on our own.  This technology is like that, except it's always up-to-date. Those $2000 encyclopedias would, by their very nature, have misinformation in them as new discoveries were made, etc.  We also used to get current news from a newspaper, that was delivered once daily. That newspaper would be obsolete within 24 hours.  This service is not ""internet access"", it's a set of encyclopedias that is always-up-to-date, and a newspaper subscription that is able to update as frequently as needed (ie. in a natural disaster scenario, war, etc). That's a massive advantage in developing countries.  Stop thinking of it as ""internet"".

tech,365oga,LeeHarveyShazbot,5,Sat May 16 13:05:55 2015 UTC,"How would you suggest providing information someone wants when you only have a downlink with no uplink?  In order to request a specific page, you would need some sort of method to communicate back to the content provider to request that content, and satellite uplinks are expensive.  You could have a radio system to request pages, but at that point, you may aswell just transmit the pages via that same radio system anyway and leave satellites out of it.  What this provides is a cheap way to distribute important information across a large area (a large chunk of a continent for example) extremely cheaply, ideal for places that can't afford the infrastructure required for an internet connection.  It's really not that different to traditional TV broadcasting. In fact, it's pretty much a modern take on Ceefax.

tech,365oga,MINIMAN10000,10,Sat May 16 20:04:33 2015 UTC,"Because it's facebook breaking net neutrality where they provide free internet so long as it's to facebook and the websites that they said are ok.

tech,365oga,LeeHarveyShazbot,6,Sat May 16 16:32:34 2015 UTC,That is different from this in what way exactly?
tech,365oga,MINIMAN10000,12,Sat May 16 16:33:12 2015 UTC,Where internet.org is a restricted internet but still internet in the sense that you can send data back and forth there's no reason for it to be restricted because requests can be sent and responses can be made. This is different in the fact that there is no back and forth it isn't the internet as we know it. Similar to turning on the radio and listening to information but they have to limit the content because you can't broadcast all of the internet that is simply far to much data.  So while this satellite internet is still restricted in its content it is a limitation created by its nature.  internet.org's limitation is created for the sake of control.  Take for example the Keurig. Excluding the reusable filter you had to use the standard size kcup. Everyone was fine with this because it was specifically because you physically couldn't fit other forms of coffee.  But then the Keurig 2.0 came out and they restricted to only accepting Keurig's kcup and there was a massive backlash so large that the CEO announced they were wrong. The reason why there was a backlash was because this wasn't a mechanical limitation but a created one.
tech,365oga,Zouden,2,Sat May 16 16:46:54 2015 UTC,But what if the k cups were given away for free?
tech,365oga,LeeHarveyShazbot,-2,Sat May 16 23:30:00 2015 UTC,"Okay, limited by nature, but what you get to see is decided by others.  So, the end justifies the means or the means justify the ends, but only if it isn't facebook."
tech,365oga,MINIMAN10000,5,Sat May 16 16:56:21 2015 UTC,The difference is that one trades it's verbosity in order to minimize cost which is noble. Internet.org trades verbosity for control and ultimately profit which isn't noble. The nobility in their means is what justifies the ends.  Cost is a justifiable trade-off when it comes to third world countries.  Where as control is self-serving.

tech,365oga,MINIMAN10000,4,Sat May 16 18:04:32 2015 UTC,Net neutrality is only enforced within the united states to those under title 2 e.g. common carrier. So while this limited internet goes against net neutrality nothing stops them from doing so.

tech,365v01,urbeker,7,Sat May 16 14:44:57 2015 UTC,"They say the load is ""active"" so they can control the current through the coils in the generator and hence the resistance to movement. This could stiffen up the tower to the point where it wouldn't be damaged.   Normal wind turbines actually have brakes as well, and tilt (feather) the blades to reduce efficiency.

When driving conditions are optimal and the road stretches out ahead, the Inspiration Truck's driver can set the Highway Pilot and tend to other parts of the business of logistics.  At its unveiling today, the Freightliner Inspiration Truck became the first commercial truck to receive an autonomous vehicle license plate in Nevada, not coincidentally also the first state in the US to approve and regulate the use of autonomous vehicles.

tech,3625am,SleepWouldBeNice,3,Fri May 15 14:45:08 2015 UTC,Depends on the accident.  I would guess since the freightliner isn't fully autonomous and expects to have a driver behind the wheel at all times  that the driver will take the blame and have to prove that there was a malfunction in the system that prevented them from regaining control.

My worry is that such scheme of strictly control on water access gain more widespread support and get used in places with naturally occurring water.   For example, a company could lobby a government to grant it extensive water reserves (so it can sell the water in the market), and control the access of the population to something like 30 liters per day. That's the business plan of Nestlé and other companies.  Fighting against such scheme becomes harder when there's a large population already used to a strict control on water access."

I'm not sure about innovative though... smart card-based water dispensing systems and water meters were used in this manner 15 years ago.  There are current metering systems in India, China, and even North America (and yes, these are metering systems with volume limits, not ""pay as you go"" systems).  Granted, most systems have traditionally been aimed at bulk water dispensing, but there have been some focused on individual water rationing too."

A broad use of the term innovative, but a fair one I think.  It's very original for that part of the world especially since I'm sure power distribution is also a part of the problem."

tech,35y1im,happyscrappy,1 point,Sat May 16 03:00:10 2015 UTC,Yeah first time I read about this kind of tech was a long time ago. Sure things are happening to make it more viable but we are many years until Intel and AMD release x86 consumer CPU:s. Not like the CPU is the bottle neck in most consumer PC:s anyway. But if it could help speed up GPU:s it would be great.  And also mobile market could benefit from it since it should need less power. But even there it seems like it is not the CPU that draws most power but screen and any wireless data.

Take a look at this map. The US could produce much more Watt per area than Germany and would thus get much higher return on investment than what you see in Germany. Also, the installed base of solar power in Germany is partly almost a decade old already and PV panel efficiency in production has been increasing over this time. In other words, you'd get much more bang for your buck if you build a PV plant today then what's installed in Germany on average.    Re: your criticism of ""only 17% renewables"" in Germany:   This and this is how typical german rural communities looks from above - you can't really blame us for not using solar much.   This and this is what our countryside looks like and this and this is how our coastline looks like, so you can't blame us for not leveraging wind energy either.   Roughly 1.3GW of hydroelectric powerplants were constructed over the last decade, however, ther is not much potential for further expansion.     So what exactly are you criticizing?

Shoving a bunch of solar in the south coast and building high voltage AC powerlines to connect to the north or concede the same efficiency there as in Germany?  I don't really see how anything that you said solves for cost. Perhaps you get incremental efficiency with areas with more sunlight but is this enough? I don't think it would drop prices sufficiently for the general population to accept higher prices. I don't foresee the political will for this.  Lastly I know what Germany looks like. Penetration and land use for solar and wind is high yet still total contribution to the grid is between 15-25%. How do you scale further?   If scaling past a quarter (and let's ignore the problems this causes to the grid) is difficult, how is this translatable to the US in any significantly different sense? Particularly when you factor in electricity consumption per capita in Germany (low) vs the US (high)  When you factor in te grid you need more flexible / variable sources to adjust to the capacity of the renewables. This means more coal and gas. Despite improving renewable penetration in Germany, green house gas production hasn't moved in tandem for this reason.  What problem exactly are we solving here?"

Aluminum oxide and graphite (read: dirt cheap) batteries that can charge to full capacity within a few minutes are soon (as in the next 2 years) going to be at a scale that can efficiently power tractor trailers and cargo ships.

Long term storage is insanely difficult and not very efficient, the best option we have is pumping the water up a big hill and then using a water turbine which is horrible for efficiency.   You also have line transmission issues which means in places like Seattle or really anywhere without over 200 days of sun a year your just fucked with insanely high power bills compared to other places.  Granted you can build more efficient higher voltage lines, but it would require a huge rework of the grid and cost a huge amount of money, but that still means insanely high rates in places with less sun to recoup the costs."

The grid, as it stands today, can easily handle 10-15% solar without adding more than a couple hundred MWh of additional storage, which isn't all that pricy in the long run.  In 2014, we generated a bit over 18 tWh of energy from solar.  That is about 0.45% of electricity in the US.  That number can go to 10% before we need some cheap or exotic storage solution.  So yes, it's a problem, but no we don't need to artificially slow down growth in solar because we haven't come anywhere close to the problem actually being a problem yet."
tech,35r5cx,nschubach,2,Wed May 13 05:59:04 2015 UTC,"Its not that, the problem is that the places where solar can be well utilized have little need for the extra power, its the eastern and northern grids that need the extra power neither of which are good locations for solar power.  If you were going to do large scale solar about 90% of it would be done in arizona, texas, etx where you have stronger sunlight and much less rain/cloudcover.  Arizona already produces a huge amount of solar with some very large solar plants, but there is no reason to build more at the moment when the extra is wasted due to no way to transmit it where it is needed."

We lowered the price and the buyer bought the panels.  Next, the bank had to do an appraisal, and they needed to take photos of the house WITHOUT the panels.  We had to call the company to temporarily remove the panels.  The charged us a good amount per hour.  This literally extended the time it took to sell the house by about a month and a half.  The buyer and our family was freaking exhausted, and we're probably not getting solar panels any time soon."

That's not an issue, but it's not something that's being planned right now.    There is just so much fear around them that most of which is unfounded.

It works even when something is wrong with the server, or it's intentionally offlined.

tech,35q8i6,GrzegorzWidla,1 point,Wed May 13 14:18:51 2015 UTC,"P2P is better in every way for the user.   Hah. That's not even funny.  What about all your devices ringing at once? You realize that central server can signal which device you are using or inform other devices that you have answered? And newest Skype clients do that.  What about history of calls, messages, shared files and images? You open your phone and none of that syncs.  How about group communication? Skype for Business supports call for up to 10000 users at once. What peer to peer grid will handle that?  What about Google Hangouts like experience where you can stream and record calls for future sharing?  Tell me more about how it's for user in every way.

As for syncing, you can do that without a central server, all you need is a virtual network.   Skype for Business supports call for up to 10000 users at once.   It does? How would anyone be able to make themselves heard over 9999 other people on the line? Whatever, I guess that's one niche advantage to central servers.   stream and record calls   Why would that require a cental server?   Skype has never been down   It's not about whether it has, it's about whether it could. And the answer is yes, of course it could.  The way I see it, a central server is useful for two things: large group conversations that would overburden individual clients, and holding messages that couldn't be recieved because the other user didn't have his client running. But that's no reason to route everything through the server, just have it switch to it in those cases."

All major software products offered by MS will transition to the service model.  There is a tremendous number of users who purchased a Windows PC/device and will continue to use it for many years over without ever upgrading to a new operating system, just like there are people who are still using Office 2007 today.  Making Windows and their other products a service ensures that these people have to pay their monthly/annual MS tax.  They will even bundle products together for a ""discounted"" rate.  Expect to see a home/college user bundle that includes Windows + Office 365 as well as a developer bundle that includes Windows Pro + Office 365 + Visual Studio Online.  Personally, I dislike it.  The incremental updates of Office and Windows are rarely worth the cost of upgrading to me.  I dislike how Microsoft has excluded other technologies in order to add value to the new operating system (see DirectX) and I really do not wish to associate my local user account with my Microsoft account, which I presume will be required.  In the end, this will cost me more money than I currently spend on Windows.  When this does happen, I am curious to see how Microsoft will handle update cadences.  So far, they have a fast/slow ring of updates but have not said how frequently these are updated.  How often do they plan to deprecate support for legacy hardware/devices or increase their minimum system requirements?  How will they handle pushing major revamps such as the shell UI?"

Canonical said ""no"" when I contacted them. There is certainly no way for a consumer to get support.    I've worked on a lot of weird hardware from tablets to laptops to desktops and even the touch screens worked without any intervention which was pretty amazing.   I've consistently had problems with wireless cards on every single system I've seen. Also problems with motion sensors for orientation in tablets.

Windows is old and inefficient. The only two things that windows has over alternate operating systems, such as linux and OS X, is an incredibly large and stubborn pre existing user base and a back catalogue of old programs. This causes a large bias in the development of new software/hardware towards windows. Which, funnily enough is the exact opposite of what's happened with their phone distro.  Windows is in dire need of killing off or replacing.

New jobs. Cleaner jobs maybe.   But in the end... the reason that we all have to work to deserve participating in society was born in a time where there was more work to be done than people who could do it. If some did not work, the work would not have been done fast enough (like gathering the harvest). Today there are way more people than we have work for. If some of them do not work, it doesn't mean that some work isn't done fast enough or at all. Our productivity has passed us on the right. We have to get used to the thought that there might be people who just take from society and don't give back in a manner that we see as productive.  Freed from the strains of having to work for one's subsistence we tend to be more productive and - what's even more important - creative. Imagine Leonardo Davinci would have had to work (that is: clean toilets or, to be on topic, drive people around) 50, 60, 70 hours a week to just be able to afford the least necessities to survive. Would they have had the time to become some of the most famous artists, masterminds and creators of their time and ours?   It's a misbelief that people immediately stop working (that is: doing anything for society at all) once they don't have to anymore. Maybe some. Maybe some more, but most of them will very quickly conclude for themselves that just hanging around doing nothing isn't what they expect from their lives. I know that quite well. I've been doing this or quite some time during my studies and it gets pretty debilitating. After some weeks I started thinking like what the hell am I doing here? What have I been doing in the past weeks? I've just been wasting time. Nothing more, nothing less. A horrible feeling. And that's what will happen to most people after they realize that they would not actually have to work again. They will start working voluntarily and they will start doing the things that make them happy.   What better could happen to a society than people who happily and voluntarily do the things they love?   Yeah, I know, some of you will ask ""and what about cleaning toilets?"" - no one loves cleaning toilets (right?). Some jobs would have to be provided with benefits that come close to doing the things you love. A prospering society of mostly happy and unburdened people should be able to afford that and the few people that simply don't want to do anything (i.e. live and die wasting their time)."
tech,35l3gg,SeveQStorm,17,Mon May 11 17:46:44 2015 UTC,"I've just been wasting time, nothing more, nothing less   But see, that's exactly how I feel about working.

tech,35l3gg,greenshrubbery,15,Mon May 11 19:13:57 2015 UTC,"That depends on your definition of work. Our world's society would even benefit from those who do nothing else than travelling. They bring cultures closer together and maybe fill or bridge over cultural gaps.   It's not the individuals who have to learn from society. It's our society that has to learn and that has to adapt to technological and cultural progress. Our way of thinking about the value of a human being has to change. It's not just what you earn and what kind of position you have in a company. It's what you would love to give to society and what you can give that doesn't really take it out of you.   The society we live in today consists of many that give more than they can and get sick from giving, and of some that only take and take so much that they could never give it back to society even if they wanted to. That is completely ludicrous.   We need to learn to see the wealth in everything any human can happily and voluntarily give, even in the littlest things, and not just in the things we force him to do for less and less money. And we have to learn to accept those who don't have anything to give. We have to learn to accept them and the fact that we have to carry them, no matter what. We should! Yes, and we can!   Maybe we don't have the strength now because all we can do is think about how to get more from society, be it 1$ more to buy another pack of milk for the rest of the month, or 1 million $ more to buy another gold-plated Dodge Viper (number 13 in a row).   This way of thinking is what we have to get rid of. It's totally ridiculous and ludicrous that we try to literally create work where none exists just so some of us can do something for their money. Think about it! We create work that hasn't been there to let people do something so that we can give them money and don't have to justify for giving it to them without getting something back.

Just that we all deserve to participate (and most of us don't anymore have the time and power to actually participate because they have to do two or three jobs simultaneously to see the family through)? Or wouldn't it be better to have a majority work happily and voluntarily the way they want in jobs that they love and hence be overproportionally more productive and creative while those who can't (due to some disabilities or just a lack of qualification) or just don't want to are accepted like anybody else?   I know, that sounds like I'm forgetting about those jobs that nobody likes to do. Like I said somewhere above, those jobs would have to be specially rewarded or something.

tech,35l3gg,DrSandbags,73,Mon May 11 13:26:04 2015 UTC,"According to the BLS Occupational Employment Statistics Query System, as of May 2014, the latest data available, in Idaho there were 12,080 people employed as ""Heavy and Tractor-Trailer Truck Drivers."" If you want to include the categories ""Driver/Sales Workers,"" ""Light Truck or Delivery Services Drivers,"" ""Taxi Drivers and Chauffeurs,"" and ""Motor Vehicle Operators, All Other"" under the broader ""Driver/sales Workers and Truck Drivers"" category, it's 19,180.  Total employment was 628,140.  Thus the fraction of semi truck drivers in Idaho is about 1.9% of the workforce, and in the broad category it's 3.1%. You're really going to have to come up with some compelling empirical evidence that:  1.) Truck drivers will become permanently worse off either through permanent unemployment or permanently lower wages, and this drag on 1.9% or 3.1% of the workforce will reverberate throughout the economy.  2.) The resulting gains in efficiency will not outweigh the temporary or permanent loss in whatever you think society stands to lose by this.  I highlight compelling because it has not been the experience of the American economy that people unemployed for technological reasons were made permanently worse off. Employment and income have weathered many technological changes throughout Western history. Your extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence.  Also, Idaho's headline unemployment rate (U-3) is 3.9% and the U.S. is 5.4%. Those aren't particularly high. U-6 is always higher but that has been dropping since the trough of the recession."

The economy will not be able to absorb the drivers, sales people, manufacturers (what little remain), lawyers, doctors, etc. that are being put out of business by increasingly sophisticated automation and AI technologies.  Many classes of jobs, some sooner, more later are going away and the only people that will be able to make money are the owners of the robots."

People always point out that such-and-such job couldn't be automated without realizing that the Great Depression happened with only 25% unemployment at its peak. Only a minority of jobs needs to be automated in order for it to cause a huge disruptions.  Most jobs that people do don't require general AI levels of intelligence. Narrow expert systems work just fine. For example a self driving car doesn't need to be able to ponder the meaning of life in order to work. The types of jobs that would require a high level of general AI intelligence to automate would also require a lot of training for humans to do with would make them unsuitable for employing a large number of people.  Looking at your example, how would out of work truck drivers become doctors and lawyers?  How would they pay for the amount of education needed to become a doctor or lawyer? Even if our political system does a 180 and all education becomes free, by the time a person studied and trained to become a doctor or lawyer, those professions would be within years of being mostly automated too."

I own a car for convenience. I can step out into my garage and go. If I can call a car and have it in my driveway within 5 minutes, this might be convenient enough.  Lets do the math on what my savings would be. I'm notoriously cheap, so this interests me. I (1) buy used @3-4 years old and (2) own my car outright and (3) drive it basically into the ground, or roughly 10-12 years after purchase. So far I've managed with 4-5 cars to make the cost of just owning the vehicle about $100-$150 a month. It gets complicated when you factor in insurance and maintenance, but it's roughly in that window. Fairly cheap. (I current own a 2008 Ford Fusion I expect to drive for another 5ish years) This commuter vehicle drives maybe 1000 miles a month. So, 10/15 cents a mile for that, and another 9-13 cents a mile for gas depending on the cost of gas ($3 per gallon/30mpg) , so somewhere in the range of 22-28 cents a mile if we kind of average that out. (regression fallacy could apply  I assume, to some extent that self-driving cars/taxis will be:   A lot more efficient (drafting, consistent style of driving, speed control) Potentially electric (swap batteries) and therefore cheaper per mile to operate (3-5 cents a mile) and maintain (electric engines are pretty reliable) Flexible in terms of the amount of space they provide. If I'm commuting, I may only need a two seater. That saves weight.   So, I can't really say for sure, but if electric cars were in the range of 12-15 cents a mile retail to operate on a profitable basis, we could see them take off.  From the consumer standpoint I'm going to get back some space in the form of my garage. And I imagine I would be able to rent different types of vehicles. Lets say I need a pickup truck to run some dirt around. Need a van/SUV for extra kids? Now I can call that on a per-needs basis? Nice."

If we need to teach 12 people how to do that, and each one works 2 hours a day, that's a upfront cost of 12X, plus the fact that people make mistakes, and having 12 people do one task, means that there are 12 links where errors can occur. These 12 people also need to spend far more time analyzing what the previous person has done, so that they can continue the work.  I think we need to start viewing jobs as something far broader. When 50% of the workforce doesn't have to work, they can do other things. Volunteering is a great example, improving society in various new ways could be another.  People do amazing things when they have spare time. Creativity flows, and ideas blossom."
tech,35l3gg,Yasea,8,Mon May 11 14:13:35 2015 UTC,That's an interesting way to look at it but I don't know of it can work that way. The endless march of automation doesn't uniformly effect the job market. The last jobs with humans doing them will be the ones difficult to automate and will require a special niche skill set and most people will not be able to do them. Low skill jobs go first and to a degree already have. We already see that driving jobs are going to be gone very soon thanks to self driving cars. We can assume other self driving vehicles will follow. I doubt the FAA and equivalent bodies will allow totally pilotless commercial aircraft any time soon or ever but the military is looking to do just that and Amazon wants to use drones for delivery. Point is aside from I predict technicians for this hardware and Tue engineers and scientists who development them most other jobs will become obsolete and the pace will increase. With a decrease in the needed size of the workforce jobs will be very competitive and only the most qualified will have a job leaving everyone else without one.

Funny how the 3 nations that use the first-past-the-post voting systems, all seem to shit on their workforce. Production is up, wages are down, and work hours are stuck.

Not really, in terms of laws we're far closer to the EU, and if you don't know why, you need to read up on your EU politics. Our language and social structures are more similar, but our rights are far closer to European, as I outlined in my other response to you.   They use the same voting system   That we invented and passed on to the US, that's the US being more similar to us.   they are extremely conservative   Nope. Our left wing parties got a significant portion of the votes, and we're far far more socialist than the US, on par with the EU.   they would rather have people work more hours   Also not true. In fact, we are 14th best up with the rest of the EU nations. 200 hours per year less than the US on average in 2013. We also have the most mandatory paid leave days per year in the world.

Hell, the conservatives just won a landslide victory   No, it was not a landslide victory. Stop with this misleading, lying, spin. This JUST happened, so the data is easy to get.   First, a landslide is not 331/650 seats. That's just over the 50% minimum required. That's barely a majority government.

So much for ""very right wing"". Our last government was a left/right coalition.    Privatizing the NHS, removing the human rights act, and getting out of the EU.   Our government received just 36% of the votes to get into power and will do those things. They don't have a majority support on all of the issues. They will do it, yes, but they only represent 36% of the population. Only the EU issue has such obviously large support.  By this alone, 7/10 people are happy with the NHS. Need I go on? 7/10 matches pretty fucking well with the 3/10 that voted in the Tories (and even then, I've yet to meet a single person who wants it abolished here).

It won't happen, and it doesn't happen.  When I work on a project to automate a manufacturing plant, they NEVER reduce headcount. What happens is that the lines become more efficient, and now they make more product with the same number of people. Now instead of 10 people to run 1 line, they have 10 people running 2 lines.

If it isn't a gradual transition (and going by things like smart phone adoption it's going to be anything but gradual) and if it isn't a well managed transition (how has your country managed recent serious changes in the economy?

Moreover Americans have a unique love affair with the automobile that isn't found in other countries; I think it's going to be a very slow transition.

tech,35ee38,SplyBox,17,Sat May 9 21:02:29 2015 UTC,"Phone camera's these days are getting really good, The Galaxy S6 and the LG G4 have cameras that take better looking pictures than a Point and Shoot."
tech,35ee38,coder543,10,Sat May 9 21:37:38 2015 UTC,Not every point and shoot. Have you seen the RX100III? Even the original RX100 dutifully stomps the GS6 and G4.
tech,35ee38,HaMMeReD,8,Sat May 9 23:32:52 2015 UTC,"I have a RX100-3 and while it's a point and shoot, it's sensor is far to big to be compared in the same league as cell phones. It's also as expensive as your flagship phone, ~$800.  That said, I fucking love the RX100-3, it's a amazingly good camera for it's size. I wouldn't call it a point and shoot, more like a prosumer or mini bridge camera."
tech,35ee38,coder543,5,Sun May 10 01:06:46 2015 UTC,"I agree. It's far more like a DSLR packed into a compact, pocketable form factor, and it's awesome. But, in the context of this discussion, I figured the primary criteria for point and shoot was something that could fit in your pocket, and the RX100 series does do that."
tech,35ee38,HaMMeReD,6,Sun May 10 01:12:09 2015 UTC,"Fair enough, I don't know if the spirit of the argument was $900 point and shoots though. I think it was more implied that your $300 point and shoot with a 1/2.3"" sensor was rivaled by cell phones that are starting to reach similar sizes. The s6 and g4 have camera's between 1/2.5"" and 1/3.0"", so technically they are in the optical realm of point and  shoots now. The RX100 rocks a 1"" sensor, so a lot more resolution, it also rocks really high quality optics.  It's really in a league it's own, far beyond your typical point and shoot."

And there are ~$300 point and shoot cameras that are still better than the latest and greatest smartphones in picture quality, and with features like 30x optical zoom, in crazy compact form factors.  The point and shoot may be dead for most of the market, but that's just because most people are willing to settle for whatever their phone has, and that's fine for them, but when a smartphone can only have about $30 of the BOM allocated to the image sensor and optics, it won't be better than a decent point and shoot, although I will admit to being pleasantly surprised at how good the latest crop of smartphone cameras are."

tech,35ee38,coder543,3,Sun May 10 01:09:34 2015 UTC,"I never said that everyone does? I just said that the RX100 series cameras are far superior to smartphone cameras. They aren't even on the same level, the RX100 series is so indisputably far above in image quality, especially for anything requiring decent depth-of-field, action photography, or night photography. A 1-inch sensor, a size several times larger than a smartphone sensor, can do wonderful things, and they still fit in your pocket."
tech,35ee38,SplyBox,1 point,Sun May 10 00:59:37 2015 UTC,"I would hope an $800 camera would take better pictures but most people would buy a ~$200 canon or Nikon; but with the cameras that the iPhone 6, the GS6, the G4 has, no one bothers buying point and shoot cameras.  Most people buy a point and shoot camera because they want a camera to take pictures during their vacation, or some other reason. They don't really care about the picture quality as long as it doesn't look like it was taken from a potato when they upload it to Facebook.   Give them a smartphone that takes pictures comparable to a ~$200 camera that they would buy and takes 5 seconds to upload to facebook? That's an easy guess on what an average person would do."
tech,35ee38,coder543,6,Sun May 10 01:15:16 2015 UTC,"This is a $228 camera that should still take better than iPhone 6 / GS6 / G4 pictures under the most smartphone-favorable of conditions, and then it still has 30x 20x optical zoom.  It also has built-in WiFi, so it can quickly and seamlessly transfer photos over to a smartphone, even in the middle of a field with no computers in sight. My RX100II has the same WiFi feature, and I can attest to how quick and painless it is to use, at least on Android. The times I've tried to use it on iOS have been less seamless, due to limitations in the APIs that Apple exposes to developers. (on Android, it automatically finds and joins the secure WiFi network broadcast by the camera, completes the transfer, and then disconnects and rejoins your previous WiFi network.)  I'm not saying that everyone needs a better camera than their smartphone can provide. Most people probably don't. I'm glad they're happy with their smartphone cameras, but that doesn't mean point and shoots should be dismissed so casually at this point.  A point and shoot dedicates a maximum amount of its BOM to the image sensor and optics. A smartphone cannot do that, since it is worried about being a good smartphone more than it is worried about being a good camera. Certainly, customers have spoken, and manufacturers realize how important a good camera is on smartphones, and so they have tried to be accommodating towards that."

Read more at: http://phys.org/news/2015-05-thin-flat-lenses-focus-sharply.html#jCp  Seems they can be stacked, and they are extremely thin. Should be able to make a set of glasses with that, no?

The wind and solar market isn't as large as that yet. I would definitely believe however that those industries are starting to push for large, static storage solutions. High capacity smartphone batteries are cool and all, now try and power a house with it.  If you ask me, I think inertia based devices such as a Flywheel are the way to go if it doesn't need to be mobile. Seems like the chance for failure in the device would be much smaller than batteries which can degrade, leak, and/or explode if used too much or damaged. Also seems like it would be much more compact than a similar sized gravity based solution. It would be interesting to see if there is a solution where a substance is created using near pure energy (think oil) and is consumed to produce energy again and then the waste products get recycled into the system to create more of the substance once energy is added again."

But seeing as at this level of software development the ""Version"" number on the box is kind of arbitrary* what does it really matter? It is 100% marketing. Back in the late 90s Microsoft changed all of the version numbers of the Office products to match so that they could call it a unified suite.  Next year Microsoft could radically change Windows and just call it Windows 10.1. And then do the same thing in two years and call it 10.5.  I think the only reason that they've done what they've been doing for all these years is that it never seriously occurred to them that they could do something different. Conventional wisdom says that when you make big changes you increment the major version number.   If you type ver in a command window on my Win7 machine at home it comes back with 6.1, my Win8.1 work machine is 6.3."

tech,35ctk8,slvl,8,Sat May 9 15:19:28 2015 UTC,To those who say windows will have a subscription model I say MS doesn't need to.  Currently most people get Windows with the purchase of a new device (PC/laptop/tablet) and generally stick with that version until they buy a new device. They barely buy an update to a newer version. That won't change in the future and OEMs will still have to pay MS a license fee. Below the line there's virtually no difference in sold licenses. After the first year updates from older versions will also cost money. The only thing that will change that instead of those people having an outdated version of the OS after a few years they will now have an up to date version with all the bells and whistles.  MS will get additional income through app store purchases and Office subscriptions. For business users there probably will be little change from now.

Your entire misunderstanding indicates you didn't   Traditional desalination systems are expensive and require substantial amounts of electricity to operate, making them impractical for India’s remote farming communities. Instead, the MIT researchers designed a system that removes salt through a process called electrodialysis, using a series of electrodes and membranes to remove the salt. They added solar panels and batteries to run the pumps and charge the electrodes. Then, in a final step, they installed ultraviolet light arrays to kill any microbes remaining in the water.  The finished prototype is small enough to fit in a tractor-trailer and includes photovoltaic cells to supply the electricity. The system, when fully operational, can supply the basic water needs of a village of between 2,000 and 5,000 people"

It looks like they're just using solar panels to electrolytically pull out ions (solar panels are good at low-voltage high-amperage power so this is great use of what's normally considered a limitation) but they likely have filtration and sterilization ahead of this process.

You'd probably want to change your design to involve a heat exchanger so you wouldn't need such complex optics - just funnel in the light to a small area to heat up mineral oil or something similar and pump that around a circuit that would dump all the heat into shallow trays of water. Use the incoming water stream to cool the collector plates that the water will condense on then collect the runoff.

tech,3567qw,phsyco,6,Thu May 7 16:03:06 2015 UTC,How would solar panels be faster?  Converting light to electricity is very inefficient.  Using the sun to heat water should be extremely efficient.  So the same amount of light should be able to purify more water more quickly with a method that uses heat.
tech,3567qw,scswift,78,Thu May 7 16:43:25 2015 UTC,"The evaporation method is just distillation - the sun's rays have to convert the water to vapour so they can drift up and recondense on the plastic sheet, which takes quite a lot of energy. If this new system used a distillation process to desalinate the water you'd be right that converting the solar energy to electricity first would make no sense.  But this uses something they are calling electrdyalisis - presumably filtering the salt and other contaminants out of the liquid water without needing to vaporize it first. Therefore it's entirely possible this system can desalinate more water per unit of energy than a solar still - but that energy must be in the form of electricity.   Having a solar panel built in to provide that electricity is simply what makes this unit appropriate for rural villages that might not have good infrastructure. It's also good marketing, as it lets them say it's a ""green"" tech - but technically you could hook this up to the grid, or run it off a gas generator."

I think you should go back and read your post from a non-biased, objective stance and realize that you didn't say what you think you said.  Also, you can't turn any electric device into a solar powered device. This depends heavily upon the solar cells and whether or not there is a battery.  As for your complaints about ""how much solar output is required""... It seems you don't understand the underlying concept of solar energy. The device requires electricity. The batteries are powered by solar energy converted to electricity. The device does not require a specfic ""solar output"" and the output is less important at the solar level and more important at the battery level. If the solar cells can charge the battery with enough efficiency, and the battery packs are large enough and discharge slow enough, you can literally trickle charge the batteries while using them. There's always going to be a net loss of energy (because you are consuming it) during the usage.  This device in question (in the article) runs off of the batteries, and recharges those batteries with solar power. This device runs utilizing no other energy input other than the solar cells turning solar energy into electrical energy. It literally fuels itself with solar rays. I'm not sure what your problem is. It seems as though you have this imaginary bone to pick, but there are no bones here for you to pick.  That said, you can take your downvote and shove it up your ass (and yes, I know it was you).

This depends heavily upon the solar cells and whether or not there is a battery.   You can still power anything given the right setup though, which does not change my point.  The fact that it is solar powered says nothing about the useful applications of it.  Spend enough money and land and you can solar power an entire shopping mall.  That says nothing about the innovation of the technology itself.   If the solar cells can charge the battery with enough efficiency, and the battery packs are large enough and discharge slow enough, you can literally trickle charge the batteries while using them.    Exactly, bigger power requirements needed means bigger power output required from your fuel source in order to run without recharging.  Ie. More solar output is required for a device which consumes more power.

tech,3567qw,slyf,-2,Thu May 7 18:34:55 2015 UTC,"Why? It's a solar powered distillation setup that is not a solar still and yet fits inside the back of a truck (making it portable).  Traditionally if you wanted to desalinate water using compact equipment it was very energy intensive (reverse osmosis, thermal distillation etc) so you need a decent power source like a grid hookup or generators.   This system is electrically powered but derives all the energy it requires from the solar panels that come with it, so you can literally drop it into the middle of nowhere and it will start producing clean water from whatever groundwater you feed it.   The headline is a little sensational, but it's not far off - it is an achievement to make an efficient desalination system that is small and self contained that doesn't rely on a grid connection or a regular supply line of diesel fuel to function."

tech,354336,Kylde,37,Wed May 6 22:56:22 2015 UTC,I'd been wondering wtf AMD had been up to.  It seemed like their desktop CPU line was totally stagnating.  Hopefully they make a real effort at reducing TDP this time around.
tech,354336,aspbergerinparadise,31,Thu May 7 00:00:24 2015 UTC,"They do, looking at the slides: they want to increase their IPC with 40%.  Short explanation: A higher IPC will lead to the same performance at a lower clockspeed, so we'll see the same or higher performance at a lower TDP if AMD can deliver on this slide.  Long explanation: AMD currently has a horrible TDP, because they have to clock their chips so high to stay competitive with Intel (and it doesn't help they're still on 32nm while Intel is on 14nm). They need to clock their chips this high, because they have a really really low IPC (wiki) compared to Intel. Source: any single threaded benchmark in which a 2GHz Intel chip beats the shit out of 3.5GHz AMd ones.  Basically, AMD is in the same boat Intel was in with the Pentium 4: high clock speeds, high temperatures, but no great performance.  IPC is how 'efficient' a CPU is with its cycles. Due to how a superscalar CPU core works (and all CPUs these days are superscalar, it allows for more complex instructions, and higher clockspeeds), a CPU doesn't actually execute 1 instruction every cycle in msot applications. It only can do that in ideal situations.  For a simple example: say you have a CPU that runs at 3GHz, that should mean it can do 3 billion calculations per second, right?  Well, sort of: if you have a piece of code that just does 3 billion multiplications, it depends on the code itself (namely the data dependencies), and the CPU design how long it will actually take. In the best case scenario, if those are actually 3 billion independent multiplications, the CPU will do those 3 billion calculations in one second (plus pipeline depth * 1s/3.000.000.000).  But, if the result of one multiplication is dependent on the result of a previous multiplication (data dependency!), the code will run much slower on a superscalar CPU.  Why? Because a superscalar CPU divides the work of one instruction up into multiple smaller batches of work, which each smaller batch of work taking one or more cycles, this is called a pipeline. The advantage is that you can start an isntruction before the previous one is finished. But how longer this pipeline, the greater the impact of data dependencies: when you need the result of the instruction currently in the pipeline in the next instruction, you have to wait until that instruction has gone through the entire pipeline.  So say AMD has a pipeline depth of 10 (10 1cycle stages, to keep things simple) for multiplications (no clue if it's that long, but 10 is a relatively short pipeline depth), and every multiplication in our batch of work need the result of the previous one, eg:  result1 = a1 * b result2 = a2 * result1 result3 = a3 * result2 result4 = a4 * result3 ....   In that case, a CPU running at 3 GHz will not take 1 second to crunch throught the 3 billion mulptiplications, it will instead take 10 seconds: 10x as slow!  Now, say Intel has a 3GHz model with only a pipeline depth of 6, it will only take that CPU 6 seconds: 40% faster than the AMD CPU clocked at the same speed! What so what AMD is currently doing, is ramping up clock speed: They make a 4GHz version of this chip, so the difference with the 3GHz Intel model isn't 40%, but 25%. So it's more competitive in terms of performance, but at the cost of a higher TDP.  Intel's lead in both micro-architecture and IPC is why you see Intel CPU's with lower clock speeds than AMD models, even though you can easily OC every Intel chip to 4GHz.  This example is of course extremely simplified, and IPC is an average of this type of efficiency measured in standardized benchmark, and there's more to it than just data dependencies (branch prediction is also a big one: it's where the results of a calculation determines the code that should be executed, basically an if-statement).  But I jsut wanted to make this post for those that don't know about IPC and why it is so important to the TDP of a chip."
tech,354336,JustCallMeBen,4,Thu May 7 09:16:01 2015 UTC,"I just wanted to say that this was an excellent reply about IPC. Nice and nerdy enough to not skimp the details or sacrifice accuracy, but still low key enough that I could explain it to my friends without having them blank out.  You mentioned branch prediction as another indicator of performance/efficiency. Is there anything that AMD actually does consistently or significantly better than intel on? IPC is obviously not one of them, but processor speed and efficiency is more than just IPC."

Agree with what you say, but I'll add a nitpick here, to point out that when it comes to multi-threaded performance, it's a whole different story. If you have work that saturates your compute units (scientific computing, for example), the “fake” multi-core provided by Intel's hyperthreading will suffer immensely compared to the true multi-core of AMD CPUs."
tech,354336,bilog78,2,Thu May 7 12:18:51 2015 UTC,"I somewhat get the impression you really dislike HT? I have to disagree, some coutnerpoints that come to mind:   What do you mean by 'true multicore'? In case you mean the module thing they use: It sure is bringing more performance than HT does, BUT it's still not really multiple cores: from what I understand, a module has 2 parts for integer operations, but all the rest (FPU, and all SSE shizzle) is shared among the two 'cores' in the module. SO when doing FP operations, I think the performance is the same as with Hyper Threading. Note: this is based on what I read on their 'module' design, I might be wrong as I haven't seen extensive benchmarks on this. Also, I want to point out that Intel is NOT selling their Q-core chips with hyper threading as 8-core chips, so you can't really claim they are being dishonest or anything. Form personal experience I can tell you that in a lot of applications (for me compiling large projects, but also when I fooled around with MPI) HT actually does improve performance. These are of course applciations that have a a very mixed set of instructions, so not just FP or integer instructions. First link on google when looking for benchmarksconfirms this: http://www.extremetech.com/computing/133121-maximized-performance-comparing-the-effects-of-hyper-threading-software-updates Of course, as you say is true: when you truly saturate your CPU (eg using the FPU to its fullest extend with all threads, so no mixed instructions like in consumer applications or compiling code), HT is not going to improve performance, and the slight overhead HT introduces will actually lower your performance. Looking at the slides, it looks like AMD is actually introducing somwething that is the exact smae thing as hype rthreading, they're calling it SMT:   The Zen core will feature simultaneous multithreading (SMT), or the ability to track and execute multiple threads per core.   I think this is a good think: for most use cases HT is a win. For this few users that have use cases that suffer from HT/SMT, it can simply be disabled."
tech,354336,JustCallMeBen,2,Thu May 7 12:46:29 2015 UTC,"I somewhat get the impression you really dislike HT   “Really dislike” might be too strong, but I'm more a fan of “proper” multi-core. I understand the benefits it can gain for poorly written software that doesn't fully exploit the ILP offered by modern cores, but (possibly as a fan of “writing better software”) I'd rather have hardware developers focus on other aspects.   from what I understand, a module has 2 parts for integer operations, but all the rest (FPU, and all SSE shizzle) is shared among the two 'cores' in the module. SO when doing FP operations, I think the performance is the same as with Hyper Threading   Assuming you're talking about the Bulldozer and subsequent architectures, it actually depends on the width of the instructions. For example, with Bulldozer, if you're using (up to) 128-bit instructions (AVX), then the shared FPU can process both threads at once. However, for 256-bit instructions it'll preempt the full unit for a single thread at a time.   HT actually does improve performance   Of course it does. However, in my experience, you rarely get more than a 30%   Of course, as you say is true: when you truly saturate your CPU (eg using the FPU to its fullest extend with all threads, so no mixed instructions like in consumer applications or compiling code), HT is not going to improve performance, and the slight overhead HT introduces will actually lower your performance.   Exactly. In the end, it's more a matter of applications. But that's the thing, depending on your use case, a Phenom II X6 might be competitive with even a last-gen Intel Quad-core. Or it might get “steamrolled” ;-).   they're calling it SMT   Well, SMT is the generic term for hardware support for multiple threads per core. Hopefully they can design it intelligently enough to not suffer from the bottlenecking degradation of Intel's approach."

That was my primary justification for AMD, as the Phenom II was pretty close in terms of single core performance, and they had a strong advantage in multi core (they were already rumoring 6- core procs, which was ridiculous at the time). Additionally, AMD had a good track record of sticking with the same socket, which can reduce your motherboard cost over time.   This was a new DDR3 platform, supporting a strong, multi-core chipset, for a lot cheaper than Intel, at the time (Core 2 Extreme, plus more expensive and annually changing mobos). Unfortunately, TurboBoost and their superior fabrication process simply outclassed the excellent Phenom II, and the redesigned Bulldozer chip, although full of promises, fell completely flat, and was still outperformed by the Phenom II in gaming for several years.   My Phenom II x6 1090 over clocks extremely well, and is just one performance tier lower than the current Piledriver offerings, which operate at damn near 5GHz, with a massive TDP.

AMD is behind in this field, and their response has been much higher clock rates, which means higher TDP.  Cache Latency: presumably, the amount of time required to write to or read from cache, though I don't know enough to be sure.  Simultaneous Multithreading: AMD's counterpart to Intel's Hyperthreading; the ability for one core to track and process multiple threads at once.  If AMD can reliably make these proposed improvements, it would definitely have the potential to make them competitive again."

What are the ""great things"" that Intel introduced in the mean time? Itanium (there's a reason why it's mockedly called Itanic)? Larrabee, that was so horrible that even whatever they tried to recycle of it in the Xeon Phi was so horrible that it sucks even when programmed with OpenCL, a language designed for manycore hardware?

Yes, if you want to squeeze every last sub-percent of performance from your program you'll have to design your code around the shared resources usage, but that's also true for alternative approaches such as HT.   Larrabee was literally a ripoff of NVidia and ATi tech and died because nobody would license it to them.   What?

Yes, but developers seem almost opposed to supporting it. Phoronix has some amazing benchmarks that prove how powerful it can be when properly utilized, but the majority of benchmarkers out there use select applications that use less than half the chip's cores. I don't know for sure what would motivate all developers to use this, but I still think it's market share.   What?

I think HSA is gonna be the next big improvement from AMD rather than something smaller like multi-core, but I don't know if Intel will allow it to gain adoption. If it's gonna win, all Zen chips might need to include a decent iGPU. At 14nm, they might be able to fit one with their ~8-16 cores.   Again with this statement. What exactly makes you think that AMD CPUs require extra work from developers?   Really nothing more than the lack of support for their chips. Everywhere I look, software is still being pushed out that doesn't fully utilize it and it's frustrating because they could be so much faster (for free) if developers would just open their eyes.

tech,354336,Tizaki,1 point,Thu May 7 19:51:48 2015 UTC,"I understand what you're saying, but the thing is, AMD can't really gain the market share to drive the market a posteriori, because any time it threatens to gain market share Intel can just re-do the illegal marketing tactics it has used in the past to cripple them, and then pay the subsequent fines, which for them are cheaper than the risk of AMD gaining dominance.  Intel is interested in keeping AMD around, but no more than “barely alive”, and they have the capability to do so.  Concerning developer interest, most developers simply don't care enough about performance to hand-tune their algorithm for specific CPUs: they'll just roll with whatever the platform native compiler, or icc if they pretend to care, produces. It's ultimately up to the compilers to have proper support for AMD CPU quirks, much more so than the average developer. (Of course, Intel can keep making its icc compiler produce intentionally crappy code on non-Intel CPUs, and developers can keep being stupid enough to go with it, and AMD can do absolutely nothing about it.)  AMD still wins with the cognoscenti, as well as with developers that do care about performance enough to tailor their software for it. There's a reason why a lot of supercomputers are built around AMD rather than Intel …  Also, a nudge to developers can come from users too, if only they cared enough to complain when software performance sucks on AMD …   I remember hearing a lot about intellectual property and patent licensing being a large cause of Larrabee's failure.

Paribus will kick in and send in your request for the $1 discount, and then they drop the price to $25.

tech,352a7y,TrollingMcDerps,17,Wed May 6 14:39:33 2015 UTC,"Backstory on how they changed Fibre Broadband in Singapore:   Originally, there were three internet service providers, namely StarHub, SingTel and M1. All offered 1Gbps Fibre Broadband at an average of S$400/month.  Then comes MyRepublic, a new start-up company which gained marketshare by offering 1Gbps Fibre Broadband for as low as S$49.90/month. Even going to the extent of offering a S$200 rebate to cancel your current contract and move over to MyRepublic. A huge surge in signups overwhelms the start-up company.  The original 3 service providers (assumingly) loses marketshare, so in retaliation, M1 drops their price to S$99.90/month,  SingTel offers S$69.90/month for UNLIMITED data speeds, with at least 800Mbps promised at all times.  M1 drops their price even further to S$49.90/month to compete with MyRepublic.  StarHub drops their price to S$49.90/month to be more 'competitive' and offers a 1Gbps fibre + 100Mbps cable broadband plan for S$69.90/month   Now, in Singapore, everyone was basically forced to have a 4G plan. We had no choice whether we wanted to keep on having a 3G plan. They even attempted to charge us once for using their 4G 'value-added service' (VAS). A VAS we had no way of opting-out from, or ever informed existed.  This is the current change of data caps after forcing us to get a 4G cellular plan:    Per Month 3G monthly cap 4G monthly cap    S$38 12GB 2GB   S$58 12GB 3GB   S$98 12GB 4GB   S$205 Unlimited 12GB    We are constantly exceeding the puny data limit here and have to pay the ridiculous excess data charge costs. Hopefully MyRepublic, if their bid is successful, is able to change it like how they changed how we paid for Fibre Broadband."

Generally, this is solved by needing a pincode as well. (Which defeats the purpose of the pill in the first place.)  One solution could be a challenge-response system. (The door/phone/engine wirelessly sends a question, the device or pill does a calculation using its unique code and sends an answer.)  If both the question and the response are intercepted, one can figure out the mechanics and start reproducing it.  Sure, you can encrypt the transmissions both ways, unfortunately no encryption is impenetrable indefinitely.

As it turns out, that was accurate for a while, but it's no longer true. Military and civilian GPS have the same accuracy in space, but military GPS broadcasts on two frequencies and has a lot more error-correction. Anyway, here's a relevant quote from GPS.gov.   What About Selective Availability (SA)? During the 1990s, GPS employed a feature called Selective Availability that degraded civilian accuracy on a global basis.  In May 2000, at the direction of President Bill Clinton, the U.S. government ended its use of Selective Availability in order to make GPS more responsive to civil and commercial users worldwide.  The United States has no intent to ever use SA again."

tech,34zxj7,jac50,8,Wed May 6 08:13:26 2015 UTC,"That is true for most commercial gps systems for the average consummer. But high grade systems are not easily jammed, Keep in mind that the mormal GPS signal is 10 to 20 db below the noise floor. So in fact the noise is up to 10 time louder then the actual signal! It is basically someone whispering during a heavy traffic. However by leveraging correlation techniques, it is possible to recover the signal anyway.  Normal jamming rises the noise floor by some degee until your smartphone's internal gps correlation is overwhelmed. This does work, like you say.   But High grade like the ones used on ships ans airplanes are very hard to jam. Their signal recovery is far more capable. You would need a very high powered jammer for this"

tech,34zxj7,jac50,2,Wed May 6 16:50:30 2015 UTC,"For the most part they will have multiple antennas forming an array. Normally they form a circle and have one antenna in the middle. Number of elements vary between 4 and 7. By using a technique called beam steering you can change the receiving pattern of the array and basically a favor a satellite's direction that you want to receive, ignoring most of the jammer's signal. The Buzzword among GNSS is Controlled Reception Pattern Antenna, btw. Also the Antenna elements themselves are very different. Consumer grad antenna elements are almost exclusively passive ceramic patch antennas with a pretty much dipole like receiving pattern. ""Proper"" antennas have individual ground planes and some do use choke ring, why would they not? It is basically a polarisation filter and is very good at ignoring multipath issues. Others even favor helical elements.  Bear in mind, I never worked with military grade naval or aeronautic GNSS personally. All my information is based on research papers and some information might be pretty dated.  Also, most of the Anti-Jamming Capabilities are realized in the receivers, not just the antennas. For example high grade receivers use carrier wave correlation, not code correlation. That is an entirely different animal and gives the receiver a lot more leg room when it comes to SNR."

I don't fully understand it but the tech used with these types of displays have a fundamental problem with a small FOV. I think it has something to do with being able to project the image from the side, so you don't have bulky equipment sitting in the front of the device, and being able to bend or reflect that light enough to project it into the eyes. The problem is that with a larger FOV you have to bend the light more and you run into problems with different colors of light bending at different angles, the bent light getting less bright, or the size of the lens getting too thick.  So this isn't one of those small things that will get fixed with better optimisation at the end of development. It is a fundamental issue with the tech.

tech,34x18k,gamwizrd1,1 point,Tue May 5 18:42:34 2015 UTC,Taking off inefficiently is still more efficient than being unable to take off.
tech,34x18k,henry_blackie,2,Tue May 5 19:08:45 2015 UTC,"I understand what you're saying by using the word ""efficiency"" colloquially, but in the context of engineering,  it really should just be in terms of mathematics.  For example, the amount of energy expended per unit of mass during a takeoff.  Confining the space you take off from doesn't make the takeoff more efficient. It might make it the most desirable or the only option, but efficiency is not relative."
tech,34x18k,gamwizrd1,2,Tue May 5 20:09:20 2015 UTC,"I think the point here is that this device can minimize the low-efficiency flying as much as possible.  Since it is an airplane, it could easily take off and land one a plane, but also has the option of VTOL.  If they optimize the transition period, it could switch from VTOL to regular flight as soon as technically possible, making it an efficient VTOL vehicle as well as a planar vehicle.  What I'd like to know is if it can autorotate... that'd be a nifty feature if you lose power, as you could land pretty much anywhere with no engine power.  Power, of course, would still be necessary to tilt the wings into the appropriate position."

I loved the content, I felt like they nailed the kind of stuff TSS would have shown if it were still on the air, the segment on building a Raspberry Pi audio streamer was fantastic. The whole time I just wanted Leo to be quiet and let other people talk though, when Patrick was trying to explain how his Raspberry Pi device worked Leo couldn't seem to bear being off the camera while Patrick talked and kept jumping in with things that you knew were just about to be explained. I don't know what was going on in the MDC section about 35 minutes in where they cut to a pre-taped section, it seemed so bizarrely amateur, if you watch it I think you'll see immediately, who knows why they decided that part was good enough to put on the show.  I hope they keep up the hardware segment and keep Leo a little more in check for future episodes, and I loved the Hot Button segment at the end, it was the most TSS part of the whole show in my opinion. Hopefully they can get Martin Sargent on in the future, or get Kevin Rose and Alex Albrecht together again.   What surprised me the most is how little I've seen about this on Reddit. I was super excited when they announced it on the TWiT 10th anniversary episode and assumed that most of Reddit would be too, but does the audience for here skew so young that most people didn't even grow up watching the original any more?"

Whatever happened to the concept of multiple CPUs with diversivied tasks and software that takes advantage of it? I'm talking more server / desktop systems. I have shit loads of space in my desktop, and the CPU only takes up about 2 inches. Is there just no longer an advantage to having multiple CPUs? Is it perhaps too difficult to have software that makes use of such a setup?  It just seems that if you had 4 CPUs all working on certain tasks, speed would just explode. I realize tech is trying to make single CPUs as fast and efficient as possible, I'm just curious why there seems to be no market for multi's anymore, considering people still want faster and faster computers.

tech,34pzgg,9513574628,25,Sun May 3 18:17:23 2015 UTC,"CPUs take up even less space than you think: The AMD FX-9590 has 8 CPU Cores in a single package. In fact, nearly all AMD and Intel processors have between 2 and 8 cores, so we already have systems with multiple CPUs, just like you predicted. Also, both of the new generation consoles have 8-core processors. There are two big problems with multi-core (multi-CPU) programming: Process synchronization and heat dissipation. Developers are still getting the hang of 4- and 8-core optimization. It's very complicated. They're not yet ready for 12- or 16-core. The 8-core AMD FX-9590 uses 220 watts, which is around 10% the heat of a standard electric heater (2,200 watts). If it had too many additional cores, it'd generate too much heat."
tech,34pzgg,Flight714,9,Sun May 3 19:00:15 2015 UTC,"The other thing is if it scales to 8 cores, it probably scales to hundreds of cores and can be better written to run on the GPU. So there's only so many tasks that would benefit from going from 8 to 16 CPU cores."

Quantum computers won't have an ever decreasing transistor size, but they will lead to exponential growth.  Since there are more than 2 states for a quantum transistor (up, down, and up and down vs on, off) each new quantum transistor you add to a chain doubles its computational power (multiplicative increases with each new transistor instead of additive), i.e. with traditional computers if you have 5 transistors and you add a 6th, you go from 10 to 12 bits, whereas with quantum transistors if you have 5 transistors and add a 6th, you go from 32 bits to 64.  Quantum transistors won't likely ever be produced at the rate of silicon transistors; current processors have billions of transistors per chip, if we ever strung a billion QTs together we would have an unfathomable amount of processing power.  However, running 50-100 along with a massive processing farm could lead to huge efficiency boosts and open up interesting possibilities."

First of all, a classical transistor represents one bit of information, not two.  Secondly, you shouldn't really think of a superposition as an extra state, since you can never ""see"" it (every time you measure a qubit it will be in either 0 or 1 state). Superdense coding does seem to allow exploiting a single qubit and an entangled state to send two classical bits of information, but it's very limited since the entanglement is destroyed when you decode the qubit.  Quantum computers work very differently from normal computers and this kind of direct comparison doesn't usually work.

tech,34nx3f,foxh8er,32,Sun May 3 04:15:12 2015 UTC,"The main reasoning is:   There is this KISS principle which says simpler things are better. Mostly people agree with this. GNU/Linux's init system was originally very very very simple, and people liked it. But as distributions evolved and got more complex, they also made the init system more complex. To the point where instead of the simple bash commands, most of the scripts were custom commands from custom libraries. Even worse: if you didn't make use of this custom stuff, you lost on many of the new features of these distributions' init systems. So... people (applying the KISS principle) started seeing this as bad, and wondered how they could make the same in a simpler way. Thus systemd was born. But systemd is waaay more complicated than the original GNU/Linux's init system, so now there are people saying systemd is bad because of this. ...even if systemd is actually much simpler (better) than the plethora of distribution-specific customizations of the modern init system. And thus a fork of Debian has been created to maintain what they call the ""simpler"" way, which it only is if they don't use the custom stuff, which is kind of needed in any mid-complex distribution.   So, IMHO, systemd is here to stay, and there may still be a place for the old init in low complexity or embedded systems. In other words, the controversy is kind of silly."

The main problem with systemd is feature-creep (and the maintainers attitude towards it). One of the best examples is the logging solution that comes with systemd: journald, which does incredibly stupid things like logging in a binary format, that can break. Your server goes down and you want to know what happened? Just look at the logs! Oh...  uselessd looks like a sane variant of systemd, but it seems that it's not actively maintained."

I used polling of SysFS to get results, but HAL was the right way to do things, but it was still developmental at the time. In fact, I couldn't name a single bad thing about HAL, and I am aware of many projects which used it for things such as iPod detection. The only bad thing is that it wasn't maintained, and went to Devicekit after, and then was later replaced again.  I'm guessing you also were one of the vocal people in the community complaining about DevFS getting depreciated? Question is, do you actually know what you are talking about? I suspect that 99% of the people in the Anti-SystemD category actually don't have a low level understanding of why, and are simply scared of change..   Linux has come a HUGE way since it started, and all these new technologies have led Linux to be competitive (if Xfree86 had never been dissolved actually, we never would have gotten this far).

An no. I can't code systemd if my life depended on it.  But I don't need to know how to make something to know that it sucks. When it gets bloated to the point where it becomes unmaintainable, which should be around the time you get emiald, we will have to start from init scripts again without DE's because everything and their grandmother requires systemd as a hard dependency.   That's the reason why half of the contributors in debian lost their minds over this. Debian is meant to be the gold standard for stability, if they had waited till Debian 9 to move to systemd no one would have cared because in three years time we would know where the project was going long term. Right now we don't. And the leadership does not inspire confidence."
tech,34nx3f,nomoch,1 point,Sun May 3 14:21:13 2015 UTC,"Firstly if Debian is the gold standard for stability, consider the fact that init scripts are vulnerable to race conditions (because everything reacts to events these days), init scripts are a pain to write, and there is a lot of hackish stuff that happens in them. Also consider the fact that SystemD can reset hung services easily, and simplifies things a lot for developers and users (so, its actually very helpful for developers).    Yes, it is more ""bloated"", but the features are being used, and scripts are more reusable. So many concepts behind sysvinit feel hackish when you write one, and many layers have been placed on top of each other to hide the mess.   Xorg's main problem isn't the bloat, but that it sucks at displaying stuff onscreen. Wayland is getting rid of all the extra crap, because the window toolkits now contain the crap instead. Just because you break it up into 30 different projects though, wouldn't mean things are more efficient though (distro's will simply install those 30 projects instead).     Finally, LibHal may have been messy (as I saw on Wikipedia), but the only other option for people like me at the time was polling sysFS. Udev took ages to fully replace it. My feeling is that even if LibHAL wasn't as good as it should have been (I never got to the point of integrating it), that it, and the rest of the ""project utopia"" concept was a good way to show people what we were missing out on.   Part of the fight with Linux has always been convincing the community. Developers do a great job at hiding design flaws, but even those in charge of maintaining the init process (on most distro's now) have no problem listing faults with the traditional design."

While this sounds like a good thing, the big problem with no workaround is that systemd is non-portable.  systemd can only run on Linux. This means that all portable programs that start depending on systemd automatically become Linux-only as well. And they only work on Linux systems that have been re-architected to accommodate systemd.  One could say that they could just keep the dependency optional and have a fallback to portable code, but there's already an example of the single platform effect on pulseaudio (another Lennart project that's also Linux-only) -- KDE/Gnome depend on pulseaudio, and thus are no longer portable to other systems. While people can still somewhat run them on BSDs, it requires patching or reverting to older versions for some components. pulseaudio also requires ALSA, so a similar situation happens on non-ALSA Linux systems (e.g. OSSv4)."

This is basically launchd or windows task manager+   There has never been such an ecosystem attempted, because it has traditionally been (free) market pressure to bring packages into harmony and interoperability. Rather than fight it out, we now have systemd as an arbiter. If you don't play nice with systemd, you can't guarantee progressive interoperability. This is a bold and questionable approach. What's more, it utilizes a number of packages that make no sense from common use cases (ifconfig, now under systemd, because there are service interoperability cases where it might matter).   Why distros don't use their OWN systemd equivalent with their own interoperability standards is a matter of technical sophistication + time available from Open Source developers.

Windows calls them services, but windows services can also be normal processes. I'm gonna call them services, which is probably wrong on linux but it's easiest to understand.  SysV Init  Systemd  Anyway so a group of people decided that sysV Init, the software on Linux and UNIX that turns these services on when the computer turns on was too complex due to all of the custom software made for it. The game plan would be to scrap init and replace it with systemd, which is basically it's own set of services and software to manage all of it.   Problem is that another camp says that replacing Init with an entirely new system that is incredibly tied to itself, is a terrible idea because instead of having one ""simple"" technology that everyone already built on (and made complicated because of their own custom software). They're just creating a new complicated system that tries to be a Linux swiss army knife. Rather then getting a knife, you're getting the whole kitchen drawer, which means all of your old tools need to be changed as well.  Things like error reading are now harder because the files used to debug are now binary and not text.  Essentially it's criticized because you can't easily adopt part of it without adopting the whole, which critics believe is against the UNIX way, which is to do one thing and do it well. It also basically hurts crossplatform compatibility in a way because if you use systemd you're pretty much stuck with linux.  tl;dr Systemd is like svchost.exe on windows.  http://www.infoworld.com/article/2608798/data-center/systemd--harbinger-of-the-linux-apocalypse.html"

tech,34midh,Wannabe2good,3,Sat May 2 18:11:34 2015 UTC,"more Musk hype[1] . he's pretty good at it too   Yup, he could sell refrigerators to eskimos.  This particular thing, by the way, is ridiculously uneconomical.  The installed cost of one of these is STILL going to end up being probably around $10k.  Here's the thing, my average monthly ENERGY bill (natural gas heat + electric) is only around $100 ($1200 per year), and only about 1/2 of that is electric ($50 mo / $600 yr), and of that half of that is the monthly ""facilities/service charge"" ($25 mo / $300 yr)  -- i.e. my actual kWh electric bill is only about $25 mo or $300 yr.  No I realize that I am at the lower end of the spectrum -- I live alone, I practice energy conservation, have efficient appliances, have swapped out most bulbs for either CFL or LED, and so on -- but even still, most homes really don't have that much HIGHER electrical usage... nowhere near enough  to justify the cost of installing one of these systems.  So what does that mean? I think it's obvious -- just like with the vehicles from Tesla, and the solar panel systems from ""Solar City"" -- there's going to be a push to see these systems SUBSIDIZED.  As the Forbes article you linked to notes:    To get your real electricity cost, you have to add to that 15 cent battery charge whatever you’re paying for that electricity in the first place.    Ergo even if you think you're getting ""free"" electricity from solar panels -- well even there the power is NOT being generated for free -- SOMEONE is paying for the cost of that capitalized system (it may not be the end user, the cost may -- again like part of the cost of Tesla cars -- be shifted off onto OTHER consumers)...  But even in that case, these battery systems still have a HIGHER per kWh cost than I currently pay (even during my daytime ""peak"" rate costs).  Again from the linked article:    And here’s where the economics of the Powerwall break down. If you do not have a big enough solar system to get your home entirely off the grid, then there is simply no point whatsoever in paying 30 cents per kwh to get electricity via the Powerwall. At night, when you’re not generating solar power, you could simply get your electricity from the grid. For an average 12.5 cents a kwh.  I’ll say it another way: unless your solar-powered home is entirely disconnected from the grid, or your solar system is big enough to provide for all your electricity needs, an expensive battery backup system like Powerwall does not make economic sense.    Yup... and the only time THAT really makes sense is if you're in a remote location (where the grid don't reach), AND where you get sufficient sunlight -- IOW Arizona. (But then there's the drawback of living in an area that is fundamentally a desert -- meaning you probably USE more power just to run the damned AC and make the house ""livable"", something that is not necessary if you live elsewhere; but that elsewhere is probably not so solar-power friendly.)  Also, as far as the ""off-peak"" bit... well, I looked into something similar a few years back -- just ""on a lark"" so to speak, that since I have a ""time of day"" service, and get cheap (1/2 price) electricity during the night, well why not use that to charge some battery system, and then run ""minimal"" stuff off of it during the day?  Especially stuff that you KNEW would run during the day, every day (like my fridge).  Well it turns out that even using cheap ""commodity"" batteries, just trying to do that in a partial fashion -- enough to run my refrigerator -- ended up being a nonsensical thing, the juice from the battery during daytime (including amortizing the cost of -- a very CHEAP UPS battery system -- and BTW with zero ""installation/wiring"" costs, we're talking plugging a fridge into a UPS here, no electrician needed) would still have been more on a kWh basis than the ""peak"" rate.  Also, taking that same amount of cash -- what I would have spent on the UPS -- and buying a newer, more efficient (and better insulated) refrigerator... well it cut the power consumption by 1/3 from my previous fridge (and potentially even better if I could just learn how to NOT open the fridge multiple times during the day!)  What to my mind this all leads me to wonder... is why people are so ""obsessed"" over the cost of their electricity bills?  Realistically the stuff is incredibly cheap, and I am not aware of ANY case with ANY homeowner where their electric bill could really be considered a MAJOR part of their budget: invariably just about every other category of expense is higher, whether it be their monthly food or entertainment budget (especially if they have Cable TV), not to mention things like  rent/mortgage, or even just their local property taxes.  And arguably ALL of those things are a helluva lot easier to control (or at least are a consequence of choices we have made) -- and arguably most of them are of far less actual ""value"" than the monthly electric bill."

At best they tested the upper stage of a rocket with a mockup of the shape of their capsule which is designed to launch on a yet to be designed first stage for a yet to be built MethLox engine that according to ULA is still 4 years away.

It wasn't about relative latency, but absolute latency.  /u/Connador's comment was using the same false impression as me that Eve would operate by letting Alice send messages to Bob completely normally, but Eve would snoop the message going to Bob, modify it, and send the modified copy. The clear problem is that there would be two messages in-flight to Bob, unmodified and modified, which wouldn't work if you were trying to actually implement MITM.  In that scenario, moving Eve 3ms closer to Bob (what /u/Connador suggested) means Eve is also 3ms farther from Alice. It wouldn't solve the problem of racing Alice to get a message to Bob, because Eve would still have to snoop the message, modify it and send it to Bob, at which point Eve's message would necessarily be (at least) a couple ms behind Alice's original message.  The situation is irrelevant to this, though, due to the fact that ARP spoofing tells Alice that Eve is Bob, and tells Bob that Eve is Alice. Thus, MITM.

tech,34bmd6,airconditioningunit,69,Wed Apr 29 21:18:37 2015 UTC,This is probably the future of desktops for most people. Cool to see it finally happening (and would be a huge incentive to get windows phones if people can actually port android apps)
tech,34bmd6,claude_mcfraud,40,Wed Apr 29 22:09:36 2015 UTC,I have been waiting on someone to come out with something. I kind of figured it would be google/chromeOS that had the first one.  Hopefully this wont turn into one of those Microsoft flops and then 3 years from now everyone will be praising Apple for it once they announce the same thing.
tech,34bmd6,altrdgenetics,15,Thu Apr 30 00:09:57 2015 UTC,"It will never happen, because they can't charge you double for the phone, and they'd never sacrifice the opportunity to sell a Mac and an iDerp."
tech,34bmd6,HowAboutShutUp,5,Thu Apr 30 08:49:28 2015 UTC,I guess I don't really understand what advantage this would have over a tablet.
tech,34bmd6,whateversclever13,25,Thu Apr 30 01:39:00 2015 UTC,"Think about the office guys who have their laptops and then at the office they have their laptop docks. This would replace a laptop + dock in the long run.   One of our sales guys uses a Surface RT and this would be a perfect thing for him. He is mobile 90% of the time and this in his pocket while on his hustle and the ability to be full ""desktop"" the 10% of the time he is at the office.  And since it is not a full fledged version of windows and more like a Win RT it is why I fear an idea ahead of its time will flop now and then Apple will re-invent it later."
tech,34bmd6,altrdgenetics,12,Thu Apr 30 01:55:43 2015 UTC,But look at something like the Asus Zenfone 2 which has specs close to what a current netbook or something like the HP Stream 7 has and they run full blown Win 8.1. So it wouldn't be too far fetched to expect a reasonable experience.
tech,34bmd6,karmat0se,4,Thu Apr 30 02:16:28 2015 UTC,I am honestly really hoping. All of these things coming out of Microsoft sound great. I just want to remain a little skeptical.
tech,34bmd6,altrdgenetics,8,Thu Apr 30 03:09:10 2015 UTC,"Canonical is working on the same thing for Ubuntu phones I believe, so they might beat Apple to the punch on that one."

tech,34bmd6,fahmiiharder,2,Thu Apr 30 06:21:51 2015 UTC,[insert year] will definitely be the year of linux!
tech,34bmd6,Putzpie,1 point,Thu Apr 30 14:13:22 2015 UTC,I agree man
tech,34bmd6,CrypticCube,1 point,Thu Apr 30 15:45:30 2015 UTC,Well it could be the year of Linux. Even Microsoft is making applications for Linux. :)  I love BOTH!
tech,34bmd6,tophneal,3,Sun May 3 23:51:35 2015 UTC,"Technically, they did it before with Ubuntu on Android, but the need for a dock kept it in an unappealing light. Oh and it would only work well for a handful of phones.  Their current goal of the same Ubuntu for every device by  16.04 (pretty sure) will be nice."
tech,34bmd6,Putzpie,1 point,Thu Apr 30 14:53:25 2015 UTC,"Interesting, didn't know that. Good to know"
tech,34bmd6,Aan2007,-10,Thu Apr 30 15:45:59 2015 UTC,"the point is to use normal sized screen, keyboard and mouse instead of useless phone/phablet/tablet screens for work  you can do same thing already with Android anyway, just the apps will look quite odd on big screen (but for sure not worse than Metro apps)"
tech,34bmd6,Zouden,8,Thu Apr 30 02:24:21 2015 UTC,"Android sucks for productivity though. Scaling it up to a big screen doesn't change the fact that there's no right click, drag n drop or undo."
tech,34bmd6,bunchajibbajabba,2,Thu Apr 30 03:12:05 2015 UTC,"I think we'll see Android make this leap towards more desktop features in the future, hopefully. Actually, there's an app for that."
tech,34bmd6,Sacrix,-2,Thu Apr 30 05:22:14 2015 UTC,"Hopefully this wont turn into one of those Microsoft flops and then 3 years from now everyone will be praising Apple for it once they announce the same thing.   They will. It doesn't matter, the ignorant masses will remain ignorant.   Edit: Just to avoid any confusion, my comment was about the question of who was first. Not who did it best. Time isn't over yet, there's millions of years of improvement ahead of us. I genuinely don't care who's currently best at it, I just addressed the question of who was first and related it to mass ignorance."
tech,34bmd6,ScheduledRelapse,5,Thu Apr 30 10:21:19 2015 UTC,That will only happen if the Microsoft version is bad and the Apple version is better. It's not ignorant to want things to actually be good.   It's exactly what happened in smartphones and tablets. Microsoft got there first but there products were at best half-baked. Apple came in later with something more polished and better.
tech,34bmd6,steepleton,3,Thu Apr 30 10:38:20 2015 UTC,"have you used a windows tablet from the pre ipad era? because i have a £1800 toshiba swiveltop with a 3hr battery life that weighs the same as an encyclopedia that says ""hi"""
tech,34bmd6,Aan2007,10,Thu Apr 30 10:46:52 2015 UTC,"they need to resolve storage problem, you can't replace desktop with something running on 16-32GB memory, even if you add 64GB SD card (which you won't because sd card slots are not fashionable and it's better to milk sheeps by selling them overpriced ROM storage space) it's still not enough to store photos, videos and music, though some local external wifi hard drive could be solution"
tech,34bmd6,FRCP_12b6,14,Thu Apr 30 01:27:07 2015 UTC,"If it is replacing a desktop, putting 128GB of storage in it is a relatively small additional cost.  However, it is up to the manufacturer to price reasonably.  128GB of storage is not expensive, but that doesn't stop them from charging a lot for it."
tech,34bmd6,the_omega99,3,Thu Apr 30 02:45:59 2015 UTC,iPod freaking classic had 160 GB of storage years ago. Phones could totally do it if there was the demand for it.
tech,34bmd6,404redditornotfound,5,Thu Apr 30 07:36:09 2015 UTC,"that's the difference between 1.8""-hdds and flash storage. those hard drives alone have been as thick (5-8mm, depending on amount of storage/platters) as many phones today.  not that i wouldn't agree though, i personally do value storage over thinness, to some extent."
tech,34bmd6,ShadyBiz,7,Thu Apr 30 09:51:01 2015 UTC,There was also the reliability problem. A HDD is far more likely to fuck up than an SSD.
tech,34bmd6,FRCP_12b6,2,Thu Apr 30 12:03:05 2015 UTC,"That's a hard drive, so completely different technology.  But, 128gb ssds are under $100 these days..."
tech,34bmd6,Befriendswbob,18,Thu Apr 30 14:24:54 2015 UTC,That's what the cloud is for! For only $19.99/month you can let a third party manage your data for you!
tech,34bmd6,ShadyBiz,3,Thu Apr 30 04:19:01 2015 UTC,You actually get a decent amount of storage on onedrive free with a windows phone (unlimited with office365).  Not sure on the specifics as I've got grandfathered allowances already.
tech,34bmd6,CrypticCube,1 point,Thu Apr 30 11:58:58 2015 UTC,I think for some people it shows 1TB or 10TB but in reality it just expands as you gets closer to the limit.
tech,34bmd6,Aan2007,7,Sun May 3 23:53:39 2015 UTC,+1 for smart irony
tech,34bmd6,delfinom,2,Thu Apr 30 05:03:07 2015 UTC,Including the $10/gigabyte once the ISPs start metering your bandwidth!
tech,34bmd6,whateversclever13,13,Thu Apr 30 14:23:03 2015 UTC,"The problem isn't a technology problem as you've stated, it's a greed one. They're capable of shipping with larger storages they just choose not to."
tech,34bmd6,Stingray88,11,Thu Apr 30 01:40:08 2015 UTC,Yeah because everyone has perfectly fast and reliable internet access 24/7 and no data caps.
tech,34bmd6,lekingducheeseburger,0,Thu Apr 30 04:26:57 2015 UTC,"Why would you keep personnal critical data on your local machine? (homeworks, taxes, pictures, etc.?)  Music, videos, apps, games, etc.. can be lost and easily retrieved."
tech,34bmd6,AHCretin,6,Thu Apr 30 05:52:06 2015 UTC,"Why would I keep tax information (which, in the US at least, is pretty much all you need for identity theft) someplace that's almost guaranteed to suffer a security breach?"
tech,34bmd6,Stingray88,3,Thu Apr 30 11:51:29 2015 UTC,"So you're saying you keep personal critical information on the cloud where it can easily be obtained by others?  Yes of course I keep these things locally! I have a great backup system that I personally manage and thus I'll never lose anything. 4 copies, 3 different storage mediums, 2 physical locations."
tech,34bmd6,IIIMurdoc,-1,Thu Apr 30 13:40:53 2015 UTC,Ugh stupid pocket computer! Eating all the internet! Why can't free WiFi everyday?
tech,34bmd6,Sacrix,1 point,Thu Apr 30 15:20:00 2015 UTC,"Onedrive is where I keep all my stuff.   You like to not be in control of your own files and have Microsoft remove shit that's not compliant with copyright rules? Then by all means.  Edit: No tinfoil hat, dickhead. You don't have to believe me. Figure it out yourself. Microsoft can remove shit if they don't want it on their servers, and they have done so in the past. Plus, everything you give them is marketing material, you should know that."
tech,34bmd6,eerongal,3,Thu Apr 30 06:19:55 2015 UTC,"Dropbox has previously removed files from DMCA takedown requests from people's personal folders, and Onedrive has a similar DMCA policy as them.....  It's not a crazy conspiracy theory, it's something that has actually happened already. They compare the hash of everything you upload to identify these things.  http://www.zdnet.com/article/dropbox-under-fire-for-dmca-takedown-of-personal-folders-but-fears-are-vastly-overblown/  That said, it's not likely something the average user needs to spend much time worrying about."
tech,34bmd6,404redditornotfound,2,Thu Apr 30 10:23:22 2015 UTC,"128gb sd cards are affordable, there are even some ultrabooks starting out at 128gb, so for people content with that little storage there would be no problem."
tech,34bmd6,CrateDane,4,Thu Apr 30 11:49:40 2015 UTC,"256GB SSDs are affordable, and 512GB SSDs are getting there. It would not be a big leap for smartphone internal storage and SD cards to get to those levels soon. And half a terabyte is really going to be plenty for most people for the foreseeable future."

tech,34bmd6,thatmorrowguy,1 point,Thu Apr 30 09:47:29 2015 UTC,"Other than Apple, almost all of the flagship phones are shipping with 32 GB minimum this generation, and we'll probably see that going up to 64 GB as a pretty standard minimum next generation.  What Microsoft is also pushing is to have you move mass storage to their OneDrive cloud storage.  With LTE, uploads and downloads are fast enough that most people don't notice/care - they just get to pay the highway robbery to their carriers each month ..."

tech,34bmd6,Jabronez,73,Thu Apr 30 05:59:34 2015 UTC,At least they're moving in the right direction... finally.
tech,34bmd6,Jabronez,32,Thu Apr 30 12:52:13 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's definitely not the same.  I've used the screen sharing feature on Android and it's nothing like what MS showed off at build today."
tech,34bmd6,URAPEACEOFSHEET,15,Thu Apr 30 01:43:44 2015 UTC,The closest thing is ubuntu for phone.
tech,34bmd6,satanlicker,3,Thu Apr 30 02:18:00 2015 UTC,Is Ubuntu on phone actually any good? I've heard pretty mixed things
tech,34bmd6,ctesibius,3,Thu Apr 30 02:22:12 2015 UTC,"Currently the only Ubuntu phone model you can buy does not do desktop. I couldn't get it to install on one of their dev platforms, so I can't be sure whether it works on any platform yet, but it shouldn't be difficult for them to get it up and running as the desktop applications already exist. As a phone, it's pretty alpha-ish at the moment. You could use it as a single device, but it would be pretty restrictive."
tech,34bmd6,satanlicker,2,Thu Apr 30 02:23:41 2015 UTC,"Ah OK, thats interesting, cheers for the write up!"
tech,34bmd6,BonzaiThePenguin,6,Thu Apr 30 04:20:11 2015 UTC,"How is that an opinion? Either Android already does it or it doesn't, reality doesn't care about one's opinion on it."

That's just plain fanboy fallacy talk there.   EDIT: downvoted for opinion, r/tech at best...   No, downvoted because your comment is shit."

tech,34bmd6,mywan,8,Thu Apr 30 08:42:56 2015 UTC,Done right this could put Microsoft on top again. Now start adding telephoto and microscope lense and other accessories for the phone to dock with.

This could do to tablets what tablets did to netbooks, however, depending how well it's implemented. Not an entirely accurate analogy seeing how netbooks were also hamstrung by Microsoft out of the gate, whereas Microsoft actually gave tablets a real chance (Surface Pro)."

That makes the whole ARM thing a complete non-issue. Linux's inherent portability was taking care of it all.  Microsoft isn't delivering anything of the sort. Their whole ecosystem is going to be changed to the WP10 app market with this, which means that this whole Continuum idea is condemned to live or die based on whether app developers bother to make their applications scalable to a desktop environment.

tech,349two,FloorBufferOverflow,18,Wed Apr 29 17:45:21 2015 UTC,"It's not that trivial. With qbits, the likelyhood of data corruption is significantly higher than classical bits, and the parity bits themselves are subject to the same corruption. So they arranged the parity bits in a grid-like array to distribute the range each bit covers, so not only can they detect the error, but they can use surrounding parity bits to find which qbit caused the error and extrapolate a correction (to a certain degree). This is necessary because an errored bit will propagate through the rest of the simulation, and rerunning the entire computation is a significant loss. The downside is the amount of parity bits they need to use, the ratio approaches 1:1 qbit:parity as you increase the number of qbits in the system.  Full paper: http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.7403"
tech,349two,a5e4ja5e4j5ae4,-3,Wed Apr 29 23:07:37 2015 UTC,"Still sounds pretty trivial.

tech,34e879,salec65,1 point,Thu Apr 30 14:42:02 2015 UTC,"I've struggled in working that out but I think I finally get it after seeing some talks from BUILD.   Azure is their money maker.  They want all the devs writing apps that run on anything. Look at the talks and notice all the things they're focusing on and offering. Azure now supports a ridiculous variety of uses with logic apps for instance being IFTTT on steroids. They want you to integrate Azure with your enterprise and anyone bringing their personal Windows hardware. They want you to run everything from your entire infrastructure or collections of APIs on Azure. They offer simple services for image analysis,  social logins and notifications on Azure.  Got a complex analysis task? Azure machine learning will be great.  Yes you can run it on anything you want with .NET core but they are trying to make Azure so useful that you want to use it to back your services.  If you're a dev who doesn't touch their services it's fine. You're still putting things in the ecosystem that can run on Azure by someone else. You're increasing the base of devs who might in the future look to Azure.  MS is going all in on the cloud being the future and they want to convince devs that they have the best cloud infrastructure.  Give away what you need to get the devs and provide a solution that they will want."

I personally prefer OpenStack, even though it's still relatively new and doesn't offer all of the services you can get via the other bigger players.  I prefer it mostly because OpenStack gives me the freedom to pick between different providers as well as host on my own hardware.   Regardless, I am excited for all these changes MS is doing how much they are embracing opensource and cross platform development."

It's as if in the past couple of years they've taken the infamous Bezos memo to heart.  For example they announced a service where you can upload an image and request resized versions (cropped by detecting the areas of interest), get image analysis (where are the faces, what is the gender/age of these faces, is the image safe/racey/adult, good contrast and context colours to use against it.  I dunno what the pricing is but I suspect it'll be ridiculously cheap and possibly with a number of free uses so you only have to worry once you start scaling. But it means you can in a minute hook all this in to your app even if you use none of the rest of their services and they'll be happy if that's all you want and you host the rest elsewhere.  But think about what a service like this needs to run. Then note that they've recently announce their Azure machine learning platform. They've got Bing which already needs to work out a fair number of these details and has billions of images with which to train any new properties they may want to add in to this service."

It looks well thought out and like a nice IDE, but it doesn't do anything that doesn't already exist on OS X from what I can see.  On the Linux side, it may make headway, however.  I guess the idea is that if a developer is working on one platform, this gives them the ability to work on the same IDE if they have to shift platforms -- and if the IDE is part of Visual Studio, that means that when they want to do something bigger, they'll have to shift to Windows to get the job done (and be targeting Windows PEs as well, by default)."

tech,34e879,ChaoAreTasty,1 point,Fri May 1 18:33:14 2015 UTC,"IntelliSense is a powerful feature that can significantly increase your productivity because it provides logical code elements that you can select from a drop-down menu when you are coding. It is designed to make the development of your application much easier by helping you automatically generate code in the Code Editor. This process can reduce the time that you spend typing and help you avoid introducing typographical errors in your code.   IntelliSense provides C# auto-completion, auto-code-generation and debug support.  Sublime provides auto-completion, auto-code-generation (you may have to populate this yourself), but only minimal debug support.  But yeah; they're committing to providing the whole enchilada: you get the IDE, the programming language, and everything you need to deploy in C#, no matter which platform you're on.  Of course, this only does web app stuff; if you want to build .Net executables, you're going to have to run Visual Studio on Windows, or cobble something together yourself.  I'm surprised they didn't integrate this more tightly with their new product that deploys Windows 10 source for iOS and Android...."
tech,34e879,Em_Adespoton,1 point,Fri May 1 20:59:05 2015 UTC,Intellisense is a version of autocomplete but better than Sublime can provide for C#. Sublime does an OK job but it's pretty limited in comparison. Intellisense is code aware because it continually compiles in the background. You put a dot after a variable and it knows what type that variable is so it can give you the methods and properties that are legal. Sublime will provide you suggestions based on string comparisons and possible some awareness of the language's syntax.  I love Sublime and VSCode is not going to replace it in a lot of scenarios for me but when it comes to C# there is a world of difference between them.

You don't even clarify what your position is, just that you don't want to contribute.  At least you prompted me to do some reading, this was the most useful quote I could find:   The only form of interactionist dualism that has seemed even remotely tenable in the contemporary picture is one that exploits certain properties of quantum mechanics. There are two ways this might go. First, some [e.g., Eccles 1986] have appealed to the existence of quantum indeterminacy, and have suggested that a nonphysical consciousness might be responsible for filling the resultant causal gaps, determining which values some physical magnitudes might take within an apparently ""probabilistic"" distribution… This is an audacious and interesting suggestion, but it has a number of problems… A second way in which quantum mechanics bears on the issue of causal closure lies with the fact that in some interpretations of the quantum formalism, consciousness itself plays a vital causal role, being required to bring about the so-called ""collapse of the wave-function."" This collapse is supposed to occur upon any act of measurement; and in one interpretation, the only way to distinguish a measurement from a nonmeasurement is via the presence of consciousness. This theory is certainly not universally accepted (for a start, it presupposes that consciousness is not itself physical, surely contrary to the views of most physicists), and I do not accept it myself, but in any case it seems that the kind of causal work consciousness performs here is quite different from the kind required for consciousness to play a role in directing behavior… In any case, all versions of interactionist dualism have a conceptual problem that suggests that they are less successful in avoiding epiphenomenalism than they might seem; or at least they are no better off than [naturalistic dualism]. Even on these views, there is a sense in which the phenomenal is irrelevant. We can always subtract the phenomenal component from any explanatory account, yielding a purely causal component.[7]     —David Chalmers, ""The Irreducibility of Consciousness"" in The Conscious Mind: In Search of a Fundamental Theory   The part I bolded presupposes free will; which I thought was not allowed by pure realists/materialists?"
tech,344wv5,edzillion,6,Tue Apr 28 21:41:35 2015 UTC,"What in your explanation refutes the humans-as-cosmic-recording-devices theory?    Because you get the same effect if non-conscious mechanisms are used to perform the observation.  In the double-slit experiment, for example, you shine light through the two slits and you get an interference pattern on the projection screen as the waves of light passing through both slits interfere with each other. Then you fire photons one at a time and you still get the interference pattern because the photon is passing simultaneously through both slits and interfering with itself.  Now you set up a device which will detect which hole the photon is going through. However, this act of observation/interacton causes the probability wave to collapse: Each photon now only goes through one slit or the other (not both simultaneously) and the wave pattern disappears.  The key factor here is that the collapse of the probability wave happens regardless of whether or not anyone looks at the results from the photon detector. In fact, a photon detector can be used in which the results are never recorded at all: The probability wave collapses not because of ""observation"" in some metaphysical sense, but because the ""observation"" requires a specific physical interaction. And it's the physical interaction which causes the collapse."

(In aggregate)"
tech,344wv5,davidgro,1 point,Tue Apr 28 19:44:53 2015 UTC,"No that is not really the gist.  Relax, take a deep breath.  Do not reject this out of hat.  Do more research if you need.  The experiment is set up so a wave could travel through both slits.  If it does you get an interference pattern on a sensor.  You can see this pattern after the passing through the slits so it gets ""observed"" after the experiment has taken place and light has done its thing.  Like watching a movie in the theater.  In this analogy the projecter at the back is our slits and the screen at the front is our wave pattern sensor.  A particle though will have to choose which path so you will get it through one slot or the other.  There is a device set up at each slit to record a particle passing through without interfering with it.  So if it is a particle you just get a ping at the sensor at one slit.  And nothing of note on the screen in our theater.  So the trillion dollar question is:  Which form will light take?  If you ""observe"" at the slits with the sensors you get particles choosing one path or the other.  If you ""observe"" at the screen in our theater you get an interference pattern because light is behaving like a wave and going through both slits.  They set up a device that records if the sensors see a particle.  The sensors see a particle when it is setup this way.  They add another device to this contraption which simply destroys the data on the device after it is recorded and you get an interference patern at our screen as the light acts like a wave.  So, if you record the data on where the particle is going for someone to read later you get a particle.  If you destroy this data after the experiment has run but before anyone sees the data the screen will have had shown a wave.  So, nothing is changing on how the particle is being monitored.  The only thing that changes is whether or not a consciousness will ever need to have knowledge of the particle's position.  If a conscious will never need to know the position of the particle of light the universe keeps the data ""fuzzy"" as an uncolapsed waveform.  If a consciousness will need to have knowledge of the position of the particle the universe calculates it into a higher resolution I.E. a finite quanta of energy in a finite location and time.  This result is achieved regardless of the time an observer will need to know the position of this particle and completely violates causality.  This is not fringe.  We just still don't know wtf to do with this information.

tech,345b1v,chubbysumo,6,Tue Apr 28 14:01:04 2015 UTC,"For grid balancing purposes, it is relatively expensive to store electricity in batteries, compared to utilizing existing gas pipelines as storage.   For mobile applications, batteries are heavy relative to the energy stored. It is faster to refuel a tank than to recharge a battery.   On smaller scales, there are industrial applications where electrolysis hydrogen is desirable, namely because it is very easy to purify (only oxygen and water needs to be removed)  Of cause batteries also has its advantages, but you asked why hydrogen is interesting. No matter how you spin it, there is always a market for electrolysis hydrogen, even though it might be a niche."

tech,348ad2,Mr_You,1 point,Wed Apr 29 02:50:21 2015 UTC,So 25-30 years with care and thoughtful design seems reasonable?  Does power to performance deteriorate or is new stuff just better?
tech,348ad2,Em_Adespoton,1 point,Wed Apr 29 03:24:51 2015 UTC,"It really depends.  Older storage media was not manufactured to the same tolerances, so it can be expected to fail.  That said, I still have some functional 20MB SCSI HDDs that haven't succumbed to stiction.  But I've also got a drawer full of disposable 8GB thumb drives -- just think of how many backups of that 20MB HDD I could store on one of those.  Also remember that older hardware generally isn't hot-swappable: you need to turn off all power sources prior to pulling cables.  There are a few old SCSI caddies that were hot swappable, and they usually included hardware RAID as well.  This would allow things to last somewhat longer.  And to keep using old HDDs, you need to spin them up regularly, and should overwrite the contents every few years to prevent bit rot.  Old SCSI drives will generally fare better than old IDE/ATAPI drives, which fared pretty abysmally (~2-3 year life) until around 15 years ago.  Old CRTs tend to last pretty well too, although I've had to re-solder the anode connectors on a few.  All the solid state parts should last for 30 years no problem.  The one other thing you may want to consider replacing is the capacitors on older hardware -- eventually the wet ones dry out; thankfully, there are 1:1 replacements these days that are much better built.  You will also need to replace the clock battery from time to time, as they only tend to last ~ 10-15 years.  If you never reboot, this isn't a problem, however.  So that answers one half of your question.  The other side is: Moore's Law.  ""Moore's law"" is the observation that, over the history of computing hardware, the number of transistors in a dense integrated circuit has doubled approximately every two years.  You can also roughly look at this as: ""energy consumption in a dense integrated circuit has halved approximately every two years"" or ""performance in a dense integrated circuit has doubled approximately every two years.""  Since these solid state parts don't deteriorate very quickly, you end up with a 25-year-old 4MHz processor consuming massively more energy than a modern 4GHz processor.  Over the years, what I've ended up doing is repurposing hardware.  A server designed to be a web server in 1995 is pretty much useless at that task today, but can still be used with an old copy of OpenBSD as a stackless network monitor (if you don't mind the power consumption costs).  A system designed to be a file server in 2005 will still work great today -- as a wireless file server, or running a lightweight modern firewall.  In all cases, you'll be dealing with a system that is notably slower, bigger, louder, with higher probability of component failure, and mostly, much more expensive to keep turned on.  All these factors will likely be the same if you're comparing today's systems to those in 30 years.  Design your entire solution accordingly."

tech,33ysz1,Too_Much_Prego,2,Sun Apr 26 22:40:37 2015 UTC,Google has several pretty thorough tutorials on the basics of building Android apps and best practices. Their guides are probably the best way to begin learning about the fundamentals of app dev.  https://developer.android.com/training/basics/firstapp/index.html
tech,33ysz1,scott01019,1 point,Mon Apr 27 00:57:47 2015 UTC,"If you can program already, there are some good tutorials and such, but honestly without years of experience, your hope of making a professional app by yourself is pretty slim.  If you don't want to own the programming, but have an idea, I would look at two avenues. 1)  Do a search for 'Mobile development company' and you'll find LOTS of shops that basically do work for hire on app development.  These will vary in price and quality, so do some real shopping.  Also, remember that programmers are professionals who expect decent salaries, so hiring 3-5 of them for a few months is easily going to hit $100,000. 2)  If you live in a big city, look for a start-up incubators, entrepreneurship centers, hacker spaces, maker spaces and watch for hackathons.  You may be able to find people here who are already good programmers, and may be willing to start a company with you based on your idea.  Then you'll have a team that can start doing prototyping and help you raise seed money."
tech,33ysz1,loki1725,0,Mon Apr 27 23:10:42 2015 UTC,"Ideas are pretty worthless.  To make a reliable app you'll need a developer with years of experience and it will take them months to get what you want running.  You'll need web hosting for the online components, if you want a website that has user interaction you'll need another developer to custom build that.  This all costs money, so you'll need to get funding. The only way to get funding is if you have a defensible technological advantage such as a patent or trade secrets. If someone else could take your idea and do it themselves right now, it's not worth anything."
tech,33ysz1,BezierPatch,1 point,Mon Apr 27 00:19:38 2015 UTC,"not sure why this is getting downvoted. Yes it's a bit rude to say your idea is worthless. However there were some very good points, that arguably make up for the rudness.  For starts /u/BezierPatch is correct, an app is very expensive form your perspective. Considering how many apps never actually get downloaded you making a huge gamble. What you need to do is find a friend who is a developer and you both can work on different aspects of the app, split the ownership, and ultimately reduce the costs.   Another good point made is    efensible technological advantage such as a patent or trade secrets   This is very true, just go to the app store and search flashlight, there's a mountain of apps for flashlights. If your idea is just an idea, and there is not technical or key part to it. Well then you're going to have copy cats, and even worse that copy cat may make it big. So now you're running the risk of it not paying off, and even run the risk of a copy cat.  These aren't very good aspects from an investment standpoint, and honestly this sucks that this is the way the system works. Sadly there's not much we can do about that.  My advice though, consider the money you want to invest in this app. Now go find classes for learning how to code and develop apps. You will get a better return on investment from this (statistically speaking).  At any rate the decision is yours, and all the best of luck to you and your idea."
tech,33szme,johnmountain,53,Sat Apr 25 09:15:35 2015 UTC,Got it. So I'll just keep pirating movies when 4k becomes a standard because these movie studios can't figure out a digital marketplace for movies.

tech,33szme,sirgallium,4,Sat Apr 25 20:33:29 2015 UTC,A lot more companies these days are embracing digital sales and distribution   The big movie studios have embraced them too: They've been releasing most stuff digitally since the late 90s. The area where they're dragging their feet is downloads and streaming.
tech,33szme,Flight714,39,Sat Apr 25 22:57:59 2015 UTC,Sounds like a fucking huge waste of silicon on both CPU and GPU for something that can be captured the moment it goes to HDMI.
tech,33szme,SCombinator,21,Sat Apr 25 13:15:51 2015 UTC,HDCP protects the signal on HDMI. And the form of HDCP which is mandated for 4K is not broken yet (only the previous version used for 720p/1080p).  It probably will be broken. But for now it does provide some protection.
tech,33szme,happyscrappy,15,Sat Apr 25 14:44:27 2015 UTC,"HDCP has been partially broken. In that, you can make a perfect copy of the video itself, but you lose enhanced video features (like alternate language settings, closed captions, menus, ect).  Edit: It appears that they're using HDCP v2, which is not backwards compatible with HDCPv1 hardware natively. So good luck buying new hardware for all of this."
tech,33szme,Terkala,17,Sat Apr 25 15:31:12 2015 UTC,"I did actually go through the trouble of mentioning this in my post. Not sure how you missed it.  The HDCP for 1080p is completely broken. The only things it does now is enrich Intel with license fees and provide a legal (DMCA) impediment to making devices that can record HDCP (in that you have to get a license and Intel won't license devices designed to record HDCP content or strip it).  But as I mentioned, the form mandated for 4K is not broken yet.  As to buying new hardware, it's not like if they hadn't changed HDCP your 1080p hardware would have worked with 4K content anyway."
tech,33szme,happyscrappy,-6,Sat Apr 25 15:47:20 2015 UTC,But you can always buy a hcdp 1 converter and rip off of that anyway. So it only protects the 4k quality video. Everyone is free to watch it in 1080p

You can set a silent schedule on it (so its silent from 10pm to 6am every day for instance) and I do that, but I wish it just followed the same schedule I set my phone on. I also wish I had more... direct control over the notifications that forward to the Pebble. I've found a system that works so far at least, just wish I had a 1-click silent mode switch for when I need the watch to just shut the fuck up for a moment"
tech,33rqlp,uprislng,1 point,Sat Apr 25 18:06:57 2015 UTC,"The three points you mention were also things that bothered me. After some digging I settled on a Motorola 360 because it addresses all three things.    The screen can stay on all day (albeit very dimly), it can be silenced and have the screen turned off very easily with a double press of the side button,  and it charges wirelessly. It even functions as a bedside clock while charging.   I was very unsure of the usefulness of a smartwatch before getting this one but I am sold on them now.  There are still a ton of kinks to be ironed out but when they do get it right it will be the smartphone revolution all over again."

The technology is still not mature with any of them. You pay very significant early-adopter penalties.  There's really only one company that's doing this shit right, and that's Pebble. Outrageous battery life, 5ATM waterproof, standardized 22mm straps, large and still-growing developer ecosystem, compatibility with all smartphones, screens that are super legible in direct sunlight, list goes on and on. Pebble understands that you have to make a good watch first before you can make a good smartwatch.

I have one and aside from the novelty of changing the watch face, it's just a giant, ugly black chunk of plastic. The apps it has are universally low quality and the poor quality screen is a pain to look at. I like the idea of the pebble, but the implementation left a lot to desire. At least it's not the huge chunk of useless metal the android wear watches are, but that's not saying much.   Honestly, the only wearable that I have enjoyed fully so far is the up band, which also had a flaw... It broke, and it's replacement broke. Functionally, they are great, but they are not durable. Now if only they told time.   I have an apple watch on order, and I'm hoping I like it. But I don't have my hopes up. I develop iPhone apps, so I'll be forcing myself to use it no matter what,   So far, based on a try on at the Apple Store, the apple watch feels better than android and pebble, build quality certainly... Screen, definitely. Usability - unknown yet. We shall see."
tech,33rqlp,360_face_palm,22,Sat Apr 25 02:50:30 2015 UTC,"You're talking about regular Pebble. And I agree. The first iteration was more watch than smart. But again, that's my point. You have to get the watch part rights first before you do anything else. Which they did. And now they're focusing on the smart part with the new Time and Time Steel. If you haven't looked into that, you really should, because it's getting raving reviews from anyone who uses it in just about every aspect imaginable."
tech,33rqlp,TheDirtyFresh,24,Sat Apr 25 02:56:25 2015 UTC,"For me, the pebble is perfect. It's a timepiece, a step counter, and a quick window into why the heck my phone just made a noise."
tech,33rqlp,foulpudding,14,Sat Apr 25 03:49:30 2015 UTC,"This right here. I got the OG Pebble and it is perfect.  I can see the time without pulling out my phone (which also inevitably leads to checking email/FB/Twitter/etc). I can see who just sent a text (and the content of the text).  And then it logs my steps even if I leave my phone on my desk. It allows me to control music without looking at my phone.  Basically, it is a time piece and a phone remote control. That is all I need out of it. In my use I get 5-6 days out of the battery. I could probably go to 7 if I let it get below 10%.  Yes it could look better. And once the the Pebble Time models hit general availability (and go through a software rev...) I'll pick up one of those."

tech,33rqlp,FineWolf,-1,Sat Apr 25 07:25:36 2015 UTC,"Ha. Almost ;-)  A more accurate comparison there is that while the apple watch feels as high quality as the most well assembled iPhones or better, the Pebble feels more like an old Palm pilot and the android wear feels like some of the old windows CE crap that Samsung used to put out.  Ive only seen the Apple watch for a few minutes, but the fit and finish are gorgeous, even for what's basically a black square."
tech,33rqlp,johnmflores,2,Sat Apr 25 10:05:09 2015 UTC,"The Pebble is also much cheaper than any Apple product. Also, I own a Steel and it is actually very well built. I've bumped it plenty of times and no scratches or anything."
tech,33rqlp,johnmflores,6,Sat Apr 25 12:56:20 2015 UTC,"The Pebble watch always has that geeky feel to it. I liked the plastic look of the original Pebble, and the Time is a really nice upgrade in that matter; it looks a lot more ""normal"" for a smart watch.  The screen is pretty crappy, but that's also kind of the point: you can do lots of cool things that look damn nice with a low density display, like pixel art and such. And the Time's screen brings colour, which means antialiasing and more diversity.  You're right though, most of the apps kinda suck. I hope more devs will join the battle in the future because it's getting really easy to develop for it. Also, the nice thing is you can design your own watchface or app if you don't like what already exists, it's easy using certain apps.  I feel like the Apple Watch's software is a real let down. I was expecting more of them. As /u/berock212 said, I feel like most of the stuff they shoved in there is gimmicky. The interface is hard to use. It's bloated. It's like a miniature iPhone, only uglier. Have you seen those smileys? Oh god, nightmares.  I sound really fanboyish, and people who think so will have probably not read up to here before downvoting, but I do think every smart watch has its place on the market. They all have interesting ideas, and competition is good!  I personally don't really get Apple's approach, though; it almost feels like they just want to do the opposite of what everybody else does, sometimes. I don't think you should be spending minutes playing with your watch everyday. It should be useful, give you what you need when you need it, and provide useful apps if necessary. No more."

tech,33rqlp,admiralteal,19,Sat Apr 25 02:54:33 2015 UTC,"Yeah, not really. Most reviewers note that the battery life estimation is a bit generous, the watch itself is monstrously large, and it's not waterproof at all in the sense you expect from a watch. It's got an IP68 rating with the USB port sealed, which only promises a mere 5 feet of water for 30 minutes.  Compared to other Android Wear devices, it's still fantastic. Compared to what people expect from a watch, it's not fantastic. And that's the main thing here. Everyone's lowering their standards just to be able to talk up their favorite device manufacturer or favorite platform in a very fanboy fashion. In the meantime, Pebble is the only company who is actually targeting what a watch is supposed to be able to do. They didn't get all right with the first version, but Time is a phenomenal leap forward on that front. Better than anything anyone else has done."
tech,33rqlp,foxh8er,8,Sat Apr 25 03:03:16 2015 UTC,"Before getting the Sony, I had a drawer full of watches that I don't wear anymore. I wasn't looking for a watch. I was looking for a fitness tracker with GPS so I didn't have to bring my phone with me on runs. I wanted a device that wouldn't die if I accidentally wore it in the shower. I wanted a device that didn't require me to carry a proprietary charger on motorcycle trips. My first instinct was to check out the Apple Watch. No GPS, no go. Microsoft Band was close but not waterproof. Other Android Wear devices don't have GPS. So the Sony is it.  Is it big? Bigger than my other watches but not huge. About the same size as Pebble. Just fits under the cuff of a dress shirt, but it's tough to pull out and use because the cuff gets in the way of swiping left/right.  And the battery? After a light day of use I go to bed with 49%. I charge it in the morning for 30 minutes while I get ready for my day. After a running day with GPS and BT HRM and headphones I go to bed with 20%. One day I went from 6AM to 12 midnight and had 13% at the end of the day.  And Pebble? I looked at that too. Didn't meet my fitness needs.  Yeah, and take back that fanboy accusation. I'm typing this on my Macbook. If I were on my iPad, I'd be using my Microsoft Bluetooth keyboard."

Syncs with my heart rate monitor from Orange Theory and gives me GPS for when I run (I'm big into OCRs).  Seeing my stats is great  I thought about the Sony, but ultimately went with a ""dumber"" watch for durability, battery life, and the fitness software suite (which admittedly is aimed at running).  I have a couple of minor complaints, but it does fill the role I bought it for.  I don't feel like the Smartwatches are there yet and won't be until a battery breakthrough happens, even when functionality gets there."
tech,33rqlp,WastingMyYouthHere,3,Sat Apr 25 07:12:32 2015 UTC,"Yes, products like the Polar (and Garmin) are really nice too, with the benefits you describe. If I was more serious about fitness or doing OCRs where durability was paramount I'd consider them, but I'm wary of smaller, closed systems. For example, I use Garmin GPS for motorcycle trips and their desktop route planning software is light years behind Google Maps. Smaller dev teams just don't have as much horsepower to apply to a problem."
tech,33rqlp,ClassyJacket,3,Sat Apr 25 12:43:47 2015 UTC,"IP*7 signifies no more than 1 meter for no more than 30 minutes.  IP*8 is anything less than 3 meters indefinitely, when used properly (in this case, with its flaps sealed).  Is the SM3 actually IP*8?  I'd be shocked to hear that.  Every other watch is IP*7."
tech,33rqlp,johnmflores,1 point,Sat Apr 25 03:44:15 2015 UTC,"I'm quoting Engadget on this because I don't know the specifics of the rating designations.

tech,33rqlp,Super_Cyan,8,Sat Apr 25 03:49:20 2015 UTC,"They are 100% wrong, then.  I looked it up and it is indeed IP68 which means it is rated for continuous use up up to 3m of water."
tech,33rqlp,whateversclever13,3,Sat Apr 25 03:53:27 2015 UTC,"That's fair.   But I feel compelled to point out that they're relying on an o-ring sealed port flap for this, and the failure rate on water submersion is inevitably going to be significantly higher than a hermetically sealed wrist-watch (which is what Pebble does to achieve the 5 ATM waterproofing). That said, I would at least trust the SW3 in showers knowing what I know now.  By the way, IP*8 apparently only specifies continuous use beyond 1m. They don't actually enforce 3m, but 3m is a common manufacturer standard. Just a minor detail I looked up."

It's one thing to not last a day, but if anyone complains about it not lasting a week, then I think that's a bit overkill.  Also, I've never had a problem with it and water.

When your 5"" screen is already sitting at 350ppi and the pixels are already smaller than the human eye can biologically distinguish, cranking that up to 400+ provides zero additional fidelity. All it really does is suck up battery life. The smart thing to do would be to chase after useful things like contrast ratios, color improvements and power draw instead of squeezing in more pixels. Nobody's doing that smart thing right now.  The same design philosophy now lives on smartwatches. Almost all manufacturers tacked on completely unnecessarily high quality screens on these things and almost all of them are stuck with 1-day (and often less) battery lives because of it.  Again, one of the many reasons why I think Pebble has the right attitude about this whole thing. Not saying their devices are perfect. But they're a lot closer to perfect than anyone else is, because they're actively chasing after all the right design goals, even if they haven't fully met them yet."
tech,33rqlp,johnmflores,7,Sat Apr 25 03:45:35 2015 UTC,The current smartwatches actually have very low density displays. Have you looked at them? They don't look great.   Also the Pebble isn't E-Ink.
tech,33rqlp,sturmeh,2,Sat Apr 25 05:26:06 2015 UTC,"The Apple Watch is 302 PPI. The Pebble is 182 PPI, the Moto360 is 204 PPI, the Samsung Gear Live is 278 PPI, and the LG Watch is 240 PPI.  I'd say the Apple Watch and the Gear Live have pretty high pixel density. To put this into perspective, a normal 24"" 1080P monitor is ~92 PPI, and the Retina displays on 13"" MacBook Pros have 227 PPI."

tech,33rqlp,Hyperman360,1 point,Sat Apr 25 13:55:59 2015 UTC,The other thing is that companies have a boner for deep colors. Reflective LCDs like the e-paper display on a Pebble does not offer deep colors and you have to restrict yourself to very high contrast colors or the become illegible.  I frankly think this is a good combo for something like a watch. I'm not looking to view my snapshots on it anyway. But the phone industry doesn't seem interested.

Third, it's a little slow. Fourth, battery life is not fantastic."

Also the battery life may be limited, but the device charges from 50-100% in about 30 minutes or less, so it's less of a problem than it seems.   It's just new product teething problems, a month and this will all be fixed. The product still looks and feels spectacular and all 1st party apps are perfect."

That's still pretty annoying to have to charge it daily. I don't know if people handle smart watches differently, but back when I wore a watch I couldn't imagine having to take it off every day to plug it in, even if only for 30 minutes. My watch often would not leave my wrist for months, and atm I find charging my phone an inconvenience and all that requires is slipping it out of my pocket. Are smart watches generally water proof speaking of that? I can't see wearing one ever if not, that's something I hadn't thought of until now."

Seventh, you have to keep your iPhone with it at all times to use many of the features, which negates a lot of the point of having a wearable.  For example it doesn't have GPS, so if you go out running you have to bring your phone to track your run anyway.  (I know GPS would suck up too much battery, but that's entirely besides the point, if the technology wasn't ready then the product wasn't ready to be made.)  Eight, the screen size really is small and it makes doing things on it difficult to do and difficult to see.  Ninth, it has no camera so you can't use it to take quick pics, and you can't do video calls on it.  Tenth, Eleventh, Twelfth, ad infinitum..."
tech,33rqlp,breakneckridge,4,Sat Apr 25 03:00:04 2015 UTC,"Why don't you just get a strap for your phone and wear it on your wrist? Seriously this whole wearables/smartwatch thing is getting out of hand. Why do people need GPS or a camera on a watch?!  For instance you buy a smartphone for £300-£600, you then buy a smartwatch to do the exact same things that your expensive smartphone does, all because it's small and it goes on your wrist and tells the time (don't smartphones do that anyway)?  Don't get me wrong, smartwatches are a neat idea, but slamming more unnecessary tech into them is going to do a few things. One: make it harder to make waterproof, Two: make it more expensive, Three: decrease battery life. All of these things in term make people complain more.  If you ask me, Microsoft got it right first time around with their Band. A few minor tweaks and that'll be the best smartwatch/wearable on the market."

In nearly a year of Steel ownership I've not pulled my phone out of my pocket while driving once, and coupled with ""Hey Siri"" I can do everything I need to while driving. Anything major that requires my full attention and I can pull over. I've also found it invaluable when responding to neighbourhood watch emergencies - I get notifications from our neighbourhood watch app whilst we're checking the surroundings for a criminal, and I can keep my flashlight point forward and I never need to touch my phone to read additional updates.

If this can really overcome some of the performance limitations of the Kinect, there is a market for it.  I work in industrial automation, and we currently have multiple systems that deploy MS Kinects in industrial environments.  We spend millions of dollars on robots and such, and then buy Kinects.  Not because they are cheap, but because there really hasn't been anything on the market that can compete.  There are a few companies now coming out with comparable (and even better) products, and they cost between $5,000 - $15,000.  They are all selling just great, but not to hobbiest/consumers.  If this pans out, I would be first in line for a $5,000 version."

Then again, i have been reading about them since HP first figured out how to fab them in the early 2000s and I happen to work for one of the big electronics manufacturers so I tend to pay attention to it.  Memristors allow a fundemental change in computing because there you can do instructions and memory with the same element, just like how a biological neurons.  Closest thing I can think of is like with FPGAs.  Except instead of having a few thousand nodes to work with, you could have millions on a chip.  And dont think in terms of software, think reprogramable circuitry.   A human brain has 100 billion neurons, so it becomes within range of a 3D processor element one day reaching size parity.

If you're genuinely interested (note, what you quoted is not in and of itself a definition, but referencing people freaking out because Netlifx was slow), then you're referring to the separate issue of Netflix fucking up things called peering arrangements between major internet backbones Like Level3, Cogent, and the like.  Net neutrality is basically a way for content providers (Google, Netlfix, etc) to pay for a disproportionately small amount for the traffic that they send out. Peering arrangements built the internet. In a way, they are the internet. It is mutually beneficial for two providers or backbone companies to peer, because the traffic is generally two way. Netflix breaks the shit out of this. It basically breaks the foundation of the internet. The data flow is anything but equal. You send a little bit of traffic requesting a movie, you get a whole metric shitload back (the movie).  So this fucks up routers around the continent, bogging them down. SO the way around this, is to use Content Delivery Networks, where Netflix places data as close to the end consumer as possible, keeping most lines clear (except the one straight to your house).  Now of course, people get pissed about this. This, somehow, breaks ""the egalitarian spirit of the internet"", or some such bullshit. Nevermind that Netflix never said they were being throttled. They even explicitly denied it. Yet you hear that myth everywhere. It's horseshit. Those slowdowns in SoCal? That's because they were switching over to a CDN.

I guess I shouldn't really have said you're wrong, but it's very misleading. A phone on Verizon that lacks Band 12 will not use the 700 spectrum on T-Mobile.   In America, we have some issues with analog TV still using the a close band which is why 700 isn't deployed everywhere. The interference of the two is causing a delay in T-Mobile's expansion.  Also, the 3G band overlaps but a Verizon phone will not hook up to a T-Mobile network due to CDMA/GSM restrictions. On 4G and LTE, Band 4 overlaps on both networks.   You said you were Canadian, right? They do in fact use the same 700 bands. That's not the same in America. Don't assume just because it's standard in Canada means it's the same in America."

Normal people don't use that much. A normal person's bill is going to go down significantly. And honestly, I don't have a problem with a la carte data. Pay for what you use seems perfectly reasonable.   I also expect the price to come down over time. $5/GB seems perfectly fair, and offloading that onto WiFi as planned would drop the total price even further.  EDIT: I don't live in the US. For about a year and a half, I lived on pay as you go, a la carte. It was awesome. 1.2 GB cost me USD6, and I would often only buy one or two packages of 250 MB for $1.60 each. My total cost for that year and a half was under $100.  The big reason I changed is because I started sharing my connection via Wi-Fi hotspot with twenty teenagers a week (and still only using a few GB a month). So now I'm on unlimited data because I was going over the $20/month unlimited costs me.. But I certainly feel like I wouldn't complain if there were no unlimited option and I had to just pay $6/GB with no other charges.  Again, the price per GB has been dropping since mobile data started. I expect it to stay that way. I bet if every service moved to a utility model like a la carte, total prices for 90% of users would drop immediately, and there would be severe downward price pressure on the market.

Data doesn't cost shit for ISPs. $5 a GB is a HUGE profit margin. I'm not sure anymore who did the research on this, but it was found that we pay at least hundreds of times the actual worth of data for internet, and even tens of thousands for classic texting and voice.   $5 a 10 GB is more like it, and even that is a low number.    Again, the price per GB has been dropping since mobile data started.   Not enough, certainly not in the United Cartels of America.

Also, people will use what they have. My daughter leaves Skype on here phone for like 8 hours a night. She hits her ""high speed"" limit on Virgin in about a week. She spends the rest of the month at 2g speeds.   If everyone was paying $5 for 10GB I doubt the phone companies would have the capacity to handle that. I'm sure the pricing is designed to keep usage to an acceptable level for all customers and still make a profit.  What is going to get rates lower is if people STOP buying subsidized phones and getting contracts. If there was nothing locking you to a provider and they knew you could switch at any time and DID then companies would have to compete on Rates and Service rather than just locking people in with contracts and HUGE ETF.  I'm happy to see that T-Mo is shaking up the industry... their separation of the plan rate and the phone finance fee is a start and has caused AT&T and Verizon to rethink some things.   I actually think Pay-As-You-Go or metered data makes perfect sense for mobile. Currently the low usage users are subsisizing the high usage users.

But lots of people here on reddit are convinced that this is just the beginning, and that Google will spread these services to the whole nation and replace the existing service providers while doing a better, cheaper job of it.  Building out those comprehensive networks is the crazy expensive part, not the part that makes everything cheaper."

Which is a perfectly valid thing to complain about.  But hell, I'm highly disappointed anyway, regardless of the reasons. This is just another ""look at this awesome subscription LOL JOKE ITS EXPENSIVE AS FUCK"" mobile subscription that's only a SLIGHT BIT better than most other mobile carriers offer, but that's all there is to it. And it's restricted to a Google device only.   Honestly, fuck this shit. Google is supposed to disrupt the market, not join the others with the same shit they've been pulling for years. This will not make a difference, as opposed to, say, 10 dollar a 10 gigabyte (a perfectly acceptable MINIMUM with our current level of technology, given that data doesn't actually cost shit)."

tech,33dqyt,Sybles,67,Tue Apr 21 18:22:11 2015 UTC,"There are a few problems with the idea.  First are the proteins, which is the only thing they are trying to duplicate. They say that milk has 11 proteins, and so far they have managed to insert genes for 10 of them into bacteria. But they don't say if the bacteria actually produced those identical milk proteins or not.  This is important because making a protein isn't just about inserting the proper DNA into a bacterium. There's a lot of stuff that happens during protein synthesis after translation, that is, after production of the mRNA template from the DNA. There needs to be the right environment for the protein to fold properly, for the secondary, tertiary and quaternary structures to appear (substructures such as helices or sheets, bonded together with hydrogen bonding or disulfide linkages or whatever). These things are needed for the protein to attain its proper 3D structure. It's not a given that bacteria will make complex mammalian proteins without more tinkering.  Second, proteins are just a part of the stuff contained in milk. There are also milk fats and milk carbohydrates. Fats specially are very important for the final flavor of the milk or cheese. You may have noticed that whole milk and skimmed milk taste quite different. It's because a lot of the substances that contribute flavor are fat-soluble, and are removed in the process of skimming. Milk carbs such as lactose are also essential for flavors.  Then there's the question of cost. Milk is very cheap. How much will synthetic milk cost? While a lot of different things can be created by genetically engineered bacteria, most of them aren't exactly cheap. They compare it to ethanol, but ethanol is just a byproduct of certain bacteria turning food to waste, it's not comparable to the much more difficult and costly task of synthesizing proteins."

It could be, perhaps, in the long run.  The problem though is that right now proteins that are made from engineered micro organisms are very expensive. Human insulin, for example, is a protein made by genetically engineered E. coli. As a matter of fact, it's a much simpler and smaller protein than milk proteins. But it costs thousands of dollars a gallon to produce. Granted, stuff made for medical use is manufactured to much higher standards than a food item, but the point is that it still costs a fortune.  If they can produce milk for a hundred dollars a gallon (which is still much cheaper than anyone can produce proteins through genetically engineered microorganisms so far), will people buy it? Is there a market for vegan cheese that sells for hundreds of dollars a pound?  Yes, there are economies in the long run. Technology just keeps getting better, stuff gets cheaper in time. Maybe some day it will get cheaper than cow milk. But what I was pointing out is that technology doesn't exist yet, it's something in the future. Affordable vegan cheese isn't coming to your supermarket anytime soon. It depends on technologies which have yet to be invented. Whether it's these DIY people who'll invent them, or some government or large commercial lab remains to be seen.  The reason why this is mostly a DIY project is because most researchers think that it's better to focus on high value stuff rather than milk right now, because the cost of manufacture is so high that you should produce something that the current market will bear the prices for. Milk is not that product. It will be someday, but we don't know when because you can't predict the dates of technologies that haven't been invented."
tech,33dqyt,EvanRWT,11,Wed Apr 22 09:35:32 2015 UTC,Cheese tastes drastically different just based on the temperature at which it has been stored.   Ethanol is not normally produced by bacteria in any useable form. It's usually produced by tiny mushrooms(yeast).
tech,33dqyt,cwm44,5,Tue Apr 21 23:21:35 2015 UTC,"Ethanol is not normally produced by bacteria in any useable form. It's usually produced by tiny mushrooms(yeast).   Both bacteria and yeast can produce alcohol. Yeast is used in the beer/wine industry or in baking, but it has a narrow range of chemistry that it can tolerate, and also requires very specific sugars (glucose and fructose) to ferment.  Bacteria can be much more versatile, surviving under a wider range of conditions, and being able to digest many more sugars, including mannose, xylose, galactose and arabinose. These are important if you want to produce ethanol cheaply, because all of them are produced by the hydrolysis of hemicellulose, which means you can feed them pretty much any plant matter.  There are many strains of genetically engineered bacteria that have been developed to produce ethanol, such as the KO11 strain of E. coli.  Regardless, my point was that whether it's yeast or bacteria making the ethanol, the process is that it's the end product of the organism's metabolic cycle. Humans produce carbon dioxide and water as the end product of our metabolic cycle. It's easy to produce lots of CO2 and water, you breathe it out or urinate it out regularly. It's much more difficult and energy intensive to produce an equivalent mass of protein. So their analogy to ethanol doesn't hold."
tech,33dqyt,EvanRWT,1 point,Wed Apr 22 09:16:21 2015 UTC,"Cheese tastes drastically different just based on the temperature at which it has been stored.   Yep, it's a sensitive thing, cheese.  So how much more might it vary when the proteins aren't quite identical. Will it be acceptable as cheese then? That's what I asked.  Denaturing is a funny thing. Two of the same proteins in milk (albumin and globulin) are also present in eggs. But when you denature those proteins (hard boil an egg), you get a very different consistency and texture than when you denature milk for cheese. Will people like cheese that has the texture of boiled eggs? How much will their cheese resemble what the market thinks of as cheese?  Or how about melting? You can melt cheese to use as pizza topping. Boiled eggs don't melt though. Neither does meat. Liver actually hardens when heated. All of these things change texture based on denaturation of proteins, but all do it very differently. So it becomes important that the major proteins they manufacture (casein for the most part) are close enough to the real thing that they actually behave in the way we expect cheese to behave."

tech,33dqyt,protestor,1 point,Wed Apr 22 07:34:40 2015 UTC,Is the folding actually important here? I mean aren't these proteins going to get denatured in your stomach anyway?
tech,33dqyt,Zouden,2,Wed Apr 22 05:04:34 2015 UTC,"They're denatured in cheese making before they reach the stomach, since these people are talking about veggie cheese. But the denaturing is dependent on the original 3D shape. Hard boiled eggs are also denatured protein (in fact, two of the same proteins as milk - albumin and globulin), but they have a very different texture than cheese. Most of the texture of cheese comes from casein, so it will depend on how the bacterially synthesized casein denatures, which is dependent on its 3D structure.  Melting is another property that depends on how the protein denatures. You can't melt boiled eggs, for example, further heating just hardens them. That would not be acceptable as a pizza topping.  So in order to create a product that is a substitute for cheese, they will need to ensure that certain properties of cheese are duplicated, which means that something that's like casein but not quite casein isn't good enough. We'll have to wait and see. So far they haven't demonstrated the production of any protein. They need to produce it first and then test it to see how close it comes."
tech,33dqyt,EvanRWT,1 point,Wed Apr 22 09:01:42 2015 UTC,"Interestingly, according to Wikipedia casein has no disulfide bonds and very little tertiary structure. So maybe bacterial casein would be okay for cheese after all."

tech,33e87b,jazir5,2,Wed Apr 22 02:02:34 2015 UTC,"one of the limiting factors for service is the amount of antennas you can place on the device,   The number of antennas can influence things like whether holding the phone in certain ways causes a reduction in signal strength, however the efficacy of the antenna is primarily driven by physical size, and there is (at least so far) no good substitute.  You can phase multiple small antennas to improve overall performance, but then you end up with weird directional patterns that would not be conducive to the mobile nature of cellphones.  This development won't likely improve the performance of a cellphone sitting on a table, say, but it might improve how often you drop calls in already marginal areas because your body gets in the way.  It will also allow devices that aren't limited by big screens to become smaller."

tech,33e87b,hooligan333,3,Wed Apr 22 04:31:04 2015 UTC,Bluetooth and wifi both work on the same 2.4GHz frequency band so they can use the same size antenna and GPS uses much higher frequencies so their antennas area already tiny.    This new technology would allow you to make the antennas in mobile phones much smaller without loosing efficiency so for applications like smart watches you could reduce the space needed for the antenna and at the same time reduce the power requirements needed to transmit and receive signals which would improve battery life.

tech,33e87b,ChiefThunderSqueak,2,Wed Apr 22 03:45:25 2015 UTC,"The main problem would be interference both with other devices on the board and and external devices. Boards are already designed to minimize they signals that wires give off the to minimize coupling between wires. Also boards have to pass a radiation test and be bellow certain thresholds depending on its planned use (consumer, military, etc.). Lastly what I thought of while writing this is all the extra hardware that would have to be added. Digital signals would all have to go through radio hardware to convert them to be sent wirelessly and be Re translated to digital on the receiving end. Also if many components are using it you'll need protocols for addressing to make sure that the right component gets the message you want. It just doesn't seem practical once you look at everything that has to be taken care of."

I doubt the general public gives a shit about programming libraries, yet they impact and improve their lives via increased programmer productivity and obviously the target (programmers) care.  The general public isn't the target of open data, so there's no reason for them to really care that much about it (not saying that they shouldn't care about it, but it's obviously not that important to them and since they don't use it, we can't expect them to be well educated in the implications)."

It's more comfortable and spacious than a plane, more centrally located in cities, security is much faster, you can bring more luggage, it's cheaper, you have internet the whole way for free, trains are far more frequent and less effected by weather, you can see the scenery while you travel.  It's great!  If Canada and the US weren't owned by specific corporations keeping innovation down then we would have high speed rail lines at least linking certain parts of the nations."
tech,33bbx9,nikatnight,-1,Tue Apr 21 21:53:01 2015 UTC,Have you ever traveled North America? Because you seem very ignorant on how our cities and geography are laid out.  High speed rail has very specific requirements. A big part of that is how the tracks are laid. You're not going to get people to give up their land in cities or rural areas for a train.  Nor would it be cheaper just on the costs related to building them. To build a national high speed rail network in the US would cost over a trillion dollars. Here in the US we don't have price fixes on materials and we do have the cost of union labor and limited works hours in urban settings.  Lastly Air Travel would still be faster and still the only option for remote areas.
tech,33bbx9,Dark_Shroud,4,Tue Apr 21 22:09:41 2015 UTC,"I'm from California and I've traveled extensively in the US, I've only lived in China for 4 years.  I am not ignorant to how the cities are laid out.  We currently have massive rail lines in America that already cut through towns and there are stations in almost every major city.  Building upon the already existing infrastructure is the most cost-effective way to do it.  In China they did this for parts of the rail lines through difficult mountains and other complex territory but in many places they created newer and more efficient routes (this would be difficult in the US).    High speed rail definitely loses appeal when the distance is too great or the population too low and there's never been a good argument for remote areas (in general), so I agree with that.  But we could have smart and efficient routes linking the future CA line with Vegas, Phoenix, Portland, Seattle, Vancouver and other smaller towns along the way.  There could also be a decent line in Texas and some of the south.  Then further development between some midwestern cities and eastern ones.  I'm being purposely vague in the east because population density means there are literally dozens of locations to be included and 100% have existing rail lines.  If we establish HSR then we will potentially reduce automobile traffic and that already costs an obscene amount of money.  Look into your city's infrastructure costs and you'll see tons being poured into the highway system already.  We need to stop looking back at cars for every instance, especially as our population continues to rise in cities.  We instead should focus on community transport and trains are, in many instances, the most efficient."
tech,33bbx9,nikatnight,1 point,Tue Apr 21 22:26:34 2015 UTC,"Most rail lines in the US are privately owned. So no those companies are not going to let you build on top of them.  Second flaw in your little plan is that shipping will still not stop or suddenly be able to jump on the train. So road ways will still need to be maintained.  Lastly people still drive because of the over all convenience and cost savings. Going into a US city takes time and money, then you have to get around in that city. Which is why in spite of trains many of us drive into Chicago when we have multiple places to go."
tech,33bbx9,Dark_Shroud,0,Tue Apr 21 22:35:36 2015 UTC,"imminent domain could apply to those corporations and owners just like it did when they seized the land from others.  Or a cooperation could be worked out since they will be side-by-side.  Not on top. I said to build the lines alongside the existing ones, so shipping is unaffected.  Roadways will definitely need to be maintained but if you take a look at the expenses for the roadways in Japan, Germany, France, and UK you see that since their car traffic is proportionately less than ours they have fewer roads to maintain and the cost is far less.  If we had alternative ways to get around then people would drive less.  That's an obvious one. It is cost effective currently because there are no alternatives for a vast majority of people.  But general when looking at the immediate cost, it is cheaper to drive.   In the US I go from Sacramento to SF and it takes about 2 hours if I'm lucky not to hit traffic... no one ever misses traffic! I have to pay a $5 toll each way and I pay at least $10 for parking plus other expenses such as gas and other fees associated with a car.  In China I go from Shanghai to Suzhou which is a similar distance and it takes 25 minutes and costs $7.  I don't even need to own a car here so there's no insurance, no gas, no maintenance costs.  In China you can travel from Shanghai to Beijing and it takes 12.5 hours to drive the 750 miles.  There are a few tolls along the way, just as there likely would be in America, but let's ignore those.  Gas is $2.60 and a decent car will get 25mpg.  750mi / 25mpg x $2.60 is about $80 in gas alone.  Not to mention wear and tear on the vehicle.  This is definitely cheaper for multiple people but the same cost for one person.  But that 12.5 hours... it takes 5-5.5 hours (there are two routes) on that speed train, plus you can sleep or do work or whatever.  If we introduce HSR and it costs $250 to go from SF to LA then yes we will never see it catch on.  If HSR is instead introduced at a reasonable price of ~$100 then it will blossom.  And we will also see the car industry change as less people will need cars.  I personally used to always have a car in the US.  Sometimes I was lucky enough to drive a motorcycle or bicycle.  If my town had decent rail links for a decent price then I could travel to and from other cities without the need for a car just as I do here in China.  There are definitely issues and concerns that need to be dealt with if we want to complete a bad ass HSR.  Chiefly among them is corporate interests.  They own our political system and stifle anything from online discussion to town hall meetings.  The rest will take consideration but once we have discourse and agreement, we can move forward onto the future instead of being stuck in traffic in our relic cars."
tech,33bbx9,nikatnight,1 point,Tue Apr 21 22:57:49 2015 UTC,"imminent domain could apply to those corporations and owners just like it did when they seized the land from others. Or a cooperation could be worked out since they will be side-by-side. Not on top.   This is not a good solution, since these companies already bought many rail lines from the government.  They won't give them up without a fight.  They also own territories and do not overlap much.   I said to build the lines alongside the existing ones, so shipping is unaffected   This means widening the already wide 40 foot right of way that most single freight rail lines travel on.  This would cut a lot of land down, which makes land owners unhappy.  Not to mention that some areas you cannot have more lines next to eachother due to buildings or environmental obstructions.     It is cost effective currently because there are no alternatives for a vast majority of people. But general when looking at the immediate cost, it is cheaper to drive.   Driving will always be the most cost effective solution for short trips of less than 400 miles round.  More than 400 miles and flying beats trains any day in both time and cost.  The problem with both train and plane is getting around once you get there, and with rental cars going up in price, and public transportation still questionable or iffy outside of city centers, trains will never be a ""thing"" in the USA.  We went through the train phase here, 100 years ago, and its now cheaper and more effiecient to drive or fly.  I can take a passenger rail to Minneapolis from duluth.  It will cost me $45 one way, and then I have to pay to get around.  If I take my car, it costs me $40 round trip, and I can still get around without any other issues or planning.  I don't think trains will ever be a viable transportation method here in the USA anymore(just like busses) because alternatives are cheaper and easier, and take less planning to get around at your destination.     In the US I go from Sacramento to SF and it takes about 2 hours if I'm lucky not to hit traffic... no one ever misses traffic! I have to pay a $5 toll each way and I pay at least $10 for parking plus other expenses such as gas and other fees associated with a car.   You live in California, one of the most obnoxious states to own a car in next to new jersey or new york, you should expect that out of california, but elsewhere in the US, this sillyness does not exist.  Trains work better for some areas, but not every area, and definitely not a majority of the USA.      In China you can travel from Shanghai to Beijing and it takes 12.5 hours to drive the 750 miles.   Its actually about 800 miles, and that gives you an average speed of 66mph, which is actually making really great time.  This is really good for a car, as most cars are going to be their most efficient at 55 to 60mph, and that is about the same distance you would be able to get in most of the USA for that amount of time.    There are a few tolls along the way, just as there likely would be in America, but let's ignore those.   yes, lets ignore those, because there are only 23 states in the USA with toll roads, and quite a few of those ""toll roads"" are actually ""managed lanes"" like HOV and bus lanes that you can buy a pass to drive in during rush hour. IN fact, many states only have 1 or 2 toll roads, compared to california and new jersey.  Toll roads are a non issue because you can completely avoid them with little to no effort in most cases.  Tolls do not cost that much anyways, and are a non issue and should not be counted at all.     Gas is $2.60 and a decent car will get 25mpg.   what era are you living in?  my truck gets 25mpg on the highway, and its from 2002.  My car gets 35 or better on the highway.  A decent car will get you 35 to 40 on the highway, which cuts gas costs quite a bit.  Also, gas prices depend heavily on where you actually are.  Gas here is $2.25 a gallon and falling.  Gas 2 hours south is $2.45 a gallon.     Not to mention wear and tear on the vehicle   standard costs are not counted because you would have to perform them anyways once you hit that mileage regardless of when and how you hit that mileage.  Its a cost of owning a car, as is insurance, and cannot be ""added in"" as a cost of a trip.  Wear and tear on a vehicle is not that bad on highway trips.    it takes 5-5.5 hours (there are two routes) on that speed train, plus you can sleep or do work or whatever.   the problem in the US is that we are mostly flat here(unlike china), and our roads already take a damn near straight shot from place to place.  The only place this does not hold true is the mountains, but even there, the trains have winding paths as well.     If we introduce HSR and it costs $250 to go from SF to LA then yes we will never see it catch on. If HSR is instead introduced at a reasonable price of ~$100 then it will blossom. And we will also see the car industry change as less people will need cars.   The problem with high speed rail in the USA is 3 fold.  First, the FRA has set specific guidelines on tracks and such, and freight rails cannot be used with HSR, at all.  No freight trains can share a rail at any point with a high speed passenger train(does not apply to normal speed passenger trains, which are limited to exactly what the freight trains are on each rail section).  This means that HSR needs new tracks, just for it.  Freight cost cannot subsidize the cost of rail sharing.  This drives final ticket price up.  Second is actual track building.  Trains pretty much take as straight of a shot as they can, as do our roads.  many times, rail and road run right next to eachother to minimize easement sizes and impact to surrounding land.  If you start having to build new, you have to consider the FRA rules for minimum distance between freight and passenger HSR lines, as well as minimum easement sizes, and where to route the new tracks, since the tracks that already exist took up the best paths.  Its a nightmare, on top of having to deal with landowners, people, FRA rules for trespass on HSR lines, ect, ect.  The third issue is an issue with cars.  If you cannot beat the cost of getting there and getting around in a car, no one would ever consider taking a train.     Chiefly among them is corporate interests. They own our political system and stifle anything from online discussion to town hall meetings.   hate to say, this, but this is not really true anymore.  There are several companies trying to promote and get HSR services to many places, and it ends up dying simply because of the huge costs of starting up.  The companies want tax shelters and breaks, and cities are not willing to kick in any of their own money(as in most cases they legally cannot), and then it just runs into a stalemate because the company does not want to eat the huge startup costs, and neither does the cities and towns along the proposed path, and the states are no help because the company would not pay a penny in taxes because of tax shelters ect.  I have been to several town hall meetings about HSR services up here, and there was only 2 reps each from amtrack and CN there.  The rest of the people there were there for information and questions, and did not ""stifle"" anything.  They simply asked questions about the project, its path, compensation for easements and lost land, ect, and did not stifle anything.  The reps answered what they could, and made notes of what they could not effectively answer(and took names to get back to people, which they did when they could get an answer for it).  There was no ""stifling"" or protest signs, or people trying to stop it.  There is simply no innovation on this front in the USA because we are far too spread out for it, on top of an already poor public transportation system in a lot of place, it just makes getting around by train really hard to do here, and very likely to never happen."

We do much better with more dynamic modes of travel such as planes or cars that aren't on rails and can go almost anywhere they choose.   For places much more densely populated such as Europe, Japan, or Eastern China, trains make a lot more sense since most of the population is focused in very large cities/metropolitan areas and those cities are much closer together (though this doesn't matter as much, it's still mostly a density problem).  In due time we will probably see some form of train lines pop up as our cities continue to grow and people migrate in from the small towns.

tech,338upg,chubbysumo,1 point,Tue Apr 21 01:50:31 2015 UTC,"I don't understand this comment. Are you saying:   That this medicine would be too expensive to produce? Why wouldn't it get sold at higher prices? Chemo and most cancer treatments already are pretty expensive. That the side-effects of this medicine will cost the company too much money? Most people understand and if there's reason to sue then maybe the drug should be shelved. It'd have to be impressive since the other option seems to be chemotherapy, whose side effects are, well, brutal. That it'll be shelved because other companies make a lot of money of treating the symptoms? So you are going to say that the companies will not be greedy and avoid releasing this drug to gain a full monopoly over cancer treatment? It's simple: it's better to have a full pie than to have a slice, no matter if the full pie is smaller than the whole pie the slice was taken from."
tech,338upg,lookmeat,1 point,Tue Apr 21 22:14:37 2015 UTC,"I believe he is referring to the idea that effective, cheaper solutions to our current, expensive cancer treatment options would get pressure from the current businesses to prevent it from messing with their business model and be shelved simply to prevent competition. Kinda like taxi businesses trying to stop uber from taking over."
tech,338upg,bios_hazard,1 point,Wed Apr 22 11:27:16 2015 UTC,"Except that it doesn't make sense. If anything we'd see uses of traditional chemotherapy and such shelved prematurely due to pressure from the company that wants to push their solution across all cases of cancer, even when it doesn't make sense. Basically the opposite is more common, but we've yet to see a medicine that was truly way more efficient than the alternatives be shelved.  If your move might enrage the oligarchy and they could work together to take you out of the market, you might not make it. But if it's going to make you a monopoly in a certain area, then there's nothing the other companies can do to screw you over.  This is assuming this is as good as it sounds. We might find later that there are many other side effects (what would happen if a piece of lung dissolves? Of heart? Of brain? Of the colon?) and considerations we are not aware of. Maybe it's not really effective on anything but the most specific cases. It might be a very complicated solution that ends up giving weak results. At this point the company might shelve it, not because the other companies are afraid of it making them loose money, but because the amount of research needed to keep going (assuming a useful solution even exists) might be untenable."
tech,338upg,lookmeat,1 point,Wed Apr 22 15:24:39 2015 UTC,"Drug companies make tons more money when people keep coming back to treat their symptoms.  If they make a cure, there is no sales anymore after that.  A drug company share holder will not allow their short term profits to go away, even at the expense of human life.  Just as an example:  the ""susan G Koman for the cure"" foundation only spent $63 million on research.  that is a mere 15% of its donations.  That was down from 17% in 2010, and in 2012 it went down even further.  Worse yet, only a mere 17% of their total donations for 2011 went to actual detection and treatment.  That means that means that 66% of their donations went to something other than finding a cure.  These ""charities"" make money from your suffering, as do drug companies.  There is exactly Zero incentive for a drug company to actually release a cancer cure, because it makes much of their profits go away."
tech,338upg,chubbysumo,1 point,Wed Apr 22 19:24:08 2015 UTC,"A drug company share holder will not allow their short term profits to go away, even at the expense of human life.   That's my whole point, the greed of these companies is such that they'd do something that could harm them long term. It's rare that it doesn't happen like that.  Lets imagine a ""game"" of sorts:   Every round represents a year, every year you decrease the number of cancer patients by 10% (who die) and then add 100 more. All players have a certain ""cure"" that will works X% of the time. Originally only 10% of the time for all players. Every round a price distribution is calculated, which shows what percentage of patients can pay. Patients are distributed, first they always choose the best cure (highest percent of curing) that they can pay. If two options are the same price they choose the cheapest. If two options have the same cost and quality, then they are distributed evenly. Based on what cure patients got a percentage is cured again. players are paid by multiplying the patients they got by the price they set. Each player wins if they make more money this round than the previous one. The bigger the increase in difference the better.   This doesn't cover all the factors for a company, but it will help explain the way this companies work. At first, all companies having good enough solutions, will want to have the same prices. Even if there are only two players you can always increase your gains one round by lowering your price more than your competition, but not more than half (or 1 - 1/# of players) which would lead to an increase in gains.  Of course this isn't what happens, lets add a couple more rules related to research:   Every turn players draw research cards, which may be duds (no improvement) or alternative cures which may have a higher chance. Players can then sell the cure as well (it gets patients separately). They may also choose to not sell it. Players have a monopoly over a cure for 20 rounds (patent), but after that other players can use it. Even if the cure is never sold the patent will expire.   Say that one player gets a 90% effective cure. This is bad long-term: it reduces the gains everyone gets. But short term it's a gain: all patients that can pay for your cure will. Our game isn't realistic: it doesn't calculate that after a while all your cancer patients may be poor since they can't get cure (everything is redistributed randomly every turn) so making the price really high is a good way to control the increase long term. The problem is that if you make it too high, you won't be able to increase gains too much either.  Players could collude in never using such an effective cure since it would hurt them all in the long run. This is a like game theory's Prisoner's Dilemma: if one player betrays the others s/he will make win the best way possible, moreover the solution that leaves you least exposed to being hurt by others is to instead not participate on the collusion.  Moreover, if you could make it so that other players left the game, you wouldn't have to worry about others screwing you over. First you give the cure away (as charity to help the sick and pay for treatment which would still be expensive), then you jack up the prices once you are the only player left. Then you don't ever have to worry about all the issues of a player betraying you: that's why companies will always seek to be a monopoly.  As an aside, imagining a more realistic distribution of price (one that remembers how much the cured people could have paid) also explains why medicine is priced how it's priced. Initially the prices are extremely high, and only the rich get cured. After the disease becomes rare on the rich, lowering the prices to get the less (but still) rich groups that are not cured yet. You keep this going for as long as possible until the patent expires, which leads to the race to the bottom of the price, 20 years after the release of the cure. Of course at the same time better cures are going through the same process, and 20% is amazing when previously you had 1%, but when a 40% solution exists, it seems almost inhumane to only be able to receive that.  TL;DR:  You say:   . A drug company share holder will not allow their short term profits to go away, even at the expense of human life.   And then argue:   There is exactly Zero incentive for a drug company to actually release a cancer cure, because it makes much of their profits go away.    It makes much of their long term profits go away, but as you said companies will work to increase their short term profits. Even at the expense of human life, even at the expense of the companies life/viability!"

Now there were ofcourse atrocities committed on the othersides as well throughout history, however unlike China and Korea, the Japanese government has never admitted or apologized officially for these actions, and many in the government have frequently made the news for saying the comfort girl crimes were necessary and deserve no apology. Many modern political disputes are linked to this, and frequently cause mass street anti-Japanese protests in Korea and China which both government's tend to let proceed and sometimes help inflame.'"

Copy-paste of the text:   While fashions in high-energy lasers have changed as technology progresses, from gas to diode and now fiber, General Atomics Aeronautical Systems (GA-ASI) has stayed its course over more than a decade and believes its third generation of electric laser weapon is ready for prime time.  The company has responded to an Office of Naval Research (ONR) solicitation for a 150-kw laser weapon suitable for installation on DDG-51-class destroyers to counter unmanned aircraft and small boats using only ship power and cooling.  Under ONR’s Solid-State Laser Technology Maturation program, the weapon is to be demonstrated in 2018 on the USS Paul Foster, a decommissioned Spruance-class destroyer that now serves as the U.S. Navy’s ship-defense test vessel at Port Hueneme in California.  GA-ASI has proposed its Gen 3 High-Energy Laser (HEL) system, which recently completed independent beam-quality and power testing for the U.S. government. The Gen 3 system is the third generation of electrically pumped laser using the architecture developed for Darpa’s Hellads program.  General Atomics’ third-generation tactical laser weapon module is sized to be carried on its Avenger unmanned aircraft. Credit: Graham Warwick/AW&ST  Under development since 2003, the 150-kw Hellads will be tested this summer at White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico. A smaller, lighter and more efficient Gen 2 system was built and tested in 2010-12 for the Pentagon’s HEL Joint Technology Office (JTO), says Jim Davis, director of laser weapons.  Gen 3 has increased electrical-to-optical efficiency, improved beam quality and further reduced size and weight, says GA-ASI. A mockup of the Tactical Laser Weapon Module was displayed for the first time at the Sea-Air-Space show on April 13-15 in Washington.  The module includes high-power-density lithium-ion batteries, liquid cooling for the laser and batteries, one or more laser unit cells and optics to clean up and stabilize the beam before it enters the platform-specific beam-director telescope, says Davis.  The unit cell is a laser oscillator that produces a single 75-kw beam. Modules can be ganged together to produce a 150- or 300-kw beam. There is no beam-combining, Davis says, as there is in systems that use multiple lower-power fiber lasers.  The Pentagon and several other manufacturers have shifted focus to fiber lasers because they are a commercial technology and have higher electrical-to-optical “wallplug” efficiency than diode lasers previously demonstrated at power levels exceeding 100 kw.  Mockup shows one 75-kw laser unit cell (gold), although the tactical module has room for two, for a 150-kw laser weapon. Credit: Graham Warwick/AW&ST  But the Gen 3’s efficiency is at the level of fiber lasers, Davis says, adding that the company has worked for several years to improve beam quality and achieved “excellent quality” in the latest tests. Adaptive optics adjust the beam to compensate for atmospheric distortion.  In the independent unit-cell tests, beam quality was measured over a range of operating power and run time, which is limited only by the “magazine depth” of the battery system. “Beam quality was constant throughout the entire run of greater than 30 sec.,” says GA-ASI.  “Fiber lasers are interesting, but it is a matter of maturity,” says Davis. “We are where fiber may be in five years. We have built several versions of this laser over the last 10 years, and we believe [the Gen 3 system] is affordable as is.”  In addition to the ONR program, GA-ASI is eyeing the U.S. Army’s Boeing High Energy Laser Mobile Demonstrator (HEL MD). Live-fire tests of the HEL MD used a 10-kw industrial fiber laser and the Army intends to upgrade the system to a 60-kw Lockheed Martin fiber laser.  The next step is a 120-kw laser, planned for testing in the early 2020s, and for which GA-ASI plans to propose the Gen 3 system. The Air Force Research Laboratory, meanwhile, is interested in a podded laser weapon, although there is no formal program yet.  Davis says the Gen 3’s size enables an airborne laser module in the 150-kw range to be carried by GA-ASI’s Avenger unmanned aircraft. The UAV has sufficient onboard power to recharge the module’s batteries in flight. “That’s the utility; you don’t need to go back to reload,” Davis says."

tech,337bkk,gravshift,1 point,Mon Apr 20 12:53:02 2015 UTC,"It was never a joke (Lockheed is still keen on doing something like that). As for plasma windows; it'd be interesting to see, but I'm doubtful (just based off intuition) they'd be sufficiently capable of block enough of the heat from several seconds or tens of seconds of laser fire."
tech,337bkk,whateversclever13,1 point,Mon Apr 20 12:55:34 2015 UTC,"I think the whole point of the plasma window was to spread the heat out across a large area and get it lower then the armor's melting point.  We are still in the infancy of shield tech (omg lasers, and shields in real life). I also wonder if the heating of the plasma could refract laser energy as well (freaking deflector shields).  Side effect of a PW is it makes you completely invisible to radar and possibly Lidar."
tech,337bkk,beamdriver,1 point,Mon Apr 20 13:06:13 2015 UTC,"As far as I'm aware, plasma windows operate to absorb EM radiation (whether it be light, radio waves, etc). However, they only absorb certain frequency bands / energy levels. What I'm not sure about is how opaque you could make one without roasting yourself with your own plasma. Even if you could sustain the plasma; if your aircraft / tank skin failed at 4000C and the plasma made it 3500C, the laser wouldn't have to do as much work to cause failure.  Also, I'm not entirely sure what defines a plasma shield / window's absorption properties, so I'm not sure if it's possible to shield against a free-electron laser for example (a laser that can create a laser across a very wide range of frequencies, allowing it to bypass certain materials)."

Whereas so long as your phone has a card you have your cards. All of them; which means you can do online transaction and in store transaction without your physical card.  Just makes it easier to do things if it just requires you using your phone. In which case most people carry their phone around 24/7, so it just makes it easier.  It is similar to the keyring app. It puts all of those things in one place.  Edit: TL;DR: There is no reason to use it instead of. You can use it if you find it more useful. If not then do not bother and keep using your physical.  Also, if I am not mistaken it also allows you to do online banking (ie. transfer money from your checking to savings and vice versa, and send money)."

I can understand them wanting to participate in green energies as they're required by the state, but surely this is just a net loss for them and they wouldn't let it fly.

tech,32wyid,fib16,51,Fri Apr 17 14:24:13 2015 UTC,"Tell me why I want a battery in my home...   It solves essentially the biggest problem with local solar power: the fact that peak energy is only available during non-peak use hours. Most people aren't even at home. They're at work. So you stick a battery in your house. Let solar charge it during the day. Use the accumulated power during standard peak-use hours (evenings!).  There's also the added bonus that you can harvest cheap energy off the grid at night while you sleep -- when grid power is also cheap due to off-peak hours. You can then use that later to supplement your peak-hour use, paying less per kWh than you would have otherwise. (Edit: Practices about off-peak pricing varies greatly from one utility to another, so YMMV.)  To be fair the cost of solar paneling your house and buying one of these batteries is still so significant that you're better off staying on grid power right now. So it's not like we're all gonna switch overnight because of this. But it's important for the technology to be there and mature over time, getting cheaper and cheaper, so that we can move towards this eventuality where the grid is supplemented significantly by at least partially self-sustaining homes."
tech,32wyid,happyscrappy,6,Fri Apr 17 14:37:57 2015 UTC,"Why would I store my unused energy I generate during the day instead of selling it back at peak rates?  I can generate it, sell it for $0.25/kWh, then at night buy back what I need for $0.08/kWh. If I store it instead, I lose $0.17/kWh even at 100% efficiency.  The only reason to store power in the day is if you can't sell it back, which would be if you generate more energy than you use in your true-up period. Or if you want to go off-grid. And honestly, adding this battery pack is not going to be enough to do that for most people. The inverter just can't handle the peak load. And they even put a 10-20kW Tesla charger in the pic, that's the hardest single load in the house to run."

tech,32wyid,AgentMullWork,6,Fri Apr 17 23:52:10 2015 UTC,Well there could be multiple modes. Some people may not want to completely empty their batteries and use it as a backup generator in places with frequent outages for instance.
tech,32wyid,nairebis,0,Sat Apr 18 01:46:05 2015 UTC,"It solves essentially the biggest problem with local solar power   The point of this battery system has nothing to do with solar power. While it could be used with solar panels, in practice you would get almost no benefit since it's rare that people have enough solar panels to cover their entire electric usage, so they're buying from the grid anyway. The usual point of solar panels is to reduce usage to get into the low-tier power costs.  The other thing is that when you're connected to the grid, the grid in-essence acts as a battery if your electric production exceeds your usage because you're pushing the power back into the grid (and your meter runs backwards).   There's also the added bonus that you can harvest cheap energy off the grid at night while you sleep -- when grid power is also cheap due to off-peak hours.   That's not an ""added bonus"", that's the entire point. Buying cheap power and using it during expensive times.  The question is whether that saves enough money to justify the cost of the battery, and while I'm really hoping that's the case (my electric bill here in Southern California is INSANE), I'm not sure how the economics are going to work out. Especially since Solar City (Musk's solar company) is a complete rip-off when it comes to how much they charge for their solar panels and installation.  But I'm hoping."
tech,32wyid,ragamufin,4,Fri Apr 17 17:42:08 2015 UTC,"Its not the entire point.  Many many utilities across the US don't offer electricity rates that fluctuate over the course of the day.  Additionally, many utilities don't allow you to run your meter backwords and push power back into the grid.  Large portions of the grid are not designed for this, particularly outside of urban areas.  Your examination of the use cases for this product is myopic, many of the customers for this system won't have access to either of the grid interaction opportunities you are describing.  Source: I consult for several utilities that offer neither of those services to their customers"
tech,32wyid,nairebis,3,Fri Apr 17 17:58:28 2015 UTC,"This kind of diversity is why I listed basically every use case I can think of. There's no single purpose for a battery like this. It's really meant to enable the proliferation of a wide range of micro-grid energy solutions. Which is nice. I don't the cost is there yet, but technology has to start somewhere and get cheaper. This is that somewhere."
tech,32wyid,ragamufin,2,Fri Apr 17 19:08:26 2015 UTC,"many of the customers for this system won't have access to either of the grid interaction opportunities you are describing.   I'm sure you can find some people as you describe, but are you seriously claiming that the majority of sales for this battery system are going to go to people with solar systems with no reverse meter capability? How does a $10K+ battery system pay for itself under this scenario in any reasonable timeframe?  There's a reason this battery system was apparently tested in California. It's because the primary use case is exactly what I outlined: Very expensive, tiered-pricing power. That's the only way it makes economic sense. If you think otherwise, by all means, post some numbers on how this makes sense in other scenarios, because I'd be interested in seeing it."
tech,32wyid,nairebis,2,Fri Apr 17 19:17:05 2015 UTC,"TL;DR saying that residential energy storage has ""nothing to do with solar power"" (your words) and that resale to grid is ""the entire point"" (your words) is beyond ridiculous.  The regulatory framework doesn't support it, the historical data doesn't support it, and the multi billion dollar energy forecasting industry vehemently disagrees with you.  You said ""The point of this battery system (and by associated distributed residential energy storage systems, because that is all that this is) has nothing to do with solar"".  That's a totally absurd statement given that the overwhelming majority of distributed residential energy storage capacity is sold to owners of solar power systems.  A trend that is unequivocally expected to hold true over the next decade in deregulated power markets (most of them) in the US.  Every single energy subscription forecast service in the market (IHS, Wood Mackenzie, Bloomberg, Resources for the Future, Black & Veatch, Ventyx, SNL, and the major financial institutions with substantial energy market portfolios) predicts substantial expansion of residential energy storage in regions with high penetration of distributed generation technologies.  The two variables have extremely high correlation according to every organization (including my own) whose job it is to forecast the growth and expansion of these technologies.    You can have pet theories about what kind of people might want to buy these batteries, but the fact is that most of the people buying residential storage solutions don't have reverse meter capability, and certainly dont have utilities that adjust their buyback rate for peak/off-peak.  The people that buy them are the people that buy solar panels, and unless you've gone door to door asking people why they bought their $10,000 systems, you have to assume its related to the $20,000 solar installation they just put on their roof."
tech,32wyid,martix_agent,2,Fri Apr 17 20:06:41 2015 UTC,"That's a totally absurd statement given that the overwhelming majority of distributed residential energy storage capacity is sold to owners of solar power systems.   I'm sure that's true... at the moment. And yes, I'm sure the economics worked out somehow that it was a benefit. I suspect it's related to companies, or people with rural power needs, or people who just hate utilities, rather than primarily going to private people right next to the grid. I'm skeptical that a $10K battery pays for itself when you're right next to the grid.  Elon Musk said (and I quote): ""Major new Tesla product line -- not a car -- will be unveiled at our Hawthorne Design Studio on Thurs 8pm, April 30""  So, assuming this is a home battery system, your theory is that his primary intention is to sell these to people with existing solar systems? Or to somehow sweeten the idea of solar systems? And you think it's going to be ""just another battery system"" that already exists in the market?  Eh. Maybe I'm wrong, I suppose we'll find out. The economics just don't seem to add up for me where you would buy solar panels with so much excess capacity that it makes sense to buy an expensive battery on top of it."

That's why I refuse to buy Apple products anymore. Planned obsolescence is a huge part of their business model and I think it's wasteful in every way. What's wrong with creating a product that is made to last?   They also make them ridiculously hard to fix yourself. Their motive from the very beginning during the ipod days was always that if it breaks, we will just give you a new/refurbed one. If you're not on warranty then we're not going to help you.  I had a black 2007 macbook years ago, it lasted maybe 4 years tops. I reached a point where (in 2011ish) it was considered 'vintage' and they wouldn't service it anymore in the Apple Store. They couldn't reinstall the OS because it was too old to handle the latest version and they wouldn't install an older version on it.

Nonsense! I have hundreds of Apple laptops, desktops, and tablets under my care. Many of them are 5+ years old, and they are all used by careless adults and children to drop them on a regular basis. Apple products are very solid in my experience. They are consistently rated the most reliable, and they are often used for longer periods of time than their PC brethren. You're simply talking shit. All the data, the surveys, the usage stats prove it.    Planned obsolescence is a huge part of their business model and I think it's wasteful in every way.   Again, you're talking out of your ass. Show me one bit of proof that Apple uses planned obsolescence in its product design. Perhaps you don't know what planned obsolescence means, or you're referring to Apple's ""obsolete"" product designation. The economics simply don't encourage it (there are plenty of less costly substitutes). What's truly wasteful is maintaining the resources to support products over a certain age. That age differs between products, and it just happens to be a shorter period of time for computers and smartphones.   I had a black 2007 macbook years ago, it lasted maybe 4 years tops. I reached a point where (in 2011ish) it was considered 'vintage' and they wouldn't service it anymore in the Apple Store.   Vintage products are those that have not been manufactured for more than 5 years. I'll give you the benefit of the doubt here, and lets just say you misremembered. Either way, you could have taken it to an independent service provider who could have repaired it.   Eventually I had to stop using it altogether because it force-updated all my programs to the latest versions that only ran on an the latest OS, rendering it completely useless.

These modules are going to be crazy expensive, because manufacturers can't benefit from economies of scale (they'll have to build a wide variety of wonky modules instead of a singular mass-produced good).

It's very much like a tablet in the sense that it has a miniaturised mobo, limited I/O options, very low TDP CPU that's passively cooled and components that are all soldered.  The passively cooled CPU is one of those key things that we typically associate with tablets.

Such a large infrastructure development and alteration is incredibly hard for an organization the size of Disney Parks and frankly I'm surprised they were able to do it with the schedule and budget they did it in.  As the author states, most large corporations get very stuck in a particular paradigm, one that's often hard to break out of.  As your organization gets larger in size, it necessarily gets more risk adverse.  This project represented a substantial risk to Disney, albeit a necessary one.  Parks has been a consistent and substantial revenue source to the company and the risk of reducing that revenue source by negatively altering the guest experience was not insignificant.  Of course, the determination was made that the risk of becoming irrelevant and not connecting with an evolving user/guest base was greater and so the NGE project was green-lit."

The Micky head is used all over the park, which could be confusing as compared to the keyblade. and people who have played kingdom hearts will get the reference.  The problem is that most people haven't played the game, making the symbol useless to them. It's also a shared property with square-enix so there are possible copyright issues.  I do think they should stick with the bands, phones will be more easily damaged if they are kept in an unsecured pocket for faster access and it's more covenant to wave a band that's attached to your arm than your phone. Not to mention the fact that cell phone tech may change in 2-4 years to make all the infrastructure obsolete (whens the last time you have an bi-directional infrared recever? the last one i had was on a nokia brick and the S5's is omnidirectional and not for data transfer.. imagine that with NFC in a few years) With the bands, who cares if it's outdated as long as it works. they can make a plan to upgrade the whole system after a certain interval (10 years?) to keep things relatively up to date.

You can remove (but not really) Chrome (or the old Android Web Browser) but to little effect since embedded web views use them, and for sure you have an app using a web view.   Web view doesn't ""use chrome"" but it uses the same rendering system. The reason why removing one doesn't remove the other is because they are separate apps that happen to share a lot of code. This leads to security concerns, but not to anti-competition laws, since web-view clearly is not competing against Firefox (it's meant to be a tool for an app to use, not for a user).  Ultimately finding Google Play Services and the Play Store as anti-trust is going to open a whole new can of worms. It'd be easier to go after Apple's or Window's store. You can't have an iPhone that doesn't do everything through Apple's store, unlike Android which allows you to make non-google android phones (Amazon Fire, etc.), allow you to change the software on your device, and even allows you to publish and install apps without even using a store at all.  I'm not saying that an argument couldn't be made, but it's hard and too weak. The whole argument of shopping is that when you search for something in Google it gives preference to its shopping results instead of, say, the store that actually sells you the stuff. We could argue back and forth, but this case actually is balancing a little bit towards the anti-monopoly argument. I expect the result being that Google will have to do some minor changes, but nothing too drastic. After all it clearly isn't destroying the competition (I still use amazon over google shopping)."

tech,32oe79,greenshrubbery,1 point,Wed Apr 15 21:13:22 2015 UTC,"Android (in this instance I mean ASOP + Google Play Services) is a more open system than it's competitors like iOS and Windows Phone. But those are not monopolies and if they were, I feel that they would lose an anti-trust trial in a second. Google is straddling a fine line here to maximize their investment in Android and using their monopoly to harm competition. Why should Google Keep be pre-installed when most users would prefer Evernote over it? Why doesn't FastMail get to be the featured email client if they strike a deal with an OEM?"
tech,32oe79,megaman821,2,Wed Apr 15 18:01:00 2015 UTC,"The argument is that an OEM could put Evenote and kick out Google Keep, but doing so they couldn't claim it's a ""Google Android phone"". That is it's a control of trademark, simple as that.  What happened with Microsoft's EU antitrust case was that evidence of bad faith were discovered. Moreover Microsoft could forbid vendors from not being able to sell Microsoft Windows PCs if they sold a computer with Netscape or such. Moreover it was discovered that Microsoft was purposefully obscuring information that was required to do a competing product.  AFAIK many companies sell Android and non-Android phones, and there isn't strong restrictions in what else you sell (only on making a clear distinction between Google Android and non Google Android phones AFAIK). Moreover the fact that Android is open source means that people have full access to any hooks that might be there. As long as Google shows good faith, fixing any controversial issue, and it's never discovered that they purposefully did something to abuse the monopolistic status, then this shouldn't be as problematic.  So issues like Keep are hard to claim as anti-trust. If there were a valid case the manufacturers (who don't like to be trapped in the wiles of Google) would have probably already lobbied for a case against them, or tried. With that said, maybe this is the beginning of that, we'll have to wait and see."

It's not really an OS. It's an inseparable part of the iPhone as a device. Perhaps firmware is the correct description for it. Not sure. Either way Apple has no obligation of competitive fairness towards third-party manufacturers, because have any third-party manufacturers selling their own iOS devices in the first place. Google has that obligation. It needs to be fair towards all third-party manufacturers shipping Android devices. It is not allowed to hurt them using its control over the OS (and I'm not saying they do, just stating legal obligations).  Google's case is really curious, and I see a lot of good points being argued in both directions. It's going to be a difficult decision for the EU courts imo. I'm not sure which is the right one.

Is there something else that I'm missing?"
tech,32oe79,-squishi-,13,Wed Apr 15 16:29:09 2015 UTC,"Lots more than that. There are minimum requirements for devices that ship Android, which include GPS, Wifi, accelerometer and a few other things. However, there are more restrictive requirements too: to be a Android certified manufacturer you need to include Google Play Services (which includes the Play Store) as well as have a selection of Google apps installed by default which are not user removable. You are also prohibited from selling any phone that ships with an Android derivative that doesn't include the core Google services (so an Android manufacturer cannot sell an Android phone as well as a Cyanogen Mod phone, otherwise they could face prosecution and be barred from the Android Handset Alliance). You are also barred from selling Android phones that include an app store other than the Play Store installed by default.   Chinese manufacturers such as Miezu are not part of the Android Handset Alliance as they sell customized versions of Android that do not have Google apps installed by default and do not have the Play Store by default. Amazon is similarly not in the Android Handset Alliance.  However, Android Handset Alliance manufacturers are allowed to sell Android phones that include alternative software in addition to Googles core apps, and they can also sell phones running non-Android OS's like Windows Phone, Firefox OS, Tizen or Ubuntu Phone. They just can't sell Android phones that cut Google out of the equation."

In order to get access to the Google Play store, or use some Android functionality, you need to become part of the alliance, which requires the Google default apps be -- the default apps.  So the OEMs can't just switch, or they lose the entire platform.  Want to use Evernote instead of Google Keep by default?  You can, but it results in your phone no longer being ASOP, which means no access to certification, Google Play, etc.  Want to use Firefox by default?  Same thing.  Google made it so you can re-brand the browser front end, but it's still Chrome underneath if you want to keep your ASOP certification and have access to Google Play.  This is a tricky one, as much of what they're doing is legitimate, and done for security reasons.  But they're not above taking advantage of the platform lockdown to push their own default software where other software would do just as well (and in some cases existed first, and does the job better).

If google used that dominance in terms of shopping to only display items on sale through its marketplace or the marketplace of merchants that paid google for that placement, consumers would be harmed if prices elsewhere were lower but were not shown (and in fact were deliberately suppressed in the results to favor their own content). They'd effectively be harmed by omission of relevant information.  Deliberately suppressed is very important - you can't argue google has to know all prices at all times and always show the best ones. That's practically impossible (although it's partially the point of a search engine).

You can already send drive files as microsoft file attachments. If they just had a special email address or something that would be great.

tech,32tqpp,Giotto,3,Thu Apr 16 22:03:52 2015 UTC,"That article is retarded.  No sane person would save passwords as md5 hashes. Or any unsalted hash. That makes no sense.  They are talking about rainbow tables btw. With a rainbow table of every possible md5 hash, you could crack any list in an extremely short amount of time.  The passwords didn't get cracked because they were easy to ""guess"".  They were cracked, because simply storing md5 hashes has been outdated for 10 years and is not even a tiny bit better than storing the passwords in plaintext!!!  Any program or website or whatever that wants its passwords to stay secure even when stolen, will use a random salt to protect the list.  That means, the programm will generate a ""random"" string that it stores somewhere and then it'll use it's hashing algorythm. (Usually a slow one like sha512 etc.. not md5... md5 is not meant for passwords).  This makes rainbow lists completely useless, since just changing a single letter will give a completely different hash.  So instead of converting momof3lolz to the hash sha512 hash of 6ad9a0b8f6fa0462283f2af5ec322245b73adaaf539d56994d9884663643fe7dfb2d4547bc18c7432a82e1fa444f1608cd63455530f6d839757caa497cb6333d which you can find in any normal password list, you'd add a random string: fapohu34a this gives you: momof3lolz+fapohu34a = 6aa8209eceead8c8484553985103f6ef3fd2f865bcc76fadffa1cb5d309bbcef9e1c276722df6565372c70b91724587b6066315b302f3c8e9e795c2ec5a2eb0d  When you enter the password, (momof3lolz) the program will add ""+fapohu34a"" and then calculate the sha512 hash, and will then compare it to the hash it has stored.  So if someone steals the database of salted sha512 hashes, but doesn't also have the salt that was used, it will be nearly impossible to find the correct password. If he also steals the salt, it will make the part that has to be cracked a little shorter, but the hacker will still have to manually create a full rainbow table for your specific salt.  The next user will have his password hashed with a different salt. So the calculation can't be reused, which means the time required to crack all passwords on the list comes close to infinity!"

tech,32l45v,PostNationalism,27,Tue Apr 14 17:38:25 2015 UTC,"Messina stressed that Docker did not have any immediate financial needs for the funding. Indeed, he told me that the company still hasn’t spent most of its Series B funding yet, but the Docker team decided to capitalize on its current momentum in order to be able to scale up as needed.   This should concern investors"
tech,32l45v,ItsMeCaptainMurphy,19,Tue Apr 14 20:40:58 2015 UTC,Possibly. Docker is the hottest thing to hit the Linux world in a while. It is a wonder that Red Hat has not snapped them up as it is.  Additional capital allows them to out spend competition like Rocket-CoreOS and solidify themselves as the defacto Linux containerization technology.  This tech is shaping the Linux cloud and will make a big impact on the broader cloud computing architecture for the forseeable future.   source: I work for a Red Hat Partner.
tech,32l45v,thugnanimous,5,Tue Apr 14 21:20:22 2015 UTC,"The biggest thing about Docker is it lets developers declare the entire environment their application expects. Historically dev writes stuff, gives it to ops to deploy it. Hopefully there's good documentation and communication about what versions of what apps and packages need to be installed on the server the app is going on, maybe there's chef or puppet or cfengine or something to enforce all of that, but in practice it's often a shitshow of unexpected differences between dev/test and prod or unexpected requirements that break when something is changed later.  Containers let--heck, it practically forces--a dev define the entire system their app runs in. What linux distribution, what updates are installed, what packages are installed, what configuration files are pulled down from where, etc etc. The environment it runs in on their laptop is practically identical to the VM it runs in in staging or the 75 copies of it that are running in AWS."

tech,32l45v,agreenbhm,2,Wed Apr 15 02:53:32 2015 UTC,"I'm not remotely expert in using this stuff for production yet but my understanding is you never deploy anything to a container application. If there are changes you deploy a new version of the container.  There's something of an ongoing debate in the docker community about how religious to be about the concept of ""one service per container"" as well. Officially this sort of micro-container is the official Docker position, each container runs one and only one executable. Others find this to be excessively ideological and makes things more complicated than they are worth needing to create several linked containers when one will do. How the best practices are really going to shake out I don't think we know yet.  I don't think many places are really using Docker in production yet. It's mainly insanely popular with developers at the moment. I expect most Ops organizations to be highly resistant to it at first, because they almost always are. (And often they are right to be, though not always.)"

Also on a larger scale solar could feed batteries to compensate for less sunny days. This would probably be a completely different kind of battery tech though, with far less focus on size and weight.   Electric (subsonic) planes could begin to pop up, drastically reducing noise and air pollution; same with everything currently using a ICE.

tech,32je8e,alexrmay91,14,Tue Apr 14 16:23:29 2015 UTC,Why isn't the computing power of consumer computers measured in the same way as supercomputers are?  In Flops?
tech,32je8e,Pimozv,23,Tue Apr 14 14:36:51 2015 UTC,"Because FLOPS is only one aspect of computing performance. Floating-point operations are used extensively in number crunching, mathematical modeling and games, but aren't used nearly as often outside of heavy mathematical applications. For instance, an i7 4770k can do about 96 GFLOPS, while an Nvidia 980 GTX can do 4612 GFLOPS (or 144 in double precision). But we can't just replace our CPUs with GPUs, because graphics cards are purpose-built floating-point calculating machines, and CPUs have to do lots of other things aside from crunch floating point operations."
tech,32je8e,beard-second,6,Tue Apr 14 16:22:24 2015 UTC,"You've made a very good case for FLOPS to describe graphics cards, at least."
tech,32je8e,cpbills,14,Tue Apr 14 16:38:50 2015 UTC,"FLOPS are frequently used to describe and compare graphics cards, and it's mostly a valid comparison. (It's not a sufficient singular comparison, but it's a valid one.) The reason you don't see it printed on the box is that it's determined through benchmarking, rather than something inherent in the processor like a clock speed, so there would have to be some kind of standard tests that the processors could be run against to provide a standardized result. Even then, the result would vary slightly from trial to trial."
tech,32je8e,beard-second,3,Tue Apr 14 16:51:51 2015 UTC,"I think this really touches on why it's so difficult to gauge cpu speed. FLOPS is an indication, instructions per clock is an indicator, as is clock speed, cores, cache, and architecture.

Processors are incredibly complex and can't just be gauged with one metric unfortunately."

tech,32je8e,TheCodexx,1 point,Thu Apr 16 03:32:02 2015 UTC,"Wouldn't this still be somewhat useful for CPU comparisons?  All you're saying is that comparing the horsepower of a Coupe and a Truck is pointless because there's likely other factors you care about (weight, torque, etc). But if we're comparing two cars of the same class, you can tell a lot by comparing their raw power. Doesn't make one better. You'll still want to know other details before choosing one. In a CPU as well, there are compatibilities to account for, and some processors are just better for certain tasks.  So yeah, it's misleading to compare a CPU and a GPU, but comparing two CPUs or two GPUs in GFlops isn't so bad. It gives you a good sense of how much more you get out of each generation."
tech,32je8e,beard-second,1 point,Wed Apr 15 09:52:30 2015 UTC,"Well, it's still a relatively valid comparison of two CPUs, if you're concerned about that particular ability, but my larger point was that FLOPS isn't really a good metric for measuring the performance of a CPU. A CPU could easily be designed to produce high FLOPS but still not be very ""fast"" in actual use because FLOPS doesn't necessarily correlate to speed in many other areas.  It's not like comparing horsepower between two vehicles, it's more like comparing the number of doors - sure, it's useful, but it doesn't tell you that much unless you're particularly concerned about that aspect."

tech,32je8e,cpbills,6,Tue Apr 14 15:11:13 2015 UTC,"Personally, I prefer instructions per clock cycle   IPC favors RISC; the instructions are simpler, and it takes more instructions to do the same thing with CISC. In other words, if it takes 40 RISC instructions to do 1 CISC instruction and your RISC system has an IPC of 20, that means it takes 2 clock cycles, where a CISC system with an IPC of 5 still only takes 1 cycle."

PC manufacturers have already shown they aren't exactly skittish about cheating the consumer, and can make some very serious mistakes. It seems like we can either have easy-to-find reviews from the OEM, put up alongside screen size and amount of RAM which may be erroneous (intentionally or otherwise), or we can have independent reviews that most consumers will never find.

tech,32je8e,thereddaikon,1 point,Tue Apr 14 11:06:57 2015 UTC,"IPC isn't a good mark of overall performance. First off IPC varies based on what kind of operations the CPU is currently running. Second its merely an indicator like rpm on a tachometer. The function of current IPC and Clock Speed gives us the MIPS or millions of instructions per second. But again thats merely an indication. For similar designs, a RISC processor will have higher MIPS than a CISC processor but my not actually be faster because RISC and CISC handle instructions differently. FLOPS have a similar issue because its still an indication and not a performance measurement but its often used with supercomputers. The best solution are benchmarks that rate the CPUs in different ways. You want to add as many tests as possible to make sure your test doesn't favor a specific type of design unfairly and a lot of work goes into tests like this such as 3Dmark but they tend to be overall tests and not CPU specific."

tech,32je8e,lookmeat,1 point,Tue Apr 14 16:11:52 2015 UTC,"Has there ever been a truly useful specification for processor speed? Even back in the 90s clock speed wasn't a good reference to which CPU you should use, many of the internal tricks it would use mattered a lot. Of course which tricks you would benefit from depended on what you wanted to do.  And that's the problem. CPUs are used for too many things which means that you cannot have a single metric that tells you the whole story. A great example is vehicles: for some vehicles we care about horsepower: how fast the car can get once it's given enough time (great for highways), for other vehicles we care about torque, how quickly it can accelerate (great for drag races). You even want to have compromises, a car that has low torque but high HP will be more fuel efficient than one that has both high torque and high HP. Even then this is using a specific measure of torque, when in reality we might want a different measure (for example for pulling stuff). What about max weight pull? It all depends on what you use the vehicle for. All of these use very similar motors, but the metrics we care about are different.  The reason FLOPS was used in super computing was because super computing used to focus on mathematical operations (which can be easily parallelized), CPU clock speed was useless. Now companies care more about power consumption in datacenters, were what you want to optimize is processing-power/cost (where cost is power+cooling+space). For average CPU use probably bigger caches would make more of a difference (reducing the chance of the dreaded cache-miss).  The big issue is that, since clock speed was such a marketing gain, it now has reached very close to the limits of benefit. This is now the CPU is slowed down by almost everything else except the clock. When running code CPUs spend most of their time idle-waiting for something."

The company is a goddamn revolving door. Most people who get in burn out in a few years and leave, but they have enough of a mystical reputation among unsuspecting undergrad engineers that they also have a steady stream of applicants. They're able to sustain the trend right now, but it's not going to be that way forever. As an engineer, you're invariably better off working for almost anyone else but SpaceX, and that's eventually going to catch up with them hardcore.  That's not to say that the big players in the industry don't resort to shitty politics to keep SpaceX off their turf. They absolutely do. But you shouldn't think that SpaceX is some amazing benevolent flawless company that's doing everything right.

BUT, before SpaceX came along, Lockheed-Martin and Boeing were competing against each other for government launch contracts. Then they decided to merge into one company and stop competing with each other and gain a monopoly on government launches, then sold this to congress and the DOD by saying that if they stopped competing against each other, they could keep costs down, trust us we won't jack the prices up once we have a monopoly. Then in the decade after that, their prices tripled.   So if SpaceX does nothing else, it would break up this United Launch Alliance (Boeing and LM) monopoly which has been gouging the us tax payers while also getting paid on the order of a billion dollars a year just to maintain their infrastructure. If SpaceX treated their employees super well and their costs were 20% higher, they would still be drastically cheaper than the alternative."

You're sorely misinformed. Boeing and Lockheed are two separate companies, and they continue to compete with each other in the defense industry. The most recent example is the JSF project, where Lockheed's X-35 beat out Boeing's X-32.   So if SpaceX does nothing else, it would break up this United Launch Alliance (Boeing and LM) monopoly which has been gouging the us tax payers while also getting paid on the order of a billion dollars a year just to maintain their infrastructure.   Again, sorely misinformed. United Launch Alliance is not a merger. It's a joint venture between the two companies for the purposes of launch services. ULA operates already designed and built Delta and Atlas launches. They don't design space craft. They operate two specific kinds that aren't just used for NASA or DoD launches, but also regularly put commercial satellites in orbit.  Boeing, SpaceX, Lockheed and others continue to compete with each other in R&D. CST-100 capsule is a joint Boeing/Bigelow design. Lockheed has their Orion capsule. SpaceX has the Dragon. They're all bidding and receiving funding for ISS cargo and crew supply, with eventual potential for deeper manned space flight. That's a pretty far cry from a monopoly, with or without SpaceX.  Nobody's saying that these bids aren't often plagued by politics and backdoor bullshit. That's an unfortunate aspect of most government bids. But you're grossly misrepresenting an industry you clearly do not understand. Putting SpaceX on a pedestal they do not deserve to be on, like you are so intent on doing, is exactly why there's a prevalent reputation of awesomeness that drives unsuspecting new graduates to their doors to be abused for 2-3 years before they leave, many of whom burnt out on a career they used to have a passion for.

LM and Boeing are separate companies, and when it came to government launches, they competed against each other until 2005, when they merged their launch services into a single entity, ULA. They stopped competing against each other (for launch services, while yes they are separate in other areas) and instead just gave themselves a monopoly by becoming one company.    They operate two specific kinds that aren't just used for NASA or DoD launches, but also regularly put commercial satellites in orbit.   Except for the fact that they charge so much that, no, they don't put up commercial satellites. Seriously. Their prices are so high that they can't compete on the commercial market. The US government has been price gouged by this monopoly.   Don't believe me? Check out the payloads for the Atlas V and Delta IV:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Atlas_launches_(2010%E2%80%9319)  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delta_IV  USAF, NRO, NASA.  The Delta IV has only launched 1 commercial payload, and that was on its first mission because the DOD doesn't put their hardware on a first flight, too dangerous/expensive. Since the successful first flight, it's been 28 straight payloads for the AF, NRO, or NASA.  The Atlas V has launched only one commercial payload in its last 34 flights.   Just read this: http://spacenews.com/the-competition-that-wasnt-nro-launch-added-to-existing-ula-contract/  ULA doesn't publish their prices, and if you ask them in a hearing what they charge the government for a launch, they will reply that it's proprietary information. But we have budget data and as of 2012, the actual cost per launch they were charging the taxpayers was 420 million dollars. Meanwhile SpaceX launches are somewhere in the 60-100 million dollar range.   Atlas and Delta are the most expensive rockets on the market, and the US government not only decided to buy the most expensive ones, they also chose to commit to buying them for years to come with no competition and as cost-plus contracts where if ULA goes over budget, the government just pays whatever it costs, thus no incentive to keep costs down or even to stay on budget. Why on earth would anyone choose to do that unless they were being ""influenced"" to do that. And meanwhile, when SpaceX tries to get into the competition, they find that the government is fighting them on it, rather than trying to get a better deal. It doesn't take a rocket scientist to see the corruption."

I have a friend who works for SpaceX and he pretty much agrees with your description of the revolving door and burning out that employees go through, but that doesn't mean that it's not a job worth having on your resume."
tech,32g3w8,CypressLB,14,Mon Apr 13 22:31:41 2015 UTC,"I disagree completely. What goes on in SpaceX is not ""day to day work"". It's a place where you get paid for 40 hours a week but expected to put in 80+, where your work consumes your entire life. You spend your years literally just coming home to crash on the bed.  If you're good enough coming out of school to be hired by SpaceX, you're good enough to be hired by any other major player in the industry. In the end, a first job at Boeing, Lockheed or whatever isn't any less valuable on your resume than a job at SpaceX. The difference is that you get to make more money, working normal hours, in a normal job, with normal expectations.  Work is not life. Work is not a hobby. Work is not entertainment. Work is just work. This is something that really young engineers don't really understand. They get caught up in this idea that they really love their jobs and that they could do it 24/7. That it could become their hobby, their entertainment. But when you grow old enough you begin to realize that there's a whole lot of shit in life that's much more important than your career. You learn that enjoying your job has its perks, but it's still a job, and it's not worth sacrificing hours with your kid or your wife or your friends. You learn to leave work at work, not bring it home, maintain a separation between the office and your loved ones.  SpaceX preys on young guys who haven't learned that lesson yet. I'm opposed to that on principle. I admire their innovation. I support and welcome the additional competition in the industry.

My point is to many people the marginal benefits of working 80+ hours a week is worth it to them.  For whatever subjective reason they see it as valuable.  Hell, look at people in the military, they're willing to give up 6 months to 2 years of their life on a ship or in a desert.  Is it really that horrible that you come home to your bed?  Many, many people still go into Wall Street and the normal Analyst is expected to work 90-110 hours on average and if you get somewhere important like Lazarus you can expect 120 hours to become almost a norm.

Some people normally work 12 hour days in rotating shifts, which isn't fun, others work long hours in various salaried businesses.  Many people consider their work arrangements to be fine as they are.  I just don't like a proclamation like, ""Work is work, it's not suppose to be your life or a hobby.""

An implication that an adult isn't responsible for their own actions?  Do they not research into the company they want to join?  Why is it so many other sectors who work their salaried workers 80+ hours are known to the applicants that this is the expected norm.  Analysts are often burnt out in Wall Street after 2 years and transition to the buy side for a, slightly, easier lifestyle.  The fact that so many people want to go to these prestigious and very rigorous companies who are known to average 100+ hours weekly shows that this is a lifestyle many people are ok with.  To say that people are ""kids"" and companies are unjustly poaching them or tricking them is inane.  These are adults who are capable of making their own decisions, they don't need you to hold their hand.  ""The turnover ratio pretty clearly shows which group is in the overwhelming vast majority here.""  I agree that a high turnover rate implies people don't want to perform that work continually, but if they have enough applicants that it doesn't matter this can be a sustainable business model, as it has been in many sectors for many decades.  ""But I suspect they're going to find it a helluva lot harder to do so when they actually have to pay what the engineers are worth, and work them in normal, reasonable hours.""  I can't comment on what the pay is, I'm assuming it's generous enough. http://www.payscale.com/research/US/Employer=Spacex/Salary http://www.indeed.com/cmp/Spacex/reviews The pay and the name on a resume seems to be compensation enough for people and in two years time when they view their human capital as being higher than their pay they quit.  It's misleading to say that they're not paying engineers ""What they're worth"", because in any voluntary transaction both parties gain more than they lose from the trade.  If people view the compensation as just for two years or decide they don't want to continue the work for more than two or three years that's fine.  An interesting statistic for this conversation would be retention rate of workers on Wall Street when you compare Analysts to Associates, the bottom two positions.  Analysts never stay for more than 2 years, which is the norm when you want to leave, 95% of the time, rough guesstimate here and then Associates will try to make it to Managing Director most of the time, assuming they can get promoted past Vice President.  I just find this interesting how people who join out of undergrad compared to those who join after their MBA is vastly different in end game goals.  They're worked in a very similar rate on number of hours worked, usually a 10 hour difference a week, although there is a sharp difference in pay, because an Associated is valued at a rate closer to an Analyst on his third year.  It's just interesting the mindset on what determines a career vice a job or a name on a resume."

Google's normal approach seems to be to try a lot of things, some of which seem far-out, but only dip a toe in first, see if it works, see if there's demand, and then use that to decide later if they want to expand or drop the whole idea."

Kansas city helping you to come deploy is not the same as the unmitigated nightmare of trenching fiber through NYC. The closest major competitor would be Verizon FIOS, and they spent about $20 Billion rolling that out to a deployment that looks like this: http://fiberforall.org/fios-map/ Google Fiber never really intended to ""expand rapidly"".  They said from the beginning this was mostly dipping their toes in the water in order to prod the existing ISPs to compete better, rather than ""defeating"" those ISPs. - In other words this article is exactly what they were hoping for."

Fiber isn't even ""limited"" to 1Gbps, that's just what Google is offering. Most datacenters that I know of run a 10 GbE fiber system, and there are places even testing 100 GbE right now. If anything, everyone will get fiber and speeds will just keep increasing.  Same idea really as DSL. Sure when it was first introduced speeds were pretty slow (probably around the 1-3 Mbps range in the mid-late 90's IIRC), but nowadays (and depending on where you are), DSL is capable of in excess to 500 Mbps.

Soon in the future they're going to move away from that and use USB / CD media.
tech,325w7l,LastnameWurst,8,Sat Apr 11 08:49:09 2015 UTC,"Tape is used for backups. Backups are done to preserve data. This idea also requires offsite storage in the case of a local disaster. The price of drives is not really all that relevant when you scale up and utilize 500-100 tapes for storage. Price per GB of tape is much less than a platter drive and is a LOT faster than a single HD. You can't sling around hard drives offsite because they have a tendency to get damaged. For important data like financial transactions, you need to backup your data every day at least. That's 7 devices a week.. add in rotation/retention time and data spanning across multiple tapes and one raid array could utilize 30-60 tapes a month. Some of our tape machines had 12-24 drives and an internal library of 5000 tapes to pick from.   So tapes win for price, reliability and speed of linear read/write.  -managed a library of hundreds of thousands of tapes."
tech,325w7l,oswaldcopperpot,7,Sat Apr 11 13:53:04 2015 UTC,"You're not looking at the right places if those are the prices you're finding. You're most likely looking at the tape writer that is necessary to write to tapes. But that's a once off purchase, after that you can buy lots of cheap tape cartridges.   A 3TB LTO5 tape can be gotten for about 20$.  Or a 6.25 TB LTO6 tape for 37$.  The cheapest hard drives, for example the Seagate Archive 8TB (280$), cost about 35$ / TB. For this price you can get a 6.25TB cartridge. So for cheap long term archival storage tapes are still a factor 3-6 cheaper than hard drives."
tech,325w7l,sukosevato,4,Sat Apr 11 14:41:35 2015 UTC,"With hard disks then there's a very straight forward relationship between storage capacity and price (for a given performance level). With tape, though, it's different. You've got the high up-front cost of the drive but from then on the tapes themselves are cheap.   For off-line backup storage then, even if your 2TB tape drive costs $1,000, the break-even point between $50 2TB tapes sitting on the shelf rather than $100 2TB hard drives is only 20 units. And when you're taking about 220TB of storage per tape then the cost savings are potentially huge.   It's like the difference between buying alkaline AA batteries or rechargeables. The rechargeable batteries have a higher initial cost but the on-going costs are much lower."

It tells the time and does information searches and fitness tracking. Most of the stuff I do on my phone would be useless on a tiny watch screen (I don't like that I can Google something on my Moto 360; besides information like weather or facts, it's annoying when there's a website and it suggests opening it on my phone).

This is a guy who would spend money on paint for the inside of computer cases. Just to know that every inch of his device looked good. Jobs was a guy who forced engineers to make it work no matter the costs. Jobs would make sure this would have been 10x better. That's just how he was. Beyond a perfectionist. He was a complete douchebag but he had an amazing sense of design, and business and there's just no way he would have let this watch out on the market as is."

Several reviewers even say it's annoying to have to navigate all the menus and generally not suited to casual users, which seems to be the opposite of Apple's philosophy.   I don't think Jobs would have settled for something with such short battery life and feature overload, for example. His Watch would probably be a stripped down version of this one, with a simpler UI, just one  button and maybe no third party apps.  I do feel like Apple jumped the gun, but competition is building and no doubt they'll address most of the issues by version 2."
tech,320nv1,yeartwo,19,Fri Apr 10 11:03:04 2015 UTC,"If the biggest designer at Apple is now Jony Ive, they kind of have a problem."
tech,320nv1,TheMonitor58,7,Thu Apr 9 23:34:03 2015 UTC,Can you elaborate on this point?
tech,320nv1,yeartwo,28,Fri Apr 10 06:49:13 2015 UTC,"Sure.   Steve Jobs was always a guy focused on a certain kind of product and a certain kind of audience. He wanted to deliver only the necessary features in an attractive package functionally accessible to everyone, but with a bit of a price premium. This is true of the earliest Macs, the iPod, to a lesser extent the iPhone, etc. The goal was always to deliver a product that didn't do everything, but did everything it did as well as possible.   This looks, from a distance, like minimalism, but it's not. It's a kind of pinpoint focus—everything has to be exactly right. On the outside, we see Jobs' perfectionism—throwing the iPod prototype in the aquarium and pointing at the bubbles, saying ""Those mean it can be smaller.""   As I see it, Jony Ive's design focus isn't an audience or a product, it's an aesthetic. The visual elements are excellent, fine, and there's a story about them spending months trying to get the notification tap to be exactly right, but that's not the kind of minute focus Jobs had. The kind of product being produced at Apple right now—IMHO—is everyone else's tech with Apple's aesthetic as perfected by Ive.  (Questions I think Jobs would ask: The crown is clever but what would make someone want to use a touch screen that size? Is voice command the best way to send texts from the watch?  What would make someone want to look at photos or video on this?)"
tech,320nv1,TheMonitor58,15,Thu Apr 9 23:12:33 2015 UTC,"Thanks. It's funny you should mention it; this was what was irking me so much about the last keynote: nothing seemed at all like a 'practical change.' The Macbook looks gorgeous and is thin, but it is without a doubt one step forward and two steps back. Losing virtually all ports for half a pound? That's not advancement; it brings up the question: 'what's apple going to do when they've forced the entire tech community to abandon ports?' Or, 'If they've literally forced their audience to buy into lightning cables for the past two years, will this even be connectable in two years itself?'  Here's something else I couldn't fathom Jobs doing: introducing two products at the same time, and making them incompatible. The fact that apple released the watch, which uses a usb to charge, at the same time as the Macbook, which needs an $80 adapter to connect to usb's seems absurd to me. They're basically admitting that they themselves don't even believe in junking the usb.   This seems to be perforating their software design as well: forcing people to install 'tips' and 'watch app.' Apple pre-installed apps tended to be very usable, now they're feeling like total bloatware, and almost insulting. Why on earth would I want an app called 'tips' on my phone that I can't delete? What's the practicality in it?"

tech,320nv1,xoctor,3,Fri Apr 10 03:20:11 2015 UTC,"I think this is quite insightful, although it is selling Jony Ive a little short to imply he only cares about aesthetics. Nevertheless, it is clear that Apple is struggling for direction without Jobs there to provide it.  Trying to harness new technologies to build fantastic and innovative products clearly isn't easy. I think Jony Ive is brilliant at optimising great ideas, but I don't think his strength is coming up with the initial concepts (if the iwatch is any indication).  I guess it was inevitable, but Apple are reverting to the mean without Jobs' vision and drive. You can see that the marketing people are incrementally gaining more influence at the expense of the engineering people. That's why they are releasing new products and buggy OS revisions well before they are ready. That's why they force installing app-vertorials like the Apple store and the iWatch apps.  They are emphasising short term marketing rather than product substance. They have such a strong legacy of delivering on their marketing promises that they are given the benefit of the doubt for a time (as can be seen by the incredible iwatch buzz they've been able to generate).  Apple still has plenty of positive momentum, but I think it's a shame that they are losing sight of what made them so great in the first place. I guess all good things must come to an end."

The reason being that it obviously puts you in a position where anyone can counter and say ""But that competitor has better X than the iVersion"".  At the last 3-4 keynotes it has been all about specs, and how they have better specs, and how the numbers are increasing and the DPIs are getting all Retina, Megahurtz, Jiggawatts and all that.  It's hardly been about game-changers. Apple is definitely back at the mean right now, trying to play catch up in an increasing amount of areas."

The problem, of course, is that Apple can't really say ""The Apple Watch allows you to hide your phone, because they're such an eyesore and distract you from what you want to be doing!  Oh, and buy the iPhone 7 today!""  I sure don't want to pay even the base price for a ""let's make my phone unobtrusive"" device, but I'm sure some will.  However, the more expensive models are silly -- they're pricing them against watches that last 50 years and retain their functionality/value.  How long will an Apple Watch last before it needs to be replaced?  I'm betting on 3 years."

Oh, and buy the iPhone 7 today!""   They can't really say that because the Apple Watch doesn't do that. It's not capable of replacing your phone, in fact, many of its functions rely on having the phone. Far from being a dent in their iPhone sales, it actually sells more iPhones, because if you really want the watch, you better have the phone to use it with. You can't go to a ""pre-phone lifestyle"" if that lifestyle requires having the phone in your pocket.  So I don't think it's a matter of ""hiding"" your phone, it's a matter of convenience, that you don't have to dig the phone out of your pocket, you can do some of that stuff interacting with your watch instead.  That's the problem with all such watches. They don't do away with the necessity of carrying a phone, they're an addition. They offer some added convenience, namely not having to dig the phone out of your pocket. And they come with a downside, that once it's out of your pocket, the phone is actually easier to use with a bigger screen and one handed use, while the watch has a squished down screen, harder to use buttons, and uses both hands  since you're not going to be doing anything with the watch hand either while you're using your other hand to press its buttons. Not to mention the 18 hour battery life.  I think a lot of people have just lost the habit of using watches and see no need to go back. The phone is a good enough replacement unless you really need to check the time every 5 minutes. Some people will buy it as a novelty, some because they love any tech or love Apple, some as jewelry. But functionally, there's nothing must-have about it.  If you want something for your wrist, I think the next big revolution will come when we have bendy paper thin screens, a band that fits on your sleeve as clothing, not as a watch. If you could have a 6"" display mounted on your coat sleeve that feels like cloth and not a hunk of metal, if you could tear it off and put it on your desk when needed and velcro it back to the sleeve otherwise, that would be an improvement. Otherwise it really makes no sense to strap a machine on your wrist. The screen is too small, the size too large, the mass too heavy for what it offers."

The Apple Watch is designed to keep your phone in your pocket/bag/etc, so that your casual interface is on your wrist, not on some large object you have to fish out of your pocket while it sings and dances, only to see that you didn't actually need to pay attention to it.  It's a matter of not making your phone part of your casual interactions --  instead only something you pull out when you actually intend to use it for something.  So you've pointed out the problem in further detail: on the one hand, they have to say that the watch gets your phone out of the way, and on the other hand, they want you to see how tightly the two devices integrate.  Personally, I'm waiting for contact lenses with iris interaction and a HUD.  And I say this as someone who wore a number of waterproof calculator watches in the 80's.

I don't think the MS Band does that :-\  The main focus of the Band is to be a fitness product that you can wear all the time, except when you're in the shower (which is when you would charge it). Roughly 2 day battery life means you can wear it overnight and learn about (and optimise) your sleep cycles; GPS and a whole host of sensors means you can leave your phone at home when you go for a run, or in your locker at the gym; broad compatibility means it works with WP, Android and iOS.  It does have other smartwatch features like access to Cortana (for WP), reminders and weather reports. I particularly like the UV sensor as I'm always cautious about going out in the sun.  To me, it's neat because it doesn't try to look or work like a watch. I really, really want one but apart from not being available in Australia, it feels like MS makes about 1,000 of them at a time and they are constantly sold out.

I see anyone who buys an Apple Watch regretting it in a year as faster, better, cheaper Pebble and Wear devices come out and they learn that new Apple Watch features will require next year's watch. At their price point,  you can practically buy two generations of anything else for the cost of one generation of Apple.   I say all this as a guy who's mostly used two Macbooks over the course of the last 8 years (2007 64-bit and 2012 Retina) and loves them for what they offer at the price I got them. None of Apple's mobile devices have had this appeal for me, but I don't doubt that in that same year it takes first gen owners to regret their decisions, Apple is making a hefty profit on every unit they buy."

Android wear still has a long way to go too but it's clearly trying to be something different than the Apple Watch OS so even if it is less capable I don't think it's worse overall. I think it's pretty handy and useful.   I actually think Android Wear fits more with Apples description of their watch OS with the whole ""you only use it for 10-15 seconds max at a time"" thing."

For instance:   Topolsky says that the Watch too often interrupts him with notifications while he's trying to do other things   If he think it's bugging him too much then he can turn off notifications for some apps that he doesn't feel require quick reaction.

tech,320nv1,_johngalt,2,Thu Apr 9 21:55:57 2015 UTC,"The most obvious solution would be for the watch to become more context-aware based on your location (at home, at work), time of day, people around you, etc., and push notifications based on that. Since the main idea is that you shouldn't have to do work to get a computer to do its job - definitely forgivable for a first-gen entry in a (relatively) new category, but plenty of room for improvement"
tech,320nv1,soxy,4,Fri Apr 10 06:01:41 2015 UTC,"Someone needs to give credit to Samsung with their smart watch evolution... and I'm here to give it to them.   I worn them all from Gear to Gear 2 to Gear S. Didn't bother with the FIT.  The gear and gear 2 were clunky in design, not a fashion statement and they knew that. It meant to be functional and it was. The battery was horrible, lasted barely a day, by the 10th hour I'd hold off using it or resort to turning it off to conserve it when I don't have my phone on my person.   The software started off poor, Gear ran on a modified android then offered a software update which switched it over to Tizen OS where the watch fared better in all areas compared to before. I felt that it was nice gesture considering how much alienation consumers endure from tech companies when it comes to last years product. I already had Gear 2 at the time.  Gear and Gear 2 were very similar in functionality, the camera was actually more useful than I thought it would be. I'm usually carrying a bag and a drink, phone in my back pocket (those notes are huge) so it was easier to quickly take snap a picture with the Gear. A parking ticket/spot, or some classified on the board. It was cool to say ""Capture"" to take photos.   I found the IR blaster useful in the tightest spots, it won't replace my remote and it wasn't meant to be. One day, my lady at the time was asleep and all curled up on me along with her 2 cats on the bed, the TV was bothering me and the remote was no where to be found within my reach. It was pitch black besides the TV, but I managed to remember the TV brand. In less than 30 seconds I was able to code in the right TV model with a Trial and error method the software takes you through and I was able to shut off the TV. I had a little smug on me, felt like James Bond, because of all the pussy around me.  Gear 1 and 2 application market wasn't anything notable, I barely use it and don't remember any of the 3rd party apps that I had, but I remember the Gear 2 started getting slower when I had more installed on it, they weren't useful so I didn't have a problem parting ways.  The most useful thing to me was notifications, my phone is now always on silent and on the table. I picked only my important applications to push notifications to my gear, and that's that, everything else can sit and wait in my phone until I pick it up.  The nice thing is it also mimics the notifications you receive on your phone. For example, my instagram and my group whatsapp messages have no vibration, only a visual cue, therefore, whenever I receive something of the sort, my watch just turns on the screen to show me the notification without a vibration. This was a huge deal with me.  Gear 2 battery did better than a day, it would do over 15 hours without a problem, the next day would require a charge. Gear 2 was actually water proof, I submerged it in water for hours,took it swimming and even froze it inside a bag of water, turned it into a giant ice cube. Thawed it and it came out like a champ. The steel front body was unbreakable. The only issue was the glass, gorilla needs to step it up, I cracked it from a 3 foot drop on brick.  Now onto the Gear S, sleek design, it really complemented my Note Edge. It was a fashion stance as well as a small ""flex"" (Pun intended) of Samsung's capabilities that seem to go unrivaled at the moment.   Application diversity is higher, it made finally people see it might have potential, the neat thing is most applications seem to be backwards compatible with Gear 1 and 2.   Having a mobile network capability on the Gear S is rarely useful. I used it when I go running outside as I left my phone at home, so the Gear S and my phone connect over the mobile networks. It was nice to keep track of my notifications happening on the phone, sadly there wasn't much I can do about them. Aside from calling and regular SMS, my hands were tied. I had a Sony SH-52 headset connected to the Gear S when I ran, the 4gb storage left me repeating tracks after a few days of running.  At some point, I was fed up and I got out of my data plan for the Gear S. They offered a 5$ a month for Unlimited call/text and 500mb of data. I never used the phone or sms, I only cared about the data. I was able to get 200mb of data for free every month month just by buying a sim card from T-mobile and ask them to activate it for that purpose.  The opera browser on the Gear S is capable, the processor is similar to that of a low budget phone so it didn't phase me when it ran so well on Wifi. Funny mention, the Gear S at one point didn't have the dollar sign in the keyboard so I wasn't able to enter my friend's wifi password.  The most useful app on my Gear S is the remote camera. Gear S has no camera, but with this app I can use my phone's cameras through the watch. I see a low quality video stream of what the camera sees and am able to capture stills or video. The neat thing is I can still capture pictures even if my phone's screen is off or being used in another application. I have a wallet case on my Note Edge so whenever I open the case, the back camera gets covered and that was a fairly monumental issue as I was no longer able to capture a picture one handed.   Aside from a little experimentation with other apps, I still remain to use it mostly for notifications and controlling music.   Battery life is not even an issue for the Gear S. It can last 2 days of light use without a question, it can last 3 or even 4 if extra measures were taken, such as applying sleep mode during the night, and applying super saver mode when it isn't necessary (Limited applications, Gray scale Screen, Slow as shit).  Now here's the kicker, the charging cradle for the watch has a battery built in that is the same size as the watch (310mah). What I do if I was in a hurry, is I put the cradle on the watch (it's quite thick), loosen up the straps and wear the watch again, granted it looks ridiculous but charging it on the go is extremely useful to me, allows me to still use it and charge it. Now since it is on while charging, the watch will charge only about 50%. Which gives me a day's worth so I have no problem letting that cradle charge and have another go at it the next day. Therefore, the watch and the charging cradle (costs 25$ if you want spares) can survive easily more than 2 days with full functionality, with little hassle. For a 2 inch smartwatch I am impressed.  My major issue currently is the software, Google Wear kicks ass as it is part of the operating system. I can send out replies through any applications (even whatsapp) through a Google Wear watch. Samsung hasn't been able to come close to this. I'm speculating that future Samsung phones will have integrated software that will allow more functionality for the Gear watches. Time will tell if Samsung would have to bow down to Google and end their Tizen watches and pick up the Wear platform for Gear S2? IIRC Google didn't appreciate all of Samsung's modifications of Android, I'm not sure if this is a similar situation. But the shitty Gear Watch that runs Wear is just an ""are you happy now Google?"" type of product as it brought nothing new to the table. It was only there to exist to satisfy Google.  All in all, just like what The Verge said, it didn't do anything faster than what I would have with my phone or laptop.   These watches should stay a transnational product, that fills a small gap between lack of information, like finding out why your phone vibrated. It gives me a heads up of what the notification is and subconsciously makes me start preparing a reply so as soon as I pick my phone, I know what I'm saying.  Wow this was way longer than I wanted it to be, but I hope it's useful enough without sounding like a troll since this is thread is about the Apple Watch, haha."

tech,31z7aj,quatch,8,Thu Apr 9 16:09:26 2015 UTC,"The article danced around the 'symmetry breaking' basis of this, and I was left not understanding just what symmetry was being broken.  In response to other comments, AFAIK the antennas in smartphones, etc. are not exactly 'on a chip' - they are fractal antennas, which is a cool tech, but they are still macro scale 'wires on a substrate', not micro or nano.  Perhaps someone else knows what this new thing means, not just WRT this one application but in general - do we really know more about how electromagnetic radiation is produced / received here?"
tech,31z7aj,gar37bic,10,Thu Apr 9 14:43:52 2015 UTC,"If you look at it from the quantum theory side, combined with the basics of electromagnetism, it's basically saying that if the state of an electron shell is in flux, this will disturb the EM field.  Think of it like a boat creating a wake by cutting through water.  Traditionally, we've been focused on the motion of the boat as creating the waves, but in reality, it's a combination of this motion with the displacement of the boat in the water at multiple points through time.  Looking at it this way allows you to view it from a quantum construct perspective, which allows you to adjust the speed and displacement variables to create a similar wake (and adjust the direction of deflection) without just adjusting the speed.  So if I understand correctly, instead of adjusting voltage through an antenna (adjusting the speed of the fixed-draft boat), they've realized that they can move this onto a piezoelectric surface and adjust the amperage, thereby adjusting the symmetry of the fields on multiple levels of the piezoelectric surfaces.  In modulating this, they can vary the wavelength on the perpendicular axis, thereby replacing the antenna itself with an EM field of similar size.  That's my understanding anyway.  What I'm still not sure of is how they'd use this technique to capture an EM wave; I presume they'd use the same generated field, and measure how the passing wave interferes with it, and read off the voltage/amperage difference generated between the substrates.  But that seems a bit lossy to me.  Likely I'm just missing something here, because it sounds theoretically doable.  Another interesting aspect of this is that you also end up with the ability to take advantage of EM polarization in a manner not as easily manageable with an antenna array."

In modulating this, they can vary the wavelength on the perpendicular axis, thereby replacing the antenna itself with an EM field of similar size.   So you are saying you would vary the Voltage and the Current? That would greatly increase the complexity of the amplifier system needed.  You would need a voltage amp, a current amp and means to keep power at a constant level.   This also makes me wonder how complicated a pattern the relationship between I and V would have to be. Would this be something that is impossible without some sort of wave pattern processor (i.e. intelligence)?"
tech,31z7aj,mrsisti,2,Fri Apr 10 19:47:40 2015 UTC,"I'm saying that you'd create a voltage/amperage dissonance between the substrate layers, and this would affect the projected EM field, which would be acting in place of a traditional antenna.  An amplifier system would actually be significantly simpler, as you'd just be reading the differential off the substrate directly on the SoC.  Which, of course, would be doing the equivalent of wave pattern processing, except they've skipped the entire need for processing the wave patterns by looking at the disturbance instead of the wave itself.  The wave would then be virtually built by using a known amplitude value and guessed polarity (based on signal cohesiveness) and could be set to whatever voltage level you desire.  The whole genius of this method is that it potentially side-steps depending on the electron acceleration in an antenna, and instead is able to measure the difference in quantum state, so a lot of the traditional massaging of the RF signal can be avoided and replaced with pure data processing (which SoC is really good at).  This is assuming I understand what they're doing from the abstract."

tech,31x15r,MsPenguinette,21,Thu Apr 9 01:08:14 2015 UTC,"They recently made changes to the way monetization is calculated that is now based more on retention and how long people stay on YouTube after watching your video,  instead of how many people watched your video as it was before. As a result a lot of video formats became a lot less profitable, I think original animation was hit pretty hard, this is something new.  This has the possibility to be a bad change. It looks like YouTube is going to be working out how much content a subscriber watches and 55% of their subscription money will be divided between channels watched that month.  Smaller monetized channels used to be able to get a reasonable amount based on how their views. As a simple example, if they were getting 10,000 views on a video - they were getting 10,000 views worth of ad revenue. Now, if a viewer watches 1 of their videos, and 99 videos from other creators then they'll end up getting something like $subscriberfee*0.55*0.01.  This might work out better for some channels, and worse for others. Channels are going to be trying to make sure you watch their channel instead of others. Which is going to be a huge shift.  Right now, if someone watches one of your videos then watches someone elses you're either:  1) Unaffected the same under the old system. They gave you a view. Your ad revenue is not affected.  2) Better off under the new(er) system. They gave you a view, then stayed on YouTube to watch more things. Your ad revenue is increased.  3) Worse off under the newest system if they have a subscription. They watched your video for X minutes. They then saw you linked to another persons video and went there and watched 2 of theirs. Your portion of the ad revenue just got smaller, as you introduced them to a new channel that they stayed on for longer than yours (because they're already caught up on your content).  I think this is going to have a really negative effect on how often people mention other people's channels. It will become very focussed on keeping people on your channel all the time."

Using ad block gives me a better browsing experience. my internet isn't the greatest (woo, NZ! ) if the ad buffers and I have to wait for it to load, I'm pissed because it's taking more time.  ads are awful, half the time they don't apply to me.

tech,31x15r,Sacrix,4,Thu Apr 9 00:17:52 2015 UTC,"Who cares? Me, because 30second of my entire day isn't 30 seconds of my entire day like you try to make out. I put youtube on my phone at work the other day while I've been working on a project over the space of about 10hours. I did this firstly because I didn't have any music on my phone to last that long and 2 I wanted a different range of music while I worked to what I would have had on my phone in most circumstances. Every 3-4 videos there was an advert that all offered the skip as far as I saw around 3-5seconds in, and even over the space of about an hour which would see about 15-20 songs is more than the figure you claim.  I set it up to play some instrumental music in a playlist FWIW. Yes I could skip the ads but then most of the ads didn't get skipped as I was too busy to skip them once it was available and there were a number of adverts that were longer than some of the songs I was playing.   If I wanted to listen to the radio that's fine I expect adverts, however usually they are something relevant to me. The fact that I have little or no use for thrust treatment (My vagina has not yet sprouted between my testicles [has yours?]) among other things that youtube seems to advertise to me, despite over 10 years of data Google has obtained about me they still can't manage to advertise things to me that I would be even vaguely interested in.   Yes Google/youtube et al. Cars, computers, technology, science are all interesting to me. Stuff for my non existent illnesses, dog food for the dog I don't have, hair nit treatments for the kids I wont be having and the latest deal on an iPhone from O2 all will not be on my interests list.   So with that, yes I will continue to block adverts, if you're a content creator that can't hack that some people enjoy an internet without the crap. Then you're in the wrong business. The internet is what you make of it and that is how mine is made.  Once youtube ads become relevant or less obtrusive I'd consider unblocking it like I do for my favourite sites that use adverts to pay for themselves. For now as it stands I'll continue to block it.   Finally, youtube doesn't pay for bandwidth. Google is a major player in the world of the internet and own huge swathes of infrastructure that people use and they are only pushing harder to get more into that game. Google along with a few other major players like Level 3 Communications now own the backbone of the internet as you know it. Last check well over 90% of the functioning of the internet is powered by under 100 companies.   I'll also add that I skin youtube to suit my needs too."

If you took a piece of steel and flattened it out to be one atom thick, it wouldn't be a knife.  So when you say ""a knife with an edge of one atom"", you're talking about a wedge of material which goes from thick and sturdy down to a point the width of an atom, where it cuts.  You are not talking about aluminum foil.  If you think you're talking about aluminum foil, that's fine, but it can't also be a knife."

tech,31sin3,PostNationalism,311,Tue Apr 7 20:44:41 2015 UTC,"This is nothing new.  The real solution isn't to ban all ads, it's to limit ads to things that are reasonable.  No auto-playing ads, no ads that are so large they deform the entire rendering of the page.  Google's AdWords are a perfect example.  A link or two clearly delineated as an Ad.  Perhaps a small ad or two on the side.  If that was as far as ads went, I wouldn't bother using an AdBlocker.  Reddit is another good example.  If all websites used ads like Reddit's I wouldn't bother blocking them.  You want to know what never fails to cause me to install an ad blocker?  ""ANNOUNCING THE NEW NISSAN ULTIMA, NOW WITH 5 STAR CRASH TEST RATINGS AND THE CONSUMER CHOICE RATING OF THE YEAR"" as soon as I open a web page.  I close that tab, go install uBlock, and then go back.  The unfortunate thing is that crappy advertisers who engage in overly obtrusive advertising are ruining it for people who maintained reasonable ads, because all of that is caught in an ad blocker."
tech,31sin3,Shammyhealz,132,Tue Apr 7 21:01:10 2015 UTC,"The ad industry has a horrible track record when it comes to actually limiting to reasonability. Advertisers tend to push it as far as they can - which is pretty damn far - and that's why we have 140 million people using ad blockers.  The publisher / content creator / site owner has been screwed out of their business model. It is partly the publishing industry's fault for not pushing back against intrusive ads, so they aren't without blame here either.  The idea I'm suggesting in the article (I'm the author) is that we try to create ad-free alternatives for the people who are willing to pay for content directly. Clearly, there is demand for less/no advertising, given the meteoric rise of adblock."
tech,31sin3,zacksinclair,54,Tue Apr 7 23:14:54 2015 UTC,"I think that's a great idea, but I'm not certain it's going to work out in practice. Not only does it cost money, but you also have to do more work than just installing uBlock. It's definitely a valiant effort, I'm just not certain how effective it's going to be.   I think what we're really identifying here is that society is adapting to advertising and learning to ignore it so, in part, advertising has become less effective. That means advertisers either pay less per view, or require a more intrusive ad. Let me ask you this, even without uBlock or ADP, when was the last time you actually looked at an ad, or better yet, clicked on one? I've noticed people have started ignoring advertisements more, especially among the young and those who spend a lot of time on the Internet. You start to learn what ads look like, and you tune them out like background noise.   In addition to that, there are some businesses who seem to refuse to admit that their business model is not well suited to being free, or in some cases to the Internet in general. Newspapers are a pretty good example of this. They generate money by views. How many views do you need to get to pay to send someone to the front lines of a war to write an article? An awful lot. Some of them are churning out a lot of crap articles trying to get page views to subsidize the costs of the real news pieces. The other option is to become a pay site, but then some people will just move to another site that's free. Research papers seem to have this happen all the time. Check out the links to stuff behind pay walls on Reddit. There's invariably a comment linking to either the full version hosted on a free site, or to a free site with enough of the content to get the idea. Maybe I'm wrong, maybe they can get enough impressions to stay afloat, but some lines of business seem to have a really hard time staying alive on the net."
tech,31sin3,Shammyhealz,20,Wed Apr 8 00:02:10 2015 UTC,"I think more than people being annoyed by the ads presence it is the fact that the ads track you. That they are increasingly being designed to target you personally and in real time. If we could have ads not designed to subvert your rational mind maybe that would be better.

Dont even get me started on commericals that are constantly repeated, sometimes 5 times during a 30 min time slot. Generation after generation taught to hate ads. It sucks for journalists like you that need ad revenue to help make a living. People are just conditioned to hate ads and I dont see it stopping anytime soon unless theirs a change in the industry.

This is much less viewer-aware, so you can't pull an Amazon and tailor the content to the viewer as easily, but in today's global culture, pretty much anyone in the world can be your customer, especially if the sponsors actually have something to do with the content being sponsored.  A number of YouTube channels have already started to go this direction, where each video actually gets a corporate sponsor, and their logos and products are actually seen/used in the videos being watched -- which is MUCH more compelling advertising than having a picture of a big truck prevent you from seeing an article on the dangers of deforestation."

I'm skeptical that ""good journalism"" will go away without advertising. Right now we get an occasional good story out of NYT or WP, yet even they are filled with clickbait crap and sensationalism because the ad-driven model requires them to get as many clicks from as broad an audience as possible. The best journalism comes from people who care about the issues, social activists, independent researchers, direct from academics or experts. These lines have never seen profit yet the continue to exist because of the dedication of motivated individuals. While they might not be as curated or details as a NYT piece, they largely get the job done and could do a better job without the interference of large companies with an ad-driven agenda.  Pay-wall models might help large companies kick the ad-model, but only if they transition 100% and don't stay in a half-state still dependent on advertising like the current pay-wall companies are doing."

tech,31sin3,MINIMAN10000,14,Wed Apr 8 16:13:47 2015 UTC,"Clearly, there is demand for less/no advertising, given the meteoric rise of adblock.   This is at least in part because people have come to expect free content online due to that historically being the case (though at that time the net was more user-driven). Any ad that moves, blinks, is animated, flashes, or reacts to a mouseover (I'm looking at you, bastard little ads embdded in text that pop shit up when I hover on it), is completely unacceptable. Ads should be like billboards on a long stretch of highway: I can divert my attention to it for a moment and see it if I want, but if I go about my business it's like it isn't even there. Anything that interrupts of distracts me from what I'm doing, I will block. The 30 second youtube ad for a 12 second video? BALEETED. Advertisers will never win this fight, but if they take their lumps and accept that maybe what they do isn't worth what they think it is, or find a way to make it more worthwhile without making people wish for the opportunity to drop an angry shark on them, a compromise might be possible. Until then, ads can S my D. Also, if paying a monthly fee for content was viable in this day and age, subscription based print media wouldn't be in the pickle it's in.  And while we're on the subject, if they want us to look at ads, then by god they can pay our ISP's not to charge us for that bandwidth when people are on limited data allotments.  Edit: I also do a lot of different things on the internet, and I don't necessarily want to associate those things together, even if they are innocuous. Consequently, ads that attempt to track my behavior to ""better serve my interests"" are also non-negotiable in terms of BALEETED status."

I install Adblockers on every one of my customers machines to help prevent Malware/Adware/Viruses from infecting them.  For those people it has little to nothing to do with ads being annoying and everything to do with safety while online.  Not to mention that websites look absolutely terrible with ads, especially news sites, and when they see those sites without ads it blows their minds.  The vast majority of crap gets installed because of Ads in my experience.  Maybe if advertisers didn't actively push ads that were laden with software that does absolutely nothing but slow down your machine and try to con you out of your credit card information, we'd be better off.  There's approximately a 0% chance anyone is ever going to pay a blogger directly, it's also unlikely that people are even going to actively start paying for news sites unless you manage to have them ALL change at the same time to a pay wall model, which is only going to drive people to different sources.  I already have to save my customers from malware laden ads regularly.  And the blame for that is squarely on the advertising companies not properly vetting ads.  Google AdWords is a step in the right direction, text only ads.  They still need to make 100% sure that the site it's advertising for doesn't push malware/adware/viruses though."

tech,31sin3,Znuff,17,Wed Apr 8 05:28:21 2015 UTC,"It's a fundamental issue in all advertising. People who have media (like a web site) have a resource to sell. Do you know what that resource is? A lot of people make the mistake of assuming media outlets are selling ""space,"" like banner space on a website, airtime on radio, commercial slots on television, etc. As if advertising is a type of real estate.   Wrong.    The resource media outlets are selling is your attention. And your attention evolves over time. You learn to ignore ads, to skip commercials. You train your eye not to look at banner ads, Google AdWords, etc. Advertisers know this full well. They know that ad spaces get stale, because you learn to ignore them. That's why they need to keep pushing into new spaces; to find different ways of getting in your face, interrupting what you're doing. They're basically trying to trick you into paying attention to their ad. That's why the NY Times article you're reading suddenly slides down and you find yourself watching a GoDaddy video, it's why people keep coding new popups, it's why advertisers want access to message your phone, etc.   It's all about finding, tracking, corralling, harvesting and processing advertising's most lucrative resource: your attention."

tech,31sin3,Sacrix,6,Wed Apr 8 15:07:58 2015 UTC,"I agree with this quite a bit. If we could legally regulate web advertisements that would be tremendously helpful. Another reason I installed Ad Block is because some file sharing websites will have multiple download buttons and some of them are ads that lead to an unrelated link, often with malware. We need no pop-up ads, no misleading ads (like a fake download button), no autoplaying video ads and a limit of the number and size of ads on a webpage.  I also like the idea of FairBlocker, except that instead of donating only to some sites your money goes to all of the ones you access. That seems fair to me.   Of course there remains a dilemma: even with more ethically sound alternatives at a reasonable price, there is still zero consumer incentive to go the route that's not free when one could just as easily choose the free route. What is the solution? I don't know, but I can say this: We need to change the structure of this problem, by inventing a middle ground that makes sure content creators are paid (fairly) without refusing someone the right to choose not to see an ad, and we need to consolidate any payments from premium ad-free content into one easy to manage system. If we don't change this at a fundamental level, there is going to continue to be a game of tug of war that will only end badly for everyone."

Then again, Flattr, Patreon, and ChangeTip have been moderately successful on pretty much the same benefit.    Having spent a lot of time working on this problem, my belief is that we will see publishers start blocking ad-block visitors or at least restricting their access. A lot of sites are doing it already. Personally, I don't think it is the right approach, as it is rare that content is actually unique on the web and thus users will find other sources. A Fairblocker user should still be able to access the site, despite the ad blocker. That is when there will start to be concrete incentives."

It happens even on websites you know and trust, due to the fact that the ads are allowing a 3rd party to run unverified code on my computer. I might trust the website creator to not inject malware into my browser session, I might even trust the advertising company they hire to run ads, but I don't think I can trust the company that wants to make an ad, let alone the contractor of the company who made the ad.

tech,31sin3,mrbooze,114,Wed Apr 8 10:01:32 2015 UTC,"The problem here isn't ""omg, ad-blockers are bad and are ruining the web by starving content creators!!""  The real problem is that ads are a terrible way to get paid that no one likes, and if your paycheck depends on doing something that people find annoying, people are going to eventually come up with workarounds to be less annoyed.  I found this part hilarious:   Most ad blockers (Adblock, uBlock, AdGuard) have made literally zero effort to find a middle ground between publishers and users. They make a business out of blocking all ads and seem to stick their fingers in their ears and yell “la la la” when it comes to discussion of the problems they’re creating for publishers.   Yes.  Much like antivirus makers have made literally zero effort to find a middle ground between people who want to infect computers, and those computers' owners.  This isn't a place where adblockers need to compromise.  At the end of the day, the computer is owned by the user, and as such, only runs whatever software the user wants to run.  (And more importantly, renders what parts of the web-page the user wants to look at.)  Ads are shown only at the sufferance of the computer's owner.  This is not really negotiable.  Ads are a band-aid, to give the creators some semblance of income based on their content.  Ad-blockers are a bandaid, to deal with the imperfect solution that is ads.  If there is going to be a solution, it needs to be in some new model that lets people pay for things without ads, and gives them a reason to want to.  Otherwise we're just going to slapping crappy fixes on top of each other, in a sort of fumbling arms race, until the whole thing collapses."

For example, let's say I go to a website out of curiosity. I've blocked all those ads, but does that mean they'll still make money off of me?

It starts a transition from sites getting paid by advertisers based on a quantitative measure (views and clicks) to sites getting payed by their readers, which is more of a qualitative measure.  Also, it's MUCH more healthy to have the audience be the customer, instead of advertisers."

One or two smartly placed ads that sit off to the side or mix well with the content.  There are just too many pure clickbait sites now that do nothing but throw 15+ ads at you while having little-to-no real content.  Even on sites with some good content they easily go overboard.  Not only that, but it has become a privacy issue as well.  When you go to one site it may spider out the tracking info to dozens upon dozens of other tracking sites.    Same way I'm starting to feel about some Youtube content as well.  These small content producers run ads before the video, then you get an in-video ad when it starts, then another at some point before the end.

tech,31sin3,speccy2,18,Wed Apr 8 00:30:58 2015 UTC,"Users choose a small monthly contribution (as low as $5), which we then divvy up and pay out to publishers where ads are blocked. Interestingly, $5 per month is just about enough to completely replace the revenue from ads.   Prior to using adblockers, I didn't click on ads on sites that I visited for purposes other than buying. My contribution to website revenue through clicking ads was therefore zero. My contribution after installing my first adblocker was also zero; the only thing that changed was my viewing experience.   But what about impressions? Trickier than it looks. Most are fishing for click-throughs to be effective, but full value may be reached for some just by reading the information in the ad, eg announcement of an upcoming event. An unknown amount of value, but still greater than zero, may lie in increasing brand recognition, or putting a brand high up in a consumer's mind when thinking about a certain class of product. After all, this is why Coke spends billions. On the other hand, when they get this annoying, you have to wonder if they can actually decrease brand goodwill.  Advertisers wouldn't use them if they didn't think they had some effect, so I won't make any dubious claims about my personal resistance to their message. What I can say is that according to the wisdom of the market, impressions are hundreds of times less valuable than click-throughs.  Which brings us to $5 a month. Google's Contributor program, the same idea, allows as little as $1. I would argue even that is an overestimation of the lost revenue I, as an adblocking viewer, represent to content creators.   There's precisely zero chance of me paying $60 a year to avoid ads I would never click on anyway."
tech,31sin3,zacksinclair,5,Tue Apr 7 23:07:37 2015 UTC,"I wrote another post on the same blog that estimates how much revenue a given user is worth to the publishers of the web - it is roughly $6 per month.

I'm also working with a handful of early adopters (Fark, Destructoid, Moddb have all endorsed us) to get the ball rolling faster.

Frankly, it is relatively unsophisticated so far, both because it does not adjust payments based on the type of ad blocked and because it does not consider time spent (eg Buzzfeed click bait is valued equally to a long form piece you spend an hour reading). Our roadmap is to weight payments based on time spent and give users the ability to blacklist sites they don't want to support."

They can sell me page access a la carte if they like.  What need is there for your product as a middleman?  (Since it adds costs which would take money away from the sites I'm trying to pay.)    Additionally...  The adblockers are doing what their users (in this case me) want. Why should they respond to anyone other than their users?  You said that adblock makers have made zero attempt to find middle ground between their users and the publishers.  Why should they?  Sites staying profitable is not their problem.  What would you say to users of those blockers like me who know that there is no middle ground.  I wish to view zero advertisments in my life, not a single advertisement ever.  Period.  There isn't any middle ground with me.  They can ask me to pay for access, they can force me to login and thus block access if I don't pay.  But they can't make me view ads."

We don't know yet. The idea, though, is that it is a pain to subscribe to sites across the entire web and that people, as you said, want no ads across the entire web. We combine those two things to give users the ad blocker they want and enable contributions to sites while doing so.   In the long run, having a commercialized ad blocker should lead to a better product, as that additional cost you identified funds the development of the blocker itself.    They can ask me to pay for access, they can force me to login and thus block access if I don't pay. But they can't make me view ads.   This is exactly why we are doing FairBlocker. There is no whitelist (like Adblock Plus) so there are simply no ads. Our method should allow a user to access a site, even if they block other ad block users, as our user is paying."

But that well was poisoned with shocked monkeys, foreground stealing full screen windows, and literal malware serving flash and java ads.  If services want to somehow conform to an acceptable use policy (no flash/java, nothing obnoxiously flashing, etc) then I'd be happy to whitelist them. Unfortunately, AdBlock Plus takes money for their acceptable ads program if the service is sufficiently large, so that well's already looking bad."

tech,31sin3,bithead,4,Fri Apr 10 01:16:02 2015 UTC,"Hi all, i am the author of one of ad blockers mentioned in that article.  What they say about ad blocking is true. At least these parts:   I’m not the only one; multiple reports indicate ad block rates are rising rapidly. If you’re a tech or gaming site, it is common to see a full 50% of your users blocking ads.  Most ad blockers (Adblock, uBlock, AdGuard) have made literally zero effort to find a middle ground between publishers and users.   I mean there is ABP with their acceptable ads policy but I can't take it seriously, for me it looks more like a business plan.  So we were thinking about that ""middle ground"" for years. About a year ago we have come up with the same idea as FairBlocker - to give users an opportunity to contribute to the sites they use. But we had to drop that idea. The problem here is the same as with acceptable ads policy - it is bad when there is only one company that controls everything.  After all we have come up with another idea, very simple and straightforward. It is Users who should be in control of everything. Not some company managing a whitelist or redirecting your contributions to site owners.  In a month or so we will introduce a new experimental ad blocker which will be our attempt to find a compromise."

What's really happening is that add blockers have given visibility to how much people hate all ads.  On an old fashioned tele-vision, the remote gave people the power to turn off ads, but that wasn't measurable.  Even farther back, there was not real way to accurately or realistically gauge the degree of rancid hatred for having five pages of magazine ads to every page of content.  Nor was there any way to really how much people hated those little drop-out subscription cards.  But believe that such shit was and is hated with force.  So now that the hate can be acurately measured, the response is ""please don't [CASH, CASH, CASH! TOO MANY BONES AND NOT ENOUGH CASH? SELL YOUR EXTRA BONES FOR CASH! RIBS, SKULLS, SPINES, EVEN CERTAIN LITTLE EAR BONES! THE LEG BONE'S CONNECTED TO THE... CASH BONE!] hate us.  Pretty please.""  Moreover, if online ads weren't just online version of the same old repugnent shit they might get by but for the fact they slow down responses on sites where they don't appear by virtue of the load they impose on the browser.  What if an ad on channel 5 blocked out the other channels?  I'm sure advertisers ejaculate in their shorts at the thought of it, but that would be just shitty and everyone would hate it.

At the moment, as far as I know, there are no real limits to what they can display as far as advertising goes. We currently have advertisements that auto-play videos, which tend to play at about 5%-500% louder than everything else. A loud obnoxious voice shrieking ""Congratulations, You've won!"". We have ads that can completely distort the actual content of the page you're trying to view, rendering it useless. Some ads are multimedia shitstorms, taking a hell of a lot longer to load than the page itself. Some don't work will with plugins and will crash flash/shockwave/silverlight/realplayer on every tab you have going.   Or, in short, it's an absolute cluster-fuck.  If ad agencies would use reasonable ads that weren't invasive bandwidth-hogging shitshows, I'd have no problem uninstalling my adblock software. Hell, I disable adblock on pages that I know aren't blasted with advertisements, but they are very few.   The ball is firmly in the advertiser's court. Adblock is a service that people want, and they will flock to whatever platform allows them to do it. Unless they make a major change in the way that they throw ads at us, I don't really see that going away anytime soon."

Users had to turn to popup blockers and later full on ad blockers to protect themselves from what was essentially a form of harassment. Yes ad blockers are harmful and have far more collateral damage than necessary, but they are a problem the industry created itself by abusing its customers and the advertising industry needs to accept that blame and deal with it rather than attacking and vilifying users.   Here's an idea. How about forming something like an internet advertising trade organization, set some standards for high quality, reasonable internet ads, then getting the main ad-blockers on board with allowing those ads. Keep everything above board and honest, and it will be easier to pressure the major browsers to black list ad-blockers that continue to block the ""approved"" ads."

tech,31w2t9,JimmyBuffer,2,Wed Apr 8 16:47:05 2015 UTC,"Well, it reduces flexibility for you, the user, if a motherboard has the CPU soldered down on it (though Intel would like this future). There are lots of choices in terms of what CPU to get regardless of Intel or AMD. In terms of motherboard features, there is again great variability.   If you want to build a bitcoin mining rig, you want a weak CPU, but as many high speed PCI-E slots as possible. However, barring that niche use case, you would expect that people who want many PCI-E slots are high end gamers, who also want a fast CPU on the board. Then again, you might think that an FX-6300 (or an i5-4690) is good enough, you don't need an FX-8370 (or an i7-4790k) for your multi-GPU setup.  Someone else might want to never use a dual-GPU setup, but wants a high end CPU. If you tried to classify use cases, a single GPU setup would be 'midrange' and thus deserving of a midrange CPU.  The space of combinations available between motherboard features (many PCI-E slots/ built in WiFi/ Small form factor/ Lots of SATA ports/ etc) and CPU performance (how many cores/ speed/ threads/ etc) is too broad for the manufacturers to make sensible choices for users. It's better to sell the CPU and mobo standalone, and let the user decide.  For a GPU, there isn't much variability between board features, so it's reasonable to make 2-3 variants of the gfx card based on the same GPU chip. Further, neither AMD nor Nvidia releases more than 4-5 new chips every generation, v/s the much larger spread of CPUs every generation (FX/A series/Athlon/i[something meaningless]/Pentium/Atom/Celeron)."

Take a wander over to /r/buildapc and there will be a lot that are slight variations on a theme, and when it's time to upgrade they start a whole new build.  If some manufacturer offered the right components soldered on a board all hooked into one central cooling block, I'd give it some consideration. There may be certain amounts of redundant circuitry that could be eliminated as well, for example the power delivery for the GPU and CPU, knowing a smaller range of components will be on the board may let them tune it a little in BIOS, etc. Essentially a different place on the spectrum between PC/laptop and console/fixed hardware devices.

tech,31mawx,ReyTheRed,1 point,Mon Apr 6 16:57:57 2015 UTC,"Some places do have designated charging stations, others don't. The beauty of electricity is that it is so malleable that you don't need expensive specialized stations to charge. A simple adapter of the right kind will get you going.  Specialized stations are good, as they can provide more energy than an outlet intended for powering something smaller, but given an overnight stay, even a small trickle of power adds up."
tech,31mawx,SplitReality,2,Tue Apr 7 06:48:43 2015 UTC,"I didn't know that you could literally plug an electric vehicle into any old outlet. My other question would then become practically how did they do it. Walking around with a long extension cord at a restaurant looking for an outlet has to raise some eyebrows, and I can't imagine any manager having an incentive to let you run that cord back to your car. Someone could trip over it and sue."
tech,31mawx,Dark_Shroud,1 point,Tue Apr 7 09:44:46 2015 UTC,"The people I know with EVs carry long cords in their trunks. My friends with the Volt ran the cord under the door a few times.  I talked to someone with a Tesla Model S. He carries both a 40' & 80' extension cord. He learned where the local places have their outdoor outlets. So he'll park in back of restaurants and plug in to top off while dinning in.  The people who have EVs literately just get used to keeping in eye out for outdoor outlets. And because the auto industry agreed on a standardized charging port we'll be seeing places starting to add EV chargers, probably pay to charge, in the next few years."

tech,31mawx,Dark_Shroud,1 point,Mon Apr 6 18:48:19 2015 UTC,Not really. Most hydrogen is made from natural gas because that's the current cheapest method. At that point its more efficient and less costly to just use the natural gas.  Hydrogen fuel cells require a lot of rare earth materials vs batteries that are fully recyclable from any power source.
tech,31mawx,ReyTheRed,2,Wed Apr 8 09:42:22 2015 UTC,Yes there is. If nothing else for heavy hauling.  If you are driving truck weighting 40 tons for 2000 km then electricity becomes extremely impractical power source. Batteries to move that would have to be huge and they would take big part of the payload and lot of room. Charging batteries that size would take tens of times longer than charging regular passenger car batteries would take. 15 minute stop every few hours to load your car batteries is not big deal. 10 hour pause  every few hours to load your truck batteries is huge problem.

And you are wrong about it taking so much longer to charge the batteries. If you have enough power available, it can be done just as quickly. If you have 10 times the power, you can charge 10 batteries just as quickly as you can charge 1. If you invest in the infrastructure, the limiting factor on charge times becomes the batteries ability to take a charge, which means you can charge 10 different 100 kWh battery modules to get 1000 kWh at 10 times the rate you would charge a single module, because you can do it in parallel."

You get a compromise of a car when going that route.   Part of the reason the Tesla Model S is so good, so roomy, and so safe is because it was never designed to be equipped with a gasoline engine.  Sure, we'll get more attractive cars like the e-Golf, but they will be worse, less practical vehicles than their gasoline twins.  Auto manufactures just need to put as much design effort into their EV's as their gasoline vehicles, and stop catering them to the Prius-driving environmentalist crowd who wants their vehicles to look ""green."""

Gas, diesel, hybrid, electric, etc. It's not like they're just slapping a battery on it. It was planned for a long time and designed very well, like a Tesla."
tech,31mawx,Eaglehooves,3,Mon Apr 6 16:18:43 2015 UTC,"A fair point. Looking at the eGolf, it looks like they did a pretty good job of hiding the battery, which is the most obvious sign of a retrofit. The Ford Fusion Energi has barely any trunk space, for example.  Where is the battery in the eGolf? Under the back seat?  *Edit: Found it! This is definitely designed more like a Leaf than an Energi.

tech,31mawx,jonjiv,4,Mon Apr 6 17:47:52 2015 UTC,Because the features you traditionally associate with cars like the aztek or the leaf decrease drag on bean shaped cars that people want for some reason. For instance the bumpy top headlights are actually there to push air around the mirrors.

The original Prius looked kind of funny, and not in a particularly good way. It wasn't ugly, but it wasn't a good departure stylistically from the mainstream ideas. Since then, it has improved significantly.

The fact that an engine is as cheaply manufactured today as it is is a testament to mass production because the level of complexity, the tight tolerances, the many machining operations seen by an engine would otherwise make them cost an exorbitant amount of money.  EVs still need suspensions, and a platform to bolt everything to.  They still obviously need a body, and interior bits.  Still though, at their core is simply a battery pack and a motor.

Batteries are getting better slowly, and electric cars are getting more common on the roads.  People seem to think that there will be some overnight revolution in battery technology.  That's not going to happen.  The reality is that the economic model for owning a car was built in an era when gas was plentiful and pollution wasn't a concern.

Although, do you know what it takes to produce those batteries... it's not very green at all.   If a 1 hour charge will get you 500 mile range, I think that would be more than adequate for most commuters.  There are other answers. I personally think it starts with Nuclear power to produce base load electricity without CO2 emission, electric cars for short range and hydrogen fuel cell vehicles for long range.

The problem with saying things like ""if 1 hour charge gets you 500 miles"", is that that will take decades to get there and even then not be super practical. You're talking about a charger than can put out half a megawatt of power. Roughly the same amount used to power 85 households. Even if you could do that, it would put substantial strain on the battery regardless of the tech.   We can push the tech all we want, but the reality is that we need to start considering as a species that owning your own car and driving long distances by yourself might not be the best for the environment. Gasoline was fun while it lasted, but it begets a lifestyle that just isn't sustainable.  Ride a bus, a bike, carpool, walk, etc if you can.

A Nissan Sentra is about $17k 4 Oil changes a year for 5 years is about $600 over 5 years. So $17,600 for 5 years.  Now it comes down to fuel. I have no idea how much it would cost to charge a Leaf for say 20k miles per year. But, for the sentra assuming about 32mph and gas of $2.90/gal that's $1825/yr or 9,062 over 5 years. You've still spent @10k less buying and operating the ICE car than it would be just to buy the Leaf and replace the batteries 5 years later.    We can push the tech all we want, but the reality is that we need to start considering as a species that owning your own car and driving long distances by yourself might not be the best for the environment.   I also argue that we should use the tech available to us to give us the lifestyle we want. For example, there is enough thorium to create enough electricity for everyone in the world at 2x the current US individual (which is the highest) for like 400 years. But, people would rather say ""conserve energy"", that will solve the problem. Of course, that is the fossil fuel industries mantra.  If we converted 100% of electricity generation to nuclear and solar and other non-greenhouse generating methods we could still use fossil fuels for transportation and still reduce the per-person carbon footprint tremendously.

tech,31mawx,DruidGamer,0,Tue Apr 7 20:10:38 2015 UTC,"1) The average commute is about 40 miles. It turns out you need about 5 times that to handle the extreme cases of a normal driver's use, but that isn't a huge amount.  2) bigger batteries can be charged faster. Think of it as charging 100 small batteries at once. If it takes 20 minutes to fill up a small battery, you can fill 100, or 1000, or as many as you want in 20 minutes, as long as you have the power available. This means that as batteries become cheaper, large batteries, which are easier to charge quickly also become cheaper. Combine this with the paradigm shift of charging the car without your direct supervision and without a highly specialized filling station, and EVs actually take less of the drivers time to re-energize than a gas powered car.  3,4) EVs are so much more efficient that the break even point in terms of emissions occurs well before either car comes off the road. The fact that building an EV is actually more energy intensive than building an ICE is completely overwhelmed by the per mile emissions of a gas car. Within 2-4 years, the gasoline powering an ICE produces more pollutants than the grid powering the production of an EV.  Here is the best analysis I've seen of comparable vehicles. It is pretty in depth, looking at the production, use and disposal/recycling of three different types of vehicles in real world conditions. The result of all this analysis is that EVs are actually much cleaner than diesels or gasoline cars.  You are correct that today it is cheaper to buy a gas car than an electric, which is utterly missing the point of the article linked. Today, a Tesla is a great deal compared to other luxury cars in its class, but the luxury performance class is not affordable. But as the price of batteries drops, as this article suggests will happen, the price of EVs will drop to the point that the most affordable car in the near future will be electric."

Factors like gas prices and maintenance costs are not insignificant.  Electric motors are simpler, so they should take less maintenance to keep running once we accumulate more experience in using them in cars.  The gas savings are also pretty significant. I've seen estimates as high as $2000 per year, which is nothing to sneeze at.  An EV that costs less to make than an equivalent ICE car would sell like crazy. Most EVs today face the difficult question of whether it will pay off after 10 years of use, and most EVs still aren't quite up to the expectations of most drivers. Whether paying 30% more up front, but paying 75% less per mile driven, but only getting 90% of what you want in a car instead of 95% is worth it is not an easy question to answer."

Although, I think I would lease it so I don't have to worry about replacing the batteries in 3 years. The car is on the pricey side to buy as well.  I'll have to read the link you sent, but I wonder if they consider the generation of the electricity used to charge the cars.

tech,31mawx,CaptaiinCrunch,2,Tue Apr 7 16:07:56 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the leaf with its 80 mile range is not enough to be the only car for most people. But if you have a 200 or more mile range car, that is all you need.  And batteries don't need to replaced every three years, if you abuse them like you we do when we run laptops and phones with them, they ware out pretty quickly, but if you put in a little effort in the battery management system it lasts much longer.  And yes, the report I linked does take into account the generation of electricity. Even burning coal, EVs are so efficient that they emit less pollutants per mile than gas cars, hybrids come close to a pure coal EV, but don't quite make the cut. In the real world, where there is a mix of generation sources, EVs are far cleaner."

tech,31nf17,ReyTheRed,1 point,Tue Apr 7 00:34:31 2015 UTC,"Can you provide evidence that conventional batteries are not safe?  What I have found so far is that batteries are about the safest energy storage known so far. I'd love for them to be even safer, but I'm sick of this idea that they are dangerous. Energy storage is inherently dangerous, because rapid releases of energy is dangerous, and having a lot of energy stored enables that.  Batteries are not perfectly safe, but they are by no means dangerous.  Also, charge rate is overemphasized when it comes to batteries. In almost every application, if you plug the thing in when you aren't using it, it is back to full charge when you need it again.  There are also few metrics that are missing here, they indicate that the batteries have less power than lithium ion batteries, which isn't ideal, but not a deal breaker, but they also fail to give the energy density of the thing.  Until they can give good numbers for the energy density, power density, and price tag, I'm not going to take this as a serious piece of technology."

Plus, competition laws don't just let any company buy whatever they want to buy. It's why Google couldn't buy Twitch, for example. Right now, Cyanogen is probably too small to be protected by that but a bigger Cyanogen probably would.   Without acquisition, there's no way that Google can shut down Cyanogen. How could they possibly do it? Cyanogen's OS is not falling foul of Google's certification so far, so Google has to allow them Google services. Google can't just arbitrarily fall them for no good reason. If Google was seen to be treating Cyanogen differently to other OEMs then that would be pretty anti-competitive."

tech,31gq62,Theprefs,1 point,Sun Apr 5 06:07:50 2015 UTC,if you overclock too much you're likely to run into cooling problems.   I was always under the impression that the lower air volume in small cases meant it was fairly easy to quickly replace old air with new air. If you ignore that there are more things obstructing airflow the same 120/140 mm inlet and outlet fans would recycle the air in a small case much more often than in a large high volume case.   This all obviously means nothing if you have a nest of ribbon cables running through the middle of the case or something but if you use a modular power supply and have decent cable management cooling really shouldn't be much of a problem.

Don't misunderstand me, I love ITX motherboards and the potentially increased versatility they represent.

tech,31gq62,wallgomez,-2,Sun Apr 5 05:38:31 2015 UTC,"Yes it does.  In fact they should probably never get small, as if you make them as large as possible you can have more of whatever you miniaturized, thus making them more powerful.  When it comes to computing, you want as much power and space as you can afford.  Smaller isn't inherently valuable, particularly on the scale of a normal house or apartment.

No matter how powerful, a CPU is only a few square centimetres in size. Over the past decade, we have gradually seen many functions previously the domain of the motherboard come to be physically present on the CPU die. At this point, most motherboards are essentially just power circuitry, the chipset, and routing to IO, PCIe and RAM. The size of the motherboard mostly just affects the number of PCIe and RAM slots.  Looking at modern full-size ATX boards, they're almost all padded out with unnecessary crap such as 3rd-party SATA controllers or audio chips. Unless you actually need that many PCIe slots, there's really no reason not to go for a smaller form factor, and there are plenty of advantages.  My current gaming build is an absolute monster in a full-sized tower with SLI, a watercooling loop and an enormous radiator. It's also horrendously impractical. My next build will be far smaller; probably micro-atx rather than micro-itx, but nonetheless in a smaller form factor and with as small a case as I can get away with without compromising performance."
tech,31gq62,cretan_bull,0,Sun Apr 5 05:03:48 2015 UTC,"If he's only talking about the crap they stack into the mainboards I agree entirely.  I don't understand how a full tower is impractical.  It sits under my desk and doesn't take up useful space.  It's much more powerful and stays cooler while overclocked than will ever be possible in a smaller form factor, and that is unavoidable due to the nature of transistors or anything similar.  You will have to compromise performance, or cooling.  200mm fans or watercooling are needed to keep modern high end video cards cool.  I have a Surface Pro and a smartphone for anything I need mobile, I don't understand how that extra few cubic feet of computer is an issue unless you live in a 20ft shipping container."

Normal sized PCs can have problems fitting the graphics card so I wouldn't have expected this to fit one.  I still would only get something like that for a HTPC/steambox or if I run into some weird problem of wanting to travel with my desktop. I just don't mind the box taking up the amount of space it currently does and that is with it on the desk. I also like having a bit of space when I'm trying to do things inside of the case.

The conversation went something like this (paraphrasing):  Moderator: ""Microsoft used to really suck, and they were really anti-open source. But now they are open sourcing things like CLR on GitHub. I bet one thing they will never open source is Windows.""  Mark: ""You never know, it's definitely possible. Crazy stuff happens.""  Nothing more on the subject.   So ... yeah, probably not.

After the audit, submitted code is carefully examined to make sure that no single function is implemented in a non-clean manner.  Here's a quote from the ReactOS audit page:   1. A function is deemed to have been implemented in a non-clean manner if   ""unknown"" arguments given values functions for which there is NO DOCUMENTATION functions with no test cases available either in ReactOS or somewhere on the internet functions with undocumented magic numbers functions with excessive gotos   NO DOCUMENTATION means it cannot be found on MSDN, Google, sysinternals, osronline, any book published by Microsoft Press or any other publication.  2. The following does not count:   functions of 5 or less lines of code functions for which every basic unit corresponds to a clause in the official functions which mimic those implemented in other libraries and that work similarly   3. Even if the function body is not clean, the prototype can remain.   The results of the audit were that no Windows code was found in ReactOS."

tech,317pfu,whitesleeve,2,Thu Apr 2 21:50:45 2015 UTC,"You miss the point as people often do. Lost in the rhetoric.  Microsoft gets control of a segment and then does not change anything. It makes things require more power, generally larger, and it provides a means to support newer versions of existing technology. Very little new stuff happens in each release of Windows or Office. There are new skins and things get moved around but it remains fundamentally the same OS.  What I guess you want to argue is that Apple doesn't invent anything, which is not completely true but lets give it the benefit of this argument. Apple still adds features to things and changes. In fact it does so at a rate that often irritates people.  In no particular order, the touch mouse, the app store, haptic feedback, the mac pro using only external expansion, hand off, micro sims, unswappable batteries, health kit, facetime, BLE support in phones, fingerprint security, RFID etc. Yes, Apple originated only a few of these things, but they do keep implementing them and pushing them out. They are not content with dominating a market and then bloating.  For example, the new Macbook has one port and that annoys people. Apple is pushing them toward new ways of working and some of them complain about it. It also has haptic feedback and force clicking. The watch of course, is coming up. Who knows if it will succeed? It's certainly not the first smart watch. But that is a sign of a company trying new things.  Google does this also, almost always before Apple although with somewhat less focus. Its core remains search and data but it does experiment with new technologies. Self driving cars, Glass, Project ARA, Project Tango, Project Loon, creating its own ISP, etc. Maps and Streetview are considered Google inovations (although they didn't invent maps or photography). Google had Wallet long before Apple did ApplePay, but the financial industry support was poor because of Android's open nature.  But the sad fact is that subs like this are anti-Apple. Even though I've made points for Microsoft and Google, and I could point out problems with Apple if anybody asked. People don't want an objective discussion, they want to take sides and argue from prejudice."

It's used to describe that flavor/experience/mouthfeel of eating meat, aka: savory. Well, a problem for a lot of people, especially new veggies,is the huge umami power vacuum in most vegetarian foods. People try to substitute with things like amino acids that are veggie but still give some of the flavor/experience/mouthfeel of meat. Well, chili has a few things going for it that would appeal to a veggie:its loaded with protein, which most veggies don't get enough of; it's stew-like preparation can more easily mask ""meat"" and tofu than other meat-substitute dishes; and it's usually made with tomatoes, which are also known to have umami properties.

tech,30x6dm,Ajaargh,6,Wed Apr 1 01:38:24 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure how new it is but it certainly seems like a natural evolution. I suspect the difference is more due to improved cameras and displays though as autoloaders aren't anything new.   Current Russian tanks use autoloaders but the price of that is keeping live ammo in the turret compartment. The Abrams stores its ammo in a separate blast resistant container, precluding the use of an autoloader. This design offers the best of both worlds, you get an autoloader but the crew is protected from ammo explosions by simply not being in that compartment.  That's to say nothing of the advantage of having a small dense crew compartment. Not only does the crew section becomes a much smaller target, you can have much more armor protecting the crew for the same amount of weight."

tech,30x6dm,Townsend_Harris,3,Wed Apr 1 03:05:30 2015 UTC,"It's still not a clear win for the autoloader. A human loader can make more efficient use of space and so access more ammunition in the same space. There's also the ancillary benefits of having an extra man on the crew.  It does still get rid of the biggest downside to the autoloader, which is the tank getting hit and everyone being burned alive by the ammo."
tech,30x6dm,Innominate8,3,Tue Mar 31 20:45:02 2015 UTC,"Sure, all things considered I tend to prefer the autoloader.

The equation has shifted for the modern battlefield. Anti-tank weapons have reached the 'repeating rifle' point and are rapidly approaching the 'machine gun' point. I have no clue what will come next to break the stalemate, but I fear the next war will be a repeat of WWI where artillery kills so many men that suicide charges against machine guns are the only real options left. Of course tanks will be used....and destroyed like the men. Of course there will be aerial battles but antiair is almost to the same point as anti-tank weapons.

tech,30x6dm,LOHare,4,Tue Mar 31 15:24:04 2015 UTC,"Correct, but the current hardware works well enough for that already. We already have over 8000 Abrams tanks and Russia already has over 2000 T90s - if you need more than those then either you're fighting in too many countries at once or are fighting a peer (imo)"
tech,30x6dm,fishdump,1 point,Tue Mar 31 17:56:59 2015 UTC,There's no way AA could itself control the air. With modern stealth technology is unlikely they'll even know they're there let alone be able to destroy them. Hell the SR71 was virtually invincible to AA and that was designed years ago.
tech,30x6dm,tdogg8,3,Tue Mar 31 15:31:18 2015 UTC,"That goes for both sides - you're back to pre-radar dog fights and air raids. Any older aircraft can still be shot down, but the newer ones will struggle just to find another plane. However the fact is that radar is already catching up with the stealth tech.           The SR71 was only invincible because it could sheer outrun the missiles. If you can build a manned jet to go that speed then you can easily build a missile to shoot them down. We have rockets that out strip the jet's speed launching weekly around the globe."

The fact that they managed to get them all in there is probably preferable to the average user to 2-3 type-C ports or even swapping one or two out.

A while back, I used an electrician that got extremely high reviews (the highest, or at least top 3 in Chicago if I remember).  I wanted about 20 light switches/outlets replaced with new hardware, and a ceiling light fixture replaced.  He came over the first day with another guy and they finished about half the job.  So, I paid two guys for a whole day's labor to do half the work.  Then, the second guy dropped and the one who was left to me couldn't get his schedule together.  He no-showed two or three times in a row.  When he showed up to complete the work, it turned out that one of the outlets had to be rotated 90 degrees to fit.  So, he tore up my drywall to do that and left me with a big hole that I had to patch and paint.  That meant he also had to come over for a third day to finish that work and wrap everything else up.  Overall, it was a horrible experience with all the delays and paying for essentially 3.5 man-days of labor for that job (and also doing part of it myself).  After that, I canceled my Angie's List subscription."

The FAA is treating the drones Amazon has been testing as if they were finished products, not prototypes, and so the newer version they are trying to test now is different from the one the FAA approved, rather than categorically approving their testing, or even doing it on some sort of project based license or whatever.

Amazon could do this as long as they had someone behind the controls, but that's not what they care about or what Amazon wants to test.   Amazon needs to work on setting up an airframe for approval and then move on to automization. You can't expect the FAA to trust you if you haven't proven that the thing won't fall out of the sky."
tech,30syf8,Panaka,7,Tue Mar 31 00:52:33 2015 UTC,"Not to mention, the FAA has experimental licenses and stuff they've gladly issued out.  What it comes down to is this: Amazon doesn't want to wait for the FAA, so they're using this move to Canada to generate negative PR for the FAA in the hopes they can strong-arm/lobby the government to make the FAA change.  The FAA is, above all else, interested in safety and these are the same rules that EVERY aviation company has to go through.   Amazon says the FAA is stifling development, when in reality the FAA is telling them that they won't let Amazon release untested products into US airspace without going through the same certification program every other aircraft/UAS does, in addition to the FAA working on defining the standards/rules for drones as they proliferate."

The fear is that these policies enforced by the FAA will drive away innovation. I don't think one way or the other but I think it's a moot argument because they will have drones in the U.S. Nobody ignores the U.S. market because of it's extreme size.

It sounds a bit too chicken and egg really, if you can't test it you can't prove it won't fail, etc. and handing it off to the FAA would cripple the trial and error process."
tech,30syf8,Crysalim,3,Tue Mar 31 00:55:56 2015 UTC,"The biggest issue here at least for me, isn't the testing the autonomy, it's that Amazon wants to take certain airspace and use it commercially, but not play by the rules. Right now Amazon needs to prove that they can build an airframe/platform that won't fail (or buy one that's already approved). Once that happens, then they can move on to the autonomy tests in the middle of the desert (but they don't want to test there, they want to test in Washington).  In reality, Amazon just wants publicity. They KNOW the FAA will not budge on anything unless Congress orders them to or they do a decade long study on the topic. Sure you could spin this as Amazon trying to bring about change in a slow system or innovating, but it's only because that fits their vision."

tech,30syf8,mirror_truth,7,Tue Mar 31 00:56:06 2015 UTC,"Who cares if it falls out of the sky if it's being tested in remote safe places designated specifically for testing?   But they didn't try this. They skipped the whole step of getting an approved airframe and they wanted special treatment from the FAA regarding airspace.  If Amazon had been serious about this in the US, they would have either bought an airframe that was approved or developed their own platform (something they will inevitably have to do if they want to upgrade and operate in the US unless the FAA caves big time). Then they would have proven that it was airworthy through human remote trials. After all this, then they could try for the autonomous tests.  Amazon though just wanted to skip to the last part with the perks of getting to fly past 400ft in an area that they didn't get approved to do. They wanted to get through as quick and cheap as possible, something the FAA has no ears for.  On top of this, the FAA even caved a little allowing Amazon to not have to have an approved airframe even though it'll be for commercial purposes."

I don't know how effective the FAA is at dealing with current regulations as it comes to drones, but considering the speed at which the tech is developing AND the ability for other governments to deal with it, it doesn't appear to be doing its best."

tech,30syf8,Funktapus,7,Mon Mar 30 17:31:30 2015 UTC,"I'm thinking it's a smart phone app. Scenario: A person must be present to accept the delivery. When the drone is a few minutes away, they get a notification asking them to hit a button if its clear to land. The drone lands, they inspect the package. The person clicks the next button which 'signs' for the package and clears the drone for lift-off. That addresses both the signature aspect, as well as some safety/liability concerns about making sure the landing area is safe."

The person is emailed the code and location.  These bins can be on roof tops or areas that don't have a lot of traffic and have ample room for the drone to operate such as parks.  I don't see drones delivering directly to the door.  Too much can go wrong.  People capture and steal the drone or people getting injured.
tech,30syf8,Funktapus,1 point,Mon Mar 30 18:53:21 2015 UTC,That's the most sensible approach in the short term IMHO.

Into that aerial slice the company plans to pour highly autonomous drones of less than 55lbs, flying through corridors 10 miles or longer at 50mph and carrying payloads of up to 5lbs that account for 86% of all the company’s packages.   We've already seen toy/hobby-quality drones injure somebody.  If an Amazon drone suffers a something like a disabling bird strike, that is up to 60 pounds coming down hard and fast.

If Amazon gets the regulatory approval to fly unmanned systems, it will be the first civilian program to enable this. Maybe there could be a market for it, who knows. All things considered, Amazon is paying a few engineers to experiment with cheap quadcopters and find out if there is something there. You can argue against its utility, but its ultimately small potatoes for Amazon. Certainly much less of an undertaking than Google's self-driving cars, and with potentially even fewer regulatory hurdles.  Also an interesting thought experiment is the old comparison of a fiber internet connection to a truck full of hard drives. One has lower latency, but one can deliver a fuckton of information with a significant delay. Maybe drones will be useful for transferring terabytes of data between nearby computing centers.

Helicoptor propellors will have higher linear speed towards the tips of the blades and higher angular momentum, therefore is more dangerous. The Amazon drones I've seen has lots of smaller propellors.

When you're the only thing operating at 1700 +/- 25 ft for at least a few tens of miles, that problem becomes a lot easier to deal with.   Edit: to bring it back in to my original point of ground vs air, ground has to deal with fewer ""objects"", yes. But it also has to obey Street signs, signals, actively avoid non-automated vehicles that behave unpredictably, etc. The only thing an airborne drone has to do is fly in a straight line to its destination while maintaining a mostly constant altitude (simple in clear weather), then descend in a vertical path without hitting anything. Then reverse to get back to base. Hell, I've done this with Legos in a half credit college course."

You're also assuming they'll be small and nimble. Something large enough to carry a package is going to be heavy, including the mass of whatever its payload is. It will have more inertia to compensate for, when interacting with other drones and making 'quick' navigation changes.  Then there's the issue of drones falling out of the sky due to hardware failure. If you maintain a fleet of 100, it's likely the failures could be kept minimal, because you can keep a decent maintenance and testing schedule, but a small fleet hardly seems worth the effort.

And you've got wires and lights and all sorts of other crap to deal with. Maybe it even has to fly in a window. Think that's easy to automate?   So what about the opposite situation, deliveries to the middle of nowhere where there are no roads for regular delivery (Antarctica for example)? That means range issues (you're not going to have a warehouse anywhere near there), so you're going to need relatively large drones that carry lots of fuel.  I think there might be a market there, but it's pretty small."

Just look on YouTube for videos of people kicking them and they just return to a stable hover.   And certainly, they wouldn't want to actually fly into people's windows. Just land in a roughly car sized parking space. Yeah, maybe delivering to a dense urban area is a little ways out, but landing in someone's driveway would be cake. Or on a properly outfitted rooftop. Better yet, they could just hover at the skyline and lower the package by cable, like a search and rescue helicopter. Brings up security issues at that point, but meh.   And long distance, yeah. Probably out of the question. For now."

Better yet, they could just hover at the skyline and lower the package by cable, like a search and rescue helicopter.   I think this is actually the best solution. I assume these drones are only going to be for rapid package delivery, so a person is going to be waiting for the drone. Just having to hover and lower (and probably actually drop) a package strikes me as an easier problem, and also gets you more exotic delivery locations like ships at sea (I could easily see some rich asshole on a yacht paying a lot of money to get a cellphone battery delivered by drone)."

So let's think about that for a moment. The only practical applications are delivery of light items to people who live in cities. You're absolutely right. There aren't many people who fall into that category /s  The delivery systems aren't mutually exclusive either. Drones don't have to replace ground delivery. How about drones replace light local deliveries, and heavier items are delivered as they are right now.  Tell me how many packages you get delivered to your house by cargo planes? None?

Basically, I'm saying that for Android phones, Google Maps refuses to remember your last few searched addresses (for directions) unless you have location turned on. There is no technical reason to prevent the phone from remembering your previous searched locations and conveniently popping them up. Instead, Google just prevents this feature unless you enable them to know your location. Google seems to try to be passing 'knowing your location' off as a technical necessity when it isn't at all. Remembering the previous places I've searched and knowing my location are two completely separate things. If I want Google to synch my searches across all devices, it still does not need to know my location in order to do that."

My first gut reaction was that maybe the devs kinda flubbed the coding to get it out and had some clause that was dependent upon knowing your location to allow them to find a route because it is maps.  At first that makes sense because they would want the app to run as smoothly and quickly as possible, and if it needed to fetch your location every time you selected a different destination it would slow the app down a lot, especially if a search pops up with a bunch of locations.  But thinking about it some more does lead to some questions.  If I do not need location or any web connection why would it require your location to bring up search history.  It is odd to require such a thing.  Unless it caches last known location and just substitutes that for current location and allows you to bring up the last searched addresses.  It is certainly hard to tell if Google is acting with malicious tendencies or if the devs are derping and not coding to the standards in which we expect, which can be a lot at times."

I know it's still collecting the data and I'm just not having it shoved in my face, but to me that's kind of the joke of it, a lot of this wouldn't raise anyone's hackles if they were just more discrete about it.  Like, okay, I like that Wallet has the means of scraping my Gmail account for package deliveries and putting that all in one place. It's convenient and I already know that Google does automated scraping of my Gmail to show me ads so there was no psychological hurdle to get over there.

tech,30qud4,Destects,1 point,Mon Mar 30 16:05:31 2015 UTC,"Tracking the package... So they know where it came from, which would give them (Google) the name of the company it was shipped from, which could give them a good idea of what is in the package too. Maybe not specifically... will depend on the type of business, whether it's an original manufacturer, wholesaler, or a distributor, or resale biz' will make some bit of difference.  They can compare that data with all of the other packages shipped from that location, and also compare that data with the data from all the other users that have also had packages shipped to them from that location.  Along with all the other shipments, you and others have purchased... for instance, you might be purchasing, RC car parts, Even if Google doesn't know what kinds of things were shipped to you from that location, if you often purchase those RC car parts from other vendors, and other people also do the same, Google will figure out over time that that particular location, very likely sells RC car parts.  But it might not be RC car parts... it could be shoes, or dildos, or fruit or whatever... no matter what it is, Google will know because of the associations it can make.  Don't underestimate what Google can learn about you from your purchasing habits combined with all the other data it collects."
tech,30qud4,SCphotog,1 point,Mon Mar 30 03:53:36 2015 UTC,"Can never underestimate it, Google is the king of data aggregation and analysis. As scary as some people feel it is that google gathers so much data on them; they forget that that data is what makes their tech so convenient to use; you can get a route using maps in seconds because instead of keeping the address you're routing to and your current address on your phone, and calculating the route locally, you send those bits of data to a server with 100x more power, and it crunches the numbers and calculates the route. That's called convenience. Traffic information, package tracking, updates on your schedule, alerts about your area, what to watch, what to read; Netflix and Hulu use your watch history to determine what shows you may like and recommends them, amazon uses your search and purchase history to figure out when you'll want to buy something so it'll recommend just the right deal at just the right time. Services have become intuitive. It's only an invasion of privacy if it's happening without your consent; map's wont let you use maps without consenting to the ""enhanced gps"" stuff because the app just doesn't contain the functionality to perform searches, generate routes, etc, without the use of that service; not using it is saying you'd rather calculate everything, and search locally, on your device, which is asking for a burned out battery, and hours of route calculations just to go out to dinner. Why would google want to give its users a bad experience?  And then there's the whole ""other apps"" thing... Google Maps API, any app that uses it, would be part of that ""other apps"". You do infact have the option to pick and choose what apps do or don't have access to your location, it's called the install screen; There's this window that tells you all the permissions an app will require in order to function, and if you don't want to give that app all those permission, don't install it. You can't pick and choose which apps get what permissions. It just doesn't work like that; I'm a software developer, when I write a program, one of the steps in the process is to setup the requirements that program is going to require in order to function. If I write an app with access to API XYZ, and then put in the requirements that it needs access to XYZ, you can't then install it, block it's access to XYZ and expect it to function; you'd be lucking if it initialized; that's like asking your phone to boot without access to the hardware interface because ""I don't want my OS to know about my SIM card, or read my location"".   /rant   TL;DR: If you don't like something, that sucks, but when it comes to software, expecting something to function at it's best while denying it all the data and access it needs for said functionality is just ludicrous."

Google definitely went way outside of my comfort zone when I woke up one day to a Google Now card that had a traffic report between my apartment and my office...Google had figured out where I lived and worked based on just using my location data and where I spent my time over the course of the day. Although to be honest I was probably more bothered by having this shoved in my face while I was half-awake than by the overall privacy intrusion.  In the scheme of things I do ultimately trust that Google's scanning of my information (emails, location, etc) is just automated stuff geared toward tailoring ads toward me. I'll be the first to admit that maybe I shouldn't be making this leap of faith with Google but to me, a machine scanning my emails for keywords is simply not the same thing as a human being sitting and reading each and every email.  And running with the email example, any email service that you're not running yourself implicitly has access to your emails. Again, I'm not exactly thrilled with what Google does with my email but in the scheme of things I'm relatively confident that what they're doing with my email is a lot less fucked than what they could be doing with my email, and compared to a bunch of random small-time email providers I'm relatively more comfortable trusting Google with this information."

In 2014 Cree announced they broke 300 lumens per watt in the lab but most the light bulbs available on the market cheaply are still around 100 lumens per watt.   Incandescent are about 15 lumens/watt. CFL are about 65 lumens/watt. The cheap/popular LED bulbs are about 75 - 85 lumens/watt.  There are bulbs like the nonoleaf that list 120 lm/watt. The 40w vintage/Edison style LED's are also about 100 lm/watt.   LED's are already the overall cheapest option but not by so much yet that companies are removing CFL's from shelves or anything yet. With as much as cost and efficiency have improved over the last few years it might not take that long before it happens though and there are other applications like portable displays where a 10-20% improvement can make a huge difference to battery life.

At 12 cents per kWh a 100 watt incandescent bulb costs close to $20/year to run for 4 hours a day so depending on your usage the 3 way LED might still be worth it. They have 3 way CFL's too but even they are $12 each.

Adding a restroom to a short distance commuter bus would take up space and weight (lowering fuel efficiency and requiring more gas) while providing no real way to convert it into a meaningful amount of biogas. It would be like trying to install heavy solar panels to the top of your electric car.
tech,30m8m9,HomelessJoe,5,Sat Mar 28 19:45:06 2015 UTC,Running the numbers for fun.  The city bus consumes about 45 m³/100 km biogas  Each kilogram of biodegradable material yields around 0.4 m³ (400l) of gas.  So you need 112.5 kg of 'human biodegradable waste' for 100 km of driving or roughly about a kilogram per kilometer.   People produce up to half a pound of excrement or feces each day.  So you need the waste of two people per day to run the bus one kilometer.  Typical figures for a bus is about 100 and 200 km per day  So a 200 to 400 people needed to let a bus run each day.

I mean it's progress, sure, and having competition for Samsung should do wonders for pricing, but... it's just not that much of a breakthrough.  Toshiba-Sandisk's upcoming 3D NAND should be a bigger deal, since they're going for 48 layers (Samsung and Intel-Micron are at 32 layers)."

If you still have issues with TLC over MLC, then take them somewhere else."
tech,30jk24,chubbysumo,7,Sat Mar 28 13:49:52 2015 UTC,"That's just not true. The Samsung 840 Pro lasted a lot longer than the Samsung 840. Those two drives use the same controller, and the NAND is very similar apart from being MLC vs. TLC.  Clearly, MLC has a lot more write endurance than comparable TLC.  What the experiment did prove is that the write endurance of TLC is sufficient in practice, at least for consumer use. Who cares if the MLC SSD will last longer, as long as the TLC SSD lasts long enough."

The significance of this is that in GSM terminals wouldn't authenticate the towers, but in UMTS they do.

So you would gain a low level of security for a large level of inconvenience. If the cops set up a stingray near your house, you would get an alert of having changed cell tower, and that's about it. If you added something like a history of towers and tower strength related to your geoposition, the system might get to a medium level of security with medium inconvenience.   The device specifically imitates a cell tower, so it would look like any other tower on the network.

If they had a warp engine, meaning they are bending or warping space around it and riding the wave....wouldn't this also deflect those photons?   I guess it's possible if they haven't figured out warp engines, we'd be able to detect it."
tech,30djk3,ComebackShane,1 point,Fri Mar 27 00:04:13 2015 UTC,"The asumptions is that the photons will be bent and warped, but unavoidably some will reach you.  Imagine a clear and still pool, that is huge. The room on which the pool is dark except for light that comes from the bottom of the pool. If something were to disturbe this pool, the waves would distort the light that goes through them (deflect and move photons). This is what you observe.  In the same way ripples, warping and bending of space would deflect photons, and that's what creates the disturbance that can be seen. The only way to undo the effect is to be able to warp space-time in the opposite way, but that would basically slow you down, which kills the entire purpose."
tech,30djk3,karlthepagan,1 point,Fri Mar 27 01:49:57 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the explanation. That does make sense. I was just picturing the warping having a similar effect to metameterials.

I think there's a fair give and take because the gov can impose regulations, while companies can have have input and lobby for what regulations get implemented. they can also find ways to minimize impact of regulation on their business. or, in many cases, just flat out ignore the regulations altogether. because of this back and forth I feel like regulation isn't as evil and prohibitive as some people think."

tech,30b309,him_again,11,Thu Mar 26 10:54:54 2015 UTC,"I help get stuff through FAA cert regularly (usually 2-3 certs a year) and I wouldn't say the FAA certification process is all that bad.  There are systems in place to delegate approval to a fellow employee (yes there's room for conflict of interest there but the FAA takes auditing and directing the delegated reps seriously).  It isn't trivial, but I wouldn't call an FAA cert a wasteful mass of red tape and bureaucracy.  More of a worthwhile attempt at holding aircraft development to rigorous standards for the betterment of the aviation industry.  Maybe that sounds too positive, but I've worked with much worse regulatory agencies."
tech,30b309,ItsMeCaptainMurphy,10,Thu Mar 26 01:35:11 2015 UTC,"I think a big part of the issue is that, traditionally, devices that fly had to have humans inside them, piloting them.  Due to this, there's such a litany of things airframe companies like Boeing have to go through before they can call a new technology ""safe.""  I have a friend who engineers for them and they went to Russia to dump a 787 in a frozen lake and test how resilient the structure was.  Pulling in data to make sure it can withstand the most severe conditions.  They were there for months. (This was all several years ago, before the current Crimean crisis which has sparked so much new animosity between US/Russia) This was after he spent nearly two years making a flight simulator that didn't just simulate flight to the pilot, but simulated the kinds of pressures and forces the airframe would experience while in flight, testing each part to ensure they meet safety specifications.  A drone with a guy controlling it with a cell phone doesn't need that kind of development time.  It took an ice age to develop an airframe that could be signed off by the FAA, and since the development moved at a glacial pace, it really didn't make as much of an impact that the FAA moved glacially as well (obviously there is still an impact when you're dealing with bureacracy.).  When you don't have a pilot inside a flying device, the need for a huge number of safety precautions is suddenly out the window and drastically reduces the development time and cost."
tech,30b309,iamacontrarian,19,Thu Mar 26 01:45:50 2015 UTC,The problem is that delivery drones will have people underneath them as they fly to their customer. A 400 pound drone falling from 100m up will kill people on the ground even if nobody was manning the aircraft.
tech,30b309,deadaluspark,4,Thu Mar 26 11:57:42 2015 UTC,"Where did that 400lb figure come from? None of those delivery 'drones', as they seem to be called now, look to be even 40 lbs (and a 6lb ArduCopter is enough to deliver a pound of payload anywhere)."

tech,30b309,geeky_username,0,Thu Mar 26 13:03:56 2015 UTC,"So will a huge airliner that weighs a metric fuckton more than than that.  Plus that airliner has to be designed to attempt to save the most lives in the most catastrophic kind of situations.  Thus, the sheer cost and time spent developing small drones with safety in mind is still much less than that of a commercial airliner/military aircraft, which is what the FAA has traditionally dealt with.  The A-10 Warthog took 8 years to go from initial plans to actually being rolled out on the production line.  The disaster-ridden F-35 took 10 years from signing the project deal to making a single maiden flight of the F-35A.  The development time for human-piloted airframes of all types is just typically much longer than for drones, due to sheer size, cost, and safety concerns.  I mean, come on, drones are being printed by 3D printers.  They can't possibly be being held to the same standards as parts for airliners, which need to withstand all kinds of stress."

tech,30b309,asheriel,11,Thu Mar 26 03:16:56 2015 UTC,"I'd say it isn't the drone part- so much the actual flying part.  Military drones are basically regular airplanes with no pilot. We have a pretty good idea how jet engines perform, how airframes perform, how autopilot and avionics models work in regular winged powered flight, etc.  Drone rotary craft- helicopters- are also very well understood.  Both fixed wing and helicopters also have ways to land gracefully in an engine failure.  Either just gliding to the ground, or autorotating.    With multirotors...the safety and reliability of an unstable airframe powered by electric motors is pretty damn new and radical- at least in aerospace- especially when these airframes aren't usually flying tens of miles in a go.   Multirotors also lack safety in engine out.  Granted, the more rotors, the more it can safely land, but if the power dies all a sudden to the rotors, that thing is essentially turning into a missile with amazon prime slapped to the side."

They're so bureaucratic and slow moving that it seriously limits and cramps GA and below in this country. You can't sell different kinds of wheels on a plane without it being put through hugely expensive and lengthy approval process, and then if one of those planes crashes you're still going to be sued, likely now twice, one for the wheels and one just because almost every crash seems to result in a lawsuit anyways.  But somehow their ridiculous approach to single people just trying to fly for fun isn't even the worst thing about them, they've done nothing to stop the flood of lawsuits and litigation that's killing the GA industry without even noticeably improving safety (accident and fatal accident rates have been stable since the 1980's).

If they just said that flying a plane is like driving a car, all your responsibility, fly at your own risk, it would cut down on the excessive litigation in the industry and free up their resources to maybe look into new drone legislation or something."

I forget the numbers, but I work in the industry and Canada has granted a large number of SFOC (special one time use permits) for drones, IIRC a few hundred per year for a few years now.

We on the other hand have to pay hundreds/thousands every time we want have a manned aircraft fly aerial photos.   A low flying drone over a forest in rural Maine poses no threat to anyone. Competition with cheaper lumber however has put a great many people here out of a job and under the poverty line.

There are so many potential variables such as weather hazards, physical obstructions, range limitations, crazy people shooting down the drones to steal packages and what not.  Unless I completely missed the point(which is entirely possible, then please down vote) there is little chance this would be remotely practical. It would be cheaper to just delivery via vans on already well established routes. I dunno maybe Amazon already realized this(if I haven't made an ass of myself) and this is just a false flag to back out."
tech,30b309,ItsMeCaptainMurphy,3,Thu Mar 26 14:08:31 2015 UTC,"I think some of your concerns are valid. We are in a very early stage when it comes to quadcopters. We do know how to set up way points that drones can fly to. However, most quadcopter enthusiasts know that you don't deliver heavy packages with a straight up quadcopter. Instead, do what Google's project Wing is doing and use a plan that is capable of hovering. Then lower the package on a tether in order to prevent people from damaging the drone."
tech,30b309,IlllIIIIIIlllll,9,Thu Mar 26 14:16:31 2015 UTC,"Weather Hazards: I'm assuming that the drones are water-proof. Apart from rain what other weather hazards are there? Strong winds? They could just not fly the drones when it's not feasible.  Physical Obstructions: They'd be flying a few hundred feet in the air. There's probably not going to be anything there. If there are then sensors on the drone could detect it and just go around, but that may not even be required since they could probably just map everything out in advance, eg send up a drone loaded with sensors to scout out all permanent obstructions at certain heights to map out the area.  Range: Assuming the range is actually an issue, one solution might be to set up battery replacement areas where the near depleted battery is automatically swapped out with a fully charged one.  Crazy People: IMO it wouldn't be that big an issue. There would be extremely hefty repercussions for shooting down a drone, let alone the fact that they're firing a gun at private property. If there are other drones in the area they might be alerted to such incidents and diverted to the downed drones location to record and stream video of what happens on the ground, so it seems very unlikely to happen in urban/suburban areas. Rural routes might be more susceptible, but they could just fly much higher on high-risk routes.  The drones might turn out cheaper for a number of reasons.  1) Fully automated delivery: No need to pay for drivers.  2) No/very low traffic. They can more or less take a straight route to their delivery destination without any stops(aside from other deliveries)  3) They might set up more local delivery hubs. Vans bring all the deliverys that need to be made in your neighborhood to your local neighborhood hub. From there drones do the final leg of the delivery. At least I'd imagine this would be more efficient than vans going around delivering to the door. With this range becomes a lesser issue."
tech,30b309,powermad80,2,Thu Mar 26 15:13:47 2015 UTC,You've defiantly given this some serious thought. They really seem more plausible now.
tech,30b309,reallivenerd,1 point,Thu Mar 26 11:33:31 2015 UTC,"Apart from rain what other weather hazards are there?   Wind. Snow. Sleet. Hail. Anything that significantly decreases visibility (either actual or electronic). Extreme temperatures one way or the other (can a drone work in 115 degree (F) weather and -30 degree (F) weather?). You already pointed out wind and rain.  There are entire seasons for large chunks of the country that may qualify as not being feasible depending on how they work.   There's probably not going to be anything there.   Unless you're in any major city. Then there are buildings. Also other drones. What happens when an Amazon drone and a FedEx drone take the same path without knowing what the other one is planning? It's almost like you'd need some sort of standard for a transponder to be set through regulation to avoid that kind of issue.   Crazy People   Crazy people do crazy things. There are idiots who shine lasers at manned planes, and there's no financial incentive to do that. Bring down a drone and there's potentially a decent payday depending on what it's carrying/the drone itself.  Additionally vans can make a ton of stops. The distance between stops in urban areas is probably really low for a delivery van. Companies pay hundreds of millions of dollars to ensure that their routes are as efficient as possible today. A drone can only carry so much and unless the drone is the size of a truck it's going to be a lot less than one truck can carry, meaning there's going to be a lot of back and forth trips to the local distribution center.  There are certainly benefits to drones, just saying it's not the miracle land of rainbows and sunshine that some people make it out to be (not claiming you're one of those people - in general reddit seems to take a very optimistic look at new tech to the point that some users will ignore any potential issues/downsides)."

Well-implemented sensors could navigate around any unpredicted obstructions. Crazy people could be avoided by maintaining a high altitude (not to mention drones are so quickly mobilized and fast moving that crazies couldn't possibly be prepared for one even if they were crack shots). Weather patterns could just be factored into the routing, or perhaps shipping just delayed until conditions lighten up. My view of this is that it just needs the right programming and hardware and it'll be a robust system that'll deliver competently."

tech,30b309,jayfehr,2,Thu Mar 26 05:19:00 2015 UTC,"But what's the point, besides same-day delivery of an order for a premium price? It's faster and cheaper to send out a truck with 50 packages that get delivered in 2 hours than it is to send out 10 drones that make 5 trips each with one package per trip."
tech,30b309,DJ_MD9,1 point,Thu Mar 26 06:00:40 2015 UTC,"30 minute delivery times would be faster than going to the store, shopping, standing in line, then driving home.  Imagine that every city that has a Costco also has an Amazon drone centre. The same sized building can house more sellable items because all the space, both floor and vertical would be used for inventory. A small team of people prep the small items and send the drones off. There are many ways to save over traditional retail.  For larger items, those would still be sent out with trucks and drivers. They would load up in the mornings and afternoons, do their rounds and people could still get same day service."
tech,30b309,Absinthe99,1 point,Thu Mar 26 21:21:48 2015 UTC,"Yes, for one person. But consider your Costco example for a moment. Costco has about 3,000,000 customers per day spread among its 600 stores, for an average of about 5,000 customers per day per store. Let's overestimate and say that 4/5 of those customers are buying an item that can't be shipped by drone, leaving just 1/5 customers---1,000 per store per day---that can have their purchase sent by drone. And let's underestimate further and say that these customers are only buying one item.  1,000 of these customers in, say, an 8-hour day means one customer every 30 seconds on average. Sticking with a delivery time pegged at the 30-minute timeframe you propose, this breaks down to something like the following:   2 minutes for replacing drone battery to a charged one 5 minutes for packaging item and attaching it to drone 8 minutes for drone to leave packing zone on conveyor, wait in take-off queue, and fly off from take-off pad/zone 10-15 minutes for the drone to fly to your location and deliver item (25 - 30 minutes delivery time achieved) 10-15 minutes for the drone to fly back to the drone center and land for battery replacement.   This means a drone will require a cycle time of about 45 minutes per delivery (until it's ready to repeat the procedure with another delivery). This means that in 8 hours, it can do 10 deliveries.   In turn, this means that the drone center will need 100 drones to be simultaneously active. Doesn't sound like much, until you realize that it's 100 simultaneously active drones that are required to support just one-fifth of the total customers at one store.   Again, one thousand drone flights by at least 100 different drones in one day to deliver items to just 1/5th of the customers at one single store. Works for one store, but it's very difficult to scale to something larger or to more stores, because then you'd have thousands and thousands of drones flying overhead in tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of drone flights per day per city. The noise from this alone would drive people insane."

Source    And that's locations/stops -- not package count.  Moreover they do their best to optimize that delivery along routes, so that there is minimal overlap, and minimal distance/time between locations.  By contrast a drone service would basically be a horrendously inefficient ""Schlemiel the Painter"" style system -- needing to make a separate flight from the distribution center AND back again, for each package, much like Schlemiel going BACK to a paint can for each brush load -- and the only way to reduce the inefficiency of THAT is to have LOTS and LOTS of little ""mini-distribution centers"" scattered everywhere (i.e. like retail stores).

There are so many potential variables such as weather hazards, physical obstructions, range limitations, crazy people shooting down the drones to steal packages and what not.   Yes, even if you completely ignore/dismiss all of those problems.  Well, among other things -- except perhaps in high density areas* -- if the drone has to travel any significant distance, it would be highly inefficient** (from an energy & equipment standpoint).  Just like the proverbial ""flying cars"".  I really think the whole thing is a PR stunt -- and they are COUNTING on the fact that the FAA is going to ""disapprove"" -- which allows them to be ""in the spotlight"" (and obtain free ""advertising"" via the news); yet at the same time, negates the need to actually ""deliver"" (if you'll forgive the pun) on the purported promise.  Face it, the cost of creating a prototype drone, and making what really amounts to an ""April Fools"" style prank video -- is dirt cheap compared to all of the free coverage (and probably even an ""image"" and ""stock value"" boost) that the stunt gained for Amazon.    * Akin to places with Bike Messenger services. And that -- high density areas -- of course creates other problems. Exactly where (in some high-rise apartment or office building) is the ""drone"" purportedly going to be ""dropping"" these packages?  On the roof?  It would essentially have to be left there... because no other location is going to be practical (unlike delivery men or bike messengers, drones cannot open doors {much less can they ride elevators up to a specific office, talk to or register with get permission to enter an office or obtain signatures from receptionists, etc}; and even if they could, no one would want the things flying indoors). So where else could they leave the package? By some freight drop off location? Leave it at the front door or on the sidewalk? Basically ALL of those options would be LESS convenient for the package recipient (who would then need to personally or have some staff member go FETCH the package from the roof/dock/sidewalk and take it the last X00 yards).  The only way that I could see ANY of those drones working would be if the end destination has made some special provision for receipt of packages by that means -- i.e. some office building has a ""drone delivery"" spot that is both specifically accessible, AND which will then immediately handle/process getting the packages to the right location/person within the building.    ** And the ""demo"" video, showing the thing dropping the package on the front stoop of some suburban home -- is rather laughably ridiculous.

They just aren't being nearly as permissive as some people would like.  Part of the problem is that until drones can reliably avoid other aircraft, having them operate unattended in a shared airspace is a bad idea.  So that pretty much leaves you only with populated areas under 500ft, where everything else has traditionally been banned. But that area is risky, which is why everything else has been banned.  Also, it's not like drones are new. They've been around for decades. It's just that they're entering the mainstream now and people are not used to the existing restrictions affecting them.  It's kind of like how we want self-driving cars to be allowed on the road, but we want it to be done very carefully. We don't want any old yahoo to be allowed to stick a camera and servos on his car and send it off on it's own, on shared roadways.

If there are 5x as many non-Tesla users as Tesla users then they will lose at least $12K per car on electricity fees.  Besides, if they don't let 60kWh Tesla owners charge for free, why would they let non-Tesla owners charge for free? It makes no sense."

Superchargers are the ones built by Tesla themselves. You buy access to these charging stations when you buy your car. If you buy the 85kWh car, then access is built into the price of the car. They're quite fast and can charge from 0-80% in an about ~1hr. Tesla is also building battery swapping at some of the locations, where you can swap your batteries in about 3-5 minutes. Right now, it's still in the beta phase and you have to make an appointment to use the service.   Destination chargers are put in by the establishments that they're located at, e.g. hotels, restaurants, shopping centers etc. They're usually the high powered wall chargers that you can buy off the Tesla website. The establishments pay for the chargers and usually for the electricity because they want to attract your business or the type of people that own Teslas.   Source: My fiance and I own a Model S.

That's around $3500 adjusted for inflation today.   I'm pretty sure the Lisa logic board was worth a lot more than that, but I can't remember specifically what it cost.  We didn't work on them very often...no one was buying them because Apple set a ridiculous price of $9,995 retail for it when they brought it out, and you could buy almost three fully configured PC XT's for that price.  All in all, that was Apple's first real foray into corporate arrogance and in a lot of ways, it was the beginning of the end of their dominance of the personal computer marketplace...of which they owned 85% of only a few years before.  They say it was manufacturing costs that made the unit cost so much, and there may be a little truth to that, because if there was one place IBM completely outclassed Apple from day 1 it was in manufacturing.

Their solution was to make sure the server has no hard drives so it keeps everything in ram, and  instead load the keys from a secure remote location.The rack was locked, and covered in black cloth to make sure it's pitch black inside. They then fitted light sensors inside and a camera, so that if anyone managed to open the door, the light got in, and the sensor would activate the camera to see who's breaking in, and the server would immediately destroy the data in ram.  If you know which Reddit comment I read this on, please do link it below this comment. It'll do a better job of explaining it than I can with my shitty memory and it means I can attribute the original commenter.  Anyway, making the servers have no drives/only use drives for non sensitive data and doing something similar to this could potentially work. It's also possible that you could only do this with servers that don't deal with anything sensitive to begin with (such as some nodes for some cluster being used for scientific research or something)."

And keep in mind that datacentre temperatures are very closely monitored, usually with alarms that activate if a server's temperature is outside of specific temperature parameters, someone's bound to notice a temperature drop of around 100°C and go and investigate. And for such a high security server, they'll probably nuke the data from the ram just in case.  Also, even if there's no temperature sensor (which would be extremely unlikely in a datacentre, especially considering servers have temperature sensors built in), you'll probably end up with condensation from such rapid cooling anyway, which'll probably trigger moisture/humidity sensors."
tech,304ijy,Anon123212321,1 point,Tue Mar 24 20:05:59 2015 UTC,"Liquid nitrogen is pretty compact for the cold tank, and having it stored at high pressure will help with quicker cooling.  You need to get the times down to the second anyways, since most CPUs shut down below a certain temp.  Since you cut the power afterwards (as in ""a sec after you are done cooling"") they don't have time to see the sensors showing the temp drop, just the server go down suddenly with all readings quickly showing weird and apparently nonensical data a few instants before. So no way they can nuke RAM at that point.  The hard part would be putting everything back and in a nice fashion quickly. Then when they come to check, it just looks like the server shut down for some weird reason."
tech,304ijy,hey_aaapple,2,Tue Mar 24 20:16:06 2015 UTC,"Even if you do manage to cool the whole rack down, which I doubt you'd manage with a tank of LN2 that's small enough to conceal since racks are pretty big, the door opening sensors would still likely activate. And even if you somehow managed to get into the rack without anyone noticing, someone's going to notice the server turning off pretty quick, and so no doubt will send someone out to investigate. When they investigate and it becomes obvious that someone's broken in, then the first thing they'll do is radio security to lock the place down and make sure noone leaves before you even manage to get out of there. And don't forget that camera inside the rack that I mentioned earlier. They'll already have your mugshot, not to mention they'll probably have CCTV monitoring the whole datacentre anyway. Finding out who did it is simply a matter of checking the rack camera and CCTV footage and comparing them to the people who are now locked in the DC."

Carrying in the LN2 and hiding it is thus a non-issue.  The sensors should go down with the temp drop, if they don't (really really unlikely) the power being cut off would prevent them from sending any data.  That is why the hard part is putting it back quickly. You'll prolly have less than one hour before someone comes in to check (being unmanned racks, I doubt it would take less than 30 min).  The cam inside the rack is in the darkest dark (as you mentioned the light sensor), can't record in infrared because the stuff in the rack is emitting a lot in that wavelenght as it is heated up to a nice 40-60 C°, and will shut down anyways with the cold.  If you didn't hide the break in properly (possibly messing with the CCTV if there is any) you are a moron.  The whole thing could be passed off as alimentation problem if done right."
tech,304ijy,hey_aaapple,2,Tue Mar 24 20:55:38 2015 UTC,"Ah, I was discussing the datacentre I mentioned in my comment.  There are still some tasks that would be suited for an ""unsecured"" server, such as CPU intensive scientific research. Being very CPU and/or GPU intensive makes it ideal for heating homes. In fact, charging a little bit of money for the heating could be a good way to subsidise the costs of  resource intensive research. You'd have to be stupid to put a server holding sensitive information in some random person's house.  As for the camera, IR would absolutely work. The IR that cameras can detect and the IR released as heat radiation (which is actually a small amount since servers are cooled via conduction and convection rather than radiation)  are at completely different wavelengths. Just point your phone camera at your PC if you don't believe me.  Another option could be to have small datacentres in high density living spaces, such as blocks of flats. Since you'd need more heat, you could stick more servers in, meaning the cost of security per server is reduced, meaning having someone monitoring the DC is more plausible."

You could prolly work it around with really near-red wavelenghts, but no idea how much that would cost if it is even possible, and it would still be blinded in case of sudden luminosity change. If you use a camera that gets IR from extending its spectrum past visible light (as in a normal camera) you are definitively going to blind it when the rack is opened. But you might get to see the intrusion with the cooling device.  Need to try that at lab tho, sounds like a good way to waste a day."

After that, I listen to a lot of music on my phone, and then you take some pictures, record some video, and you got no room left.   So yeah, I could have opted for the 32gb model for huge price jump, or I could just pop in a $20 SD card and not worry about it. As illustrated, memory is fucking cheap as hell, and the exorbitant price jump is simply not merited. I see this as a cash grab on the part of Samsung."

Mostly sonar based. As these are private roads, regulations requiring human drivers on public roads do not apply. As speed is so low, car can stop immediately - never any chance of collision (although car may potentially get confused and go the wrong way). Automatic parallel parking. Probably anywhere.

They may have set thresholds for recognition and rejection that allowed it to make this mistake."
tech,301r5q,DiggSucksNow,3,Tue Mar 24 13:58:21 2015 UTC,"The trick here is they generate white noise images that have the right pixel mix to fool the result generation of the neural net to match the training. You can't simply keep feeding the neural net ""negative"" white noise images and tell it that its not a dog because well there's quite an huge(not infinite but up there) amount of combinations that could fool the algorithms used in the net. Basically its like hash collisions, you aren't really attempting to use the same original text, you just have to generate random garbage which will algorithmically equal the same result. This is why hashing like md5 and sha1 is deprecated because its now too easy to generate collisions. The same problem is occuring with the nets.  The problem here is the neural net doesn't see patterns like we humans do. We see white noise and immediately say that clearly isn't a dog, the neural net sees a white noise image and it will go and compute data from the various pixels and results in some numbers that it says are a dog. We humans have far more storage and processing capability in our brain than the software is designed to do. Our neurons may do similar computation but there are numerous upon numerous kinds of computations in sorts of ways beyond just a simple image visual computation. I believe the paper is more of a warning that people shouldn't be getting too ""excited"" that their fancy neural net is able to do X,Y,Z because there are dangers/flaws because its still subject to the rules of math. In the far future when neural nets it may not be as much of an issue but right now it is if say some guy decides to create a neural net biometric fingerprint scanner or something for ""security""."

So it should be possible to say ""Make sure you don't detect this nonsense image as a dog,"" but the challenge is that there will be another nonsense image that it still recognizes as a dog.  I'd be very curious to see it highlight the features it detected. I know that with OpenCV, you can make it show you where it detected a face, eyes, and mouth. It'd be interesting to see which blob of pixels the DNN said was a dog's nose, for example.  I also think it's cool that they used what appears to be (by description) a genetic algorithm to arrive at these nonsense images to fool the DNN, since, I think there's also a genetic algorithm at the heart of the training system for DNNs."
tech,301r5q,DiggSucksNow,10,Tue Mar 24 16:57:37 2015 UTC,"Whilst a valid point I don't really see how this actually has much security issues.   Or an apparently abstract image might be accepted by a facial recognition system as an authorized visitor.   Surely you would just use an actual image of that visitor if you have that level of access to the (assumed) camera inputs. Plus you should not be using facial recognition for access to systems, at the most it should be a username.  Also machine learning especially when it comes to image recognition etc is still obviously under development. This article just seems to somewhat state the obvious with how these systems will get it wrong at times.

tech,301r5q,Plorntus,2,Tue Mar 24 01:48:17 2015 UTC,"They could be a security risk because a system using facial recognition should exclude very close matches to previously taken images of a face that might be accessible to the public, otherwise a person could just use that image to log in.  Obviously you shouldn't use facial recognition over the internet, though, so it may only be used in very strange circumstances.  Changing the image to one of the fuzzed ones will make the image appear genuine as they vary significantly from existing images."

Granting them for theoretical ideas or as a way to guard against a competitor using a method you have no intent of using yourself is the problem. It should be harder for patents to be awarded, and their detail should be granular. A patent should also be invalidated if their owner can't show a good faith effort to use the patent within a short window of time (say five years), and lawsuits should be thrown out when the patent holder hasn't applied the patent within one year of filing the suit.

That is how it promotes innovation. What would be the point of dedicating your life to creating something if it meant someone else could step in and exploit your work without you involved? (Which is what China is doing, ripping off US innovation.)  Incidentally, this is also why patents need to expire.

Then, at a precise moment, they basically intend to pulse a set of lasers in the direction of the blast. When the lasers are focused onto a point in the sky, they ionise the air and create their own little explosions. Here's a tech demo from a Japanese company where they intend to create holograms with it. The differing atmospheric properties of the ionised air explosions then interferes with the incoming shockwave, causing it to reflect and refract, in a manner which is modelled to direct most of the blast elsewhere, or at least enough to not destroy the vehicle."

The ZEUS-HLONS system was a co-operative effort between SPARTA, Inc. and NAVEODTECHDIV (Naval Explosive Ordnance Disposal Technology Division) to demonstrate that a moderate-power commercial solid state laser (SSL) and beam control system could be integrated onto a Humvee (HMMWV) and used to clear surface mines, improvised explosive devices (IEDs), or unexploded ordnance (UXO) from supply routes and minefields.

That just tracks missles and shoots them out of the air with a laser. Impressive technology all the same, but it's not quite as 'full coverage', if you will, as a force field would be. It can only shoot down one missle at a time for instance, if you're bombarded with missles it could be overwhelmed. A force field is more like a wall and will protect in every direction simultaniously, and passively."

This was a few years ago when Petman had a few videos out there as an armless walking robot - the guy in the presentation told us about a chemical suit it can wear to detect oxygen levels, physical hazards, etc and went on to say that they were using additive manufacturing to develop these complex articulating pneumatic hands that could grip and use pressure sensors for regulating grip strength.  Since then, they've come out with the video seen in the link above showing the suit and working arms, but I have yet to hear anything more on the pneumatic hands and that was 4 or 5 years ago."

tech,2zzxew,kryptobs2000,5,Mon Mar 23 12:56:29 2015 UTC,"The vast majority of 'uncle sam's secrets' came from private contractors to begin with. When people say 'government tech is 15 years ahead of the public sector' what they really mean is 'private contractors tech' eg Locheed, Northrop, etc, the government does very little themselves. Think of the government more as a huge bloated team of middle man that's primary purpose is to cause chaoes and disorder in an attempt to find the contractor with the best proposal to move our money around to as many hands as possible while getting the bare minimum done to make it look like things are being accomplished, while also ensuring there's perpetual work to keep the money flowing.  When I worked for one such contractor (I was a subcontractor from a subcontractor of a subcontractor who, afaik, subcontracted from the contractor). Everyone between me and the company who held the multimilliondollar contract did nothing but skim money off the top and pay people to do the job for them (and obviously many just did the same thing while skimming a smaller portion off the top). So you had a team of people like me at the bottom making 15-20$/hr while the people directly above me were making 100$+ an hour for the work we did, who knows what was made above them. Meanwhile at the very top the company that was awarded the original contract baught off the shelf hardware, slapped their stickers on it, and charged, I shit you not, a 2000% markup on the hardware alone. Of course they did some other things like making an absolutely god awful software interface that was buggy and hard to use... in a warehouse in the states, I can't imagine using it while being jostled around in a humvee while in combat. That's of course when it worked at all, often times you'd have to wait hours for it to even get a signal on a clear sunny day from the sattelites which was necessary to even function. It's cool though, I mean it's not like our troops lives literally depended on this stuff or anything."

tech,2zzxew,tuseroni,3,Mon Mar 23 16:42:01 2015 UTC,"this is a common question, it's tricky because we can't know what we don't know, we could comb the military records completely declassifying everything and people will say ""what about the records that were destroyed"" if you say none were destroyed they would come back with ""how do YOU know"" and you don't, you can say there is no reference to documents which do not exist so we can infer none were destroyed but there will always be that ""but how do YOU KNOW"" area.  i think by and large the difference between government tech and what is available to the public is just funding. i could make a giant rail gun or hugely powerful laser if i had 100 billion dollar budget. the difference between military tech and private sector tech tends to be that the private sector hasn't found a way to make it cheap and the military doesn't care if it's cheap. so google could make a super powerful laser that blocks explosives like this, but it wouldn't sell well, it would be incredibly expensive to make and operate and be quite difficult to maintain and use. perfect for the military, useless in the market."

Sometimes ultrasonic frequencies can be used to levitate objects, thus creating no sound heard by the human ear, such as was demonstrated at Otsuka Lab,  while others use audible frequencies. There are various ways of emitting the sound wave, from creating a wave underneath the object and reflecting it back to its source, to using a (transparent) tank to create a large acoustic field.  Acoustic levitation is usually used for containerless processing which has become more important of late due to the small size and resistance of microchips and other such things in industry. Containerless processing may also be used for applications requiring very-high-purity materials or chemical reactions too rigorous to happen in a container. This method is harder to control than other methods of containerless processing such as electromagnetic levitation but has the advantage of being able to levitate nonconducting materials.
