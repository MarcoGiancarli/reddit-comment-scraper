FIFA,3e26hh,iloveartichokes,2,Tue Jul 21 15:40:35 2015 UTC,"Except they are totally not as cheap as Real, nor are any other 5 star team.

FIFA,3e26hh,JimElectric,26,Tue Jul 21 16:30:59 2015 UTC,So EA can keep track of big data like this and produce stunning visuals but cannot introduce more advanced stats tracking in FUT? There's SO much more EA could do to make FUT even better but I guess advanced stat tracking doesn't make money like special IF cards do.
FIFA,3e26hh,GeneralGBO,4,Tue Jul 21 13:22:31 2015 UTC,and they also can't fix coin glitchers despite having all of this data.
FIFA,3e26hh,sois,17,Tue Jul 21 14:45:43 2015 UTC,Data collection and fixing server manipulation are two completely different things.
FIFA,3e26hh,DRNSovrBK,3,Tue Jul 21 15:33:45 2015 UTC,"If you have this level of detail on individual players, you have the ability to measure coins earned power game.

FIFA,3e26hh,sois,2,Tue Jul 21 15:55:13 2015 UTC,"""This level of detail on individual players"" the only detail they have is goals scored and times traded. Pretty easy data collection.  Not to mention your idea is a novel one, but it's not practical. It would lead to unintentional bans to real players (and even if you make the coin per hours extremely high, you might not get unintentional bans, but you will only get the most ambitious coin farmers.)  Not to mention, you ban the users, all that's going to happen is there will be thousands of new accounts within hours. And that will only happen until the coin farmers find out what the limit is, so they can stay just under that number. Like I said novel idea, and it might slow down coin selling a little bit, but this is a difficult problem to solve."

FIFA,3e26hh,lRushdown,2,Tue Jul 21 13:19:41 2015 UTC,"I think they attempt to match you up with different teams first before going to a same team match up. I know I very rarely play Bayern when I use them, and I doubt that's because of the lack of people using them."
FIFA,3e26hh,DRNSovrBK,0,Tue Jul 21 15:35:53 2015 UTC,That matches played graph is clearly the wrong shape... Victories graph is probably the wrong shape as well. And what use is it to show me a picture of a ball that represents 25 million goals scored? That doesn't really make it easier to picture or even make it easy to compare to the amount of shots taken next to it because they use different icons.  Is it just me or is it bad to have a club like Real as a partner? Surely there will be bias towards them in the game and it will set a bad precedent.  /rant

I don't know exactly how many people played in each of these months but we can assume that more people were playing 1 month after release than 8 months or so later.

FIFA,3e2t6a,Paraleipsis_FIFA,5,Tue Jul 21 17:21:33 2015 UTC,Japes would get destroyed by any of the top level UT players. Even Castro beat him by like 4 or 5.
FIFA,3e2t6a,igetlotsofupvotes,3,Tue Jul 21 15:22:27 2015 UTC,"I dunno about that, he got beat by Castro like 5-1 but it was on his YT account when Castro had his main team.  I think it would be a different game if Japes was on his main since there's a huge difference in the quality of players.  I agree he would probably get beat by Jukez or the other top top tier players though."
FIFA,3e2t6a,TheMCM80,2,Tue Jul 21 15:25:38 2015 UTC,"It's hard to say because Japes never seems to be in full ""try hard"" mode. He's always trying to score with chips or make cheeky skill runs, etc. If he played straight up I doubt he would get destroyed very often"
FIFA,3e2t6a,edlyncher,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:38:07 2015 UTC,"That doesn't mean he can flick a switch and ""try harder"" to compete versus top players. I'm not saying he would get destroyed but would never win a series."

FIFA,3e2t6a,Get_Piccolo,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:39:27 2015 UTC,What? Dude has 1000 wins to 100 losses and he'd get destroyed? Doubt it
FIFA,3e2t6a,dinodoe,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:06:22 2015 UTC,"He's pretty good don't get me wrong but he concedes more goals and scores less playing against average opponents than the top players do against division one players.   Put him against someone like wisel, outragx, hugegorilla, smileydragon, hans, kurt, marlut etc and you'll see a repeat of the Castro scoreline easily.   On 14 he played Notorious and didn't score a single goal in like 5 games against him."
FIFA,3e2t6a,iloveartichokes,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:26:40 2015 UTC,"As strange as it is, divisions records often don't correlate to the top, top players when in tournaments such as gfinity.   For example, the recent winner of gfinity was mentioned to have had 700 wins to 100 losses. Many non competitors have records superior to this."
FIFA,3e2t6a,apaperfork,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:32:23 2015 UTC,A lot of competitive players will quit out of games for rain/lag or if they have another game to play etc so their records are kinda skewed somewhat. But I agree with your point.  The last gfinity was a joke though as lot of the best players were banned.

FIFA,3e2x8q,cpatty,5,Tue Jul 21 15:44:01 2015 UTC,"Not worth it if you are looking to make the best team possible, but I have used quite a few legends and they were a lot of fun to use.  For the most part you could get comparable players for a lower price, but I would recommend trying out a couple as they are fun to play with and also seem to have a sort of ""legend effect"" which makes them better than their stats might say."
FIFA,3e2x8q,jamiew22,5,Tue Jul 21 16:14:21 2015 UTC,I'd make a hybrid with legends and other good non-legend players.  This is what I'm using right now and it's ridiculous:   http://www.futhead.com/15/squads/36244999/
FIFA,3e2x8q,Jp1496,2,Tue Jul 21 16:58:40 2015 UTC,"It really depends on your budget. I have made two all legend teams(minus LB/RB) this year, and they were tons of fun. Were they the best teams I have used? Maybe, maybe not. It is hard to quantify things over time like that.

FIFA,3e2et2,Siggy778,6,Tue Jul 21 12:57:26 2015 UTC,Best thing is when they are running to the corner and shield the ball.
FIFA,3e2et2,Refri,4,Tue Jul 21 13:39:37 2015 UTC,"sometimes I rush shots/possessions because I think I'm running out of time   If you've made it into the attacking third and have possession, no need to rush, the whistle generally won't blow until that possession is over, so take your time to build up a quality chance. I've seen a few weird stoppages before, but I think these are mostly just when the CPU mistakenly thinks that possession was lost (even momentarily or after a shot) rather than the ref just deciding to blow the whistle. There's basically never a need to rush unless you are in your own half."
FIFA,3e2et2,kohanz,3,Tue Jul 21 13:44:31 2015 UTC,"There's also those times when you're 1-0 up deeeeep into stoppage time, in their half, and you think ""might as well just go for goal because the ref will blow it any second now"". You shoot, miss wide, they take the goalkick, head it on, LB+Y, and all of a sudden score an equalizer way beyond the amount of time you thought was possible"
FIFA,3e2et2,IsleofManc,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:12:13 2015 UTC,"This is true. If it's really that late, I almost think playing the ball out of bounds (preferably a throw in or a goal kick) is preferable. The game is really just counting possession-changes at this point and so you give your opponent one last possession, knowing that it is likely their last of the game. It is much easier defending to not give up a scoring chance from a throw-in or goal kick (with all your defenders back in position and the bus parked) than it is from a turnover in open play."
FIFA,3e2et2,kohanz,3,Tue Jul 21 14:47:45 2015 UTC,"100% agree on the ""winning"" but actually drawing and wasting time"
FIFA,3e2et2,labtecy,2,Tue Jul 21 13:40:20 2015 UTC,"Well it kind of is a secret in real life.  The ref doesn't constantly shout to the players a countdown and he can end the game earlier or later than the exact time given.  It's an issue with keep away but I think it helps in the long run.  I learned how to play world class by learning to defend it first.  Minimizing chances for the other team to score and considering a tie a type of win.  After you learn how to defend you learn how to possess vs. them. After learning to possess you start to learn how you can attack and when you can attack.  I only started playing world class because of the tournament packs in FUT and only won because of shootouts most of the time.  Now I'm easily beating Barca and Real by multiple goals because I've learned how to defend and maximize my chances.    Don't get frustrated, just learn from your games."
FIFA,3e2et2,phoenixcolt,2,Tue Jul 21 13:35:59 2015 UTC,Extra time is legit...players can always see the running clock anywhere on the field but once it hits 90 they just see the 90.   Only the ref and people watching on tv know the running clock.
FIFA,3e2et2,trafficguy2015,2,Tue Jul 21 18:02:37 2015 UTC,I wondered that. I still think the way it's calculated in this game is horribly inaccurate.

FIFA,3e2et2,TommyD99,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:44:48 2015 UTC,"AI mentality is terrible either way.   The best example being the ridiculous ""hoof it forward"" all out attack thing they do when they're a goal down.   I scored early in ET against Barcelona, and they proceeded to go all out attack and cross it in, with only one defender back (funnily enough, it's always Pique, their only aerial threat)"
FIFA,3e35eh,pmod90,6,Tue Jul 21 16:28:38 2015 UTC,"I've tried it both ways and still prefer having left footers at RW and right footers at LW. I found the outside of the boot far post shots were harder to pull off consistently -- sometimes the player would just attempt to shoot with his weak foot and just completely biff it wide.   If you're cutting in from the wing, I think this set up is better for near post shots, too -- a left foot coming in from the LW is going to be at an awkward angle trying to finesse it near post with his strong foot. I guess it depends on which angle you're approaching from.   Honestly I think either setup is fine -- just depends on what you find you're better with."
FIFA,3e35eh,04andrew22,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:37:41 2015 UTC,If ur right footer is at RW then why does he need to pull off an outside of the foot shot when he can do a simple across the body shot with his right foot?
FIFA,3e35eh,Jamez10000,2,Tue Jul 21 18:14:30 2015 UTC,"Because generally speaking wingers are so far out that players cut inside with them, which consists of running somewhere up to 90 degrees to the goal line. Think of the way Arjen Robben plays for example. Once they're at that angle it's always going to be their left foot for a RW and vice versa for LW.   The way you're thinking of it involves them coming more directly towards the goal like a striker. It really just depends on how you play. I think most players like to cut inside hard with their wingers though, which is why most play reverse footed. I naturally find my players are more often on their reverse foot just because of how I dribble inside so much."
FIFA,3e35eh,04andrew22,2,Tue Jul 21 19:15:32 2015 UTC,Exactly this -- definitely depends on how you use them and what angle you're approaching the goal from!
FIFA,3e35eh,04andrew22,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:35:51 2015 UTC,"Outside of the foot shots and cross the body shots fall into the same category of basic strong-footed shots, which is really what I meant to say. My point was that they don't always use their strong foot, especially when you're cutting inside. If you press the shoot button at a slightly wrong time they will sometimes take the shot with their weak foot and most of the time it won't end well."
FIFA,3e35eh,apaperfork,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:38:48 2015 UTC,Youre right but I usually take cross-body shots without cutting in which forces them to take the shot on their stronger foot if you know what I mean..

Then I bought RB ronaldo for 15 mill. And with the 3-4 mill I had left I continued trading to buy the rest of my players.

FIFA,3dz022,johncolbert13,7,Mon Jul 20 20:38:14 2015 UTC,"Plus she did fairly well the previous world cup   Umm, she had been absolutely lights out up until her injury. You obviously don't know anything about her other than the fact that she's hot. Her record with the US is phenomenal, scoring 52 in 91 games. That alone would be enough to validate her commercial appeal. And you can look at her club record and see the same thing, 30 goals in 48 games. But then you account for her ability to assist, her crazy speed, and her ability to beat a defender. She's SO good.  She had an alright world cup because she came back from injury recently. But the circlejerk about her being the most overrated player is ridiculously untrue. She was better than Wambach, who has just as many sponsors.  Get out of here with your bullshit, you're like all the other people who don't follow soccer until the world cup.

FIFA,3dz022,moriero,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:56:38 2015 UTC,"Alright, let me clarify a few things for you:   You are correct that I don't know her stats and don't follow her club record, but a quick type into google and everybody can pull those stats out of their arse. I think it is widely known that she is a talented female player, which I never said she wasn't.  Never did I mention her being overrated. Comparing her to Wambach is justifiable in terms of play, but in terms of sponsorship you can't be more wrong. Even if it's the same number, Morgan gets more money. She has large sponsorship deals with nike and Gatorade (Two of the biggest earners in the sporting world).  Don't get butthurt over a simple fact. EA didn't choose her as the cover because she is the phenomenal player she is, but rather chose her because it adds a different demographic to the cover and because with alex morgan on the cover, they can sell a shit ton more copies. Would you rather buy a game with Dempsey  or Bradley on there, or a smoking hot (and also highly talented) Alex Morgan. You have to remember the demographic for fifa is a large majority male, most of whom would prefer an attractive (don't forget talented) female on the cover of the game. EA is also trying to target females into purchasing and playing the game by having (the majority of their) idol on the cover. It's all a marketing ploy, you have to remember that. Who would earn them the most money as the cover. The answer is obviously Alex Morgan because it targets a wide audience.  Stop the banter about me not following soccer until the world cup. You have no idea who I am and what I do. You are right in a sense that I (along with the majority of Americans and the rest of the world), don't follow WOMEN's soccer until the world cup, but that's because I have no interest in following their club teams. Nothing against them, but they aren't nearly as accessible to watch where I am. I am one of those people who follows soccer to the T. An avid supporter of Liverpool and my national team and I watch every single game that I am available to because it is like a second religion to me. Stop with the damn accusations and defensiveness. Face the fact that she is on the cover because, and I will put it in all bold for you just in case you have your head too far up your ass that you can't read it, but SHE IS ON THE COVER BECAUSE IT WILL SELL THE MOST COPIES AND MAKE EA THE MOST MONEY. PART OF IT IS BECAUSE SHE IS A GREAT WOMEN'S PLAYER, BUT THE MAIN REASON IS DUE TO SEX APPEAL. I WOULD IMAGINE YOU WILL LEARN ABOUT THAT IN A YEAR OR SO WHEN YOU FINALLY REACH 6TH GRADE. She is a very talented player, but she is on the cover so EA can make money and she is the best possible reason for men and women around the U.S. to purchase the game.  To dumb it down and put it in perspective for you, Ella Delle Donne lead the WNBA in points per game last season, but you don't see her being on the cover of 2k anytime soon.

FIFA,3dz022,idontwantalargefarva,4,Mon Jul 20 21:06:58 2015 UTC,"alex was injured, same idea as ronaldo in the last world cup"
FIFA,3dz022,iloveartichokes,4,Mon Jul 20 23:52:37 2015 UTC,"And this is a bit cynical, but I doubt EA is trying to market the game to women. They know that probably 90%+ (I have no clue about the actual percentage just estimating) of FIFA players are male, so they're going to pick the soccer player who males across the U.S. love because she's hot. But let's also be honest, she's probably the only consistently recognizable female soccer player besides Solo or Lareaux(probably butchered that one) or Wambach, so EA doesn't really have anything to gain putting someone else on there regardless of how good they actually are."
FIFA,3dz022,connor24_22,2,Mon Jul 20 21:06:20 2015 UTC,I actually do think that EA is trying to market FIFA to women these days. All of my friends' mothers play video games these days. They all started with Wii Fit for exercise (we live in an area that is basically Hoth for 8 months out of the year) and now they are starting to move onto other games. A lot more little girls play video games these days too.
FIFA,3dz022,Saskia_C,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:15:51 2015 UTC,"Good point, most girls that play video games are either moms playing super casually like you said, or ""gamer girls"" that play the FPS' or big RPGs (I know that's a HUGE stereotype but just what I've come across most in my experience playing, not trying to be inconsiderate). EA could be trying to take some people from both of those groups and I'd imagine it'd be relatively easy. Hell, I had no clue about soccer a few years ago, but Ea got me hooked on the sport and the game with Ultimate Team."
FIFA,3dz022,connor24_22,6,Tue Jul 21 04:13:08 2015 UTC,I mean she has like 30 assists and 52 goals in 91 caps. That's really really good! You're not gonna find much better stats than that.

The U.S. doesn't really have a best player, it's really between whether Morgan, Rapinoe, Lloyd, or Holiday shows up."

FIFA,3dz022,Michael_Scotts_Tots,15,Mon Jul 20 18:46:25 2015 UTC,It's a sad ploy for attention? Because they put a woman on the cover? It's sad? HOW does that make ANY sense in the least bit? At all?
FIFA,3dz022,TropicalAmerican,5,Mon Jul 20 19:10:22 2015 UTC,"I mean that, OUR demographic in the USA does probably not coincide with this. One of the biggest 'rules' of advertising/marketing its to play to your target market. I will not stand here and say we (USA NT fans) don't love our women's team and as /u/CrazyLanguageEnglish pointed out the final garnered more numbers here than most major sporting events. BUT (big but here), the addition of Women's teams in 16 has not made the fan base more excited. We are looking for MANY other improvements. This addition of Alex Morgan IS NOT A BAD THING, it just seems like FIFA is trying to shove this addition down our throats.   How many threads in this sub have expressed discontent for the lack of expanding features/improvements? If those at EA were actively listening to their fan base, and especially here were there are a lot of different users with various expectations of this game, then they would know that most of us don't REALLY care about the addition of Women. AGAIN, this isn't a bad thing, but just seems forced and in MY eyes sad (read: my opinion, take it or leave it)."
FIFA,3dz022,Michael_Scotts_Tots,10,Mon Jul 20 19:46:28 2015 UTC,"They're not attempting to appeal to the current fanbase with this decision, though. There's only so much growth you can have with the same demographic. By putting a female on the cover you're advertising to an untapped market. This is an experiment, which means that if it fails they'll probably try again (and make it three cover stars - USMNT & USWNT stars with Messi) or drop it altogether. I don't see the harm in trying to expand the fanbase into something much broader, which is what they're trying to do. They're trying to appeal to girls and women who have the interest in women's soccer, but have no idea that the ability to play as them in a game is an actual option. It'd be a poor decision to add a new feature that could potentially attract a lot of new consumers and then not advertise it on the cover."
FIFA,3dz022,gfygfygfy,8,Mon Jul 20 20:46:18 2015 UTC,"I mean, the alternative is continuously keeping women's soccer from getting anywhere near similar publicity. I'd rather have pandering if it's still a step in the right direction."

FIFA,3dz022,DrYaguar,0,Mon Jul 20 20:47:07 2015 UTC,Dempsey has already been on a cover. To call it sad seems harsh. It's more original.
FIFA,3dz022,Austyx,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:39:54 2015 UTC,"Because they already have a massive base of male players. Putting a female on the cover is the easiest way to advertise the new feature for people who don't follow gaming news. Soccer is extremely popular sport for young kids to play, female and male. Now say you are a parent with your daughter looking for a game. Previous FIFA's may not be that attractive to you but seeing a female on the cover showing how the game is inclusive to your daughter following her dream may encourage you to get the game especially if Morgan is their favorite player.  People will assume the male team will be in the game without a player on the cover, unless they follow gaming news they will assume women are not."

I don't know the numbers off the top of my head but there's no way in hell USA x Japan drew 7 million more people than Argentina x Germany. Maybe 7 million more americans watched the women's final than the men's. But definitely not 7 million total people more. That's ludicrous to even think that.

FIFA,3dz022,GeekYogurt,3,Mon Jul 20 22:34:19 2015 UTC,"While it's progressive to put a woman on the cover, it shoulda been Lloyd along with Bradley or Dempsey. Let's be real, the only reason Alex Morgan is on the cover is because of the World Cup. The inclusion of women is insignificant; nobody is buying the game to play with the women in kickoff. That being said, if EA is gonna pander then at least do it the right way. Carli Lloyd just had a beast of a tournament and carried the USA to the title. But na, gotta put the pretty girl on the cover."
FIFA,3dz022,WolfFangFist93,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:03:18 2015 UTC,Most likely the contract with Morgan was finalized waaaay before the world cup happened. And do fifa covers ever have more than two players on them? I honestly dont know. But messi is on contract to be on ever cover for a few years so they cant replace him
FIFA,3dz022,Coban3,2,Tue Jul 21 02:20:01 2015 UTC,Its fine if they put a woman on the cover but at least put Dempsey or Bradley or another US mens player on there with them or it just looks like a huge publicity stunt.

If they let you play with a women's team vs men's teams, to be realistic the women would all have overall ratings of like 20-30.  Will they only let you play women vs women so they can rank the women on a different scale and give good players/teams ratings in the 80s?

FIFA,3e2x84,spectacledsloth,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:20:11 2015 UTC,"Buy 750 coin bronze packs. You should get a squad fitness once every 3-4 packs. Putting player cards at 250 BIN recovers cost of the pack and small profit since you get 3-4 players in a pack. The healing cards that you get are free bonuses. The contracts and non-rare fitness cards are minor bonuses. I am assuming you have all the coaches already.  IMO, this is more economical than building a 20-30k competitive fitness squad."

FIFA,3e24bb,joshd24,4,Tue Jul 21 11:20:44 2015 UTC,"Div 1 Seasons with Chelsea today - I think I've burst a vessel.  Three times today I've gunned for the title, three times left 1-2 points short. On a 4 or 5 game win streak each time, next thing you know my team can't string 3 passes together. From playing fluid and dominant footy all the way through, to playing like the team are treading through quicksand. Anything that could go wrong goes wrong.      Fifa makes you think you're in the game, but really you're not, no matter how hard you try. Within the first 20 mins, you know whether you're in the game or not. The amount of BS thrown at me is outrageous. The goals scored require no skill whatsoever, it's just Fifa will open the window of opportunity to get on goal, and 9/10 it's a sure goal, usually a lobbed through-ball to Bale/Ronaldo/Messi/Neymar/Suarez to run and round a keeper. No real passing aspect or real gameplay at all to this game.     There's no fucking error when playing with RM/Barca. DOesn't matter what you do, the game will favour you. Winning every 50-50, getting to balls first, Ramos/ Varane able to snuff out chances they have no business getting. Messi/Pedro/Xavi able to outmuscle Costa for the ball and again, off for a run. It's just like when I see Xavi or Iniesta winning balls over Terry/Ivan/Matic.      This game is no longer about skill, it's about what FIFA decides to give you, thus deciding the winner. Surely there is some form of scripting when you get to the heights of the Div 1 table...     Last game: *Goal kick coming straight back at me resulting in a 1-on-1 goal within 10 mins - that's a Fifa favourite.  *Any through ball ends up at Bale/Ronaldo's feet on the break, after the obligatory pinball in midfield. Again, no build-up, just hail mary.  *In a sequence of play I will tackle the ball 4 or 5 times only for it to keep pinging onto opposition players on the run.  *Timing of my AI runs goes to custard.  *Keeper loses the plot and forgets how to use his fucking hands and watches the ball roll past him?  *Ref decides to join in as a RM body barrier for my runners.  *Every tackle made on my players is perfect as the ball will magically stay at their feet ready to break on me (yet my tackles result in it pinging to an opposing player, or directly out for touch)  *But soon I equalise with Remy after a high-tempo, 20-something passing sequence through the mid, shimmying past players, countless back-heels, and Fabregas slips a peach of an assist for the goal.  *Next half, something much the same again after a good 30-second camp round their 10 yard box and Hazard back-heels Costa in for the goal.  *2-1 up, 8 mins on the clock, chuck up a goal kick towards Remy, contesting with Modric of all people, and Modric not only wins the header but knocks one upfield to Benzemas feet to find  Bale on full stride and scores.... Modric can't fucking jump, head, nor does he have any heading acc, while Remy is rated late 80s/early 90s in all these skill aspects respectively...  *2-2 90th minute OT, push forward for the winner, yet one 50-50 tackle and it's his within milliseconds, bounces back off my player back to him again and hits a 38 yard volleyed screamer to take the fucking game.    Once again, undone by two fuck all goals. RInse/repeat.   In saying this, I'll be back on the fucking xbox tomorrow playing the same old shit."
FIFA,3e24bb,veryoriginaleh,3,Tue Jul 21 17:11:05 2015 UTC,"I'm fucking done.

Won the Champions Chield easily the 1st time, 2nd time I get to the final, and guess what?   3/4 goals I conceded are headers to Reus, Muller & Hummels. And in my corners it's my fullbacks (Clichy & Walker), Aguero & Di Maria in the box while every big, black, tall & strong player (Okore, Kompany, Yaya, Kouyate, Sissoko, Bolasie) is not in the fucking box. Every corner is to the shortest player on the pitch. Oh, I try to fix that by moving a big, black, tall & strong player to the box, but he just backs off to back where he was. Asking for a cross while controlling that player results in a shitty cross which is cut by the first men in front of it. And in his corners it's always Di Maria or Walker defending against Hummels. Oh, try to fix that by controlling a big, black, strong & tall player manually? Let's switch the player at the last second (auto-switching is off). FUCKING DONE.  ok.. changed the squad around a bit (Cameron RB, Enrique LB, IF Smalling LCB, Arnautovic LM & Lukaku ST). I sub on Fekir & Aguero in extra time. I take a corner with Aguero, so the Fekir is the only guy who is below 6'0"". Guess who the corner is aimed to? FUCKING FEKIR. FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCK. WHY EVEN BOTHER. FUUCK FUCK FUCK.

FIFA,3e1mm8,Bumblefuckery,3,Tue Jul 21 06:58:45 2015 UTC,I am terrible at FIFA but TOTS Muller at ST is averaging more than a goal per game for me.  He wins back almost every ball that I lose by poor dribbling and he makes every shot in which he has a decent look.  He's a total monster for me.  Way better than TOTY Robben.
FIFA,3e1mm8,Duster72x,3,Tue Jul 21 14:01:32 2015 UTC,Anyone know a good formation if you're trying to fit in like 16 starters

FIFA,3e1mm8,whataruckusitis,4,Tue Jul 21 07:18:20 2015 UTC,"True, but his workrates, physicality, and pace make him one of the best mids in the game.  I suppose that's true, but I was under the impression his SIF is extinct.  Also, I've used both, and it is a huge upgrade"

FIFA,3e1mm8,Refri,-6,Tue Jul 21 15:51:07 2015 UTC,"Alot of people are hesitant to drop 300k on a midfielder I guess. IMO Muller is one of the best CDMs in the game and I'm glad I have mine but eh, some people would rather a more exciting player for their 300k I suppose"

FIFA,3e1mm8,Pemoniz,4,Tue Jul 21 08:11:14 2015 UTC,"I used his SIF as CAM but also as Striker. He is great as ST but slightly better as CAM, because of his workrates. But as CDM he is kinda wasted. I didnt really liked him as CM so i couldnt imagine him as CDM."
FIFA,3e1mm8,robul,3,Tue Jul 21 08:20:16 2015 UTC,"It depends on how you play. If you play attacking or ultraattacking he's always in the right spot, despite his workrates. Believe me, I've used all his central cards extensively at ST and had no issue with him being out of position for counters."

As for the skills, I always tend to do more body feints than berbaspins and heel-chopping the ball wasn't of much use in the positions my Müller received the ball.  Müller is worth every coin for his no-bullshit finishing and versatility. It can finish —of course, hold up play, cross it if he finds himself on the wing, or dish it to a winger for a 1v1 with the keeper."

And then their response was basically that I was ""a coin seller"" even though it was my account that I have used for 5 years and bought many FIFA points on. They told me their thorough investigation concluded I was banned correctly.   I emailed them again complaining how ridiculous it was and how I did nothing wrong. They sent me a second email saying they will ignore my future correspondences, as they have completed two investigations.   Pretty bullshit. Bottom line is I doubt they will do anything to unban you.

FIFA,3e0zp1,Kanderin,2,Tue Jul 21 09:31:56 2015 UTC,"Any lawyer type people you know? Try firing off an official sounding email stating the completely obvious response that taking someone's money then banning them from a service for no reason whatsoever is grounds for a lawsuit. They'll unlock your account in seconds rather than risk any sort of legal proceedings no matter how trivial. Maybe even someone around here could help. But BEFORE you do that, check your account for suspicious activity. You may of been hacked and used as a bot for one of the coin sellers.  This is EA remember, you have to threaten their wallet."
FIFA,3e0zp1,TheMCM80,2,Tue Jul 21 11:06:56 2015 UTC,"EA uses their Vancouver head office for FIFA, so for starters there is the basic problem of jurisdiction. Second, and I am guessing you have never looked into the cost of taking a major corporation to court, but it would cost more in legal fees than most people make in their entire lives, unless someone does it pro bono, and even then, taking a case like this to court, and possibly losing, would give pretty clear grounds for them to file a defamation suit in which they would probably look to literally enslave you in debt to them for eternity. Most major corporations have a team of very good lawyers. They would look at anything you send to them regarding this, if they even bother to give it to their legal team, and they would laugh it straight to the shredder. There really is no case here. I have only skimmed the TOS, but usually most companies insert liability clauses that give them a basic coverage to deny service for literally anything they deem necessary involving their product unless physical harm was involved. If he wants to waste a few hours fees ,and postage out of anger, contacting a lawyer over this, it would still be cheaper to buy a new gold account. There are no grounds for a lawsuit here. In a civil case, the plaintiff must prove his case by a preponderance of the evidence. That means that he must prove a fact and his damages by showing that something is more likely so than not. EA most likely would have their defense covered well, as they know that having 'possible' false bans could, in theory, open them up to this if someone had the money and really thought it was worth the time and money. Can the plaintiff, the OP, really prove that he has never done what they claim he did? He has not presented any evidence beyond his word, which is not even close to being what is needed."
FIFA,3e0zp1,Kanderin,2,Tue Jul 21 12:07:56 2015 UTC,"I didn't mean actually take them to court, you're quite right in saying that would be stupid. All you have to do is make it sound like its being taken more seriously than it actually is. I dare say EA won't want to risk it, will click that little 'unblock' button they debt possessing, and problem solved.  If you've never threatened legal action despite never even considering it to get what you want from a company, you aren't doing customer service right. It works."
FIFA,3e0zp1,TheMCM80,2,Tue Jul 21 13:47:50 2015 UTC,"Have at it bud, and let us know how it goes. I will give up playing FIFA or the rest of my life if EA get said letter and decide to unblock the account."

FIFA,3e0zp1,RyanCR7,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:36:10 2015 UTC,"Have you tried posting on EA forum and talked to the mods over there?  You can also try contacting Rob.  Mods and people over there may be able to do more for you than EA support or Chuboi because they have more direct access to people who can fix these kinds of problems. For example, people were having problem accessing FUT during BPL TOTS due to people falsely identified as cheaters,  Rob made a post asking people to submit their platform/id. He then submitted the list of names to the technical team and the problem got solved for most people  It may or may not help.... but if it doesn't I guess you've learned your lesson about dealing with EA.  EA is like a posh bar that can be dick to the customer because they can. They don't care if they lose you as a customer because there are tons of other people who are ready to throw their money at them.

FIFA,3e0zp1,skb96,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:48:10 2015 UTC,"Happened to me when I was 12!! Yes, 12 on Fifa 13. I had got a special diction of BF3 and the DLC didn't work so I ended up contacting them over and over again, and they came to the judgement that I was trying to social engineer them for free stuff. They then banned me off Battlefield & FIFA forever on my main account and deleted all my details so it was impossible for my account to be restored. Thankfully I only started playing & I just made another account on my 360 however I had to pay extra money which sucked. I actually ranked up loads on my second account and had a sick team so jokes on them, and I Finally moved to ps4 and started all again. Anyway, if you didn't do anything wrong (I don't believe you did) then you should threaten to file a lawsuit or something (with the help of a lawyer) because they have basically stole money off you. Tl;Dr - happened to me, couldn't get unbanned. Threaten to take legal action with the help of lawyer and see what they do"
FIFA,3e0zp1,KingPretzlcoatl,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:51:04 2015 UTC,"Posts like this piss me off. You're obviously young, so to some extent you can be forgiven, but any lawyer willing to take on a corporation the size of EA will charge you £200 MINIMUM for even sending out a letter threatening the lawsuit. That's without taking into account the case (both yourself and OP have shown no evidence that you DIDN'T do anything wrong, whereas EA will have logs of the reason why you were banned in the first place - FYI i'm not stupid, they can mess up and ban the wrong people, but there's no way to prove that.   Instead of ""threatening a lawsuit"" why don't you save yourself some time and read what will happen below:  Your lawyer: If my client is not unbanned then we will maintain the right to persue legal action  EA lawyer: Sounds of the shredder in the background So, guys, where do you want to go for drinks after work?  Your lawyer after about 3 weeks: Ok, see you in court.  EA Lawyer: Ok bro"

I didn't say take them to court, but mention you have a lawyer (lie) or get a lawyer you know to give you some advice. EA,like any big company, wouldn't want negative PR (although it basically is already) so in threatening to take legal action I'm sure they would rather just unban you. That is presuming he did nothing wrong, of course. Also, nice suits reference"

FIFA,3e0zp1,iloveartichokes,-3,Tue Jul 21 13:18:58 2015 UTC,"Unless you live in Russia, Quebec, Switzerland, or certain EU principalities (jurisdictions in which the subsequent is prohibited), then the following paragraph of §20 in the ToS is applicable to you:  ""By accepting these terms, you and EA expressly waive the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action lawsuit.""  You've already accepted the terms btw. Didn't read it? Doesn't matter. Even if you had one on retainer, a ""video game lawyer"" (lolwut) could not file suit on your behalf. Thus, a threatening letter will ring hollow to EA's legal dept, who have almost certainly actually read the Terms of Service related to their products, unlike your 15-year-old buddies, who are most likely blowing large plumes of smoke up your ass.  This is not to say you are totally hosed. Once you have exhausted informal customer service options AND once thirty days have passed since the ban was initiated, you can file a Notice of Dispute to initiate binding arbitration. You could technically do this without a lawyer. It'll be a hoot. In your letter, include:   Your contact info including physical/mailing address  The pertinent facts surrounding your case Your well-reasoned rebuttal (swearing on one's life is not legally recognized) What you want in compensation (ask for at least one dollar or pound or guinea or shekel or whatever, but fewer than 75,000 of them; this will minimize the arbitration fee schedule.) A statement saying you're poor and need EA to pay for the arbitrator. If you're not poor, ask your dad to pay for the arbitrator, which I'm sure he'll be just thrilled about. an innocuous white powdery substance, perhaps baking soda   Mail all of this to:  Electronic Farts Inc (they'll love that) ATTN: Legal Dept 209 Redwood Shores Pkwy Redwood City CA 94065  Arbitration costs, whether paid by EA or your smarmy rich aunt, will be - in USD - $750 upon filing and $800 once an arbitrator with years of education and experience is appointed to listen to you talk about FIFA. That's a total of $1550. Which btw could buy you around 230,000 FIFA points, or 23 100K packs, in which your best player would probably be Iniesta.    Electronic Arts Inc (herein referred to as ""EA"" or ""Electronic Arts"" or ""Farts"") then has another 30 day period during which they can offer you some kind of settlement, either monetary ($) or injunctive (unban you) or both if the stars align and hell freezes over.  If you decline their offer or they flake and fail to send you one, then you proceed to arbitration. If you're American, jurisdiction will most likely be your county of residence; if you're not American, jurisdiction will remain in San Mateo county, which honestly has better things to do with its life. Either way, the whole shebang will probably be conducted over a conference call or Skype or something similar (seriously, Skype). The dude listens to both sides of the story, hopefully supported by evidence beyond Oaths, then makes a decision. There are no appeals and the decision is final. If you're still banned after all this then you should give up. If the arbitrator rules in your favor and your award is higher than what Farts offered you during their 30-day window, then you will get 1.5x whatever the arbitrator says you get, AND you'll get your arby fees back, which altogether will probably be enough for 24 100k packs, in which your best player will be Kagawa.  For some perspective, Judge Judy and other court shows are actually televised examples of binding arbitration in action (albeit voluntary with the added flavor of a counterclaim option - neither of which is the case here) If nothing else, you can take this little nugget of trivia away from my now long-winded post. Didn't you ever wonder why she never had to campaign for re-election? Or why the courtroom was so well-lit? Or why the bailiff never carried a gun? TRUTHBOMB.  TL;DR - THERE IS NO TL;DR IN THE LAW YOU LAZY DINGUS. Not reading the ToS is probably what got you here in the first place, so print that sucker out, laminate it, and put it in the john. It'll be more productive than perusing this sub on your phone, like you're probably doing right now. After a few gnarly burrito poops you'll be well-versed enough to smell Farts' bullshit from a mile away over the acrid stench of your own. Or you'll recognize that you did something wrong and are now being held responsible for your infraction as directed by the Terms. And that you need to eat more fiber.

FIFA,3dy3z2,Denchenda226,2,Mon Jul 20 15:38:26 2015 UTC,"True. This is quite a bit of a problem, also because literally every Pro is gifted enough to perform an elastico or rabona.   I actually thought about the skill system for a while and came up with the idea to unlock every skill move for a certain amount of ball controll/ dribbling etc..   However this would make everything more complicated so I guess we will have to live in a world without 5* Corona and 4* Neuer. :/"
FIFA,3dy3z2,SecuredRaid,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:43:59 2015 UTC,"It's more about whether they attempt a lot of skills in game and pull them off. That's why players like robben and di Maria have 4* skills, even though most of their skills in real life are 2* moves in fifa."

I play by FifaRalle's Ultimate upgrade rules and im building an all Brazilian skilling squad starting from the shit bronze players and one or two gold you get when you first start FIFA.  So far my two squads and contracts only come from winning games and divisions.  Its pretty fun, although i wish on PS4 that single matches were easier to find for lower ranked teams.  Because they arent im forced to play divisions and playing Div10 with such a shitty team it was hard to win even if the other player sucks when they have some Aubamayeng Reus Robben squad just blasting past your 50 pace CB's.  I have a google spreadsheet i use to keep track of all my points etc, I can throw it up if anyone cares.  This is assuming you've watched FifaRalle on youtube and have some idea of how the Ultimate upgrade rules work."

Anyway, to finish off FIFA 15 I am now also selling up my main account, and my new squad will be made up of the pack pulls I receive only with the profits.

FIFA,3dzdlr,The_JewishMamba,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:47:54 2015 UTC,"The most fun I've had during FIFA15 is making and playing with a squad built around my three originals. It's so fun to slot home with a 75-rated striker (Moreno has 50 goals/32 assists in 72 games) against elite back lines and keepers.  I made a second originals squad with those three just to see if I could get them all to full chem with different players, and I beat a team with Robben, Suarez, and Neymar in the Championship Shield.  I highly recommend making an originals squad to anyone who wants to play with something more than cliched BPL/BuLi/BBVA squads."
FIFA,3dzdlr,MrFunnyWobbl,4,Tue Jul 21 16:22:34 2015 UTC,"Its pretty well established that every squad has a ""cycle"" where they will play like a dream at first but then slowly become more and more retarded. If you're a skiller you'll notice a huge drop off in agility and ball control, your players start to feel like they're running in sand... the dribbling hit I notice after about a season is just undeniable. Those that rely on passing say their passing starts to become erroneous and random, the only fix Iv found for this is switching up players/formations. Then everything is back to running like a dream, for a certain time span. Its a bitch, but its is fifa I guess.  TLDR: OP discovered the ""new squad feel"" theory , those who doubt it, try it for yourself."

FIFA,3dwnjf,DJBJ,2,Mon Jul 20 20:09:13 2015 UTC,"From experience sometimes the game gets very trigger happy about possession.  One of your AI players gets close to the ball and the game switches you to him as if he took possession.  Except he didn't gain possession and since you weren't expecting to get randomly switched to a different player without warning your inputs are rarely even close to correct for the situation.  By the time you can react and fix it it's too late.  Meanwhile the player you had that was about to make a tackle tends to do something stupid, or hesitate, or both so now you have two defenders out of the play."

FIFA,3dwnjf,DJBJ,3,Tue Jul 21 02:12:40 2015 UTC,One of the biggest fuck ups in the game. Or when there is a slight bit of lag throughout a game but pressing L1 doesn't instantly change player so you press it again and then not realise it had changed to who you wanted in the first place so you have to go through a circle of players before going back to the original one.

FIFA,3dzva2,cheevyboy,3,Mon Jul 20 21:41:51 2015 UTC,"Alot. TOTS Best ST in the game in my opinion. Tried him over the last couple of days and he's unreal, best dribbler and finisher hands down. Wasn't that impressed with his 93 but for the price difference, I wouldn't really say 5mill more is worth it. Sold him last night as I don't like spending so much on one player."
FIFA,3dzva2,nzfifplayer,2,Mon Jul 20 21:51:16 2015 UTC,Ye that's what I thought.   No doubt he's better but don't really wanna spend 6.5M on one player.   Thanks for the insight.
FIFA,3dzva2,swollenhubris,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:03:38 2015 UTC,Yeah. He isn't worth it at all. His nif may be only a slight downgrade actually. I think I expected too much from him and forced the ball.
FIFA,3dzva2,HotDoughnutSocks,2,Tue Jul 21 02:14:52 2015 UTC,Not 4 million coins more worth. Save your money and build better around him

FIFA,3e1jp8,Hijjlmnop,2,Tue Jul 21 06:24:31 2015 UTC,Are you looking to score goals with him or are you looking to create chances with him by getting the ball to Bale and Shaarawy?
FIFA,3e1jp8,bananalemonkiwi,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:26:52 2015 UTC,Well i just wanna make full use of his 90 positioning and 90 finishing as best i can!
FIFA,3e1jp8,bananalemonkiwi,2,Tue Jul 21 06:40:40 2015 UTC,"Well I would recommend ""Target Man."" This is going to cause him to stay in front of the defensive back line and enable you to make some nice passes to your pacy wingers. You could also try ""Stay Central"" but I have found that sometimes this can limit the creativeness of the build up play."
FIFA,3e1jp8,Paz_K,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:46:05 2015 UTC,Alright thanks so much! I looked everywhere and i couldnt find anything on how to use him
FIFA,3e1jp8,ladrainian21,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:57:11 2015 UTC,"The 90 positioning and 90 finishing are from his MOTM card, it's an error on Futhead."
FIFA,3e1jp8,Kenarion,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:37:19 2015 UTC,Why does his sevilla card have the same in game stats as his 81 motm with Dortmund
FIFA,3e1jp8,ladrainian21,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:53:30 2015 UTC,Must be a futhead bug
FIFA,3e1jp8,ladrainian21,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:17:20 2015 UTC,Then op needs to temper his expectations of 90 finishing and positioning.  As for instructions I'd use Immobile on stay on the bench while attacking
FIFA,3e03c0,thegaff100,2,Mon Jul 20 22:42:13 2015 UTC,Best as a CDM when I used him
FIFA,3e03c0,NovacElement,3,Mon Jul 20 22:47:50 2015 UTC,I thought of it...but his marking scares me. Its in the red.
FIFA,3e03c0,clbranche,2,Mon Jul 20 22:50:08 2015 UTC,"All you really need in a CDM is decent pace, good physical and good passing. You should be defending with your midfield anyway so marking doesnt matter cuz YOU'RE the one doing the marking"

FIFA,3e03c0,thatfratfuck,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:55:23 2015 UTC,He works great as a CDM in a 4222 or CM in an false 9. I wouldn't play him as a solo DM though.
FIFA,3e03c0,TheMCM80,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:55:39 2015 UTC,"Box to box CM worked well for me. CDM can work well too, as he has M/H work rates, is strong, and is 6'2."
FIFA,3e03c0,gmx25,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:14:15 2015 UTC,He's a FREAK at CM
FIFA,3e03c0,Aramos213,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:31:55 2015 UTC,RCM in a 4-1-2-1-2 (2)
FIFA,3e03c0,blandestk,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:16:50 2015 UTC,"I planned to slot him in at CDM, as my go-to formation is 4-3-3 (3) with two CDMs. But in building my legend squad I didn't have another player with good enough defending to put in the second CDM, so I played him straight up as a CM. I was worried at first playing with no CDMs because I really like to cover with that position, but I'm glad I tried it because Effenberg is AMAZING at CM. He gets back to defend naturally better than any card I have played in the game, even TOTS Matic. He just comes back on his own, intercepts passes, marks runners, does it all. It's phenomenal. But he also gets forward on his own to join the attack too. He is one of the most complete players in the whole game and very undervalued for his price tag. He isn't the flashiest offensive player, but he is competent enough in every aspect to bang in goals for me even when I'm not really looking to score with him.  In short: I'm sure he would be amazing at CDM, but I know for a fact he does it all at CM."
FIFA,3e03c0,hella_strafe,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:38:45 2015 UTC,Brilliant CDM in a 41212 for me
FIFA,3e03c0,l31ackout,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:56:03 2015 UTC,"IMO he needs to be at CM. He can work well at CDM, but it really needs to be in a double CDM formation. He's too clunky for me to play at CAM."
FIFA,3e03c0,domelotta,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:17:15 2015 UTC,best CDM for a Legend/BuLi/German hybrid. By Far
FIFA,3e1hq8,pawneepark,4,Tue Jul 21 06:01:11 2015 UTC,Koscielny - TOTS Terry - Kompany/Onuoha
FIFA,3e1hq8,Daymian,3,Tue Jul 21 06:26:34 2015 UTC,"Never have gotten on with Kompany, idk why.  Koscielny has amazing pace but damn if he isn't the most reckless defender I've ever used. Gets more cards and own goals than all my other CBs combined lol."
FIFA,3e1hq8,Daymian,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:33:31 2015 UTC,"Yeah I agree with you on Kompany, I even prefer Mangala but since so many people love Kompany, I added him. I really recommend TOTS Terry, he's perfect as the middle CB with his strength and amazing defensive stats. His pace isn't that bad either"
FIFA,3e1hq8,bananalemonkiwi,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:13:48 2015 UTC,I think I'll pick him up. I just spent most of my coins on MOTM Sanchez so I gotta wait a while now hahaha
FIFA,3e1hq8,bananalemonkiwi,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:34:58 2015 UTC,Does it have to be BPL or are you open to making it into a hybrid?
FIFA,3e1hq8,bananalemonkiwi,0,Tue Jul 21 06:04:22 2015 UTC,Has to be BPL for the rest of my players to get full chem unfortunately.

FIFA,3e1hq8,rosmac,0,Tue Jul 21 06:14:03 2015 UTC,"http://imgur.com/9ovBd1k  It plays incredibly well. The only problem I find is that my back line feels a bit...dumb, at times."
FIFA,3e1hq8,Refri,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:16:59 2015 UTC,"Yeah for a 3 CB formation this is probably as good as it gets at the back, if you wanted to switch to 4 at the back I could recommend some awesome changes"
FIFA,3e1hq8,Walrusporcipine,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:20:22 2015 UTC,I used to only play with 4ATB but the 3-5-2 with this squad has singlehandedly won me the Div 2 title after struggling for a bit. (Also undefeated for 5 matches in Div 1 so far) idk why but things click for me with this formation
FIFA,3e1hq8,thegaff100,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:42:39 2015 UTC,"TOTS Terry with his DEF stats for sure, take out Onuoha and keep the IF CB. Terry doesn't need pace, Terry drains it away.  In all seriousness i would change the back line to this SIF Williams-TOTS Terry- UPKoscielny, for the sole reason of koscielnys pace and he has better defensive stats than IF smalling. You can compare stats here http://www.futwiz.com/en/compare/chris-smalling/13702/laurent-koscielny/13628  And koscielny has the pace to keep up. And for a 3ATB formation you need you defensive line to have M/H workrates."
FIFA,3e1hq8,Walrusporcipine,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:26:55 2015 UTC,I think that's the back line I'm gonna go with. Now to save up for TOTS Terry bc I spent all my coins on SIF Sanchez yesterday hahaha
FIFA,3e1hq8,WakaFlockaGeese,2,Tue Jul 21 18:56:50 2015 UTC,Matic on 7 Chem is 2nd best cb behind kompany

You could do this. http://www.futhead.com/15/squads/36999163/ But this wouldnt be optimal either. But you could also think about putting for example Walker as CB."
FIFA,3e1hq8,ChampionOfGaming,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:36:11 2015 UTC,Walker is my super sub at CB if I'm struggling with the opponents pace. He just shuts everyone down. Filipe Luis does this as well.

FIFA,3dy7gs,TheMCM80,4,Mon Jul 20 14:50:50 2015 UTC,Switch Rooney and Wilshere maybe?
FIFA,3dy7gs,rainyforest,2,Mon Jul 20 17:31:19 2015 UTC,"I used to use them like that, but wilshire works much better for me there, and rooney's h/h and huge physical advantage are more effective for me a little deeper."
FIFA,3dy7gs,TheMCM80,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:15:29 2015 UTC,Shouldn't Rooney and Wilshere be switched around?
FIFA,3dy7gs,desous,2,Mon Jul 20 17:42:24 2015 UTC,"You would think so, but Rooney's physical presence is huge for me a little deeper in the midfield. Wilshire has slightly better dribbling and passing, which tipped it for me. Also, I like my cam to be my first line of defense, so wilshire's defensive stats are better for me there. I find that the best way to take the ball from good dribblers is to physically move them off of it which rooney does. Rooney's H/H work rates mean he gets involved plenty, and Wilshire's M/M are, imo, better suited to someone who I am not depending on to track back as far. i have used rooney at cam in the past, and he was good, don't get me wrong, but Wilshire feels more elusive, which i like in my cams."
FIFA,3dy7gs,TheMCM80,7,Mon Jul 20 20:14:36 2015 UTC,http://www.futhead.com/15/squads/36953857/  It doesn't look too special but it wins me a ton of games and Soriano is a beast when you play with him. Don't be scared about his 75 pace
FIFA,3dy7gs,Joltedd,2,Mon Jul 20 15:03:20 2015 UTC,I played him at 442 with a all spain squad... didnt click with me :(

FIFA,3dy7gs,adamdabadboy,4,Mon Jul 20 15:02:58 2015 UTC,do you match against silver squads or the same as if you had a high rated gold TOTS team?
FIFA,3dy7gs,HandJobSwag,4,Mon Jul 20 16:29:11 2015 UTC,"I match up against gold teams, I play in the champions shield so that's probably why."
FIFA,3dy7gs,adamdabadboy,3,Mon Jul 20 16:54:50 2015 UTC,i was hoping you'd match with silver teams. Back in older games that was a reality and silver teams were fun.
FIFA,3dy7gs,HandJobSwag,2,Mon Jul 20 17:00:28 2015 UTC,"It's not a problem though, for some reason the opponents I come up against are not as good as the normal opponents I face. I think they add your squad rating to your skill level and match it with someone else's. So if they have a gold squad, their skill level will be lower than yours. This is my theory."

FIFA,3dy7gs,that603guy,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:18:00 2015 UTC,"Toulalan is incredible, but only in a 2 CDM formation. I would never use him alone as his pace becomes an issue. But teamed up with another he's consistantly MOTM for me. 99 Standing Tackles and Interceptions goes a long way, and I rarely see him out of position.  Overall on 4222 I didn't care for it earlier in the year, but have slowly fallen in love with the 2 CDM formation. I also use the 2 CAMs in a ""Stay Forward"" Instruction so they act almost like wingers. It also lets me use slower strikers like Ibra to hold up play, and just be a big dick in the middle, which he excels at."

Jovetic is like having a second attacking mid. It started off as an untradeable team, which still shows in the back line.

FIFA,3e0o77,thegaff100,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:10:18 2015 UTC,"It really depends on your budget. If you have extra coins to throw around then yes they are really good. But could you get a pair that is slightly less effective for less? Yes. Legends always play well, and I attribute a lot of that to their traits/specialties as well as their stats. these two work so well because not only do they both have good pace, but Blanc is a mobile more tactical defender with good passing, and Desailly is the stronger more brutish one. Des is 6ft, Blanc is 6'2, so they really are just all around pure bred defense partners."

I am guessing the market will be dead after Futties, but will recover a little bit during MLS TOTS.

My thoughts - sounded like you had an unlucky game with shooting. I'll say first hand I usually don't have these games happen, but had one with the exact score (3-1) and similar shot totals. Bottom line was that I should have scored but just kept missing by inches...shit happens.

FIFA,3e0ud8,lilstubbs_,2,Tue Jul 21 02:19:33 2015 UTC,Depends on your style of play. Do you go round the outside or cut in the middle? However you play you want to end up with your striker shooting on his best foot. Work it out that way.

FIFA,3e0ud8,TommyD99,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:45:28 2015 UTC,I'd go right on right and left on left. Outside of the foot shots are way more OP inside the box then finesse shots are IMO.   The only exception are near post finesse shots are OP compared to their far post brethren

If you don't have a quick CDM you will get punished on counters through the middle if you give the ball away.

FIFA,3e0o4e,Turnernator_,3,Tue Jul 21 01:29:44 2015 UTC,"It's mainly about the captain knowing when to use team mate contain, and when they're over using it.  Don't assume your players can make tackles, use the R1 (PS4) button to basically hurl your players at the last second in front of them opponents, not to actually close down, because they'll fail miserably.  That's probably my biggest tip. Also, use the computer for passes. So many teams I play against will only pass to other humans, which is stupid. Final thing, make sure people are calling the ball at the right times, not when they're in a swarm of the other team, or an impossible long ball."
FIFA,3e0o4e,Limeguy,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:03:21 2015 UTC,I do usually utilize R1. It works pretty decent for me.  I'll try and use the computer to help dump off passes and what not.   Thanks for the advice!

FIFA,3e0o4e,boris-for-PM-2019,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:17:58 2015 UTC,"If you are playing without an any make sure you change your settings to ""Match Any"" otherwise you will be playing against people who have an any and they will destroy you because it's easy to just pass around the AI players. Also make sure you guys don't constantly spam the pass button because it fucks up the AI players as they don't know when to or how to pass so if you want the ball from them drop short and call for it as opposed to making them boot it over the top.   Personally me and my friends play with an ANY because it's better and we've won division one and all the cups."

FIFA,3dzver,penguincore,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:16:32 2015 UTC,Honestly I think I just played poorly. Ronaldo is great so I kept him and sold off everything else. Suarez wasn't atrocious but there was no reason to spend 6.8 mil on him when he his reg card for 150k felt the same.

Since you build squads I like/use players I like I was wondering if you had time if you could offer advice on my squad I might build (i know you cant use legends on PS I just mean in general). I definitely want to use roberto carlos pink quaresma and ronaldo but the rest im unsure about.  http://www.futhead.com/15/squads/36978571
FIFA,3dzver,penguincore,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:12:10 2015 UTC,http://futhead.com/15/squads/36989650/  This is something I would go with. I like having chemistry as high as possible. However I would totally understand if you don't like Kroos.
FIFA,3dzver,KonyInTheHouse,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:44:12 2015 UTC,I really liked Kroos's TOTY card but with the coins I'll have after buying everyone I would probably prefer to take the slight chem hit and use NIF james over NIF kroos. I usually dont mind as long as everyone gets on at least 7 after loyalty/manger and I try to hit 100 team chem overall. Thanks for making that squad for me though

FIFA,3dzqr0,860256,5,Mon Jul 20 21:09:24 2015 UTC,"I try a couple different methods.   Long shots. You will most likely outnumber them in midfield so it's not hard to pass around and find some space for a long shot.  Crossing. The middle is usually a clusterfuck so it's hard to penetrate. This is why I like having big strikers (Ibra). Go for Hail Mary crosses if all else fails.  Possession and patience. You will outnumber them in midfield and should dominate. Pass it around, be patient, wait for an opening. The idea is to frustrate them into making mistakes and losing their defensive shape.    I usually play defensive or ultra defensive because all they will do is counter with their pace strikers.  If you have the lead, don't be afraid to pass the ball around for the sake of keeping possession.   If they have the lead, may god have mercy on you."

FIFA,3e0ei0,geocastaneda,2,Tue Jul 21 18:04:07 2015 UTC,I never said there is nothing wrong. I just said here are some answers that some people have already throw out. The other threads have tons of answers and if the OP is curious for answers to his questions then he can find more there.
FIFA,3e0ei0,theblackswanson,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:06:01 2015 UTC,"Fair enough, looking back you're right. I get defensive because I see a lot of people post ""search bar"" condescendingly without putting an effort to answer the question."
FIFA,3e0ei0,NovacElement,-4,Tue Jul 21 18:13:22 2015 UTC,Mine would be Messi and Ronaldo at 90
FIFA,3e0ei0,GoodLuckDuck101,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:11:43 2015 UTC,"Messi being downgraded for what? He was essential for his team winning a treble and got to the Copa Final. I guess this is a bold predictions thread however, and the only way I can see your prediction becoming true is if EA want more room for special cards"
FIFA,3e0ei0,toononto,6,Tue Jul 21 00:14:10 2015 UTC,"More like a rework of ratings; more room for in forms, motm etc."
FIFA,3e0ei0,GoodLuckDuck101,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:20:39 2015 UTC,"They have already announced Barca and Real Madrid's ratings:  Barcelona: Bravo (84), Alves (83), Pique (87), Mascherano (83), Alba (82), Rakitic (83), Busquets (86), Iniesta (90), Messi (94), Suarez (89), Neymar (88), Xavi (87), Ter Stegen (82).

FIFA,3e0eeq,GeneralGBO,2,Tue Jul 21 00:10:10 2015 UTC,"Shelton and Poku weren't signed til months after the game came out and weren't previously affiliated with a team in FUT before signing, so both of them won't have cards til fifa 16"
FIFA,3e0eeq,chasing-safety,0,Tue Jul 21 04:00:35 2015 UTC,Cuz EA
FIFA,3e0eeq,clbranche,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:45:32 2015 UTC,Isn't this his rookie year? He's kinda having a break out season. I don't think EA really though he'd do this well.
FIFA,3e0eeq,l2ighty,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:00:16 2015 UTC,"He's on H2H, so it's not that, as EA only recently added NYCFC players to FUT this month. I just don't understand why they wouldn't add one of their most exciting young players. Even got a U-20 call up for some friendlies before the WC."
FIFA,3e0eeq,l2ighty,2,Tue Jul 21 03:34:08 2015 UTC,"Nonononono, those jabronis are already in the game, registered at different teams. EA will add players into H2H but will never make cards for players on FUT."
FIFA,3dx2xf,Mackavelly,1 point,Mon Jul 20 06:36:36 2015 UTC,Thanks for sharing!
FIFA,3dx2xf,r0bski2,1 point,Mon Jul 20 07:27:32 2015 UTC,Cheers. I see this lot in seasons and single matches
FIFA,3dx2xf,TooMuchBanterPerDay,0,Mon Jul 20 10:27:04 2015 UTC,this is related to the PS/PSN network. The game works fine on xbox.
FIFA,3e0bjg,ADustedEwok,2,Mon Jul 20 23:46:32 2015 UTC,Got dropped from the next match because of it.
FIFA,3e0bjg,italianwog28,3,Mon Jul 20 23:47:24 2015 UTC,Stay in your position instead of wandering around the field...
FIFA,3e0bjg,anthonyterms,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:15:47 2015 UTC,I play perfect all game. Even if I did wander away scoring 5 goals isn't a 3.7 rating. I was at 9.0 before the game ended then when it was over I saw my form was bad and saw this shit. I then didn't play the next 5 matches.
FIFA,3e0bjg,IrishAggression,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:30:03 2015 UTC,Same happens in pro clubs. I'll have a 9.0 in the 80th minute and by the 90th I'm down to a 6.5. For no reason.
FIFA,3dyxt0,GamerAsh,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:45:40 2015 UTC,I see so many clips like this but I have never had anything like this happen to me or seen it in a game.
FIFA,3dyxt0,whtge8,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:32:40 2015 UTC,I know what you mean. I've had the odd keeper mess up but this is the first time I was actually shocked ha.
FIFA,3dyxt0,geocastaneda,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:16:47 2015 UTC,wow....
FIFA,3dyxt0,FANTASMABOBB,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:45:36 2015 UTC,"""brilliant own-goal"", seems like an oxymoron..."
FIFA,3dyxt0,FANTASMABOBB,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:47:28 2015 UTC,It is. I was intending to be sarcastic. I hope the goalkeeper AI is better in 16.
FIFA,3dyxt0,CherryBurster,2,Mon Jul 20 17:49:23 2015 UTC,"I get it, I've seen a lot of these types of own goals posted. Weren't they talking about how much more improved the goalkeeping was going to be in '15? Here's to a better '16..."
FIFA,3dzehw,M8tesacker,4,Mon Jul 20 19:43:51 2015 UTC,"Muriel 100%! His power shot is ridiculous. His near post finishes are genuinely the best in the game, in my opinion. 201 goals and 49 assists in 111 matches for me.  *I have Dybala in the same squad. He's very good, but Muriel is just unreal. My Dybala has 88 goals and 79 assists in 111 games."
FIFA,3dzehw,mongy-gonkhaus,3,Mon Jul 20 21:47:48 2015 UTC,"Muriel, he's a monster"

FIFA,3dzehw,fifajackgento,2,Mon Jul 20 19:44:52 2015 UTC,Muriel
FIFA,3dzehw,foreverarsenal7,2,Tue Jul 21 01:49:17 2015 UTC,Muriel
FIFA,3dzehw,HazardousMLS,2,Tue Jul 21 06:00:39 2015 UTC,Dybala
FIFA,3dzehw,zackrider,2,Mon Jul 20 19:45:57 2015 UTC,Dybala
FIFA,3dzehw,NicoBianchiCABJ,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:02:28 2015 UTC,"Dybala has crazy agility and acceleration, he turns on a dime and weaves in and out of defenders. Muriel is a decent generic ""Pace and 4* skills"" striker but Dybala is crazily good."
