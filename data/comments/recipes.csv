recipes,3e2w0h,FEED_ME_MOAR_HUMANS,2,Tue Jul 21 17:06:30 2015 UTC,I understand what you are saying and my example was extreme but it can easily scale down to a human level. What checks are there (if any) between me submitting my own recipe or going to food network and submitting Alton Browns?   There are so many recipes out there it's tough to get a gauge on what's good and what's not. Just because someone submits grandmas famous apple pie doesn't make it instantly a classic. Grandma could have been a bad cook. It seems like a convoluted way to raise money for hunger. It would be more fun to have people submit recipes which people vote on then trigger an action like bake sale for hunger.  The recipes should be a key to another action where someone is tasting the food.  Again i am just one person in a vast sea of millions on Reddit. Take what I say with a grain of salt.

recipes,3e0dt7,againstthesky,4,Tue Jul 21 06:18:51 2015 UTC,"Thanks for pointing that out. This dish is actually complicated in some sense. My intention is to introduce the true Chinese cooking to American friends. 100% authenticity is really not necessary and causes some confusion.  Besides, I had that long time ago, and I tried a bag of premium grade pixian doubanjiang couple months ago. I don't know the quality of Pixian doubanjiang in China, but the quality of that in the States is not as good as before even for the top brands. For the same price, I'll go for Japanese or Taiwanese brands here.  In addition, not everyone realizes or appreciates distinct tastes. For example, some of my white friends really hate the smells of Kimchi. After all, my version is already ten times more authentic than those made by the Cantonese cooks in the States."

recipes,3e0dt7,chromiselda,2,Tue Jul 21 06:54:39 2015 UTC,"Agreed!!! Where did that beef come from anyway?? Also not quite sure why Korean chillies are recommended, China has lots of great chillies of their own (and they practically don't import chillies at all), so no version would use non-Chinese chillies.  Bickering over ingredients aside, rest of the recipe looks solid."
recipes,3e0dt7,chromiselda,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:21:59 2015 UTC,"The very first recipe by Mapo, the inventor, only uses beef for the strong flavor and garlic greens without garlic, ginger and green onions. However, most Chinese people like pork more than beef for the tender texture. Also, cows are friends to people in rural area. Until now, some people still don't eat beef at all. That's why most recent recipes only use pork. Half beef and half pork is the ratio I like most. IMO, just use the meat you like most.  For the chili, I recommend Korean chili or paprika because they are milder and redder than the Chinese chili. Again, just use the one you like.  In short, what really matter are the cooking procedures and the balance of seasoning. Authenticity does not guarantee the dish suit your tastes."
recipes,3e0dt7,sentimentmachine,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:14:44 2015 UTC,"With your milder and redder comment, you may be surprised to know:   Most of the paprika sold in the world actually comes from China (not Spain / Hungary). It's super, SUPER red, and very mild / sweet. There's a medium heat chilli in China that's also exported all around the world in large quantities called Yidu Chilli.   If you can get hold of them, try them out. It's what the locals here use. If you can't, then give me a shout and I will send over some to you for free wherever you are from here in Hong Kong. I sell these spices for a living, retail all the way up to export in containers. :)"

This gets rid of excess grease. Add the rinsed & strained meat back to the pan. Add a dash of black and cayenne pepper to the meat, stir evenly to distribute to the rest of the meat. Add the entire packet of Taco Bell taco seasoning. Again, be sure to evenly distribute it across all of the meat. Stir it up nice and good.

Keep on low or warm until you eat. Most people use Sweet Baby Ray's.  I also recommend making your own soup! Add uncooked chicken, in small pieces, to water with salt, thyme, pepper, parsley, and dill. Cook on high for 2-3 hours, then add veggies of choice (I usually do scallions, carrots, celery, leeks, lentils and sometimes kale.) Cook on low until about 20-30 minutes before you eat it, and then add either rice or noodles (add to crockpot based on cooking time needed for either).   Chili is another awesome one for the crockpot. Last time I made it I did half ground beef half ground turkey (less fat), crushed tomatoes, a ton of chili powder, a bit of cayenne, small pieces of peppers (red, green, and/or yellow).

recipes,3drm7w,Jkbids1,13,Sat Jul 18 20:01:40 2015 UTC,"I think what's going to help more than filling meals would be planning ahead for healthy snacks! That way, when you get the urge, you can eat without going too far with it - and you're still satisfying the hand-to-mouth urge.  One of my favorites for this is sunflower seeds, since they're involved to eat once you learn to split them in your mouth and spit the shell. Pistachios are also a little labor-intensive. Cut fruit can also do well - cut into small pieces and eat with a toothpick! In a pinch, I'll pour a small amount of fruit juice into a shot glass or wine glass and enjoy it really slowly.  I guess what I'm saying is - constantly eating definitely isn't a bad thing! Try prepackaging some healthy snacks, cut raw veggies and fruit and so on so that you can just grab it when you feel the urge. Trying to suppress it or just eat big meals might actually lead to binge eating anyway if you happen to be inclined to that.  Congratulations on quitting! I wish the absolute best for you!"

I also found foods with soluble fiber like oatmeal, barley (it is so good, great when prepared like oatmeal or boiled in chicken stock), and pears.  I found they keep me full a long time!    My stay full creation is to cook two parts oatmeal one part barley separately in honey water (just honey dissolved in water, use to taste).  Once both are cooked I stir them together with just enough honey with cinnamon in it to sweeten the dish.  Then I add half inch pieces of sliced pear that I have sprinkled with cinnamon sugar on top of.  When I pair this with an egg for breakfast I normally don't get hungry until 7 or 8 hours later and keeps me from grazing.  I also found having a full glass of water with every meal helps keep me full an extra half hour on average.  Happy cooking (and eating!)"

Both have a very high satiety factor.   Don't take this the wrong way but your best bet for long term success is going to be learning self control and discipline. Don't chase the full stomach feel, there's nothing wrong with being hungry. It's actually a good feeling and we're fortunate enough to know the feeling is temporary and that it will be extinguished within time when mealtime comes. Intermittent fasting also helps and water and coffee help with getting through the fast until you learn to fast without coffee."

Just slice up your pineapple (you may want to do it thinly to make sure it's cooked all the way through) and sprinkle cinnamon on each side (you can be pretty generous) and cook in a little oil.  It's like heaven.  You can also cook banana like this.  It's moreso just a little treat.  I like adding sultanas or dried fruit (Can you eat that?) in to couscous dishes morroccan style - It's tasty.  I don't like chewy dried fruit so I normally soak it in warm water for a little while before adding it in.  I really like persian food which pairs fruit in to savoury really well - Try fessenjan which is like a pomegranate & chicken stew.  There's also a rice dish with barberries (you could substitute with some kind of dried or cooked fruit).  Devilled sausages is really tasty also - It's basically sausages cooked with apples and onions.  Hope this gives you some options!"

Because I have to take a paying job at another company and can primarily work on my labor of love on evenings/weekends, I've been too busy to browse recently and have solely looked for opportunities to help someone in a way that helps me too. I'll admit that, and I see I've not been even close to holding to the 10%-your-own-stuff rule, though I'm not sure if that's really meant to apply to helpful, often upvoted replies to posts requesting the information I provide.  Purchasing the privilege is a lot to ask for a small team and a company that makes so little money it is nearly pre-revenue, but I will look into running some ads instead and hope our limited budget can get us somewhere that way.  In any case, I will of course be happy to adjust my approach or leave this sub, but again, I don't see what's pernicious about answering the question even if it contains a link to a site I'm affiliated with. It's a right afforded bloggers, after all, because their posts are about recipes. My site is too."
recipes,3dqrfp,spoonacular,1 point,Sun Jul 19 07:22:17 2015 UTC,An informative advertisement is still an advertisement.  The ugly part is that you're deliberately blurring the lines between content and self-promotional marketing.  What if every cooking website started posting like this?
recipes,3dqrfp,mabake02,1 point,Sun Jul 19 13:46:28 2015 UTC,"What if every cooking website responded to recipe requests asking for recipes with/without certain ingredients by providing links to recipes with/without those ingredients? What if they replied to posts asking for apps to help with losing weight, meal planning, or managing recipes? I suppose the OPs would get one additional answer to their queries, and the cooking sites might find some new users.  I won't argue with the policy if the mods decide we're out of bounds here, but I honestly believe our posts are as valuable as every other response and we've never gone out of our way to twist the words of an OP just to find an opportunity to plug our stuff."

recipes,3dmiv9,mrbigshot,13,Fri Jul 17 15:46:58 2015 UTC,"Freezing them will result in cell damage due to ice crystal formation.  This sounds like a terrible thing, but in reality it happens to every solid object that you freeze.  The idea is that the slower things freeze, the larger the ice crystals get and the more cell damage that results.  Basically, fruits get watery and mushy when frozen.  For a smoothie? Who cares! They will still taste great and the texture isn't really a concern.  If you want to freeze strawberries to use whole, put them in the fridge for a few hours before freezing to quicken the time from cold to rock-hard.  Using dry ice is a good idea too (SAFELY!) if you want.  The only other thing that I would be worried about when freezing sliced strawberries is oxidation (turning brown).  To minimize this get as much air out of the bag as possible before freezing.  If you want, slice them and soak them in red wine or something similarly acidic.  This disables the process that causes browning, and adds flavor!  I kinda went nuts here... carry on..."

Dribble 3 or 4 spoonfuls of the juice out of the Greek pepper jar over the roast.   -Top the roast with one packet of dry ranch dressing mix.   -Throw it in the oven at 325 and forget about it for 3 hours or so depending on size.

recipes,3dmyrm,HRBLT,2,Sat Jul 18 00:53:03 2015 UTC,"try char siu if you have access to an asian market, or whole foods. Serve with plain, long grain rice, preferably jasmine.  Ingredients  Servings: 1    1 kg of pork (shoulder?) 5 tablespoons light soy sauce 3 tablespoons dark soy sauce 5 generous tablespoons maltose 4 tablespoons white sugar 4 tablespoons Chinese rice wine 4 tablespoons Hoisin sauce 3-4 pieces ginger, peeled and smashed 3-4 cloves garlic, whole and smashed red food color 2 tablespoons maltose, warmed      Directions    Clean the pork and remove the skin. In a medium saucepan, combine all the marinade ingredients (light soy sauce through to garlic). Heat the mixture for one minute, to allow the sugar and maltose to dissolve. Let cool. Place a few tablespoons of the marinade into a small bowl, and add a small amount of food color. Stir to dissolve completely. Pour the colored marinade back into the main mixture, and mix thoroughly. Check color intensity, and repeat the steps as necessary until the desired intensity of red coloring is achieved. Add the pork to the marinade and allow it to macerate in the refrigerator for anywhere between four hours to overnight. Stir occasionally to ensure all sides of the meat are well-covered with marinade. [I only managed to marinate my pork for about 2 hours, and it worked fine.] Remove the marinated pork from the fridge about 20-30 minutes before cooking, to allow it to come back to room temperature. Preheat the oven to 210C or 410F. Line a roasting pan with foil and place a rack in it. Place the pork lengthwise on the rack. [I also added about ? inch of hot water to the bottom of the roasting pan just to help keep the meat moist. This is optional.] Put it in the oven and cook for 10-15 minutes (about 10 minutes for the tenderloin and 15 for the shoulder). Baste the meat with the marinade and turn it over. Reduce the heat to 180C or 360F, and cook for another 10-15 minutes.Baste the pork again and return to the oven for another 5-10 minutes. Check for doneness. My tenderloin was done in about 25 minutes or so in total, and the shoulder about 40 minutes or so."

I recommend elevating the peru-ness by serving with a salsa criollo to counter the richness of the pork, and some plain rice or roasted potatoes.    Food Wishes' Pork al Latte is, for me, also a must-try. It is amazing. And you could probably simplify the Char Siu ingredients to:    1 kg of pork (shoulder?) 8 tablespoons soy sauce 5 generous tablespoons honey 4 tablespoons white sugar 4 tablespoons white wine 4 tablespoons Hoisin sauce 3-4 pieces ginger, peeled and smashed 3-4 cloves garlic, whole and smashed red food color 2 tablespoons honey, warmed    and the results would be comparable, and all available at a well-stocked supermarket (hoisin is almost always in the ""International"" section). If they have whole star anise in the spices section I would throw a couple of those in the marinade, too."
recipes,3dmyrm,HRBLT,2,Sat Jul 18 20:10:38 2015 UTC,"Oven-Style Kalua Pork.   Slice a couple of large onions into 1/2"" rings, and arrange in a large baking dish.   Get a 5-6 lb pork butt/shoulder (bone in or bone out) and go all stabby on it with a chef's knife; stab it about 8-12 times like in Psycho. Crush 5-6 cloves fresh garlic (don't use garlic powder) and press this into the holes. Rub the pork all over the surface and inside the holes using a 3 oz. bottle of liquid smoke.  you can use the entire bottle on a 5-6 lb butt.  I know this sounds insane, but it comes out great.  If it seriously sounds like too much for you to take, only use half the bottle, but I wouldn't use less. Now rub the pork all over and in the holes with a mixture of 2 parts salt and 1 part paprika.  You can use about 1 tablespoon salt for this much pork, so that would be about 1 Tb salt + 1/2 Tb paprika. Place the seasoned pork on the bed of onions.  Wrap tightly with foil and bake at 250F for 6-8 hours, until the pork temps out at about 200F at the center, and the meat breaks apart easily.  Let cool enough to handle, then pull into large shreds.   You can make pulled pork sandwiches by serving on toasted buns with barbecue sauce and coleslaw.  Or make pulled pork cheese fries or nachos, use it as a topping on pizza, make tacos or burritos, fry it up with potatoes to make hash, etc.  Or just serve with rice or potato salad and some teriyaki sauce on the side."

Great for literally everything.   What I will do is make a plan of what I will make during the week, usually picking up a few different kinds of meat to marinate/freeze.   Frozen veggies are actually really efficient. Kale, corn, onions, you name it.   Also breakfast for dinner (like scrambled eggs with veggies, sausage/bacon, and toast) makes a great dinner. Especially if you add salsa to the eggs!  I also recommend making your own soup in the crockpot. Either with bouillon or cook chicken ahead of time to make broth (which can be frozen). When you are getting ready to make it, add what you are in the mood for: meat, veggies, noodles (be sure to cook noodles seperate and then add when ready to eat to avoid them getting soggy). Lentils and orzo are also great additions."

recipes,3dmc9p,boondock_saint5,1 point,Sat Jul 18 09:17:00 2015 UTC,"You do need to boil the jars even just for making refrigerator pickles (ie, filling sterilized jars with cucumber spears, pouring boiled brine over them, and storing them in the fridge). They need to be sterilized. You probably could get away with boiling the jars and just dousing the plastic lids in boiling water briefly, if they'll take the heat.   I highly recommend first reading up on basic canning food safety. The Nat'l Center for Home Preservation is a great resource, especially for making pickles. Also, /r/pickling.  I've given up on hot water bath canning for pickles, as they always come out a bit too mushy for me. (I've tried several ways of trying to keep them crisp.) Instead I do a whole refrigerator shelf of fridge pickles. More bang for the buck and less effort. They stay perfectly crisp for up to 9 months, I find. And the brine makes a wicked pickle martini.  In any case, here's my go-to recipe that I found here on Reddit /r/pickling:  Slice cukes as desired. Wash and remove blossom ends. If you're leaving them whole, pierce them with a fork a couple of times to make sure the brine gets in there. Sometimes I even add a garlic clove or 2 in each cuke.   Dissolve 3/4 cup pickling salt in 2 gallons water. Add cukes. Let soak 24-48 hours. Rinse cukes.  Bring to a boil: 3/4 cup pickling salt, 2 quarts water, 8 cups cider vinegar, 2/3 cups sugar  Prepare jars: Jars must be heated in a hot water canner and at 140 degrees for raw pack process.  Divide into sterilized pint jars: small handful fresh dill per jar (1 or 2 heads), 2 heads or so of garlic, 1 Tbsp pickling mix, one (washed) wild grape leaf per jar (or a couple sour cherry leaves, or an oak leaf). Pack rinsed cukes in jars. Pour hot liquid over cukes and close with 2-pc caps.   Refrigerate and eat after 3 weeks to 1 year. Or process in hot water bath 10 minutes for shelf-stable cukes."

Wrap brie in pie crust, brush with egg yolk if desired. Bake at 350 until crust starts to brown. Let cool until edible. Serve with crackers if desired. Enjoy."

In response, some dickhead burnt the building to the ground.  The CVS was never built.  Instead, there's a large apartment complex that takes up most of that block and is built up around Cool Beans.  Hooya was sold to some people who didn't manage it very well, and it quickly went under when they started using lower quality ingredients.  There's now a local BBQ place in its location.  It sounds bad, but Denton has changed a lot in the last 5 years, mostly for the better.  Fry street has been abandoned as the ""happening"" part of town.

Dump a can of cream of mushroom or chicken condensed soup into a roasting pan, add water & some spices (don't forget liquid 'spices' like bbq sauce & Worcestershire sauce). Cook in a 350 deg oven for ~1 hr or until done.  Stir frys - Cut up meat & veges into bite-size pieces, add some oil to a large pan, quick-sear meat first, then add veges. Toss & cook until veges are soft.  And if you want something just for fun, to make you all slow down for a bit to eat & chat over a long, relaxed meal...try a fondue meal. Fun, but time-consuming: Cut up a lot of meat, veges & bread to bite-size pieces. This works best if you have a hot plate you can put at the table. - Cheese fondue - Take cheese (preferably shredded, but at least cut small), a touch of water (1/4 c or less), some acid (1 tbsp vinegar/lemon juice/balsamic/wine/beer), and about 1 tbsp of flour/cornstarch. Spice if you wish. Place over low-med heat and whisk constantly until cheese is fully melted. - Broth - spice up a commercially made broth. Keep just shy of boiling to cook your meat & veges in - chocolate - melt chocolate over a double boiler (or metal bowl over a pan of water). Dip in fruits/cake squares."
recipes,3de55z,wdjm,2,Wed Jul 15 16:03:18 2015 UTC,"These are great ideas.   However, as a Swiss, your cheese fondue recipe killed me a little bit inside.   You want to make sure you use a mix of a hard and soft cheese (we normally use Emmental and Gruyere).   Don't use water. You want to be using white wine, preferably something dry. If you don't like the alcohol taste, can replace with stock. Warm it and use it as a base to melt the cheese in.   The cornflour you can dissolve in a bit of kirsch, for an extra kick.   Spices that work well are paprika and nutmeg.   And final pro top, rub the pan with some garlic when you start. And then dump it in when the cheese is melted.   E guete!"
recipes,3de55z,CallMeACab,2,Thu Jul 16 08:03:02 2015 UTC,"I like /u/wdjm's idea of a roast, but I think a pot roast would be a great idea as well considering it's a lot more beginner proof than roasting.  Blade roast works best for this, but any of the round roasts will work...heck any of the tough cuts are great for pot roast.  Take an oven proof dutch oven (cast iron is great, stainless will work too), or something similar and heat it on high with enough oil to cover the bottom.  Sear the roast on all sides and remove.    Drain off most of the fat, but leave a little.  Toss in 2 carrots chopped into bite sized pieces and a large onion of the same chop and a half pound of whole, smaller mushrooms. stir on medium high for 4 minutes.    Add 4 cloves of garlic whole.  They're a nice little surprise treat since they get soft and sweet during the cooking process. At this point you could also add pepper, thyme, rosemary or all of the above.  Stir for 30 seconds to help release the oils that give the herbs their flavour.  Add 1 bottle of DARK beer (a porter works best) and a quart of beef stock (store bought works but get reduced or no salt stuff.).  At this point you could add either 2tbsp of worchestershire or 3tbsp of soy sauce.  Keep in mind these are both salty.  Bring the whole thing up to a simmer and taste  I'd start with 1 teaspoon of salt but don't go overboard.  It's better to under season than to over season.  You can always salt at the table, but you cant take it away.  If you want to make this REALLY easy, pour the pot into a slow cooker if you've got one and add the roast.  Set on low and let it go for around 4 hours minimum.  If you don't have a slow cooker, an oven will work just as well.  Put on a tight fitting lid (if your pot lids are vented, use foil instead) and put into a 250f oven for at least 4 hours.  You should be able to stick a fork all the way in to the base of the tines and turn 90 degrees with not much effort. That's how you know it's done.  At this point, turn the oven or slow cooker off and remove 2 to 3 cups of the liquid and strain into a pot and bring to a simmer.  Take 2 tablespoons of soft butter and 2 tablespoons of all purpose flour and mix until it looks like a dough and there's no raw flour showing (This is called a beurre manie and it's the easiest way to thicken a gravy without any lumps).  Add this in little pieces to the simmering liquid while whisking.  Keep going until there's no lumps. If it looks to thick, you can add a little more liquid.  If it's too thin add a little more beurre manie.    You can take the roast out and carve it. Fish the carrots, mushrooms and onions out and serve it all with your choice of other side and enjoy.  If you decide to do this and have questions, feel free to message me and I'll give you a hand."

recipes,3dbo7f,Lava_Doctor,5,Wed Jul 15 02:54:07 2015 UTC,I don't understand... It's literally just chocolate sauce topped with oreos. Am I missing something?

recipes,3dbo7f,KlausTeuber,2,Wed Jul 15 12:46:24 2015 UTC,This kills the oreo.
recipes,3dbo7f,2hardtry,0,Wed Jul 15 18:23:15 2015 UTC,"I'm afraid this is a confusing and inappropriate name for your recipe.  The sauce doesn't contain Oreos, so it should just be ""Hot Fudge Sauce"".  If the recipe were for the finished dish, it would be something like ""Ice Cream with Hot Fudge Sauce and Oreos""."
