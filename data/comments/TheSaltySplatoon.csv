Some of the stuff on this sub hasnt been sticking to the theme. If people want to post that kind of stuff, restrict it to one day like r/spongebros."
TheSaltySplatoon,3aktyd,Agonghast,2,Sun Jun 21 16:56:50 2015 UTC,"Well, we want to appeal to more people. So if we allow all Splatoon memes more people will come."

TheSaltySplatoon,3aktyd,SilverFan3702,3,Sun Jun 21 18:38:39 2015 UTC,"Since most of the people in this thread are being blithering idiots, I'll throw in my two cents.   Quality control: But what does that MEAN!? It means stop allowing low effort memes and reaction images. If the post has nothing to do with splatoon apart from its title, it should not be allowed. If it's just an unedited inkling, it should not be allowed. If the edit is just some stupid meme face and nothing else, it should not be allowed. And most importantly, if the post isn't a combination of Splatoon and Spongebob (or another popular cartoon, like r/spongebros now shows) it should NOT be allowed. But Namaztak, that'll kill the subreddit with so much content gone! If you would rather have a spammed to shit subreddit where actual effort is rewarded the same or less than nothing, you're doing it wrong. We don't allow bullshit on r/bindingofIsaac, but we're also not complete fun sponges because we know how to differentiate. Regardless of the size difference in communities, it makes a better sub when you give a shit about what's posted.   If you need help enforcing all this, I will gladly help moderate."

And if it is one of those two you listed then who gives a fuck. This game isn't just for some sort of elite player set. Its targeted at all ages.   So it's a kid who can't change the Mii, do they suddenly not have permission to play?   And if this mother hasn't played anything else then this is a win for Nintendo. What she played before doesn't dictate what she can play now.   Its a 3 minute match. Spend 3 minutes and try to get over your prejudice and have fun. In the words of Shia Labeouf JUST DO IT"
TheSaltySplatoon,398ozs,tonuchi,5,Wed Jun 10 12:21:33 2015 UTC,"If it's a gamer who happens to be a mom they usually don't have their Mii be named ""mom"".
