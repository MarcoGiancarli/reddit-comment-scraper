Tried other variations of the track and faster cars, but wasn't really enjoying it much. Bit more tame car and the track is a little more usable, for me at least."
pcars,3e2733,Naratik,4,Tue Jul 21 11:36:43 2015 UTC,"The R18 E-tron Quattro is pretty great actually. It got a 50/50 weight bias (the 2011 got a 48/52) and it weighs 30 kg less than the 2011 R18 + it got 4wd with the electric drive, so it is also better when its slippery. So it got superb cornering, probably the best of all of the LMP-cars.   It generates 640'ish horsepower with the electric engine and 535 hp without. Torque is up to 1000 even without the electic engine activated (1200+ with it activated)  Havent played much with the others, but the R8 got a stronger engine but is not as strong in the corners as the new ones, which is the same thing the BMW and Mercedes from the last update struggles with."
pcars,3e2733,Sect93,3,Tue Jul 21 12:41:43 2015 UTC,Won't this make the old R18 useless?
pcars,3e2733,WhileCultchie,4,Tue Jul 21 16:02:31 2015 UTC,"Pretty much I guess. I am faster around La Sarthe by several seconds in the new E-tron Quattro at least.   But the RWD LMP1 has always been the fastest of the LMP's on that track, the E-tron is actually giving it a battle now though."
pcars,3e2733,Sect93,2,Tue Jul 21 16:36:21 2015 UTC,"It's just two different years of the R18, this one with hybrid and 4WD"
pcars,3e2733,BassBona,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:32:54 2015 UTC,The old R18 by default is weaker than the Marek and RWD LMP1. It is literally the Rebellion of pcars with Audi skin.   Still hoping to see TS040 in pcars.

pcars,3e2733,MeMuzzta,2,Tue Jul 21 14:55:12 2015 UTC,"I wish they had season passes for this game, like DriveClub or Battlefield 4. I wish I could just pay a flat rate and get all the upcoming DLC's free"
pcars,3e2733,HateSleepingAloneeee,3,Tue Jul 21 21:13:27 2015 UTC,So you would rather pay a high price for content thst is not even a ounced yet the. Pay for it has its announced and know what you are getting?  What if all the other DLC was cwrs you had zero I trest in?
pcars,3e2733,nomnamless,3,Wed Jul 22 02:18:37 2015 UTC,"Just as a small counter point to your statement...  Much of the future dlc is known.  It has been known for 9 months to a year.  The content yet to be released in large part is no secret.  Even many of the original pcars backers were testing it before the game was released in may.  With some searching, if someone was so inclined, they would know what is to come and could make a decision on whether buying a season pass sorta thing is worthwhile for them or not.  I also highly doubt SMS will release a dlc that appeals to no-one.  It's simple business and marketing.  If you have a pack of 3-4 items, make sure at least 1 item is something highly demanded by lots of people so they feel they must own the pack even if the other 2-3 things in it have no appeal whatsoever.  For instance, the Audi 90 GTO.  Many people love that style of car from the old IMSA era, and have zero interest in modern prototypes.  Why would SMS make a 5 car pack of cars that are all in the same class as that A1 quattro released?  They wouldnt because no one would buy it.  They'd plop in something that lots of people want, thereby making buying the pack the only way to get that 1 prized car.  Anyways though, by now it's apparent that if you like the feel of a handful of cars in the game already, you will know what to expect in the future.  Road cars feel fairly similar as do the GT cars and prototypes.  If you like that feeling, and want more... well, SMS is gonna give you that."
pcars,3e2733,smudi,2,Wed Jul 22 05:56:43 2015 UTC,That is a very fair point.  I actually don't know much about what DLC is in the future for Pcars.  My experiance with season passes though has been. Give us $40 for 6 extra DLC.  You don't know what they will be but by giving us money now you save your self $5
pcars,3e2733,nomnamless,1 point,Wed Jul 22 06:16:31 2015 UTC,"I agree with you about season passes in general.  I loathe them.  I will never actually buy one if the option is available and instead wait for the ""full game"" to be re-released later as the complete edition or whatever.  To me, season passes offer horrible value.  Like you said, you really dont know what you are going to get.  Some of it may be good, other may be utter garbage.  And when they have your money up front, you have no way to insure that you wont get screwed.  Take the Assassin's Creed season passes.  A couple of missions, and some cosmetic stuff.  $30.  That's egregiously outrageous in every sense.  I feel similarly with pcars.  When the base game has ~70 cars and ~25 tracks and the retail cost is $50/60 depending on platform, to be charged $40-50 more for dlc after it is all said and done for probably about 30 more cars total and another 12 tracks?  Far too much.  At this point, Im just not a fan of how SMS is going about things.  That said, to my previous point about knowing future dlc...  Check out this link if you are interested.  This is an archive of all the major news posts from the wmd portal for the backers before release.  Page 2 is the more recent stuff, and page 1 is the old stuff.  Check out page 1 for many car licenses being announced and some WIP infos.  Some of this stuff is actually really neat to browse as some of the articles actually have real details in them and not just marketing fluff.  There are plenty more cars announced and that have been worked on that will release down the road.  GTPlanet has a good thread about future content.  Here for cars and here for tracks."
pcars,3e2733,smudi,1 point,Wed Jul 22 07:05:29 2015 UTC,"Ha, I was thinking the same when they announced they wouldnt do that sort of practice.  For what pCARS turned into, where they pump out dlc often and then continue the franchise a year or two later with a new game, this is sorely needed.  SMS says they chose not to because not everyone would want all the content they pump out.  I agree with that, and this is nice that they dont force you to pay a huge price for everything released.    However...  I think as has been proven with the first dlc packs, that the price is going to sky rocket quite quickly.  $5 limited ed pack, ~$3 modified car par, $3.50 dlc 1, and now $5.50 dlc 2... shit.  SMS already showed that they will have dlc every month for another 6 or so months.  And at ~$5 each time, that's too damn expensive in total.  A season pass would have at least discounted buying everything and would have still allowed people to buy individual packs if they wanted.  There really is no reason to not have a season pass in this sort of game besides screwing the customers out of even more money.  :p  Yeah, 3-4 bucks is cheap, and people bitch about everything these days, I get that... but for a $50 franchised game that probably wont be seeing much effort put into it this time next year, and with total dlc that will likely cost upwards of $40-50, that is way too damn expensive."
pcars,3e2733,smudi,3,Tue Jul 21 22:21:15 2015 UTC,"Forza Motorsport 3 had a Year of DLC without a season pass. It was A LOT of money.  But if PCARS has this $3.50 for car packs and $5.50 for expansion packs, I have zero issue with it. Season Passes could make or break trust, and not many games have the good deal feel like Driveclub's season pass. I felt completely robbed with Forza Horizon 1 because it had nothing but FM4 DLC and rerolls of existing models in FM4. Really? Vowed to never touch a Forza title after that point. Forza's DLC is still insanely expensive with a bunch of recycles. Not many say much other than about how awesome it is, and I think it's sad."
pcars,3e2733,Samsquanchhh,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:38:50 2015 UTC,"Im not at all familiar with Forza's dlc practices besides hearing that their more recent titles all had quite a lot, at a pretty hefty price.  Comparing pCARS to Forza, I think it is rather clear that the dlc in pCARS is going to be cheaper overall, and I appreciate that.  However, perhaps I just have different opinions on this sort of thing, but pCARS feels like an inbetween title to me.  Not a hardcore sim, and not a casual console racer.  So to me, the dlc feels more like content that was purposely left out just to be sold later at a higher price.    The content isnt good enough imo, to warrant a high individual price like some hardcore racing sims offer.  Nor are they doing the season pass which is what most casual or semi-serious games do.  Instead they come out with this ""on demand"" gimmick which is nothing more than a way to sell all of their future dlc individually for a higher price.  (than if it were to all be bundled in a season pass sort of pack)  Perhaps I am quite soured by claims long ago that Project Cars would be... well... a long term project.  Instead of a franchise that pumps out a new title every few years.  In that sense, if it were more hardcore and an actual long term project, I could see the dlc being more expensive even.  It would have more value to it.  It would have that added worth because it would be here to stay.  It wouldnt just feel like they gimped the game to pump out some dlc to make a quick buck and then move onto the next game where everything would be included.  Rather than that, what we ended up getting was the pCARS 2 announcement where the car and track list is doubled... shit."

Since they didn't feel it would sell anyway, and because they don't have the requisite talent to do port it efficiently in a cost effective manner, they dropped it. It was never about power. It was always about dollars. Can't fault them for the dollars part. Can fault them for the lying they did all along about it. Anyone who defends that is a scumbag apologist.

My experience is coming from the McLaren F1 (damn you three hour race), SLS GT3, and BMW M1.  Turn one is all about hitting the apex. I brake hard a smidge after the 100m board, downshift, coast and the usually downshift again before the apex. I like to clip my left front on the kerb, and then floor it to turn two.  Turn two; this one gave me a lot of grief. This corner is all about exit speed. Get in the apex, get out and accelerate HARD. I brake hard and quick a bit before the kerbs on the left, and the swing it in (coasting), hit the apex with a touch of throttle, and then give it as much throttle as possible while not spinning the tires. Coming in wide will greatly increase exit speed; remember that the fastest way around a corner is the largest radius.  Turn three game the MOST grief haha. I still have some issues with this one, but it's similiar to turn two; come in wide, a quick downshift, throttle at the apex.  Now a game changer for me at this track was the adjusting the rear diff decel; more turn in means you can get to the apex at a higher speed, and that means more throttle faster, and a quicker exit speed.  Hope this helps."

pcars,3e0g8l,ShoeBearZ,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:33:43 2015 UTC,"No problem! Glad I could help. If you every are having a tough time finding the right line, always remember: slow is smooth and smooth is fast."
pcars,3e0g8l,Zachk907,2,Tue Jul 21 13:32:34 2015 UTC,Turn 3 for me in the formula a car is all about positioning the car so you can floor it before the apex. Accelerating through the apex will help pull the car around the corner as opposed to turning in-apex-then accelerate where your car will probably under steer wide if you don't feather the throttle. Feathering the throttle to keep you on track is slower than steady acceleration all the way through.   Try that out and let me know if it helps your lap times.
pcars,3e0g8l,1Operator,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:26:53 2015 UTC,"That also helped- I found I feathered the throttle in 5th trying to find the hard accelerating spot near the apex. Keeping it smooth definitely helps pull the car around the bend. Nice to have these things pointed out, like feathering- sometimes you never notice you're doing it until you focus on it."
pcars,3dzwg8,Georgerobbo,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:50:42 2015 UTC,The wheel should be calibrated to 900 degrees....then calibrate the wheel in game to full rotation....rotate it to 900 degrees on the 2nd part and press OK. Should work fine after that.

The thin track with little to no room for error or its scraping the side wall. This truly is a butt clenching track from start to finish.    My favorite normal track?

Very different from other tracks."

Although I wouldn't call it my best track, I feel like I can really push a car to (and sometimes over) its limits there. Like driving on a knife edge at times.   Worst track: hmmm... Probably donington. I don't know why, but its really tough for me to find speed there. In career mode I qualify mid pack usually and finish just in or just out of the top 10, but struggle most of the time to push for the leaders. Its not a hard track, and my tunings are probably wrong, but its just tough to really push a car for better times there for me."

pcars,3dvls5,georgin95,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:22:43 2015 UTC,"Favourite would be a tie between Spa and Bathurst. I love Spa for it's overall speed and smoothness, full of overtaking zones. Bathurst, on the other hand, is two overtaking zones, connected by the mountain road from hell. I love it, love it, love it. Except from times, when a guy crashes out and blocks the mountain completely.  Least favourite track from a racing perspective would be Nurburgring. I love to cruise around it, but it is too narrow to have any side-by-side racing, in my opinion. It's either one-line Trulli train or an earodynamic train."

It's got some real quick corners and dicey sections but a huge straight and couple of tight corners great for overtaking... Not to mention I'm pretty good there.

pcars,3dsk7p,Adinair94,-4,Tue Jul 21 21:20:08 2015 UTC,Why not wait for the Logitech G29? its for the PS4 and you can buy their shifter also? if im not wrong it should come out cheaper than Thrustmaster's option.
pcars,3dsk7p,Gullible_Goose,6,Sun Jul 19 04:26:03 2015 UTC,"The G29 is gear-driven, which is not as good as belt driven force feedback which the Thrustmaster wheels provide. Less detail. Thus, it is a better bang for your buck to get a Thrustmaster."
pcars,3dsk7p,patrys,2,Sun Jul 19 05:13:20 2015 UTC,"Also it's Logitech: a company that will soon announce that they no longer support G29 and that you need to purchase a G31 which will be the same G27 but with a wunder-baum little tree air freshener attached. And a Chip™, don't forget the Chip™!"

Indianapolis will obviously be one of the tracks, but no idea what other tracks might be included."

pcars,3doxcc,monsterZERO,2,Sun Jul 19 02:57:28 2015 UTC,That's a really good mix of ovals. I would love to see Bristol rendered in pCars though. Night races there would probably look amazing.

There other DLC cars like R18 etron, R9 LMP900 and Audi GTO has different lines that is tied to the next DLC. Also, I also saw files for next months DLC too.   There is also some obviously incomplete files on potential new cars from a new manufacturer that I am expecting to be out in September.   SMS really should not put these files inside the game.

pcars,3dmnzm,Cheesenium,6,Fri Jul 17 23:22:44 2015 UTC,Nah. I'm sure it's a great car in the real world but there's no sense of speed with these types of cars in computer games. Going round corners at 50mph feels fast in real life but on a screen it's like I'm driving in slow motion. Even cars like the LaFerrari in Assetto Corsa feel incredibly tedious to drive for me with the lack of tyre grip in corners.
pcars,3dmnzm,whateverdaheva,1 point,Sat Jul 18 09:24:04 2015 UTC,Awesome.  Any word on the 12 tracks set to be released this month?  I need to find out if they're $DLC or freebies!  Gonna nab em either way!
pcars,3dmnzm,Skyphos,3,Fri Jul 17 15:09:52 2015 UTC,For that amount of tracks it would very likely be paid DLC

pcars,3dmnzm,chimpyman,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:38:00 2015 UTC,5 layout for Ruapuna if I'm not wrong. A pretty dull looking track but it is pretty fun to drive in a mod version in rFactor.

pcars,3dmnzm,AS14K,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:02:39 2015 UTC,Coulda swore i saw that on their (Project Cars) page yesterday.
pcars,3dmnzm,Mikeastuto,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:46:43 2015 UTC,"You arent wrong.  It's listed right here.  Scroll to the bottom.  It will be paid dlc though.  It's not 12 tracks though.  In typical SMS' misleading fashion, it's only a couple actual locations, with multiple layouts.  They are counting all of the variations as separate tracks.  Just like how the base game has 100 ""tracks"" although only about 25 locations."
pcars,3dmnzm,nipcarlover,3,Fri Jul 17 20:53:34 2015 UTC,"I don't understand how that's misleading.  12 more locations will be added to the game, with multiple layouts on each.  What you have to remember the Indy Car stuff will add a few locations itself.  I will list some that I can think of now   Indianapolis Daytona Spa Historic Silverstone Historic Monza Historic Ruapuna Macau   They are just ones that are publicly known, also I understand some people will say the historic tracks aren't technically new locations but, with them being a different year they will be under a different icon on the menu, like the Nordschleife and the Nurburgring are."
pcars,3dmnzm,AS14K,-1,Fri Jul 17 23:20:03 2015 UTC,"Hmm, I think I was more so referring to the next track pack that is supposed to release sometime soon.  Beyond the audi/ruapana park pack.  I dont know how many that track pack will have, but SMS just claims to have more tracks in the game then there really are by anyone's count.  It's like counting Silverstone as 3-4 different tracks.  It's not.  It's 1 track and it has 3-4 layouts.  That may be pedantic but it's a key difference.  The link I listed does say they are adding ""12 unique locations"" which is good!  :)  The handful you listed, and others perhaps, like Mugello that they didnt get in the base game for licensing reasons I believe.  I would also definitely count historic versions as new tracks.  They are entirely different from their modern day counterparts.  Like historic Spa?  Very little of the modern course is the same as the old track.  La Source and Eau Rouge, but beyond that, the rest is massively different.  Im only saying that labeling tracks like Silverstone, Catalunya, Dubai, Sonoma, etc. as multiple tracks each is quite disingenuous.  That is 4 tracks in my example here.  No more.  Yes they all have multiple layouts, but that does not make them a new track.  :p   I wonder if 12 unique locations is the total for the lifespan of this game though?  SMS seems to only be pumping out new content for 2015 and the first 2 months of 2016.  At least according to the chart they distributed.  Each new row is a new month, starting with may at the top.  So 3 down is July, and as you can see, the 2nd free car was listed, along with the track pack.  I just wonder how many tracks that dlc will have.  Will it have 2 tracks and 5 total layouts?  I dont know.  But they do list 5 dlc track packs.  And if they only have 12 more locations coming, that means about 2 tracks each dlc.  Anyways, cheers  :)"
pcars,3dmnzm,Cheesenium,1 point,Sat Jul 18 00:11:06 2015 UTC,"I don't think we are going to see a ""Track Pack"", I could be wrong. But personally think they are going to be cars with tracks.  So for example Indy cars with Indy tracks, Historic Cars with Historic tracks. Maybe they will sell the cars separate to the tracks, suppose we will see over the next few months when ever they release them."

pcars,3dmg0s,chimpyang,5,Fri Jul 17 13:37:45 2015 UTC,"Hi all,  We're rolling out a PC-only patch today to address a number of crash bugs that some users have been experiencing. We're also including a number of wider fixes and new features that will make their way into the other platforms' patch 3 release. Details below.  Project CARS –PC Patch 2.5 – Release Notes   Game Crashes   We spent a lot of time working directly with a number of users who were struggling with game crashes, and resolved as many of these as we could. The various fixes in this patch should help a great deal in making the game more stable for those of you who were experiencing these instabilities.   Pitting, tuning, setups    Fixed a case where the in-game tuning Setup was not being saved under certain conditions. Fixed the issue with cold and current tyre pressure mismatches in pitstop strategy, as well as cold pressure not being correctly applied in the tyre system. Ensure that the Default pitstop strategy is selected as the Active one when starting a new session. Fixed an issue where the wrong vehicle setup would at times be applied to the player’s current vehicle. Fixed another case of where cars would sometimes leave the pits with an invisible reattached wheel. Fixed an issue with the Pit Strategy screen where the displayed values did not reflect the saved settings. Fixed an issue in online races where the pit crew would ignore any changes made to the pit strategy once the player’s car was stationary in the pit box. Reworked some tyre compound names as displayed in the setup screen to ensure that all compounds are named to be indicative of the type of compound it represents in the pit strategy screen. Restrict the selectable pit strategy tyre compound types to only those available for the current vehicle.    Online    Fixed an issue where the Drive button would remain permanently locked when joining an in-progress session. Fixed an issue where, when the player progressed from qualifying to the start of the race, the player’s car would sometimes begin moving without player, resulting in false jump-starts.    Controls * New Feature – Implemented the ability via menu sliders for the user to manually tweak the menu spring strength, stationary / low speed spring strength, and overall steering gain.    New Feature – The Force Feedback Calibration screen now features a multiple force feedback profile selection whereby the user can select a base FFB style that suits personal preference, and then tweak it further as desired. This will then create a ‘Custom’ entry in the profile selection list in addition to the current options: ""Default"" (matches the FFB default settings in Patch 2.0) and ""Classic” (matches the FFB settings in the original release). Fixed an issue with sudden loss of FFB after a crash. Reduced the strength of the menu spring for custom wheels. Fixed an issue where Mouse controls were showing a deadzone in the centre regardless of deadzone setting.  Fixed an issue where rumble on the gamepad could at times cause the game to slow down. Added support and profiles for the Logitech G29 and G920 on PC Added accelerator slip vibration to the wheel rim of Fanatec wheels where available, and fixed brake rumble not working.     Vehicles    Formula A – Added a new tire set which now includes two slick tires - soft and medium. Also rebalanced the heating and wear across all four tyre sets. Wear will now more closely match real-world Formula cars. Heating is more even front to rear also. Further rebalancing of the AI speed as was required, and tweaks to the base setup to accommodate the heat change. Modern street cars - New stiffer tyres for improved drivability to more closely match the real world experience, making these cars more fun and engaging to drive. Made tweaks to the individual setups of the FWD and most Supercars to accommodate the change.  Mclaren P1 - Stiffened up the default suspension to help prevent bottoming out at tracks like Nordschliefe."

pcars,3dmzjt,carloselcoco,3,Fri Jul 17 16:15:45 2015 UTC,"Patch Notes  Performance Improvements   Up to 17% frame rate improvement in extreme conditions   Online & Community Events   Multiplayer search filter 'Skill' now finds games based upon certain lobby game configuration criteria. For example, “Pro” setting now searches for Full Damage or manual-start Engine or Forced Cockpit or Mechanical Failure, and so forth. Community events page – when an event cannot be entered, it will now display the reason why: ‘Coming Soon’ along with a countdown, or ‘Expired’. Online – Ensure that vehicle light repairs are synchronized in MP races so that repaired headlights are visible by other racers. Fix attempt for a hard-to-reproduce issue where the game would at times freeze or crash when 8 or more players joined a session all at once. Fixed an issue that at times would prevent a player from establishing full connectivity when leaving a lobby and trying to reconnect to it.   Controls   Adjustments made to the gears system, to prevent gears being skipped under certain conditions. This addresses an issue where gears would at times jump straight down to 1st, potentially causing engine blowouts. Steering wheels – reduced the centering rate of the steering spring. This improves the feel of steering wheels at very low speeds. Added support for the use of all active controllers for menu input. You can for example now use a steering wheel to race, and a gamepad to control the menus and photo mode. Gear shifters – when using an H-shifter on a car that has a sequential gearbox, the gearbox will now switch through the gears until the gear selected on the H-shifter is reached. Fixed an issue in Force Feedback calibration that would prevent a player from setting ""Soft Clipping (Half Input)"" back to 0 after modifying it from the original value. Built in protection to prevent unsupported controller devices from crashing the game. Gear shifters – fixed an issue that prevented the selection of neutral when using an H-gate shifter add-on with a car that has an H-gate shifter in-game. Implemented accelerator vibration on the gamepad right trigger to indicate when and how much the tyres slip under acceleration.  Madcatz wheel - fixed an issue where the switch on the wheel to change between 270 to 900 degree mode stopped functioning.   Physics & AI   Slowed down the AI opponents in the rain when using racing tyres, to make racing against them better balanced. Adjusted the AI tyre wear rate to better match the player’s tyre wear rate. Adjusted wear of Slicks and Rain tires to more realistic levels where needed. Typically GT/LMP/Formula cars will get slightly more than a full fuel load on soft or default slicks (depending on fuel load amounts). Adjusted the heating of slicks and rain tyres to more realistic levels. Adjusted tyre temperature sensitivity on several cars. Adjusted rain tyres to generally be more sensitive to overheating, and less efficient in the dry. Improvements to AI navigation to lessen collisions during cramped race starts, improve detection of other cars during cornering, and improve clean overtaking Improved the AI pitting logic during practice and qualifying so that the AI cars run more realistic stints before pitting. Reworked the AI’s fuelling logic during qualifying sessions where no refuelling is allowed, so that they don’t always fill up the fuel tanks and negatively impact their qualifying ability. The AI will now deliver far more competitive lap times during qualifying. Fixed an issue where the AI would set impossible lap times during races with pit stops. The AI will now pit as soon as possible when low on fuel to prevent them running out of fuel and retiring from the race. Reduced the effect of damage to the car’s cooling system when suffering aero damage. This prevents engines from overheating and blowing at an unrealistic rate. Fixed an issue that prevented bump starts from working properly on some cars. An example case – with gears and clutch set to manual, take an Ariel Atom out on Brands Hatch. At the first right hander, stall the car, ignition on, 2nd gear, roll down the hill up to about 15kph and drop the clutch. The car will now bump start. Exact conditions for a successful bump start will vary slightly by car. Fixed an issue where at times some AI drivers in a race would use much higher skill levels than the rest of the field. Fixed an issue that prevented the AI from pitting within the final 3 laps of a race Further tweaked the AI ability in wet races to more closely match the player car’s ability in the wet Improved the AI’s efficiency in pit timing when needing to change tyres due to weather conditions.   Pitting, tuning, setups   Fixed an issue where wet tyres were fitted too long before the rain starts, causing excessive overheating and wear on the tyres. Fixed an issue where, when running low on fuel, the Pit Board would appear to tell the player to do a scheduled  pit stop when the player did not schedule a pit stop. Fixed an issue where flat tyres were fitted to the car during a pit stop, by ensuring that the tyres are correctly inflated. Fixed an issue where the car’s bump-stop value decreased after leaving a race session and joining it again. Reworked the brake bias display information so that changing the values is more intuitive.   Tracks   Performance optimisation pass done on: Brands Hatch layouts, Cadwell layouts, Oulton Park layouts, Bathurst, Azure circuit, and Zolder. This helps improve the overall smoothness when racing on these tracks with large grids of cars. Track cutting tolerances reduced on all tracks where it was too forgiving. Fixed an issue where a pit crew character would at times appear floating above the race track on various tracks. Silverstone Stowe – fixed render issues on some tyre stacks, and addressed an issue with cars driving through certain objects. Road America – fixed an issue where a line of grass line appeared in the air near a concrete barrier. Spa Francorchamps – fixed an issue where cars under AI control would bump into the pit wall when exiting the pit lane. Fixed an issue where the AI were running too wide over the exit curb at the Bus Stop Chicane.  Brno – fixed an issue where cars would at times start in the same grid positions, fixed garage six to prevent the AI from getting stuck on the right side wall when exiting the garage spot, fixed an issue when running more than 20 cars in a race would cause the car in 21st to slide into the pits. Le Mans – fixed an issue that would at times cause the car to crash while in the pit lane, leading to a disqualification. Improved the AI race line for better speed, and improved the AI behaviour on curbs.  Laguna Seca – improved the AI performance as they were running too slow in some sections. Imola – Improved the pit lane AI navigation, and fixed an issue with a section of the fence at the pit entrance that appear to float.  Bathurst - fixed a render issue with shimmering edges in parts of the track.   Career   Added a new RUF RGT8 GT3 contract to ensure that the player can enter the RUF GT3 series on contract renewal and not just when starting a new career.  Fixed the unlock details for the Supercar Ardennes Club Day Invitational. Fixed an issue where skipping the session during a race caused the player to move up in the session results.   Vehicles   Group 5 cars – adjusted the gearshift timing tolerances to fix an issue with the gearing when pausing and restarting a session. Gumpert Apollo – fixed an issue with the livery sets that caused the livery selection to display wrong liveries. Aston Martin Vantage GT3 – tuned engine lifetime and brake cooling parameters for better accuracy. Lotus 98T – tweaked turbo to improve AI estimation of top speed. McLaren F1 GTR – modified the default setup and reduced front bump steer to improve straight line stability, fixed an issue to ensure that the car’s specific HUD motec display is used McLaren F1 - Fixed an issue that caused the car to use the wrong default tyre compound. Ford GT40 MK4 – Reworked in several areas to improve handling and match the real car closer - Bump stops settings exposed in setup with better tuned setup defaults, increased wrap around stiffness of the tire carcass, rebalanced base vs tear grip, rebalanced player vs AI rain performance against the AI.  All Formula vehicles – Stop brake light reflections appearing on cars that don’t have brake lights.   General   Fixed an issue where the player position would at times change to last when player crosses the starting line during rolling starts. Fixed an issue that could cause the game to crash when selecting the ‘Edit Tuning Setup’ option in the ‘PIT BOX’ screen. Fixed an issue that could cause the game to crash while watching a saved replay. Driver Network Profile – fixed an issue where entering Free Practice mode would count toward Races Entered. Audio – rebalanced the volume of skid sounds to make them a bit more audible. Updated the achievement ""I am the 5%"" to ensure that it can be achieved in non-Pro-modes as well. Fixed a game crash issue caused by an overflow of the email inbox when the player received above a certain amount of invitational emails. GUI – fixed an issue where the controls configuration arrows in Options would not respond correctly to mouse input when attempting fine adjustment."

You can for example now use a steering wheel to race, and a gamepad to control the menus and photo mode.   So this might be a dumb question....  Could I use two game pad controllers and configure extra inputs on the second controller, say for example: manual start or seat forward/ backward?"
pcars,3dmzjt,fleaver12,0,Fri Jul 17 19:59:05 2015 UTC,"You know what? I never thought of that. My guess is that it is only for different controller models (so racing wheel and gamepad is ok, but not two wheels or two gamepads). Someone should try it out and confirm it to us!"

pcars,3dl77q,wmurray003,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:26:07 2015 UTC,"Just like they're done in real life- multiple drivers driving multiple-hour stints.  I ran the Sebring 12hr, for example, where my team had 3 drivers who each drove 4 hours.  Drove your stint until you hear your race engineer in your ear telling you to box.  Bring her in, kill the engine, swap drivers as the fuel and tyres are changed, start her up and you're back in the race.    EDIT: I should mention that, as in real life, there is generally a schedule decided upon before the race starts.  Obviously it changes as the race goes on, but you usually have a pretty good idea of who'll be in the car when (as opposed to them just taking over when you get tired, as you mentioned)."

pcars,3dj6gg,SonicBroom51,4,Thu Jul 16 23:05:16 2015 UTC,Ditto. When I played at high/medium settings the dips on certain tracks were terrible.
pcars,3dj6gg,CricketDrop,2,Fri Jul 17 00:04:11 2015 UTC,"Something sounds off. I have a 4790k, 16gb and evga 970sc. I'm able to run max everything, 32 cars at nurburgring with 75-100fps. Averages about 85 fps. I haven't spent too many hours with the game yet; are there certain tracks/conditions that really push the engine?"
pcars,3dj6gg,GTAsian,1 point,Fri Jul 17 02:29:51 2015 UTC,Reflections will kill FPS more than anything I believe.
pcars,3dj6gg,Major_Turdcutter,1 point,Fri Jul 17 02:48:38 2015 UTC,In that case it's a CPU bottleneck for me.
pcars,3dj6gg,SonicBroom51,2,Fri Jul 17 02:57:04 2015 UTC,"Did another quick test. It seems like the only thing that causes drops for me is the weather. With full fog and rain, it dropped to the 50's and with thunderstorm conditions, it averaged in the low 40's and dropped to the low 30s at some points. It's surprising that the difference lies in the cpu but if you're lowering graphic settings and it's not changing anything, then it's likely a cpu bottleneck."

pcars,3dlh24,BigHowski,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:40:10 2015 UTC,"That's unfair, other racing games do fine on consoles. Forza 5 is smooth which is much more important than having x amount of extra detail"
pcars,3dlh24,attanasio666,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:50:06 2015 UTC,Yes but PCars physics engine is much more demanding than Forza. The game runs in 900P and it can't get 60fps much of the time. The new patch will improve this a lot but the Xbox version will still lacl the performance of the ps4 and PC.
pcars,3dlh24,BigHowski,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:48:48 2015 UTC,"I know, I'd just prefer 30 fps and smooth than 60ish fps some of the time and jumpy. I'd also be happy to dump some of the looks to get that. Either way the post I replied to is wrong, we have games that can give wonderful graphics smoothly already on consoles and it's not unfeasible to think if you release a game on a platform you should make it render nicely"

I always find at least 30-40 lobbies ready to join, even at odd hours.   About the community, i don't think of it as an actual community. You join the lobby, race, and leave. That's all. Some people are really good drivers, some are really bad, and there are some trolls. The usual deal."
pcars,3din4e,PleaseBanShen,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:07:39 2015 UTC,"There are communities organized around racing. Many of them organize events in multiple games including pCars. Each community has its own set of rules with its own favored flavor of racing and require different levels of participation/committment.  I have found the vast majority of these are based in Europe. Very few in North America...and those that are based in NA are far less organized.  I am looking forward to engaging with a pretty informal group based in NA this coming weekend for my first ""organized"" online race.  The random public lobbies are usually a waste of time. I had one good ""Race"". Started fifth in a field of five as I joined late and was not able complete a quali lap. 3 of the 4 cars in front of me took each other out at the starting line and I spent the next 5 laps chasing down the remaining car after he pulled a ~15 second lead while I navigated the carnage at the start.  Caught him up but not with time to pull off a pass. He won by 0.3 seconds and I felt quite satisfied/entertained.  Done a dozen races since, all terrible. Carnage everywhere. If you don't start first, start last. Anything else and you''re fucked. Whacky settings for the races. Trolls camped at exits of blind corners.  And on and on. But mostly just terrible, terrible drivers. I started fifth (again) in a field of 15. 5 lap race. Literally raped at the start I had to pit on lap one for repairs. Finished 7th lmao."

pcars,3din4e,Skyphos,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:21:33 2015 UTC,"It's hit-&-miss. Sometimes you get lucky & land in an enjoyable pub lobby. Sometimes you get unlucky & land in a lobby loaded with lag and/or bugs/glitches and/or trolling rammers/wreckers.  It's great that the game has so many options to play the way you want to play, but that can also be a double-edged sword for lobbies because everybody wants lobby settings that restrict the options to only those that they prefer, which can make finding a lobby and/or league that you like (while also available in your time zone during your free time) a big roll-of-the-dice."
pcars,3din4e,1Operator,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:53:38 2015 UTC,"Maybe I had no luck, but after around 25 tries to race online I gave up. Most lobbies are p2p based, so a lot of people have serious lags. 70% per cent of the field can't drive at all, so there are constant wrecks. I am also a victim of ""can't drive"" bug, so I couldn't join qualifications for most of these tries and was locked in bumper cam for the race. But there is kind of a lot of people to ""race"" with, so if you care only about full lobbies then go ahead!"
pcars,3din4e,ironweed,0,Thu Jul 16 16:36:20 2015 UTC,"I have actually had a good bit of luck with the MP. Even have one a race or two. The key is to either quality in the top 5, or just hang back for the first few corners and let the wreckers wreck. Seems to work pretty well.  I haven't seen too many issues with lag either. Admittedly, I haven't played too many times in MP, maybe 20. I usually play GSCE. Much better game IMO."
pcars,3di34i,backpain4,5,Thu Jul 16 13:22:30 2015 UTC,"Does anyone else here find it a little bit bothersome that Jim Clark, who can be argued as one of the greatest drivers to ever live, and also the man who holds the fastest lap around Nurburgring in a Lotus 49, only did an 8:04:1 around the green hell.  Times didn't dip under 8 minutes in formula 1 until 1969 when Icks set the fastest lap during the race and put his Brabham on pole both times being in the 7:40's.  The first car to set a lap around there close to the time in this video was a Ferrari 312 in the 1970's.  Those were a lot faster than the Type 49, and also actually generated some downforce.    My initial impression of the 49 in pCars is that it's really a terrible model due to the physics.  It sticks way too well, doesn't push understeer as much as it should, and this video and time are really representative of the problem here.  This car should be hard to get under 8 minutes, and to take 59 seconds out of the time that Jim Clark set with the car for real is disappointing to see.  Just not an accurate simulation at all in this case."

Jim Clark's last German GP was in '67, during which cars were running treaded tyres.   Personally, I've found that I can run Brands Hatch GP at a fairly consistant 1:28.0 on '74 slicks and 1:37.0 on '67 Treads. Equate this to the lap here and 7:05 becomes 7:44 if he were using '67s. Add the straight and hairpin that existed in the GP course at the time which (if we consider rFactor to be vaguely correct) takes about 30-40 seconds round and you get an adjusted time of about 8:20."
pcars,3di34i,redsaltire,2,Thu Jul 16 17:44:49 2015 UTC,"Nope, didn't pay attention to the fact that he was running slicks on a car that never ran on slicks in real life.  I'll accept your adjustment though.  The math checks out pretty well, and I was assuming roughly 30 seconds based on both my own rFactor experiences as well as a bit of basic math calculating the distance and average speed in that section.    An adjusted time of 8:20 is about 6 seconds slower than I run it in a 49 on Assetto Corsa the last time I did it."
pcars,3di34i,rexanimate7,3,Thu Jul 16 18:18:29 2015 UTC,In 1967 Nurburgring layout there is an extra section of track (where the modern F1 track is). Maybe thats where the extra seconds come from.
pcars,3di34i,Snooze_Light,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:29:17 2015 UTC,"I recognize that that section is there.  It was until 1982, and it incorporates the length of the current Nurburgring GP track pit straight, a hairpin, and back again, which is laid out roughly the same way that the cars enter back to the GP grack in the current endurance layout.  We're talking a difference of 2 Km of straight away, and that would take place during the fastest portion of the lap being that it follows the long straight where the tourist entrance is for public access.    That section should not account for 59 seconds difference in lap time.  A real lotus 49 was capable of over 180 mph, and that section would be up around that top speed for half of it.  The difference should be roughly half of less.  Granted, it's pretty well known at this point that a hot lap around nurburgring in pCars is normally significantly faster than AC or rFactor as is.  It just seems like it is awfully fast in the 49, and this game has that car being way easier to drive with way more grip than any other sim I've driven one on."
pcars,3di34i,rexanimate7,2,Thu Jul 16 17:12:45 2015 UTC,"accurate simulation or not, Jim Clark had common sense and self preservation.  Video games allow us to do away with both. I'm sure to achieve this very fast lap the user on the video ""died"" 1000x before this lap.  I disagree with all of your sentiments about Pcars physics being terrible.  What are you even basing it off of?  A preconceived notion of how it should be, not how something is."
pcars,3di34i,Shadylurker,0,Thu Jul 16 18:04:18 2015 UTC,"I disagree with all of your sentiments about Pcars physics being terrible.   This car sticks better in pCars than it ever did in real life, and better than it does in any other simulator it has been in.  That was all that statement meant.   Regarding Clark's self preservation... lets keep in mind that he died driving a 49, and lets also keep in mind how ridiculously fast he was in comparison to the other drivers in F1 at the time.  Whatever sense of self preservation you think he had is likely lower than you are assuming being likely a normal person that would shit themselves driving the cars he did anywhere near as fast as he did.  It's amazing the guy was as fast as he was carrying the giant brass balls he had on him.  Even in cars that I have driven around real tracks, and in rFactor, iRacing, or AC (barring the GT2 cars and fuck optimal conditions) generally produce lap times in the other simulators that are more similar to reality, pCars generally gives you the benefit of a slightly faster lap with most of the cars because there is generally more grip in pCars than the others when the track is dry.  You can disagree as much as you want, that's fine by me.  I base my opinion of how this game handles with a direct comparison to reality, as well as in all of the other simulators available to consumers.  It also doesn't help that the Nordschleife version in pCars and also the ones available for rFactor generally tend to be smoother than it really is, and a lot of the turns don't have the exact same camber as they do in reality, which does make them easier to navigate quickly.  Lets not pretend that this game is completely real, because it isn't.  Not like I'm not still playing it just like the rest of you guys."
pcars,3di34i,rexanimate7,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:30:16 2015 UTC,"Uh unless it has changed in the last couple of weeks, the lap times of something like pole on Watkins glen in a GT3 and Iracing GT3 are within hundredths of seconds."
pcars,3di34i,Shadylurker,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:30:28 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure that varies car to car.  It's not an indictment of the entire engine or the game at all, much like the BMW and Ferrari GT2 cars are faster and stick better than they should in AC, some cars, definitely including the 49 stick better than they should in pCars.  None of the current sims are absolutely perfect, but it's a good thing that we have a handful of viable simulators at this point."
pcars,3di34i,rexanimate7,2,Thu Jul 16 19:33:21 2015 UTC,"Great video, It's an amazing experience when in the 49 and and the nord. post more i enjoyed watching  on Rex topic I'd agree, it seems we live in a time where devs think we like a game because we are good at it. Specially when it is developed in conjunction with consoless, as a lot players are instant gratification generation. How many videos do you see in 3rd person, with the drive line on(if you don't know the track you should be a long way from competing in a race) and people using controllers(i don't know how torque feedback is relayed with a controller). I'm not against any of this. it is a game and it's a really good game. For a sport, I respect the driving/riding gods more as I've had a taste on the track in race cars and race bikes. That experience gives me such a respect for the sport and a desire to learn more just based on how incrediable these people are. Though this is a very difficult scenario to set out for a player when you want them to love your game from first playing it. I'm not taking anything away for people skills, though it's a slight comedic play we believe the historic champions of the sport we all remember compares to a 9yr that beats their WR by 5secs with a ps4 controller.  Just my useless opinion, but I believe it discredits the devs massively in understanding what sport is about."
pcars,3dho35,CannedEther,9,Thu Jul 16 10:26:34 2015 UTC,It's to mimic endurance style series where there is an overall winner and a class winner but as far as I'm aware the game doesn't allow for anything other than an overall win.
pcars,3dho35,Ghengiscone,9,Thu Jul 16 10:55:23 2015 UTC,Well they should sort that out shouldn't they.
pcars,3dho35,MeMuzzta,3,Thu Jul 16 14:24:58 2015 UTC,Add it to the list
pcars,3dho35,BigHowski,5,Thu Jul 16 19:57:28 2015 UTC,More like add it to the pile.
pcars,3dho35,MeMuzzta,3,Thu Jul 16 20:11:50 2015 UTC,It does allow class wins. I did the 24 hours of Le Mans race in career mode (shortened considerably) in a GT3 car and it only showed my results relative to other GT3 cars. Meanwhile I was getting lapped by the prototypes.
pcars,3dho35,missiletest,4,Thu Jul 16 16:21:18 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's in the career mode. I think the problem is that we don't have the ability to create those events in race weekends or online."
pcars,3dho35,klorptar,8,Thu Jul 16 23:35:19 2015 UTC,"It mostly just adds a different challenge for drivers and teams. Also, most multi class races are endurance races. It isn't really practical to run a 24 hour race for LMPs, then another for GT3 and all the other classes.  Edit: that's why it exists in real life, anyway. It's in the game just because its a cool thing that happens in real life."
pcars,3dho35,rokthemonkey,2,Thu Jul 16 10:57:27 2015 UTC,In the real world those classes are scored separately. A GT3 car is not racing a LMP1 car for points or position.  In the game outside of career mod this is not true.  Sure you can simulate the look of multi class racing but the cars are all racing for position and points.  this is something t you would have thought wouldn't ha e been overlooked but it was
pcars,3dho35,nomnamless,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:42:18 2015 UTC,"It's really simple. Just take the results, and compare yourself with the other cars in your class. Even use a scratchpad if you want. Voila, your own class scoring."
pcars,3dho35,fleaver12,2,Fri Jul 17 00:14:44 2015 UTC,Well yea of course there are ways of keeping track.  Some people care about states and achievement.  In the current set up racing a GT car makes impossible to get a win in multi class racing and that will hurt your stats.  Either way a game that is suppose to be about racing made by racers should not have over looked something as simple as multi class racing
pcars,3dho35,nomnamless,4,Fri Jul 17 00:22:37 2015 UTC,"On top of what the other posters said: Imagine you have a race with one clear cut top dog. The race could be pretty boring, until he starts lapping the backmarkers. The added traffic slows him down more than it slows down the guy in 2nd, allowing the guy in 2nd, 3rd etc... to catch up.  In multiclass races, the traffic isn't reserved to backmarkers near the end of the race, drivers always have to navigate a field of slower cars, which in turn makes for a closer field and more exciting racing! That last bit is a matter of opinion, but I certainly find it more fun to watch when 1-2-3-4 place are closer to one another.  This doesn't really explain why there are multiclass races, but it kind of demonstrates why they're cool."
pcars,3dho35,SGNick,3,Thu Jul 16 11:06:57 2015 UTC,"Because it's a motorsports game, and multi-class racing is a pretty common thing in motorsports.  As for why it exists period, well, it makes things more interesting and sports are about entertainment. The 24 Hours of Le Mans would be kind of boring if it was just prototypes or just GT cars. Why only watch one race when you can watch 4 at the same time?"
pcars,3dho35,-H-E-L-I-X-,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:05:04 2015 UTC,"If It were just GTE cars, it might be still damn good.  The battle amongst the factory teams is pretty much 24 hours between a handful of cars split by seconds...  Never mind if they had more budget because of no LMP1-H...  But of course multi class is almost always a great choice bringing the most entertainment possible."

When i do this (keep in mind that there are very few night races online), it's always before a hard brake, such as the chicane in Spa. Turn lights off, brake later than him, come ahead.  I understand where you're coming from, but i can guarantee I've never ruined anybody's race doing this. Furthermore, i tend to lose positions due to putting safety before coming out ahead. Apologies if i wasn't clear, i like to take things in the most humorous possible way."
pcars,3dc9p7,Rhombohedron,5,Wed Jul 15 03:39:50 2015 UTC,"I REALLY wish they would separate the leaderboards by cars. 8 really hate that they are organised by class. Wanna know if your the fastest in a Sierra cosworth? Tough. Fancy being the fastest in a Caterham 7? Tough. Wondering how you stack up to other drivers in the clip cup? Tough. It reduces the amount of cats you can actually drive in a time trial by a massive degree. There's essentially one competitive car per class. If you look at open wheel for instance they are excluding formula rookie, formula b and formula c, historic formula a and I'm pretty sure another class, because formula a is the fastest. How the can expect us to face formula rookie cars against formula a cars I will never know."

pcars,3dc9p7,tom6561,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:21:10 2015 UTC,"It's pretty much hairy everywhere. The trickiest part about this car is the explosive power delivery. In order to get a fast run out of corners, you have to get on the throttle early midcorner to keep the RPM high enough for the turbo to deliver power when you need it. If you overdo it however, then the turbo will kick in unexpectedly and you'll very quickly end up with the front pointing in the wrong direction. It also doesn't help that the Nordschleife has really long straights requiring diabolically low downforce to achieve the fastest times."

pcars,3d742r,dmayan,2,Tue Jul 14 05:10:04 2015 UTC,I've seen this happen more than a few times. :(
pcars,3d742r,lookoutblorgons,2,Tue Jul 14 05:41:22 2015 UTC,soon as i noticed the track i new exactly the spot that would be. good driving. frustrating result.
pcars,3d742r,DrFunkyStuff,3,Tue Jul 14 06:31:50 2015 UTC,It's almost as if the developers want you to use the run-off area (which really should have a 'cut track' penalty).
pcars,3d742r,PancakeMSTR,1 point,Tue Jul 14 07:18:38 2015 UTC,yes it's like they over did the left side of the chicane and expect you to go wide to the right. really strange. I'd love to see a visual boundary on some of these tracks.
pcars,3d742r,PancakeMSTR,2,Tue Jul 14 07:25:12 2015 UTC,Robbed after a good recovery.
pcars,3d742r,NorcalHPDE,4,Tue Jul 14 06:55:44 2015 UTC,Thats why I left driving with Pcars. It made me sick that you get penalties for touching the grass or putting one wheel outside the track.
pcars,3d86wu,whateverdaheva,7,Tue Jul 14 07:07:26 2015 UTC,It should only happen in the latter parts of the circuit. It's so you don't cut a final corner for example and get additional speed down a straight that would give you an unfair advantage on your next lap.
pcars,3d86wu,budgetpharmaceutical,3,Tue Jul 14 07:23:51 2015 UTC,This is correct however it's ridiculous.  You can go off track 2-3 corners before the final corner and still have your next lap invalidated (which you'll gain no benefit from).
pcars,3d86wu,InsaneBirch,5,Tue Jul 14 10:52:17 2015 UTC,"Try Le Mans - you'll get the ""next lap invalidated"" penalty for going wide in the Porsche curves... with almost 2 km left to the finish line."

I won and he was pissed off in last place and started ramming every car, including charging at me every time I raced around.

With the 270X I have to play with everything on Low except textures, car detail and track detail to get an acceptable framerate (i.e. to keep it above 50 or so at all times). On the GTX 760 I have everything on High and it's still got a higher FPS.  That said, it is still perfectly playable on the 270X and the game still looks very good even on lower settings. The trouble I have is more with the disparity between average and minimum framerates than anything else. Most of the time I'm hitting over 100+ fps in clear weather when there aren't too many other cars on screen, but I have to keep these low settings to accommodate the times where it's raining and there are 30 cars on screen which causes the framerate to drop dramatically.  Windows 10 performance looks promising as well, people with the preview W10 get about 20% better framerate. So I'm looking forward to that at the end of this month."

I was also seeing about 45 fps stable pushing the resolution up to 7680x1440 and running with VSR turned on in the 15.7 drivers.  Certainly isn't too bad, and I would have returned the game when I got it on sale if the AMD performance was still garbage.    The force feedback was more of a deal breaker by the time I got the game, but thankfully the tweaker files have helped that a little bit.

Track detail seems to be the biggest killer for me, gotta set it to low or else I start losing 5-10 frames per higher setting.  With 1 or 2 cars on the track I get about 40-60 fps. When there's more or it's a graphically challenging course I can dip down to 25-30 fps.  When the race starts and it's a full grid? Probably sub 10 fps.  So most of the time it's fine, especially solo. Sometimes it's horrid. It's better than it was at launch when one car on the screen would cause my fps to dip below 10.

Hard tyres have less grip but more durability. At the minute tyre wear is too low across the board so softs actually last much too long, I believe this is something they're looking at.  You would use the hard tyres to do longer stints on tyre-intensive tracks. Monza doesn't have particularly high degradation so there's no point there. When the tyre wear is patched this will be more of a factor but as it stands there's not really any reason to use anything but the softs at all times."

pcars,3d1njn,fleaver12,2,Mon Jul 13 12:04:21 2015 UTC,"I agree with the others stating that you should be using softs.  Regardless, no compound should be 'gone after just a few laps'. Something else was happening. How do you know the tires were worn? The game doesn't tell you at all. Does 'gone' mean that the indicator was showing red or blue? If so, that is tire temperature, not wear.  I would double-check the pressure that you put into your new set of tires. It does not automatically put the same pressure in that you saved in your tune.  One last thing, hard compound tires should be more difficult to keep up to temperature, especially at a track like Monza. It is entirely possible that they simply cooled off within a few laps, and that is what you experienced."

Depending on the car and how aggressive you drive your car should used between 2-5 liters per round (on spa). i drove 60 liters with the M3 and made it back to pit with 1,5liters left ^ slightly miscalculation on my side, usually i have 5 liters in it for safety margin, hadn't switched from qualy setup to race setup, which brought a whole new set of problems with it, wasn't made to carry 60 liters it's made for 15 tops ^ but yeah for a first race it was ok for everybody i guess we all learned a good thing and I'm sure the same errors won't be done again :)  So now don't be angry with yourself go to the Nuerburgring GP and start practicing and tuning for the second race in 2 weeks :)"

In that case the track isn't wet enough for the compound you're using, and you'll get overheating. The only other causes would be low tire pressures or sliding/wheel spin, as mentioned by the other poster.  If it's not any of those, I think you've found yourself another bug!"

pcars,3cy162,avoiceoftreason,1 point,Sun Jul 12 11:38:35 2015 UTC,"So it's the drying track that's the problem? You can cool the tires by driving on the wet parts of the track.  That being said, it's possible that the conditions combine to create a situation where overheating is unavoidable. Then you either have to 'ride it out' or change tires."

Even though you can physically rotate your G27 more after it stops in-game, its not providing any more steering. A few games actually lock your wheel to the degrees of that car (same feeling as when you go all the way to the end of the 900 degrees, a physical stop), but those are usually arcade games for whatever reason.  You should check the ""let the game adjust settings"" box in the Logitech Profiler, though."

Instead if I go to far the wheel will give the most minimal push to try to stop me from going to far. This ""bump"" (it doesn't feel like anything maybe like a baby pulling on the wheel)  is definitely to weak as I turn to much every time. is this just the limitations of the hardware or the game, and is there a possible fix?"
pcars,3ctu58,InZomnia365,1 point,Fri Jul 10 22:23:19 2015 UTC,"Im not sure... Some games definitely do it better, but Ive never really been bothered by it. The only times you should ever get to that kind of lock (unless its a race car with super low lock) is when youve spun out anyway (inputting more steering when the car wont turn enough is counter-productive as youve already exceeded the grip level of the tires and should slow down or unwind the wheel a bit to regain grip)"
pcars,3ctu58,InZomnia365,2,Fri Jul 10 22:41:34 2015 UTC,"Fixed it. Reduced Tire force from reading the forum with the FFB settings. The wheel was so strong that when the ""bump happened"" it didn't feel like anything other than slightly more resistance now I see what you mean and it's great."

While having a strong FFB is cool initially, a lot of the feedback will be lost or ignored if your wheel is already throwing out max force (say youre in a corner, your wheel is at max force, you wont feel a bump in the road etc). So having a weaker FFB isnt always as exciting, but it does make it easier."

pcars,3cqr6g,Associat0r,5,Fri Jul 10 03:50:47 2015 UTC,"Best advice I've heard from someone (on this subreddit, I can't remember who though) was to imagine a string tied between the steering wheel and the brake pedal. If you brake all the way, there isn't much room to do steering and if you have full lock on steering isn't very efficient. Basically brake in a straight line and then turn in to the corner, making the exit just as important as the exit. Also, when attacking a quick series of corners, the exit of the last one is always the most important so compromising the entrance of the first corner of the complex to get a better exit may actually be faster.  Other than that, just get out on track and push yourself, finding the limit of the car."

pcars,3cmoel,JohnDoesuf,2,Thu Jul 9 02:31:48 2015 UTC,I think June is the only month that you do not get a free car. It was a mistake due to a badly designed chart telling the game's monthly content till next year.  SMS really needs to work on their PR.

pcars,3cmoel,Ilikeyoubignose,-1,Thu Jul 9 02:41:02 2015 UTC,"Because they lied to us. As simple as that... They waited until the last hours of the month to finally tell everyone that they never planned on releasing a car last month.

That is well after a month after they said that every month, including May and June, we would get a free car."

Major issue, if you drop lower than 75fps it v-synchs you to 37fps.  Its some kind of but and expected to be fixed.  Doesn't really affect my 970 but is a major issue for some.  I Race in the rift every night in PCars.  Loving it.  I think my driving is getting better than on the screen as I spot the apex and exit much better now.  Online is really good (although a bit ""bumpier"" than AC) and in the rift it is super intense.    There are more improvements for rift integration coming in the next patch too."

And it starts again once you enter next race. This is fine for me as I like to take it off after a sweaty race.   Direct works immediately and is such a draw to the game. I just sit down, start from steam and place rift on and it simply works.   Low latency is fantastic. Just turn down all settings and turn them back on until you start to get frame issues.   If you fancy some rift racing add me on steam: browneuk7"
pcars,3ckrlp,dakuth,2,Wed Jul 8 18:39:19 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I raced on the monitor until I upgraded, and now race in direct-mode rift.  It's a pretty good implementation of VR, but could stand to improve in some areas:   Performance takes a big hit. This is normal for VR games, but it can be pretty excessively hard to get it up to 75fps consistantly. I mean - it's annoying that it is nice and smooth in some areas, then others (such as near crowds) drops it down to around 30. So, some detail settings I have lower than I'd like simply to cover those edge cases, which is a shame Menu screens. Because they're plastered to your face, that not very navigable. What I've found, though, is that the menus and in-game HUD appear on my monitor ... so if I need to navigate, I lift up the rift and just navigate on my monitor. No big deal. Scale. There's something a little off... I first noticed it because some of the cockpits seemed surprisingly cramps. Perhaps they're just cramped cars? But if you stand up, and walk around your car, your head comes to just above the roof, and it your (invisible) legs feel like they're cut off at the knees. The road seems WAY too close . It's weird... but you don't really notice it when you're in the car. I just can't help but wonder if I'm missing out on amazing presence feelings because the scale is off. HUD. It's strapped to your head, so you can't turn to have a look at the numbers. You can edit the HUD, but you only have a limited number of locations to put the different HUD elements, and if you choose anything but one practically right in the centre-bottom or centre-top, you can't see them, and you can't turn your head to look at them. There's a couple possible ways for WMD to solve this, but until they do, the HUD is of limited use. Where your head ""recenters"" to is, I find, quite often a few cms off. This boils down to, most likely, the camera view point being placed right in the centre of the head, and then swivels on the point. Rather than the more realistic approach iRacing takes which is to place the view point on the edge of your virtual head, and have to rotate around a sphere. They call it a ""neck model"". This leads to (in pCars) when you look down, you see the inside of your chest, and when you look left/right you often clip into the seat. I mitigate this to a good level of satisfaction by adjusting my in-game seat, and also schootching forward a bit after re-centering. I also use this to match the in-game hands to my RL hands but raising the Rift up and down until the two hands match exactly ... this isn't always possible because you can only move in-game seats around so much, and it depends on your setup, but when you get it right it's pretty damn impressive. When you're in VR, you discover that the collision models are ever so slightly bigger than the cars ... so you'll bump an opponent (most noticeable in carts) a few cms before you visually touch them. Animations, understandably, happen after the fact. e.g. you shift gears, and like, I've ALREADY moved my RL gear stick, when the in-game avatar does it as soon as the game detects a gear change. This is nit-picky, I know, but this and a few other mis-matching breaks presence, unfortunately."

Personally I prefer working a car that does not have 1000 horsepower.  With that much power, you barely step on the gas and the back end is sliding out.  With lower-tier cars, it becomes much more important to preserve every MPH possible when cornering, etc.  That feeling of slowly overtaking someone due to a rather small edge in your driving.  Which doesn't happen with ultrasupercars because everybody is on a knife-edge."

pcars,3cgxog,lookoutblorgons,1 point,Wed Jul 8 07:10:55 2015 UTC,Yeah I dunno about those. I think some of them drive into the pit lane at the end of the lap (it's a shortcut because you pass the finish line without going through the last few turns). My best is in the high 31s I think.

pcars,3cihm1,daBandersnatch,11,Wed Jul 8 04:13:32 2015 UTC,"There are no upgrades in pCARS because that was never the intent of the game. It was build to replicate more or less how real motorsports works.   Also, the upgrade system in pretty much every racing game in bullshit. Its illusion of choice. There is always a best set of upgrades."
pcars,3cihm1,NeilJHopwood,3,Wed Jul 8 04:43:35 2015 UTC,"You like a specific type of racing game, like many different people as well.  Customization and upgrading your cars as you progress through a game is fun!  It's rewarding!  It's... also a mechanic of game development to keep people playing.  It makes you always seek something, ""more.""  You always want that next upgrade, etc.  That's perfectly fine for a specific type of game.  A non-simulation.  pCARS is not that game.  It never set out to be that type of game.  What you are wanting, is not what this game is.  pCARS did not set out to be the next customizable racing game.  There are a handful out there that already fill those roles.  The shift series like you say, and of course the big dogs, GT/Forza.  The problem you are seeing with pCARS, is that you want this customization, but it isnt offered.  Well, pCARS focus and aim was to be a sim.  It's goal was to create a realistic driving experience.  Replicating real life racing.  Of course, it can easily be argued whether that succeeded, but the premise of the game was always known.  By definition, a simulation cannot be a sim, if it, well... doesnt simulate.  If pCARS had cusomization, it wouldnt be a sim.  Adding those fantasy upgrade parts isnt realistic.  You cant just turn a mazda miata into a gt3/prototype race car without having an entirely different car.  Upgrades and that sort of customization isnt part of sims, because it doesnt simulate anything.  Now, I agree it's a plenty fun game mechanic, but that type of game serves a different purpose than a racing simulation.  Will that sort of feature be in pCARS 2?  Id say easily no.  Will any other sim implement something like that in the future?  Id also say probably no.  It's just not a part of sim-racing.  For some people, that is obviously a shame, because they want the realistic physics and handling, with the GT/Forza path of upgrading your car throughout the game.    Beyond that though, you probably wont hear too many favorable responses from the pCARS devs, since this isnt their focus for the game, nor the sim community, since sim-racing isnt about upgrading your cars.  It's about using the same car, on the same track, to eek out that extra thousandth of a second to improve your personal best.  :p  Cheers"

That's not a negative, on Forza's part.  There's no harm in being aesthetically pleasing and it gives something to share/discuss.  It's hard to have a whole lot of discussion about a racing game because basically strategy is ""learn the car and track and to go as fast as you can."" It's not like other genres where we can discuss how to collect such-and-such collectible, how you're having trouble defeating a boss, or what's the best combination of weapons to take on your assault of this enemy stronghold.  Project CARS boards have generally had some common topics, but unfortunately they've been about bugs and disappointments, which goes without saying to be a bad thing.

I'm a driving hobbiest and I'm very picky with handling and it suits me just perfect. The bugs are annoying though.   F1 2015 - that's just for lols really.

pcars,3ca9b7,Carstones,1 point,Tue Jul 7 13:59:02 2015 UTC,"I haven't tried F1 2015, but I recommend getting both Project Cars and Assetto Corsa. Those two games complement each other perfectly in terms of content and focus. PCars: eyecandy, good lemans / carting experience not to mention weather. Assetto corsa, more focus on realism (laser scanned tracks), currently better stability and a good modding community. The mods make Assetto Corsa a very good and versatile Formula 1 simulator, you can find most tracks as mods, and physics simulation will be better than F1 2015 (from what I have read, I haven't tried and after what codemasters have done with the new Dirt Rally, I wouldn't put it past them to get F1 right as well...). Perhaps you do need AC, Pcars, F1 2015, Dirt Rally and why not get an iRacing subscription while you are at it :-) That's what I've done anyway. Can't choose? get one of each!"
pcars,3ca9b7,lookoutblorgons,5,Mon Jul 6 09:57:18 2015 UTC,"I'm gonna have to disagree on AC being a decent F1 simulator, its aero simulation is one of its weakest aspects so open wheel cars are not very good in AC at all. The last I heard it didn't even simulate front wing aero AT ALL and I don't think that has changed. And it definitely doesn't simulate brake temperature which is very important in F1.  The best F1 simulator in terms of accuracy is undoubtedly rFactor2."

I know it's not as faithful to F1 (licenses, DRS etc) but in terms of actual driving, I think it's so much better. There are a fair few issues with pCars but definitely worth the money.  Then again they are meant to have got a new game engine for the new F1 game but I'm less than hopeful..."
pcars,3ca9b7,doctaj5,1 point,Mon Jul 6 10:31:44 2015 UTC,Rfactor 2 is the best by far.  Followed by pcars then Aseetto Corsa  for F1 content. Unless there are some crazy sweeping changes (afaik their isn't) then F1 2015 will suck just like the rest of the codemasters F1 games.

There is only one dry slick tyre compound which greatly limits the strategy element of longer races.  There are no DRS rules implemented so it's usable by all cars at all times which makes it essentially pointless.  There aren't very many F1 tracks in the game (5 or 6 I think) and most of the others just aren't suitable for F1 racing, they're mostly too short or too narrow."

Now watch the telemetry with manual and clutch. When you change gear and release the clutch button it slowly disengages over a second or more meaning you red line and gradually come down as it nears fully disengaging.   I have no idea why this happens with manual clutch on a controller. Possible bug or just a feature for wheels and pedals?

pcars,3c7wfu,ProfessorMembrane,16,Sun Jul 5 18:57:22 2015 UTC,"Glad to see you decided to get a ""proper"" wheel. Enjoy your driving!  As for your second question:  It's hard to summarize even just the basics of (sim-)racing in a single post. Moving a car at the very limit is a pretty non-trivial thing after all.  I'll try to keep it brief and give pointers for further reading.  [edit]: scratch the ""brief"" part.. this has gotten quite long, while still only scratching the surface. Prepare for a massive Wall Of Text.. You, sir, have just chosen a life-long learning process as your new hobby. Enjoy! :)   Please note: many of these points will be generalizations. To every ""rule"", there is at least one exception. Don't worry about them for now, you will naturally learn those over time. If it takes a hundred trips to the gravel trap, so be it - be glad it's only virtual, and going over the limit doesn't prematurely end your contract (or your life).   Seeing the stuff you mentioned about FPS games, it seems you go about it in a rather serious/professional manner. That's an excellent basis for picking up motor-racing of any kind. Good focus and the ability to concentrate (hard) are pretty much a basic requirement, as are mental and physical stamina. Consistency > Speed, unless you're going for a single-lap time attack.  BASIC BASICS   Most importantly: remember to have fun!  Keep it simple, don't try to do too much at once until certain skills become second nature. Start with the basics, then work your way up to advanced techniques. Keep at it. You will improve, and so will your lap times (lap times aren't everything though - especially as a beginner, paying too much attention to them can hurt you more than help your progress). Your tyres are the only part of your car that actually touches the road. That means you are only connected to the tarmac via four hand-sized patches of rubber. Be mindful of the grip limits different types of tyres have. Ignoring rubber compounds, the bigger the contact patch, the more grip a tyre will provide. You can use this ""grip budget"" for accelerating, decelerating or cornering. If your car control is good enough, you can even mix those things. They do, however, add up. If you exceed the amount of grip you have at your disposal, you might not like the consequences. A sliding tyre does not provide grip. If you just stomp on the brakes and jerk the wheel to try and get around a corner, you will find yourself sliding straight off the track. A good beginner's tip is to imagine a string tied between your steering wheel and your throttle/brake pedals. If you turn the wheel all the way, the string will be tight, not allowing you to push the pedals a lot. If your wheel is straight, there will be slack, allowing full pedal travel. At the beginning, change either speed or direction. Brake, turn, accelerate. Once you can do all this without thinking, you can start mixing these things, going for those smooth transitions you actually want. Once you reach this stage, read up on ""trail braking"" and other advanced driving techniques. Don't try to ""wrestle"" your car into submission. Avoid being too jerky with your steering/throttle/brake inputs. As strange as this sounds, you'll have to be firm and gentle at the same time. Resist the temptation to drive harder in an attempt to go quicker. Smoother = Faster. Be aware of a little thing called ""weight transfer"". While you change your speed/heading, your car's weight will shift around, putting more (or less) weight on the front/rear/left/right tyres. This means that certain tyres will have more grip (as they are being pushed into the ground more) while others will have less. Braking too hard may make your car nose-dive - while this improves grip at the front, which you will want for cornering, it might decrease the grip in the rear to such an extent that your rear starts sliding, possibly leading to a spin. Braking too softly will mean you won't be slowing down as much as possible, effectively wasting time. Keep your hands on the wheel as much as possible. Go for 9 and 3 o'clock positions. No wheel shuffling. Note: this considers the ""normal"" steering setup of racing cars. Road cars have much larger ""lock-to-lock"" angles. Play around with the settings until you find a comfortable lock-to-lock setting that allows for precise control while not forcing you to leave the 3-and-9 hand positions. 360° should be a good starting point for racing.    SETTING UP   Note: some of the following points are my personal preference, but may help you as well. Find a comfortable camera view that works for you and stick to it. This will be your first step to being consistent. Use whatever feels good for you. Don't let anybody tell you that ""for a real sim, you can only drive in cockpit view"". That's bullshit. In real life, you have three-dimensional vision. A two-dimensional image with interior/pillars blocking most of your view isn't necessarily ""more realistic"".  Keep distractions to a minimum. Having too much information on the screen can hurt your driving. Do you really need the timing board on-screen at all times? Keep experimenting with your HUD settings and see what level of information feels comfortable to you. Don't rely on ""cheats"" like too many driving aids or the visual racing line. These program you to react to certain stimuli instead of teaching you how to drive properly. Do what you must to keep it on the track, but keep in mind that less may be more here. Trust your gut more than your eyes. (This goes hand in hand with the above points) Keep yourself from glancing at the rev counter/speedo all the time. The numbers don't matter. Get a feel for it. Turn the gauges off completely for a test, see how it goes. Many real-life racing cars have no speed indicator because it simply isn't needed. This may not be viable until you become better at judging speeds/distances, but it sure is worth a try. Set up your FOV in such a way that you can maximize your car control at all times. A higher FOV may help with the perception of speed (which is what I did when I first started driving sims). This may help you at first, until you get a feel for your speed without it. Once you reach that stage, I advise you to lower your FOV, as a narrower field of view gives you much more information on lateral changes during cornering. ""Every idiot can drive fast in a straight line. The corners seperate the boys from the men."" ;)"
pcars,3c7wfu,misterX-,14,Mon Jul 6 02:29:06 2015 UTC,"With these basic pointers out of the way, let's get started.  GETTING TO GRIPS WITH DRIVING (pun semi-intended)  Sticking with your FPS example for an introduction:  Learning gun spray patterns would equate to learning vehicle dynamics.   How does a car react in certain situations? Which conditions can change the behaviour?   Learning maps would obviously be track knowledge.    What's the basic layout?  How should each corner be attacked? (More on this later) Where are the little bumps and dips that can throw you off? Which curbs can be cut, which ones should be avoided?   Learning class differences is.. well.. pretty much the same in racing. :)   Different types of cars (Karts, Road cars, Racing cars, Open-wheelers, ...) may require very different driving styles. A car's drivetrain layout will have the second biggest impact on general vehicle dynamics, requiring you to adapt your driving accordingly.  Rule of thumb: FWD understeers (car wants to turn less / pushes outwards during cornering), RWD oversteers (car wants to turn more / turns its nose inwards), AWD should(!) be neutral but can be set up to drive like any of the above.   Ok - with that out of the way:  LEARNING ""FAST""  As /u/Rhombohedron has pointed out, the ""Speed Secrets"" books are an excellent source of information, ranging from basic to (highly) advanced. Apart from that, for most of these things, Google really is your best friend.   Learn about basic vehicle dynamics. Get a feel for the type of car/drivetrain you like best and start practising with those. Your preferences will most likely change over time, and as your skills increase. Low-powered FWD cars usually are a good place to start, as they are easier to predict/handle for beginners. Your first step after that should be to learn about the racing line and ""out-in-out"". If you understand the logic behind it, why it usually is the fastest way to clear a corner - and how to achieve it - you're already well on your way to becoming a quick (racing) driver. Not all corners are created equal. Learn about ""Slow-in-fast-out"" and ""Fast-in-slow-out"" and when each of these concepts is appropriate. Short version: Fast-in-slow-out if a corner is followed by another corner. Slow-in-fast-out if the corner is followed by a straight. Try to attack corners in such a way that you can straighten up your wheel and get back on the throttle as soon as possible, to achieve the highest possible exit speed without compromising your entry or cornering speeds too much. You'll want to get the ""best average"" over a whole lap. When confronted with a combination of corners (usually hardest to master, not only for beginners) try to think backwards from the last corner of that particular combination. You may have to deviate from the ""classic school of cornering"" to ideally navigate a combination of consecutive corners. Adjust your entry of the first corner bit by bit, until you can clear the whole combination with the best possible exit speed. Practise your cornering while learning the tracks. Stick to a single (short/simple) track at first if necessary, as that will allow you to track your progress more easily. However, feel free to experiment. Changing it up from time to time (even while training a single car/track combo) can be a great way to improve even further by applying your new insights in different situations. Our brain is awesome at inter-/extrapolating, make good use of this fact. Every experience you collect helps you grow. Setting up a car is a daunting task. Keep it simple at first, ignore  setups completely if you have to. Once you get a feel for ""what you're doing"" at the wheel, you should start off by trying other people's settings. See which ones feel good and take note of the differences in vehicle behaviour. Learn about what each setting does, even if only on a very broad basis. One important aspect you should always keep in mind: with car tuning, everything is a trade-off. There are no ""pure improvements"", only ""better compromises"". Once you have at least a basic understanding of how certain settings affect each aspect of your car, compare different setups and start experimenting with your own adjustments. While each person is different, this approach made me go from ""I have no idea what I'm doing"" to ""this asymmetric setup needs 0.1° more toe-in on the front left"" - mind you, we're talking about 10+ years of learning here. Don't feel bad if it's all a big mystery to you at first. If you really can't get to grips with the details of fine-tuning your car over time, just use setups made by other people and go with what feels best to you. Sometimes, gut feeling > brain. However, at this stage, make sure to compare your times, because what feels faster doesn't necessarily have to be. One thing to note: there is a scary ""gap"" in cornering speeds between traditional ""mechanical"" grip and the grip provided by cars using lots of aerodynamic downforce. Once you reach a stage where you want to start driving these, keep in mind that aerodynamics only work while you're at speed. This may create absurd situations, where a corner will be ""just about"" possible at 180kph, impossible at 200, and possible again at 220+. If you're just starting out, you probably won't have to concern yourself with this for quite some time, but keep it in the back of your head for when you reach that stage and feel like you're hitting a wall (maybe quite literally)."
pcars,3c7wfu,misterX-,13,Mon Jul 6 02:30:48 2015 UTC,"RACING OTHER DRIVERS  Most of the above points have focused solely on your driving, and how to go faster while you're driving by yourself. However, in motor-racing, you'll naturally have to deal with other drivers and beat them to win. The winner, however, isn't always the fastest driver in the field.  These tips should (hopefully) help you in becoming a better pack racer.   Mix your solo training up with proper races regularly. AI will do for the basics, but if your long-term goal is racing online, give that a go from time to time as well during your training. Not only will this provide a good test of your newly learned techniques and skills, but also ""harden"" you for when stuff goes down on the track. Embrace the chaos that is motor-racing and learn to deal with it. Races are won at the finish. You cannot ""win"" a race at turn one, but you can easily throw it away right there. Once you get more confident in your abilities, stay back a bit at the start and let the idiots try to squeeze through T1 four abreast - then simply drive around the aftermath of the inevitable crash and start hunting down the survivors. There often is enough time to catch up once everything spreads out a bit. Patience goes a long way. While it may be tempting to overtake as many cars as possible as quickly as possible, it may not always be your best bet. The AI drivers don't care about you for the most part, and will take you out without any remorse. Same goes for (bad) online drivers, while good online drivers may naturally be hard to overtake. You don't have to dive at any opportunity - sometimes, building up pressure from behind and setting up a good overtaking spot can be the better option. This depends on the length of the race of course, but overtaking two corners from the finish line is always better than crashing out while fighting for the lead with 3 laps to go. If you have the time, study the guy in front while following, look for openings, then strike with a surprise attack when they least expect it and/or feel safe.  Train your spatial awareness. Configure your wheel's buttons so that you have easy access to the ""look left/right/behind"" commands and make good use of them. There is a lot of visual dead space where another car could be hiding. Try to maintain a mental image of your surroundings at all times by judging not just your movement, but the positions and movements of the drivers around you as well. This doesn't only help you with not crashing into others, but also in defending against attacking drivers much better (or simply avoiding that jerk trying to ram you off the track). Make other drivers work for you. You don't have to (and probably won't always be able to) beat everybody on pure driving skill alone. If you cannot get past a driver in front, pressuring him into making a mistake could mean the problem elegantly solves itself without the need for an aggressive (and potentially race-ending) move on your part. Show yourself in their mirrors, pull out to overtake, sell them fake moves, do whatever you must to make them care about you more than about their own driving. Once you break them, getting past will be easy. On the flip side, try not to get distracted by other drivers too much. Let them do their thing behind you and stick to your racing line unless you totally have to deviate. A blocking line will always be slower - you may accidentally hand them your position because you tried to defend it. Switch your on-screen rear view mirrors off and only use the look-around buttons on demand if that helps you maintain your concentration. A common ""beginner's mistake"" is to get distracted by a little movement in your mirrors just before the braking point. Showing no reaction to your enemy pressuring you can in turn make them grow impatient/mad. If you're lucky, they will make a stupid mistake without taking you out along with themselves. Be ""Alpha"". To be successful in racing, you need to be (to some extent) an alpha dog. Stick to your line, don't give them an inch, force your way to the front (without contact, please).. Just make it clear to everyone else out there that you're not to be trifled with. Having that certain ""presence"" out on track may be the edge you need to make the other guy back down just a little bit. When things get close in racing, ""that little bit"" may be all you need.    Please don't confuse this with ""being an asshole"". Great drivers like Ayrton Senna managed to be a ruthless monster on the track while still being an amazing human being at the same time. Going side by side with other drivers, for example, he'd start slowly moving towards the edge of the track, leaving you two choices: either you back down, or you have a crash. If you did the only sensible thing and backed down, he would've basically ""broken"" you psychologically as a driver. Mind you, that very same person stopped his car in the middle of a race to rush to another driver's help after a big accident.  Always try to keep it hard but fair. Nobody likes ""that asshole"" who crashes other people off the track to gain an advantage. Please don't become that guy. ;)  That's about all I can think of off the top of my head right now. If you have any specific questions, feel free to ask.  Some ""bonus"" tips and training exercises that may help you with mastering the basics:   Make good use of the training/time trial mode. This is probably self-explanatory, but it provides a good ""sandbox"" to try new techniques and experiment without the chaos of an actual race going on. Perform the ""race driver look"". No, that doesn't mean you should dress in a racing overall and helmet before playing the game. Keep your eyes fixed on where you want to go. Look ""further ahead"", not at the road in front your own hood. At corner entry, keep your eyes fixed on the apex. During cornering, look at the point where you want to exit the corner. Basically, look where you want your car to go, and it will go there. While training, try ""coasting"" through corners. Release the throttle way earlier than you would have to. Use as little braking as possible and only as much as absolutely necessary. This will serve two purposes at once. Firstly, it improves your general judgement of speed. You will get closer and closer to nailing the maximum cornering speed for each corner until it is so ingrained in your brain that you can go at the same speed while driving ""in anger"" without even thinking about it. Secondly, it teaches you the track you're doing it on. Start off slow and keep increasing your coasting speeds until you hit the limit.  Once you get the coasting down, work on your ""all-out"" driving by eliminating coasting as much as possible. Yeah, major plot-twist, I know.. ;) In racing, you basically want to be accelerating as much as possible, or decelerating as much as possible at all times. Everything in-between (save for advanced techniques like trail-braking (don't even bother with that until you feel 100% safe with normal braking!), driving powerful cars that require less-than-full throttle on corner exit, or saving fuel etc) is basically wasted time on a lap. Try the ""Initial D style one-handed suicide race"" approach. You don't have to tape one of your hands to the wheel for this like in the show, but the basic principle still applies. Try steering as little as possible without running out of road. The idea behind this is to teach you to keep your steering angles to a minimum. Cars have weight, weight at speed has momentum and hates changing direction more than anything else. Remember one of the first points I made: less steering input + smoother steering input = faster driving.

First you have to learn how to take corners properly, I learned watching these videos https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLx_tHjuVuROCLZ0sfTQCj0koZ1Fv6cNpM. He's very clear, right now the interactions with other racers are not covered, but they'll come soon.   As for the rain, it's an AI flaw. They basically don't lose grip as you do, the physics are different. Sure with the rain you should use a different setup, rising the downforce and moving the brake balance to the rear if you're experiencing understeer. Rising throttle sensitivity and trying to dose the acceleration is also a good thing to do."
pcars,3c7wfu,1Operator,3,Sun Jul 5 19:55:06 2015 UTC,"2) Know the track, this is the biggest of them all really. Practice on every lap many times to improve your knowledge of them so even in practice laps in online sessions you already have a fairly good idea of the track.    In racing, especially online, be patient, its not an arcade race game. Don't try to ram everyone in your way and don't try to get from 20th to 5th in  the first corner. Especially online patients is virtue, have a clean calm race and you'll likely end up high in the rankings cause many others will spin out or crash.

pcars,3c8oxn,keeb119,4,Sun Jul 5 23:06:09 2015 UTC,"Sounds like youre overdriving the tires. If youre going so fast through a corner that you put in more steering input and nothing happens, youre going too fast (which ironically will make you slower). Either let up a little steering angle, let up the throttle (dont have to let off completely, 10-15% could  still work, depends    of your speed and the diff settings).  Generally speaking, the ideal speed to approach a corner is just as fast as you can  go without braking in the corner. Release the gas/brake, aim for the apex,  and hit the throttle decisively when you  feel like you wont have to let up again. If you get on the throttle, but have to release it again because youre going too wide, its too early. If you floor the accelerator but you naturally  take a  shallow exit line (not using the width of the race track), its too late."
pcars,3c8oxn,InZomnia365,2,Mon Jul 6 01:09:08 2015 UTC,Your tires are still affected by temperature regardless if damage is on or off. Try Raising the pressures in the front tires by ~0.1-0.25 atm

pcars,3c8oxn,SGNick,1 point,Mon Jul 6 00:15:39 2015 UTC,How are you turning? Are you driving through corners slightly too fast resulting in understeer? This would have your tires turned further than the car is turning making them wear much faster than if you slow down a bit more and avoid the understeer.
pcars,3c8oxn,1Operator,2,Mon Jul 6 00:28:21 2015 UTC,"I think the tire wear option is related to degradation over time, not temperature.  With tire wear off/disabled, your tires can get too hot to maintain grip, but I think your tires retain the ability to always recover all of their grip after cooling, and tire performance doesn't degrade over time.  With tire wear on/enabled, I think tire performance degrades over time no matter how much you try to pamper them, and they'll degrade faster the more you overheat them.  I could be wrong. This is just how I interpret it based on my limited observations (on PC)."

Notice the four circles that constantly change size with a corresponding percentage. These represent your grip at each corner. If you go over 100% at all, you are scrubbing/spinning your tires. It sounds like this is happening at your front tires.  Respond to me with what you notice, along with your car and track combination, and I'll continue to assist when I am able."
pcars,3c8oxn,Smithy2997,1 point,Tue Jul 7 04:46:02 2015 UTC,"Tire wear means the tire becomes physically degraded irrevocably with use and the rubber must be replaced.  But even with infinite ""everlasting gobstopper"" tires (Tire Wear: Off) the temporary transient temperature of your rubber will change due to friction and will affect grip.  In this context, friction means ""sliding instead of rolling"".  If you slide the front tires too much (""understeer""), they will heat up and lose grip, but they will cool off if you ease up a bit.   Zero out your front toe If outside edge of tires is hotter than inside, make camber More Negative If inside edge of tires is hotter, make camber ""less negative"" (but not necessarily positive) Lower your front accel differential setting.  I assume you're in an FF (Front Drive) car.  Also try lowering decel setting.  This should all reduce tire slippage, which will reduce temperature. Get wider front tires.  Might feel weird aesthetically, but your available rubber is being heavily over-worked.  Get more rubber. Most importantly: Follow best practices for driving   I assume lowering tire pressure will also help, because pressure affects temperature, but I've never really knowingly tweaked my tire pressure."

Real Porsche racingcars are very vulnerable right there, actually. There was a specific accident at the 24hr of Nurburgring this year, where a Porsche only clipped another car with the left front; result was that the cooling liquid was everywhere.  Also, the radiator might not have been up in a high enough level, so the engine simply got hotter as the time passed, and at one point got too hot.  I am pretty sure though, its the 1st thing, because I have tried that many times before in different cars; hit another car with your front hard enough, and your engine doesnt cool enough afterwards because the radiator is damaged."

pcars,3c6is2,G2Wolf,1 point,Sun Jul 5 18:11:13 2015 UTC,"This other video is a perfect example of what happened and how you can watch for it: https://www.reddit.com/r/pcars/comments/3c6se5/cadwell_gp_mercedesbenz_amd_ccoupe_dtm_is_a_lot/  You can see him make contact with other cars or the wall a couple times, and you can watch the temperatures on the dash and the lights at the top of the screen rise until it blows. When you see the temps get that high and the lights at the top (depending on car) going yellow, you need to boxboxbox asap."
pcars,3c6is2,G2Wolf,1 point,Sun Jul 5 18:03:13 2015 UTC,"I didn't watch the video but from what I gather from the other comments, it's definitely radiator damage. When the engineer says ""You've got some aero damage"", you'll roughly have 1 lap worth of racing left before your engine blows so pit as soon as he says that.   Also, in solo mode, the engineer isn't always available for some reason. If you've hit the front of the car a couple times during the race, keep looking at the oil/water temperatures on your MOTEC display if it's available (or in some cars like the RUF RGT8, there's a separate digital dial in your instrument cluster) . If it's around 100, you're fine. If it's over 110, you've damaged the radiator. It'll keep climbing and usually your engine will fail at around 140 to 149C IME."
pcars,3c6is2,CannedEther,0,Sun Jul 5 15:04:35 2015 UTC,"It would seem the general consensus is contact, i find alot of that is perhaps the ai taking corners a bit too slow. I'll try cranking it up those last few percent."
pcars,3c6is2,G2Wolf,9,Sun Jul 5 15:30:28 2015 UTC,"Changing the AI isn't going to change the fact you constantly ram people from behind. I'd be afraid to see you race in multiplayer where you can't just adjust a number to make everyone else ""go faster"" so you don't hit them.  You need to work on your braking points and your lines through the turns. You are entering turns going too fast and too far inside. You shouldn't have to constantly accelerate and decelerate mid turn. Get all your braking done at once before the turn, accelerate past the apex. Don't brake, gas, brake, gas, lift, gas."
pcars,3c6is2,Dominant88,1 point,Sun Jul 5 18:10:09 2015 UTC,"I find that if I turn up the difficulty I hit people from behind less. Under 80 and it happens at least once per race, at 80 the seem to slow down at the same breaking point as me."
pcars,3c6is2,Gerald_89,-1,Fri Jul 10 19:43:09 2015 UTC,"You can just get failures. I've had a gearbox failure before out of nowhere. Lap 32 of 35 (i think it was 35) at Brands Hatch. Turned down my lengths after that as so annoyed. Got an engine failure on Lap 5 of 5 the other day too.  Haha, loving the negs for things that happen in the game. As if karma matters"
pcars,3c6is2,I_see_your_value_now,1 point,Sun Jul 5 10:05:29 2015 UTC,The random failures are very rare. The chances are that there was an issue with driving technique or setup.
pcars,3c6is2,Gerald_89,1 point,Sun Jul 5 15:46:27 2015 UTC,Engine failure had no contact. Low temps all race. No overheating.  Gearbox I hit a curb hard and it failed 5 laps later.
pcars,3c6is2,G2Wolf,1 point,Sun Jul 5 23:26:31 2015 UTC,"This video wasn't a random failure. He made tons of contact with his front end, damaged the cooling, and his oil/water temps were slowly rising the entire race until it blew up (temps can be checked on the MOTEC dash with in-car view)."
pcars,3c6is2,Gerald_89,1 point,Sun Jul 5 18:12:26 2015 UTC,I couldn't view the video. Work likes blocking anything worth while.
pcars,3c6is2,lookoutblorgons,-2,Sun Jul 5 23:25:07 2015 UTC,"This is something that really annoys me. As far as I can tell the default setups all use 100% boost pressure on the turbo and this seems to result in inevitable engine failures after a few laps every time. If these cars genuinely can't maintain 100% without failing then fine, but in that case the defaults should be set at a level where they won't fail.   It's especially bullshit for endurance races because I don't have time to drive around for a couple of hours trying different pressures to see which one I can actually trust to run in the race."
pcars,3c6is2,Sect93,2,Sun Jul 5 09:55:38 2015 UTC,Ever tried checking your radiator level? 50% which is default isnt enough for the RWD LMP1 on Le Mans.
pcars,3c6is2,lookoutblorgons,1 point,Sun Jul 5 10:04:08 2015 UTC,"Oh yes, that too. Also a similar story with default brake ducts absolutely cooking the brakes."
pcars,3c6is2,Sect93,2,Sun Jul 5 10:08:50 2015 UTC,"Funny, my experience is that the brakes never get hot enough at 50% on most tracks :P"
pcars,3c6is2,lookoutblorgons,2,Sun Jul 5 10:10:48 2015 UTC,"Clear air is fine, it happens when you're following right behind another car for a long time as far as I can tell. Although I have had problems with the front brakes being hot and the rear brakes really cold, even without much front bias."
pcars,3c6is2,I_see_your_value_now,1 point,Sun Jul 5 10:14:50 2015 UTC,"This is especially true if you're very very close to the back of another car. It's very common in NASCAR to see drivers have to pop out to the side a bit to get some air, as the airflow behind another car is not enough to cool the engine and brakes."
pcars,3c6is2,Synner40,1 point,Sun Jul 5 15:48:43 2015 UTC,yup. just a little bit to let the car breath.
pcars,3c6is2,willi_werkel,0,Sun Jul 5 16:30:35 2015 UTC,"One Lap of Nürburgring, long straight, engine always blows. Why can't the default setup not be a setup which works? Not everyone has the time to do their own one."
pcars,3c6is2,Sect93,1 point,Sun Jul 5 10:04:20 2015 UTC,"Put the radiator level on 100% and you should be fine, but will have a slight impact on top speed."

pcars,3c8y5e,Hordiyevych,8,Mon Jul 6 00:30:40 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't agree with much of what has been said in this review to be honest.  I've hit an invisible wall once in 100ish hours, certainly not 2-3 times per day?  Really does that happen to others?  His video example of bad netcode seemed to be one participant that had a bad connection.  No amount of netcode is going to fix that.  Yes some online races can be messy but that's down to participants not the game.  Although some better penalty systems need to be put in place.  It just seemed to me that he rage quit one afternoon and decided to write a review."
pcars,3c8y5e,Ilikeyoubignose,7,Mon Jul 6 05:02:48 2015 UTC,"60 hours in, haven't run into any walls."

pcars,3c8y5e,Jayphizz,-3,Mon Jul 6 20:54:29 2015 UTC,"A couple people in the video had bad connection, and this sort of thing happens all the time. In terms of walls I run into them all the time, especially on the Nurburgring and it pisses me off to no end.   I didn't rage quit one afternoon, I've got 40 hours in this game and honestly every single other racing sim has been a better experience and are just better games than PCars, the only thing about PCars is that it was hyped to no end and is a big budget release, which makes the innumerable amount of problems even worse."
pcars,3c8y5e,Ilikeyoubignose,1 point,Mon Jul 6 10:55:10 2015 UTC,"With regards to the lag, like you say it's a couple of people with poor connections. This is not the games fault.   Have you reported the invisible walls in the official forums?  Like I say I am at 100ish hours and hit an invisible wall once that I can remember. I have more issues with the multiplayer bugs like unable to enter ""Drive"" or stuck in bumper cam. Yes, there is some work needed to clean up a ton of bugs but the fact I've spent so much time on the title so far tells you how much I'm enjoying it."
pcars,3c8y5e,xxTheGoDxx,1 point,Mon Jul 6 21:11:02 2015 UTC,completely agree on the penalties. AI is to fixed on driving ideal line What's up with shitting in Russians for no reason? Seriously dude... The video just looks like connection problems. Without knowing what ping that person had you can't comment on the quality if the net code.
pcars,3c8y5e,Random_Dad,0,Wed Jul 22 02:25:38 2015 UTC,Is that shot of the SLS AMG from drive club?
pcars,3c8y5e,dmayan,-1,Mon Jul 6 04:26:58 2015 UTC,"The penalties are way too sensitive and extreme however. Simply running wide on a corner, which often have gravel and slow you down will invalidate your lap time. Occasionally even cutting a tiny section of a small corner will invalidate times, and tight and twisty circuits such as Nordeshliefe (The most well known and dangerous track layout on the Nurburgring) very tough to drive cleanly as it is almost impossible to very slightly cut corners, which the game penalises extremely harshly.   Yeah..."
pcars,3c8y5e,StarboardSatyr,-5,Mon Jul 6 01:29:41 2015 UTC,English good is.
pcars,3c520p,HelloImFrank01,18,Sat Jul 4 21:25:19 2015 UTC,"The ""next lap invalidated"" is the most frustrating thing imo. I get why it's implemented, but they went about it in such a shitty fashion. I feel like if you go off in the last 1/3rd of the track, you will get that penalty. Take Bathurst for example, if you just go a little wide on the third to last turn(after the long straight), next lap is invalidated....how the fuck does running wide at that turn affect my next lap."
pcars,3c520p,BlindJesus,3,Sat Jul 4 23:34:23 2015 UTC,Or the start of the porche curves in lemans. Over 2km away from the start/finish line.
pcars,3c520p,Dettol_hand_wash,2,Sun Jul 5 03:08:10 2015 UTC,Snetterson and that last corner. Mess that up at least a couple of times each race.
pcars,3c520p,AnonymousAmazonian,3,Sun Jul 5 01:26:32 2015 UTC,Just tried Bathurst for the first time the other day. That track with a Formula A car is the most intense racing experience I've ever had. Just putting in hot laps has me on the edge of my seat. I couldn't imagine an actual race there.
pcars,3c520p,Tylensus,1 point,Sun Jul 5 01:57:21 2015 UTC,I've actually driven on that track. In a Holden Rodeo @ 60-70km/h
pcars,3c520p,Keamy,2,Sun Jul 5 11:48:45 2015 UTC,"I get so infuriated when that happens at Bathurst. Brake just a little too late going into that corner and you'll run off, thus wasting that lap and the next. And of course idk how that affects the next lap at all."
pcars,3c520p,swiftsilentfox,6,Sun Jul 5 03:40:52 2015 UTC,"Yea, It can be frustrating. Especially when I just want a personal time to complete with. Sure make going inside corners super strict, but I doubt flying into the gravel on the outside can really unfairly improve time.   But that is just my thoughts, maybe some one has a reason for how it is.  At least times aren't totally deleted like F1 Qualifying today..."
pcars,3c520p,desicrator55,2,Sat Jul 4 21:37:58 2015 UTC,"For organized multiplayer events it's great. Most leagues and weekly clubs have rules along the lines of 2 wheels must be between the white lines at all times.  It's then quite frustrating if people abuse the penalty system by running wide on the exits (like you could do in Hockenheim) to gain an advantage or close a gap.  In other games you can enforce those rules yourself using replays after the race, but in pCars you can only spectate your own car and there are no driver names (there are more issues like cars missing etc.).  So for these people it's a welcome change although getting proper replays instead would have been better.  (Also I think that the intention of SMS was more to fix the hotlap challenges with this. ""Hardcore"" multiplayer simracing unfortunately doesn't seem to be a priority.)"
pcars,3c520p,cubbiibbuc,1 point,Sat Jul 4 22:52:09 2015 UTC,"My only issue is the mandatory slow down. It really is too sensitive to call that specific kind of penalty. Half a wheel off on some tracks when you are two wide is kind of a joke. Marshals in real life take stuff liek that into account. If its the leader hotlapping out front going wide they will throw out a pen, but for people in a huge group they understand that you need to be safe and give enough space to not get hurt."
pcars,3c520p,saintedplacebo,2,Sun Jul 5 20:23:39 2015 UTC,"I agree 100% !! Or you ride the curbs in the last corner one tire over and you are fucked! I really wish they could make it less sensitive. On the topic of laps time, why does the ai not get laps times invalidated! In have seen ai go wide I check the times and they set the best sector time! I really hope they fix that too!"
pcars,3c520p,chavz25,1 point,Sun Jul 5 16:17:48 2015 UTC,"Why is it that when I first start off the grid, it's immediately an invalidated time? I haven't hit anyone or gone off anywhere. But right when I cross the line to start my time, it already says its invalidated. That really irritates me."
pcars,3c520p,babythai206,1 point,Sun Jul 5 09:55:44 2015 UTC,"if your cutting the track, it should be invalidated. if your trying to save it or spin out and need to get righted then its way to sensitive.   same for the cut track penalty. if your trying to get turned right you shouldnt get an additional 5 second penalty."

pcars,3c520p,IanBeII,1 point,Sun Jul 5 10:47:36 2015 UTC,"If this is the real Ian Bell, could I suggest something? Could you please add on option to either:   disable it entirely  disable ""next lap invalidated""  make it less sensitive/increase the boundaries a little   This will obviously be for offline races only. I've given up on my career mode because this keeps happening while I'm qualifying on a new track. I do play both the practice sessions but on a higher difficulty setting, it's hard to keep up with the AI during qualifying unless you drive a little faster than you can handle.   Another idea would be giving us a choice to automatically keep AI 10% lower while qualifying. I can handle 75 AI during races, and around 65 while qualifying on a new track. I don't think I'm the only one.  Edit: Never mind. Just a troll account."

pcars,3c56vf,IanBeII,6,Sat Jul 4 23:32:57 2015 UTC,"Then what is it? Tires are still up after the flip so I can rule out a blowout. I don't have video to back up the first 2 incidents but I'll just say the last 3 GT3 league races have ended with me sitting on my roof. Once on fairly new tires and twice with only a handful of laps remaining. Not trying to challenge what you're saying, just don't see why it's happening because it's not following some reasonable pattern."

pcars,3c67v9,Datsun4ever,1 point,Sun Jul 5 05:31:45 2015 UTC,I think you can increase ride height and adjust the springs to help the car go over kerbs. Some kerbs though are probably best to just avoid.  For instance at Hockenheim turn 1 I think its probably better to just avoid the exit kerb instead of tuning to handle it.
pcars,3c67v9,hopeimanon,2,Sun Jul 5 06:57:21 2015 UTC,"Last turn of the last track you do in your Formula Rookie career is absolutely brutal. That thing's like a foot tall. I hit it on a kart once and flipped multiple times. Scary shit, man."

Even got the T3PA and TH8A (which didn't work out of the box), I also picked up the GTE wheel and F1 wheel for it, both of which were great fun. The calibration for the wheel is quite special, and if I didn't set the wheel to full lock left it didn't set up properly.   TM's website is fucking archaic, I feel like I'm in the movie war games just trying to navigate it. Multiple times I would follow their own process to update firmware, however the files you download didn't download properly 9/10 times. Their support takes over 2 1/2 weeks to reply to an email, and that response is always some copy paste bullshit.  All in all the experience with TM was decent for the first couple of weeks.

Hot lap is good On line is ok when it works Career is fucked  It's a buggy fuckin mess and I would love for someone to take this to the courts.  I've seen Sony, Microsoft and Apple get fucked for the tiny little things over the years and really it's been nit picking.   But this is pure lies, con men, law breaking and literally telling you that if you complain they will ban you and steal your dinner money.   It's like bullying to nth degree?  Kids paid 60bucks for this shit, problem is they are kids and none of them have the balls to move forward with a law suit.

pcars,3c0nw6,IanBeII,1 point,Sun Jul 5 10:57:47 2015 UTC,"My biggest gripe with the game is the way Ian Bell addresses his consumers. He really needs to spend some money on a PR guy to help him understand that being snarky and rude only compounds the issues. I play the game, i complain at the plethora of glitches and i make due with what it is at the same time because i really want the game to be a good platform to race on. And after 2.0 on PC it is almost there. In fact its even at a point where you can run a series without too much trouble. Heck I am even running a series on the game myself. The race we just had was good. It really was. Its at the point where i dont have much of anything to complain about anymore as far as core gameplay goes and if the game was released in this state i think it might not have gotten the bad press it did. But then to compound the issue by living in an echo chamber and not dealing with criticism maturely has really hurt the companies reputation. I compare this to the way CD-P.Red released The Witcher 3. Incredible PR. Incredible support. Incredibly happy fan base telling them that they are better than the largest gaming companies in the world ei. EA, Ubisoft, Capcom, etc."

pcars,3c0nw6,thisguysmokey,5,Sun Jul 5 11:38:54 2015 UTC,"I think it is a good game. It just needs a lot of polish. The biggest problem is that their main focus is console, where you can't change the graphics settings, so most likely they will never fix having to restart after every graphical change. Sad but true. Well, they might, it will just be called project cars 2."
pcars,3c0nw6,doctaj5,4,Sat Jul 4 02:59:45 2015 UTC,If only they had some sort of alpha/beta stage to sort out shit like this.

Because what could be good for my style of drive could be dramatically bad for others people, we have all different style of drive. I think that is much better and more satisfy learn how to make it on your own. This will give you much more benefit."
pcars,3bz18k,ChammaBrothers,3,Fri Jul 3 11:17:03 2015 UTC,I think the point is to help others learn how to tune their cars better. It is a helpful resource.
pcars,3bz18k,Sir_Stig,0,Fri Jul 3 12:54:12 2015 UTC,In my opinion you gonna learn if you start tweaking parameter over and over on the circuit and with video that fully make you aware of what are you doing.

pcars,3c1ia4,lookoutblorgons,1 point,Fri Jul 3 22:33:45 2015 UTC,Need more information. You could be turning in too quick for how fast you are going. It is hard to say though without more information. Like is this at corner entry just as you turn in? Midway through the corner? High-speed corner? Low-speed? every corner? Are you running default setup?
pcars,3c1ia4,hopeimanon,1 point,Sat Jul 4 01:18:21 2015 UTC,Could it be that your tires are cold at the beginning of the race? Or is this happening once they have come up to temp? There is quite a difference in the amount of available grip between cold and optimal tires which may be throwing things off.   Maybe try keeping an eye on the tire temperature during practice and the race to see if there is a difference.
pcars,3c1ia4,dan-klassen,1 point,Sat Jul 4 23:23:13 2015 UTC,this is a noob question.... how do I do that.. lol

I started with all of them off, and sure I was frustrated for a bit. That's okay, though, because now the cars that I felt were ""Undrivable pieces of shit"" (Looking at you Lotus 98T with 6 Bar boost pressure) are actually beasts that can be tamed. The challenge is part of the fun."
pcars,3c1ia4,Platfoot,2,Sat Jul 4 06:56:19 2015 UTC,"I agree. The best thing to do is throw yourself into the deep. I tried slowly turning off the assists and when I turned off ABS I either missed all of my braking points or almost came to a full stop 50 meters in front of the apex. I gave it a rest and a week later I returned with all assists turned off. Still not the best and I still mess up my braking points (especially in road cars) every once in a while, but I did win my first online race a few days later."
pcars,3c1ia4,chimpyman,1 point,Sat Jul 4 09:31:11 2015 UTC,"While I do agree with you. The thing with most new players is trying not too turn them off. Unless they are really committed to playing, some will rage and give up when they spin out on every turn at the start"

Therefore you can't drive it with the engine sounds as good as you can when other cars are not around you.   It's a poorly implemented part of Project Cars.  The audio of the other cars is always the same, they never fade in and out with distance.  There should have an option to turn down other cars in audio settings."

Yellow RUF guy was the first person I lapped (you can see im in first and leading by 16sec), and my first encounter with him is shown here.  After the race, he claimed that someone rammed him in the first corner, and that's apparently that's what justified trying to ram everyone he could off the road.  After the first attempt, he was clearly malicious and so I could see him coming in my rearview mirror, and just assumed that he was going to try to punt me off the track on the corner. Saw him aiming where I was going to be and just kept going straight and then turned in late, lol."

pcars,3bxipk,spodermanSWEG,2,Fri Jul 3 10:07:25 2015 UTC,"I'm doing the Clio Cup right now. It really only does that when the tires are cold. I think the car is pretty planted after the tires warm up.  First of all, I adjusted the brake bias more to the front. By default it's something stupid like 45% front. Then I lowered the brake pressure because I'm running real driving aids, which means no ABS. By default it's at 100%, which locks up way too easily.  The suspension on this car doesn't allow for much adjustment, so I just reduced the rear anti-roll bar setting.  You can also play around with the diff, but if I recall correctly it's already set pretty high."

pcars,3bxipk,papahet,3,Fri Jul 3 15:49:04 2015 UTC,"It is remarkably realistic in this regard to be honest, a fast FWD circuit car is set up to be very pointy and to oversteer easily."

Possibly options:   The break balance is too far rearward and you just locked up the rears in heavy breaking. I have found if you turned down the preslip (its starts at like 100 N-m) and break mapping you need to feather the gas on turn in to slow corners or you get snap oversteer."

pcars,3bu9y9,NorcalHPDE,4,Thu Jul 2 05:11:02 2015 UTC,"You should not have wheel spin exiting a corner, bouncing revs are a sign for wheel spin.  However if the rear is not stepping out it's still okay. Usually you want to choose your line through the corner so you don't have oversteering or understeering and no wheel spin.  Additionally to choosing the right line you can always reduce the rear sway bar or soften the rear springs/dampers or decrease the acceleration diff to counter not wished behaviour.  And, sometimes it's also useful to choose a higher gear while exiting (through the whole corner or short shifting while exiting). Especially the GT3 cars do have enough torque to acellerate faster in a higher gear."
pcars,3bu9y9,TonyR600,1 point,Thu Jul 2 14:32:37 2015 UTC,So you're saying short shifting can be faster than experiencing a moment of wheel spin taking the engine all the way to fuel cut?
pcars,3bu9y9,TonyR600,1 point,Thu Jul 2 19:39:13 2015 UTC,"It really depends on the situation. Maybe on one lap it doesnt matter, but over the course of a race it might make you slower substantially because your rear tires can lose grip due to overheating for example."

pcars,3bu9y9,EastyUK,2,Thu Jul 2 20:20:56 2015 UTC,"Your aim should be to maintain as much momentum as possible from start to finish. Brake early and have a quick exit (especially on tighter corners), likewise you should avoid coming to a near stop and then having to do a lot of speed to gain back on the next straight, you should have as high a speed as possible when exiting the corner. Also use track space, go from far side and hit the apex (in most cases)"
pcars,3bu9y9,uwotmaet,1 point,Thu Jul 2 12:04:55 2015 UTC,"Depends on the car,corner and surface quality. Ideal situation is your on the power as soon as possible with no sliding and spinning the wheels. The more out of shape the car is or on bad surface the more you'll struggle to get the maximum power to accelerate the car. If the game actually simulates these things accurately is another matter. Also it maybe better having an abundance of power and a little spin rather than to little.    These things are more applied to high grip scenario like F1/race cars and road circuits, With rally in dirt or snow it's all rather different. in that in case you generally have an abundance of power and little traction slowing the car when it's not going straight."
pcars,3bu9y9,uwotmaet,1 point,Thu Jul 2 05:20:32 2015 UTC,"The simplest way to do this IMO is to start by braking early and hitting the apex early.  Then, lap after lap move the braking and apex later and later until you have maximized your exit speed. At this point, you've mastered the corner.  Be cautious, some corners are best taken by braking and apexing early. Usually corners that I think are described as ""increasing radius"". Tight at the beginning and steadily opening up thereafter. Parabolica is such a corner."
pcars,3bu9y9,HelloImFrank01,1 point,Thu Jul 2 19:24:57 2015 UTC,"I'm actually talking about the corner exit, I feel like I have corner entry and mid corner more on point.  I should have specified I was talking about the outside exit curb, not the inside entry one."
pcars,3bu9y9,lookoutblorgons,1 point,Thu Jul 2 19:35:30 2015 UTC,"Ok. Just keep in mind everything I mentioned is intended to maximize your speed at corner exit.  Corner exit is critically affected by entry. Cheat and enter early, you'll exit late, and slow. Miss your apex by entering late and you'll have to scrub too much speed to make the corner causing you to exit slowly."
pcars,3bu9y9,BurnDesign,0,Thu Jul 2 20:10:05 2015 UTC,"From my understanding, the apex or the curb is more slippery than the tarmac. So if you go full throttle on the apex you might spin out.    Safest bet is to ease up the power carefully then go full throttle when you're off the apex.    But as said it also depends on the car itself and if you are coming out of a high or slow speed corner."
pcars,3bu9y9,HelloImFrank01,2,Thu Jul 2 10:52:57 2015 UTC,"""The apex"" is just the name for the mid-point of a corner, it's not a thing. There's also plenty of grip at the apex from the rubber of all the tracks driving on the racing line."
pcars,3bu9y9,josh6499,1 point,Thu Jul 2 11:19:16 2015 UTC,"The Apex is the optimal inside point of the corner, depending on your cornering style. If there isn't a kerb where your apex is, then you've probably got the corner completely wrong."

However I don't like what the developers are doing to us, I would never care if since the beginning they were more clear about DLC, Season Pass and so on, but as a buyer I pretend respect from them.

I'm glad they're not so strict, allows a chance to be aggressive without fear of having to slow down for 6 seconds on the main straight, when I clearly didn't corner cut."
pcars,3bwly0,Nimix_,7,Thu Jul 2 22:06:22 2015 UTC,"The fact that you can cut most chicanes makes the time trial community events so pointless, it takes you more time to figure out where you can cut safely than to actually get faster on the track. It could sure use some tweaking in my opinion."

pcars,3bsui8,J03130,1 point,Thu Jul 2 01:02:39 2015 UTC,What do you mean? without riding any curbs?  It's difficult to know on this track what is out of limits. Obvious areas they could and maybe should have put penalties. reason I really don't like the track much and prefer say the north loop where running of has little aid to the lap.
pcars,3bsui8,J03130,1 point,Thu Jul 2 01:39:42 2015 UTC,Just the cutting in general. Within limits i think I'm around the 34's. I do like your first corner line though so I'm gonna try that if it's still going.
pcars,3bsui8,JimmyTheBones,0,Thu Jul 2 02:25:56 2015 UTC,I don't think the cutting is huge. just corner 4 and getting up on the corner on the pit entry area. load my ghost and compare.   I'm at 141 at the moment. http://cars-stats-steam.wmdportal.com/index.php/leaderboard/event?event=46&page=2
pcars,3bsui8,papahet,2,Thu Jul 2 02:34:56 2015 UTC,"So frustrating, was doing my best to get a hot lap on this circuit but the world record ghost was cutting so many of the corners it's ridiculous, how am I meant to even get close to that without cheating!?"
pcars,3bsui8,JimmyTheBones,2,Thu Jul 2 12:05:40 2015 UTC,"This. The laps done by the top 10 are BS, completely off the track on almost every corner on the entry and exit.  I don't know why they can't just apply real world rules, if all 4 wheels cross the white line you have exceeded the track limits and will be penalised."
pcars,3bsui8,JimmyTheBones,1 point,Sat Jul 4 13:14:04 2015 UTC,"Yeah exactly. I managed to get 6th on Dubai International with the 250cc karts, but following the number 1, first corner they were beaten where you can't cut it but after that I'm screwed!! I don't know if you can tell whether opponents use assists or not either.  Edit: It seems completely arbitrary if you get penalized or not. It's given me warnings before with all 4 wheels within the white lines!"

pcars,3bnejj,dontdonk,2,Wed Jul 1 00:03:37 2015 UTC,"Its not only cutting the corners. You get a track penalty if you was a little bit to fast in the curve and leave the road/racetrack. And this is a bit too much. I can imagine some guys who just start racing now and dont know the Cars/Tracks and often slipping of the track get frustrated very quick cause the way to much track penalty. Before the Patch it was okay, only a few Racetracks had a big issue like Dubai Autodrome."
pcars,3bnejj,DERREZZ,1 point,Wed Jul 1 10:58:37 2015 UTC,What about Catalunya. Did they fix the chicane cutting?
pcars,3bnejj,ChammaBrothers,2,Sun Jul 5 11:24:57 2015 UTC,"learn to drive clean and you won't cut any corner ,)"
pcars,3bnejj,NoJeb,4,Wed Jul 1 09:43:25 2015 UTC,"im kinda frustrated when you get it after spinning out. im not gonna blame spinning out on bugs, but if the game knows you just spun and used part of the track to get going right you shouldnt get a cut track penalty."
pcars,3bnejj,keeb119,0,Wed Jul 1 10:03:24 2015 UTC,"usually the spin out is the failure here and the cut track is the penalty for it. usually the spin out is caused by the driver, example hitting a curb to hard or at all (there are curbs that should be avoided at all cost even with a well setup car (for that track), they are like soap). But also the tune for the car and track might be a problem; dampers fast rebound or the differential, only to name a few things which could cause the loss of grip over curbs. But you have to think about something, if you fail every time at the same spot is really the spot the problem or your drive-style ?! Not always is going fast also fast. Sometimes is better to lift and coast through a chicane then to try and give full throttle to be faster. Races are long and so sometimes is even smarter to drive certain areas slower then to risk to spin out and ruin the whole race. So to come back to your ""bug"" feeling, it's not really a bug more a reminder for you that you have to change something in your raceline at this point. try and get some ghosts of people for that track and car and see how they do it, and be realistic is nice to see the best driver but you will properly not learn much for THAT specific curb with him because he's way ahead. take someone a few hundreds seconds a head maybe 0.500 and look how they do it or go on youtube/twitch/online and look who is doing it how. different drivestyles do it differently on that curb. Online is nice because you can see the internal MOTEC Hud and can see how he breaks and throttels at any given time (monitor mode). And again to why there is a penalty even for that situation is because you spun out doesn't mean always you loose in the chicane so you could and there are many who would try to use this as a ""feature"" to cheat them ahead. So yes it makes perfect sense why there a penalty is.  PS: sorry for the wall, want only to provide some help :)"
pcars,3bnejj,NoJeb,1 point,Wed Jul 1 11:12:34 2015 UTC,"I try to clean drive all the time but it is not only cutting corners. When you was a bit fast in a curve and leave the Track and get slowly back, you even get a track penalty. This is what sucks."
pcars,3bnejj,DERREZZ,0,Wed Jul 1 11:00:11 2015 UTC,"see my response down there.. for your specific argument, i know well what you talk about (grr brands hatch) but also here there is on some tracks the possibility to cheat the system. and to be fair it's only that the qualification time won't count, at least i had never got a speed penalty for it, and so it comes back to you overdriving the corner...  i hate it believe me but there are many maaany short cuts i can think off if it wouldn't be there and there are too many out there who would use it in there failure so it still makes sense even when it sucks because it's always THAT round you have that problem ,)"

I got wrecked by one, and sat there on the track on a straight for a good 3 seconds and watched the AI not budge from the racing line to hit me at 150.  The AI in this blows my fucking mind how bad it is.  First pcars2 was announced before any of this, then they have the nerve to call this a full .0 release???  This should be .9 in reality, but no more than 1.2,  a 2.0 means the 1.x releases fixed bugs, and 2.0 is usually an identifier for new content or a major change."
pcars,3bnejj,Tex-Rob,1 point,Tue Jun 30 18:21:34 2015 UTC,Anyone that got Oculus to comment on the update and Menu updates on oculus. I'm hesitant to make the investment on Pcars as I spent the money on Assetto Corsa to play with Oculus... I like Assetto overall but the lack of menu and things on VR gets me wondering if I should move to Pcars however I have heard Pcars had the same issues with VR.
pcars,3bnejj,frviana,2,Wed Jul 1 04:15:06 2015 UTC,"Way improved. I'm the same  bought AC for VR support and got burned. Bought PCars for the same reason and it is now excellent.   Direct mode works  Menus are fixed position but still work and you can see everything.   hUD works great!!  Frame rate good once you turn down some settings.   Latency down to almost oculus demo levels. Really fantastic.   This is now one of the best VR experiences I've had and up there with Alien Isolation (for me at least) as one of the best full VR games out there.   Had a race last night and it was super intense.   Downsides, exiting a game the dk2 screen freezes and you need to use menu on screen (which I mirrored). That's it so far for me.

There are physics based reasons behind it, which is why it seems to naturally fall out of the physics models of most sims, but the main sticking point is that in games our brakes work on a 0-100% scale which isn't the case in real life. So it's not so much that it couldn't work but that it's a lot more difficult to achieve the correct amount of braking pressure to do it. The movement and change in momentum of Kobayashi's car in this video looks VERY much like how the 2 foot save works, but without seeing his telemetry we can't really know if that's what he did http://youtu.be/ZzuF9EjNU9A"

A lot of these cars have dated designs that doesn't really hold up extremely well when driven hard. In addition, all of the cars use period tires IIRC, and on something old that results in a tall, flexy sidewall and not a whole lot of grip in the tread. If you can give us more info on what car it actually is, as well as your tuning setup and controller/wheel settings, somebody should be able to at least help you mitigate the issue."

The go karts drive more like f1 cars than road cars in how responsive they are to small steering adjustments.  A fairly easy way to make it you have to steer less is go into tuning, and you can change the steering lock in here. if it say starts on 13.0 by default and you then set it to 7.5 you'll find you can go from lock to lock much quicker and get the steering you need much easier.  Don't forget to let off the gas when you are slowly moving to the outside of the track, tyres are only good at doing 1 thing at a time and you'll corner much more effectively with both feet off the pedals."
pcars,3bp621,spodermanSWEG,1 point,Wed Jul 1 13:57:23 2015 UTC,"Going from kart to touring is tough, the karts brake fast and turn sharp.

You can feel the intervals in the internal FFB mechanism, so it's not exactly smooth, more ratchety (although this shouldn't affect your driving, it's not severe but is noticeable). The pedal board is very light and moves (so stick a 2x4 behind it). It has about 270 degrees lock to lock (versus 900 on the expensive wheels). But it's very good for the price. The plastic and rubber materials feel high quality, and most likely are high quality. And I set good lap times. I highly recommend it unless you wanna pay the price of a new ps4 on an accessory."

pcars,3bl136,Robotimus,1 point,Tue Jun 30 14:51:14 2015 UTC,Depends what difficulty the AI are on. Around 80% works well for me and the AI isn't to iffy (apart from the few mishaps which would happen in real life anyway) Tried it on 85% and I found the AI was way to aggressive and actively pushed me off the track near enough every corner. Maybe this is because I'm to slow for this difficulty level?   But I really do like PCars mess around with the settings until you find one that works for you. For me 80% is the perfect point of where the AI treats me well but is still challenging to be with the leaders.

pcars,3bipce,lookoutblorgons,0,Tue Jun 30 09:36:17 2015 UTC,"Endurance race needs to be at least 20 minutes worth.  Proof will need to be either video or screenshot. Both must show your name (if video, pause after your lap to show your name, time etc)."
pcars,3bipce,Dagmer-Cleftjaw,1 point,Tue Jun 30 09:48:03 2015 UTC,"These proof methods are fine for the hotlap, as Time Trial is pretty locked down. I was asking in reference to the Endurance event, as I'm not aware of anything outside of a custom single player event that will cater for this. If that is the case, a single screenshot won't show all the info. In addition, video isn't viable really, as many will be restricted with 15 minute console limitations etc.   Would be nice if there is a tidy solution that keeps it easy for everyone."

pcars,3bipce,InsaneBirch,2,Tue Jun 30 12:27:09 2015 UTC,Is the goal of the endurance event to have the fastest total race time over X laps? If so it might be better to do a quick race weekend versus 0 opponents as the AI just introduces an unpredictable and inconsistent variable.

pcars,3bipce,carloselcoco,1 point,Wed Jul 1 14:33:03 2015 UTC,"So I had a chance to play the game on PC round a mate's house today... Unfortunately I think my theory about PC being different to consoles may very well be true. The weather conditions are there for all to see in the screenshots for this event, but I think its more than just that.   I spent 2 solid evenings on my PS4 perfecting this track, and my best time was a 1:47.449 In just 15 minutes on PC, I produced at least 5 laps that bettered this, including this 1:45.779 - a whopping 1.5 seconds better than the time I've set for this event.   Now there was another difference - my mate has a wheel. But I've not really used one properly, certainly not on this game, and even with the adjustment period was able to beat my PS4 time.   Maybe I'm totally wrong, and this game is just far more suited to a wheel, that is a possibility, but if the gap is THAT big then anyone using a controller will be fucked. Either way, there doesn't seem to be much parity."
pcars,3bipce,PleaseBanShen,1 point,Fri Jul 3 20:08:48 2015 UTC,This could also be a mixture of better frame rate (smoother and thus easier control) or a wheel is just better overall. We will need some more people to test the theory. I'll be posting something about it.  Edit: I was about to make a post asking people who own a console and a PC to test it. Then I realized it was a bit dumb (I don't know why but I just feel like it was a terrible idea).
pcars,3bipce,PleaseBanShen,2,Fri Jul 3 20:41:29 2015 UTC,"Now that I'm back at my PS4, I'm not sure :) This game is so needlessly complicated, it's really frustrating. I've just played around with the controller settings yet again and found a better setup that emulates the wheel far better.   I had been using the default 'Mode 3', with a few tweaks to other settings. I've just switched over to 'Mode 2' (I honestly have no idea what these modes are, the game doesn't bother to tell you). In addition, I set steering sensitivity to 0, speed sensitivity to 60 (may be mode 2 default) and controller filtering sensitivity to 70.   I managed to regularly get into the 1:46's and also managed to drop into the 1:45's. This matches what I did on the PC... What's interesting is that I didn't change my car tune when switching controller modes, but the result of the different input prevented my tires from overheating, which they always did when using mode 3 with this tune. TL;DR - if you are using a controller, try mode 2... it may help."

He kept pulling me and I was messing up on a lot of corners, but I didn't want to be that ""quitting guy"" so I just kept pushing. I came in to the pits on lap 4 with no one in sight and thought I was just gonna do hot laps. At the start of lap 5 I see 3rd place in the pits (he missed pitting on lap 4) and I took his place right as he was leaving the pits. With my new found confidence I pushed as hard I could and he was on my ass the entire time. I could tell his frustration was causing him to make mistakes and eventually I finished in front of him to on the podium."

No biggie, I was thinking, it happens. But when I smacked the wall at about 130 mph, the car lifted off of the ground and caught the air. Never had that happen to me before so I kind of shouted. I've never seen the Formula A car actually leave the track and it caught me way off guard. I was laughing like a madman afterwords, though."

pcars,3bjqdb,kdmf90,1 point,Mon Jun 29 20:00:00 2015 UTC,Does putting your clutch in while in gear allow you to rev without the car moving? Or is the clutch not working at all?
pcars,3bjqdb,shadowofashadow,1 point,Mon Jun 29 20:12:34 2015 UTC,"I tried the Ford Mustang Boss and I could rev without moving while the clutch was engaged. Also, I had to engage the clutch to change gears otherwise I'd go to neutral.   However, originally I had tried the Ginetta GT3 and I can freely change gears without ever needing to use the clutch. But if I engage it, I do rev without the car moving.  So this must be the result of how different types of cars work? I don't know much so a real world lesson may be needed. The way I want it to work is how the Mustang was handling. The Ginetta made me feel like I was cheating and not having to worry about the clutch."
pcars,3bjqdb,Dagmer-Cleftjaw,4,Mon Jun 29 20:31:26 2015 UTC,"This is just where the GT3 car has a sequential gearbox. The clutch is automatic in these cars, as it is in real life. You can still use your clutch to manually drop to neutral for rev matching etc, but you do not need to use the clutch to shift. Ideally, you should use your paddles to shift in these cars, or use a sequential plate on your shifter. When using a car without a sequential box, you'll have to use the clutch when set to manual. I hope this helps."

Obliviously if you are driving GT3, Formula A(B), all car with sequential shifter is better and more successful brake with the left. However if you drive with the manual (H shifter) became hard to brake with the left because of the clutch."
pcars,3bhz0z,ChammaBrothers,1 point,Mon Jun 29 11:51:05 2015 UTC,"Ideally, in a race car you always want to brake with your left to allow for more accurate throttle responses to track conditions... that does get tricky when you have a clutch in a conventional standard car setup."
pcars,3bhz0z,shinamobabi,-1,Mon Jun 29 12:15:41 2015 UTC,Yep.
pcars,3bhz0z,ChammaBrothers,3,Mon Jun 29 12:20:49 2015 UTC,Left if the cars has paddles meaning you don't have to engage the clutch. But I suck at left foot breaking so I use my right on all cars. I remember the first time I tried left foot breaking in my actual car nearly got a face full of dashboard!
pcars,3bhz0z,Lewis_Hashbrown,2,Tue Jun 30 08:58:15 2015 UTC,left is more efficient but feels unnatural to me therefore i right foot brake...badly :)
pcars,3bhz0z,T1z3R,2,Mon Jun 29 11:41:48 2015 UTC,I use left in both cars but not all the time. I usually do all my heavy braking with the right (straight line braking) and then when the right moves over to the throttle I also bring the left over to take car of any angle changes I might need to make mid corner. I do it in both sequential and manual gear boxes.
pcars,3bhz0z,Elemento1991,2,Mon Jun 29 14:37:40 2015 UTC,"You should always use the left foot for braking unless you have and use a clutch pedal, in which case your left will be busy with the clutch so then the best technique is left for clutch and the right heel-toes the brake and throttle together.  Based on the topic post, I get the impression we're not using a clutch pedal because then there'd be nothing to debate since left would have to be for clutch, so definitely left for brake.  Using one foot for everything is inefficient because of the time lost traveling between pedals.  https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=9773pisjCSw  Jump to 7:30 in that video.  The professional F1 team training Hammond to drive their F1 car criticized him for the massive half-second delay between lifting off the throttle and applying the brakes. Ideally there should be a delay of 0.000 seconds."

pcars,3bhz0z,Snooze_Light,3,Mon Jun 29 12:14:46 2015 UTC,"I switch it up as well, which leads to the occasional 'braking' with the clutch pedal when I forget which pedal my foot is on and that I'm using all three."

pcars,3bhz0z,ChammaBrothers,1 point,Mon Jun 29 13:40:16 2015 UTC,I have sequential gears for my wheel so I left foot everything. It feels just as natural using my right foot now. Only use my right foot when heel-toeing.

pcars,3bhz0z,cregory83,1 point,Thu Jul 2 17:21:08 2015 UTC,"I don't know how accurate fuel use is in the game, but right foot braking will probably have better fuel efficiency, because you'd never overlap brake and throttle."

I watch BTCC there (went to the final round last year) and what you notice is that they usually take a late apex into it to get a good run out (unless they're diving the inside).   The hill almost invites you into the corner too early, then you carry too much speed and end up in the gravel."

pcars,3bh4i6,Brains77777,1 point,Mon Jun 29 16:43:18 2015 UTC,Brake sooner than you think you should and maximise exit speed so you are driving over the crest of the hill. Also make sure you turn into the apex of the corner and use the whole exit

I resign myself to losing time/a place on Paddock but make it up and more on Druids and Clearways where the AI is poor.
pcars,3bhy6d,Thatcrazylemur,2,Mon Jun 29 11:03:48 2015 UTC,"The 'Speed Sensitivity' setting inside controller settings will help with this. It sounds like you may have this set fairly low, so try upping it to around 65. You will lose some ability to turn when travelling at higher speeds, just you'll just need to find a balance you are happy with. If this setting is already set up though, maybe pop your settings on here so we know what you are currently using, then the advice will be more accurate."
pcars,3bhy6d,Dagmer-Cleftjaw,1 point,Mon Jun 29 12:16:48 2015 UTC,"I believe I have that turned down, you're likely right. If I do turn that back up, is there any other setting I can change to make sure I can actually get lock when turning?"
pcars,3bhy6d,Dagmer-Cleftjaw,2,Mon Jun 29 12:20:11 2015 UTC,"Set at around 65 you should still find enough lock to make most turns effectively. Using a controller, your options are limited though unfortunately.   Another method would be to turn down steering sensitivity to 0 (if you haven't already), and bring back the speed sensitivity to around 50 from 65. This will give you a bit more lock while still being controllable, and is the setting I personally use. If you have any more trouble, post up what you have set, and I can make some better suggestions."
pcars,3bhy6d,T1z3R,1 point,Mon Jun 29 12:24:37 2015 UTC,"That sounds like a decent idea. If I have any more questions I'll be sure to let you know, thanks a bunch."

pcars,3bei0a,ChammaBrothers,0,Mon Jun 29 19:41:29 2015 UTC,"So what if instead they don't sell a season pass but provide us with extremely good value for their dlc? So its£3 (round up) for 5 cars. A season pass usually goes for £20. So that's going to be about 30-35 cars.

pcars,3bdv7a,Brownie-UK7,6,Sun Jun 28 07:53:51 2015 UTC,"First, set your wheel's degree of rotation (DOR) to the highest possible.. So that's 900 degrees on the DFGT wheel I believe?  Second, go to help & options > controller and reset all your current settings. Recalibrate your wheel and follow the instructions. It will ask you to turn your wheel clockwise or anticlock wise to it's full DOR, you should see the number 100 when your wheel is fully turned.  Now this second step is where a lot of people are getting confused, it will prompt you to then turn your wheel 90 deg clockwise or anti clockwise. It's important you return the wheel to centre and then turn the wheel 90 deg. When you've got the wheel at 90 deg you should see the reading ""900"" on screen, hold the wheel in that position and confirm, you will feel the ffb in the wheel try return to centre but its important you hold it at 90 deg, save. Your wheel should now be properly calibrated and now you can recalibrate your pedals.  Thirdly here are some FFB settings that are posted on the official forum for each car that may help you fine tune to your preference, each has a different emphasis on different aspects of ffb. -  http://forum.projectcarsgame.com/showthread.php?22938-Jack-Spade-FFB-Tweaker-Files  Hopefully this helps you get the proper feeling and feedback from pCARS :)"
pcars,3bdv7a,r3c14im3r,2,Sun Jun 28 10:12:05 2015 UTC,Thanks a lot! I did the calibration before but I don't think I held the wheel in place after the FFB kicked in. Will give it a go tonight.   I hope this sorts it - at the moment it feels as if there is no contact between wheels and road. Thus have also removed the artificially loud tire squeal (no bad thing) but it leaves me not really knowing what the care is doing in corners until it is too late. There loads of config options so I'm sure I'll get it but it takes a little more fiddling than some other games.
pcars,3bdv7a,coneillcodes,2,Sun Jun 28 12:18:17 2015 UTC,The return to center part during the calibration took me like two frickin days to figure out. I was so confused as to how people were getting it to read 900°. They should really include this on screen when doing the calibration.

pcars,3beo5a,MrSn1ck3rs,5,Sun Jun 28 15:07:33 2015 UTC,Brake hard initially then ease off the brake pedal as you slow down.
pcars,3beo5a,lookoutblorgons,3,Sun Jun 28 15:32:27 2015 UTC,"Most people have covered this fairly well but I'll touch on something else that hasn't been talked about yet and do my best to explain it. Traction distribution could be where your running into trouble. You basically have acceleration, braking, and cornering traction. Your tires obviously can only hold the road so much before they begin to slide. In physics it takes more energy to begin to get an object to slide than it does to maintain a slide. (Going over 100% traction begins the slide) If you are braking and using 80% of the traction and then go to turn in using 40% you are now at 120% of the tires capabilities and are likely going to spin or run off the track. This is why you try to get all you can out of braking in a straight line, then turn-in and coast towards the apex at little or no throttle to maximize your cornering capabilities and then distribute between acceleration and cornering from the apex back out. If you are sliding you are going beyond the tires capabilities. You also need to beware of things like bumps on the track or changes in elevation because of what I stated earlier about getting an object to slide being difficult and maintaining it easier because once you lock up you have to relieve a lot of pressure to get your tires to hookup again."
pcars,3beo5a,Elemento1991,1 point,Mon Jun 29 14:55:04 2015 UTC,"So if I were to lock up, I would have to lift off the brakes completely before braking again, which would make me miss the apex by a mile, right?"
pcars,3beo5a,Elemento1991,1 point,Mon Jun 29 15:21:54 2015 UTC,"Not necessarily all the way off. I don't know any exact figures, plus there would be a lot of variables that play in but for simplicity let's say it takes 1200lbs of force to get a tire to break traction. Once it is in a slide it would take something like only 700lbs of force to maintain the slide, so you would need to let go of the brakes to less than 700lbs of force to regain grip and get back to getting anything up to 1200lbs of braking ability from the tire. There is a good chance you could blow the corner but with practice you will get very quick at correcting it without even thinking about it.  Someone mentioned heel-toe shifting in a manual transmission vehicle. This is important too. When you down gear a real car you get that big jolt from the engine. That slow down jolt from the engine along with hard braking will push your drive tires into lock up. It's all about keeping things smooth between the tires and the road. This includes chassis stability and trying not to unsettle the car too much."
pcars,3beo5a,ReachForTheSkyline,2,Mon Jun 29 17:23:21 2015 UTC,"It depends on the car and the corner. Not to mention other factors like track conditions, tyre wear etc. Because there are so many variables it's hard to answer but I can give some general advice:  Try braking hard initially, then gradually releasing the brake pressure as the car slows down. This is especially true in high down force cars because the slower you are going the less the car is being pushed into the track which means your wheels are more likely to lock. If you don't adjust the pressure you are applying as you slow down then your wheels will lock, which could be what is happening to you.  Again, it depends on the car but in the single seaters you'll only be applying full pressure for a fraction of a second in most braking zones because the cars slow down so fast.   Being able to apply the maximum possible pressure without locking the wheels for the entire braking zone is a bit of an art, baring in mind the maximum possible pressure is a moving target as you're slowing down. You just have to get a feel for it by practising.  I hope that makes sense!"

pcars,3ben9o,shinamobabi,1 point,Sun Jun 28 14:59:07 2015 UTC,"I'm in the same position as you (also in TO). I was really close to getting the Thrustmaster T300RS, but the only place that has it in stock is Canada Computers, and their return policy on it is ridiculous (no returns/refunds for any reason). Judging from various forums, the reliability is a big issue, and I don't want to go through the hassle of shipping it back to Thrustmaster (though their repair facility is actually in Canada). For those reasons, I've decided to hold off for the G29. I know, it's using old tech, but it's tried and true, has solid improvements over the G27 (ex. Steel bearing), has better pedals than the T300, and looks 100 times nicer. F1 2015 won't be out until late July in the North American PS store anyways, so hopefully the G29 will be available in stores by then."

pcars,3ben9o,401InvalidUsername,1 point,Sun Jun 28 19:38:14 2015 UTC,"I ended up buying the T80 for $110 at Best Buy today. Only issue is no FFB/and not even simple vibration like the controller. With that said, I'm really happy with my purchase. A year or two down the line, I'll probably end up getting the G29 when it is more reasonably priced. I don't think the Fanatecs have official support from Sony, so I'm not willing to spend that much on something that might not be supported soon. Also, I'd be very hesitant to get any FFB wheel shipped, unless it's from Logitech. Most have reliability issues."

The only issue is that the clamp is very narrow, so you have to have a thin surface. on the table's edge. You can always get it from Best Buy and return it, if you don't like it. The lack of FFB takes an hour or so to get used to, as it is a step down even from the controller's vibration function. Otherwise, I don't think I can ever go back to using a controlled. Very happy with the purchase; hopefully it's reliable."

The only thing to note is tyre types and the amount of fuel you need for the race. The rest is for quick and consistent drivers trying to get that last 0.2 seconds on his hotlap.  If you're looking to improve, and you ""just play for fun"", just try improving your laps with stock setups. They're generally fine :)"
pcars,3batto,arkhalax,1 point,Sat Jun 27 13:53:55 2015 UTC,It all depends on your driving style. I am actually much better off with a custom setup on most occasions and with much better I mean several seconds per lap. The right setup is really personal opinion though.

The GT3s look great, but they drive kinda muted in pcars. Theyre not overly lively in other sims either, but with pcars' slightly lower difficulty, its not that exciting IMO.  If I were to pick a combination to showcase any sim, Id take a hard-to-drive car (possibly 90s-00s GTs) on a short but fast track. Nordschleife, which is my favourite track), is just way too long to keep people interested if theyre relatively new to motorsports or the concept of racing sims.  Assuming Im letting the person try the game for themselves, Id pick a track which they can set a time in without too much hassle. After all, the point of racing is improving your times etc."

pcars,3b9f9k,G2Wolf,1 point,Sat Jun 27 02:21:24 2015 UTC,"Pick one track and one car you would like to master.   Take it easy, brake early enough so that you can turn into the apex and exit the corners comfortably every time. Focus on driving good lines rather than braking late or accelerating aggressively out of corners. When you can lap consistently and smoothly like this, build up speed gradually. You'll find that when you can drive round a track confidently with consistent lines that it will become clearer where the limits of the car are. It will be much easier to tell where you are slow and where you can push harder. Spinning every time you try to push is because you're trying to run before you can walk. Speed is a byproduct of consistency."
pcars,3b9f9k,lookoutblorgons,1 point,Sat Jun 27 12:13:49 2015 UTC,Toy with the setup. There isn't much to mess with on kart but look for things that reduce oversteer

pcars,3b67fp,SlardarGuard,1 point,Fri Jun 26 11:01:41 2015 UTC,"I use pCars Profiler.  As I use a controller instead of wheel, it's very useful to see where the stability assists are activated, even when you don't suspect it. For example, if you're at constant mid-thrust on your controller and you see the thrust moving in telemetry, then the assist was active there. If you then play on a server where assists are disabled, you know you can spin there and you should be more careful.  It's also great to setup the gear box and to see the tyres heat over laps (which helps you decide the tyre pressure, etc.)"

pcars,3b3x88,LogitechG_Christina,26,Thu Jun 25 20:15:19 2015 UTC,"Logitech G29 is just a G27 with a new skin. G27 and G29 have the same base, the same metal paddles, the same size wheel finished in leather, similar metal three-spoke design, a similar piece above the centre hub containing shift lights, and the same pedal design. They just added some DFGT buttons, everything else is G27.  http://i.gyazo.com/54937c7d033aa19e1aeb591ca0116920.png  You can find a G27 new for 200$ with shifter included.  G29 price is outrageous. 399$ + 59$ for the shifter.  If you compare it to the tech used on the Thrustmaster wheels, this G29 is prehistoric technology.   Same force feedback base than the G27 with a simple helical gearing No Belts No Brushless Motor No Hall Effect Sensor No Detachable wheel   Fanatec and Thrustmaster give support for PS4 to wheels that they don´t manufacture anymore. You can use your old PS3 compatible wheels like the T100 and T500 on PS4.  So if you buy a G29 pretty sure it won't be compatible with PS5.  Shame on you Logitech."

Everyone here is well informed and knows that this is a poor attempt at a cashgrab. You can't seriously say the G27 compatibility issues were due to the chip, it's clear BS.

Bring the price down and i think that it will be met with a warmer reception by some people but it's still going to annoy a lot of G27 owners with a PS4.  I'm not sure about the whole security chip fiasco, it's another debate filled with more theory & speculation than fact from what i've read about it all so far but if it is possible to support the logitech G27 it's something Logitech should really consider giving the go ahead for rather than trying to push the G29 on to G27 owners."

Knowing that it's a choice to publish a driver that allows games to function with the older wheels, then Logitech have chosen to publicly stick their middle finger up at any existing customers.   The sim racing community is quite niche, you are not going to get a lot of sales from outside of this community at the price you have set (which is ridiculous for old tech), and yet with your actions, the chances of you getting many sales from within it are slim.   Thank you for finally offering some clarity, something which your shitty company has failed to do up to now. I can finally place an order for a Thrustmaster T300 without any concern that my brick at home (aka. DFGT) may suddenly become useful again!   Some kind of gif showing an emotional farewell might have been appropriate here..."

pcars,3b3x88,SoCaLLbeer,11,Fri Jun 26 02:36:27 2015 UTC,Why not? Other companies are supporting their wheels on ps4 that were designed to work with the ps3 and pc.  Why does Logitech not want to support current customers?

pcars,3b3x88,shadowofashadow,1 point,Fri Jun 26 08:35:04 2015 UTC,Logitech has really suffered some poor decisions in the last few years. This is just another one of them.  No one who knows anything will buy this wheel over a G27 or G25. It is too expensive and doesn't do anything differently. You guys really dropped the ball on this one.  There is no reason to make us buy a new wheel with identical hardware when you could have solved the compatibility with a software/firmware update.  You guys would have been way better off going for a lower price point and attracting the more casual crowd. There is no one in their right mind who knows about sim racing who will spend $400 on this over a thrustmaster or Fanatec.

The G29 has tons of buttons which looks perfect for me but the price is ridiculous, I can't afford that and even if I could, wouldn't because it's too pricey, I'd trade my G25 for a G29 anyday :("

pcars,3b3x88,projectrx7,7,Fri Jun 26 02:50:14 2015 UTC,I think Fanatec make something all three compatible. But you probably won't like the price.

pcars,3b3x88,TooMuchCyanide,1 point,Fri Jun 26 20:51:55 2015 UTC,"This was my original plan about a year ago or so. I wanted a wheel compatible for all three platforms, but the price drove me away. I'll be selling my G27 to go towards a G920, as I want something that'll work on both PC and Xbox One, and (hopefully) won't cost as much as the Thrustmaster TX (which is going for $800 here in New Zealand)."

pcars,3b5gps,Kozwella,3,Fri Jun 26 03:12:07 2015 UTC,"As far as game play, great. If you're looking for a race sim more akin to Forza Motorsport or GT this is your best bet on the current consoles. I have it for PS4 and have dabbled with online. Generally it has been very good with mostly respectful/proper racers. Of course there are a few bad apples who will crash into you just for looking at em but they are the exception. I've only had it happen to me a small handful of times so I don't consider it a problem. I'd say it's good and if you want a more in depth racing game it is totally worth it."
pcars,3b5gps,Freddy216b,2,Fri Jun 26 03:29:32 2015 UTC,"It depends. So if you can get through the first corner the race became great, if not is because someone using you as a brake.  Usually I'm hosting the lobby, and in all honesty the best setup is to put all help OFF and 15 minutes in the qualifier."
pcars,3b5gps,ChammaBrothers,1 point,Fri Jun 26 08:57:14 2015 UTC,"In my experience qualifying and practice sessions go fantastic, but I've given up really pushing for pole or a high starting point because every time I've started in the top 4-5 by the time I'm braking for the first corner I've been punted sideways into the kitty litter/wall/tires/etc by some asshole who doesn't know how to brake, and would like to help himself to mine."

Curious about what the driver code will be for using excess parts of the track (ie. keeping at least two wheels between the white lines) Currently the track cutting situation is quite poor on some tracks, although the update should fix the majority of them, some general rule should put in place.

pcars,3b6xij,RiioTMan,9,Fri Jun 26 13:43:21 2015 UTC,Seeing as Project Cars costs about £20 it would be stupid to not play the first game before investing a serious amount of money into a sequel which won't be released for 2 or 3 years...
pcars,3b6xij,lookoutblorgons,3,Fri Jun 26 13:53:54 2015 UTC,"What he said. The first game still has a great amount of content with more to come in both free and paid content packs. The second game is still going to take at minimum 2 years to develop. If you feel you could have a say in the development process and help shape the game, then by all means buy into Project CARS 2."
pcars,3b6xij,TooMuchCyanide,-4,Fri Jun 26 14:07:59 2015 UTC,I like the idea of having a wider range of motorsport events and sense SMS announced pCars 2 it seems like pCars was more of a test then anything else.
pcars,3b6xij,Mr_Burning,12,Fri Jun 26 14:08:00 2015 UTC,"All big companies start working on their next game as soon as the first one comes out. Usually the team is split and 1 part works on the content for the current game while the rest of the team works on the new game.   Normally this is funded by a publisher,  and it will happen in the shadows, the new game will be announced years later when it's close to completion.   Because Project CARS is a crowd funded game, they have to announce it now, in order to get funding.  Because they had to announce the sequel being in the works, doesn't mean the first game is just a test or will receive no further support."
pcars,3b6xij,Sir_Stig,2,Fri Jun 26 18:54:13 2015 UTC,"Dude, it's going to be like 2+ years, if you want to wait that long sure, but buying into CARS 2 will basically just get you a low rez skid pad atm."
pcars,3b6xij,lookoutblorgons,2,Fri Jun 26 14:21:41 2015 UTC,"It wasn't a test, the game was in development for over 4 years for goodness sake. It will be supported for 2 years as promised. The reason Project Cars 2 has been announced is because of the WMD development model. Most sequels go into development immediately after the first game, or in many cases before the first one is even released. The only difference is those games aren't crowdfunded or community developed so they aren't announced until closer to the release date."
pcars,3b6xij,ozurdin,2,Fri Jun 26 14:20:27 2015 UTC,"also most ppl think of pcars2 as a sequal which its kind of not. its mainly a rally game, a spin off almost. they told us near day 1 of pcars they said they were making rally either as an expansion or a full game.  depending on what u want id go for both if the moneys no issue. im kinda hoping that ppl with pcars1 might get a small dicount for 2"
pcars,3b6xij,VR46,2,Fri Jun 26 16:05:05 2015 UTC,"Honestly SMS is pretty foolish to make the title Project Cars 2 and announce it so soon after PC1 came out, and still has what many consider a massive amount of bugs in it.    They could have avoided all this flak if they just named it Project Drift or something.  Seems like video game companies are in desperate need of some playerbase consulting."

pcars,3b6xij,davedontmind,3,Fri Jun 26 20:44:16 2015 UTC,"Why pay £50+ for a game that won't be released for several years and won't even be a playable game for a long time yet? Especially when, a few months after it's release, it'll be available for half that price.  The only advantages you gain are being able to play the game as it develops and having your say (small as it might be) in the development process. If that's worth £50 to you, then go for it, but personally I'd opt for the currently available version right now. Despite its faults, it's pretty fun."
pcars,3b6xij,davedontmind,0,Fri Jun 26 14:08:40 2015 UTC,"Actually that is a pretty good point, I am just concerned that this is it for pCars, not saying there isn't a lot in the game just I don't want this to be it besides the odd car pack."
pcars,3b6xij,eastcoastgamer,2,Fri Jun 26 14:14:34 2015 UTC,"I am just concerned that this is it for pCars   There will be additional liveries, cars & tracks released, and of course they'll continue the bug fixing.

pcars,3b6xij,eastcoastgamer,1 point,Fri Jun 26 16:16:17 2015 UTC,"The AMD performance ""issue"" is a bit exaggerated. The game is easily still playable for most AMD cards, just on lower settings compared to the equivalent nvidia card at the moment.

When you're in an event dashboard, underneath the car setup there is also an option to change pit strategy. Make your own pit strategy and make it active, or change the default and make sure that 'yes' is selected where it asks if you want to change tires during a pit stop.   The downside to this is that if it starts raining in the race, you can't just leave your strategy alone, as it will put on the dry tires that are specified in your newly saved default pit strategy (it used to know to put on tires based on conditions, but once you overwrite the default strategy, that functionality is gone). If it's raining when you go into the pits, be sure to go back into your pit strategy and update your tire selection.  Or, you could be like me and wait for a patch, because while I did test this to see if it works, I don't feel it's necessary to dedicate any more time to an unfinished game."

pcars,3ay500,G2Wolf,5,Wed Jun 24 20:13:47 2015 UTC,My biggest gripe is on straights actually. If you lap someone who is also lapping someone (happens a lot in longer endurance races) they often just bang into you while you're overtaking them and send you straight into the wall.
pcars,3ay500,Gluecksritter90,2,Wed Jun 24 22:09:22 2015 UTC,"Improvements to AI navigation to lessen collisions during cramped race starts, improve detection of other cars during cornering, and improve clean overtaking"
pcars,3ay500,G2Wolf,7,Wed Jun 24 22:55:04 2015 UTC,That doesn't mention anything about blue flags though. They should get COMPLETELY out your way if you are lapping them. Keeping clean is nice but they shouldn't be even be trying to race you.
pcars,3ay500,J03130,7,Wed Jun 24 20:28:11 2015 UTC,That's not how blue flags work. Backmarkers need to let you by when you overtake them but they do not have to move off the racing line to do so.
pcars,3ay500,G2Wolf,2,Wed Jun 24 20:40:19 2015 UTC,"In fact, they shouldn't move off the racing line. That's how collisions happen. If they stick to the line, they are predictable, which is much safer.  On the other hand, if you're side by side they shouldn't drive into you just because the racing line moves over to your side of the track."
pcars,3ay500,avoiceoftreason,0,Thu Jun 25 09:07:02 2015 UTC,Aren't blue flags just handled by taking a wide line so the faster car can take the inside?
pcars,3ay500,Tylensus,3,Thu Jun 25 00:33:32 2015 UTC,"Ehh not really.  The over taking car still needs to properly and cleanly overtake.  The front car being blue flagged is just required to not block, allow the overtaking car to get by when safe, and carry on.  They dont actually have to swing wide or anything.  I suppose that is a bit more sportsmanship related for those that do get the hell out of the way."
pcars,3ay500,smudi,4,Thu Jun 25 00:45:05 2015 UTC,"The most important thing is that the car getting flagged is predictable. Swinging to the side and blatantly leaving the racing line is not predictable, and is more likely to result in an accident."
pcars,3ay500,fleaver12,0,Thu Jun 25 00:58:38 2015 UTC,"I didn't mean off the line. I meant they should make no trouble for you trying to get past hence why i said completely. I see this being an issue on the game if the track is twisty. If the AI get off the throttle when being lapped, i will take my hat off to the devs but,  unfortunately, because everyone wants it, no one is gonna get it. If Ian Bells attitude towards his customers is anything to go by i don't think any HUGE changes will ever happen :("

pcars,3ay500,KidKrinkle,5,Wed Jun 24 14:39:58 2015 UTC,"I hope they fix the issue where the AI won't pit for rain tires when it's pouring down. Also, when they are on slicks in the rain, they should be all over the place not stuck like glue.  For that matter, if I put on wets and the track is absolutely DRENCHED, my tired should not overheat on the out lap. All of this happened in the Lotus F1 86 turbo.

pcars,3ay500,davedontmind,2,Wed Jun 24 17:30:51 2015 UTC,IMO triple monitor users shouldn't have been regarded as minority. It is unacceptable for a racing sim to have broken triple screen support in 2015. The HUD also works ridiculously with 3 monitors.

pcars,3ay500,TheMaadMan,3,Wed Jun 24 14:07:39 2015 UTC,I believe they just not announced the new content yet. Otherwise this patch more feels like 1.5 than 2.0.

pcars,3ay500,_St3fan_,2,Wed Jun 24 18:19:55 2015 UTC,SMS have decided to call it 2.0 due to the large amount of fixes.

It is, of course, the right of SMS to decide what number they are gonna use, but doing a whole bunch of fixes and minor feature addition/adjustment and updating the software to a new major number is not a common practice. This decision of calling the new patch 2.0 is more of a marketing thing. It coincides with PCars 2 which was just announced, and changing the major number will help reduce the worries of PCars 1 owners that support for PCars 1 will stop due to the development of PCars 2."

Even after community play testing for months and a 7 month delay to fix bugs.   Saying that building a game is difficult might be fine when you delay release. Releasing a trainwreck and then saying that making games is hard as an excuse is just whining.

""Game breaking bug"" seems to be everyone's over exaggerative catch phrase just now, i will agree that the release version was in a bad condition for a lot of people but it wasn't completely broken or unplayable.

All of the shitty developers yeah, it's become a trend that certain folk are trying to end because the gaming community keeps getting half assed, unfinished, buggy ass games that never get fully fixed. SMS/WMD aren't one of these small companies trying to get funding for their first game, they have plenty of money. I didn't say they have abandoned but their focus should be on Project CARS 1 to fix all the bugs and then work on the next one.   What bug did you report? Has it been reported elsewhere? Is it on the known bug list? Put yourself in their shoes, just for a minute and think how you would react reading your own posts. After reading this post I can only imagine what you wrote on the official forums.   I am a developer myself, I gave them a guide to re-produce, video evidence and a detailed explanation, it hasn't been posted elsewhere as far as my searches have gone (although it has been posted after my post but none of them have had replies from the mods/staff) and it was and still is not in their buglist even though it's a clear cut bug.   Is pCars perfect? Hell no but it has huge potential and the way SMS/WMD have gone about producing, supporting and keeping the community informed should be commended. Don't get me wrong there is lots of bugs I'd like to see fixed (Unable to select drive once connected to a race, or stuck in bumper cam) but me annoying the hell out of them on their forums isn't going to make it happen any quicker. Report the issue in a civil manner and wait for updates.   The two bugs you gave an example for should have been picked up by the private testers and fixed before release, same as hundreds of other obvious bugs. Sure some wont be spotted but the majority of bugs should have been spotted way before release. Also, those two bugs are on the buglist... that's all I want to know that they are aware, but nope they don't seem to want to add it to the buglist even though others have posted in my thread having the same issue.   The fact is, they ARE fixing bugs. We don't get to prioritise what gets fixed first.   I didn't say they weren't, I just said they are refusing to add all of the bugs even though they aren't similar or related to other bugs and they are just a bunch of money grabbing asshats. Game-stopping bugs should be priority sure, but all of the sub-30min fixes should be sorted and marked off for PR purposes."
pcars,3b4ufa,Sir_Stig,5,Fri Jun 26 01:58:02 2015 UTC,"Can you expand on ""completely unplayable""?  I bought the game day 1 and have been able to play since AND had a lot of fun.  There are a TON of us out there.  Completely unplayable to me says that it doesn't run.  I'm not saying you don't have a valid complaint, you clearly do.  I just think in today's world people forget that there are real people behind the forum aliases.  Your attitude in these posts tell me why you've not been treated well on the pcars forum.  And you still haven't told us what your bug is?"
pcars,3b4ufa,Sir_Stig,2,Fri Jun 26 04:05:16 2015 UTC,I know right? Not to defend him but Ian has a pretty short fuse in those forums. It takes a lot less that bu ping to get the wrath of Ian Bell. This is game is great though. Tons of fun.
pcars,3b4ufa,r3c14im3r,0,Fri Jun 26 07:15:18 2015 UTC,"It was completely unplayable for a lot of people, I myself was unable to get into any multiplayer lobbies because the join session button was constantly unavaliable, they've fixed that and now it only happens occasionally, but there were other issues like crashes every other lobby/race and.  They fixed them to an extent within the first patch/hotfix rollout but still there were hundreds on the forums.  I was actually fairly polite on the forum, I said my please and thank you's and all I want is the bug to be added to the buglist... at least then I know it's going to be looked into rather than having to constantly bump it to try and get it some attention, otherwise my post would have just fallen back into the abyss of page xxx. A simple ""Added to the buglist"" or ""Bug noted"" from a staff member would be more than satisfactory.  The bug, which is very easy to reproduce is by using the ""look back"" button/function/view when the chat window is active (visible on screen) which will scroll the window up and there is no way to scroll the window down.  The bug will more than likely be a typo, missed/incorrect condition, the key has been double-bound or maybe the chat box has scroll permission when it shouldn't.

That doesn't mean your report has been dismissed, there are other bugs prioritized just now that the team are busy working on.  Again, just because it's not on the list yet does not mean it's been ignored, there is no need to repeatedly bump your thread waiting for acknowledgement just because you havn't had a direct reply regarding this bug from the devs. It might be a simple fix that you could patch in 2 mins but there are other bugs in the queue being worked on, no matter how much noise you make your issue will not be pushed forward in the queue."

It hasn't been added to the buglist so how am I supposed to know that they have seen it... it's easy to miss a post in a forum that has lots of activity.

pcars,3awv9z,blahyawnblah,2,Wed Jun 24 03:42:15 2015 UTC,That's odd. Are you sure you're not releasing the brakes with too much load through the Kart? For instance your braking and getting your Kart turned and it's planted but as soon as you release the brakes you're going to free a lot of weight in the chassis and will probably get a tank slap/spin. Try getting your braking done a little early and balance the Kart through the corner and power early.   Perhaps.

And then before you know it, a sequel is announced, but the core game is still fucked.

pcars,3axjow,Cancerous86,4,Wed Jun 24 13:05:06 2015 UTC,FYI: There were 140 guys working on pCars 1. 40 are left for bug fixing and the remaining 100 work on pC2. (Source)  SMS being a small team is misinformation being spread around by some people who are defensive about the game.
pcars,3axjow,cubbiibbuc,2,Wed Jun 24 17:06:48 2015 UTC,"Nobody has ever said they have a small team. The point is that bug fixers and developers are two completely different jobs. So ""splitting them up"" is irrelevant.   It's really annoying how all gamers think they're industry experts and can't just let people do their damn jobs."
pcars,3axjow,-H-E-L-I-X-,5,Wed Jun 24 18:42:15 2015 UTC,"The game has a 2 year lifespan, relax. We're only 1 or 2 updates in.  I'm starting to get sick of the SMS Hate circlejerk on this sub."

Unfortunately there does seem to have been an increasing amount of idiots joining the racing communities on here though :("

pcars,3axjow,Shadylurker,1 point,Wed Jun 24 19:36:19 2015 UTC,Actually they started work on this years ago as rally was originally planned to be part of the initial release but they scrapped it for time constraints. So you're a little late with your complaints when most of what you see in this video was probably done like 2 years ago.

pcars,3askkn,nycska,1 point,Tue Jun 23 20:59:08 2015 UTC,"Even then, that split seems to be the person scored one place ahead of you, not the person directly ahead of you on track. I started to wonder why it said +1:35.76 when there was someone driving right in front of me..."
pcars,3askkn,OiNinja-,1 point,Tue Jun 23 16:05:45 2015 UTC,That's exactly what I meant figured it was common knowledge to know it's the position ahead
pcars,3apr99,Synner40,20,Mon Jun 22 14:42:17 2015 UTC,"My definition: do everything in your hand to avoid touching other cars. When defending position, swap the side of the road you're driving ONLY one time. Everything else is just common sense: if there's no room, don't try to fit in."
pcars,3apr99,PleaseBanShen,3,Mon Jun 22 14:48:16 2015 UTC,"Agreed. One of the most important ones to me is when you're close to someone, you make sure to be defensive when breaking. I get hit in the back so many times online. Anticipate the breaking of the person in front of you so that you can keep the fight going. If you're behind someone, you'll have to break earlier than the normal breakpoint (unless you're out-braking them). Yesterday I raced Monza several times, and each time I would get hit in the back in both chicanes. Really annoying."
pcars,3apr99,dotnilo,1 point,Mon Jun 22 15:47:59 2015 UTC,"I've only raced a couple of times online, sometimes was a bit hard to predict the breaking exactly without harming my own line as the car in front occasionally desynced and jumped a bit.

pcars,3apr99,creepingcold,9,Mon Jun 22 18:06:11 2015 UTC,"Basically F1 rules. Don't swerve around the track defending positions, try and avoid contact but it happens."
pcars,3apr99,hutchie97,8,Mon Jun 22 15:41:05 2015 UTC,It's not proper ettiequte to move over for cars lapping you.  It's correct to not make any defensive moves and just stay on the racing line.  You want to be predictable.  If you move off line you aren't.
pcars,3apr99,TheCrudMan,2,Mon Jun 22 15:32:36 2015 UTC,"In endurance racing that is the policy, but that is because you are usually in different classes so passes will happen in corner or two.  If you have a good place to pull over you should take it. If I'm a half second back on the straight you should pull off the line and slow down. It should not take me half a lap to pass a lapped car."
pcars,3apr99,hopeimanon,4,Tue Jun 23 08:15:04 2015 UTC,"You just stay on the line and lift out of the throttle.  You should not move over.  It's the responsibility of the overtaking car to make a safe pass, not the car being overtaken.    If you're on his bumper for half a lap then something is wrong.  If you're far enough back that you're slowly gaining on him over half a lap then he's not exactly in the way.  Just make the pass when you get close enough."

pcars,3apr99,MikeV27,3,Mon Jun 22 15:38:34 2015 UTC,"Crud mans right on that for sure. To me clean racing is being able to race close without contact, along with being smart. If your battling for 3rd and there are still 2nd and 1st ahead of you and your getting along side the 3rd place opponent on every corner trying to find a way by that isn't there. That's bad etiquette because your slowing both of yourselves down and P1 and P2 are getting further away.   To me its not just about avoiding contact but it's also about being smart enough to be a competitive racer others can go toe to toe with by driving and also mentally.  Also blocking is a big big no-no. Defensive driving is one thing, blocking is another. Nothing worse than a sore loser trying to block you."

I'd say that etiquette doesn't enter into it, it's just about being smart: is it worth it for both the attacking and the defending driver to let themselves be slowed down to possibly keep/gain the place? No-one is in the wrong if they keep the battle going."
pcars,3apr99,avoiceoftreason,1 point,Mon Jun 22 16:53:29 2015 UTC,Probably in the last laps but I hate whenever it's early in the race and someone's trying to dive bomb me on every little corner lol. It happens to me quite frequently.

pcars,3apr99,keeb119,1 point,Tue Jun 23 02:05:54 2015 UTC,It was just an example of using your brain. It's not uncommon for people to brake later than the person infront of them to try to make a pass and blow both parties lines through a corner.
pcars,3apr99,Elemento1991,1 point,Tue Jun 23 03:55:24 2015 UTC,"That's when you take the outside line, let the guy out brake himself trying to out brake you, and then take the undercut on the exit.  You'll be on throttle earlier than the guy dive bombing, and might even gain a little more of a gap if you're actually faster than the guy through the next set of turns."
pcars,3apr99,rexanimate7,3,Wed Jun 24 00:48:51 2015 UTC,"For me it's doing everything I can to avoid contact, like in Formula 1. If someone is on my inside when approaching a corner, it's my duty to make sure that we both get through the corner OK.  Also, when qualifying, if I spin out, I'm very careful when going back on the track to not disturb anyone else. I just ruined my lap, no point in ruining yours too."
pcars,3apr99,Professor_Terning,2,Tue Jun 23 07:20:05 2015 UTC,i prefer a gentlemans clean race i.e no contact at all but thats rare as everyone likes a little rub :)
pcars,3apr99,T1z3R,2,Mon Jun 22 15:41:49 2015 UTC,"Personally, I don't think all contact is dirty. I think maybe there is a time and a place but its completely subjective and maybe even depends specifically who or what you are racing.  However, I love racing without contact. I always respect a clean pass more. I avoid it because I don't enjoy it, not necessarily because I think its ""wrong""."
pcars,3apr99,Mikeastuto,2,Mon Jun 22 16:13:56 2015 UTC,I love clean racing. Even if I finish last I still have the satisfaction of having a good clean race with a good qualifying session.  If I'm in a session full of assholes thinking they are playing ridge racer it makes me just turn the game off.
pcars,3apr99,MeMuzzta,2,Mon Jun 22 17:39:04 2015 UTC,"I found the cleanest races are those with crazy practice/qualif times. Last one I did was 1 hour long qualif. It meant most new comers left when they saw that an hour was left, and the grid was really consistant with people's skills since everybody had the time to do 20-30 laps.  When the race started, I went from 4th to 7th due to a bad start with no crash anywhere.   2 laps in, (Formula A btw) I'm overtaking somebody from the outside and we touch tires which had us both spin out. I loose some aero bits and the other guy seem okay so I let him take the lead and head out for the pits. Out of that 10 lap race, that was the only crash I saw/heard that involved 2 cars, most others were people running off the track and coming back on cleanly after they were passed.  Had a lot of fun :)"
pcars,3apr99,itsBoyso,4,Mon Jun 22 19:00:23 2015 UTC,"I personally hate the 'rubbing is racing' thing. Rubbing isn't racing. Racing is non-contact. Nudging people off the apex of a corner or nudging them off-balance isn't where I'm at. Ain't big, ain't clever, ain't impressive.  Clean racing to me is essentially racing in with sportsmanship and class. One of the common mistakes comes with the whole 'I was ahead, therefore it was my corner and I can turn in when I want'. Wrong. If someone has outbraked himself up the inside of you from behind, you cannot just blindly turn in and cause a collision. The blame is with the last driver to manoeuvre and if he's already committed to braking before you turn in, you can't just turn in on him because he'll have nowhere to go. Either he'll make the corner in which case it's fair play - he's outbraked you - or he won't make the corner and you can avoid him knowing he's compromised himself. The key thing here is once he's begun braking, he is committed. There is nothing he can do. He cannot make evasive action under heavy braking. There is no changing his mind."

Even if they just get their nose in along your back wheel in the braking zone, you need to leave them room in the turn."
pcars,3apr99,G2Wolf,2,Mon Jun 22 16:14:49 2015 UTC,"Having your nose up along the back end - on the inside is a pretty doggy manoeuvre imo.  If you are driving in car view and this is happening on your side where you can't see your wing mirror, it will end in a collision every time as the defender will just try to hit the apex not knowing where you are.  In this scenario, I would say it's up to the attacker to yield imo."

That's said, by all means of your matey is trying a fast one around the outside by all means squeeze him off, maybe a little rub but only if you have track position. If they're 1/2 - 3/4 beside you give some room. What else.... don't fucking cut corners. Yes I know you want to win but it's not sporting. It ruins it for everybody and you don't actually improve as a racer.  I'm sure I could think of more but this will do."

pcars,3apo3i,shadowofashadow,5,Mon Jun 22 15:12:54 2015 UTC,"Be ready to cry. I track my real car so I thought I could jump in and play right out of the box. Boy was I wrong haha. Sim racing is a whole other beast because you cannot feel what the car is doing, you have to listen to the sounds it is making and determine the limit of grip, which is much harder. I'll probably be building a simvibe setup at some point to feel the car more"
pcars,3apo3i,HelloImFrank01,3,Mon Jun 22 14:42:36 2015 UTC,Biggest problem for me is the throttle. It's so easy to just flat foot it in the sims but in real life if you pay attention you barely ever use the throttle more than 25% unless you're accelerating hard.  Get used to feathering it and using other queues to know when your grip is going.
pcars,3apo3i,Dank_Diddy,2,Mon Jun 22 14:53:50 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I mean the struggle is the same with a controller. Except with a controller there is really no feedback other than vibration, which is the same whether you are bottoming out, losing grip or getting plowed into.   Control seems to be the biggest advantage and you really need it in Pcars."
pcars,3apo3i,Dank_Diddy,2,Mon Jun 22 15:04:27 2015 UTC,"I first had a cheap ass steering wheel from Sweex which was alright in my view. Until i got Pcars and i wanted something more serious, i got the Logitech Driving force GT wheel.    And damn! That Sweex wheel is nothing, absolutely nothing compared to this thing. So much more precise, so much more real with the force feedback.    All in all it doesn't take much tips, just practice with it, if your wheel is supported in Project Cars than i wouldn't mess with the settings, i never did and i do fine."
pcars,3apo3i,Corbotron_5,1 point,Tue Jun 23 23:43:19 2015 UTC,"Congrats on your new wheel Mikeastuto!  I'm saving up for a wheel at the moment, hoping to get next month (PS4).  I had the Microsoft Wireless Wheel for the Xbox 360/Forza 4, and it was so much fun.  It really added a level of immersion to the experience.  What I really appreciated was being able to modulate steering inputs in the corners with such a higher degree of control.  The carousels on Nurburgring were so much more manageable than with a controller.     I'm not sure if I'm going to go for the Fanatec (Porsche GT2), the Thrustmaster (T300RS), or the Logitech (G29) though.  Can you tell me how you narrowed down your selection?  I'm having a tough time deciding.  I really like the Fanatec since i can just buy the wheel now and an adapter to use the pedals from my Microsoft Wireless Wheel, but I don't know if all PS4 games will support it.  I would love to get F1 2015.  I would eventually upgrade the pedels to the clubsport elites.  The Thrustmaster T300RS looks like a very nicely built wheel, but i've read that the pedels aren't the greatest.  However, since it is an officially licensed PS4, i'm assuming all games would support it (just an assumption, i really don't know for sure).  And then there is the Logitech.  I don't know why, but for some reason i thought this would be a $250 unit, not a $400 unit.  It appears to have the exact same internals as the G27.  If that is the case, i may be steering away from that wheel (pun totally intended :) )  I've read that the forcefeedback on the Thrustmaster and the Fanatecs were superior to the G27, and again i'm assuming that the G29 shares the same internals.  However, i do like the fact that it comes with three pedals and the shift is only $60 if i do want to upgrade, opposed to dropping $150 on the shifter and another $100 on the pedals to upgrade the Thrustmaster.  TL;DR, please share why you went with the Thrustmaster."
pcars,3apo3i,Dank_Diddy,2,Mon Jun 22 15:36:23 2015 UTC,Thanks! Im still not completely sure I made the best decision.  I went with the T300 because FFB was probably the most important feature to me. I also felt good about the fact that it was officially licensed by Sony.  The G29s durability and inclusion of a clutch pedal was enticing for me but at the end of the day the clutch pedal wasn't that important to me.  Also I was able to get my wheel on eBay for $60 less than MSRP. So If I do want to buy the better pedal set and a shifter I would put that $60 towards it.   Ultimately I feel like if I do upgrade the pedals and a shifter it will be a while down the road. I mostly just wanted to get my feet wet with a wheel and see where it goes. I may end up not liking it. (I dont really see that happening but you never know)   The general consensus is that the G29 seems to be over priced for what it is...  And while I would have loved to go Fanatec it just seemed like a bigger investment than what I was willing to go for right now.
pcars,3apo3i,Corbotron_5,1 point,Mon Jun 22 16:03:50 2015 UTC,"Thanks so much for the reply and your input.  It will help me in my decision to come.  I might go with the Thrustmaster as well.  I really don't think i want or need the shifter.  In fact, if i were to add on a shifter, i'm sure i would have to upgrade my steering wheel mount (a wobbly wooden tv tray.....lol) to accommodate.  Enjoy your new wheel and let us know how you are getting on with it!"
pcars,3apo3i,That_Brown_Man,2,Mon Jun 22 16:12:45 2015 UTC,"I went through the same thing and settled on the Thrustmaster 300RS. It seemed to me that you'd get a better wheel that way, with superior FFB, but at the expense of a shifter and a clutch. I figured I'd rather get the better wheel and add on the extras later on down the line. It'll cost more, but I think it'll be worth it."
pcars,3apo3i,dashramzi,1 point,Thu Jun 25 11:07:28 2015 UTC,"I'm leaning towards the Thrustmaster T300RS myself.  I heard the FFB is excellent with these units, the only thing i wasn't too excited about are the pedals.  I know that I could purchase the Fanatec ClubSport Pedals and use them with the wheel on PC, but I would pretty much only use the wheel on my PS4, so i don't know if there is a way to have the Fanatec pedals talk with the Thrustmaster Wheelbase.  I don't think that plugging the Fanatec pedals directly into the PS4 would work.  I really thought that the Logitech G29 would have come in as an affordable alternative to the Thrustmaster, but that certainly doesn't seem to be the case.  Thanks again for the reply, it is very nice to hear from someone that has already gone down this path."
pcars,3apo3i,skiedAllDay,2,Thu Jun 25 17:40:41 2015 UTC,"I don't know about compatibility between the Thrustmaster and the Fanatec pedals on the PS4 but I'm not optimistic. It seems that upgrading to the T3PA pedals is the way to go, but that's going to add the best part of 100 quid onto the setup. Factor in the shifter and you're talking about roughly £400 worth of kit. Painful. I bought several cars in my younger days that cost less than that."
pcars,3apo3i,J03130,1 point,Thu Jun 25 18:06:31 2015 UTC,"My T300RS is only a few months old and it's already acting up really bad. I've lost almost all force feedback and the calibration upon start-up slams the wheel to the right. I've contacted Thrustmaster, but their customer service is abysmal. When it works, it is an incredible wheel though. I hope you have better luck than I have thus far!"

Should I up shift even though I have to downshift for the next corner, should I let off the gas and coast to the breaking zone, or should I change my gear ratio for a higher top speed rather than acceleration?"
pcars,3aroxg,klorptar,3,Mon Jun 22 23:37:38 2015 UTC,"The rev limiter is there for a reason. It doesn't sound that great, but ideally they're there to keep the driver from damaging the engine. I usually race in GT3 class, and my gearing is the same on Imola. I just ride the rev limiter until I have to brake. Shifting up probably isn't the best solution because you might not get into the power band in that 15 meters. If you adjust the gear ratios, it might change the car's performance in other places on the track."

But actually often the final drive ratio should be adjusted first, it's possible there are other parts on the track he is only in a gear for a short period of time.  Other option: Try and reduce aero drag to minimum (that still works for the corners), and get on the power as early as possible on the corner before. It's possible you can extend the time 4th gear would be used."
pcars,3aroxg,WCR-jv27,1 point,Wed Jun 24 04:04:28 2015 UTC,You dont have to change gears if you dont want to. Short shift before hitting the limiter and then downshift for the turn.  5/1/94

I had been with them since 2011. To be honest, they are surprisingly transparent where a lot of decisions are made by the backers, like the backers voted that the game becomes a retail game instead of free to play now. At the same time, I get to see how a game is being made that explains a lot about some issues in game industry these days."
pcars,3aqa9a,fathed,6,Mon Jun 22 21:26:50 2015 UTC,"So, I'm a backer of the first game, but based on what I read there, I'm now disinterested.

It's not what I really funded, but still good. But I'm really glad I didn't read the forums.

Community development but only if we like what you say, glad I helped make it exist.   It is because you are being rude. Try calling your managers or teachers a dick in your work place or school and see what happens. You could try going to AC forums to call Kunos a dick for not giving you Bonus pack 1 ASAP. FYI, Kunos banned a lot of people for being rude or trolling when they first made their announcement on the console version. The entire forum was cleaned from trolls and troublemaker's thread was deleted in a few hours because trolls are calling AC an arcade game due to the fact that it is going to console.   There are some really rude people who posts on the forums these days. It is either you give the forum absolute freedom of speech that gives you a messy forum like majority of gaming forums out there. Or have harsh rules to keep everything in order.   If you are going to be rude in other people's forum, expect to be banned or warned.  I dont think I'll fund the sequel because I had enough of people judging a game before it is done while kept spreading false information about the game. I'll pass Reiza's crowd funding too for the same reason."

Don't defend the actions of a dick, you can say it's their forums, to which of course the response is, who pays for the forums?   Was I being a dick for suggesting I can vote with my money?  Please explain who the dick is here.  Trolls, yeah, upset customers, just call them trolls and move on, that only works a few times before people learn who the real trolls are.  Ohh, and if you read that linked thread, they ban people for politely saying be polite. The studio head seems to relish in banning people, responses of the word ""bye."", and ""I see your already banned"", to me implying he's a little sad he didn't get to do it, just don't sit well with me."
pcars,3aqa9a,smudi,3,Tue Jun 23 07:19:18 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's fair enough.  Many people are obviously happy with the route SMS has taken, and the ride they have been on as backers.  I do think though, that there is a pretty large discrepancy between what the backers hear from SMS and what the outsider gets to hear.  What the game was marketed as and described as, turned out different than what we were told.  For the backers, they got to see all the inner workings and what was going through the collective mind of SMS and see changes that were implemented.  I also think saying that SMS taking advice from the community and building the game with community support is a bit overstated.  Every sim has community support and advice that is given.  Many current sims while development is active.  AC, R3E, iR, rF2, GSCE, you name it.  They all have input from the community and the devs of each have discussions with their respective communities all the time.  This isnt really unique to pCARS.  The funding model is though.  In that sense though, SMS can do what they'd like as a studio, but this announcement sure has pissed off a lot of people."
pcars,3aqa9a,Cheesenium,3,Tue Jun 23 07:52:19 2015 UTC,"To be honest, I am not entirely happy with this announcement even though it was delayed quite considerably as the original was about 2 weeks or so after pCARS 1 gone gold. They are literally holding back the announcement until now while the profits will not be banked in to their accounts until August. They probably need some of the funding to keep their developers from twiddling their thumbs in the office.  The reason there is a huge discrepancy is a lot of bullshit that is happening now, like people getting banned left and right for being rude and entitled, happened a lot in WMD in it's first year where most troublemakers are being filtered out. The general experience of the whole crowd funding is pleasant and quite enlightening to see how a game is being made. There are issues with SMS, especially after Bandai came on board and also after a few leaks of information or even builds, SMS has become more and more reserved with potentially confidential information these days. They used trust the backers a lot more but it all takes one person to pull some bullshit to affect the relationship between SMS and a license holder.   Another reason for the discrepancy is, there are people out who are deliberately spreading false information about SMS or nitpicking on every little fault about the game, like how SMS's Huayra's tail lights looks different. At the same time, ignores every issue that their favourite game has because it is more fun supporting the underdog and cry foul of the bigger studio. Was the game marketed to be different from the final product? As far as I remembered, I pretty much got what was marketed or even pitched on 2011 which is a spiritual successor of GTR2 minus all the grinding or microtrasactions.  AC, R3E, iR, rF2, GSCE does take a lot of feedback from the community but the difference is, they never let you test their WIPs until it is released. pCARS used to have daily updates that you could slowly see the game being expanded on while a lot of feedback are taken seriously especially the first 2 years of the development. Backers are encourage to join into the development from bug testing to art asset to reference. Most cars and track in the current game, I had seen them in very rough and unfinished state, like how Spa used to be only a ribbon in the sky or some cars were added initially with no interiors. I actually think R3E, rF2 and possibly GSCE are moving towards a more open development style. AC on the other hand, I always find Kunos to be awful in PR and keeping their promise despite they make really good racing games. Good luck to Kunos in console development as 18 people isnt enough for a multiplatform game.  Reiza did has plans to do a WMD-like crowd funding model to fund GSCE's development. After the backlash with pCARS 2, I dont even know whether they want to do a crowd funding or I want to be part of it because I had enough from people judging a game that is in development with pCARS.  There are always things I never agree with SMS but generally, my crowd funding experience with them was far better than what I had with majority of my Kickstarter projects. SMS never go dark without any communication where some of the games I Kickstarted had gone quiet for months without any updates or blow thousands of dollars from crowd funding on parties on gaming conventions. Instead, SMS had pretty much diligently working on a game since 2011 with frequently communicate with us from the beginning.   pCARS 1 is not perfect but as long as they are continuing to patch the game, I am fine with them going ahead with pCARS 2 as this is the inconvenient truth on how the game industry works. I had no problems with another RPG developers, inXile did another crowd funding for Torment Tides of Numenera when their first crowd funded game, Wasteland 2 had just entered full production. Then, now, inXile started another crowd funding for another more ambitious RPG called Bard's Tale 4 while Torment isnt even close to release yet. I wont cry foul on SMS doing the same thing inXile does now because that is how the industry works. Either you start the development of your new game early to keep all your staff or lay off a portion of your employees.  Heck, no one complained about Marvel announcing all the Marvel Universe movies from 2015 till 2018 yet people are getting pissed with SMS doing a crowd funding for the next game that might not be even out on 2018."
pcars,3aqa9a,smudi,1 point,Tue Jun 23 05:28:37 2015 UTC,"The reason there is a huge discrepancy is a lot of bullshit that is happening now, like people getting banned left and right for being rude and entitled, happened a lot in WMD in it's first year where most troublemakers are being filtered out. The general experience of the whole crowd funding is pleasant and quite enlightening to see how a game is being made. There are issues with SMS, especially after Bandai came on board and also after a few leaks of information or even builds, SMS has become more and more reserved with potentially confidential information these days. They used trust the backers a lot more but it all takes one person to pull some bullshit to affect the relationship between SMS and a license holder.   I think keeping your ideas close to the chest isnt always a bad thing, and I suppose SMS has been more forthright and upfront about plans than say, Kunos in this regard, as well all know Kunos never speaks about anything beforehand ;)  Im not a back so I dont know the relations between SMS and the backers, so all I really know about the game came from media outlets, SMS themselves, and of course the opinions of those involved.  Although I always took those with a massive grain of salt because, well, they stood to gain from the game being successful.  To a degree of course.  Im interested to hear what the negativity towards Namco Bandai joining was.  I know nothing about any issues there.  Was the publisher somewhat demanding in what they wanted in the game and this took away some of the autonomy that the backers initially had?   Was the game marketed to be different from the final product? As far as I remembered, I pretty much got what was marketed or even pitched on 2011 which is a spiritual successor of GTR2 minus all the grinding or microtrasactions.   Well, that sounds perfectly correct to me.  Now, this is highly subjective and rather pedantic, but I could easily argue that the game wasnt what SMS initially billed it as.  A hardcore sim with the most advanced physics and best handling model, etc.  I think many people could agree the game came up short on numerous issues regarding physics/handling.  So, perhaps I overstated that the game was completely different than billed.  It's a sim, just not the sim we were told we would get.  Imo.  I agree though that people who spout off criticism on the forums that is nothing more than, ""Your game sux SMS, fix it naooo"" are worthless and needn't be responded to, however the criticism that is valid, shouldnt be shirked off.  Every dev has dumb comments on their forums, I just think SMS handles with those and legit concerns very poorly.   AC, R3E, iR, rF2, GSCE does take a lot of feedback from the community but the difference is, they never let you test their WIPs until it is released. pCARS used to have daily updates that you could slowly see the game being expanded on while a lot of feedback are taken seriously especially the first 2 years of the development. Backers are encourage to join into the development from bug testing to art asset to reference. Most cars and track in the current game, I had seen them in very rough and unfinished state, like how Spa used to be only a ribbon in the sky or some cars were added initially with no interiors. I actually think R3E, rF2 and possibly GSCE are moving towards a more open development style. AC on the other hand, I always find Kunos to be awful in PR and keeping their promise despite they make really good racing games. Good luck to Kunos in console development as 18 people isnt enough for a multiplatform game.   I think it could also be stated that other games also have people playing the WIP builds and bug testing, etc.  They just refer to them as beta-testers instead of backers.  Of course, the backers for pCARS is a pretty large amount, more than most sims beta-testers.  Honestly though, it would be pretty neat to see the development from an early WIP like you mentioned with spa, and the progression to the final product.  Haha, Kunos does seem to have a reputation of bad PR, but their product is quite high quality.  Disregarding what it lacks.  What is there is usually quite solid.  AC moving to consoles though is a whole different topic...  I hope they do well, because I love the game, but their team just seems too damn small to make it work in any sort of reasonable time frame.   Reiza did has plans to do a WMD-like crowd funding model to fund GSCE's development. After the backlash with pCARS 2, I dont even know whether they want to do a crowd funding or I want to be part of it because I had enough from people judging a game that is in development with pCARS. There are always things I never agree with SMS but generally, my crowd funding experience with them was far better than what I had with majority of my Kickstarter projects.

Instead, SMS had pretty much diligently working on a game since 2011 with frequently communicate with us from the beginning.   I think a good crowd funding result depends heavily on the devs.  SMS may have been rather successful at it, and good for them to make their game work, but I think other devs could make it work with better success and a happier customer base.  Reiza seems to me like they could.  They have a pretty good following and no one really speaks ill of them.     Heck, no one complained about Marvel announcing all the Marvel Universe movies from 2015 till 2018 yet people are getting pissed with SMS doing a crowd funding for the next game that might not be even out on 2018.   I think much of the criticism of this announcement stems simply from the fact that they just released pCARS, it feels quite incomplete and bugs are abundant (albeit minor in many instances), and the people who bought the game just feel shortchanged.  Ian Bell already said today that only 40 members of their team are being retained for pCARS (1) support.  So that is a clear sign that nothing much will change, when some things really need to.  People are pissed off that SMS is moving on without finishing what they promised.  That could be argued against, but the sentiment is there, and people arent so easily swayed by newfound fancy promises from SMS.  In any case, the first installment is enjoyable enough, although I have quite slowed down playing it already, and will continue to play it occasionally with some pals.  Good luck to SMS moving forward, as I would hate to see any sim racing dev struggle, but I can say that I wont be supporting them anymore.  They have done enough to dissuade my support, especially Ian Bell.  :p  Cheers, and thanks for the thoughtful response."
pcars,3aqa9a,klorptar,1 point,Tue Jun 23 07:09:15 2015 UTC,"That's absolutely true, but considering a lot of potential backers would be people also playing the first game, how many of those people do you think will be lining up to throw money at WMD? The first game is good, but still largely plagued by bugs and a lot of people are upset at the state it's in. I think asking for money right now is going to rub a lot of people the wrong way. I'm not in marketing, but it seems like it would have made more sense to iron out all the little bugs and glitches, and get the game polished, then ask for money."

I purchased the game, found it a bit poor, but held on to it thinking ""hey, they'll fix these issues, this game will eventually be amazing.""   So now, a studio that already seemed to lack resources to get things done on time and on quality are going to parallel path development on two games at one time with the same amount of resources??? The writing is on the wall, folks. We're stuck with the PCARS we've got."
pcars,3aqa9a,NeilJHopwood,7,Mon Jun 22 21:04:07 2015 UTC,"Why, because Ian don't want to lay off any of his employees? They are planning on supporting pCARS1 for at least 2 years.  The inital build of pCARS2 is very much not a game. its couple of cars and what amounts of a field with a we different surface types on it.   There is not even a way to race at the moment."
pcars,3aqa9a,chimpyman,-1,Tue Jun 23 14:56:10 2015 UTC,"why are people complaining about this. its not coming out for 2-3 years wtf does it matter with the steam sale. pcars is out, play the game.   THIS IS THE SAME AS EVERY COMPANY IN THE F**kING WORLD.   literally every single company in the world does this, its called planning ahead. you start designing the new game after the old one.   it just looks shitty because they are an actually company that has to get funding for the game by people. all other companies just get it so its not a big PR backlash."
pcars,3aqa9a,ConsuelaSaysNoNo,10,Mon Jun 22 18:40:05 2015 UTC,"We know it's not coming out this week.  So why did they feel the need to announce the game THIS early?

Game studios all over the world have one game they are releasing and another they are working on.  This is not new or different. Now, for people that helped fund the game, I can understand the frustration.

Forza 6 might had been still in development, I wont be surprised that Forza 7 is probably on pre-production prototype stage. Like it or not, this is how the industry works where developers start to pitch for funding for their next game when their current isnt even out yet to keep all their employees occupied with a project. Supporting a game does not need an entire studio as to develop a new game.   Typically, most companies arent going to say that they are working on a sequel when the current game was just released because there isnt any need to do so. SMS announce pCARS 2 because they would like to invite the previous WMD backers and also anyone who is interested in being a part of development from day 1. The very first build of pCARS 1 in 2011 was literally 2 tracks and 3 cars with place holder physics. It isnt like pCARS 2 will be out next year or something considering the amount of delays the first game had, the sequel will probably be out in 2018 or 2019 earliest.  I backed pCARS 1 and I doubt i'll back the second one because I am sick of the amount of misinformation out there deliberately to tarnish the developer.

Even if the fears turn out to be unfounded in the end it doesn't matter if they lose sales and backing for the seconds game.

pcars,3aqa9a,august_r,0,Tue Jun 23 16:54:53 2015 UTC,"didnt say you should. nor should you forza and iracing or forza and pcars. but overall you cant complain about pcars its a pretty decent car list, and its growing consistently."
pcars,3aqa9a,Stealth_Bummer,2,Tue Jun 23 17:30:58 2015 UTC,"Yeah, i mean, i really hoped pCars would take GT, AC and all of it's fans from such a high horse (i'm not talking about iRacing, their horse is as high as it gets). But it didn't, and that's terrible, and these news are even worse. This could've added something really new and fresh to the segment, but now.. nor is it as much of a sim as AC, the car roster is pretty random by the end of the day (I'm looking at your made-up cars SMS), so neither will GT fans give a shit. This game could've been literally a big reboot on the niche. But no. It has 2 redeeming factors though: Multiplayer Graphics IF ONLY the FFB was better FROM THE START (if i have to spend more than 5 minutes tinkering with sliders and .ini files, it's broken.), this would've been good. But no. Let's just infest it with DLC Or worse, as we are seeing now..."
pcars,3aqa9a,LiamRP,15,Tue Jun 23 20:00:01 2015 UTC,Bit of enlightenment for those baffled to the early announcement.   The announcement is for the WMD members to sign up to the development forums and is not your everyday announcement where they have a fully working game to show where they have been working in secret on a title straight after release and announce at a later date like other companies do. P C.A.R.S. just has a different model and the community has to be notified of the beginning instead of later to get involved.  Project  Community  Assisted  Racing   Simulator

pcars,3aqa9a,ShadowFlightBA,4,Mon Jun 22 17:38:28 2015 UTC,Are you even aware that pCARS 2 will probably be out in at least 3 years time? They had made very clear that SMS has no man power to push out another pCARS even as a biannual game.   The reason the crowd funding is announced is because they want to invite the interested backers to join into the development of the sequel on day 1.
pcars,3aqa9a,Cheesenium,7,Mon Jun 22 23:12:41 2015 UTC,"Of course I'm aware of that. I'm also aware that there is no reason for crowd funding at all, besides plain greed on their side, A studio that just made tens of millions with their game, should not ask for crowd funding. That is sending the completely wrong message. Sorry, not backing this and never will again."

pcars,3aqa9a,TheMaadMan,0,Tue Jun 23 01:54:38 2015 UTC,"Because they want funding as soon as possible. This doesn't mean the game will be out soon at all, in fact it will likely take 2 or 3 years before we see talk about release."

Sure he speaks with a lot of sarcasm on the pcars forums, but a lot of his comments just shows his character as a person.  Completely disregarding valid concerns and calling people idiots.  He is extremely childish.  Even going so far as threatening to inform the IP companies of his users that make 2nd accounts after he bans their first one for voicing their concerns.  This is all well documented and you needn't look any further than his own posts to determine that.  (link)  Not only that, but he chooses to alienate an entire demographic in one comment.  Speaking officially for SMS, (they) ""really dislike Nintendo users.""  (link)  This was in response to a very well thought out criticism from a user looking forward to the Wii U release that was promoted.  Which now isnt going to happen.  For this comment, the user was banned...  With this kind of language from Ian bell, you can see why he is disliked so fiercely.  Frankly, the whole pCARS forum is a massive shit show.  One of the absolute worst communities I have come across.  The fanboying is outrageous, and valid concerns swept under the rug as trolling, and those users voicing criticism are almost insta-banned.  Good riddance to SMS and Ian Bell.  Edit: fixed wrong link"

I just dont feel that is my battle to start.  There was a thread that was posted today on /r/wiiu and didnt gain much traction.  I think fans there are pissed off enough about the lack of info and non-existent release for their console.  This may help some move on entirely as theyll realize that supporting pcars is supporting that clown of a studio head, but there will be plenty that dont care.  It's almost a shame that the people who defend pcars and think that anyone talking ill of SMS or Ian are trolling, when they needn't look far to see why SMS has garnered such ill will.  SMS behavior is rather appalling at times for a company that wants to take my money while treating their customers the way they do..."

No, I've pretty much just been browsing around the official forum myself after the announcement was made today.   It's quite refreshing having game devs available on a public forum as it's quite rare to see these days   Another community I'm quite active in is Battlefield. The head producer of DICE LA, the studio responsible for the current development of BF4, is extremely communicative and respectful to the community. He does not permaban or mock people for complaining about things on the sub he helps moderate, even though DICE gets a much higher volume of hate than SMS. So if this Bell guy expects community members to maintain a professional attitude on the forum, he should try acting professional himself."

The difference is solely in how SMS acts on their forums.  It's disgusting.  There are plenty of examples of Ian Bell stepping out of line and being a dick just to quell criticism and calm discourse.  Look at him banning another using that is requesting Ian speaks more calmly to the users and with respect.  Perma banned... as well as the 2 users who like the comment that got the user banned.

Newsflash for everyone, being a game dev is like any other job. You come to work, write the code, do graphics or whatever, you get paid. When you don't have a game to make, there is no reason to keep you in the company, so you need to make NEW games that turn a profit so you don't go out of the job. Especially when this is a small company like 150 employees. Look at how many game studios working for major AAA publishers with shitloads of money get laid off the minute it turns out their games cannot bring expected profits.  If anyone thinks that game studios make one game and then take 2 months holidays after release, they live in some socialist utopia.  Here is an example, I know someone who worked at Witcher 3, on release day, they all received praises from management, there was some talk about bonuses being exceptionally fat and 5 minutes after that the boss told everyone to get to work on the next thing right this minute, cause the company can't afford to pay them for overtime to make the next release on schedule.  What Project CARS people did is completely normal and nothing new. They just screwed up the PR and now we have this discussions."

All those delays so they could ""make a perfect game"" yet its less then perfect.   I'm sure no one has any problems with them making another game but it just seems a little too soon to make one/ announce it.  For what its worth, I freaking love Project Cars.  Just wish they fixed all the bugs before going onto another thing. I will buy Project Cars 2."
pcars,3aqa9a,manlydishwasher,2,Tue Jun 23 12:42:51 2015 UTC,"They did announce it, because they want to start raising funds the same time development starts. From a PR standpoint and considering how whiny gamers can be, that was bad decision, but it's not like they have not been talking about it at all. CARS 2 was mentioned on several occasions already.  Best to just relax and wait a bit, I'm sure that further patches are coming for CARS 1. Personally I have not noticed any major bugs, maybe except the AI playing Mad Max every now and then, which I guess is typical for racing games today. I love how people get pissed about this  and CARS is unfinished and announce how they gonna buy Assetto Corsa - they have no idea lol.  My opinion on the matter is, if anyone feels outraged by anything simracing related, especially Project CARS, they need to stay the hell away from Reddit. This place is such a cesspool of bullshit controversy and speculation based on nothing, that I cannot even comprehend it.  The last major controversy here, was that CARS runs bad on AMD because the racing physics are based PhysX from Nvidia and the devs have been bribed by NV to purposely gimp AMD and this ca never be fixed. So hundred of AMD fanboys started to pur their hate not even bothering to check how racing games work, how they are made and that they have been feed a bunch of lies, by someone with an agenda.  So far we have seen nothing that would indicate that CARS 2 means no support for CARS 1 other than an assumption and a lot of strong opinions based on nothing.  Also, to everyone considering buying Assetto Corsa now, please do! As a big fan of AC I really want Kunos to raise enough money so they could get the game out of beta at some point. ;)"

I can sort or see how it might leave a bad taste but it's simply an announcement.   Anyone who follows the gaming industry knows the turn around is quick.   Also, if history is any indicator they will take their time making the game. How long did we know about Pcars1 before it finally released.   It should honestly just make people excited imo.   They seem to be very focused on continuing to deliver updates and content for the current release. It's never a bad idea to start planing/working/growing a new project."
pcars,3aqa9a,G2Wolf,0,Tue Jun 23 17:30:39 2015 UTC,What?... Why the hell don't they just build on Project CARS? It's been like 2 months since it released. Surely they can't have made any engine changes that can't be patched into the current game without any hassle...
pcars,3aqa9a,r3c14im3r,6,Mon Jun 22 22:14:08 2015 UTC,All they did was ANNOUNCE FUNDING for pcars2. Pcars2 isn't coming out for 2+ years.
pcars,3aqa9a,tchollinginthedeep,-5,Mon Jun 22 19:19:30 2015 UTC,They're still working on fixing pCARS1 and it will be fully supported by SMS with more content. Just because they're moving on to pCARS2 does not mean they are abandoning pCARS1... Why is this so hard to understand for so many people :(.
pcars,3aqa9a,r3c14im3r,17,Mon Jun 22 21:07:20 2015 UTC,"Because people who bought the game that just came out and is full of game breaking bugs probably want to hear the full focus of the studio is making sure they get what they paid for for more than six weeks.  I'm supertolerant, but even I find this just a bit over the top with the state the first installment is in."
pcars,3aqa9a,Cancerous86,2,Mon Jun 22 17:39:56 2015 UTC,"Well if you think they're leaving pCARS1 in the state it's in and if you think 100% of a gaming studio should be focused on bug fixing and content creation then don't fund pCARS2. It's a business and they're looking to the future.  T10 have released 5 iterations of FM, nobody complains when they start working on their next iteration weeks after a release and the same goes for PD's GT. It's ok for those guys to move on to the next step even when their current games could do with more content and fixes but not SMS who have more than once made it clear this will not mean they won't be focused with pCARS1, there's lots still to come from pCARS1 and it doesn't take an entire studio to fix bugs and create content."

When Forza or Gran Turismo have as many game breaking bugs as pCars did upon release, and still does, then maybe I'll entertain this comparison.  Otherwise, it's pure codswallop.  A cursory google search for ""project cars+glitch"" returned 379K results, all of the results on the first page are related to game breaking bugs.    Searching for ""forza 5+glitch"" returns 86,600 results, with ALL of the results on the first page related to ""infinite"" money glitches (bugs exploited to earn more in-game credits).   Now, I'm not going to say that this is a definitive, scientific method for determining how buggy a game is upon release, but it at least should give you some idea of how disparate the quality of pCars was/is compared to established ""Sim"" racing titles like Forza and Gran Turismo.   pCars is a buggy, broken game, and announcing a sequel when the original is in such a state is insulting and completely tone-deaf."

Yes, and if a business fails to meet the (understandable and reasonable) expectations of its consumer base, and is led by a man who openly ridicules and insults his customers, that business is going to receive significant backlash. Doubly so for a game development company- simply due to the nature of the industry.  I don't think people are upset that the studio is working on Project Cars 2. I think they're upset that SMS has the balls to ask for money to use for the sequel of their unfinished game- which already sold well, despite its shortcomings.  What I think people are really, really upset about though, is that they realize people are going to give SMS more money anyway."
pcars,3aqa9a,tchollinginthedeep,0,Mon Jun 22 18:58:04 2015 UTC,"Yes, it's a business. That's typically what game studios are, businesses. The nature of some of the consumers following the industry is down right disgusting. pCARS never failed to meet my expectations but maybe I just knew what to expect more than others and didn't fall for all the typical gaming industry jargon that game developers use when selling a game.  As someone purely interested in motorsport and racing rather than gaming I've really enjoyed pCARS and the direction its taken with its particular focus on motorsport and racecars. Underneath all the bugs which are being fixed with each patch that comes out there's a really great game there that I know I could enjoy especially if they keep adding more racecars to each discipline.   Could it be better? Well of course, every game out there could be better in one way or another. Is it broken? In some ways yes but not completely and 100% unplayable as some people make out but there are far too many ""workarounds"" required just now. Can I understand people being frustrated paying for it after almost demanding it was released? Yes I can. I'm not a complete idiot blindly following SMS but I've been able to enjoy a lot of this game too, all of a sudden that makes me the bad guy because a lot of people in the community feel the need to kick and scream until everything is fixed. They have rights and they want people to know. Fuck off is what I say to that obnoxious and childish behavior.  If you're told something is being fixed i'm sure you're mature enough to stop kicking and screaming and realize that continuing to do will get you nowhere. People have no fucking right what so ever to get upset at people who want to fund pCARS2, fuck off if you don't like it and support another game and studio instead of taking your frustrations out on people who are enjoying the game."

I will for sure buy vehicle and track DLC because this game is centered around becoming a better and faster driver with specific cars and tracks. That's the rewarding part of this game.

I know not everyone keeps up to date but the possibility of pCARS2 has been known about since before release and it was official after 1 week of pCARS release that it was happening.

If you read the announcement alone you could think that they are done with pCars 1 now, even though they already said now that they aren't. You are right, if they need the community for development it's good to anounce it early, but they blundered the name of the game and didn't mentioning parallel intensive work on pCars 1 in the announcement.

I understand PCARS 2 won't be out until 2017, but this is way too fast, and really makes me cast doubt upon the future of this IP.   On top of that, this makes me very hesitant to buy the second game. If this is purely a business move - as Ian Bell seems to be forming it - then it most likely isn't a good idea to make consumers feel alienated and not confident in your long-term strategy.

pcars,3aqhhr,fleaver12,-4,Tue Jun 23 00:50:11 2015 UTC,Read the tips so far and they're wrong.  Change your tire compound to a harder slick. Stop scrubbing on turns ( turning more then you have to). Brake enough to make the turn you're trying to attack. Also camber adjustments and tire pressure might help only after you change your tire compound. If you are using a controller learn to take it easy and try to be smooth with your movements. If you can't afford a wheel buy a joystick extender.
pcars,3aqhhr,SpxUmadBroYolo,3,Mon Jun 22 23:33:49 2015 UTC,The problem is though. Is that my tired will go from green to red BEFORE I even make it to the first turn.  I did a test last night where I change tires during pit and on the first turn I kept the speed between 20-25 mph. They still went red in the middle of the first turn.
pcars,3aqhhr,fleaver12,-4,Tue Jun 23 01:13:14 2015 UTC,You need a harder compound tire.
pcars,3aqhhr,SpxUmadBroYolo,2,Tue Jun 23 01:29:34 2015 UTC,Thynis is trying to explain that he is not pushing his tires too hard. He is experiencing a well known glitch. No amount of tuning or changing his driving style will affect the glitch.
pcars,3aqhhr,fleaver12,-5,Tue Jun 23 01:52:19 2015 UTC,There is no glitch
pcars,3aqhhr,OiNinja-,1 point,Tue Jun 23 02:36:34 2015 UTC,"You're totally allowed to believe that, but you're wrong.  Many, many people are experiencing this: Enter pits, change tires, exit pits, 5-10 seconds later all four tires are red, 20-30 seconds later all four tires are over 350 degrees F, regardless of how slow they drive.  Compound has absolutely nothing to do with it."
pcars,3aqhhr,SpxUmadBroYolo,1 point,Tue Jun 23 04:53:56 2015 UTC,That's because they didn't change their pit strategy. If you go into pit strategy there are settings for each tire you have to make sure you change each on to the right tire and right bar. If you're not doing that that's that problem. Alot of people are experiencing it because their not looking at the damn settings and just want to blame the game because it's easier.
pcars,3aqhhr,OiNinja-,1 point,Tue Jun 23 13:09:07 2015 UTC,"First off, no compound will overheat that much within 30 seconds. I agree that the pressure is sometimes the issue. I have come out of the pits on four flat tires; the game set it to 1.0 Bar on it's own.  However, I have also come out of the pits in the rain, with appropriate pressure, and had my tires over 300 degrees F within seconds. There is no logical explanation for that other than a glitch (unless you can show me a real life example of tires overheating in heavy rain). This can happen regardless of compound or pressure settings.  I have also learned that it is possible to overheat your tires by having your suspension too soft for your ride height. This can cause the tires to rub the wheel wells, resulting in extremely high temps. This will not be caused suddenly by using the pits, though.  It can be a tuning issue, in extreme cases. But most of the time, it is a problem with the game."
pcars,3aqg3k,daBandersnatch,2,Mon Jun 22 17:53:28 2015 UTC,"I drove that car in free practice for hours on Zolder. It's difficult as hell. my advice is to drive it slower than you think you should, break earlier than you think you should, and never go full throttle unless the wheel is centred. this car is too damn hard to drive and it got more power than it should have. after that car though, almost every other car is really easy to get used to drive (for me anyways).  good luck!"

I only figured it out when I realized that the car has no traction control, stability control, or ABS. I was so used to driving cars with those aids that I had to completely re-think my driving technique this car.   Like you said, brake early and ease on the throttle (especially if the wheel is turned). I'd never floored it unless I was on a straight and in at least 3rd gear.  I'm using a wheel. I can't imagine trying to drive this car with a controller. I realize that's no help to the OP who's playing on a PS4 with a controller.

Anyway, once the patch came out idk what happened but despite my car set up being the same the car went to absolute shit. It felt like starting from scratch all over again with the set up.   But I actually just bought a wheel yesterday and it's been shipped today. I was so frustrated after the patch that I just haven't played. Plan on playing the shit out of it once my wheel arrives.

pcars,3aqpoi,401InvalidUsername,6,Tue Jun 23 08:22:17 2015 UTC,"That's your opinion. I hate when people make it sound so simple. Yes, there is a lot of turning left but it's not as though they are flat footing it around most of the tracks. Most of the time, these cars are on the edge of plowing into a wall at 180mph+. Just a few degrees of oversteering a Nascar could be the difference between a good turn or a trashed car. Don't downplay Nascar just because they don't drive on road courses every week. (which I can argue how boring that is as well in some race series). It's still a very technical form of motorsports that requires a lot finesse to be competitive."
pcars,3aqpoi,aidub5,4,Tue Jun 23 16:03:08 2015 UTC,"Now, I might just start a flame war here, but I really, really don't like NASCAR.   No, not because of its redneck popularity or because of the whole 'murrica reference it's always featured in, but rather because NASCAR is just motorsport dumbed down and made into a spectator sport. Of course, it's still challenging and intense and takes finesse from drivers and manufacturers, but at its core, it isn't a sport, it's a show.   Even if you look at the history of it, the regulations behind the sport, or even watch a race one of these days, it becomes apparent that its target purpose is entertainment (and mind you it, is is very entertaining, especially for the people sitting at the race itself).  The cars are very simple, have very little safety devices, very little fine tuned details that you see in other classes (even the similar indycar). When it comes down to it, it's like a monster truck show; fun, exciting, but come on. The vehicles they use are just roll-cages covered in sheet metal and with a massive engine at the front. So little has changed in the design and engineering innovation behind the vehicles. Look at F1: the cars had gone through so much changes over the years and every little crease in the car was designed by leading engineers.   Look at F1, WEC, WRC, all of these and many more motorsport disciplines feature cars and teams that are so fine tuned and made specifically to take on a challenge of human skill, and engineering expertise. Motorsport is the accumulated history of engineers and drivers trying to conquer a challenge by doing it better than everyone else; a feat that requires amazing fine tuned machines and expert drivers. What is NASCAR conquering? The oval? The limit of human endurance? I'll tell you what: it's conquering the TV, and conquering people's wallets."
pcars,3aqpoi,banana-skeleton,1 point,Wed Jun 24 01:44:56 2015 UTC,"I guess it depends on what you're in to. Would you rather see drivers win races or would you rather not see the engineers who win the races.   You're right, Nascar is all about entertainment but does that mean it's not a competitive fun series to watch? No. Every sport has it's hardcore fans who want to see some good competitive racing and on the other side, every sport has it's fans that just go to the races to have a good time and could care less who wins. Yes, even F1 has these types.  Yes, Nascars are pretty simple cars but that's the way they're supposed to be as they emulate production vehicles. To me, F1 changing their cars every year just to gain what, .001 seconds on the track is just ridiculous and is the reason you see the same teams win every event. It's way too much of a money game behind the scenes that unfortunately dictates the outcomes of the races which is the worst part about F1. Call me nuts, but I'm a fan of spec racing for one reason. The outcomes are all based on driver talent most of the time which, to me, is far more impressive than a new fin on the side pod of a car that shaves a 10th off of lap times. There is no emotional connection with that fin like there is with a driver. The essence of entertainment is the connection to the drivers which F1 severely lacks and Nascar masters."
pcars,3aqpoi,aidub5,0,Wed Jun 24 15:02:10 2015 UTC,"You've illustrated it perfectly. Nascar is for simpletons, while F1 is for those who are just as interested in the engineering aspect as they are in the drivers and entertainment."
pcars,3aqpoi,401InvalidUsername,1 point,Wed Jun 24 21:15:49 2015 UTC,"Really? You're just as interested in the ""engineering aspect"" of racing as the racing itself? Get a life man! I mean I can appreciate the engineering side of the sport, don't get me wrong, but I certainly don't get off on seeing a perfectly engineered control arm or a tiny aero fin that is obscurely placed to make an otherwise sexy sleek car the Quasimodo of the race track just for a few thousands of a second.  If that makes me a simpleton then so be it. I've got much much more important things to fill my head with. Just give me a good race. Absolutely no need to complicate it with a bunch tech that takes the competitiveness out of the driver's hands and puts it into the machines. Why even have drivers at all right?... smh"
pcars,3aqpoi,aidub5,-7,Wed Jun 24 22:12:49 2015 UTC,"Finesse? Please. Nascar only has left turns aided by a huge bank angle, the cars are laughably ugly (LOL @ the fake headlight stickers), little regard for technical innovation (ex. in terms of downforce, or the fact that they only replaced the carburetors in 2012), etc. The cars have been nearly identical for decades. Everything about Nascar is designed for kids, and fake fans who are only there to get drunk and don't actually care about the sport. It is the exact opposite of 'very technical'. I suggest you look up the definition of the word before applying it to something like Nascar next time."
pcars,3aqpoi,401InvalidUsername,2,Tue Jun 23 17:25:54 2015 UTC,"Please... Ask Juan Montoya which is more difficult. Or Scott Speed. Or any number of the open wheel guys who tried their hand at Nascar. For guys who drove in supposedly superior series to Nascar, they sure did a whole lot of nothing when they made the jump. But they're just ovals with a bunch of left turns right? Should be easy to come from highly technical million dollar machines and dominate such an easy form of racing right? My friend, I think you need to learn a little about how these cars are driven before you pass judgement. I get it if it's not your cup a tea to watch them ""make left turns"" but don't downplay the difficulty."
pcars,3aqpoi,aidub5,-6,Tue Jun 23 17:58:35 2015 UTC,"Your logic is so flawed, it's laughable. It doesn't matter how little technicality is there is to Nascar. The amount of time Nascar drivers spent practicing would obviously make them superior to the open wheel drivers at their sport. That says nothing about the simplicity of Nascar compared to open wheel. But hey, if you love supporting a family owned sport with a bunch of ugly cars with childish light decals going around banked left turns, then by all means, go ahead."
pcars,3aqpoi,401InvalidUsername,1 point,Tue Jun 23 19:50:38 2015 UTC,"How is it simple if the guys with more practice are better at it? Talk about flawed logic.

I don't like nascar either but please at least put some thought into your criticism."

By the other guy's logic, this should be impossible, since the astrophysicist has the undeniably more complex work. By the same token, a Nascar driver will drive a Nascar better than an F1 driver. That says nothing about the complexity (or the lack thereof) of Nascar. Would you like more examples, or do you understand how my 'terrible argument' is simply one that went way over your head?"
pcars,3aqpoi,401InvalidUsername,0,Wed Jun 24 05:53:56 2015 UTC,"There's a big difference between a 6th grade history test and astrophysics. What's the big difference between a Nascar and an F1 car? I'll give you weight, aero dynamics and a few other details but at the end of the day, they are both cars on 4 wheels The concept is the same. Your comparison is apples and oranges. F1 and Nascar is gala apples and granny smith apples. Hope that doesn't go too far over YOUR head.   And to make your point even more invalid, lets focus on one driver in particular that I referenced earlier. Juan Montoya had spent almost 10 years in Nascar, longer than any other form of racing he competed in. 10 years and he could only muster an average points finish of 19th even though he did far better in F1 and Indycar. Why is that? He had plenty of time in Nascar to learn the cars and how to drive them yet he still didn't excel. Nascar is far more competitive because it takes all that fancy tech out that assists the drivers like he's been used to in F1 and Indycar and it absolutely showed when he tried his hand at it. It's not just him either. A.J. Allmendinger, Dario Franchitti, Sam Hornish Jr., Jacques Villenueve and Scott Speed to name a few. Why can't these superstar open wheel drivers make in Nascar? I'm eager to hear your excuse?"

In GRID (the first one) whenever I went into a corner or got in a large group of cars it was like the simulation speed was rubber-banding all over the place.  Turns out it was because my laptop (Asus g73) has this ""CPU TurboBoost"" feature or something like that. When it's on, you're at the max CPU multiplier. I had it turned off which meant my multiplier was changing all the time and apparently this changed the simulation speed of the game. Turning the turbo mode on completely fixed it.  I know this wasn't about Project Cars, but I hope it helps in some way."

Way too small of a cars list still and I don't see that growing much now that development is being split between PCARS1 and 2 with 2 getting the greater amount of developers. With the big picture and what moves they're making and how soon they're making them with a new game already being developed, it's clear the success of PCARS1 has them thinking PCARS2 is an easy cash cow.   No. Just no. They won't get my backing this time. PCARS1 is far from finished still :(."

Also the banning if you disagree is complete bollocks (I have made pointys about problems when the game was new and am still a forum user). The loud ones that report that they were banned for no reason are in fact trolls that are posting the same things under different user names (which SMS check IP addresses of) then kick them out. Many others that think they have been unfairly treated bring hostility to the argument and they get cleaned out quickly. The sarcastic ones get the same treatment which is a little bit much but they still bring some form of shitty attitude. If you have a genuine complaint then do it like an adult, its not hard at all  I have complained about the game on release. I didnt moan I asked what might be wrong and I got decent responses  TLDR SMS can and will cut out miserable posters whom troll and try to start flame wars. They dont do what Steam forums did,which was nothing (and look how they turned out) but There are some cases where I wonder if bans were unjustified."

I don't complain about their lazy work anymore, because i know they will do nothing but ban me. If they don't like that people are complaining, they should've tested the game before release. Maybe they should fix the game by releasing the patches faster? Banning everyone who do not praise their game doesn't make the game bug free. They need to acknowledge they've fucked up and release the official statement that they're sorry for such mess and they'll do everything to fix it as soon as possible.

People are choosing to be angry with SMS and Pcars. Its insanity at its finest, hive mind mentality. Im not sure most people actually realise what they are angry about.  Your reply isnt whiney or directly hostile you wouldn't be banned for that, The bannings are being taken out of context and cherry picked over and over. Some users genuinely start out with a complaint or prblem but if they get aggressive or shitty as many of the banned users have become that is what leads them to be banned not simply criticising the game.   Ian & some of the sms employees make the mistake of getting cocky or sarcastic towards trollers or people that are being angry which some of us WMD members are asking them to stop as its only adding fuel to the already huge fire many have taken upon themselves to light under this game and its employees"

As in real life, the race career calendar is set in stone, if it rained that day, it rains for all of us on that day.  2) You could change the number of laps from 4-5 to something that makes more sense. I prefer 100% which turns out to be 10-12 laps depending on the series and race.  3) Your crew chief picks the best set of tires for you. If you roll out on dries, and it starts raining, assume it is going to stop in a  lap or two, dry out, then rain on a portion of the track only, then clear up again, so you just need to drive within the limits while its wet.

That's just lazy coding and overly willing to show the ""main feature: dynamic weather"" (I've got told that from that main guy himself.   I like some rain here or there, but in any championship, unless an extremely unlucky set of reasons, there's no way there's 8 straight races on rain. Not ever.

One of the problem (that apparently are going to be fixed on patch 2.0 but said fixed on previous patch) is that AI won't slow on wet; on a short race (3-4 laps on many invitationals) you can't pit, doing so will send you at the back of the pack, and you have to slow down to keep yourself in the track while AI goes around you like they are on tracks."

I literally stopped playing the career because I cant cope with rain well for most cars. I just kept playing lengthy 30 to 2 hours Quick Race to learn the ropes of the game which at the end, I dont even care about career anymore."
pcars,3aori2,SHIT-OUT-MY-ASS,3,Mon Jun 22 08:07:19 2015 UTC,"I was getting really frustrated. I had 6 straight race with rain, 3 of them ruined because of it since you can't even select wet tyres from the beginning.   Some years ago I did some coding for tracks and AI cars, I know it's hard work, but it really ""blew my mind"" to hear it would take 4 months to implement such tiny change. As I said, I know is hard work, but there's no way it can take so much time just to take out the rain or even to add a custom championship option."
pcars,3aori2,jmkreth,2,Mon Jun 22 10:29:33 2015 UTC,"That 4 months of coding is worth it too since racing in the rain with AI is broken anyway, 4 months of adding a weather toggle is probably way easier than fixing a broken physics model."

I find switching that off helps with more games than just pCARS. Also hard reset the console and clearing the cache seems to help some people too.  The sound bugs on Xbox One are a known issue by the devs and they're working on optimizing the game more & more to help with this. For now it's recomended to clear the cache by hard resetting your console before playing pCARS and turning the instant on feature for your xbox off for a more stable experience."

pcars,3amr1e,Lewis_Hashbrown,4,Wed Jun 24 13:40:56 2015 UTC,"You'll find that well balanced cars (I.E. GT3/4, Formula anything, LMP1-2) all have very similar braking points. If you learn a track in any of these you should be in good shape. The ones that are hard to judge are the big horsepower street cars that don't have the grip to match their punch. If you learn a track in one of the cars I mentioned you should be able to drive pretty much any race car on them without things being totally different from what you know. Go by feel at first, not what the speedometer says. Your speeds around the track will vary greatly from car to car but what won't change much is your technique.  Also a rear engined Porche will have a much more sluggish feeling turn in but a great corner exit due to the large rotational mass on the rear of the car. A front engined vehicle will have the opposite feeling. It takes time to get used to but with enough time you will become pretty comfortable with anything you jump into. Although if your totally comfortable your not pushing hard enough!  Start yourself off in something kind of slow. Formula Gulf is a good spot for open wheel, GT4 for touring, Road B if you mess with road at all. (I personally don't very often) but if you learn to be fast in a slow car you'll be fast in anything. Learn to be fast in a fast car and you'll only be fast in fast cars."

pcars,3alfwp,coneillcodes,2,Sun Jun 21 12:31:37 2015 UTC,Weird I haven't had any problems with my g27 while playing. I have run into a glitch though where all the sudden my steering lock will be like 2 degrees and the slightest wheel movement sends me careening. But overall the car feedback seems pretty good from the FFB.
pcars,3alfwp,Elemento1991,1 point,Sun Jun 21 12:46:47 2015 UTC,What is your FFB strength and tire force set at? If you max out the motors you will be losing all the feel because they can't provide any change in force. Also make sure your centering spring is turned off. I run 100 FFB and 80 tire force. Any higher than that you input signal starts clipping just like in music whenever the volume gets too high it starts popping and crackling.
pcars,3alfwp,nycska,1 point,Sun Jun 21 17:14:53 2015 UTC,"I think that guide is from pre-1.4? Try this:  FFB 100%  Tire Force 100%  Deadzone removal .04  Master spindle per car 4-6   This feels better than lowering tire force and raising master spindle for each car back to 26, or around default. Technically most G27s need more deadzone removal, but the wheel gets too strong at something like .18, I was happy at .04  Make sure the G27 profiler is set to 900, 100/100/100, Centering spring checked, but 0%. Also make sure that when you calibrate the rotation in game, actually turn it 90 degrees instead of turning in until it hits 900. That felt much better to me as well.  Also make sure to check for clipping when you are setting master spindle ""volume"" and deadzone removal. Use the HUD and watch the yellow line. Flat line in the turns = clipping."
pcars,3alsrt,Flinkergut,2,Sun Jun 21 13:58:28 2015 UTC,"Remove the throttle deadzone from the controller and press it gradually. If you suddenly press it the car will spin. It's not just the Formula A, but also some other cars like the BMW touring one."
pcars,3alsrt,tecHydro,2,Sun Jun 21 16:14:49 2015 UTC,All I can suggest is taking a long hard look at the setup. Take the car to a good test track and spend a good hour or so fixing it.
pcars,3alsrt,Swinnyjr,1 point,Sun Jun 21 14:13:58 2015 UTC,"As /u/Swinnyjr said, take a long hard look at your setups. It may be a simple problem like incorrect suspension stiffness or softness.  To increase over steer, increase front aerodynamics. And decrease rear aerodynamics. Followed by decreased front tire pressure, and increased rear tire pressure. This is just the basics but will help with under steer. Reverse all this to make the car under steer. If you are a bit more advanced have a look at the slow bump > slow rebound > fast bump > fast rebound.   To address traction. Have a fiddle with the acceleration  lock and traction control slip setting. I usually tend to aim around 7% for traction control slip.   Another issue maybe that you are going to hard on the acceleration which is causing the car to spin. Ease on the throttle as you are coming out of a corner as this isn't a go kart."
pcars,3alsrt,Dettol_hand_wash,2,Sun Jun 21 16:35:27 2015 UTC,"FA is one of the easiest cars to drive in my opinion. Just abuse the hell out of its amazing aero. If you're drifting out of corners, you're probably turning in to the turn too much."
pcars,3alsrt,Tylensus,4,Sun Jun 21 15:21:56 2015 UTC,FA is easy to drive once you get going off the line. When its in first or second gear it can be tricky and easily get away from someone and spin.
pcars,3alsrt,G2Wolf,2,Sun Jun 21 15:26:56 2015 UTC,"That's fair, yeah, but throttle control right off the line is a cakewalk. Throttle control coming out of a turn can be tough, but usually I just give it half throttle after gliding through a corner and get away with it just fine. If you want a real challenge, try driving the Lotus 98 turbo with 6 bar on the turbo. That shit is straight up insane. I'd wager it's nearly undriveable in the rain."

I've only ever driven the 98 on Road America, and even after 4 hours or so of practicing in the dry, I can't get a totally clean lap in. That throttle just bites like a crocodile, man. Absolutely the most entertaining car to drive in the game as far as I'm concerned. I always like the feeling of pressing the throttle just a little further and knowing that there's always more there. That feeling of pushing it just a little further, consequences be damned, is the most thrilling part of driving for me."

pcars,3alsrt,saippua,2,Sun Jun 21 14:56:10 2015 UTC,At least for me the formula A is really difficult to drive on a controller since you need to be so smooth with the steering and careful with the throttle or you'll lose the rear end and after that theres usually nothing you can do to save it.  I spent like half an hour practicing with first the formula C and then B before i could even complete a lap in A without spinning.
pcars,3alsrt,skippy2893,1 point,Sun Jun 21 15:26:31 2015 UTC,"Go to Monza and race for an hour against AI.  There are a decent amount of chicanes and some easy turns to practice on.  Others have mentioned the car setup which is mostly accurate, but the biggest issue with Formula A is that there's too much power.  You can't floor it out of a turn because you will spin tires everytime and if you have a controller it's very difficult to ease onto the gas.  Just get some practice at using the proper amount of acceleration on each type of turn and you will be fine even with a default car setup.  Also once your tires warm up you will be able to punch it out of a corner much easier since you have more grip."
pcars,3alsrt,skippy2893,2,Sun Jun 21 17:30:52 2015 UTC,"ok but what do i do in the start of the race when i need to accelerate? i spin out every time, do i still need to ease into it? otherwise thanks this is brilliant advice"

I'm sure that it is something that can be worked out with some car tuning, but if you just go half throttle until the car starts moving you will be alright. Just remember not to crank the wheel while your tires spin because it will only make them spin more and you will surely go off track."

Shortly after I bought the digital deluxe edition of the game plus the one DLC that wasn't included, I was apprehensive about having made a mistake.   Thankfully, I haven't experienced any of the nightmare issues others with AMD cards have. But, I've also been considerate about which graphics features I've enabled. Most are on medium. I've been playing at full screen 1680x1050 and haven't had any issues. I'll probably continue to experiment with higher level features to see how it affects gameplay.   I haven't been tracking FPS in the game, though, either. Most of my assessment has been with what I see."

pcars,3afbya,RomanCessna,1 point,Sat Jun 20 14:25:06 2015 UTC,"Well, I cannot give you a good answer, because I didn't use any other wheel nor have I much experience with different games. Pcars and the G27 for me is a very good fit though. I also played DiRT rally which is so much fun, too. I also tried F1 2013 for half an hour, but that was a very arcardish feeling.  I got mine from ebay for €130 so I was lucky. I still think the full price is worth it, if you consider racing on the pc as your hobby.  It is a solid piece of hardware, feels good in the hand and has force feedback, which (depending on the game you play) gives you a great feeling of what's happening with your car on the track. I comes with gears (6 + reverse) and a clutch which for me personally is great, because I don't have a license and never officially drove a real car. :D  If you have any question in particular, let me know."
pcars,3afbya,eXtr3m0,1 point,Sat Jun 20 14:53:21 2015 UTC,"The main problem I have is that the wheel is so expensive, about 260 Euros, but I have a wheel to return to them so I would have to pay only about 180 Euros. The thing is, I still think that is mad expensive. I am trying to look at other options but there are a little amount of wheels my store offers. I am downloading PCars right now and I am liking this PC gaming that I am quite new to, but I am nto sure about the price. I found another wheel Logitech Driving Force GT Gran Turismo which would cost me 48 Euros, but it will not have that many features...   Essentially it is this: I have Rfactor with F1 mods and PCars downloading now. I am mainly an F1 fan, havent tried any other racing series in a videogame. I want to get a quality wheel with force feedback and preferably those shifters behind the wheel. Not sure what to get, G27 seems too expensive with Logitech Driving Force GT Gran Turismo about the right price, but not sure about the amount of features. Thanks"
pcars,3afbya,RomanCessna,1 point,Sat Jun 20 15:09:36 2015 UTC,You cant find a better wheel for this Price and the amount of Extras. Take a look at the Thrustmaster-Wheels. They are more expensive than a Logitech one and dont have a clutch and a shiffter. So you get the  most with the G27.
pcars,3afbya,DERREZZ,1 point,Sun Jun 21 14:02:57 2015 UTC,"Yes, but I am not sure if it is reasonable to spend 180 Euros for the G27 or if I should just get the Driving Force GT  for 48 Euros, considering such a price difference. Is there anything major that would make me really want to buy the G27? (those prices are the ones I would have to pay, I am returning a wheel I already have worth 80 Euros)"
pcars,3afbya,RomanCessna,1 point,Sun Jun 21 14:09:08 2015 UTC,"Its your choice at the End. If you want a Wheel with a Clutch and Shifter which you can set up everywhere then the G27. The Driving Force GT has no Clutch and the Shifter is mounted on the Wheelbase. The G27 looks better from Qualityside. It has a Metal wheel and Gas/Brake. This looks much better in my Opinion. And you can feel the FFB trough the G27 much better because it has 2 FFB-Motors. Its your Choice dude. Are you more the "" i only play Racing Simulations- Player then the G27. If you like to play Games with Wheel instead of Controller or Keyboard and dont play Games like that often then take the Driving Force GT"
pcars,3afbya,DERREZZ,1 point,Sun Jun 21 19:37:45 2015 UTC,"""Its your choice at the End."" That is what I dislike sometimes, becuase I don't know which one :D I played wit ha controller 90% of the time o nthe 360, but now I switched to the PC and have Rfactor and PCars (which I can't sadly play right now because I don't have a functioning wheel) and I don't have a controller for those. I am an F1 fan but I am trying many different games. Is the G27 a really high quality wheel and does it last a long time?"
pcars,3afbya,RomanCessna,1 point,Sun Jun 21 19:47:48 2015 UTC,Yes it is. Only Thing which is made of plastic is the Shifter. Everything else is high quality. Buy it from Ebay or something like that. Most of them go away for 120-130 €. Even  if the Wheel-Leather is in a bad condition you can buy a new wheel for 39 €. Only the wheel without the base i mean. Its your choice at the End :P But i recommend buy a used one from Ebay.

Bought PCars yesterday (physical copy sale) and I'm having a blast, even with my controller. Tracks and cars are well done, day/night and weather cycle is just great. The tuning options are great enough to get you up to a few seconds per lap. The career may not be the edge in terms of presentation, but is good enough to motivate you to reach higher leagues.  Only downside for me is the false ""multi-class racing"". I'm a huge fan of the WEC (a reason why I sticked to Grid so long) and while the LMP1/2 cars are nicely done, GT cars are available in larger numbers, they do not enable you to put Prototypes and GT together on the track. There is multi-class, but that is restricted to either prototypes or GT cars.  I didn't try MP yet, but even with a single day in PCars I got the feeling that I may ditch Grid now in favor of an even better sucessor, and this time not just in the arcade departement but also in the sim again..."

I would compare it to FIFA, you might start with Barcelona directly or work your way up through the lower leagues. For the 2nd way they have 8 ""tiers"", starting from carts up to LMP1 in which you have to do well to get invitations to higher leagues and different racing series. But my guess is that you'll need some 10+ to complete everything."

pcars,3afbya,AlexisFR,2,Sat Jun 20 13:49:30 2015 UTC,"Didn't encounter any bug yet, but for a trustworthy response you need someone with more experience and much more playtime.  In terms of gameplay it is in a very good state and offers many things other contenders (excluding Asseto Corsa from them) do not have, e.g. pit stops, rolling starts, up to 56 cars on the track, dynamic weather etc. And don't forget the ""racing weekend"", with training, qualifying and the race. You can skip all these things if you just want to hop in, but you can do the full program.  About the AI I do not have an opinion yet, sometimes it looks a bit passive, other times aggressive, other times well balanced.

pcars,3afbya,ShlawsonSays,3,Fri Jun 19 22:35:10 2015 UTC,I think they just refund the difference. Instead you could buy an extra copy as a gift and redeem it after the first is refunded. But I'd look into it more.

pcars,3ajpp9,Nomnom_downvotes,3,Sun Jun 21 00:14:28 2015 UTC,Agreed. It's one bug within a month or so of the game being released. If you give up on games that easily then you should seriously consider on how often you buy games or what games you buy. The game is still new. It will be fixed. Just like any other game in the history of games.  Come back and play later.

They dont land after one another from left to right (or vice versa), but simultaneously. Its completely irrelevant that the wiper was there a second ago. The wipers dont apply some sort of shield. The very second the wiper has gone over the widow, a new drop lands. Seeing how tehy struggle to make it perform reasonable, this optimization might help in that regard as well. Driveclub (although otherwise not my cup of tea, to say it nively), almost nailed it. The drops might be overall a bit too big, but the effects are fantastic otherwise"

pcars,3afway,CannedEther,6,Sat Jun 20 18:22:54 2015 UTC,"I believe Assetto Corsa gives a much more authentic experience. Comparing how the grip levels of tires on the edge versus what I've experienced on a track day, AC feels just that tad bit more realistic. AC also had more mods.  Project Cars it seems a bit more easier to drive and not lock up the tires.   That being said, project cars UI, ease of racing, weather and career mode has me playing project cars more often."
pcars,3afway,InZomnia365,1 point,Sat Jun 20 03:29:25 2015 UTC,"I fully agree with this. For me, pcars is a racing simulator while AC is a hot lap simulator. I spend way more time on pcars."
pcars,3afway,RobsZombies,1 point,Sat Jun 20 09:58:19 2015 UTC,"Ditto. AC is a more authentic experience, but PCars is still close enough that the weather effects and base content keeps my playing it more often than AC.  I play AC when  I wanna hardcore sim hotlap. I play PCars when I wanna take a LMP1 car  to Monaco in a thunderstorm."
pcars,3afway,Elemento1991,4,Sat Jun 20 13:34:04 2015 UTC,why not both.
pcars,3afway,G2Wolf,3,Sat Jun 20 00:18:13 2015 UTC,"Project cars feels more polished and is a more complete overall package, it's also where I do my league racing. I feel more immersed when playing it than other sims. However it is buggy as all hell. Some of the bugs are game breaking. I lost a race due to a bug a few league races back.   Project cars also somewhat lacks in physics, I think they are pretty good but sometimes it seems like the cars just do wacky things. Driving formula 1 the other day at spa coming through eau(?) rouge I spun the tires at the crest and oversteered. The car spun 90 degrees at 180 mph and I recovered without going into a wall and went back down the straight away. That's just not possible lol.  Assetto Corsa has much superior force feedback and feel. In assetto I always know when the tires are near their limit, I can even feel when I'm at the braking threshold in a straight line. Project cars FFB sometimes leaves me guessing, I can tell when I'm under steering and have pushed the car too hard but the threshold braking is kind of a shot in the dark.  All in all Pcars for more polished game, great car and track combos at the cost of Assetto Corsa's great physics and FFB and less buggy experience.   Also weather and nighttime racing are pretty cool. A lot of people say it will be a novelty that will wear off but I am still enjoying the added dynamic it adds."

He didn't spin back towards his original path which is what I was getting at. It was just an example anyways, I've experienced other odd physics as well, one time the car started rolling over at 30 mph as I was trying to stop to correct a glitch. I like project cars and the physics are really good. Definitely on par or better than Forza and Gran Turismo in my opinion. I just don't think they can hang with Assetto Corsa and I'm ok with that. I still very thoroughly enjoy the game."

pcars,3adwhd,ChammaBrothers,1 point,Fri Jun 19 13:20:27 2015 UTC,"Had a G27 and now have a T300. I'd say the G27 is great because you get evrything, making it way cheaper than a T300 with shifter and T3PA pedals. So if you're tighter on money, get the G27. With all add-ons though, the T300 is superior when it comes to FFB as well as overall 'plug in & play'"

pcars,3aemls,-Oggy-,20,Fri Jun 19 14:29:23 2015 UTC,It's not ideal obviously but the core of the game is enjoyable. I've been in races where people have crashed into invisible walls and things but I haven't actually experienced any bugs myself. Stuff like that just gets a lot more video hits than someone like me uploading 100 hours of glitch free gameplay.
pcars,3aemls,lookoutblorgons,3,Fri Jun 19 14:35:37 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty happy ATM, I do wish that FFB was a bit easier to set up, and that you could load community car setups, but I think the overall game is gorgeous, while still being fun and challenging."
pcars,3aemls,Sir_Stig,7,Fri Jun 19 14:45:31 2015 UTC,"I'm more than happy with my personal experience.   I've run into one glitch the entire time I've played (~10 hours) and that was my HUD disappearing.  But it was easily solved with a restart.  Plus, as others have stated, the game is immensely enjoyable as it stands, especially with the graphics and overall feel."
pcars,3aemls,MineDrac,3,Fri Jun 19 14:52:54 2015 UTC,"I like the sound design (engine in cockpit sounds like it's working under the hood, feels so good; rumble strips sound cool, etc), and I like that they included night driving and tracks like Pacific Highway.  I'm a corner-racer, I like a track with 68 turns.  Heh.  But the menu system is miserable, and worse than that, the control settings have no explanation about what the presets do or what the settings do.  (I was even locked out of the game on the first night I bought it because I had to ""Assign REQUIRED controls!"" but the game wouldn't tell me which ones were required.  It turned out it was some opaque acronym functions like ""GCERS"" and ""KSLA"" or something.)  Worst of all is that the counter-steering happens too quickly.  Forza had ""Normal"" steering and ""Simulation"" steering.  Normal was for controllers.  It affects the amount of wheel-turn when counter-steering.  Project Cars is all simulation with no ""Normal"" mode, and I find it too difficult to counter-steer:  as soon as I have to counter-steer, I usually spin out.  I've tried lots of controller settings.  But this process has been even more frustrating because of the lack of documentation about the presets and the functions (soft dampening, etc).  So I'm not happy with it at all.  I was happy to support it, because I want there to be healthy competition for Forza.  And the things PCars does differently from Forza (NOT INCLUDING STEERING ON CONTROLLER) are neat."
pcars,3aemls,CoconutDust,5,Fri Jun 19 20:40:07 2015 UTC,Yes I am.
pcars,3aemls,nycska,7,Fri Jun 19 15:04:32 2015 UTC,"Frankly, pCARS is the only place I can run a 55-car grid at Le Mans, at night, and still see decent frames at the start. That seals it for me. I still run iRacing and AC, but pCARS is definitely my Le Mans simulator from here on out.  I will agree that there are a lot of bugs, maybe more than I've ever seen in a sim upon release, but access to Le Mans and prototypes trumps all for me right now.  Having spent the last two days testing, here are the things that bug me the most:   Can't drive online sometimes, have to reload session. Course cutting online. It's ridiculous in places No GT mixed with Prototypes. That's a big one for me.  No ability to select opponent liveries Custom liveries not well documented (oh, you have to hit that green button that no one ever mentioned to get your skin to stick?) Saving setups. Just let me name my own! Pit stop bugs. Obviously pit stops and tire changes need to work across the board. Online immaturity. Parking on the straights and ramming cars is not cool. Forum not split for different platforms. I don't want to wade through PS4 threads and can't figure out how to separate them all. Stuck on track loading screen. A lot.   So yeah, it's got some issues, but competition between sims is necessary if they all want to improve. I welcome pCARS and everything it brings, but am definitely not jumping ship from the industry standard sims just yet."
pcars,3aemls,r3c14im3r,6,Fri Jun 19 17:48:56 2015 UTC,"I have a question about PretendRaceCars.net and the content on there if you wouldn't mind taking the time to answer.  Why where previous articles quoting staff & forum members taken completely out of context? Why are you slandering SMS and blowing these stories out of proportion when you must know yourself you are falsely representing the situation? You're spinning these stories in such a way that SMS are neglecting their game, paying customers concerns and banning people from the forums for simply asking a question then insinuating SMS couldn't care less about fixing the problems people have been experienceing when this is not the case at all?  Now ill take the time to reply to your question - am i happy with this buggy mess? Yes and no is my answer to that, i'm really happy to have a game particularly on the consoles that is both heavily sim & motorsport orientated, on the PC however i don't think it breaks the mold too much from the other sims that are available and there could be some improvements.  In all honesty despite the bugs i've had a lot of fun with pCARS so far and i'm loving the majority of cars that are in game that i've driven so far and the racing when all goes well is just as exhilarating as any other racing game.   Now just because i'm still able to have fun doesn't mean i'm not also frustrated with the bugs, i wish it had no bugs at release because the game does have great potential but i've been keeping up to date on the official forum and the majority of the problems that i've saw people report both on here and the official forum is in the line up to be rectified once the dev team replicate the issues for themselves. Obviously this stuff takes time and can't be rectified over night so i have that understanding and i also understand i can't post the same question a million times on the official forum and expect a direct reply straight away from the devs then go on to berate the game and devs because i didnt get my problem addressed there and then.   As someone who prefers multiplayer over a.i. racing i really wish the game was more stable online particularly on the Xbox One console, i'm hoping that as they optimize the game this will help with some of the multiplayer issues though. As a long term player i'm satisfied that a lot of the bugs and issues people are having through no fault of there own just now will be fixed rather than neglected and i'll get enough fun and racing from pCARS for the next few years to justify buying it.  Am i pissed off at SMS for selling me a game with bugs after months and months of delays, even after stating they where delaying the game release for a second time to ensure there wasn't lots of bugs at release? Not really, that's typical game industry jargon and i knew there was going to be stuff that needed ironed out just like any other game. I was tipped off about pCARS about a year and a half before release and i've followed its development for a while, as a motorsport fan it really caught my eye and i can't say i've been sorely disapointed by what SMS and the WMD investors have tried to deliver.  With the announcement of pCARS2 in the line up (which you reported on and speculated that SMS dev teams where abandoning all support for pCARS1, again being misleading, slandering SMS and blowing the story out of proportion) i'm looking forward to seeing how this game evolves and i have high hopes for the future of pCARS and the direction it's going for. Instead of berating the first iteration of this game at every turn along with the devs at SMS i'll be giving my support and thumbs up to SMS."

I wasn't a WMD investor so i'm not financially tied to this game in anyway yet i can still say with certainty your articles are nonsense and i know there's many sim racers who have no ties to pCARS who would agree. The majority of /r/simracing even know your articles are a farce, the support you have is just as questionable as your articles.

That says enough about you really and anybody that doesn't believe that you're slandering SMS are more than welcome to click the links in your articles and take the time to see the scenarios you're reporting on for themselves and weigh it against what you say in your articles, something which your viewership seem incapable of doing.

It's quite frustrating because, after you get past all of the messiness, it has the best steering/FFB feel of any console driving sim I've played.  I think the team is working hard on it, but there are a lot of gaps in polish. It's a little disappointing reading some of Ian's replies on the official forums. I think he cares, but the attitude doesn't mesh when representing a product that people have paid for.   I haven't experienced a ton of gameplay-breaking bugs or anything, but overall presentation/polish/experience is just short of where it could be. But, again, Forza has already been ruined for me because it feels so much worse after playing PCARS. I've done a fair amount of high-performance/track driving and PCARS balances the realism and forgiving fun pretty well.  I can still play FM5 and FH2 on X1 with the gamepad, but the lackluster steering wheel feel rules that out for me now.  I'm hoping FM6 really improves the car handling because it looks phenomenal. PCARS' cars actually feel individually different."

pcars,3ab98w,KangarooCornchips,2,Thu Jun 18 19:29:00 2015 UTC,"Edit: Did some experimenting, and this is easy to fix. In the pit, just slightly change your tire pressure. I changed all my tires to 1.61 bar instead of 1.60 and now they run fine  People kept trying to tell me it was a pressure issue, but there is no possible way. I ran a default setup on the clio cup. 1.6 bar on all tires, medium compound. Tires start at 90 at the beginning, and cool off because I just can't keep my tires that warm very well. Fronts cool down to 80-85, rears 65-70. Go into the pit, and double check the pit stuff. all tires 1.6 bar, medium compound. Come out of the pit at 90, pre-warmed... just accelerating up to race speed, before the first corner... I'm already at 115 C. Brake for first corner, coast through it... 130 C. Accelerate out... 164 C on front, 145 on back. Try and stay on track for the next corner... 164 C front, 164 C back, it doesn't go up any higher. 327 degrees Fahrenheit on all tires, within 15-20 seconds of leaving the pit.  There is no way that's just me running my tires with slightly low pressure."

Perhaps, for some reason, the changed tyres basically had such low pressure so that they would overheat way too fast. Less pressure means the tyres get hotter than usual.

pcars,3aaj6u,RomanCessna,2,Thu Jun 18 15:08:37 2015 UTC,I think the best thing you can do is to wait till the Encore sale then only you buy the game to avoid disappointment.
pcars,3aaj6u,Cheesenium,2,Thu Jun 18 15:57:39 2015 UTC,"It gets less likely every day.  My advice, watch every day until the 20th.  If it still hasn't gone on a daily or flash sale, pick it up for the 25% off it is now.  If you wait until after the sale, it'll go back to full price."
pcars,3aaj6u,FearMeIAmRoot,1 point,Thu Jun 18 15:15:46 2015 UTC,"That is what was suggested. I am waiting until 1 day before the sale ends to buy it, just in case. Is it likely it will be on a daily sale on the final day?"
pcars,3aaj6u,Damgdj,5,Thu Jun 18 15:55:46 2015 UTC,"I don't think so, because the final day is usually every best selling daily deal from all days in one final sale"

pcars,3aawqe,gigirivacattivo,0,Thu Jun 18 17:22:24 2015 UTC,You think that. But I did a group a race where it started raining with two laps to go. So no point putting but enough time for me to lose grip but the AI still pounded round as though they were on a dry track still.  This was after the patch I should point out

pcars,3a8wzy,flouride,1 point,Thu Jun 18 08:21:58 2015 UTC,"It's just another bug. The wheel is very uncentered while driving that old ford escort. I tried to calibrate the wheel over and over again, but it stays the same. For other cars centering is in different position, mostly in the center how it should be. In all other games (ETS2, AC, Dirt rally, NFS shift 2) my wheel is centered alright. If you'll find what causes this please let me know."

pcars,3a8k08,klorptar,3,Thu Jun 18 22:47:48 2015 UTC,I can't stand how the rain is scripted. No matter what I do if I race the same race it will rain at exactly the same time without fail. Wtf?
pcars,3a8k08,Yayo_Mateo,1 point,Thu Jun 18 11:14:13 2015 UTC,Do you mean the same race weekend?  Isn't that the point?  Its the race of that weekend!!??!?  Im so confused as to what you are saying here.  Why would you expect it to not rain every single time you redo that weekend?
pcars,3a8k08,Shadylurker,4,Thu Jun 18 17:42:09 2015 UTC,For example I did two seasons of lmp2 and it rained at hockenheim at exactly the same time in both seasons in all 4 sessions. So when you are doing career mode and it rains that is because it was scripted to rain. It is not random.
pcars,3a8k08,Yayo_Mateo,2,Thu Jun 18 21:44:02 2015 UTC,ahhhhh well thats shitty.
pcars,3a8k08,Shadylurker,3,Thu Jun 18 22:05:25 2015 UTC,In season two of a given class there is the same rain script as season one.

pcars,3a6h77,lookoutblorgons,3,Wed Jun 17 17:46:45 2015 UTC,"1) I found AI will bump into you because they want to keep their line / want to get back in to the race, so I have learnt to predict and avoid their line... It happens more when you go for higher difficulty level. It is not just you and it is frustrating.  2) I started with go karts and I didn't want to continue on. I don't think it is a good experience to start the game with, because it is very twitchy and less intuitive... However, if you are talking about the grass, stay away from them. Even for later when you go for bigger cars, you will spin out if you are in a turn and one wheel is on the grass. I am okay with it, because it is realistic that way. The AI can go off road without slowing down or losing grip, and that's something pCARS did not fix, I guess they choose to not fix it to keep the AI competitive.  3) sorry I use a wheel from day one... but I have seen some settings people have posted. I guess a google search could give you something to try out."

But then accidently hit new career and it booted me back to karts. I will try it again though - and see if I can start somewhere else. I may have accidently clicked karts again somewhere. not much to lose at this point to restart now lol.   (gosh dang are karts hard to drive on a wheel BTW.  Extremely frustrating)"
pcars,3a6h77,notaspookorgook,1 point,Fri Jun 19 14:55:40 2015 UTC,I went from controller (360) to wheel (G27) after a few weeks and I didn't have any trouble once I got used to how the wheel worked. Once I set the wheel up properly it was pretty easy.
pcars,3a6h77,Batmans_Cumbox,2,Fri Jun 19 15:14:53 2015 UTC,I use a controller (DS4) and the following settings have worked really well for me:  Controller input mode 3  Steering Deadzone = 0  Steering Sensitivity = 10 (try 5 also and see what you prefer)   Throttle Deadzone = 0  Throttle Sensitivity = 20  Brake Deadzone = 0  Brake Sensitivity = 10  Clutch Deadzone = 0  Clutch Sensitivity = 40  Speed Sensitivity = 60  Controller Filtering Sensitivity = 70   Advanced Settings = Off  I turn all the assists on and set the AI between 20 and 50 depending on the car.

pcars,3a6h77,r3c14im3r,2,Thu Jun 18 10:39:16 2015 UTC,Honestly I'm not really sure. But there has to be some kind of guide out there that explains everything. This is the first game I've played where settings like this had to be changed. I found these on a thread when the game first released. By now there might even be better settings that people discovered.
pcars,3a6h77,ThatNinja4768,1 point,Wed Jun 17 23:34:23 2015 UTC,"I had friends who just bought Pcars on his Xbox last week and he had the same complaint :)   Absolutely lower the AI level. I think anything higher than 85% is dangerous. At 100% they even can't drive some of the cars because they will crash very frequently, even without any interference from other human or AI players. But even if you are running at low AI level they only care about their line and often overestimate the space to overtake. Try park you car on the track and wait for them, you can easily tell the racing lines they are using (usually 2 lines, if you block 1 of them they will use the other). If you just slightly block their line, they will not slow down and will hit you because they think there's more room than there actually is.   2&3. If you run karts using a controller it will be hard. I have to struggle a lot with karts and superkarts even I use a wheel. I can imagine it could be a nightmare for controller users. They spin very easily, they are very vulnerable to curbs, bumps, and grass. Also at high speed (especially supercarts) there can be loads of tire slipping in the back and it is very easy to lose control. I'll suggest you start with GT cars such as the Audi R8 GT car.  The AIs are not affected by weather, curb, and grass as much as human players are. It is really unfair imo. They recover from gravel and grass way faster than human players can do I think."
pcars,3a6h77,_St3fan_,1 point,Wed Jun 17 17:58:08 2015 UTC,Sorry to hijack and rant a little in your thread but I'm tired of the odd qualifying times. Today is a perfect example (because I wrote the times down this time lol) of what is killing the single player aspect of this game for me.   Donnington/GT3 Q1 I slot in at 24 out of 24 with a time of 1:33:622.  Pole runs a 1:30:429. Wow I was way off and I couldn't see finding over 3 sec.   Q2 I run a slower 1:33:929 and get pole. 2nd place time? 1:36:677. The AI now loses 6 seconds.   This happens all the time. I had a race at Road America in GT 4 where pole was 27 seconds faster than any of iid but come Q2 he ran 35 seconds slower. I know time of day changes so temps change but not to make these huge differences.   What kills me is I could maybe tolerate it if I ran I to the issue in reverse lol. 2 laps starting at the bs k is a pain as opposed to having 5 in the 2nd race.   I ran into controller issues as well and found a few decent settings. There are so many. Just search google and try them till one feels good.
pcars,3a6h77,Fearsomebeaver,3,Wed Jun 17 23:35:36 2015 UTC,Are you skipping to the end of sessions when you bank your times or do you let these sessions play out? I've heard a lot of people who fast forward these sessions suffer from odd times coming up.
pcars,3a6h77,r3c14im3r,1 point,Thu Jun 18 10:32:09 2015 UTC,I once had a lap time of under 30sec from AI on Dubai track after I fast forward to the end of Q1. That's impossible but somehow the AI got the pole for that haha
pcars,3a6h77,p4wly,1 point,Fri Jun 19 08:00:37 2015 UTC,"Are the 2 qualifying laps under the same condition though? I know sometimes pCARS intentionally make the weather and time change for different qualifying, that could cause the time differences too..."
pcars,3a6h77,this_guy_huh,1 point,Thu Jun 18 16:42:27 2015 UTC,"Not sure but fuel and tires only need to last two rounds so you can race them to the absolute limit. Might give you less weight and more grip. You should be able to blast most tracks with 8-10 l fuel and tires that heat up to 160deg C , not sure if AI uses that but I do to get a better pos."
pcars,3a7vam,Chenanigans,4,Wed Jun 17 22:32:26 2015 UTC,t300 if you want a wheel worth the price.
pcars,3a7vam,chimpyman,3,Thu Jun 18 05:51:29 2015 UTC,I have t300 and i can totally recommend it. Its fantastic.  Edit: i have the t3pa pedals and the manual shifter and it feels great. Only downside is that the pedals still feel quite cheep but the shifter is top quality.
pcars,3a7vam,Kashoun,3,Thu Jun 18 09:04:37 2015 UTC,Do the new pedals that you bought feel cheap or the pedals that came with the t300rs originally feel cheap?   I'm looking at the t500rs at the moment and those pedals look really nice.  Like the inverted clubsport pedals from Fanatec
pcars,3a7vam,Dank_Diddy,1 point,Thu Jun 18 19:14:04 2015 UTC,"The new pedals with clutch. Dont get me wrong, they work just fine. But they dont look very solid. Nevertheless its really great fun with the manual shifter which, as i said before, is top quality. Thrustmaster offers anothet pedals made of metal but thats another 80 or so quid on top. If you have any other questions just let me know. I am by no means experienced in sim racing, this is my first wheel, but i am really happy with it."
pcars,3a7vam,Kashoun,2,Fri Jun 19 09:21:52 2015 UTC,"I just bought a T300 this weekend. Been playing GT series since 3 and always used a controller. Pcars on PS4 and my own place, I needed a wheel. Internet searches show unanimous support for the T300 if you are serious and can shell out the cash."
pcars,3a7vam,Rezasaurus,2,Thu Jun 18 04:32:03 2015 UTC,"The G29 looks like it's just a G27 with a new rim and PS4 compatible, but with shifter sold separately. For what it is, the G29 would be overpriced even at $300, let alone $400. I have a G27 and a T300, and I can say that the T300 performs and feels much better than the G27. The only question mark about the T300 is reliability. The T300's reliability has been really hit or miss. I used my G27 for 5 years and it was bulletproof. Don't get me wrong, the G27 is a very decent wheel, but if the G29 is basically the same wheel base then it's ~10 year old tech that dates back to the G25. I wouldn't pay $400 for a wheel with a 10 year old design.  On the other hand, the G29 has a leather rim while the T300 is rubber. The T300 rim feels kind of cheap compared to my leather G27. And the T300 pedals don't have a clutch. But the T300 wheel base is far superior, and that's where most of the money went into.  If you're really worried about reliability and want something tried and trusted, and don't mind that it's a 10 year old design, then maybe go for the G29. But if you want something that performs and feels better, then T300."

Many games force players to reach a certain level of skill before unlocking multiplayer. Sim racing should definitely be one of them.

Also make sure you are not overdriving (steering to hard), if that is the case slow down your steering ratio.    Make sure you aren't locking up the rear brakes.

pcars,3a333y,BlackLightzHD,9,Fri Jun 19 05:23:20 2015 UTC,"It truly is an art. First things first is you have to identify what exactly you're trying to fix. The very first thing you should do is get your gearing right, as this can affect handling in various ways. For instance maybe you're staying in 3rd gear a lot of turns, make sure you're not too low or high, shifting oddly out of corners or not getting enough down a certain straightaway. After you've sorted that, it's wise to make a nice run. 5 to 10 laps, let the tires come up to temp and feel what the car is doing. If you can't make laps, if you're not running consistently and you're running off track, etc, then you're not ready to adjust the car. Once you're up and running consistently but need something more from the car, then identify exactly what you're needing and adjust accordingly. I like messing with the toe first, more negative toe in the front will help your turn in. If I'm bad loose out of corners, I'll put some positive rear toe in. You always want positive rear toe, never negative and never none, at least have 1 click of positive toe in the rear. If you're too tight on the exit, you can take some out for example. After I get the toe figured out, I go back to running more 5 to 10 lap stints. Adjusting camber, I usually run pretty aggressive in the front and as much as I can stand in the rear. Back to running stints, work on something else rinse and repeat.   I could drag this out but I hope you get the idea. Always take note of the tracks you're racing, if I'm at a track that is all right handers except maybe 2 corners I'll sell out and practically build a car meant for right handers. Ride height and spring settings aggressively and favorably to turning right. Same with the weight settings.  Read your tire temps and pressure, they will guide you on where you need to go, they don't lie. You can stagger your tire pressures to create various handling characteristics, this is typically fine tuning for me.  If you have any questions feel free to ask. I do all my own setups and I've been at this a while.  Edit* one last thing, PCars likes to start you with much more fuel than you need. Practice and setup your car for the correct amount of fuel you'll need to complete your stint. Taking out all that fuel and running what you need helps lap times and the feel/balance tremendously."
pcars,3a333y,MPHJr,2,Tue Jun 16 23:00:39 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the long post!   I get what you are saying and I'll try to do this more. It's just that some tunes seem to affect each other in a negative way. I really struggle going into sharp corners with any speed. I either understeer through the corner, going way too wide or I spin on accelerating out of it. Sometimes I try to compensate the lack of turning by braking more during the corner, which gives me the feeling I am way too slow.   It's more that everytime I solve a problem I seem to create multiple new ones."
pcars,3a333y,MPHJr,2,Wed Jun 17 08:16:57 2015 UTC,"Well to be blunt there is no guide that'll help you learn the ""feel"" and to translate that into an adjustment. You make an adjustment, if it doesn't work you reverse it and adjust something else. It's the only way to learn. Take note of how everything effects the car regardless of helping or hurting. Someone posted a guide, but I disagree with it. A lot of it. Things like ride height adjustments are not something you keep going back and adjusting. You want to run as low as possible without bottoming out, preferably having more rear ride height than front to help the rake of the car, but it is not something you go back and adjust to fine tune handling. It's a nice guide to maybe identify what direction to look, however following it too closely will be detrimental."
pcars,3a333y,lookoutblorgons,1 point,Wed Jun 17 14:51:19 2015 UTC,You should have your braking completed before you turn into the corner. If you're understeering off the track you may simply be going too fast.

pcars,3a333y,this_guy_huh,1 point,Wed Jun 17 02:20:15 2015 UTC,"When you are adjusting the toe, how many points do you start with and how many points adjustment do you do each time?"
pcars,3a333y,MPHJr,1 point,Wed Jun 17 17:27:05 2015 UTC,"Depends on the car, some cars like open wheel cars seem to benefit from running almost max front negative toe, some cars don't respond well to that. I can feel it, so I can sort it out fairly quickly. Personally I like a lot of negative front toe, it complements my driving style. I can feel the rear out easily as well, I'll actually start out a bump or two above 0, as I do prefer to be on the looser side than tight. If I feel the back end stepping out too much I'll then put more positive rear toe by 1 click. Toe adjustments seem to translate well meaning you don't need to take a big swing at it,  and its an adjustment I can tell within a corner or two whether it was enough or not."
pcars,3a333y,StarboardSatyr,1 point,Wed Jun 17 20:37:12 2015 UTC,Depends on what you're trying solve. Is the rear kicking out to much? Having problems cornering?
pcars,3a333y,SoullessPolack,3,Tue Jun 16 22:01:28 2015 UTC,"It's basically that I seem to have solved one thing but created a new problem. For example: I can't seem to take the first section of the Nurnburgring GP with any speed. I solve the understeer going into corner, but then the oversteer kicks in. I solve the oversteer and the understeer is back, it is a never ending cycle ;-)!"
pcars,3a333y,Jrel,2,Wed Jun 17 08:13:13 2015 UTC,"Many times, it's a compromise.  You'll never be able to fix everything.  Even if you get a great tune, there's going to be corners that are perfect, and some that are less than perfect, simply based on the fact that different corners have different characteristics.    I'm not saying give up, but realize that sometimes you will have to settle for something less than what you feel is optimal.  Even in my last race, I had to do that after spending forever trying to tune it right.  The car was good throughout the whole lap, except for two corners where it oversteered a bit too much.  In the end, I just had to be gentler in those corners, and then I was able to go fast through all the other corners."

This would have meant that third party phone, tablet, laptop based dashboards / timing apps, etc would have worked on the console versions as well as PC.  To me this would have massively set the game apart from the competition and would have solidified it as being a 'serious sim'.  My feature request fell on deaf ears though and the PC API is just a memory mapped shared data file, which is easier to implement but far les flexible and requires all third party apps which run on secondary devices to require their own 'server' running on the host machine (which is impossible for consoles)."

The SLS is more about performance than luxury and you're paying for that performance while SUVs aren't exactly performance orientated for the track, yes you may have a big mighty engine with a fair amount of torque to pull around 3 - 5 tonnes but you're paying for luxury over handling & performance. I don't step on my own toes by stating that SUVs are overpriced because they really are compared to what you could get for the same money, personally i think all SUVs are overpriced crap but that's my personal biased viewpoint.  Racing cars can indeed be cheaper, handle better and be much quicker, depending on the type of car obviously and you get what you pay for performance wise.  I wouldn't mind rally SUVs/trucks like the ones that compete in the Dakar but they don't belong on just smooth asphalt circuits, add some dirt like rally X though and i'm more than satisfied to see these type of vehicles but i still don't think general purpose SUVs like the G Wagon or Range Rover SVR would have a place in this enviroment, they're more suited to wide open motorways and the parking lot of your local supermarket or parked outside some sleazy nightclub."

People of all skill levels. Close, hard, clean racing all the way deep into mid-pack in the practice and league races. Friendly people from all over the world.  If you want to get fast, you'll find lots of patient support and coaching from really fast people. If you just want to have fun...fun will be had. ...If you're already fast, we have some really fast guys you'll love racing against.   Just added Clio Cup and Prototypes into the mix for the next season of league races."

I'd just like to see the calendar before I sign up because I don't want to be one of those people who register and then don't actually turn up because I lost interest.

pcars,39x41u,modonaut,1 point,Tue Jun 16 00:56:35 2015 UTC,"It is ridiculous. I've mainly kept my mouth shut about it, but seeing the dichotomy of pCars (a ""finished"" game) vs Dirt Rally (still in Early Access) I have to say that I regret making this purchase."
pcars,39x41u,Cancerous86,3,Tue Jun 16 01:56:36 2015 UTC,"Project Cars had an extremely limited budget, especially for an ambitious multiplatform title. TBH, I don't think there was ever a possibility of it launching ''finished''. It's a shame people didn't get what they expected but I do believe that the problems will be dealt with seeing that the game sold quite well. But yeah, I think it should have launched as an early access title."
pcars,39x41u,billythemule,2,Tue Jun 16 11:35:37 2015 UTC,"I understand the problems with a limited budget, and a small team.  Cities: Skylines was developed by a team of 13 people, and it's one of the most polished, best selling games on Steam right now.  What I will not condone is releasing a game that is riddled with game-breaking bugs, calling it ""finished"", and using their small team and limited budget as an excuse.  If they knew they would have problems, they should have scaled back their ambition.    This was bad project management and deceptive (harsh, I know, but it fits) marketing.  I've given them my money, though, so I can only tell others about the buggy software, and hope that they improve it over time so I can change my opinion of the game."

pcars,39z98l,klorptar,1 point,Tue Jun 16 22:29:02 2015 UTC,"There's different kids of wet tires. If it's raining really hard, and there's a lot of water on the track, you need to use the 'extreme wet' tires. If there's a little rain you can use the regular wet tires.

Found by Microsoft, not their oh-so-fantastic beta testers with early access or any of their staff. And they still have the gall to blame Microsoft for it.   Mind you, PS4 still crashes randomly as before. And races with mandatory tyre change are unplayable after 1.4 because all four tyres blow up as soon as the car is out of the pitlane. How they did not found this is beyond me."

Perhaps consider more heavily editing your videos to trim some fat and leave only the prime cuts, if that makes any sense.  Another small snag for me was your mic.

The part where you said ""GingerAndy has moved up a position, but we didn't see it on camera. I don't know if a car fell out or what happened."" was a nice callback to watching a real race. Finally, I didn't notice your username, so I thought the driver name was ""Jim Jerandi""."

pcars,39uod4,doctaj5,1 point,Mon Jun 15 14:51:00 2015 UTC,Direct x 12 doesn't launch until windows 10 does July 30th. And even then it can't be taken advantage of by users until developers implement it into their games. You should realistically see no actually fps improvement by using the tech preview and may actually find the game more unstable.
pcars,39uod4,arrise,1 point,Mon Jun 15 01:49:38 2015 UTC,DX12 is definitely included in the windows 10 preview.  I've seen 30-40% across the board increases in project cars on 7970 crossfire'd cards.  I have also not ran into any bugs or had any crashes with the windows 10 preview. It is pretty much ready to go.

pcars,39tzgt,PhantomDot1,1 point,Sun Jun 14 19:26:10 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't play this with a keyboard and mouse, it really just won't give you the fine inputs you need. I play on an xbox controller right now but hopefully I'll get a wheel soon. As much as I liked the most recent Gran Turismo I think PCars is better. You can start as far into your career as you want which I love. The races also allow you practice time, qualifying time, and then the race. You can set how long you want each portion to be and you can even sim some or all of a race. It really lets you play the way you want. There are less cars in PCars though but I don't mind because it cuts out a lot of the stuff I don't care about driving. It also doesn't have upgrade options but I think tuning options are much better simply because they are easier to set up and there are descriptions on what options do to change the car's performance."

pcars,39tzgt,todayicommented,1 point,Mon Jun 15 06:24:13 2015 UTC,"I also bought Project CARS after liking Gran Turismo on PS3. Personally, I enjoy PCars more, but it really depends on what you want from the game. If you enjoy the physics and realism of a simulator with ultra detailed cars, then you will love PCars, but if your looking for the grind to purchase and collect hundreds of cars such as in Gran Turismo, you might want to stick with that. PCars only has about 50+ cars, but there is plenty of variety. Also, all of them are immediately unlocked. You're not forced to progress through licenses and purchase cars with in-game money. You can also start wherever you want in career mode. You can begin in karts and work your way up to Formula races, or you can skip straight to Prototype races in a ""defend your title"" sort of style. Everything is up to you in PCars which is what I love about it. The only thing that's annoying about the game right now is the public online community. You'll here plenty of complaints in this sub about kids and other people ramming racers off the track. I even posted my own gameplay capture of what I'm talking about.  If you don't have the money to spend on a good wheel, there are plenty of other ways you can avoid using a mouse/keyboard. I have a PS4 and an extra DS4 controller, so I simply use one of those with the program DS4 Tool to trick my PC into thinking its a 360 controller. I'm fairly certain the same can be done with a DS3, although you might have to use a different program like x360ce (xbox 360 controller emulator). Another alternative is to buy a cheap wired 360 controller. I hear they go for about $20. Otherwise, any other controller that works on a PC can be mapped manually in the actual game. There are also plenty of controller settings posted in the sub or on Steam's forums that you can search for, or experiment with yourself.  Hope you find a way to enjoy this awesome game!"

I'll pass/lap a slower AI and I'LL be shown a blue flag.  dafuq?!  2) the BS of not being able to DRIVE once you join a lobby.  It's inconsistent for me, sometimes (more often now than closer to launch) I can drive if I join a lobby, others not.  Then you're stuck in bumper cam for the race.  One that I'll add, and maybe this would be more difficult to solve, but the LAG when a new player joins the session during practice or quali, but this has GOT to be fixed for quali.  It's a 10min quali sometimes, you really only get 2 good laps on some tracks, and with some people coming/going, your lap gets fucked because of the lag associated with their coming/going.  It's so annoying when you can't put in a quali lap because of this.  And when you try and mediate the effects, you'll lose a good ~2s just trying to blindly ensure you don't go off track.  I 100% realize that this may be dependent on conxn, and I certainly don't know the ins-outs of any game coding, let alone online MP, there's got to be something that can be done to minimize this.  There's got to be a way to minimize the effects on those in-game."

In the TUNE setup, my tires are all at 2bar by default, but when I go to edit PIT strat, ALL tire pressures are set to highest (by default?) at 3.4bar.  Have a look, maybe this is the issue?  I haven't driven the race yet, just saw your post an hr ago, was playing and prepping for the race, and noticed my PIT setup by default were WAYY different than the TUNE pressures.  This might not be the solution, but worth checking out."
pcars,39svz8,Tobz511,1 point,Sun Jun 14 17:11:45 2015 UTC,"This doesn't seem to be the issue. I was doing a GT3 career race at Brands Hatch, with my starting tune at 1.9 bar for all tyres and the pit strategy matching. On entering the pits i checked the strategy again, everything looked correct at 1.9 bar. Exited the pits and suddenly NO pressure/tyres burst.   I really really really want to like this game, it's one of the best racers I've ever played but the ridiculous amount of, especially in this case, game breaking bugs is getting annoying now.

Which drags the bottom of the car along the track.   I couldn't figure out what was going on, just did mandatory pit on Bathurst GT4 with the Aston, exited and saw sparks shooting out the rear.  Initially thought a blown tire, a quick look around the car showed all four good.   The car was pretty much undrivable. I ended up siming to the end and took 2nd under cpu control. Funny thing is,the issue was fixed the moment I switched,and you could even see in the replay the car lifting up an inch for the cpu driver.   How they fix this soon. Pretty much makes it pointless to continue the current career season of this will happen at every mandatory pit."

It cause you to have to back out of online server and try and find it again. And then it will happen again. Just a ridiculous and frustrating bug that should not still be in a month on release."
pcars,39r7qo,SandyBunker,2,Sun Jun 14 05:29:54 2015 UTC,I thought it was bug.
pcars,39r7qo,SandyBunker,2,Sun Jun 14 12:16:23 2015 UTC,is SMS aware of this bug? I agree its so annoying
pcars,39r7qo,terrible1fi,1 point,Sun Jun 14 20:29:50 2015 UTC,Its a bug. It sticks to bumper cam if you were not able to get out onto the track to qualify before the session ends. The default waiting screen where you can view the lobby set your car up (look behind the UI) is bumpercam view. I assume is sticks as the room has a locked cam setting but you were unable to set yours if you didnt leave the garage
pcars,39r7qo,EyeLuvPC,1 point,Sun Jun 14 20:52:48 2015 UTC,Agreed. I also hate the one that makes you unable to leave the pits until you rejoin

pcars,39mqte,TachiFoxy,3,Sat Jun 13 10:05:54 2015 UTC,That's because the footage you see in the cinematic video is made on PC.   You cannot compare the sheer possible prowess of a PC to the 1080p PS4.

pcars,39mqte,Pinksters,2,Sat Jun 13 12:45:55 2015 UTC,It's not the copy you bought..It's deception on their part. They'll render and record on a multi-thousand dollar system with TITAN X's and then paste Xbone/PS4 labels and control schemes on the screen.   It's been a thing for awhile now.

I'm personally really sick of waiting months for a game to be fixed when I've already paid full price. By the time it's fixed I might not even want to play it anymore."
pcars,39mqte,hawlbucker,2,Sat Jun 13 09:24:41 2015 UTC,"Agreed. But the dev and funding for this game was different than most studios. Honestly I am not surprised that GT5 took so long. In some cases when they fixed one issue it surfaced another one and so on... Honestly I dont care that the game has bugs after 3 years I still play it and there is long term support for the game including listening to feedback and adding features, and frequent too since its an independent IP. My expectations are reasonable of them due to being on the inside. I think big studio devs have soured the gaming community a bit with recent past transgressions.  To each their own though, enjoy whatever games you play is all I gotta say."
pcars,39mqte,hawlbucker,0,Sat Jun 13 12:41:33 2015 UTC,"I love the game, and see greatness to come from it. like others have said so many of the things plaguing the game weren't seen by the ones playing it for the last year and a half but now  boom. so i am sure when its all ironed out, it will be amazing. my point wasn't to bash this video but to show that it and lots of other games released aren't what the light, smoke and mirrors show in videos, and trailers. the lies and  sideways talk need to be checked...."

pcars,39mqte,eastcoastgamer,2,Sat Jun 13 11:55:11 2015 UTC,"A couple examples, the first one being the mistake of advertising the modified car pack as part of the digital edition several days after release, then claiming it had been put there by mistake, and in their words it was 'only there for a couple of hours' until fixed. I don't care that much about the dlc in the first place, but they were essentially blaming customers for being dumb and not understanding that it was for preorders only. Not all customers follow a release weeks before, some just buy what they see advertised. From what I've seen, nothing has been done in any way about this except telling customers 'it was a mistake but we fixed it'. I don't mind paying a few bucks for dlc, but because of lack of respect in this case I don't want to pay for any future dlc, I would feel like a fool.  The recent 'on demand' announcement also reeks of arrogance. It says 'all pcars players will receive a free game update' which includes fixes, hardware support and so on. The whole way it's worded makes it sound like they hold themselves above the customer, wording like 'receive' and 'free' updates. A full price title with serious bugs? You better believe the updates are free.   Some may see these as small things, but it tells a lot about the general attitude of a developer. Some developers nowadays have adopted the attitude that they are the benevolent entity and customers should be happy they get anything 'extra' (which of course is planned into the title price in the first place). In the end, treating a customer with respect should be a smart business move. But unfortunately we see that many developers/publishers can be successful without doing that as well."
pcars,39mqte,hawlbucker,1 point,Sat Jun 13 12:39:57 2015 UTC,"I agree with some of what you've stated but from my personal perspective i disagree with some of your speculation as well.  I didn't think much of the pCARS On Demand announcement myself and it didn't seem very significant as far as announcements go as it just stated stuff you would expect from them but it never struck me as arrogant. They made their position official that pCARS will be supported because people had doubts about this, how else are they supposed to announce this officially to the ill-informed amongst all the rumours and speculation that flys about regarding this game? Where i come back to agree with you is the wording of this announcement when they state players will receive free updates as if we would ever have to pay for the game being patched and fixed because the release version of the game particularly on the consoles is broken, even now with the 1.4 patch pCARS still has some ways to go until i'd regard it to be in a stable condition for everyone but at very least you know there will be more updates coming (don't forget it's free) and it won't be left as is.  The Modified car pack was stated clearly for months before the final release date that it was to be included with pre-orders and the digital edition stated this clearly in the description weeks before release, if there was any confusion here with customers who bought pCARS after the release date (technically and clearly not a pre-order) then you can hardly say that by informing customers of this fact is being disrespectful or worse, trying to insinuate that the people that didn't understand this are dumb even though it was still advertised as a pre-order edition. If you think SMS where insinuating customers where dumb for this misunderstanding then that's your personal opinion and what you take away from it. Personally I would've prefered to have saw the Modified car pack given away for free to any customers who made this mistake and bought an advertised pre-order edition after release as a show of good faith from the devs but unfortunately in the real world there's a group of people called lawyers that prevent such good things from happening.   Realistically the gaming industry and the players/customers these days are just as bad and as irresponsible as each other, constantly at each others throats. I take the middleground these days and don't speculate too deeply in to these matters. I don't know about you and i know the game isn't perfect but i'm still able to have a lot of fun and good races on multiplayer when all goes well :)."

pcars,39pj1i,hawlbucker,2,Sun Jun 14 11:12:04 2015 UTC,"There really is no right or wrong set up. It's very dependent on your driving style and how you want the car to feel.  Now there is probably an optimal set up based specifically for how you want to drive and the track you are driving on... And that's pretty much the beauty of tuning. Adjust, test, adjust, test, adjust, test, until you think you've got it the best you can.   Sometimes you never get it perfect. Look at professional racing, its what they do for a living, for millions of dollars, and inevitably at the end of a race you'll hear a driver say ""we just couldn't get the car set up the way we wanted"".   It's an art!"
pcars,39pj1i,Mikeastuto,2,Sat Jun 13 15:42:01 2015 UTC,"There are zillions of set up guides out there; you dont need a pcars specific one because they all operate on the same principles. If you want to learn, i recommend taking a single slider (eg front swaybar stiffness) and doing a few good laps with it at default, then minimized, then maximized. That will give you a crude sense of how it changes the car's feel, and you can move it a smaller amount in the preferred direction. Then you'll learn to say ""the car is doing this, I should change X a little this way.""  Someone else's setup for a specific car and track can help with that one single scenario, but ultimately you'll be better off learning to ballpark the car's configuration yourself. We all drive differently and one guy's corner entry setup may totally conflict with your style."

pcars,39pj1i,keeb119,2,Sat Jun 13 15:54:10 2015 UTC,While a set up is important I disagree with the main theme of this post. If you can't run consistent laps on the proper braking points and find the apex you can't win races. Setup is important but if your not running lap times within a half of a second it's hard to even know if your setup change has made you faster.

In one practice session, I did notice an unrealistic fastest lap set by the AI and thought I was going to be knackered on race day.  Qualifying had me pushing as I gradually rose up from being the 6th fastest to first. With a pole position start, I was able to maintain a 2-3 second lead throughout and eventually won the race.  ON the race weekends that followed, I noticed that the practice lap times set by the AI were quite fast yet plausible. I managed to beat their times and win the race too.   The thing is, I'm not sure if I'm getting better or its some feature/bug at play here."
pcars,39l6wy,SeanBe793,1 point,Sun Jun 14 07:19:00 2015 UTC,If you sim faster than 2x the ai run F1 times. In GT4 at Sonoma i tested it when i noticed it was weird and the pole AI  got a 49 second lap. not 1:49... just 49 seconds. The higher the simulation time multiplier the crazier the ai times.
pcars,39l6wy,saintedplacebo,1 point,Mon Jun 15 07:06:24 2015 UTC,"I think it's a bug, but in certain circumstances it could be explained by differences in fuel loads, rubbered-in track and track temperature - especially if you run a few laps at the start of the session and then skip to the end, as I usually do. These factors could definitely make a bigger difference than 3 seconds."

pcars,39k6cy,why_earth,2,Fri Jun 12 14:14:38 2015 UTC,Yep I double checked replays as well and they were spot on
pcars,39k6cy,peat76,7,Fri Jun 12 15:11:28 2015 UTC,"Project CARS – PS4 Patch 1.4 – Release Notes   General   Pagani Monza Club day invitational event – no longer causes the game to crash when using a specific livery on the Pagani Huayra. Anisotropic filtering has been increased to help reduce blurry textures. Temporal anti-aliasing has been further optimised. This reduces the ghosting effect and additionally gives the player full control via a slider to tweak the resulting image according to personal preference.   Performance improvements   All shaders have been rebuilt using new shader compiler, giving a significant performance boost in some areas. CPU performance gains due to new more aggressive code optimisations.   Physics & AI   The AI loss of grip that results from tyre degradation as a result of wear is now more noticeable. The AI will now show much more realistic grip loss when running on slick tyres in the rain. First pass improvements on various tracks to enhance the AI performance and ability (Azure Circuit, Donington GP, Watkins Glen, Bathurst, Nordschleife).   Replays   Improved the smoothness of the sun, moon, stars, and shadow motion when rewinding replays of a race that had a high time acceleration.   Driver Network Profile   Fixed an issue where at times the miles driven on a particular track or with a particular car would be logged under the wrong car or track. This improves the accuracy of the player’s Affinity ratings.   Pitting, Tuning, Setups   Fixed an issue where certain street cars would pit for tyre change during rain when they already had the correct tyres fitted. Fixed an issue where custom vehicle setups were lost when progressing through sessions. Fixed an issue where AI vehicles were sometimes sent to the pits due to low fuel on races where refuelling is not allowed. Improved the system used to select the most appropriate tyres based on current and predicted weather conditions. Ensure that the AI always pit when they need to change tyres based on the weather conditions. The Default strategy will now correctly show the tyres that will be fitted on the player vehicle during a pit stop. The pit stop routine will no longer start during online races until the player closes the pit stop menu. This ensures that the player has enough time to select or configure an appropriate set of actions before the pit crew start working on the car. Tyre pressures will now be correctly set when the player changes to a new set of tyres. The currently-active Pit strategy will now remain in action when advancing through race sessions. Pitstop strategy will now use the actual bar value for tyre pressures. Fixed an issue where the Pit engineer would repeatedly inform the player that a pit crew member has lost a wheel nut during pit stops. Fixed an issue where the Pit Engineer would call the player to stop for fuel when fuel consumption was disabled in options.   Online   Fixed an issue where the player was sometimes given a large time penalty when exiting the pit lane. Fixed an issue where the remaining session time displayed an incorrect value in the Tuning screen. Fixed an issue that at times would prevent a player from entering a race, after joining a second online lobby. Fixed an issue where the Track Location popup would at times appear on some screens. The lobby browser now displays random lobbies instead of always the oldest lobbies. Fixed an issue where network features could not be used after resuming from rest mode. Fixed an occasional crash when advancing from Qualifying to Race. Fixed an occasional crash when returning from a race to the Race Central. Disabled driver swap to AI team-mate during online races and Time Trial events. Enabled saving of community event ghosts. These ghosts are automatically stored online, and you can then download ghosts of other players’ laps for these events.   Controls    Fixed pedals and triggers that vibrates during replays. Fixed an issue that causes the wheel centring spring to be active during driving. Improved force feedback strength and tweaked the default force feedback parameters for all supported wheels based on community feedback. Further enhancements to the steering feeling – improved blending between the tyre force spring and the steering lock spring. Improved behaviour of the wheel force springs while navigating the menu system. Fixed an issue where the player got stuck on the career screen when entering driver name using a wheel controller. Fixed an issue with the Thrustmaster T500RS centring spring. Fixed several issues and further improved the support implementation of several older Fanatec wheels, such as the GT2, GT3, and CSR. Fixed the Fanatec CSS so that it works correctly in sequential mode. Fixed the Fanatec CSP pedals to save the calibration correctly if player calibrated only pedals. Fixed the Fanatec CSP ABS rumble. Fixed the Fanatec CSW handbrake. Game Pad – tilt Control support implemented to allow controller tilt to be used to control the vehicles. Implemented support for the Logitech G29 wheel.   Time Trial   Set Time Trials starting time to 11am to match the PC platform. This ensures consistent track temperatures across all platforms, as track temperatures affect lap times.   GUI   Driver Network Profile – visual tidy up to improve usability. Fixed an issue where very thin lines would not always appear. Added support for better info display on the Community Events page. Fixed the issue where HUD customization was not saved on exiting a session. Fixed an issue where the Potential Lap time display on the Lap Info board would be inconsistent with the sector times being displayed.  Monitor / Spectate mode – fixed an issue where the vehicle being viewed would automatically reset to the player’s vehicle on leaving the monitor screen.   Vehicles   Adjusted handbrake strength on vehicles which are equipped with handbrakes.  Fixed an issue where the rain wipers’ state did not reset correctly when restarting a session. Fixed an issue where light glows from a vehicle behind the player would sometimes appear in front of the player. Fixed fuel pressure gauge calibration in several cars. Fixed an issue where a white border would at times appear around the brake light glow of certain cars. Ford Mk IV – improved the collision model to prevent vehicles wedging in under other vehicles. Formula Gulf, Gumpert Apollo, Formula Rookie – fixed an issue with the livery sets that caused the livery selection to display wrong liveries.  Lykan Hypersport – statistics updated to latest manufacturer specification. Lotus 72D – improved handing characteristics, exposed bump stops to be adjustable in the vehicle setup, reduced cold sensitivities of the slick tyres, adjusted the AI speed, wear and rain tires to match the player’s  experience.  Karts – reworked the Karts optimization to help address performance drops with a lot of Karts on track. McLaren 12C GT3 – adjusted the vehicle pose to more closely match the real car. BMW M3 GT4 – improved the accuracy of the levels at which the oil and water temperature warning lights will activate. Ford Escort RS1600 – improved the collision and wheel contact model to prevent climbing over other cars in collisions. 250cc Superkart – improved the default setup to address controller issues on higher speed tracks, and improved the AI handling.  Lotus 49 – improved the AI handling of the vehicle in corners and in close racing.  Pagani Huayra – reduced fuel consumption to around 3mpg in hard track use, and improved cooling to prevent engine overheating.   Tracks   Bathurst – removed cones in the pit lane that was causing cars to get stuck. Watkins Glen – fixed a number of accuracy issues around the track.  24 Heures du Mans – improved the race line at a few corners to keep the LMP cars off the curbs as this was  causing the cars to lean over on two wheels. Silverstone National – vehicle grid placement reworked to more closely align with the painted start boxes. Hockenheim (various layouts) – reworked the wet weather reflection mapping to address incorrect object reflections. Willow Springs – fixed an issue where the vehicle could drive through the barriers when exiting the pits. Sakitto and Summerton variations – corrected track info regarding number of turns and track length. Sakitto Sprint – fixed a crash that would at times occur when using time acceleration. Cadwell variations – fixed draw distance issues on various objects. Oschersleben variations – fixed odd lights around track and colour issues with the horizon. Zolder – fixed an issue where the player car would sometimes start in a closed garage."

The counter-argument to what I wrote is obviously ""get better"", which is what I'm trying to do.  However with the metric you suggested I'd potentially find it difficult to race on-line.  The counter-argument to the above is that one should get better before going on-line at all.  Wow.. I'm rambling...."

I really want an online career mode to play with friends.  The way I thought about it though was to approach online mode realistically.  In real life, you can't win a race if you crash.  Racing games have to be more forgiving than that though so they can make it fun.  If there was a system that rewarded clean racing (more than punishing contact), then the fundamental experience becomes is different right out of the box.  Then, when you do eventually ""learn to win"" you are winning right way... which is prob a better experience to begin with.  Ramble on, my friend."

If you don't have a lot of money. Then I'd suggest buying the game use a controller, if you like it, then buy a wheel down the road. The game has lots of bugs, it's not perfect and won't be for quite sometime, maybe in 6 months they will have the bugs worked out, or they won't and everyone will move on to the next racing product.

Driving with a controller is extremely difficult in this game, and requires a huge amount of tuning and adjustment in the menu. I was about to lose interest in the game altogether when I kept reading online that it was a completely different game with a wheel.  I decided to get a g27, found some basic settings for it online, and have never looked back. It's an exhilarating and visceral experience playing with the wheel. I went from ready to quit after ~15 hours in the game, and have now clocked ~80 hours with no end in sight.  If you can afford a wheel, and you enjoy racing games, then I'd say go for it 100%."

It is quite a lot of money, but it's been a while since I've spent something on gaming and if I really don't enjoy playing with the wheel I think I would be able to sell it to someone else for about 75% of the price, so then it wouldn't be too much. I think if I'll get it, I will just buy the game itself first and see how it runs on my pc.  Thanks for the advice :)"

Beyond the factory OC I mean.  If it is, try knocking 10MHz off the core clock speed and see if that helps at all.  If not, knock another 10 MHz off.

pcars,39i6z0,doctaj5,1 point,Fri Jun 12 12:51:23 2015 UTC,"Mmm, I wouldnt say this is your fault at all.  pCARS deals with OC's terribly.  When benchmarking and playing all the games I consistently play, and having my overclock at +XX MHz, everything works fine.  So I have therefore established a stable max OC.  However, certain games and scenarios act on OC's differently and strain the system differently.  That's understandable.  But for pCARS to crash constantly unless I reduce my otherwise stable OC by 35 MHz and a decent amount off the memory clockspeed too, the fault doesnt lie with my system.  If you have done all the stress testing, benchmarking, and play testing in your most used games, and your OC is stable... the fault doesnt lie with your OC being bad.  :p    pCARS has a lot of problems, and crashing when OC'd seems to be even 1 more to add to the list."

This reduces the ghosting effect and additionally gives the player full control via a slider to tweak the resulting image according to personal preference.   Performance improvements   All shaders have been rebuilt using new shader compiler, giving a significant performance boost in some areas. CPU performance gains due to new more aggressive code optimisations.   Physics & AI   The AI loss of grip that results from tyre degradation as a result of wear is now more noticeable. The AI will now show much more realistic grip loss when running on slick tyres in the rain. First pass improvements on various tracks to enhance the AI performance and ability (Azure Circuit, Donington GP, Watkins Glen, Bathurst, Nordschleife).   Replays   Improved the smoothness of the sun, moon, stars, and shadow motion when rewinding replays of a race that had a high time acceleration.   Driver Network Profile   Fixed an issue where at times the miles driven on a particular track or with a particular car would be logged under the wrong car or track. This improves the accuracy of the player’s Affinity ratings.   Pitting, Tuning, Setups   Fixed an issue where certain street cars would pit for tyre change during rain when they already had the correct tyres fitted. Fixed an issue where custom vehicle setups were lost when progressing through sessions. Fixed an issue where AI vehicles were sometimes sent to the pits due to low fuel on races where refuelling is not allowed. Improved the system used to select the most appropriate tyres based on current and predicted weather conditions. Ensure that the AI always pit when they need to change tyres based on the weather conditions. The Default strategy will now correctly show the tyres that will be fitted on the player vehicle during a pit stop. The pit stop routine will no longer start during online races until the player closes the pit stop menu. This ensures that the player has enough time to select or configure an appropriate set of actions before the pit crew start working on the car. Tyre pressures will now be correctly set when the player changes to a new set of tyres. The currently-active Pit strategy will now remain in action when advancing through race sessions. Pitstop strategy will now use the actual bar value for tyre pressures. Fixed an issue where the Pit engineer would repeatedly inform the player that a pit crew member has lost a wheel nut during pit stops. Fixed an issue where the Pit Engineer would call the player to stop for fuel when fuel consumption was disabled in options.   Online   Fixed an issue where the player was sometimes given a large time penalty when exiting the pit lane. Fixed an issue where the remaining session time displayed an incorrect value in the Tuning screen. Fixed an issue that at times would prevent a player from entering a race, after joining a second online lobby. Fixed an issue where the Track Location popup would at times appear on some screens. The lobby browser now displays random lobbies instead of always the oldest lobbies. Fixed an issue where network features could not be used after resuming from rest mode. Fixed an occasional crash when advancing from Qualifying to Race. Fixed an occasional crash when returning from a race to the Race Central. Disabled driver swap to AI team-mate during online races and Time Trial events. Enabled saving of community event ghosts. These ghosts are automatically stored online, and you can then download ghosts of other players’ laps for these events.   Controls    Fixed pedals and triggers that vibrates during replays. Fixed an issue that causes the wheel centring spring to be active during driving. Improved force feedback strength and tweaked the default force feedback parameters for all supported wheels based on community feedback. Further enhancements to the steering feeling – improved blending between the tyre force spring and the steering lock spring. Improved behaviour of the wheel force springs while navigating the menu system. Fixed an issue where the player got stuck on the career screen when entering driver name using a wheel controller. Fixed an issue with the Thrustmaster T500RS centring spring. Fixed several issues and further improved the support implementation of several older Fanatec wheels, such as the GT2, GT3, and CSR. Fixed the Fanatec CSS so that it works correctly in sequential mode. Fixed the Fanatec CSP pedals to save the calibration correctly if player calibrated only pedals. Fixed the Fanatec CSP ABS rumble. Fixed the Fanatec CSW handbrake. Game Pad – tilt Control support implemented to allow controller tilt to be used to control the vehicles. Implemented support for the Logitech G29 wheel.   Time Trial   Set Time Trials starting time to 11am to match the PC platform. This ensures consistent track temperatures across all platforms, as track temperatures affect lap times.   GUI   Driver Network Profile – visual tidy up to improve usability. Fixed an issue where very thin lines would not always appear. Added support for better info display on the Community Events page. Fixed the issue where HUD customization was not saved on exiting a session. Fixed an issue where the Potential Lap time display on the Lap Info board would be inconsistent with the sector times being displayed.  Monitor / Spectate mode – fixed an issue where the vehicle being viewed would automatically reset to the player’s vehicle on leaving the monitor screen.   Vehicles   Adjusted handbrake strength on vehicles which are equipped with handbrakes.  Fixed an issue where the rain wipers’ state did not reset correctly when restarting a session. Fixed an issue where light glows from a vehicle behind the player would sometimes appear in front of the player. Fixed fuel pressure gauge calibration in several cars. Fixed an issue where a white border would at times appear around the brake light glow of certain cars. Ford Mk IV – improved the collision model to prevent vehicles wedging in under other vehicles. Formula Gulf, Gumpert Apollo, Formula Rookie – fixed an issue with the livery sets that caused the livery selection to display wrong liveries.  Lykan Hypersport – statistics updated to latest manufacturer specification. Lotus 72D – improved handing characteristics, exposed bump stops to be adjustable in the vehicle setup, reduced cold sensitivities of the slick tyres, adjusted the AI speed, wear and rain tires to match the player’s  experience.  Karts – reworked the Karts optimization to help address performance drops with a lot of Karts on track. McLaren 12C GT3 – adjusted the vehicle pose to more closely match the real car. BMW M3 GT4 – improved the accuracy of the levels at which the oil and water temperature warning lights will activate. Ford Escort RS1600 – improved the collision and wheel contact model to prevent climbing over other cars in collisions. 250cc Superkart – improved the default setup to address controller issues on higher speed tracks, and improved the AI handling.  Lotus 49 – improved the AI handling of the vehicle in corners and in close racing.  Pagani Huayra – reduced fuel consumption to around 3mpg in hard track use, and improved cooling to prevent engine overheating.   Tracks   Bathurst – removed cones in the pit lane that was causing cars to get stuck. Watkins Glen – fixed a number of accuracy issues around the track.  24 Heures du Mans – improved the race line at a few corners to keep the LMP cars off the curbs as this was  causing the cars to lean over on two wheels. Silverstone National – vehicle grid placement reworked to more closely align with the painted start boxes. Hockenheim (various layouts) – reworked the wet weather reflection mapping to address incorrect object reflections. Willow Springs – fixed an issue where the vehicle could drive through the barriers when exiting the pits. Sakitto and Summerton variations – corrected track info regarding number of turns and track length. Sakitto Sprint – fixed a crash that would at times occur when using time acceleration. Cadwell variations – fixed draw distance issues on various objects. Oschersleben variations – fixed odd lights around track and colour issues with the horizon. Zolder – fixed an issue where the player car would sometimes start in a closed garage."
pcars,39i6z0,drunodrundridge,1 point,Fri Jun 12 08:36:40 2015 UTC,So much for holding the competition back for a week. I had an idea that could really change the subreddit but waiting for some approval.
pcars,39i6z0,EPICJonny17,-1,Thu Jun 11 23:00:54 2015 UTC,You guys seriously asking for patch notes? They've been floating around for 2 weeks now: http://forum.projectcarsgame.com/showthread.php?29158-Project-CARS-All-Platforms-Upcoming-Patch-1-4-Release-notes
pcars,39i6z0,G2Wolf,11,Thu Jun 11 23:03:34 2015 UTC,"This people in this sub can be a little absurd, the up and downvotes are backwards.  People asking for patch notes is completely legit because: a) their forums require a login b) you said it yourself, those patch notes are weeks old.  I can't tell you how many times final patch notes change for games when they release the notes that far in advance."
pcars,39i6z0,Tex-Rob,-1,Fri Jun 12 05:14:46 2015 UTC,a) their forums require a login    No they don't?   I can't tell you how many times final patch notes change for games when they release the notes that far in advance.   They weren't going to change. The patch was held up by the approval process for consoles by Sony any/or Microsoft. It wasn't going to change.
pcars,39i6z0,G2Wolf,1 point,Fri Jun 12 15:44:40 2015 UTC,"Sony and Microsoft don't dictate PC patches, nor are they even the same."
pcars,39i6z0,Tex-Rob,1 point,Sat Jun 13 21:57:41 2015 UTC,They want patches to go out at the same time for all platforms.
pcars,39i6z0,G2Wolf,6,Sat Jun 13 22:28:55 2015 UTC,"Go in to the setting and reduce the dead zone on the sticks. Had the same issue and that fixed it. You may like 0 but it was unplayable on 0 for me, car was a twitchy mess."
pcars,39i6z0,Celestium,4,Thu Jun 11 22:29:59 2015 UTC,"Really? I don't notice that at all, it's extremely on time for me. Have you tried different controllers?"
pcars,39i6z0,Celestium,2,Thu Jun 11 22:31:42 2015 UTC,"Yeah absolutely. If it helps, I'm using a wired 360 controller. If it's wireless that may be the issue. If it doesn't do it on other games then it has to be a pCars issue. I know Walmart and Gamestop sell cheap wired 360 controllers if you wanted to spend some money, I got mine for 20 bucks at a local Gamestop."
pcars,39i6z0,Celestium,1 point,Thu Jun 11 22:39:47 2015 UTC,Try these settings:  Steering Deadzone: 3  Steering Sensitivity: 40  Throttle Deadzone: 0  Throttle Sensitivity: 70  Brake Deadzone: 0  Brake Sensitivity: 20  (Clutch settings don't apply to controllers)  Speed Steering Sensitivity: 60  Controller Filtering Sensitivity: 0  Controller Input Mode: 2  Advanced: Off
pcars,39i6z0,TooMuchCyanide,2,Thu Jun 11 22:41:31 2015 UTC,"speed steering sensitivity is presumably ""input damping"" - set it higher"
pcars,39i6z0,bobevans1,2,Thu Jun 11 22:47:16 2015 UTC,"So if I want to decrease the sensitivity at high speed, I should set this higher?   Edit: You changed my life! My main problem was the twitchiness of cars at speed, and you're right. It is input damping. My lap times have already improved and everything is so much smoother."
pcars,39i6z0,klorptar,2,Thu Jun 11 22:55:31 2015 UTC,"I noticed the same thing in Driveclub. I think it's so controller users aren't given an unfair advantage against wheel users. Besides, moving the steering wheel almost instantaneously wouldn't fit for a driving simulator (if I understand you correctly)."
pcars,39i6z0,billythemule,2,Fri Jun 12 00:19:51 2015 UTC,"Same problem here with the X1 controller on PC. I spent a LOT of time with various controller settings but found it to be best at 0 steering dead zone, 30 sensitivity, and I think 60 speed sensitivity (can't remember).  While this works really well for me, turning from one side to another is really slow, especially while drifting cause opposite locking is crucial.  Doesn't happen on Assetto Corsa."
pcars,39i6z0,CannedEther,2,Fri Jun 12 03:07:58 2015 UTC,"If you get it, just look up something like ""best controller settings for Xbox"". A few tweaks and the game plays really well with."
pcars,39i6z0,CannedEther,0,Fri Jun 12 03:36:02 2015 UTC,Is the patch out on ps4 to?
pcars,39i6z0,nightpilot,1 point,Fri Jun 12 11:08:33 2015 UTC,Coming later today

pcars,39gxh0,Atto_,13,Thu Jun 11 17:19:31 2015 UTC,Wait for the dailies.
pcars,39gxh0,Arligan,3,Thu Jun 11 18:05:10 2015 UTC,"I doubt this game will go any cheaper on Steam for a while at least.  Unless the game gets a base discount and the current 25% off, which is not going to happen so soon after release, what are they going to do?  Give 33% off?  Maybe.  Other than that though, did they just raise the fucking price of the dlc?    The new racing icons pack was $3 only 2 days ago at release...  This is some shady shit like what is going on with GTA and a handful of other titles."
pcars,39gxh0,smudi,3,Thu Jun 11 21:05:05 2015 UTC,"Well It's worth to wait for %33, I have no rush.  Pack price is same in my region."
pcars,39gxh0,Arligan,1 point,Thu Jun 11 22:25:10 2015 UTC,"They did raise the price.  Are we sure it was not on discount before?  I wanted to sell some cards so I could get it for free, sold them and will still have to break out the credit card(and eat into my sale money)."
pcars,39gxh0,Furiou5,2,Thu Jun 11 22:47:24 2015 UTC,Positive.  Base price was 3 bucks and there wasnt any info on it being a promotional offer.  Kind of odd to see them jack it up just today... after it's been out a few days.
pcars,39gxh0,smudi,1 point,Thu Jun 11 22:55:38 2015 UTC,The price of racing icons is still the same for me. Still $3.
pcars,39gxh0,Cheesenium,1 point,Fri Jun 12 04:10:44 2015 UTC,"http://imgur.com/BIIVLDa  Went up 50 cents, but still, it's very odd.  I bought it 2 days ago at 3 bucks, and I know there was no promo pricing on it, so this just feels shady."
pcars,39gxh0,smudi,1 point,Fri Jun 12 05:10:31 2015 UTC,"Still $3 in my region. Something else might had happened, I doubt they raised the prices for some regions while some other regions didnt."
pcars,39gxh0,Cheesenium,2,Fri Jun 12 05:55:49 2015 UTC,It's available at GMG for $35 right now and has been for a week or two.  It was even cheaper before that.  Being $33 I believe.
pcars,39gxh0,smudi,2,Thu Jun 11 18:06:00 2015 UTC,Any guesses to the likelihood of PCars going lower during a daily/flash sale?
pcars,39gxh0,paulharmo,2,Thu Jun 11 19:25:36 2015 UTC,It's possible but i doubt it will be much cheaper. Maybe 33% off. AC was discounted to 50% at some point but that was out longer than PCARS has been. Either way the current discount ends on the 22nd of June so if you can wait you might end up getting it cheaper.
pcars,39gxh0,Nomnom_downvotes,2,Thu Jun 11 20:17:00 2015 UTC,"It took AC 7 months to hit 50% off in last years Steam sale, just as a note."
pcars,39gxh0,smudi,2,Thu Jun 11 21:05:46 2015 UTC,"Oh was it that long? Cheers for the info, mate."
pcars,39gxh0,Nomnom_downvotes,2,Thu Jun 11 21:07:57 2015 UTC,"Yep, the game came out in EA in November 2013, and the first 50% off sale was the Summer sale in June 2014.  It also hit 50% off in August as a weekend deal.  That made the game $20.  Just 3 weeks ago, the game was also 50% off for its 3rd time, however the base price rose to $50, so with 50% off it was $25.  This is a good source of info for Steam prices"
pcars,39gxh0,smudi,2,Thu Jun 11 21:11:41 2015 UTC,"Yeah i use that site a lot. It's pretty great.   Cheapshark is also really good if you live in the US. It works outside of the US but the prices are just USD to GBP etc and pricing doesn't work like that so it's a bit off.  Still, i've had AC for that long i can't even remember when it came out lol. Love that game."
pcars,39gxh0,Nomnom_downvotes,1 point,Thu Jun 11 21:18:17 2015 UTC,"I ended up buying it now anyway, I've been waiting for awhile.  If AC hits a daily or flash sale, I might grab that as well.  Thanks for the second opinion!"
pcars,39gxh0,paulharmo,2,Thu Jun 11 20:44:37 2015 UTC,"I might get crucified in here but i much prefer AC for the driving physics so i have no problem recommending it. Both great games though, enjoy PCARS, mate!"
pcars,39gxh0,Nomnom_downvotes,2,Thu Jun 11 20:49:41 2015 UTC,"To those on the fence or worried there might be a deeper discount later:  Remember that on the last day of the sale everything goes on sale again, often at the deepest discount it reached during the sale."
pcars,39gxh0,Furiou5,-5,Thu Jun 11 22:41:28 2015 UTC,"Rip off, I got a physical copy from GameStop on release day for 50% less than the Steam price and as far as I know it's still £19.97 there. Steam sales are overrated IMO."

pcars,39hm3b,Dagmer-Cleftjaw,2,Thu Jun 11 20:12:56 2015 UTC,"It was a good decision too. In addition to all the track nonsense that the game hadn't got right, the patch, going live on PS4 today, includes this nugget: - Set Time Trials starting time to 11am to match the PC platform. This ensures consistent track temperatures across all platforms, as track temperatures affect lap times.""   So we weren't on a level playing field anyway :) SMS are writing the guide for 'how not to release a game into the wild'"

pcars,39hm3b,ArthurJason,1 point,Fri Jun 12 12:29:53 2015 UTC,"Agreed, and it will be a shame to sit on this for weeks, or even months. Other hotlap competitions I've seen on the web just allow valid leaderboard entries (a simple leaderboard screenshot), effectively letting the game decide as we've previously discussed. They don't have any problems with participants complaining or arguing among themselves. Everyone is on a level field in that situation, and I'm sure most would prefer to get started :)"

They are just selling the G27 again for 200$ more. Ridiculous.  Thrustmaster makes mechanically much superior wheels to this, and those cost the same. A TX 458 , which is belt-driven and has brushless motors goes for 300, add the pedals, it's 400$ for the same functionality as this thing.  I am curious to see how Logitech will expect to sell a load of those. Surely hope people use their brain and do some research as to what they are actually buying and how it stacks up vs the competition."
pcars,39f65a,Mikeastuto,2,Thu Jun 11 15:30:02 2015 UTC,Thanks for this post. I've never owned a wheel but since Pcars and in preparation for a likely purchase of GT7 I've been doing lots of research.   Had started to plan on waiting a little while to see if the wheel market became a little more saturated and competitive. Seemed like Logitech we're going to do that when rumors started with the G29.   Quite honestly I think they've just pissed most people off.
pcars,39f65a,Mikeastuto,1 point,Thu Jun 11 18:20:48 2015 UTC,"No problem, I never expected to get a Thank you for this post haha.  I doubt wheel market will get saturated. There are a couple of major players, Logitech and Thrustmaster for the low/med end, then Fanatec in the higher end (they have some med wheels too). MadCatz make wheels too, but I never hear about them in the simracing community and I can't say I like the other products they make. Wheels are sort of a niche market, not everybody wants one. Hence I doubt you will see tons of wheels arise.   And then you come into the enthusiast regions with stuff like Accuforce Direct-Drive wheels (1800$ for the wheel) , Hydrolic pedals (1000$) to name some things. Sim-racing can get quite crazy. But ,all that is PC exclusive, console limits the choice quite a bit unfortunately for you guys.  For the PS4, the T300RS is THE wheel to go for, it has the best mechanics for the price. The cheaper T100 (which has ffb) is a budget alternative, but it's not part of Thrustmasters Eco system ,which means it can't have different pedals, shifters and rims. In addition to that is has only 240 degrees of rotation. You really want a wheel with 900 degrees or more.  The T300RS is pretty much the 'official' wheel for PS4. Sony and Thrustmaster have a partnership. That means it will be supported by all racing games on the PS4 that benefit from a wheel.  Project CARS in particular also supports the Fanatec Porsche wheels, which are excellent choices as well. But the support for these wheels is done by Slightly Mad Studio's themselves, not officially by Sony, therfor there is no guerentee that they will work on different racing titles (like GT7)  If you want to spend around 400 bucks, and for a good wheel it doesn't come cheaper on console, get the T300RS.  Yes it's not cheap ,especially considering the price of the PS4 itself. But good racing gear is kind of a niche market, not everybody is invested enough in racing titles to buy a wheel. Unfortunatley the days where a Logitech DirvingForce GT for 110$ would give you gear joy in GT5 with all the needed functions are over. It seems everything is much more expensive and there is no good budget wheel.  If you want to go all out with no limit? Get the Fanatec Clubsport Wheelbase v2, with their (soon) new Clubsport v3 pedals and their Seq+H pattern shifter. PRice will be well above 1000$ for that setup, and you pretty much have to have some kind of rig to mount it all too.   GT Omega Racing's wheelstand is very good, it doesn't have a centerpost design that sits between your legs. Also Playseat has this thing called the Playseat Challenger, a sort of foldable sim rig. Either way, if you have a desk you can mount it there too. And lastly you can always construct something yourself if you like DIY :)  Not really a structured post, but some insight on the things I've discovered in the last years when I was buying out my equipment. I assumed you wanted a wheel for PS4, as you mentioned GT7, if it's for Xbone or PC it becomes a different story (especially on PC a LOT more possibilities for cheaper options)  Hope this post is helpful to you in some way or form. If you want to know anything ,feel free to ask. I am a tech guy , I love technology and I'd glady help you out where I can."
pcars,39f65a,Mikeastuto,1 point,Thu Jun 11 19:48:45 2015 UTC,"Haha thanks again.   Yeah, seems like Logitech was the last real hope of a quality budget wheel. Guess there is still a chance they drop the price or retailers sell it below msrp but that seems unlikely.  From the research I've don't it seems T300 or T500 is the way to go for PS4.   I've thought about the T100 but it does seem a little limited.   Any idea how often if ever retailers will put wheels on sale?"

You could spend triple that amount and go with Fanatec's stuff, but in my experience, the improvement in quality definitely isn't worth the increase in cost.  It's personal of course, but I am not rich enough to spend 3x the money for maybe 15-25%  better stuff :P"

pcars,39f65a,VindtUMijTeLang,2,Thu Jun 11 15:51:20 2015 UTC,Cheaper in the U.S. I believe. But not significantly. I think the wheel/pedal bundle for the 911 is right around $350. Clubsport is certainly more expensive than the T300.

Unfortunately Thrustmaster declined our request for an interview. It turns out there may be more to this story than PS4 security chips. Our sources told us security chips are required for full compatibility with Sony's console. That is, interaction with the system menu, Share functionality and more. But limited functionality - playing the game, including force feedback effects - is possible for wheels that work on PC and PS3 without the need for the PS4 security chip.""   It just directly says that the security chip thing is bullshit, since wheels without the chip actually do work on the PS4.  Besides, with the G29 announced, you would have to be blind not to see that it was the whole intention by Logitech themselfs - if the G27 is supported on the new generation of consoles, the G29 will be a major flop, because why pay that much for a G29 when the G27 can do the same for way below the price of a G29?"

We all know it would be in Logitech's best interest to make one wheel that is unified through all three platforms, customers like having compatibility; it would not be in the interest of the console manufacturer though(except MS because Windows); that would give you more reason to spread your library across multiple devices thus spending less money on their device."

And not too hard that you are fighting for position with a GT3 car :)   Depending on the level of immersion you might want, i'd suggest to change the damage to performance... something, instead of full damage. I've raced the career season ending event (LeMans 24H) but i wussed out and put 10% lenght.

This is one of those that you can't just hammer down. Steady and clean input, and clean throttle. Breaking its fantastic. Have to learnt o drive the car.

I know the controller is not faulty because it works fine with other games. The problem is that none of the FFB settings actually do anything.   I hate the official forums. Just fanboys ruining all the discussions and posting snarky comments like ""buy a wheel"", ""the game is designed for wheel"", etc. It'll be pointless to post there. This sub is a lot more mature and relaxed."
pcars,39fjdq,p4rtch1mp,1 point,Thu Jun 11 13:25:18 2015 UTC,Well for me the main 2 rumble motors respond to bumps and gear shifts and the secondary rumble motors for the triggers respond to brake friction on the left trigger but there is no proper feedback allowing you to feel traction/slip on the right trigger on the Xbox One controller either where as most other games like FM5/GTA do provide this FFB.  I'll need to look in to it more and see if anyone else has reported this or if it's a known issue waiting to be resolved.

Look at the top gear siarpc segment about how much time you lose around there track in the rain. In the game the ai loose about half a second."
pcars,39axc8,JamesTBagg,0,Thu Jun 11 03:59:11 2015 UTC,Okay that would make a ton of sense. I've noticed that racing in the rain is quite harder than usual (I play with the AI on 70/80 depending on my knowledge of the track) but that would explain it. I still manage to be competitive though which is good.
pcars,39axc8,Sect93,2,Thu Jun 11 04:07:15 2015 UTC,"I only put about 5 hours into the game, with probably three and a half trying to find controller settings I can play with (before the patch for XBox.)

I'm hoping it can pull a similar turn around to what BF4 did after it's horrible release. I'll try picking the game up again in a few months.

I recommend joining a PCARS Steam group if you're just looking for some casual racing.

Make sure to hold your wheel straight and don't slam down the throttle because as soon as you leave the pit-stop your tires will most likely spin out in most of the cars in pcars.

The gap between Caterham and Ford, I think it is either 2013 Ford Falcon FG V8, 2013 Ford Fusion NASCAR, 2015 Ford Mustang GT, 1966 Ford Mustang 2+2 Fastback or Ford Focus BTCC. I think the Focus and Falcon is probably those 2 cars on the list.  Lastly, the gap between Renault and Ruf it is probably 1978 Alpine Renault A442B or 2009 Renault Megane Trophy 2. It can also be Ruf RT12 or even a GT2 or GTE version of that car if SMS decides to do that like the RGT8 GT3.  Still, hopefully it is new license, not those cars mentioned above."

Otherwise, imo, you will always feel like you are playing an arcade game not a sim.  But no one NEEDS a wheel as has been said before. As for space, logitech g27 takes up little more room than a keyboard on your desk and everything can be removed and tucked away under a bed or in a closet until you want to use it again. As for pricing, watch Amazon and newegg, g27s go on sale quite often and the price might start coming down even more as more information about the new g29 becomes available.  besides logitech look at thrustmaster wheels they are similar in price and build."

The G27 feels old compared to the T300, at least it came out with the shifter. The G29 will be without. Pretty disappointed."
pcars,39b599,ChammaBrothers,1 point,Thu Jun 11 01:17:07 2015 UTC,"New logitech wheel is a G27 with new design, same mechanics for 400$ price tag. major scam. Avoid like the plague. The t300 is a belt driven wheel with brushless motors, the g29 is a rattly helical gear design,  it uses the same ancient tech the g27 uses  Which is fine, if it was priced like the G27, but it isn't,  it's double the price and doesn't even include the Shifter xD"
pcars,39b599,Mr_Burning,-1,Sat Jun 13 12:37:31 2015 UTC,you are correct i overlooked that littel tidbit.  However after a littel searching i came across this: M4 Adapter its an adapter that allows the use of G27 wheels on Ps4.  The adapter is $50 about but for some people this might be the answer they were waiting for so they don't have to buy a new thrustmaster wheel just to play on the PS4.
pcars,39b599,TheREALbread,3,Wed Jun 10 17:28:06 2015 UTC,"Yes, if you wanna play without the FFB and with input lag problem. You gonna have a half wheel. The adapter is not worth it.  Right now if you wanna play on PS4 the only choices are the T300 and T500. The T300 is the only 100% compatible."

The force feedback was not good enough to give me any feedback.  I also found out that I found it really cramped to sit on the couch with a wheel on the loungetable, which was a little too low. It didnt give me any extra feeling to the game but uncomfort. Sure: if you have the money to spend on the better wheels (+playseat) it would definitely add something to the game."

I had a blowout in a practice session with 4x tire wear on and the wheel was rattling bad on the straights before it blew out, which was on lap 16. I had no type of indication this time. Tire wear was set to real this time and lost it at lap 20. It was a different class but I don't think tires vary THAT much. Curious if that was the case, I still have more to learn about tires."

I find it almost condescending towards the customer to say ""all players will receive a free update with fixes and hardware support"".

pcars,396bft,Cheesenium,3,Wed Jun 10 03:37:21 2015 UTC,"I think the gist of it is that the community is more involved in highlighting issues and improvements in the game for the developers to work on for the next patch. Part of it is DLC such as what the community wants (where possible) in terms of cars and tracks, but other parts include the free monthly car, community liveries and additions to the base game (such as more career options is what I read somewhere). The 'On Demand' title is basically the community telling SMS what they want, and SMS then trying to do it."

You're ready if you feel like you can race clean. When you come into corners do you brake or do you use other cars as brakes? When you start a race, do you carve a nice line to the front of the pack or do you push everyone out of the way?  Race clean and the skill will come later."

Random lobby racing is purely luck of the draw. Sometimes you'll find clean rooms with actively engaging players, others you'll have what feels like a room full of entitled children playing destruction derby. Lately, it's been more of the latter for me it feels like.   Your best bet is to try to find a clean group of racers. If you luck into a clean room, add the players you know to be like minded as friends and try to run with them when possible. It's exciting when you get into these kinds of lobbies and can race real people, it brings a whole new element to the game."
pcars,397a8p,HoneysucklePink,2,Tue Jun 9 21:37:55 2015 UTC,"I disagree, the AI is a good way to judge. The only major difference the AI has with real people is how aggressive real people are."

At that kind of pace you're likely to get lapped online, as long as you understand how to obey blue flags and don't ram people off the track you should be fine. You will of course be rammed yourself, but that's just what online racing is like for reasons I can't really fathom."

pcars,394thf,Romulas,8,Tue Jun 9 07:53:52 2015 UTC,Patch 1.4 will be here in about a week hopefully that fixes many of the issues people are having.....nothing about the AI though although it has been acknowledged to turn down the aggressiveness over 80% AI strength.
pcars,394thf,cornishbrooksy,8,Tue Jun 9 09:00:39 2015 UTC,Just because game A is buggy does not mean we have to put up with it in game B.  I for one will not be buying DLC until some of the basic issues are fixed. AI being my biggest issue.
pcars,394thf,Romulas,3,Tue Jun 9 10:39:28 2015 UTC,AC also developed that DLC after they released the game and not during development of the game like pCARS obviously has done here.
pcars,394thf,LacSlyer,7,Tue Jun 9 10:47:58 2015 UTC,$5 for 5 cars in pCARS while AC is $15 for 10 cars and 1 track. I dont think AC DLC was anymore expensive than pCARS.  Both games has issues and both developers are fixing them.
pcars,394thf,Cheesenium,8,Tue Jun 9 15:18:10 2015 UTC,And the track in AC is a laser-scanned Nürburgring. I was willing to buy it for just that.
pcars,394thf,Dirt_Track_Racer,6,Tue Jun 9 14:33:12 2015 UTC,"At the end, it is the effort put into build the track. Laser scan isnt the magic pill that you will get a good quality track if you laser scan.  They can laser scan and still screw it up like Forza's laser scanned Nords."
pcars,394thf,Cheesenium,2,Tue Jun 9 14:44:51 2015 UTC,"Assetto Corsa's Nur is easily the most accurate version of the ring, every camber, bump and nuance has been articulately captured and unlike PCARS (and Forza), you can actually feel every one of them, in every single car, consistently!  Kunos and his team performed the laserscan personally over the course of 2 years in order to create the most perfect version possible with today's technology. They also went so far to capture each route; Nordschleife, Endurance, and Touristenfahrten  Forza's las-scan was pretty poor, definitely a rush job or perhaps they purchased the most affordable laser scan data possible.   You won't find a better version to drive, than the one in Assetto Corsa."
pcars,394thf,3lfk1ng,-2,Tue Jun 9 15:04:55 2015 UTC,Gran Turismo is a joke.
pcars,394thf,3lfk1ng,3,Tue Jun 9 15:24:22 2015 UTC,"Assetto corsa devs have completed the most accurate recreation of the track ever made.  Source: the people that run it the real thing, they use Assetto to train people before going out on the real thing."
pcars,394thf,fenixuk,1 point,Tue Jun 9 15:31:57 2015 UTC,"They can measure it all they want but if the data cannot be felt by the cars or the bumps don't adversely affect/upset the handling of the cars, laser scanned data doesn't mean much of anything."
pcars,394thf,3lfk1ng,2,Tue Jun 9 15:32:23 2015 UTC,$5 for 5 cars in pCARS   It's $3 not $5. pCars is definitely cheaper than AC.
pcars,394thf,G2Wolf,1 point,Tue Jun 9 15:34:56 2015 UTC,AC also has pretty bad AI. It's been patched somewhat but it's still bad.
pcars,394thf,crawlerz2468,1 point,Tue Jun 9 15:41:47 2015 UTC,It's bad for the opposite reason to pCARS AI. It's so passive that you can do insane lunges that would never work in real life.

I hope it includes Long Beach - would bring back great memories of CART Precision Racing on my Windows 98 machine back in the day! A couple of ovals would be great too, of course Indy and a perhaps a shorter oval such as the Milwaukee Mile.   Not sure how much of that would be possible due to licensing etc. but I hope it can be made to happen.  Having said all of that, getting a group of clean racers together online to maintain the discipline needed for close oval racing would seem almost impossible based on what I've seen - especially on consoles!"

Happens to me all the time with the Mercedes AMG DTM.  The cars are downloaded in a patch for all players and the DLC simply unlocks them, just like Forza."

pcars,394thf,Synner40,5,Tue Jun 9 17:39:24 2015 UTC,Both the Mclaren F1 GTR and CLK GTR are in one separate class known as GT1 in the game.   Bentley Continental GT3 goes to GT3. BMW V12 LMR and Bentley Speed 8 goes to a new class known as LMP900.

pcars,394thf,cornishbrooksy,1 point,Tue Jun 9 10:11:26 2015 UTC,Yeh steam seems to be priced slightly cheaper than consoles.
pcars,394thf,cornishbrooksy,6,Tue Jun 9 15:16:52 2015 UTC,Its not a bad price but I feel they should fix the base game before selling extras.
pcars,394thf,cornishbrooksy,12,Tue Jun 9 15:23:23 2015 UTC,Guys on big fixing are not the same guys producing content.....one team does not hold up another.....would seem a shame to hold back content for the guys that are fully enjoying the game.

pcars,394thf,Badgerisbest,1 point,Tue Jun 9 09:19:40 2015 UTC,"Well some peoples argument against the game is that it lacks some contect e.g. more cars and more tracks so some people are holding off playing until the game feels more complete in terms of content  the additional cars are good, not sure about having to pay for them though when there are so little at the moment and the game is not complete yet in more ways than one"

pcars,394thf,Gopha_Kerself,-12,Tue Jun 9 09:25:48 2015 UTC,"Ahh, now I understand - they accidentally release DLC to earn more money while the core game has issues. My mistake."
pcars,394thf,Sect93,6,Tue Jun 9 09:52:53 2015 UTC,No you don't understand. They probably have one team of people working on patches and some on dlc. Do you want team b to sit on their ass and do nothing while the other team works? This exactly how the Driveclub devs explained it while people were bitching.   I don't know what the studio is doing but one project is easier than the other. If you don't like it don't buy the dlc until you feel the issues are fixed.
pcars,394thf,NeilJHopwood,-10,Tue Jun 9 10:04:12 2015 UTC,"You don't fucking understand, they have used the (largely community funded) resources in a way that benefits them. Employ staff to create content, not fix problems. This isn't a situation that has not been forced on them, they made a conscious decision for this to happen exactly this way - more money for them, fuck the end user, milk them for more money. They might fix the problems, they might not, in the meantime they ask for more money."
pcars,394thf,Sect93,8,Tue Jun 9 13:23:45 2015 UTC,"I understand you are pissed, but those people were probably already on payroll that are making the dlc now. What should they do? Fire them? Or let them do their job? Sit and do nothing for 3 months when an AI patch might come (if they are planning one)  and then start working?   You are pissed off without providing any constructive feedback, unless you a saying that dlc should be free, which is another whole argument."
pcars,394thf,NeilJHopwood,8,Tue Jun 9 13:48:44 2015 UTC,"Some people do not understand that there are multiple departments in game development. My anology is think of a game developer as a retail store. Cashier is not responsible for floor staff. If floor staff fuck up, you cannot expect cashiers to say ""shops closed until further notice"""
pcars,394thf,Sect93,11,Tue Jun 9 14:00:46 2015 UTC,The cars must have been largely done prior to this considering they had already been leaked a while ago.
pcars,394thf,motayba,3,Tue Jun 9 14:13:26 2015 UTC,wasnt the bentley in some of the trailers?
pcars,394thf,Cheesenium,4,Tue Jun 9 14:23:42 2015 UTC,"Yep, trailers that came out before the game.  Also, notice how the file you get when  buying it only is on 1 mb. There is no way in hell 5 cars with these details can be within 1 mb.. And since PS4 has not had a single update file yet, you can be sure that these cars was in the original download / Blu-Ray disc and that they were ready from day 1, but SMS just wanted to sell them as DLC because money."
pcars,394thf,dustyjo,8,Tue Jun 9 14:36:15 2015 UTC,The art assets were finished a while ago.  The actual physics files were what was added. They were only finished a few days ago.

After all the teams are not forced upon them, they should prioritize fixing the game in my opinion, not splitting resources into smaller teams then managing to bring new paid DLC before fixing the game.  I do not understand why so many paying customers are willing to pay out more on a broken game and defending the studios misguided workforce allocation.  I really like project cars and would like to see it fixed, buying DLC when the game is in the state it is does not send the right message."
pcars,394thf,Joemartucci,6,Tue Jun 9 13:46:35 2015 UTC,"How do you find this acceptable and how can you see this as anything but a cash grab?   Because unlike you, people understand how game development works. You don't just fire vehicle artists for a month to spend more on coders and then turn around going ""jk we need you back"". The guys working on cars aren't going to be the ones digging through AI code.    After all the teams are not forced upon them, they should prioritize fixing the game in my opinion, not splitting resources into smaller teams then managing to bring new paid DLC before fixing the game.   That's not how development works, anywhere. Everyone cannot work on one thing at the same time. Period. Art guys can't do code. Code guys can't do art. You can't just throw people into jobs they cannot do, just because you think the solution is ""throw more people at the problem until it's fixed"". In reality, there's even a point where having too many people on something makes it take LONGER to fix."
pcars,394thf,Turdsworth,-2,Tue Jun 9 14:37:47 2015 UTC,"If tested properly in the first place, this would be a none issue.  Its like buying a house only to find out that the water doesn't work properly. You ask the builder about this, he then offers you a paved driveway, garage and electric gates. Well, you see the thing is we have these specialist paving guys we employed and ummm dont worry about the water we will get around to that, but what about this paving, its really cheap, only a few extra dollars, all the cool guys are getting it, so how about this paving?"
pcars,394thf,Joemartucci,4,Tue Jun 9 17:36:58 2015 UTC,"Well, you wouldn't expect the guys making the driveway to fix the water, nor would you expect the plumbers to make a driveway. They can work independently of each other, and you're getting mad just because the driveway got finished while the water is still being worked on by the plumbers.  You don't finish the driveway and then block it off not allowing anyone to use it just because the plumber isn't done."
pcars,394thf,Turdsworth,3,Tue Jun 9 17:53:36 2015 UTC,So you just expect the vehicle artists to sit around twiddling their thumbs?
pcars,394thf,MaXKiLLz,-3,Tue Jun 9 19:15:38 2015 UTC,"I expect the game to be fully working before they try and milk the customers for more money. Who would employ artists after game launch when the game is full of bugs?  Game development is an extremely transient business, don't need an artist for a few months? Get rid of him, the market is awash with talent and always will be.  This is a shameless cash grab."
pcars,394thf,Cheesenium,3,Tue Jun 9 19:38:15 2015 UTC,"So you're saying they should fire the vehicle artists and then re-hire them after they've fixed the game. Yeah, that makes sense."

Even better, the next patch is claimed to offer a performance increase. Although I'm a bit nervous because ian, the head of the studio said it'll offer a 5-7 percent performance increase, which doesn't sound like a whole lot.

Game has been out for two years now, and I just went into an online lobby..and I was the only one in it.  I can't complain too much about pcars speed of updating, especially since this isn't a huge studio like ea or something...not to mention a large part of the delay of 1.3 was due to Microsoft.

pcars,393cz8,Sweeply,4,Tue Jun 9 15:58:46 2015 UTC,We've done this poll many times before. It's the Z4 GT3 followed by the RUF then the Aston.

pcars,392h1s,jjosh-uk,2,Mon Jun 8 20:25:23 2015 UTC,I reckon they blue flagged people that Vettel was racing because they didn't expect him to be so far back on the grid even though it was a penalty

Come on now :( bit of respect for the race marshals please.  If you have the time on your hands you should volunteer at your nearest track or any local events near you, you'll find out it's not as simple as it may look! Great way to get involved with the sport too if it interests you :)."
pcars,392h1s,keeb119,2,Tue Jun 9 01:26:11 2015 UTC,But for repeatedly making a mistake like that should be grounds for fia of to ask them back.
pcars,392h1s,r3c14im3r,1 point,Tue Jun 9 17:30:57 2015 UTC,"It's a minor mistake and happens all the time, the FIA cant ask a group of volunteer track marshals not to come back, they're volunteers there to help coordinate racing at venues, they're not employed staff who return year in year out and earn a salary for doing this work."
pcars,392h1s,keeb119,2,Tue Jun 9 17:49:16 2015 UTC,"You can ask them not to come back, or say nicely your not working at our level till you can prove your getting this right. The fia doesn't have to allow certain people to volunteer. If this was an amateur event it wouldn't matter, but this is f1 were talking about.   It's like the replacement referees is American football a couple years ago, you wouldn't want them to ref the super bowl would you?  It's not one mistake, it's the repeated mistakes year after year that could dramatically impact the race. What if someone has to pit for ignoring the blue flags and comes out in front of the leaders and causes a lead change or a crash, people would be upset right?"
pcars,392h1s,fractal1382,1 point,Tue Jun 9 18:09:43 2015 UTC,"Im pretty sure race control had timing and scoring and gps data telling them exactly where each car is and whether the blue flags were correct or not. Like you said, this is F1 after all ;)"
pcars,392h1s,r3c14im3r,1 point,Tue Jun 9 19:50:25 2015 UTC,"You're making a massive deal out of such a minor mistake even if it has happened several times lol, it's not like they where acting like a bunch of hooligans and endangering the lifes of drivers and others and waving the wrong flags and screwing up the race. Some volunteer marshals are racers themselves so it's not like they don't have a clue what they're doing. It's highly organized and if you don't believe me then volunteer to marshal an event near you!   say nicely your not working at our level till you can prove your getting this right.   So you're going to tell a group of volunteers to kindly go away (leaving yourself with nobody) and practice in the lesser forms of racing until they can prove themselves worthy enough to help marshal an FIA F1 race? Don't you think F1 is messed up enough without the FIA stepping in and dismissing track marshals for wrongly waving the blue flag a few times (a very common occurrence in endurance racing, it's not a big deal for the drivers).   If the marshals coordinating the Montreal F1 race where wrongly waving another flag repeatedly such as a yellow i could understand your frustration but thankfully the marshals knew their colours well enough and done their job well. I'll refer you to /u/fractal1382 if you really want to argue the importance of the blue flag lol.  Lower levels of racing hosted by other racing associations such as the MSA, IMSA, SCCA deserve just as much dedication from the marshals and it's not a case of ""let's practice and piss around like amateurs and endanger the lifes of drivers in lower forms of racing and get it right just for the FIA and F1"". They're highly briefed by the race organizers and know what is expected from them but unfortunately people can't always get it 100% right all the time.  I don't know as i don't follow American football, sorry lol. Marshals will report a driver if they believe any wrong doing, it will then be investigated and if there is no wrong doing by the driver no penalty will be issued."
pcars,392h1s,fractal1382,2,Tue Jun 9 20:12:57 2015 UTC,"Dont worry about these kids bro, bunch of ignorant people.   Marshals are one of the most important parts of any race weekend. Without us, there is NO racing. And trust me, the folks marshalling F1 are highly qualified. We need to have almost a 100 events under our belt before we can marshal an F1 race. These guys need to put their money where their mouth is and actually go and volunteer.  I've Marshall big events like Indycar, ALMS, Tudor, etc, so I know what I'm talking about. These days I just prefer to do the regional events because the pro weekends get waaay too long. Your morning briefing is at 6 am, on our stations at 7 am, and then don't get off till 7 pm. It takes a lot of dedication and a massive love for the sport to stand in the heat, rain, cold, for free.  Thanks for the support :)  And to all you dumb ass haters, do you really think I care about your downvotes? Get a life!!!"
pcars,392h1s,fractal1382,0,Wed Jun 10 14:09:40 2015 UTC,"read my comment above, the same applies to you.  You cant fire someone who is volunteering their time and risking their life for free."
pcars,392h1s,fractal1382,1 point,Tue Jun 9 16:34:20 2015 UTC,"Im a member of the biggest marshalling club in Canada and we provide alot of the marshals for the F1 weekend.  A few points:   Blue flagging in F1 is not the same as other forms of motorsports. In a normal race a blue flag is just an advisory flag, drivers dont need to adhere to it. Whereas in F1, you get penalised if you ignore two blue flags. The marshals have special instructions on F1 weekends. Its not easy to see from behind the catch fencing, especially cars coming towards you at a 90 degree angle.  You are pretty much going by the car liveries rather than car numbers. They are not all canadian marshals. Theres a ton of guy who follow the F1 circus around the world.   So before you run your mouth, maybe you should try volunteering your time. You might learn something"

pcars,390y1s,drukqs11,9,Mon Jun 8 13:18:54 2015 UTC,"From a game developers perspective, that's latency. There's not much you can do to fix the internet or a game in that regards other than playing on a LAN. You can only refine something so much, and with as many physics simulations/calculations having to be synchronised, I don't think you'll ever fix this sort of problem. You just have to pick the people you race with better, which is why there's a latency indicator in the lobby.  All other games have it to some degree (getting shot around a corner when you swear you were in cover, etc). It's not just their latency, but yours and the hosts as well. All of it comes into play."
pcars,390y1s,pantheonpie,2,Mon Jun 8 15:21:45 2015 UTC,"I have the same issues while driving with my buddy, both having a perfectly fine connection (one is hosting the lobby and the other one joins in). When playing other games together, we usually both have a 20ms ping or lower. So I doubt that this is only due to latency."
pcars,390y1s,wheezzl,2,Mon Jun 8 15:32:01 2015 UTC,Always double or triple latency (if a third party or server is involved) for a more accurate representation of real world (you <> server <> other player).
pcars,390y1s,pantheonpie,2,Mon Jun 8 15:46:45 2015 UTC,But does PCars use servers? Not as far as I'm aware of. More like a p2p connection if I'm not mistaken.
pcars,390y1s,wheezzl,3,Tue Jun 9 07:48:19 2015 UTC,"Which can in some cases make it worse. High-end servers are hosted in data centres and get the benefits of very high quality routing to places.  Peer to peer does not, which sadly means we're more likely to see problems between user connections. I don't mean to say this is a high percentage thing, but once you start adding all of these bits up you can start to see the issue being compounded."
pcars,390y1s,pantheonpie,-15,Tue Jun 9 12:22:29 2015 UTC,"No i don't buy the latency excuse:  I was the host, we both are from the same country and he and everyone else in the lobby had ""green ping"" (all players are from the same country).  So that is not latency for sure: latency would be if all cars where 'lagging around' appearing to teleport from one place to another: thats lag and packet loss, and that was not the case."
pcars,390y1s,G2Wolf,11,Mon Jun 8 15:35:45 2015 UTC,"Doesn't matter if you don't buy it, that's how the internet works. There is some latency. It can cause things like this to happen."
pcars,390y1s,pantheonpie,8,Mon Jun 8 18:09:08 2015 UTC,"Cars jumping/teleporting around is packet loss (the game tries to predict where the car is supposed to be when it has no data). Latency is how long it takes for a packet to reach a destination. If a friend sees you behind where you actually are, that's latency; if they see you in a completely different place jumping around, that's packet loss.  I work on a small arcadey MMO and we suffered this exact issue. It was a compound issue of latency between three machines (player <> server <> other player(s)). It's still not 100% fixed in our case either, and we've come to understand through talks with other engineers that it's something everyone has to work around somehow. The more immediate a game is (ie, response is important) the harder it is to smooth over the rough edges."

It's 2 discs, you put the first disc in and I seem to remember it ran automatically, once installed, inside  of the case your game came in will be a code.

pcars,3929ut,ssultansofswing,1 point,Mon Jun 8 18:59:58 2015 UTC,Maybe it is overheating and is throddling itself to keep from burning out the motor? Have you given it some time to cool off? Worth a try if you haven't. That used to happen a lot with my old Fanatec wheel.
pcars,3929ut,doctaj5,1 point,Mon Jun 8 19:24:19 2015 UTC,"I didn't know that could be an issue. The part of the wheel with the motor didn't feel particularly hot or anything, but maybe. The session when this happened was probably the longest I've played in one sitting. I havent touched it in about an hour or two now, I'll see if giving it time has made a difference. Would yours go back to normal after giving it time?"
pcars,3929ut,doctaj5,1 point,Mon Jun 8 20:34:34 2015 UTC,"Yep. Just needed about 15 minutes or so to cool off. I hope that is the case for you as well. If not, you might have a faulty wheel. Best of luck man."

The only time I had the amount of resistance that I was used to was when I had the wheel's auto-centering turned on. I'm wondering if maybe that resistance was my wheel trying to auto-center as I turned it. There's something in the upcoming patch notes about an issue causing centering springs to be active during driving. Maybe I've just had this issue the whole time and had no idea? Because there was a LOT of resistance when I had it turned on. I'm just unsure because this is my first wheel, and have never experienced what force feedback is supposed to be like. All I know for certain is that the resistance I'm used to was only present in PCars. In Driveclub, the resistance was closer to what I'm currently experiencing."

Stuff like this is definitely expected in an online racing game like this, especially where not racing clean screws you and other around you, and that's why I much prefer the qualifying/practice sessions beforehand, as the cars are a lot more spread out and less competitive in those."

I race with clean guys on an administrated server and even then we have crashed into each other (unintentionally of course) because of lag.  Years and years ago Toca Race Driver 2 typical crappy netcode however they fixed theirs because the chaos it caused was insane. Imagine 2 solid objects appearing after latency resynchronisation and those two objects fighting for the same place in the world being instantly pushed apart at mega velocity. Al;l you could see in many races were cars ""exploding"".  Codemasters games, EA games, Kunos Simultionzoni games Turn10 all of these suffer shitty lag and it caused bad racers to cause utter carnage and it causes good racers to mistaking hit you as your real position on track inst being represented properly to the other clients connected to the lobby.  Its destroying the racing genre online.

pcars,38y5wt,avoiceoftreason,5,Sun Jun 7 21:07:11 2015 UTC,"Ask on the official forums you will get a dev response or perhaps its already been answered. I know that tyre wear questions got answered quite quickly from the dev team on the official forum  L&C is exactly what you think it is. Instead of off the throttle and instantly on to the brake you lift and coast before the intended brake point  TBH you need a race engineer to monitor telemetry to get very precise lap gain data. You can for example lift off 50 meters earlier than normal and gain X amount of fuel back, you can gain more by adding another 50 mtrs, but you will lose valuable tenths off your lap times but only gain a small percentage back over sticking to 50mtrs L&C, but this data is very precise and needs a person analysing this stuff to get useful info for you to use.  TLDR its not really needed in Pcars there aren't many races that really warrant its need"
pcars,38y5wt,EyeLuvPC,1 point,Sun Jun 7 21:14:17 2015 UTC,"Just to add, lift and coast allows you to brake later in the braking zone too so be sure to make full use of that so you don't lose too much time."
pcars,38y5wt,r3c14im3r,3,Mon Jun 8 14:10:13 2015 UTC,"I've got a few small things that may save you quite a bit of fuel over the course of a stint:  Brake Mapping:  certain cars, notably the GT3s, have brake mapping.  This means as you apply the brakes, the ECU of the car will open the throttle body to give the car some gas to prevent you from spinning.  This uses fuel.  If you want to save fuel, turn this off or as low as PCars lets you and in exchange raise up your deceleration sensitivity in the differential by a few ticks.    Also, turn off traction and stability control.  While they will not save you fuel in the same sense turning off brk map. does, it will provide a more open feel to the car.  After you get used to it, your lap times will improve significantly and you can take advantage of giving up a few tenths using lifting and coasting.  Lastly, note your speed and RPM through the fastest part of the course.  While driving through the section, turn on your telemetry to see exact RPM, torque, and horsepower.  Tune your final drive gear and highest gear to give you peak horsepower at your max speed.  This is a more advanced tuning technique, but it is important for fuel consumption.  Unless the car utilizes forced induction (turbo especially), your peak HP will not be proportional to RPMs. (Save fuel but get more power)  If your car is running a turbo, turn your wastegate setting back so the car pulls in less fuel.  Note that this will cause a direct loss of power in high RPM ranges.  Hope that helps.  I know it's a long ass post."
pcars,38y5wt,YourHomieG,1 point,Mon Jun 8 23:27:03 2015 UTC,"Lift and coast can be done at the end of the straight. This means coming off the throttle earlier, like 50 or 100 meters, from the brake zone. It depends how much fuel you need to save."
pcars,38y5wt,robraider,1 point,Mon Jun 8 14:28:43 2015 UTC,"lifting or coasting is letting the car roll without applying gas, you might also be able to save fuel by no using WOT ( Wide open throttle ) raising tire pressures, reducing drag, and maybe even taller gears. Each has a trade off..."
pcars,38y5wt,Dalandlord1981,1 point,Mon Jun 8 21:34:35 2015 UTC,Wouldnt taller gears use more fuel as youre running at higher RPMs? Its like the opposite of shortshifting.
pcars,38y5wt,InZomnia365,1 point,Tue Jun 9 15:49:47 2015 UTC,"shorter gears would eat more gas because you reach higher rpm sooner, and you would be running at really high rpm in your top gear..."

pcars,38w8hc,Cheesenium,2,Sun Jun 7 13:40:42 2015 UTC,"It has been a difficult decision for me. I love both AC and pCARS where I played both for different reasons. Personally, I do really like the slower cars in AC, such as the Fiat 500, E30 or the Z4 where AC's fantastic weight distribution shines there where pCARS's A45 felt a bit floaty. It felt great throwing the car around the corners. The GTs are good too, due to mods where I have a much greater range of GT3, GT2 and GTE in AC with all of them divided into appropriate class. Instead of pCARS putting all of them in one class. At the same time, they do drive great too and the laser scanned tracks adds a lot too where I think some tracks like Silverstone and Imola is better than PCARS version. Another thing I love about AC is, it is easy to mod it to your liking.  While for pCARS, I like how SMS handled the hypercars or Road A with cars like Lykan, Huayra and P1. They felt like I am driving a monster in pCARS where I do not really get that in AC where AC's La Ferrari and P1 felt a bit like a faster Z4. AC is still lacking a bit on personality in it's cars despite it is fun to drive in that game. pCARS has a good selection of cars in the game that ranges from classic to modern cars. Having LMPs is also a huge plus for me along with a more realistically tuned GTs in pCARS as SMS tuned and balance their cars based on FIA GT3 homogalation. I love the amount of tracks in pCARS where I never really ran out of locations to race in. Also, dynamic weather with day and night cycle is also a plus for me.  At the end, I kept both games and keep playing them. Along with Raceroom Racing Experience where the developers did an amazing job with their sound and also immersion along with a very good list of cars and tracks that both pCARS and AC doesnt have. Physics wise, i think it is something between pCARS and AC's model but I havent tried their new transmission model yet. Their massive list of Group 5s, DTMs that include 2014 and 1992 season along with rumored 90s IMSA and 90s Group C pack kept me glued to the game. Also, they have another unique list of GT3s as they have officially licensed Camaro Gt3, Corvettes, Ford GTs and also rumored that they are getting Ascari GT3s. Track list wise, they also have a pretty unique list with tracks like Moscow Raceway, Macau, Shanghai, Indianapolis and so on.  It is tough to pick one if I had to so I just play all 3 of them. Each game has its own pros and cons, more importantly, they do complement each other very well.  Raceroom is expensive to start as they sell their content separately but you can make your initial investments cheaper by buying the DTM2013 pack in a sale where it goes down to $6 from $30."
pcars,38w8hc,josh6499,3,Mon Jun 8 05:08:07 2015 UTC,"I have both of these games and it's a very tough choice between the two which I'm going to play. Obviously for the last couple weeks it's been PCARS but I have been doing a bit of AC still as well. They're both fantastic games. The biggest differences between them is that AC has Ferrari and PCARS has a lot more tracks to choose from. I'd also give PCARS the edge just slightly in the A/V department. If you could only get one, I would recommend PCARS, but you should really get both of them."

pcars,38wrdy,DarkRaven47,6,Sun Jun 7 14:19:38 2015 UTC,"Well it depends on your patience.if you want to stick with realism use only what the real cars use. Turn off as many as you can and that you are able to drive consistent laps with. Pick a car that you really like and tracks you like. Don't be hoping in and out of 10 different cars. Find the car you want to be yours and learn to drive as fast as you can.  Learn how to create and build setups. I hate the word tunes.  It takes hours and hours to learn the tracks and build good setups. Pick a track and keep making the car drive better. There are 1,000's of combinations to the setups. Figure out what works for your driving style. Learn how to drive clean and fast. It's an art to drive smooth and fast lap after lap.  Most of all have fun!!' And ask questions, that's how you learn.

pcars,38wrdy,J03130,3,Sun Jun 7 19:42:50 2015 UTC,"Depending on what car you're starting out with, I'd turn off stability and traction control as well. Learning to drive the slower cars without those will really help you get faster. Turning off ABS is your choice, as a lot of the cars in the game actually have it, where some of them don't. I personally don't use any assists, just because it's how I've always raced and I'm comfortable with it now. In terms of recommended view, it comes down to what you're most comfortable with. I wouldn't recommend the chase view, like most other racing games have, as it's weird to drive in that view with a wheel (for me anyways). I usually stick to the regular cockpit view, but for some cars I like the front bumper camera, and for the F1 cars I use the helmet camera. It's all personal preference, just try out the different ones and see which one you like most!"
pcars,38wrdy,Peanut1234,2,Sun Jun 7 14:38:21 2015 UTC,"I will just comment that don't just turn off TCS and ABS, set the game to whatever it's worded, ""real"" or something.  Basically, if the car has it in real life, it will have it in the game."
pcars,38wrdy,Tex-Rob,3,Mon Jun 8 14:08:50 2015 UTC,"Nobody else will say it, but the GT5 is what I think.  It has the best progression, and the Ginetta Jr is an amazing car to drive.  It's like a spec Miata that has better balance, power, and doesn't look terrible.  It's honestly one of the best cars I've driven in PCars.  If you go into a turn and the front starts to understeer, if you go off throttle just right the car will four wheel slide, a sign of just amazing balance.  It is predictable too.  I fell in love with it sliding the nose past the apex turning into the tunnel at Monaco (Azure), perfect balance of throttle controllable over/understeer."

For instance, the braking points for the Formula Gulf cars will be similar to the Formula A, and for GT3 it might be similar to the Clios. It should only take 3 or 4 attempts at a corner to get the braking point roughly right, then over time you can refine it to get the best lap time."

pcars,38tost,zerodb,4,Sat Jun 6 20:41:37 2015 UTC,"It's not that support is ""terrible"" it's just closer to a sim racing game and 1/2"" of thumb stick travel just isn't the right way to control it.

pcars,38uukf,VindtUMijTeLang,1 point,Sun Jun 7 07:35:22 2015 UTC,I'm also experiencing the same issue. But I believe everyone with a T300 using PS4 currently is. The latest 1.4 patch notes suggest a fix to this. How the lack of (or incredibly weak) FFB got through quality control is beyond me. I've read it may be due to the 'centring spring' always being on and therefore overriding any/almost all FFB. Fortunately the aforementioned 1.4 patch will remove the spring force during driving. The patch should be out this week. Driveclub currently genuinely gives a more realistic FFB at the moment!
pcars,38uukf,jjosh-uk,1 point,Sun Jun 7 12:37:17 2015 UTC,"If you are placing your PS4 in rest mode without closing pcars app it causes all sorts of issues. My wheel is working much better now that I don't do this. Forces are generally too strong for my liking. I like to keep fy down around 15 on most cars. Fx at around 60, fz 80, and ms around 75. Put ffb at 100 and tire force at 75."
pcars,38uukf,joking_aura,1 point,Mon Jun 8 16:59:22 2015 UTC,"I've been doing that for most of the time I've had the game. I closed the application yesterday for the first time in a long time, and when I started playing again the steering was very different. What other issues does it cause?"
pcars,38uukf,SwanseaJack1,2,Mon Jun 8 20:26:09 2015 UTC,"The wheel issue is the only i am aware of. When I said all sorts of issues I was referring to the wheel only. Thrustmasters site addresses this issue to a degree. I have not had major wheel issues since closing the application. Also every time you enter the game you will want  to go into the advanced controller settings and make sure that soft steering damping is turned off. It resets to on every time you start the game. Patch 1.4 is supposed to fix all these issues, but this has been a serviceable workaround for now."

pcars,38uqo9,EyeLuvPC,2,Sun Jun 7 13:21:36 2015 UTC,"Your handling effects these different areas.  Outside excessive heat usually comes from excessive tyre wall movement (a symptom of tyres too soft)  Middle excessive heat is a factor of many things, more so than the outer & inner (low pressures and excessive wheel spinning being the most obvious) But toe has a big impact on high middle temps/wear as does springs and dampers  The inner wall gets overheated if your camber is far too negative and your brake temps too high (not cooling down fast enough before being used again)  Reverse these to warm parts of the tyres that aren't getting up to race temp (if you notice parts of the tyres stay under working temps)  Unless you race long races, dont worry about it too much and keep to under 20 lap races  EDIT: I'm not expert perhaps someone that knows far greater detail than I can explain a bit better than I can"
pcars,38uqo9,I_CANT_POTATO,2,Sun Jun 7 21:23:17 2015 UTC,I was wondering this as well. Maybe it indicates where there is increased/decreased tire wear? I will have to test out different tire pressures on the same circuit and same car to see.

Show respect, earn respect. This is not GTA V. This is racing. Not thug vs. thug street idiots. These morons I've seen in every race are intentional wreckers. They park at the S/F line after the first lap. They try and take people out on purpose. Just go pick any ""open"" online race 85% of the time you'll see what I mean.

I said its the cleanest (As in has less issues than the console versions)  And you realise 80k paid signups/testers includes people who had multiple accounts?

The PC version still has game breaking bugs.   I very much doubt people would buy into the WMD scheme twice on any sort of noticeable scale. Tens of thousands of people apparently tested this game and it's still broken. The QA teams for other major games are far, far smaller than that, and they don't churn out a game as bugged as this."
pcars,38obwh,xImJakeyy,1 point,Sat Jun 6 13:53:00 2015 UTC,Why would people not buy in more than once on a high profit scale. If they want to earn money from WMD and pCARS why not?

pcars,38obwh,I_see_your_value_now,1 point,Sat Jun 6 16:59:53 2015 UTC,"Because you can just buy a higher tier on the investment system. Even then, I imagine the amount of people who bought multiple times is nothing compared to the 80,000 people who were testing the game."

pcars,38nv4y,CannedEther,5,Fri Jun 5 12:46:42 2015 UTC,Can brakes fail in this game?
pcars,38nv4y,why_earth,8,Fri Jun 5 13:36:51 2015 UTC,sometimes it annoys me that a game doesn't tell you all of the features (or doesn't make it obvious) e.g. brake fade.
pcars,38nv4y,smileyman118,4,Fri Jun 5 16:33:08 2015 UTC,No idea. I don't normally do more than 5 laps in one sitting. The brake temp usually rises only upto 1200. This occurred only because I was repeatedly accelerating to 250+ kph and braking hard.
pcars,38nv4y,r3c14im3r,2,Fri Jun 5 14:05:28 2015 UTC,Yes you will notice brake fade particularly with steel brakes when they overheat.
pcars,38nv4y,jmkreth,3,Fri Jun 5 15:30:33 2015 UTC,"Running formula C or B (I can't recall which now) I noticed extreme brake fade when my brakes started getting over about 1200F.  With the Formula A cars, the brakes have gotten much hotter and I haven't noticed any fade but I have had my engineer tell me to go easy on the brakes during a race."
pcars,38nv4y,jmkreth,3,Fri Jun 5 15:46:35 2015 UTC,Are these during endurance races? I've played a lot on Formula C and a little in FA but only about 3 to 5 laps at most. Never had my engineer say that.
pcars,38nv4y,nomnamless,2,Fri Jun 5 16:24:45 2015 UTC,This was during the middle of a 20 lap race or so.  I've never had an engineer say it before or since.

pcars,38nv4y,jmkreth,3,Fri Jun 5 15:17:33 2015 UTC,"On a completely random note....Good God, man, keep those tire temps up."
pcars,38nv4y,jmkreth,5,Fri Jun 5 15:47:25 2015 UTC,Any tips for this?
pcars,38nv4y,401InvalidUsername,5,Fri Jun 5 15:51:45 2015 UTC,"Depends somewhat on the car being used, but the first place I start is by lowering the tire pressure.  Less pressure = bigger contact patch = more friction = higher temps.  That alone might be enough to keep temps up.  Other factors like brake temps, camber and toe can all contribute to tire temps.  In Formula A I've had some difficulty keeping tire temps up with just messing with pressure alone.  I ended up having to start driving a little more aggressively and taking the corners faster and braking harder to keep the tires where they needed to be.  I didn't have that problem in Formula Rookie, Formula Gulf, Formula C or Formula B."
pcars,38nv4y,jmkreth,2,Fri Jun 5 16:17:21 2015 UTC,"I noticed that lower pressure wears out the tires pretty quick. In my M1 test drift setup, I temporarily dropped the pressure in the front by a lot and the tire indicator turned red on my 3rd lap."
pcars,38nv4y,IceMan_PJN,4,Fri Jun 5 16:26:14 2015 UTC,"It's a matter of finding the right balance in my experience.  The tire indicators do not provide any info on wear.  If your tires are going red, that's a temperature issue.  They've gotten too hot.  You've got to find the point where the temp stays up, but doesn't hit red."
pcars,38nv4y,SandyBunker,0,Fri Jun 5 16:27:57 2015 UTC,"So, what method is there of knowing tire wear? This game really doesn't tell you anything. Are you just supposed to go by feel alone? It's tough to tell with a controller until things are really bad, so it doesn't make sense to make a pit strategy with only that information."
pcars,38nv4y,Gamermii,1 point,Sat Jun 6 03:52:43 2015 UTC,Unfortunately it is just by feel at this point. I think 1.4 makes the degredation a bit more obvious so that will help some.
pcars,38nv4y,Cbach7,3,Sat Jun 6 05:03:46 2015 UTC,I know F1 brakes can exceed 1000° C but not sure how much beyond 1000° C.
pcars,38px1a,Peanut1234,1 point,Fri Jun 5 20:59:32 2015 UTC,"That's pretty rare for any online racing game.  It has become second nature to not trust any anonymous racer. At any point, they might deliberately wreck me. Or just suck, and wreck me."
pcars,38px1a,fleaver12,1 point,Fri Jun 5 23:02:53 2015 UTC,"On consoles the rammers are an issue. I'm on the PS4, The only way I've countered it is force assists off, force cockpit cam, lock damage full, mechanical damage on - you get the idea. The other night we ran vintage stockcars around LaSarthe. It may have been only 3 drivers including myself. But my god was it fun and real clean racing."
pcars,38px1a,lookoutblorgons,1 point,Fri Jun 5 23:07:23 2015 UTC,"I've only encountered a couple of deliberate rammers, but race starts and T1 are always woeful. That's typical of public lobby racing outside iRacing though. I'd say the two main problems are the game not kicking AFK cars from the track and there are a lot of people who spin a lot but don't rejoin the track safely."
pcars,38px1a,itsBoyso,1 point,Sat Jun 6 07:29:41 2015 UTC,"Also most of the people I see complaining about ramming can't keep their racing line or end up pushing others around without even noticing. I had somebody complain to me yesterday because we were going in a straight in 7th gear in FA, we were side by side and he shoved me into the grass which caused the front of my car to turn right and hit his left rear tire. Just because he ""never saw"" me."

pcars,38nkz3,BigSlug10,3,Fri Jun 5 11:10:17 2015 UTC,The thing about bad racers online can boil down to two major things  They simply dont get it/dont care for racing rules and etiquette  & that lag plays more of a role in contact on client based connections than we realise (in some cases you were hit and the person who hit you saw differently on their screen)

Do you get expected performance with other games/benchmarks?   That would atleast narrow it down to a pcars vs other issue. If you're seeing same issue with other games then it's obviously either a software or hardware issue.   If ""other"" issue and you're sure it's not a driver problem, then either swap the card into another machine if's thats possible to test, or swap in another hard drive and do a quick install of windows 7/8 and try again. There may be better options, perhaps there are some diag tools I'm unaware of."

You don't get the full FFB, as the console is tricked into thinking the wheel is a controller, but you can get a good turning resistance by altering the strength of the centering spring.

pcars,38mm30,SloppyOmelette,1 point,Mon Jun 8 23:45:58 2015 UTC,My point is the cost for crashing IRL is much higher than that of crashing in a game so the AI is super caucious and uses way more computing power
pcars,38mm30,seriouslulz,1 point,Tue Jun 9 00:04:32 2015 UTC,"They could easily make cars drive with proper spacing and in accordance with speed limits, etc.  The problem comes with trying to make AI race like real racers according to race rules.

pcars,38mijy,Zavorin,1 point,Sat Jun 6 00:44:52 2015 UTC,Its a shame really. Having been a member of iRacing for a few months the racing there can be utterly amazing once you leave the lowest licence  (D).Everyone brakes properly everyone is more or less runnning the same lap times so racing is clean and its rare than you get barged out the way.If you do its more like a race incident of a genuine mistake rather than a malicious attack. Its not perfect though there are some series that has its aholes (GT3 mainly) but the majority of the time a good time.But its an expensive hobby which put me off continuing ($15 per track $10-15 per car once you leave the free content in licence D)

And pCars is marketed towards broader audience than AC, and a lot of them are kids. Don't get your hopes up, unless the reputation systems starts to work. And I don't even know how it's suppose to work in design, it just doesn't make sense in current multiplayer state..."
pcars,38mijy,DarthRain95,2,Fri Jun 5 17:23:21 2015 UTC,That is a sad truth. I don't bother with AC any more.  the fault lies with the devs not bothering to implement far stricter penalties and because they don't do this online just gets worse and worse. Any new racer should support itself by supporting its players by punishing those that severely hamper other peoples enjoyment of the game from the get go. Leaving proper penalty's out of a game for too long and the damage becomes irreversible and players move on

pcars,38n2rw,Ilikeyoubignose,5,Fri Jun 5 07:39:30 2015 UTC,Anyone on the fence about getting a wheel for this game. Do it.   All players want a wheel.  The reason most don't have one is the cost of a wheel.  $89 wheels without force feedback don't factor in.
pcars,38n2rw,IceMan_PJN,2,Fri Jun 5 16:06:26 2015 UTC,I'm kind of in the wheel camp but without actually having one. I used to have the old microsoft 360 wheel for forza years ago but use an xbox one pad for project cars on the pc. The wheel is so much better but I'm unsure about which one to get (or how much I really want to spend really as I've used the thrustmaster T500rs in a local shop and found it to be amazing)
pcars,38n2rw,OriginUnknown82,2,Fri Jun 5 10:29:58 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I would have gone for the T300 as it would have run on my ps4 as well but circumstance dictated otherwise. I ended up with the G27 and to be fair, so far it's been excellent."

Itried the mercedes a bit and it feels like a boat.     Edit : I just tried it and the escort was not so bad. For me the Caterham and the McLaren F1 were the more frustating ones.
pcars,38ivbc,stnzbass,3,Thu Jun 4 20:23:51 2015 UTC,I HATED that mercedes. It's more of a straight line car than a corner one

pcars,38ivbc,ExorIMADreamer,1 point,Fri Jun 5 02:42:58 2015 UTC,They should have a Cosworth powered version. Or the RS2000 one at least.
pcars,38ivbc,MeMuzzta,10,Thu Jun 4 22:24:12 2015 UTC,Formula A has been a challenge. Also the Mclaren F1
pcars,38ivbc,Mikeastuto,4,Thu Jun 4 16:07:42 2015 UTC,Oh god the F1..
pcars,38ivbc,BlackLightzHD,4,Thu Jun 4 21:07:34 2015 UTC,"So here's my novice but relatively successful tuning advice for the F1.   Tighten the rear, both rear spring and sway bar as tight as the specs allow, keep the front end on the soft side. Maybe not all the way, but pretty soft, kind of a preference/feel thing. Also probably depends on the track. I'm currently racing on Zolder. Tire pressures down in the 1.80-1.90 range.  With those basic setting I've gone from not being able to run a full lap on the track at Zolder to turning a 1:39:92 or something like that using a DS4. I'm sure that's not very fast but it's a marked improvement and was good enough for pole position on the grid for my race with the AI at 80%"
pcars,38ivbc,Mikeastuto,2,Fri Jun 5 04:33:55 2015 UTC,"I got used to those relatively quickly.  Which means I get clean consistent laps, I still get beaten by pretty much everyone online who isn't occupied with crashing into others/walls in every corner.."
pcars,38ivbc,Mikeastuto,2,Thu Jun 4 17:50:42 2015 UTC,What kind of tuning did you do for the Formula A rides? I've actually gotten the Mclaren F1 reigned in a good bit. Feel like I'm almost at the point that I can drive it pretty hard and not fear losing it.   ... I'm also using a controller which probably just makes everything harder.
pcars,38ivbc,Mikeastuto,3,Thu Jun 4 18:14:24 2015 UTC,"I am also using a controller. I never touch the tuning, it doesn't interest me that much. I just try to work with the ""personality"" the car has and just get used to how far I can go."
pcars,38ivbc,24rocks,2,Thu Jun 4 18:21:57 2015 UTC,That's interesting. I don't necessarily love tuning but I do find it satisfying to see and feel the adjustments I make to a car in improved lap times and drivability.
pcars,38ivbc,ThatNinja4768,3,Thu Jun 4 19:04:44 2015 UTC,It's very fun in the prototype races when you take all the downforce off and you fly by everyone on the Mulsanne Straight. Good luck in the chicanes though lol.
pcars,38ivbc,Trueno07,2,Thu Jun 4 20:36:13 2015 UTC,It seems like whenever my pit tells me that my brakes are getting hot in Formula A I spin out. I think the guys voice coming through the DS4 controller startles me and I lose focus. Other than that I make sure I feather the throttle coming out of corners.
pcars,38ivbc,CARTurbo,9,Thu Jun 4 21:39:31 2015 UTC,"I have the hardest time with the caterham. I know there are others but that's the latest one to give me a healthy dose of ""hey u suck at this game""."
pcars,38ivbc,TheCrudMan,3,Thu Jun 4 16:07:44 2015 UTC,"I love the caterham, its just sliding all over the place at first and you need serious concentration to keep it together. Slow in [to the corners] and fast out works best"
pcars,38ivbc,RiftRacer,0,Thu Jun 4 17:11:34 2015 UTC,Which Caterham?  With the 160 you really need to throw it into the corner and get it sideways and ride it out to maintain momentum.   Slow-in fast-out only works when you have power to put down.
pcars,38ivbc,TheCrudMan,0,Thu Jun 4 18:37:44 2015 UTC,Slow-in fast-out always works.
pcars,38ivbc,Smithy2997,0,Fri Jun 5 02:01:27 2015 UTC,"Not with a momentum car.  Talk to a spec Miata racer.   Slow-in fast-out works because you have maximum grip to put your power down on the exit of the corner.  The problem is, what if you've got no power to put down?  You don't want to slow down any more than you have to.  The way you do that in a car like the Miata is you throw it into the corner and let it get a little loose.    Let it bleed of speed by sliding a little...keep going as fast as you can through the corner.  Doesn't make sense with high horsepower cars because you need all the grip to put the power down, but in a car like the Miata you don't have enough power to make up for what you lost under braking to maximize grip through the corner.   If you do slow-in fast-out you'll be very slow in a car like that because there just isn't any power to make you go fast out once you're already going slow."
pcars,38ivbc,RiftRacer,2,Fri Jun 5 03:42:09 2015 UTC,The Ginetta Junior is the same. You need a bit of slip to get round the corner. Although I still tend to do more of a slow in fast out than the AI.
pcars,38ivbc,lookoutblorgons,-1,Fri Jun 5 08:21:00 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I get that, but still, if you go too fast in it's gonna compromise your exit, so slow-in, fast-out still applies (as always)."
pcars,38ivbc,wpo_,10,Fri Jun 5 04:19:13 2015 UTC,"The Lotus 49 is probably the hardest car in the game to drive. I hate driving all the road cars though, they're just not fun on track like proper race cars with racing tyres."

pcars,38g9v4,klorptar,9,Thu Jun 4 00:38:19 2015 UTC,"Good PSA. I used to play Forza with all the assists off except the racing line, and a buddy said ""Turn it off, it's a crutch. You'll learn to find your brake points using the scenery and the turn signs along the track..."" and to be honest, I had never even seen the signs before -- I always had used the ""red"" to decide when to brake. I started learning the tracks without it and never looked back."
pcars,38g9v4,cregory83,3,Thu Jun 4 03:57:07 2015 UTC,"It's really surprising how quickly you learn the tracks when you aren't relying on the racing line, too. I imagine this is intimidating for a lot of people, but once you get the hang of figuring out a track it starts to feel natural."
pcars,38g9v4,threeLetterMeyhem,2,Thu Jun 4 21:00:38 2015 UTC,"Yeah, It really only takes a few laps to get a decent feel for the track."
pcars,38g9v4,cregory83,1 point,Thu Jun 4 22:26:50 2015 UTC,"Yeah, there are several unfamiliar tracks in pCARS, and I actually look forward to doing a dozen or so practice laps before racing a new track (or one I'm rusty at). Now I really wish I could go to practice from the pre-race screen rather than go all the way out to the top menu! I forget what circuit to practice by the time I get there half the time..."
pcars,38g9v4,ecnahc515,2,Fri Jun 5 12:56:57 2015 UTC,"Yep, you learn it so much faster. The first few laps are always deathly slow though, so it's a bit harder to get started on a track you haven't done before, but once you go around 2 or more times, it's pretty manageable again."
pcars,38g9v4,Piranha2004,5,Fri Jun 5 03:04:22 2015 UTC,I guess people learn at different levels but Ive always turned off the line. It nerve racking going to an unknown circuit and having to figure out the lines for yourself. Hard but rewarding at the same time.
pcars,38g9v4,Cheesenium,2,Thu Jun 4 00:59:05 2015 UTC,"I am generally bad at US tracks because they feature less often in a lot of games compared to a lot of European tracks.   For pCARS, I generally learn the track with a car that I am comfortable with such as the R8 GT3, Mclaren P1 or A45 AMG so that I could concentrate on learning the track than worrying on the fine details of the car's handling."
pcars,38g9v4,dotnilo,2,Thu Jun 4 08:24:26 2015 UTC,"The first couple of laps I push myself to go slow and safe, to get to know the track. And then once my tires are hot, I push a little harder each and every lap. It's super rewarding to see your lap times go down every lap."
pcars,38g9v4,ecnahc515,1 point,Thu Jun 4 15:15:24 2015 UTC,"Yah, I myself feel kind of like a turtle when I go through the first few laps, especially when the tires are cold. But it feels like you end up paying so much more attention when you're forced to go slow, rather than trying to just go as fast as you can from the beginning on an unknown track."
pcars,38g9v4,gibs,1 point,Fri Jun 5 03:06:00 2015 UTC,"Yeah. I'm working my way through the list of tracks using GT3 cars to learn them. After turning off the line and practicing for about a week or so, I feel like I have a better sense of how fast the car can go into a particular turn. That said, I know when I've fucked up immediately and misjudged a braking zone."
pcars,38g9v4,thephilistine_,3,Thu Jun 4 01:04:38 2015 UTC,"I find it much easier to race when I'm concentrating on the road ahead rather than the driving line. After a while, following the best racing line becomes a subconscious process, one less thing to think about."
pcars,38g9v4,otacon239,1 point,Thu Jun 4 13:23:31 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I've found that to be the case. At this point, I'm doing better without the race line than I was with it."
pcars,38g9v4,IceMan_PJN,3,Thu Jun 4 14:33:45 2015 UTC,Went no driving line recently and haven't looked back.  It just looks better too especially for endurance racing.
pcars,38g9v4,Cheesenium,2,Thu Jun 4 19:57:10 2015 UTC,"I can agree. I've been playing with a wheel in helmet cam with the same settings since release day and I seriously sucked for the longest time until I started to learn how to feather the throttle and brake before the turn, etc."
pcars,38g9v4,Pan0pticism,6,Thu Jun 4 12:45:19 2015 UTC,"PSA: Try turning off the driving line. It makes the game much more rewarding.   Everyone should've been doing this all along in all racing games. If aids like TCS and ABS are training wheels on your bike, the racing line is your dad holding the bike'a handle bars and moving the bike around for you."
pcars,38g9v4,cregory83,14,Thu Jun 4 03:51:10 2015 UTC,TCS and ABS   There is a factory setting for ABS and TC. It makes zero sense to turn it off completely because a lot of cars uses that in real life. FIA GT3 requires all the cars on the grid to have ABD and TC. It is unrealistic to turn those factory setting off as it makes the game less realistic than it actually is.
pcars,38g9v4,G2Wolf,3,Thu Jun 4 08:26:02 2015 UTC,"I changed those settings to ""real"" for that reason specifically. I couldn't personally justify turning them off completely because I know that a lot of real race cars, and of course road cars, have those and rely on them quite heavily."
pcars,38g9v4,Cheesenium,7,Thu Jun 4 14:39:08 2015 UTC,"Not only do they rely on them, but all modern GT3 cars were built around them. It is an integral part of the performance and driving characteristics of these cars. The technology involved in TCS systems has improved to the point that it is not an aid, but a performance upgrade and a necessity in cars with the power to weight ratio, weight, and firmness of a modern GT3. There is also a need to mention that most modern series have entered a cost saving era, and good TCS helps with tire wear. It is also safer. Cost savings and safety are very important parts of racing in this day and age. In my opinion, this is a good thing for all but the top tiers of open wheel.   The same goes for ABS. It used to be a hindrance at the top level of performance, but now it's an upgrade and these cars' braking systems are built around advanced ABS systems with incredibly fast and high frequency modulation. It used to be that ABS systems were pretty awful, as they still are on most production cars today. They were/are slow enough at modulating the braking that a skilled racing driver can feel it, and feel like he or she is waiting for the brakes to brake. I can assure you that this is an absolutely awful sensation on the race track, and it frustrates many braking techniques. The systems were not capable of providing consistent performance, which was exceptionally distracting to a racing driver, whose job is actually consistency rather than blistering pace(esp. GT, Touring and endurance). Again, think of cost savings and safety. Flat spotting a set of tires just is ruining a set of tires.   If we want a sim, that very often means simulating a cost effective and safe form of Motorsport. Remember that if you make a mistake in real life, you may need an ambulance and a tow truck, and there is no pause or reset car button. All drivers make mistakes all the time, usually a few times per lap. Imagine that over the course of an endurance race with varying levels of grip and wear?"
pcars,38g9v4,ecnahc515,1 point,Thu Jun 4 19:50:48 2015 UTC,Thanks for this. Really well said.
pcars,38g9v4,Halmine,4,Thu Jun 4 22:24:10 2015 UTC,"TIL a ""Real"" setting exists - thanks, great news.  I had them off to err on the side of badass, but I'm gonna switch it to real if its not already there."
pcars,38g9v4,Halmine,2,Thu Jun 4 17:20:12 2015 UTC,"Just going to point this out, there's a good chance Iceman's going to come back and argue with you since he seems to pop up in every single thread about assists bragging about how he plays without any of them and that he's better than pros."
pcars,38g9v4,josh6499,1 point,Thu Jun 4 16:35:56 2015 UTC,I can't wait.
pcars,38g9v4,MeMuzzta,1 point,Thu Jun 4 22:24:36 2015 UTC,Let him be. Playing with all assist off doesn't mean he is good or it is more realistic.
pcars,38g9v4,chamferedmind,1 point,Fri Jun 5 00:13:37 2015 UTC,"I can't argue that it's harder, and if someone wants to feel proud about that, I can't really say that's a bad thing. But it's not any more realistic, and shouldn't be that big of a deal anyways."
pcars,38g9v4,chamferedmind,2,Fri Jun 5 03:07:55 2015 UTC,And break and steering assists are like putting the bike in the boot of the car and making your dad drive you wherever you want to go.
pcars,38g9v4,chamferedmind,1 point,Thu Jun 4 08:05:50 2015 UTC,I have absolutely no clue how I did that mistake...
pcars,38g9v4,SandyBunker,2,Thu Jun 4 13:32:24 2015 UTC,I never turned it on. Too many games have them showing incorrect lines and braking zones. You're better off looking up youtube race videos of the track you're on to learn the correct line.
pcars,38g9v4,UltimateBMWfan,2,Thu Jun 4 13:47:49 2015 UTC,"You're probably right. I selected the middle difficulty when I booted up the game for the first time, and I believe it was the default mode."
pcars,38g9v4,kelday1,1 point,Thu Jun 4 13:35:51 2015 UTC,I have everything off apart from ABS and sometimes TC. It's awesome. Couldn't get the hang of the clutch with the controller though.
pcars,38g9v4,linkinstreet,1 point,Thu Jun 4 14:34:44 2015 UTC,"I don't use real damage because I noticed that it only bothers me when I'm learning a new track. It's not really necessary, because once I learn it, I hardly crash. I also use the driving assists only when on Formula A, because those cars' behaviors are really unpredictable with a game pad. I turn it off for other cars and I don't use lines and other assists. If you're waiting for the 1.4 patch to fix all of the issues, then I'm afraid you'll be disappointed, because it seems some of the AI issues are still being fixed by SMS, according to their forum."
pcars,38g9v4,92mnstanger,2,Fri Jun 5 15:34:59 2015 UTC,I'm specifically waiting for their rain performance to be fixed. It said it was being corrected in the patch notes for the upcoming release. I just can't keep up their pace when it's raining and it's messing with my career stats.
pcars,38g9v4,andrewpr,2,Thu Jun 4 02:18:50 2015 UTC,"Yes, that happened to me as well. But you can substantially decrease the AI performance using the sliders. You won't be punished. Anyway... I read on the same thread that they're fixing only the tires being slick, instead of soft. That will make the AI use the pit to change tires, but their lap times won't be improved. I can't find the exact position of the thread, but I can confirm that is expected. But we'll only see this when the update is available."

pcars,38ilmr,ecnahc515,1 point,Thu Jun 4 19:17:23 2015 UTC,"The main thing is to finish breaking before you start turning, and to be on the gas during the turn. The car is FWD, so when you break, your back wheels have no weight on them and slide out if you turn. This is solvable by breaking before the turn, and being on the gas during it, to put more weight on the back to help avoid sliding out."

But if you want the whole a clutch and shifter, then G27 is really your only choice for less than $250. You could also consider a Thrustmaster T100. They are around $150 but I honestly don't know enough about them to give a comment, but from what I have heard and read its worth the extra bit of cash to get the G27.  Honestly I would consider the TX, or the T300, and then get the shifter and pedal upgrades later on as you have the money. Having used both a g27 and TX, it's my opinion that it is superior in every way."

Increase the pressure on the rear tires. Make sure it's a lot more than the front. Reduce camber of the rear tires to something like - 0.1 or just 0. Drop the ride height as well (I can't seem to on the M1 though. Perhaps you can in the R8, I haven't tried). Reduce your fuel to about 10L (although I don't do it cause it empties out in 4 or 5 laps around Willow Springs).   Go around a curvy track. I find Willow Springs to be the best so far, although I haven't tried others. Nurburg GP might  work well too I think.

Could you not take note of the name of the team, then back out to the garage and find their livery in the car selection menu? I'm not sure if that would work, I haven't gotten around to starting the career mode yet."
pcars,38beek,Smithy2997,2,Wed Jun 3 17:01:10 2015 UTC,"No. Unfortunately the team names do not appear on the liveries. For example, I was on team AutoRebel in Formula Rookie, but my car said Cassius Racing.  I do think that choosing the same team in the same series will always get the same livery, so eventually I think it will be possible to make a list of what liveries correspond with the different teams in different series.

pcars,38beek,Fred_Zeppelin,2,Wed Jun 3 17:50:34 2015 UTC,"I think, I could be wrong, that there is a glitch regarding the liveries not being synchronised with the teams that is in the process of being patched; I seem to remember reading about it either here or on the forum."

It's completely random. Kind of bizarre."

I just lost a 2.4 hours of Le Mans because I had suspension damage 2-3 laps from the end, and I pitted to repair it. I had enough fuel to last until the end and enough gap to the second place to come out just ahead. So then it starts refuelling, which you cannot cancel once it has started, and it wasted some 20-25 seconds + plus the excessive weight I had to carry around for the rest of the race. At the finish line I was 18 seconds behind first place. I was pissed.  It's not the first time I've had races ruined like this, but I can't be 100% sure that it isn't my fault. The pit stop menu sucks, and sometimes my steering wheel isn't straight which will change all sorts of things without me noticing."

pcars,38beek,SimonCharles,1 point,Wed Jun 3 07:39:24 2015 UTC,Forums like this one suffer quite a bit from selection bias. I've bought the game on release day and until now I haven't found a single bug. I'm like you not a hard core racing player so maybe that's also why. Give it a try
pcars,38beek,TheCrudMan,4,Fri Jun 5 19:44:25 2015 UTC,"I bought Pcars when it released. I think it's good, more challenging than Gran Turismo 5/6, but better driving feel, and way better sounds. Career isn't very interesting, Gran Turismo is better even with its lackluster career mode.   Not having played racing games for a few years myself, I was bitten by the driving bug again with the sudden influx of racing games for the PC. I recently picked up Assetto Corsa when it was 50% off, and I must say that it gets a lot more of play time than Pcars for me now. The driving really feels a lot more satisfying, and in my opinion a lot of the sounds are better too. I'm no expert on driving physics, but there seems to be some sort of consensus that Assetto Corsa is more realistic and better. Some don't think that though. I personally think the greatest difference is in Force Feedback, if you use a wheel, it's loads better in Assetto. But the next patch for Pcars is slated to improve that, so we'll have to see how it stacks up after that. The AI in both games is pretty bad, so if you like races with AI cars, keep that in mind. I personally don't like AI races and mostly run time attacks and challenges, so that doesn't affect me much, but when I do drive against AI I find it aggravating.  In short, I think if you like a driving model that feels real go for Assetto Corsa (with no assists off it is very unforgiving but also very fun to drive). If you want slightly better graphics and a more polished feeling experience, and you play with assists/a controller, I think Pcars might be for you. Pcars also has more cars, although nowhere near the amount Gran Turismo has, and very few street cars, if that's your thing. Assetto Corsa has few cars as well, but it allows for addon cars from the community, as well as tracks and other mods, which is a big plus.  A final tip, Steam's summer sale is coming June 11th, so if you're playing on PC you might want to hold out for that. I'm sure at least Assetto Corsa will be discounted at some point, not so sure about Pcars since it's such a new title."
pcars,38beek,Sect93,2,Wed Jun 3 10:04:07 2015 UTC,The main thing I don't like about Assetto Corsa is it's very Italian/European focused.  Laguna Seca and Sonoma Raceway are two of my local tracks and I run them in real life.  Find myself not spending much time in a game that has neither...

pcars,38ckzo,richisonfire,3,Wed Jun 3 10:07:33 2015 UTC,"You can manually calibrate the wheel's centre by first turning it all the way to the left, then to the right and then center it so that it looks straight. Then simultaneously hold the X and Y button and press the button next to the red light. You can check the center when you open the panel on your PC.  As for the power cable I don't know, and I remember that my wheel never was set to bootloader mode either and it works fine.  Also, if you want to know how the change the rotation radius, this is how it works. It is set to 900° by default. Other settings are 540°, 360° and 270°. For me I find that 270° works best for open wheelers and that 360° is best for GT, LMP and road cars. To change the radius simply hold the mode button next to the red light and left or right on the d-pad (left to decrease, right to increase the radius). Hold it for a second and then the red light will blink green. One blink is 270°, two is 360°, etc.  Hope this helps you get the best out the wheel. I have one too and I'm loving it  Edit: no offense to /u/Scautura, but his way of fixing the center does not really work, as the center is fixed digitally, not physically."

When I first installed the drivers, I didn't need to manually set bootloader mode, so you should be fine. It just does its thing and off you go.  The wheel is screwed on to the base, rather than being mounted (like a G27) when you get it. Unscrew the ""lock"" screw underneath, then make sure the wheel is screwed on firmly before rescrewing it (mine would not go any further when it was aligned properly, you may have to adjust the wheel slightly before setting the lock screw).

I'm not debating that he cut corners, he definitely did, I'm just saying it's not bad enough to warrant the 5 or 6 second cutting penalty that the game gives you."

pcars,387q3p,DrFunkyStuff,1 point,Tue Jun 2 22:18:46 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure that Logitech has said that their wheels are lacking a chip that the PS4 requires all controllers to have.  A requirement that none of the other playstations had.
pcars,387q3p,TheSageJ,3,Tue Jun 2 19:31:54 2015 UTC,"Supposedly this is only what Logitech said to get people of their back. Sony had their own explanation and I believe older Thrustmaster wheels that are supported don't have this chip either (t100), which is why they can't be used in the ps4 menu but only in the game itself."

pcars,388lhx,Flinkergut,5,Tue Jun 2 16:50:41 2015 UTC,I think in Formula B your starting spot for the 2nd race is based off of your 2nd best lap time. I'm not sure if it was your 2nd best time during the first race or qualifying. It could be the same for Formula C. Or I could have misunderstood what I read about Formula B.

pcars,388lhx,mike3105,1 point,Wed Jun 3 15:33:41 2015 UTC,I haven't done the Formula C championship yet. I did Formula B and I'm doing A right now. I think the rule I mentioned applied to LMP1 also because I remembered starting in last for the second race a couple of times.   Edit: Now that I think about it one of them bases your starting spot on the place you came in for the first race. But the top 8 spots are flipped. So 1 starts in 8 and 8 in 1.

pcars,3879jm,MaXKiLLz,2,Tue Jun 2 12:56:51 2015 UTC,I had a practice session at Zolder where my car suffered fatal damage exiting the garage every time. Shattered windshield and buckled front end. Had to keep restarting the session until I finally exited with only a loud bang. Had me laughing.
pcars,3879jm,missiletest,2,Tue Jun 2 15:13:59 2015 UTC,"At Zolder sometimes you spawn in a closed garage, and the damage is from phasing through the door. Sent my M1 clear out of the pits, over the wall, and onto the track."

pcars,3872jn,Coolwhip120,6,Tue Jun 2 09:03:39 2015 UTC,"For driving cars it's great. But you cant paint them and shit.  also it's another mindset. In forza you race to buy a car, then race more for the next one. this is about the race itself. You select whatever class you want and your job is to learn to course and get the best positions. It's really great when you turn of Restarting and focus on driving."
pcars,3872jn,Zip2kx,3,Tue Jun 2 14:23:59 2015 UTC,"I've played everything from Papyrus Indycar to iRacing.  PCars is pretty good when it works correctly.  What I mean by that is, the game has many, many bugs and the UI needs serious work.  In single player the AI are over aggressive and pretty much oblivious to your location on the track.  In multiplayer, the bugs are a real issue.  It takes multiple attempts, of joining and leaving the host, to get on track.  When you do finally get on track, there are still problems such as invisible objects and barriers you run into, random penalties against you, driving view stuck in bumper cam, and the list goes on and on.  SMS has stated many fixes won't happen for months."
pcars,3872jn,MaXKiLLz,1 point,Tue Jun 2 12:36:45 2015 UTC,Indianapolis 500 was my first real racing game. I don't think I've played a racing game since that had such enjoyable crashes. And I loved the fact that it had replays.
pcars,3872jn,SwanseaJack1,3,Tue Jun 2 15:16:18 2015 UTC,"Coming from someone that's only really played forza on 360 and GT ages ago on ps2 this game is different. The driving is fantastic!   I honestly get wigged out just running faster lap times because it's such a challenge just to see improvement.   I got invited to a race in my career featuring only Mclaren F1s at Zolder and I've just been tuning adjusting running hot laps for a few hours just to see what makes my car faster.   I will say it's very customizable. So if you want to just pick it up and turn all the assists on its very easy to jump right in. But legitimately driving cars with no assists on different tracks is a real challenge and a real  joy when you nail it!   AI is still much to aggressive especially in the early stages of a race. Would be nice to see the aggressiveness ramp up towards the end, but it's honestly a great game and this is coming from someone who has no sim racing experience."
pcars,3872jn,Mikeastuto,2,Tue Jun 2 14:37:06 2015 UTC,"I have it on PC and love it.  Ever since it came out, I haven't touched Assetto Corsa.  I love the graphics of PCARS, I love the driving physics, I love how you can set up any race distance you want (could only do 10 lap races in single player in AC, wtf).  There are some things that could be better, but I've yet to find a perfect sim.  Every one always has some downsides.  For this game, my biggest gripe is data available to you.  You don't have much telemetry, you can't see all of your previous laps and sector times (for every single lap you've done), you can't see telemetry for a specific past lap.  Also, the replays are a bit basic, you only have a few cameras, and moving back and forth in time is only done in 20 second increments, which is very annoying.  Overall, though, consider this: PCARS is the only sim racer I play now."

But I am in agreement with you, I have barely touched AC since pCars came out, and I have put 300 hours into AC, so thats saying someting."
pcars,3872jn,VindtUMijTeLang,2,Wed Jun 3 13:13:54 2015 UTC,"Driving is amazing, not car porn like Forza as there are relatively few cars and mostly racing versions, AI needs some work but their aggression is unmatched by what the Forza Drivatars can drum up. Overall, great game."

Since I bought it I have gone to a triple screen layout with a racing seat for my wheel and I am in racing heaven!"
pcars,3872jn,SAIUN666,2,Tue Jun 2 12:30:50 2015 UTC,"In terms of driving and tracks, absolutely. Forza offers unmatched customizability, which I consider its greatest strength, but in terms of physics it's nowhere near Project Cars let alone any PC-only sim. I'd say Forza and Gran Turismo are far more forgiving, although, like I said, it's not comparable to the 'proper' sims like iRacing.  if you like Forza's driving but want more realism, this is something to check out. Going all the way to simtown requires a PC"
pcars,3872jn,VindtUMijTeLang,3,Tue Jun 2 09:37:30 2015 UTC,"While I agree, if OP wants a Forza-like driving experience then with all the aids turned on in Project Cars it's somewhat similar."
pcars,3872jn,motayba,2,Tue Jun 2 10:21:17 2015 UTC,"Agreed. The difference at that point though is that Forza is very oversteery, whereas Project Cars with assists is quite neutral. Semantics, but that characterizes the game for me"

Does this mean that cars will finally pull to the side when they're blue flagged?"
pcars,3833f5,thefx37,5,Mon Jun 1 20:28:24 2015 UTC,It has nothing to do with passing. Just means they have gone through their first round of improvements for the AI and that they'll look to improve them more and more in future patches.   Does this mean that cars will finally pull to the side when they're blue flagged   Cars aren't required to pull to the side when blue-flagged IRL. All they have to do is let the faster car past when it can without blocking. They don't have to move off the racing line to do so.
pcars,3833f5,G2Wolf,7,Tue Jun 2 00:37:36 2015 UTC,All they have to do is let the faster car past when it can without blocking. They don't have to move off the racing line to do so.   They don't do that either. They act like I'm a position behind them.
pcars,3833f5,thefx37,3,Tue Jun 2 02:25:50 2015 UTC,"Yeah I notice a lot of the time when you overtake a lapped slower car, they will try to hold that position regardless and attempt to pass you again."
pcars,3833f5,MethodM4n,4,Tue Jun 2 04:17:55 2015 UTC,"There are sections where the AI are not as skilled as they should be. For example, there is one corner and following straight @ Donington where I would pull out 1.5 seconds on them (at 100%).  This is what they are working on."
pcars,3833f5,fleaver12,0,Tue Jun 2 03:02:52 2015 UTC,"This basically translates to them exploiting the fact that physics off track does not apply to them less often.    I probably does nothing else.  To be fair, the changes we want are likely hard and very code/algorithm heavy, so I'm willing to accept that they could be working on better systems for now but just aren't done."

pcars,3833f5,thefx37,3,Tue Jun 2 02:24:56 2015 UTC,The AI loss of grip that results from tyre degradation as a result of wear is now more noticeable. The AI will now show much more realistic grip loss when running on slick tyres in the rain.    I don't get how this was even a thing. How does the Physics that applies to us not apply exactly the same to AI in the first place
pcars,3833f5,Astonex,3,Mon Jun 1 20:38:04 2015 UTC,"The player's physics is already highly demanding + the simplified physics for the AI when you're interacting with it. If the game has to simulate the same calculations for all of the cars, then you would need NASA's help. I don't think that is feasible at the moment."
pcars,3833f5,chamferedmind,2,Mon Jun 1 23:41:30 2015 UTC,They've designed it so the AI has different physics. Supposedly because it would be too processor intensive for the AI to have physics similar to the player.   It's the cause of a lot of minor bugs and issues with the game that were obvious oversights.
pcars,3833f5,LacSlyer,6,Mon Jun 1 22:34:59 2015 UTC,"Yup....Ian posted in the public forums....the physics that the player car has (in the case of the PS4) takes up a full 2 cores of processing power.  If all 45 cars on the grid used the same complex physics then it isn't going to work (obviously), so the AI run a much simplified physics system."
pcars,3833f5,GaugeFOREVER,1 point,Mon Jun 1 22:54:51 2015 UTC,does slowing them down on dirt really take that much effort?
pcars,3833f5,LacSlyer,3,Tue Jun 2 01:53:00 2015 UTC,"I think, and this is completely speculative on my behalf, that they didn't compensate for the AI when they initially designed the physics models in the game and is why they ended up scrapping it for the AI. Unfortunately it seems that due to that, or whatever the reason may be, the AI has drastically toned down physics but as well have issues that were obviously overlooked is due to time constraints. Some wet weather issues, them not pitting when required, and them not being effected by different terrain changes (i.e. curbs or grass, or even dirt and gravel) are just some of the examples."
pcars,3833f5,lordmaximus92,2,Tue Jun 2 02:00:04 2015 UTC,"Its a bug, nothing more. We had it during development where it worked properly.

pcars,3833f5,chimpyman,1 point,Tue Jun 2 07:50:32 2015 UTC,i hope it's not just tyre wear either. AI cars seem to come straight out of the pits at 100% without having to warm tires.

I do have 1 concern however... the 'League Leader Restrictions' do not sound like a good idea to me. I can only see this being a cause of frustration for many. What benefit would this bring? I can't imagine anyone enjoying changing their control configuration on a game this sensitive on the controls for example. I'd suggest keeping things as simple as possible.
pcars,38585c,Dagmer-Cleftjaw,1 point,Tue Jun 2 07:52:43 2015 UTC,"You're right. I was thinking the same after I wrote this, but I do want to give the league leader some power to make the fight to be at the top a little more interesting.   Here's what I think the league leader should have control over:   Weather Camera angle Tires Starting fuel/ending fuel"
pcars,38585c,Dagmer-Cleftjaw,2,Tue Jun 2 11:18:36 2015 UTC,"Ok, I can see where you are coming from. The one I really don't agree with is camera angle, as it is part of someone's setup (which may never change throughout the lifetime of the game and is a very personal thing) In my opinion, I would argue that giving the league leader power like this is likely to dampen the competition at the top rather than make it interesting, as the best guy gets his preferences, so may just run off ahead. If it were me, I wouldn't have any changes like this... simply have all competitors using the same rules and restrictions so that the individual leaderboard is actually of some value and people have an even fight. Promotion/relegation will keep competition interesting without the need for a complicated setup."

Maybe as part of the career mode, they could mix in tutorials as you move through the levels, with a licensing system a la Gran Turismo.  If you are struggling though, there are loads of online resources for race driving techniques and what not. Games like Forza are quite forgiving when it comes to driving and you form some bad habits. PCars makes you apply more realistic driving techniques. I am really loving that aspect of the game."

It only turns it on in cars that race with them on. GT3 makes use of them, LMP1 cars only use Traction Control, and Formula bans all of them. If you're going to realism, you should leave it set to Real."
pcars,385a58,G2Wolf,1 point,Tue Jun 2 00:32:05 2015 UTC,so as my career progresses though those different racing classes the game will know what cars and events to and not to apply the aids to?!     im actually quite impressed if thats the case.

Assist snobs are my pet peeve in racing games, it's understandable to a point saying it takes away the skill of the driver but in reality there are techniques you need to learn to make the most use out of the assists,  Something these people overlook and conveniently forget about."

You make a strong case for leaving them on real. I think one of the only reasons to turn aids off i could think of besides the added challenge is to drift, and since there is no drift mode, it would only be for a free practice when i was too lazy to go through a whole race weekend (fp1, qual, race)..."

You can find here. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5eueqw24co   Even though it's not for Pcars its concepts all apply. As for the braking issue I too have trouble with this sometimes. Your best bet is to hang back a little bit because if you are right on their tail you will also have to slow down when they make their mistake. I usually set up for passes in S-turns because you can easily work your way inside or outside of your opponent whenever the road changes direction. I like to setup my pass by slowing down on the first portion of the S and hugging the inside (Late apex), then you have the optimum apex for the inside pass. (without dive bombing) This will only work if your oppenent is movng a fair amount slower than you but odds are if they brake earlier than you on one turn they brake earlier on all of them. Just wait for your opportunity to act on their mistake. As you get faster this will become less of an issue because the drivers you are racing against will be more consistent."

pcars,382a4e,MaXKiLLz,2,Mon Jun 1 12:59:34 2015 UTC,"Warping due to high Ping is the worst I've ever seen in any multiplayer racing game.  Warping cars are all over the track.  When I say ""all over"" I really mean that.  They also rotate on their axis, spinning like a top, as they're going down the track.  I prefer iRacing's method of making the car disappear completely.  The game doesn't display a user's numerical ping in the lobby, which is very much needed."
pcars,380eky,linkinstreet,10,Sun May 31 22:43:42 2015 UTC,"This is how I try to race. My hope is that in about a month most people will stop playing, leaving those of us with appreciation for this game to continue and have clean races. Ps4 is hit or miss right now, but much better that launch week."
pcars,380eky,why_earth,12,Mon Jun 1 01:11:39 2015 UTC,"what we did last night was set the ABS and traction control off, and have a 30 minute practice session. Once people realised that both were off, they left, leaving only legit racers in the server"
pcars,380eky,nomnamless,8,Mon Jun 1 01:19:18 2015 UTC,"I would consider my self a ""legit racer"" but removing traction control or ABS on a car that normally would have it would just be handicapping me"
pcars,380eky,InsaneBirch,3,Mon Jun 1 04:44:05 2015 UTC,"Indeed. But when it leads to a better overall experience I don't see a problem. With ABS and TC on, a player would more likely to do the ""Dive on the inside move"" knowing that they would stop in time without thinking of the other car  Without both assist, one need to think where to brake without locking up, and when to throttle out without spinning, hence anyone that wants to stay on the black stuffs tends to be more diciplined"
pcars,380eky,ChammaBrothers,4,Mon Jun 1 04:49:48 2015 UTC,"I appreciate what you're saying, but that doesn't mean you're going to get better races.  Some of us struggle without some assists, not because we don't know how to race, but it's more enjoyable.  I'm not the quickest around the track compared to others but I always race clean, give people room and don't block."
pcars,380eky,KILLPREE,4,Mon Jun 1 08:06:50 2015 UTC,"I understand your point and it is right, but  now it is more likable that the rooms with abs and tc on are the ones with jerks.  I always look if there are qualify session on and no help, and usually the race is clean, because dirty racers enter the room during qualifier understand that is to hard in 1 lap and than quit. Give other people better tiime for the race"
pcars,380eky,fzed1199,1 point,Mon Jun 1 10:10:59 2015 UTC,Yep. And I don't look down on assist users. but right now it's a quick way to weed out the ones that are overenthusiastic. Nobody want to crash or ruin other people's race. But they lack the experience and judgement of people that are used to this methodological and patient racing. I mean if I grew up only playing Need for Speed I would be impatient and rash too.

pcars,380eky,keeb119,0,Mon Jun 1 04:34:18 2015 UTC,Most games cant simulate non-abs and just randomly lock. Its needed for multiplayer.

pcars,380eky,VindtUMijTeLang,1 point,Mon Jun 1 10:47:01 2015 UTC,"Lack of grip. The right tyres are too cold and hence there is no confidence.  The SLS is heavier as well, needing a longer braking distance"

pcars,380eky,Wubbajack,1 point,Sun May 31 23:59:00 2015 UTC,nice race. very clean. seen your two right tires stayed cool/cold probably could take a bar out of each and handling would improve..
pcars,380eky,Fred_Zeppelin,1 point,Mon Jun 1 01:12:39 2015 UTC,Yep. First time driving the SLS and so was quite careful. Not to mention TC and ABS were off so I was extra careful hence underheating the tyres

pcars,37zu2g,jjosh-uk,3,Sun May 31 20:15:04 2015 UTC,"So there I am: Hockenheim, F3, 15 minutes qualifying, no aids, manual gears. The most likely type of lobby to find decent fair play drivers. Qualified 5th, not great but not bad. Really looking forward to the race... then P3 sticks it in reverse and DQ's us both before its even begun.

pcars,37zu2g,fenixuk,6,Sun May 31 20:16:42 2015 UTC,"What a dick.   Just think though, that will probably only happen to you once, and you'll go on to squeeze a load of enjoyment from the game in the future.  People like this will only ever get cheap laughs and move on and miss all that."
pcars,37zu2g,IceMan_PJN,5,Sun May 31 20:23:19 2015 UTC,"I've said it before and I'll say it again - community black list.  I've suggested this with Forza before.  On Xbox you can block players and I'd imagine you can on PlayStation?  Some players just need to get together and start a sub-Reddit, website, or forum where players submit GamerTags or... I forget what they're called on PSN, ideally with links to videos showing what the offending players did, and players can choose to block them."

pcars,383uk2,tchollinginthedeep,5,Mon Jun 1 18:45:22 2015 UTC,"""I like racing games because they're fun, not because its a career I'm trying to pursue, not because it's good practice when I'm not on track in real life, just because its fun.""  This is a racing sim, its suppose to be like that."
pcars,383uk2,Newwt,1 point,Mon Jun 1 17:48:04 2015 UTC,"Fair enough, but if I may use your own words against you, its a game. A game meant to be enjoyable. If enjoyment for you is for it to be 100% sim then I can assume you would turn it off. Some people may not look at the game as you do and would rather it be turned on, still have the simulation of racing with the arcade aspect of rewind."
pcars,383uk2,LacSlyer,3,Mon Jun 1 17:59:27 2015 UTC,"And to counter that point, not all games are designed specifically for all people. So you shouldn't expect every game to have features that you desire that others don't.   I do feel for you about the AI being reckless to the point of making the career mode infuriating at times, but a rewind button isn't the answer to that."
pcars,383uk2,TuffGnarl,2,Mon Jun 1 20:13:55 2015 UTC,"He didn't say ""game""- he specifically said ""sim"". A sim that is trying, as closely as possible within console/TV/controller limits, to mimic real life where such things aren't possible.  Lastly and crucially, for less arcade and more sim oriented drivers, the fun is to be had in chasing a perfect lap, in one go, no rewinds, no mistakes. I enjoy blatting around in arcade racers as much as the next guy but sims are the Dark Souls games of the racing world- precision and perfection are demanded and, if you're up to the task, the thrill is, similarly, that much greater."
pcars,383uk2,G2Wolf,3,Mon Jun 1 18:10:19 2015 UTC,"I totally understand this, what anyone is failing to address is that if you can turn it on, you can turn it off. Why can't some people race to the full glory of a sim as you just said with the rewind turned firmly off while others, like myself, turn it on and have a slightly less rewarding but very much less stressful experience?   Like shit, turn the rewind off if you don't want it, how does it existing have any impact on your racing experience?"
pcars,383uk2,Dalandlord1981,3,Mon Jun 1 18:20:44 2015 UTC,"I totally understand this, what anyone is failing to address is that if you can turn it on, you can turn it off. Why can't some people race to the full glory of a sim as you just said with the rewind turned firmly off while others, like myself, turn it on and have a slightly less rewarding but very much less stressful experience?   It would take lots of dev time away from other more important parts of the game, and it'd also have to be disabled in multiplayer anyways."
pcars,383uk2,Dalandlord1981,2,Mon Jun 1 18:27:09 2015 UTC,"a very good point. I know they arent as simulation oriented as pcars, but i like the way rewind is implemented in Grid and forza..."
pcars,383uk2,G2Wolf,1 point,Mon Jun 1 23:05:27 2015 UTC,"upvoted both of you, as both of you make good points..."
pcars,383uk2,Fred_Zeppelin,3,Mon Jun 1 23:04:08 2015 UTC,"I find it very hard to understand why you're all okay with this game having full traction control    Because some cars DO have full traction control while racing...   • The game already has a racing line indicator, braking assistance, traction control, stability control, ABS, manual gears, etc, so it can easily be turned into an arcade game for the less skilled gamers.   Other than the racing line (which is to help less skilled players learn how to race), cars have all of those things and has absolutely nothing to do with arcade games."
pcars,383uk2,Halmine,1 point,Mon Jun 1 17:42:23 2015 UTC,"Very true, some cars do have these aids and to further support your point its also true that no racing cars have a rewind button. That's why I'm not a racing driver, I might be fast but I definitely don't have the consistency to be fast for a full race without crashing. So rather than worry about all the mistakes I might make I'd rather just go out there and drive at 100% knowing that if i screw up the magic of technology can save me by bringing my car back 3 seconds before the incident."
pcars,383uk2,Fred_Zeppelin,4,Mon Jun 1 18:02:15 2015 UTC,"I never used it on Forza, but since it would only have application in single player I don't know why anyone would have a problem with it."
pcars,383uk2,G2Wolf,2,Mon Jun 1 18:44:27 2015 UTC,Because it takes development resources. So while in principle some of us don't have anything against it we don't want them to waste their time adding something to the game that doesn't really fit in it.
pcars,383uk2,StarboardSatyr,2,Mon Jun 1 18:50:32 2015 UTC,"I agree with you and I thought of that actually...but in principle, as a future add-in (when they have more time) I don't see an issue."
pcars,383uk2,Trawgg,2,Mon Jun 1 18:53:41 2015 UTC,"The only way this would be added is if it's in Project Cars 2. Even if the devs said they'd do it eventually, it would not be happening anytime in the near future."
pcars,383uk2,keeb119,3,Mon Jun 1 20:57:17 2015 UTC,That's what makes this game adrenaline inducing. Knowing you're one corner away from wrecking and losing your pole position. That last lap is a mental test of your nerves. I love it
pcars,383uk2,eXtr3m0,2,Tue Jun 2 01:58:19 2015 UTC,"You might be playing the wrong title, friend."
pcars,383uk2,TrevorPace,2,Mon Jun 1 19:52:37 2015 UTC,"Normally I'd say we don't need it, but with the ai being stupid like it is I agree. It makes it hard to race when they are gonna,brake check ya or not care that your inside of them at apex."

I think it could be Mugello as it was removed from release due to licensing issue and it hasnt clear out yet.  We probably also get Audi A1 Quattro with that patch."

Would like the arcadey physics and cheating AI to be fixed though. Oh, well back to Witcher, and Attila with my bones. Guess I'll wait for some fan to mod their mess."
pcars,37z815,FolkSong,14,Sun May 31 18:04:23 2015 UTC,"arcadey physics   Lol. I know its not at the point of rFactor or Assetto Corsa, but its not ""arcadey"". I also highly doubt theyre going to make physics changes to a game like this after release. AI could stand to be improved, though..."
pcars,37z815,jrsherrod,2,Sun May 31 19:05:48 2015 UTC,The physics of rFactor aren't even that good. A hard game does not make a 'realistic' game.
pcars,37z6i2,Elemento1991,3,Sun May 31 17:20:37 2015 UTC,"Looks like they even implemented the lagging russian dude @ 3:25.  Funny video, man. I think its pronounced ""schleife"" kinda like ""sch + lyfe (as in, life with an 'y')"" with an audible 'e' at the end. As far as I can tell, my Norwegian word ""sløyfe"" (loop) is derived from it and its probably similar in pronunciation"
pcars,37z6i2,InZomnia365,4,Sun May 31 17:36:40 2015 UTC,"Yes, German pronunciation is purely phonetic, so the ""ei"" makes the sound of ""I"" when you refer to yourself. The ""e"" at the end is also pronounced, a bit like how you would say ""eugh"" with English pronunciation. So the full name would be kinda like ""Nord-sh-lyf-eh""."
pcars,37z6i2,superscott225,2,Sun May 31 18:01:24 2015 UTC,I've never been sure of the pronunciation honestly. It's my favorite track without a doubt though. Would love to run a few laps at some point in my lifetime.
pcars,37z6i2,satisfactory-racer,3,Sun May 31 18:56:10 2015 UTC,Good video. Have you noticed how the AI are impossibly good in wet weather? Drives me nuts.
pcars,37z6i2,MysticSpoon,2,Sun May 31 19:34:20 2015 UTC,It's like it doesn't even affect them. Not to mention heavy fog.
pcars,37z6i2,Freddy216b,3,Mon Jun 1 00:57:28 2015 UTC,The ASS is also unaffected by cold tyres. They are always at optimal temp.
pcars,37z6i2,JellyToTMonsterz,2,Mon Jun 1 01:16:57 2015 UTC,"You're driving on one of the narrowest tracks in the game, so obviously theres going to be contact. It also looks like the AI is set too low, because you're overtaking cars constantly, and that would also explain why they're ""brake checking"" you. On top of that, its not always that they're cutting into your line, most of the time you're cutting into theirs. I think the AI in this game is amazing, and you definitely carry some of the blame for a lot of these crashes."
pcars,37z6i2,lookoutblorgons,1 point,Mon Jun 1 10:24:22 2015 UTC,"They were set on 95. Any race I've had with them they smash me like crazy from behind, from the side. They are aggressive which makes the game more challenging but I don't know what was my fault in that video other than the couple bump drafts. The rest was just the AI doing unnecessary things. You should always have enough room to keep your entire car on the pavement when battling and the AI push you off all the time in this game."
pcars,37z6i2,Fred_Zeppelin,1 point,Mon Jun 1 11:47:43 2015 UTC,To be fair the AI is super slow and brakes unfathomably early for a lot of corners even on 100%
pcars,37z6i2,hawlbucker,2,Mon Jun 1 12:19:09 2015 UTC,"The AI on this game is immensely stupid. Unfortunately the devs are convinced it's great, so I don't expect any improvements.  Aggressive alone does not = good AI. Aggressive and SMART = good AI."
pcars,37z5w9,kostertim,15,Sun May 31 17:15:59 2015 UTC,I'm getting really fucking tired of qualifying up front and getting ass-blasted by some cunt who decides not to brake AT ALL at the first turn.
pcars,37z5w9,pdxhobo,4,Sun May 31 18:57:16 2015 UTC,lol ass-blasted. so true :(
pcars,37z5w9,modonaut,11,Sun May 31 22:35:16 2015 UTC,"I don't always go for the win. If I happen to crash due to someone smashing my ass, I go to the pit for a repair and drive my own race trying to catch up the slower ones. I find it fun to get better at tracks and trying to do consistent laps if I don't happen to race anyone.  The only thing that bothers me is that cars on the track don't get removed after being idle for a while. I heard they might turn 'invincible' so you don't crash into them, but it's impossible to tell if they are."
pcars,37z5w9,Sweeply,6,Sun May 31 18:19:14 2015 UTC,"I visualize the worst case scenario and therefore become emotionally prepared for stuff that would otherwise piss me off.   Really get into the idea that you'll probably get fucked. Imagine the worst crash you can think of. Go over the images over and over with a calm focus. The goal is to try to separate the happening with the emotional reaction. Things that happen to us are rarely the things that upset us, it's our reaction to those things that upset us. Getting stuck on ""Hoping for the best case scenario"" is usually what trips us up in life; including online videogames. This sounds really pessimistic, but it's not; pessimism is obsessing over bad things and feeling bad. This technique is about calmly reflecting on probable outcomes and preparing yourself for what you'll do if they take place.  As for specific in-game techniques:   I prefer to hang back if I've qualified towards the back of the grid. I let people pass me if need be. If you're mid-grid you're better off going with the flow, but it's also in mid-grid the dirty racers seem to qualify into. With experience you get a feel for what signals to look for (wobbling, jostling, poor launch). Avoiding them for the first few corners usually pays off, as they often spin out or get taken out in one of their jostling-fights.  On tracks with hairpins or sharp corners right after start the safest bet -- if you're higher up the grid-- is to use the run-off area if there is one. Nordkurve on Hockenheim is great for this. A lot of the other players will misjudge their braking point because they've been focusing on ""taking out/not getting taken out"", so a lot of them will end up needing that runoff to even stay in the race. Make it a point to use it even if you don't need it and you can avoid a lot of crap.   You could try this mantra: ""Don't overtake at the start"".   What leads most people to cause accidents at the start is they're obsessed with gaining places. They will never be happy with the places they've gained and will push themselves and everyone around them over the limit. If you play within your limits at the start you can usually capitalize on everyone else's disregard for theirs."

I think 85°C is quite high since games typically don't stress your CPU in the worst way possible. A stress test may hit higher temperatures than that. I use Prime95 and select the top option ''Small FFTs'' after starting the program.   If you want to really turn up the heat, run a stress test on the GPU at the same time such as the MSI Kombustor as it will bump up the temperature inside your case.   I wouldn't recommend anything over 90°C. If you reach that number, consider lowering the voltage or improve your cooling."

pcars,37uvrh,lookoutblorgons,8,Sat May 30 17:36:01 2015 UTC,this is the worst I've seen because of where they've stopped but pretty much every race i've done has involved at least 2 or 3 cars not starting the race and just sitting on the starting grid the entire time.

If they can't move, machinery might be utilized to lift them off the track.  I don't know of any series that would continue racing while a car is endangering the other drivers."

Apparently wets are more grippy than slicks in real life, but they don't use them in the dry because they burn out extremely quickly. The heat sensitivity in game isn't where it should be but I believe it's been tweaked for the next patch."
pcars,37u71b,Shadylurker,-6,Sat May 30 13:35:42 2015 UTC,Full wets more grippy in real life?  I seriously doubt that in any race series.  It's less surface area.  I highly doubt in any series they are a softer compound than the slicks.
pcars,37u71b,Halmine,6,Sat May 30 14:44:45 2015 UTC,They are softer...
pcars,37u71b,proxybuffer,2,Sat May 30 16:12:02 2015 UTC,"They are far softer, that's why they degrade incredibly quickly on a dry track. They'll be utterly ruined in a couple of laps if you drive with them in the dry."

pcars,37u71b,Pierre_249,2,Sat May 30 18:38:22 2015 UTC,For durability? To prevent the treads from warping? Are they really softer? I'd love to know.
pcars,37u71b,Tex-Rob,2,Sun May 31 00:50:15 2015 UTC,"Normally wet tyres are much softer. They don't reach very high temperatures due to the water on track and reduced speed, so you can make the compound much softer without compromising tyre life. The feeling of racing wets is amazing; it is like a soft putty you can really stick your finger in. The tread is only to allow the tyre to clear the water on the track so the tyre can make contact with the ground without hydroplaning."
pcars,37u71b,Halmine,0,Sun May 31 17:25:09 2015 UTC,"That's fine if they are softer, but I've never heard of full wets being faster, no matter how much people want to downvote me.  Look at an F1 car in the dry on full wets, they are slow as dirt."
pcars,37u71b,Invictavis,1 point,Mon Jun 1 04:52:37 2015 UTC,That's because they are so soft that they degrade too quickly in the dry.
pcars,37u71b,r3c14im3r,2,Mon Jun 1 10:31:47 2015 UTC,"I had a different experience with wet tires in dry conditions. Long story short, my pit boss tells me there's rain coming so I pit and put on my wet tires. A few laps later and there's still not a drop on the track, but I notice that my tires were severely overheated at that point and I was struggling to take the corners like I usually would.  Maybe something went wrong in your instance, but I definitely felt a huge difference when I put in a few laps with the wet tires."
pcars,37u71b,SandyBunker,4,Sat May 30 22:01:01 2015 UTC,"Just to put this in to perspective for you as i think you may be thinking too deeply about this - All road legal cars basically run on wet tyres in real life and they operate just fine in the dry, even recently in an Australian V8 Supercar race one of the drivers chose to exploit a loophole at the time by running wet tyres to save a set if his slicks for the race. Link to story here  It's not impossible to run wet tyres in dry conditions and get ok times, they're still made of rubber just like slicks but the tyre is more likely to heat up and wear more than a slick, the grip will not be as much as you would get out of a slick either."

Do the wheel calibration for the first one turn your wheel all you can. For the second part turn it till it says 220. Don't set it to 240 like some well known youtubers say it hinders your response time because you have to turn the wheel that much for to hit lock. And change the sensitivity from 50 to 90. 100 is too twitchy 50 is good as well if you're not too aggressive when you attack corners.

I don't know why penalties were not ""worked out"" as a general design problem like 10 years ago.  I don't know why we are still dealing with this.  Penalties should be baked into every racing game and they should be rock-solid.  They should be given just as much attention by developers as tire rubber and fetish-perfect hood ornaments.  I might even say penalties are more important to a multiplayer experience than many aspects of the actual driving physics."
pcars,37prhb,CoconutDust,7,Fri May 29 18:28:03 2015 UTC,"I agree, but I think it's a bit unrealistic to say that penalties should just be 'worked out', like it's some easy thing to program. Look at the Monaco GP issue between Verstappen and Grosjean, we're all a bunch of humans who understand context and situational elements but still can't agree on who was in the wrong/what the penalty should be/etc.  Obviously there should be a time penalty added to a situation like OP's, but then look at the other side of the coin: you're in an intense race for position when you accidentally get pit-manuevered by your opponent and you slide through the penalty zone, landing you a time penalty for something you had no fault in doing, so you finish even lower down the order that you weren't even racing.  Or look at Forza's 'sticky-grass' solution. Sure, it discourages corner cutting but you can also get pushed into it (whether on purpose or accidental) and go from 150mph to 5.  OP's situation is unacceptable, but implementing a penalty is never going to be rock-solid when the penalty system itself is nothing more than AI as well."

In my experience, impacts are a bigger problem than corner cutting because it's so disruptive.  Another novel or radical idea would be to let players earn referee status by driving safely and professionally.  Then they can give penalties based on what happened, in a short video review.  Just food for thought here.  I know this becomes a project...but we have millions of great Wikipedia articles being composed and reviewed for free for a greater good, so hey.  I first imagined a purely in-game system, but there's that too.  And from this the developers could possibly extract patterns and statistics to improve the automatic detection"
pcars,37prhb,CoconutDust,1 point,Sat May 30 15:24:18 2015 UTC,"I certainly think that giving players referee status and letting them review and vote on penalties after the race is one of the best things they could do. Like you said, it'd be a project, but that's really the most effective and realistic way to police these things. I love it and now I'm disappointed that we'll never see it."
pcars,37prhb,Punk-Fiction,1 point,Sat May 30 21:34:25 2015 UTC,"Bang on, i've saw many arguements about penalties in racing games and not once have i ever saw an out right solution on how to issue the penalties effectively and how to solve the problem of a computer having to determin who's actually at fault.   Sticky grass might stop some corner cutting at some corners but it's not an out right fix either and problems arise with this like what you've already stated. Not something i'd like to see implemented in pCARS.  Fact of the matter is unless you subscribe to a service like iRacing to promote clean racing online you really can't go in to an open public lobby and expect everybody there to respect the rules or even know how to race in general. Socializing with the clean racers you meet online and organizing a group you can always join in with really is the only way to guarantee relatively clean & fair racing for yourself, chances are the other clean racers will probably be more than happy to join or ask you to join them too."
pcars,37prhb,r3c14im3r,13,Sat May 30 11:31:20 2015 UTC,aren't they planning on releasing a patch to fix the current penalties (or lack thereof) for cutting track corners?

pcars,37p0i3,InZomnia365,8,Fri May 29 11:54:31 2015 UTC,"PCars is actually a lot closer to a sim than you might think. For all the people bashing it in YouTube comments, theyre just ""sim snobs"" (sadly, that is becoming a thing. ""My sim is the best EVERYTHING ELSE SUCKS""). When I drive the same car/track combo in similar weather in PCars, I drive it very similarly in Assetto Corsa. The only practical difference thats really noticeable is the difference in reproduction/accuracy between some of the tracks (just small things like a few meters extra here and there before a corner etc). I mean, sure I could abuse the games physics and go faster/drive differently, but the same stands true for Assetto Corsa. Thats why some people are up to 20 seconds faster than me around the Nordschleife in GT3 cars. Thats waaaay too fast and unrealistic in comparison to real life. Hell, even Im going faster than the track record in those cars, but in my case it mostly comes down to having a clean track and no repercussions for wiping out at 200kmh, rather than the physics being unrealistic. Im not good enough or fast enough to abuse the physics to that level, but it is possible in any sim, regardless of how realistic it is. Those people are what we call ""aliens"", because theyre impossibly fast :)"
pcars,37p0i3,Bixbeat,1 point,Fri May 29 16:53:35 2015 UTC,"Haha, okay, I see. How did you learn to properly drive in a simulator? I don't have a significant amount of time on practicing it, and even when I do I have the feeling that I'm going at it in the wrong way."
pcars,37p0i3,InZomnia365,4,Fri May 29 20:08:32 2015 UTC,"Personally, I jumped in with both feet and started out in iRacing. It really forced me to practice and be a safe driver because I didnt want to ruin someone elses race. At the start, its just all about practicing. You just pick up on things over time, how the car responds etc. To a certain extent, you kinda learn how the sim itself will react, regardless of what car youre driving (similar to how you passively pick up on game mechanics in any kind of game. After all, it is a game and will never be as unpredictable as real life).  I will say though, that after a certain point where you start to become relatively good/consistent at the game, you do have to start improving more consciously. Just simple things like not over-driving the car, being smooth and consistent, thinking ahead to the next corner, keeping your eyes far down the road... Basically the same things you do in a car when youre driving to the mall, you just gotta remind yourself about it from time to time. It comes a lot more naturally when youre in a real car, than when youre sitting at your desk- driving a McLaren F1 at the Nurburgring ;)  As you probably understood, Ive played a good amount, but Im still only like decent at it. Im not gonna set any top times, Im not terribly consistent, but Im probably faster than the majority in the cars that I focus on. I know people who have played way less than me and are much better, and I know people who have played as much or more than me, and are much worse. Its all about aptitude, learning ability, and of course TALENT. Fast guys are gonna be fast regardless. Give them a shitty setup, they will still be faster than me. Give me a good setup, Ill probably put it in the wall (""fast"" setups are notoriously difficult to drive, hence why only the aliens can do it). In the same vein, give a relatively slow guy a good, stable setup, and he might overperform (in that, his speed on track is better than his racecraft and understanding of maneuvering in a race situation. I hate that).    Man, I really do go on, dont I? TL;DR - just practice. Some people are naturally quick, some people struggle a bit. Its just like learning anything else; being able to understand why things happen and how to counteract from the start helps, but youre gonna learn it along the way no matter how slowly you go!"
pcars,37p0i3,BlazerMan420,0,Fri May 29 20:45:12 2015 UTC,"I came here to say this. I hate when people use this kind of line, but get something like DiRT Rally, rfactor 1 or 2, Stock Car Extreme, then get back to me. I got down voted in another thread for saying PCars was middle between arcade and sim. It's true though. Can't even control your car on pit lane try actually having to drive the speed limit and nail your box just right. Everything is tougher in an actual sim. Pcars is still fun though!"
pcars,37p0i3,InZomnia365,2,Fri May 29 13:31:12 2015 UTC,"In my opinion, PCars bridges the gap between games like Forza 5/Gran Turismo 6 and rFactor2/iRacing. Its realistic enough that pro drivers can use it as a preparation tool to get an idea of what to expect when they get on track in real life (Rene Rast has videos of him ""practicing"" for Le Mans on YouTube), but still enough of a traditional game to not be overwhelming. With assists on and ignoring the tuning aspect, its pretty easily driveable, but you can get a real challenge by maxing out if you want to (although the AI is a bit slow even at 100%).  I mean, some sims dont even have proper pitstops (Assetto Corsa). It didnt even have proper flag rules for the longest time, yet it was still one of the premier sims just for its driving experience. Though pulling into the pits after a 1-hour stint around Daytona in a 24-hour endurance event in iRacing is an amazing feeling..."
pcars,37p0i3,Dalandlord1981,1 point,Fri May 29 17:01:37 2015 UTC,"Yea this game is for those forza/gt players who want a little bit more real, and for the sim drivers who want a little more ""get in and go"". its the best bridge or compromise between true sim, and quick racer..."
pcars,37p0i3,InZomnia365,0,Fri May 29 22:29:32 2015 UTC,"Yeah. Ive been playing it non-stop in career and solo mode for the past three days. I usually go for the pure sim feeling of perfect FoV, proper shifting method, as little UI as possible, being patient in races and all that stuff when I play Assetto Corsa or iRacing etc, but this game is just fun. Its not as challenging, but that doesnt mean its not challenging at all. Its just... not as challenging. Its harder (or nigh on impossible) to spin half the cars unless you go off track (even with no aids), but thats OK. While most of our PC sims focus entirely on the feeling of driving the car around a track, PCars focuses on the entire feeling of a race situation. Also, it cant be a 100% hardcore sim, because its released on consoles. No-one would buy Assetto Corsa on consoles, as its terrible with a gamepad. Like Ive said, and you said, it sits by its own somewhere in the middle. Personally, Id still call it a sim, and I would recommend it to people who want to get into simracing (provided they got a good deal for it; maybe not for 50 dollars)."

pcars,37qtc6,r3c14im3r,6,Fri May 29 18:33:15 2015 UTC,"In addition to that one, I found this one informative:  http://forum.projectcarsgame.com/showthread.php?23153-Xbox-One-Controller-Configuration-Guide&p=893380&viewfull=1#post893380  I've done extensive google searching for things like ""Project Cars"" + ""Modes"" and +""soft steering dampening"", etc, and I've read everything I can find.  It's becoming eerie that there is just no documentation anywhere on what exactly the preset modes do.  Apparently they introduce hidden variables into the ways that deadzone/sensitivity are handled.  But what are the details?  There is plenty of blank space on the setup screen where it could be clarified.  Here's the thing that nobody is talking about yet:   the 1.3 patch made the game playable for me, finally.  I'm glad about that.  But, counter-steering happens way too quickly.  In Forza, there is famously ""Normal Steering"" and ""Simulation Steering.""  Simulation is made for wheels, where you can do sudden corrections to your steering angle with great precision.  As everyone knows, you spin out if you use simulation mode with a controller, because it's too difficult to ""catch"" your over-steer to the correct degree.    Well:  Project Cars does not currently have a ""Normal"" versus ""Simulation"" steering mode.  (There is ""Assisted Steering"", but that steers for you.)  So in most counter-steer situations, I spin out, because turning the analog stick causes my tires to almost instantly turn in the opposite direction.  Turning off ""Opposite Lock Help"" doesn't help, unfortunately.  So after much tweaking, I have two choices.  Low sensitivity, so there is no ""snap"" issue, but at the same time I cannot turn sharply.  Or, regular sensitivity, which works great, unless I have to counter-steer."
pcars,37qtc6,CoconutDust,2,Fri May 29 19:12:09 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the other link with more info :).   I ran with sim steering on FM4 and FM5 with the controller and although it's more effective with the wheel from my personal understanding and experience sim steering just meant you had to actually manage your weight transfer because of the more detailed input. It really turned FM from ""simcade"" to sim handling imo and some of the fastest leaderboard guys on FM5 who didnt use the wheel would run with sim steering too, getting the deadzones right in the controller settings and the car set up good too helped a lot here and the smoother you are with the input the more effective it is I guess, I don't mean to demean anybody's driving ability on FM5 by stating this.   Project Cars doesn't allow you to turn the more arcadey normal steering on where the game will automatically adjust your steering input through some black magic algorithm as it is strictly more on the sim side of handling characteristics and possibly the sudden responsibility of having to properly manage weight transfer is what is frustrating and catching people out along with the clusterfuck of information about the settings and set ups at the moment like you suggested.   I notice the handling in pCARS to be relatively similar to to the handling characteristics in FM with sim steering on (i actually find the cars in pCARS more grounded and stable than in FM with the exception to the road cars tbh) with the controller and basically afaik none of the options or settings (no matter how hard you try) on pCARS will have the effect of normal steering turned on in FM5.  If managing weight transfer is what is troubling some people then I suggest having a bit of a time out from fast laps and have some fun drifting a car around a circuit for a bit until you're comfortable throwing the car around!"

Nvidia physx runs at 50Hz, also on CPU (even if you have nvidia GPU).

pcars,37ofz8,eastcoastgamer,3,Fri May 29 19:04:49 2015 UTC,It is because pcars depends a lot more on the CPU than the GPU due to high 600Hz physics engine and intensive first principle based calculations. The physics in pcars calculates everything from each engine stroke cycle to turbos to heat transfer between tarmac-tires-brakes. Most games out there runs at lower calculation frequency and uses a less demanding calculation model. Your i3 is the bottleneck in your case.   Dirt Rally and F1 does not depend as much on CPU as pcars.

I'll copy you a post I made in the project cars forum  "" And the worst part is, when the game runs half decent on time trials,  without any other cars on track. it'll randomly drop fps and cause me to either crash or invalidate the lap time. Shadows flash, textures glitch out and flicker. If I crash my car or blow my engine in a race, the replay is ruined because it will apply that same damage or smoking engine to the whole replay. At the start of a race when doing a rolling start, when the AI has control of your car and others, they will race ahead causing the AI controlling my car to race up and crash into the back of them, causing a messed up start with damage. Other times the cars will start sideways causing crashing while under AI control. Sometimes the car you're driving will join the kerbal space program and launch into orbit on contact with another car/invisible object.

pcars,37oyce,Trawgg,3,Fri May 29 13:28:06 2015 UTC,"I started simracing a couple of years ago. I started out in iRacing, though I wouldnt recommend that. Previously, I wouldve probably recommended getting Assetto Corsa on sale, or GameStockCarExtreme, but I think Project Cars is my go-to recommended sim for people new to it. Its enough game that it wont get too confusing, but still realistic and deep enough to provide a real challenge for a long while. Many people complain about the car list, but that really isnt a problem for simracers. Assetto Corsa shipped with a lot fewer cars and tracks (although it supports modding), for example. People who complain about the car lists etc arent simracers, theyre just racers. This inst the type of game to just hop into a car for 10 minutes, then do something else. Its a learning experience. It might not be quite as in-depth and hardcore as some of the other PC sims, but its definitely a big step up from Gran Turismo and the likes. If its good enough for Rene Rast (pro race driver, GT and LMP cars), then its good enough for me.  AFAIK, most of the bugs have been on the XB1. The game has a few issues other than that, but those arent really ""bugs"" per se, but rather things that needs improvements going forward.  All in all, solid game. Ive been playing it non-stop since I picked it up three days ago. I have probably close to 1000 hours on PC sims like iRacing, Assetto Corsa and GSC, and really, PCars isnt much different. All those sims I mentioned behave a little differently and do some things better than others. PCars has the best out-of-the-box contant package, but it doesnt support modding as far as I know. It also has great sound (which, ironically, isnt the case for the other sims) and unprecedented day/night and weather cycles.  Just make sure you save up for a wheel. It makes a world of a difference."
pcars,37oyce,hindey19,2,Fri May 29 16:40:28 2015 UTC,The game has so much potential and I'm loving it apart from the bugs.  The amount of bugs isn't really acceptable for a full retail copy. The developer has almost finished a major patch to fix a lot of stuff though so fingers crossed.

pcars,37okr2,Dalandlord1981,-7,Fri May 29 18:43:45 2015 UTC,I think you meant to say X-Boners.
pcars,37phcn,thefunkaygibbon,2,Fri May 29 11:13:47 2015 UTC,Higher pressure = less surface area = less grip = lower temperature.   Lower pressure = more surface area = more grip = higher temperature.
pcars,37phcn,Dettol_hand_wash,1 point,Fri May 29 13:39:46 2015 UTC,Don't you mean lower tyre pressure lowers tyre temp and higher tyre pressure will raise tyre temp?
pcars,37phcn,r3c14im3r,2,Fri May 29 13:53:04 2015 UTC,"Higher cold tire pressures can actually aid in lowering the temps unless your over-drive it, because they will have less rolling resistance and movement under cornering."
pcars,37phcn,InZomnia365,1 point,Fri May 29 17:04:40 2015 UTC,"In this instance you would be driving well below the tyre grip threshold though.  The tyre will have less rolling resistance at the expense of grip, it will have a tendancy to slip more on the tarmac creating more friction between the tyre and tarmac, when the tyres do heat up they will bypass the optimal temp and overheat if the tyre pressure is too high."
pcars,37phcn,r3c14im3r,1 point,Fri May 29 18:59:51 2015 UTC,"Ill admit Im not a wizard when it comes to tire pressures and temperature, but heres what it tells you in the Garage (setup editor) in iRacing when hovering over the cold tire pressures:   Air pressure in tire as measured when the tire is ""cold"" (room temperature); lower pressure = more heat buildup, better grip at lower loads; higher pressure = less heat, better grip at higher loads   Thats what I based my comment on. As I understood it, you will lose grip at high loads if your tire pressures are too low because the tire will bend too much and provide a smaller contact patch. Similarly, a tire that is has too high pressure will lose grip under load because its not flexible enough, thus provides a smaller contact patch. Too high pressures and you will wear the tire by scrubbing/skidding. Too low pressures and you will shred the outside of the tires quickly when cornering, since the tire wall is basically being skewed vertically by the weight of the car. That was my understanding of it atleast, but I am hardly a setup wiz. Those examples were extremes, as well.  Tire pressures and temperature, like everything on a racecar, is a fine-tuning process. It also depends a lot on the weather and track conditions."
pcars,37phcn,InZomnia365,1 point,Fri May 29 20:21:06 2015 UTC,"I am vaguely aware of tyre pressures, but did think that I had it wrong. So, on pit I updated the tyres to exactly the same as the start of the race. Those ones lasted 15+ laps, give or take.   After pit, less than two corners.  Definitely a bug, although I appreciate this reply thread, it helps me on proper pit strategies should this be OK in other vehicles"

What the rhyme or reason behind the 3 presets is.  Like:  do they roughly resemble controls from various other racing games?  Are the 3 presets somehow derived from three different player/driver styles?  Is one for ""old broken"" analog sticks?  I find it weird that there's these 3 presets with no explanation.  Sure, I can study the settings, and make my own conclusions about the nature of each preset…..but I find this confusing because from my tests (before the patch; haven't tried the patch yet) the ""Deadzone"" setting did not at all correspond to what the term deadzone is supposed to mean.  And no official explanation for speed sensitivity.  It's ""steering becomes less sensitive as you gain speed"", but I don't know what else might be programmed in here.

So for the first couple laps of practice or qualifying, just take it slow and let the AI pass you (don't try to match it's pace) until you get the tires out of the blue range and can start to push.   Tire temps are very similar to Forza in my experience, you want them between 200-220 degrees in most cases. Adjust pressure to get them in range."
pcars,37ksqb,Fred_Zeppelin,1 point,Thu May 28 16:42:52 2015 UTC,That was driving me nuts! No wonder the AI murder you off the line haha.
pcars,37ksqb,Sindroome24,2,Thu May 28 16:45:12 2015 UTC,"For races it's a bit different, your tires are already mostly warm at the start and you can push about 90% on the first lap, and then push 100% from then on. I've been killing the AI on race starts so that might just be a technique issue, it's not really a tire thing."
pcars,37ksqb,Fred_Zeppelin,2,Thu May 28 16:47:20 2015 UTC,"Should only take about half a lap to nearly a full lap to get up to temp depending on your set up and the track length. When they're blue the tyres are cold, green is within the operating temp and red is overheating. Look at the telemetry and check the temps manually too and see if you have to add/reduce pressure.  It's not really a drive from the get go game like FM5 was, you really need to put time in to setting the cars up that your going to drive and then managing them around the circuit (depending on difficulty level also) but even the default set up on the Clio i never found too bad tbh.   The 1.3 patch has definitely fixed the steering issues so my only suggestion really is spend more time with the game, tweaking the set up to your preference and learning how to handle the car if you're having difficulties with it too."

pcars,37n31x,BigHowski,3,Thu May 28 21:05:02 2015 UTC,"Just a guess, but does it tend to pull left while braking on a clockwise track, and pull right while braking on a counter-clockwise (anticlockwise for the Euro) track?  It could be that your left tire is near optimum temp, and your right isn't, causing your left to grip more. This has definitely happened to me.  If that is what you're experiencing, try a little less brake input, or even set your tire pressure individually between left and right to get both at optimum temperatures."
pcars,37n31x,fleaver12,1 point,Thu May 28 23:26:21 2015 UTC,Not tried it on an anticlockwise track. I suppose it could be tyre temp but it seems a bit extreme to slam me straight in the wall. Can you bring up the temp on the xbox one?
pcars,37n31x,G2Wolf,1 point,Fri May 29 07:18:00 2015 UTC,"Tire temperature shows up in the bottom right corner near your fuel, speed, etc.  (blue = cold, green = good, red = hot)  Go to the telemetry hud to get tire and brake temperature, showing actual temperatures instead of just the colors. (toggle your hud a few times to get to it)"

pcars,37n31x,drunodrundridge,2,Fri May 29 07:15:43 2015 UTC,Use telemetry and keep an eye on tyre temps. If you haven't made any change to the stock car setup - it may just be the tracks corners causing uneven tyre heating.  More pressure = colder tyres + less grip..  Less pressure = hotter tyres + more grip..
pcars,37lrzs,VindtUMijTeLang,2,Thu May 28 15:33:50 2015 UTC,"You can put on soft tires without a problem if you arent havin mega high tire wear. But just put as much fuel in it as possible, because the fewer pit stops = the better. Also, the brake ducts probably dont have to be that great, nor the downforce level."
pcars,37lrzs,Sect93,2,Thu May 28 16:12:29 2015 UTC,"There are a good few high-speed corners on Circuit de la Sarthe, though, so I wouldnt knock down the downforce too much. With the draft you get on the Mulsanne straight is pretty significant so speed there shouldnt be an issue. Youre right about the cooling ducts, though. Lots of high-speed sections to cool down."
pcars,37lrzs,InZomnia365,5,Thu May 28 17:07:36 2015 UTC,All I can tell is that I am fastest with the lowest amount of downforce I have on that track at least. IRL they too carry as low downforce as possible because of the 4 big significant straights :)
pcars,37lrzs,Sect93,3,Thu May 28 17:10:00 2015 UTC,"For sure, I was just suggesting that there might be a balance.

pcars,37lrzs,InZomnia365,0,Fri May 29 06:29:16 2015 UTC,"You had 67 liters at start? I wouldve thought you'd need a lot more than that. Circuit de la Sarthe has a lot of long straights which burns a lot of fuel.  How long of a race are you doing? Do some practice laps, then check what your fuel consumption per lap is, then calculate accordingly. As for tires, I dont know how much tire wear plays into effect as I havent gotten to, or done any long endurance races in the GT cars. I know from experience in other sims that the tires would be gone way before you had to pit, but I dont think its as huge a deal in PCars. If its true what /u/Sect93 said, and that you can go with softs for the entire stint, then thats great (although not very realistic :P) as they obviously have better grip.

pcars,37l8fd,Traditionel,2,Thu May 28 13:09:59 2015 UTC,"Preset 2 is working great for me after the patch. The straight line twitchiness and the instability in corners has all pretty much gone. The trigger rumble is barely noticeable for me. You pretty much have to slam the breaks to get it to kick in, still no right trigger feedback or indeed anything to give an early warning that you're losing grip."
pcars,37l8fd,p4rtch1mp,2,Thu May 28 16:49:31 2015 UTC,"Yeah I'm pretty upset with the trigger rumble. It doesn't even rumble until after grub has been lost. It'd be nice if it started right when you're on the edge of losing grip like in forza. Same for throttle trigger. Honestly I also wish trigger rumble was a separate setting from force feedback. I don't understand the controller rumble in this game. I'll be driving straight and it will be rumbling and I'm not even going fast. And it rumbles for each gear change? Why? I feel as if the rumble is just distracting in this game. I'd prefer if it only rumbled when bottoming out, making contact with a wall or other cars, going into grass/sand, and touching apex strips etc."
pcars,37l8fd,MysticSpoon,1 point,Thu May 28 19:14:51 2015 UTC,"yea, the rumble still isnt directed at the triggers for me, instead the the vibrations come from the center of the controller... good enough for now, but it would be nice to have the trigger feel of forza5"
pcars,37l8fd,Dalandlord1981,2,Fri May 29 22:04:09 2015 UTC,Quick update for me. After trying some suggested settings I went back to basic 2 without changing nothing. Here is what I love after just 5 laps.  No more loosing grip on rear tire after a normal turn. We can go left then right and take back the rear to get to the next apex.   My question for those who understand the settings ( there is nothing like a bubble that explain what settings do when hovering around ) is what did you change from settings 2 to make it even better ?   Game is definitely playable and even my friend on PC told me he could get a hang on this. This is far from perfect but at least I can now start playing this game.
pcars,37l8fd,Sindroome24,2,Thu May 28 21:29:43 2015 UTC,Basic 2 eh? I'll see. 3 is just garbage.
pcars,37l8fd,Fred_Zeppelin,2,Thu May 28 21:58:25 2015 UTC,So here is my final update. Had to spent another hour from changing my car ( kart oto formula ) to get it to grip again and possible to have fun. I did not succeed in any ways to make this feel right. I will let this game for players who have a wheel and I wont trust this game company anymore. When your car sim is that fubar for 90% of players ( I doubt more then 10% or car sim players have a wheel ) you say so when you advertise it.  For me there are way too many good games right now and Forza 6 before Xmas that is just not possible to justify 10+ hours trying to get this to work. That's not from the 12 hours or so from Day 1 frustration.
pcars,37l8fd,StarboardSatyr,1 point,Fri May 29 00:22:38 2015 UTC,I really want to see what everyone thinks. I'm stuck at work for 7 more hours. The early returns in the official forums sound very promising.

If you were expecting the patch to make this game more like forza5 you will get your hopes up.     I find that, not only the controller settings, but TUNING SETTINGS ARE VITAL.

On a side note, is it just me or is the Mclaren the car of choice for trolling drivers in multiplayer? The other day I got into 3 consecutive GT3 races (all different lobbies) and the guys driving the orange livery Mclarens were all trying to spin everyone out. Or they'd just park in a straight hoping to ruin someone's race.   Not that I judge people for choosing that car but when I see that orange Mclaren on the grid it makes me a tad nervous."

pcars,37hgbx,Allard1994,6,Wed May 27 17:41:03 2015 UTC,"Take a late apex out of both hairpins.   Stay to the left when exiting the first turn to line up the second. Stay in the middle of the track as you enter the second turn, don't dive in on the kerb just yet. If you're all the way inside too early, you won't be able to maximize exit speed. Start to move in tighter to the inside after passing the midway point. There is a very subtle apex about 2/3 of the way through that hairpin, you want to be all the way inside at that point. Once you have the late apex lined up, you can start to accelerate through it for corner exit.  I would draw a line but I don't have the tools on my work cpu.  Edit: I'm not sure of the exact gears, but typically the second turn is taken a gear lower than the first."

pcars,37hgbx,J03130,2,Wed May 27 17:42:55 2015 UTC,You can enter the right hander after the tight left ALOT faster than you think. Try that if you haven't already.

pcars,37hgbx,Rawdll,1 point,Thu May 28 12:56:25 2015 UTC,Have you fiddled with the downforce? Try putting the rear DF 1 notch more towards cornering. That should aid in keeping the arse planted during rapid directional changes.
pcars,37hgbx,J03130,1 point,Thu May 28 13:14:19 2015 UTC,You cant tune in time trials sadly.
pcars,37hgbx,Dettol_hand_wash,3,Thu May 28 17:21:49 2015 UTC,I've found a way around that. Adjust what you think needs changing in your garage and apply it to the track. It's a ballache to trial and error a tune but it gives you the edge over people who haven't figured that out yet.
pcars,37hgbx,lookoutblorgons,2,Thu May 28 17:52:12 2015 UTC,Tune in quick race weekend on an empty track during practice.
pcars,37hgbx,snakkles,3,Fri May 29 13:45:58 2015 UTC,"Okay so I had a go at it, and took 0.9s off the previous record on the PC leaderboards. Not sure what platform you're on or whether the leader is faster/slower than this but here's my lap.  For the left hander I brake at the 50m board and take a tight line into the corner. I take your problem corner in 3rd gear. Stay wide in the first part of the corner then try to make the exit as straight as possible to get on the power nice and early.  I imagine anyone running times faster than 40.9 has tweaked the setup quite a bit. I have a feeling it might be possible to take Copse flat out with a lot of fine tuning."

pcars,37hgbx,AndyZ88,1 point,Thu May 28 11:58:36 2015 UTC,Downshift to 2nd or 3rd? I use DRS to boost out of the 2nd turn into the stretch.
pcars,37hgbx,InZomnia365,1 point,Thu May 28 12:56:05 2015 UTC,"Depends on your gear ratio. I would consider setting 3rd low, or 2nd high, specifically to nail that corner"
pcars,37hgbx,lookoutblorgons,1 point,Thu May 28 15:46:46 2015 UTC,I found 2nd high risky. Too much power and you're spinning.
pcars,37hgbx,InZomnia365,1 point,Thu May 28 16:48:54 2015 UTC,"I don't understand where exactly you are using DRS...... but since you also mention oversteer and spinning I gotta ask if you're using it right... The DRS works by moving the flap of the rear wing and stalling it, thus cutting a lot of the rear downforce. Don't use it unless you are pretty much on the straight, with minimal lateral load."

Stupidly often i get Rammed off the road for no reason. a little push or bump is nothing i cry out for, but if you suddenly end up in a Different Dimension than you know it wasnt a Push but you got hit by the ""Back to The Future"" Train. Usually its the latter one and not the little bump.   Rules should be Forced every race without any exception and than REAL rules not the acceleration downgrade nonsense things or ""Lap Time Invalid"" , none cares about that anyways."
pcars,37fbgt,r3c14im3r,1 point,Mon Jun 1 19:13:09 2015 UTC,"The penalty system isn't perfect and will be improved over time but i doubt any revolutionary changes will happen anytime soon. If you or anyone else here can come up with an effective penalty system that a computer can efficiently enforce without error then i'm sure the devs would be very keen to hear from you!  I agree with you on this though, I'm not a fan of the slow down in the middle of the track penalty as is, i think it does more harm than good and creates a dangerous obstacle for others to avoid in most cases. I would prefer a drive through time penalty over this or a time delta a driver has to manually stick to for their lap. If not adhered to then drivers automatically get a DQ from the race but again, easier said than done and many, many, many other discussions about this has already been had including on multiple other racing platforms.  It's hard enough for the race director & stewards to make the proper call and to get pro racing drivers to adhere to all the rules. Unfortunately this is the internet where people will exploit anything they can, in an open public race it's hard to enforce rules and it's near impossible to expect people to respect them even if there is meaningless (to them) consequences for their actions."
pcars,37fbgt,ninetenduh,1 point,Mon Jun 1 22:28:37 2015 UTC,"I do understand it is hard to enforce an Effective system that everyone in the end will follow, but since Project Cars wants to be a serious Racing game i think they have to figure something out otherwise the current system will be its downfall, The slow Down Penalty only comes in effect if you cut the track, no matter if you did it on purpose or got pushed by the one behind you. anddd outside the Qualifiying none cares about an invvalid lap time if it means you can still finish first even thought you just rammed 5 people off the road."

pcars,37fbgt,avoiceoftreason,1 point,Thu May 28 10:05:17 2015 UTC,That doesn't answer why there are so many issues with a game that was delayed so long. MS and Sony might delay a patch but it feels like the developers made a game for the XBox without ever playing on an XBox. Or that they spent more money on hype than on quality control.    I have high hopes for this game once they fix the things they should have fixed during their delays.

pcars,37fbgt,r3c14im3r,1 point,Sat May 30 23:04:03 2015 UTC,"It's a 'speed boost' of 80 BHP (if I remember correctly) for 6-7 seconds per lap, that you can use to overtake or defend a position - but you'll mainly be using it to accelerate a little faster onto the longest straights.   At Spa, for example, I use roughly 1/3 coming out of la source, 1/3 when reaching the top of eau rouge, and 1/3 on the straight leading into blanchimont. (That's how I do it in Codemasters' F1 games, which doesn't necessarily mean it works in Pcars as well).  I also use it to correct mistakes; if you get a bad exit you can use a squirt of KERS to get back up to speed again quicker. You'll have to experiment to see what improves your lap times more: blowing all the KERS on 1-2 straights or using a little bit all over the place.  In real-life F1 it was only usable when going over 100kph, I don't know if that's the case in the game.  In LMP1 it's deployed automatically to improve the torque at lower revs, just like it does in F1 since 2014."
pcars,37fbgt,horrace_clapsaddle,3,Sat May 30 19:34:45 2015 UTC,KERS is Kinetic Energy Recovery System.  It recovers a car's kinetic under braking for storage and eventually usage when the driver wants.  I don't really notice much difference on the game either. This is probably because the impact it has is quite minimal really. You'll gain speed faster and that is about it. The best place to use it is out of corners or in someone's slipstream.

pcars,37fbgt,AxelFHD,2,Wed May 27 13:44:25 2015 UTC,Everyone gave you worthless explanation. A technical explanation tells you nothing.   DRS opens flaps in your spoiler. Makes you go faster. Any time you have a straightaway use it. You will see the DRS on the bottom right light up. Either braking or clicking again will turn it off.   WARNING you can't do any meaningful turn with it on. You will spin out. Keep using it though all the time.   KERS it's a turbo boost. The bar on the bottom right. When there is a lighting bolt on it you can use it. Braking refills it. But you can only use one full bars length every lap. You can use while turning. Getting out of a turn or straightaway is a good time.   Good luck and practice using the DRS whenever going straight.
pcars,37fbgt,AxelFHD,6,Sun May 31 22:12:03 2015 UTC,"DRS is Drag Reduction System. ""Folding down the wings"" at high speeds."

pcars,37fbgt,AxelFHD,2,Wed May 27 14:54:50 2015 UTC,"Lol thats perfect. Technically, it doesnt ""fold down"" the spoiler (well, in some cases it does), but usually just evens out the wing angle, so that it can quickly be tilted back into effect."
pcars,37fbgt,AxelFHD,3,Thu May 28 00:02:39 2015 UTC,"Kers has already been answered by Honeysucklepink so: DRS, AKA Drag Reduction System, is when you change the rearwing of for example a F1 car so it produce less downforce but generates less drag. That means a faster acceleration and better topspeed, so its something you apply on straights."
pcars,37fbgt,AshRolls,10,Wed May 27 13:59:10 2015 UTC,KERS = Kinetic Energy Recovery System  It is the recovery of a vehicle's kinetic energy under braking for storage and then usage when you slam the throttle down.  DRS = Drag Reduction System  It is a driver-adjustable piece of bodywork on the rear wing. It's purpose is reduce aerodynamic drag and increase top speeds.

pcars,37fbgt,Creep-In-a-Tshirt,2,Wed May 27 13:16:32 2015 UTC,"From my very basic understanding of specular irradiance it's to do with a light source that shines off reflective surfaces so for example, the sun is your light source and the wet tarmac is your reflective surface.

Judging by the screens you posted it's one of the few post processing options is potentially worth leaving on.   The others are in photos, but so badly implemented into the game that they are just annoying after a few laps.  That lens flare is a fuckin joke, it flickers on and off and on off and onoffonoffonoff nothing like a real lens flair does. It's also almost entirely solid. I have a few L lenses now, including the 400 and I've never seen a single lens I own behave like that.   I'm not saying I don't like the effect, I actually do, I think the colour, sun stars etc all work well, but it should fade in and out and not just flick on and off and be stuck on the screen with hardly any transparency.

pcars,37fbgt,glessner,1 point,Wed May 27 10:10:19 2015 UTC,"Do you use a controller, or a wheel?  Secondly:  you mentioned you have several great laps, and then a spin.  The crucial question is:  do you make minor mistakes, and eventually spin, or do you race superbly and then spin?  If your first mistake is a severe spin, I would say that's because of snap counter-steering.  The 1.3 patch is a great improvement for me on Xbox One, but counter-steering is too difficult to control.  In Forza there was ""Normal"" steering mode (for controllers) versus ""Simulation"" steering mode for wheels.  Wheels allow for precise, sudden, drastic corrections.  It's more difficult on an analog stick to input a specific amount of counter-steer.  Thus: everyone used ""Normal"" steering on controller.   Project Cars does not have a controller ""Normal"" mode, it's only Simulation steering.  So for me, almost any time I have to counter-steer, I lose control.  I can have a perfect race as long as I don't accidentally cause oversteer which I then have to correct with counter-steer.    If you make a fair number of smaller mistakes, and an eventual spin, that is clearly a progressive process.  Specifically, either your tires or your level of focus has deteriorated (or both)."

pcars,37fbgt,morchi83,1 point,Wed May 27 19:16:11 2015 UTC,"Well, lowering the pressure means more rolling resistance and more heat buildup. You should try upping the pressure instead. That said, default/close to default pressures should be OK for the most part. I play a lot of iRacing, and I have to consciously remind myself to take it easier when I feel that Im pushing too hard. 9 times out of 10, you'll go faster once you shake your head and relax.  Ive yet to encounter red tire temps, what kinda cars / distance are you driving? Also, spinning and going off track easily overheats the tire as well. Its a good idea to take it easy for about a lap after a spin/visit to the sand trap, because if you dont cool down the tire enough, its just gonna stay overheated and shred itself to pieces (I dont know how well that is modelled in this game, but the same principles apply regardless).  Edit; oh, and when its your front tires, it usually means youre cornering too hard (hard brakingzone into a right-hand turn will mostly load you left front etc), while if its rear tires its usually a sign of wheelspin on corner exit."

I raced in a league on F1 2012-13 with a bunch of British guys. It was partly the inspiration for this league's launch. I woke up at 4am every Monday morning to race with these guys. I still had to go to school that morning. Stupidest thing I've ever done, I seriously don't recommend it. On the bright side, I did make some friends that I talk to quite regularly."

pcars,37dwdh,Dalandlord1981,0,Wed May 27 13:08:47 2015 UTC,"So, i completely understand this issue, i have had this issue until i did some playing around with the settings. Now, i also know what i am about to suggest MIGHT NOT WORK FOR EVERYONE. But here goes.     Turn controller filtering sensitivity to ZERO     turn speed sensitivity to 50     turn steering deadzone to 10, 15, or 20 (start with 10 and work your way up from there if you still notice the wheel doesnt center)     Advanced OFF     (as far as all the sensitivity settings go, turning it up or closer to 100 makes these controls LESS sensitive while setting them closer to ZERO makes them MORE SENSITIVE)     Also, Increase steering ratio, decrease spring rate, decrease tire pressure, decrease bound and rebound and dampening, decrease sway bars, and increase ride height.     It worked for me, and hopefully it works for others. But i do understand it might not work for everyone..."
pcars,37dwdh,hyperbolicants,1 point,Wed May 27 20:32:51 2015 UTC,"You do not 'completely understand this issue.'  Controller settings help when you have control over a car, even if the settings are not explained and cumbersome. What you can't do is correct a car that steps out; you can't do this because there is a delay in the steering  (a delay of over one second) that means you have no control when you need it.   Your solution to the problem that you 'completely understand' is useless, as it will not help people who can control a sim racing game.  You don't even say what mode you use, and that is proof absolute that you have no idea what you are talking about. (they are all different even with the same settings)  Assetto Corsa and iRacing do not have this controller delay, and I suggest people (especially ex Forza kids) play these games before they open their foolish mouths."

pcars,37ecke,TheCrudMan,1 point,Fri May 29 17:29:09 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry, but on most PCs when a game is running you can expect the CPU and GPU usage to go up to 100%, I don't get what the big deal is about all of the PS4s capabilities being used. I mean, does this mean that other games somehow don't push it to its limit then?"
pcars,37ecke,razor5cl,-7,Wed May 27 10:47:48 2015 UTC,"Try reading the article before commenting in future.   Bell also followed up on his recent statements on the Wii U version which is currently struggling to reach 30 fps at 720p. Bell revealed that they are not allowed to release a game that is running below 30FPS, but finding that extra 25% frame time is currently looking impossible. To give an example, Bell stated that the new tyre model alone is using two cores on the PS4 and Xbox One and the Wii U version only has 2 cores available from the start up.  Regarding the PS4 version, Bell revealed that they are pushing every core of the PS4 to 99%+ under heavy load along with GPU at 95%. Regardless, they will try and keep optimizing the PS4 version."
pcars,37ecke,aresev6,1 point,Wed May 27 11:08:33 2015 UTC,This might be a pleb question but does optimizing mean it will use more of the CPU/GPU or less?
pcars,37ecke,wpo_,1 point,Wed May 27 12:05:45 2015 UTC,Either make is use a little less resources or make the game better and use the same. More likely the later
pcars,37ecke,PhxkinMassacre,1 point,Wed May 27 12:51:19 2015 UTC,Optimising means making something more efficient and making the most of what you have. If they cut down on the resources needed to do what is included in the game now they would have more capacity to include more features or improve the graphics on the current hardware. So it pretty much means that you use less of the gpu/ cpu but the extra capacity is ofen reused for improvements.
pcars,37ecke,aresev6,1 point,Wed May 27 12:53:30 2015 UTC,"Hmm okay so it is erroneous to think that running this game at the capacity it is currently at will damage my hardware? I have been playing a fair amount on PS4 recently and worried I might brick my system, I know that console hardware is much more finnicky than PC hardware and don't want to have to end up sending my system in for repairs."
pcars,37ecke,wpo_,1 point,Wed May 27 13:45:15 2015 UTC,"No, it will be fine as long as your ambient temp is low and you have sufficient airflow. They wouldn't allow any game to be a console killer."

pcars,37ecke,wpo_,-4,Wed May 27 18:03:57 2015 UTC,"Just another broken promise from a Kickstarter campaign that was to be ""a true sim"".  It's total BS too.  I'm playing it on a PC with only a Radeon 6950 as my 770 has been away getting repaired at Gigabyte, and I don't even have things turned down that heavily, more like medium settings.  I have a Wii U, and it's certainly not up to the power of The XBONE or PS4, but it's definitely more powerful or comparable to my 6950.  They probably have realized it won't sell that many units on Wii U, and are just trying to get out of releasing it.  If you've been to the Wii U subreddit, you'll know that it's been talked about a lot.  A ton of Wii U owners are PC owners, and then to a lesser extent they own one of the Sony/MS consoles and the Wii U.  They know that people are going to get it on the PC or a top tier console, so they are abandoning Wii U.  This is my opinion, down vote accordingly."
pcars,37ecke,Tex-Rob,3,Wed May 27 14:48:54 2015 UTC,"The Wii U's GPU is based on the R700 architecture i.e. Radeon HD4000 series so it's not really comparable to a 6950 at all.  Project CARS was also not on Kickstarter. Crowdfunded, yes, but not through Kickstarter. And my understanding is that the Wii U version was announced AFTER funding closed, it was never a promise of the crowd funding campaign."

pcars,37ecke,Blubbey,-1,Wed May 27 15:53:54 2015 UTC,"I don't have a Wii u, but I'll be disappointed if it doesn't happen. It has the controller that would be perfect for this type of game. The touchscreen would have so many uses that would be welcome on the other controllers."
pcars,37ecke,ShadowFlightBA,-1,Wed May 27 00:39:41 2015 UTC,"OK.... I do believe that perhaps PCars could be pushing the PS4 CPU to 99%, though I seriously doubt that. But for sure this game never ever pushes the PS4 GPU to 95% at all. This game looks crap on the PS4 compared to games like DriveClub and NFS Rivals. I'm purely talking about the graphically side of the game. When those games are not pushing the GPU to it's edge, then for sure PCars isn't.  If it truly pushes the PS4 that far, then it simply wouldn't run on the Xbox at all, so we know this is a lot of bull for sure. They're just trying to make up excuses not to release the Wii U version. If this were to be true, then the coding is one big mess.  I've got a PS4 and PCars for sure didn't stress it as much as some of the other games I play. The fans did not even kick into overdrive at all when playing it and that says enough. With other games that are truly stressing out the PS4, the fan kicks in pretty soon. With PCars it never does.  If there is one thing that PCars does not do, it is demand much of a graphic card. Graphically this game is very mediocre, it does not need much to run on, when going by todays standards. They sure need to do a lot of optimizing the sloppy code."

pcars,37ejts,mav3r1ck92691,2,Wed May 27 11:49:36 2015 UTC,"DISCLAIMER: At work, post may be scatterbrained and totally off point, read at your own risk...  That is part of real racing and sim racing.  You don't have to set up a car to get around a track, but if you want to be fast you absolutely need to.    Keep in mind when setting up a car that a huge part of it is how the car feels to YOU.  I did an iRacing 12 hour race with my team, and the biggest challenge was tuning the car so that we all were able to drive it.    Myself and another of our faster drivers swapped setups just to see how far off we were, and neither of us could set a fast lap, but when going back to our own we were quick again.    This is the reason that many of us don't like seeing people ask to download setups from others, because 1) it won't teach you to set up a car, and 2) it may be of no use to you anyways.  The key to setting up a car is understanding what the adjustments do, making one small tweak at a time and running 5-10 laps before deciding if it is good, and patience... lots of patience.  They really can't just say ""these temps and pressures are good for everyone.""  I do think they could give us maximums though."
pcars,37ejts,schtick01101,1 point,Wed May 27 15:56:22 2015 UTC,I will usually agree with this but if the tire is properly modeled they have an optimal range that they operate at (have the most grip). This is a post for Assetto corsa but I believe the recommended pressure are close to real life and/or should apply to pcars.  http://www.reddit.com/r/assettocorsa/comments/22y1ll/tire_wear_tire_temp_question/

That's just got to be a joke right? That water effect is laughable,totally not worth even .001 fops for that shit effect. Looks like they got their mom to do it :-/  Disabled the vignette and craptastic Rays as they too are ducking terribly implemented. A good example of lens flair and crep Rays is nurb on Forza 5 ...

pcars,37b6l7,Danlance,1 point,Tue May 26 18:40:11 2015 UTC,Yeah that's force feedback. The second line on the bottom is weird though. I only had it show up once and it made the FFB feel totally different but after posting a bit on the official forums no one could tell me what it meant or why it sometimes shows up and other times doesn't.  If anyone hasn't done it you should be using that graph to make sure your wheel isn't clipping.
pcars,37b6l7,shadowofashadow,1 point,Tue May 26 22:03:15 2015 UTC,Yep I had my vibration turned off on my controller and after turning it on just now it looks like the two lines correspond to the left/right rumble.

pcars,37b6l7,Coninpotomac,1 point,Tue May 26 13:45:10 2015 UTC,It's FFB. It helps you find out if you're clipping or not.

pcars,37cs36,CannedEther,3,Wed May 27 02:38:23 2015 UTC,Some other classes do use the start line before Eau Rouge instead of before the hairpin turn. GT races use the starting line after the hairpin (where it's currently at in Pcars).  I'd rather it stay where it is. That hairpin in online racing is probably one of the worst turn1s you could have.
pcars,37cs36,G2Wolf,1 point,Wed May 27 16:37:11 2015 UTC,"You think La Source would be worse online than Eau Rouge? I dont know about that. iRacing is using the GP pits config (before the hairpin/La Source) for the Blancpain Sprint Series this week, and the hairpin is fine. Sure, its a bit stressful, but its OK. Eau Rouge/Radillion on the other hand is just a wreck fest and lap 1."
pcars,37cs36,InZomnia365,2,Thu May 28 00:34:23 2015 UTC,This isn't iracing.
pcars,37cs36,G2Wolf,1 point,Thu May 28 01:06:12 2015 UTC,"Point being? La Source is a wide, low speed hairpin. If you mess it up and hit someone, worst case scenario they spin and block the road for some seconds. If you mess up Eau Rouge on lap 1, best case scenario is you wreck yourself, worst case scenario you wipe half the field."
pcars,37cs36,InZomnia365,1 point,Thu May 28 03:42:12 2015 UTC,"People drive differently in iracing than any other game. In games that have had both starting positions, the one before Eau Rouge has always been preferred because too many people online try to win the race in turn1 of the hairpin and take out half the field right there.  Messing up Eau Rouge from that start line isn't the end of the world, cars aren't going full speed like they would be on any other lap, and there's plenty of runoff at the top of the hill for when someone inevitably spins out there (which happens regardless of where the start is). You still have to deal with Eau Rouge on lap1 with either start and cars are going to be close together through it either way."
pcars,37cs36,G2Wolf,1 point,Thu May 28 17:49:22 2015 UTC,"Filtering through La Source successfully does stretch out the field and give you enough space to go through Eau Rouge in an orderly fashion, though, Ive still been wiped out by overzealous people regardless (most recently last night when the guy in front of me completely messed up and went wide up the hill, only to come back down on me to avoid the ""cut track/slowdown"" penalty at the inside of Radillion that iRacing has. We ended up wrecking 5 other cars and causing a major pileup).  Its obviously a difficult start of the race regardless of start position, Eau Rouge is just more dangerous in my experience in both iRacing and Assetto Corsa online. You just skid straight across the road upwards into Radillion, wiping out everyone around you, while a La Source accident just slows people down. Both are a detriment to your chances of winning the race, Eau Rouge is just more carnage :)"

You see it in your video, the grass does nothing to them, half the time they accelerate in the grass.  It's completely unbelievable."
pcars,377o6z,EyeLuvPC,6,Mon May 25 16:38:08 2015 UTC,"Indeed. SMS need to code the AI to be aware of the player,which it doesn't atm.It also should be programmed to concede the position gained by going off track,and or be penalised.  It should also be programmed to think that the tarmac is the only route it should take thus braking and avoiding the player on the tarmac only unless it has no other route"
pcars,377o6z,Ksanti,2,Mon May 25 20:11:53 2015 UTC,"The reason they go on the grass is precisely because they're aware of the player and SMS decided it would be better to have them avoid the collision if possible than slam on the brakes because you decided to close the door too late. They're definitely too trigger happy with going off road but I don't have a problem with them fighting for positions they've earnt and making people have the awareness to give them room, and good sense to drive safely rather than expecting to be able to kamikaze all single player races."
pcars,377o6z,IceMan_PJN,7,Tue May 26 08:21:17 2015 UTC,"If they're up along side you at all, you should leave a cars width, otherwise they can't go anywhere but into you.   I've had incidences in Forza where I thought the other guy was an ass but then studied the replay and accepted blame.  However, I drive in cockpit view, which limits my awareness to in front of me.  I can't turn my head.  Technically Forza has options to look around via stick or Kinect head tracking, but my hands are too busy to glance with a stick and the head tracking wasn't registering movements well enough (kept looking to one side and calibration failed to resolve this.) I have no spotter, either.  Both games, and indeed all racing games, need to borrow a system like I saw in one of the F1 games and have a HUD indicator showing where nearby cars are."
pcars,377o6z,EyeLuvPC,6,Mon May 25 16:57:55 2015 UTC,"This this this.  I have the same thing, racing in driver's view limits your awareness greatly, especially when in the GT3 cars you can't see the door mirrors and can only see the rear view.  It's easy to see where you should of left more space or left way too much space in the replay modes."
pcars,377o6z,SageBlue085,1 point,Mon May 25 17:11:34 2015 UTC,"There are key binds to allow you to look left and right, you can also use the virtual mirror which is part of the HUD UI key binds."

The inside of the helmet is visible by default, there is the option to remove that so everything is clear :) The arrows indicating someone beside you like in GT6 are good."
pcars,377o6z,lookoutblorgons,3,Tue May 26 08:27:04 2015 UTC,"I'm just theorizing here, and don't want to blindly defend the AI since I didn't code the game, don't have enough experience and I can't tell for sure if this is what they intended to do.  But do you think the AI might make more mistakes the lower the difficulty is?   Also, would you personally expect the AI to be perfect on 100% difficulty? I personally wouldn't, however I would expect quite a lot less ""random mistakes"" from the AI, IF in fact ""random mistakes"" are programmed in.   A couple of the issues in that video are perfectly valid as the AI just being an idiot, others seem like racing accidents, others seem like poor awareness by the driver, which is hard to really fault since the blind spots are hard to watch in anything except for the Chase cam...  I like to theorize that some of these are just because the AI might be programmed to make mistakes every once in a while, like a real driver might, however I have no proof, but as a Software Dev, that's one way I would consider adding realism. Whether or not it's overdone is another matter entirely."
pcars,377o6z,NitroXIII,9,Mon May 25 19:24:46 2015 UTC,"The AI actually become more aggressive the higher the difficulty is set, so at 100% their pace is faster and they are also much much more aggressive in trying to gain/defend positions.  The reason these crashes happen is because the AI is reckless. In reality it is mainly the responsibility of the following driver to make a clean overtake whereas the AI just dives up the inside with no regard for safety. It leaves you no option but to either jump out of the way or get wrecked."
pcars,377o6z,ecnahc515,3,Mon May 25 19:49:27 2015 UTC,"The AI just dives up the inside with no regard for safety.   I kinda get this I think. I was playing with 80% difficulty in the Clio cup, and I think I did notice the AI trying some ill-advised passes on the inside. Most of them didn't result in anything bad, maybe a bit of rubbing, but I think I get where you are coming from, and could see that being a problem with open wheel cars and quicker cars that are easier to upset with a little rubbing.  I think a lot of the issues could be fixed with the Blind spot indicator Gran Turismo 6 has."

pcars,377o6z,lookoutblorgons,28,Tue May 26 04:08:33 2015 UTC,"Some were caused by reckless AI but the majority are your fault. You can't close the inside line and expect the AI to disappear. You can't let the inside open and expect the AI not to overtake. The corner cutting was often to avoid a crash because you don't give them any space.   Treat them like real drivers and not like bots drving in circles and you will have a much better experience, forcing an overtake will never work in a sim. If someone is behind you don't brake early and drive a defensive line instead of letting them pass and then crashing into them."
pcars,377o6z,Ksanti,6,Mon May 25 15:56:42 2015 UTC,"I agree that a lot of the incidents in the clip were a result of not leaving space, but you have to mollycoddle the AI far more than a ""real driver"" to avoid incidents.   I've been racing online for a few years in iRacing/league racing and racing the AI is nothing like racing actual people. With the AI, defensive driving is more about avoiding them taking you out rather than defending position normally. You can't claim the apex and squeeze the AI into backing off like you can a real driver because the AI will NEVER concede position in any circumstances, they will either crash into you or cut the corner rather than accept there isn't room for an overtake."
pcars,377o6z,LacSlyer,2,Mon May 25 18:27:02 2015 UTC,iracing is different as the safety rating system and whole setup of the game makes people terrified to fight for positions. While it results in cleaner racing in general it also gives a false sense of how defensive you need to be to get people to back out of moves.  It's definitely not quite like driving against actual people but it's a huge improvement over AI in other games that will slam on the brakes if you so much as look at them funny. My only concern is they're also quite slow relative to other games' AI.
pcars,377o6z,Tex-Rob,11,Tue May 26 08:24:07 2015 UTC,"Telling people to learn to drive against the AI (which basically translates to learn to avoid them at all costs) is not the problem. There's numerous proof of the AI behaving erratically yet people still tell us that we need to learn to drive against them. How about the AI not treat the player as though they don't exist? How about the AI not be allowed to be so aggressive that they care more about passing than they do about maintaining their car? How about they make it so they AI doesn't have physics advantages that allow them to get away with being so reckless?  I don't doubt that you can easily enjoy this game more if you adapt your driving style to be more passive around the AI, but that shouldn't be something we have to do in order to enjoy racing the AI. The AI simply should not be as erratic as it is at times, and it has nothing to do with driver skill."
pcars,377o6z,EyeLuvPC,28,Mon May 25 18:05:26 2015 UTC,"The fact that this is the top comment shows that the majority of people playing Project Cars know nothing about real racing.  Go pull any of those moves in iRacing and wait for your suspension.  It is the responsibility of the person passing to make a clean pass in real racing.  You can't jump into a closing gap and then tell the guy that he should have opened it up more.  If the car wasn't even along side him at corner entry, he can't shove him there and then say ""OMG the player hit me!"""
pcars,377o6z,LacSlyer,4,Mon May 25 18:21:47 2015 UTC,"Partly true. In Iracing it is also the responsibility of the defender to not drive back onto the race line/hit the apex line once it has been challenged(even iracings tutorials teach you this), but this excludes dive bombing as seen here in the video many times. Dive bombing is always the responsibility of the attacker to make sure its safe to do so , OP cannot ignore threats by leaving gaps for attacks/divebombs to happen as you said yourself.  Regarding this video, most of the carelessness shown by AI not only in Pcars but in AC too is due to the AI not being coded enough to facilitate the space that a player car is taking up, which results in aggressive and erratic behavior. Nothing we can do but adapt and defend until SMS add more code to the AI."
pcars,377o6z,EyeLuvPC,0,Mon May 25 19:43:07 2015 UTC,"Exactly. I've seen this AI do some remarkable thing, and then turn around and do some remarkably stupid things. It's got some great work done to it, but lacks some sort of awareness of the player, and at times of even other AI. It's overly aggressive at times when it shouldn't be, as though they didn't bother to write in any sort of coding that makes the AI concerned about actually staying in the race. They'll do completely irrational things that even the worst drivers wouldn't attempt because it'll knock them out of the race."
pcars,377o6z,LacSlyer,3,Mon May 25 19:50:24 2015 UTC,"but lacks some sort of awareness of the player   That is the real reason AI in Grid 2 Grid:AutoSport, ACorsa, Shift, Shift 2 & pCars, is ramming/barging being erratic.   Sad thing is, only one of these games i listed ever had the AI worked on to cure that (so far), I hope pCars adds to the list"
pcars,377o6z,Tex-Rob,3,Mon May 25 20:00:04 2015 UTC,It's disappointing because the AI can indeed have some amazing moments in this game. But as you turn up the difficulty of it you can see where the problems lie as it becomes more aggressive and less concerned about anything other than passing.
pcars,377o6z,Harshmallows,0,Mon May 25 20:15:34 2015 UTC,"The problem is that in PCars, if you race a defensive line they will just ram you in my experience, at 100% AI.  If you leave a gap, at least you can try and avoid them.  I was doing a 60min endurance, at 100%, and lapped second place in the LMP1 class, and then some dude I was lapping decided to push me off the track as I was passing him for the 3rd time, in a GT3 class car.

I think that saying the majority are my fault is bit extreme.  How am I letting them pass and then crashing into them? In most of these clips I am still ahead on track on the racing line, not deliberately crashing into them...  However I do not have this issue at all when playing in the multiplayer against people. The AI is alright I have had good bits of racing with it, but I think it's a bit too aggressive."
pcars,377o6z,fli096,5,Tue May 26 14:54:49 2015 UTC,"I'll try to breakdown each incident.  In the first one you drive racing line and the AI has space to overtake on the inside, you then shut the door and force him to cut the corner. If you don't see him it's your fault, although the AI must not cut here.   In the second one the AI fucks up. He's faster than you but has no space and would probably spin out in the next left corner so he needs to brake down. I think he tried to get on the outside for the next corner, but he's to blame.   Third one and the AI has once again no space. You're on the inside curb but he's faster than you. Don't know who's to blame since you didn't show the buildup.  In the next one you don't give him any space and to avoid a crash he needs to cut. He's already next to you and the corner doesn't belong to either of you. Probably more a racing accident than your fault.   You leave space at the corner entry, he starts the overtake but you continue to drive racing line and hit the inside curb. He has nowhere else to go but off the track. He avoids a crash by cutting. You're not aware of him and he has space to attempt an overtake, again more racing accident than your fault but definitely not his fault.  Sixth one is not your fault. He crashes into you without any reasonable possibilty to overtake.   In the next one you are on racing line and leave the inside open. AI is faster and has every right to overtake you.   Same applies to the next incident.  This one is tricky. You overtake him but you're willing to drive a slower line. He can accelerate sooner and regains his position. Probably another racing accident.   AI cuts the corner not to avoid a crash but to gain an advantage. Clearly the fault of the AI.  No idea what's going on here. Looks like he's cutting but without knowing why he's there in the first place I can't judge the situation. Right now it's the fault of the AI.  Bad defensive driving by you, the AI has space to attempt an overtake but you, once again, close the inside and force him to cut.  He has space to overtake you, is already next to you but gets pushed into the gras. Clearly your fault.   AI cuts the corner without any reasonable excuse. You steer early but he shouldn't care. He brakes to late because he wants to stay ahead of you but can't take the corner because he's too fast. Clearly his fault.  In the last one you brake very early. He's much faster than you but not too fast for the chicane. Miscommunication or racing accident caused by your slower racing line."
pcars,377o6z,EyeLuvPC,6,Mon May 25 16:09:44 2015 UTC,How do we fix most of these?  The AI can brake much later than the player because physics are not equal.  We are just doomed to be rammed forever because they can brake later than we can?
pcars,377o6z,GaugeFOREVER,-1,Mon May 25 16:41:02 2015 UTC,"I'm driving at 100% AI and I can outpace them in most corners. I don't even tune my car anymore except for gearbox adjusting. In my experience they don't brake later at all, they brake too soon or accelerate really late.   You can fix these things by improving yourself. By learning the theory of fast racing and why certain lines are faster than others. If you defend a position you need to force the AI to take a worse line by adjusting your own. Racing is much more than driving fast and you need to learn these things to be a good driver.   The physics are equal in dry conditions and on the track. The AI doesn't seem to be affected by rain and offroad/dirt/gras."
pcars,377o6z,iracer46,1 point,Mon May 25 16:51:02 2015 UTC,"Not totally true. I have adapted my driving skill and in many cases I out brake the AI. Remember that 100(Ace) skill which I bet is what most of these AI videos are being raced on the AI are braking at the very last millisecond and throttling on the exact point they need to (mimicking pro level drivers)  If your being attacked on every corner either adapt your race craft opr lower the AI level (There is no shame in lowering it until you get better- this is the fundamental problem with most rookies)  EDIT: Setups are a great way to get faster especially if your a wheel user, although once you get better you can out race the AI on default setups as there are many corners the AI go unnecessarily slow which you can learn soon enough how to over take them (turn 1 Snetterton for example)"

pcars,377o6z,Halmine,4,Mon May 25 20:23:56 2015 UTC,"The first one is not my fault at all he started cutting the corner before I'd even turned in. I also question you're placement of blame for me for some of the other incidents.  I know I'm not an amazing racer and few of these are my fault, they were left in for the entertainment of the video.  I appreciate you pointing out what happened in each clip, but I can see it clearly as well my self from the replay view, but when racing in the drivers view it is hard to know where the AI are and I'm following the racing line and they dive bomb me up the inside there isn't much I can do before it's too late.  In my opinion the AI are really good in some areas but pretty awful in others. I like that they are aggressive, it makes for more interesting racing, but I simply am not used to it at all and I think they are too aggressive I don't getting these sorts of incidents in the online races as I have said before. Also the fact that their wet pace just drops of 1 second from their dry pace is ridiculous! Competing against them in changing conditions when transitions from dry to wet is awful, they don't seem to struggle with changes temps and overall grip for the tyres at all."
pcars,377o6z,LacSlyer,-1,Mon May 25 20:47:16 2015 UTC,I would recommend upping your FoV to the point where you see the left hand side door mirror. That way you have a closer to real life experience and can actually estimate their position better.
pcars,377o6z,Halmine,2,Mon May 25 17:08:15 2015 UTC,"lol, now I've seen it all, yeah, OP, set your FOV to like 100 for that REAL experience, makes it all so fast too!  Tunnel vision for the reality win!"

You could play at 4k or 720p and the FOV would need to be the same because it's based on your monitor size and the distance your eyes are from the monitor.

pcars,377o6z,MethodM4n,2,Mon May 25 16:42:25 2015 UTC,Glad you made a video about this because I was considering doing one after experiencing AI cars constantly corning cutting then ramming into me.

pcars,377o6z,bizology,4,Mon May 25 19:16:32 2015 UTC,"According to FIA rules, if an overtaking car has so much as their front splitter alongside your rear tire at the point of turn-in, you must leave space for their car. More than half of these collisions are caused by you attempting to drive all the way to the apex when that space is legally occupied by another vehicle. Whether or not you notice does not remove fault.  Yes, it is also the duty of an overtaking car to make a clean pass, and some of these clips show the AI fully leaving the track to try avoid you as you run them off the road. There isn't really an excuse for the few clips where they fully cut sections of track.  I have had a vastly different experience racing the AI at 100%. Yes, they constantly look for an opportunity to pass, however, aggressive is the last thing I'd call them. When there is a light collision, every single AI will immediately adjust it's line and swerve away from me. When there is a hard collision, it is usually my fault for doing something unpredictable, such as braking early and cutting across track.  The point of all this, is that Project Cars, and every other racing game, desperately need Proximity Arrows as an option. To the ""That's not realistic!"" crowd, that would be far more realistic than racing at the top levels of the sport with no spotter, while wearing equestrian blinders (effectively what racing with a tv looks like)."
pcars,377o6z,WHATTUPDOOSH,5,Mon May 25 20:45:41 2015 UTC,How about Corvette Racing's rear view camera technology. Has the proximity arrows and doesn't reduce the realism factor.
pcars,377o6z,TheJewbacca,3,Tue May 26 01:33:53 2015 UTC,"From youtube videos I've seen, doesn't iRacing have something where a spotter says someone's to your left or to your right?  Even a system like that would be great!  Although I have no problem with a blind spot indicator.  True, it may not be realistic, but so are a ton of other things in the game.  Hell, the fact that it's a game makes it unrealistic.  Any overlay on the screen is not realistic (track map, position, timing, etc), but they can all be turned off if you want realism.  I think a blind spot indicator should be in the game, and if someone wants as close to realistic as they can, well, simple, turn it off.  It really does no harm by being there but being able to be turned off."

pcars,37a2ca,_brendan_,2,Tue May 26 02:24:56 2015 UTC,Unfortunately you can't tell until you're actually inside the car. Would love it if they added this feature though.
pcars,37a2ca,DankBCGds,4,Tue May 26 05:20:11 2015 UTC,Does it matter? I'm using a G25 on PC and I switch between the H pattern and paddles seamlessly. I'm primarily using the paddles actually and I'm pretty sure the e30 didn't come with them.
pcars,37a2ca,SyrousStarr,4,Tue May 26 03:36:55 2015 UTC,"Do you use the clutch with the paddles? It's not so 'seamless' for me because I have to switch the auto-clutch on and off, and I've found no better way to test (with sequential) than by trying to let it stall. Not great during a race.  On a related note, is there a way to find out whether a specific car/series uses TCS and ABS? I'd like to keep my use of assists realistic. Google isn't particularly helpful."
pcars,37a2ca,avoiceoftreason,6,Tue May 26 07:47:16 2015 UTC,"I'm not near my computer to check in the game currently, but I believe there is a ""Real Assists"" option that automatically turns on/off individual assists for each car depending on what it uses in real life."
pcars,37a2ca,TittyMcFagerson,3,Tue May 26 08:56:36 2015 UTC,Its more so because the sequential gearboxes don't work well with the h-shift (as they shouldn't). But sometimes you don't realise until you try to change down a few gears and it only changes down one gear. So you can be in second on the gear stick but the car is actually in third still because its sequential and only changes one gear at a time. Also I just prefer using the H-shift so just be good to know which cars use it.
pcars,37a2ca,Sect93,1 point,Tue May 26 03:45:34 2015 UTC,"One thing I am pretty sure can be used is this:  All the new racingcars from 2000 or later + all the supercars (etc from the McLaren F1) got paddleshift. Meanwhile all the non-supercars and the older racingcars + the McLaren F1 has a manual stick shift gear.  Correct me if i am wrong, but I am fairly certain this is true 9 out of 10 times. Maybe some of the supercars uses stick shift gears, as I havent tried some of them yet."

In that case, the starting position of your second race goes by your second best lap time in qualifying.   On the drivers screen, the screen that pops up when you start a session and you have to push drive to begin, there's an option about halfway down that says ""View Race Format & Regulations"".  Select it and it'll give you details of the series."
pcars,3794z5,LacSlyer,1 point,Tue May 26 02:22:17 2015 UTC,ok ill have to take a look at that
pcars,3794z5,sasstomouth,1 point,Tue May 26 10:01:48 2015 UTC,I've had something like this only once. I won the race and got the points but the result put the second place AI (career mode) in first. Didn't effect the championship though so I lucked out.
pcars,3794z5,Winnerbimmer,0,Tue May 26 02:35:59 2015 UTC,"You're probably confusing these races with the qualifying races. In qualifying, you set your best lap time, and if you finish before everyone else, other A.I. will still be putting in their lap time, which will bump you down positions."
pcars,377n8b,Thomabsolutely,10,Mon May 25 15:29:19 2015 UTC,"I love the rolling starts where the number 2 position starts faster than you do in number 1, so they immediately pass you.  You have ZERO control over this.  This means that starting in position two is actually the best position."

pcars,377n8b,IceMan_PJN,3,Mon May 25 16:49:59 2015 UTC,"I've seen a car be in front of me and out of position, and that's how the race starts. There's a few weird issues here and there."
pcars,377n8b,Cybershrike,2,Mon May 25 18:16:40 2015 UTC,"It's also bugged. Sometimes after i pause and unpause just after the race loads up, I'm not restricted by the countdown so while the rest of the field are waiting for the green, I'm already ahead by like 6 seconds with no penalty."
pcars,377n8b,J03130,2,Tue May 26 14:16:06 2015 UTC,"Monaco isn't a place to drive with the AI on, it's too crowded and the walls make the AI do weird stuff. Generally I've found the AI to be completely fine, it just takes a while to get used to AI that will typically fight for position rather than slam on the brakes if you look at them funny which takes the fun out of so many other games."
pcars,377n8b,Ksanti,2,Mon May 25 19:39:38 2015 UTC,"The AI is indeed terrible. I would even prefer the way they did it in forza 5 with the AI consisting of real life player driving behaviour... Yeah, they crashed into me a lot, but at least they didn't behave without logic.  The two things i hate the most:    How the AI will hit brakes and ""trap"" you behind them when you slightly make contact with them from behind. How the AI seems to be oblivious about my existence until i am almost next to them. Once they notice you, they make a nervous move away from you to give you room, sometimes ending up on the grass.   AI is simply a joke. Still an enjoyable game, but frustrating because of the AI.  PS: Also hate how they manage to cause traffic jams..! It's really broken... :D"
pcars,377n8b,Tanglible_Dream,2,Tue May 26 17:14:34 2015 UTC,Midway through season 2 in career and a few things I see regularly  1) AI racing prefectly on slicks in the rain (app the devs are taking a look at this one per the pcars official forum).  2) I stick to AI bumpers when they slow down too much into turns. This usually means both of us continue forward off the track 3) AI recover way too easily when going off track. 4) Very aggressive AI drivers on the first lap of qualifying. This shows the AI are not affected by cold tires 5) No team driving. Had an AI car on my own race team spin me out with a PIT manuever on the last turn of a race we were 1st and 2nd in.  I just give up on a few things on Career mode and take the last place loss. Races that rain mid-way. You can start with rain tires and try to make up the 5 seconds but it's doubtful. Starting from 10 place and back. Usually can't make it past the first turn after playing bumper cars with the AI  I'd say 50% of races end well. The other 50% require 3-4 restarts before I get a clean one in.

Another 'minor' thing (or major, it really does make quite a difference) is when you qualify on pole in a class with rolling starts. Doesn't happen on every track, but I found - specifically at Donington - you start on the right hand side, i.e. the inside line for the first corner. However, on rolling starts there the lights go green while you're half way around the final corner, so the AI driver starting second immediately takes the lead and there's nothing you can do about it."

The ability to view multiplayer replays from a different car perspective than your own and the name of each person who drove it.

I'd never played anything with Monaco before this so it was an eye opening experience.  It's a fun track, though.      I have to say, though, that while I normally like to run with real damage, I'm glad I turned it off after some woes at Hockenheim at formula B.  I couldn't seem to make it through an entire race at Azure without ending up in the walls at some point.  I spun out quite a bit at the turn you did at the end there...as well as the turn before it.  I'm not sure how you held 4th going through there.  I almost always had to brake to 3rd to avoid losing the tail."
pcars,375mzn,jerrypk,1 point,Wed May 27 14:30:42 2015 UTC,"Monaco is a favorite of mine and this games representation is one of the best (even if its not called Monaco). It's a track that demands respect and likewise, you have to drive it respectfully; gentle on the throttle, gently through the gears, smooth on the wheel, but hard on the brakes initially, and a very gentle gradual lift as you approach the corner. The fastest way around Monaco is the quietest. If you want some great insight to this track and how to drive it watch ""Weekend of a Champion,"" it's a documentary about the 1976 (I believe) Monaco Grand Prix shown from the perspective Jackie Stewart"
pcars,375mzn,CannedEther,1 point,Wed May 27 23:37:55 2015 UTC,"Yea, Monaco deserves all the respect that formula 1 gives it. It gets a lot of hate from people because it makes for ""boring"" racing. They're communists as far as I'm concerned! Brilliant track, there's nothing like it to drive. Like you said, easy on the throttle, careful steering, and Monaco will treat you well"

pcars,375mzn,CannedEther,1 point,Mon May 25 05:22:51 2015 UTC,"Are you supposed to activate KERS by yourself? I haven't driven cars with KERS much, but IME on the P1, it activates itself when the car is accelerating on 2nd/3rd gear.   In FB cars, I have to manually do it and it only happens at certain points, and I can't figure out when.  Also, in FA cars, isn't there only specific instances where you can use DRS? I can seem to keep it active the whole time."
pcars,375mzn,wpo_,2,Mon May 25 06:47:50 2015 UTC,The Formula B KERS is a push-to-pass button that can be used once per lap and discharges for a full 6 seconds once pressed. In the FA cars you can use DRS anywhere (no DRS zones in this game) but that can be unwise (try it through Ea Rouge). So yeah you can use KERS and DRS pretty much however you want in this game. The FA KERS is limited to 7 seconds per lap I believe but can be used any amount of time.

pcars,379u6p,shadowofashadow,2,Tue May 26 01:42:24 2015 UTC,"I actually abandoned the cash i (dumbly) payed for the pre-order cuz a quick look told me I didnt want to spend 70 bones on an unfinished project... too bad too, I bought my ps4 specifically for this game.   As far as I'm concerned, I consider this a bullet dodged."
pcars,379u6p,liquid_j,2,Tue May 26 03:03:12 2015 UTC,"Having bought CARS, rFactor 2 and Assetto Corsa, I can say that out of the 3, CARS is the only one that feels like a complete product. Yeah, it has it's flaws (some damage modelling, AI etc), but I have not experienced anything game-breaking so far. The wheel is easy to set up, creating an MP race or track day with your friends and having them join through Steam takes like 5 clicks and the career mode is at least there and works.  Compare that to Assetto Corsa, where creating a multiplayer match requires you to edit a file to set everything up and then hosting a dedicated server on your own PC, or how the career is a generic series of races, or how the AI does not even know how to pit... Well, that is beta (still very good racing sim though).  The worst out of the three is rFactor 2, when they announced 1.0 and this whole ""constant development"" state ages ago, it really felt like a scam. I would say that despite the brilliant physics, content-wise and quality-wise, they just entered beta in 2015. There are still official tracks that are bugged and you can fall through the ground in some places not to mention the quality of some content screams ""RF1 mod"".  So yeah, if you think pCARS is ""beta as fuck"", well, you know nothing Jon Snow. :)"
pcars,379u6p,mmaruda,1 point,Tue May 26 14:23:34 2015 UTC,"The game has potential.  But it's definitely still an early beta.  I guess it's better to play it with all the bugs instead of watching an early backer on Twitch, wishing we could try it out."

I bought my PS4 in January and have been waiting to get the game. Instead of buying it on day one like everybody (and a lot of my friends) did, I held off. With the way games are released these days, I just don't want to deal with the bullshit bugs anymore. This game should have been refined as fuck with how many times it was delayed.

pcars,374ta6,Lukin4,3,Sun May 24 23:36:05 2015 UTC,"I've had issues where my car gets instantaneously f***ed up when leaving the garage. Also issues with crazy AI. Some collisions are also broken, the car just glitches out and stops on the spot, no momentum...   Don't know why practice and qualifiers just end at 00:00, without letting you finish your current lap. At least qualifiers should let you do that, basically if there's 3-4 minutes left, there's no point in getting out.. unless you can complete a warmup lap AND a timed lap in that period.  And I've also had issues with karting rolling starts, sometimes it wouldn't register me passing the starting line and in a couple of seconds I'd be stuck in lap 1 on last place, even if I was 1st.  Other than that it works fine, no control problems, no graphic problems, runs smooth (PS4). I hope they sort these issues out, I love the game."

Although I play with a controller, I've played Assetto Corsa for a very long time, so I'm a little more experienced with race lines and respecting drivers (AI) around me.  I have a few issues though: The AI seems completely unaffected by grass/gravel. Some menus are glitchy while navigating with a controller. For instance, on consoles, the right stick lets you scroll through the driver list before/after a race but for me, I usually have to point my mouse over the list before my right stick is able to scroll through it."

Like Dirt Rally came out and has a few updates, and tons of communication.  It's like PCars shipped and they all went on vacation.  The latest thing I am losing my mind over is endurance races in multi class racing.  The LMP1 cars are insanely sensitive to any contact, so the engine just blows.  I've gotten insanely good at dodging other cars, but even at 100 percent AI I'll lap almost every person in MY class, and every car of the field a few times in just a 30 minute endurance race.  Even if the AI was competitive, which in some series at 100% they are for me (that is a whole other issue that the AI is better at some cars than others), the problem is they have zero idea how to drive.  You can pass one, then at the next turn they will just plow into you.  This makes it to where you have to set the AI low because if they are competitive, they will just plow you, pass on the grass, whatever.  The multiclass is actually a lot of fun, but the AI is by far the biggest problem in this game, by a factor of 10."

pcars,3746os,XGC75,1 point,Mon May 25 02:18:31 2015 UTC,It's also the lack of some things which is disappointing. Fie instance with replays it only seems to record the race following your car so you can't go back and view the race from another driver's perspective. Also it doesn't record the names of the other players in a multilayer replay. And it won't let you be each replay to help differentiate them. Things at this point I just kind of take for granted in racing titles.
pcars,3746os,ShadowFlightBA,1 point,Mon May 25 02:14:04 2015 UTC,It is not complete. Hoping for a big patch to fix the bugs and these things.   the pits are shithouse for multiple reasons nothing happens when you win or get a podium. How hard would it be to create a driver and spray some champagne on a podium after a race? crashes and roll overs are just strange if you touch the grass your car will automatically be drawn towards the barriers like a magnet  if you touch another car you are stuck together for a bit like a magnet  there is more but those fixes would be terrific

Different teams within a studio work on different things. Just because they've fixed 1 or 2 things that aren't relevant to you, doesn't mean they've ignored other bugs.  ""I never experienced that"" - in reference to a bug. Just because he hasn't, doesn't mean others aren't. He's sitting there berating Ian Bell on his customer service replies (honestly the man doesn't seem to have much customer relations training - although if you speak to any software or game developer, talking to users is always frustrating as 99% of the time they have little idea of what they're talking about in regards to demands to fixes); and then proceeds to declare ridiculousness of the patch notes and fixes because the problems he experiences aren't fixed, but others he hasn't are.

pcars,373485,Bounkass,2,Sun May 24 15:04:19 2015 UTC,"Xbone here.  I just did a few laps of Sonoma in this car to see if I had the same results you did. Short answer:  No, I did not.  I've spent many hours tuning my controller settings, but the car tuning I used for this was default.  I also have all assists off.  I think it may be related to the ""default novice"" settings you used."
pcars,373485,js2k6,1 point,Sun May 24 15:30:53 2015 UTC,"This reminds me of GT5. I used to HEX edit the save files to give the tires more grip. Too much and this would happen, lol."
pcars,373485,potatocucumber,1 point,Sun May 24 16:56:18 2015 UTC,I have my issues with the escort mk1...   but never that bad. it flips when the ai ram me of course. but i can corner quite well with it. and have actually managed to steal a couple of wins in the race with it.   but it's a horrible thing to drive.
pcars,374z9l,stnzbass,6,Sun May 24 22:43:09 2015 UTC,In my experience skipping to end of session results in the AI setting ridiculous times like lapping Spa in 1:30 in a GT3 car
pcars,374z9l,lookoutblorgons,6,Mon May 25 07:35:29 2015 UTC,No. They sometimes get better times than you.
pcars,374z9l,WHATTUPDOOSH,2,Sun May 24 22:57:15 2015 UTC,"I tried it today. I did one lap of qualification and I was the first car on the track. I hit pause as soon as I cross the finish line. Hit ""Skip to end of session"". In the time table at the end, I was the only one with a time. Maybe it's a bug with the board at the end. May be it does not update the AI times."
pcars,374z9l,banana-skeleton,4,Sun May 24 23:40:29 2015 UTC,"I've never had your problem, half the time the AI get faster times and I'm in a completely different position."
pcars,374z9l,WHATTUPDOOSH,0,Mon May 25 02:19:11 2015 UTC,Oh i dunno mabye. What about simulate
pcars,374z9l,TachiFoxy,3,Mon May 25 09:34:11 2015 UTC,"I assume it's intended because the simulated times are often ridiculous for the AI. I can do a whole practice session and when I'm at 1:00min for instance, AI would be at 1:02min throughout.  The moment I simulate the remainder of the practice, though, I would still have my 1:00min and one or multiple bots could even end up having a 0:50min. I once had that happen and I was like ""damn, how did he do that!?"".  I assume SMS know about that and, thus, they disabled that in qualifying so people won't get mad if a bot undercuts their time in a ridiculous manner."
pcars,374z9l,missiletest,2,Mon May 25 01:56:01 2015 UTC,"That's plausible, I had the same experience with AI doing incredible time the minute I simulate the end of the practice."
pcars,374z9l,chamferedmind,1 point,Mon May 25 01:59:09 2015 UTC,It doesn't simulate the rest of the race either if you hit 'continue' before all runners finish. You can be a lap down and get credit for 2nd if you time it right.
pcars,374z9l,Yayo_Mateo,1 point,Mon May 25 00:27:26 2015 UTC,Simulations are based on available data. What do you guys expect? Some random crap? Pcar's model is better than nothing.
pcars,374vjw,Mikeastuto,5,Sun May 24 22:12:24 2015 UTC,If you just want a wheel to race you will be happy with the T80.
pcars,374vjw,BORIStheBLADE1,1 point,Mon May 25 00:44:50 2015 UTC,"I mean I've literally never used a wheel. Just seems like for a game like Pcars, a wheel and pedals gives you more refined, responsive inputs you really need to move a car the way this game is designed."
pcars,374vjw,BORIStheBLADE1,3,Mon May 25 02:01:15 2015 UTC,I never owned a wheel and picked up the T80. Everyone I game with says I want force feedback but I'm not trying to make the game 100% realistic. I just want a wheel..
pcars,374vjw,BORIStheBLADE1,1 point,Mon May 25 02:45:02 2015 UTC,Do you like it? Do you feel like it makes a significant difference?
pcars,374vjw,BustinAllKindsOfNuts,3,Mon May 25 02:54:41 2015 UTC,Yeah I do like it a lot. Im still getting used to it but Im a lot smoother and have more control.   I go back and forth with the DS4 because I get lazy setting it up lol.
pcars,374vjw,JoeyDJQ,3,Mon May 25 12:39:24 2015 UTC,I recommend shelling out an extra $50 and getting the T100. Same wheel as the T80 but with force feedback which helps to let you know your grip and if you're near the edge of spinning out.
pcars,374vjw,BustinAllKindsOfNuts,5,Sun May 24 23:56:17 2015 UTC,"I've looked, cant find one currently."
pcars,374vjw,keeb119,3,Mon May 25 02:08:02 2015 UTC,Same here. My T80 just came in today. Only issue is securing the pedal board in place but once that's fixed it's way more fun.
pcars,374vjw,BustinAllKindsOfNuts,2,Mon May 25 03:08:54 2015 UTC,Cool! You guys really seem to be selling me on the T80. Ive read all about the pedal board needing to be fastened down somehow. Im sure I could rig something up. That seems like a minor issue to me. The one thing that has me concerned is some people complaining about huge dead zone issues but then it seems other people have no problems at all.  My assumption is the people complaining about the issues haven't taken the time to read/setup the wheel properly.
pcars,374vjw,wpo_,1 point,Mon May 25 03:25:01 2015 UTC,I got mine at Fry's Electronics in California.

pcars,374vjw,ChammaBrothers,2,Tue May 26 20:33:52 2015 UTC,"I bought a T80 initially and had a good amount of fun..... until Snetterton. I just couldn't do it. Spun out every lap. So I got the T100 (I picked it up in-store at Fry's Electronics, dont know if you have one around) and the difference is night and day. If you can find one and are willing to spend the extra money, then you can't go wrong with the T100. The T80 will do you just fine if you really, really, really understand what can upset the car. The T100 tells you you've upset the car."

pcars,374f87,fuzunspm,2,Mon May 25 17:06:45 2015 UTC,Really glad it helped!   Do you mind sharing what you changed? did you find a way to make it less twitchy in straight lines? That's the only thing that bothers me but at the same time i think that's just the way the game plays with a controller. Let me know!
pcars,373p0r,jamesowenjones,10,Sun May 24 16:12:51 2015 UTC,The most frustrating thing about it is that the collision physics seem heavily skewed to unbalance the player's car while having little to no effect on the AI.
pcars,373p0r,sasstomouth,3,Sun May 24 17:00:06 2015 UTC,And that ht e physics of grass and hitting things seems to have almost no effect on the AI.  I doubt the AI would take turns as fast as they do if they couldn't run in the grass without some negative.
pcars,373p0r,GaugeFOREVER,7,Mon May 25 16:44:44 2015 UTC,Not only are they not yeilding but also the ramming. God so much fucking ramming.
pcars,373p0r,KilKidd,3,Sun May 24 20:28:33 2015 UTC,What's worse is backmarkers will do it to you too.

Usually happens to me if I try to pass on the inside of a corner, the AI cut me off and  I either get pushed off the track or spun out. I imagine that would have been terrifying in real life though at such high speeds."
pcars,373p0r,xTREXEL,2,Sun May 24 23:58:47 2015 UTC,"Yea it's making me avoid going for passes altogether.  The A.I. has a major fucking death wish and routinely pulls moves that aren't even close to being in its favor.  It's honestly most annoying to me during practice sessions, especially when I'm just trying to get a feel for the track or preparing for a hot lap.    I just rage-quitted at Brands Hatch when the A.I. decided to shove itself up the inside rounding the second to last corner when I was going into a hot lap... in the wet... in the first few minutes of a practice session...  I don't program or know anything about anything about A.I. development but holy fuck if its the beginning of a practice session at least make them tend to do what's in their best interest - maintaining a gap between our two cars.  It's frustrating as fuck because there are occasional moments of brilliance in the game."
pcars,373p0r,mallenpdx,3,Mon May 25 03:49:20 2015 UTC,"Yes, everyone is having this problem because the AI is garbage"

pcars,373p0r,Thomabsolutely,1 point,Sun May 24 16:39:05 2015 UTC,"Yeah...it's a huge problem.  It's usually the worst at the start of the race.  A lap or so in, we're not so bunched up and I can pass them in places where I can mitigate the crazy driving.    I've been playing with restarts on just because of this.  Going into first turn and AI being a dick?  Quick restart."

Then again, sometimes you enter a race where it's full of people who really struggle to just drive in a straight line (probably gamepad users with default settings).   The most ridiculous race was about 10 players with the Lotus 98 on Hockenheim GP in rain. TWO players (me and another dude) managed to get past the first corner.

pcars,37163w,IceMan_PJN,1 point,Sun May 24 01:28:58 2015 UTC,The biggest issue I have with this game is that I can't figure out a way to not overcompensate when the car gets out of line using the controller.   I'm having much the same trouble.
pcars,37163w,Bounkass,1 point,Sun May 24 01:37:59 2015 UTC,"I think many people have this problem, including myself. I believe the problem lays within the speed sensitivity. I makes the analog stick input jump from say 5% to 40%. Which means you can steer very slightly to 5% and after that it immediately jumps to approximately 40%. It's annoying. Especially when most of the corners are within the 5-40% range... I have noticed you can flick  the analog stick very quick to get more precise steering but it takes too long to get your desired direction while traveling at high speeds. Plus it's simply unnecessary. If I want to turn into a corner which requires me to steer 30%, then I should beable to steer exactly 30%. With a controller or steering wheel... Simple. Not, continuously flicking the analog stick to get the right direction, going off-coirse, getting invalid lap time because it takes too long to adjust direction..."
pcars,37163w,n_u_g,2,Sun May 24 01:41:03 2015 UTC,"I used to suffer from this, however I managed to fix it in my controller settings within the game options.   Play around with the deadzone for the left analogue (mine is set at 2) and turn the sensitivity down until you can make fine adjustments (mine is set to ten).  Also, one of the biggest changes came when I set the controller filtering sensitivity to 30, so play with that.   Obviously everyone is different so your settings may differ from mine but hopefully you'll find it a bit easier.

After a lot of restarts, the weather actually changed a bit, and was able to complete it without spinning.

Sometimes letting go of the gas helps sometimes not.   If letting go of the gas doesn't work, try a touch of break and or depending, a little gas. I would really suggest slowly letting off the gas while steering, and with no gas you still can't get control slowly apply the brakes. It will fuck up a really good lap time, but at least you will not go spinning, or possibly into the grass to invalidate a lap time. I haven't been playing this specific game that long, but when I do that it almost always works.    It almost seems like thers a physics model for your car and one for the ai. It's hard to keep playing when it seems like no matter what you can't keep up because your gonna wreck.   Yeah in almost every single game, the computer can ""cheat"".

My only issue right now is that counter steering seems a little sluggish with these settings. The wheels doesn't move fast enough, or at least visually. So I'm not sure if it is or isn't.

pcars,37163w,hyperbolicants,1 point,Sun May 24 19:55:53 2015 UTC,"This is an issue that is known, and it spoils the game for me too.  There is a delay of about a second (however you set the settings on any and all of the modes) between controller input to wheel movement that means corrections are not possible beyond luck with a controller. Stop a car and look at the front wheel when you make sharp controller movements, and you will realise why you can't correct.   The backers/testers hate it, as there was a way to turn the delay off during development that has been taken out in the final release of the game. They are using other drivers to get around it when using a controller with the PC version; this solution is not available for console users.  Here is just one thread, of many, where it is discussed; note that the issue is known, but it is not a 'known issue' as it looks like the devs are in denial and we will be stuck with it:  http://forum.projectcarsgame.com/showthread.php?21992-Setting-up-a-gamepad"

pcars,36zlaw,onetruebipolarbear,9,Sat May 23 13:58:19 2015 UTC,"Oh if that were the only problem I'd be delighted!!  You have approx 2 seconds to alter your pit strategy. Even when you do manage to set it up and save it, it can decide to ignore it or worse, give you a mixture of tires, Wets left slick right for example. It will refuel your tank even if you tell it not to, sometimes will and sometimes won't repair damage.  It's certainly making longer races a challenge to compete fairly, after 10 laps of leading the nordeschleiffe, the last thing I want to see is the pit crew throw on half wet half dry tires.  I'm hopeful a big fix comes soon (pc)  Edit: oh yeah and sometimes you'll receive a penalty or warning for cutting the track on exit even within lines, or the ai will drive you into a wall."

pcars,36zlkf,butcher0,8,Sat May 23 14:00:57 2015 UTC,"Not bad! I have a few suggestions. First, you finished with 55.5 liters worth of fuel left. if you take that out, there alone you should gain some time and some sections will be flat out where before you were having to lift. Now as far as it breaking loose on exit, that wasn't the gearing or the power, it was your line. You are currently turning into about every corner way too early meaning you've got the wheel cranked on exit while applying throttle, thus wheel spin. Try staying out wider and cutting to the apex, that way you can straighten the wheel on exit. I guarantee no wheel spin in 3rd or 4th gear then and you'll also be faster. Overall great job, not an easy place!"
pcars,36zlkf,BlazerMan420,1 point,Sat May 23 19:28:45 2015 UTC,"Thanks mate! And thanks for really good feedback. I will try to improve my apexes in my next video/run. I know they were even worse in that run than I use to because I had not gotten real comfortable with the car. I have some experience with drifting, so I understand your point with too much turning while applying power. It was on purpose that I did not mess with any settings of the car, like fuel and suspension, since I wanted the lap to be 100% stock (or untouched). I am not sure about the guarantee though, since I have spun the rear tires in third while going straight forward in that car (slight uphill) :)"

Personally I am loving it, however you mention you enjoy customising and pimping cars out. There's none of that in Project Cars. You can play around with a whole load of settings to try and find the best set up for the car on each track but that's as close as you can come to customisation.  So if you care a lot about your pimping and customisation Project Cars probably isn't the best for that - I have no idea about the other games sorry."

pcars,3716e3,fleaver12,2,Sat May 23 22:40:19 2015 UTC,"I like older cars more than new ones and I like customization. I like taking more common cars and pimping them out. I have a PS4 and I am trying to decide between The Crew, Drive Club, and Project Cars.   Project CARS is the opposite of what you want.  You're looking between DriveClub and The Crew.  The Crew is entertaining enough but highly arcadey and pretty sub-par in pretty much every way.  I still spent forty or fifty hours with The Crew, but it had a mountain of room for improvement.  The one single plus to The Crew was the massive map to explore."

I have THE CREW and i gotta say, I've had a lot of fun with that. It can get boring if you don't have friends to play with but if you do, its always fun to go on makeshift road trips across the country. Plus the story wasn't half bad. Its just hard to make money for some of the more high-end cars. i also have PROJECT CARS and let me say.. At first i was underwhelmed because of the glitches and what not but after setting up my controller settings, i kind of fell in love with this game. It feels so authentic and even though you don't win anything for races, you somehow feel more rewarded when you take first place. Earlier today i purchased the $99 dollar wheel for xbox one for this game and i can honestly say i have never had this much fun with a racing game. There are some asshats online who run you off the road but for the most part, online has a nice atmosphere that gives off a sense of professionalism whenever theres multiple people in practice trying to set the fastest lap in order to be first on the starting line. If i was asked to pick only ONE of these THREE games, id easily go with PROJECT CARS. My second choice would be THE CREW. Hope i helped you make your decision.

pcars,3704ph,notaspookorgook,1 point,Sun May 24 02:58:35 2015 UTC,Yep just bought it. Works well. The rod gets in the way unless I hike up the steering wheel platform. I'll probably end up sawing a chunk of it off so I can keep the position without having it in between brake and gas.  IMO the bar gets in the way.

pcars,36w32e,TheCrudMan,2,Fri May 22 17:21:27 2015 UTC,Xbox controller no button assigned to clutch from what i know.
pcars,36w32e,hindey19,5,Fri May 22 18:13:03 2015 UTC,You can reassign the buttons.  I changed my clutch to the circle button on PS4.
pcars,36w32e,Famine07,2,Fri May 22 18:14:16 2015 UTC,"That said, there are a lot of buttons not in use on the xbox controller. I will assign the clutch."
pcars,36w32e,LacSlyer,4,Fri May 22 18:20:57 2015 UTC,"If its anything like forza assign clutch to the A button, downshift to X, and upshift to B.  Mash x+a or b+a together to shift w/ clutch much faster"
pcars,36w32e,Famine07,3,Fri May 22 18:32:08 2015 UTC,"I have no experience using a clutch, or a manual transmission for that matter, with a controller. But wouldn't it be better to use the right bumper for clutch? If you're using the triggers for the brake and accelerator, then the right bumper as the clutch would be more ideal because you'll not use the right trigger when using it anyways (outside of doing heel/toe to rev match - which I can't imagine you'd try with a controller)."
pcars,36w32e,G2Wolf,4,Fri May 22 19:32:51 2015 UTC,"If you're shifting with X and B then your thumb only needs to move between the A button and X or B, then press them at the same time.  If clutch is RB then you have to worry about working the throttle and clutch at the same time then shifting with your thumb, which can easily press two buttons at once.  Forza has the clutch as LB and most of the people I raced with that used clutch swapped it to the A button."
pcars,36w32e,Famine07,-5,Fri May 22 20:48:41 2015 UTC,What is with you guys acting like you can't use a trigger and a bumper at the same time? I have shifting on the bumpers and have no problems with hitting them while using accel/brake. It's not that hard.
pcars,36w32e,ScotchBender,5,Fri May 22 23:13:45 2015 UTC,"I have my preference and you have yours, I know a guy that used the face buttons for gas and brake, nothing wrong with doing what you feel is comfortable."

pcars,36w32e,SpxUmadBroYolo,3,Sat May 23 06:36:06 2015 UTC,I highly doubt you can shift as fast with the left bumper as you can using A. It's as fast as hitting a single button with zero possibility for a timing mistake.

On track or autocross you'll end up hitting it a bit on certain elements where upshifting would be counter productive.  I'd say every other autocross course I've run has you on the limiter for at least a few seconds at a time."
pcars,36w32e,theamunraaa,1 point,Fri May 22 21:02:25 2015 UTC,At least a few seconds isn't like the few minutes you're on it on california highway.
pcars,36w32e,TheCrudMan,1 point,Fri May 22 21:10:52 2015 UTC,Few minutes would be fine if the cooling and lubrication systems are up to task.
pcars,36w32e,LPGTR,1 point,Fri May 22 22:01:57 2015 UTC,We're talking here about high powered racing machine that is designed to run as hot as it can without blowing up just to minimise the aerodynamic drag that a radiator opening produces. Your ordinary car will be able to redline for a long time but this GT3 racer will not.
pcars,36w32e,TheCrudMan,0,Fri May 22 22:19:05 2015 UTC,"No, it won't.  As long as the cooling system and lubrication are working correctly it will be fine.  You shouldn't be hitting redline while shifting.  You mean before shifting?"
pcars,36w32e,LPGTR,1 point,Fri May 22 19:26:51 2015 UTC,"Before shifting, while shifting, you know what I mean. Obviously right before you shift.  But please do not spread misinformation. 99% of the time, in regular cars, the cooling system is not intended for the engine to constantly be redlined. It will heat up and cause damage eventually. In a Pagani Zonda, fine maybe not. But in a Corolla, check engine light will come on soon enough.  edit: spelling"
pcars,36w32e,fzed1199,2,Fri May 22 20:32:55 2015 UTC,The GT3 race car we're talking about is not a regular car.    At trackdays or autocross it is not uncommon to reach redline and need to ping the limiter for a bit because upshifting would make you slower.  There's absolutely nothing wrong with doing this in a vehicle that is properly maintained for motorsports use.
pcars,36w32e,TheCrudMan,1 point,Fri May 22 20:59:51 2015 UTC,"I was talking about engines in general. Everyday cars. Where redlining the shit out of them will cause damage.

Well, you aren't going to win with a blown engine. Part of racing is making sure your car makes it to the finish. If you can't do that, you're never going to win.  Tune your car and if after that you're still redlining, yes you are going to have to slow down to save the engine."

But overal, this is bullshit.  It's broken, it's faulty, it's bugged and even these threads are fuckin dead.  The only active place for PCars is the official forums, and the reason is active is because everyone is fucmin fuming and going mental at how fucked this piece of shit is.  Just go read how fucked the console versions are. It's a joke.  Turn 10 have nothing to worry about. Forza 5 is a better looking game (1080/60) smoother and generally better overall.  Yes, pcars has weather (which is not as good as codies or drive club), and darkness, wow! but the fuckin thing runs with 650,000 LESS pixels than Forza 5 and at half the frame rate.   PCars runs apx 30fps in the rain with a full grid on XBO1.  So it's essentially 900/30 when it is doing non Forza related tasks. And when it's doing what Forza does (day and 16 cars) it's still running with 650,000 LESS pixels.  It's a fuckin joke of a game, joke of an engine and yes.. I bought it... 3 fuckin times lol :) all platforms.   Because I believed the hype, I got caught up in it all. Watching videos etc and reading post after post..

pcars,36xprw,Smithy2997,1 point,Sat May 23 19:50:45 2015 UTC,"According to this post the 3 modes are not just slider presets, they change the behavior of the controls (in terms of ""crossover"" and input translation.  There needs to be an official explanation of exactly what these modes change.  Tweaking controls is maddening, even after the patch (which is helpful), because there is no exact information on what change will have what effect.  Example:  ""Deadzone"" in this game is not actually a Deadzone (depending on ""mode""), my experimentation shows that it's more like a Curve Acceleration setting.  But no documentation leaves us in the dark about the best way to go about tweaking.  Example 2:  even if you turn OFF ""Oppppsite Lock Help"", the game still gives a dangerous opposite lock boost.  Moving from analog stick lock right to left causes a VERY fast 100% of steering lock, much faster than if you release the stick and then continue pushing it.  This makes some sense on a ""Physical Wheel"" level (like doing ""Fast Corrections"" on a wheel), but is bad for analog sticks and no other racing game has ever done it, and there is apparently no way to turn this off.  Opposite Lock Help does not change it."

pcars,36x6ue,MethodM4n,2,Fri May 22 22:30:07 2015 UTC,I just completed a rain filled race on Brands Hatch with no issues what so ever. The AI reacted as expected with slower lap times. Maybe it's track dependent I'll have to try it on the Glen. But otherwise make sure you're using the correct tire set for the conditions. The difference between Wet tires and Extreme Wet tires is big enough to notice in certain conditions.

pcars,36ygvk,notaspookorgook,3,Sat May 23 04:31:25 2015 UTC,"First thing you need to do is connect it to your PC and update the firmware. Do not skip this step. If you have an older firmware on the wheel it very well could have overheating issues down the line.   After that simply connect it to your X1, start Project CARS, and follow the calibration instructions. The wheel is at 900 degrees by default. You can change your DOR on the wheel by pressing Mode + Directional Pad Left or Right (4 blinks is 900). You do not need to change this if it's already at 900.   Once your calibrate it the game will set a steering lock around 90 degrees. This will vary from car to car. If you want to adjust the DOR for each car you will do this in tuning (first page - steering rack or something).   Other than that keep in mind the TX has shitty FFB with the X1 version of Project CARS. This will be fixed in an update. Check the official forum for more info about this."

I also did a short four race invitational in Caterham Classics, and won that Championship.  Those wins were extremely rewarding. I put in the time and effort to dial in my tune and racing line, and ended up with a few good performances.  That is something I can't get out of Forza's ""Career"".

pcars,36wcq7,p4rtch1mp,1 point,Sat May 23 01:57:55 2015 UTC,"I think they could had done so much more with it.  It doesn't make sense that every championship is open from the start... it makes it less of a career mode, and just a generic pick a championship and complete it.  I'm fine with having all cars and tracks unlocked from the start... and if you want to immediately do a Formula A season from day one as a single championship, that's fine.  But the career should force you to pick a starter path (open wheel, touring cars, endurance cars, etc) and then work your way up.  Along with working your way up, there should be incentive to get signed on with better teams.  GRID Autosport was even further from a true simulation than Project CARS... but I think that they did the career mode progression better."
pcars,36wcq7,djfil007,-7,Sat May 23 21:50:46 2015 UTC,"I don't like it either.  What's to play for if you're given everything up front?  If it's only about leaderboards then that's going to get old before it starts.  Dirt Rally does career mode like it's supposed to be done.  You have to buy your cars and you better not beat the shit out of them because it's going to cost you big time.  Then as you get monies, you can buy additional cars.  That's how you're supposed to do it.  Project Cars feels like you've entered a cheat mode that gives you everything up front."
pcars,36wcq7,NonBritGit,6,Fri May 22 21:11:42 2015 UTC,"Racing drivers don't buy their cars in real life. You want to save to buy a Formula 1 car? Have fun with that. They certainly don't pay for repairs themselves. Project Cars is trying to emulate what a real racing driver experiences. Just take a look at the history of Formula 1 drivers, they don't start in Karts because they're broke and can't afford anything better. On the contrary, even racing in karts requires a lot of cash/sponsorship. The reason they race in karts is for experience. Motorsports is a ladder, you start at the bottom and work your way up. It's why teams like RedBull and Mclaren have offshoots like Toro Rosso and ART, to develop drivers and prepare them for something higher.   The reason why everything is available at the start is because a decision was made by the WMD community relatively early on for it to be that way. Maybe I just want to jump straight into an LMP1 endurance season and not spend hours unlocking everything before it, I'm glad I have that option.    The sense of accomplishment is supposed to come from the satisfaction of winning races and championships. If you set the AI too low and aren't finding it challenging of course it'll be boring. Racing isn't always about winning. Just scoring in the top 10 or getting a podium can be a personal victory. All you need is a little imagination and the ability to set yourself goals."

Go to official forums and read/listen to the backers/testers who know that there is a delay in the control to steering response that was not there during development: it takes over a second for the front wheels to catch up with extreme steering input! If you have a PC you can get round this be installing other drivers, but you can't do that on a console.  Assetto Corsa and iRacing both have better controller implementation.   I think it must be that recent purchasers can't bring themselves to admit that their new game is a bit of a shocker."

The 8350 has the same IPC as a 6300 and will be no better in gaming.  You need more single thread performance to see an upgrade.  You would be better off keeping the 6300 until you can get an Intel CPU.    You'll be mighty disappointed if you spend $150 on a 8350 because it won't fix your problems.

pcars,36xduw,Dalandlord1981,1 point,Sat May 23 05:38:59 2015 UTC,"One weird thing I've noticed is that when I brake, the game seems to have this awful problem where the car will just launch forwards as if it's compensating some sort of frame loss.  Is this a commonly known issue?   On One, frame rate is an issue for sure.  I've never heard of the car lurching forward, but I've had what appeared to be single-digit frame rates at times, inconveniently during cornering, and at least once it seemed to drop to 0 FPS for half a second and then took off rendering again.  I have a theory regarding my single-digit FPS experiences.  The times I've seen it that bad, I did one race from a race weekend and then quit and later picked up the second without closing the game out.  That also seems to promote loading screen freezes.  So far, if I quit and close the game out between sessions, it seems to perform better."

The biggest issue for me is the delay in steering input to wheel response. I know from the official forums that the backers/testers hate the release implementation of controller steering and have taken to using tricks on the PC version to eliminate the delay; these tricks are not available to console users.  The bottom line for me is this: if they don't give me a way to get rid of the delay, then there's no way I'll spend any more money on the game. So it's over to WMD management and development to decide if they stick with the emperor's new control implementation or not."

pcars,36vs8c,Dalandlord1981,2,Fri May 22 20:53:06 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the effort but mine are all at zero too. If you look at the front wheels when you move the controller to an extreme left or right it takes just over a second for them to catch up with the controller input whatever you do, and so any correction is just down to luck. So controllers only just about work with the car under control, but if it steps out it's out of your hands. Both Assetto Corsa and iRacing work much better with a controller imo; don't let anyone tell you that you can't do it because it's a SIM game. The truth is that the controller implementation is just not good enough here.  Like I said: the backers/testers hate the way it changed upon delivery and have a work round for the PC, using different drivers, to make the car steering as fast as the controller input; console users can't do this."

Thanks for the effort however.   I think I'll take my controller back to Assetto Corsa until there's some sort of change; sure AC is harder as it's a more brutal simulation, but at least it's the cars you are learning to control and not the controller implementation that you are trying to compensate for."
pcars,36vs8c,hyperbolicants,1 point,Sat May 23 05:48:30 2015 UTC,"funny, it really helped me, but it could also be my settings. All deadzones at 10 all sensitivity at 50. and advanced off...

pcars,36vs8c,Dalandlord1981,0,Sat May 23 06:03:22 2015 UTC,"Sure man, it will help; before I changed to zero I couldn't drive in a straight line, the control really is that bad as you know.  But it won't get rid of the second delay in response, and so you will not be able to correct any problems with the car stepping out beyond simple luck corrections. Look at the front wheels as you move the controller sharply to see what I mean; it's this that the backers/testers hate so much on the official forums; unfortunately they are being ignored by the developers who don't seem to be able to contemplate anything other than perfection.   I'd suggest Assetto Corsa; the simulation is harder, but the control implementation works and doesn't make it harder still."

I have trouble in correcting any step out problems on all cars, and I have this trouble not because of any settings or inability to drive a SIM racing game, I have them due to the steering delay.   I have the feeling that you don't believe me. See here (this is just one thread of many) where you will see that this is a known issue that the backers/testers hate; they have a workround on the PC version, but console users don't have a workround for what is a flawed controller implementation:  http://forum.projectcarsgame.com/showthread.php?21992-Setting-up-a-gamepad"

Speed up your turning speed but not to much. Its kind of hard to get right, but just go into free practice and keep experimenting with different settings.You'll get it eventually."

pcars,36vb6z,mav3r1ck92691,2,Fri May 22 17:57:47 2015 UTC,"You can accomplish this in pretty much any car with the default setup by coming into a corner and downshifting 1 to 2 gears MORE than you need to, and then from there balance your steering and throttle.  Too much throttle and you'll spin, too little and you'll just stop sliding (unless you have already passed the point of no return).    Once you start sliding you should be counter steering."
pcars,36uu5a,CannedEther,9,Fri May 22 08:35:55 2015 UTC,"The white line is the edge of the track, not the curb, so if your outside wheels are beyond the curb you must be quite a bit off the track. In real life it varies between series and stewards can be inconsistent. The track limits are usually identified and defined by the stewards in the drivers meeting prior to races. For example in the 2013 Indian grand prix the drivers were allowed to massively extend the track out over the run off curb on the exit of a turn, whereas in the 2014 Austrian grand prix times were excluded from qualifying if anyone went even a millimetre off track on the exit of the penultimate corner.   Cutting at the apex i.e. going across the corner rather than around it is generally never tolerated but track extending on exit sometimes is, depending on the track and stewards discretion."
pcars,36uu5a,lookoutblorgons,2,Fri May 22 09:06:00 2015 UTC,"I'll keep that in mind, thanks!"
pcars,36uu5a,Halmine,4,Fri May 22 09:10:39 2015 UTC,"You must have two wheels on the track at all times according to the rules. What makes the game stricter is the fact that instead of humans actually watching you (marshalls who report it or stewards themselwes), the game instantly knows when you've gone fully off. This means that you can indeed get lucky in real life. And like it was said earlier, it also depends on who makes the calls.   If you go 4 wheels off the track and it gains you time (if you lose time there are generally no repercusions) your lap is invalidated and you receive a warning. After a certain amount of these happening (3 or 4 iirc, might depend on the series) all of your laptimes until that point will be invalidated however in races you'll get disqualified or some other quite severe penalty  Again, there is great variance in real life simply because the stewards will act differently in different situations."
pcars,36uu5a,G2Wolf,2,Fri May 22 12:27:45 2015 UTC,"You must have two wheels on the track at all times according to the rules.   Pretty sure it's just one wheel, not two."
pcars,36uu5a,Halmine,1 point,Fri May 22 17:33:44 2015 UTC,"Depends on the series and then country actually. You're allowed to change some of the rules. But indeed, UK used to use the one wheel rule at least."

pcars,36uu5a,LacSlyer,3,Fri May 22 12:48:50 2015 UTC,"It's because going outside the boundary of the last corner can allow you an advantage upon starting your next lap. If you exceed the last corner boundary you can gain a faster speed down the straight than normal.  However, I do agree as others have said that it should still at least record the lap time (obviously with a notice that it was invalid) so you know what your timings are. This is more obnoxious for laps in the lower end cars on tracks that can surpass 2 minutes."
pcars,36uu5a,keeb119,2,Fri May 22 15:10:55 2015 UTC,"Bloody hell, I think Snetterton has this ugly last corner, with the cosmically huge curb. I always brake too late and go off track."

pcars,36uu5a,linkinstreet,2,Fri May 22 08:58:55 2015 UTC,Spa is really lenient. At Eau Rouge and Pouhon you can take all 4 wheels over the curbs and still have a valid lap. AC is much more strict there for sure.
pcars,36uu5a,Roedrik,1 point,Fri May 22 15:48:36 2015 UTC,"It's a combination of both actually. Too lenient and too strict. For example, you can get an off-track penalty on Spa by simply exiting the pits once you gain control."
pcars,36uu5a,Dalandlord1981,2,Fri May 22 22:37:00 2015 UTC,"It's more strict in the game simply because there aren't any stewards to miss it, or rule it as ""not so bad"", or favor you for some other reason.  You cross the mark the game has defined, and you get penalized.  Done."
pcars,36uu5a,Dalandlord1981,2,Fri May 22 12:44:30 2015 UTC,"I have encountered areas that are buggy, and will say that I went off track even though I had all 4 wheels completely on track. For example on the Summerton kart track just after turn one if you immediately cut over to the left side edge of the track, it will say you went off track even if you're clearly completely still on track. I've seen that happen elsewhere too, but I can't remember where."
pcars,36uu5a,Pan0pticism,2,Fri May 22 15:12:28 2015 UTC,"Depending on the tracks IMO. The first corner for watkin glens for example can be taken on it's entirety off track without penalty. so some corners are more strict than others  One thing for sure tho, Spa and Bathurst have bugs where if you pit, you will be given a penalty when exiting the pit lane which makes no sense as the car is auto controlled by the game"

pcars,36uc5h,WHATTUPDOOSH,2,Fri May 22 14:01:16 2015 UTC,"But typically in real racing, if you're not racing for position, doesn't the car about to get lapped usually get a blue flag?   Not always. If the car you are trying to pass is going to be put '1' lap down, in most racing series they have the right to defend that position in order to prevent it assuming they have similar pace with the car behind. Say the driver is 2 or more laps down or further off the pace then the driver should yield (blue flag) to the faster car behind them.  Anyways I do agree with pretty much all your points. This game is missing a few small features it desperately needs."
pcars,36uc5h,MethodM4n,6,Fri May 22 06:13:01 2015 UTC,"Not trying to be a dick, but I don't think your summary of Blue Flags is correct. It is my understanding that if you are going to be put 1 lap down, or simply 'lapped', a blue flag will be shown. The reason for this is that the cars are not racing each other, and therefore the car about to be lapped has no business interfering with the car behind him at that time. Where the blue flag can vary is in how formally the flag is enforced... in some motor sports, I think the flag is used for courtesy only, but does not 'need' to be obeyed, but in others, such as F1, drivers will receive penalties for not obeying. The other consideration would be the pace of the cars in question; a blue flag is only applicable if the car behind is 'faster' than the car about to be lapped. If they are on the same pace, I don't believe a blue flag would be shown. In most cases though, this isn't the reality as there will be a difference in pace that has resulted in the current track positions. So to address the OP's comment. It may depend on which class you were racing in... and in fairness, I don't know whether P Cars has an effective and comprehensive flag system at the moment."
pcars,36uc5h,Dagmer-Cleftjaw,1 point,Fri May 22 09:25:06 2015 UTC,"Can't be assed to look up the actual rule, but in the US Sports Car Series/old Rolex Series, as an example, I've never seen a blue flag given to a car trying to stay on the lead lap as the leader comes up behind them.    As you said, it's too series dependent to cover everything in a general statement."
pcars,36uc5h,freedomweasel,1 point,Fri May 22 12:48:02 2015 UTC,Yeah no blue flags are ever used in WEC or TUSC. In tudc you have the option to get back on lead on a FCY

pcars,36t1cu,hacker9001,2,Fri May 22 12:45:55 2015 UTC,"Making something more difficult has nothing to do with the realism of a game. You turning off features that cars have in real life, is probably taking away from the experience you get from these cars.  First off, most supercars have insanely technical ABS and TC systems which vastly increase the handling and feel of the car. You turning these systems off, for apparently no reason other than you like to struggle with a car, has no benefit to realism.   It would be like landing a plane without flaps. No, you don't need them to land.. but it makes it a fuck ton easier to land when they are out. THAT'S WHY THEY'RE THERE. We've used this thing called Science on many inventions throughout the ages; using ABS and TC was so we could push cars to their limits, going faster around a corner where one wheel may not catch as much grip but OUR ONBOARD COMPUTER independently controls each wheel so that you don't spin out."

pcars,36t1cu,J03130,4,Fri May 22 13:16:23 2015 UTC,"Your argument is pointless. I'm pretty sure nobody here raced a LMP1 car and can know the difference of it with or without TC.  The point is, it's more realistic, that you driven it or not in real life.  Some people play Battlefield 4 over CoD because it's more realistic(strategy, vehicules, bullets drop), and yet most players never fired a hand gun. How would they know that the sniper's bullet drop is more realistic? It just is. You dont have to know the real feel to enjoy the extra realism.  Edit: you paid for your game, you can enjoy it the way you want. If you want it harder and with less realism with all assists off, go ahead and enjoy it. But dont think that you get a more ""real feel"" because you play it on hardcore. Some other people like myself dont care at all how hardcore the game is, we just want the closer experience possible from reality, even if this mean using cars with assists."

Because it requires more skill to drive without assists the pros use.  Driving with aids is easy mode, even when the pros do it.

I haven't tried using assists with PCars yet, but I'll have a go at it.  I'm afraid of using assists in general as I feel it ruins vehicle control, but again, that's just a broad statement.  Perhaps my lap times will improve in GT3 since at the moment I have to ease back on the throttle as to not spin after a turn.  I'm guessing with TC I can punch it a bit quicker."
pcars,36t1cu,SoullessPolack,4,Fri May 22 02:04:59 2015 UTC,"I've been using no assists, but if the Real assist feature is accurate then I'm going to switch to it.

pcars,36rsy9,hyperbolicants,3,Thu May 21 21:14:17 2015 UTC,"thanks for sharing.  As someone who is somewhere in between a ""tapper"" and a ""constant control"" driver one think i have to emphasize is TUNING SETUPS. The cars right out of the box are not drivable so TUNING IS A MUST and helps as much as controller settings.   Another vital part of the game is the actual control on track (as you have already mentioned in another reply). Remembering that the triggers are also analog, and allow for gradual increases and decreases of acceleration and braking, the player has to remember that they cant just slam on the brakes going into a turn or smash the gas coming out of a turn. Many forza players will know that this is important when you have all assists off and are driving high hp rwd cars or pretty much any car above class A."
pcars,36rsy9,Dalandlord1981,2,Thu May 21 21:48:22 2015 UTC,"Right, i heard for controllers, the optimal STEERING RATIO is from 7-9 but i prefer up to 15 on most cars. Also, tire pressure plays into it as well. Theres a recent post with a video about that as well lol"

pcars,36rw03,steve_jahbs,19,Sat Jun 6 16:22:51 2015 UTC,"SMS have released an unfinished game, and are not handling the backlash very well at all. Especially Ian Bell, who I believe is the lead dev. His snarky, condescending attitude to people who have legitimate complaints does not reflect well on the company. They are treating their customers like fools and that is not a smart way to run a business. Their basic attitude is ""you just don't understand the game noob go back to Need for Speed ya derp.""  I admit I'm playing the hell out of this game despite the state it's in, because when everything is working, it's spectacular. But all in all, SMS have really come off like amateurs given the state they released the game in, and the manner in which they are handling it."
pcars,36rw03,Fred_Zeppelin,6,Thu May 21 17:31:10 2015 UTC,"""you just don't understand the game noob go back to Need for Speed ya derp.""   There are a lot of things in games like pCARS are not familiar to many unless you play a lot of racing games on PC. Namely things like AI where you do need to treat it like a real driver, not treating them as a rolling obstacle or my personal favourite in Grid, my crash impact absorber when I brake too late. Cutting into their driving lines wont work here as well in NFS as the AI cant brake instantly. Trying to the same to the AI in other racing games on PC, like R3E, GSCE, AC and so on, you'll probably find yourself getting pit off the road or the AI behaves oddly. The AI is not perfect as I had my own list of issues, mainly with cut tracks with it but I can see why some SMS staff said that.  Or treating that each car is as easy to drive as the other one where I had seen people jumping straight into a Formula 1, LMP1 or a hyper car like a Pagani then claim that the game has awful physics or too icy cars.   Especially for a new player, the game poorly explains a lot of features and mechanics in general where sometimes I think, this game really needs a RTS style mechanics by mechanics introduction tutorial and a lot of pop up tool tips as there are a lot of people do not understand why suddenly their cars becomes so icy because their tires cooled down or whats the difference between Soft, Hard and Wet tires.  SMS is never good in dealing with pissed off people and I am not surprised to see it here again. I had also seen a lot of people being rude and demanding which I am not surprised that they had started banning people. Their moderation approach might not be the best but they wanted to prevent the official forums from becoming an unpleasant place like every other game's official forums."
pcars,36rw03,Cheesenium,2,Fri May 22 01:20:53 2015 UTC,"Namely things like AI where you do need to treat it like a real driver, not treating them as a rolling obstacle or my personal favourite in Grid, my crash impact absorber when I brake too late.   Sorry, but you can't excuse the AI in this game which will absolutely try to go for the inside line EVERY. SINGLE. TIME. WITHOUT. EXCPTION. and punt you off the road.  I mean i get it, i really do, racing is racing, but it happens FAR too often in PCARS that its utterly unplayable."
pcars,36rw03,EnviousCipher,2,Fri May 22 04:36:22 2015 UTC,"I definitely wish the career mode would have started by giving me a tutorial on some of the game features, or at least asked if I've played before or want to go through a tutorial.  It didn't take long for me to assume that tire/brake temperature was a thing, but it wasn't obvious at first, and I particularly would have appreciated knowing it.  Other than that, I think the games pretty solid and don't really understand the complaints most people are making (accept this nvidia shit)"
pcars,36rw03,ecnahc515,4,Fri May 22 02:15:58 2015 UTC,"I really think the game needs a tutorial mode to teach the newcomers. Most terms in the game are quite common to motorsports fan but for average gamer, it is like asking them to read a book on a foreign language.   The nvidia and AMD shit is tiring. I highly doubt its SMS fault as I used and hardware since 2011 till Beta, the game ran fine but the newer drivers ruined something. This isn't the first time I seen this by AMD blaming another party from consumer point view. In 2010, I bought a laptop that has a 5870 Mobility that is shipped with a bugged BIOS where you PC will restart with a grey screen of death. The GPU's BIOS was not written properly by ATi back then so if you used any newer official laptop drivers, you'll be greeted with GSOD. Various manufacturer who used this GPU were affected by it and AMD blamed them for under designing the GPU into their laptops then asked the consumers not to upgrade the OEM drivers that is awful for newer games like BFBC2. Even the lower end 5750 Mobility could use official laptop drivers. Everyone who bought a laptop with 5870 Mobility literally bought a $2000 brick that can't play any games. Official support from ATi were shit and left unsolved for almost a year until a hacker modified the BIOS that fixed the issue for my model.   If I'm not wrong, now AMD is playing victim over an optional Gameworks feature in Witcher 3 that tanks the FPS. Even when similar nvidia GPU also had similar decrease in performance. Then, a pcars ready driver was delayed when they are preparing a Witcher 3 ready driver.   IMO, AMD really need to work on their support."
pcars,36rw03,Cheesenium,1 point,Fri May 22 03:46:05 2015 UTC,"Hairworks in Witcher 3 tanks performance on nvidia cards as well. It utilizes too much tessellation, similar to what was done in Crysis 3. I'm talking about unnecessary amounts which only serves to lower performance. AMD cards don't devote as much hardware into tesselation so they perform worse under such circumstances. It has been speculated that nvidia intentionally ramped up tessellation in hairworks for that reason (also the nvidia 900 series handle tessellation better than its predecessors).  I think PCars runs badly on AMD drivers because of the lack of some dx11 multithreading support. I had one guy explaining it to me and he said it will probably not be added so if what he said is true, then that is definitely AMD's fault. I can't verify that though so take it with a grain of salt."
pcars,36rw03,billythemule,2,Fri May 22 23:31:29 2015 UTC,"SMS have released an unfinished game  I admit I'm playing the hell out of this game despite the state it's in   I've only played about 6 hours in career, solo and practice but can you explain what exactly you mean by this? The game looks and runs amazing on my pretty modest rig and feels great with the G27. I'm honestly having a blast so far and am kind of surprised to find it being discussed as unfinished."
pcars,36rw03,ReeG,3,Thu May 21 19:53:33 2015 UTC,Here is a link to the known issues thread in the official forum. It's a pretty long list and many are significant issues that should have been addressed before release:   http://forum.projectcarsgame.com/showthread.php?22497-Known-Issues-Collective-Thread-(XB1)-Not-for-bug-reporting!-Update-21-05&highlight=issues+thread
pcars,36rw03,Fred_Zeppelin,3,Thu May 21 19:56:59 2015 UTC,"If you look at the list of issues with the game and remember that the game got delayed 4 times you'll start to understand where some of us are coming from. Honestly, I wasn't that upset any of the times I heard the game was going to be postponed, but I'm honestly shocked at how unpolished the game is overall with those postponements. Minor things like limited car setups, difficulty in changing livery, badly designed track restrictions (there's literally a track that you'll receive an off-track penalty upon gaining control of your car coming out of the pits, as well as a considerable number of tracks where your pit driver will hit walls in pit lanes), and more are just the tip of the iceberg of how poorly managed this game was when it comes to completion. Things that should have been fixed in beta even if they are just minor issues. That's not me including any of the serious issues that exist either.  I'm with you though, I've enjoyed a lot of the game so far and easily have 30 hours in it already. But I'm seriously disappointed in how the game was released."
pcars,36rw03,LacSlyer,2,Thu May 21 21:04:43 2015 UTC,Ya I see now from the link /u/Fred_Zeppelin posted. I guess I haven't noticed a lot of this stuff from just playing relatively short career and solo races offline but some of that stuff is pretty bad especially around the controller and rendering issues.
pcars,36rw03,ReeG,3,Thu May 21 21:22:33 2015 UTC,"If you're not familiar with other racing sims it probably wouldn't stand out to you. Don't get me wrong, I keep coming back to the game as I enjoy the racing immersion immensely, it's just frustrating as hell that minor issues even exist after all the delays."
pcars,36rw03,LacSlyer,2,Thu May 21 21:33:48 2015 UTC,The only other I've played a lot is Assetto Corsa and while I love that game it's pretty bare bones and Pcars feels a lot more complete to me as a game so far
pcars,36rw03,ReeG,1 point,Fri May 22 02:08:26 2015 UTC,"Sure it's bare bones, but it's polished compare to pCARS. It's not riddled with bugs in every aspect of the game."
pcars,36rw03,LacSlyer,1 point,Fri May 22 02:15:57 2015 UTC,"There are a lot of bugs in the game but the main functions are mostly bug free. If the game was released last December, you'll be facing worse bugs like bad car setup, physics bugs, crash to desktop, poor optimisation or AI that drives like demolition derby or off track all the time that is far worse than now.  Say what you want about the game but I am actually glad that it was delayed 3 times because I dont really need to face those bugs."
pcars,36rw03,Cheesenium,0,Fri May 22 01:08:59 2015 UTC,"I have no doubt it'd be worse, but that doesn't make the current release all that good. There are numerous bugs in nearly every aspect of the game. Sure for the most part we can still race, and multiplayer is mostly fine, but the game is just plagued with a few major bugs and numerous minor bugs that can seriously effect gameplay.   So sure, it's better than a release 6 months ago, but good god what did they do in those 6 months?"
pcars,36rw03,LacSlyer,0,Fri May 22 01:35:33 2015 UTC,"So sure, it's better than a release 6 months ago, but good god what did they do in those 6 months?   Fixing those game breaking bugs. There was a point that each daily patch will break something like today's patch made road cars drives like karts because the physics broke then tomorrow's patch broke the weather where there is no light at all for night racing. Or a new feature that completely tanks for fps because it is unoptimised.   If you looked at other racing games on PC such as AC, R3E, rF2 and so on, those games are never finished or 100% polished. Arguably, pCARS is in a better state than a lot of these games. The problem is, pCARS is ambitious where they want to put a lot in it where there arent enough time to polish it. The console builds are probably worse than PC because they are not tested daily by the backers. I bought even more buggy games by AAA publishers, I wont say pCARS is as buggy as Assassins Creed Unity or Battlefield 4 on launch. There are still a lot of bugs in pCARS but those bugs will probably take some time to fix, unfortunately as much as I want to see it fixed now."
pcars,36rw03,Cheesenium,1 point,Fri May 22 01:59:53 2015 UTC,"Firstly, just because other games may have been buggy doesn't mean it's alright that this game is. Secondly, AC was in a considerably better state in it's pre-release phase than this game is with it's riddled bugs that are all over the place. And that's not even including the obviously overlooked missing features as well. But still, other games being buggy shouldn't allow this game to get away with it.   Sure they're ambitious, but hell that doesn't make up for this ridiculous state that the game is in where there's literally a bug in nearly every aspect of the game. That on top of the obvious lack of polish the game has suggests they shouldn't have released it and just kept working on it."
pcars,36rw03,LacSlyer,1 point,Fri May 22 02:08:07 2015 UTC,"AC was released in a relatively bug free state since Early Access but the issue with that is, the game is very bare bones. Even till now, it still best played as hotlap simulator because the racing is terrible due to it's AI and also unfinished multiplayer UI with occasionally poor netcode. Heck, even the rear end collision happy issue with the AI persist in the game for months until 1.1 yet most people decided to overlook it. AC is a great game but I could never understand why people are so lenient with Kunos and being so harsh with SMS.  At the same time, was pCARS as buggy as Assassins Creed Unity with it's bugs galore or as bad as Battlefield 4's launch with broken multiplayer? Or it is like Diablo 3 with that infamous Error 37 where I bought it on day 1 and I couldnt play for over a week. I am not saying that pCARS should be let off from these bugs, I cant see as much game breaking bugs in that game at the moment compared to those games."
pcars,36rw03,Cheesenium,1 point,Fri May 22 06:15:48 2015 UTC,AC was released in a relatively bug free state since Early Access   AC was never relatively bugfree. It only appears so at first glance.  It always was and still is full of bugs.
pcars,36rw03,Associat0r,0,Fri May 22 08:23:54 2015 UTC,"Yet that's not the point is it? Just because you can load and play the game doesn't mean the bugs in it are alright and that we should accept that every game will have bugs. I'm not being lenient with Kunos over SMS, I'm just as harsh with them about their bugs. However, their bugs don't rob you of core gameplay features of the game. Such as tires not wearing properly, or the boundaries of the tracks not being accurate so that when you come out of pit lane you receive an off-track warning. This is the kind of crap that should have been fixed in beta.  There are noticeable bugs and oversights that shouldn't have been in a game that was postponed as often as this game was and it's severely disappointing because there's so many minor things that really bring it down."
pcars,36rw03,LacSlyer,2,Fri May 22 13:01:14 2015 UTC,"Every time I hear about how SMS is responding to customer complaints, I get sad. I spent a lot of money on this game, considering the amount I spent for a wheel, and I had hoped for a Community-Assisted-Racing-Simulator. Not a Fuck-You-We-Already-Have-Your-Money-So-Quit-Complaining-Racing-Simulator.   I was originally going to go all-out and purchase the season pass when it becomes available, but I don't know if I want to support this company anymore. The next few weeks will give me my answer. Hopefully they cut it out.  I just bought The Witcher 3, which has been out for 2 days. Within that time, CD Projekt Red (the developer) has already released two patches for PC and has announced that they're working on an update to patch the biggest issues/bugs/suggestions people have had since release. This is the kind of response to customers that gets people to keep buying your products."

SMS had sent out 2 patches so far for pCARS on PC while the console patches are still in certification as far as I know.   SMS generally communicate to the fans poorly and yes, they do need a community manager to handle all these things as a lot of their staff arent that good in handling PR stuff on their own."
pcars,36rw03,Cheesenium,1 point,Fri May 22 06:25:20 2015 UTC,"Sorry, I should have explained myself better. Other than the poor communication with customers, what really frustrates me are their replies to some of the most common complaints, like the AI. I've been taking a look at the PCars forum, and reading a few threads here and there for the past couple weeks or so- and some of their responses are just ridiculous. In most of the threads I've read, they continually imply blame on the player- and defend these obvious bugs as gameplay features instead of just taking the communities' complaints seriously and committing themselves to fixing the issue. It's extremely rude and condescending, and I've just grown tired of reading threads there. I play on the PS4, and I haven't heard anything about patches at all, but at least PC players have gotten some updates so far. I know that they're not abandoning the game anytime soon, but I am worried that we are not going to see the kind of improvements that we're hoping for.  Don't get me wrong, I love this game. The core experience is so solid that I can forgive a few bugs here and there when I'm playing. My personal experience has been mostly pretty great. However, it's obvious that the game lacks the polish that it- and the community-deserves. When I read threads like this it just makes me pessimistic about the future of the game. That, and I lose the initial excitement I had to be a part of their community and support them as a developer."
pcars,36rw03,ssultansofswing,0,Fri May 22 08:54:28 2015 UTC,"I dont know how is the console patches going but I am quite sure that there is one for Xbox One that is in certification now to fix the twitchy issue on gamepad. Generally, I know PS4 is launched with less issues so I guess they are concentrating on Xbox One and also the AMD issue on PC.  The AI issue is partly due to player and also the AI coding that I think the Ai still needs some work. There are times that I get pit out of the track because I drove directly into the AI's driving line which it is my fault for cutting into the AI. The reason I said that is because I had seen youtube videos of people driving in the same way I drive in NFS on pCARS which at the end they complained that the AI is garbage when they are cutting the AI's lines everywhere. On the other hand, there are time the AI pit me off the road because my braking pace was different from theirs, gone offroad and cut through the corner, sway off the track when I made a sudden movement or they rammed me because they want to overtake me. The AI undeniably has issues but I understand where the developers is coming from which I hope a compromise between both will be achieved at the end. The game needs patches and things like AI fixes isnt done in a week or 2 as it is quite difficult to tune it right.  I stopped going to the official forums as it is hard to explain to angry people without sounding like defending SMS. After pCARS launch with so many political and technical issues, I dont even know I want to keep playing racing games anymore due to divisive and pessimistic community. It is depressing to see all these that ranges from ""rival"" racing game fans smearing pCARS with misleading information, abysmal Xbox One launch, AMD issues where I used to play fine on AMD pre-release and bugs everywhere even though Gold build looked fine.  I guess I am done with this sub too."

The pathetic AI for instance, that practically every invested member on their forums denies and blames on the way people are driving.   As I said before, the primary issue on the forums is two fold. You have invested members blindly defending the game and mods protecting them. So very little gets accomplished there outside of reporting a bug."
pcars,36rw03,therdodoubleg,1 point,Thu May 21 23:53:03 2015 UTC,"Oh I have, yet they continue to go on that it's not the AI, it's the driver. What's worse is I actually found a valid way to experience how bad the AI can be at times that completely removes the driver skill from the equation, yet people still deny it.  Simply start a solo weekend race, setup a practice session, and select a short track (i.e. Brand's Hatch) and max out the number of drivers. Start the session and click drive to begin. Then immediately bring the menu back up and select simulate session. This will put the AI driving your car. Select spectate and you can watch. You'll get first hand evidence of how stupid the AI can be and there's literally no excuse as to what they do at that point because the driver isn't even involved with their behavior."

The sad part is that it's not just the blind defending of the game that the majority of the members do that's bad, but the moderation is obviously biased toward ""premium"" users (read: people who invested in the game). Those users are typically allowed to get away with belittling and mocking users who bring up known issues in defense of their game. It's really disappointing, and I'm hoping other sites will become more popular for the community solely because I want access to information on the game (i.e. car setups, leagues).   The forum is just pathetic at this point. They praise anyone who comes in with any positive feedback while anything negative in the slightest gets shot down immediately.

They get to know each other pretty well and a result there's a dynamic that gets formed and now that there's a group of new people coming in the dynamic that's established is affecting the overall quality of the forums.  I've stopped spending time in the Xbox section trying to help people because of some of the things that have gone on in there, and that's really disappointing, because I want people to like this game. Not because it gives a bunch of people a bunch of money (I was the tier below getting financial return on the game), but because it is, at its core, a good game that deserves the chance to become better in the future."
pcars,36rw03,hyperbolicants,2,Fri May 22 02:30:52 2015 UTC,"I couldn't agree with you more. Which is why it upsets me so much that it's so poorly handled. The moderating alone should be cleaned up, and that would go a long way in making things better.  I completely understand the situation that you describe though and can see why people are so defensive about the game. But there's also the whole dynamic of people being invested in the game as well likely causing a big part of the issue here. And I don't just mean invested with money, but emotion as well, as they've been waiting for this game for a long time. But that doesn't excuse what goes on there in any way and is why I hope that it either gets fixed (which I don't count on) or that the community shifts somewhere less problematic for non-premium members.   Like you said, I want improvements for the exact reasons you do, because I see the potential this game has. It's just extremely disconcerting that the primary access for information for this game is that forum that's starting to get out of control, in my opinion."
pcars,36rw03,SandyBunker,2,Fri May 22 02:38:37 2015 UTC,"Noted. If they start to play games like this, when we all know that there are multiple bugs that need a fix and an ETA on when a fix can be expected, then they won't be getting any more of my money.  I am more than happy to vote with my wallet and to be vocal about why I am doing so."
pcars,36rw03,Associat0r,2,Fri May 22 02:47:46 2015 UTC,"How SMS handles the next couple of months will determine the future of the company.  If they choose to ignore all of the issues that were released across multiple platforms after months of delays and excuses, then they will suffer greatly in cash flow.  You can only ignore people who pay hard earned money for a half ass product for so long.   I for one will not spend another dime on this until I see improvements and patches that fix what should have been in the initial release. This is also the last product I will ever buy in the first weeks. I purchased the Steam PC version and the XBox One version. Huge mistake. Any class action suit that is created I will sign up for in a heart beat. This stinks of EA tactics and I was burned too many times by EA.  One other thing that really bothers me is how Steam just ignores all issues. But in a way I can't blame them, they just sell the game. I can't call it a Sim. NASCAR 2003 was much more of a Sim than this will ever be.  Forza 5 had me waiting for Project Cars. Now Project Cars has me praying that Forza 6 will deliver a finished product and not half baked.   But I will never buy any software Sim/Game again until a month after it's released.  I'll let all the review junkies review it and then read between the lines and read the forums. SMS has over hyped and promoted this game to be the end all, be all. And it's 50% of what was promised in demo videos to say the least.  Never again !!!"
pcars,36rw03,aescobar32,2,Fri May 22 02:53:59 2015 UTC,"I never preorder games.  It's a personal rule of mine, to avoid getting burned.  Unfortunately, I got suckered in by the massive hype for this game, broke my own rule and paid the price for it with loads of bugs and patch promises."

pcars,36rw03,mav3r1ck92691,4,Fri May 22 01:55:33 2015 UTC,"I had around 170 posts on that forum.  All were civil and professional.  Never vulgar, no use of profanity, yet I was banned for the simple fact I continued to point out issues with the game.  WMD clearly does not want to be made aware of bugs and problems as they are found by the end users.  It's that simple."
pcars,36rw03,Dalandlord1981,10,Fri May 22 08:29:23 2015 UTC,"I think you were banned because you continually said stuff like this:  ""This definitely needs to be pinned. They probably won't though because doing so would mean they acknowledge this as yet another bug.""  Even after a moderator thanked you for pointing out the bug and told you how to supply more information...  Further more, there was no reason to sticky that thread, and you made a similar comment again today on it.  I am not supporting the ban, as I never support a ban for voicing an opinion, however that is probably the reason they did it."
pcars,36rw03,manlydishwasher,4,Thu May 21 17:10:20 2015 UTC,"Which is really bad. AT the very least a moderator should have PM'd MaxKillz to say something similar to what you had posted, asking him not to repeat himself and clutter any threads.  Then and only then if Max ignored the request would it be acceptable.  Max where you messaged privately by a mod, before the ban?"

The corporations , including reddit, are doing everything in their power to protect their shareholders.  this is nothing new. EA and Activision typically lead this methodology by example. can't say boo his about any aspect of their game that can be frowned upon an investor.  They go as far as hiring a payroll of moles and yesmen to post cringeworthy topics on official forums, to keep the discussion ongoing, just like american politics.  business as usual,   enjoy their games, or make your own, it's really that simple folks.  and always remember, young gamers of today, don't just buy games for the sake of buying them, please vote carefully with your wallets. don't let anyone ever dictate your beliefs in your principle of matters. you have the power to change, it starts from within.  currently, coporations have the millennials by the balls this generation, but you can change things for the next."

But I am just really unimpressed with how SMS operate. They push back the game 3 times, after 3 years of development, because they wanted it to be perfect. Then they release a very imperfect game anyway, and lock threads/ban people from their forums for taking them to task on it. It's really amateur-ish and unprofessional, all around."
pcars,36rw03,mav3r1ck92691,2,Thu May 21 19:22:59 2015 UTC,"yup! customer service is one of those topics that really grinds my gears. i generally believe that the average customer is often very reasonable and willing to accept faults in a product. had SMS aired out the room ahead of time, or at least made a timely response to issues found with the release, i believe the sentiment with SMS would be of a more positive light. yes we are disappointed, some more than others, but SMS really cannot maintain this path or they will likely find themselves without the trust of a niche customer base. i can only hope these are growing pains for SMS and not something more systemic.   is it a misconception of mine to not expect much professionalism from devs? i'm not aware of the type of exposure they have to customer interaction type training."

In which case your ban was justified. I've actually been mean to people that were acting stupid, and all I got were warnings. So I feel like you have to really go out of your way to get banned on the official forums. The mods actually tolerate a lot of bullshit."

WMD members are blindly defending bugs, but the irrefutable things like oversights cannot be defended when a game advertises itself as the ultimate simulator when it makes branding mistakes (something you never ever ever do). I suspect a forum mod /wmd backer did the banning, not the studio or its employees.  my view on the branding issue  EDIT: topic closed with this fine response ""it is on the ""fix list"" waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay near the bottom, so many bigger issues on the list.

pcars,36rw4q,VR46,13,Thu May 21 17:20:21 2015 UTC,20 new settings could also be 4 new tracks with 5 layouts each.  Not doing anything until I see a track and car list.    The gamble of a season pass isn't worth the money saved in my opinion.

I think there is probably more as I dont know what are the licensed ovals and Indy tracks.  Cars wise, there are also still a lot of left over licensed content for the core game that isnt finished or even started yet.  The only concern is the price seemed rather steep though."

I know they prioritized getting 60fps on the PS4, it may be that this effect makes it dip below that. That way, you can enable it if you're willing to take a small dip in fps.

What do you guys think?"
pcars,36srg9,p3dr0maz,2,Thu May 21 20:59:44 2015 UTC,Its hard for me to compare the two graphically since i cant even play PCars on full performance settings but on AC i can max it out.  One thing to note about this track in particular is that the AC version is laser scanned and PCars isnt.  Doesnt affect graphics/textures but just another tidbit about it.
pcars,36srg9,Trueno07,2,Thu May 21 22:13:21 2015 UTC,"Assetto does have better FFB but that hasnt stopped me from having a blast in pcars. You'll enjoy it over a controller or keyboard, no doubt about it."

pcars,36srg9,2FastHaste,2,Fri May 22 09:28:16 2015 UTC,"The road effects on Nordschleife are pretty intense on AC. If you set the FFB effects for it to 100% throughout you have quite a challenge at your hands (literally), but that's half the fun! Though pCARS has some great FFB for my taste as well. Like on pCARS the wheel has weight to it when stationary while on AC it doesn't. Unless I forgot to set an option on my wheel or ingame."

pcars,36slrx,Zachk907,2,Thu May 21 20:53:42 2015 UTC,Generally speaking it's as simple as raising the ride height but stiffening the springs and raising tyre pressures can help too. Unfortunately sometimes you do need to compromise a good setup to prevent it.

pcars,36rhnn,BussDH,14,Thu May 21 15:24:23 2015 UTC,pcars suffers from frequency clipping which results in audible clicks.  Forza sounds as if all of its audio samples were recorded in an underground parking lot.

pcars,36rhnn,FranktheShank1,2,Thu May 21 20:10:12 2015 UTC,"Honestly, what one guy said in the comments about Forza and the whole ""underground parking lot"" thing you're saying here seemed to make sense... A ton of reverb/echo from the stands/garage in Forza.  It's clearly overdone, but adds a different sense of realism, just like how you can hear the crowd cheering once you get out of the starting ""hallway"" so to speak and the reverb dies down is pretty neat as well, it just sounds like there's a lot more space in Forza, Project CARS is focusing heavily on the sound coming from the car, and there isn't really anything in the form of ambiance, from what I could tell there.  This is coming from someone who owns GT6 and PCars btw. I don't own an Xbox/360/Xbone.  The PCars actual CAR though, sounds much more up my alley, as it's more grumbly and aggressive, I don't know what a Focus RS sounds like irl so I can't really comment on which one is more realistic."

There seems to be some sort of bug that messes with the FFB when you enter and exit the pause menu, but it seems like I'm the only one who experiences it.  GT and Forza 4 have nothing on the game as far as racing feel while using a wheel, as far as I'm concerned. I've played both of those extensively with the CSR (bought it for use in Forza 4, then bought a PS3 for GT6 when it came out) and PCars blows them out of the water."

It would give another layer to online races if a pit for some extra fuel was required.   Also if you set your fuel consumption to off, and then lower your starting fuel it seems to bug out. I haven't really tested it to be honest, BUT I did the full California Highway with no fuel consumption and lowered my starting fuel down to one. It started the race with 97.1 of fuel....I wasn't too pleased."

Right now with full fuel loads (which we will need to run to remain competitive) our stints are 45-50 minutes.  I would prefer them to be 20-25 minutes.  We can't make twice as many stops as everyone else and expect to win, and also sitting around for an hour is not ideal.  Driving on rapidly wearing tires is no fun either.  Accelerated fuel consumption is used by pretty much every other computer sim out there.  It's just not part of this one yet."

pcars,36q3ag,TheMagicNagger,3,Thu May 21 05:53:12 2015 UTC,"Reduce tyre pressure on the rear for rear wheel drive cars, opposite for FWD. Reduce camber a small bit and set Toe to neutral,put deceleration differential to high to stop spin on throttle off to help braking into a corner. Soften the springs and drop the ride height a bit also but you dont need to do this by much.  Reduce brake power/force, set steering ratio to a slower setting. Set radiator opening and brake ducts to small.  If you need more grip alter the down force a little. If you still spin when braking, adjust bump stops/slow/fast etc so they don't provide extra turning ability (which is usually tall/stiff)  TLDR:Stiff & twitchy cars aquaplane really easily"

From a concentration point of view alone I don't think a lot of people could handle it, especially as the field inevitably spreads out and you're not racing anyone anymore."
pcars,36otbg,lookoutblorgons,2,Thu May 21 08:18:01 2015 UTC,"Could split it to 3 hour sessions. To keep the grid the same you could call it stops on the 3 hour mark and have everyone line up on the grid in the order they stopped in, have a 15-30 min break, start again.

We would have to enforce people to only use either the R18 or the other two cars.  I don't think the issue of being too spread out is much of an issue at all. There may be 1-2 very quick drivers but overall, most people will be bunched up as they always are during races. You get packs of 3-4 cars racing. It's a non-issue."

pcars,36pizh,Ptopman,1 point,Thu May 21 04:21:55 2015 UTC,or even too loose because of the oscillating movement of you going left and right   That's controller/wheel deadzone.
pcars,36mvub,nightpilot,4,Wed May 20 15:32:07 2015 UTC,My fix for this is to run 90% AI for quali and 80% for the race.  No matter your difficulty you run on you should be ok to drop 10% for the race.  Keep in mind to do this you cannot continue straight from the quali to the race because it does not give you the option to change the difficulty.  You have to exit out of the career mode after quali and load back in.  Then before the race you will have the ability to change the difficulty.
pcars,36mvub,sigurd07,2,Wed May 20 16:59:21 2015 UTC,Yeah I'll try that. It's a pitty that this method is needed though. I hope that a patch will take care of this...

pcars,36mvub,AznTri4d,2,Wed May 20 23:04:57 2015 UTC,"For me the AI runs quickest in Practice 1, slower in qualifying and in between on the race.   For instance AI was getting 1:37 in practice 1, 1:41 in qualifying and consistent low 1:40s-1:41 during the race."
pcars,36mvub,sigurd07,1 point,Wed May 20 17:10:19 2015 UTC,Another thing I have noticed is that if there is quite a bit of time left in the quali session and you skip to end sometimes the ai will produce a time 2-3 seconds faster than what they had to that point.  It seems though if you just fast forward to the end this doesn't happen.
pcars,36mvub,qwertyytrewq99,2,Wed May 20 17:49:17 2015 UTC,"Skipping to the end is totally broken. Some weird glitch with a single AI improving his time by several seconds, securing a pole with a huge margin. Never happens when you play through the entire session."

pcars,36mvub,RipVanVVinkle,1 point,Thu May 21 03:10:48 2015 UTC,"I've just been running them lower so I don't have to back out for the races like the top post says. If I'm securing pole in a series when their at 90% but then can't keep up with them during the race I'll just run the entire weekend with them at 80%. I typically take pole by a wider margin but it beats dropping out and adjusting and then loading everything again.   Just makes the run for pole less competitive which sucks, but I'll sandbag during qualifying sometimes too just so I can start 3rd to 5th (which has turned out to be a lot harder than I originally thought it would be)."
pcars,36mvub,SageBlue085,1 point,Thu May 21 13:51:08 2015 UTC,"Haven't tried GT3 yet. With the Renault Clio Cup for comparison, find the AI quick in Practice 1, they're less competitive in qualifying, then their race pace is somewhere inbetween.   However in Practice 1, they seem to know how to run well out of the box on cold brakes and cold tires. I can compete early on once I understand the car on cold brakes and tires. Not too difficult to compete with them once the brakes and tires have warmed up."
pcars,36mvub,LacSlyer,1 point,Wed May 20 20:27:07 2015 UTC,"This is a big problem to, ai just doesn't seem to be affected by cold tires..."
pcars,36mvub,papawhiskey89,5,Wed May 20 21:34:42 2015 UTC,"It's stated by the devs that they AI don't have anywhere near the physics modeling that the driver has to deal with when it comes to tires. For example, a known ""bug"" is that they can race in slicks in the rain and be considerably faster than you.   They're not effected by cold tires, slicks in the rain, wets in the dry, or any of the loss of grip from not being on the track (getting in the grass or even sand/gravel traps) from what I've seen. It's pretty ridiculous, but is supposedly being worked on. How something like this gets past beta phase is just beyond me."

pcars,36ooyt,therdodoubleg,1 point,Wed May 20 23:07:24 2015 UTC,"My favorite car is probably the McLaren MP4-12C followed by the BMW Z4. Although I like almost all GT3 cars apart from maybe the Ginetta and the Mercedes which I don't really drive often.  I just feel like the McLaren, Audi and BMW just have better handling than the rest and because I'm not as experienced with Simracing I tend to do better with them. Apart from the competetive aspect where I would therefore always choose one of those 3 I like the Porsche a lot as well because it feels challenging and I love the car."
pcars,36ooyt,AndyZ88,1 point,Wed May 20 23:29:45 2015 UTC,The Mercedes GT3 SLS AMG can dominate on certain tracks. It's power can really pull gaps or close down people on straights and for a car that is notoriously heavy it handles very well. I love it.

I even had a contract offer to drive the McLaren 12C GT3, after winning the Formula Rookie championship.. I chose to continue in Formula Gulf.. I'm gonna push for Formula A glory, LMP1 and after that I might give the GT3 a shot.  McLaren 12C and the RUF look good to me."

And to then manage to completely botch everything about the final stop.   It was certainly frustrating at the time, but I thought about all of the race teams around the world in NASCAR, IndyCar, F1, etc. that these types of things actually happen to.   I cannot imagine their frustration of running a great race and being in contention for a win, only to have one guy drop a lug nut and destroy the efforts of an entire weekend.

pcars,36k31j,chicken_and_ham,3,Wed May 20 14:42:02 2015 UTC,I did try that but it only saved me about .1 a lap in the Audi. It would be worth running a practice lap at full blast and then at fuel conservation speed to see the difference. Maybe I was still pushing too hard even for that.

I had set the tires to automatic by weather, since the game never lets you choose the right tires if the weather changes between qualifying and the race, and the combination of overcast skies and the long lap left me skittish.  So I probably have hard slicks on, for a sprint race, and I'm starting mid-pack.  Dropping the clutch on start is such an underrated move, and it's really something everyone should be doing.  It got me up to 4th out of 18.  I move up when one of the early leaders spin, and it's a hell of a battle.  I know that, with the trick high speed post-karrusel section, I could probably get a good 2-3 place finish, especially with tall gearing for the final straight.  I spun out at the karrusel.  Took me forever to fall asleep because of the adrenaline."

pcars,36m1qo,grzzzly,3,Wed May 20 11:26:03 2015 UTC,"This is just me, your mileage may vary. For most cars i take out .05 - .1 bar out of every tire, add a little camber, -.2 - -.5 (to the negative), add some toe in -.5 (again to the negative). Then i go out on track and see how she runs. If im not hitting top of final gear, i adjust my final drive in gear ratio accordingly. If i go more accel on final drive and am hitting the red line, i go back in and add some downforce to make up for it so i can corner better, and hit the top of the gear, or i go the other way and bring the final drive back to where it was to hit the top of the final gear. Finally after i get a few laps down i check how much fuel im using per lap, and adjust accordingly for the race, adding a few liters for a spin out or something like that.  This is just my go to start on any car at the moment. I might be completely wrong in what I do but it seems to be working for me."
pcars,36m1qo,modonaut,2,Wed May 20 11:37:19 2015 UTC,"First thing to look at is tire pressure. Check the telemetry once the tires are warm and make sure the pressure is in the proper range. This varies in different types of cars, though, so try googling it to see where the pros like it. A typical road car likes ~32 psi (~2.2 bar). The formula rookie car requires ~20 psi. Etc.  I always end up increasing negative camber. You nearly always want more neg camber on the front than the back. You want the inside portion of the tires to be a little hotter than the outside portion, but not by a significant amount. ~10 degrees difference is usually pretty safe.  I adjust the final drive ratio of the gearbox to suit the track. Increase it if you are hitting the rev limiter before the end of the longest straight; decrease it if you are not reaching top gear on the long straight.  I use sway bars to adjust oversteer or understeer. Trying to do it by tuning the springs or dampers takes advanced expertise, so I only attempt to do that if totally necessary.  Those four things are where I start. If I still don't like the car I start fine tuning springs, dampers, differentials, etc.  Edit: I may have used increase and decrease inaccurately when describing final drive ratio. The slider has ""acceleration"" at one end and ""speed"" at the other. When I say ""increase"" I mean move it towards the speed end of the slider."

pcars,36m1qo,Fred_Zeppelin,2,Wed May 20 21:24:21 2015 UTC,Awesome. Glad to help. Tuning is fun when you start to figure out what everything does and how it can help you.
pcars,36m1qo,CoconutDust,2,Thu May 21 01:07:40 2015 UTC,"It took me lots and lots of reading and practice to build up my knowledge of tuning.  Let me first mention one of the most direct and straightforward and quantifiable aspects of tuning:  CAMBER  Your telemetry tells you exactly how to change your camber.   View your tire temperature. Take some turns, drive hard, corner like you mean it, take both left/right turns, but do not drift (it's *preferable if you get a small amount of tire screech skidding sound effect, you should always be cornering at about 5% slip) If the inside of the tire is hotter, then you are not getting enough action on the outside of the tire. Decrease negative camber.  This will tilt the tire so that more rubber on the outside stays in contact with the pavement. If the outside of the tire is hotter than the inside by more than a few degrees, increase negative camber slightly.  This will tilt the top of the tire toward the inside of the car, and create more tire contact with the road.   DIFFERENTIAL  Read my take on differentials  GEARING  Read my Gear Tuning method.  Note that my method is not the common ""Tune your gears based on the turns/straights"", so your mileage may vary.  Personally, I'm more into street racing setups.  ANTIROLL BARS  Stiffening your roll bars means reducing body roll (which can mean more traction), but they also work against the natural function of your springs (which means less traction).  You should really experiment with softer/tighter to find a sweet spot where the car feels stable while taking hard turns.  Generally speaking:  softening your AR will give more grip at that end of the car; tighten an ARB to give more grip at the other end.  But you must experiment.  SPRINGS & WEIGHT DISTRIBUTION  Springs affect weight distribution.  Weight distribution affects whether the car can turn properly or not turn, or spin out.  ""OVERSTEER"": If you brake smoothly and try to take a corner, but your back end slides out, that means too much weight is shifting forward.  You should probably stiffen your front spring (or brake/steer more carefully), so that less weight will transfer onto the front, more will stay on the rear.   ""UNDERSTEER"": remember, your front tires are your steering tires.  If there is not enough weight on them, they cannot catch grip, and the car will not turn.  You try to turn, but nothing happens, and you plow right off the road.  Your back tires are your ""Stay Straight & Stable"" tires:  if there's not enough weight on them, the back end will slide out.  I suggest trying to find good spring balance before setting dampers.  Stiffening springs mean less weight transfer onto that end.  Many people recommend ""maximize your spring travel without bottoming out"".  I disagree with that.  You don't score points for ""utilizing"" the whole range of your spring travel.  What matters is optimizing the balance and stability and responsiveness of the car.  Now that you understand weight distribution, you will realize that raising one end of the car will reduce weight and grip at that end.  Lowering the front or rear will mean more weight and grip there.  So you can try to fiddle with Ride Height if needed.  LESS IMPORTANT STUFF...  Dampers affect the speed of weight transfer on the springs.  When the springs compress or expand, soft dampers will make it happen quickly, stiff dampers will make it happen slowly.  If you find that bumps/ridges in the pavement are making you lose contact, you should soften your dampers.  This will mean your wheels will spring in (bump) & out (rebound) more quickly, so they'll remain in contact better with bumpy bup-bup-bup patches of road.   It might also happen that you want to ""prolong"" weight transfer on the front or rear at corner entry or exit…..you can attempt this with stiffer (""slower"") rebound (at that end).  ""Rebound"" means:  fling weight off this side of the car!.  AERO only matters for high-speed cornering.  Sweeping corners where you are able to maintain high speed.  Years ago I made the mistake of adding rear aero because I was spinning my rear tires while accelerating in a straight line.  That was wrong.  Just keep in mind while tuning suspension and differential, you need to always consider whether the problem is with your throttle/brake/steering control.  Sloppy braking, throttle, and steering (sloppy as opposed to smooth) can cause loss of grip.  It's not always the suspension's fault.  Note:  I'm really speaking about Forza, because Project Cars is unplayable for me [on controller] until the patch comes out."
pcars,36m1qo,fli096,2,Wed May 20 21:06:22 2015 UTC,"Gear box adjusting is where I begin. A good gear ratio should just hit the red line at the end of the longest straight and go down into first gear in the slowest corner. Try new setups with just a few litres of fuel and push as hard as you can.   After 2 or 3 laps I then adjust downforce depending on the track. Many, slower corners means more downforce, long straights and fast corners mean less downforce.  Tire pressure depends on the car, a formula car generally wants less pressure than road cars. Normally I check as soon as my tires are warm how much pressure they got and then adjust later on.  I did also bind brake balance to my wheel so I can adjust for every corner, some tracks are almost impossible without changing brake balance on the go.   Fuel is important as well. You should have enough fuel for x+2 laps in the race and also practice with this additional weight."
pcars,36m1qo,KP_Wolf,1 point,Wed May 20 22:28:51 2015 UTC,I think that your idea in regards to the differential tuning is more geared towards a forza point of view.   It's important to keep in mind that with damage on the engine can blow up and constantly being in the upper range of the revs can cause damage to your drivetrain in project cars. I've seen lots of complaints about people leading races and loosing on the last lap because their engine blew.   I've had success with being more conservative and tuning the FD to be a bit longer than just banging red line on the longest straight.

pcars,36nqa2,ozurdin,1 point,Wed May 20 19:15:31 2015 UTC,im on pc and ive only gotten mine to green and i was playing around doing burnouts and donuts in the lycan. applying light braking. i got the achieve for getting brake temps above 1000c and my tires were still green  edit: i also did only have visual dmg on. im pretty sure with full you can get blowouts and flat tires. i know in wrecks the F1s can loose the wheel completely
pcars,36nqa2,Jaggy_,1 point,Wed May 20 19:22:57 2015 UTC,"While we're on the subject, is there way to tell how much your tires have lost grip? Like for endurance races, how would you know that now is the time to change them? Does it show on the screen or do you just have to feel the car losing handling and know now is the time?"
pcars,36nqa2,ozurdin,1 point,Wed May 20 19:03:11 2015 UTC,yea idk i guess when they just start slipping too much. one of the other comments said red was overheating that might not always mean its wearing out idk. the most ive drivin so far in about 3 lap races on the ring in Formula a and it stayed at green. and i was pushin it. i think my tire wear is on slow tho
pcars,36nqa2,SGNick,1 point,Wed May 20 19:30:21 2015 UTC,"The telemetry window shows tire wear, but in my opinion the tires feel like they've gone off FAR before the tire turns red.   There's an app for the PC version that does a better job of telling you. It certainly should be in the core game."

Once steam is in admin mode try to launch pCars a couple of times to see if the preparing to launch issue disappears.

pcars,36nlcc,simondoc,1 point,Wed May 20 20:19:40 2015 UTC,Done both of those too but it's still not working properly :( I think it's to do with the error causing the 64 bit version to break but I have no idea how to fix it.

pcars,36njq1,modonaut,1 point,Wed May 20 19:22:03 2015 UTC,No not at all. Might have been the water temp but not all cars have a visible water temp gauge and the track was rather quick (Watkins glen) and rad was at 50% so I can't really see it overheating.

Primarily due to the other forms of racing having much tighter restrictions in what can be mechanically done to the car.   F1 cars are typically bleeding edge technology that 75% of the field can't afford to perfect to be competitive, let alone reliable."

And if it is the temp, people need to realize that this is part simulator. They calculate a lot more than you think, and the dash is not there to look pretty, it actually functions and gives you very useful data on your car."

Welcome to motorsport.  Good luick with the rest of your carrer.  Tip:Disable restarts. Sucks to come off, sucks to get hit off. This is racing. If you keep over doing it and ruining your race,stop restarting and learn from your mistakes.  Seriously, its not a stab at you. Learn adapt enjoy"
pcars,36njq1,exingit,1 point,Thu May 21 10:57:58 2015 UTC,"If you take aero damage your water and oil temp will rise to a pint where you will take engine damage. Temps need to cool off before you stop taking damage, even if you got your car fixed in the pit.  The slightest contact will close your radiator and kill your engines a few laps later...  You can use pcars profiler to log telemetry data, I set up gauges for oil and water temp."

He wasn't complaining about losing positions to pitting, he was able to regain those positions...  And while yes, there is always a chance of failure, it is a bit ridiculous right now.

If they did, they would never be able to keep themself in the field because they would be slow as fuck then. They are utterly fearless when they get their helmets on.  And GT4 is 10 years+ old, not even a simulator, of course the cars goes way faster there. In PCars you need to drive really fast in order to be just as good as fast as IRL. Try to drive an Audi R18 on La Sarthe. Can you get it down below 3:30? Because thats what they do IRL, but you are probably gonna find yourself in 3:40 or slower in the game."

Is this something even to be fixed, or is this something devs can't do anything about since they are done making it?   Yes, they said there's a patch on the way.  We don't know when, unfortunately.  I also fear it won't be adequate for the gross amount of performance loss on One.  They said they expect something like 4% to 7% performance improvement on One, but I believe I've seen frame rates well below 30 FPS.  Even if we get like a 7% increase, if it drops to like 18 FPS, does that 7% improvement mean we instead see it dip to 19 FPS?  If so, that doesn't help much.  To be honest, saying it dips into the upper teens is probably a conservative guess.  I'm pretty sure I've seen single digits at certain moments."

It has a but of a climb in it as well.   You could try spa too, but it is an F1 track so I'm not sure other cars have the acceleration (or downforce) necessary to make it up to top speed. You need downforce to carry speed through some of the turns."
pcars,36lem4,CannedEther,1 point,Wed May 20 07:33:00 2015 UTC,"The main cars I wanted to reach top speed with are the McLaren F1 & P1, and the Pagani Zonda. Do they have enough downforce?"

pcars,36lem4,mav3r1ck92691,1 point,Wed May 20 08:21:10 2015 UTC,"Road cars are unlikely to get you too fast through the final curve before a long straight..  Take Monza for example, the fastest F1 track. A F1 car reaches 340-360km/h on the straight, but they get out of Parabolica at around 180km/h, even though they are set up for top speed and less downforce.  Circuit the Catalunya has a long straight too, over 1km, but it's still shorter than Monza and it has a tight curve before it, unlike the Parabolica, so you won't get on the straight at a very high speed.  Other than Nordschleife's straight (2.1km), you can also try the straight on Le Mans, it's divided into 3 portions of about 2km each.."

pcars,36igmo,FranktheShank1,3,Tue May 19 19:46:38 2015 UTC,Easiest way is to figure out what speed is optimal for the car you're driving and just hit the beginning of the carousel at that speed and coast right on through.  The first is a lot harder than the second one but once you know the speed/gear it should be easy.
pcars,36igmo,JoeyDJQ,3,Tue May 19 20:08:00 2015 UTC,It''s mainly in the few GT cars I'v tried where any correction on the first one spins me out from lack of traction. I'm working on cruising through there without having to correct.
pcars,36igmo,FranktheShank1,2,Tue May 19 20:10:51 2015 UTC,I would have jumped into the carousel but I'm sitting too damn low to the ground :(

pcars,36l0xq,morchi83,1 point,Thu May 21 04:01:55 2015 UTC,"I have it for 6 months now, and played various of games with it, including F1 2014, Grid 2 etc. (GTA V also, after emulating it as xbox controller).  it feels real good and rigid, the FFB is awesome when set up right (like in pcars when going onto the sand, the FFB gives you the feeling of really going off road).  as others can say, it's really worth your money, and if you're feeling creative you can modify it (change the springs on the pedals for more simulated feeling, change the wheel).  TLDR: i recommend it!"

pcars,36j90u,KniteMonkey,0,Wed May 20 01:42:59 2015 UTC,That's what is strange about this game. Bugs are not consistent. Some experience issues. Others don't.

pcars,36idoh,kennyuk77,5,Tue May 19 17:33:26 2015 UTC,Should be DQ from the race.
pcars,36idoh,EyeLuvPC,2,Tue May 19 18:03:40 2015 UTC,"Indeed the game should have a better penalty system. It should have detected both the incoming car (it normally does with blue flag system) seen that the offending car was reversing on track (illegal under race conditions), detected the crash then given the offending player a black flag and removed him from the race.   Result, the idiots that disregards the rules will quickly learn not to re enter the track dangerously and race within the proper sporting code of conduct.  Online isn't that much fun tbh, and it wont be long before players tire of waiting for the many things needed to make the experience way better for MP."

Best I've found is to set the slider to 1L ABOVE what I currently have (so if you have 21L, set the slider to 22L). That way it will only put in 1L, and not waste too much time. I first discovered the ''No refueling actually refills your whole tank'' thing during an endurance race. Not fun."
pcars,36hk26,sigurd07,1 point,Tue May 19 13:07:15 2015 UTC,"I'd be interested to know your control setup. I have a hard time on this track with the DS4, particularly with turning in too late because of the input lag. You don't seem to be having this problem."
pcars,36hk26,Hekik,2,Tue May 19 15:47:41 2015 UTC,"I use this. Make these changes to controller input mode 3  Steering deadzone = 10  Steering sensitivity = 0  Throttle deadzone = 10  Throttle sensitivity = 20  Brake deadzone = 10  Brake sensitivity = 20  Speed sensitivity = 65  Control filtering sensitivity = 50  Advanced settings = off  In addition to this for Monaco I also (porsche gt3) change the steering ratio in the tuning options to 10.5 to 1  (don't quote me on those numbers but I think that's what I have it on.  With any car though I would just make the steering ratio ""faster.""  This helps with the hairpin and the roundabout.  I also loosen up the differential a bit as well but nothing drastic."

pcars,36kq9h,FlyByNightt,3,Wed May 20 02:32:02 2015 UTC,"Do you mean coming out of the hill at Bathurst or do you mean the L turn after the hill before the straight into the final left hand corner?  Bathurst is odd in that it's a slick track and it's got killer up and down elevation, making it probably the steepest track in parts turn wise except for Monaco and the Willowspring short track.  My big suggestion is to brake a bit earlier, but come onto the brake smooth. It's slower than braking normally but a gradual application of brake solved all my spin issues in those corners."

pcars,36kq9h,Cheesenium,3,Wed May 20 02:50:08 2015 UTC,"Generally, going down the hill on Bathrust, it is generally better to keep your gears at Gear 2(maybe Gear 3) then, let the car roll down the hill with little acceleration while turning your steering. If I am not wrong, that is how professional V8 Supercars drivers drive on that section.  It will take you some practise to get used to the track as I think it is a pretty tough track after they redo the incorrect version in Shift 2 that is too wide. The current one is as narrow as the real track which made it a lot harder.  Bathrust also has another name known as Wahluu that means ""young man's initiation place"" in the local Aboriginals language."
pcars,36kq9h,TerranFirma,1 point,Wed May 20 03:15:51 2015 UTC,"Yeah when turning on a downhill your car wants to slide downward, spinning you out. So you just have to brake more smoothly and turn in with some power on to fight gravity. It's a bit tricky.  You'll get it after a few goes."
pcars,36kq9h,downunder_plunderer,1 point,Wed May 20 06:00:45 2015 UTC,To add on to what TerraFirma said I split it up into two braking zones. I brake a little before the right hand kink and then brake moderately hard once it the wheels are straightened up.

FWIW I've been doing formula rookie (and loving it..race cars with no power are so much fun) with no issues, but I'm on PC with a G27, manual everything.  Do you guys have traction control and stability control off?  Wonder if that could be causing an issue somehow.  Just more computer control over the car?"

pcars,36i2b2,Fred_Zeppelin,1 point,Tue May 19 17:45:49 2015 UTC,"Map it to a bumper or button?  Might not be ideal but would see if the auto-clutch is what's causing the problem.  Don't have to win races with it and it might not work perfectly but should be enough to do some testing and see if the problem persists.  You'll have some trouble with the instant clutch engagement of a button or upper trigger (those are at least a little progressive, right) but it should mostly work.  When I am shifting gears with the clutch pedal and H-pattern shifter I am going so fast on them that it's basically a button press for the clutch."
pcars,36i2b2,TheCrudMan,1 point,Tue May 19 18:03:13 2015 UTC,Auto-clutch is my only assist. I have all other assists off. It could definitely be an auto-clutch bug. I posted on the official forums about it.  Edit: agreed about Formula rookie. It's a really fun car to race.

So felt good.  Was so much fun.  The car is so steerable with the throttle and doesn't have enough power to require super ginger inputs.  You can lift mid corner to get the car to turn in more without spinning it.  So much fun.  I track a Miata in real life (not race, though) and so I like a car that you can toss around a bit and have to carry some momentum around with.   Have to really throw it into corners and bleed of a little speed that way because slow-in fast-out only works when you've got power to put down with the grip you gained by being slow."

Happens when i'm downshifiting sometimes as well.  This is really annoying. I'm loving the game, but almost every race i got one of these. It's unplayable at this point.

pcars,36g4re,HEF51,4,Tue May 19 15:32:21 2015 UTC,"You will find you drive better with an FOV around 60.  You are looking through a much smaller ""window"" using a monitor.  It may make peripheral vision harder, but you can see braking points and such much better.  What you should go for is the wheel being about 1:1 to a real wheel, from where you are sitting.  This will make what you see on the track much more accurate and sharper.    Driving zoomed out (100 FOV) makes everything smaller and harder to see.  It takes some getting used to, but you should give it a shot.  iRacing has an awesome calculator built in that takes into account your monitor size, distance from your monitor to your eyes, and a couple other factors to give you a recommended FOV."
pcars,36g4re,Rudee66,1 point,Tue May 19 15:52:36 2015 UTC,"I've used the wheel size for reference as too, the hud wheel is turned off and I use the seat position buttons to adjust fov until my t300rs looks proportionate to the dash..seems to work well for me, the wider fov makes the car's front end feel too far away."

I'm assuming a GTX 970 can only do around 50-60fps for 3 monitors @ 1080p x3, and since these monitors will be dedicated to this rig I was thinking a 60hz would be good enough."
pcars,36jq4q,doctaj5,2,Tue May 19 22:34:52 2015 UTC,"Most 144hz monitors are 24"". Will sales you can see them down to $180 but usually around $200 on sale. Even with a 290 and terrible performance in this game I get more than 60 fps. the 970 should be able to get about 100fps with setting turned down. Other racing games are easy to drive at over 144fps with a 970. You will also have the benefit of fast monitors if you play other games such as first person shooters.  Edit: the fps was for triple monitor."
pcars,36jq4q,p4rtch1mp,1 point,Tue May 19 22:45:59 2015 UTC,Thanks. I'm thinking a 24'' might be too small for this setup. I saw other setups on youtube where it was actually too big (46''+). I'm not going to use these monitors for other gaming. I might look at spending more for a 144hz at 27'' or higher. I was always bad at seeing the difference in fps so I need to weigh the pros and cons a bit
pcars,36jq4q,p3dr0maz,1 point,Tue May 19 22:55:08 2015 UTC,"I would consider getting a rift. They are $350. Take that $250 savings, but a cheapo single monitor off craigslist, since you seem to have some luck on there, and jump up to a gtx 980 or one of the new ati cards coming out.

pcars,36jfph,Drunken_Mouse,1 point,Tue May 19 22:30:01 2015 UTC,Good thinking. I guess I'll stick to one I know at first. Find the right balance on different cars and enjoy it and get to know the characteristics.

pcars,36jdj3,SekondaH,1 point,Fri Jul 10 20:08:36 2015 UTC,"Regarding your Ferrari 458 Italia.  We begin by thanking you for your interest in Thrustmaster products.  We would like to inform you that in Windows Vista and Windows 7, the drivers are pre-installed (the wheel is therefore already Plug & Play).  However, sometimes the Operating System fails to recognize the device. In order to solve this issue, you will need to force install the drivers, as a workaround solution.  For that, you first need to access your computer's Device Manager.  Once in the Device Manager, identify the wheel (it is usually displayed with a yellow exclamation mark on its side), right click on it and select ""Update driver software"".  Next, select Browse My computer for Driver Software > Let Me Pick from a List of Drivers  Now 2 situations can occur (please check the two attached screenshots):   A window appears giving you the choice to 2 different Xbox 360 drivers (one from 2009, the other one from 2006). If this is the case, select the one from 2006 and proceed to the installation, while ignoring any Windows warnings. A window appears giving you a list of hardware manufacturers. If this is the case, select ""Microsoft"" as manufacturer, then select ""Microsoft Common Controller for Windows Class"" in the right column, ignore any warnings and validate the driver installation.   If the wheel is seen by Windows under ""Devices and Printers"" but with a yellow exclamation mark and not seen at all under ""Game controllers"", the first thing that you need to do is to install the generic drivers from the link below:  http://www.microsoft.com/hardware/en-us/d/xbox-360-controller-for-windows  Windows 7 should already contain this driver but, in some - rather rare - cases, it can be either improperly installed or completely absent).  If the issue persists after installing this driver and testing the wheel on all available USB ports, the next step is to test the gamepad on another PC (with another OS).  Please let us know if this fix worked for you too, by replying to this email.  Thrustmaster Technical Support is at your disposal for any other information you may need. You can reach us online at the following addresses:   http://ts.thrustmaster.com/eng for the latest updates and FAQs   or by telephone at one of the numbers listed on the following page: http://ts.Thrustmaster.com/eng/index.php?pg=contact Kind regards,  Your Thrustmaster Customer Support Agent, Emma  PS: To ensure the most efficient follow-up of your query, please be sure to include the reference number [511757-1432076033] of your file in the subject line of any emails you may send us later on.

pcars,36hboh,Artie-Choke,6,Tue May 19 11:49:12 2015 UTC,"which was really too punishing being on such slippery surfaces and no fun at all because of - but the courses were a real treat to run otherwise   Keep practising then, Dirt Rally isnt the same pick up and play like Dirt 1 to 3. You need to either learn the courses if not understand how the cars behave to perform better.  I had similar issues initially but after a few failures and spectacular crashes, I do get a bit better now.  If you are not familiar with the licensed tracks in pCARS, you will go through the same punishing failures. There are a few point to point tracks though."
pcars,36hboh,Cheesenium,-4,Tue May 19 13:33:28 2015 UTC,"Casually, I've played everything from GTA-4-5 (where racing was my favorite pastime), to Dirt 3 to Wreckfest to Dirt Rally and now Pcars.  I just don't like dirt/mud/ice.  I much prefer the feeling of tires grabbing asphalt (like I'm use to in real life).  I do alright in DR, but it's just too much work to do well (and it seems to do well at all, you're drifting like crazy through the entire course while trying frantically not to launch off the road like a missile).  Pcars (what I've played so far) is much more what I expect when I get behind the wheel of a car, so that's where it's at for me...  ...just add more point to point tracks..."
pcars,36hboh,FlyByNightt,9,Tue May 19 14:33:46 2015 UTC,"Have you ever watched a rally race? Cause all they do is drift like crazy through the entire course while trying frantically to not launch of the road like a missile.  If you feel that way, Codemasters did their job right."
pcars,36hboh,itsdapoleece,3,Tue May 19 16:22:22 2015 UTC,Nurburgring Nordschleife is pretty much the king of this style of course. California Highway and Azure Coast are point to point courses and are pretty long if done in full.  Azure Circuit (aka Cote d'Azur) is a very challenging narrow city course that really sets itself apart from the standard circuit locations.  LeMans & Spa are very large high speed courses that could potentially be your fancy as well.
pcars,36hboh,Halmine,2,Tue May 19 13:29:37 2015 UTC,"If you can drive well on Nordschleife, you can pretty much drive well everywhere :P It's still one of my favourite tracks, the only issue is that I can't play it with the group I usually race with."
pcars,36hboh,itsdapoleece,1 point,Tue May 19 14:26:47 2015 UTC,"If you want a really brutal challenge, do an iron man match where you start with a full tank and no refueling, and see who can go the furthest on one tank."

pcars,36hboh,itsdapoleece,1 point,Tue May 19 16:48:53 2015 UTC,"Excellent throttle control, conservative gear ratios, and utilizing speed from declines.  If you have some smartass friends, you may also have to implement a time limit for laps so they don't just try to putt around at 25mph."
pcars,36hboh,FlyByNightt,1 point,Tue May 19 17:56:06 2015 UTC,"Okay you seem to know your stuff so can you help me out on something? (I'm not super knowledgeable in that kind of stuff) I was doing the 24h on career mode and I entered a lap with about 10/12L of fuel, and figured I'd have enough to make it around to the pits.   However, I ran out about halfway through, mostly because I had to go all out to defend the lead. What should I do (ELI5) to conserve fuel better in the future? I was using the Audi R18 TDI if it helps."
pcars,36hboh,itsdapoleece,1 point,Tue May 19 20:20:10 2015 UTC,"I'm not terribly certain on the gear ratios on Ring with LMP1, but the big thing is watching your gear in corners and not going flat out in every turn exit. You want to maintain 2nd or 3rd gear through every turn and keep a low rpm (but not so low you would damage the engine if you're using realistic damage). Ease onto the gas as you hit the apex of your turn rather than going flat out immediately. If you don't have immediate threat to your position on you and you have a series of turns without any significant length of straight between it benefits to not go full on the gas (if you're using a controller set your gas and brake dead zone to 0 to help). A lot of it will come in time just from playing and learning courses, but keeping these things in mind, especially making sure you're not going 100% gas right out of every turn and maintaining just enough throttle in gradual curves to keep a low RPM, you'll get more laps out of a full tank which is the most important part.  Hope it all makes sense since I'm half asleep from a long ass day. If you're still having trouble I can try throwing the R18 on the Ring and see what optimizations may help since I tend to prefer GT3 class for it and am less familiar with its fuel usage along the green hell."
pcars,36hboh,FlyByNightt,2,Wed May 20 02:59:31 2015 UTC,"Awesome info, thanks! I'll check my gear ratios and try to watch the RPM like you said."

pcars,36h5wb,Chandlers_a_girl,2,Tue May 19 21:25:40 2015 UTC,"I did have a some issues, but I installed the win 10 beta drivers and that fixed most of them. I also installed a win 10 partition and whoa, I literally get 75% more fps, but I have the screen blacking out issue but sound still running. So I have to stick with 8.1.   My 290x crushes the game on win 10 in 1920x1080. 150 fps on high settings. Ultra, not so much, it drops to 50. Turning the enviroment map and the grass up is what really is the fps killers. In windows 8.1 i only get about 90 with the same high settings and 35 on ultra.  In triple screens I have to drop most everything down to medium or low to to average 60fps on win10. On windows 8 with everything on low i still can't average 60.   Note, these benchmarks are all done at Oulton Park with a 20 car field with clear skies, just for consistency.   There are still some issues, but it seems to be more if you are using higher resolutions at this point. I think that is honestly just as much to do with SMS as it is ati. No native multimonitor support is my biggest gripe with this game. 4 years in dev and that doesn't exsist? Clearly they were focused more on console than pc, but thats ok. I still think it is a damn fun game. Just has a few more kinks to iron out."

I've been playing the new Dirt Rally game, and my computer runs it much better, very rarely dipping below 60FPS, never below 50, and at settings that make it look much better than I'm running pCars.

Think that family of cards with the less shaders or memory speed or ram or whatever would definitely see an improvement in FPS with some driver optimizations.    I'd like to be able to hit turn 1 without dropping from 45-55fps to 25-35fps cause there's a traffic jam.  That said the game is far from unplayable just needs a little optimization love.

The new Physx will not run on the cards and offloads the work to the CPU causing bottlenecks. So if you have a high end CPU that's overclocked you probably won't see the difference anyway.

Microsoft simply provides the hardware platform for the software to run on. It's up to the developers to get the most out of that hardware.  As long as a developer has a publisher who can really stop them from putting out the game? Once upon a time in the olden days NES carts were supposed to be approved by Nintendo and carried a seal but even then there were games released that didn't carry the seal causing some controversy.  TL:DR Microsoft can't control what developers put out.
pcars,36kw83,Ballsnasty,1 point,Wed May 20 03:56:20 2015 UTC,Isn't there a patch that is waiting on Microsoft approval right now? Something to deal with all the bugs and what not.
pcars,36kw83,fzed1199,1 point,Wed May 20 17:45:28 2015 UTC,"Um no. Each racing developer has their vision and with the limited performance that the 1 has, you have a choice of physics, visuals, fps. Forza sacrificed visuals and physics for 60fps game play. Pcars sacrificed fps for more physics, and visuals."
pcars,36kw83,modonaut,1 point,Wed May 20 06:05:06 2015 UTC,"They sacrificed on all accounts except for the physics. It runs at 900p, and was supposed to be 60fps."

pcars,36kw83,therdodoubleg,1 point,Thu May 21 03:23:22 2015 UTC,"I literally can not even dumb myself down to your logic.  So I guess the same applies to Sony and the PS4? Because I ain't seeing much of the same 'accusations' on that side of the fence.   This isn't SMS's first game. They made NFS Shift 1 & 2 and used the same tools from a decent pair of games to make Project Cars, and without EA breathing down their necks they showed how capable they are.   Have you ever considered the capable theory of maybe the Xbox One just can't run it smoothly full stop?"
pcars,36kw83,therdodoubleg,1 point,Thu May 21 08:38:39 2015 UTC,I have considered that. It's not even dumb you keep trying to position it that way. You have seen how beautiful Forza 5 was at 60 fps. It can be done I garuantee Microsoft will pull out all the stops to make sure Forza 6 looks better than Pcars. The xbox 360 was running PGR4 with weather effects and still looks beautiful.  Politics exist. Project Cars was a threat Turn 10 has had Shitty PR lately because PCARS has released  more tracks then they ever have. Have you seen Forza fb page?
pcars,36kw83,IceMan_PJN,2,Thu May 21 13:28:58 2015 UTC,"Nope but I have seen how beautiful Project Cars is at 60fps on PC. I've avoided console racing for a long time because majority of the players don't actually 'race', when I compare console racing to PC racing.. it's not even close. And that is why Forza is bound to console and only one console of that. It's target audience isn't aimed at true sim racers. It's forgiving. Project Cars is more than that and for PC gamers it's mentioned in the same breath as Assetto Corsa, rFactor, and even (Yes I kid you not) iRacing.   Honestly, most sim racers I know personally frown at the likes of Forza and Gran Turismo."
pcars,36j2tm,notaspookorgook,4,Tue May 19 19:28:21 2015 UTC,"Its all in the settings. You can make this game as easy, or as hard as you'd like. If you don't like messing with game settings, its not for you. My 2 cents."

pcars,36j2tm,I_AM_THE_LIQUEUR,1 point,Wed May 20 06:17:44 2015 UTC,"No not even remotely. Check your TV settings and if use a controller, search around here and the respective subreddit for your game system for controller settings. A lot of people are saying the game feels laugh when really it's the way the controller settings are out of the box."
pcars,36j2tm,Zachk907,1 point,Wed May 20 12:43:50 2015 UTC,"I did a quick search on Google  and there are apparently a lot of people that have lagging/frame drop issues with stuttering/laggy audio too. This doesn't seem to be controller related. It's intermittent, like having a bad Internet connection.   I might make a thread about it later if what you suggested to try doesn't work."
pcars,36j2tm,Zachk907,3,Wed May 20 13:14:15 2015 UTC,"I don't think difficult is the right word. Project cars is definitely a lot less forgiving than the forza games. If your technique for accelerating, braking, and cornering was decent in forza you'll be able to play this game. The hardest part early on for me was correcting those techniques to a more realistic way of driving.   In forza 5 the Drs was automatic and didn't really change much from the car. If you try and take the same corners with Drs open your car will lose control. Drs is manually controlled also, so figuring out when you do and don't need it will be tricky at first.   But this game is infinitely better than forza 5."

pcars,36j2tm,ramsyzool,1 point,Tue May 19 19:55:21 2015 UTC,I second this. This game is tougher than forza (on pro) and in my opinion should be played with a decent wheel and pedals.
pcars,36j2tm,TerranFirma,3,Tue May 19 22:49:17 2015 UTC,"This is my favourite racing game so far, but I was still playing ToCA 2 until very recently. Really not found it frustrating at all. I'll be getting a wheel on pay day but I've not had any problems playing with my DS4. Still very enjoyable. Even remote play via Vita, while not perfect is still manageable.   im going 120 and i feel like im going 30. it was frustating to slow down to what feels like a crawl, or else when i turn to make a corner, my car is going to act like its two front wheels are disconnected and just slide into a wall.   Going 120 in a semi-decent road car doesn't feel like you're going 120 either. That's how I managed to lose my licence for five years as a teen. You do have to really brake for your corners, but you don't accelerate around a corner anyway; you'll reduce your speed, guide your car around and nail it after the turn. It feels like a crawl because you've been hammering your straights at 120. Corners should feel slow.  That said, I've always felt that a lot console of racing games have an over inflated sense of speed. It depends what you want out of your driving game though, I've spent the last couple of sunday afternoons racing round Brands Hatch in the Focus happy as Larry. Literally all I wanted out of a racing sim."

pcars,36j2tm,grzzzly,2,Tue May 19 19:31:41 2015 UTC,I play it with a controller and am loving it.  Not too difficult to handle once you adjust the controller settings.
pcars,36j2tm,ParallelSky,2,Tue May 19 19:49:09 2015 UTC,"I have mostly played Grid 2 before this, and I am loving Pcars. I started with assists and race line on, and that wasn't too hard if you take an easy car.   After about 10 hours on medium difficulty I turned off all assists, and now it has taken me a couple of frustrating evenings to get the basic hang of things. I'm at 12 hours and just did my first Community Challenge (granted, it's an easy one).  It's a difficult game on medium difficulty without assists if you have little experience, but it's manageable. And super satisfying when you pull off a great lap after spending an hour figuring out how to do it.  PS: If you're playing controller like me, definitely google for the best controller settings. That makes a huuuuge difference to how much you'll enjoy the game.  Try bonnet view if you lack the sense of speed in the cockpit. To me, the game feels plenty fast."

pcars,36j2tm,Knerrjor,2,Wed May 20 02:36:16 2015 UTC,"I'm using these, and they work great for me. They make the car way less twitchy on the straights, and give you good control over the accelerator and allow you to gently squeeze the brake. In the tuning settings, there is also the steering ratio, that I always adjust down to about 9, which means your controller has a more similar range to a wheel.  Steering dead zone: 0 Steering Sensitivity: 30  Throttle dead zone: 0 Throttle Sensitivity: 50  Brake dead zone: 0 Brake Sensitivity: 30  Clutch dead zone: 0 Clutch Sensitivity: 45  Speed Sensitivity: 75 Controller Filtering: 50  Force Feedback: 100  Advanced: Off"

As I can see you like most of the sim that went out on console, so this one would be an upgrade over them. It has better physic and it make you pay your mistake, but if you are committed to learn and get better you will definitely like it. After the learning curve this game will give you the gratification and that sense of satisfaction that other similar games on console can't give you"
pcars,36j2tm,MaXKiLLz,1 point,Tue May 19 22:06:13 2015 UTC,"This game is definitely as hard as you want it to be. I haven't been online, but have really enjoyed racing the AI. I play at 70% difficulty or so with a wheel and typically achieve top ten.  That said, there are allot of great cars and some will be challenging and some just handle great. But this game does leave it up to you and your choices.   I would strongly suggest renting the game first. You may find yourself bored by it quickly and then you have an answer. On the other hand you may discover a fun game that makes you want to go buy that racing wheel."

Yes, it takes a little time to get the controller (ds4) dialed in the way you like it. However the game can literally be as hard or as easy as you like it. I've raced with all assists on and it's nearly an arcade racer where you are able to accelerate and brake through corners however you want. I've raced with assists off and it is quite challenging to race and keep in mind the physics of a vehicle when entering and exiting a corner.   It's options are what make it great IMO."

I've seen near stock mustangs and vettes spit out fuel and backfire like this, and it all has to do with the tuning. If a 'stock' car is tuned (digitally, or by swapping out some parts) it may keep that 'stock' look, but is tuned to throw much more fuel/air into the motor for top speed and acceleration. I think this amount of fuel hitting the exhaust (in the game clip you uploaded) could be realistic if the car has a track tune of some sort on it. I am looking for the link now, but didn't the developers say that each car has 'race' parts built onto it? Maybe someone with more tuning experience could chime in. It does look a little fake, but it might be more realistic than you think."

How much work do you think has to be redone with every update?  I'd imagine it's quite a bit and it's probably a frustrating situation for the devs.  Do you really want to sink a lot of man-hours into supporting something that will have to be redone over and over?  How close was the promised patch?  Did the SDK update blow it up?  One thing they could do is give a little feedback though.  I would like to know what their plans are regarding the DK2 now.  Is it still something they're working on, or are they just going to put it on the 'back burner' until the consumer headsets get released?"
pcars,36hhzh,Danlance,1 point,Tue May 19 12:48:36 2015 UTC,"Original request to Thrustmaster:   In the product manual for the TX Racing Wheel, it states the following:  At product launch on Xbox One, different action buttons on the wheel will have identical features in the game. In the near future, automatically updating your games (automatic updates will be available if your console is connected to the Internet) and updating your racing wheel's firmware will enable you to remove these duplicate features and increase the number of individual buttons.  I purchased the wheel to use within project cars, but am unable to use the wheel fully as not all controller buttons are mappable.  In particular the RS click and LS click are not used - which are mappable on other console wheels (Fanatec CSR for XBOX 360 for instance) - these I expected to be mapped to the small buttons behind the wheel (currently mapped to LB and RB)  It would also be better to map the Manettino to RS Up and RS down functions - not sure if that is possible.  (of course it would be even better if all the buttons were recognized natively and were assignable in game... but I'm not sure if the Xbox one supports that)  Please can you clarify when the firmware update will be available to allow the duplicate buttons to be mapped separately... is this something which is waiting on individual game manufacturers to add support, or is it just waiting for thrustmaster to update the firmware?"

pcars,36gwdi,Ptopman,2,Tue May 19 17:59:33 2015 UTC,"Yes LMP cars are very susceptible to Aero damage that prevents air from getting to the radiators. Even 10% damage can end your race if you don't get into the pits before your water/oil gets to hot. In LMP1 your engine starts taking damage when your water temp is around 120c. A rule for all cars is to keep the water temp at 100c or lower. I try to keep them around 90-95*c.  When you come into pit, you can edit your settings. taking fuel or changing tires is your choice but the most important thing in this situation is to go over to the damage tab and make sure your aero damage fix is on yes for all of them.  like I said, bind a key or button to the Mosic LED (dash) and switch it till you see your water temp (might look like ""Water T"") and keep an eye on how much contact you have as well, your temperatures.  If you half to, go to your set up before the race and open your radiator 5-10%. During races that are mid day and/or hazy your going to want to do this by default, its its night, or raining, you can close your radiator 5-10%, but be careful and don't close it to much or you will over heat.  Opening your radiator will slow you down a bit because it creates more drag, while opening it allows your to go faster at the cost of heat.  If you have any more questions, don't hesitate to ask."

Once you get it set up for one car you not only have to play with main control settings but also individual car settings when driving (or attempting to) drive another car. Here's to seriously hoping a patch helps this game.

I've been contemplating getting a force feedback wheel for it hoping that it will improve playability (but in true amazon fashion they stuck the price of the wheel up by £90 last night so i shan't be buying one now), lets just hope they patch the issues soon! I think the 3 main things that need to improve are: as said the issue with direction change, the horribly glitchy audio and the runoff curbs, I mean yes they should be slightly less grippy than the track itself but currently they are like driving on ice!"
pcars,36hxci,SandyBunker,1 point,Tue May 19 17:02:29 2015 UTC,"Yes and it's part setup and part controller issue.  Hopefully a patch will correct this in the near future.  I have found that if you are off the throttle in a chicane, that the steering responds better in a tight back and forth type turn.   It seems to be a sensitivity issue, that can't completely be adjusted out.  It has gotten better on the PC version after last weeks patch. I also have the Xbox One version, and it's not drivable at this point. I have not turned on the Xbox One after the first hour of trying to fix the steering issues.   Frustrating & hopefully they'll fix it soon."

pcars,36favh,tjb1,2,Thu May 21 00:26:14 2015 UTC,Sold my Oculus Rift and G27 to get the T300RS and I can tell you it's a much better wheel than the G27.  No deadzone and the ffb is much smoother; the pedals are another story...  I've been using it on Project Cars and Dirt Rally so far and it's been great.  I plan on using it with iRacing soon.

pcars,36favh,tjb1,2,Tue May 19 12:00:51 2015 UTC,"Actually yes I purchased it for racing games, the resolution is far too low for anything high speed.  The future of the DK2 also seems quite limited since it is now quite old in terms of technology in the VR area and with all the consumer versions coming out within the next year I don't see it having much of a future in games either.  Really guessing you have never used or owned one, they aren't all that great currently.  It requires a fairly decent computer to run, setup is a pain switching between direct and extended mode, Windows doesn't play nice with different refresh rates, resolution is very low (braking points and turns are only a few pixels and quite blurry), and finally you get motion sickness quite fast if you can't hold the 90hz refresh rate.  Yes I bought it only for racing games.  Why you ask? It's cheaper than 3 monitors, takes up far less space and will be much better than monitors once the resolution gets to a point where you can see objects in the distance."
pcars,36favh,billythemule,1 point,Tue May 19 12:15:15 2015 UTC,"I wanted the T300RS over the G27 but it would have cost me 3-4x as much because I would need to import it myself (also that's the version without a manual shifter). I watched the reviews. It's a good wheel for sure but I couldn't justify spending so much on it, especially when I'm new into simulators."

No, at least not in the quick tests i ran..  One of the tests: I tried a Quick Race weekend with the McLaren P1 in heavy rain on Barcelona, with 29 opponents while starting first. I use the outside follow camera and i continue driving up to the first corner, then i let go of my wheel and wait a couple of seconds till the entire field has gone by.  The system i'm using has a Intel i5-4460 with a Gigabyte R9 290 Windforce OC GPU, unlocked to a R9 290X OC. On Catalyst 15.4 i got an average of 27fps in the test i ran which is pretty bad in my opinion. Using the new 15.5 Beta drivers i get a performance gain with average FPS climbing to 35.  So yeah, there is a noticeable gain, but it isn't that huge. It should be noted that under 15.4 my FPS in my testrun dropped beneath 24 sometimes, while under 15.5 it never dropped under 30."

You have to do just a few minor car tweaks/tuning and run really good clean laps to qualify well.   The control settings I found to work really well are:  *Steering deadzone = 10 *steering sensitivty = 0 *Throttle deadzone = 10 *Throttle sensitivity = 20 *Brake deadzone = 10 *Brake sensitivity = 20 *Speed sensitivity = 65 *Control filtering sensitivity = 50 *Force feedback = 100 *Advanced settings off   I play with all assists on just because it's too hard with them off and playing with the controller.

pcars,36hegh,OiNinja-,0,Tue May 19 16:11:39 2015 UTC,You Would be correct
pcars,36ep4e,Fred_Zeppelin,6,Mon May 18 20:22:59 2015 UTC,"i usually just go out first cuz i dont feel like waiting...  and as long as your not horrible, the AI doesnt ram you  if you just press drive right when it loads up, you get to go out first and dont have to wait a minute"
pcars,36ep4e,coolkid32901,3,Mon May 18 21:56:19 2015 UTC,"This is good advice that I don't see mentioned very often. I do this online as well, especially in qualifying. Hit me in the back during a race? Yeah I'm going to rage but at least I can understand WHY these people do it. Because they suck and it's the only way for them to win. But hit me in the back during qualifying?! That makes no sense; just run your laps and don't bother me. It isn't do you any favors.   /rant"
pcars,36ep4e,andys189,2,Mon May 18 20:31:05 2015 UTC,I never been rammed but I've had a he'll of a time on cold tires. I took the Ariel mugen out at Bathurst and in a 10 min practice session never got the tires close to green. Meanwhile the whole time I'm slip siding away the ai have warm tires.
pcars,36ep4e,keeb119,2,Mon May 18 23:17:54 2015 UTC,Jesus I thought I was the only one experiencing this! The rest of the game is so perfect but this just ruins the immersion for me :/ I hope they change it sometime..
pcars,36ep4e,cubbyad,1 point,Tue May 19 03:56:54 2015 UTC,I just go whenever. They have my really knocked me off the track too much. It's mostly my fault when I spill off
pcars,36ep4e,wolfenburg,1 point,Tue May 19 04:47:03 2015 UTC,I knew someone would open their big mouth and give this away! This is the way to do it for online too btw.
pcars,36djtr,linkinstreet,16,Mon May 18 15:12:49 2015 UTC,Yeah it seems as though thousands of people mistook this for Mario kart when they purchased it
pcars,36djtr,TheJewbacca,10,Mon May 18 16:48:53 2015 UTC,Most people in MK8 race way cleaner than this.
pcars,36djtr,Tex-Rob,8,Mon May 18 19:00:02 2015 UTC,Reminds me more of GTA 5 Online Racing
pcars,36djtr,wmurray003,2,Mon May 18 23:09:46 2015 UTC,....exactly.
pcars,36djtr,chimpyman,15,Tue May 19 04:00:12 2015 UTC,people act like this is different then other games. every single racing game is exactly like this besides iracing. want to know why? it has nothing at all do to about their safety rules or crap.   its because its hard and costs so much. unless u want pcars to have a subscription it will be the same as every other racing sim out there.   set a good qualifier is your only chance in open public lobbies.
pcars,36djtr,Tex-Rob,3,Mon May 18 18:41:42 2015 UTC,"It's unfortunate, because while I love iRacing, I like some of the cars, tracks, weather, and dynamic tracks in PCars and other games."
pcars,36djtr,VR46,5,Mon May 18 19:01:42 2015 UTC,"Make friends, get a decent sized group of clear drivers, private matches are where you should be aiming friend.  If you're on PC send me a steam request, I have a good group of clear riders that race daily.    Also are you from Texas?  I'm down in Houston."
pcars,36djtr,Tex-Rob,1 point,Mon May 18 19:13:02 2015 UTC,"I was, in Austin, grew up in North Houston.  Been in NC since 2007 though, just a log standing ""handle""/username.  Yeah, I've met some good people on PCars, TRC guys and such seem competitive and clean.  I am pretty big into iRacing, so I don't really want to dedicate a lot of time to PCars, but I'll shoot you an invite.  Also, big VR fan too."
pcars,36djtr,chimpyman,1 point,Mon May 18 19:36:16 2015 UTC,I mean you can easily have that in pcars. Join a league and some community group that take driving sims seriously  It's just public lobbies are lobbies in any game. Always a mess. But I don't mind normally. Just aim to do well in qualifiers
pcars,36djtr,Kilcarnup,1 point,Mon May 18 20:14:12 2015 UTC,I'm not so sure about that. MX-5 cup has plenty of numpties and rookie oval racing is even worse :p
pcars,36djtr,fzed1199,1 point,Tue May 19 08:27:07 2015 UTC,Dedicated servers with an active admin fixes this.
pcars,36djtr,BigJAnder,6,Tue May 19 07:16:15 2015 UTC,Seems about right.
pcars,36djtr,conspiracylizard,6,Mon May 18 15:30:55 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately, this is far too common in public hosted races in any sim really.  I'm trying to start a casual racing club @ /r/redditracing if anyone is interested in a bit more controlled and cleaner racing"
pcars,36djtr,G2Wolf,4,Mon May 18 16:54:36 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately, this is far too common in public hosted races in any racing game really.    FTFY"
pcars,36djtr,Freddy216b,2,Mon May 18 17:05:23 2015 UTC,"Yeah, not sims necessarily. If a crash happens in iRacing, it's usually someone made a mistake and wasn't trying to take you out because they are a child. But in a game like Forza which I used to play a lot it was the case that if you were ahead of someone into the first corner then you'd be their brakes."
pcars,36djtr,Hemides,3,Mon May 18 17:40:59 2015 UTC,"iRacing is really good at catching people doing it on purpose, though. Hopefully PCars gets better/fixes their license system soon. (After the more important issues, of course.)"
pcars,36djtr,Monkaaay,6,Mon May 18 18:01:04 2015 UTC,"This is why everyone with even a little interest in online racing should join a league.  The league I'm involved in had a pick up race last night (first pcars season is still a few weeks off probably), ran 40 laps, and had a pretty clean race.  There will always be a few incidents here or there, but nothing like what you experience in the open lobbies.  We sent 11 cars into the first turn (a 90 degree left hander) with no issues."
pcars,36djtr,Firebomb80,5,Mon May 18 17:23:57 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry at 1:05 into the video I busted out laughing , you seem legit and just keep getting rammed , I'm not laughing to be mean I'm laughing because that happens all the time to me.  It's so hard to find legit racers lol"
pcars,36djtr,pouncer11,1 point,Mon May 18 19:04:28 2015 UTC,"Getting on at like 2am seems to be okay for me, but a couple times it seemed like people were just ramming me for fun."
pcars,36djtr,quadrospazzed88,3,Mon May 18 20:18:25 2015 UTC,It helps to join a race with a qualifying period so you can qualify up to the top 5 or so.
pcars,36djtr,hindey19,7,Mon May 18 16:50:13 2015 UTC,Doesn't help when it's the asshats behind you that run you down in the corners.
pcars,36djtr,Roedrik,3,Mon May 18 18:48:53 2015 UTC,"Join games with a qualifying portion. It helps so much. You can qualify/tune for 5-10 minutes, then the bad people leave because they wanted to race immediately instead of actually learn how to play. Of the 16 people in the lobby, the 10 remaining will be good racers and you can put yourself higher up the grid so you deal with less traffic."
pcars,36djtr,kfo86,3,Mon May 18 19:46:52 2015 UTC,I seem to get the good lobbies only one or two people griefing most races.  Race from earlier today.
pcars,36djtr,kfo86,2,Mon May 18 22:39:20 2015 UTC,"that's every single race for me that I tried online.  if It ain't right off the grid or first corner It's bound to be the next turn.  I'm sure that whole race feedback system is bugged like 80% of the other stuff in this game though...    just wait.. these ""pro racers"" will come in soon and tell you how it was all your fault but I feel your pain.. It's discouraging and takes away from the experience."
pcars,36djtr,Mr_Pigeon,0,Mon May 18 16:20:24 2015 UTC,No worries man. I actually find this funny. If you see what I was doing was holding back and still I got spun out
pcars,36djtr,cuntalist,2,Mon May 18 16:28:52 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I hold back..hell Ill give people the whole track to pass me on if I see them coming up on me pretty hard If I can't keep pace.    I bet you can't guess what happen next. lol"
pcars,36djtr,Freddy216b,2,Mon May 18 16:34:24 2015 UTC,Exhibit 1: ARCA braking
pcars,36djtr,NorcalHPDE,1 point,Mon May 18 20:07:59 2015 UTC,My favourite bit is at around 22 seconds with the Orange McLaren
pcars,36djtr,BartyB,0,Mon May 18 16:06:07 2015 UTC,If you notice that McLaren has a grudge on me since the first corner up to the hairpin where he took me out
pcars,36djtr,todayicommented,2,Mon May 18 16:29:19 2015 UTC,He was even riding the brakes coming out of turn 3 to let you get passed so he could do exactly that! Why do people play this game online if they can't race for shit?
pcars,36djtr,lovemaker69,3,Mon May 18 17:37:23 2015 UTC,"Well the motto for taking corners is ""super fast in, super fast out"" right???"
pcars,36djtr,todayicommented,1 point,Mon May 18 18:21:49 2015 UTC,"isn't there a system in place where if you are a aggressive driver and you smack into people purposely then you get points added to your ""license"" and you only get matched up with other people who have just as many points? So then the people who play clean and do not have any points get to play with the other people who play clean?"
pcars,36djtr,BeardedT,1 point,Mon May 18 16:51:08 2015 UTC,"There is no matchmaking in Pcars, you get choose from any lobby that's being hosted."
pcars,36djtr,J13D,1 point,Mon May 18 20:24:41 2015 UTC,Is that PC only or am I missing something on Xbox?
pcars,36djtr,DESYphotowerks,1 point,Mon May 18 22:21:56 2015 UTC,"I'm on PC, so it's possible."
pcars,36djtr,Patbach,1 point,Mon May 18 22:33:19 2015 UTC,Yep that's about right.   My favorite is when your car is clearly better than someone else's and they run you off the road on a straight when you patiently wait to pass.
pcars,36djtr,lightbeat,1 point,Mon May 18 17:07:39 2015 UTC,I don't know what people expect with racing online.
pcars,36djtr,Badgerisbest,1 point,Mon May 18 19:12:48 2015 UTC,"Knock on wood: I am 4 for 4 in wins online right now.  Only 1 race had some dirty drivers in it, in which they tried to take me out once (Formula B race), succeeded in running me off the track, and took a little aero damage, but that was it. The others tended to destroy their cars, and had to pit, where I ran 8 laps pretty much by my self.   I use the Forza Method. If I can get out front, stay out front. Play it safe to insure I don't mess up and have to fight back through that crap. If I can't, just be patient, and observant, to get around the idiots. Also, you may want to turn your rear view mirror on. (cycle the HUD) This way you can see when someone's making a run at you, and you can try to get out of the way before they hit you."
pcars,36djtr,QuadroMan1,1 point,Mon May 18 19:18:13 2015 UTC,"I don't know what I expected..  I'm a big iRacing racer,  and I thought all this community development would come up witg some sort of online racing rules,  but no..  Simple hosted sessions how bad os that."
pcars,36djtr,brownyR31,1 point,Mon May 18 22:34:23 2015 UTC,You mean I shouldn't accelerate into you on the corner to slow down? How else would one achieve the required decrease in speed to make the turn?
pcars,36djtr,Bishstixx,1 point,Mon May 18 22:42:04 2015 UTC,I've had a way better experience than Driveclub and by using my mic to tell people to calm down when they come close.
pcars,36djtr,newpatriot,1 point,Tue May 19 01:20:43 2015 UTC,In arcadey racers like Driveclub I have a blast racing extra aggressively (but still not plain ramming to troll). In games like this though it pretty much never pays off and just ruins the vibe/fun of the race.
pcars,36djtr,slobbishbodysfw,1 point,Tue May 19 08:52:46 2015 UTC,biggest dick seemed to be that orange 12c.
pcars,36djtr,newpatriot,1 point,Tue May 19 05:07:02 2015 UTC,Seems about right...
pcars,36djtr,slobbishbodysfw,0,Tue May 19 05:07:54 2015 UTC,Same shit happens whenever I try to race in GTA Online.   That type of players plague both games and I'm suspecting that Mario is to blame.
pcars,36djtr,Woxvis,2,Mon May 18 17:19:52 2015 UTC,"To be fair, it's definitely expected in GTA:O."
pcars,36djtr,Badgerisbest,0,Mon May 18 17:56:02 2015 UTC,Would be fair to expect it in Project Cars as well then.
pcars,36djtr,QuadroMan1,4,Mon May 18 19:02:56 2015 UTC,"I mean, not really?  One is a dedicated racing game.  The other is a game that happens to have racing events in it."
pcars,36djtr,newpatriot,2,Mon May 18 19:43:33 2015 UTC,"Umm, no. GTA:O is a game about robbing banks and shooting shit up. You can't expect people to race clean in a game like that. Pcars however is a dedicated racing game. It's expected that one should race clean, however most don't do that because they're turds."
pcars,36djtr,joshuabowers1,0,Mon May 18 19:47:46 2015 UTC,"There is a while game mode dedicated to battle racing, it was so frustrating because I could win every gta race IF the bastards didn't slam me at every opportunity."
pcars,36djtr,newpatriot,0,Tue May 19 01:22:06 2015 UTC,"The funny part is that most ramming attempts on GTA results in the rammer spinning out too, but they still do it."
pcars,36djtr,kezorN,-2,Tue May 19 08:48:32 2015 UTC,Robbing banks? I guess I missed something there.
pcars,36djtr,newpatriot,1 point,Mon May 18 22:16:16 2015 UTC,Have you typed GTA when you meant GT5/ GT6? :D

pcars,36gb43,ParisHL,1 point,Tue May 19 04:05:15 2015 UTC,Is that how they do laps 1:30 quicker on the community time trials? Don't they know they will just get banned?
pcars,36gb43,EastyUK,1 point,Tue May 19 05:52:12 2015 UTC,"Yeah some guys are hacking or abusing something, the top time for the monza GP community event is 23s with a BWM M1 lol, when an average lap takes 1:50~. These guys can obviously be banned, but I have no idea as to what extend people use hacks to get a few seconds ahead; I've checked ghosts from other top times that seemed potentially legit, and the ghost was much slower than the actual displayed time..."
pcars,36gb43,Nimix_,1 point,Tue May 19 07:15:55 2015 UTC,It's because all they do is upload faster times to the server

pcars,36gpx1,Prinzen,1 point,Tue May 19 06:52:00 2015 UTC,"Recorded 4 different angles from the replay with shadowplay and edited between them in premier. Grading using red giants plugin : colorista, some noise was also added."
pcars,36gpx1,SimonCharles,1 point,Tue May 19 08:35:18 2015 UTC,"Looks nice! Some of the video cuts are way too quick though in my opinion, staying at least a few seconds in the same camera view would make it feel less erratic to watch. Right now the camera angles change so fast that it feels like just as you're getting ready to appreciate the view it gets yanked away for a new cut. Otherwise visually very nice looking."
