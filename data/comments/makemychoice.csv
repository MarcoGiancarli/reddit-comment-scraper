makemychoice,3e5erh,evilbrent,2,Wed Jul 22 03:34:34 2015 UTC,It seems like you have already answered your own question. Uninstall.
makemychoice,3e0rxq,cheesepusher,76,Tue Jul 21 02:00:03 2015 UTC,"I got a parasite from drinking ranch water. I got more and more tired, and had the runs every day for a year. Finally they did tests and put me on antibiotics for ten days, I was violently ill the entire time and despaired of life. The meds didn't nuke it and I was put on another combination.  Little did I know that my doctor was a deuce and the last combination had killed my gut so much that I soon contracted C Diff (besides spending every moment for ten days starving, trying not to throw up or use the toilet)  Finally, 21 days of another medication and months of avoiding onions, raw vegetables, hot food, tortilla chips and anything abrasive, I was almost back to normal.   The shits and malise came back after a few months and now I'm waiting on the results from my latest test.  Parasites are nothing to mess with, and can be damn hard to get rid of. You could not pay me to experience that again. I lost a year of my life. (And counting)"
makemychoice,3e0rxq,nspikeu,6,Tue Jul 21 02:50:04 2015 UTC,True but some parasites are more dangerous and others are practically harmless to the host. Hookworms in first world countries are not fatal and if your being monitored it really poses no health risk at all.
makemychoice,3e0rxq,Exiledhunter,2,Tue Jul 21 10:17:55 2015 UTC,I wouldn't wish c diff on my worst enemy. I wouldn't wish it on Hitler. Get better. If the antibiotics don't work maybe look into getting a fecal transplant. I feel for ya.
makemychoice,3e0rxq,marilyn_morose,34,Tue Jul 21 16:38:13 2015 UTC,Hell no. Unless you are extremely strapped for cash and are at risk for being homeless if you don't get this money. Gross.
makemychoice,3e0rxq,wicksa,5,Tue Jul 21 02:12:11 2015 UTC,"I really don't need the money. I mean, I'm not rich but I'm not dead broke. I'm more interested in the odd experience."
makemychoice,3e0rxq,wicksa,28,Tue Jul 21 02:15:27 2015 UTC,"Hookworm infection affects over half a billion people globally.[1] It is a leading cause of maternal and child morbidity in the developing countries of the tropics and subtropics. In developed countries, hookworm infection is rarely fatal, but anemia can be significant in a heavily infected individual. Hookworm infection is a soil-transmitted helminthiasis and therefore classified as a neglected tropical disease.[2] Ancylostomiasis, is the disease caused when Ancylostoma duodenale hookworms, present in large numbers, produce an iron deficiency anemia by sucking blood from the host's intestinal walls.   source  sounds odd alright. I just wouldn't willingly risk my health like that. it's obviously your choice though. I mean, it sounds like you probably won't die."
makemychoice,3e0rxq,Planner_Hammish,16,Tue Jul 21 02:20:56 2015 UTC,"Lol, it's also a controlled study through a reputable university. I'm pretty sure I'd make it. I appreciate the concern though. So, still a no because it's gross?"
makemychoice,3e0rxq,wicksa,5,Tue Jul 21 02:23:46 2015 UTC,"I am assuming they will use the results ""for good"". With 1bn+ people infected, just think of all the people the research could save. The ripples through time could be huge! If all those people don't die, then they could carry out their lives and reproduce, increasing the world population."
makemychoice,3e0rxq,PointyOintment,7,Tue Jul 21 13:50:16 2015 UTC,I vote no! haha
makemychoice,3e0rxq,charmingtortoise,9,Tue Jul 21 02:29:47 2015 UTC,That sounds like an argument in favor of participating. (Think of all those people this research could help!)
makemychoice,3e0rxq,say592,2,Tue Jul 21 02:57:17 2015 UTC,I was thinking the same thing. How many chances do many of us have to make a difference to the larger good. Wonder if you'll get like a hookworm plushie to commemorate the study.
makemychoice,3e0rxq,_makura,8,Tue Jul 21 05:54:56 2015 UTC,"Since the money isn't s factor, do it! It will make for a cool story, and you will help whatever that are studying. The fact that there is some cash is a nice bonus, maybe save it up and take a vacation at the end."
makemychoice,3e0rxq,buttsarefunny,14,Tue Jul 21 03:39:46 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't pay attention to all the hysterical people here being all ""well my experience was terrible!""  yes, it was, and it was under different circumstances. Yours is a controlled situation, there's wasn't.  If you'd like the odd experience I'd say go for it."
makemychoice,3e0rxq,dougielou,8,Tue Jul 21 03:20:29 2015 UTC,"I'd do it. It's only the stool sample part that would bother me a bit, but as long as there's no real health risk (which it sounds like there isn't since they're presumably allowed to do this), it sounds like a nice little cash bonus each week. Grocery money!"
makemychoice,3e0rxq,Exiledhunter,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:08:52 2015 UTC,I take stool samples from animals all the time so that's not a big deal. I'm not even putting the money into the thought process as I'm not in desperate financial dire straits atm. I'd more do this for the odd experience.
makemychoice,3e0rxq,Javlington,3,Tue Jul 21 02:17:30 2015 UTC,This sounds like the beginning to a great TIFU...
makemychoice,3e0rxq,cocksparrow,4,Tue Jul 21 14:36:53 2015 UTC,It's not fatal and it won't affect you much if you eat iron rich food and drink water. Since the parasite is literally sucking your blood. But the study will help other people with hookworms and you will earn some cash. So why the heck not.
makemychoice,3e0rxq,charmingtortoise,4,Tue Jul 21 10:16:05 2015 UTC,"Yes, this type of study has to pass a battery of regulatory tests before they even start thinking about infecting people. You help science, make a bit of money, and make for a nice story to tell later on. Contact the scientists behind the study to ask for more info, they will be happy to hear from you!"
makemychoice,3e0rxq,NotScrollsApparently,3,Tue Jul 21 12:16:24 2015 UTC,"I say don't do it because that's a shitty rate. Fuck you, pay me!"

makemychoice,3e0rxq,Idovoodoo,2,Tue Jul 21 05:04:08 2015 UTC,Look at this way. You're clearly interested enough in doing that. Are you really willing to give it up because few random people on the Internet told you not to do it? What would you think about that decision in a few years?
makemychoice,3e0rxq,Koraks,2,Tue Jul 21 11:32:11 2015 UTC,I'd say do it. There are plenty of species of hookworms so I doubt they are going to give you a serious one. I've even heard about hookworms being studied as a treatment for crohn's disease. Plus cash is cash!

makemychoice,3e0rxq,Rohaq,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:05:24 2015 UTC,"If money's not an issue, don't bother. $60/visit for 0.5 hrs - 1.5 hrs per week?  I understand that that's good money when you look at the income as per hour. But there's a good chance that having to go to the clinic to give your samples is going to be a pain in the ass. What if you want to go out with your friends for lunch? What if you want to take a nap? What if you find a girl and want to hang out with her for just a little while longer?  I say skip it since you're not strapped for cash."

But in terms of the price tag, it's steadily gone up as the shoes have gotten more popular. They are extremely high quality sneakers though. The leather is top notch and the sole is stitched on instead of glued, as it would be normally. The sole will still wear though, and although the shoes would last longer than normal sneakers, don't think that the construction is worth the price. You're definitely paying for the exclusivity and brand name here. I'll link some more in depth stuff when I get to a computer."

makemychoice,3dwswz,NiggleNog,3,Mon Jul 20 04:39:35 2015 UTC,Spanish no brainer its far more common around the world. Especially if you live in the US.
makemychoice,3dwswz,Thrillhouse01,2,Mon Jul 20 12:10:20 2015 UTC,"I'd say French, If it's what you really want to learn. You would be more motivated to study it. Hey you never know you might land a good job and end up not have to know any Spanish, but you would also have a language behind your belt that you're happy with. Unless its an absolute necessity that you will need Spanish to get a job then do that but I say go French."
makemychoice,3dwswz,Jmcur,1 point,Mon Jul 20 07:54:09 2015 UTC,"I'm assuming you're in high school as those two languages are the most common foreign languages provided. Here are my two cents:  I've finished high school French (started it in middle school), and I can say that even after five years of learning it, I feel like I still have a long way to go. I can maintain a casual conversation, but anything beyond that will be difficult for me. So I'd say regardless of what foreign language you pick, for you to be able to use it in real life will take much more learning outside of a school environment.  Now, I'll tell you about my observations about learning French vs. Spanish. French is the ""contrarian"" language to learn - Spanish is the most popular language to learn in most schools. So if you strive to be different, perhaps you should choose French. Spanish is seen to be easier, though, according to some friends who have taken both. I don't know exactly why it's seen to be easier, but I'm just throwing it out here.  But in the end, to actually make a choice for you, I'd say go and take French. You're internally motivated to learn French while you're externally motivated to learn Spanish. If I learned anything from an introductory psychology course, it's that being internally motivated typically yields better results."

makemychoice,3duexo,JeremyG,4,Sun Jul 19 17:25:12 2015 UTC,"There are lots of tutorials, but IMO you should only use those to get the absolute basics(e.g. crafting) and go to one of the wikis if you need to know something specific. There's lots of content which is better to experience blindly rather than you already know what will happen. I'd say mouse and keyboard because it's easier to aim ranged weapons with the mouse."
