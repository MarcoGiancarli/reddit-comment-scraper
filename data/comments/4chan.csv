4chan,3dxi9n,3nterShift,7,Mon Jul 20 15:52:19 2015 UTC,"Condoms don't protect from herpes. If a person has herpes the contagious area is more or less like an speedo swimsuit would cover around the genitals. This means that if you are a male, the condom will only cover a part of your pennis, leaving unprotected the base of it and the area around it, where you can also get herpes. In the case of women is even worse, because the base of the pennis will run around a big area of your vagina, so condoms are kind of useless.   The best way to be protected from herpes is to actually only have sex with a regular partner.  Also, remember herpes is asymptotic. If you cannot see it, it doesn't mean anything. Ah, and it will stay with you until you die, and even if years passed from your last outbreak, you can still transmit it to other people."
4chan,3dxi9n,the_phet,2,Mon Jul 20 14:45:44 2015 UTC,The best way to protect from herpes is to avoid all physical contact with everyone.  Anyone who has ever had a cold sore has the herpes virus.

4chan,3dxi9n,Kylethetrashpile,2,Mon Jul 20 21:34:13 2015 UTC,"Cold sores are not exactly the same as genital herpes. Remember that herpes only means ""dormant in your nervous system"", chicken pox -- shingles are also an herpes.  If you have cold sores, you won't have outbreaks on your genitals. If you have cold sores and have sex with someone who has genital herpes and you're unlucky, you will also have herpes on your genital area. Different virus, you can have both. Having one doesn't protect from the other. Cold sores is not consisted an STD. Genital herpes is an STD"
4chan,3dxi9n,th30be,2,Mon Jul 20 15:43:49 2015 UTC,"Oral herpes (HSV-1) and genital herpes (HSV-2) are different viruses, but they can both exist in both areas.

Bring software that can detect both duplicate and near-duplicate images, and if you have a friend with experience in identifying fakes it wouldn't hurt to bring them along as well."

Well after Jesus's supposed lifetime: No brainer here, there are 0 primary sources, say you accepted the forgery as actually being written by Josephus, it would have no historical value anyway; In terms of proving or disproving whether or not Jesus existed. Imagine someone today wrote a Facebook post wherein they stated ""I heard a rumour from the New York Mayor that a citizen's business associate's grandfather met this awesome guy back in 1934 that could drink 20 bottles of vodka and piss out clean water"". You can see that the Facebook post, which essentially amounts to a folk tale, would offer no valuable information at all as to whether or not that man actually existed."
4chan,3dwe1m,Jetharred,2,Mon Jul 20 13:22:46 2015 UTC,"There were three passages where Josephus wrote about Jesus.  In the Testimonius, it is widely regarded to have been interpolated after being written, but not wholly fabricated. The interpolation was probably not by Christians as the interpolations don't perfectly fit the New Testament.  The other passages where Jesus is described are regarded as authentic by almost all modern scholarship.  Edit: once again, Josephus has historical value for many other things. You cannot merely discount the parts of his work that you don't want to be true.  What about the passage where he describes James, Jesus' brother? That was assuredly authentic according to modern scholarship. James, also, was very much alive when Josephus worked."

4chan,3dwgfs,fullmoan,4,Mon Jul 20 18:49:55 2015 UTC,Sure you can. Just build a ball that deflates once it gets to the end. Bam.
4chan,3dwgfs,MrRibbotron,2,Mon Jul 20 22:35:02 2015 UTC,How do you build a deflating ball out of the stone they make bowling balls out of?
4chan,3dwgfs,fullmoan,303,Tue Jul 21 06:55:19 2015 UTC,Build a ball that's filled with water and has air pockets that expand after its thrown to make it beach ball sized. Knock down all the pins and it quickly goes back to normal. Maybe you could do some sort of shell that slides out from under itself so it doesn't crumple when it hits the pins.
4chan,3dwgfs,cre_ate_eve,125,Tue Jul 21 07:14:02 2015 UTC,"i would assume there are standards for the diameter for the ball.  And then the density of water would depend on temperature, altitude, and salinity"

4chan,3dwgfs,PbAsHg,3,Mon Jul 20 17:19:55 2015 UTC,"The Nagant revolver fires a round that creates a seal around the cylinder opening, stopping gases from escaping and allowing the revolver to be effectively suppressed. It also marginally increases velocity."

This assumption invalidates all the crap you wrote.  Everyone is stupider for reading this shit.  You're one of those imbeciles who believes that having an opinion is much more important than knowing facts, right?  Go educate yourself about HIV.  TL;DR is that if you're not black, not a gay man, not an intravenous drug user -- you pretty much don't have to worry about HIV at all.  Period.  Transmission rates for blood transfusion are only 90%.  Unprotected receptive intercourse has ridiculously low transmission rate: the risk of her contracting HIV from receptive penile-vaginal intercourse is 0.08%, from receptive anal intercourse is less than 1.5%.  Source: http://www.cdc.gov/hiv/policies/law/risk.html  Even if she did have HIV, her husband would have only 0.04% of contracting it from her by the means of insertive penile-vaginal intercourse.  Husband has to have ~1732 unprotected sexual intercourses until his odds of getting aids would reach 50%."

4chan,3dtmaq,Jodopepax,16,Sun Jul 19 14:21:23 2015 UTC,"Been posted earlier in this thread, but here it is. I just dont understand why they would want to get married if she wants to fuck other dudes. You wanna fuck other dudes, great, just be boyfriend and girlfriend, or even friends with benefits. Maybe even a civil parternship. Marriage is saying you will be faithful to one person, its not just 'something you do'."
4chan,3dtmaq,uptotwentycharacters,-45,Sun Jul 19 20:51:53 2015 UTC,It's really only beta if the girl pressured him into it. If he willingly choose to enter an open relationship he's actually pretty alpha for being confident enough to go against societal expectations.

4chan,3dtmaq,uptotwentycharacters,-29,Sun Jul 19 15:24:03 2015 UTC,Not really. For most people there really is no such thing as 'enough'. Even billionaires wish they had more money. Essentially an open relationship allows both participants to get more sex while still providing the security of a relationship.

4chan,3dtmaq,MeaterBeaterEater,-15,Sun Jul 19 15:32:05 2015 UTC,"Hmm interesting. It seems to focus more on the modern, privilege-based version of feminism than the older, more egalitarian version. It basically says women should have more sexual choice then men (as a sort of compensation for male privilege?) which is really anti-egalitarian - the egalitarian view is that sex is the choice of both participants. And an ""unbalanced"" open relationship where one has more sex than the other really doesn't make sense unless one partner is far more sexual than the other."

Not quite. (Source: had surgery to fix mine a couple weeks ago)  There are two different surgery options, the older Ratvitch and the newer Nuss. The Ratvitch is invasive: your chest is cut open down the middle, your sternum etc are forced into the correct position.  The Nuss is non-invasive (or much less so): two small slits are made in the side of your torso, a couple inches below the armpits. In this procedure, the metal bar is inserted to force everything into the correct position. The bar stays in for 2-3 years before it is removed.  The Nuss leaves barely any noticeable scar, and has a much faster recovery time than the older one. At this point, the only thing that still hurts me is sneezing because it entails sucking a massive amount of air in really fast."
4chan,3ds0o4,Odale,7,Sun Jul 19 04:13:45 2015 UTC,"Got the Nuss procedure done almost 8 years ago. The bar is still in my chest. I wouldn't count on it getting taken out anytime soon. Last time I was in, about 6 months ago, they said a lot of doctors are leaving the bar in permanently to avoid risk of the chest returning back to the way it was before the operation. Also, I highly recommend buying some scar cream and massaging it into your scars once or twice a day. I did that for a few weeks after my operation and my scars are barely visible now."
4chan,3ds0o4,MerryMacattack,5,Sun Jul 19 02:29:58 2015 UTC,Is there anywhere I can look to see any sort of visual so I can understand this procedure?

I had this operation done when I was in 7th grade and yes, it is as painful as it looks. I watched the video they took of my operation the day after the surgery and watching how the procedure works made me want to puke."

The PS4 is selling very very very well but they lose money on almost all other ventures and that's their issue. Even though their hardware is pretty good (I love my Bravia and surround sound system), it doesn't profit. Even if Xbox does poorly, Microsoft has a lot of other sources of income that balance it out. It looks like though, that Xbox has really shifted into gear this season with their focus on PC gaming as well as the Xbox consoles.

You've messed with the community of the wrong psychopath. Before you get excited, you haven't even made me angry. I am a hard person to make angry. However, I despise people like you. Your pitiful hacking skills are hilarious. Hacking accounts and putting up proxies are level 1. Can you hack into encrypted files? Can you tear through firewalls without leaving a mark? Your silly little proxy won't protect you. I've hacked into many computers and spied on the users. I've hacked into games. I have been hacking since I had a computer. It's what I was raised to do. You have no idea to the extent of fear which you should be feeling. All you are is just a community of internet creeps. Have you ever murdered anyone? I have no empathy and I will probably feel joy peeling your skin off your face.  You think I'm giving you an empty threat? Believe that. I have contacts in dark places that you don't want to know about. If you live even close to me you better fear for your life. Track my IP if you want to, but I am smart enough to use a library computer. Hack into my account if you want, but it'll just make it easier for me to track you.  With love,  A psychopath  P.S. I would fear for your life while you still have it."

Wrong. This one time, I had to take a shit really bad. I penguin-legged it into the bathrooms, went into a stall, and unleashed a huge torrent of diarrhea into the toilet bowl. As soon as I finished, I grabbed for the toilet paper. And what did I find? Nothing. An empty toilet paper dispenser. So I had exit the stall with my pants only halfway pulled up to avoid getting shit all over them, and go into the other stall. But guess what? The other stall was locked. There was nobody in there, some fucknut managed to lock the door after they were done taking a shit. So I had to crawl on the piss-soaked floor and go under the stall door. AND GUESS FUCKING WHAT?! There was no toilet paper in this stall either. At this time I didn't know about the trick of using your socks to wipe your ass, so I had only one choice. I had to sit down on the toilet, scoop up the residual shit on my asshole with my fingers, and paint it on the wall like a (literally) shitty finger paint project to get rid of the diarrhea covering my anus. That bathroom wall completely covered in streaks of shit is a testament to the desperate struggle man faces in the search for things to wipe their ass with.

I fell right in the middle of the graph so I'm not really right wing or left wing - the closest match for a political candidate I'd agree with was Marco Rubio, but there were still several things we didn't see eye to Mexican eye on. Donald Trump would be an interesting president if nothing else because he's basically the epitome of greedy Jew corporations and racism.

This one time, I had to take a shit really bad. I penguin-legged it into the bathrooms, went into a stall, and unleashed a huge torrent of diarrhea into the toilet bowl. As soon as I finished, I grabbed for the toilet paper. And what did I find? Nothing. An empty toilet paper dispenser. So I had exit the stall with my pants only halfway pulled up to avoid getting shit all over them, and go into the other stall. But guess what? The other stall was locked. There was nobody in there, some fucknut managed to lock the door after they were done taking a shit. So I had to crawl on the piss-soaked floor and go under the stall door. AND GUESS FUCKING WHAT?! There was no toilet paper in this stall either. At this time I didn't know about the trick of using your socks to wipe your ass, so I had only one choice. I had to sit down on the toilet, scoop up the residual shit on my asshole with my fingers, and paint it on the wall like a (literally) shitty finger paint project to get rid of the diarrhea covering my anus. That bathroom wall completely covered in streaks of shit is a testament to the desperate struggle man faces in the search for things to wipe their ass with.  Also, nice diss to Anon with that contrast between them and a tree."

And before France it was the Roman Empire... do you see a trend here?   Highest GDP on Earth   No, the award goes to the European Union (and even economics professors recognize that fact). Also we get 4 weeks vacation per year at the very least, no sick days bullshit (instead call in sick whenever you are), and many more benefits.   Worth 51% of the global economy   See point above. Also don't forget about China.   Largest navy in the world   Yes, that's true. It's only boats though. Meanwhile 30 million of your people live below the poverty line but hey, gotta keep them boats floating.   Military bases on 1/3rd of the Earth   That is correct, I checked it out. However consider that with this much coverage, your army is the most talked about - Americans like to claim that their Marines are tough (although now they're talking more about Seal Team Six ever since the Osama operation), but there are much more powerful military branches in other armies. They aren't talked about because they don't strut like a peacock on national TV.   Only country with a functioning railgun   No, tested railgun. It's probable that it will see deployment soon. But as the US army is modernizing itself, it calls foreign companies to do the development, such as many new weapons being designed by FN (a Belgian arms maker).   30 years technologically superior   Source and definitions please.   Only military capable of producing drones   We get it, you have a big dick. That's also false.   Developing a new generation of spaceships   That's actually true, and I'm very happy that at least one country in the world is investing in a space program.   Only country to have been to the Moon   First and only, yes, but that's because there's no reason to go the Moon. It would be a waste of time and money.   Only country to have a private sector working in space programs   That's not true.   Global center of the arts [snip]   Yes, but not entirely. You have enough space, population and cities to become the global centre of the arts, but you don't have the monopoly on representations of the arts - for example, many political summits are hosted every year in Europe, not in the United States.   Owns the most cities   That's not an achievement. What's the difference between a city of 10'000 and two cities of 5'000?   Won WW2 singlehandedly   Well now you're just baiting... oh   Leader of the free world   My conclusion is that the USA may be the world's first superpower (certainly not the only one) today, but it will not keep this title indefinitely. As I stated earlier, we have seen superpowers come and go throughout history for various reasons.     Follow our elections   Because it's all our media talks about. You are right, though. In a sense.   Eat our food   Not really. There's a shitton of MacDonald's but that's it, you'll be hard-pressed to find more than a handful of Burger Kings in a single European country. Believe me, generally European food found in grocery stores is tastier than US food.   Watch our movies and shows   That is correct, and there is no argument to be made there. I wish my country could learn to make movies.   You wear our clothes   Yes, but not at any higher rate than you do in the US. Also most designer clothes (the real designer clothes, not the Indian manufacture with a logo on it) are European.   You copy our vernacular   If we speak English, which is pretty much limited to Great-Britain and Ireland.   You access American websites   Congratulations, you understand that the Internet is not limited by countries. What's next, closing a website when the store closes for the night?   You copy our Constitution and laws   mfw fags don't know about Common and Roman law.   You read our books, etc. art, etc.   Yes, but not only yours. A little cultural openness never hurt anybody, maybe you should read more Hugo and Dostoevsky in the US.   Use our weapons   We use European weapons. The list is endless. I'll admit there's a certain charm to a Revolver though.   Drive our cars   If we're poor and if it's being sold for pennies only.   The global economy is based on US dollars   Because you were the winners of World War 2 while the Cold war was polarizing the world, and we needed one. Do you know that French is still the diplomatic language of the world? Why do you think that is?   Our military maintain bases on your soil   You have bases in less than half of Europe. Interestingly, I found out that Great-Britain also has a ton of military bases in the world. You're hardly the sole player of this game.   When our President speaks, you listen.   Alas, you are correct."

4chan,3dogze,Devanismyname,1 point,Sat Jul 18 13:00:18 2015 UTC,Imagine if the US spent that money on robot probes all over the Solar system instead of funding some clown to play golf on the moon.  Manned space exploration is a dead end and Russia got to the moon first.

4chan,3dm98d,GenderConfusedSquid,7,Fri Jul 17 17:13:57 2015 UTC,"Mississippi does suck. It's actually the lowest average income in the nation. The Civil War really destroyed their economy in every way (they were really dependent on cotton), but there are efforts to support offshore oil drilling off the coasts of MS so they can join the ranks of Alabama and Texas. Until then their main pull is the fact that gambling and casinos are legal."
4chan,3dm98d,Brobi_WanKenobi,6,Fri Jul 17 17:18:55 2015 UTC,As someone who lives on the coast I'm convinced that all of Mississippi's money comes from Biloxi and that donut shop downtown where the line stretches around the block
4chan,3dm98d,SolidCake,12,Fri Jul 17 18:28:53 2015 UTC,"Biloxi is such a degenerate shithole. You know that one chain smoking lady on Futurama with the saggy boobs and the loose fitting magenta shirt who still thinks she's hot? That's my personification of Biloxi, Mississippi.  Edit: This lady"
4chan,3dm98d,Brobi_WanKenobi,-2,Fri Jul 17 18:31:27 2015 UTC,Your country would be so much better off if you moved all the people in poverty there and told them to fuck off from the union.
4chan,3dm98d,GenderConfusedSquid,2,Fri Jul 17 17:50:47 2015 UTC,"They pretty much all do that themselves anyway. Between them, Alabama, and Louisiana (three objectively worst states in the union) the population that is below the national poverty line is staggering. Nice thing is that no one ever comes out of those states so they can't infect the rest of us with their shitty poverty, but that also means they never improve either. Louisiana got the worst of it honestly; they used to be a culturally rich, well educated state with a lot of great income from sugar plantations, but the Civil War really ruined them. In fact Louisiana had a very large black population who were better educated and richer than most of the rest of the entire nation. Now it's all poor people with no resources."
4chan,3dm98d,Brobi_WanKenobi,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:56:50 2015 UTC,Remove them and your country's HDI and GDP per capita would go up greatly. I think a lot of americas negative stereotypes come from those shitholes. You would be better off without them.
4chan,3dm98d,GenderConfusedSquid,0,Fri Jul 17 18:00:03 2015 UTC,"I don't necessarily disagree, but the bright side is that if we keep the shitholes around we can just send the shitty people there and they'll just stick around and not give trouble to the people who are actually contributing to society. Big cities are a problem because they mix a lot of shitty shithole people who don't belong with the people who are actually doing stuff. I honestly have no idea how it's possible to be poor and live in NYC or LA. I have a pretty good job and I know I couldn't afford it."

4chan,3dl848,killaskezo,-10,Fri Jul 17 13:05:16 2015 UTC,You do know that Germany was in the same situation as greece 70 years ago and not only did everyone bail them out they also cancelled their debt that is the only reason Germany exists as it does today.
4chan,3dl848,self_arrested,6,Fri Jul 17 14:26:05 2015 UTC,"Except Germany worked toward a capitalist system that generated revenue through tax dollars because companies were productive compared to the socialist pension hungry non productive society Greece has become. Get off the euro, start manufacturing and you will export a ton because of the devalued and inflated drachma. Reward hard work and punish laziness and then consider joining the euro 20 years from now"

If this was done to individuals rather than a country would we be demanding that they pay this back of course not, the fact that people seem to think it's impossible to question this debt as being anything other than iron clad in it's assertion. This runs both contry to the way credit exists and the way currency itself exist, fiat currency relies of the fact that credit is occasionally cancelled."

I honestly have no idea what they were thinking with all the reforms. I have a master in economics and European austerity practices go again everything tought at university.

4chan,3djwb7,crypticfreak,6,Fri Jul 17 01:33:52 2015 UTC,"I could be mistaken, but i believe this is a comic about endochondral ossification. Skeleton jelly is essentially a chondrocyte (cartilage cell) which hypertrophies (drinks the well) and dies (gets eaten). He then cacifies (squirxical jelly) and then drips into ultraviolet city, which looks suspiciously like the trabeculae of ossified bone. I'm pretty sure it's not all a coincidence, it made me chuckle."
4chan,3djwb7,NormalNormalNormal,7,Fri Jul 17 05:59:55 2015 UTC,Faggot
4chan,3djwb7,Hexonloire,5,Fri Jul 17 08:07:56 2015 UTC,"You know, that is the one thing I really couldn't put my finger on. I looked over the comic again after reading your comment and noticed a few other interesting things though. After meeting tiny animals brain dude, Skeleton Jelly says ""Am I Skull Town Jelly? No! I am Skeleton Jelly."" This line caught my eye not only because of the play on words, but because bones of the skull and general cranial region ossify through Intramembranous Ossification, which is a very different process compared to the Endochondral Ossification that Skeleton Jelly goes through. Hence, his violent reaction against becoming Skull Town Jelly.   The man with many hands and eyes that Skeleton Jelly meets reminds me of the Hypothalamus gland in that it is the main link between the endocrine and nervous system. The hypothalamus receives a lot of information and dictates a lot of developmental instruction, explaining the 360 degree vision and all the hands held like traffic signs.  To me, the well is just a source of ground substance, which helps alter a chondrocyte's chemical makeup to prepare it for apoptosis and ossification.   The guy who chews up Skeleton Jelly represents the mechanism by which chondrocytes perform apoptosis, but we don't exactly know what that mechanism is yet, so I can't say for sure. (Osteoblasts is what I assume, but more research must be done).  The last character our Jelly meets is my favourite. Taking my previous assumptions to be correct, Jelly must be inside a human body, and the squares of all the walls are various cells, right? Well we meet this alien-shaped character who looks almost human - at least in the early developmental stages. My guess is a fetus for that reason, and Jelly must be in a pregnant woman. This makes sense to me as well because the female pelvis expands and gets slightly denser in late term pregnancies to support more weight, correct center of mass, etc...   Of course the comic falls closer to making a commentary about the crises of identity and existentialism, but I couldn't help but notice the parallels between the working human anatomy and Skeleton Jelly's little adventure."

4chan,3diu4s,Guyote_,16,Fri Jul 17 01:33:36 2015 UTC,"True story. I did the 23andme genetic testing stuff, and found that one of my traits was ""Asparagus Metabolite Detection: Higher Odds of Detection"".  Some people are able to detect a distinct smell in their urine after eating asparagus, while other people don't notice a thing. Those who do catch a whiff liken the smell to rotten or boiling cabbage. The odor is thought to be due to an excreted metabolite called methanethiol, a sulfur-containing compound. Whether smelling the asparagus scent in urine is due to the ability to produce methanethiol, or the ability to detect it, hasn't quite been figured out yet. Regardless, family-based studies suggest that there is a genetic component to this odd human trait.  It's so bad, that if I eat Asparagus, I can't have sex with the wife (I ain't gonna subject her to my stinky spoo) for at least a couple days because OMG IT SMELLS LIKE BURNING RUBBER COMING OUT OF MY DICK.

So aiming to become historic is just fucking stupid  Enjoy yer life, smell flowers, remind yourself of 3 things yer grateful for.  Being happy isn't just pushing a button, it's a godamn struggle for a lot of us so stop acting like it should somehow come served  For fuck sake, take up a hobby, take classes, go out and speak with people, fail a fuckton of times, fail a hundred times but once you don't fail and you get that 1 good experience you'll realize what is worth fighting for and what is worth whining about on the internet  jebus 4chan"

I'm curious how old you are? I might have had (some of) your opinions when I was around 17-20, where I went from having many shitty friends, to having just a few. Now in my upper 20s, I have 3 male friends, lots of 'friend' coworkers, but I always have a GF (a fault of mine; because I have few friends, I am horrible about how quickly I'll let a girl move in with me).  I certainly felt like ""well fuck it, these guys really aren't good friends anymore,"" in my late teens / very early twenties.  My criteria changed, which required reflection and eventually altering the way I act to facilitate that change. That's more what I'm talking about.  I think maybe, if you care, you would value very few, but meaningful relationships. People who, over time, you decide to befriend; after time, that 'guard' you're describing drops and more of you shows. It sounds like your guard is maybe worth examining"

As soon as I got a job and a schedule and people realized that I was actually gay because a couple years ago I had gotten a BF, they very quickly stopped wanting to be my friends.  And now I don't have a BF because he had horrible habits and was a pig. =/  I do have a guard up around strangers for sure though now. I've been through a lot of negativity with people and would almost rather not deal with people if I don't have to anymore. Not to mention my job is socially and emotionally draining. If I knew I couldn't get the job I wanted in an IT role I would have chosen something else that involves getting yelled at less for something that isn't my fault and not my responsibility to fix."

When I entered the work force my job was similar, but I was a 401k phone center rep, then a pre licensed broker, then licensed broker. I was making good money, but the environment was horrible and tense. I left the field right after getting licensed and have a much happier career in b2b development/sales.   Sorry to hear about the friends I guess, but it sounds like they weren't really friends anyway. I can relate to that.

They only hurt because he tries to pull them off, and everyone knows you can't remove the stigma that is nipple rocks."

4chan,3dlfbq,kingfish101,5,Fri Jul 17 05:41:28 2015 UTC,"Actual answer:  Some males, during puberty, get a hard, pebble-like thing located under their nipple. This is due to something like some gland or whatever kicking into gear as testosterone increases, and the body deciding to shut off forever the ability to lactate, since it's starting ""male"" puberty and not ""female"" puberty. Apparently there's some hormone gland behind the nipple; I dunno. They're all over the place.  Apparently this is a fairly common occurrence. They go away on their own by the end of puberty, so I don't know what OP was talking about with getting rid of them, since that sounds like a dangerous, retarded maneuver."

Unlike the bags of heat melded plastic that you cut open trying to make a straight line that never works without leaving some jagged piece somewhere to scrape your arm on every time you reach in to pull out a cup of dog food.

4chan,3dg4gv,IchDien,31,Thu Jul 16 14:18:58 2015 UTC,"Unlikely anyways.  More like Chad gets really hammered every weekend, and on one particular friday night decides to make a beer run while simultaneously blowing 0.2. He gathers his fake ID, hops in his 2014 BMW SUV (but in his successful father's name) and takes off, exceeding the speed limit by an average of 15 miles per hour.  On one particularly dimly-lit road, anon is walking alone. Anon lives in the same town as Chad, but doesn't go to the same university. Anon is barely above NEET tier, working at a 7-11 where he is generally by himself and has no motivation to act friendly to all the degenerate customers who make the shops doors ring. After a particularly long shift (he was forced to cover because the other employee got arrested with meth) anon gets out late and plans on getting in a little video gaming. He really needs it too, since lately he's been depressed. He's going nowhere, he has no friends, and his parents have a hard time hiding their disappointment. He keeps his face at the ground, too demotivated to look ahead - more problems.  Here are two protagonists meet. Chad loses control when cresting a hill and swerves across the two opposite lanes of the road to run into anon, causing him to be massively injured, and the BMW is totalled. Chad stumbles out, unscathed. He starts freaking out about how his dad is going to be pissed, when one of his bros along for the run notices anon bleeding out. Chad calls the ambulance and runs away knowing it doesn't look good.  Anon is declared dead as soon as the ambulance arrives. The police follow soon after, and learn chad was driving. They find him at his parents mansions and let him know he's under investigation, but not under arrest yet. He calls his girlfriend, Stacy, and tells her he needs to speak to her dad, who is a partner at the largest law firm in the area. Being the boyfriend of his daughter and a good family friend through his father,  chad gets Stacy's dad to represent him. Stacy, meanwhile takes to twitter and facebook to convince the town that chad is a good guy and didn't do anything wrong, and being a popular fellow it grows. Eventually the police close the investigation and rule it as an accident.  Anons funeral is held shortly later. However, the only people who show up are his parents. The funeral takes longer than they expected, however, and so they leave early before the burial to make sure they don't miss their flight to Miami, the first stop on their goal to live out their lives had they not accidentally had and kept anon instead of aborting him. They claim the life insurance policy they took out on him and live happily ever after."

I'm betting it's one of those fucking wrist mounted iphone monitor ""watches""!  Where is he standing? Is he the degenerate fuck who graffitied all of that shit on the wall? Is that what that stupid, smug smile was about? Is he proud that he's gone out of his way to fuck with other people, to try to get people to know him? Does it work?

But if you go listen to that scene it's pretty clear that Bane isn't being cut off by the FBI dude, he's replying to the ""big guy"" statement.  ""But why would Bane feel the need to point out he's a big guy compared to FBI guy?? Bane is big compared to everyone. It makes more sense that he would be threatening him!!"" you might say. Ah, but Bane is threatening him, he's simply being subtle about it. Sure, he's big for everyone, but right at that moment the only person who should be concerned about his size is the agent who, as we find out, is about to be killed by Bane. I think this interpretation is way cooler."

He gazes into the bottom of his clear glass tea cup as the crisp Lipton tea smoothly pours over his tongue. He can feel his stuffing absorbing the life giving sugary solution, but it gives him no sustenance. No comfort. The refraction of the bottom of the cup provides more views of his life, his lie, and the set he is on. None of this is real. He has never known what it's like to be alive, or to feel. Even the lack of comfort is an illusion. He thinks to himself, or at least imagines he does, but one phrase is stuck in his mind like a familiar meme that he doesn't remember hearing about. He thinks to himself, ""It's none of my business."""

4chan,3dfezf,rednukleus,26,Thu Jul 16 06:32:44 2015 UTC,Jared Leto has spent so long portraying a carefully manufactured edgy image for teeny bopper dollars that it's warped his sense of aesthetics. He actually thinks this extremely contrived emo album cover Joker interpretation is working. I'm not seeing this crap.
4chan,3dfezf,bacchic_ritual,13,Thu Jul 16 14:26:48 2015 UTC,"I agree that pandering to edgy teens is leto's shtick, I wonder how much of the jokers character he actually had influence over.

4chan,3dfezf,Gregger90,3,Thu Jul 16 14:36:11 2015 UTC,At the same time the writers could have fucked him over badly as well as the designers. I guess I'll wait and see.

Also, unless you live in the city-city, grocery stores are often like a few miles away, and many people go and run all their errands at once and drive anyway."

4chan,3dj3jx,hero1012878,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:22:01 2015 UTC,"Plate tectonics (from the Late Latin tectonicus, from the Greek: œÑŒµŒ∫œÑŒøŒΩŒπŒ∫œåœÇ ""pertaining to building"")[1] is a scientific theory that describes the large-scale motion of Earth's lithosphere. This theoretical model builds on the concept of continental drift which was developed during the first few decades of the 20th century. The geoscientific community accepted the theory after the concepts of seafloor spreading were later developed in the late 1950s and early 1960s.  The lithosphere, which is the rigid outermost shell of a planet (on Earth, the crust and upper mantle), is broken up into tectonic plates. On Earth, there are seven or eight major plates (depending on how they are defined) and many minor plates. Where plates meet, their relative motion determines the type of boundary; convergent, divergent, or transform. Earthquakes, volcanic activity, mountain-building, and oceanic trench formation occur along these plate boundaries. The lateral relative movement of the plates typically varies from zero to 100 mm annually.[2]  Tectonic plates are composed of oceanic lithosphere and thicker continental lithosphere, each topped by its own kind of crust. Along convergent boundaries, subduction carries plates into the mantle; the material lost is roughly balanced by the formation of new (oceanic) crust along divergent margins by seafloor spreading. In this way, the total surface of the globe remains the same. This prediction of plate tectonics is also referred to as the conveyor belt principle. Earlier theories (that still have some supporters) propose gradual shrinking (contraction) or gradual expansion of the globe.[3]  Tectonic plates are able to move because the Earth's lithosphere has greater strength than the underlying asthenosphere. Lateral density variations in the mantle result in convection. Plate movement is thought to be driven by a combination of the motion of the seafloor away from the spreading ridge (due to variations in topography and density of the crust, which result in differences in gravitational forces) and drag, with downward suction, at the subduction zones. Another explanation lies in the different forces generated by the rotation of the globe and the tidal forces of the Sun and Moon. The relative importance of each of these factors and their relationship to each other is unclear, and still the subject of much debate."

4chan,3daibl,Chipper_chap,4,Wed Jul 15 00:39:12 2015 UTC,still waiting for an answer
4chan,3daibl,FEED_ME_YOUR_EYES,27,Wed Jul 15 01:59:25 2015 UTC,"From a physics perspective, swimming with the use of fins is the same as flying. Air and water are both fluids with different viscosities. The fins on a fish are like wings on a bird or a plane in that they generate lift through their interaction with the surrounding fluid."
4chan,3daibl,Chipper_chap,14,Wed Jul 15 02:40:23 2015 UTC,"thats not the funny response I was looking for, but thanks i guess."
4chan,3daibl,whiskey4breakfast,12,Wed Jul 15 04:52:02 2015 UTC,"Yeah except it's not the same fucking thing at all. Birds and planes generate lift to combat gravity, things swimming in the ocean just have to propel themselves in a certain direction. Are you really comparing an eagle to a fucking manatee? From a non autistic perspective, you are fucking retarded."
4chan,3daibl,FEED_ME_YOUR_EYES,13,Wed Jul 15 00:13:39 2015 UTC,It doesn't apply to all fish; a lot of them use buoyancy to counter gravity instead (you seem to be under the impression that gravity doesn't exist underwater). Sharks for example are a clear example of fish that rely on lift.
4chan,3daibl,AtomicSteve21,2,Wed Jul 15 00:27:02 2015 UTC,lift - generated by air pressure differentials.   buoyancy - generated by water pressure differentials.   A balloon and a swim bladder are not so different.
4chan,3daibl,TardisTechnologist,2,Tue Jul 14 22:29:58 2015 UTC,"Lift can still happen underwater, a fish propelling itself forward can angle it's side fins to provide lift without use of buoyancy.  Similarly buoyancy can occur above ground, a hot air balloon employs buoyancy by being less dense than its surrounding materials causing it to float.  Fish of different species may use both buoyancy and lift to varying extents."

4chan,3dcn9c,hardcorebrowser,3,Thu Jul 16 02:26:25 2015 UTC,"That kind of makes sense though. Redguards don't look like complete ass in Skyrim (they look even worse than everyone else in Oblivion), and they're actually part of the lore. In the Lore they barely have any resemblance to Africans, and I'm pretty sure they have white voice actors. Chances are, if you go looking for this specific mod, you might be racist."

Let people be racist if they want. Nexus does allow all sorts of non-lore-friendly mods, like anime weapons. I don't know about the actors, but there are plenty of black-sounding Redguards (mainly the guys) but I personally think Orcs are more black."

If someone made a mod that turned the Nords black or gave Imperials big noses, I'd be fine with that too. I bet you'r one of those far-left faggots that think it was right to ban the Confederate flag from private use."
4chan,3dcn9c,Waffocalypse,2,Wed Jul 15 21:24:53 2015 UTC,"No, I'm saying the suffering of virtual people doesn't matter, because they don't exist or have feelings.  I agree that it should be removed from government buildings. But they banned it on private property, too, and that goes against freedom of speech.  For the record, while I am not down with slavery, and am not a dumb redneck, the Confederate flag stood for a lot of things, not just slavery, and a lot of people in the south didn't own slaves or even agree with it. This country was built on the backs of slavery, and is just as much a part of our history as the good stuff, and to deny that would be unamerican, just as much as not owning a gun, or weighing under 300 lbs."

4chan,3dalfh,bottomlulz,10,Tue Jul 14 21:37:22 2015 UTC,The cigarettes in concentration camps were more of a currency than for smoking. you could trade them for more bread or some liquor. I think it was 3 for bread and 100 for a thing of liquor.
4chan,3dalfh,Waffocalypse,12,Wed Jul 15 01:11:39 2015 UTC,I imagine they became currency  because some dude wanted to smoke them.

4chan,3dalfh,Vrixithalis,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:30:40 2015 UTC,"Similarly at Buchenwald:  Each prisoner was allowed up to 10 marks per week to be used for the purchase of cigarettes at the camp canteen, other canteen purchases, brothel visits, or credit to a savings account. The regulations went on to specify that a visit to a brothel would cost 2 marks for which 1.5 marks would be kept by the SS and 0.5 marks would be used for ""expenses."""

4chan,3d9e7o,Every_Geth,6,Tue Jul 14 20:32:48 2015 UTC,"Nah, I think they wisely chose what to adapt and what to leave out. Electric Sheep is a great book, but it's not all cinema-friendly.

4chan,3d8k3r,Eoiny,304,Tue Jul 14 16:53:11 2015 UTC,It's lucky that teenage pregnancy numbers drop in the 20-30 age group.

4chan,3d8k3r,MoustacheMauve,78,Tue Jul 14 12:43:09 2015 UTC,A pregnancy that started when you were 19 and finished when you were 20 would be counted as a teen pregnancy at some point. The baby born would be a result of teen pregnancy but would be born to a parent in the 20-30 range.   Also I don't know what I'm talking about but it sounds correct.

As they close the gate you barge in and hold the remaining workers hostage. Take money and put into bags. Run out to across the street and get in your get away car. Drive for 3-4 hours to airport. Ditch car in long term parking. Go home through cab. Tip your cab driver. Profit.

4chan,3d5lmw,DemiDualism,18,Mon Jul 13 21:45:12 2015 UTC,"Is your depression causing rampant suicidal thoughts that you find yourself having trouble containing as the thoughts invade everything you do squeezing the life out of you so that your body is in constant fight or flight mode with itself and the only way to ""get out"" is to release life itself from your body?   If so, you should talk to someone. A lack of money may only be providing a seed for your depression to latch onto and disarm you with an excuse.  If you obtain lots of money the depression will evolve to have a new seed to distract you"
4chan,3d5lmw,948167053248715,9,Mon Jul 13 21:53:15 2015 UTC,"Most of the time, I'm fine. But sometimes, just out of the blue, bam; all I can do is lay in bed fantasize / plan out how to just ending it. How to do it without hurting anyone, or how to do it quickly or painlessly. Or how to do it so nobody finds my body, etc.  I went to a range for the first time a week or two ago. Was having the time of my life and all of sudden my brain goes ""You know, you could just shoot yourself right now and finally be done with it."" I had to take a break to clear my head after that.  Generally it passes after a couple days, sometimes it stays for weeks on end though. It's the reason I was kicked out of school for missing too much time. It's been like this since the 5th or 6th grade, but increased ten fold towards the end of Jr high."
4chan,3d5lmw,manbrasucks,10,Mon Jul 13 22:07:56 2015 UTC,"You'll have to use a doctor or therapist to figure out if it's a physical or mental root cause, and would do so if it affects your quality of life like it did for school. Do note that suicidal thoughts are common, i would have the same ones at a gun range.  It's the inability to let them go that you would want to look into or having inclinations to act on it  Anecdotal based question: are you tired a lot and could almost always go for a nap? If so, look into if you have apnea.  Using myself as a source, chronic fatigue can cause depression,   as well as symptoms of a host of other mental illness"
4chan,3d5lmw,hankbob,5,Mon Jul 13 23:00:18 2015 UTC,chech for food allergies. might be the stupidest reason for depression but hey those things can fuck up your brain. especially grains. also check your thyroid

4chan,3d5lmw,Serenaded,2,Tue Jul 14 01:42:34 2015 UTC,it's actually apart of the bucket list.

4chan,3d5lmw,bogdaniuz,174,Tue Jul 14 04:26:24 2015 UTC,"I always said I would sneak a gun into a water park and bring it to the top of the tallest waterslide. For maximum trauma, I'll hop in straight after a little kid without waiting my turn. Just after I start sliding down, I shoot myself. This gets the attention of everyone nearby, so all eyes are on the slide. If I don't wait my turn, then first they see the little kid pop out crying from the loud noise. The water I'm sliding in travels faster than me, so for a couple seconds everyone just sees blood coming out of the slide. Finally, my dead weight hits the landing pool at full speed. For effect, I'd hope my body doesn't float up at all, but I guess it probably would.   I haven't been to a water park in a while but I guess it would be pretty hard to get a gun in there these days. Once it's in, I think it would be pretty easy to get it to the top of the slide."

It represents a time where they were happy, before the stress and hardship of adult life hit them. Also, I'm guessing that the antisocial autists have a special affinity for games, which were places of solace that they could understand and potentially use to bond with other players the way they are unable to do in regular social settings.   Either way, Nintendo made games that were simple fun and almost universally loved, and are therefore a rare untainted spot of sunlight in the unusually dark and shit stained hearts of 4chan.   I have played literally none of those games, but even I can appreciate the sadness these people are feeling over the passing of a man so dedicated to his craft long after he ""made it."""

If the trainer is a different person the owner will tell you who that is.  I returned one to a one-armed vet that almost cried. It was weird.

Cancer of the bile duct is a rare occurence, a patient has a better prognosis if a benign tumour is found in the duct. If his polyp was benign, the doctors could have left it there and it normally wouldn't cause problems (normally). Most polyps or growths are found in the GI tract, but if there is a growth in the bile duct, more than likely, it is cancerous and it is one of the hardest to treat and diagnose."

They came when they could - US also showed up in Europe Hitler already lost the war, but are quite willing to take credit for his defeat.   And if you don't think that rapid destruction of Japan's million plus army in the space of two weeks didn't have anything to do with the surrender, that's fine. All of it is arguable.

4chan,3d26e6,spankaway,3,Tue Jul 14 17:37:12 2015 UTC,"The exact figures are disputed, but everyone's numbers are in the 6 million ballpark.    The official Polish government report on war damages prepared in 1947 put Poland's war dead at 6,028,000; 3.0 million ethnic Poles and 3.0 million Jews not including losses of Polish citizens from the Ukrainian and Belarusian ethnic groups. This figure was disputed when the communist system collapsed by the Polish historian Czes≈Çaw ≈Åuczak who put total losses at 6.0 million; 3.0 million Jews, 2.0 million ethnic Poles, and 1.0 million Polish citizens from the other ethnic groups not included in the 1947 report on war damages.[2][3] In 2009 the Polish government-affiliated Institute of National Remembrance (IPN) published the study ""Polska 1939‚Äì1945. Straty osobowe i ofiary represji pod dwiema okupacjami"" (Poland 1939-1945. Human Losses and Victims of Repression Under the Two Occupations) that estimated Poland's war dead at between 5.6 and 5.8 million Poles and Jews, including 150,000 during the Soviet occupation.   ...   Most Polish citizens who perished in the war were civilian victims of the war crimes and crimes against humanity during the occupation by Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union. The Polish Institute of National Remembrance (IPN) estimates total deaths under the German occupation at 5,470,000 to 5.670,000 Jews and Poles,[7] 2,770,000 Poles,[8] 2.7 to 2.9 million Jews [9] According to IPN research there were also 150,000 victims of Soviet repression.[10]"

It was meant to kill all high Polish army officials so they would not get in the way when passing through Poland to Berlin. Unfortunately, Poland is in between Germany and Russia. Poland claims it to be a genocide with about 22,000 dead. Except, genocide was never on the mind of the Russians believe it or not. Russia states that if this is genocide then the soviet POW held near the USSR border is also genocide considering 16-20,00 died in those prisons. Its a long and tiring argument but it didn't help with Poles spewed conspiracy theories against the Russians when the plane crashed in Smolensk."

It is only natural that this would rouse greater Russian irredentism. Don't come crying like a little bitch afterwards. What is however a surprise is that the Soviets still chose to extend Poland until the Oder. They didn't have to do that, but now you reap the rewards.  And of course both Russia and the Soviet Union admitted responsibility for the Katyn massacres.  The problem Poland has with Russia is not that the Russians mistreated Poland. The real issue is that it was Russia, the historical rival, did what the Poles failed to do. Save Poland and its people."

The largest uprising against the nazis took place in Warsaw and was supposed to be helped by the soviets. Russian planes were 5 minutes from the city ready to give support but they didn't do shit since they were too busy fucking each other, Stalin wanted the poles to fight and weaken the Germans but not take the capital in Warsaw otherwise they would have a say in the treaty of Paris."

Not being fat is a matter of not eating more calories than you burn off.  Don't blame the food because you have no self-control.  To answer the question, foods high in calories taste good because in normal circumstances during our evolution, high-calorie foods were scarce, so we needed to know what was high in calories so we could eat enough calories to not die."

Their room are usually cramped, small, messy, everything they have is shitty old and possibly broken. The average NEET is definitely poorer than the average wage earner."

Just to clear a few things up, Muslims are just like anybody else, and they level to which they practice their values varies greatly on an individual level. Also.   Islamic values have a lot in common with original feminism, but there would be a lot of conflict with modern tumbler feminism. The 'obedient to husbands' thing is over simplified. Women are supposed to 'obey their husbands' but so are men supposed to 'obey their wives'. They almost certainly will not do anal. The Trustworthiness of any individual varies wildly regardless of religion. Contraceptives are allowed, but you are supposed to have a family when your circumstances are prepared. Quite possibly cannot cook or clean. A correctly groomed beard is actually a symbol of piety. That is correct. Hygiene is certainly a core value (and so is shaving your pubes -for both sexes).    Dealing with the virtues of Islam every day would be a bitch though.   I presume you mean the rituals? The virtues are quite simple and apart from those directly related to worship, you more than likely already believe in most of them yourself. It's the same with most other religions, the core values tend to be about being good to others (even if they are not always practiced)."

There's some neckbeard chart floating around that shows the divorce rate as a function of number of sexual partners a woman's had.  The rate is like 20% for virgins, and like 70% for 15+ partners.  I guess the neckbeards have some image in their head of a virgin damsel princess who's a size two with 34DDs and is heir to a kingdom, who just stays pure out of principle.  In actuality, the girls who are virgins are most likely not virgins by choice.

While the lead male talks about feelings and often doesn't get the girl the black character gets whatever he wants. That's what I mean by the teen nick cuckholding.

4chan,3d0gjy,Toastlove,26,Sun Jul 12 20:21:15 2015 UTC,"Mojo jojo is actually very thinly veiled portrait of a devout Muslim jihadist. It's more than just his turban-helmet.  Signs that Mojo is Muslim  1) he wants to conquer the world and enslave all of mankind to his ideas (he says this explicitly in the PPG movie). This is textbook Islam.  2) He keeps a clock by his bedside that very clearly resembles an Azan prayer clock, complete with its gold minaret.  3) His lair is filled with decor that resembles Islamic art/architecture Curtains and wallpaper are decorated with lines that mimic Islamic calligraphy - complete with the diacritical marks that are the hallmark of Arabic script  4) Islamic/Arabic sounding music is often played when he is on screen  5) Mojo sometimes will mumble unintelligible syllables, in a manner that strongly resemble a Muslim reciting the Quran.  6) To achieve his goal of conquering the world, Mojo often lies to the Girls and to the people of Townsville, just as Muslims are told to do, in accordance with Islamic doctrines of deception (kitman in Sunnism, taqiyya in Shiism), which stem from the hadith in which the prophet is said to have said ""War is deceit"".  7) Mojo, like devout Muslims, complain constantly of being oppressed, all while carrying out all kinds of evil.   The responses of the people of Townsville, the Mayor, and the Girls also strongly resemble the failed responses of Western governments to Islamic terrorism. The Mayor is scared all the time, and the Girls, who represent the power of the state, are naive about Mojo's design, just like the US government is about Islam.   You can only see and understand these things if you are politically informed about how Islam works, and how it causes its practitioners to behave."

It can viewed as biological or social, depending on who's talking. It gets murky with some people though, myself included, because the only synonym is ""sex"" and that's strictly biological and nobody ever argues that is used in reference to social constructs.   If you were born with a certain set of chromosomes, you're a dude. If you have the other set, you're a chick. People disagree, but that doesn't make the science behind it any less true."

But you don't need to correct someone every time they use the word in reference to sex, because it's a perfectly valid usage of the word. The context makes it obvious what /u/Anglan meant."

Wore pink once?  What about a skirt?  Nantucket red, that's like pink right?  Are you butch (if grill) or effeminate (guy) then you're transgendered.

They harbour special hatred for anyone they can perceive as a gender traitor, though, and in some amazing leap of logic have decided that trans men dominate all transgender-related conversations. The fact that the male/female ratio amongst trans people is close to even but most people think it's 99% female would like to disagree with them."

4chan,3cy7my,rawrnnn,29,Sun Jul 12 00:39:19 2015 UTC,I've talked with people in classes I've had who have said men can't be raped. One dude said a guy can't be raped because there's no chance for pregnancy. Someone immediately asked if he thought forcible sodomy on a woman wasn't rape either and he just said it was different when the victim is female.   One girl asked another time how a guy could possibly be raped since she doesn't think a dude can get hard in that circumstance. I don't think she considered sodomy on a dude as rape either or she just hadn't considered a dude raping another dude.   Tl:dr - some people are just stupid as fuck.

4chan,3cyc70,MrRedditUser420,17,Sun Jul 12 15:16:42 2015 UTC,"Sort of. Also because life over there is very family-centric and outward appearances matter a lot. Not to mention there are so many hierarchical factors in India besides just income. In the US, you wouldnt want your daughter getting serious with a guy with no education who works at KFC, right? Well over there, they also factor all this plus caste, the spouses family, the spouses family's education, the spouses star-sign, the spouses past history with marriages, etc etc. Whether your child loves the person he/she will marry comes nearly last.  This is also why we have a ton of ugly people. Arranged marriage is reaching its long arm into our gene pool, and pulling the 'manual override' lever on natural selection."

4chan,3cyc70,Kakarot_faps,2,Sun Jul 12 15:08:52 2015 UTC,"Most of these are down to cultural differences in how we treat people:   Indian guys never tip   Because, here in India, most places add a 10% 'service charge' to the bill (in addition to service taxes), and actively discourage tipping. Plus, by nature, we're cheap. We try to save money wherever possible, even if relatively well off. Tipping just isn't a thing here, and definitely not to the degree it is in Europe, or the States.   always talk down to me and my coworkers   Because you're there to 'serve' them, and therefore, in their eyes, inherently an inferior person.   get really upset over small things   This, again, is a way of asserting their position of power. "" I'm the customer here, and whatever I say goes "". It's about asserting superiority over 'the working class', which is seen as a 'lower' category of people here.   In most other countries, kids in their late teens begin taking up jobs to supplement their income, and eventually sustain themselves. So, they have a much more acute understanding of the fact that their server at a restaurant (for example) is just someone like them. They've all gone through a similar stage in life.  Here in India, we're supported by our parents until we graduate college and get a 'proper' office job, so that sense of entitlement stays with us, and leaves us prone to applying our 'working class' prejudices everywhere else as well.  EDIT: And I've just realized that I'm replying to a 4-day old comment. Awkward."

4chan,3cyc70,tiberius776,4,Sun Jul 12 14:26:09 2015 UTC,"More complicated than that. Living in a culture of scarcity makes people less generous, which in turn erodes trust. Basically, poverty fosters clan formation and isolation rather than a sense of community. That makes people feel less accountable when they harm others not in their circle, leading to douchier behavior. I suspect the lack of media and recreational activity in poor regions also contributes to the douchiness, since there is no exposure to a wider friendly society that would judge people for antisocial tendencies.   Also, living in filth and hunger would piss anybody off."

The world is leaving you behind and you feel as if the only avenue to hate on gays, immigrants and in general, your betters is the internet. It's OK, there's still a choice.  You don't Have to live in that basement for the rest of your days. You can end it. It will be the only real thing you will do, all your life. The greatest contribution you will have is to not consume any more. But, be nice about it. Don't do it pills or clean your mouth out with buck shot. Don't hang yourself. I doubt anything but 1"" steel rope can support you anyway and I don't like the chances of that cross beam either.  Don't make the paramedics and firefighters have to use the jaws of life on you to wrench you from the too narrow basement door. I assume they'll be called there because of the smell first. It's disgusting. You'll probably end up as a bloated corpse photograph on /r/wtf.  Go with some dignity. Strip off the nylon clothes and jump in the river with weights, so you end up as food for the fish and don't have a chance to be a coward and back out. Don't take your cheap clothes with you so they end up as undesirable accoutrements for large sea mammals.  Another way is suicide by cop. This is tricky. You have to make them believe that the butterball in front of them is actually a threat. So, have a live weapon and clean clothes, so you're taken seriously. I doubt you will be a threat even if you wanted to be, so don't worry about hurting them. They won't miss, you're at least 20 times the size of their standard firing range targets at 80 meters.  Last, don't bother leaving a letter. First, your prose doesn't look like it'll improve soon, and your fat digits probably can't work a pen enough for your writing look like anything legible. Second, no one in your life wants to read it. Your mom, I think she may have wanted to read it sometime, but it'll be just another disappointment in an entire life of disappoints. It'll be in some evidence locker somewhere for the rest of its days where no one will care.  Let me know, though, the general area where you live so I can check local news stories and obituaries to look for you or imagine one of the suicides to be you, and in that moment, you shall be my hero for ending what probably should have never started in the first place."

Even a dictatorship shithole with 1.3 billion people still manages to have quadruple your per capita gap, all with a lower Gini and higher HDI. Also, there are no mountains of garbage with children playing in sewage or corpses in rivers.

4chan,3cyc70,xcerj61,-4,Sun Jul 12 06:41:21 2015 UTC,"They do that by flooding your countries with cheap chinese crap. You buy it, and their economy is wealthier for it. But it is not sustainable. Pretty soon they'll have to produce real things and have people with real skills. Chinese people are generally unhappy, Beijing is a smog filled city, it has a dictatorship which is corrupt to its very core.   Also, there are no mountains of garbage with children playing in sewage or corpses in rivers.   Too right, you've been reading Chinese articles on India. They're killing unborn fetuses inside the mothers and incinerating them, people are jumping to their deaths because they can't work a 60 hour shift anymore. There's nothing you can't achieve if you throw ridiculously high amounts of human suffering at it. The Indian government is a democracy that doesn't believe in killing citizens or in war as a way to enrich the economy. In a country with over a billion people trickle down economics work rather slower, but the results are rather more permanent, as in the case of Europe.  There's a few thousand square miles of oil slick in the gulf and animals with opil slicks washing up on America's beaches. I'll say this about China and the USA, they have excellent sanitation. They hide their poverty rather better. People's tap water is flammable in some parts of America. You don't hear about those, because powerful lobbies suppress those stories. The Chinese will overtake the west as the number one economy soon, and soon after that, India will, because our economy is built on infrastructure, innovation and a skilled labour force. You can't manufacture your way into a strong economy, America tried that. Pretty soon, you have too many people with too much, expecting too much for too little work.  Have you seen New York City's underbelly? It festers like a rank wound, full of pus. Greatest city in the world, indeed. We should all be so lucky to have a terrorist attack to have that moniker."

4chan,3cz9a6,meantocows,-1,Sun Jul 12 20:20:48 2015 UTC,Yeah but just because Idaho has a 50th say in the president doesnt make it more relevant than Germany which has massive sway over all Europe.

4chan,3czb57,Benlarge1,3,Sun Jul 12 18:37:37 2015 UTC,"Actually Michael Jackson's song ""Beat It"" was originally about jacking off with Novocain.     The original lyrics were ""Beat it, beat it, you won't even have to feel it. It doesn't matter I say its right. Go to the dentist he'll do it just right. Just beat it, Just beat it...""   The only reason he changed his lyrics was his publishers were bible thumping christains and thought masturbation was a sin, so they forced him to rewrite the song."

Batfag thinks Riddler means that the congregation is happening in a pool. He says this means its a mass baptism, which is a religious meeting in a pool. And then he says the Riddler plans on being the minister to kidnap the congregation and use them for ransom.  Pretty clever to be honest."

4chan,3cwkxd,afganposter,2,Sat Jul 11 21:16:56 2015 UTC,"FWIW, the actual boring answer to the riddle is that the man stays on his side of the pool. If you say someone ""crosses"" a group, that can mean the person is pissing the group off. The person stays in the view of the poolful of hungry crocodiles but not where they can get to him. The man crosses the pool without being harmed by staying in their sight out of their reach."

4chan,3cwkxd,Avakar,1 point,Sat Jul 11 20:04:44 2015 UTC,"There's so much information left out, there's almost endless possible answers.  Doesn't say how deep the pool is, or what it's made of. You could say it's a deep bog, but since you don't, he could walk across a shallow concrete pool in a suit of armor.  Doesn't say the person's not carrying anything. You could say he's got nothing but the clothes on his back, but since you don't, he could feed the alligators, or simply distract them, with meat.  Doesn't say the person isn't already familiar with the alligators. You could say the man reached this pool by accident while exploring, but since you don't, he could be their trainer, and they know if they don't bite him they'll get fed soon.  Doesn't say he ever enters the pool. You could say he wades through the pool, but since you don't, he could have just crossed a foot bridge that goes over the pool.  Doesn't say how big the pool is, or where the alligators are in relation to the man. You could say it's a small pool, but since you don't, he could be crossing a massive pool where the alligators don't have enough time to actually reach him because they're out on the far edges.  Yes, some of these are a bit of a stretch for a riddle, but given the information present, those are all viable solutions."

Japan meat was banned for import but that was lifted in 2012 and now you can have authentic Wagyu/Kobe in the USA.  However price is extremely expensive. One local restaurant offers the beef and the cheapest in the menu is a $200 extremely small meal. They would even prove that its authentic by showing you papers like deliveries and etc. So I can understand OP why he beat the living shit out of his kid(if its true).

After some badass previews of a new Die Hard, RoboCop, and a redo (not reboot) to the 3rd live action Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles movie, we see a view of the beautiful nightlife of New York city and the screen slowly starts to focus on a group of kids reenacting Michael Jacksons ""Bad"" and in the middle of it the music stops and the real ghost of Michael Jackson (who is flailing a baby at them by the leg) pops out of nowhere and scares the shit out of all the children. The music resumes and diminuendos as you see the children being chased and the screen pans out and focuses on the only window with the lights on in a tall building. As the camara closes in on the window you realize that there is a person looking out the window and you hear a woman's nasally voice ask ""whats all that racket out there?"" To which Rick Moranis responds ""I think I just saw Condoleezza Rice chase some children. New York is so wierd now."" Rick Moranis turns away from the window and starts to walk towards the couch in the living room and you see Annie Potts sitting there with a bowl of popcorn in front of a tv and asks ""Weirder than being turned into a demonic dog?"" Moranis laughs as he tries to sit next to her all sauve but his elbow slipps off the back edge of the couch and makes Potts drop the popcorn all over the floor. They both in as adorably dorky as possible apologize to each other and they both rush to the floor to try to clean up the mess and at some point they pause and stare into each other's eyes and they begin to slowly move in for a kiss when BAM! Slimer pops up from underneath the floor and decides to cock block Moranis by stealing his kiss. Hilarity ensues as a pissed of Moranis starts to capture Slimer with the popcorn bowl and ""Bad"" starts to play again. Potts, chill as a boss, calmly watches the chaos and slowly reaches into her purse and pulls out a small yellow and black striped electronic device and REVERSE BAM! Slimer is caught, Potts makes a remark about the new redesigned ghost traps and we look back at Moranis covered in slime infront of a now destroyed living room. Camera zooms in on his face and his only response is ""Will you excuse me, I have to make a call"" and then the screen turns black and while the screen is black you hear Potts ask ""Who are you going to call?""  ""The Ghostbusters.""   THE GHOSTBUSTERS LOGO POPS CENTER SCREEN, TRIPPLE BAM! STANDING OVATION FROM EVERYONE IN THE MOVIE THEATER!"

4chan,3cvztd,rawrnnn,26,Sat Jul 11 15:51:58 2015 UTC,No one is threatened.  Everyone is disappointed and angry.  Disappointed that they are rebooting a classic.  Angry at the poor choice of lead roles.  This is regardless of the gender of those roles.  The fact that there are doing this as a flagrant pandering to feminists certainly doesn't help the film's credibility.

4chan,3ctam2,TheCuntDestroyer,5,Sat Jul 11 01:08:07 2015 UTC,I had this realization on dating sites. I used it for a month or so as a straight man and got nothing. Then I switched over to just gay and was inundated with messages.
4chan,3ctam2,stridernfs,6,Sat Jul 11 01:09:50 2015 UTC,"Reason:   gay guys aren't slut shamed the same way women are if they are promiscuous so they can message all they like. You would get the same effect changing your online dating profile to be a female. Straight women are used to not having to be the one who initiated the flirting, usually..."
4chan,3ctam2,Invisible_toothbrush,8,Sat Jul 11 04:26:08 2015 UTC,"Yeah slut shaming is stupid, but I don't think slut shaming comes into the equation when women are ignoring just friendly messages that aren't asking to have sex. I never asked for sex as a startup conversation from straight females or gay males, and there were more males wanting to have a conversation because they mostly got conversations about sex.  Women just do not have to try when it comes to finding dates."

4chan,3ctam2,monsda,3,Sat Jul 11 01:03:55 2015 UTC,I dunno. I find lots of guys irresistibly hot and most girls don't find them attractive really at all. The standards for women ARE way higher than gay men. Basically just have a cute face and don't be fat and gays will be all over you.

Of course that doesn't fucking matter cause that's not how you solve something like that.  > x2 + 2x - 3 = 0  > (x - 1) (x + 3) = 0  > (x - 1) = 0 AND (x + 3) = 0  > x=1 AND x=-3  Just use your brain and pick the right solution.

4chan,3cs6gm,Ein326,78,Fri Jul 10 17:01:32 2015 UTC,"I've actually spent quite a long time analyzing the story.  GTAV is the first game in the series where the single player narrative and gameplay are fundamentally intertwined.  As an example- in other GTA games, the characters resolve the ending by simply killing all their enemies and winning. And this ending still does come up in option ""C"", to a degree.  But, follow the story arcs, and you have a washed-up alcoholic bank robber who learns yoga and how to reconnect with his family through peaceful conflict resolution, a young black man who has realized the hollowness and futility espoused by ""gangster"" lifestyle, and an entrepreneurial psychopath who has come to realize that he now lives in a world where there's no real place for people like him anymore. In every single possible interpretation of the game, one of the points being driven home is that the old ways are over."
4chan,3cs6gm,Ad__Hominem,45,Fri Jul 10 17:20:19 2015 UTC,"In every single possible interpretation of the game, one of the points being driven home is that the old ways are over.   I agree with you full heartedly, but a point you seem to miss is the rampant hypocrisy in the game. Micheals wife blames him for their dysfunctional family while she openly cheats on him and has numerous affairs, which does more to destroy the family than anything micheal has done."
4chan,3cs6gm,Ein326,24,Fri Jul 10 18:54:22 2015 UTC,"I've noticed you've made several comments about Michael's wife being the catalyst for the problems of the game.  That's simply not true. While I'm not going to excuse her infidelity, the game makes it overwhelmingly clear that Michael self-destructed the relationship entirely on his own. He was having multiple affairs before the start of the game, and withdrawn from associating with his family. She was definitely making things worse, but he was the root cause of the problem.  And, it was his own choice to get back into the game. He was looking for an excuse, any excuse, to get back into the game. And Franklin served it to up him by framing him as a hero."
4chan,3cs6gm,Ad__Hominem,2,Fri Jul 10 19:09:48 2015 UTC,"He was having multiple affairs before the start of the game,   Wait, what? I don't remember this ever being mentioned..."

4chan,3cs6gm,Ad__Hominem,4,Fri Jul 10 22:39:31 2015 UTC,"Literally every problem the characters in the game have stems from them doing stupid 'guy' stuff.  Sure, it's about heists and corruption but so much of it has to do with guys feeling like they have to be men."

One night I'm playing and as I walk out of my apartment I'm instantly gunned down. Great, this shit. Alright, respawn, and killed again by the same guy. I spawn again, get on a bike, and get away before I get killed again. I don't really pay attention to where I'm going, and end up at the top of the map.  I'm still cruising on my bike when I get sniped. That guy from my apartment followed me all the way to the top of the map just to kill me. And again, and again, and again. Then he turns on his mic and says hi. I didn't have a mic in, but he keeps going. He starts saying that I look hot, and I have a nice ass, and he wants to meet me so he can touch me. All while continuing to kill me.  Then it dawns on me that he thinks I'm actually a girl. So I plug my mic in and give him the bad news. The guy quit out of the game after that."

The entrance would be similar to Fallout NV, except you are violently raped with a bag over your head, ribs broken, and jaw smashed, then shot and dumped into a drainage ditch. You claw your way out like Batman and plot revenge, using stealth and absolute ruthlessness. Laying Jigsawesque traps and paying off sluts to seduce your enemies while you sneak in and go at them with a knife would be just a couple features."

A short bald man with a limp came around the corner and directed us to the party. Our friend was playing with a local music collective like he did in those days, and the night started when I blew poorly-crushed ritalin out of a folded one-dollar bill with another 1-dollar bill. Now ritalin sucks, regardless of how you take it--it's a fact--but when you rail small stones of it out of a dirty bill in a room covered in strangely-vaginal paintings, it sucks more."

And serial killers' victims vary chronologically, which differentiates them from both mass murderers and spree killers. Unless you it's love murph and fuck shit up a second time at the same time in the same place--in which case idk m8."

4chan,3cpwxt,or_some_shit,3,Fri Jul 10 02:02:09 2015 UTC,"Wait, how does a massless photon have momentum? Isn't that a function of mass and velocity? Or is it just being a wave?"
4chan,3cpwxt,a_monkeys_head,3,Fri Jul 10 02:51:58 2015 UTC,"Yes, classically that is how you define momentum. If a photon has an energy, E (and we know you can get energy from E = mV2 / 2) then you can simply divide out one of the velocities (in this case, the speed of light, c) to get the expression for momentum p = E/c.  However, the expression p = mV is not meaningful to photons because of... reasons. The best way to describe it is that: you know it takes energy to accelerate an object up to a certain speed (inertia, things resist changes in motion). The heavier an object is the more energy required to bring it up to a certain speed. You could then extend that logic to the speed of light, the maximum speed that any tangible thing moves as far as we know. It would essentially require an infinite amount of energy to accelerate an object with any mass to that speed, so we are comfortable theorizing that photons have energy, momentum, but not any mass.   I'm sure you could find threads in /r/AskScience which would put my attempted explanation to shame."

Everything is just a bit too slick and clean in new CGI and it detracts from the realism, but I assure you, the CGI itself is probably leagues better, just over-utiised. In older movies the environments looked a lot more like when you step outside, but now they're all amazing unreal spectacles, some people like this more, some less."

As someone who is a scientist who studies crows, I am telling you, specifically, in science, no one calls jackdaws crows. If you want to be ""specific"" like you said, then you shouldn't either. They're not the same thing.  If you're saying ""crow family"" you're referring to the taxonomic grouping of Corvidae, which includes things from nutcrackers to blue jays to ravens.  So your reasoning for calling a jackdaw a crow is because random people ""call the black ones crows?"" Let's get grackles and blackbirds in there, then, too.  Also, calling someone a human or an ape? It's not one or the other, that's not how taxonomy works. They're both. A jackdaw is a jackdaw and a member of the crow family. But that's not what you said. You said a jackdaw is a crow, which is not true unless you're okay with calling all members of the crow family crows, which means you'd call blue jays, ravens, and other birds crows, too.

He wished so much that he had a gun to shoot himself from embarrassment, but he himself had petitioned against them!  The students applauded and all registered Republican that day and accepted Jesus as their lord and savior. An eagle named ‚ÄúSmall Government‚Äù flew into the room and perched atop the American Flag and shed a tear on the chalk. The pledge of allegiance was read several times, and God himself showed up and enacted a flat tax rate across the country.  The professor lost his tenure and was fired the next day. He died of the gay plague AIDS and was tossed into the lake of fire for all eternity.  Semper Fi."
4chan,3coxyi,thipp,3,Thu Jul 9 23:25:04 2015 UTC,"Dude you need to quit fucking snap chatting mckenna. Stop. She doesn't respond with anything meaningful for a reason and she's not interested in you. Who am I? The man whom she is in love with. She already told me not to worry, she's not interested in you. Sorry I bothered you kid. I've dated her since 2 summers ago. If you aren't trying to get at my woman or being inappropriate I don't care if you snap her occasionally. Just don't try anything man. You'll embarrass yourself and anger me. We are in love and we're making love tomorrow. So if you have any ill intentions with my woman you can forget it right now. I'm the biggest and best she's ever had, only man she's ever loved and the only man who could truly satisfy her physically. You will never have her. And she loves me. I don't have any problems with you if you are over my woman and realize you will never be with or touch her again. I apologize for coming off as a dick, just me and kenna are really deep in love and we've been through a lot and I just moved back home and it makes me a little jealous and angry to see a man she used to date before me is snap chatting her.... We don't need any extra bullshit or drama right now, so don't bring us any please is all I ask friend. If you try to talk to her any way but as a brother, or you try to see her at all, if she tells me you do anything inappropriate or anything outside of what a strict brother like friend would do,we are going to have a huge problem. I will leave you alone now dude if you're not trying to get at the woman who I love and whom is in love with me. That entire summer she was with me. She left kyle for me. She's been with me ever since, she even loved me and made love to me before she EVER let anything happen with you. You didn't please her. She didn't have strong feelings for you at all. And she immediately ended shit with you for me once she knew I loved her too. So get any ideas of the past out of your head. None of this truth should bug you if you're over her but I'm just making sure. I hate when my baby's friends have ill intentions and she thinks they are just friends and have no alternative motive. But idk if I trust you at all. If I can trust you to not stress me and my baby or fuck with our love tell me. I will leave you alone and apologize. But if you aren't over her and you're tryna ""get some"" or you're tryna get back in her life, it's NOT HAPPENING. She said you were nothing to her, and the sex was bad anyway haha. You're small and weak and she said it all felt wrong after being with me. She's been with me ever since. We're in love. And tomorrow me and her will be together in my room making love alll day how we always have together. If you have a problem speak up like a man or tell me our love doesn't bug you and I'll apologize, it's simple. So??? What is it? You are after my woman then huh?! Tell me the fucking truth man. Don't you dare be disrespectful and gross enough to bring it up, but if if you ask her about anything she shared with me about your weak ass, she may be nice and lie to you, or she may not care and tell you the truth. Either way. I'm her soullmate and her boyfriend of the past two years almost. And she tells me everything and NEVER lies to me. I don't care haha. Just stay away from my kenna. I sincerely apologize if you have no ill intentions and aren't trying to make moves with my woman. And i respect you as a guy in the service. I'm sure you're an ok dude. But just as a friend. You're nothing to my kenna but a brother like friend. I just wanna be sure you know it and don't forget it. Find a nice classy woman where you are stationed, marry her.... But back off of mine. You will never even compare to me in her eyes. Not even close haha.I just don't need you interfering with me and kenna's love. It's our lives man. It's really not cool.... Goodbye man, good luck. Respect to you being in the service. Sorry to bring your day down with my crazy bullshit but. Me and kenna are head over heels.... I can't help but be crazy about her. I love her with all of my heart and I will protect her from her untrustworthy fake friends. Not saying you are one. But you're dodging telling me what's going on in your head so I'm questioning a lot right now. Just know I'm never gonna hurt her, I'm always going to have her back, I'd give my life for her without hesitation, and I will protect her from anything, everything, and anyone. She is the love of my life. I fully intend to marry and give kenna my children. And we've talked a lot about it. Just don't make shit harder than it already is. I just moved back and me and her miss eachother so badly and we are FINALLY go to see eachother tomorrow and make love for the first time since halloween.... I hope you don't hate me man. I'm a good dude. Just protective of the woman who holds my heart. And who's heart I hold and must protect. I hope you can understand. She promised me there's nothing at all to worry about with you and that she's not interested:""/ I wish I knew before I embarrassingly went off on you. I'm so sorry man. I'm sorry. Please don't mention this to my baby:/ I'm really embarrassed and while she will understand, I just feel like an ass for attacking you when you have nothing with my kenna and no intention to. Good bye brother. I hope you find your one true love someday. It'll make you crazy, trust me, but you'll find her one day. I found mine when I was really young. And it's my kenna :)"

If people don't feel like they have a purpose in life or can't have fun amongst themselves or with others, then what's the point of living? Emotions and desires make life meaningful, so to deny those pleasures is to strip away man's right to enjoy himself on a fundamental level."

Anyway absolute dumbest shit I ever did was let these guys talk me into smoking their jank ass home-cooked synthetic weed (they called it Jdubs). I took one hit and it felt like my brain split down the middle and started melting, and then my body started folding and collapsing in on itself like if you were to hold up a marionette puppet and then drop it over and over again. This is just me sitting on a couch. I don't remember a ton after that but I like physically wasn't able to think anymore and had to be babysat.

4chan,3cnr3p,carlsaischa,11,Thu Jul 9 21:53:10 2015 UTC,"You've never used arrays? I mean, knowledge of pointers is pretty essential for operations on arrays, and I would imagine that you would use them quite extensively in physics, for storing similar data in a neat way with easy access."

4chan,3cnr3p,Phrygue,6,Thu Jul 9 16:23:18 2015 UTC,"Arrays are pointers in C. Basically an array is just a pointer to the first element in it. Accessing an array like array[0] is the same as *array.

4chan,3cnr3p,henno13,3,Fri Jul 10 11:20:01 2015 UTC,"Still need computer to do full explanation.   Quick and dirty: memory address is a literal location in memory, like 0xff503a00. A pointer is a number that holds a memory address. Pointers take up space on the stack, and can be allocated to the heap.  A reference, much like a pointer is a number which contains a memory address the primary difference between the two is that a reference shares the same memory address as the original variable even though it also takes up space on the stack. Pointers can be reassigned, references cannot be, pointers can be changed with ++ and -- to iterate over arrays, references can't.   Both can be allocated to the heap.   My original comment was how hard this is to explain to someone not technical.   Edit: also a pointer has its own address as well, it's a number sort of like an int but its size is defined by the computer's architecture."
4chan,3cnr3p,OwlVision,2,Fri Jul 10 21:53:21 2015 UTC,"I understand where you're coming from, in saying that a memory address is different from a pointer.

As someone who for the longest time only wrote Java and kind of felt bad about it, once you get to know other languages (C/C++, Python, Haskell, Bash, PHP) you realize that they're all kind of the same.  Good programming practices will never become outdated. Hell, C is still the backbone of most of our operating systems, and that's been true for decades."

However, I just wanted to say that you're afraid of learning something outdated is the wrong way to look at it completely.   Firstly, C was developed in the 70s, and it's still one of the most popular languages today. Leading on to my next point, many languages are fundamentally similar. If you learn Java, you can easily go use that to learn C and vice versa, the syntax itself is very similar and the fundamental workings are exactly the same, same with C# (which is essentially an MS Java clone with nicer features), C++, Python, whatever. Programming is a transferable skill. Once you are proficient in one language, it's very easy to move between them."
4chan,3cnr3p,Icypixel,2,Thu Jul 9 22:45:39 2015 UTC,"My personal recommendation is to start with Java.

I only watched a couple episodes but I didn't see a single attempt at making a joke in the whole show. It was just his panel of far left bloggers and sjw types regurgitating the majority leftist opinion on the topic of the day to huge claps and cheers from the audience. They must be using applause and laughter signs for that show because anytime they said anything at all the audience burst into applause and laughter often before they even finish saying a single sentence.   typical nightly show  panel with blogger bertha lovejoy, rolling stone journalist David Everjewstein, rapper Jamal Rapkins and last but not least Some other black guy  I think killing black people and racism is wrong  Cheers and whistling  Well the problem is just that cops and government are killing black people and they're racist and it's bad  even larger cheers and applause  It's really the while privileged male patriarchy, constantly oppressing women and minorities  The audience is in a frenzy of clapping and buzzing agreement  TIME TO KEEP IT 100  Are you Racist at all?  no.  audience cheers  YOU KEPT IT 100!!   Worst replacement for Colbert imaginable. Should have given Colbert's slot to Rob Riggle but they didn't want to be a part of patriarchal white privilege rape culture so they gave it to a black guy who did one 3 minute segment for daily show every 6-8 months and wasn't doing much else with his career."

While it is true that criminal will have access to gun, it will make it more expensive and difficult to do so.

Well, needless to say, I was out of action. A bunch of other insurgents started swarming to my location, so I pulled out my KABAR and shanked one of those dirty sand niggers right in the throat, but while this was happening some other Hadji got ahold of my AUG and the fresh mag that I dropped when the sniper nailed me. He loaded it up and tagged me twice in the right lung before I pulled out my Deagle and returned fire as he was squeezing off a third shot. My .50 slug obliterated his gray matter and his third round pierced my left ventricle. Most people would have died, but I just did the mash, I did the monster mash."

4chan,3cfh2w,stewmberto,26,Tue Jul 7 18:38:51 2015 UTC,"how come wizards sometimes have to actively say made up latin words to cast spells, but other times they don't have to say anything?"

4chan,3cfh2w,reddy97,11,Tue Jul 7 19:35:27 2015 UTC,In Order of the Phoenix it's explained that you can cast spells by thinking the words rather than saying them if you're good enough at magic.
4chan,3cfh2w,quaellaos,6,Tue Jul 7 20:46:35 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure it depends on their power level.

In the book, he uses it to repair his own broken wand, then decides to keep it (without using it) until his death, at which point its power should break.  EDIT: Forgot he actually placed it in Dumbledore's tomb."
4chan,3cfh2w,NewThink,76,Wed Jul 8 04:52:32 2015 UTC,He actually put the wand back in Dumbledores coffin in the end. He never actually kept it.
4chan,3cfh2w,mastersword130,37,Wed Jul 8 00:39:13 2015 UTC,"Yup. For the nerds out there, harry states that if he 'keeps it, without being defeated', then it will lose it's power (for whomever grabs it next). So what harry does is put the wand in Dumbledore's coffin (to hide it), yet he 'kept it' until death (as the last & undefeated owner)."

He could have just taken off the invisibility cloak and greeted  death like an old friend like Ignotus Pervell did when he felt ready to die.

4chan,3cfh2w,Tommy2255,14,Tue Jul 7 18:13:48 2015 UTC,"There was definitely a part in one of the books where someone cast a spell while holding two or three wands in one hand.

4chan,3cfh2w,najodleglejszy,28,Tue Jul 7 21:42:15 2015 UTC,Aren't the spells they cast without wands less powerful? And is apperating a spell or an ability? You don't need to hold the wand to do that right?
4chan,3cfh2w,bacchic_ritual,44,Tue Jul 7 17:51:08 2015 UTC,"well the wand lit up, so he technically used the wand, but without holding it. it was probably close enough to be in range of his magic aura or some shit like that. and yeah, Ollivander mentioned that a skilled wizard can channel his powers through whatever he wants, but the best results are achieved by using your own personalized special tailored to you iWand.  I'm not sure about wand/apparate thing. in Deathly Hallows Ron tried apparating without the wand, but it's hard to tell why exactly he failed. it was in Malfoy Manor's cellar and Luna mentioned it was escape-proof, but we don't know how would it go if it was somewhere else. anyway, Ron was just a big walking ginger failure when it came to apparate anywhere, even with his wand."

Tumblr obviously got a panic attack, and a rumour spread about a girl getting so ""triggered"" she killed herself (irl she closed her macbook and went downstairs). Moot took down /pol/ briefly until the rumours died down."

4chan,3cdeq5,TheRealSpoder,2,Tue Jul 7 17:09:32 2015 UTC,"I find that home schoolers are either really smart and creative, really dumb, or really sheltered. In our co-op we had plenty of smart kids who have gone on to do some pretty neat stuff. We had plenty of kids with some sort of autism who were being coddled by their mothers or who were just plain dumb because they didn't put forth any effort into learning. And we had plenty of kids who were home schooled because their parents were very political/religious, which is the worst kind of home schooling.  The sheltering really comes down to the parents, just like every other example of shitty child rearing. There are tons of people who go to public school who are incredibly sheltered as well (Mormon kids, for example). It's definitely easier to be sheltered when you're home schooled, but home schooling absolutely isn't the cause. I think home schooling worked out for me, but it doesn't work out for everyone. It really depends on the kid and the parents and should be decided on a case-by-case basis, which is why I never recommend people home school their kids, even if it worked well for me."

I'm probably somewhere between the smart ones and the autistic ones. One one hand I wrote a string quartet that got performed at 15, on the other hand, I screenshotted the results of an autism quiz I took online (for a 4chan thread) which surprisingly seems to think I have autism.   http://i.imgur.com/IkOhekw.png  Though I don't really have autism, I am pretty much as antisocial as one could get and I think homeschooling may have contributed to that as well as the smartness."

4chan,3cct16,hellbender,24,Tue Jul 7 03:36:00 2015 UTC,I guess that depends on each of your individual satisfactions with your current state of affairs.
4chan,3cct16,WE_ID,43,Tue Jul 7 07:14:11 2015 UTC,only have sex once a week or week and half   His wife is enjoying her affair.
4chan,3cct16,Coltrane23,71,Tue Jul 7 12:10:24 2015 UTC,"It's normal for some. If you don't feel satisfied just talk to your wife about it.  Say something like ""if I'm not going to get it from you, I'll find it somewhere else.""  She'll think it's funny and studies show that a sense of humor is a turn on for women. Trust me, I'm from the internet."
4chan,3cct16,iameveryoneelse,34,Tue Jul 7 12:30:18 2015 UTC,"Yes. Ultimatums always work. You should bring another girl home and tell your wife she can join if she likes. That way your relationship with your wife will be better than ever.   Source: Me, 18 yo with no girlfriend."
4chan,3cct16,louis9612,7,Tue Jul 7 13:21:08 2015 UTC,"Well there isn't really a normal. It just depends how much both of you want to fuck. If you are both satisfied, then don't worry about it."
4chan,3cct16,kpyle,7,Tue Jul 7 13:57:47 2015 UTC,There are two variables. Are you satisfied? Is your wife satisfied? If the answer to both is yes then keep doing what you're doing. If the answer to one or both is no then something needs to change usually.
4chan,3cct16,Iramadance,13,Tue Jul 7 17:10:35 2015 UTC,"If you both have low sex drives, then yes it's normal.   If you have normal sex drives, then not really.

4chan,3cct16,MeaterBeaterEater,2,Tue Jul 7 19:25:41 2015 UTC,"Eh, that's pretty normal. Essentially you're both working a full-time job, and kids can cause all sorts of extra stress and problems at the most random times and dominate your lives (Again, that's normal).   As long as you're making an effort to satisfy her emotionally and physically, and taking at least decent care of yourself, you should be good."
4chan,3cct16,m15wallis,1 point,Tue Jul 7 15:29:38 2015 UTC,"It's all relative. In every relationship, there's a High-Desire Partner (HDP) and a Low-Desire Partner (LDP). In one relationship, you could be the HDP if you wanted to have sex every day, whereas your partner didn't; in another relationship, you could be the LDP if your partner wanted to have sex twice a day, while you were still comfortable with once a day. Understanding this, the idea of there being a ""normal"" amount of sex, or thinking that there is a certain number of times per week a couple must keep up to be ""healthy"", doesn't really make sense - no matter what magazines like Cosmo says. Whatever your level of sexual activity, as long as you and your partner are happy, then I say good job - you have a healthy relationship that works.  Also - the above situation is the exception, not the rule. Most couples will have some intimacy / sex related issues eventually. These kinds of problems are normal - so don't sweat it when you encounter them. A resource I found helpful is this book"

We had a small-ish server, a Vent server, and we'd map out projects to work on when we could. Built two or three huge PVP arenas, infinite obsidian generators, sky-castles, hellevators, the works.  One of my bros mods /r/entgaming with me so we figured we'd put the server info in the sidebar and maybe some other people would want to pop in, dick around, maybe try out the arenas and shit. It was a pretty small sub back then (still isn't very big) so we didn't figure much would happen.  After a day, a dude showed up, looted all our shit, and dynamited every last goddamn thing. My other friend, who was running the server, of course didn't have a backup for the world because he's a fucking genius.  I didn't feel much like playing after that."

4chan,3cbnnd,dilplunk,5,Tue Jul 7 00:45:07 2015 UTC,His financial breakdown he produced at his presidential run announcement showed he has around 300 million liquid cash and the rest is tied in various holdings and projected value of business agreements. Among that list and large line items at that were clothing and miss America related stuff but I'm sure those pageants and clothes are worth a lot less now that he's lost major distribution channels tv and macys.

4chan,3cbnnd,accesiviale,1 point,Tue Jul 7 01:40:23 2015 UTC,Most businessmen don't have much in liquid cash holding. He's a real estate investor and evaluator so it makes sense that most of his wealth is tied up in those assets.

Full siblings can actually share anywhere from 0-100% of the same chromosomes but because of the law of averages and the large sample space statistically they are 50% related on average.  Therefore half-siblings share only 25% of their chromosomes (again on average, it could be anywhere from 0-50%) from their one common parent. In this case the size of the population is somewhat irrelevant because no matter how big it is the gene pool is still 25% composed of the same chromosomal material - more than enough opportunity for homozygosity of deleterious recessive traits to occur with relative frequency."
4chan,3cbnnd,demalition90,4,Tue Jul 7 21:46:53 2015 UTC,"You're right, my mistake it's 25%. Still inbreeding and still a huge risk for recessive diseases and traits."
4chan,3cbnnd,Tomazim,0,Wed Jul 8 02:18:32 2015 UTC,"The difference is there's a whole island of women who are not closely related and that variance is plenty enough to keep the population healthy. See Genghis Khan, small islands/african tribes, and other examples such as the unknown event scientists trace in our genetics that indicates at one point we almost went extinct (AKA very small breeding pool, ~100K for the whole world)  People seem to overestimate the effects of inbreeding and also seem to assume that the entire island will suddenly be a home for incest, rather than just going about sexuality like they did before."

That only helps if you assume that the first generation of children are growing up and then breeding with each others mothers. I guess it's possible? That would definitely be the best way to avoid a genetic shitshow within a few generations.   People seem to overestimate the effects of inbreeding    It's hard to overestimate the effects of an entire population of half-siblings breeding with each other. It's very different than something like Genghis Khan, who was bringing new people/women into the pool from everywhere he went. His children weren't breeding with each other. Take a look at some of the European royal families of the past to get an idea of what would happen, but magnified."
4chan,3cbnnd,demalition90,1 point,Tue Jul 7 07:08:03 2015 UTC,Please explain because I'm under the assumption that if their father is the same then genetic disorders with occur.
4chan,3cbnnd,JACrazy,1 point,Tue Jul 7 11:25:31 2015 UTC,"Pretty much the reason we don't inbreed is because if you have similar genes it is more likely that a unwanted recessive gene will come about, and after awhile it can lead to serious defects. However contrary to popular belief this doesn't happen in 1 or two generations, it can take quite a while and a very small breeding pool before it becomes a significant problem. With OP's plan there would be a whole island of women who are not related to each other and as long as sisters aren't marrying their children off to each other it should be fine.  For proof look at how many people are related to Genghis Khan, or look at small island cultures with small populations. or even isolated African tribes.  So TL;DR yeah if the whole island decided having the same dad meant it's ok to go full incest maybe they would be freaks after a couple hundred years, but they wouldn't."

For proof look at how many people are related to Genghis Khan, or look at small island cultures with small populations. or even isolated African tribes.   First off, Ghenkis Khan simply impregnated a lot of women. There is no evidence that his children were all sleeping with each other, like in OP's situation. There's a big difference between breeding with cousins and breeding with half-siblings. Neither is ideal, but half-siblings share 25% of their genetic material. OP's situation would be a disaster very quickly."

Like everyone of us has black genes, because somewhere along the lines some of your ancestors had sex with black people, or with someone who had sex with black people etc.  Like you have an exponential amount of ancestors (ignoring incest).  Given 800 years ago when Genghis Khan lived you fill it about 32 generations (every 25 years) which would mean you have about 4 billion ancestors. (232)  Among those 4 billion people, one having some genes from Genghis Khan is likely and thus you might trace back to him as well. Even though it is highly diluted by that point."
4chan,3cbnnd,Orsonius,1 point,Tue Jul 7 09:34:52 2015 UTC,"No, it's not like his genes always distribute. Some die off. Some are diluted and disappear. And most just intermingle in the same populations. It's not he whole world. There have been studies on it. A lot of studies on it"

I can link to articles about them. Here is what we think about Khan. And it's even less than the 2% I mentioned. Taken from wiki:  "" Zerjal et al. (2003)¬†identified a¬†Y-chromosomal lineage¬†present in about 8% of the¬†men¬†in a large region of¬†Asia¬†(about 0.5% of the world total). The paper suggests that the pattern of variation within the¬†lineage¬†is consistent with a hypothesis that it originated in¬†Mongolia¬†about 1,000¬†years¬†ago, and thus several generations prior to the birth of Genghis. Such a spread would be too rapid to have occurred by¬†genetic drift, and must therefore be the result of¬†selection. The authors propose that the lineage is carried by likely male-line descendants of Genghis Khan and his close male relatives, and that it has spread through social selection due to the power that Genghis Khan and his direct descendants held and a society which allowed one man to have many children through having multiple wives and widespread rape in conquered cities.

4chan,3cb1ov,CJ090,29,Mon Jul 6 18:39:40 2015 UTC,is this not normal? If my friend touches my dick I freak out but its not like he was trying to jack me off
4chan,3cb1ov,MCI21,59,Mon Jul 6 19:51:49 2015 UTC,"It's normal for American boys who are unsure of or uncomfortable with their sexuality and who are bombarded with non-stop gay stuff all over the media, especially with all the court stuff that's been going on for the past few years. It's a simple exploration of sexuality and boundaries.   In a country like Nigeria, where homosexuality is outlawed, you will see a lot less of it; there is little room to explore when something can get you life in jail. I'm sure there is still stuff going on in private between younger boys, as I'm sure many of us experienced (and rarely admit).   It is definitely weird, though, especially past college age when most people have fully figured out their sexuality. If you are 25 and still grabbing your friend's dick as a joke, well... I don't even know."

Football team starts heckling us as soccer fairies, pussies, fags. Football coaches are laughing, soccer coach too pussy to do anything. I go to the fence and say, ""Do you guys know what gay means?

4chan,3cb1ov,El_Spacho,16,Tue Jul 7 00:22:20 2015 UTC,"I used to campaign, really hard, that if you have the ability to suck your own dick, it doesn't make you gay. My reasoning behind this was that it's not considered gay to give yourself a handjob (fap) so the same reasoning should apply to giving yourself a blowjob. I would argue that if you agree that that giving another man a handjob is gay and yourself not, you have to give the same logic to the oral type (gay to someone else, not gay to yourself). HOWEVER. I have taken a massive u turn. It is gay to suck yourself off. When normal fapping, you are fapping and looking at something else i.e lesbian porn or a girl getting fucked hard (for straight fags). U are not really thinking about that nice firm penis and rubbing it softly. However when sucking ur own dick, u not looking at something else and only thinking about sucking hard cock. Gay"

Gay     wrong, pic related    it hurts your back at first but after a few nights stretching then you got a good technique down, wrapping your legs behind your neck is the perfect position but that takes a while to perfect due to the stretching etc so you can use your arms to pull your legs down and that helps arch your back and pull your dick closer to your mouth, I focus on the hetrosexual porn on my screen and it's not gay at all bro"

Getting a guy to become your cumslut fuckwhore means dominating them so completely that you remove them from all competition and removing their very masculinity. There was a kid we used to pick on in Secondary School who decided to 'transition' after school. I started talking to him on facebook and met up with him at christmas. I took him on a date and treated him like a women, and eventually we went back to his flat. I treated him like a complete cockwhore, and after a few hours of rough fucking I started full on beating the shit out of him, calling him a faggot and saying he should kill himself. I left him in a puddle of sweat, cum and his own blood and took a picture which I sent to a few of my buddies and we all had a good laugh.  That's not gay, that's just alpha."

As well since we are working with two digit numbers it would make sense to work in mod 100. In that case every two digit number is every other numbers additive inverse (as any two numbers added together equals to 100, the proof of which is left as an exercise for the reader). But sadly ab + 00 = 100 = 00 != ab so we only have 3/4 of the necessary properties to be an abelian group"

4chan,3c7rn7,FallenWind,1 point,Mon Jul 6 05:24:53 2015 UTC,"Are you comparing that to the current SSGSS Goku though I mean if it's just SS# Superman is gonna win every day, on the other hand SSGSS is at the level of gods, it's reached the point where he should be able to easily destroy realities, Super Buu and SS3 Gotenks could create holes in reality just by yelling really loud, SS3 is so much weaker than SSG it barley register and SSGSS is so much above SSG its hardly comparable. So at this point SSGSS should easily be able to just destroy entire realities with little effort if he wanted to. Current power could simply teleport an insane distance away pinpoint supermans location and blast him with an energy blast so powerful it should be able to easily shatter realities."
4chan,3c7rn7,cosmiccrystalponies,1 point,Mon Jul 6 05:32:15 2015 UTC,"That's quite the jump, especially since the most they've been able to destroy is Solar Systems. And plus the reason they were able to put the hole in the Hyperbolic Time Chamber was because of its incredibly wonky nature. Its worth noting that outside of it, they'd never done it again in a fight, not even the villains.   And besides. If it REALLY comes down to it, Superman CAN just phase through all of Gokus ki blasts."
4chan,3c7rn7,FallenWind,1 point,Mon Jul 6 05:39:48 2015 UTC,"Well it might be its wonky nature is is true that it was still possible at SS3,which can't even compare to SSG not to mention SSGSS, which someone else pointed out is also no longer even just Ki, but more of a mystic transformation, more along the lines of divine which any divine power is generally classified as magic making superman ineffective against it."
4chan,3c7rn7,cosmiccrystalponies,3,Mon Jul 6 14:51:13 2015 UTC,"Well, if I'm correct, SSJ God is a transformation that is magical in nature, meaning it bypasses Superman's invincibility. Supes would be crushed by a single punch. I might be wrong though"

Sure you can enhance someone's potential or fuse someone together with magic, but Ki has always been something different, a very grounded and physical thing. Not to mention the only difference mentioned between ki and godly ki is that godly ki is above regular"
4chan,3c7rn7,FallenWind,2,Mon Jul 6 23:18:41 2015 UTC,"Well, Gohan's power is magical, and it's said that it felt different when sensing it, as did the godly Ki."

4chan,3c7rn7,FallenWind,2,Tue Jul 7 02:55:43 2015 UTC,"Pretty sure the only character that could beat Goku is Franklin Richards, who could somehow just create a reality in which Goku didn't exist/died to a heart attack or whatever other bullshit."

4chan,3c7rn7,FallenWind,1 point,Mon Jul 6 16:58:46 2015 UTC,"Such as?  He's the most powerful brute force and emission character to ever exist.  He can annihilate solar systems effortlessly and move at the speed of light, which basically encompasses all of flash's powers inadvertently.   He could utterly destroy every single marvel/dc god without question."
4chan,3c7rn7,bartimaeus01,0,Mon Jul 6 10:48:06 2015 UTC,"He's the most powerful brute force and emission character to ever exist   The Flash fights in picoseconds, hits at the force of white dwarf stars at a minimum and can percieve down to attoseconds. Light speed is a light breeze to him (though no DBz character can move at light speed).   There are too many characters who can win so I'll keep it to just a simple 2 of the god characters in Marvel or DC. DC has ""The Spectre"", a vengeful agent of God who can warp reality to however he likes, has infinite physical durability if he so chooses and can re-create the big bang. Marvel has the ""Living Tribunal"", who is the Judge across the Multiverse and can depower the Infinite Gauntlet, which has universal level omnipotence.   Hell, Sailor Moon is a galaxy buster and more power."

Bat-God gets annoying, but not as annoying as ""I already have a suit for this"" Iron Man or ""My brain is the biggest deus ex machina in all of fiction"" Reed Richards.  But Superman has 3 weaknesses and regularly fights people as strong or stronger than him. When you pit him against some normal dude, yeah he's OP, he's fucking Superman. So that's why you have him fight Doomsday or Darkseid or Metallo, and leave guys like the Joker to Batman, who would have his asshole absolutely destroyed if he got within 100 feet of Doomsday.   If you think Marvel's heroes aren't OP, just look at The Hulk or Thor's actual comic feats, and not the pussified MCU versions. If there is any superhero stronger than Superman, it's Thor. His fucking hammer alone has more powers than Superman does."

4chan,3c6ybu,RJ815,14,Sun Jul 5 18:32:52 2015 UTC,"It's uncommon for foreigners to clap for the same variety of things that Americans might clap for. Clapping for a national anthem can be seen as odd if not disrespectful compared to the more somber approach other countries can take. One of the weirdest IMO is clapping at the conclusion of a film they really liked, because it's not like that applause is in any way reaching the creators of the film. Clapping for a good or unusual performance at some show is more reasonable, but even then Americans might clap mid-performance whereas other countries might only clap at the end of a specific act or perhaps even only at the end of the entire show.  I'm not sure what, if any, other countries tip their waiters and waitresses. Usually the wage situation is different in other countries to make tipping seem unnecessary, or even outright rude in a ""your employer doesn't give enough of a shit about you to actually pay you properly"" kind of way. Foreigners can find tipping a very bizarre phenomenon because it's mostly restricted to the food industry only (you don't tip your doctor for instance) and because it can feel like a hidden extra percentage on top of the listed price, and some travel guides even describe it in such a way to make it seem deceitful rather than just a cultural thing that isn't commonly questioned by locals."
4chan,3c6ybu,Canuck117,6,Mon Jul 6 02:58:27 2015 UTC,Tips are dumb because the restaurant should pay their own goddamn employees.  Applause because Americans tend to applaud after shit like movies and successful airplane landings.
4chan,3c6ybu,DatGrass14,2,Mon Jul 6 04:10:34 2015 UTC,actually if the waiters dont make enough from tips their employers have to pay them the difference to get minimum wage anyway

4chan,3c6f64,xtrmmnmlst,209,Sun Jul 5 08:21:54 2015 UTC,"Yeah here's a few things. Germany did actually lose WWI quite badly, however the homefront thought they were winning due to propaganda. When the Treaty of Versailles came through one of the terms was the installation of a new democratic governmental system. This new government was then forced to take the full blame of the events of WWI, creating the ""stab in the back"" myth (The myth that Germany wasn't losing but the new government fucked over Germany and stabbed the German people in the back by surrendering). The new Weimar government struggled economically and got fucked in 1923 when hyperinflation occurred. Ultimately this government was kinda okay from then onwards until about 1929, where they got fucked once again due to the great depression and the massive reparation denbts they owed to everyone. Enter Hitler and the NSDAP (Nazis).  Hitler was elected as chancellor in 1932, arguably the best possible time for economic recovery in history as the great depression wound down and by 1934 it was mostly over. Thus the massive job creation. He got the economy on track and managed to recover but it was in line with global economic recovery at the time so while it sounds absolutely incredible, it's not as impressive in the context of the period.  Emigration was always legal, Jews included. Hitler didn't change anything, he just had power to change those things from 1933 and paid no mind to it until a few years down the track.  There were literally no ethnic Germans in large numbers outside Germany by 1939. This was a key factor Hitler's foreign policy called volksgemeinshaft (All German people united under one country). he spent the years from 1933 to 1939 making sure that every major group of ethnic Germans was under German rule (recapture of the Rhineland, Invasion of Czechoslovakia, invasion of Austria, etc.). The real cause of the outbreak of the war was ""polish"" soldiers attacking a German outpost near the border. This of course is a myth/straight out wrong. Many historians believe the attack (which was insubstantial and only involved about a hundred men and was not recognised by the Polish government) was staged by the German army dressing in Polish uniforms and attacking their own outpost on Hitler's orders. Logically Hitler then decided to completely annihilate the country in retaliation for this ""crime"" that he most likely perpetuated.  Russia and Germany teamed up mainly because Poland was weak and Russia are kinda douches but also because Russia was unable to fight a war at that time. There are plenty of arguments that say Russia used the time bought by their non aggression pact and alliance with Germany to accelerate production of war armaments that were later used to fight Germany on the Eastern front. They were most certainly not ready for war and when they did attack Germany later in the war they were severely under equipped, often sharing guns (one between two is an optimistic figure by about 1942) and uniforms/winter clothes (many men in the Russian Army simply froze to death when the winter rolled around). The allies were barely in a position to fight Germany, let alone Russia, which meant that Russia couldn't be attacked at the start of the war and later it was unnecessary as Russia had declared on Germany. The western front was also attacked first as a means of subduing the Allies so that Russia could be attacked after and Germany could successfully expand their country, according to Hitler's policy of lebensraum (living space for the German people), which meant the Allies didn't give a toss about Russia at the time because Germany was destroying them militarily. So while it sounds like a smart argument on paper, the Allies literally couldn't attack Russia and were only fighting Germany because they were invading France. Britain didn't even join the war until a bit after the invasion of France and both economies were completely incapable of supporting another war at the time.  TL;DR Most of what he said is completely wrong or easily explained by looking at the context. I'm willing to bet the documentary is neo nazi propaganda."
4chan,3c6f64,firenine09,25,Sun Jul 5 11:02:54 2015 UTC,"Almost completly correct, especially the fact that the 4chan post is complete bs. Expect for one point.  There were large numbers of ethnic germans outside Germany. In Czechoslowakia there were around 3 million ethnic germans (which is quite a lot compared to the overall population). Most of them were expulsed after the war ended. There were also around 100 thousand germans in Slovakia.

4chan,3c6f64,BlackForestMountain,9,Mon Jul 6 02:27:50 2015 UTC,"Pretty much everything u say is true but you leave out that Germany, even though planning to attack Poland, did not intend to do so in 1939 already. They were forced into that position. You might remember Eastprussia? It was once connected to Germany (pre WWI) but this connection was cut off as a ""reputationreparation payment"" for Poland so that they get a coast line. Germany in the 1930s asked Poland multiple times if they were allowed to build an Autobahn or traintrack through Poland's new coastline to have a cheap, easy and economical not destroying way of supplying Eastprussia. Well, Poland due to having the backing of France (who told them in case they get attacked by Germany, they were to declare war) and thus also Great Britain, who had a similar treaty with Poland and France, declined this request by Germany on multiple occasions. Early to the start of the war Germany had three choices:   1) Going bankrupt by continuing to ""feed"" Eastprussia by water way  2) Abandoning Eastprussia and thus giving it most likely to Poland or Russia  3) Declaring war on Poland  Option 1) was no choice for them as they just came out of depression, option 2) was absolutely impossible for the Nazi regime due to their dogma. Thus only option 3) was viable for them even though it was a bit too early for their likings (They were planning an attack but wanted to wait for   a) have France, Great Britain and/or Russia on their side  b) be strong enough to fight of France (mind you that during that time France actually had the strongest and biggest standing army of Europe)  c) Be strong enough to fend of British air attacks  Thus, even though the war was already planned, the timing for it was full fault of Poland  PS: The attack by the way was no surprise for Poland, they had their army already called to arms but were overrun so easily because fighting with horses against tanks isn't the smartest thing in the world."
4chan,3c6f64,aphexmoon,2,Sun Jul 5 13:27:15 2015 UTC,What do you expect when you ally yourself with Western European countries. I didn't know that about the French not helping the Polish but I do know the British were supposed to help Poland if Poland got invaded but they never did. If thats true about the French also then WW2 could have been avoided so much more quickly. Poland is just some insignificant Eastern European country to them and allying with Russia was much better choice.
4chan,3c6f64,BlackForestMountain,-1,Sun Jul 5 16:50:41 2015 UTC,"What you quoted of mine text us absolutely true, and does not contradict yours. It's a fact that the polish army was ancient in comparison to the German British and french. It was also a fact that the polish had moved their troops to the border in anticipation of a German attack.  What you said is the tactic they used which does not contradict anything I said"
4chan,3c6f64,aphexmoon,5,Sun Jul 5 19:02:59 2015 UTC,"Congratulations. you're still buying into Nazi propaganda. The Polish army never charged German tanks at the Battle of Krojanty. In fact, Germany had far more horses and cavalry units in its military than Poland. And Poland's army was not ancient. Its airforce was weak, which is why blitzkrieg was so effective. Poland owned modern French tanks and were well equipped."

4chan,3c6f64,readytoascend,6,Mon Jul 6 03:49:55 2015 UTC,no? Please refer to where i said that.   I stated multiple times that Germany was going to invade Poland anyways. The only reason for that timing was because Germany was forced to. Otherwise they would have probably invaded ~1942

So the government obviously had dog catchers go out and deal with them. But then tree hugging retards like OP went out and put collars on the dogs so that nobody would hurt them.

I certainly think the recent upswing in people who identify as transgender is artificial.  When i was in high school all the edgy girls claimed to be bisexual, but they obviously said that for attention.  I think one of the reason its frustrating to deal with in other people, is that if you even broach the idea that its more psychological then physiological, people get hyper offended and call you various names that end with -ist. Some people probably definitely have chemical and physical incontinuities, but most of the people you hear nowadays are tumblrinas, demanding to be acknowledged as special snowflakes."

So pretty much the only option available at that point, if their dysphoria is too severe for them to cope with, is to transition."

4chan,3c3nof,TroublingMink59,7,Sat Jul 4 18:58:46 2015 UTC,"Studies such as Gorin-Lazard, Audrey, et al [1], conclude there's evidence that high rates of satisfaction for those who undergo HRT exist. A large proportion of those who were dissatisfied were shown to suffer from issues relating to their life in general, how they are treated by people, self perception and issues with integrating into society. But what of the validity of transgender beliefs? Dysphoria is a frequently occurring factor experienced in transsexual individuals and there's evidence to suggest that dysphoria can be measured; Zhou et al (1995) [2] found sex a-typical differences in the stria terminalis of the brain stem when studying transgender subjects, confirmed again in a study by Kruijver et al (2000) [3]. There's evidence to suggest the differences in the stria appear in transgender individuals who have specifically experienced dysphoria and are not present in other individuals. This validates the proposition that dysphoria, as a concept, exists for transsexuals.  There's a wealth of other suggestive studies carried on the brains of transgender individuals. In Luders et al. (2009) [4], MRIs were taken of trans-women brains. There was a significantly larger volume of grey matter in the right Putamen compared to men.  Rametti et al (2011), in their study of trans-women found that trans-women ""differed from both male and female controls bilaterally in the superior longitudinal fasciculus, the right anterior cingulum, the right forceps minor, and the right corticospinal tract."" The nature of these differences suggests that some fasciculi do not complete the masculinization process in trans-women during brain development.  After Berglund et al (2008) [5] demonstrated that brain activation in trans-women was similar to female controls (and dis-similar to male controls), Garcia-Falgueras and Swaab (2008) [6] investigated the hypothalamic uncinate nucleus, which is composed of two subnuclei, interstitial nucleus of the anterior hypothalamus (INAH) 3 and 4. They showed for the first time that INAH3 volume and number of neurons of trans-women is similar to that of control females. The same study includes analysis of a trans-man who also had a INAH3 volume and number of neurons within the male control range.  Sch√∂ning et al (2010) [7] found that male controls exhibited significantly greater activation of the left parietal cortex when performing mental rotation tasks. They also they found that trans-women (both those who has started HRT and those who had not), exhibited strong activation in the temporo-occipital regions in comparison to control males.

Gender identity disorder, which is where the ideal of mental illness comes from has been replaced by gender dysphoria. It is no longer regarded as a mental illness following new research.

I've read a lot of his work and it's actually difficult to read; it's that badly written. His citations are of poor quality, referring to the likes of Blanchard and Anne Lawrence, he makes constant assumptions, and it literally reads like you would expect, somebody who really hates transgender people and believes they shouldn't be treated, but fails to provide convincing arguments or quality evidence. In the instance you quote, he refers to research carried out on very old transsexual individuals, who have had less than ideal transitions and are physically not passing.  He then goes on to superficially evaluate their views on their physical appearance as a marker for psychological welfare. How he tries to define psychosocial adjustment by physical appearance just isn't good enough.  As an practitioner he has been widely discredited for numerous reasons. I quote Dr Dan Karasic of WPATH's response: ""McHugh does cite one study from 2011, by Cecilia Dhejne, MD and colleagues at Karolinska Institute in Stockholm. However, he misunderstands Dr. Dhejne¬ís work. In the paper, Dr. Dhejne states that the study was not designed to draw conclusions on the efficacy of transgender surgeries, yet McHugh does exactly that. A closer reading of the paper shows that the increased mortality is in those who had surgery before 1989, and that mortality in trans people after 1989 is not statistically different from the general population. A recently published paper by Dr. Dhejne and colleagues shows that the regret rate for those having surgery from 2001-2010 is only 0.3%. Dr. Dhejne¬ís work shows that outcomes for transgender surgery have improved tremendously in the past 30 years, which supports the HHS decision to remove trans exclusions.""  http://www.wpath.org/site_page.cfm?pk_association_webpage_menu=1635&pk_association_webpage=4905  Evidence that shows that there are brain differences suggest that transgenderism has biological causation."

Here's the conclusion taken from the actual study:    Persons with transsexualism, after sex reassignment, have considerably higher risks for mortality, suicidal behaviour, and psychiatric morbidity than the general population.

If you kept a boy isolated from society so they didn't know any better, but raised them as a girl, of course they would think they were a girl. How would they know any different? They would wear dresses and play with dolls and love it because before puberty its all just a costume.

4chan,3c3nof,LickitySplit939,3,Sun Jul 5 05:42:39 2015 UTC,"This argument holds up well if you're talking about children, but it crumbles the moment hormones kick in because of obvious reasons.   There is no way that I can see that a person KNOWS they want to wear a dress and makeup biologically.   I don't really understand why this matters. At some point growing up the gender became part of their identity, even if it was a purely social construct (it isn't, because of hormones) how is it relevant to transgenders and sex reassignment surgery?"
4chan,3c3nof,_hlt,2,Sun Jul 5 00:31:25 2015 UTC,"Bottom line: you don't get to determine your sex at birth. Gender is ultimately the sex identity of the brain and other hormone secreting glands in the body - probably a combination of both. If a transgender individual can grow up in this same social environment as everyone else and ultimately identify with the other sex throughout their entire life as opposed to their actual sex which for which the ""proper"" behavior will be repeatedly explained by others in this social construct to that individual and the individual is still ""transgender"" then gender can't be an environmental result. Assigning different behaviors to each sex and raising a child to have those behaviors is a completely different issue."

4chan,3c3nof,ske105,-2,Sat Jul 4 22:58:31 2015 UTC,"Some people think it's a mental illness some people don't. The general consensus is that it is not a mental illness, backed up by the evidence and research that has been done in recent years. That's why even the DSM-5 states that gender identity disorder is no longer a ""thing"" and that being trans isn't a mental illness."
4chan,3c3nof,ske105,-2,Sat Jul 4 20:12:42 2015 UTC,"Gender dysphoria can be defined as a mental disorder in some cases, but new research goes against this classification. Being transgender is not defined as a mental illness, but some trans individuals can indeed develop a mental disorder (due to a mixture of societal pressures and their own conflict with their perceived gender vs how they feel).  Gender dysphoria ""implies a temporary mental state rather than an all-encompassing disorder"", something which occurs in some trans people for a temporary period of time. It's defined as ""distress and disability"".  Whether gender dysphoria could be considered a mental disorder is a difficult and complex issue, but under the medical systems that exist, it most definitely is required in order for trans people to be treated. It's important to remember that being gay was only removed from the DSM in 1973 and was itself considered a disorder until then."
4chan,3c3nof,ske105,-2,Sun Jul 5 00:48:50 2015 UTC,"Being transgender isn't defined by gender dysphoria, as the DSM defines it, that's the whole point of the change from gender identity disorder. Gender identity disorder implied that any notion of gender difference or transgenderism (it's a real word) means mental illness. Gender dysphoria is just a possible temporary outcome for transgender individuals, which may or may not be defined as a disorder (but is in the DSM).  The issue is complex: www.cognethic.org/cm/cmv3i2_Zhao.pdf&ved=0CB8QFjAA&usg=AFQjCNGRQoA9gjapEVDfZEaH776-Q2GUKA&sig2=gfBLFAeQgZbDFyD23YGokA"

Your definition of homosexuality and transexuality as being a mental illness is not one that I agree with, but I'm not going to be able to change your mind. That's fine, I don't mind what your opinion is, I'm always interested to hear the other side of why people believe LGBT is all mental illness and for what reasons. I personally feel I have good, justified reasons for what I've said, but clearly you believe the same.  I don't feel that you personally have something against LGBT, but maybe it's their apparent demand for rights/hypersensitivity that annoys you? If the vocal proponents bother you then I apologise on their behalf; not all people are like that. Nor do we hate everyone else as the vocal individuals seem to convey. I believe in mutual respect and intelligent discussion. Most everyone wants to have equal (or more) rights to others and also want to be happy and I'm hopeful that's something we can at least agree on."
4chan,3c3nof,shrekter,0,Sun Jul 5 19:53:05 2015 UTC,"Honestly, your post history goes against your claim as a member of LGBTQ.  I am not wrong. Your opinion of a definition and fact is based upon the DSM 5 which has widely been critised for numerous reasons. The fact that it is currently used does not make it any more an authority than the collective works of more recent quality research and WPATH.  Dysphoria is something that transgender people get, but not all transgender people experience it. For those who have it, it is unlikely that they will have it for their whole life. Therefore it is considered something that is temporary.  For some reason you seem to believe gender dysphoria is equal to being transgender when obviously it's not, they're different terms with different meanings. Not all people have it. Transgender individuals are expressly not in the DSM5, only dysphoria, which may or may not be present.  ""Medicine"" as you say is not always a set of rigid definitions as you seem to think it is. Obviously practitioners are led to follow guidelines, but numerous guidelines often exist for the same condition. In the presence of research, definitions evolve, although it can take a long time. The DSM 5 has many flaws, not just relating to transgenderism; most medical professionals are well aware of its limitations. Yet somehow you seem to think of it as an up-to-date authority, even with Blanchard on the board, who still believes being transgender is fetishistic based upon his poorly written research.   Apparently your need to be seen superior has led you to a position whereby you still wish to discuss an issue to no point. Clearly we have differences but I do not see the benefit of continuing my discussion with you when neither of us will change our minds. Whilst there may not a definitive answer (against the fact that you think that there is), you will indeed find the future will hold definitive proof of what we have discussed."

More than one-third (35.7 percent) of adults are considered to be obese. More than 1 in 20 (6.3 percent) have extreme obesity. Almost 3 in 4 men (74 percent) are considered to be overweight or obese.   Source: http://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/health-statistics/Pages/overweight-obesity-statistics.aspx  The US population is about 320 million people. If two thirds of your country is overweight that's 200 million people. 100 million of which are obese.  Australia's population is about 23 million. The US has 4 times as many obese people as Australia has people.

Their sensitive areas are clearly defined, their eyes are very expressive, their bodies are very expressive and they communicate clearly whether or not they're enjoying themselves; they're basically the Tomy or FisherPrice of sex. They speak in high pitched voices like ""oh no! don't put that there!"" and they have very little hair and nothing that can penetrate you.  How the fuck is that manly?   A man is a tossup. A coin. He can be penetrated or he can flip you the fuck over and penetrate you; its all a battle of will and strength to see who is the strongest which ultimately defines who becomes the fuckpuppet of the other man -- or potentially even becoming a manly throne to fuck the one ontop. They have hair everywhere, fucking beards and are nothing but hard surfaces, sharp edges, right angles and manliness.  He's more like a motor-bike. A big fuck off chopper. You can go fast but you gotta have some fucking common sense. Observe the rules of the road. Wear proper gear and watch yourself because your balls could get roasted by your fucking gas-tank or your legs by your exhaust if you're a fucking idiot. But you will go far faster.

It was only when Vlad the Impaler was truly defeated; sodomized as a boy for the actions of his father as a form of revenge following the man's death that he became the utter monster of a man we know today; and it is only when you have sunk to the bottom and seen the worst of yourself can you truly rise and become the greatest most badass motherfucker you are capable of being.

So Judaism was the first true religion but then because people corrupted Judaism, Allah had to sent another prophet; Jesus. All the saints etc. in Christianism are saints in Islam too. So then people corrupted Christianism (by calling Jesus a god while he is a normal person), changing Bible and such, so Allah had to send one last prophet which is Mohammed."

4chan,3c1noz,redmandoto,3,Sat Jul 4 06:24:36 2015 UTC,"The universe's entropy is thought to rise always, but it doesn't have to for, say, individual chemical reactions."
4chan,3c1noz,ClashOfTheAsh,1 point,Sat Jul 4 10:58:58 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that i know, but the Law reads: ""in any process, the Entropy of the Universe either remains constant or rises, while the entropy of subsistems might decrease"". I like Thermodynamics."
4chan,3c1noz,redmandoto,1 point,Sat Jul 4 13:39:13 2015 UTC,"So I'm getting from context that entropy means that the energy expended can never be utilized again? Also, you seem knowledgeable on the subject, so instead of googling I'll just ask you: What is heat death?"
4chan,3c1noz,TrentGgrims,2,Sat Jul 4 15:06:20 2015 UTC,"To explain the concept of ""heat death"", you have to explain first that not all kinds of energy can be used to do work.  For example, you can take energy from the heat transfer from a hot region to a cold one, since it is a spontaneous process, while you can't convert water to ice in a hot environment and use the energy difference (that's why your fridge uses energy: the spent energy must be at least equal to the one taken from the cold object, and reversely, you can't take all the energy from the ""natural"" transfer from hot to cold; you must take less than half).  From this knowledge, that is, that all spontaneous process go in only one direction (from ""hot"" to ""cold""), it follows that any non-spontaneous process (your fridge) is ""forced"" upon the system, and that, in turn, all energy in the universe will be in a uniform state after all ""spontaneous processes"" have taken its course. At that point, there will be no ""extra"" energy in the universe, and there will be no change for all of eternity. That is the heat death of the universe.  If you want more information, you might want to ask in r/askscience. They will probably give a more detailed explanation . Hope I've been of help."
4chan,3c1noz,trevbillion,2,Sat Jul 4 15:33:55 2015 UTC,I had to relearn entropy every semester and sometimes enthalpy without ever knowing what I was talking about. Same with the Otto cycle but I kind of get that now.

4chan,3bw244,FUCKRIGHTOFFYOUCUNT,121,Thu Jul 2 22:01:37 2015 UTC,Good lord those sound awful. I imagine it's 99% autistic weebs and le quirky grils with cat ear headbands and 1% 7/10 women who are regarded as 10/10 because they are showing a small amount of cleavage and wearing tights. Basically it's /r/gaming irl
4chan,3bw244,Brobi_WanKenobi,18,Fri Jul 3 00:02:55 2015 UTC,Then there are 2/3 super hot girls though in cosplay with a camera crew following them for their porn site
4chan,3bw244,i_hate_fanboys,9,Sat Jul 4 00:08:18 2015 UTC,"Less cleavage than you think. (unless you go to something big like comic con which is really just an excuse to be slutty. Halloween 2.0)  It's really just tumblr fandoms irl, but toned down a little (since really, very few people are crazy irl like they are online, but you can definitely tell).   Mostly guys and girls. All pretty awkward, but they fit in with each other, so good for them.   Couple of normal people and confident guys/girls that seem really uninterested in whats going on (despite being in consplay for something, so I assume they just don't fit in with the awkward super dorky nerdy animuu crowd).   Seems like fun if it's your kind of crowd.   At least that's my limited experience and having awful luck when it comes to booking hotels. There's always some fucking convention.   The most annoying was some superman convention. Hotels were booked out for miles, I could barely drive anymore, it was like fucking 4am.   But yeah, you won't find any stereotypical 4chan type autistic weeaboos there (at least not many), mostly tumblr level dorks and such. Functional in real life, but definitely not 'normies'. You can tell they're uncomfortable around you, but they know how to do small talk and all that  The amount of home stuck cosplay is always too damn high though."

Now I wish to introduce the following idea. Between the age limits of nine and fourteen there occur maidens who, to certain bewitched travelers, twice or many times older than they, reveal their true nature which is not human, but nymphic (that is, demoniac); and these chosen creatures I propose to designate as 'nymphets.'  It will be marked that I substitute time terms for spatial ones.

They are told of all these disorders and all the courage it takes to live with them. And guess what... Having a disorder means you get away with shit too. Bonus.  They use WebMD to self diagnose; Sadness becomes bipolar, mood swings become multiple personality disorders, and being insecure becomes social anxiety. And everyone has to believe them and pander to them. But it is not helping them. They are putting on whiskers and meowing and NOT getting picked on. What?

I haven't seen it being used to describe anything but state of mind.  Like if you were really angry you wouldn't be in a good headspace to make good decisions, so you'd calm yourself down first (or just make bad decisions.  I'm not the boss of you).  If you're bored and fidgety you're not in a good headspace to learn something.  It's thrown around a bit when people talk about meditation.  Or it's the distance measured from the part of the chamber that stops forward motion of the cartridge to the face of the bolt.  Maybe that guy is worried about the Apache-kin getting uppity again."

4chan,3btc4o,ChessPiece19,44,Thu Jul 2 20:30:50 2015 UTC,"I've been listening to the History of China podcasts. The Northern Wei dynasty was so scared of emperor dowagers (the mother of the crownprince, who'd be in total control if the emperor died and the prince was too young, like Queen Cersei before Joffrey's crowned), that they had a rule dictating that whenever a prince was declared crown prince, the mother had to be killed.  If an entire dynasty of emperors is obligated to kill their wives whenever they declare a crown prince, it says something about how much they fear their wives to be in total control after their death. History shows repeatedly that there is quite some reason for this, as time and again empresses would kill their husbands and groom the crown princes to gain total control themselves.  At that time, being in total control of China was god tier."
4chan,3btc4o,8-4,5,Thu Jul 2 22:07:32 2015 UTC,I'd say even now being in total control of China is a pretty big deal.

4chan,3btc4o,Spartanhero613,1 point,Thu Jul 2 10:20:30 2015 UTC,"The Northern Wei dynasty had this giant manned wall in their frigid north where they fended off barbarians. It used to be an honourable occupation at first, but eventually, being sent to the wall was a punishment and it was manned merely by criminals.  The Han dynasty (iirc) had fallen because a eunich with an extensive spy network had manipulated his way into control in court.  Several Chinese empresses have killed their husband to rule as an empress dowager until their child came of age, and usually kept control even when the crown prince was crowned, by letting the spoiled brat have fun.  The war of the roses between the Lancasters and the Yorks was ended when the Yorks claimants to the thrones had been killed and the Lancaster heir married a York princess.  Venice was a city built on thousands of islands, and it had a large control over the world via its trade and its bank.  I think it is pretty safe to draw a comparison between aGoT and history, as aGoT is inspired heavily by historic tales and elements. Besides, the analogy is a nice bonus. You can ignore it and my argument still stands."

According to Christianity, Jesus died in order to wipe away that sin.   ...   Do not think that I have come to do away with or undo the Law or the Prophets; I have come not to do away with or undo but to complete and fulfill them.  For truly I tell you, until the sky and earth pass away and perish, not one smallest letter nor one little hook [identifying certain Hebrew letters] will pass from the Law until all things [it foreshadows] are accomplished.  Whoever then breaks or does away with or relaxes one of the least [important] of these commandments and teaches men so shall be called least [important] in the kingdom of heaven, but he who practices them and teaches others to do so shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven.  For I tell you, unless your righteousness (your uprightness and your right standing with God) is more than that of the scribes and Pharisees, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven.   ^ Matthew 5:17-20 AMP   What shall we say [to all this]? Are we to remain in sin in order that God‚Äôs grace (favor and mercy) may multiply and overflow?  Certainly not! How can we who died to sin live in it any longer?   ^ Romans 6:1-2 AMP  To fulfill the law means to obey it, in a sense. It means that Jesus fulfilled the law such that we don't have to. That regardless of our actions, if we follow Him, God considers us in obedience to the law, in regards to our ultimate judgement and where we go after.  But Christianity isn't just about the binary thing of Heaven VS Hell. Jesus is the solution to that part.   It's also about our relationship with God, which our sin has an affect on. Just because God calls us square for our ""after"" life (paraphrased) doesn't mean we are free from the effects that sin has in this life between us and Him.   TL;DR: Jesus didn't abolish the law. We don't have to fret about fulfilling it to not be damned, but we should strive to anyway to be closer to God.  Edit: removed references from where I copied the scriptures from (such as [a] and what-not)."

However, there are two kinds of laws in Leviticus. Social, and moral.   Social laws are the ones I just mentioned. These are in place to distinguish the Jews from the Pagans, as the Jews were God's people.   The moral laws includes things like homosexual acts, bestiality, murder, what have you. Things that God said were immoral acts, not to be indulged in not just to be set apart from the pagans, but because they were sinful in and of themselves.  Christ died to fulfill the laws. This doesn't mean that all laws were obliterated(although some were), only the social laws. This means that Christians no longer have to be set apart from pagans, as in Christ ""there is neither Jew nor Greek, male nor female,"" etc. Which is to say that anyone who believes in God can be saved, not just Jews.   So there you go. Hope that made sense!"

4chan,3bsd3v,Drewbixtx,4,Thu Jul 2 01:15:16 2015 UTC,"Just read exactly what Jesus said in verses 18-19. Also, Paul and the other apostles continued to make sacrifices even after Jesus was executed. (The issue of sacrifices are more complex, but the general institution continued on even with his disciples.)  If G-d had the intention of getting rid of his word or nullifying it, He would at least have made some indication of it previously. However, no where in the OT does it say anything about it going away or for some kind of new system to be put into place.  In fact, Jeremiah 31, which lays out the New Covenant and what it will be comprised of does not in any way negate the previous ones:   31 ‚ÄúThe days are coming,‚Äù declares the Lord,     ‚Äúwhen I will make a new covenant with the people of Israel     and with the people of Judah. 32 It will not be like the covenant     I made with their ancestors when I took them by the hand     to lead them out of Egypt, because they broke my covenant,     though I was a husband to[d] them,[e]‚Äù declares the Lord. 33 ‚ÄúThis is the covenant I will make with the people of Israel     after that time,‚Äù declares the Lord. ‚ÄúI will put my law in their minds     and write it on their hearts. I will be their God,     and they will be my people. 34 No longer will they teach their neighbor,     or say to one another, ‚ÄòKnow the Lord,‚Äô because they will all know me,     from the least of them to the greatest,‚Äù declares the Lord. ‚ÄúFor I will forgive their wickedness     and will remember their sins no more.‚Äù"

Then she has to offer up a sacrifice.] Going to church within 66 days after giving birth to a girl (12:5) [Actually, she‚Äôs unclean a week, and then another 66 days. Then she has to offer up a sacrifice.] Reaping to the very edges of a field (19:9) [To be left for the poor.

By men, not God. It may be the word of God as they believe it, but that doesn't make them or it infallible. Interpretation needs to adapt and evolve to the times.

When you live in a Mormon household you do not fuck around when hiding porn.

Furthermore brandishing is illegal in some states.   Where you can just walk in, buy a gun, and walk out, own unlimited amount of anything   That sounds terrible, probably the reason for your ridiculous gun crime rates.

If you think about life from your own perspective in a given moment, life is about acting in a way that makes you feel very good in that random moment, since you have a limited amount of time and you want to be happy most of that time. Life is objectively easier if you are happy (since you don't even notice that you are alive and time is passing).  So yeah, in the grand scheme of things life makes no sense, but to you as a living human being your actions make sense, since they decide how you feel (and feeling good is better for you than feeling bad)."

4chan,3bqw2i,gummz,10,Wed Jul 1 21:42:20 2015 UTC,So what your saying is that you don't like Bejeweled so therefore  it only exists to burn time.
4chan,3bqw2i,IlIllIlllIllIlI,-3,Wed Jul 1 17:29:45 2015 UTC,"No, I'm saying no person gets anything out of it other than their attention in order for them to pass time more quickly. It's like any other repetitive task that can get a person into the ""flow state.""  It's a state that's generally pleasant (in fact, it's what makes most games ""good""), but there's not much else to be gained. You could enjoy almost the exact same experience by sitting there with your eyes closed and being more than a novice at meditation.

People can have vastly different ceilings on fent, and effective dosages can vary. I used to be able to take up to 200ng (patch form) of fent without ODing, whereas you might not even be able to take 10. You'd at least get sick from it and have to take it off. This is also why so many addicts die from overdoses, because heroin is laced with fent (due to how much cheaper it is to cut. I think it might be heavier as well). There's not a lot of cross tolerance between morphine analogues."

Or are you just regurgitating what you hear on TV?   It's funny, basically anyone in a position of power is suddenly ""power-hungry."" People call their bosses power-hungry, politicians, etc. What a coincidence, the people that have authority over other people frequently get called ""power-hungry."" I'm sure that has nothing to do with those people's own feelings about authority. In the sense that police have power and the cops sought out those jobs, yes. But you're making a sweeping generalization and even if it was true, this isn't an illuminating insight. But if I had to characterize it, ""stupid overused cliches that don't actually contribute anything to the conversation"" is probably the strongest theme of your post, so...   with low intelligence   Here's where your autism kicks in and you feel the need to let everyone know that you're smarter than the cops. And you use another sweeping generalization to do it. I'm not saying you have to be a brain surgeon to be a cop but it takes more smarts than many other non-degree jobs out there (and many of them do have degrees). I worked closely with a private security company and the bulk of their employees were washouts who failed the entrance exam for the city or state academies. The mere fact that you need to pass things like that to get the job already puts it well ahead of a large chunk of the American workforce. Now maybe you don't need to pass tests or learn criminal law to serve on the force in Podunk, but you certainly do for many of the major city departments and all state troopers. But you're just talking out of your ass and making generalizations, so you wouldn't get into the nuances between different departments or types of cops.   who are ordered to spend most of their time annoying people over petty bullshit, all while getting payed by us.   Really? The commissioner says ""hey, go out and annoy people over petty bullshit?"" It's a huge conspiracy just to piss you off, right? Politicians would love to go to their constituents and say ""crime is down"" which would mean police would avoid making arrests if possible (not to mention they avoid the paperwork). And I think you're confused over what a police force is. They're not there to pick and choose the laws they enforce. If the law is that marijuana is illegal, whether the cop thinks that law is stupid or not, he's supposed to bust you if he sees you smoking a joint. The mouthbreathers of this country see that and get mad at the cops, and then they go elect the idiots who make stupid law after stupid law over and over and over. The politicians are the ones who emphasize or deemphasize enforcement strategies. You think the War on Drugs came from some ""power hungry cops?"" Seriously? But fuck da police is so much easier, right?  Cap it off with ""all getting payed by us"" like that is news to anyone who can zip their fly without getting their dick caught. Yes, the police get paid by the state. They are positions that are funded through taxes, just like a gazillion other positions. So fucking what?   There are some great officers who actually care about helping people but as things are set up now the police in general are shit.   Summing up: SOME ARE GOOD SOME ARE BAD MOSTLY BAD THO. This devastating insight brought to you by the same man behind ""power hungry people with low intelligence."" And ""as things are set up now?"" Could you be any more vague about that? What is the nationwide ""set up"" that makes police in general shit? (This is all rhetorical by the way, I really really don't care what you think).  Rather than recognize that these are complex issues and there's likely huge variation state to state and city to city, you instead made broad generalization after broad generalization to ultimately arrive at the conclusion that the police are big meanyfaces out to get you. Oh, and you're also smarter than them, coincidentally. It's an oversimplification, it's not an original thought, it doesn't contribute anything meaningful to the conversation, and it's not well-thought out. That's what made me think that you were of ""low intelligence.""   Then, after asserting your superiority over an entire group of people, the cherry on top was you making a boneheaded spelling error. I would let that go in 99% of posts because most posts aren't people talking about how dumb they think everyone else is. I will say that it's that special kind of spelling error - not a typo, not something that can be blamed on autocorrect. No, see you typed out ""p-a-y-e-d,"" which is honestly kind of troubling. Those of us who learned the word ""paid"" in the 3rd grade pretty much closed down the door in our mind to ever typing out ""payed,"" even absentmindedly, because it's not a word. It'd be like if I called you an asswhole. Now, it's not a big deal, that extra w, but the fact that it snuck in there points to the fact that maybe, just maybe, some part of me thinks it could be spelled that way."

4chan,3bpt2r,Mr_Strangelove_MSc,14,Wed Jul 1 12:43:30 2015 UTC,I think it would probably take about 15 mins to create an account and maybe 15 to delete. so that's a half-hour of effort to save 8 bucks a month. that works out to be more cost effective than paying if said person's wage is less than 16 bucks an hour. I think.  Also maybe I'm talking out my ass.
4chan,3bpt2r,cakeandbeer,13,Wed Jul 1 12:59:34 2015 UTC,Shit when I start getting paid $16 I might consider not stealing netflix
4chan,3bpt2r,accepting_upvotes,10,Wed Jul 1 14:26:20 2015 UTC,You're not taking in account the ordeal of copying a person's credit card info and...you know... Repeatedly doing something illegal.
4chan,3bpt2r,NormalNormalNormal,6,Wed Jul 1 15:28:54 2015 UTC,"It's perfect for someone who wants to experience the thrill of stealing without (some of) the moral and ethical baggage, and who also digs Netflix.  The best part is that you don't have to be bummed out over having to create new profiles because Netflix's recommendation algorithm sucks so damn much now."
4chan,3bpt2r,dafuzzbudd,5,Wed Jul 1 16:13:27 2015 UTC,"You also have to nick their credit card, then put it back again."
4chan,3bpt2r,Izlud3,2,Wed Jul 1 13:27:10 2015 UTC,"Pretty much at any crappy job you can make more than that in an hour. The whole process of stealing the info, making the account, and cancelling probably takes almost an hour.  I refuse to believe anyone is stupid enough to think this was a good idea.  Also how can you so easily steal a different person's credit card info every month without getting caught? I mean do people really just leave their credit cards lying around in front of him?  I know the story is made up, but he should at least make it believable."
4chan,3bpt2r,vagina_fang,21,Wed Jul 1 20:16:15 2015 UTC,36% of American homes have a Netflix account.  This doesn't sound like a great scheme

Then get green peppers, onions, lettuce, ranch on top and then a few shreds of lettuce on the ranch to keep the ranch from sticking to the wrapper when they roll it up.   Make sure to get macaroni salad, the sweet potato chips (as part of the combo) and another bag of sweet poatato chips because they are so good you will want to eat a whole bag with just half a sub. Also get some of the sweet rolls too. This should set you back about fifteen dollars, but it sub is a good two meals."

McCarthy does rely too much on her shtick. I'd blame that more on Hollywood than anything. She's been in other movies without falling back on it, and has done a really good job. This being a comedy though, I'd imagine that we're going to see her play the bumbling fat girl.   The only one I don't like is the Leslie Jones.

European governments realised that they could no longer take on debt that they can't handle, the Greeks although did suffer some austerity, they gave up, reopened an unprofitable TV station, rehired thousands of unnecessary civil servants, and let 7 years of austerity and all the work associated go to shit. Using the nazi card to justify why the Greeks deserve money 70 years is no way to justify a dramatic over spend. If they are not willing to accept the bail out terms, and are willing to risk the Euro zone as a whole, they should not be a part of it."
4chan,3bohic,chsmith1,4,Wed Jul 1 08:32:45 2015 UTC,Austerity is the last thing a struggling economy needs. Trying to extract money from Greece is only going to weaken their economy further. Germany is bowing to the demands of the international creditors who made bad loans. The best thing for Greece would be to leave the Eurozone so they could create their own currency.
4chan,3bohic,willardmillard,3,Wed Jul 1 14:30:22 2015 UTC,"Creating a currency based on their economy at this moment, baring in mind that they are the first developed nation to default on the IMF in modern history, would mean the currency would be worthless. Which would mean the people of Greece, which hold there money in Euros would lose out as they change to the new currency. In 2011 German and France should not have bailed out the creditors and took on the debt. They should have let the private creditor go bankrupt. Austerity may not be the best thing but it is what Greece needed, after changing to the Euro the Greek government went mad, over spending on unnecessary investments - 2004 Olympics, the biggest recycling plant in Europe (unused) and a massive investment in the railways without increasing the cost of the investment to the customer  (which most governments/companies do) but on to the taxpayer.  If they did have their own currency, I'm sure they would just over spend and quantative ease, which would more than like lead to hyper inflation. They should accept the terms and stuck in up."

She went on to explain to me that by time I was born she had already lost her virginity and she was already giving mad bj's to chaps in Dublin. After banging her that night we went in for one more session in the morning before we both left for work. Luckily I didn't catch anything. Ended up losing contact but heard a story few years later they were all at a local watering hole in Singapore when a round of J√§eger shots were offered. She said that she would rather drink cum than that horrible Shit. Cue their mate picks up fresh shot glass, walks to bathroom, rubs one out into the shot glass, returns with a fresh organic 38 degree steaming shot of one's finest natural jizz that money can't buy. Without hesitation she nails it down and licks the glass clean. I fucked that and came out clean. A true wtf moment in life."

4chan,3bn50k,RobMillsyMills,15,Tue Jun 30 19:08:31 2015 UTC,"I met and flirted with Lindsay Lohan last year without realizing who she was.  Last year, I vacationed overseas. I was at LAX waiting in line at the security checkpoint - big-ass line of people. All of a sudden people started murmuring quietly and I could hear the clicking and beeping of camera drives, so I turned to see what was up.  Walking down the terminal bridges from the parking structures was a flock of paparazzi. They were pointing their cameras in my general direction, so I knew there had to be a celebrity close by. Suddenly, I caught a glimpse of a woman out of the corner of my eye.  Standing besides me, outside of the line and escorted by two suited men, was a very attractive redhead, dressed down in casual clothing (typical for celebrities in public here in LA). I barely had time to think of something before she turned her head and we made eye contact.  ""Now look what you've done,"" I said.  She looked puzzled.  I maintained eye contact but nodded my head sideways in the direction of the paparazzi. ""You've led them right to me. What were you thinking, woman?""  She smiled big and turned towards me. There was a brief, intense moment of silence and then she said ""I'm sorry. It was careless, wasn't it?""  ""This is a bad way for you to start our relationship. But I can forgive, under the right circumstances.""  We walked very briefly. The bodyguards she was with were trying to get her priority screening, so there wasn't much time to work - but she was into me. I didn't give her beauty or her apparent status as a celebrity any credence, and I dropped one cocky neg after the other. By the time her escort ushered her through, we were at the topic of sex and she was laughing. I'm sure that with some fast talking, luck, and a blatant disregard for my own personal safety I could have cleared security along with her by just insisting hard enough - but I didn't feel ready to start some shit at an airport. Not before my flight, and not just for some pussy.  So we parted ways without ever exchanging names. She went through the checkpoint.  After she'd left, all of the other girls in the line were making huge fucking eyes at me and smiling. One guy in the line said ""Duuuuude..."" and gave me a brofist.  ""Who the fuck was that?"" I asked him, bumping fists.  ""Dude, that was Lindsay Lohan.""  I had no idea who that was. I think he saw the obliviousness in my face because he laughed.  Well, now I know."

I was at LAX waiting in the security line with my mom, playing Pokemon Silver on my GBA. All of a sudden people started murmuring quietly and I could hear the clicking and beeping of camera drives, so I turned and said, ""Moooooooooooommmm, what the fuuuuuuuck!!""  Walking down the terminal bridges from the parking structures was a flock of paparazzi. They were pointing their cameras in my general direction, like a bunch of faggots. Suddenly, I caught a glimpse of a woman out of the corner of my eye.  Standing besides me, outside of the line and escorted by two suited men, was a very attractive redhead, dressed down in casual clothing (typical for celebrities in public here in LA). I barely had time to adjust my fanny pack and tuck my meme tshirt into the waste band of my underpants before I diverted eye contact with her.  ""Uh...h...hi..."" I said, in an almost inaudible whisper, with buzzing ears. I could feel my face becoming redder by the moment.  She adjusted her sunglasses and looked down at me.   I shuffled and adjusted my weight between my feet, staring intently at my belly and socks and sandals.  ""H....hi.."" I squeaked again.   She gave me a weak and completely uninterested smile -- kind of like the smile you'd give to a sick old dog begging for table scraps and then she said ""Hello"" while checking her phone.  ""M...m....Mean g...girls w....was a g...good m...movie..."" I managed to blurt out unevenly. By this time some people were watching me.  I tried to talk with her more, but by that time she had gotten a phone call. I tried to think of more movies, or even some tactic I read about on /r/TheRedPill. My moment of glory was slowly fading as the woman and her escorts began to wander away.  Suddenly, the line had begun moving and mom gently tugged at my shoulder. ""Quit it, bitch!"" I screamed and darted off toward  m'lady.  ""W...wait..."" I huffed, ""T...take me w...with y...you!""  I caught up to them and tried to grasp her hand. She let out a shriek and I was immediately tackled to the ground by one of the suited men. Some of the girls that had been in the line were now around me, as a heavy knee pressed against my throat. Their eyes were all wide as they took videos and pictures of me on the ground.   One guy from the line shouted, ""Dude! That neckbeard tried to touch Lindsey Lohan."" Then he gave me the finger and lauged right in my face.  That night in prison I beat it so hard to her and my brief moment together."
