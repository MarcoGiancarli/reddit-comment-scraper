cafe,3cti89,Ithlilian,2,Fri Jul 10 17:26:20 2015 UTC,"I have found that while not all places have the best coffee shops, even a bad coffee shop can foster a great barista. Don't be afraid to give the first place a second chance.   I usually use my coffee houses for a place to stay for upwards of three hours as I study, write papers, or read novels.   Once a barista I was good friends with noticed I'd fallen asleep, I'd been there for like five hours reading and editing papers, and he gave me a wallop with an ice cube. I love that place.  Going only for the coffee makes it a much harsher experience on the staffs part. I suggest that wherever you go, ask their recommendations. At my new locality the best thing is the hot coffee, but before it was the wide variety of espresso concoctions."

cafe,39xtm0,DearTereza,3,Mon Jun 15 17:56:16 2015 UTC,"I thought I’d write up my experiences with coffee on the vacation I just took, and post some photos. My girlfriend and I went to Trieste, then west along the Adriatic coast to Venice (and briefly back again). We went to Trieste because of its weird history, and the fact that its not overly rammed with tourists and the attendant hawkers and traders trying to push branded tat on them - but also because it’s often called Italy’s home of coffee. This has to do with its trade history (notably as a port town under the Habsburg empire, and briefly as an independent territory), which is well worth reading about. The legacy of Trieste’s mercantile history is a number of amazing, famous cafes, previously the favourite of artists including James Joyce.  To begin with Italian coffee in general (at least from the few areas we visited), some observations. Firstly, I’d heard that Italians typically stand at the bar, down an espresso in one gulp and leave immediately. This isn’t really true. True, they mostly don’t spend the hours-upon-hours in cafes that some of us in other countries do, but they do sit with their espresso for 5-15 minutes sipping and talking, or reading, people watching etc. The cafes themselves are normally not cafes as we know them (in the Howard Schultz mode), but Bars. They serve alcohol and many are open late into the night. The decor in cafes in this part of Italy is strongly influenced by the ‘Viennese’ style, with dark gloss oak and gilded filigree on everything in sight. Hardly chic, but rather grand in its own way, and a fun callback to the regions prosperous Habsburg past.  Espresso is cheap: 1 Euro at a regular street bar and no more than 2-2.50 at the best cafes in town. They are all served as single shots (doubles don’t really seem to be a thing there), and are typically taken with no milk, but plenty of sugar, and almost always served with a glass of water. Better places also provide biscotti. Hard seating is the norm, and seating at the bar itself makes for a different atmosphere than a Starbucks-style cafe with the ‘bar’ is just a counter full of fast-moving customers. There are no takeaway cups either. You sit, either with a friend at a table or at the bar talking to the barista (all of whom were very friendly), stay for a short but vital period, and then carry on with your day.  The coffee is well known in Italy for being almost exclusively dark-roast. This suits me just fine, as I prefer darker roasts, and none were as pointlessly over-roasted as Starbucks. They were a good, hearty dark for the most part, and a decent mix of both blends and single-origins. 100% Arabica is not uncommon, though Arabica Robusta blends can be found easily enough. If you like light roasts, fruity flavours and high acidity, Italian coffee won’t cut it for you. But if you like artisinal, high quality dark roasts, you’ll be in heaven. For me this is what I always wish more of the high-end third wave roasters would make, but seldom do. In any case, most places also offered decaff beans, and there was no snobbery attached to that at all.  Another rumour I’d heard that didn’t check out was ’no one drinks milk drinks after 11am’. Cappuccinos were available at all times and nobody cared. They were pleasingly small when ordered, too. The cup sizes are all small, with single-sized espresso cups (often very thick-walled and heated to enormous, almost painful temperatures), and cappuccino cups at no more than 6-8f FlOz. Interestingly, small kiosks and restaurants often use ‘pod’ machines, though almost exclusively Illy machines and pods.  Speaking of Illy, the Illy family has strong links to Trieste (I believe their CEO was once its Mayor), and they have a factory there, as well as lovely ‘Illyteca’ shops selling assorted Illy coffees and merch. There was some promotion around for the new book written by Andrea Illy, which looks at every stage of coffee from origins/faming to the science of cafes and the perfect demitasse. Sadly it’s only available in Italian right now. Most smaller cafes and restaurants serve Illy in some form, though the larger and more famous historic cafes tend to have their own signature blends (including Torinese and Caffe San Marco).  We visited most of the historic cafes of Trieste, including Caffe San Marco, Bar Torinese and Caffe degli Specchi. Particularly worthy of note are San Marco, which is enormous, and includes a bookshop and restaurant despite its traditional Vienesse style, and Degli Specchi, which served one of my favourite coffees of the holiday, their famous signature ‘Capo in Bi’ (which is served in a glass, and hence really a small, strong Cortado, see album for pic).  We took a day trip to Venice, where some helpful Redditors (/u/Euphorazyne and /u/jacybear) suggested we head to Caffe del Doge. Thank goodness they did, because while Venice was a bit of a disappointment, del Doge was one of the highlights of the entire trip. I tried 3 different blends: their 2 house blends, Doge Rosso and Doge Nero, and a single-origin Guatemala. All three were spectacular, but especially the Rosso, a very bright, intricate, yet notably dark Arabica blend (Brazil/Columbia/Guatemala, roasted separately and cold-blended, which is apparently in the Venetian tradition), and the Guatemala which was supremely dark and powerful, but in a very palatable way. I bought several espresso cups and some beans to take home.  Caffe del Doge has a wide selection of beans, all with nice descriptions and boasts about transparent, ethical origins - but all of them are medium-high to high roasted. They didn’t seem to do the medium and light roasts that so en-vogue at third wave cafes in UK/US/AUS/NZ et al. Again, this suited us well, but it’s not for everyone. I was relieved to be able to sample such a variety of coffees without wincing at fruity acidity, but I get that that's not to everyone's taste.  There’s probably more that I’m forgetting, but these are the main thoughts that jumped out at me. If you’re travelling in Europe, or even just Italy, I highly recommend checking out Trieste, in all its weirdness. It was a whole different kind of coffee culture, every bit as obsessed but in wholly different ways. Venice is completely mad and feels a bit like a Disneyland tribute to Venice (seriously), but it’s worth going just to find Caffe Del Doge alone, and you'll get some great photos of the strange streets.

cafe,39xsvq,Fromagenut,7,Mon Jun 15 17:50:47 2015 UTC,"Immersion cold brew can be made in large batches and stored for up to two weeks at a time. It mixes really well with milk/cream.  Pour over would be worth it if you use quality beans. It allows you to have a fresh, fully-controlled brew for each cup. It can bring out better notes from the beans than a batch brewer would. It might require extra hands/time, but shops generally also charge more for those cups if they offer batch brews and pour overs.  If you're not using freshly-roasted, specialty-grade beans, then pour over can't make mediocre beans better.  Iced pour over can make an amazing, crisp, refreshing iced coffee as well.  What do you consider ""properly foamed""?  If your clientele doesn't really know much about specialty coffee, it might not be worth the investment to delve deeper. However, if you yourself find yourself getting interested, then you might start wanting to share that with your customers. Then based off of how they receive it, you can make decisions from there.  But yeah. Do research. Maybe try some of it. Cold brew in a French Press is super simple. If you travel, see if you can find a shop where pour over is offered. Assess and go from there."
cafe,39xsvq,jja619,2,Mon Jun 15 18:09:21 2015 UTC,"""Properly foamed"" i guess i ment microfoam. Just wanted to serve good coffee and latte art on espresso milk drinks when we opened. So we have one drip and save the leftover for ice coffee. Everyone is really happy with the ice coffee, not a big coffee town i guess. We have been gradually increasing our quality, always had great drip but now can make proper lattes.   I guess i would like to increase coffee sales and variety in the future im just not sure our clientel cares about newer brewing methods. Just trying to see if anyone finds cold brew a waste of beans or pour over a waste of labor. Especially in non coffee fanatic markets.   We just don't want to be fussy, we would like people to walk in and appreciate the quality of the product though. (We are a bakery first and coffee shop second)."
cafe,39xsvq,crowcawer,1 point,Mon Jun 15 19:23:05 2015 UTC,"That sounds really cool.   I would back up the idea that if you are interested in the process don't be afraid to offer it. Usually it is served at a higher cost due to the input of time and bean quality.   I have seen it come in and out of vogue in different places, but keeping a good beehive around isn't a bad idea. In my shop we probably get 5% of our customers asking about pour overs. We also sell the tools for it on the side."
cafe,39xsvq,Xkot,5,Sun Jul 12 06:36:58 2015 UTC,"Cold brew is a good way to use beans that are getting close to being too old to use for conventional brew - it still tastes excellent, and you gain some savings by using whatever high quality beans you carry that didn't happen to sell out.   My favorite local place that offers pour-overs does so with a selection of 3 different single origins that all have different flavor profiles. They can't offer that range of selection in pre-brewed coffee due to the waste in time / beans since they don't have to keep 3 different conventionally brewed coffees at all times."
cafe,39xsvq,monigram,1 point,Mon Jun 15 18:11:07 2015 UTC,Pour overs are also a great way to let people sample coffee if you sell retail beans.
cafe,39xsvq,monigram,1 point,Tue Jun 16 00:52:39 2015 UTC,"Do you sell pour over during morning rushes? I remember when i first started to see them in california, when i lived there years ago. People would serve drip from airpots then switch to pourovers only in the afternoon.  I see the retail bean reasoning we never had turnover with that so we only sell retail if we have enough beans to sell and someone asks specifically for it. I dont really see alot of people wanting to buy bulk beans here unless we added roasting. And if you add roasting you have to add to the brewed menu....."
cafe,39xsvq,RadRhino,1 point,Tue Jun 16 08:59:01 2015 UTC,"We offer all slow bar options in all open hours, but we roast, so retail sales is being encouraged by a try before you buy approach, offering simulations of home techniques.  French press, Aeropress, Chemex, Clever, Siphon, Pour over - on demand.  Buy a pound and the sample's on us.  It means a little more staffing for busy times, but the upside seems worth it.  We will often turn off the brewer (in which we only offer one choice) during slow times, and depending on the conversation it's either proceed to slow bar, or maybe an Americano for the price of a medium brew. Those result in a pretty high conversion rate off the brewer towards better coffee on return. And yes I do mean better coffee. The brewer has fresh well roasted coffee, but it lacks the control for the premium cup."

cafe,37f5ud,Nukutu,1 point,Thu May 28 00:38:13 2015 UTC,"I'm looking at getting one of he Black Eagles when I eventually get around to opening up my own store. What machine were you using before? I've seen a demo of the machine, but haven't had the chance to actually play with one yet. ""Gravimetrics"" are obviously a big selling point of the machine; are you finding that it holds up well compared to more traditional methods?"
cafe,379z6v,SwellandDecay,2,Tue May 26 01:59:14 2015 UTC,"Okay. Someone is going to have to explain to me what I'm not getting. Barista for a year and a half, still have trouble doing hearts. I have carpal tunnel, so maybe that's my big issue."
cafe,379z6v,togepi258,2,Tue May 26 05:04:37 2015 UTC,"Watch a lot of YouTube videos of people doing it before going to work. Also, can anybody else at your work do latte art? You might just be working with a shit steam wand, pitcher, espresso."
cafe,379z6v,gassy_broccoli_fart,2,Tue May 26 13:17:09 2015 UTC,I would say that 90% of my pours look like amorphous blobs at this point. This one just happened to be lucky to be honest. For some reason I'm noticing that pouring rosetta's is easier than hearts if only for the reason that it's more forgiving in regards to symmetry.   I've found this video to be the most helpful as well: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7E0zWZjhhw  Good luck and keep at it!

cafe,379z6v,gassy_broccoli_fart,1 point,Wed May 27 00:17:21 2015 UTC,"It must be my steam wand and pitcher then. I work at a Starbucks, and we don't exactly get to work with the best utensils. Thanks a ton for the help, guys. Maybe I'll just buy my own pitcher and take it to work with me =)"
cafe,379z6v,BaronMatfei,1 point,Wed May 27 01:47:14 2015 UTC,"Does your pitcher look anything like this one from the SB blog? If so that should be fine - the pitcher just needs a pouring spout (I bought a cheapo one from Amazon, nothing fancy).  So maybe during less busy times you can just work on getting your milk to the right consistency.  Maybe the folks at /r/starbucks can also give you some tips, they're obviously more familiar with the equipment than I am.  I've probably watched hours and hours of Youtube videos of pros doing their magic and listening to their explanations.  I'm still a total noob, but thank god for Youtube.  Never would have been able to learn on my own otherwise."

It's a special one to me, because I get to talk about one of my favorite professors from when I was an undergrad, and then have him come on and speak for himself!

cafe,36bq8b,dreamschool,3,Mon May 18 02:24:12 2015 UTC,Those are some weird-looking espresso machines!
cafe,36bq8b,RadRhino,2,Mon May 18 21:42:43 2015 UTC,Great set up! That moka pot hanging out in the background is gorgeous. It almost looks like a matte finish. Goes nicely with rest.
cafe,36bq8b,bamasteeler,2,Mon May 18 03:58:07 2015 UTC,What is that cold brewer exactly? It doesnt look like most of the others I have seen..
cafe,36bq8b,booradly,3,Mon May 18 13:16:53 2015 UTC,Looks like a Tiamo cold dripper.
cafe,36bwqe,jja619,9,Mon May 18 03:26:20 2015 UTC,Could have posted this without the creepy preface... :)
cafe,36bwqe,patrick_mc,3,Mon May 18 15:13:41 2015 UTC,"Could have, but I can't be the only one who does that... For the cool latte art of course..."
cafe,36bwqe,booradly,3,Mon May 18 22:23:04 2015 UTC,Anyone know the device behind her in the thumbnail? Looks vintage but unsure... =)
