I'm probably going to wait and go when they've more or less ironed out some of the kinks. I understand a wait for a table, but in Astoria a 70 minute wait is fucking bullshit. That's a big turnoff for me. And yes, I'm old and cranky about this."

It tastes different from what they used to use, which to me, frankly, tasted like it had been frozen before. I have heard talk over the years that the game meats are frozen.

The food, though, was unforgivable. I had the Catfish Biscuit, and it was the blandest thing imaginable. Cooked nicely, but no seasoning whatsover. This was presented atop a fairly large biscuit that was not-so-flakey, as much as it was soggy, since it was piled with an excessive amount of field greens that did nothing for the dish. The whole plate quickly became a deconstructed salad with soggy biscuit croutons. The menu also indicated that the biscuit would be served with pickles, but they were out, so in their place arrived slimy okra. Draughts were also overpriced ($8 for Singlecut??? The brew/pub is local!)   Doubt I'll return anytime soon, unless something drastically changes with that operation."

astoria,3dyhv8,Ramses_L_Smuckles,3,Mon Jul 20 21:11:28 2015 UTC,My pleasure. I know I have great neighbours and I hope eventually our corner of Reddit reflects that.
astoria,3dyhv8,BlackLabAlpha,3,Mon Jul 20 21:14:55 2015 UTC,I hope future bike lanes will be separated.  Since moving to Astoria I've been hit by one car and nearly hit by several others while walking (with the light/right-of-way) in crosswalks.  There are a substantial number of people in this part of Queens who simply don't know how to drive.  I suspect that's driven in large part by the ubiquitous funemployed mamas boys who get their parents' old Acuras and rice them out to show off on 30th Ave.
astoria,3dyhv8,annihilus813,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:08:47 2015 UTC,"One of my buddies and I were talking about this yesterday and apparently all the other Community Board areas leading into CB1 have pretty good bike lane coverage and upkeep with new-style lanes coming, but everything just disappears the minute they hit CB1.  I've noticed this a bit in my own commuting and rides. Our bike lanes are pretty terrible. It also seems to have gotten a lot worse in the last year as there are more cyclists on the road and fewer drivers used to having them on the road."
astoria,3dyhv8,Rob_G,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:14:23 2015 UTC,"I've also been hit by a car and nearly hit by several others.  I walk my dog daily to Astoria Park and the intersection of Hoyt Ave South and 21st Street is a complete mess—particularly southbound drivers making the left onto Hoyt Ave South.  They try to fly by to beat oncoming traffic and most gesture angrily to pedestrians who are midway through the crosswalk while the light is counting down.  I fully agree there are a LOT of people in Astoria or commuting through who don't know how to drive.  That said, the new safety barriers at the intersection shows some promise.  I really wish, however, that there would be a dedicated left hand light for that intersection.  Even if drivers aren't trying to make it through the intersection, there is a ton of angry honking as other left turn drivers are stalled, waiting for a break in oncoming traffic."
astoria,3dyhv8,Rob_G,2,Mon Jul 20 19:28:59 2015 UTC,"If he wants to help his case, I'd connect these new proposed bike paths with the other existing/proposed ones along Vernon.  It would demonstrate the benefit of making a more connected Queens bike network."
astoria,3dyhv8,Rob_G,2,Mon Jul 20 19:34:51 2015 UTC,"More bike lanes are always welcome. I'd also like to see one on Crescent, seeing as how it's the only direct shot through Astoria to the Queensboro Bridge. The option as it stands is to go to Vernon Blvd., which is nice and empty, although you have to cut through the Queensbridge Houses to get to the bridge."
astoria,3dyhv8,Rob_G,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:36:13 2015 UTC,"I would certainly appreciate that too (I got doored pretty bad by a delivery truck on Crescent last Monday). However, to work it would probably get rid of one lane of parking and the NYPD would actually have to do something about the intersection just ahead of Queens Plaza."

astoria,3e06qs,lykos11,5,Tue Jul 21 02:39:31 2015 UTC,I am def passing on this place. As you said the prices are too much. High prices should reflect quality but what it seems like is going on here is price gouging.
astoria,3e06qs,JohnnyCashFan69,4,Mon Jul 20 23:41:30 2015 UTC,"At least glad I'm not alone in the opinion. It's a shame, though. I really wanted to like Queen's Comfort, too, but after two unimpressive meals at their price points, I guess I'm going to have to live with a lack of good terrible-for-you-home-cooking in Astoria. At least there are plenty of greasy spoon diners in the area."
astoria,3e06qs,PerlenketteFurDich,3,Tue Jul 21 01:23:27 2015 UTC,"Price gouging means that a new, higher price is being charged for a newly scarce item. ie, water after a storm that's triggered a boil order.  That said, the Bareburger Brothers only see dollar signs. But you know, 30th is a pub crawl now so what did you expect? Prepare to say goodbye to every tiny local business as the building owners jack up their rents."
astoria,3e06qs,bauser81,4,Tue Jul 21 01:04:23 2015 UTC,"I went last week. I recommend you try it. It's easy to get fixated on price, especially in Astoria, but in my dining experience I would say that the quality of food, the tight service and the design is worth it. Just don't go in thinking they're going for authentic southern cuisine, because it's really just New American with southern influences. The fried chicken was very juicy on the inside and crispy on the outside without being too oily. The biscuits were huge things unlike what one would make at home, but keep in mind they're made with duck fat so they're very rich and a bit more dense than what you would get using butter or shortening. For 11 bucks you get a drumstick, a thigh, a biscuit and a pickle. That was enough for me and quite satisfying, even though we also ordered the pickle plate ($9, really good pickled veg) and crispy potato ($7, smashed potatoes that were indeed crispy) apps. Some other people at the table got the roasted broccoli entree (good but not great, could have used more caramelization from the fire but I think the wood oven burns too hot) and the biscuit sandwich (the sandwich had too much batter on the chicken). I would definitely recommend the fried chicken, pickle plate and crispy potatoes. I'm not sold on the sandwiches or the wood oven stuff yet. All told, the tab for 4 people without drinks (we drank at dominies happy hour while waiting for our table, bonus you can watch your spot on the wait list from your phone) was $68.   That being said I think it's a once-in-a-while joint instead of being in my regular rotation of Astoria restaurants. I'm not really in the habit of doing fried chicken that often and that's the real draw of the place in my opinion. Your mileage may vary."
astoria,3e06qs,bauser81,3,Tue Jul 21 02:55:18 2015 UTC,"$68 for 4 people isn't bad at all, actually. Does it feel like some of the wood fire and sandwich stuff may get better as time goes on, or is this too much of a chain-type joint for those kinds of improvements?"
astoria,3e06qs,clangcorridor,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:00:06 2015 UTC,"I am a bit skeptical of the wood oven because it runs super hot/fast and makes more sense for neapolitan pizza than roast vegetables. What you end up with in the case of broccoli is charred parts, tasty parts, and undercooked parts because it's so uneven. The biscuit sandwiches seem like a gimmick because I don't see how it could be properly balanced with the biscuit dough and chicken batter competing for attention (sodium attack).  The thing is, I don't think the bareburger folks are thinking of this place as a franchise like the parent chain. From what I've read in Eater/NYT the only franchise possibility for Burnside is an express/fast-casual counter and not a sit-down restaurant concept. My understanding is the Astoria location is that it's a test-bed, sort of like what David Chang is doing with Fuku and Shake Shack is doing with the chicken burgers at their Brooklyn locations, so improvements are definitely possible.   All I'm trying to get across is that the price-hate is both correct and incorrect because they're trying to do something specific, it's not perfect, and they'd be stupid to ignore any backlash and adjust accordingly. On a realted note, I just saw the gothamist review and totally understand what is the turn-off for some people (but keeping in mind that gothamist is a unique beast in its own right). In the end it may not last and may not be popular with the local populace, but they made deliberate decisions and invested heavily in the location by renovating, employing a decent-sized back- and front-of-house and bringing some attention to the neighborhood whether we like it or not because our rents tick ever upwards."
astoria,3e06qs,DanPinto,1 point,Wed Jul 22 02:13:24 2015 UTC,That $11 plate sounds more reasonable than some things on the menu - I'd probably go for that if/when I try the place. Thanks for the tip.

At least where I am, north of the Grand Central. I like that they have the commerical overlays in the right spot, and that much of the area has been downzoned to R5B, which requires aligned fronts, limits heights, etc.   It will ensure that our sleepy side streets remain as such.

astoria,3dy31f,HeyItsMau,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:28:07 2015 UTC,"Whether something is expensive or not tends to be a relative determination.  I can think of only 2 places in Astoria where you can get a meatball hero for less than $8.  One of them is Dino's on Broadway and the other is Napoli on 35th Avenue.  Call me crazy, but I am inclined to think that the quality of the meat that goes into Mighty Ball's meatballs is higher than either of Dino's or Napoli's.  So, at least you are getting what you pay for."

Pretty much any non-descript pizza shop will have it. Just off the top of my head, Taste of Italy and Mia Pizza both have $5 meatball subs."

I'm positive Mighty Balls will rate higher for more complex flavors and quality than a $5 meatball sub. I was simply pointing out that you don't have to look very hard to find a meatball hero for under $8 here or anywhere in NYC.   Whether or not it's worth it is subjective. But to say it's rare to find it at that price range is patently wrong. I would argue that $6.00 is the norm for a meatball parm sub.

They are reasonably priced and flexible and don't require a minimum of 6 months commitment in order to see some savings. They let you go month to month which comes in really handy on months that you take vacation or during the holidays. He learned more faster and got a better work out. When he comes home he's WIPED - and that's no easy task for my son.

A sign on the window says a liquor license application has been filed by ""LYH Hospitality Group.""  Speaking of Francis Cafe, it's closed through August for summer holiday (oh, to be French!) The former Allstate Insurance office (next to Thirsty Koala) is under renovation. It's going to be a bubble tea place. The manicure place next to Taverna Kyclades is closed. My barbers (next door) have no word on what's going in there, but the Taverna is taking advantage by extending their sidewalk seating in front of the empty storefront.  My barbers also say they don't know what's going into the former Marathon Bank branch across the street (33rd & Ditmars), despite the rumors in this thread that it's going to be the new home to Lefkos Pyrgos Okeanos - that seafood restaurant on 35th & Ditmars that is never busy - is finally up for sale.

astoria,3dmhq6,Jfern022,2,Sat Jul 18 13:38:22 2015 UTC,"I never understood the appeal of Trader Joe's. I went there for the first time recently, expecting some sort of Taj Mahal version of a grocery store. Instead, I walked in and was immediately underwhelmed by the size. It was so small. I couldn't think about it for long though, because after about ten seconds or so, I realized that a giant line had formed behind me, and I was soon getting pushed out of the way from every angle. When I did manage to get a look through the hoard of shoppers at the produce, it was nothing but aisle after aisle of pre-packaged hippie snack food, like organic vegan chocolate covered pretzels, or miso agave soy crisps. No thanks, I'll take Trade Fair or even Associated over Trader Joe's any day of the week."
astoria,3dmhq6,Rob_G,3,Sun Jul 19 02:22:54 2015 UTC,"Trader Joe's is at its core a suburban entity - it was founded in the suburbs of Pasadena and I think does best in those kinds of area. In NYC TJs is a madhouse and the insanity level is off the charts as far as crowding and lines. I've never encountered such a rough experience at any TJs outside of NYC and I've been to them in different states.  Lollygagging down the aisles - something you can do in TJs outside of NYC - as a chance to discover new products is almost impossible here in NYC. You have to be quick and agile and I can understand how that would put a damper on things enough to deter some from coming in and shopping.  However, there are some great products there at very fair prices. I've been shopping for years and years and years so I know what I like and where to find it. I also love the staff, especially the individuals who ring up my purchases; their attitudes are always friendly and helpful, and frankly a lot of places could learn a lot from them about customer service.  Another issues: NY's laws about liquor and that Trader Joe's can only have one shop selling wine IN ALL OF NY STATE. Part of the appeal at TJs outside of NY State is the affordable pricing on wine.  I'm a big fan of Trader Joe's, and while I'd welcome one to Astoria, I'm not pushing for it. I like being able to get interesting products at Parrot Market, Euro Market, Rio Market, Astoria Bier & Cheese, Rosario's, Sorisso's, Greenbay, the greenmarkets, and other great local spots. I certainly don't think Key Food or Associated - two jokes of supermarket, but it's what we have, so I deal with them - top Trader Joe's at all and I find myself often frustrated at our broad chain supermarkets in NYC because of the low level of service and courtesy.  TL;DR: Trader Joe's has great products and delicious snacks that are mostly fairly priced; is better than our conventional supermarkets; but is unpleasantly executed in the urban density of NYC. I'd support a Fairway in Astoria, too."
astoria,3dmhq6,clangcorridor,2,Sun Jul 19 17:11:50 2015 UTC,"Holy shit, Fairway, now we're talking. That place is grocery nirvana."
astoria,3dmhq6,Rob_G,2,Sun Jul 19 17:46:52 2015 UTC,I think Fairway would be welcomed with open arms in Astoria.
astoria,3dmhq6,clangcorridor,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:54:50 2015 UTC,"Well one positive is that they price nationally, so unlike other stores that gouge prices due to being in NYC, they have much more realistic prices for their products. It is unfortunately a mad house, but they do stock really great products for the price, and have a 'buzz', so that's the unfortunate reality.  Though I don't get your last sentiment, it's not like Trade Fair or Associated are going anywhere. Especially as a result of Trader Joe's which only have a handful of stores comparatively and cater to different markets. /u/clangcorridor gave a much better breakdown of comparitive grocery stores in astoria that fill that role."

astoria,3dmhq6,BDerby26,4,Fri Jul 17 19:39:08 2015 UTC,Has anyone been to Gossip Coffee yet? The idea of cold brew and iced tea on tap is intriguing. Looks like it could be a good first date spot.
astoria,3dmhq6,rockamole,7,Fri Jul 17 14:03:22 2015 UTC,"Spent the day at Gossip yesterday! Was working from home, so I was there from about noon - 7 PM. There is ample comfortable seating, basically an outlet per seat, a bathroom, and a really beautiful outdoor area. The cold brew was either $3.50 or $3.75...I forget. It was definitely tasty and it was kinda fun watching it come out on tap - plus they had two roasts to choose from. There's also 8 iced teas on tap, I believe. The pudding is laughably expensive ($8.50 for like, 4 ounces...? no thanks) but their pastries are between $3-4 which seems reasonable in the area. Kind of an old school playlist, too.  I also brought some donuts into work for people to taste test, and we agreed that while tasty, Dough reigns supreme. So Kinship still wins on that front.  Kinda hurts my heart to say this, because I've been going to Kinship since it first opened, but Gossip was really great and the employees were very friendly. As of now it seems like they only sell ""Gossip"" roast coffee, so if you're looking for Stumptown/Heart/etc then Kinship is still the one. But...yeah. I definitely recommend you check it out!"
astoria,3dmhq6,spareasquare,4,Fri Jul 17 14:25:25 2015 UTC,"You can also get cold brew on tap at Kickshaw and 60 Beans. I'm looking forward to checking out Gossip, though. Too bad about the pricey rice pudding. I wonder why the price point is so high? It's so easy to make, unlike something like croissants, where I understand why they cost so much (it takes a lot of time and learning to make them well)."

astoria,3dmhq6,FrankiePoops,2,Fri Jul 17 15:05:52 2015 UTC,"I think it depends on how the vegan individual looks at all animal products. To make butter, the cow needs to make milk, and to do that they must be with calf.

astoria,3dkbjr,zaloni,5,Thu Jul 16 23:29:36 2015 UTC,"I for one have been wishing for this for YEARS. If ever there was a poor use of space, this block is it. All of the buildings are only one story, even though it is on a commercial street and nearly every adjoining block has buildings at least 4 stories tall. That block feels downmarket and dingy compared to the rest of the area, and it's too desolate at night once all the stores are shuttered. As a resident and homeowner (~1 block away) I'm in favor of this change.  I found an article about this: http://falcoisak.com/our-company/news/articles/featured-closing-21-25-31st-street-astoria-ny-11105-635m/, from back in January. Worth noting that ABC still has two years left on their lease, so we won't see action any time soon!"
astoria,3dkbjr,queensbee,2,Fri Jul 17 13:41:08 2015 UTC,"That block is a great example of a ""taxpayer"". Taxpayer is a FD term for 1-2 story commercial buildings like those. The thought process behind the name is that landlords throw up a cheap commercial building and rent it out to pay the taxes/bills. They're all over the city and I'm sure in part they're a holdover from when real estate was less in demand.   With the shortage in housing and the amount of money that can be made by creating new housing I'm sure they will be on the decline everywhere, though especially in neighborhoods like Astoria."

astoria,3dkbjr,andthisiswhere,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:58:06 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the link, and agreed on the sentiment.  I am surprised it has taken so long.  While it will increase population (and therefore parking headaches, and train crowding), this is how development of the area was intended.  I'm happy with this in exchange for all the downzoning from a few years ago. It assures that north-of-Grand Central will retain or enhance its character.   While ABC might have two years on their lease, I wouldn't be surprised if it was bought out."
astoria,3dkbjr,queensbee,1 point,Sat Jul 18 03:06:15 2015 UTC,"Re: parking, new development is required to include some parking spaces, though the quantity varies depending on the zoning (http://furmancenter.org/files/publications/furman_parking_requirements_policy_brief_3_21_12_final.pdf); I've noticed that the two big new buildings on 33rd btw 21st and Ditmars both have parking. So I'm optimistic that it won't bring any more parking congestion (and frankly, it's not bad in this area anyway). Train crowding is another matter...."

That's pretty far out of Astoria, but he does such excellent work that I thought I'd pass on his name anyway.  I had a tooth with a root killed by impact to the jaw and adjacent molar, and my molars tend to have several strong and twisted roots.  He got the whole thing done in about 3 hours over 2 visits and it was thorough and painless and the post was at exactly the correct height for the crown."

I had a root canal from them 3 months ago and I'm still dealing with the fallout. After the root canal I wasnt given any antibiotics or pain killers, and I ended up having a moderate infection in my jaw line to where an endodontist had to open my gum line up to drain it out. My jaw line was super swollen for a couple of days. I'm still feeling tenderness and they haven't put the crown on yet due to that fact. I realize that an infection can happen to anyone, but not giving an antibiotic was obvious step #1 that they didn't take. There were also some questionable Dental assistants like one who wasn't able to find surgical gloves that could fit her hands so instead she wanted to use the yellow gloves that you usually find under the sink. They were just laying out so definitely not sterile. Thankfully the main dentist caught a glimpse of what she was attempting to do and scolded her.  EDIT: My regular dentist is Dr. Yeres, and he's super nice and generally an awesome dentist, I'd recommend him. I wasnt able to have my root canal done by him because mine was an emergency and it was going to be difficult finding a spot in his schedule the week my tooth was acting up."

At most, it can be a nuisance if the person taking the bottles is not retying up the bags and is making a mess, but in my experience they are usually pretty responsible and reasonable.   My dad is a building superintendent and I helped him throw out the trash on trash days. The lady who collected on our block would come right as were throwing it out, ask for the bottles and we let her rummage through and she went on her way. Since we were still in the process of throwing out the bags we retied them ourselves (or left them open until she came.) However, on days when our schedules didn't sync up we'd occasionally find bags tied up loosely, a mark that she had at them. It's not a big deal, as long as they can stay shut, and if they are making a mess it would just be easier to politely ask them to do so than to stir up a big stink.  As for the legality of all this, I don't really know, nor care. They are very poor people trying to make some money in an honest way that doesn't harm anyone. Let them take the bottles and everyone's happy."

astoria,3ck35a,healthstudent,9,Wed Jul 8 16:33:06 2015 UTC,"Really?  Get over it man.  The people taking these bottles and cans to collect a measly five cents on need it more then you or the city.  Hell, you should just separate them out for them so they don't even have to dig through it."
astoria,3ck35a,SkyNet2k,7,Wed Jul 8 16:33:55 2015 UTC,They steal recycling so that they can turn the bottle / can in for 5 cents. If you're concerned about the environment then rest assured everything is still getting recycled - people are just making small change doing it themselves.   I wouldn't worry about reporting it - but this is why you should always shred your documents in NYC.
astoria,3ck35a,dreddriver,-17,Wed Jul 8 15:09:36 2015 UTC,Doesn't the city rely on the same 5c/bottle to offset the cost of the recycling program though? And can someone comment on the legality of this?

astoria,3ck35a,Bubugacz,11,Wed Jul 8 16:22:55 2015 UTC,"Anyone is free to bring their bottles and cans to a recycling center for 5 cents a piece. If you did it yourself instead of putting it out on the sidewalk for collection, it wouldn't be illegal, even though you're maybe cutting into the city's recycling profits. I say maybe because I'm not sure if the recycling program is actually subsidized by the metal and plastic they recycle.  That being said, I read somewhere that as soon as you place something out on the curb it becomes city property so you can be ticketed for ""stealing"" it. Apparently this has become an issue with scrap metal collectors grabbing trashed appliances, but I haven't heard anything about cans and bottles.  Either way, they need the 5 cents more than I do so I let them have it."
astoria,3ck35a,MadnessofKingHippo,3,Wed Jul 8 15:32:00 2015 UTC,"Boy are you a miser.

Can I ask what problem you have with this? The bottles are getting recycled, it just sounds like you want to give some homeless person a hard time."
astoria,3ck35a,dreddriver,-15,Wed Jul 8 15:26:25 2015 UTC,You pay the city to collect your recycling and the program offsets its costs by selling the recycled goods. When a private entity takes this money the cost of the recycling program goes up.
astoria,3ck35a,dreddriver,14,Wed Jul 8 15:38:13 2015 UTC,You already gave the city your 5 cents when you bought the bottle. If you return the bottle yourself you get your 5 cents BACK. The city already made the money. You have no idea what you are talking about and obviously just want to give poor / homeless people a hard time.
astoria,3ck35a,TitanGuardian,-10,Wed Jul 8 15:45:11 2015 UTC,"Actually that 5c is a STATE tax, not city tax and collection is a CITY program. By giving the bottles to the city you make the recycling program, which you pay for by living here, cheaper so you still get that money back. A bit of a reduced rate, but its the convenience fee for not feeding those bottles into a machine one by one."
astoria,3ck35a,aceshighsays,9,Wed Jul 8 15:51:00 2015 UTC,And the recycling program is funded by STATE tax. What is your problem with people taking recycling? I doubt you could show any proof that homeless people taking recycling adds to our taxes.   If you are so concerned with funding then why are you not fighting for wine bottles / sports drinks / soda to require the 5 cent deposit? Wouldn't that make a bigger difference then giving people a hard time?

I haven't ever looked into it though. I in no way consider this stealing.
astoria,3ck35a,aceshighsays,5,Tue Jul 14 21:49:42 2015 UTC,I specifically tie my recycling bags into an easily untie-able bow versus a knot so that folks can easily get in and out without making a mess.

So it's a stalemate and it is there stuck in all its ugly glory, the owner will not renovate, sometimes even comes there to spend the night believe it or not. The whole block hates it but nothing can be done. It's been like that for years and there is no relief in site."

astoria,3ccb22,clangcorridor,5,Tue Jul 7 00:16:23 2015 UTC,"An address would have been helpful.  I think it is 32-49 37th st.    You can get information from the ample public records systems in NYC.  But they use the BBL system (Borough, Block, Lot).  You can convert from street address to BBL using this site: http://webapps.nyc.gov:8084/CICS/fin1/find001i    You can get property value assement, property tax & payment history, etc., from here:  http://nycprop.nyc.gov/nycproperty/nynav/jsp/selectbbl.jsp    You can use acris (a836-acris.nyc.gov) to find out transaction history, who owns it, etc.      You can use the department of buildings Buildings Information System (BIS) site to understand the certificate of occupancy, violations, complaints, etc.  http://a810-bisweb.nyc.gov/bisweb/bispi00.jsp    Assuming I have the correct address (and I stress that I might not!), the BBL is 4-655-18.  Again, assuming the address (and therefore BBL) is correct, here's a link to BIS: http://a810-bisweb.nyc.gov/bisweb/PropertyProfileOverviewServlet?boro=4&block=655&lot=18&go3=+GO+&requestid=0    Full vacate exists on this property, and many complaints for  a small building.  Go have a read.    If you go to any of the these sites, you'll quickly find the owner's name.  If you google the name, you'll find these gems: http://nypost.com/2009/10/11/nude-neighbor-a-bit-too-in-tents/ http://queenscrap.blogspot.com/2009/10/astoria-man-living-in-tent.html http://7online.com/archive/7062368/    etc.    I hesitate to post this one, but if you search the owner's name, you'll find quite a depressing long-form comment:    http://ppjg.me/2011/01/24/how-a-fraudulent-guardianship-commences-and-continues/    Regarding the post of 'owner wants a lot of money' by my buddy Johnny Cash, I'm sure that's true, but it is probably more nuanced than that.  This guys doesn't seem to be of sound mind.  And while the owner might not be in a fully healthy state of mind, he might also very well have been taken advantage of.  I only have hearsay as a backup, but I have heard stories about the Vallones identifying vulnerable property owners and working schemes to have eventual ownership transfers to self or associates. I have no proof of this, and I am sure there are other sides to the stories I have heard, but this particular case seems to have common elements.  I really don't care to pursue, but wouldn't mind to see what kind of hearsay others have seen on the topic."

If you wanna get hardcore about it, I'd recommend Cimexa (similar to diatomaceous earth), which is a powder I had to use for bedbugs. Haven't seen bedbugs in months (applied it after having a professional treatment), but have seen other bugs turn up dying or dead now that the weather is warmer. The advantage to the powders is that the texture cuts up their exoskeleton and they dehydrate and die. Muahaha."

EDIT 2:  Yeah, the new butcher shop is nice, but also directly across from Ditmars train.  The 3 shops and the bakery are cordoned off.  I am going to be much dissapoint if it's just another bank.  There are 4 on that block."
astoria,3bofgn,powerdeamon,1 point,Wed Jul 1 21:07:23 2015 UTC,I wonder if the butcher is the same people who ran it before or are they new owners? I'd love to see them continue to carry Murray's chicken or something else organic/natural.
astoria,3bofgn,j-3p1percub,0,Thu Jul 2 16:32:07 2015 UTC,I'm also curious to see what's up with that space - they tore down the walls between the three spaces and now it's one big space. Maybe a barbecue hall?

astoria,3bmmc9,skatobetho,2,Tue Jun 30 14:53:08 2015 UTC,I'm very sorry to hear that =( It's unfortunate that it takes a tragedy to make a change sometimes...
astoria,3bmmc9,audionaught,1 point,Wed Jul 1 00:01:34 2015 UTC,These kinds of tragedies have been making zero change in NYC.  It might as well be legal to mow people down in a vehicle.  Nothing is going to change until there are MUCH more severe laws in place for killing someone while you are behind the wheel.
astoria,3bmmc9,pubstar,6,Wed Jul 1 15:20:38 2015 UTC,I'm glad he turned himself in.... More speed bumps on 19th St and Ditmars right there going down the hill toward the water would be great. Also any kind of ordinance that can make those people on their 4 wheelers and ridiculously loud motorcycles would be a plus as well.
astoria,3bmmc9,audionaught,2,Tue Jun 30 14:00:42 2015 UTC,The ordinance is that it's illegal. Still can't do anything about it.
astoria,3bmmc9,whyhaveihave,1 point,Thu Jul 2 03:04:05 2015 UTC,You know speed bumps would just make all of the loud cars / motorcycles louder right? Having to downshift and keep it in first gear just causes more loud accelerations then braking and repeat. The quads are already illegal and some motorcycles are loud. You're always going to trade some peace and quiet for living in a city - especially near a busy place such as a bar or park.

If you have renter's insurance or homeowners insurance, it may cover part of the loss, though, and you'll need a report for that.   You may wish to check local bike shops to see if they have a used bike for sale that matches yours."

astoria,3avlnv,bulbishNYC,2,Wed Jun 24 00:16:57 2015 UTC,"Go check out Cyclo on Vernon Blvd. in LIC. It's a little far from Astoria proper, but it's worth the trip."
astoria,3avlnv,Rob_G,2,Tue Jun 23 22:45:08 2015 UTC,"You can get ok Vietnamese food in the city but nothing great. There just isn't a huge Vietnamese population here. Closest really great Vietnamese food is in Eden Center, Virginia. For even closer pretty good Vietnamese food, it's only an hour and a half drive to Philadelphia.   An Choi in the Lower East Side is decent but pricey. For traditional Vietnamese I would have to go with Pho Vietnam in Brooklyn, or Com Tam Ninh Kieu in the Bronx."

If you catch them with a full pot of broth, it's good but if they had many customers that day, they add water and the broth will taste a bit watered down. Thai Son doesn't really use the right aromatics so I'm not a fan."

astoria,3aw32v,WeDoWork,3,Wed Jun 24 16:19:12 2015 UTC,"I have never heard of this place so I decided to check yelp and found this fantastic review:   When I think of the words ""Admiral's Club"" I have images of deck-ay-danse. Not decadence, the first one, with the francophone flourish. I imagine a world where pilots toast champagne at 30,000 feet, plow stewardesses two, three - fuck - four at a time and eat steak au poivre beside a Parisian moonrise. Those where the days of Pan-Am and unfiltered cigarettes - days that have long since receded from memory.  This bar evokes none of this. It didn't smell so much like shit as it did like farts. Bottled, raw and without any humorous gusto. I drank my beer without moving it from my nose to avoid tasting one of the floaters. The scent of stale beer and decade old flatulence sent me heading for the exit.  Try and see for yourself.  Just don't go expecting any admirals to drop by.   Not sure if that makes me want to check it out, but he did give it 5 stars!  http://www.yelp.com/biz/lavelles-admirals-club-astoria"

I've been in the same situation where some Euro trash twat feels they can cut the line because they are from the same bankrupt country as the owner.  You have to speak up, man! ""Hey, come on w/ this over?!?"", and toss your arms up. Even it it doesn't work, at least you tried, and now everyone in the line has seen this display of dominance and will let you back into the mix. By not making a fuss, you failed the rest of the line, and that's why they were reluctant to let you back in line.  Also, the length of your post is unnecessary. It's great you like to write, but an important part of writing is editing!"
astoria,3ayrtj,eazynii,8,Wed Jun 24 17:21:38 2015 UTC,Thanks to the internet we have a glut of people who want to be writers but are terrible at it. Not only that but many have to rely on gimmicks because their writing is so bad. Some are lazy and do lists. Others are overtly verbose like Rob.
astoria,3ayrtj,JohnnyCashFan69,-6,Wed Jun 24 17:43:04 2015 UTC,"Well, I don't really consider 800 words to be that lengthy. What did it take you, like two, three minutes to read? And I'm resigned to the fact that maybe not all of my pieces will be home runs, and maybe I won't get approval from everyone on the Internet. But I'm still going to write, I hope to improve with practice, and I'm not going to let negative responses deter me from posting.

This is not your Xanga page, it's a public forum for people w/ limited attention spans. I read your posts w/ the same enthusiasm as someone rubber necking on the highway, taking in an atrocious accident. I'd love to see more posts from you w/ some consideration for the audience's time.

astoria,3apwsy,aranger,3,Mon Jun 22 15:28:27 2015 UTC,"If you're near the q19 bus, it takes less than 30 minutes to get to Flushing where dim sum is plenty"
astoria,3apwsy,dunderball,3,Tue Jun 23 03:49:22 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately, the closest restaurants for good, affordable dim sum would be  Flushing.  Jade or Asian Jewels are the old favorites.  They're both easily accessible by car or subway.  They're a few blocks away from Main Street and there are muni-lots close by.  Personally, I find that taking an empty 7 train on a weekend morning to be relaxing.  The subways are full of sunlight and the ride is only 25-30 min from Queensboro Plaza at off peak times.    There's a also newer one in the new Flushing Mall, but I didn't like the set up.  The carts couldn't maneuver around to all the tables, so we had to get up and bring the dishes over ourselves."
astoria,3apwsy,scotchtapered,3,Tue Jun 23 14:24:52 2015 UTC,I go to East Ocean Palace which is off the E and F train at 75th Ave.  Its best to get there early (like 11am) since it get SUPER crowded on the weekends with large families.
astoria,3apwsy,sylvatron,1 point,Mon Jun 22 16:43:12 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I totally second this place. The line is long, but they'll get you a table pretty quickly. If you've never done dim sum before, just take it slow once you get there. All of the vendors make commission selling their specific item, and they're pretty aggressive about it. There is a ton of food going around, so try to space things out a bit."
astoria,3apwsy,Rob_G,2,Tue Jun 23 22:48:05 2015 UTC,I go to what I think is called Good Seafood Restaurant in Flushing. It's my personal favorite dim sum place and the city and pretty cheap. Usually leave full for less than $25 for two people.
astoria,3apwsy,Dudecity,1 point,Mon Jun 22 16:53:12 2015 UTC,Depends if you're driving or taking the train I guess.  The most accessible by car and my favorite spot in Queens (I generally think Sunset Park has better places) is Lake Pavilion in Flushing. It's right at the exit and has a (paid) parking lot so it's pretty convenient.   I haven't eaten Dim Sum in Elmhurst except at Ping's which wasn't great and East Manor which was terrible but I don't think they're around anymore. Can't say for other places but they might be more accessible by train.

I passed by the Salvation Army store today, Sunday, when they're closed and a bunch of people had left their donations out in front of the store. Meanwhile, several women with carts, etc, were picking through the bags to find stuff they wanted. I guess what I don't understand is, why bring your stuff all the way to the Salvation Army if you don't care if the Salvation Army is going to actually sell your stuff? Why not just leave it out on the street? I just find it odd, I guess."

They have a big variety and interesting takes on Eggs Benedict and they also have a very good sausage biscuits and gravy dish."

astoria,3afmcu,MadnessofKingHippo,3,Fri Jun 19 19:08:57 2015 UTC,It's quite frankly amazing to me that no one has gone to housing court over this yet.
astoria,3afmcu,soymilkisgood,2,Fri Jun 19 20:01:19 2015 UTC,"I think the issue with that is a lot of people who live here simply can't afford to seek legal representation or don't even know that they can do so.  Going to court requires time and money that most people can't take off/afford.  That's why it is important to get the media and local pols on this case, as they can put pressure on the management company that the residents are unable to do so on their own."
astoria,3afmcu,soymilkisgood,3,Fri Jun 19 20:03:26 2015 UTC,"I get the expense and time of going to housing court, but it's much, much more likely to get a positive result than a protest in most instances. Money damages for the tenants being one of the likely outcomes. I also don't think a campaign of writing the local politicians or news media would take any less time than filing a complaint in housing court. Have you been paying full rent every month as well despite these issues?"
astoria,3afmcu,soymilkisgood,1 point,Fri Jun 19 20:14:10 2015 UTC,"no, we haven't been paying our maintenance bills since this occurred, and I don't plan on it either.  When the gas/heat comes back, I plan on having my attorney work with me on getting the charges either dropped or reduced (I come from a family of Queens attorneys, so for me it's not a problem.  For others without the resources that I have, it is)"
astoria,3afmcu,soymilkisgood,-1,Fri Jun 19 20:21:36 2015 UTC,"Why would you get the judgment reduced? I don't understand. Also, for the other residents of the building there's always Legal Aid. There's no reason to have to live in apartment without basic necessities - there's always something that can be done and people out there that are able to help."
astoria,3afmcu,annihilus813,1 point,Fri Jun 19 20:40:13 2015 UTC,"Again - many people don't know of the existence of legal aid or how to contact them.  You and I know this but we are educated and aware of it.  Never underestimate how little information most people have for legal help other than a public defender if they are arrested, as well as the fact that for a lot of people they can't take the time off work or else they get fired."
astoria,3afmcu,JohnnyCashFan69,-1,Fri Jun 19 21:25:23 2015 UTC,"I don't think you're giving people enough credit. There are tons of people that know about Legal Aid and that utilize its services. If people didn't know about Legal Aid they wouldn't have the ridiculous demand for their services that they are always inundated with. They also meet with people on weekends all the time, so that shouldn't be a limiting factor.   Also, you never answered my first question - why in the world, after all this management company has put you through, would you want to reduce or drop any judgment you get against the management company?"
astoria,3afmcu,friendlyfire,1 point,Fri Jun 19 21:52:31 2015 UTC,"Also, you're right - there is such high demand of their services so naturally that would mean a lot of people know about and want to use them, but as I've seen there's a big lack of knowledge about them or also, and as I said my family is queens based attorneys, criminal and private practice so. I grew up around a lot of legal work, one thing you see a lot is just misinformation or distrust of all public legal work.    People think that because their public defender they were given for a DUI, for example, didn't help them out then they conclude that would mean they shouldn't go to the legal aid society for help if they are getting kicked out their home .  A public lawyer is the same to people regardless of their specific field of practice, unfortunately this case it comes with a negative view attached...and undeservedly so."
astoria,3afmcu,friendlyfire,1 point,Fri Jun 19 22:15:11 2015 UTC,"I meant to reduce or drops my maintence charges, that I haven't paid the past two months of due to no service."
astoria,3afmcu,JohnnyCashFan69,2,Fri Jun 19 22:08:26 2015 UTC,"You can start a tenant's association, and pool your resources. One attorney representing 20 of you should be more affordable.   Also, housing court has something called an HP Action that is very tenant friendly.   Withholding rent is problematic because you actually have to put the money into a special account. You can't just leave it in your checking account.   At a minimum, you should consult a lawyer to guide your actions so as not to undermine your position later."
astoria,3afmcu,JohnnyCashFan69,2,Sat Jun 20 15:48:20 2015 UTC,"I know there is often a ""Well that place sucks anyway! It's the Acrapolis!"" refrain online - but remember, there are lots of good people who live there (myself am one of them) who are being victimized by horrible management company who has done the absolute bare minimum (if that) to fix this problem.  Nobody, and I mean nobody, deserves to not have gas in their apartment or to live without proper hot water in this time and in this city and for what we pay in rent/maintenance charges they deserve this basic need.  The more people who can come to this rally to support their community the better!"

You do normally have to wait, its crowded as fuck in the middle of the day and the equipment is sub sub par, like breaking apart. I hear Blink is better. I will try Blink this week too. I get  a discount at NYSC, so I might join that in Sept when I am eligible for the discount again."

I gotta commit to a local gym but I hear mixed info on all of them. Blink too I heard has the same issues planet fitness does in terms of crowd. NYSC I heard has old equipment and their lower prices attract a huge crowd. I think I am going to do a free workout pass on them all, go at the worst hours and see how that works."

astoria,3a1ijv,offlein,8,Tue Jun 16 15:02:42 2015 UTC,"Eh? Steinway's been a retail street my entire life, so I don't really get what you're saying. Recently there's been some night life popping up, but it's still largely shopping. With Astoria getting younger and hipper, I think it's a good location for such a place.  Anyway, I wish them the best, too. Over the past 15 years I've seen so many small businesses die out, so I'm very happy to see new ones like this and the bookstore on 31st street."
astoria,3a1ijv,Mikuro,3,Tue Jun 16 16:47:03 2015 UTC,"Physical retail space is a tough fuckin' racket, because you're competing with electronic retailers. I don't see how ANY retail survives except for:   Giant big-box stores that function as loss-leaders Boutiques with completely unique products Groceries that you need immediately and that you benefit from being able to pick out yourself (like produce) Commodities that are relatively cheap and you don't have to plan out purchasing (like toothpaste, dental floss, shampoo, etc.) Specialty equipment wherein you may benefit from speaking with experts employed by the retail store (like B&H or Adorama)   And maybe a few other things. I just mean that the only real benefits of the physical record store is (a) that hope of finding a hidden gem, which is kind of an antiquated emotional byproduct that's been obviated by online retail and (b) recommendations by the staff.. Something which isn't a strong requirement and, anyway, record store staff do not always really have a stereotype of being friendly and welcoming to the guy off the street.  I'm happy to see it too, it just scares the hell out of me because I don't know how it's sustainable.  I don't really know why I specified ""on Steinway"". I guess I just mean I don't believe that NYC can support this type of retail (somewhat niche, and outside of the aforementioned examples) on a sorta-big street like Steinway in an outer borough. There's room for a few in Manhattan. I dunno, maybe Steinway is big enough! I hope so!"
astoria,3a1ijv,offlein,3,Tue Jun 16 17:59:13 2015 UTC,Shipping Vinyl's is expensive and risky (hot UPS truck == bad). A brick and mortar actually has advantages over online when it comes to records.
astoria,3a1ijv,lounger540,3,Sat Jun 20 17:36:33 2015 UTC,"I would certainly categorize Vinyl as ""boutique"". None of the big-box stores are selling records, and online retailers like Amazon don't carry much vinyl (probably due to the fragile nature of the product)  Steinway has enough foot traffic (and an increasingly steady supply of vinyl loving hipsters) that this might work.   Besides, it's probably just a front for mafia money laundering. That's what I usually assume in these circumstances."
astoria,3a1ijv,BJaacmoens,3,Wed Jun 17 13:41:57 2015 UTC,"Except north of Astoria Boulevard, the foot traffic drops off a lot on Steinway. The main advantage of their location is a rent they might be able to live with."

But seriously, by ""boutiques"" I meant boutique stores, not stores that sell boutique items.. I'm making a subtle distinction here. I agree that ""vinyl"" is boutique. However, ""clothing"" is certainly not boutique. A ""boutique"" store, in my mind, is something intimate and unique that sells something that's not necessarily intimate and unique. Hence, clothing boutiques."

They ended up replacing half of the stairs (plus the landing/platform halfway up) and they also brought in MTA's welding unit to weld back some of the support structure. I think the reason it was out of service so long was because once they deem it unsafe they have to shut it down, regardless of when they actually get around to fixing it. Also possible they are just lazy, backlogged, etc.  It's pretty sad it takes so long I agree."

Do I hate or dislike hipsters or any of the changes in Astoria? not at all. We have great restaurants now, quality of life is much improved. High rents mean less undesirables. If any other long time residents want to chime in as to why they'd hate newcomers? If you own a building here, these newcomers are paying your ridiculous rents, so that should not be a factor. If you are enjoying the food and bar scenes, these newcomers brought a lot of that and serve or cook for you possibly."

Now that I'm ready to move into a 2BR I can not afford to stay in Astoria and that's disappointing, but not the end of the world. I can basically buy a place farther east in Queens and be paying less than I would to rent here (buying in Astoria has never been an option - way too expensive!). If you feel the quality of life is worth the high price tag of the living expenses, welcome. I disagree, mainly because when you are paying so much more in rent you can no longer enjoy the things in the neighborhood as often like going to the great restaurants. Change is change and it happens, it's silly to complain about it, but I do wish a lot of the stuff that has cropped up the last five years was quality. I'm not going to name names, but there are a lot of restaurants that I dislike, but are very hip and cool and always packed, even though they aren't very good. It's more about hype than authenticity."

New people that are actually interested in permanently joining and helping the existing tight-knit community? Awesome.  Williamsburg 3.0, with dudes with top knots everywhere, just because they heard about ""Queens"" in Paper Magazine, B&T trash coming in from Westchester to get plastered and drunk drive, and rents on par with Park Slope? Commercial rents so expensive that only fro-yo joints and retail banks can pay them? Who'd want to live there?   How many bro-douche sports bars and generic Brooklyn style pizza (fuck you Milkflower) does it take until there's nothing left here?  The only way Astoria can stay affordable is to build a ton of new, market rate housing stock so that people that are moving here because the Times won't shut the fuck up don't drive the price of existing apartments up, like what's happened in SF and DC. Maybe put them all along 31st, with no parking to try to keep additional cars off the road.  On the plus side, /r/nyc is all about Bay Ridge now, so hopefully the moment in the spotlight comes to an end, and all changes are for the better."

I'm a 30ish professional, rent a 1 BR, spend a lot of my income in Astoria, and won't spend a dime on frozen yogurt or in bars full of dudes with topknots and women with Skrillex hair.

astoria,39l055,Towelbandito,0,Fri Jun 12 20:35:04 2015 UTC,"First of all he just means poor people, dragging race into it is obnoxious. And what is wrong with obscene rent? I'm getting kind of tired of people complaining about being priced out of an area. If you don't own your home, you don't own it. The person who does own it should be allowed to charge whatever rent they want. It's the equivalent of you renting out the second floor of your house and then people complaining you are charging too much. If people are willing to pay, then they should be the ones living there. The market sets the rate. Living somewhere for 20 years shouldn't give you a sense of entitlement. Ownership should. My Indian parents (Surprise! I'm a colored person too! But not the kind you meant I'm sure... ) immigrated with jack shit and managed to buy a house in an affordable suburb in the span of 5 years. What's so different about them versus the people who have lived in Astoria for 20 years? Heck, why is it that the massive Astoria Greek population are never the ones complaining about being priced out? Because they own their houses maybe? Maybe the ""undesirables"" need to figure out what's so different between them and the ""desirables"" and bridge that gap instead of complaining about people not subsidizing their lifestyles.   Tl dr: Stop whining about deserving handouts."
astoria,39l055,aFineGirl,5,Fri Jun 12 20:47:54 2015 UTC,"First, given that you're old enough to be posting on Reddit, your parents moved here when real estate prices were MUCH lower. It's awesome that they bought a house in the suburbs (not in NYC, I note) after 5 years, but that was when houses were much cheaper.   This is also the problem with your Astoria Greek example. Astoria's Greek population moved here mostly in the 60's, 70's, and 80's. Real estate prices were shit in the 70's and 80's in NYC and they were able to buy up large amounts of property for next to nothing. They wouldn't be able to replicate that success today.  Do you know what a $100k salary gets you in modern-day Astoria apartments? Not much. There are a handful of condos available in Astoria you could get and probably not for much longer. If you miss out on those condos, you're SOL. (Not to mention, that price point will shortly disappear entirely from this neighborhood.) If you make $100k and have kids? Forget it, you're living in a rented apartment. You can't afford to buy a place with more than one bedroom. Keep in mind, the median household income in Astoria is $55,844. If you even make $100k a year, you're making more than 78% of your neighbors. (http://www.bestplaces.net/economy/zip-code/new_york/astoria/11103)   Second, NO ONE mentioned handouts. Assuming that people who make less money than you are automatically on the hunt for a handout is weird and offensive.  Some of attitudes in this sub and in the other NYC subs are just really sad. A landlord's ability to increase his own personal wealth is put above everything else. ""Fuck the current tenant, fuck the current community, I can make more money!"" No wonder this city is really starting to feel soulless."

I told my wife to calm down, that high school kids are stupid, that it's not worth having that kid get in trouble and sent through the school-to-prison pipeline. High school kids are dumb though."

astoria,39l055,Ramses_L_Smuckles,1 point,Sun Jun 14 15:53:38 2015 UTC,I honestly believe we should get the media in on this story.  Does anyone have a contact for NY1 or any of the big morning news shows in NYC?  It's been over 2 months now and I have been getting really sick of crappy showers and not being able to cook my own food.
astoria,39l055,zaloni,2,Sun Jun 14 20:13:13 2015 UTC,"I've been here for quite some time. Let me give you some perspective on why hipsters are hated. You'll be surprised because it has nothing to do with beards and vintage vinyl records.     So I had a best friend who lived in Bushwick. Growing up we were close as were our families. Bushwick was predominantly low income minority back in the day so many low income families lived there because they had no choice but it worked and the place had character. You could go there and get live chickens as I did many times with my dad. Anyways we got older went to college lost touch yadda yadda. Years later we meet up and the guy is in a crisis. He is in the middle of very successful military career and his family is now in a situation where they are getting kicked out of Bushwick because the owner wants to do some maintenance to attract white trust fund midwest hipsters with rent that is increased by 300% and his Latino family and most of the low income Latino community can't handle this. So he is thinking he might have to leave his promising career to help his family and he did. He hopes to revisit it one day but I dunno how easy or hard that is.     So when people come here and complain about the hipsters it isn't the beards, thick rimmed glasses, shitty taste in music and ......... organized kick ball games. That stuff is superficial, fun to pick on but yea superficial. It's the gentrification we all hate. The ruining of what makes this place great. Evicting all the people who lived here. Raising rent. Turning this place into something it's not. Honest to God I don't understand you (you being hipsters). Astoria has always been what it was to me and not once did I attempt to change it because of some stupid subculture I am part of but that's what you all are doing. Turning this into yet another soulless Bushwick, Williamsburg, Portland whatever. You have those shitty places go to them and be with your fake friends with no future and lots of student loan debt in pursuit of worthless liberal arts degrees. I don't care. Don't bring that shit here. What is also ironic is that many of these young hipsters from my observation are of the left wing persuasion, usually the overtly PC ones and you can't see the irony in how your gentrification is similar in how the white man came here and killed the native American culture. I bet you called white people evil and cited this but never once thought about how you practice this? Anyway I hope this makes sense as shines some light since part of the OP about negative comments was directed at me clearly."
astoria,39l055,Ramses_L_Smuckles,6,Thu Jun 18 01:31:02 2015 UTC,"Astoria born & bred, over 40 years ago.  At Astoria General.  What you say is oversimplification.  Your viewpoint on the new entrants might be right - I really don't care to analyze.  What's an oversimplification is your nostalgia.  I, too, remember an astoria where everyone hung out on their stoops and there was a real sense of community.  When all kids were ""free range"".  But it was also violent. The Chinky Hill kids not only tormented me, but a whole neighborhood.  There were beatings galore.  It was rough.  The movie is a very accurate depiction of the astoria that was.  There was small time organized crime everywhere (and at least 50% of the ethnic social clubs still are fronts).  Litter was worse than it is even now.  Astoria park had more broken glass than growing grass.  Shore Blvd was death blvd, with IROCs in their IROCs mowing down kids, and it was just accepted.  Greek and Italian home owners did well, bought more properties, and then moved to Bayside, Whitestone (everysinglepersononmyblockfrom70's80'sgoneinthe90s), etc., and kept their properties as rentals, and, in many cases, became total crap with minimal improvements.  All these walk-ups and 2-families, paid off in full 30 years ago, never updated, sucking every bit of rent they could.  Squeezing every little bit of illegal basement rent that they could.  You complain about lack of thought diversity in the new entrants.  You might be right.  But there was a major lack of thought diversity in the past.   There's a very specific reason why All in the Family was set in Astoria.  So yeah, bring it on, maybe we'll be a bit more reasonable on balance."

Most are generic American urban professionals without the affectation), how is the current influx different than the one started in the mid 90s?  It isn't.   Astoria had positive characteristics, attracted people priced out elsewhere, who came, improved, priced out the current group of johnny-come-latelies who thought that +they+ were the authentic Astoria.  Same thing, different day.  Folk in this sub sound like my firefighter friends who moved to LI because of the 'yuppie invasion' in 1995, or because of 'the fags' in 2005.  The only difference is that this group is an easy bunch to pick on because they are so identifiable and pathetically of the zeitgeist."

Most of them love to bandwagon on talking about emerging artists if someone helpfully clues them in, but they don't make anything themselves.  They're a consumer class, buoyed by debt and parental support, and their taste in consumption sucks.   how is the current influx different than the one started in the mid 90s?   It's not, generally, but the tail end of the current influx (topknots and scarves in June) is different.  Their parents subsidize them to a degree that perfectly suits slimy brokers' mission to inflate rents, shitty restaurants' mission to overcharge, and froyo etc. places' ambitions to replace other businesses that were actually interesting and worthwhile.

That's so laughably incorrect I don't know where to start.

astoria,39l055,zaloni,-1,Mon Jun 15 03:46:29 2015 UTC,It's 100% hipsters. This is what they do. Gentrification. They go to old cheap low income minority places in NY and run out the locals and shit all over he established culture. Just like how we did it to the native Americans. This is how I know you are a liar and not a native new yorker since you clearly have never been to Bushwick before and after.

astoria,39l055,JohnnyCashFan69,3,Mon Jun 15 13:49:39 2015 UTC,"Queens is the most diverse place in the world. Until recently, Astoria wasn't  nearly as much. It was largely working class southern Europeans, with little tolerance of others. Wasn't safe to be openly gay or even the wrong race walking down the wrong block.  You must be a relative newbie yourself. ""Quite some time"" is relative."
astoria,39l055,aceshighsays,-1,Mon Jun 15 14:10:45 2015 UTC,OK let's conviniently forget the large Muslim population in Astoria. Yup you are full of shit and probably aren't even from here. Also none of this has anything to do with my point.

Perhaps you can try making your point again, but as it stands it was a ramble.  The muslims in astoria are very different than the greeks or italians of yesteryear (or the Irish or Germans before them), but they have very traditional view points, and aren't inviting of others.  In those ways, exactly like previous immigrant waves.  They're international but not internationalistas, and keep to themselves.  But you know that they are doing???? Buying.  Continuing to buy.  Voting on their faith in the community.  Not getting priced out.    Oh, and not whining on reddit when they could be buying in instead."
astoria,39l055,aceshighsays,0,Sun Jun 14 03:33:59 2015 UTC,wah wah wah   Well it's great to see you are a prick but my point was more than just whining which I wasn't doing and showing how low income minorities get screwed over by white trust fund hipsters. In the real world not everyone has parents that can fund their manchild lifestyle way into their 30's.   All cultures have traditionalist views this isn't unique to Muslims but the point is you acted like they weren't a thing and Astoria was just a European town and you were wrong. This is the problem when you don't know anything about a place and talk out of your behind. Also the Muslims have been nothing but nice to me anytime I visited Steinway so I dunno what you are talking about.   I own property too my friend so don't you worry. However there is more to me in life about money but even if you want to talk property all that is being made is a luxury apartment bubble as more and more complexes are being built in LIC thus diluting the market and eventually we are going to run out of hipsters with rich baby boomer parents who can buy these places and then our investments will go to shit. But honestly I would rather see moderate to no gains if it means Astoria stays as Astoria but that's just me.
astoria,39l055,Wild_Vulture,2,Sun Jun 14 10:31:21 2015 UTC,"I moved out of Astoria 2 months ago, after living there for 4 years, and I don't miss it. I really like my new area - although I think in 4 years it will become like Astoria is now.   I was having issues with the long time residents in my building. They had attitudes and didn't understand that they couldn't blast their radio or TV late at night. They were very inconsiderate. They felt that because they've been living in the building for 30 years, that gave them the authority to behave as if they had no neighbors. I had to call the cops on them. Also the long time residents were very nosy as if it was up to them whether or not I could stay in the building.   Also, I didn't like how crowded the stores were and that Key Food wasn't open 24/7. The bars and restaurants were a nice touch, but when I'm grocery shopping they're a nuisance because they take up sidewalk space.   TLDR: The area really changed a lot in the last 4 years."

This post had no educational value, and was simply meant to get people's attention off of my original post, because I was receiving weird comments/messages and texts.    Maybe I was just too busy to proofread my post because I just came back from traveling and teaching around the world(literally two days before), and my husband was flying in an hour on a business trip. My mother who was getting out of the hospital was coming the next day and the house wasn't clean, and I had to unpack 5 suitcases. You see, some of us have lives and shit to do, more important shit than be a nasty, arrogant FUCK to people who don't consider reddit to be that influential of a medium to deserve proofreading a post of a lost cat.   I put a collar on my cat by the way, and I am now even happier about this because I know I won't have to be ridiculed by dumb fuck-heads over my grammar, when I nearly had a heart attack over my cat being gone for 15 hours.

Now think of you, obviously a spoiled as fuck fool, who decides to make fun of me and wonder why I wouldn't proof-read my writing. Is English the only language in the world? Aren't you forgetting that language has dialects and trends and the internet has brought on so many new words and phrases to it? Or are YOU that uneducated and dubious to the world that keeps  moving around you?  Well, as said earlier, English IS my first language, it is MY FUCKING LANGUAGE, and If I wAnT tO TyPe ThIs way, I fucking will.

This is the problem with you guys you can't see the stereotype in yourselves.   some exercise   No not from this game. Basketball and Soccer will give you that if that is your goal.   remove themselves from the everyday stresses of work and life   More like a bunch of late 20's early 30's man/woman-children who refuse to come to terms with their age. It's quite sad honestly.   astoria Social Kickball will run similar.   You keep going with this argument if I am arguing that no one plays this. Of course they do. There are tons of childish hipsters all over Bushwick, Greenpoint, Williamsburg,Astoria and so on so obviously there is a demand by the bearded ones.

And so is baseball, basketball, and just about every sport that has a professional league.   Low exertion? Have you heard of bowling, darts, poker, and all the other games that most adults engage in on a regular basis?  And I'd love to know how many of the haters are overweight, that would be the hipocritical cherry on top.

Like as if they're some anti-establishment intellectuals who happen to drink beer and critique the notes of every can. I look at them walking around and they make me feel old, depressed and souless, and I'm only like 30. They exude this presence as if they're has-beens.

There are a ton of people walking there - little kids, parents with kids, senior citizens, etc. that these people scare. Nobody should have to feel that way just walking to and from the train - Plus many of them are disgusting and smell.

Perhaps certain people lack basic privileges that others take for granted. If anything, a lot of these people are so not okay, that they've become helpless. Also, people become homeless for various other reasons other then drugs. Maybe they were a victim to physical abuse? Maybe they actually suffer from an undiagnosed mental condition thats become more severe over time? Maybe these people don't have a family or a support system.

It takes you something like 5 paragraphs of random bullshit before you even get close to talking about sushi at all and then the payoff for slogging through all the random bullshit is: I don't remember, it was OK.  Not once in this...exercise do you talk about what the sushi is like.  I'm not going to read it again but I'm pretty sure the only food you mention in this entire thing are some dumplings and you again say virtually nothing about them.  So what was the point here?

My boyfriend and I talked to the and got them down to $500 out of pocket after the supposed Groupon ""deal"". Felt like a huge scam and they even got his script wrong so he had horrible headaches. He went in to get reexamined and Cohen's was sure that it was fine, but LensCrafters immediately identified how the script was wrong.

astoria,379xh9,AV15,1 point,Mon Jun 1 16:31:52 2015 UTC,"you are nitpicking here.  the person didn't like how the chef cut the fish.  it is a valid gripe and one that i agree with.     Just because they didn't rattle off the attributes for making top sushi/sashimi doesn't mean the gripe is not valid and that they don't know what they are talking about.     For example, if i don't like the rice then i am not going to like the sushi.  has zero to do with how the fish is killed, stored or cut.  K?"

astoria,36p5nl,Cyradis,4,Fri May 22 04:51:57 2015 UTC,I live at Acropolis and I'm in one of the buildings that hasn't had gas since the beginning of May. Over the weekend I spotted a 311 permit for repairs because of a gas leak and a stop work order from the buildings commissioner. Would really like to know what's going on but no response from the maintenance team.  My landlord is fine - it's just the maintenance group that they are forced to use. If you live in Acropolis send me a PM - I'm going to the city council for answers and could use all the support I can get.  Also - where are these drug dealers everyone is seeing? I've been out at night and day and have walked around the block and in the courtyard the entire length and I never see anything. Are they dealing in the courtyard or on the street?
astoria,36p5nl,dreddriver,3,Thu May 21 03:48:23 2015 UTC,"In the front of the stacks, near Kyclades. A bunch of dudes from the Bronx come in to fuck with people during the day and sell drugs, one of them is the loudest motherfucker I have ever heard, but I think he lives here.  Also at night on the weekends, a much sketchier crew comes in, but I don't know if they're related."
astoria,36p5nl,j-3p1percub,2,Thu May 21 13:25:11 2015 UTC,"I am a homeowner at the Acropolis. I really like my place, and the price was reasonable for the area. Dealing with the Metropolitan Pacific Properties can definitely be a pain in the ass as they can be a bit unprofessional, but there are some benefits like easy owner approval and limited rental restrictions makes me overlook many issues. I have never had bedbugs, knock on wood. The buildings are made of stone and are quiet, and I love the location. I've never seen any drug dealers or shady characters, but I live near the Ditmars end so maybe the increased foot traffic send them towards the north end of the buildings.  Here's the latest update I got from Steve Ossman (president), Scott Peckelis (finance?), and Mary Baxter (billing?) at MetPac.  I was told that there was a small fire earlier this month that caused ConEd to shut the gas off for 8 buildings. Seems overkill, but apparently ConEd are claiming all sorts of things about crappy plumbing, and the Acropolis is denying most of them. The issues seems to be leaks that developed over time. The buildings were built in 1926 I think, so these things happen. After the last building explosion in Manhattan, ConEd is cracking down when they see issues.  They expect the gas to be shut off for another week or two depending on the building, and they have a mediator hired to try and help the process along. The gas line pressure tests are ongoing, and another building was completed yesterday. Buildings are on a specific schedule, but no specific timeline for completion is available right now. Once each pressure test is passed, gas will be restored to that building immediately.  You can contact MetPac at 718-626-4400 and get on an email list for updates. There are 700 tenants there, and many are without gas so I'm sure MetPac are feeling some pressure.  Hot water has been restored to all buildings via plumbing from an adjacent building. This has been the case since early May. Unfortunately you may have to let the water run for a bit before the hot water will flow, and schedule showers and such during off-peak times.   I don't blame MetPac for these issues. The buildings are old, and I honestly feel like they are working hard to get things fixed. On the other hand, if MetPac would keep the property up a bit better in general, I think this situation would play out a lot better for them. They've made their own bed, and must make strides to win back the trust of the tenants. To their credit, they take my calls and are very open with information."
astoria,36p5nl,dreddriver,4,Thu May 21 11:18:31 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I do blame MetPac. They keep changing their story - it's because of the fire / it's a routine gas inspection / ConEd is being paranoid / they found something during inspection. Well which is it??  Also, our doorbell system hasn't worked for 2 years!!!! We've called and called and they never show up to fix our leaky pipes or the door system.   And when I called ConEd they had a different story all together. Also, if what MetPac is doing is legit then why is there a stop work order and reference to a gas leak that MetPac has NEVER mentioned in one of their updates?"
astoria,36p5nl,j-3p1percub,1 point,Thu May 21 12:30:25 2015 UTC,"The buildings are nearly 100 years old. Pipes develop leaks over time. What we don't know if this is due to lack of regular maintenance on MetPac part, ConEd's error, or just old age. That's going to be hard to understand. What we do know is every reason you mentioned is correct, but they are intertwined and you have to look at the entire problem to understand it.  The fire caused the gas to be shut off. ConEd then did a routine inspection and found leaks. ConEd is more paranoid due to the latest explosion and is cracking down where they see issues. This is a pretty logical set of circumstances that I was able to have corroborated by all the contact calls I made.   Cooking gas is not a protected utility in NYC, so there's not much that can be done outside notifying the media. The hot water is much more of an issue, but it seems most people have hot (enough) water when necessary.   No laws have been broken that we can ascertain at the moment. Maybe this makes you hate MetPac even more. Fine. You can move when your lease is up. Maybe you can use this as leverage to break your lease early. Try to withhold rent. Either way, what are you actually thinking can be done about this, and what about the situation is directly the fault of MetPac?  I wish there was a tenant group that met monthly to discuss these issues. If we organized and held MetPac accountable we can make change. Would you like to organize such a thing?"
astoria,36p5nl,dreddriver,5,Thu May 21 12:46:09 2015 UTC,"Call ConEd and ask for their story - that's what I did. It doesn't match up with MetPac. And it can be a combination of those things - but that's not what the flyers were saying at the beginning of the month and that' is not what ConEd is saying. Im super suspicious that everything they do is ConEd's fault: ConEd ""lost their permits from two years ago"", ConEd is ""being paranoid"" blah blah blah. And let's not forget the stop work order that was addressed to them.  Also, what about the doorbells? What about my leaky pipes? Twice I've taken off work for them to fix and they never show. Just last month I got woken up at 4am by police banging on the security door downstairs because they had a 911 call and no one could let them in.   That right there is what can make them liable in an emergency. But they don't care.   Go ahead and believe the people who change their story, never show up on time, fail to fix basic problems etc.   What do I want done? I want another maintenance company or at least my door fixed, doorbell fixed, leaky pipes fixed and my shower plumbing fixed. And if they have time in their busy schedule maybe if they could fucking fix my gas that would great."

The front entry gates all being broken for years now, the video intercom system often being broken for specific buildings/people, the laundry rooms, the dying trees that were replaced with more dying trees, etc.  The hard part is that their easygoing nature in approving new buyers is attractive, especially if you want to buy a unit as a rental investment, but I think it causes a definite hit to the value of the apartments. I'd love to see it go more owner occupied, and management to be more responsive, but I'm not holding my breath."

It really does come down so much to the management company and their lack of services quickly, on schedule or done without a back-and-forth hassle.    The buildings are all really old, no one is expecting them to be in the same shape as some luxury complex built 4 years ago.

The apartment itself is fine, and the location and price are killer, but the management have been terrible for us too.  For starters, the maintenance people stopped doing maintenance about 18 months after we moved in. We used to be able to call them to get help snaking our drains and similar small maintenance tasks, but now they tell us that they won't help us because we're renters.  Fortunately we haven't seen any drug dealers in the courtyard (some drug users, but nothing too crazy), and no bed bugs or any other bug infestations... but the situation is still a little ridiculous. The management needs to get it together."
astoria,36p5nl,MadnessofKingHippo,2,Thu May 21 21:29:59 2015 UTC,"but now they tell us that they won't help us because we're renters.   Funny, they give me the same runaround because we're owners...  I have no issues with my apartment (other than some basic plumbing issues, which are pretty easily fixed) or my building in general, but the management company really is shit.    What I'm hoping to happen is that in within the next few years, as Astoria continues to grow and grow as a destination to live in, that some other management company or developer will want to purchase the property and clean it up..at the very least, my home price has already gone up since purchased it just by location and ""hipness"" of Astoria alone."

I'm curious about how it's run - maybe any of you who live there can explain. Isn't it technically a co-op? So shouldn't it have a board? MetPac's services are paid for by maintenance fees, so a co-op board should have the power to raise maintenance if people are unhappy, in order to cover the cost of better services - even hiring a different company. Or does MetPac actually own a substantial number of the apartments there?"
astoria,36p5nl,dreddriver,3,Thu May 21 14:32:16 2015 UTC,"The first few buildings coming from ditmars appear to be mostly apartments that are lived in with the owners. The apartments further down are owned by various people and rented out. The unifying factor is the use of MetPac - I assume they have some monopoly because their office is located in Acropolis.

People bought them with their own money anyways, so either way people do have the burners in their apartments.  The drug dealing is another problem I have because the lack of authority is disgusting. Welcome to the Acropolis, where people can openly smoke marijuana in the middle of the day without any repercussions. The apartment complex doesn't reflect the neighborhood at all and I think it should. We live in such a nice neighborhood, but living in this complex makes you feel otherwise."

Haven't heard anything in a few days. 21-48 had pressure tests last week I believe and 21-47 had them this week.   They said it was essential for gas to be turned on but there hasn't been any follow up with the tenants who weren't home. No explanation given by Pacific management either - just that ConEd was lying when they said that ""during an inspection unapproved work was found"". Their response was that they just lost the permits that they had filed when they did the original gas work 2 years ago.  This is coming from the company that has repeatably not shown up when you take off work to let them in so they can fix something. They've also let the doorbells and buzzers stay broken - even after there was a police emergency at 21-47 and the police couldn't get up to the apartment.

I would love to make it so again.    Clean up this pollution. Queens is apparently one of the worst cities in America in pollution. Next to Brooklyn lol.    Idk what we have to do. Be harsher on Con Ed and the power plants nearby? Personally clean it? Fix the ecosystem in the water?   Heard Oysters use to clean up the water there. We over-caught them like everything else we do. Lets look to bring them back, and look into other creatures which can naturally clean it.    Listen. Most of NYC is a dirt. Its a very popular city but doesnt mean we cant clean it.   Its ridiculous. There are garbage bags filled all the time. we have to make people more aware of how to properly manage this, and use our tax money to hire more garbagemen.   Also, there are times were I go blocks on end until I come across a trash can. Depending where you are. Why? Spend a little on trash cans... Pay for more jobs.   Do a better job in cleaning our plants.   And whats with the street cleaners? What a horrendous invention.   Not picky but tired of living in filth."

I'd be willing to join on a sideline cleanup and bring some garbage bags. It's funny though..when I did it with NY Cares we'd have people coming up to us asking if we were volunteering then bitching about how dirty the park was..and then mysteriously having to leave once we encouraged them to join in or take a bag with them. Haha.

I recently got an oil change at the 21st St. Wash and Lube, and it came with a free Superwash, the $20 option. They cleaned the interior as well as the exterior, and they used some sort of wax that left my car looking brand new for like a week. I'm not even joking, I had people complimenting me on how shiny my car was. it was like an extra seven dollars than the base price, totally worth it.  EDIT - Why is this thread getting downvoted?

I've used Crescent for a long time, though and it's mostly so backed up with traffic that it's not terrifically bike-unfriendly like, say, parts of 2nd Ave."
astoria,3522p3,Captaintripps,1 point,Fri May 8 14:03:28 2015 UTC,Depends on how comfortable you are riding along with traffic. The road is pretty wide and people seem to be courteous to bikers.
astoria,3522p3,nimbusnacho,1 point,Mon May 11 14:55:02 2015 UTC,I second this. Crescent puts you out right at the entrance to the bridge and is fairly spacious most of the time.

Down astoria blvd 1 block to 30th st.  Continue for a while and eventually drop down to 28th st.  I normally do it at 34th ave. Continue on 28th st until you hit the bridge entrance.  you'll find that it is fine.  It only feels awkward because 31st st & Astoria blvd is such a mess of an intersection.  Better to deal with that kind of intersection at the start rather than mid-ride.  See you out there."
astoria,3522p3,zaloni,2,Wed May 6 17:02:59 2015 UTC,I've been doing this everyday for about a year now.  I take 36th st down to 34th ave and then down 29th st to the bridge.  The bike lanes are pretty good in here.  Just don't ride to close to the parked cars.  There are a lot of idiots out there who don't look before opening a door on the bike lane.  Where are you heading once you get into the Manhattan?  If your heading downtown 2nd Ave is the best option.  It's a bit crazy between the bridge until after you pass the tunnel.  Don't be afraid to ride down the center of the shared bike lane.  You are entitled to the whole lane.  I find if you try to stay left that's when cars try to squeeze in next to you and it gets dangerous.  Once you hit 34th st it's pretty safe with the protected bike lane.  Good luck and safe riding.
astoria,3522p3,SkyNet2k,2,Thu May 7 22:42:12 2015 UTC,"Usually I'm headed to 54th and Lex, although sometimes I'm headed downtown. Depends.

If you need to be somewhere in downtown Manhattan, and you don't mind the extra distance, often going south through LIC into Brooklyn to one of the three Bklyn east river bridges is a more pleasant ride than shooting down 2nd ave off the 59th st bridge."

astoria,3480cb,vc_,13,Wed Apr 29 00:59:14 2015 UTC,It depends on a lot of factors. Do you want a prewar building or a new luxury building ? Do you want to be close to the train or that doesn't matter? Do you want to be near shops and restaurants ? An average 1 bedroom is probably around 1700 and an average 2 bedroom is around 2200-2300
astoria,3480cb,mr34mj23,2,Wed Apr 29 01:11:57 2015 UTC,"agreed. you can probably find cheaper, but you'll be further from the train and in a place that's not as nice. those prices are, unfortunately, pretty average.  walk neighborhoods. check craigslist often. avoid brokers--you pay for what you can get for free. its tough, but do-able to find one on your own.  EDIT: downvotes? really?"

astoria,3480cb,link3988,8,Wed Apr 29 14:28:37 2015 UTC,its a terrible system. i freaking hate it. NYC is the only place i've been like this. brokers dug their greedy claws in and most of them suck. WHY should we pay someone a month's rent just to show us the interior of a building? absurd.
astoria,3480cb,TheyCallMeJDR,17,Wed Apr 29 18:36:40 2015 UTC,Why are you sure you're moving to Astoria if you don't even know how much it costs?

astoria,3480cb,TheBestPlaceEver,2,Mon May 4 15:04:09 2015 UTC,"I thought Astoria has historically been one of the safest neighborhoods in the city, for basically forever? There's only a few housing projects, but they're nowhere near the core, and Greeks aren't exactly known as a violent people."
astoria,3480cb,mindfeck,0,Mon May 4 15:08:22 2015 UTC,"There were a few times I can recall where Astoria wasn't so safe.  When i was a kid Queensbridge, Astoria, and Ravenswood weren't places you wanted to be, and the highschools in the area drew a lot of those kids from the houses so its not like you were able to avoid them, ditmars had a larger homeless population than it does now, bum fights were pretty frequent.  There was a small heroin problem, gang problem.  There was a rapist on the loose a few years ago.  Into the 2000s it started to change a lot after 911 as more Manhattanites moved in because they were scared of being the next sky scraper to be targeted.  Same thing happened with Greenpoint.  And williamsburg.  All these places have easy and quick access to the city."
astoria,3480cb,thecapitalofbulgaria,2,Mon May 4 15:30:51 2015 UTC,"I am currently in LIC, Sept last year my bf got a job here and we did not have enough time to look for a place we liked. We aren´t in the nice lic part but in the industrial side, laundry is quite far as well as subway station which is a pain in winter time.  So we are looking into either staying here or move to Astoria since most of our friends are there and we spend most weekends over there anyway. We are at 1400 a month and was just wondering of the difference in between the 2.  Of course we have asked our friends but wanted to hear r/astoria and its experiences.  Thanks for you help and info everyone!"

The new buildings near the subway start at about $2,000 for a 1br. If you want to be near the subway and laundry, there are 2br places near Steinway from Astoria Blvd. to Broadway area starting around 1,800, rent stabilized. I'm paying 1850 for a 2.5 bedroom railroad apt, but leaving for a nice place in LIC."

Just under 1mi, about 10m, to Astoria Blvd. Just over 1mi, about 15m, to the Key Foods at the Ditmars stop. It's annoying, but I'd rather pay in minutes spent walking than in $$.

But my friends in 2-3br places elsewhere are still paying under $1500 each. I'm convinced, all you need is to live north of / away from the fashionable parts of town."
astoria,3480cb,knitasheep,2,Wed Apr 29 15:29:00 2015 UTC,I think part of the confusion people are having might be the two year time difference. It's depressing how much rent has gone up just in the past two years.

astoria,3480cb,HaikuWVU,3,Wed Apr 29 02:28:48 2015 UTC,I pay 2200 for a 2 bed with a huge brand new kitchen and a dining room. Its in a house by the astoria blvd stop and i love it over here. Its not ideal to have to use a broker but i found that All the nicest places are rented though brokers. you could potentially get lucky without but i tried that and failed.  It sucks to pay their commission but i think it is a necessary evil in NY real estate. Good luck.
astoria,3480cb,hadtohappen,1 point,Wed Apr 29 18:51:58 2015 UTC,Also Astoria brokers are much more realistic than Manhattan ones I've found. Manhattan brokers asked me for 7% of total year's rent which is absurdly higher than the one months' rent my broker asked.
astoria,3480cb,TimeAfterTimeHoodie,2,Thu Apr 30 16:32:22 2015 UTC,"Wait, isn't 7% of the total year's rent actually less than one month's rent (8.3%)? But I digress. I've found that especially in a place like Astoria with a lot of two/three family homes, landlords like to work exclusively with certain trusted brokers, so you can get in to see much nicer properties with the broker and end up paying less over the long term. In the Ditmars area I can highly recommend Metropolis Realty and Halvatzis realty; further south go see Peter Horowitz - good people all around. (This is coming from a long-time Astoria renter and subsequent homeowner.)  One more tip: at least in the Ditmars area where I am, some of the large rent-stabilized buildings do not list on Craigslist and do not list with brokers. The super is the gatekeeper to all rentals, and there are some wonderful bargains to be had (friends of mine have a great pet-friendly, elevator 2br for $1700). Don't be shy about staking out a building and ringing the super's bell to find out if there's availability!"
astoria,3480cb,GingAuf,0,Fri May 1 01:16:55 2015 UTC,"I don't math. The deposit ended up being around 4800 or something, not sure what percentage that is of 30somethingK. And yeah, our landlord worked exclusively with one broker because our neighbor, who deals with the prospective renters (landlord doesn't live in the area) is Greek and prefers one Greek realty, Venus Realty. They have weirdly bad reviews on Yelp but they treated me like family and I felt very confident in them. I never knew that last tip! That's pretty cool! Super sneaky!"

Edit: Quick google search found this:    It varies. Bar owners and managers report numbers around that. A bar manager in Wilmington, Delaware, says his place was quoted $5,000 for a 257-seat occupancy (about $20 a head). Cardrooms in California have been quoted as high as $50 a head.

Anyway,  asked him what the asking rent was for the empty space next Taverna Kyclades on Ditmars. He says it's  $25k a month. It's been empty for two years. Now you know why.  We also talked about the old CVS on 31st and discussed why it stayed open for so long after the new one opened right across the street. Turns out there was a logical reason: CVS didn't want to abandon the space to a competitor like Duane Reade. I guess CVS has made an agreement with the landlord told not lease it to a competitor. The space is now for rent... $75k/mo. (The new CVS on the corner pays $125k/mo.)  And that's the news from my barber."

It's just funny that I read your comment today. I'd like to think he just happened to be there when the girl got hurt (she could've fainted or something). Just wondering if anyone else was there/saw what happened."

Someone else mentioned Pop Bar, which would also work. That spot, back when it was Hellgate Social, was the post-astoria-kickball hangout. Not sure if they're still going there after their kickball games now, though. Mosaic is also a good meetup location, as it's not particularly loud. Might be tough of weekends, though. There's also the r/astoria facebook group if you want to advertise there, though you might get more people than you want if you do that. Last time we did an event through the facebook group we got like 50 people, I think."

It's just a hassle to deal with, and often equipment would be broken.

astoria,33axna,pluvia,1 point,Tue Apr 21 02:29:03 2015 UTC,I'm inclined to try them. But by comfort I am more concerned with no worrying about feeling like the only non body builder in a body builder's gym- ya know?

astoria,33axna,MediumRainbow69,2,Tue Apr 21 02:44:20 2015 UTC,I go to club fitness and I am a powerlifter. They have done very well by putting all that equipment in the basement so all the heavy lifting goes on down there. The price is most definitely worth it and I don't think you will feel out of place.

And no - the management does not give a single shit."
astoria,33axna,Ghanima_Atredis,8,Tue Apr 21 15:11:59 2015 UTC,New York sports club is huge but can get kinda crowded  Planet fitness is 10 dollars a month but ... Planet fitness   Club fitness is fancy but expensive down by bway stop   Rock fitness is also expensive but nice near Astoria blvd.   Astoria sports complex is cheap but kinda run down. Near Steinway stop on r.   Life fitness is around the corner from Astoria sports complex but it seemed great and reasonably priced.   Blink is super cheap but super crowded. Very similar to planet fitness   Syngery is not very convenient to public transportation and seemed a lil run down.
astoria,33axna,snowtreds,2,Tue Apr 21 02:24:24 2015 UTC,Havent been there in 2 months but they did a recent renovation of Astoria Sports complex. Built a new studio on the ground floor for classes and got rid of the one upstairs.

astoria,33axna,DrKillFactory,2,Tue Apr 21 03:39:45 2015 UTC,"I would highly recommend picking a gym that has AS MANY as the qualities you want and is close to you so you go more.   I will say Planet Fitness is an excellent Starter gym. Its kind of like gym class where you have people that don't ever do anything athletic, people that don't want to do anything athletic and then people the are more athletic. So you might feel pretty good about yourself there if you haven't play sports or gone to the gym in a while."

Everyone I dealt with was nice, but the whole place was very disorganized, nobody would tell me any updates on my condition or when I'd be out (I was being read outdated stats regularly and they were surprised when I knew they were old).   What annoyed me the most was a hospital administrator coming to ""see how I was feeling"" and not so subtly telling me that I was going to get a survey in the mail after I went home and that I absolutely had to give them the highest rating for everything because they'd lose funding otherwise. I was tethered to an IV and couldn't leave, and I'm still too Midwestern to have told her to fuck off, so it was an uncomfortable 10 minutes both times she came by. Ugh.  That said, one of the two doctors that was keeping up with me was phenomenal and kept me updated, told me it was ridiculous that I had to stay as long as I did, and helped set a bar to let me get home sooner when I promised to follow through on aftercare.  tl;dr it's kind of a shitshow"

Even though they have the same generic menu, everything I've tried there is just so much better tasting. My guess is that because they are Halal, they have a radically different ingredient sourcing strategy that really makes a big difference in quality.   Even though most of their menu is Americanized, their Singapore Noodles is pretty authentic and awesome. Better than any Singapore Noodles I have had in Flushing or Sunset Park."

At the end of the day, Astoria is pretty bad in terms of good Chinese food."
astoria,32wyr1,otisthorpesrevenge,1 point,Fri Apr 17 15:54:43 2015 UTC,"Have you given Fatima's a shot though? I have this weird hobby of trying out different Chinese take-outs and this place definitely stands out. To clarify, I'm speaking strictly about Americanized Chinese food which I consider to be its own style of cuisine. Not really worth comparing it authentic stuff."
astoria,32wyr1,HeyItsMau,1 point,Fri Apr 17 16:02:38 2015 UTC,I have not tried Fatima's - I will though now. I'll try their Singapore noodles first.
astoria,32wyr1,otisthorpesrevenge,1 point,Fri Apr 17 16:25:11 2015 UTC,"Thanks for recommending Xing's Chef and also the reminder about Fatima's; I need to check them both out. By far the best American style Chines food is Shaw Shack, but it's out in JH - still worth the trip. Best General Tso's EVER. How is the GT at Xing's or Fatima's?"
astoria,32wyr1,DynamicElephant,1 point,Fri Apr 17 21:27:47 2015 UTC,"I tried Fatima's yesterday. 2 people - one order of singapore noodles, one order szechuan chicken. Both were very good: I picked up the order but saw inside is very clean."
astoria,32wyr1,otisthorpesrevenge,2,Wed Apr 29 17:10:30 2015 UTC,totally agree with you about Fatima's Halal.  Best in the area by far.   they deliver to a very wide area too.  I am near 23rd ave and they deliver to me from Broadway.
astoria,32wyr1,KingNeptuna,1 point,Fri Apr 17 20:28:58 2015 UTC,Fatima's is good but I really need pork in my fried rice.
astoria,32wyr1,FairwayBand,6,Thu Apr 23 14:00:31 2015 UTC,"What's the deal with that residential apartment/condo (?) construction on 20th Ave & Steinway? It's a big project, but it seems like a strange location because it's kind of far from the subway and kind of in an industrial area. And also it smells like the sewage plant when the wind blows the right way."
astoria,32wyr1,otisthorpesrevenge,3,Fri Apr 17 13:30:30 2015 UTC,Was wondering that too. Maybe assisted living home? Or if it has a big parking garage then maybe it's aimed towards car commuters. That area isn't completely barren - there's a strip mall right by it and living close to Single-Cut would be awesome.
astoria,32wyr1,HeyItsMau,1 point,Fri Apr 17 14:04:13 2015 UTC,Yeah I feel like I've seen zero progress on this building. I use to jog past there all the time and I never once saw anyone working.

astoria,32wyr1,GoopyEyes,6,Mon Apr 27 18:00:46 2015 UTC,"There seem to be a number of businesses which have closed their doors along 31st St and Ditmars area (the Froyo place, the old CVS, that Havana Cafe between Ditmars and 21st Ave that has been for sell for over a year). Anybody know what might be replacing these stores? I could really use a good Indian restaurant, personally..."
astoria,32wyr1,bootthecat,2,Fri Apr 17 15:16:29 2015 UTC,"CVS made sense, since I assume they were just riding that lease out after opening up the other one. The Froyo place was never destined to last either, I mean they entered that dying market years after it had already been oversaturated.   What concerns/annoys me is that there's a perpetually high # of vacant stores in the Ditmars area. I'd love to hear from someone knowledgable about the commercial real estate market about why that might be. It seems like landlords are trying to get more money than the spaces are worth. It's annoying too that Ditmars is always late to the game with basic trends that pop up in Manhattan or the rest of Astoria years before something similar ends up on Ditmars/23Ave. Worse, the fact that Watawa has done well for itself is great, but how many damn sushi places do we need?"
astoria,32wyr1,calc32004,1 point,Mon Apr 20 16:58:08 2015 UTC,"Sorry for the late reply. I've spoken to a few business owners and their landlords target chain stores (GameStop, Payless Shoes,etc.). They sign long term leases and have the luxury of being able to operate at a loss for a few years."
