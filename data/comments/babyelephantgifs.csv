babyelephantgifs,3csr2k,petitepecas,31,Fri Jul 10 14:14:52 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure that I have a story that is very moving but I think a very moving elephant behavior is reassurance behavior. Elephants, when they are in distressing situations, will physically comfort one another by moving close and touching. It can be similar to the way humans comfort each other by hugging or patting a sad friend on the back.  There was an elephant I worked with who had been hit by a car. Her health was fine but she still harbored a fear of vehicles. Anytime one would drive by she would get anxious. Her friend would always walk over and start touching her, normally with some gentle trunk touches to the face. It was pretty amazing."
babyelephantgifs,3csr2k,ileikboopy,10,Fri Jul 10 18:28:43 2015 UTC,That's amazing.  The emotional intelligence of elephants will never cease to amaze me.  I hope your work can help stave off the extinction of these wonderful animals!

babyelephantgifs,3csr2k,petitepecas,16,Fri Jul 10 18:50:43 2015 UTC,"I've seen this book advertised on Facebook with the DSWF's endorsement. Thanks!  I have a perhaps specific question for both of you: how are elephants perceived / valued by children in different contexts? I'd imagine for the majority of Americans, the elephant is a novelty to a child- a wonderous creature of exotica and even fantasy. But what about in Thailand, or Asian countries, or African countries, where elephants are much more part of life? Do children value the, differently and talk about them differently?  Thanks again, I look forward to gifting this book to my friends' and family's children."
babyelephantgifs,3csr2k,Bigbysjackingfist,19,Fri Jul 10 14:15:46 2015 UTC,"This is a great question, and hopefully Elise can chime in about how elephants are perceived by children in Thailand as my focus was primarily on American culture.    I'd imagine for the majority of Americans, the elephant is a novelty to a child- a wonderous creature of exotica and even fantasy.   For the age groups I looked at this seemed to be the case. The kids answered the questions of ecology sort of all over the place. They said that elephants live in kitchens, zoos, backyards (ahem), and ate pizza, ice cream, peanuts. Of the 140 kids that were in the study, only a handful listed vegetation or that they lived in Africa/Asia. BUT, their stories gave agency to the elephant characters. I found that their literacy was extremely low but their perceptions of elephants as agents was extremely high. This was inverted from how they treated squirrels and geese (literacy extremely high, perceptions as agents extremely low)."
babyelephantgifs,3csr2k,RuskiesInTheWarRoom,15,Fri Jul 10 14:35:44 2015 UTC,"Wow, I love this question! I will preface my response by saying it is based just on personal experience and anecdote, not on wider research so I am not sure if my comments would apply to other places. In Thailand, the elephant is a national symbol that is widely recognized and valued. Elephants are also an incredibly dangerous animal in the wild, a fact that I believe is not considered often by American elephant lovers. To most Americans, the idea of living next to a forest or jungle that hosts a population of wild elephants sounds like a dream come true, but the reality is living in close proximity with elephants is dangerous. This leads to a conservation problem we call human-elephant conflict. A lot of the Thai children I met did like elephants and enjoyed learning about them but I think those that have their daily life impacted by their presence might have very complicated feelings.   I hope this addresses your question and please feel free to ask more about the human/elephant situation in Thailand. It is very interesting and I would love to talk more about it."
babyelephantgifs,3csr2k,scrawledfilefish,7,Fri Jul 10 15:09:11 2015 UTC,"Elephants are also an incredibly dangerous animal in the wild, a fact that I believe is not considered often by American elephant lovers.   This is a great point.  I watch the elephants at the San Diego Zoo Safari park daily, and it's pretty incredible how much they eat and how fast they can devour a pile of tree limbs.  Not to mention how big and strong they are.  I can't imagine the damage that a wild herd could cause to a farm.  It's easy in the west to take a ""leave the elephants alone!"" approach, but the reality seems to be much more nuanced.  The efforts in Africa to help create elephant barriers using honeybee hives are pretty interesting."

babyelephantgifs,3csr2k,damerose,12,Fri Jul 10 16:23:42 2015 UTC,"Hi there!  I'm planning a trip to Southeast Asia soon, and wanted to see if I could interact with some elephants while I'm in Thailand. However, I heard a lot of typical places where tourists can ride and feed elephants treat their animals really poorly. Do you have any recommendations for places where I can see elephants who are humanely cared for?  And since this is /r/babyelephantgifs, what's the cutest interaction you had with a baby elephant?"
babyelephantgifs,3csr2k,vanker,8,Fri Jul 10 15:15:24 2015 UTC,"Hello! I am very excited to hear that you are headed to SE Asia. I love Thailand, it is a beautiful country and I'm sure you will have a wonderful experience. I recently answered a question above about my feelings about how we interact physically with elephants that you may find interesting.   My personal recommendation for seeing elephants in Thailand would be to go to one of the beautiful national parks, hire a guide, and see them in the wild. I had the opportunity to see elephants in the wild for the first time in Kaeng Krachan National Park. We were there with a local guide and he had been driving us around the park all day looking for elephants. We had a wonderful experience but were disappointed that it seemed we might not get the opportunity to see any. As we were headed back to our lodging, the guide pulled over at a watch tower and shouted up to a friend asking if he could see any. We got the nod and climbed up thirty feet into a small watch tower. As I got to the top and looked over the tree line I saw a herd of about 20 wild elephants (some were babies) playing in a small pond. I am not one who is emotionally moved easily but in that moment I had tears in my eyes.  That being said, if you would like to interact with elephants physically in captivity there are hundreds of places in Thailand where you can touch, feed, ride, and bathe elephants. It is hard to find reliable information online about the quality of the establishment but at the end of the day those elephants do need to make a living to support themselves and their owner.   I hope this was helpful!"

It is hard for me to think of a specific moment but the funniest elephant that I worked with was the baby. He was born about a year after I arrived in Thailand so I had the opportunity to watch him grow up a bit. Seeing him learn to use his trunk was amazing, and required a lot of trial and error. I spent a solid hour one day watching him repeatedly hit himself in the face with his trunk. I am not sure what he learned during that process but it was hilariously cute.   Thanks for the question!"
babyelephantgifs,3csr2k,Walkinix,12,Fri Jul 10 14:46:54 2015 UTC,Can you describe your research a bit more? What did you study? (Both)
babyelephantgifs,3csr2k,Walkinix,16,Fri Jul 10 14:13:01 2015 UTC,"I'll let Elise describe her work in Thailand.  For me, I had 140 children write stories that had to include at least one person and one elephant (or bear or squirrel or goose), and then asked them questions about where they thought elephants lived and what they thought elephants ate.   The intention was to investigate how children of various ages (K, 2nd ,4th grade) understand certain mediated and unmediated animals in culture.  I'm currently working with my advisor on co-authoring a paper about it. The results were pretty interesting!"
babyelephantgifs,3csr2k,hannahnatasha,10,Fri Jul 10 14:22:10 2015 UTC,"Hi, thank you for doing this AMA! I have a question in regards to soon-to-be Dr. Derry's research:  In your research, did you find that one group of kids was noticeably more cognisant about elephant lifestyle than others? Were older kids more realistic in how elephants can't make a diet out of only peanuts?"
babyelephantgifs,3csr2k,petitepecas,7,Fri Jul 10 15:37:04 2015 UTC,"Great question. There were a few noticeable differences.   Here's a chart from my master's work * that might help elucidate the differences a bit. To explain the percentage, I coded foods as ""natural"" (things the animal eats in the wild) or ""cultural"" (things the animal does not eat in the wild). You'll notice that 50% of the second grade group listed natural foods for elephants, whereas roughly 25% of the kindergarten group listed natural foods. This trend is the similar for all four animals tested, except the bear (strangely enough).   What was strange to me, however, was that fourth graders had answers that were even more ""cultural"" than the second graders, so while it seemed that literacy improved between kindergarten and second grade, it worsened between second and fourth.  This actually was one of the inspirations for writing this book (and eventually founding Oakenday Press) - to try to help improve ecological literacy at this age group (3rd grade) through playful and accessible stories.  * I feel like I should note that it's not the best graph - Made it back in my master's program. One of my tasks for publication include switching to bar instead of line, including p-values, etc."
babyelephantgifs,3csr2k,hannahnatasha,4,Fri Jul 10 17:29:55 2015 UTC,"Interesting. Coming at it from a different angle, one explanation could be the role of an animal playing a part in the socialization of young children. In the case of the bear, it's become popular animal in the parenting culture since the early 20th century, (e.g. the creation of the ""Teddy Bear"" and the publishing of The Bernstein Bears in the 1940's,) and so it would be believable that children believe that the bear is naturally socialized like them because of these interactions. I don't know if you did or didn't take note of this, (might have not fit into your particular thesis) but I'm curious as to whether the presence of a stuffed animal in a child's early development as a variable correlated with the portrayal of animals eating cultural foods.  I have a follow up question: when do you think one should begin teaching kids, either in the classroom or parent-child setting, to be ecologically literate?"
babyelephantgifs,3csr2k,sabbrielle,2,Fri Jul 10 18:21:39 2015 UTC,"Your hypothetical explanation is pretty insightful. It's actually fairly similar to my final discussion section of the paper, where I hypothesize that the results may have to do with the hypermediation of certain animals. There were other variables and elements in my research that also lend evidence toward this, but I don't want to give my entire paper away here until the publication process is finished, lol. But just to say, that yeah that was my thoughts too - that some animals are so hypermediated that their ""reality"" is blurred and they become caricatures of themselves, or become nothing more than a character so athropomorphized that they might as well just be a human in an outfit, or some humanized alien race that's the same in every way to a person except how it looks.    when do you think one should begin teaching kids, either in the classroom or parent-child setting, to be ecologically literate?   Research suggests that children are already learning about the outdoors at a young age. The question is just what are we teaching them.  The naturalist in me would say as early as first grade. It was great joy taking out groups of the younger kids to explore the forest. One of my favorite moments was when a second grader got my attention to point out a little beetle on a flower, or when a bunch of kids were afraid of the ""spider"" on the trail, only to watch that fear subside when I picked up the harvestman and showed them that nature doesn't have to be something to fear or destroy, but can be appreciated gently and with empathy.  If you're interested in this area of study, I recommend the work of Kellert (for academic research) and the book Why the Wild Things Are by Melson. In the book she examines how children are exposed to different ideas about animals in culture. I cite them both fairly heavily in my lit review.  Edit: another book I'd recommend is Last Child in the Woods, which has become (is becoming) one of the most prominent books regarding childhood outdoor experiences."

Who do I need to bribe, where do I need to travel?  (I also do not want to contribute to elephant suffering or support an organization that causes net harm to elephants in any way.

babyelephantgifs,3csr2k,The_Other_Olsen,24,Fri Jul 10 14:52:30 2015 UTC,"I appreciate the passion behind your love for elephants and desire to hug a baby elephant. I think most of us who follow this subreddit harbor secret (or not so secret) desires to smother a baby pachyderm in love and physical affection.   In my opinion there are better ways to support elephants and express your love for such a beautiful animal. Let me explain why, after spending a lot of time around elephants and elephant lovers, I have come to this conclusion. As I mentioned in another reply, elephants are an incredibly large and dangerous wild animal. There are a lot of situations that have put elephants into captivity in various places. There are opportunities (especially in SE Asia) for you to interact in person and physically with an elephant. These places range quite a bit in their treatment of elephants and I in no way want to make sweeping comments that condemn these places. Some of them do tireless work to protect elephants that have had an unfortunate past. Ethically though I think it is unfair for humans to expect emotional connections with a wild animal, like the elephant. Dogs have been bred for thousands of years to be domesticated and to genuinely love and thrive off human attention. Elephants have not. Elephants, even when in captivity, are still a wild animal and therefore I believe that a respectful way to appreciate everything that is wonderful about the species and express your love toward them is not to hug them but to watch them ""hug"" each other and to let elephants, well, be elephants."

If you have a major in the arts or humanities or one that doesn't ""naturally"" fit with elephant conservation, there are still plenty of ways to help. The sidebar of this subreddit has links to a number of organizations - many of which likely have ways to help.  For example, while not related to elephants, when I was in undergrad I tabled for our environmental club on issues like mountaintop removal coal mining and climate change. It costs almost nothing to sit at a table all day outside the cafeteria talking to people about an issue, and who knows - something like that could open up volunteer opportunities for you.   If I see an elephant at the fair that is ride-able should I not ride it because it hurts them?   My personal point of view and opinion is that since elephants are highly intelligent animals with complex social structures, the conditions found in fairs often prevents them from really being elephants. I'd prefer they be able to experience life in the wild, and if that's not possible, in sanctuaries, where they can do all the things elephants do. I do recognize that it's a complex issue, however.   If I wanted to go help take care of baby elephants where can I go?   I'm not entirely sure, and there are likely people on this sub that know more than I would about this one. Sorry I can't be more helpful. One idea - If you're in the US, there is an elephant sanctuary in Tennessee that you could try volunteering or working for, but it's mostly retired elephants who were granted asylum, not infants or adolescents.   Where can I buy this book?   Amazon is probably the easiest, unless you want a signed copy, in which case the Oakenday Press store has a few."

babyelephantgifs,3avhhq,BatCountry9,17,Wed Jun 24 00:25:24 2015 UTC,"This is one of those footages that just proves to me that elephants are extremely intelligent, at least in a more human-relatable way than most other animals. A brain that can make connections related to tools and how to utilize them isn't exactly common in the animal kingdom..."
babyelephantgifs,3avhhq,JustAWonderfulMan,6,Wed Jun 24 06:51:39 2015 UTC,"Tool use was considered something only humans did when I was in school. We now know that is bs, as is so much of what I learned.  I think at this point we are down to 'sense of humor' as the only behavior that separates us from 'animals' and I personally think that one is bs as well. I have had two dogs who both had a distinct sense of humor - it was/is about the level of a two year old but it is distinct nonetheless."
babyelephantgifs,3avhhq,shillyshally,3,Wed Jun 24 15:00:34 2015 UTC,I mean yeah I know it's not just a human thing. For instance there are types of birds able to use small twigs as tools and stuff like that. But with this there's just something about the way the elephant casually takes the brush and goes to town on itself that to me indicates true consciousness. I think it's partly the fact that it's not for any directly survival-related purpose. Idk I ain't no scientist.
babyelephantgifs,3avhhq,JustAWonderfulMan,2,Wed Jun 24 21:06:47 2015 UTC,"Yeah me, neither but I remember thinking hey, seems like South America and Africa fit together and being told NO, THE CONTINENTS DO NOT MOVE (this literally changed while I was in college from heresy to accepted science).  I just saw a YouTube of a rabbit attacking a snake that threatened her babies and a Cat scare away a big, black bear. Years from now, dissertations will be written about how YouTube changed our perception of the natural world and how we realized we aren't the only smarties on this planet.  Jane Goodall started it. I still remember my Mom and I reading her first book. It was a revelation more profound than anything Christianity had to offer."
babyelephantgifs,3avhhq,shillyshally,2,Wed Jun 24 21:14:04 2015 UTC,"Wow...that's pretty crazy. Roughly how long ago was it that people were convinced landmasses don't move? Seems laughably backward now.  And yeah, the thought that a simple idea like an online platform where people can share video footage has open sourced all kinds of knowledge, including that of the natural world, is pretty freaking cool.  Now that I think about it, most of what I ""know"" about nature (including both empirical facts and educated assumptions) comes from youtube or some other kind of Internet research."
babyelephantgifs,3avhhq,JustAWonderfulMan,3,Wed Jun 24 21:22:15 2015 UTC,"I entered college in 1966, graduated in 1970. It changed that fast!  But here's something to think about - a lot of what you 'know' now, will be bullshit by the time you are my age. Maybe not as much as it was for me since communications are so much better and the pace of change itself has changed so dramatically.  You live in an age of miracles, kid. You young folks have NO IDEA what it was like to grow up with a one volume encyclopedia, to have to go to the friggin library (understocked no matter how good) and search through the card catalog.   I am so happy to have EXPERIENCED the transition. To have an Echo, to have a Kindle, to have a friggin smart phone! We had one phone, short cord, no privacy, no answering service, no call block.  I would love to know what you post about change when you are 67."
babyelephantgifs,3avhhq,shillyshally,2,Wed Jun 24 23:03:03 2015 UTC,"Haha wow, that is incredible. At 23, I don't think I've yet lived through a change in scientific knowledge that was that fundamental, at least not one that's low-level enough for me to understand why it's important. It's probably happened, but I'm hard-pressed to come up with a sound example (maybe something to do with climate change?)  Anyway, yeahh pretty glad the Internet is a thing, I don't know how I would've survived all the research I had to do in school without so many great databases of scholarly journals, news articles, and the like. It's still hard sometimes, but I do try not to take any of it for granted, it really IS miraculous.  I'm sure a lot of things will change by the time I'm 67, but...as long as there are still elephants in this world, I think I'll be happy! Hopefully we will have learned their language by then :D"

Whatever the case, a trunk is basically all muscle. And it's big, long, and attached to the head for extra leverage. And there's no muscle in the human body even close to the mass of an elephant's trunk because they weigh approximately twice as much as a fully grown human (~400 lbs). That's an absolutely incredible amount of muscle to have at your disposal, let alone that amount in one appendage.  But actually, pound for pound, trunks aren't fantastic at lifting weight because they don't have the bone structure and joints to use as levers and fulcrums the way a whole human body does, for example."

babyelephantgifs,38sg8i,love_the_heat,39,Sat Jun 6 12:28:42 2015 UTC,That might be the purpose of the dogs. I went to a park in Canada 2xa day they take the elephants swimming in a pond. There were 5 elephants and 2 dogs. A3 foot tall fence separated the elephants and us and the only thing keeping them from coming at us were the dogs. Every time one started to a dog would run over and the elephant would back away.
babyelephantgifs,38sg8i,RossPerotVan,24,Sat Jun 6 13:17:16 2015 UTC,Lol elephants afraid of dogs. That is nuts. I bet the dog would have trouble even breaking an adult elephant's skin. Depending on the breed and size ofc. and the elephant could easily crush a dog with one squeeze of its trunk.
babyelephantgifs,38sg8i,ayriuss,20,Sat Jun 6 14:54:41 2015 UTC,"It's not that nuts when you think about it. Predators much smaller than the elephants take them down, especially when they are young. A large elephant might not get too hurt by a lion on its own, but that doesn't mean it will want to get close to one. It is better to be scared of more than you absolutely need to be than it is to not fear what you should from an evolutionary standpoint so caution is pretty common when encountering other animals especially if they show an aggression towards you no matter how much larger you are."
babyelephantgifs,38sg8i,goblinish,10,Sat Jun 6 16:08:35 2015 UTC,yeah there are no doctors and medicine in the wild to fix you up after a fight. it's better to avoid fights and potentially debilitating injuries if one can help it.

babyelephantgifs,38sg8i,RossPerotVan,1 point,Sat Jun 6 20:00:04 2015 UTC,That caution is generally learned. The young are generally herded into the middle of a group of adults when danger is present. It doesn't know what it should be scared of.

But I'd like to know.  I could very easily live among baby elephants. I could quit my job, sell everything I own, travel down south, get a job/internship at an elephant reserve, help birth a baby elephant, bond with it, help raise it, follow it into adulthood, see the birth of its offspring, raise THEM, see maybe the birth of more offspring before I had to retire.   Or maybe I didn't retire. Maybe I kept going. Maybe I kept growing and raising elephant babies until the day I couldnt, then had an open aire hospital room where the elephants that I bonded with would come every day and push their tough tusks against my face, rubbing it to tell me they love me and to keep fighting.   And then I have to let go. My elephants have lives that I'm no longer a part of. I've put them through the hardest part of their life and they can run free. They no longer need me and I can die happy.  Fun fact; this is my greatest fear. I'm the elephant and my mom is the trainer. I can't ever be ""free"" and on my own because if I ever had a moment that I didn't need my mom, she would die and leave me alone which would most likely kill me/render me useless to anyone. I need my mom. Which is why no matter how much money I make I still make sure she has to help me out a little to make my bills paid.   I'm an asshole of a daughter. But I can't live without her and never want to.   Tl;Dr: I'm drunk and missing my mom and wish I was a baby elephant. Don't mock me, you wish you were me."

babyelephantgifs,35yw7o,zanatlol,3,Sat May 16 17:59:20 2015 UTC,Pretty sure I remember an interview with the writers admitting they were just making it up as they went (without any real plot planned ahead).

babyelephantgifs,35qh14,tara1,30,Tue May 12 17:51:09 2015 UTC,I'm surprised a Cessna can carry the weight of an elephant! Strapping his feet down doesn't sound quite reassuring enough to prevent an elephant from pulling a plane that sized out of the air.
babyelephantgifs,35qh14,ThePendulum,45,Tue May 12 23:05:50 2015 UTC,"Max was almost more than the plane could carry, along with the pilot and the other passengers. There was a risk that if he moved around too much, or panicked, it would have become uncontrollable.  ""With an animal that size you can feel its weight shifting in the aircraft and I had to have some restraining straps so it wouldn't go all the way to the back of the aircraft - otherwise he would go outside of our controllable range,"" Roberts recalls. Max still had diarrhoea and was too weak to be sedated. Instead, they tied ropes around his feet so they could disable his movement if necessary.  ""He was quite interested in playing with my controls, he would put his trunk forward and feel my hand and touch the controls and of course feel my face,"" says Roberts. ""It was a bit of a distraction but at the same time a unique experience."" Roberts filmed it all on his mobile phone.   From the article!"
babyelephantgifs,35qh14,thehollowman84,16,Wed May 13 00:41:38 2015 UTC,Its amazing how curious baby elephants are.   I wish I could meet one ;(

babyelephantgifs,35qh14,foxh8er,5,Wed May 13 18:04:12 2015 UTC,"Same here. When I was riding in my friend's Cessna, we had to monitor the weight very closely. I'm really surprised 2 people and an elephant meet the weight limits, but then again this is probably in Africa where they don't worry as much. If it flies, it fits."
babyelephantgifs,35qh14,upsidedownbackwards,8,Tue May 12 23:59:30 2015 UTC,"Could be a bigger version, Cessna makes quite a few models."
babyelephantgifs,35qh14,DLK601,7,Wed May 13 01:48:23 2015 UTC,"The plane is a Cessna 172 and the max take-off weight is 2,450 pounds and the aircraft weighs 1,700 pounds so that leaves 750 pounds for the 2 passengers and elephant. The elephant was 350 pounds that leaves 300 pounds for the passengers so they would be very close to the max weight if not over the max weight. The aircraft has to be tested with more than 2,450 pounds to prove that this is a safe weight for the aircraft. So they are still able to take-off safely with this amount of weight."
babyelephantgifs,35qh14,Surrealvantage,4,Wed May 13 02:22:26 2015 UTC,"There are multiple models of the 172, each are type certificated for different useful loads depending largely on horsepower. Also, fuel also deducts from the useful load, so you'll have even less than that. Finally, certificated weight does not account for a safety margin, and many small aircraft can carry quite a bit more than certificated."

Actually, I paid to buy the buck I sent to /u/jenbanim, and now I sent it easily and instantly as a ""tip"" to a fellow Reddit user whose comment I appreciated.  True, I think it is very cool to be able to transmit real value over the Net with just text. (Yes, it has real value since you can buy stuff with it, directly, whithour changing it into dollars or whatever money operates in your country.)  True, I like to share my excitement about it, the same way I invited friends to sign up for Gmail back when it first started.  But I am not trying to convert anyone who is not interested. If /u/jenbanim doesn't want my tip, they don't have to take it.  tl;dr There is a fine line separating ""enjoying something new and interesting, being excited about it, and therefore wanting to share it with people"" and ""pushing useless things for profit"".

babyelephantgifs,34ge5x,Izawwlgood,4,Fri May 1 21:34:16 2015 UTC,Well if they don't want it they don't have to claim it. But what other way would you recommend sending users money over Reddit?
babyelephantgifs,34ge5x,FileTransfer,-4,Fri May 1 18:21:35 2015 UTC,"If he had sent even 10$ or above, you'd have a point. With just a buck? That's like leaving a tip for a waiter like this"
babyelephantgifs,34ge5x,DrProbably,5,Fri May 1 19:12:55 2015 UTC,In that case maybe a dollar means a lot less to you than it does to me ;) I should also probably add putting a 20 like that requires active effort to make the tip harder to get to. If there were an easier way to give people money on Reddit I would probably use that instead so its not super comparable.
babyelephantgifs,34ge5x,FileTransfer,-1,Fri May 1 19:26:23 2015 UTC,It's not a perfect metaphor but the point I'm making is that it's an attempt to indoctrinate someone to a system (a system that's growth you hypothetically benefit from) for a pittance. No thanks.
babyelephantgifs,34ge5x,DrProbably,5,Fri May 1 19:28:37 2015 UTC,No one is brainwashing anyone or asking people not to criticize the system here so calling a hard-to-claim tip indoctrination is a bit silly. Hell its not perfect obviously but its open source so anyone who is C++ smart enough can go make something else out of it entirely. I think you're confusing using bitcoin with being part of /r/bitcoin. It like saying watching streaming channels on youtube means you love pewdiepie. /r/bitcoin is kinda full of fanatics and its unfortunate they are preachy and people associate them with anything. I'm personally really excited about it but it doesn't mean that it doesn't have major problems or that everyone should use it. That's just stupid. So if you have a use for it use it. If not don't. I don't care. But if you're going to be insulted by someone's attempt at a gesture of kindness then maybe the high horse isn't the place to be.
babyelephantgifs,34ge5x,FileTransfer,-3,Fri May 1 19:41:54 2015 UTC,"a gesture of kindness   We have fundamentally different views about the intentions of the tip and your metaphor is even worse than mine. bitcoin growing potentially helps everyone that uses it, not just the lunatics so any pushing of it's use inherently can't be altruistic."

babyelephantgifs,34ge5x,TheOldAmanda,7,Fri May 1 16:39:20 2015 UTC,"Actually elephants are incredibly kind to their babies. The entire herd dotes, loves, and cares for each baby. They can be territorial when they grow up, but for the most part elephants could teach us humans about compassion and bravery.  Edit: it were you talking about the humans? After reading it again I think I got that mixed up."
babyelephantgifs,34ge5x,Aylesbury,-7,Fri May 1 10:25:44 2015 UTC,"I think you did. India is an absolutely horrid place. Elephants seem rather loveable. Humans, generally speaking, aren't so bad, animals also fight wars over land, rape, kill for fun etc etc, but I can't think of one thing elephants do that could be considered morally wrong by human stands, implying that we can judge nature by western, 21st century moral standards. Most individuals are also essentially nice, but Indians as a people who shape and construct what India is today on a day to day basis - I think it's utterly disgusting and I wonder why people aren't fleeing from there."

I remember my first ""meeting"". They are way, way bigger in person, like...way bigger. Pictures and videos just do not convey the sense of sheer mass (IIRC she was around 8000 lbs, 3600 kg) and power that being next to one of these things conveys. I don't know how to describe it, but trust me, you can just feel it. The fact that female Africans have tusks just made it even more humbling.

This one was a bit bigger when I was there and also played with me and CRUSHED me. I had a huge bruise on my thigh afterwards but it was totally worth it.  This place is an actual sanctuary so there is absolutely no riding, and many of the elephants bear scars from their years as riding elephants. They live in the jungle during the night and come to the village in the morning for food and (some) pets.  If anybody wants more info let me know!"

babyelephantgifs,33gv9h,ghettone,8,Wed Apr 22 22:06:48 2015 UTC,"Elephants have difficulty cooling themselves because they are so large.  It's a consequence of the square-cube law. As you increase an object's size, its volume increases much faster than its surface area. All macroscopic animals rely on their surface area for heat regulation, whether it is a lizard basking in the sun to heat itself, or a cat seeking shade to cool itself.  Warm-blooded animals generate heat by metabolism roughly in proportion to their volume. They can dissipate heat roughly in proportion to their surface area (as their surface area is the area exposed to the atmosphere). Since volume increases much faster than surface area as you increase an object's size, larger warm-blooded animals have more difficulty dissipating heat than smaller ones.  African elephants are about at the limit of land mammal physiology. They dissipate heat just faster than they generate it, under good conditions. That's why they instinctively do things that help them cool themselves - spray cool, moist earth on their bodies, roll around in mud holes, and wade in the water.  I guess you can think of an elephant as you walking around your town all day when it's 100 degrees out. If you're a healthy adult and keep hydrated, the sun will go down and it will cool off before you die of heat stroke. But after 30 minutes or so, man, wouldn't it be nice to duck into that air-conditioned Starbucks for a bit?  (Elephants and humans cool themselves differently on hot days. We humans sweat; since evaporating water carries off energy, we can still keep our internal body temperature regulated at about 99 degrees F even when the air temperature is close to or above that, as long as we stay hydrated. Elephants would lose too much water through sweating, and only have vestigial sweat glands in the skin around their toenails; they fan their big, thin ears to cool blood and send it to the rest of the body.)"

babyelephantgifs,30um19,gnualmafuerte,45,Tue Mar 31 05:47:27 2015 UTC,"When I was a kid, I had a female duck named Facunda. She was awesome! Had her since I was 6 months old. When I was around 6 I believe, she was going nuts nursing her eggs, she really needed to have duckies; so since we didn't have a male duck available, we got some fertilized eggs from a friend, and switched them with her. She had 8 beautiful ducks. It was amazing seeing her walk around with all the ducks behind her all over the backyard. Anyway, when she died (she was like 10 years old, I think), all of the ducks congregated around her, and kept poking her, and sitting all around to warm her up. They stayed there easily 8 hours. I've never cried more in my entire life."

It also showed how upbringing is stronger than genetics, ducks are usually pretty dumb, but Facunda was raised as a dog more than like a duck, and pretty much acted like one. She would fight my other dogs (who were actually pretty scared of her), you could call her and she would come and let you cuddle with her, she was absolutely incredible. My favorite food when I was a kid was a traditional Argentinian food, ""Milanesas con papas fritas y huevos fritos"" (fried breaded beef fillet with french fries and sunny side up eggs), with a twist (the eggs she laid). Every time I have that dish, I can't avoid but smile and think of her. Awesomest pet ever."

babyelephantgifs,30fnic,NappingisBetter,10,Fri Mar 27 18:18:47 2015 UTC,"Actually I bet it has to do with practice for pushing over trees as an adult. Elephants push trees down to eat the leaves at the top, and they push it down by rearing up and trying to come down on it.   It may seem mean to the trees, but it's actually an important factor in the balancing of their ecosystems. Trees overtake grasslands, and without a ""predator"" like elephants they would overflourish and drive out grazing animals."
babyelephantgifs,30fnic,WakeAndVape,3,Fri Mar 27 16:18:41 2015 UTC,They don't really rear up to do it though - that would require a kind of half-jump motion they're not really capable of because of their weight. They more just put the trunk on it and walk forward until the tree topples over.  Still maybe you're right. To me it seems more like the generic silly behaviour of an animal still learning to use its body though.  Btw I don't actually believe baby elephants have prescient knowledge of their adult lives...

babyelephantgifs,30fnic,2-4601,12,Fri Mar 27 09:07:34 2015 UTC,"According to the googles,    Having a baby elephant is a serious commitment. Elephants have a longer pregnancy than any other mammal‚Äîalmost 22 months. Cows usually give birth to one calf every two to four years. At birth, elephants already weigh some 200 pounds (91 kilograms) and stand about 3 feet (1 meter) tall.   So it's not unlike having a 200lb toddler climb over you."

People naturally think to face them from the front, but they want to see you from the side, or ideally in a cone of distance where they can get the gist of you and yours.  For adults, it must be easier, as they are huge and put themselves where they want to be.  I guess it's something to think about that their mamas let people approach them from the front, when it could be perceived as a threat.  They're smart enough to see that."

babyelephantgifs,2yvk57,BatCountry9,6,Fri Mar 13 17:01:03 2015 UTC,"I think that helps, but for me it's that their knees bend toward each other like humans (imagine you're on all four). I'm sure there's a biology term for it, but other animals (not all but many) like horses' and hippos' knees bend outward giving them a very nonhuman look.   That and an elephant's back ankles aren't very prominent and are low down next to the foot, unlike its front legs. All together it makes their back legs look very human."

One downside: I'm based in the EU (France) and donations entitle me to tax rebates (donates 3‚Ç¨ = 2‚Ç¨ rebate on taxes).

So many things need charitable help,  it's very difficult to decide where to put those dollars,  but if anything's worthwhile,  it would be these complex giants.  I watched a video once of a male elephants mate/best friend being shocked by an (inadvertently super hot) electrical wire.  His anguish and stress was written all over his face!  Literally looked human.  All the behaviors we witness.  It isn't anthropomorphism,  it's sentience and emotion.  More funds are urgently needed to fight this poaching,  and stiffer punishments.  It's just not fair."

babyelephantgifs,2y8jq8,altoid2k4,5,Sat Mar 7 22:55:08 2015 UTC,"Really? I have loads of memories from my first few years. The birth of my brother, me rolling down the stairs, eating uncooked pasta, asking how the floor inside the house could be flat whilst the ground outside was sloped, feeding carrots to deer on my 3rd birthday, seeing a lightning bolt for the first time...  I used to live in Sevenoaks (near London) then moved North when I was 3, so I have that point to place the time of a memory against.  I think my absolute earliest memory is probably being told that I was going to have a brother. I was in the bath. He was born when I was 2 years, 11 months old, so that places the memory at probably about 2 years, 3-4 months."

babyelephantgifs,2wfa7t,Buffalo__Buffalo,6,Thu Feb 19 20:42:51 2015 UTC,"I think there's two things to consider here:  1) Going by weight and size, humans are comparatively weak in regards to just about any other animal. Basically we traded gross motor skills for fine motor skills; A gorilla could probably rip your arm off where a human could probably bruise a gorilla.  2) Elephant trunks are essentially all muscle. Being hit by one would be similar to being struck by a rubber hose of the same size and thickness. Even a baby elephant could cause some damage with a flick of their trunk."

babyelephantgifs,2u2awo,twinwindowfan,24,Thu Jan 29 15:41:32 2015 UTC,Excellent use of the uncommon elephantile back knees there.
babyelephantgifs,2u2awo,Richeh,4,Thu Jan 29 12:22:35 2015 UTC,"Actually knees on the back legs are common.  For example, dogs technically have elbows on their front legs.  It is the knees on the front legs that are uncommon. It is so  uncommon that I believe elephants are the only animal with four knees!"
babyelephantgifs,2u2awo,SOULJAR,10,Thu Jan 29 18:51:49 2015 UTC,"They don't have 4 knees. They have elbows on their front limbs, and what look like knees are actually their wrists.  The difference between elbow and knee joint is the direction of flexion and extension movements. The way the wrist and lower leg of the front limbs flex upwards makes the joint an elbow. Knees don't work that way."
babyelephantgifs,2u2awo,SilverSnakes88,2,Thu Jan 29 22:53:07 2015 UTC,"Biologist here who teaches vertebrate anatomy. Knees on back legs are common, yes, but in elephants the knee is unusually far down on the leg. It's almost 50% of the way down, free of the body wall, and is positioned as the main joint of the leg. The knees are highly mobile in elephants and can even take body weight when necessary - the animal can ""kneel"", as in this video, and can even ""crawl"" on their knees. This is unusual. In most quadrupeds the knee is only of 20-30% of the way down the limb, is bound into the body wall, has restricted mobility, and never takes body weight (the animal can't ""kneel"" or ""crawl"").   Also in elephants the entire lower leg is very short, with a relatively immobile ankle, in contrast to other quadrupeds where ""foot"" is greatly elongated and the ankle (hock) is high up off the ground.   Basically in elephants the knee is the main joint of the hind leg, rather than the hock (ankle) being the main joint."

Look up ""DSWT elephant blankets"" and you will see the background on the blankets. It's actually an incredible provision for the babies that simulates the protection they would get in the wild. At the nursery where this particular baby is at, the public is only allowed to see the elephants for one hour a day. During that time the babies are allowed to interact with each other and their keepers freely. No staged tricks or performance. The babies enjoy this time and I actually think they don't even notice the crowd because of the close bonds they have with each other and their keepers. Hope this helps :)"

babyelephantgifs,2se6be,LeGrandeMoose,3,Wed Jan 14 14:46:34 2015 UTC,"Actually, dogs that are missing a leg or two (as long as they still have one front and one back leg) typically can run as fast as dogs of comparable size and breed. It's because of the way they run. When at full speed, the dogs legs work in pairs (front with front, back with back) instead of all four separately like when they are running or doing a slow trot. I'd bet they might not be able to cut or accelerate quite as quickly as their four legged brothers and sisters. To my understanding, elephants can run fast, faster than your average person, but they don't break out into the same bow or spring like motion that dogs can achieve, they are just too heavy to do that. All that being said, I'm not really sure who would win in this race, but if assume the elephant might have a slight advantage in the soft sand sue to the surface area of its feet.  Here is a cool 2 legged dog named Dominic running around.   http://youtu.be/UXPJJeISuXo"

babyelephantgifs,2s5qvt,artcopywriter,5,Tue Jan 13 07:38:15 2015 UTC,"I felt extremely safe in Chiang Mai. If you volunteer with this organization, your housing and meals are covered. Although it can be a little costly, it is definitely worth it. There are many projects to choose from and each one is extremely different from the next. I highly recommend SEF as you will get to learn more about the plight of Asian elephant conservation. You will get to have a positive experience with these elephants, as they get to live happily and free from abuse."

And there are about 2 different options you can do depending on your background. They have a veterinary experience where you can actually provide veterinary work on the elephants that require additionally attention (some were in landmine accidents), or you are a general volunteer where you do all the basic needs such as preparing food, cleaning enclosures, bathing and feeding elephants, fixing fences, cutting corn, etc. I did general volunteering and had a lot of fun doing it. If you have any other questions, let me know!"

Different areas of the elephant have different thickness, like the top of their back can be over an inch of top layer scabby skin. The sides/legs/trunk feel sort of like an iguana's skin (only thicker and fleshier) and the thin areas (behind the ear, armpits) area like your elbow or knee.

babyelephantgifs,2s03w4,nliausacmmv,8,Sun Jan 11 04:03:23 2015 UTC,Where does one get baby formula for an elephant?
babyelephantgifs,2s03w4,TheRocketDog,25,Sun Jan 11 02:56:49 2015 UTC,"Very good question. Baby elephants are milk dependent for their first 3-5 years of life.   One of the tragedies of saving baby elephants is that their rescuers often feed them cow's milk. Elephants have no tolerance for bovine fat, and feeding cow's milk to a baby elephant is often a death sentence.  The first baby elephant cared for by Dame Daphne Sheldrick died, in part due to being fed cow's milk. Her name was Aisha, but her life did not end in vain. Dame Daphne developed a milk formula suitable for infant elephants following Aisha's death, and hundreds of elephants are alive today because of her work. The formula is based on coconut milk."

babyelephantgifs,2rx3eo,sunset7766,7,Sat Jan 10 04:27:44 2015 UTC,I wonder how old that baby is... Is it attempting to walk for the first time or is it a few days old and it fell over...?
babyelephantgifs,2rx3eo,goblinish,4,Sat Jan 10 04:14:46 2015 UTC,It's definitely not the first time the baby has walked. Newborn elephants get up and walk very soon after birth. If this was immediately following birth there would be afterbirth and fluid everywhere. Looks more like baby took a nap and is having some trouble getting up.

Stupid of me I just checked with the local hostel/booking points there not online.    I did a 2 day trek in the mountains and included was time with elephants, they assured me it was a good place we would go to. Except they were chained up and were more rollercoaster attractions then animals. Need to go back and visit one of these places that actually care for the animals."
babyelephantgifs,2r960d,KandaFierenza,14,Sun Jan 4 14:22:59 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that was one of the things the sanctuary was trying to promote to us. The mistreatment of them;They (not the sanctuary just to clarify) beat the elephant into submission with the use of a hook and this also how they train elephants to paint ( which actually damages their trunks). When we hiked up, we heard the trumpeting of a nearby escaped elephant who had run to us in the morning upon hearing our heffalumps.   I thoroughly recommend you check out Lek and her sanctuary. When you're there you can see that there's so much mutual respect between her and the elephants. Any support would do the place justice to support and help rescue more of them."

babyelephantgifs,2r960d,KandaFierenza,4,Mon Jan 5 04:23:27 2015 UTC,"well, the link I provided I'll post again, pretty much has you covered. Whilst I can only recommend one place because it was the only one I trusted, I know this sanctuary to be the more 'internationally recognised one'.  There will be others but I can't answer for them as I don't have any experience.   I think it's a fabulous idea and I'm glad that you've been inspired! This was in 2009ish so I might be out of date but you're provided housing accommodation/food and you just help out with preparation. There are showers there ( public but it's all clean and well looked after) and I can't remember if they provide towels but I'm going to assume they don't so bring a towel. They provide transport to and from the airport which is extremely entertaining because the further you go into the mountains, the more the road deteriorate. Our clothing was dusty and muddy too, so don't bring any clothing you wouldn't want destroyed! I recommend not to travel just after the rainy season as there are more mosquitos about ( I think this is usually March/April again I'd recommend not to trust my word and go on google). Feel free to ask any more questions and I'll do my best to assist you.   Whilst I know there is much to do in Chiang-mai, we (my family) didn't really go outside the sanctuary and was just enjoying the peacefulness of the place so I can't help you with the touristy stuff.

babyelephantgifs,2qt80n,hiyosilver64,24,Tue Dec 30 16:31:41 2014 UTC,"Don't be too sad, the ""small"" area you are seeing is actually just the elephants indoor play area.  Their yard outside is WAY bigger and looks absolutely beautiful, but its a bit cold in Oklahoma right now so they can't exactly let the baby outside yet.  And if you see the baby separated from Asha (her mama) its probably because they are bathing or doing check-ups on Asha."

babyelephantgifs,2qt80n,TheNoodlyNoodle,9,Tue Dec 30 19:21:20 2014 UTC,"The elephant you are seeing right now is no baby, that is a full grown male bull.  His name is Rex and he is the father of the newborn.  I didn't actually look at the webcam before answering you last time so I just assumed it was the baby you were watching. The keepers would never separate the mother and baby for more than a few minuets for check-up and baths, unless of course the mother becomes violent towards the baby.  But that is unlikely since this is Asha's second child, the other being 3 years old I believe.  Edit: Also, the male will never be put on exhibit with either of the babies or the females unless the keepers are attempting to breed them.  Edit #2: Here is a size comparison of a baby and its mother.  Male Asian elephants are even larger than then the females."

I'm fairly confident that it is not the new baby on the current feed (11:15 am Oklahoma time). The elephant I just saw on the cam wasn't the baby. It was the father. Only male Asian elephants have tusks and the one I saw on the cam had large, though truncated, tusks. As I recall, this zoo herd only has one male (the father) and males often aren't with the females of wild elephant herds."

babyelephantgifs,2qj4lr,Pongpianskul,5,Sat Dec 27 18:38:30 2014 UTC,"To answer your question, yes it is possible. In Addo¬†Elephant National Park in the Eastern Cape of South Africa¬†have had¬†three sets of twins, with the latest being in 2005,¬†and Amboseli National Park in Kenya¬†had¬†a pair born in the 1970's.  Don't quote me on this, but I think it's technically possible for any mammal to, in theory, have twins.  I'm not saying they can successfully carry the twins to term and birth them, but I think they can technically have twins. Source"

babyelephantgifs,2pog60,Josetta,8,Thu Dec 18 14:57:46 2014 UTC,So where is this place located?  How many acres do the elephants get? I thought many zoos were giving their elephants away to large sanctuaries bc of a law on ethical elephant keeping (not the snow but the space requirements )? It's odd to see elephants playing in snow in a place called African lion safari.....

babyelephantgifs,2pog60,gumbercules6,1 point,Thu Dec 18 14:34:54 2014 UTC,Thanks for the link.  My parents went there before I was born. I have seen pictures from the park.. forgot about it. It seems they're kind of profiting off the elephants by displaying them at the watering hole or some shit . So that's fucked up.but it does look like they enjoy the snoq
babyelephantgifs,2pog60,betta-believe-it,4,Thu Dec 18 14:38:20 2014 UTC,"As you can see, Reddit tends to not like when you point out possible animal cruelty, even though your comment had the elephants' best interest."
babyelephantgifs,2pog60,gumbercules6,2,Thu Dec 18 15:15:30 2014 UTC,"I don't pretend that the majority shares my viewpoints on exotic animal care, it saddens me to think that the fall of human society and the earth will take down every other species. Fuck humans really. But if you read the wiki page there is some controversy surrounding the park; it does involve a radical animal rights group but being so far removed from African lion safari I choose to side with those who are trying to raise awareness on the plight of captive elephants in fucking Canada of all places. I live in Canada, this place is too damn cold."

babyelephantgifs,2papl0,atrueamateur,28,Mon Dec 15 00:51:50 2014 UTC,"This is the link that usually explains it best, but it's down now. Basically the blankets serve two purposes. One, they substitute for the shade and protection from the sun that they normally get from their parents. Their skin is very sensitive to sun at young ages. Second, the blankets are such a normal part of life at the sanctuary that the older orphans recognize them on the young ones and take an interest in them as new members of the family"

babyelephantgifs,2operj,thpasswordisusername,1 point,Tue Dec 9 17:51:13 2014 UTC,I'm used to most of elephants being treated very badly in that area of asia. How was it where you were? I went to Laos but no elephant stuff.
babyelephantgifs,2operj,u2412m,3,Tue Dec 9 18:19:42 2014 UTC,"It was awesome. I went to a family who owned three female elephants, they had 3 little boys, aged between 5-12 at the time I think. It was only me and my gf of the time, the tour guide and tour guides friend who was learning english.    They took us for a walk through the trees on the elephants which wasn't great because we thought they didn't want to, but then they took us to the river to swim and it was amazing. The boys became instantly energetic and starting jumping from elephant to elephant in the water. The elephants were swimming about and the boys had a command to yell so that the elephant would duck under the water and raise out while shaking like a dog in an attempt to throw you off. The boys would not stop doing it and laughing at us falling off.  After that we went back to their ""property"" where they lived and kept the elephants and feed them bananas.     The only mistreated elephants I saw were in Cambodia - The one in Phnom Penh which is chained up in the middle of a public park. And another while we were touring the temples: we went and tried to see it and as it walked forward the owner/trainer (I assume) hit it on the trunk, it steps backwards and we saw tears come from its eyes. I don't know if elephants cry like us, but it sure looked like it.    Also, on a side note, I went to the Tiger Temple in Kanchanaburi and disagree with the bullshit speculation that they are treated bad and drugged. They're fucking massive cats, cats sleep. It's 25 Celsius+ there daily, do you see many cats running around playing in the heat in the middle of the day? No! They are active in the cooler periods like the morning, evening and night. Cats are nocturnal animals, and Tigers are crepuscular! The idea that they're drugged is ridiculous. I never saw any trainer hit a Tiger either."
babyelephantgifs,2operj,thpasswordisusername,1 point,Wed Dec 10 06:37:15 2014 UTC,"Sounds awesome :) About the tigers, I didn't go. But maybe they aren't drugged they are at least in quite small confined spaces that can't be fun I guess."
babyelephantgifs,2operj,u2412m,1 point,Wed Dec 10 14:08:01 2014 UTC,"Nah not really, the canyon is quite large and they have their own space - there's about 10 meters give or take a few between each one, some are up on rock platforms also. They are chained up though, which isn't ideal for long hours (though I don't know if it's the same tigers there all day, as they don't put all their tigers out).   In the evening they sell spots to watch them get fed. They put you in a cage and then let the tigers run free while they get fed. There's also an exhibit that is very similar to what a zoo exhibit for tigers would look like. Overall it seemed pretty good, and there were various tourists who worked/volunteered there - they were all super happy and I don't think they would have done it had the tigers conditions been bad."

babyelephantgifs,2o852p,Vasilcin,23,Thu Dec 4 06:14:16 2014 UTC,"That is a terribly douchy thing to do if you are both exchanging gifts.   I mean if i'm giving you something you'll enjoy i would assume you would treat me the same way.  Donate money you otherwise intended to spend on yourself.  Not that this is my business at all, just thought i'd share my opinion."
babyelephantgifs,2o852p,Kkristenn,17,Thu Dec 4 14:20:38 2014 UTC,"In response to the original post, even better to simply request that others donate to charities as their gift to you. Otherwise you're giving people what YOU like, not what they like, and that is not the point. While it's still a great thing to donate, there's ways to do it where everyone will feel appreciated."
babyelephantgifs,2o852p,ambertino,6,Thu Dec 4 14:40:24 2014 UTC,"I choose the charity based on either something that they support, for example the person I'm donating to this fund for, went to Asia and came back disgusted in how they were treating the elephants there, she currently schools across the country and is a minimalist, hates clutter. So this is something I know she'd love."
babyelephantgifs,2o852p,Kkristenn,7,Thu Dec 4 19:41:30 2014 UTC,"That's a nice and thoughtful donation. We don't know your friends like you do, so if that's their thing then donate away! :)"
babyelephantgifs,2o852p,ambertino,3,Thu Dec 4 20:15:39 2014 UTC,"We don't do gift exchanges, maybe it's just our group but if somebody gifts you something you don't feel obliged to get them something back. A lot of my friends are in school across the country and gifts end up being something you feel obliged to drag across the country and back out of sentiment. A few years ago we started gifting charities, things like goats to world vision, etc. and would maybe get each other something small if we were close enough. I'm glad you'd rather have a 20$ trinket then help a cause in need. I think we migt run in different circles."

They make their money from a 3-5% fee toward the end of your checkout. There's an optional processing fee to help the site stay running and keep its prices competitive (this is also tax deductable). The credit card company also deducts their standard 2.9%+$0.30 fee from each donation.  The charities get the money by Network For Good or WePay.  As for how David Sheldwick Wildlife Trust spends their money, you can read their newsletter for now https://www.sheldrickwildlifetrust.org/html/2013.html  But I'm pressed for time and can't find the annual report right now.   Hope this helps. Any more questions feel free to ask!"

Dust bathing is a maintenance behavior performed by a wide range of mammalian and avian species. For some animals, dust baths are necessary to clean the feathers, skin, or fur, similar to bathing in water or wallowing in mud.

Echo and her sister elephant would not leave the little one and since he couldn't stand he had to crawl on his front knees. Echo and the other elephant ambled slowly along, waiting for the little one to find his legs. Eventually, sheltered under his mum when he stopped to rest, he managed to struggle to his front feet. Then he fell over. Then he stood up again and held it and, finally, a day after being born, he was tall enough to have a drink of mummy's milk and he got his first feed.  Goddamn elephants. :')"

The fact is that mahouts and elephant trainers use what is known as the 'torture training method' to make these wild creatures obedient and tourist friendly. This method involves tying or chaining the elephant up in a confined pen that is too small for the animal to move. True to its name, the elephant is then tortured constantly with beatings, often involving sharp instruments, and left without food or water for days or even weeks. This is designed to break the animal's spirit which it certainly achieves, often taking its sanity too.

babyelephantgifs,2nqvof,beastcoin,6,Sat Nov 29 23:09:41 2014 UTC,"Elephant Nature Park:       Elephant Nature Park is a sanctuary and rescue centre for elephants in Mae Taeng District, Chiang Mai Province, Northern Thailand, approximately 60 kilometres (37¬†mi) from Chiang Mai City. Founded in 1996, the project's aim is to provide sanctuary for distressed elephants from all over Thailand. Set in a natural valley, bordered by a river, and surrounded by forested mountains the sanctuary and surrounding area also offers a glimpse of rural life.

babyelephantgifs,2nqvof,beastcoin,0,Sat Nov 29 20:43:18 2014 UTC,How about you post this somewhere relevant instead of spamming a post that may or may not have anything to do with Thailand.
babyelephantgifs,2nqvof,lilamoi,2,Fri Dec 5 08:22:51 2014 UTC,"But it does have something to do with Thailand. Original poster of the video said it was taken near Chiang Mai, which happens to be in an area where elephant abuse is rife. Raising awareness about this issue among petiole who like elephants actually does make a difference because the issue exists as a result of people liking elephants - but just not understanding that it takes torture to make the animals compliant."

babyelephantgifs,2nd5n7,RebelT2i,7,Tue Nov 25 15:56:06 2014 UTC,"Yeah, orphaned baby elephants lack the surrounding warmth of their herd, so they wear blankets to keep them warm. Usually they hang around their mom and aunts and maybe even grandmother and feel safe and sheltered (from sun, sand, rain etc) and that also gives warmth, so they get these blankets.  The pattern is not lumberjack though, it's probably a Masai textile, which also exists out of checkered patterns (almost always with red) thinking these orphans live in either Kenia or Tanzania."
babyelephantgifs,2nd5n7,ChemicalRemedy,2,Tue Nov 25 15:49:41 2014 UTC,"It's the David Sheldrick Wildlife Trust orphanage for baby elephants. The main centre is in Nairobi, Kenya. It's freaking awesome, I was there this summer. Fostering one of these darlings is $50 US and they send you emails every month with pictures and news. The money goes to feeding and caring for them. Baby elephants are milk dependent until 5 years of age, and if their mom dies or something happens in that time, if they aren't rescued, they die. The orphanage feeds them human formula, which is the next best thing to mother's milk - cow's milk will kill a baby elephant.  And yes those are Masai blankets."

babyelephantgifs,2muq10,NedTaggart,14,Thu Nov 20 18:09:54 2014 UTC,"So, I watched the video, and I have questions...  How in the world to wild elephants come into proximity of humans? I know momma was an ex-orphan, I get how she would, but she brought wild elephants with her, they mixed with orphans and humans and then all wandered off again? How does this work?"
babyelephantgifs,2muq10,Seaxe,15,Thu Nov 20 22:48:59 2014 UTC,"The wild elephants learn from the ex-orphans that the humans at the orphanage are ""safe"" for them to be in contact with. And during the process of rehabilitation, the young orphans go into the bush to mix with the wild herds, so they can become familiar with each other."
babyelephantgifs,2muq10,pickles541,16,Thu Nov 20 15:44:15 2014 UTC,"To expand on this, elephants can understand human language to an extent. i.e. Elephants know that humans who speak, let's say, Spanish are poachers and kill on sight while those that speak Cantonese are neutral and will ignore you if you ignore them. But those that speak Swahili are friendlies who will help you take care of your children. Now I chose very different languages for the effect but they are able to understand the difference between African dialects of the same language like within English. Yankee accents are different from Dixie accents which are different from English accents. They all use the same words but are different.  tldr; Elephants are smart motherfuckers and I want to meet one."
babyelephantgifs,2muq10,i_dont_do_research,2,Thu Nov 20 18:25:35 2014 UTC,In the video it looks like when the wild elephants head over to the orphans the people back away to be safe. Then the orphans come over for a bit near the end then head back out with the wild elephants. So effort goes into making sure they don't make the wild ones feel threatened.

babyelephantgifs,2m6c7g,srirachagoodness,43,Thu Nov 13 14:27:34 2014 UTC,"Story time:   My ex and I adopted a black lab/boxer/something huge mix. When she was small, every night I would rock her and sing her to sleep. Then, I'd carry her up the stairs to bed. (I don't know, my kid was getting older and I was going through some sort of weird mommie withdrawal thing.)   Soon, she was so big I had to sit on the sofa with her standing up between my legs, her front legs over my shoulders to rock her. And it was getting increasingly difficult to get her up the stairs.   The whole time this is going on, my boyfriend is warning me against it. She and I ignored him. When she reached 90 lbs (I only weighed 125) and I couldn't lift her, he refused to help on principal.   If I tired to get her to walk up by herself, she'd flop down at the bottom of the stairs and throw a tantrum, rolling around and moaning. If we went up without her, she'd wail.   I tried dragging her, but no use. I tried luring her with treats, but she would eat the treat, run back down the stairs and flop down.   Finally, I convinced her to let me rock her on the edge of the bed. But, it only worked right before I went to bed. If I walked back downstairs for any reason, I had to start over.   The moral is, if you have a big dog or a pet elephant, maintain realistic expectations for you both."

babyelephantgifs,2m6c7g,lucklessly,25,Thu Nov 13 14:50:52 2014 UTC,"Well, as adorable as it is, it's also a little sad. In the wild baby elephants usually hide under their mothers, which protects them from the heat and sun, or she will cover them in mud. However, the one you see here and in sanctuaries tend to be orphans, so they have to use a blanket instead."
babyelephantgifs,2m6c7g,Buffalo__Buffalo,16,Thu Nov 13 14:55:56 2014 UTC,"Baby elephants normally take shelter in the shade cast by the adults in their group. Orphans don't have this luxury, unfortunately.  Older elephants are much less affected by the sun and as far as I know they use mud/dust to help protect them against the sun just like pigs do."
babyelephantgifs,2m6c7g,lucklessly,3,Thu Nov 13 15:09:27 2014 UTC,"Not if they've been abandoned, or there's no herd to look after them. Sanctuaries usually try to reintegrate the little'uns into the herd again, but if they can't they'll take them into their care."

babyelephantgifs,2m6c7g,UncleS1am,4,Thu Nov 13 17:55:29 2014 UTC,"If I recall correctly the blanket functions to keep them out of the sun in the summer, warm in the colder months, and as a source of comfort like a stuffed animal."

babyelephantgifs,2luor2,autowikibot,3,Mon Nov 10 16:18:18 2014 UTC,Are you sure? Nandi is a bull in Tamil as far as I know.  The word means 'sweet' in the Zulu language - that's the origin of the name.
babyelephantgifs,2luor2,_Respekt_,3,Tue Nov 11 02:52:19 2014 UTC,"Nandi (bull):       Nandi (Sanskrit: ‡§®‡§®‡•ç‡§¶‡•Ä, Tamil: ‡Æ®‡Æ®‡Øç‡Æ§‡Æø, Telugu: ‡∞®‡±¶‡∞¶‡∞ø) is the name for the bull which serves as the mount (Sanskrit: Vahana) of the god Shiva and as the gatekeeper of Shiva and Parvati. In Hindu Religion, he is the chief guru of eighteen masters (18 siddhas) including Patanjali and Thirumular.  Temples venerating Shiva display stone images of a seated Nandi, generally facing the main shrine. There are also a number of temples dedicated solely to Nandi.  The application of the name Nandi to the bull (Sanskrit: v·πõ·π£abha) is in fact a development of recent centuries, as Gouriswar Bhattacharya has documented in an illustrated article entitled ""Nandin and V·πõ·π£abha"".  The name Nandi was earlier widely used instead for an anthropomorphic deity who was one of Shiva‚Äôs two door-keepers, the other being MahƒÅkƒÅla. The doorways of pre-tenth-century North Indian temples are frequently flanked by images of MahƒÅkƒÅla and Nandi, and it is in this role of Shiva‚Äôs watchman that Nandi figures in KƒÅlidƒÅsa‚Äôs poem the KumƒÅrasambhava.

babyelephantgifs,2luor2,LordLlamahat,4,Tue Nov 11 03:39:15 2014 UTC,"Why would they stop it? I do believe that breeding is encouraged, actually, due to endangered populations and their attractiveness to zoo visitors."
babyelephantgifs,2luor2,tombh1,0,Mon Nov 10 22:01:40 2014 UTC,"I'm sorry but this is what we call the ""Sea-world argument"". To quote one study*:  ""In addition, many captive elephants develop aberrant behaviours that are not observed in wild elephants, such as stereotypic behaviours (meaningless repetitive movements that do not occur in the wild), like swaying, head-bobbing or pacing, hyperaggressiveness or lethargy.""  There's no idea exactly how many elephants are left but we estimate the African elephant at about 400,000 - please tell me how having one more very emotionally stressed elephant in captivity is an aid against extinction?   The ONLY reason a zoo would encourage breeding is like you said - attractiveness to zoo visitors. This usually out of financially gain rather than conservation. How easy do you think it is to breed a wild animal in captivity then orchestrate returning it to the wild?   *http://www.elephantsincanada.com/education-and-conservation"
babyelephantgifs,2luor2,XenoGalaxias,1 point,Mon Nov 10 22:49:30 2014 UTC,"Sorry, I was unclear. I didn't mean to insinuate that it was necessarily a good thing that they're breeding elephants, I was merely listing the reasons they have for allowing it to occur and even encouraging it. The zoos have little incentive to stop it, and many definitely still believe that captive elephant breeding programs are quite helpful in conserving the species."

babyelephantgifs,2l5gt3,ChingShih,24,Mon Nov 3 16:43:32 2014 UTC,Elephants have been documented using a variety of communication methods including subsonic vibrations through the ground that get picked up by their uniquely sensitive feet. But I don't know if there is anything vocalization specifically for mother-calf or family-group meetings. Elephants have a great sense of smell so that along with their physical means of making introductions probably suffices in lieu of vocal communications.

babyelephantgifs,2l5gt3,AndrewCarnage,1 point,Mon Nov 3 23:43:36 2014 UTC,To be honest I think it's a bit of both. It's got some aggressive body language for sure but typically it would just go straight for the charge. I would guess it was a bit of both.

The trunk is fully prehensile, meaning that they can pick things up with it/manipulate the world similarly to a hand. Their tails, however, are not nearly as useful or as well controlled, being more used for basic communication, swatting flies, etc. So while the mom might have done it on purpose, she couldn't really do much more than swish it around a bit!"

My local zoo (Oklahoma City Zoo) has some amazing people working with the elephants (Of which I believe their Asian elephant is in a conservation program, so there's that too) and I was chatting them up the last time they I was there. They are trained to raise their feet and open their mouths (Similar to what you see in the gif) to check for health. They trim toenails and check feet for injury, then they can check teeth/tongue/mouth/trunk as well. It just so happens that people like seeing them do these ""tricks.""

Water cools them down and gives them lots of feels. Plus they have a lot of playful energy as you can see from the hundreds of gifs. It's a perfect combination for them.

babyelephantgifs,2iuiuv,thesingularity004,8,Fri Oct 10 17:42:42 2014 UTC,"Dwarf elephant:       Dwarf elephants are prehistoric members of the order Proboscidea that, through the process of allopatric speciation on islands, evolved much smaller body sizes (around 1.5-2.3 metres) in comparison with their immediate ancestors. Dwarf elephants are an example of insular dwarfism, the phenomenon whereby large terrestrial vertebrates (usually mammals) that colonize islands evolve dwarf forms, a phenomenon attributed to adaptation to resource-poor environments and selection for early maturation and reproduction. Some modern populations of Asian elephants have also undergone size reduction on islands to a lesser degree, resulting in populations of pygmy elephants.

babyelephantgifs,2iuiuv,noiserr,11,Sat Oct 11 11:25:23 2014 UTC,what's the difference?
babyelephantgifs,2iuiuv,Zebanafain,16,Fri Oct 10 13:19:57 2014 UTC,"The GIF file format isn't really designed for what people use it for. If the creators thought we were going to use them for small movies then they'd have included smarter compression so that a ten second GIF would be as small a file as possible.  Meanwhile we have WEBM, or HTML5 video. This is a file format that's perfect for transferring small movies. Someone started Gfycat as a service to convert huge GIFs into HTML5 videos, resulting in smaller file sizes while maintaining the overall quality of the animation. They also provide a giant.gfycat.com link, which is a link to the original GIF file (mostly for people who for whatever reason can't view the HTML5 video).  Imgur has a size limit, and a lot of the GIFs people want to share are too big for it. So they put them on Gfycat, which converts them to videos, but then they post the giant.gfycat address as a link on reddit.  The link OP posted is just over 5 megabytes. That's not THAT big these days, but way bigger than it needs to be. I've seen GIFs on reddit that break the 20 megabyte mark. That's absurd!  The converted video version of OP's link, however, is a mere 460kb. That's less than a tenth the size, and a huge difference when it comes to downloading over a slower connection.  Basically: Don't go out of your way to use the wrong file format for your animations, especially when you've already gone to the trouble of putting it in the right format!"

babyelephantgifs,2hvrdk,tangatrond,2,Tue Sep 30 18:03:43 2014 UTC,"When I see this I logically come up with the idea of a small animal who's limbs don't bend to the necessary angles to stand in a slippery baby pool. Coincidentally that baby pool is just the correct size and height to be restrictive(notice he can't use his neck muscles, the only muscles with the ability to flex towards the ground, to get out) and it is slowly being filled up with more water. It seems reasonable enough the little guy might be thinking about the idea of drowning in said baby pool. Whether that animal be a baby elephant, a baby human, or a squirrel that my cat just dropped in the pool, it seems pretty obvious he's panicking, but hey, I could be wrong.  Every time his back right foot plants on the side of the pool he tries to place his neck on the side and get out of the pool, but he falls in when his foot slips. He does this a couple times in the gif.  Obviously, the people won't let the little fellow actually drown, but it hurts my insides to think the wee lil baby elephant is scared =("

babyelephantgifs,2hs66b,bunnnnnny,8,Tue Sep 30 00:32:13 2014 UTC,"Yep. Met a baby elephant in an Indian zoo once when I was young. It was playing happily in the dirt. We went near, and it decided it wanted to try blessing us like the temple elephants are taught to do, but it wasn't very good at it because it was a zoo elephant and hadn't really been trained at that, so instead it ended up sticking its wet trunk slightly down the back of my shirt and covering my neck with dirt. Dog noise x10 pretty much describes it.  P.S. At the time I was there, the baby elephant wasn't chained or anything, though I don't remember anything about the older elephants (it was a long time ago, and I was young enough to not yet know how elephants are often treated, so I can't tell whether or not that lack of memory means anything). I did go back and find the zoo website, but it was still inconclusive."

babyelephantgifs,2h6swa,carmichael561,25,Tue Sep 23 03:50:05 2014 UTC,Yes... They don't quite have the motor skills for trunk-drinking so they just smash their whole mouth in the water. I like to think it's for extra-adorableness and no other reason though.

babyelephantgifs,2h13ik,autowikibot,1 point,Mon Sep 22 21:26:59 2014 UTC,"Facial symmetry:       Facial symmetry is one specific measure of bodily asymmetry. Along with traits such as averageness and youthfulness it influences judgements of aesthetic traits of physical attractiveness and beauty.  It is also associated with health and genetic fitness.   Facial symmetry has been suggested as a possible physical manifestation of the 'big-five' personality traits.  For example, it is found that extraversion and openness are strongly associated with the symmetry of the face.  Hormones such as testosterone and estrogen are believed to be associated with developmental processes and growth of facial features during puberty and as a result are hypothesized to be the cause for individual differences in the implications associated with facial symmetry.  Facial bilateral symmetry is measured via fluctuating asymmetry of the face comparing random differences in facial features of the two sides of the face that develop and accumulate throughout one's lifetime as a result of stressors.

It's staked in and could easily be removed by an adult elephant, but since it held them when they were younger, they don't escape because they don't know they're strong enough to just pull it out of the ground now."

babyelephantgifs,2gnku5,majicpablo,13,Wed Sep 17 22:57:44 2014 UTC,"It's hardly a cage. It is a holding pen as the elephant is an orphan. However the pen contains a soft bed and a keeper spends 24 hours a day which includes sleeping in the pen with the elephant. The DSWT is one of the best places that an orphaned elephant can be. All of his needs are cared for until they are ready to be released back into the wild  Edit: the elephant also gets many trips out of the pen for exercise, socialization, mud baths, etc. It's an amazing organization to research if you are interested. http://www.sheldrickwildlifetrust.org/index.asp"

babyelephantgifs,2gjyhs,imtoojuicy,2,Tue Sep 16 20:08:17 2014 UTC,I imagine women would probably need quite a bit less maternity leave because the babies are more self-sufficient once they come out - and women continue to work while pregnant.

babyelephantgifs,2ggbph,imtoojuicy,3,Mon Sep 15 13:50:47 2014 UTC,"Maybe he is trying to convey through body language that he can be trusted. Hands folded behind his back may mean that he is left somewhat vulnerable, and that he completely trusts the person (or elephant, where applicable!) in front of him. Same thing with my parakeets. I would only gain their confidence when I'd let them do their thing, and not interfere with their actions. I'd let them come to me, if they felt like playing etc.   There might be other interpretations (like defensiveness, aggressiveness or untrustworthiness) to this gesture, but I think this one is appropriate here."

A little less than two weeks ago, my girlfriend of two and a half years left me. I was a mess. I decided to go on reddit to try and distract myself. This post not only made me smile, but actually made me laugh for a solid two minutes. Just the contrast between the crappiness of the rejection and the pure, goofy joy embodied in that gif had me giggling like an idiot. I know you and /u/love_the_heat create a lot of these gifs yourself, and that the source material isn't exactly easy to find either.

I follow the legislative efforts and write about ending the Ivory trade. And I sponsor two lovely little second chances growing up today in the DSWT nursery. Future moms I hope.

A few weeks ago, the BBC showed a documentary about the Sheldrick wildlife Trust and the founder/ main brain behind it, Dame Daphne. It was such a beautiful documentary about how the family raised orphan elephants and other animals in their own backyard. The star of the film was Aisha the orphan elephant calf who  the family struggled to keep alive. At that time, very little was known about elephant rearing and the formula needed etc. This of course made it extremely hard to take care of baby Aisha, who was deteriorating fast. the family persevered and somehow managed to save that calf's life. Aisha adopted Daphne as her mother and they were inseparable.  A day came when Daphne had to go out of town for her daughter's wedding for 10 days or so, and she entrusted Aisha's care to one of the trusted friends who had already been familiar with Aisha. Daphne left, and Aisha was heartbroken. She looked for her mother everywhere and was destroyed by the thought of losing another mother. The poor little calf was in consolable and stopped eating  and soon deteriorated quickly. Daphne cam back to a sick and dying Aisha. No matter what they did, Aisha couldnt have been saved. She died of grief.  Dame Daphne to this day holds herself responsible for Aisha's death. You can see and hear the heartbreak when you hear her talk. Aisha taught Daphne and all the caretakers around her exactly how to raise elephant calves. Today she runs an excellent organization to take care of the orphans that come in and later reintegrate them into the wild with the help  of an elepahnt mentor. They talke major steps to prevent any one calf fro, growing attached to a caretaker. But the love is more than evident.   I apologize if this is really long, bit learning about them was the biggest eye opener for me. You can foster a calf ( or any animal they have) or simply donate. They are really doing the best job.   TL;DR these people are amazing. http://www.sheldrickwildlifetrust.org/"

babyelephantgifs,2ga7hx,empirialest,6,Sat Sep 13 18:02:37 2014 UTC,Are they supposed to keep physical interaction to a minimum or something? I don't see them stroking the elephants very often.
babyelephantgifs,2ga7hx,empirialest,17,Sun Sep 14 00:49:14 2014 UTC,"Yes, and the keepers constantly rotate so that they aren't always looking after the same elephants. Daphne Sheldrick learned the hard way early on that separation anxiety can kill a baby elephant just as quickly as the wrong milk formula can, so the keepers rotate in order to prevent over-attachment. This includes rotating the elephants they sleep with as well."
babyelephantgifs,2ga7hx,mathonwy,2,Sun Sep 14 07:50:04 2014 UTC,That's fascinating. How can separation anxiety kill them?

babyelephantgifs,2gb4lf,holdenwook,39,Sat Sep 13 18:58:32 2014 UTC,"She was the smallest elephant I had ever seen ‚Äì still covered in the soft fuzz of elephant infancy, her tiny trunk tinged with pink, toenails of pale yellow ‚Äì soft and brand new. My heart sank. She had come from far-off Marsabit, having fallen down a disused well, and was sent to us because apparently we would know what to do and would be sure to keep her alive. I remember thinking: but we don‚Äôt, not one this young. We looked at the hind side of her ear, which I could see was as soft and pink as the petal of a flower, and I knew that this baby was younger than three weeks old. I stroked her head ‚Äì we had never managed to rear an elephant as young as this and with the death of each one, the sense of failure deepened. David often said that it might be kinder not to even try, to simply accept that the hand-rearing of infant milk-dependent elephants was impossible. But my conscience could not agree with this, for it would be even more distressing to hand out a death sentence without even trying. Nature intends elephants to live three score years and ten, the same as ourselves, and we would never turn a baby away for fear of failure. I knew I had to persevere.    -From Dame Daphne Sheldrick‚Äôs autobiography ‚ÄúLove, Life, and Elephants.‚Äù   Aisha was genesis for what would later become the David Sheldrick Wildlife Trust, and her story was given its own hour-long episode in the new PBS miniseries ‚ÄúMy Wild Affair.‚Äù I highly recommend it for anyone that enjoys our gifs here. Many of them are made from DSWT videos.   Ultimately Aisha did not live ‚Äì primarily due to the lack of a suitable milk formula for infant elephants at the time ‚Äì but her fight for survival laid the groundwork for the world-renowned Orphan‚Äôs Project that exists today."

babyelephantgifs,2gb4lf,Napping_Cosmos,2,Sun Sep 14 07:18:38 2014 UTC,"I read her autobiography and it was an amazing story. Currently, I am reading ""The last chain on Billie"" by Carol Bradley. Bradley talks about the hundreds of baby elephants taken from their mothers to be shipped back to America. However, she said they were sustained through goats milk or other milk like substitutes. This was in the early to mid 1900's, before Sheldrick began with elephants. The baby elephants seemed to live, I am just curious, does anyone know why goats milk did not work for Sheldrick's orphans but worked for the trainers?"

babyelephantgifs,2e2m6d,wbyte,4,Wed Aug 20 19:14:26 2014 UTC,"Ah yes, that looks like the answer. Maybe it's using its foot as leverage to pull the grass up better? Like a bottle opener, maybe?

babyelephantgifs,2e2m6d,Prosopagnosiape,4,Wed Aug 20 19:21:25 2014 UTC,"Perhaps! I'm not sure she'd need the leverage, their trunks are incredibly strong as well as very dexterous (able to pick a daisy without crushing it) I was just wondering if she was testing the length of the grass, like if she can feel it as she moves her foot over it's long enough to pick, I'm not sure how tough the soles of a zoo elephant's feet would be compared to a wild one walking on much harsher ground). All speculation though, I'd love to be able to ask."

babyelephantgifs,2e2m6d,opathak,3,Thu Aug 21 04:03:14 2014 UTC,Agree...Another regard where elephants have a human quality to them...having to learn how to use their body parts and not have all of them working by natural instinct from birth.

Introducing an adult male made all the difference in the world.

When elephants travelling with humans are away from home and staying too close to unfamiliar human settlements. The chains are for the peace of minds of the people living close by.

babyelephantgifs,2dv2dv,emgeowagg,11,Mon Aug 18 06:02:55 2014 UTC,"That's awesome! I just found out that International Elephant Foundation is one of Amazon's AmazonSmile charities. I made it my charity. For any of you not familiar, if you buy stuff through AmazonSmile, Amazon donates a small percent of what you buy to a chosen charity. There's no extra cost and as far as I can tell I pay the same amount as I would on Amazon. We use a Amazon a lot for my husband's business so I was happy to find this out.  Edit: They donate 0.5% of eligible purchases. Not sure what is ""eligible"" but I've made 3 orders since signing up for AmazonSmile and all 3 have been eligible.  Edit #2: Thank you kind sir/madam for the gold!"
babyelephantgifs,2dv2dv,patchworkgreen,3,Mon Aug 18 17:21:07 2014 UTC,"Thank you so much for posting this! The Sheldrick Trust is on there as well. If we all sign up then the donations would add up to a reasonable amount. There is a chrome app button thingy that makes sure you are on AmazonSmile and you just shop as usual. Such an easy way to donate because it doesn't cost you anything.   Hey, every little bit counts!"
babyelephantgifs,2dv2dv,emgeowagg,3,Wed Sep 10 22:47:29 2014 UTC,"Cool. Must have missed the Sheldrick Trust at first glance. I think I'll alternate between the IEF and the Sheldrick Trust.  We do use Amazon quite frequently (both personally and for business) and I think the tiny amount being donated each time will eventually add up to a decent amount.  This is such an easy (and free!) way to make money for these charities, wish more folks were aware of AmazonSmile."

babyelephantgifs,2dfk3k,Gregmire,23,Wed Aug 13 18:23:46 2014 UTC,That was my first thought until I realized even a newborn baby elephant probably weighs double what I do. I'd get my ass kicked adorably.

babyelephantgifs,2dfk3k,dolemite-,26,Wed Aug 13 22:03:02 2014 UTC,"That is a really good question. In the wild the adults make it a priority to shade the babies. They are always around them. Especially the mother. Constant dirt baths help with this as well. At the DSWT the keepers have found the blankets protect them in a similar way. A side note, the older elephants have learned to identify the new babies by the blankets and appear to react positively to them."

babyelephantgifs,2chxsy,Stinky_Eastwood,74,Sun Aug 3 15:20:11 2014 UTC,"Well, elephants don't ""smile"" like we do. They're a different species and their facial expressions don't mean the same as us. Like when people think a dog is smiling when it's just panting and we impose our own experiences on it.   But what does any of that matter? It's an adorable baby elephant munching on bananas. Even if his ""smile"" is just the way his face looks and means nothing about his emotional state, I'm sure he's fucking happy on the inside"
babyelephantgifs,2chxsy,sduncan91,21,Sun Aug 3 18:16:13 2014 UTC,"Well some dogs do smile.  Some relax their lips when happy or they pull them back a bit when excited.  Dogs can adapt their communication skills to interact with humans and if they find they get more attention from smiling than from play-bowing then they're going to keep smiling.  Dogs and cats for example have totally different ways of communicating but they can learn to get used to each other over time.  But if a dog pulls its teeth back all the way then yeah, you definitely should not try to pet it."

babyelephantgifs,2chxsy,CitizenPremier,6,Sun Aug 3 18:59:28 2014 UTC,I don't understand why peeling from the bottom is the right way.  It's more awkward to hold it that way.  And it's not like monkeys know some secret of bananas that we don't know--humans invented the modern banana.  Monkeys just shat out the seeds of some of the tastier wild bananas.
babyelephantgifs,2chxsy,Synikull,2,Sun Aug 3 15:16:31 2014 UTC,"The banana doesn't change shape;  it still fits in your hand the same way.  You're just conditioned to think one way is right and the other is wrong.  The up side to the monkey method is you dint get those bananas that don't open and toy turn the  top quartet to mush. Similarly,  you won't break the stem off and make it harder to open. It poems the same way with the same ease every time."
babyelephantgifs,2chxsy,CitizenPremier,2,Sun Aug 3 18:37:30 2014 UTC,The only time I had a hard time opening a banana from the top was when it wasn't ripe yet and tasted bad anyway.  It's all moot anyway as real men eat their bananas like this.
babyelephantgifs,2chxsy,CochinBrahmaLover,2,Sun Aug 3 18:57:59 2014 UTC,"When a banana is ripe it's a bitch to peel the top. It bends, and smooshes the top. For the bottom, all I do is pinch it and voila, banana unharmed ready to be eaten.  If the banana isn't ripe it'll be crunchier, so it should've opened fine, so were you tenderizing the bananas again?"
babyelephantgifs,2chxsy,Synikull,2,Sun Aug 3 19:02:24 2014 UTC,"Never successfully puked they off. Always end up turning banana to mush.  I like my banana just past ripe, and when then some of those fan stems WILL NOT OPEN."

babyelephantgifs,2chxsy,CochinBrahmaLover,2,Sun Aug 3 18:55:24 2014 UTC,"How is that not ripe? What is ripe? Brown? That's a perfectly ripe banana, it might need maybe another  day but that looks perfect.  And the riper they are the softer they are, so saying that when they're ripe you'll open them easier doesn't make any sense because the skin will be softer so it won't snap open, it'll usually just bend until you moosh the banana top."
