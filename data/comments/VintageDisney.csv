VintageDisney,3cdc1t,addisonborn,5,Tue Jul 7 00:55:40 2015 UTC,"Yesterday morning, we lost Blaine Gibson, an animator who worked on Fantasia, Bambi, Song of the South, Alice in Wonderland, Peter Pan, Sleeping Beauty, and One Hundred and One Dalmatians before Walt moved him into Imagineering following an art show displaying his sculptures in 1954.  From there, he designed sculptures and audio-animatronics for Walt Disney’s Enchanted Tiki Room, Great Moments with Mr. Lincoln, Pirates of the Caribbean, The Haunted Mansion, The Hall of Presidents, and many others.  In 1993, his ""Partners"" statue featuring Walt Disney and Mickey Mouse was placed in Disneyland, and is now featured in Disney parks worldwide.  Honestly, the man made so many classic Disney attractions what they are today, and was able to take sketches and concept art and turn them into the ""living and breathing"" characters we have in the parks worldwide."
VintageDisney,3cdc1t,sraynor,1 point,Tue Jul 7 01:00:57 2015 UTC,I am a faculty member in an Art Department and my colleague who recently retired (she was a portrait bust sculptor and taught our courses in it as well) was a big fan of his work.  She would always say to our students that anyone can sculpt a bust but the greats knew exactly how to capture the spirit of someone in clay.  Blaine clearly had that ability.

VintageDisney,3aw8j2,boopblep,2,Wed Jun 24 00:38:34 2015 UTC,I know they had a heavy history of accidents.  I've always assumed that is why Disney removed them from the park.
VintageDisney,3aw8j2,goforpoppapalpatine,2,Wed Jun 24 00:59:48 2015 UTC,"It was my understanding that the Disneyland Skyway was closed because it couldn't be made ADA compliant for any reasonable amount of money.   In theory, the Tomorrowland station would have been relatively easy to convert, compared to the Fantasyland station. A simple elevator would have done the trick in TL.  For those of us old enough to remember, the FL station had a meandering queue that snaked uphill with many small sets of concrete steps. There wasn't really a good (affordable) way to get a wheelchair up to the FL loading platform, without spending well over what the attraction itself cost, so the whole ride was scrapped.  A sad day indeed.   Kind of stupid, though. What was the point of compliance? Did they expect wheelchair-bound guests to disembark at the opposite station? That wouldn't have worked without a spare set of wheelchairs waiting for them on the other side.   Would they have preferred the wheelchair-bound guests bring the chair aboard a modified gondola?  It's unlikely they could have crammed  both the chair and another rider inside safely and kept the same outer dimensions of the gondola.   Maybe wheelchair riders would only have been allowed to do a round-trip?  Kinda lame, and it would have made the lines longer for no good reason.  It's too bad that compliance was required for this attraction. (If what I've been told is in fact true)"

You can find some pictures and info of the original monorail fleet and it looked vastly different.  They were only five cars, much smaller fleet at opening...It changed alot over the first decade.    We know this picture is before 1977, which is when Coral and Lime were brought online...So likely 1973-1977 is the actual time frame for this picture.

VintageDisney,375d2b,addisonborn,3,Mon May 25 00:47:48 2015 UTC,"My one thought review:  For a movie called Tomorrowland, it sure spent a lot of time in the present.  Two thought review:  Non-Disney fans don't care what's in the movie and will see it regardless, but Disney fans want to see the World's Fair and Tomorrowland. Also, the whole ""interrupting each other"" intro thing was so obviously shot after they already began editing and needed to ""family friendly"" it up a bit.  Solid family friendly sci-fi adventure movie, but no meat."
VintageDisney,375d2b,YITredMR,2,Fri May 29 19:24:53 2015 UTC,"I'm assuming spoilers are a given, but fair warning:  I was a bit disappointed after attending D23's Attraction Rewind Expo in November and seeing the Tomorrowland teaser/presentation.  I could have been expecting more due to the lead-in that we received that day, but I felt like most trailers gave hints at more involvement of the World's Fair, Plus Ultra, and Tomorrowland itself, but there didn't seem to be much focus on them in the actual film.  Outside of George Clooney's character development very early on, there wasn't much discussion of the '64 World's Fair.    The leaked trailer from Asia included more dialogue between the store clerks and Casey on the role Walt had in Plus Ultra and how the park was a model for something bigger, but that also wasn't in the theatre release of the film.  There was also some of the Youtube trailers/videos on ""Stop Plus Ultra"" that led me to believe it would focus more on that.  Again, I wish it had focused more on Walt's supposed role in Plus Ultra and setting up the transport inside It's A Small World.  I enjoyed the Optimist idea and the overall idea of optimism overpowering pessimism, and I enjoyed the Easter eggs of Space Mountain, Spaceship Earth, and Progress City/EPCOT (the overall tower/model of the main city), but I wish it had included more.  I'm admittedly an amateur Disney historian, so I probably don't fit the typical moviegoer demographic when it comes to their target audience.  I'll read the prequel to see how it builds upon the story.  I'll buy the film when it comes out and I'll watch it again, but I feel like there was more build up to it than what was delivered.  I liked it, but not as much as I had hoped I would."

I'm just gonna go ahead and nitpick, because there were sooo many questions and problems.   When the evil animatronics track Casey down to Frank's house, they tell him they're acting ""by order of Governor Nix"" and demand he hand Casey over, implying she's a known wanted fugitive. But when they get to Tomorrowland, Nix has no idea who Casey is. When she tells him, he doesn't bat an eye. What was the function of the animatronics in the nerd memorabilia store? Were they evil? Why? Were they working for Nix? What was their job and deal? Why would you program all animatronics to automatically self-destruct if they sustain even a tiny amount of damage? We see Athena has to manually turn her self-destruct sequence off when she gets what amounts to a scrape on the arm for her. That serves no purpose. If you're sending them to our world, how would it help them blend in if they're exploding or exposing their circuitry to stop themselves from exploding whenever they stub their toe? And if they're in Tomorrowland, why do you need them to self-destruct? And on the subject of self-destruct, why does the head evil animatronic not self-destruct when Casey smashes his face in with a bat? He's obviously very injured and as we've seen, even animatronics who are injured but still able to function will self-destruct if they're unable to shut down the sequence. I assume he turned it off when Casey and Frank weren't looking? How does building this utopia in another dimension help us in the real world? My guess is that it doesn't; the Tomorrowland visionaries just claim it does to get people on board. So Nix and his ilk kind of hand picked who got to be saved by going to Tomorrowland and who was left on Earth dimension C-137 or whatever to rot. That's not good, right? I'm pretty sure Frank doesn't like that idea. Except at the end, he still is hand-picking who gets to come to Tomorrowland. He just adjusted the criteria from ""geniuses"" to ""dreamers.""   I had a huge question about why Frank got kicked out of Tomorrowland, but I guess I missed the part where it was because he ""lost hope."" Oh. Okay.  I mean, I didn't hate it. But I absolutely love Tomorrowland, Epcot, Progress City, etc, and I really wish we could have had a movie that explored the implications, both good and bad, of these concepts. What does it mean when you only let certain people into a place like that? How do you make it work? What kind of problems will you run into and how will you solve them? Instead we get a two hour chase scene and ten minutes of ""oo look shiny."""

Although, I will add, what little there was for us to do there, my seven year old daughter LOVED. I just remember it being such an open and vibrant floor plan. It looked dark and not necessarily inviting during my latest visit. I think if Disney went back to a more open floor plan, it wouldn't take earth shattering activities to divert the crowds as they make their way through."

VintageDisney,32e56e,YITredMR,6,Mon Apr 13 04:16:11 2015 UTC,I think you could physically double the size of the Magic Kingdom and it would still feel crowded.
VintageDisney,32e56e,TheDeluge1,3,Mon Apr 13 11:45:47 2015 UTC,"It has a lot to do with the original layout and traffic management of the park. The 1969 to 1971 design mentalities that went into the creation of the park unfortunately left over way too many spots where pedestrian traffic congests due to the crowd levels which MK handles nowadays. These include areas like the main thoroughfare into Tomorrowland from the hub, the Fantasyland corridor where Small World and Peter Pan are parallel to each other (that is one hell of a place to navigate) and the spot adjacent to the SFTH in Adventureland.   Some of these can be solved. The Tomorrowland thoroughfare for example, is caused partially by the queues for attractions such as Stitch's Great Escape and Laugh Floor spilling out into the main corridor. With more adequate queue space (not too hard to achieve), that one area of the park might clear up immensely."
VintageDisney,328alx,sraynor,4,Sat Apr 11 13:58:02 2015 UTC,"I used to work Mission to Mars.  It was more fun than you'd imagine.  There were only two operators for the whole thing - one outside and one inside (this is probably still the case with the Stitch thing).  The inside operator had no room for unexpected delays.  There was a very time-sensitive flow to the whole thing.  You would:  1)  Talk the guests into the pre-show area, give brief spiel.  Then the pre-show would start.  2)  Run over to Rocket #1, where the previous pre-show viewers are now (hopefully) more or less seated and situated.  Give brief spiel and their show would start.  3)  Run back to the pre-show, as you have a couple of dialog lines with Mr. Johnson in the middle of the pre-show.  If you didn't make it in time for your lines due to loading issues in Rocket #1, a pre-recorded spiel with a very annoying female voice would play in your absence.  Holding down the mike button would prevent the pre-recorded lines from playing.  4)  The show in Rocket #2 is ending now.  Sneak in and pretend you were there with them the whole time.  When the show ends and the lights come on, give brief spiel and talk them out.  5)  Run back to the pre-show, where the pre-show is ending.  Talk the guests leaving the pre-show into Rocket #2.  6)  New guests are arriving in the pre-show just as the previous pre-show guests are heading to their rocket.  Repeat all steps (alternating rocket numbers) until ""bumped"" to the outside position by a reliever.  Time went by very quickly.  One of the favorite gags was, when relieving someone from this position, to sneak up when they are about to give their mid-pre-show lines, and unplug the mike so that the pre-recorded lines would play instead of their voice.  The spotlight would still be on them, but they would appear to be lip-syncing the pre-recorded lines instead.  Particularly funny if the operator being relieved was male.  My other two favorite rides to work were 20K and Space Mountain."

VintageDisney,316xoy,Jonny_Fairplay,2,Fri Apr 3 03:44:02 2015 UTC,"Horizons (Epcot):       Horizons was the name of a dark ride attraction at Epcot (then known as EPCOT Center), a theme park at Walt Disney World in Bay Lake, Florida. Located on the eastern side of the ""Future World"" section of Epcot, the attraction used Disney's Omnimover conveyance system, which took guests past show scenes depicting visions of the future. It is believed to be the sequel to Walt Disney's Carousel of Progress, an attraction in Tomorrowland at Walt Disney World's Magic Kingdom. Horizons was the only attraction in ""Future World"" to showcase all of Epcot's ""Future World"" elements: communication, community interaction, energy, transportation, anatomy, physiology, along with man's relationship to the sea, land, air, and space. The attraction officially opened on October 1, 1983, as part of Phase II of Epcot. Horizons originally closed in December 1994, a little more than a year after General Electric had ended its sponsorship of the attraction. Horizons temporarily re-opened in December 1995 due to the closure of two other attractions that were down for refurbishment in ""Future World"", Universe of Energy and World of Motion. The attraction permanently closed on January 9, 1999, after which the attraction was dismantled and its structure demolished to make room for Mission: SPACE, a motion simulator thrill ride that opened on October 9, 2003.

VintageDisney,2zjrj0,torrentialhavok,14,Thu Mar 19 03:33:21 2015 UTC,"Some History, notes & corrections:  NOTE: These are likely 1974/5 as that is the last time the water feature was running regularly at the entrance to Tomorrowland and the back end of Tomorrowland is closed, prior to the opening of a few rides (mentioned later). It is also after the 'Richard F. Irvine' Riverboat began service.   Picture 1: That is the original Ferry (with the old 'short' dock) from TTC to MK. Picture 2: Taken on Main Street near the Ice Cream shop (Across from Casey's) and next to the original entrance to the Swan Boat ride around the moat. Picture 3: Shot from the Ferry just before getting to the MK dock. In the background is Space Mountain before it was open to the public. Picture 4: The first boat was originally called the 'Admiral Joe Fowler'. In this photo, it is the second boat: the 'Richard F. Irvine'. (Look closely at the name tag at the top). Both original Riverboats were wooden, but the 'Richard F. Irvine' was rebuilt in the 1990s using aluminum and renamed ""Liberty Belle'. The 'Admiral Joe Fowler' was damaged in a dry-dock incident and scrapped. Now, these 2 names adorn the boats from the TTC. Picture 5: Shot from the 'porch' of the Starlight Cafe. (This area is now fully enclosed) The old Swan Boat dock is seen in the background with closed umbrellas over tables. Also, not seen in this photo: The Tomorrowland Terrace is still not completed. In fact, until this and the rest of Tomorrowland are completed, the Utilidors were still not a full loop. Picture 6: This photo is a triple exposure of the Frontierland Train Station (Now gone and Splash Mountain is in its place), The Jungle Cruise's Schweizer Falls, and Cinderella Castle. (The glory days of real film when people forgot to advance the film to the next unexposed area)  EDIT: I could be wrong about the Train Station. Upon further review, It may only be a double-exposure. That could be, instead, the area between the Winnie The Pooh ride and Tomorrowland's Starlight Cafe looking to the castle. Picture 7: Yes, the TTC just to the left of the exit for the Monorail to MK. This area now houses a coffee booth. (You can also see the castle on the far left, in the background.) Picture 8: This photo is in reverse. (Notice the words for It's A Small World are backwards?) 2 second color correction and rotation: http://i.imgur.com/NK1QPDe.jpg Picture 9: Not much has changed here. 2 second color correction:  http://i.imgur.com/Fr6cvNG.jpg Picture 10: Imagine getting Snow White and all 7 Dwarves for a photo op like this today! Never happen. 2 second color correction: http://i.imgur.com/XRipQXq.jpg Picture 11: Notice the stage, as we currently know it, is non-existant. They used to do the shows right at ground level. Picture 12: This photo is also in reverse. Here is the correct angle: http://i.imgur.com/fmtHkxs.jpg  It's in the Adventureland area Picture 13: This is not them waiting FOR the boat, but waiting ON the boat. It's the ferry at the TTC before departure to MK. Picture 14: The clock shop is now the Glass Shop (where my friend Charlie works.) Picture 15:  This is on the Mark Twain Riverboat tour. There used to be more indians on the tour, but they broke down, one by one, and were not replaced. That area now has lots of holes in the ground where the support beams and air hoses were housed for each item.  This area and the next one featuring American Indians, as well as the 'story' you hear, were changed to be more sympathetic in later years. Also lost in time: The burning cabin. Picture 16: Not much to say here as it has barely changed...except for the lack of the ticket turnstiles (now the Magic Band Scanning area) which would come later. Picture 17: This is taken from the Ferry to MK towards (obviously) the Contemporary Resort. At the time of this photo, this and the Polynesian were the only resorts open. Well, besides the Ft Wilderness campgrounds. The Grand Floridian would not open until 1988. Picture 18: Not much to say, except that the 'Population' on the sign appears to be in the low millions. Picture 19: This is the original entrance to Tomorrowland. Notice the falling water? That became an issue for Guests, soon after, and had to be stopped. You would get drenched walking by them on a windy day.  Also, notice that orange wall in the background? That is the back of Tomorrowland, still unfinished. It would not be until 1975 that that area would be open and include the WEDWAY People Mover, The Carousel of Progress, and Space Mountain. At the time of this photo, only 2 rides existed in Tomorrowland: Mission To The Moon (later Mission To Mars and now Stitch) and If You Had Wings (now Buzz Lightyear) Picture 20: Taken from Tom Sawyer Island, this would be the 'Richard F. Irvine'. Picture 21: 20,000 Leagues used to have water falling from the top of that tunnel, but since these were not real subs (like the ones at Disneyland) the water would fill the boat. After this photo, they came up with a way to have the water fall on either side of the boat, but not directly on it. 2 second color correction and rotation: http://i.imgur.com/I99Q9YA.jpg Picture 22: Ferry coming in from the TTC to MK. Picture 23: Main Street, in front of Casey's, looking down to the Station. Picture 24: This appears to be the area on the west side of the HUB and in the top left (not visible) would be the entrance to Adventureland. Picture 25: On the bridge into Liberty Square. Picture 26: On the ferry from MK back to the TTC. Picture 27: A daily ceremony used to be held in Liberty Square called ""The Sons and Daughters of Liberty."" It involved a fife and drum corps marching in Revolutionary-era costuming. After marching, they would stop and make decrees and hand out copies of the Declaration of Independence. EDIT: It appears this still happens at Disneyland:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sh_ylkVMSNg Picture 28: I miss this ride so much.  Picture 29: Why are pooh's eyes red? I never got an answer for this. It freaked me out as a kid in the 1970s.   Hope this was helpful!"

Imagine if this year - only a few years after the typhoon that wrecked havoc upon Japan's Fukushima Prefecture causing over 1,800 deaths - the Walt Disney Co. publicly expressed their sympathy for ""all of the ghosts that had been displaced from their ancestral homes"" due to the typhoon and subsequent nuclear power plant meltdown, then immediately began talking about a new theme park ride they had in the works that would serve as a 'retirement home' for the ""homeless spirits.""  How do you think that would play with the public? With yourself?  Walt's words here were a tacky and insensitive sales pitch. Unintentionally tacky and insensitive? Yes. Definitely.

VintageDisney,2yk9f8,Limey_Man,8,Tue Mar 10 20:27:06 2015 UTC,This is a complex story...It was removed to make way for Winnie the Pooh.  The reasons?  I'm guessing that Winnie sells a lot more merchandise than our friend Mr. Toad.

From my limited research, there are several different coin types. The opening day coin given only to cast members said 'The Dawn of A New Disney Era' on one side with 'Epcot' on the back.  The one you posted a picture of is not the same as mine, which has the same logo and Spaceship Earth, but also has trees and the monorail around it.  A lot of them were released so they aren't exactly rare. A number of 99% silver ones were released which are very valuable but likely also in collectors cabinets ;)  If you do a quick Google Search for ""epcot commemorative coin"" there's a ton of information on the coins.   In a nutshell though, if it's not one of the few 99% silver ones, it's not rare and not worth much. They are pretty cool collectors items though :)"

I practically grew up at WDW but I was born in the 80s so I obviously missed the old ticketing method. How did it work before the current system where one ticket gets you inside the park and all rides are free? Did you still have to pay to get in or was it free and then you payed for each attraction?

They've only put out a few of them on those old Disney Treasures sets, but there's so many great episodes like this that have been completely ignored.  I mean, the weirdness of Kurt Russell hanging out with the Osmond brothers at Disneyland, then Donnie getting lost, E.J. Peaker singing a melancholy song in Tomorrowland, the Osmonds singing a song from HAIR, and finally, the strangest bit of it all – Kurt Russell singing ""Sugar, Sugar"" at Carnation Plaza Gardens. Holy cow.  And of course, the best, and most important thing of all is we get to see some great vintage footage of the park as it was in 1969 and the making of one of the greatest dark rides of all time.  I just don't understand why Disney doesn't put out DVDs of this stuff. Even if they just sold them in the parks, or made them as DVD-Rs on demand like the Warner Archive, I'm certain there's a market for this kind of stuff."

VintageDisney,2wk6uh,downbeat,2,Fri Feb 20 16:30:35 2015 UTC,"You know, aside from a way classier entrance, the overall plan didn't change all that much.  What's most interesting to me is how little of it was original vs. re-purposed concepts from Disney's America and Westcot.    For example -- the aviation, pier amusement park, farm, and rapids concepts were taken from America: http://disneyandmore.blogspot.com/2008/03/disneys-america-theme-park-project.html  Almost all of America ended up in other projects actually.  The parts that didn't make it into DCA went to Tokyo Sea.   And even the spire of the Sun in the entrance was lifted from the far more impressive centerpiece of Westcost seen here : http://guyselga.com/images/westcot2_rendering.jpg  Always find it neat to see where these things end up! :)"

VintageDisney,2wk024,YITredMR,2,Fri Feb 20 15:37:25 2015 UTC,"This is one of many great Disney tribute videos from Martin Smith -- you can see them all here: http://www.martinsvids.net/  Martin is a pro and does a ton of research, everything you see in his videos is super accurate.   On the topic of the '99 Journey Into (Your) Imagination -- I must say, as 15+ years have passed since the redo, I think the original ""Your Imagination"" redo  would have held up better than what is there today and is overall a better ride (though obviously not even close to the original classic!).  They got rid of a lot to re-add Figment back into the story.  I feel like they could have retained a lot of these segments while still adding him back/removing the insulting vibe.   Interesting to look back and see how much changed from those two iterations."
VintageDisney,2wk024,ryanchapelle,1 point,Fri Feb 20 20:13:15 2015 UTC,"I found this on YouTube and thought folks might find it interesting.

VintageDisney,2wk024,team0bliterate,3,Fri Feb 20 15:39:35 2015 UTC,"This guy has definitely done his homework. He has a 45 minute video about the original setup for the ride, as well as Imageworks, and man did it hit me right in the feels. My daughter is getting ready for her first trip in April, and when she saw the original Imageworks set up with the Rainbow Corridor, she was in awe. She was most disappointed when I told her that it wasn't working anymore. But I digress....  As far as the first video goes, someone posted it yesterday in this subreddit. He sourced and credited the work in that video (in the end credits).  I believe the information in the video, and don't see a reason for anyone to doubt the veracity of either one. Thanks for posting this!  P.S.--I've said it before, and I'll say it again: if I ever win the Powerball, I'll be making a call with a 100+ million dollar offer to Disney to put this back the way it was. With 31+ years of technological advancement, I think the ride could work the way it was originally intended."

VintageDisney,2vvxto,Foxo103,3,Sat Feb 14 17:15:05 2015 UTC,"I've only ever really used eBay, although being in the UK it's often hard to get stuff without extortionate shipping costs and risks of breakage.   I've picked up a few old bits and pieces, mostly Epcot stuff. I've got some old license plates (one promoting the upcoming opening of MGM Studios in 1989, and another for the WDW 20th Anniversary).  My dad's into it as well and has built up one of the largest collections of Disney camera straps, including about 5 of the original Epcot ones (ultra rare these days!).  I've seen a few items on Etsy too, but never bought from there myself."
VintageDisney,2vvxto,confusedpurple,3,Sat Feb 14 18:27:03 2015 UTC,"Garage sales, flea markets, and estate sales are great resources if you have the time to search in person.  Considering that Disney merchandise has been around since the late 1920s, there's obviously lots of stuff out there to find.  eBay, of course.  Disneyana has an online presence, and the fan club does an annual sale and expo.  There is so much Disney related memorabilia that it really can be found all over if you take the time to look.  If you limit yourself to park specific items, it gets much tougher unless you live near the park."
VintageDisney,2vvxto,reviewerx,2,Sat Feb 14 18:28:55 2015 UTC,"This! I found a pre-war Mickey Mouse children's toolbox at a garage sale and bought it and an old chalk tin for 25 cents. I was not into Disney at the time and sold it on ebay for 120 dollars (condition was not the greatest). That's another thing. While you are learning the value of items its best to stick to the areas reviewerx suggested. So even if you spend too much its usually not more than 20 bucks too much.   Now I scour the garage sales for park related items. We have found little stuff like magnets, unopened Mickey hands, Sorcerers apprentice stocking, Early 70 Mickey plush/dolls (with pull string)and even droid parts from the build your own droid stuff in Hollywood studios.  People go, buy their kids stuff and then the kids loose interest and they dump it in the garage sale."

You can pick one up in great shape for under $15 on Ebay here - http://www.ebay.com/itm/1977-Walt-Disneys-Disneyland-Pictorial-Souvenir-Book-Space-Mountain-Frontierland-/111576946351  These books are one of my favorite things to collect as there's been a ton of them since the park opened in '55 (and for WDW too).  Really fun seeing how the park has been promoted over the years.

VintageDisney,2smnmg,drayca,3,Fri Jan 16 21:11:36 2015 UTC,"I know she wasn't in charge of anything at WDW, but when the ride changed over it felt very Cynthia Harris-ish, I guess is the best way to describe it. Change for the purpose of changing it. Maelstrom is changing to meet with an actual demand (to Frozen), while Imagination needed no sort of change over. Ride attendance was still high (it had a huge ride capacity and was like the 4th highest attended ride when it was open). They simply wanted to modernize it, tie it in with Honey, I Shrunk the Audience and the first change didn't even have Figment. The ride technically had two updates after that, and it's an OK ride now, but man, it was something else."
VintageDisney,2smnmg,CoffeeJedi,2,Fri Jan 16 21:16:49 2015 UTC,"Journey Into Imagination was like the purest form of dark ride Imagineering distilled into a single attraction. Amazing special effects, a great song, memorable characters, and some impressive mechanical engineering (that first scene of Dreamfinder creating Figment was actually on a massive turntable synced to the ride's movement!) Sadly a video could never quite capture the feeling of being on it. Because the theme was literally ""imagination,"" they were free to really stretch their creative muscle and create something magical."

The old game room was huge. It was awesome. We used to play ticket games for bouncy balls and go up to the 15th floor and throw them off the edge.   They used to have cool playground stuff out back that fit into the whole atmosphere. It was those kind of details that has made me love Contemporary since I can remember and I find lacking nowadays."

It starts out with a brief but interesting history of airplanes, starting with the Wright Brothers' first flight in Kittyhawk. We see aviation being explored by various nations for various purposes and then airplanes put to limited use in World War I, followed by a series of successes in flight, before finally moving on to World War II. The film talks about the history of Major de Seversky, who later explains about how the advent of aircraft spells change in the face of traditional warfare. It then goes on to explain how the Allies chose not to embrace the use of air power and instead, used old-fashioned methods of warfare to battle the Axis powers, who used aircraft to do their dirty work. The point the film makes is that the only way for the Allies to secure victory over the robust Axis is to make heavy use of military aviation, because, as we're told, fighting on the surface puts the advantage in the hands of Adolf Hitler. Training Shorts Four Methods of Flush Riveting: This film, produced under the direction of the Lockheed Aircraft Corporation, a neighbor of the Disney studios, uses cheap, quick animation diagrams to provide the lowdown on flush riveting. Stop That Tank: This film, made for Canada, begins with an interesting cartoon showing Hitler (depicted as a ranting madman speaking in phony German) and an armada of tanks trying to invade a peaceful-looking village, only to be fought off by a barrage of gunfire from anti-tank guns, so much so that it sends Hitler to Hell. The rest of this short is a dry and technical explanation and description of the Boys Anti-Tank Rifle. Just like the previous short, animation is limited. Training Film Montage: Narrated by Maltin, this segment contains various clips from the many training films Disney made for the military, including one film that was restricted, because it contained formulas to mix a glue that could be used to create weather-sealed patches on wooden airplanes. This film contains a wide spectrum of instructional films and Maltin also describes the different animation methods used for these works. Bonus Features On the Set of *Victory Through Air Power_: This film contains rare behind-the-scene footage of the 1943 film. __Victory Through Air Power* Trailer_: A look at how this film was promoted to audiences. Galleries Production Art Gallery: This gallery depicts art from many of the cartoons on the first disc. They are all a blend of black and white sketches, color sketches and background paintings. __Victory Through Air Power* Gallery_: A lot of images, divided into four sections (Visual Development, Story, Backgrounds and Publicity), are depicted. __The Gremlins* Gallery_: A few images on an interesting collaboration between Walt Disney and children's author Roald Dahl. Dahl's first book was to be the first adapted into a feature film, too. But the project was scrapped after Dahl was disappointed by the conceptual artwork and Walt Disney couldn't secure copyrights to the term ""Gremlins"". Poster Gallery: Various attention-grabbing messages depicted on posters in this gallery. Dispatches From Disney's: A disregarded publication. Joe Grant's Sketchbook: Artwork from the Disney character designer and animator. Insignia Gallery: Various Disney insignias and logos used for the war effort. A Conversation With John Hench: Maltin meets with the longest-term Disney employee, who discusses how after the attack on Pearl Harbor, the Burbank studio was instantly turned into a base for the military. A Conversation With Joe Grant: Maltin meets with the longtime Disney animator and storyman, who compares the modern American terror situation to World War II. Grant discusses the changes he saw at the Disney studio once uniformed men showed up. He also lends some insight to the shorts Der Fuehrer's Face, The New Spirit, Education For Death, Reason and Emotion and Victory Through Air Power. He also touches upon the subject of working with Dick Huemer. A Conversation With Roy Disney: Walt's nephew recalls his boyhood memories of the Disney studio during the war and also touches on the Disney insignia's popularity and his own method of promoting Victory Through Air Power.

In fact, if you listen to the opening narration of the 1953 film, it is stated that, ""All this has happened before, and it will all happen again. But this time, it happened in London. It happened on a quiet street in Bloomsbury. That corner house over there is the home of the Darling family...""   Here's an image of a flat located in the area.   I hope this helps!"

VintageDisney,2mb6qn,MrPeabodyWABAC,3,Fri Nov 14 19:18:36 2014 UTC,"""Chilling, Thrilling Sounds of the Haunted House"" is a novelty record composed mainly of sound effects from the sound effects department at Walt Disney Studios. Some of the sound effects on this album were later used in The Haunted Mansion ride. The first side contains ten ""stories in sound"" narrated by Laura Olsher, and these tracks are the ones covered by Phish.  How does a band cover a sound effects album? The cover of the original record encourages listeners to create ""sound stories of their own using the effects on [the] LP plus others which you may do yourselves"". Phish has done exactly that, using the narration as a springboard to instrumental jams themed to the ""stories in sound"". The Disney sound effects are sampled all throughout the set, controlled by the keyboardist from his rig.  If you don't want to listen to the entire set (though I highly recommend you do!), the songs ""Your Pet Cat"", ""The Birds"", and ""Martian Monster"" prominently feature the Disney sound effects and contain many of the set's musical highlights. The concert video has links to each song in the description. The set takes place on a graveyard set. The band is not seen until the end of ""The Very Long Fuse"", when the haunted house prop bursts open to reveal the band in white tuxedoes and zombie face paint."

VintageDisney,2h7doh,ManofAnger,1 point,Tue Sep 23 16:31:28 2014 UTC,"Same. Unfortunately my cynical mind says that all of these ideas were more of a play to see what kind of deals they could cut, and not all of them would have made it to the final park. They were running this at the same time as they were pitching Port Disney in Long Beach (from which they got a lot of material for DisneySea in Tokyo), as well as Disney's America in Virginia. They could play different subsidies granted from different locations against each other, but ultimately, they had to scrap everything because EuroDisney/Disneyland Paris was having extreme financial troubles and the money was needed to keep that park operating."
VintageDisney,2h7doh,autowikibot,2,Tue Sep 23 21:36:59 2014 UTC,"Port Disney:       Port Disney was a planned property of The Walt Disney Company that was to have been built in Long Beach, California, United States. The property was to have featured a marine-themed theme park, a marina, a cruise ship port, a specialty retail and entertainment area, and hotel accommodations. It was also to have incorporated the RMS Queen Mary and Spruce Goose, which Disney acquired as a result of acquiring the Wrather company in 1989.  Port Disney was announced in 1991 via a publication called ""The Port Disney News"". The project was canceled amid financial constraints which also brought down the planned WestCOT theme park in Anaheim. Some elements of the theme park that was to have been built at Port Disney were incorporated into Tokyo DisneySea.

Here's a copy/paste of the wall of text  At an early 1994 NFFC convention Tony Baxter described the plans for WestCOT. Here are some excerpts: ..I'm going to explain a little bit about this. [The] two major changes in this park [are] different from anything Disney's ever done: one is that you're actually going to be able to spend the night in a Disney park. Walt had always talked about EPCOT in Florida being a place where you could live a life you couldn't find anywhere else. Now it's never been feasable for us to do that in a long term way but when we started WesCOT we said to ourselves ""Could we find a way where [guests] are not just looking at he France Pavilion or the Japanese Pavilion but actually saying ""That's where I want to stay"" and having that be your headquarters for your whole visit to Disneyland.   That's half of [WesCOT]. The other half is the Future World pavilions, where we're actually creating a role where the guests will be able to step on stage into a role in tomorrow and it's going to be a lot more participatory, a lot more theatrical. So you won't have those big pavilions that we have in Florida but once you step inside our theater and walk from the audience side onto the stages of Land, Living and Science, we'll ask a little bit more of you. It's sort of like what we did in Toon Town with fun but in WestCOT we're going to do it with some powerful thinking. . . Pardon me if I'm a little parched today. I just came back from a company thing that was in Aspen and there's no humidity there. It's also gorgeous and I now know why Micheal [Eisner] talks about the ""Montana Future"" when he tells us how are we going to redo Tomorrowland. We've been struggling with that as you all know. Maybe we can talk about [that] when we get done with this [presentation].  . . I'm going to show you some of the slides that made up [the] presentation. They're different from anything I've shown you in the past in that most of the things I show you we are probably going to build it exactly as you see it, but this is so far out that things are probably going to change again and again. . . . So with that in mind I''ll just go through this slide show that I've put together here.   [Slide #1] This is the first glamor shot. . . . Generally, you can get the lay-out. This area here, a center court area, is shared by both Disneyland and WestCOT. You will either approach it from Harbor Boulevard on a shuttle system from the parking garages or you will come from L.A. and park over in the strawberry field and come on a shuttle to this area. You won't believe how much work it was to get people to start thinking of the strawberry field as a parking lot instead of a second gate. The parking lot at Disneyland is absolutely the most spectacular piece of property in the center of Anaheim with the hotels, the convention center and so forth all around. We had to use that for the park.   We put America here at the beginning of the experience because it's linked to Disneyland with the train station and Main Street being Walt's symbolic gesture to the heart of America. The entrance [to America] would be similar to the Centenniel Fair in Philedelphia (sp?) a hundred and so years ago. The grand promenade and interior space woud be the gateway to the Americas with South America and Mexico on this side and Canada over to the left and America itself with the American Adventure show in the middle. And then we go on to Europe and Africa and then Future World sits across the lake and looks out across to the Greek amplitheater that faces straight on.   [Slide #2] This gives you an idea of the other portions of the project. You can see the parking garages here and over here and then the shuttle system will take you up to the center court. The ticketing will be exactly perpendicular to the way it is now. So won't face Disneyland the way you do now. You'll come in from the side and choose whether you want to go to WestCOT or to Disneyland. . . . When we first put the two park entrances together they didn't fit and so we said ""Wait a minute, let's make one continuum from the hub at Disneyland down through town square, the rail road station the monorail, that will become part of this and then the gateway to WesCOT and then the lake looking directly out to the icons. So the castle an the icons are all in one continuum. I would ge that most people would combine tickets here.   In Florida it's not as prevelant because to get from one park to another it's about a 2-hour experience but here literally the distance between Pirates of the Caribbean and Alfredo's Italian restaurant is closer than if you were in EPCOT standing at the Seas Pavilion and walking down to the Italian restaurant. So we think that people will probably see this all as one. So it puts a lot more emphasis on town square and what we do out in front--you can see some new buildings in here--and the exploration of where would the turn styles be. Would they be where they are now or would we put them in town square so we could get some double use out of this activity? I think we're leaning toward leaving them where they are but the ticket booths will be moved, so there's 4 elements depending on where you come in from. But this would be kind of a free space with souvenirs and some food that would be open to both groups of people going to either Disneyland or WestCOT. The morning start up entertainment could also be shared by both groups.   . . These are the other resort hotels that stretch all the way down to Katella. Those themes have not been settled on yet but the Disneyland Hotel will be one of them, there'll be a new luxury hotel at the front and a more moderately priced hotel down by The Emerald (I think that's what they're calling it now).  We're going to talk primarily today about the park. . . . First off, West Street will become Disneyland Drive. If you were driving down or strolling down you will not see these parking garages, those will be hidden from your view. But what you will see are facades that line the street. This will be a European facade with a port a cachere (sp?) and a drive where you would come in (if you were staying there), drop of your luggage and then park your car here. The hotel rooms for Europe stretch all the way out to Canada, which is in The Americas and on down to Greece and Rome on the opposite side. Next is the entrance to Asia. It's an Indian-like palace that stretches up into China and Japan on one side and out to SE Asia on the other end. Next--it probably won't make it for openning day--is a grand Egyptian palace-- stretching over into the Middle East. We're probably only going to open with a boat ride and some middle African attractions in this aea. Future World is the large structure here and South America and Mexico have the largest show buildings without hotels in them because we have a population that we feel we ought to do something quite dramatic for.  . . Now we're going to go into the Americas.   [slide #3] This is the promenade inside the grand hall at front of The Americas, so you've just stepped in from the common space between Disneyland and WestCOT. This would be a place where we could recap all the souvenirs that would be found throughout the realms that you're going to visit, so it's sort of like an emporium. It's also the gateway and entrance to the American Adventure show, which is similar to the one in Florida but will be updated because we are not talking about openning this tomorrow, we're talking about 7 or 8 years from now.  Directly beyond the opening at the far end is the gateway to the lake area and across the lake you'll see the spiral with the earth in it which is the gateway to Future World.  [Slide #4] This is looking back at the area we just came out of. It's sort of a melting pot of America: it looks much like New York might have looked a hundred years ago when you arrived from a foreign country. We wanted to symbolize this melting pot area; our country is made up of all the differences and diversities of all the other cultures around the world. On one side is Canada. We're going to have a Native American show that will probably be done similar to the Spirit Lodge that was done up in Vancouver [since this presentation was made the Spirit Lodge was relocated to Knott's Berry Farm]. It was done by Bob Rogers Productions, which has worked very closely with Disney on a lot of projects. On the other side is Mexico and South America. We're going to do an indoor Blue Bayou-like space where there will be a feista going on all the time. There will be several rides for children, a dark ride and what would normally be outdoor thrill rides but they'll be indoors to keep this feeling of a night time fiesta going on day in and day out. There will be restaurant facilities in there too and then at night we'll be doing a [??????] fiesta in this area  [slide #5]. In Florida it's just a restaurant with a placid lake so we're going to dramatically bring that to life. In the other area is the Aztec and Incan cultures in South America and Mexico and we'll have a very mystic show about the spirits and legends of South America and Mexico. There will also be native dancing on the outside in front of that space."
VintageDisney,2h7doh,WaffleSandwhiches,1 point,Tue Sep 23 16:17:09 2014 UTC,"[contd.]  [Slide #6] Now the promo film for WestCOT talked about World Cruise. It's the longest ride we've ever done: it's 45 minutes long, it has 5 stops and in between that there's like 9 minute stretches of ride. So that's about as long the Jungle Cruise curently is. You'll be touring all the outdoor sites of the Four Corners of the World as well as going into show boxes where we'll tell the stories about the different areas youre coming to or leaving. For instance, if you were leaving Asia and going into Europe, you would go into a space and--very much like Spaceship Earth--you would see the forming of ancient Greece and Rome and the burning of Rome and then the resurgence and the rennaissance. After Michaelangelo paints the Sisteine Chappel as he does in Spaceship Earth, we would emerge out of that building and be in Rennaissance Italy and you're invited to step out in that experience: amid all the entertainment, shops and restaurants.   One of the things that we found out when we analyzed EPCOT is that many elements are out of context. For instance, the Sisteine Chappel is in Spaceship Earth, the Mona Lisa is being painted in the World of Motion but the Italian and German pavilions are way out on the other side of park. So we've tried to index all of that so on the World Cruise you'll get all of those story points that encompass the dawn of the earth's history up through modern times and then at 5 key points you'll be invited to step out if you wish or continue on with the story. They all had to be designed as 9 minute shows because we have no guarantee where you're going to get on. So each story is complete and sets up the next stage.   [Slide #7] Going on now to Europe, because of the size restriction here, we weren't able to have each individual country the way they do in Florida. That would take up the whole parking lot alone without any Future World but by pooling [continents] together like Germany, Italy, England and France, you'll feel more like you're in a land than you do in Florida, where you barely get in and that's the end of the pavilion. You keep being reminded that you're along that lake. Here you'll be able to really get lost back in the bi-ways and when you look up it won't be a fake set in the window it will be somebody living up in that space [hotel guests]. So I think it's going to be a much more environmentally complete space.  We have an attraction, Tivoli Gardens, in the front here. We've tried to integrate children's rides throughout the park because another problem we have at EPCOT is it's mostly films and travel information and shopping, which children don't find that attractive. So w've got something at each stop which we hope will be appealing to all age groups. There's a CircleVision show in France that we did for Euro-Disney, ""From Time to Time,"" It's with audio-animatronics...Hidden under the acropolis here is the show space where guests will see the dawn of Europe and the blossoming of the rennaissance.  [Slide #8] This is back in the courtyards going from Germany onto Italy and these canals are the areas where the World Cruise will travel...The larger buildings in the back can be acheived because we have 5 and 6 stories to work with in the hotels, that they don't have to work with in Florida. Another reason for that is that in the 30-something years that Disneyland's been open the outside surround has gotten a lot more developed and grown up and we can't hide that anymore with new trees. So having 6 story buildings in the back is going to give us the block that we need. And then on top of the hotels we'll put set pieces like St. Basil's from Russia.   We were very hot on doing a Russian pavillion and we were very close to doing it in Florida and then the whole economy changed over there. We have a completed show that was read to go and maybe it will come to life here in WesCOT.  [Slide #9] Going on to Asia, this [building] combines the Indian palace in the back, which is a hotel stretching over into China and Japan. In the foreground is SE Asia and there's a carousel of mythic Asian animals primarily for the children as well ethnic foods along the lake. There's a Japanese show in the main pavilion over here and Ride the Dragon, which is a Chinese festive dragon that travels up and down over the Dragon's Teeth Mountains. When it gets up to the higher altitudes, so you won't see the Emerald Hotel, we have silks that come down over the side of the coaster and enclose the guests in a festive dragon. . . . The silks will be in the up position when you load and then when it gets going really fast we'll bring them down and it will be like in a worm hole from a Star Trek movie. That'll keep you from seeing things that you shouldn't see too. . . . It will be a striking piece to see both from Disneyland Drive on the outside as well as providing a rather effective backdrop inside the park. . . . A lot of these ideas were lifted from the original EPCOT concept so we'll bring back The Temple of Heaven for China.   [Slide #10] This is a sample of how we would do an Indian hotel. We cheated a little bit because India obviously isn't exactly in Asia but it is one historic architecture that already looks a lot like a hotel. The stretch of doing this was easier than taking a Chinese or Japanese form and trying to adapt it to a liveable experience.   [New slide] There was a concept for Africa and the Middle East that we're kind of sorry we didn't get to do. Micheal Eisner is always trying to stretch everybody to do things that are very difficult. One of the shows we had in here was The Three Great Religions of the World. He said ""I want you to do a show that everyone will enjoy and will find perfectly in concert with their particular religion."" (laughter) So we had settled on depicting the 7 days of creation and avoiding all of the problems between the Muslim and the Jewish and Christian versions of that. And we were getting very excited because we were starting to deal with 7 of the great artists of the world and trying to have them depict each of the single days that they had been given. Maybe that will happen later. The Three Religions would be a little olive garden piece and you would step into the pre-show and go into the main area.   [New slide] This is the portion that we will be building intitially. It has the Zambezee River Cruise, the Story Teller Tree, where we'll have stories of African history told beneath the tree with a live narrator and the Tishman African Art Exhibit, the world's largest African art exhibit that is=A0currently running at the Bower's Museum and this will be the permanent home for that show.  [New slide] The Egyptians did not build hotels, obviously, so we're cheating a little bit here but it could be a very fun and elegant place to build.  [New slide] Across from the lake is Future World and like I mentioned it's like going on stage. We only have one icon so instead of all the different pavillions competing architecturaly, we only have one space. You'll walk under the cascading waterfall into the lobby and there'll be gangways leading to the stages. Inside those stages we have 3 wonder areas, in combination with the Four Wonders of the World, will give us The Seven Wonders of WestCOT. That will be a catch phrase at WestCOT.   Nature is quite large because it not only contains some new things that we don't have in Florida but it has the growing areas as you have seen them in Walt Disney World and the Seas Pavilion as part of Nature. This building alone will is the same size as Walt Disney World's Seas Pavilion. I used to say to everyone: ""Think of a Price Club and taking out all of the stuff and making it about 20' higher than that."" (laughter) It's on 2 levels. . . . The [Nature] area will have everything from a fozen environment, which will actually be cold and refrigerated so you can actually play with the ice and snow to an arrid desert and a humid jungle area. This is all new. This is going to be an area that you can actually go into as well as going the under the water in the Seas pavilion, pretty much as you know it at EPCOT. . . .The growing areas in the Seas and the Land will be open as a more major attraction. In Florida you have to reserve a trip to go through there and here we'll make it more of a standard event."

Yes, the pre-show with its rotating cubes were pretty cool and far better than what's currently in there.  And the show wasn't tacky/corny/severely dated like it is today.   But instead it was about 45 minutes of feeling completely trapped in one of those terrible, boring educational videos they made you watch in science class with a cool, brief dinosaur sequence in the middle of it all -- a longer version of the one you see on the train at Disneyland.    Always thought the tech behind the moving theaters was mindblowingly awesome and the setup was great overall, but having to sit through this as a child was an absolutely PAINFUL experience.    It's nice to see it today thru old videos and I have a much better appreciation for the work that was put into it, but as an EPCOT Center child of the 80s, this was easily the least fun thing to do in the park for me and many others I'm sure. :)"

I have the book at the top left (which is awesome) and the mini trays on the right under the larger future world one.  I believe there is one for each pavilion and all the countries.  The book is similar to the pictorial souvenir books, but has a ton of concept art in the style of Hench and Ryman.  It's just beautful.

I actually found this exact pin on the ground in MK a few years back and had no idea until just now. I thought whatever was inside must've been broken, and now I feel dumb for not even checking the back...  And I also agree that something like the Captain's animatronic should be in a Disney museum, though few artifacts are saved based on sheer quantity of them. Now with that said, it is nice to have a piece of the original ride, even if it is microscopic. To me its more sentimental than anything, but now I'm just glad I know."

The boat was most likely above capacity with guests, and therefore top-heavy (pack the guests in at closing rather than make 2 trips).  As the operator pulled the rudder back and forth to simulate rapids, the boat capsized right where you see it.

There is a long stretch of track between MK and Epcot that could have several resorts attached but instead you get a commute from Coronado Springs. Oh how I long for Progressland.

VintageDisney,296eag,Witt6,2,Sun Jun 29 15:09:55 2014 UTC,No. The characters are too tall from their actual one screen versions. Hooter and Idee and Geex were played by people with dwarfism. Trying to hire people for that would be a pain. It's better to just make replica costumes for people of average high. Plus the Major Domo's left leg is like a peg leg in the movie. Clearly not so here.

Not only did he revolutionize entertainment in media and change how Americans (eventually most of the world) vacation, he was a major force in technology and practical philosophy. His next big move was city planning and could have easily transitioned into nation building focused on pragmatism. This could have helped save our dwindling resources and (I think) would have prevented wars and fundamentally changed the way the world works. We lost him just too soon and no one had the gumption, good will, or resources to follow up on what he started.

VintageDisney,26qz50,bondandracing,1 point,Thu May 29 01:29:24 2014 UTC,These are a few cast member uniform pins from Disneyland and Epcot that were used in the late 70s and early 80s. They took me a few years to find and Im still on the hunt for a few more.
VintageDisney,26r4xu,baxman343,2,Thu May 29 02:31:41 2014 UTC,"Yeah!  I loved this show.  Great humor, cool concept.  I like the Monsters Inc Laugh Floor, but I miss attractions like this that were original to the park, had great content, and weren't part of a film franchise."
VintageDisney,26r4xu,YITredMR,2,Thu May 29 04:13:58 2014 UTC,"this actually was NOT original to the park, it was original to Disneyland Paris."
VintageDisney,26r4xu,YITredMR,1 point,Thu May 29 04:17:14 2014 UTC,"I didn't realize it was original to Disneyland Paris. I knew it wasn't an original Walt Disney World attraction, but I remember going one year and loving it the first time that I saw it. Heard the audio of it streaming for the first time about a month ago and it took me back. Robin Williams was so great for that part.   EDIT: I see where I talked about attractions that were original to the park, but it was meant as original park content, not something adapted from a film. Sorry - I can definitely see the possibility for confusion from what I wrote!"

VintageDisney,2416xo,baxman343,1 point,Sat Apr 26 14:48:59 2014 UTC,"I'm guessing the wheel & hub in the bottom-left would have been MK?  Not sure about the rest, though."
VintageDisney,2416xo,banksnld,3,Sat Apr 26 18:33:16 2014 UTC,"Here's part 1, part 2 and part 3 of Walt Disney explaining what he was planning to do.  The tl;dw was basically he got very interested in urban planning in the 60s, saw that unplanned cities had a lot of problems and thought a totally planned city built on new principles could be better.   It was designed to be nearly car free, multiple ""hubs"" would be connected by monorail and from each hub there would be radiating out people-movers that would take you to your home etc. The center of the hub would be business/leisure or industry, followed by a ""green ring"" of parks, sports fields, schools, libraries, churches etc followed by houses beyond that. Cars can't go past the green ring except to make deliveries, which would be done via roads below ground level so that the central cores would be pedestrian only (and therefore smog/car accident free) at ground level. It also meant that downtown roads would have a width designed for people rather than a width designed for cars, making things denser, cozier and easier to reach on foot. There was even the suggestion (it is Florida after all) that you could build a glass canopy over the downtown to protect against rain or even air-condition the whole downtown since you don't need to leave openings for cars. There would also be ring highways around each hub beyond the residential areas, so if you needed to go to another town or visit someone in another hub you could still use your car, you just can't use it to get downtown.  It's too bad he died because the second he did the board basically scrapped every plan he made. I can't blame them though, they are a business with shareholders to consider and building a ""Disneyland East"" seemed like a much safer investment that trying to reinvent the city. I think the plan would have made the cities too inflexible to adapt to the future, but it would have been good I think to have an example of this kind of thinking tried somewhere."
VintageDisney,2416xo,auandi,1 point,Sun Apr 27 01:23:59 2014 UTC,"no MK in early plans. this was when Epcot was still going to be a city, when Walt died they canceled those plans and substituted with MK."

Mine shows Edison Square and Liberty Street as well (and look, there are the Flying Saucers).  The reason future attractions were included is that Walt insisted that they show the new things that they were planning.  Of course Square and Street never transpired at DL as their tiny backstage space became too valuable, but we have Liberty Square at WDW, which is a variation on the original plans for DL."

VintageDisney,23b6p5,b_unnie,4,Fri Apr 18 17:22:14 2014 UTC,Let's not over think this. There are too many subs with weird rules and special posts.  How about this just be a place to post old Disney stuff?
VintageDisney,23b6p5,baxman343,2,Fri Apr 18 09:36:06 2014 UTC,thats basically what we're going for.
VintageDisney,23b6p5,baxman343,1 point,Fri Apr 18 15:23:58 2014 UTC,Then don't try to make a big plan. Just let the subreddit evolve into whatever it becomes.
VintageDisney,23b6p5,rumpkin_patch,2,Fri Apr 18 17:49:14 2014 UTC,"some ideas we've been tossing around   One big thing I was thinking is the day / week the mine train opens we can have 2 discussion threads. one about the mine train and the other about 20K, to compare how much that land has changed over the years. this would go in conjunction with tons of 20K media across the front page.  Love the idea of a weekly news thread, but I'm a little worried about it getting away from the ""vintage"" idea. How about doing news, and also a ""this week in history"" sort of thing as well, like a now and then sort of comparison?  what about an in depth history type thing last night, just a random thing every week or so?  I love the idea of an in depth history thread, just pick an attraction out of a hat every week or do a vote or something.  Could have a mine train week even, like look at the development of the Mine Train thru Natures Wonderland, both Big Thunders, the proposed Indy mine train, and stuff like that, and in conjunction look at the production of Snow White?   I hope I'm not doing anything bad by posting this"
VintageDisney,23b6p5,baxman343,2,Thu Apr 17 23:10:38 2014 UTC,"I like the ""This week in History"" idea a lot and the history threads, where we could ask questions/discuss specific events and attractions and movies, and perhaps it would promote further research.  I'd definitely like posts that aren't just images, but discussion as well."
