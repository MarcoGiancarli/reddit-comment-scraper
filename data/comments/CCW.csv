Military bases and associated installations fall under the UCMJ, military directives and federal law.  They typically respect the state that they are in's laws but only to the point where they are more restrictive than federal (in my experience)."
CCW,3e22x9,ummmbacon,5,Tue Jul 21 14:40:41 2015 UTC,"The rebuttal that I've heard is that recruitment centers are not military bases. They are often normal office buildings in the commercial part of town, and are not military bases, therefore those directives don't apply to them.  I don't know if that's true or not, but it sounds plausible. It's at least something to think about before definitively saying that carrying at recruitment centers is breaking military law."
CCW,3e22x9,derrick81787,4,Tue Jul 21 14:51:33 2015 UTC,"I would assume it applies to them as well since it is still DoD property, one way or another, and the directive 5210.56 specifies ""DoD installations, property, or personnel lives or DoD assets"" and isn't limited to bases.

I have no idea why, but this  was a common complaint when I was in the Army in the 90's (after the Toole Stadium shooting in which I was present), then again after the Ft. Hood shooting, etc.   The DoD really does not trust members of the military to be armed around civilians, even after 911, they put uniformed National guardsmen with weapons in airports.... with no ammunition."

I didn't say that I was only linking the law that covered the bases since /u/Aeidios asked for it.   Although to add to the point, military members must always follow the UCMJ, the directives and federal law regardless of where they are.  Which is why military members can't use marijuana in Colorado or other states where it is legal.  You don't just remove the law when you leave base."
CCW,3e22x9,ummmbacon,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:13:57 2015 UTC,"Thank you. So if there were a message about a recruiting center being attacked, they could carry then and still be following these policies since in the first link it says when ""there is a reasonable expectation that life or DoD assets will be jeopardized if firearms are not carried""?  In the 2011 one it says, ""Qualified personnel shall be armed when required for assigned duties and there is reasonable expectation that DoD installations, property, or personnel lives or DoD assets will be jeopardized."" So recruiting centers still would not be allowed to carry since it is not required for their duties even if there is an imminent threat, right?  Thanks again for the info."
CCW,3e22x9,Aeidios,2,Tue Jul 21 15:10:47 2015 UTC,"""there is a reasonable expectation that life or DoD assets will be jeopardized if firearms are not carried""?

CCW,3e22x9,ummmbacon,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:19:24 2015 UTC,"Yeah, and the 2011 one says there has to be a threat AND it has to be part of their duties to carry a weapon. I wonder if that's just poor wording or if it has to meet both requirements."
CCW,3e22x9,Aeidios,2,Tue Jul 21 16:27:28 2015 UTC,Depends on who is interpreting it.  But US Title Code also forbids it so it is sort of a double whammy.

Then maybe it's riot/looting control at such a disaster.  At the far end would be curfew, martial law, and then suspending of civilian rule.

Several of the top leadership of the military, including the Army chief of staff and other confirmed badasses, have expressed their reservations.  First of all, anyone in power who turns down more power deserves major respect.  We need more of these guys in politics!  Second, if you recall a decade ago, we used to have this thing called privacy, per the Fourth Amendment. The author of the Patriot act has indicated he in no way intended its scope to be widened into the massive surveillance state which resulted.  At the time, people remarked about slippery slopes, but in reality, giving more power to a government branch will never, ever end with them giving it back.  They will expand into the box you give them, and maybe a little more in this case.  Then they will invent reasons to retain the new mission.  Now, back to the military, if there is some legislation to amend Posse Comitatus to specifically address service members among the public, and on bases, can carry sidearms, while retaining its ""no policing"" provisions, in my opinion that would be the best resolution.  It would take care of both concerns at hand."

Mine is basically a underarmor sports shirt that is about 2 sizes too small, and has some padding on it. I originally bought it to run with so I didn't need a holster however, I have not tried it yet (kinda scared of the heat problem). Truth is it is $60 short sleeve, tight, underarmor shirt with some chest padding, and some Velcro between the pads. Quite a shitty holster IMO. It MAY be useful if you have a job with a dress code requiring fully tucked (non-bloused) shirts, but in reality it is a niche solution at best. 4/10 Feel free to ask any questions."

Might not be the quickest draw time but under a button up shirt might not be too bad. If I end up getting on I'll be sure to post a review.

CCW,3e18y3,MawOfMadness,3,Tue Jul 21 04:58:52 2015 UTC,"That's a pretty sticky situation. A lot of factors come into play in how you should respond in that situation.   How close is the active shooter? What kind of capacity does the rifle have? Has he seen you or has focused his current fire in your direction?  All of these are very important when choosing when or how to engage. If he is not withing a decent shooting distance for pistols, how sure are you that you could actually get a shot that would take him down without missing and possibly hitting a bystander. If your hit doesn't drop him, now he knows there is an armed threat to him and will probably focus on trying to find the shooter.  If he doesn't have a high capacity you could try and take cover and wait until he goes to reload before engaging.  If he is firing in your direction, popping out to engage while outgunned is probably going to end badly. Your best bet may be fleeing if a opportunity does not present itself.  Of course this is all hypothetical. My what if's normally include a shotgun and me getting the hell out of there. I don't see a pistol beating a shotgun in a gunfight"

We know what you meant though. ;)   Should i carry a double mag pouch, or two single pouches?   I recommend two single. I like having the option of just one mag. Especially if the garment doesn't really hide both well. Sometimes I can get by with one. I am mostly carrying two if it's winter time only.  Two mags split up slightly on your non dominant side are usually going to be more comfortable than two side by side.  The other plus side is that you can always throw the second mag into a bag or even some cargos can take a mag (vertx). It's not perfect, but it does work at a basic level.  While yes, people have shot bag guys 20 times, had to make long distance shots, had to deal with soft armor, etc. etc. etc. For the most part my mind usually thinks of multiple bad guys when I think of multiple mags.  It's all up to you what you want to carry/deal with."

I figure if I try to carry any more it will be really uncomfortable and I won't carry it regularly. If it's not on me, it doesn't do any good. In an ideal world I'd love to have a full size HK45 on me, with two backup mags. The reality is that I can't conceal that gun reliably, and I won't want to carry all that all the time. It really comes down to a balance between being prepared, and being consistent. IMO of course. I really considered getting the double mag pouch for the capability of carrying a second spare if I ever wanted to, but in the end concealment and comfort won out over the rare times I would want that.  EDIT: Plus, as someone else said, you can always keep more mags in your vehicle. Ideally you'd be moving back to it if at all possible in some sort of event anyway."

CCW,3dykzj,hooraah,5,Tue Jul 21 02:17:38 2015 UTC,"Based on what I read, which is scant on details, here's my armchair QB speculative assessment:  The one dude was a vietnam vet.  I don't know what the age range is off the top of my head but I'm guessing older, probably 60+?  The other guy was 38.   I don't know if its just the age or some other part of their personality but I see this all the time in the firearms community, especially in south florida (where the story takes place and where I'm from, hooray a local story....) - these older guys are always thinking they have to lay down the law to generations younger than them, or 'set them straight', impart some other attitude adjustment because they feel they were wronged.  'Ya know, teach them some respect because their father never did'....that kind of thing.  So I'd say these two hot heads got into an argument over turtles, one drew his weapon, and after things calmed down enough to put it away, maybe he thought he needed to set the guy straight.  Like I said, I'm speculating, but if you fear for your life enough to draw a weapon, that doesn't jive with hanging around after the fact and getting into a scuffle where you are disarmed.  Just my 2 cents."

Just because we carry doesn't mean we are obligated to let things that we think are wrong in the world slide...    If some dude is trying to set a box of puppies on fire with a blowtorch I'm probably going to call 911 and say something to get him to stop what he's doing until the police arrive...    If the dog welder turns his aggression on me and comes at me for trying to stop him then I'm going to make the same opportunity, ability, jeopardy assessment that I would if he was any random mugger on the street.  The fact that I could have kept my mouth shut and let him light some dogs on fire while I waited for the cops to show up shouldn't really factor into it because in my (and hopefully a prosecutors) opinion speaking up is doing the right thing....  Granted this case is wildly different"

CCW,3dykzj,BlackDeath3,2,Mon Jul 20 17:27:38 2015 UTC,"I think the reason you're getting down voted is because seemingly you agreed the person who got shot in the butt (lol) did the right thing to deescalate the situation.  Drawing a firearm will not calm someone down, I know it wouldn't me... Another thing to note is carrying a firearm doesn't make you a vigilante or a crime stopper or some kind of wildlife protector of things.  Leave that up to the pro's.  My .02."

And of course, that isn't what downvotes are for, but some people just don't care about Reddiquette. Not too much I can do about that.  If the man's (the one who was shot in the butt) goal was to deescalate the situation, then perhaps drawing a weapon wasn't a good idea. I specifically stated that I must abstain from judgment because I wasn't there nor have I done sufficient research aside, and because I have to imagine (though I cannot be certain) that sometimes drawing your weapon is the right way to deescalate. Sometimes drawing your gun will very quickly force an aggressor (and I do mean an aggressor, not just some guy doing something that you happen to find disagreeable) to drop any sort of tough-guy pretense and realize or accept that they've just place themselves into a bona-fide life-or-death situation. Sometimes, drawing a gun will cause them to back down and defuse.  On the point of not being a vigilante or crime-stopper: leave it up to the pros if the pros are available. Let's face it - all of us here carry guns because we realize that we can't simply ""leave everything up to the pros"". Now, that doesn't give us a license to just go around enforcing our will on others, and that is not what I'm suggesting. I don't, however, think that defense-of-life falls into the category of vigilantism. Some people don't think that this concept should extend beyond humans - I do. I suppose that's just another point of debate."

If there is no immediate bodily harm going to come to me or immediate persons who I am around (friends loved ones etc) I'll probably not draw my firearm.  Example from two weeks ago:  I work in a fairly rough part of the city and stopped at a stop light.  There was a vehicle in front of me and of course behind me.  I see an urban gentleman walking fairly close to the sidewalk, situational awareness dictates I need to keep an eye on this guy.  He passes the car behind me then walks by my vehicle.  Tries opening the passenger door and of course it doesn't open (thank you safety locks!).  Punches the window and spits on it then goes on about his business.  Would I be justified in drawing my weapon?  Yea, probably so.  Would it have helped the situation?  I have no way of knowing, but the guy did seem like he was tweaked out of his mind so I'm pretty sure he would have got brave and caused a scene.  Looking back on it I do think I did the right thing by not drawing due to the part of town I was in and the nature of the ""by-standers""."

I mean it's bad enough that some CCW people seem to have a hero mentality, but you're going to use your gun to defend turtles and end up getting shot over it?  That's retarded.

Is it worth it if somebody else gets shot over it? That's their decision to make, and legally we've already decided that defenders have the right to make that final call if they feel that themselves or loved ones are in danger as a result of an aggressor making that decision to harm others. We even have pretty regular discussion about defense of others (not loved ones) stuck in life-or-death situations. All that I'm doing is suggesting that those rights to life and defense be extended beyond our species.

But from how this reads, this was just an asshole bitching about turtles. I'm sure he was threatening death or grievous bodily harm against the eggs and the turtles, but I'm pretty sure Florida's self-defense laws don't allow you to defend turtle nests with lethal force...  Again, not a ton to go on, but it sounds like this idiot escalated pointlessly and got shot for it. He's lucky he's alive.

CCW,3dykzj,CaptainCummings,29,Mon Jul 20 16:22:26 2015 UTC,"While I don't agree with the CCWer's logic, according to this article. The man said things like “I’m going to get you, you fucking sea turtle people” and “I’m going to beat the fuck out of you.”  In Florida, Aggravated Assault is a forcible felony and you are committing aggravated assault under the following conditions:  (a) With a deadly weapon without intent to kill; or (b) With an intent to commit a felony.  Now in Florida, fucking with the sea turtles is a 3rd degree felony. So based on the fact he was threatening to ""beat the fuck"" out of the people helping the sea turtles and harm the sea turtles in the process, it isn't that far to stretch he was committing aggravated assault.  So maybe it was an (legally) okay situation to draw, but yeah calling the police should have been top priority and if he actually did anything other than shouting at people, then maybe consider drawing.  It is also worth pointing out the CCWer is an older man, so there was likely sufficient disparity of force from a 38 year old guy on liquid courage."

In practice, no deaths, no ninja ""just need an inch of penetration beneath left armpit"", just lots of scars and sutures.  My grandpa was a circuit court judge in my home county for a long damned time, and he is the one that said to me, ""Better to be judged by twelve than carried by six,"" and now that I've my own family, I'm right there with you.

It was my second class; the first was an optional Georgia class, and this one was the required Colorado class.    Our instructor stressed the importance of reporting any incident where you even threaten use of the gun.  If you have to talk about it, or gesture towards it, or draw it, or use it, doesn't matter - as soon as the confrontation is over, you need to call the police and report the assault/other crime that made it necessary.  That puts you on record as the victim.    So, applying that lesson to this situation, I would say if he believed that he could calm the guy down to where he could continue hanging around, he over-reacted drawing to begin with.  I think if the gun comes out you should at the minimum order to target to leave the area, because how likely is it that he's going to stand there quietly while you call to report an assault?  It sounds like the guy was a nutbag anyway (honestly; who hates turtles?) so it's possible that the confrontation with the gun is what actually changed the situation from a shouting match to a physical confrontation."

CCW,3dykzj,rivalarrival,13,Mon Jul 20 17:12:34 2015 UTC,"It's called a ""psychological stop"" - the attacker sees intended victim has prepared to defend himself, and chooses to end his attack.   This is the usual outcome of defensive gun use. You draw with intent to fire, but by the time you've completed the draw and taken aim at the attacker, he stops. You evaluate, consider the  attacker to be retreating, thus the threat is no longer imminent and firing is no longer justified."
CCW,3dykzj,ofc-crash,4,Mon Jul 20 19:14:01 2015 UTC,"Yes, that happens and it even happened in this event.

I don't think the ""need"" aspect is there, because we know that legal concealed carriers have a VERY low likelihood of incorrectly using their weapons.   Need implies a critical necessity to address a very clear or chronic problem within the system of concealed carry.   I just don't think that the problem is prevalent enough to warrant a ""need.""

If he pulled a gun when he wasn't in fear of grievous bodily harm, then charge him with the crime he committed; some form of brandishing, menacing, etc.. That's already illegal.   And negligent discharges? You want to prohibit gun ownership unless one has been approved by the government after taking some class to cut down on negligent discharges; because ""one life lost is enough for anybody who ever knew them?""

Maybe I can amend the idea of ""training"" into a single document that lists your states laws in regards to guns that you sign in order to take possession of the gun.  This process would be free.  That would somewhat compromise between both of our views. 4.  Yes, that's the exact reason I would like that class.  If it saves even one life, it would be worth it to me.  I don't like the idea of needless deaths, even if it's a ""stupid"" person.  That may be extremest, but I don't really care. 6.  I absolutely agree about the reaction about the Sandy Hook shooting.

I came across one down in the Daytona Beach area a few years back, did not touch it, someone had already called the beach patrol. A whole team of five guys came out, took photos, measurements, etc for about 3 hours before hauling it off. To me it just looked like the turtle got chewed up in a boat prop."

CCW,3dykzj,hooraah,5,Mon Jul 20 17:10:48 2015 UTC,"ITT: No one read the article. This guy didn't pull out his gun in defense of turtles. The order the article details the events is 1. Saving turtle nest (I assume from predators), 2. Confronted by felon who ""hates turtles and the people who help them."" 3. Pulled out gun. He pulled the gun out because the felon was acting crazy and threatening him, not the turtles.  But my big takeaway was this.   Pannaman, who has a permit to carry, said he pulled out his gun in an attempt to calm down McAuliffe.  ""He complied, and I put my gun away, then he attacked me and took my gun,"" Pannaman said.   If someone makes you so afraid that you have to pull out your gun and you don't shoot, you don't reholster until they're gone."
CCW,3dykzj,dotMJEG,4,Mon Jul 20 17:16:30 2015 UTC,"This is odd, and a little vague.  Guy shouldn't have pulled a gun unless he felt that he was in risk of grave injury or death. Now, from the article, it doesn't appear that the weirdo was threatening anyone or acting in such a way, however, he eventually did attack the CCW holder and take his gun.  Sooo the real questions are, would he have attacked even if the gun was bought out, and how extreme was he acting? He is a convicted felon apparently, and it appears that no charges are being pushed on the Vet.   If Mr Crazy was yelling about killing ""turtle volunteers"", meh, grey area. If he was just being ""I'll hump the damn tree!"" crazy, then should have called the cops."

If the story read ""some angry old man pulled a gun on an innocent beach-goer who disarmed him for everyone's safety"" I wouldn't consider the premise far-fetched.  Like you said, charges ended up being filed against the other guy (not the armed person), but this has a stink of ""Condo Commando"" about it.  Its noble the guy wanted to protect sea turtles, as they are endangered, but I can't help but think that the type of person that has nothing better to do than sit in the dark and wait for someone to do something wrong on their watch is the same type of person to make altercations out of nothing."
CCW,3dykzj,Tarnsman4Life,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:05:19 2015 UTC,"Do you mean even if the gun was not brought out?   Correct, had the gun never been involved, would the somewhat irrational man have turned into the very irrational man.   I'm not sure what you mean by the ""old man pulled a gun"" statement, but it seems clear that the angry person was mr cray cray who hates turtles.   but I can't help but think that the type of person that has nothing better to do than sit in the dark and wait for someone to do something wrong on their watch is the same type of person to make altercations out of nothing.    I think that's too far of an assumption to even rationalize. For instance, there are several areas of this world I frequent, many I hold very close to my heart and are important to me for many reasons. When I go there, I am just as willing to defend myself as I would at any other location. Had these details been few or far between, (say in a justified instance, we just don't know that as 3rd party viewers), what reason would there be to paint me as a ""wanna-be park-rambo waiting for someone"" versus just another beach-goer who frequents the area?  I guess what I'm saying is, he probably doesn't go to the beach to be Rambo, he probably goes just because he likes it. I think it's way more likely, and a lot safer to assume given the information that we have, that he over-reacted, if we can assume anything. I don't think we can realistically assume that much. Mr. I hate turtles could have been acting in a very aggressive/ irrational manner for all we know."

I am by no means a quick draw but I am not going to give verbal commands if I feel my life is in danger, especially if they are real close like that. The odds of the situation changing from life threatening, to not in that very very very small window are nil. The gun is coming out and the threat is going to be stopped.

The general attitude here is to never carry against the law, but absolutely carry against the rules. Campus carry is almost always against the rules, but is not illegal in many states. I carry on campus in WV because it is against school policy, but not against the law. Same goes for ""no guns"" signs in businesses (although around here you're more likely to see the ""judicious marksmanship is appreciated"" ones)."

I would agree skilled CCWers are better than non skilled, but it's whether the juice is worth the squeeze. I don't think it is. Is that betterment worth the the evils or possible evils of the permit system?  Some permits are almost $200 dollars. Some have gotten people's names published in the local newspaper.  Like I said, I find permits bogus. I think any true American should as well. The literal and figurative PRICE of them is what I am not happy with.   The second amendment means a lot to me as well, but I don't think breaking laws and posting about it on a public forum is an effective way of bringing change to expand those rights.

Hi everyone, I'm what I consider to be a responsible gun owner. I go shooting regularly, I keep my weapons well maintained, and I hold the 4 Safety Rules in high regard.  Now, here's the controversial bit. I live in a place (within the US) that is de facto ""no issue"", and I'm also in a place where you do have to lock your doors, and you wouldn't want you wife/girlfriend/daughter to walk to the corner-store to grab a bottle of milk at 11:30 at night. I've been burglarized twice, and attacked on the street twice, and I know several people that have been mugged, attack and a few that have been raped. I don't live in a horrible area, but it's certainly not the safest.  I also believe people have a natural right to defend themselves, and the means to do so. This encompasses carrying a gun.  All of this amounts to the fact that I often carry a gun. If a LEO discovers this, I can be charged with a felony. Now, that's unlikely since I am respectful and observant of other criminal laws, and reasonably protected under the 4th Amendment.  I keep the weapon concealed. I have never been discovered, except by my significant other as she's sitting on my lap, or I'm picking her up and giving her a hug.  What do you guys think about this? Am I making a terrible mistake? Am I risking far too much? Am I right? Am I taking a reasonable measure to protect myself?  Feel free to as questions, and thank you for your input.

I think I comes down to looking at the situation and saying who is more likely to hurt me: a criminal, or the government.   Look at this GIF. Before the Right to Carry Movement started in 1986 Men still carried guns. I've heard CCW instructors ask their students why they wanted their permits.

Depending on how you interpreted the statute this may or may not have been illegal, but it was definitely against the rules of the company. Despite this, I'd say about 90% of the employees were armed, many with permits. I, myself, never bothered with getting a permit as I was certain of getting the benefit of the doubt from any LEO that had cause to become aware of the presence of the firearm due to the close working relationship our company had with the local police agencies.

Once control of your firearm is re-established, you order them to get back several times while creating distance between you. If you are not within arms reach they cannot take your firearm, common sense. If they comply, obviously you don't open up on them, either call the police once you have some distance or retreat from the situation entirely then call the police.  The alternative would be that the assailant does not retreat when you tell them to, in that case, you know they took your gun once and will do it again, shoot until the threat is stopped"

At this point you have had someone actively attempting to take a deadly weapon (in theory to use against you).  You absolutely would be justified in defending yourself (unless they started complying to your orders).  If they started to comply, just hold them at gunpoint at a distance that is safe.  In reality you don't want to hold anyone at gunpoint in a distance short enough they could get to you anyways."

I'm no tactics guru, but usually you are going to control the slide/muzzle/etc of the gun away from you while using your other hand to do work (empty hand, knife, whatever)  Backup is either shivworks clinch pick / cold steel best pal.  http://store.tripleaughtdesign.com/ShivWorks-Clinch-Pick  http://www.coldsteel.com/Product/43XL/Best_Pal_Plain_Edge.aspx  Though, a lot of the high lords on /CCW poo poo blades for weapons retention. I would fucking love to spar with them and a blue gun if they have no training in martial arts/weapons retention, etc.  I promise that poking someone in the eyeballs, nose and throat with a little TDI LDK will get their attention. http://www.amazon.com/KA-BAR-Enforcement-Last-Ditch-Knife/dp/B0013LNLNS  The downside to all 3 of these knives is they either need a modified sheath to be any good (the clinch pick) or the sheath flat out sucks and aftermarket is the way to go.  And yes, if I love a knife I do think it's worth it to pay $20-50 for a quality sheath for it. Finding an empty knife sheath in a real fight would suck.  I really like the cold steel best pal. There are far better push daggers out there, but there isn't anything close in that price range.  Yes, this has been trained/taught/worked on with a professional instructor. Regardless, it's not hard to find trainers who highly recommend some type of blade for weapons retention.  As for what to do during a weapons grab if I am able to get back firing control? Heck yes I'm going to fire! I am in a deadly force situation. The person isn't going to appear 30 feet away the moment I take control of the gun and who thinks in that moment of control the person is just going to instantly give up or stop trying to kill you?  I think it's pretty reasonable to most that someone who's fighting over your pistol has very DARK INTENT. Process them as such.  There is something of a feeling of saving grace when you're sparring with someone with a training gun and you know at certain moments that in real life you would probably have the ability to draw your knife and hopefully change the game in your favor. Such a feeling is something you won't forget."

At this point, take your non-dominant arm and hit their forearms as hard as you can with your forearm (if it hurts you a lot, you're doing it right).  This should break their grip.  If not, kick/knee-strike (or even just straight-up punch them in the face) and try again until successful.  Perform a failure drill (tap-rack-ready), proceed with firing/commands from there.  If they have grabbed the muzzle of your gun, it is recommended you pull the trigger.  If they don't let go after being shot, bring the weapon back into you (create distance with your feet, if possible), and then do a forearm strike to their wrists/forearms with your non-dominant hand.  Forcefully pull back with your gun hand and angle the muzzle down at the same time.  This should break their grip.  Perform a failure drill, proceed with shooting/commands from there.

You got the glitch people down and LCP, but I carry a M&P 9. On top of that a lot of people that want to ""eliminate bulk"" carry a shield.   So, looking story short. If you know the trigger guards are important to your target group (I'm assuming you know this based on you text above), then you should offer it for all the guns you offer clips.

CCW,3e03aq,Suckat3,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:29:12 2015 UTC,"Ah. In that case:  1) Covering the trigger is a requirement for me. And I don't see a point in using two devices to carry (integrated clip + MIC/Vanguard, etc) when one will do.  2) When I go to draw, step 1 is to get a firm grip with the firing hand. Looking at OPs website, I'd be going fishing in my waistband instead, pulling up a sweaty gun wedged deeply in between the beltline and underwear. No thanks.  3) In over 10 years of carrying, the LCP is the only gun I've owned that I managed to rust. In addition to proper TLC, keeping it protected in a  holster helps prevent/mitigate this.  4) I want to be able to practice my draw. With a proper holster I can get a lot of quality practice in a given block of time since reholstering is a simple affair. What OP describes would require picking the Saf-T-Blok or other gimmicky device up off the ground, resetting it, then wedging that gun back down in the waistband for another inconsistent draw stroke that starts with fishing the gun out.   4a) Sidenote on the Saf-T-Blok: I only want my finger going into the trigger guard for 1 reason, and that's not it."

Additionally, the Garrison Grip trigger plug I tried was too stiff and took two hands to remove; and the kydex guards all fit a little too snugly and take too much effort to ""unholster"".  None of the current trigger guard options are satisfactory.  Something like a desantis holster costs less than the techna clip, it can be used for IWB or pocket carry (the clip can only be used for IWB), it protects my firearm from sweat, and it allows me to unholster my firearm quickly without struggling to remove trigger guards.  heck, even if someone is satisfied with the kydex guards, when you factor in the cost of a trigger guard, you're looking at the same price as a pretty nice IWB holster for something that's going to give your firearm more protection and be less of a hassle."

The sights are very low profile to avoid snagging in your pocket, the overall size is ideal for even snug fitting jeans, and the weight isn't bad at all.

CCW,3dxyaw,dotMJEG,3,Mon Jul 20 16:20:47 2015 UTC,Some guns prefer slingshot and some slide release's are actually just slide stops/ locks.  At least that's what I've been told on the subject.
CCW,3dxyaw,LilFuniAZNBoi,3,Mon Jul 20 16:59:09 2015 UTC,I keep hearing the slingshotting the slide forward to chamber a round when empty reduces wear and tear on your gun. As such I trained to just rack/slingshot the slide when reloading.   I only use the slide release to move the slide up when you have an empty mag but I usually use my other hand to ease the slide forward softly and not let it slam home due to the recoil spring tension. Or when I want to show off my movie/gaming reloading skills at the range.

I have heard that with some guns, especially those with plastic magazine followers, doing a sling shot on an empty mag increases wear and tear on the mag itself, not the gun.   Every time you load and unload a spring so regardless of the method you are cycling that spring and bringing it one cycle closer to failure."
CCW,3dxyaw,Catbone57,2,Mon Jul 20 17:22:13 2015 UTC,"Using the slide stop as a release puts undue wear and tear on the gun.  One of the smartest things Ruger did in recent years was to design the slide stop control on the LC9 series so it will not even function as a release. We even get bonus entertainment from all the geniuses who post about how they had to ""fix"" the ""defective slide release""."
CCW,3dxyaw,mr1337,2,Mon Jul 20 18:58:03 2015 UTC,"Slingshot, or rather, power stroke. (Using the meat of your palm and wrapping your fingers over the slide, pulling back and releasing.)  Malfunctions are cleared this way, and it uses gross motor skills as opposed to fine motor skills (which will degrade during stress). I gain valuable muscle memory doing both the same way. That, and the slide stop for my Shield is tough, and I don't have the extended slide stop for my Glock 19."

CCW,3dxyaw,qweltor,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:32:09 2015 UTC,"Neither.  Go over the top of the slide with the support hand, putting all of your fingers on firing side of the slide, and the meaty portion of the palm on the support side of the slide.  Squeeze the slide between fingertips and palm, and pull your support hand rearward to your firing side shoulder-joint.  Demo   Support thumb upward to the slide release may be a small target.  Slingshot is small contact surfaces (thumb pad, and top of index finger) trying to find small surfaces on the slide, trying to pinch (which may have limited finger strength)."

The dimensions are almost exactly the same, but the 32 is 2oz lighter, holds 1 more round, and holds open on an empty mag while the 380 does not.  I want something as light as possible that I can actually carry when I go running, and I'm not a fan of blowback guns.

Otherwise I would go with the larger .380, since at low velocities I wouldn't expect either one to expand reliably after going through clothing and possibly plugging, even with premium hollow points."
CCW,3dxyaw,PeanutNore,2,Mon Jul 20 15:04:30 2015 UTC,"If I get the 32, it's definitely going to be loaded with S&B 73gr FMJ - hollow point .32s just do not penetrate far enough in all the reviews I've seen. For .380, I would probably be trying out various JHP loads.   Those Hornady FTX bullets seem to have the controlled expansion down. They've got that polymer plug in the tip so they can't clog. I would carry them in my .38spl, but they are too light at 110gr and hit several inches below POA at 25 feet. I use 125gr XTP instead which work fine with my sights."

CCW,3dxyaw,lazyflounder_,4,Mon Jul 20 23:18:09 2015 UTC,"Hitting the knee requires about a 2 inch grouping.

Center mass is 12""x18"", give or take. Can I hit that when it's coming at me at full speed, and I was hopped up on adrenaline, fearing for my life? Absolutely.   My goal is to stop the immediate, life threatening danger. If my gun comes out at all, shit has already hit the fan in a way that necessitates deadly force. My attacker has already decided that it's him or me. If the threat doesn't require the use of deadly force, your gun shouldn't be out in the first place.  Another problem. A bullet to the knee will not stop an attacker. I work as a trauma therapist, and I volunteer with my county to respond to traumatic events as requested by first responders. I have seen homicide victims make it BLOCKS with mortal wounds. Human beings are TOUGH. I have absolutely no doubt that a person with a bullet in their knee could keep fighting long enough to get a knife in my gut. Hell, a person with a couple hollow points in his gut could still keep fighting long enough to put a knife in my gut.   Basically, if you go for the wound, you're probably going to miss, and that means you're dead. If you hit that person, it's just as likely to stop him as it is to just enrage him. So you go for the biggest thing. Center mass. And you keep firing until he stops coming. Because if you don't, it could cost you your life."

CCW,3dyek6,Kingnahum17,2,Mon Jul 20 20:49:51 2015 UTC,"A good holster (depending on your method of carry) will often have a layer to protect against sweat getting through to your pistol.   I've had a few like this (most are pretty expensive) the latest and favorite so far being the N82 holsters.   As far as getting rid of the rust, grab a brass wire brush and rub it off. It shouldn't harm the pistol as long as there is some sort of coating on it. Most likely it won't harm it anyway since brass is softer than steel.   Afterwards throw a thin layer of CLP over it and let it sit for a bit. Wipe off the excess and carry on.   Typically though, if you carry often it's a good idea to carry a dry pistol (not all CLPed up) so stuff doesn't stick to it and potentially cause problems.

Then after it is dry take a brass or bronze brush and try to scrub off the rust. After rust looks removed clean the firearm again and then coat with your choice of gun oil.   This method worked for me (had a little rust on the slide a few months ago) and a brass or bronze brush won't damage the finish.

There is no reason the M&P FS is not accurate out of the box.  With that said, I shot with my M&P, at the range twice a month, and got better and better.  A year later I did upgrade the trigger, and my shooting saw an instant improvement.  Is that because the factory trigger makes the gun inaccurate, no, it was me not being able to master the factory trigger.  I would just keep practicing.  The two drills that helped me the most:  1) Dry fire tons...make sure those sights are not moving AT ALL as you squeeze that trigger past the break  2) Once you have that mastered, mix in some snap caps in with your regular bullets.  For me (and many others) you will see your live fire trigger pulls are not as good as you dry fire pulls are.  Work on it, focus on being smooth through the break till you live fire (snap cap) pulls look as good as you dry fire ones.  I love my M&P, one of the best guns on the market hands down."

Absolutely look at your holster to make sure it's clear when reholstering.  If there is still a potential threat in the area, WTF are you doing reholstering your weapon?"
CCW,3dxann,slingeronline,4,Mon Jul 20 13:25:58 2015 UTC,It might depend on the instructor. I've had police instructors teach me to never look when holstering. I can understand where they're coming from.
CCW,3dxann,DiscipleOfDrone,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:59:40 2015 UTC,"Right, because police need to reholster to deal with suspects hands-on, so there's still a threat. This isn't typically something CCers need to worry about."

I know Texas is pretty relaxed on the gun rights, but there very well could be some statutes that a prosecutor could get creative with. And if you were charged with criminal assault with a firearm that would be an aggravating factor that probably escalates into the felony level. You risk never being allowed to legally own a firearm again.   The legal definition of assault is   Intentionally putting another person in reasonable apprehension of an imminent harmful or offensive contact.  No intent to cause physical injury needs to exist, and no physical injury needs to result.  So defined in tort law and the criminal statutes of some states.

That said, necessity IS a defense against trespass charges, so....  If I carry against my employers wishes, I may be considered to be trespassing, but as long as they don't know about it, I cannot be prosecuted.  If you did have a SHTF moment at work, and you drew your gun, you could claim that ""Yes, I was trespassing, but it was necessary for the protection of others"".

If you make the decision beforehand to disregard your employer's rules you can't use the defense of necessity. Because there isn't an imminent impending risk to life and limb.    If I carry against my employers wishes, I may be considered to be trespassing, but as long as they don't know about it, I cannot be prosecuted.   Well no, but if for some reason they find out it doesn't mean they can't call the cops to escort you out of the building and otherwise keep the peace. Also like I said above, there's a chance you can be charged with assault in a situation like that. If someone is sufficiently scared by your conduct of having a gun, that very well could be assault. It's a bit of a long shot, but not outside the realm of possibility.   If you did have a SHTF moment at work, and you drew your gun, you could claim that ""Yes, I was trespassing, but it was necessary for the protection of others"".   Yeah it may be a defense against homicide charges, but it wouldn't be a defense to keep your job nor from civil claims arising from anything related to you pulling your gun at work. You can also bet your bottom dollar that the company would do everything in their power to place all liability on you.    Just don't admit to carrying at work everyday, and the burden of proof is on the prosecution to prove you had a gun on the other days.   That's not really a problem though. Because the thing they would prosecute for would be solely arising out of that one instance. You carrying on other days would be irrelevant criminally.   Regardless, you're bound to lose your job."
CCW,3dyq55,pongo000,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:12:00 2015 UTC,"Yes, you are going to lose your job.  The question was about other possible criminal charges.  My TLDR version would be... 1. Yes, you could be charged with trespassing if you got caught carrying a gun after your employer told you not to. 2. If you were forced to pull a gun at work, you could raise necessity as a defense.  If the situation warrants lethal force, then it would most likely fall under imminent impending risk of life and limb."

They are awkward, they put things in childish terms and they are often strange in their approach. Most women just want a solid education when they step onto a range. Sadly, they often do not get it.

I find the best way to get anyone into shooting is to take them to the range with something ""fun"". Whether that's a .22lr ruger 10/22 or something like a 20ga automatic and a bunch of water filled jugs and ballons, who knows.  The harder situation is when it's a significant other who you want to carry to protect themselves. A lot of people are fine committing to a day a fun, where many are not inclined to commit to a lifestyle change.  For that, I don't think there are any easy answers.

Point is that none of that stuff was in question at the time.  It wasn't an issue of intent, but rather self defense, so it seemed odd they were bringing it up at all.  My speculation is that the prosecution was trying to pre-emptively cut off a last minute change by the defense, if they felt they were going to lose, to say 'it was an accident.  I just meant to scare him, I didn't mean to shoot him!'  and lessen the sentencing phase.

CCW,3dvu9r,FrayedString,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:47:57 2015 UTC,This may be worth a read.
CCW,3dvu9r,turbotoast,3,Mon Jul 20 00:05:13 2015 UTC,It was worth a read and thank you for the new information. I did talk with the lawyers about accidents and they did say should you reduce the weight and it accidentally goes off you'd be more fucked than you'd otherwise be but they both agreed that if it's being scrutinized that hard you probably caused serious harm and would only likely get a marginally increased sentence compared to the sentence for causing serious harm by accident with a regular trigger.
CCW,3dvu9r,Mobiasstriptease,3,Mon Jul 20 00:29:51 2015 UTC,"Here's the crux:  In some locales an affirmative defense works only if you can establish that you shot the aggressor deliberately.  (You can't say you accidentally shot someone in self-defense.)  An artificially light trigger pull is a hook the prosecution might use, either to prejudice the less than ideally educated jury into thinking you were making your gun 'extra deadly' or by trying to convert a self-defense acquittal into a manslaughter conviction by arguing the discharge was accidental and therefore, negligent.  It can become an issue that will decide whether or not you go to jail.  Is it likely to?  No, because as a civilian it's very unlikely you will ever clear leather in self-defense in the first place.  I'm not here to tell you what to do.  I just want everyone to make informed decisions, whatever they do."
CCW,3dvu9r,MyNetworkDrives,2,Mon Jul 20 00:32:42 2015 UTC,Would that have to be written into state law specifically that you must establish deliberation? Or are you saying that some counties are writing their own self defense requirements that must be upheld as well as whatever the state law requirement?
CCW,3dvu9r,Mobiasstriptease,2,Mon Jul 20 00:47:49 2015 UTC,Then wouldn't your defense attorney bring up an expert witness who can testify to the fact that trigger jobs are often done to increase accuracy?  And don't we all want anyone who is shooting a gun in self defense to shoot as accurately as possible?  Much better for them to hit the aggressor than an innocent bystander because their trigger pull is too hard.
CCW,3dvu9r,MyNetworkDrives,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:27:10 2015 UTC,Is there a single case in the history of the US where someone was using a firearm in self-defense and the argument of a lighter trigger was used to cause a conviction? I can answer it for you. No.
CCW,3dvu9r,Mobiasstriptease,2,Mon Jul 20 03:04:47 2015 UTC,"NY v. Magliato, And in Canada there was Crown v. Gossett."
CCW,3dvu9r,lookatmycoolusername,3,Mon Jul 20 14:46:13 2015 UTC,"Attorney here. NY v. Magliato was an unusual case. The summary: Frank Magliato got into a traffic altercation with another man in which the other man brandished a nightstick. However there was no actual fight. Magliato drove away, got his revolver, and returned to where the man was parked. Magliato drew his revolver, pointed it at the man, cocked the hammer, and fired. The victim was hit once in the head and died.  Magliato claimed that this was an unintentional shooting. According to him, a car passed by unexpectedly and caused him to pull the trigger. The lightness of the trigger was used by Magliato as an excuse; he tried to say that pulling the gun was justified, and that discharging the gun was a mistake. This is a bad argument for obvious reasons and got him convicted.  But keep in mind, this was not a case in which he was arguing that the shooting was justified. In fact, he was claiming that it was a mistake. Also, his gun was not modified. The lightness of the trigger was due to the cocked hammer. This sets it apart from a typical self-defense case.  I've personally never heard of a case where a modified trigger pull made a difference, except in a case where the shooting was claimed to be a mistake.  My understanding is that Crown v. Gossett is basically the same thing: another unintended shooting. Yes, trigger pull may matter if it's an unintentional shooting. But not in a typical SD situation."
CCW,3dvu9r,freedoomed,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:41:25 2015 UTC,"As an attorney, you would definitely know more than me about law. So you would obviously know that for the everyday person such as myself, just being within our rights is sometimes not good enough. Just because I acted lawfully doesn't stop the prosecuting attorney from making it seem like I didn't. You're probably right that having a lightened trigger wouldn't get me convicted of anything that I wouldn't have been convicted of without that evidence.... But why take that chance?  For reference, here are a few more cases where light trigger pulls were objects of accusation to the defendant: Florida v. Alvarez, Michigan v. Chase, Georgia v. Crumbley"

I'm not a fan of securing to the bike, because if you hit a bump/tree branch/squirrel, or someone knocks you off, etc. you're now separated from your gun.  I will carry in a small pouch attached to the shoulder strap of my backpack, sometimes IWB, sometimes both. Usually something small like a P32 or NAA Guardian or NAA Mini .22mag.  My NAA Guardian came with a Bulldog zipped pouch with a pocket for a spare magazine, I use that a lot. I've also used a small leather holster concealed by a piece of cloth - looks like I tied a handkerchief on to the strap.  I CC though, not  open.

I have carried the P32 in my pocket, on my shoulder, and IWB. In the pocket of the particular shorts I wear would be a ""excuse me while I whip this out"" sort of thing.  I use any excuse I can to buy a weapon. Moving to a state where there are about a dozen pigs? Time for a 1911 with Buffalo Bore hardcast. It's my birthday?

CCW,3dvth4,myccwacc,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:31:19 2015 UTC,"I wanted to do the same thing. I'm not in Ohio, but NC has fairly similar rules with open/concealed carry (OC at 18, CC at 21 with permit, etc).  So a few months before I turned 21, I called up a store which offered the concealed carry course asking them the same thing. Obviously completely unfamiliar with the law, the person on the phone told me that since you have to be 21 to possess/open carry a pistol (which is not true), I would not be able to legally take the live-fire training part of the course. I corrected the person on the phone stating the law was anyone could open carry as long as they did not have rights revoked and were 18 or older. He then told me that regardless of the law, they would not allow me to take their course before I turned 21.  I then looked up some more instructors in my area and called a private instructor. He told me that he would be fine with me attending his course as long as I was familiar with firearms and met the requirements of the CC permit other than the age.  I actually never ended up taking it until after I had turned 21 due to other unrelated things, but it seems like the instructor would have been fine with me doing it at 20 anyways.  I'm not an expert on Ohio law, but it looks like Ohio has no actual age requirements for the course, but just for obtaining the license:  (G)  (1) Each course, class, or program described in division (B)(3)(a), (b), (c), or (e) of this section shall provide to each person who takes the course, class, or program the web site address at which the pamphlet prepared by the Ohio peace officer training commission pursuant to section 109.731 of the Revised Code that reviews firearms, dispute resolution, and use of deadly force matters may be found. Each such course, class, or program described in one of those divisions shall include at least eight hours of training in the safe handling and use of a firearm that shall include training, provided as described in division (G)(3) of this section, on all of the following:  (a)  The ability to name, explain, and demonstrate the rules for safe handling of a handgun and proper storage practices for handguns and ammunition;  (b) The ability to demonstrate and explain how to handle ammunition in a safe manner;  (c) The ability to demonstrate the knowledge, skills, and attitude necessary to shoot a handgun in a safe manner;  (d) Gun handling training ;  (e) A minimum of two hours of in-person training that consists of range time and live-fire training.  (2) To satisfactorily complete the course, class, or program described in division (B)(3)(a), (b), (c), or (e) of this section, the applicant shall pass a competency examination that shall include both of the following:  (a) A written section, provided as described in division (G)(3) of this section, on the ability to name and explain the rules for the safe handling of a handgun and proper storage practices for handguns and ammunition;  (b) An in-person physical demonstration of competence in the use of a handgun and in the rules for safe handling and storage of a handgun and a physical demonstration of the attitude necessary to shoot a handgun in a safe manner.

(b) Except as otherwise provided in this division, the written section of the competency examination specified in division (G)(2)(a) of this section shall be administered to the person taking the competency examination in person by an instructor. If the training specified in division (G)(1)(a) of this section is provided to the person receiving the training by a course, class, or program described in division (B)(3)(a) of this section, or it is provided by a course, class, or program described in division (B)(3)(b), (c), or (e) of this section and the instructor is a qualified instructor certified by a national gun advocacy organization, the written section of the competency examination specified in division (G)(2)(a) of this section may be administered online, as long as the online training includes an interactive component that regularly engages the person.

In the best case scenario nothing will happen, in the worst case scenario they call the cops and you are issued a citation."

What if an attacker sees you bring a gun in and decides your TV isn't worth getting shot. Mind you, criminals, in an interstate survey, said they feared civilians with a gun more than cops. I would still say that the 0.1% is significant. It's estimated that 200,000 people get raped every year. 0.1% is 200 fewer victims. Sounds like a good thing to me.

CCW,3dsee2,drebinf,10,Sun Jul 19 01:18:59 2015 UTC,"The problem with this study is that it doesn't control for all the variables: the type of attack faced, whether the attackers were armed, the number of attackers, or the threat posed by the attackers.  Consider this passage: ""The study found that in incidents where a victim used a gun in self-defense, the likelihood of suffering an injury was 10.9 percent. Had the victim taken no action at all, the risk of injury was virtually identical: 11 percent.""  Legitimate use a firearm in self defense (in most states) requires there be a significant risk of death or personal injury, and disproportionality of force between the victim and attacker.  From that alone, we might suppose that the DGUs used in this study represented victims facing more powerful attackers, and inherently more dangerous situations (since they already feared death or serious injury) in order to use their firearm in self defense.  Therefore those who didn't resist at all were likely in less dire circumstances than those who had to use a gun in self defense.  If, on the other hand, they controlled for similar situations, such as ""all cases where a weaker victim faced a single determined rapist armed with a knife"" and they analyzed outcomes between armed resistance, and unarmed resistance, I think we would see a very clear difference in the outcomes."

I sourced the technical document for the NVCS which is where they are getting their numbers from. The first one really makes me raise questions about their survey population and distribution. The population is incorrectly skewed towards white males and females. Hispanics are barely (so small % that it is not even mentioned) represented and blacks represent only about 4% of the target population which does not even close to reflect the general population especially of an urban center which is where apparently 45% of their sampling occurred. Where are they doing these interviews? New Hampshire?  Second, they only count uses in which the defensive use resulted in a death. This omits perfectly reasonable, and frankly more likely, scenarios such as wounding, fleeing, or holding at gunpoint until law enforcement arrives.  Their conclusion, to me, is based on a statistical population that doesn't really bear much resemblance to the country we live in and in events that aren't really the most likely events to happen in a DGU."

CCW,3dsee2,Bulletproofmonk,5,Sun Jul 19 06:55:06 2015 UTC,"Bending stats:   Having a gun also didn’t reduce the likelihood of losing property: 38.5 percent of those who used a gun in self-defense had property taken from them, compared to 34.9 percent of victims who used another type of weapon, such as a knife or baseball bat.   This compares carrying a gun with carrying another weapon; this fails to address the percentage of people who lose things when not carrying a weapon.    What’s more, the study found that while the likelihood of injury after brandishing a firearm was reduced to 4.1 percent, the injury rate after those defensive gun uses was similar to using any other weapon (5.3 percent), and was still greater than if the person had run away or hid (2.4 percent) or called the police (2.2 percent).    This fails to consider what percentage of people actually manage to run away, hide, or call the police. There's a decently high chance that the criminal will not allow you to do any of these things.   One male respondent who reported a defensive gun use described an incident as follows: “I was watching a movie and he interrupted me. I yelled at him that I was going to shoot him and he ran to his car.”       I can hear the straw rustle in this strawman.   Any survey, no matter how well designed, will produce a final estimate that is much higher than its true incidence because of false positives.

A substantial number of valid DGUs will still be under investigation in that time span. No victim who spoke to a lawyer would ever answer honestly to that survey.

What they don't tell you is that their 4.1% figure is not statistically significant so it's meaningless, that almost 3 times as many people (11%) were injured for doing nothing/keeping still as after attempting to defend themselves with a gun, and that even if that 4.1% figure were statistically significant it's still notably lower than most other things.

It's just incredibly unlikely because we all know some things require more effort and knowledge than others. So the people that did that work would want and deserve more.  In general, communist ideas are very applicable to industrial economies. Where everyone is producing tangible goods that they want reward for. In a service based economy, communism is impossible.

These are all things that I have seen being taken out of the barracks during inspections.  I also had to restrain a guy in my unit that went out to his truck and grabbed his 1911 because he wanted to kill his room mate. We are not the responsible bunch you people think we are. We are a bunch of kids that drink way to much and don't thing about the consequences.  There is a reason why we can't have guns in the barracks. Right after I got back from Iraq in 2007 the unit returned about a month later and they were across the street from my unit. I was in the catwalk smoking and a sudden bang rings out. A Sergeant shot a Lance Corporal in the face with his 1911 killing the Lcpl immediately. He was drunk and playing with his gun.  Barracks are not the places for guns and I feel the currant gun policy on base is fine.   Yes we are trained for combat and proficient in handling firearms.

I don't think you have the slightest fucking clue, or most of the people in this subreddit.  When we go ANYWHERE with weapons, ammo, and equipment, there is strict accountability. Did Pvt Fucknuts lose his NVG's on the hike? Guess what, we're turning everyone around to go find them. Everything to the last round is accounted for at all times.   There is no accountability for private firearms.   Under this scenario where we let anyone carry on base:  Anyone with access can walk into a SCIF with a loaded weapon.

In fact every base I have been to has been in a bad part of town. So basically when I am most likely to need my weapon I am not allowed to have it. Yes we have armed guards but that hasn't stopped people from jumping the fence and breaking into base housing or robbing the gas station.   I am not asking to carry while I'm working.

That being said there is no way the military is going to allow its Joes to carry their personal firearms in garrison.  The best we can hope for is that the brass will allow Commanders more freedom to allow their Soldiers to carry issued weapons.  This should take care of any security problems.

There definitely aren't any secure storage facilities in the building where worked where I'd keep my gun in at work if I had to take it off... well there was the COMSEC vault, but lots of people have access to that.  I can also see problems with the idea of uniformed soldiers being armed with non-standard firearms, especially if they're using expanding ammunition. What's the difference between a soldier with his issued M9 outside his shirt in a drop holster, or his Glock inside his shirt in an Aliengear?  I think the whole thing will be a bit of a clusterfuck and the Pentagon will freak the fuck out, but the first priority should be just letting people bring guns and ammo on base and storing them in their car. There should be zero restrictions on that."

Keeping in mind that the up/down vote arrows aren't meant to be agree/disagree mechanisms, should there be any concerns of:  1) Having armed military on American soil.  2) Having armed members of the military be able to carry under more conditions and in more places than civilians.  I say this as someone who is skeptical of government and has, in my lifetime (most of ours probably) seen enough evidence that knee-jerk reactions that extend federal powers in the name of safety often do so at the expense of freedom. I was also someone who was neutral on LEOSA on the grounds that while it was nice to have cops carrying guns in more places, I felt other civilians (under the pre-9/11 definition of the word) should too. While it's clear that emotions are running high right now, I'm just trying to ask all the questions while it's feasible to do so."
CCW,3dopge,Suckat3,4,Sat Jul 18 16:30:42 2015 UTC,"1) Having armed military on American soil.   If the government were to want to do something nefarious, arming the military is a matter of walking into the armory. The military is already armed on American soil, just not immediately so. I don't think the difference between stored in a holster and stored in an armory is such a massive obstacle to hypothetical tyrants. If anything, it better protects us because the weapons are under the control of individual soldiers as opposed to the armorer, his military superiors, and their government superiors. In the completely hypothetical, outlandish scenario of members of the military or government breaking their oath and using force against civilians, far better to have good soldiers with guns as opposed to good soldiers locked out of the armory by their superiors. I don't believe I'll ever see something like that in my lifetime but since you asked..."
CCW,3dopge,MuddyWaterTeamster,2,Sat Jul 18 17:04:34 2015 UTC,The first thing you see driving up to an Air Force base is armed military. We already have armed military on U.S. soil.

For example, if I jumped out of my car and tried to direct traffic or something while in uniform, it's not like people would have to listen to me. Also, the police would show up in short order and tell me to stop.   And on the other hand, concealed is concealed. The public wouldn't be any more aware of us carrying in uniform than they would notice us carrying out of uniform. And honestly, I think the majority of the public just assumes that we're armed all the time anyways. A common comment that pops up in these discussions is ""wow, I always thought soldiers could carry all the time.""    It's like the teacher ccw arguments. No one is proposing to arm all teachers- just the ones who already train and carry. Soldiers/airmen who already carry would/should be allowed to carry on base.   I find it similar to how the military treats motorcycles on base. They are absolutely, objectively dangerous. So they make us take a bunch of training before we can ride on base.

In the Marine Corps we are taught to shoot the M16A4, but most of the time spent with the weapon is doing drill with it, not shooting them. For jobs thay don't require a weapon we only shoot annually.   The training is designed for the lowest common denominator. What you civilians deem ""training"" is really showing that you're proficient enough to not shoot your own dick off. The training is a check in the box. Unless your job is to employ that weapon system, you're just merely qualed on it.  So again, arm NCO's and officers with M9's while on duty. Not fucking hard. Beef up the camp guard.

Military leadership is often great at tactics and warfighting because after the last 2 wars we have great people with great experience but they are by no means all knowing and they are not fit to say that troops that are normal people that just happen to want to serve their country should be stripped of a basic RIGHT for the privilege to serve.

Did the OP misunderstand the bill? The wiki summary seems to match what he said. Why was he mistaken?"

CCW,3dtsc5,ffiarpg,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:04:55 2015 UTC,"Posse Comitatus doesn't enter into it.  What law enforcement powers and duties are they being granted that civilians are not?  We're talking about the ability to carry on military bases, not the ability for a group of Joes to use a M1511 to pull people over off-base and place them under arrest or issue citations."
CCW,3dtsc5,valarmorghulis,0,Mon Jul 20 02:56:43 2015 UTC,"Yes, we are talking about carrying on military bases, right now. But the entire point of this post, valid or not, is to not allow this to turn into allowing military personnel to carry in places where citizens cannot. Basically, make sure that if we improve carry rights for soliders, do not allow them to exceed the rights of civilians. They should be equal."
CCW,3dtsc5,ffiarpg,2,Mon Jul 20 05:59:51 2015 UTC,"Okay.  That still has nothing to do with enforcing laws, so Posse Comitatus doesn't even begin to be a factor here.  Your explanation of OP's argument logic makes me think this is just a troll, because it is literally the stupidest thing I've ever read.  It's like saying I am legally required to allow anybody to come on my property armed if I myself am armed.  After all, we can't allow landowner rights exceed those of the non land-owning."
CCW,3dtsc5,valarmorghulis,1 point,Mon Jul 20 06:34:15 2015 UTC,"Please correct me if I am wrong but this is how I understand it. Right now we have essentially two tiers of gun rights. Law enforcement with the most and citizens with less. Generally the military has the same rights as citizens as far as gun rights on domestic soil. I believe OPs point is that we shouldn't allow military gun rights to exceed citizen gun rights on domestic soil just because of a kneejerk reaction to this event. That would put military closer to law enforcement which is why he brought up Posse Comitatus. Your analogy isn't valid because it is attempting to use ""my argument"" to change the status quo rather than keep it the same, among other reasons."
CCW,3dtsc5,ffiarpg,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:36:56 2015 UTC,"We aren't talking about rights.  We are talking about permission.  Military installations are not public property, and the military, like any other group, has the right to dictate what anybody may or may not do on property they control and are responsible for.  If the issue starts being about what the military can do and carry off base now we are getting into the area of law enforcement.    It is worth noting that Posse Comitatus only explicitly applies to the US Army and Air Force (being a derivative of the Army).  The Navy and Marines are told to follow it by standing directive of the Secretary of Defense.  It does not apply to the Coast Guard, nor does it apply to the National Guard as long as they are called up by the state governor.  If they are marshaled by the POTUS, they are then part of the US Army and they must abide by Posse Comitatus.  Further it would stand that even if they were granted permission to carry live and armed weapon systems down city streets it could not run afoul of Posse Comitatus if they aren't doing so to enforce laws.  TL;DR - the military having toys the rest of us can't have in no way shape or form involves them acting as law enforcement -- especially when such possession is confined to their own property."

CCW,3dtsc5,ffiarpg,5,Mon Jul 20 19:09:56 2015 UTC,"Of all of the places that can actually enforce gun-restrictions, military installations are one of the few areas that make sense to restrict firearms. Most have their own police forces, security, and secured entrances-- they also tend to home an significant amount of dangerous and otherwise restricted equipment. There are other concerns like Inconsistent state laws (especially when moving between states) and high mental stresses (on members and their families).   That being said, they shouldn't make carry impossible. Training and policy can be used to minimize the risks and ensure-- and that's what we encourage. That's far different from allowing all military members, civilians (with inconsistent training regarding inconsistent laws) on more secure property.  tl;dr  Don't just allow everyone to carry, allow/encourage/force the military to set policies regarding safe carry."
CCW,3dtsc5,UnordinaryAmerican,2,Sun Jul 19 13:10:51 2015 UTC,"I work on a base and ""secured entrance"" is relative. If you have a military ID, you can pretty much drive up to, and through, the checkpoint with ease. Vehicle searches are random and sparse.

CCW,3dtsc5,moving0target,2,Sun Jul 19 15:52:33 2015 UTC,"Even though you're just checking for IDs, the installation still has its own armed personal-- both of those make the base significantly more secure than nearly every other gun-free zone.

They're looking out for the base."
CCW,3dtsc5,ereldar,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:04:22 2015 UTC,"Let me try putting it another way: In this one case, the state-laws are not enough (increasingly relevant as more states adopt constitutional carry). Carry should be allowed, but (in this one case) it shouldn't just a ""remove the gun-free zone.""   If it wasn't clear already, I'd like to point out that this reasoning did not apply to the recruitment center.  The 'secured entrance' is still an important part of the reasoning. Most other gun-free zones don't meet one or more of the reasons I gave out-- especially the secured entrance/border."
CCW,3dtsc5,UnordinaryAmerican,0,Sun Jul 19 18:38:15 2015 UTC,Civilians have their own armed personnel as well.   They're called police.   Perhaps we should take guns away from civilians too.
CCW,3dtsc5,mcflyjr,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:52:06 2015 UTC,"1: I'm not saying to take the guns away-- I'm just saying that we should push/encourage sane policies rather than just removing a restriction and hoping state laws are enough. The state laws are not sufficient (nor should they expected to be) on a military base.  2: the armed personal are only a factor in the overall reasoning. The equipment, the difference in on-premises security, the people allowed on base, the inconsistent state laws, and the known career risks.  3: Civilian police != Military Police. Maybe if the border of muncipalties was as secure... or checked for IDs/backgrounds, or mandated car searches, or had as rigorous training, or were active military bases with military equipment. Should we just store important/powerful/sensitive military equipment outside the U.S to keep it secure? It seems much better to allow the military to set their own rules. (And again, I must point out-- I'm not saying those rules have to be to ban all weapons, but rather the state laws are not enough)."

CCW,3dtsc5,rdkitchens,2,Sun Jul 19 12:34:34 2015 UTC,"Military bases are federal land.  The only people allowed to carry a gun on federal land are people specifically licensed to do so, law enforcement agents at the various federal alphabet soup agencies.  FBI, DHS, CIA, etc, and base security for obvious reasons.  Military personnel do not fall under this aegis."

CCW,3dtsc5,Semper_OFP,3,Sun Jul 19 13:02:19 2015 UTC,"First and foremost, they were attacked outside of any military installation. Neither the reserve center nor recruiting office had any security. Even if they had been armed it appears that it was a driveby and they were fucked anyways.  The security concerns of allowing private firearms to be carried on base vary by branch. In the Marine Corps it's issues with barracks life and the impact on safety while training. The Navy and Air Force? Lack of any training, but more importantly the nature of their work. Unaccounted for guns on flight lines, SCIFs, near subs or carriers? Yeah, no.  I think a reasonable step for force protection would be to allow people who commute onto base to have some sort of solution so they aren't disarmed while off base.  Military bases are not completely disarmed though. You are allowed to keep firearms on base housing. Just not the barracks and for good reason."
CCW,3dqhmv,Lusorious,5,Sat Jul 18 13:43:50 2015 UTC,Neither are correct with factory sights(and most matched sets of aftermarket sights) unless you're shooting something like an HK.

CCW,3dqhmv,GarthVolbeck,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:32:12 2015 UTC,I think it depends on the handgun manufacturer. On my handguns (HKs) POA is POI as the factory default is cover up hold where the aiming point is the front sight dot (your dad's way).

CCW,3dqhmv,geoffist,0,Sun Jul 19 04:54:36 2015 UTC,"It depends on the distance your sights are set up for.   As far as pure performance...in a precision shooting situation, either ""center hold"" or ""deep six hold"" works best, and the difference is one of preference. In a center hold the top center of your front sight is exactly in line with your target. In a deep six hold, the top center of your front sight is significantly below the center of your target.   For speed, it works best to have a FO, tfo, tritium, or colored dot somewhere ON your front sight post and to cover your target with the dot.   All assume correct sight alignment separate from where you're pointing.   All of them are only absolutely correct at 2 specific distances (one while the bullet is rising from the barrel pointing slightly up from horizontal, one once it falls to the same height).   So, it depends on what your sights are set up for. If they're stock, the manual should say which one is correct. If not, talk to whoever installed or sold them for/to you. Or, you can just shoot groups and figure it out.   Out to 10 or 15 yards, the differences shouldn't be big."
CCW,3dqhmv,moostapha,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:47:53 2015 UTC,"It depends on the manufacturer of the sights/ firearm.

Unfortunately, the state knows, no only that I have a permit, but my exact weapon and serial number.  Dad has a C&R license so, when he gave me the pistol, we went through transfer paperwork since he wasn't sure he could just give me the handgun.

Lethal force would probably have been excessive here. I regularly carry a knife when I ride, but definitely would not have brought that into a scenario like this, nor a gun. I'd say the man seemed visibly ""fucked up"" on something though (those pupils!). The biker handled it perfectly. As much as you'd want to beat someone up after they punch you and assault your passenger (who has no control over the driver), you'd probably regret it afterwards. A ""what the hell is wrong with you?"" and a ""act your age"" really does go a long way.  Also, if you ride, wear a gopro (or competitor)! This video shows exactly why they're important.

CCW,3dnu8b,spacedicksastronaut,11,Sat Jul 18 07:34:29 2015 UTC,"As much as I hate to admit it I'd probably have hit him a bunch of times once he was on the ground until he stopped trying to get up.  That biker has a lot more patience when being assaulted than I do and have in the past.  It is hard to say if I'd have drawn, I don't think so since he was an old man and went down like nothing.  And his punches hadn't hurt the biker yet so I doubt I'd be scared enough for my safety at that point (being in top and all) to where I'd need to draw.  But I sure wouldn't have been as gentle about keeping him on the ground.   Kudos to the biker for keeping his cool.  I would not think it wrong to have drawn after the very first punch and if the biker did I'd be fine with that and support him.  A lot of people haven't been in physical fights or trained in some sort of fighting method and if they don't want to chance the uncertainties and high risk that comes from fighting hand-to-hand with a stranger that is totally legit and drawing there is 110% valid in my opinion.  But I'd really really rather break a guy's nose to stop him than shoot him and I'm not sure that guy would have backed off for a gun.  He seemed pretty tweaked on something."

CCW,3dnu8b,KeithKilgore,10,Fri Jul 17 21:13:32 2015 UTC,For the record: It seems it would be technically fine to use lethal force in Florida.  776.013 (1) (a). The guy tried to force him off his bike. Castle doctine applies here. Not sure what I would have done though in this situation. Maybe tried to escape when the guy got out of his car?
CCW,3dnu8b,G19Gen3,6,Fri Jul 17 20:05:13 2015 UTC,"In hindsight he didn't need it but I think he would have been justified in drawing, possibly. The assailant isn't a small person and he's behaving super aggressively in the middle of traffic. You can die from a ""good"" punch."
CCW,3dnu8b,archaeoholic,-1,Fri Jul 17 21:58:13 2015 UTC,"Yeah, you can, but it would be difficult to justify shooting a man out of fear of being punched while wearing a helmet and armor rated for impact."

CCW,3dnu8b,psykikduk,2,Fri Jul 17 22:54:13 2015 UTC,Technically fine and the smart thing to do (in this case) are different.  Ideally you'd want to try and diffuse the situation without adding the factor of a weapon into the game.

If it was me and I was in the exact situation and was carrying, once I tell him to calm down and relax and try to keep him back, if he kept charging at me, I probably would have drawn and tell him to stand back. If I didn't draw at that point, I would have when he put his hands on my wife. It is honestly hard to say, I don't know if the guy would have followed any orders to chill out with a gun drawn on him if he was drunk or on drugs. The guy looked confused when he was on the ground like he was angry but also wondering wtf was going on at the same time."

Usually it ends up being pretty close, which is good. Need to remember to try it at the range sometime to actually see where my shots end up."

CCW,3dnuom,GarthVolbeck,3,Fri Jul 17 21:53:01 2015 UTC,I have one for .380 (on sale on Amazon last year for 40 bucks!) and so far it's great.  Combined with the free ShootOFF software it turned my fridge and living room into a 25 foot home range.  The only downside is the cat goes apeshit when she sees the lasers resulting in everything being knocked off the fridge.  It fits my 9mm but is off by quite a bit compared to when it's in a .380 (where it seems almost dead on).
CCW,3dnuom,Thisismygunaccount,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:00:44 2015 UTC,I have a feeling if you're in a situation where you're about to shoot you won't be thinking about getting the sights lined up. It would probably be more of an adrenaline charged fumbling where your mind is moving faster than your body and you're doing all that you can to get the gun up and the trigger pulled. And as a side note i found it pretty surprising how easy it was to hit targets shooting from the hip with a shotgun or 22.
CCW,3dnuom,arnoldrew,2,Fri Jul 17 23:06:56 2015 UTC,"If you train to use the sights, you'll use the sights, and hit more often to boot."
CCW,3dnuom,Manly-man,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:53:09 2015 UTC,I learned to shoot this way as a kid. I would sit on the back porch and pop dragon flies mid flight wroth my Red Ryder just by looking at what I wanted to shoot. It just takes practice to hone the skill and apply it to a handgun.
CCW,3dnuom,I922sParkCir,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:07:37 2015 UTC,There are trainers that will put black electrical tape on there students guns to show them how little they have to use the sights. It's often surprising.  Even if we don't focus on the sights I believe we still line up the rear and muzzle of the gun in our peripheral vision.
CCW,3dnuom,moostapha,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:18:50 2015 UTC,"It's called point shooting, and it works depending on the distance.   The whole thing is that you need to see a good enough sight picture to break the shot accurately.   Assuming you're shooting at an adult human or similarly sized target...  A 1 yard, that might be the gun in your peripheral vision.   At 3 yards, that might mean seeing metal between you and it.   At 5 yards, that might mean seeing the rear profile of the slide.   At 10 yards, it probably means a good sight picture.   Go read ""practical shooting: beyond fundamentals"" for a more thorough explanation. It's focused on competition, but it's applicable to self defense.   Suffice it to say that on fast, close-enough competition stages, someone could change the color of my dot or fo front, and I could clean the stage without noticing. A big part of running a gun quickly is leaning what sight picture you need for different targets.   Travis Haley's video on his venti 100 shot wake up drill also discusses this and incorporates 2 different sight pictures for 30 of the shots."
CCW,3dnuom,moving0target,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:57:00 2015 UTC,"Draw.  Aim.  Repeat several times.  Close your eyes.  Draw.  Aim.  Open your eyes.  Are you still on target?  Most likely.  SEALs use this technique.  Considering possible collateral damage, I'd prefer to, at least, use my from sight.  Dunno if it's different for the tiny sidearms (not denigrating) this sub seems to prefer, but carrying a full frame seems to make this easier."

At 4 o'clock the super mojo made the holster so thick at the muzzle end it was uncomfortable. It was easily over a 1/2"" thicker than my other kydex holster. The regular mojo clip was better but still the clip made it uncomfortable. A friend has one for a G19/26 and finds it comfortable for short periods but uncomfortable for all day.  I will say it did tuck the gun in closer to my side a little better which made it better with some t-shirts."

CCW,3dn1uw,tubadude2,6,Fri Jul 17 16:38:34 2015 UTC,"I am from NC and will be moving to CA this fall! I don't know of any unfriendly counties, I got my CCH in Wake County without any trouble. It did take about 90 days for it to arrive though. I know people have gotten them faster since then though. I am sure it may vary some county to county. NC is very gun friendly in my experience. What do I need to know about getting a CCH in CA?"
CCW,3dn1uw,Gotskilla,6,Fri Jul 17 16:37:05 2015 UTC,"It very much depends on the counties. Most of Northern CA and northern coast are very easy, San Francisco is impossible, and various states between for most of the central/southern counties. County Sheriff sets ALL rules and approvals outside of the state legislation.  For example, I live in Placer County, part of the major Sacramento area, and a good number of permits are approved here, though you need to submit a little more than a pure 'self-defense' line. Our CCW is limited to 3 pistols, between .25-.45 caliber, no single-shot registered weapons (a popular loophole to purchase new off-roster pistols which was legislated away on Jan 1st 2015). Another rule, for example, is that the bearer cannot 'Possess weapon any place where prohibited by law or sign'. Oh, and the pistols need to be registered by the DOJ, which is something you'd do these days at time of purchase, but is not a requirement for inherited pistols.  My primary suggestion is to purchase your weapon(s) before you move. Anything that is not on-roster in California can only be purchased through a private party. While I would never advocate buying weapons simply to sell them, be aware a lot of guns that are available to you will fetch around 150-200% their value priced new on the California market. The way the law is designed, as of several years ago to qualify for roster the guns need to have a loaded chamber indicator, magazine lock, and a manual safety. As of last year, they now must include microstamping, which effectively means no more factory-new pistol models will be approved for sale. Pistols without these endearing qualities will fetch a higher interest and value on the used market. Newer model/Gen 4 Glocks are particularly sought, and unfired is a selling point plus.  Also be aware of the 10-round mag limit and the fact that it is illegal to import these pistol or rifle magazines into the state. Meaning you cannot bring any of your 'high capacity' magazines with you, nor any magazines 'blocked' to accept only a maximum 10 rounds, nor the blocking kits themselves. None of these can be legally purchased in CA anymore. The only legal 'blocked' magazines are those manufactured & pre-blocked by the original gun manufacturer (as far as I am aware), and any that were in your possession before the ban. These cannot legally be given, sold, or crafted in any manner."
CCW,3dn1uw,dayz2gunz,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:16:05 2015 UTC,Sorry do you have the ca penal code section that refers to laws and signs prohibiting carry I was under the impression signs did not hold force of law in CA.
CCW,3dn1uw,dayz2gunz,3,Fri Jul 17 17:29:57 2015 UTC,"This is not a law from a CA penal code, it is a restriction from the Placer County Sheriff's Office. The text preceeding the rules state 'Failure of the permit holder to adhere to any of the following restrictions will result in the revocation of the concealed weapon(s) permit'. (See 'What Restrictions...' on this page: http://www.placer.ca.gov/departments/sheriff/concealed-weapon-permits/ccwfaq)  I've read an argument where someone says these restrictions don't hold the weight of law. I'm not going to be the one to test them, get my permit yanked, and take the issue to court, as the law does pretty clearly state the Sheriff is the issuing authority and has the power to permit CCL."

Unless the IA specifically states it one does not have to adhere to ""no firearms"" signs.

CCW,3dn1uw,Raymendles,2,Sun Jul 19 18:41:30 2015 UTC,For me it was a long process in CA about 18 months start to finish. I have heard that it is slowly getting better. Just be prepared to jump through some hoops as far as paper work and time go and it really varies on the county. Some CA counties are still trying to hold on to good cause bs but they are slowly becoming the minority.

Never mind that for most of them it is their duty, and on Naval Station Mayport, at least, many did keep weapons in on base housing or in their vehicles.

There are a lot of NDs that occur the first month or so of deployment, purely because most people don't have the experience that they should have. You can easily go a year without touching a firearm in the Army.  Probably more, if you work a bit.

The civilian world has success stories as well (Daniel Defense, Geissele) all things that wouldn't happen if we didn't have such a big gun culture.    Look at countries like France/Germany where decisions are made by politicians that know nothing about weaponry and the general public knows nothing about why those decisions are dumb.

If more citizens might have a gun, a robber will probably use a gun rather than a knife or other ""less deadly"" weapon. The article fails to mention whether the overall crime rate decreased in places with high rates of ccw ownership and focuses solely on crimes involving a firearm, which would be expected to increase.

What effect do they have other than discourage people who follow the rules, respect the law and other people and their property from the ability to defend themselves should they so choose?

CCW,3diw4m,Moscamst,9,Sat Jul 18 23:53:50 2015 UTC,An ISIS inspired attack isn't that unheard of.  Just last week someone was arrested after obtaining firearms in preparation for an ISIS inspired attacked in Massachusetts.
CCW,3diw4m,Wanhope,2,Thu Jul 16 19:07:37 2015 UTC,"just not wantonly speculate   How is it wantonly speculating after they have made countless threats to all kinds of targets just like this, and after there have been attacks that they claimed responsibility and/ or were motivation in some capacity for said attack?  I think that's the reason you are getting flak."
CCW,3diw4m,SmithWessonMP,13,Thu Jul 16 18:06:20 2015 UTC,"Well, ISIS apparently tweeted a warning and the shooter's name is Muhammad Youssef Abdulazeez... so... yeah..."

CCW,3diw4m,derrick81787,5,Thu Jul 16 23:28:39 2015 UTC,It's the government policy to post those signs. They were renting the building.
CCW,3diw4m,Kmac7994,5,Fri Jul 17 00:42:43 2015 UTC,Then sue the government.
CCW,3diw4m,arnoldrew,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:11:44 2015 UTC,"That actually might be a more successful option. It could easily be argued that property rights are important and give a business owner the right to ban guns at his business. However, due to the fact that this is government property, this is not a property rights issue. This is the government banning effective self defense (a human right) by infringing on the right to bear arms (a Constitutional right), which federal courts have confirmed extend to the right to carry guns outside of the home.  It doesn't just concern the military, either. Civilians might have been, and often are, at recruitment centers. One could argue that the military has the authority to disarm their own members, but here the government also disarmed civilians.  It would be a long shot because I don't imagine the federal government would be eager to limit its own authority, but I could see how such a case might have a chance."
CCW,3diw4m,Kmac7994,2,Thu Jul 16 21:42:57 2015 UTC,"I feel lucky that my state allows us to carry on installations with proper notification to our chain of command. If only that policy were nation wide, and gun free zones didn't exist, maybe we won't have to keep seeing this on the news so often.   A sign clearly doesn't change a criminals mind."
CCW,3diw4m,arnoldrew,2,Thu Jul 16 23:50:19 2015 UTC,"Local commanders don't ban it anyway? Everywhere I've always been, it's the local commander's regulation that bans concealed carry. I've heard it's backed up by federal law, which would apply in any state including yours, but never found the details regarding that."
CCW,3diw4m,Kmac7994,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:41:27 2015 UTC,There was a memorandum written up the the TAG allowing it on post or armories. It may only apply to the guard installations.
CCW,3diw4m,qweltor,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:43:08 2015 UTC,"I guess your armories/posts/whatevers aren't federal installations, are they?"
CCW,3diw4m,Kmac7994,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:08:18 2015 UTC,They are state.
CCW,3diw4m,peepingt0m,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:06:30 2015 UTC,"It may only apply to the guard installations.    The TAG is the senior National Guardsman in the state, and can write the policies for NG armories, etc.  Fort Bliss (for example) is federal.  It's all Army/Military, but the Federal vs. State part gets...um, complicated."

It's mostly single, junior enlisted. Unlike college the occupants do not pay to live in their housing.   Barracks are a fucking madhouse of drinking and fucking around to a level that only the rowdiest of rowdy college dorms could aspire to.  Hyper aggressive young men, alcohol, no women, and firearms do not mix. That is aside from the suicide concerns.  Unrestricted access to firearms also plays hell with trying to secure any type of equipment or facility.  Should restrictions be relaxed? Maybe to a degree."

I could not immagine what would happen if there were a shooter situation you would have the folks on watch operating within a chain of command and CCW'ers who are not.

CCW,3dn0lp,zipsil,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:17:47 2015 UTC,"Good suggestion for most others, i suspect. This will not work for me, however, as I do not have my LTC in MA. There are a number of reasons for this. First, the town I live in is notoriously difficult to obtain one. Second, I believe I'd be paying full price for a MA license that I'll lose as soon as I transfer my information to become a CT resident (necessary to get in-state tuition rates). Even if it would work this scenario incurs yearly cost for whatever out-of-state permit you maintain. Though it would be really nice to have a permit for trips back home...  Essentially just kicking off in CT would save me the cost of the MA license up front, as well as the cost of the one year out of state CT license (since I'd get my resident permit the following year, presumably). Every dollar counts when you're paying out the ass for school (haha)"

CCW,3dn0lp,foreverpsycotic,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:03:31 2015 UTC,Are you sure? I think most states require that you have a license to carry in your state of residency to get a nonresident license in their state.

I'd say, more than accuracy at the range, I'd put emphasis on drawing speed, drawing from awkward positions, and even just regular shit like situational awareness, and the ability to keep a cool head. I hope you don't think I'm just like answering around your question, I just think it's the wrong question to ask.  I can shoot 2 inch groups at 7 yards if I'm like, taking my time and shit.

At my range if I try a funny draw I'll get bounced out of there before I can blink, so while it would be nice to train for odd shooting positions it is not an option for a lot of us.  This is a just question about gun accuracy, not all of the other immeasurable factors that go into self defense.  I can shoot for speed and we have target timers so it's not too bad but I'd love to able to shoot sitting and prone or from my back."

They are not splitting hairs over group size- to summarize it's what you hit and how long that takes you.  Neither are designed to be perfect combat simulations, but being able to make combat effective hits on a target at varying distances off of a draw, and in unusual positions, can save your life when it really counts. If you can't practice these things at your range, you've got the wrong range. The difference could save your life one day."

If you shoot competitions regularly, you should get one. If you just want to enhance your own skills, a timer is not what will give you a smoother, faster draw or a more natural sight picture. Only practice will.  There's no point obsessing over time if you're not hitting anything, and sloppy training while trying to beat a time isn't a good habit either. Learn to draw smoothly and consistently, this is the prerequisite for any kind of speed, then add the timer as a challenge."

If we're measuring stuff that can't really be measured in a meaningful way, and doesn't really matter that much in the first place, what's the point? The only reason anyone would think they had to quantify their skill for this is to either compare dick size, or to think they are ""good enough"" to defend themselves.  Practice drawing from difficult positions at home with an unloaded firearm, or go to an empty gravel pit and do it live.  Or, like you said, just do speed shooting, where you actually have to be fast, accurate, and there's an element of stress."

CCW,3dlhdz,moving0target,16,Fri Jul 17 15:03:03 2015 UTC,"6"" group at 15 yards is probably good enough, but you should always strive to be better.  Additionally, 6"" at 15 yards at the range is quite a bit different than 6"" at 15 yards while someone is trying to kill you."
CCW,3dlhdz,bdnicho,3,Fri Jul 17 06:14:27 2015 UTC,"I'd agree. Most DGUs occur within 15 yards, and I believe there's a real high number that occur within 10. So I aim for trying to get 6 inch groups at 20 yards. I figure if I can consistently do that then even under stress I should be able to do center mass at 10 or 15 yards.  My view has always been that you need to be able to do the ""goal"" grouping without thinking about it. If you have to focus on breathing and trigger pull when you're going for that group, then even if you get it at distance, you're not as good as you need to be. You can't be in a situation where someone is trying to kill you and use any of your brainpower on shooting technique. Your mind will be going too fast, and that's without any of the shake and motor skill degradation that comes with an adrenaline dump."

Since I can't afford to go to the range as often as I'd like, one of the exercises I perform is drawing several time with my eyes open, aiming at a specific spot.  Then I draw with my eyes closed and see if I'm still aimed at the same spot.  I'm sure there's a class somewhere that I can't afford, but I'd like to train with a Marine DI screaming at me and pushing me around while I shoot at a target just to see how I do.

No reason not to continue trying to improve.    Reason I carry a CZ75 is that I like the ability to dump 16 rounds, rapid fire, down range (depending on the day) in a bit tighter group at that distance.  If that doesn't stop my assailant, I can use my three pounds of CZ steel to club the bastard into submission.  I'm not a Navy SEAL.  I'm not a competition shooter.

CCW,3dlhdz,G19Gen3,7,Fri Jul 17 06:44:59 2015 UTC,"Whoops, misread your comment. 6"" at 15 feet is still probably good enough. That's still within center of mass. I have no idea what the NRA standard is. I just think people place too much emphasis on bullseye target shooting and not enough on dealing with stress, fear, adrenaline, and panic."
CCW,3dlhdz,Shadowex3,3,Fri Jul 17 07:21:07 2015 UTC,"I just think people place too much emphasis on bullseye target shooting and not enough on dealing with stress, fear, adrenaline, and panic.   The deal is though you want to make sure you can EASILY score hits at defense ranges.    Once drawing and landing 3 or 4 shots in a 6"" group becomes easy then you move the target back or speed up while working to keep your group the same.    One ragged hole created by slow placed shots isn't useful in a combat situation but hitting center mass quickly with a reasonable group size is.   My instructor even went so far as to tell us that he'd rather see a newbie do a mag dump at 7 yards and keep all the rounds on a sheet of paper than see someone making a 3"" hole by taking aimed shots 1 second apart.  The advantage to bullseye shooting is that being able to hit small targets at long distances increases your confidence and ability to hit large targets that are in your face.     those long shots aren't a replacement for up close fast shooting (especially combined with movement)  BUT they certainly help build confidence and reinforce fundamental things like trigger control, follow through, etc that become automatic under stress once you've got enough practice under your belt.   So there's room for both, but I think you're right.  Long distance bullseye shooting with handguns is WAY over utilized as ""proof of skill"""
CCW,3dlhdz,G19Gen3,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:02:09 2015 UTC,"Yeah, exactly. Not saying it's a waste of time or anything, but it's less practical than training for speed and managing stress. Of course you need some degree of precision, but there's a point where it's good enough and more precision has zero effective benefit on the outcome of a fight. That is, if all your rounds land center mass, then it doesn't really matter if you put them on top of each other or if they had a bit of spread. 100% hits are 100% hits either way.   Obviously it's still good to increase precision, because it never hurts and it helps you be accurate at longer distances and gives you more margin of error for up close. Just don't focus exclusively on it to the detriment of other things."

If your groups start contracting down, shoot faster. Your goal isn't to shoot a single organ 10 times, it's to get as many rounds center mass as you can until the threat is stopped. If you're thinking too much about your grouping that can translate to self defense and you might subconsciously shoot slower because you're trying to be more accurate."""

That said, I think the point he was making was that you should shoot as fast as you can while still in the torso area. Then you have as much speed as possible while maintaining the required accuracy, and don't worry about hitting in multiple areas because you're potentially doing more damage and at worst the same amount of damage.

When they test they have you do 5 sets at each distance. You basically have to make the times on all but two rounds and miss no more than 2 or 3 shots to get what they call a ""Distinguished Graduate"" and progress to their next course. They also test reloads and malfunctions against a timer.    Controlled Pair  3m  1.8 s Controlled Pair  5m  2.0 s Controlled Pair from the Ready 5m  1.4 s Controlled Pair  7m  2.1 s Controlled Pair  10m 2.6 s Controlled Pair 15m 2.9 s Controlled Pair 25m 3.4 s Controlled Pair Followed By un-timed Head Shot  7m  2.1 s Single Head Shots  5m  1.9 s   I think holding yourself to a standard based on time plus accuracy is better than just accuracy. I don't know if Front Sight's standards are perfect or not, but they seem like a reasonable thing to strive for. I don't think you'd have to nail all those time perfectly to be good enough but it wouldn't hurt.   The other standard Front Sight uses is a hand span sized group at any range. If your groups are smaller than you can cover with your hand, you should be shooting faster (assuming good fundamentals). If they're bigger, you should slow down. Their philosophy is that the group size will double under stress, so if you're shooting hand-span at the range, then double that is still a good hit on the street.   For real world I think you're best off doing something like the above - range practice with great fundamentals and solid accuracy against a timer - plus something like IDPA which makes you move and shoot while getting good hits against a timer.   Tl;dr - practice drawing and getting good hits against a timer and then get your time down. Group sizes don't mean jack.   Edit: formatting"

For me, there is a vast difference between target shooting and knowing how to fight with your firearm. Completion of a general defensive handgun course that ideally practices drawing from concealment will help with the latter and prepare one for proficient CC."
CCW,3dlhdz,Omnifox,2,Fri Jul 17 19:03:30 2015 UTC,"It depends on the gun. I consider proficiency being able to continually hit critical area on a man sized target no more than 1 second apart, having the ability to switch targets quickly and the ability to draw and fire in about 3 seconds. I use an IPSC shot timer app on my phone to measure performance.   I've recently gotten into action pistol (IDPA/USPSA) and I think it is very useful to be familiar with moving around and having to acquire new targets that aren't near you.   I'm proficient with my p938 out to about 10 yards and my 1911 to about 20 yards. What should be the minimum to carry? Hard to say since most civilian defensive uses happen at point blank range. We haven't had issues with untrained civilians causing damage so I don't see it so much as a public safety issue more than self preservation."

If forced to give hard limits, I'd say bill drills in 4s (draw and fire 6 rounds into a uspsa a zone or IDPA 0 zone with no misses) would be a good start."

CCW,3dlhdz,bdnicho,2,Sat Jul 18 19:46:49 2015 UTC,"""Adequate"" for concealed carry is actually a pretty low bar. As other's have mentioned, decent groups at 15 feet is most likely adequate. 15 ft. is just 5 yards. The pistol ranges that I go to don't even have target stands that close because shooting at 5 years is too easy and no fun.  Of course, it's good to strive for more than adequate. I can routinely shoot paper plate sized steel plates at 25 yards with my j-frame when taking my sweet time aiming. From 7 yards (the closest target stand at my range), I like to see how quickly I can land all my shots on the paper. If I'm on the paper, then there's not really any point in improving my groups. Whether you shoot the bad guy 3 times in a 2 inch circle in his chest or 3 times in a 5 inch circle on his chest doesn't really matter. What you want to do is improve time."

It was actually one of the more fun shows I ever did.  Never saw daylight for three days, had my room inside the casino, ate at their buffet (which was right next door to the escalator that brought you down from the gun show).  I'm guessing they didn't have any issues with guns in the Casino, as in order to -get- to the gun show, you had to walk through the Casino floor... both ways.  It was kind of surreal to come out of the show and see people wandering with long arms in their hands inside the Casino.  This came soon after Kansas was recognized by NV, so it was legal, legal, legal.  Nice!"

I believe that that is what I learned doing my research last summer when I took a road trip around the western US but I can't find anything that backs it up now. Will let you know if I find anything different.   **Having looked some more, I think what I found was that North Las Vegas had a ban on OCing in a car (which can't supersede state law, but I would hate to argue with a city cop over state law).

CCW,3dkgpr,selflessass,8,Fri Jul 17 00:13:44 2015 UTC,Can't go wrong with a Glock 43/26/19 or a S&W Shield in 9mm with no safety.

I owned a glock before the M&P came out and I still prefer them (maybe years of one thing will do that to you) but the M&P  is a fine choice.  I don't care for the trigger as much on the M&P as I do glocks but they are great guns. And that's with the improved trigger, not the first era M&P pistols!  No glock 19 sized gun also makes another strike against them, but the 19 is pretty big for some people for daily summer carry.  You'll be served with either. A M&P 9c is a nice, nice choice. If you like the trigger fine, then I'd pick the shield over the glock 43 as it will feel more familiar. I like to keep it in the family so in our house the glock 43 has more appeal over the shield simply because we have A LOT of trigger time on glocks."

Even if they see it, the chance they are going to identify it as a gun are equally small. I was super paranoid about this when I started carrying, but now I don't even think about it really. You don't need to modify your entire wardrobe or anything, but some basic things will make a huge difference.  light colored clothes print way more than dark ones  no pattern prints way more than something with a pattern or design on it  location location location. I'm a pretty big, barrel chested guy (6' 240lbs). If you look on the internet people act like it's super difficult to carry if you are my size or bigger.  2:30 (the ""point of the hip"") - gun disappears, but not super comfortable sitting down  3:00 - slightly more noticeable, as a non-descript slight bulge on that side of my belt line. Definitely doesn't look like a gun at all.  1:00-1:30ish (appendix carry) - lots of people like to AIWB carry at 12:00-12:30 which won't work for me because of aforementioned barrel chest (and accompanying power belly), however just a couple inches to the right and again, the gun disappears. My current holster isn't really meant for AIWB, and I have an INCOG on order now to fix that. Even with the wrong holster, it works well, and allows the gun to sit slightly inside my upper leg when I sit."

Quick and accurate follow up shots and it shoots a .45, not more I could ask for.

Reliable as fuck, basically the AK-47 of handguns. Not picky about ammo at all.  -No external safeties to worry about.  -NUMEROUS holster options  -9mm is cheap and plentiful, and in defensive rounds, as effective as anything else (bring on the downvotes), easier follow up shots, more capacity (15+1 is pretty great for an easily concealable gun)  -IF you decide to go down the road and start modifying your carry gun (seriously, don't. no accessory or aftermarket part is going to make you a better shooter.

CCW,3dkgpr,talon04,3,Fri Jul 17 14:07:58 2015 UTC,"That would be the Glock 26. The problem I've seen with the 26 (which is an awesome gun) is that it's just a little smaller than feels nice in my hand. My pinky hangs off the bottom of the subcompact size frames, and while I have big hands, I'm not gigantic. Some people say ""oh, well get the grip extension and it's much nicer to hold and shoot"". Yea... but then it's almost the same size as the 19, but with a shorter barrel (and therefore sight radius), and doesn't shoot as nicely, while sacrificing FIVE rounds of capacity.  If you wanna go real small, and super easy to conceal, I think I'd go all the way to a Glock 43, with a +2 baseplate. It's still smaller than the M&P shield, with the same capacity, in a single stack 9mm (8+1).  Now, if you live in one of the terrible places that restrict magazine capacity, I'd get the smallest gun you can find that has that magazine capacity. Like.. in New York, I'd get something that held 10 (+1 in the chamber), which in Glock 9mm land, is the 26."
CCW,3dkgpr,Pot_T_Mouth,3,Fri Jul 17 15:34:57 2015 UTC,Fortunately I live in Nebraska and we have fairly friendly laws in regards to magazine capacity. I have medium sized hands and was able to get a solid purchase on a Ruger SR9C with the short base plate so I don't think I would have an issue with the 26. With that said I suppose I should hold one to find out for sure. Thank you for the information!

The 26 came second when I got a job where the 19 was harder to conceal than the 26.  I will now sometimes carry the 26 appendix in tighter shirts but it's usually the 19.  Due to the grip length, it certainly is easier to grab and grip the 19 well, but that's because I need to put in specific hours of training to fix that. It can be done."

Money is the real root cause.  bigstink1 phrased it very well.  Always follow the Benjamins.  Cheaper for the company to allow employees to be shot than to allow them to defend themselves.  Insurance is cheaper without carry permission than with.  So if an active shooter rolls in, kills employees, the only cost to the company is cleaning up the mess and hiring fresh heads.  If a carrying employee successfully intervenes (against company policy), well then fine, but they violated company policy so company is covered against a suit.  Oh, and they're fired immediately.  If the company allows carry, then an employee, permitted by company to carry as legally entitled, successfully intervenes, then the company is at risk for a suit from the perp's relatives.

It indicates that you're a self policing individual and you can protect yourself without their help if need be. Legal permit holders make the world safer.  You're not on any type of registry but your permit is tied to your drivers license. So they don't know what you carry, they only know that you could carry, if you wanted to, and they would have to have your driver's license to look that up.  The notion that they'd be scanning your plates and you'd all of a sudden get pulled over for no reason is complete paranoid nonsense. Your permit is tied to your drivers license. Not your car. They would have to first have reasonable suspicion to pull you over, then you'd have to hand over your license before they even knew that you might have a gun on you."

I assume it's the same kind of thing for the prohibition on open carry in South Carolina.  Remember that it was Georgia's Zell Miller who kicked off the nationwide trend of overhauling and relaxing concealed carry laws back in 1976.

My commute (one way) might have been 45 minutes or three hours.  As far as Senator Miller goes, I don't have much use for either ruling party, but I have a great deal of respect for him.

CCW,3dgrrl,Sarcasticorjustrude,16,Thu Jul 16 16:18:24 2015 UTC,is complete paranoid nonsense.   This depends entirely on where you live. There are definitely cops out there who have a problem with CC'rs.
CCW,3dgrrl,KeepingTrack,1 point,Thu Jul 16 04:31:27 2015 UTC,"It depends on where you are. I've seen videos of cops flipping out about people carrying legally.   I've had one instance where it was a bit weird. 2 police SUVs pulled me over, and they asked that I hand over my gun after I displayed my CHL with my license and insurance. The second SUV left after the first had my pistol. That's more caution on their part, though, and didn't really bother me much, though was confusing.  All the rest have been straightforward. If a cop knows you have money enough to have the gun and license, plus can pass the medical (sanity) and criminal background checks to get them both, I've found they're more likely to leave you the hell alone insofar as intrusive behavior and harassment goes. I won't hesitate for a second to keep quiet, then after it's over, call the police on any officer who wants to berate me or escalate things toward the physical because I'm armed.  That being the only route to self defense when an officer is in the wrong is a scary thought, but better than having to defend yourself against an officer of the law (in most states, like Texas, where I live, it's not a good idea, even if justified, just shut up and comply is the rule to live by) - though some states have progressive laws where you can defend yourself, property and others -- against public servants. Most you just have to put up with it and not worry about getting beaten to death by police, or shot because you had to defend yourself. Obviously, I'm a huge fan of police body cams and for citizens having dash cams.  http://thefreethoughtproject.com/state-passes-law-legalize-self-defense-police/"

CCW,3dgrrl,Tarnsman4Life,3,Thu Jul 16 06:53:16 2015 UTC,"Just to point this out as it hasn't already, a permit is basically for LEO.  You could go carry a gun if you wanted.  I'm not saying you should.  But my point is a permit is to prove to LEO, ""Hey I have been authorized to carry a concealed weapon.""  You see what I'm saying?  Yeah, you can attract attention by having a permit.  A police officers may see that you have a permit on the computer and mistreat you.  I've had an experience where a police officer didn't like me and decided to ""misunderstand"" what I said, which means he lied and put words into my mouth.  There's the possibility that a police officer will abuse their powers because they know you have a permit.  But even having experience with abusive police, I'm very comfortable saying that's sorta rare.  More specifically, it's highly unlikely you should be too concerned about LEO causing you grief because you are permitted to carry.  Again, the entire point of a permit is to do the exact opposite. The point of a permit is a little card saying ""You can't do anything to me just because I'm concealing a firearm.  I'm permitted.""    In my state, roughly 10% of the adults have CFP's.  If you think about that, cops are quite familiar with the idea.  The last time my friend got pulled over and was asked for registration, my friend started saying ""Just so you understand officer, my registration is in my glove box and..."" the officer interrupted and said ""ok thats fine just don't touch your glove box."" and never even looked at the paper registration.    If you think about the situation above, that officer understands how common it is to come across a normal, everyday citizens with a CFP.    It only becomes a common occurrence if enough citizens have the permit.  Therefore, the best way for police to not be alerted by a citizen with a permit is to have more involvement with normal citizens with a permit.  See what I'm saying?"

CCW,3dgrrl,patchate,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:03:03 2015 UTC,Thank you for the reply! I'll be posting there shortly. Could you kindly share some details? Was it a traffic stop?
CCW,3dgrrl,iamgort,3,Thu Jul 16 14:02:23 2015 UTC,"8:30 AM, Im in tysons corner. I have a nice new mercedes SUV which is totally clean and tidy inside (no beer cans, tye-dye backpacks in back, or a mess where i could have a weapon) im wearing pajamas and driving back from dropping off my gf at work. I get pulled over, cop notices I have an expired sticker on the license plate and pulls me over. Goes to his car, comes back and then says ""so i see you have your concealed carry permit"", I answer yes sir, though this morning just so you know, I dont have it with me"". He tells me to stay right there, and goes back to his car. Soon backup arrives, keep in mind I am super polite (i work IT so i have to help PITA people occasionally and always hear I am over the top polite and nice so im doing that here) so I dont know why they are getting so worried. Now a second cop comes up to the window and says ""so i hear you have your concealed carry permit"" I acknowledge yes I do but I dont have it with me. Again, this is like in the middle of a safe area on a bright morning on a weekend, these guys have no reason to be getting on my case about my permit, just give me the warning / ticket for the sticker and let me be on my way. nope, he asks ""why do you need that?"" and i just say I like to compete in local sport shooting matches and mention a local cities gun club and that I might have it for when I wanted to carry for personal protection. He scoffs at me and goes back to his car. So now I've got both of these cars there, and then all three officers there come back to my car and tell me they want to run a field sobriety test on me. again, this is 8:30 AM in tysons corner. they have me out there doing all the tests, walking the line and all in the middle of the street in my pajamas and then ask to breathalyze me. after all that shit they of course let me go as I wasn't doing anything wrong, it was a really annoying stop and i feel like they just did that because they could (as some people drink late into the night and drive in the morning)."
CCW,3dgrrl,smitty22,3,Thu Jul 16 14:24:44 2015 UTC,"Breathalyzer is a search, and though I don't know the entirety of the circumstances it sounds like the cops didn't really have a probable cause to conduct sobriety tests on you. You should talk to a lawyer for filing a complaint or something."

That being said, I've had my CHP for two years and have only been pulled over once, and that was for a dead inspection. That officer was far from nervous/aggressive. But I was also far from having an attitude or being an idiot.  This also includes a large portion of my time driving on a gun-free campus.

CCW,3dgrrl,brianlpowers,2,Thu Jul 16 04:35:03 2015 UTC,"I think it's a great idea. If something ever happens in your life and you feel like you need to carry a gun, it will be too late to get a concealed carry license when you take training, paperwork, waiting period, processing time, etc. into account. If you already have a license, then you can just grab a gun whenever you need it.  Personally, I think most people should carry whenever they can, but I recognize that as a personal decision. However, I think everyone should at least get their license for that reason."

CCW,3dgrrl,razor_beast,2,Thu Jul 16 14:33:37 2015 UTC,"I don't live in VA.  However, in Texas there were a couple of things that bothered me about getting my permit.   Medical Records - I applied for my CHL online and there was a section during the application process where I had to agree to allow the state to review my medical records.  Basically it appears this is to check for mental illness but I really have no idea to what extent the state or LE will use the information they get. Finger Printing.  I just really didn't like the idea of giving my finger prints to the state."

CCW,3dgrrl,Foxtrot-150,2,Thu Jul 16 19:37:32 2015 UTC,"That's exactly why I originally got my permit. There's a vocal minority of people who want to take away almost every individual right you have and replace those rights with community ""rights"". There's a much larger majority who are willing to go along with them. I got my permit because it's my right and I wanted to have every option to exercise it. I didn't even own a gun at the time and never thought I would carry much.  I didn't start carrying until I came home to find my house broken into. My wife and kid standing behind me as I opened the front door and me with no idea if the punks were still in the house or not. I realized I had no way to protect them if there was someone there who decided to attack us rather than run away."
CCW,3dgrrl,38spcAR,4,Fri Jul 17 17:50:12 2015 UTC,"There is no such thing as a ""safe neighborhood"". Violent crime can occur anywhere to anyone at any time. The reason why you carry a concealed firearm is because you don't get to select the time and place wherein you will experience a violent encounter.  I think if you're going into this with a mentality that doesn't involve you carrying the weapon consistently then you shouldn't even waste the time and money on pursuing it.  The gun you leave at home or in the glovebox is worthless when you need it in the streets."
CCW,3dgrrl,Testiculese,2,Thu Jul 16 09:33:29 2015 UTC,"If you don't feel like your life will ever be in danger then don't do it. You can't force that mentality on yourself. Me personally, I don't go anywhere without a gun, and I live in an upper middle class neighborhood. I don't even open my door without my holster in hand."
CCW,3dgrrl,I_Need_A_Fork,3,Thu Jul 16 05:12:12 2015 UTC,"I mean, that's not necessarily the only reason to get one. I got one because in nc we have to have pistol permits for every handgun or lower purchase. If you have a cc it can act as a permit, so you don't have to pay the fee and apply and go to the courthouse to pick up the stupid piece of paper every time you want to buy a new item.   But idk how it works in Virginia. All the same, there are potentially other benefits. I tend to go by better to have it and not need it than decide you need it and not have it."
CCW,3dgrrl,moving0target,1 point,Thu Jul 16 06:11:08 2015 UTC,"Another situation you might want a permit but don't intend on carrying is to make trips to the range less of a hassle.   As I understand it (I haven't not had a permit in a long time, so I don't worry about it), if you want to have a gun in your car, you need to unload, store the gun out of reach, and store the ammo separately.   Also, if you're an open carrier, which you don't need a permit for, you can't drive without going through the same process. Which means every time you go anywhere, you'd have to unholster, and then reholster once you get there."
CCW,3dgrrl,pastorhack,1 point,Thu Jul 16 11:47:18 2015 UTC,"In Virginia the only benefits a permit currently offers are the ability to carry concealed (we have permitless open carry) and the ability to carry guns with certain features in a few municipalities you otherwise couldn't.

CCW,3dgrrl,pastorhack,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:13:04 2015 UTC,"Get it anyway, it makes it easier to move guns around. PA is pretty lax to begin with, but it's still nice to get back the freedom that I used to have without a permit."

Unfortunately, as mentioned, our gov vetoed it. MD is particularly bad about this. What jurisdiction do you live in? VA has wildly differing attitudes about guns. Ranging from ""oh, hey, it's cold outside so come sit in my squad car front seat even though you have a gun on you"" to ""I'm going to draw and scream at you because your license popped, even though there's no duty to inform, and come to find out you aren't carrying"" Virginia state police have a very scary sounding warning when they run your plate/DL. Essentially ""suspect may be armed! suspect may be armed!"" The good cops just kind of laugh that off. (see point 2 about sitting in the squad car after an accident)."

In SC, there's no 51% rule. You can carry in a bar that only sells chicken wings (or no food at all), as long as you don't drink.   And most businesses don't have signs and the ones that DO, don't have signs of the legal size. The only place off the top of my head that does have legit signs is the Charleston aquarium.  The sign has to be on a 12×8 inch sheet of paper with certain requirements.

If it's the correct size then I just assume the rest is probably correct  and that they don't want my business.   Like I said though, most people who don't want legal carriers in their store, are pretty stupid to begin with so they don't think to look up the laws or anything, thus, they put up incorrect signs that have no legal powers."

It was illegal to carry into a place that served alcohol for on site consumption. S308, that was passed 2014 I believe, allows cwp holders to carry in to said establishments as long as they don't drink. YOU need to research the law. No where in the law does it even mention what percentage of sales come from alcohol. The law has always been (since 2011) purely about whether or not the place sells alcohol to drink on premises. The link here I believe even has the old text, which also does not mention any percentage of sales from alcohol.   http://www.scstatehouse.gov/sess120_2013-2014/bills/308.htm"

CCW,3djgwr,cthompson07,2,Thu Jul 16 20:23:04 2015 UTC,"No, usemyadvice says exactly what I said. He doesn't mention 51% anywhere.

You may want to research the actual written laws for yourself next time before spouting your ""knowledge"". The actual law trumps what your instructor may have said.

If they served alcohol to drink, you couldn't carry there. Doesn't matter any percentage of what they made from alcohol or not. Clear cut, if they served beer, you couldn't carry.  S308 now allows cwp holders to carry into said establishments as long as they do not drink. The law still says nothing about any percentage of sales.

This article from freakin' 2012 claiming that it was going to be changed to be wallet sized specifically to avoid all the complaining we are doing here.  Check it out... ""According to the DoL’s Firearms Unit, the CPL is getting a facelift that will make it easier to fit into a wallet. For many years, the size and shape of the CPL has been annoying because when the document is folded – as it is designed to be – it is still too large in diameter to fit easily into the standard wallet card holder or slot. It’s always been just a little too big, causing some industrious people to carefully trim the edges of the folded CPL to make it fit.  And this gem.....  ""The new license will be about the size of the driver’s license and can be folded in half (at the side rather than at the bottom like the current format) and laminated to be the actual size of the driver’s license. The way the information is displayed is changing and no signature is required by the applicant on the new license. Also it is on a special type of paper so if it is copied the copy will show void written over the license itself. If you still have questions regarding the design please don't hesitate to ask.""  I have a feeling your permit might be one of these mythical ""new"" ones.  Which makes me mad since I got mine in 2015 and have what I consider to be ""old style"".

Just walking away from a crime doesn't make you not a threat. 'Yeah I just shot that person or raped that woman, but since I am walking away with the gun I am no longer a threat.' Doesn't work that way. I believe the article stated that he told the suspect to stop and didn't fire until the suspect did? He made a call that wasn't the smartest decision, however it doesn't mean that what he did was wrong. Would it be better to let him walk away and read in news that the suspect killed someone that night?"

As far as you know he could have continued to walk away until peacefully apprehended by the police later.  Nobody needed to be shot in this situation.  You can't play judge, jury, and executioner just because you have a CCW.  Unless someone is a legitimate threat (ie. pointing/brandishing a gun, physically beating someone) it's not anybody's place to step in with lethal violence.  Where do you draw the line with what you regard as proper action by the CCW'er?  Could he have followed him down the street?  Knocked on his door an hour later?  ""If I don't stop this guy he's going to kill the cashier"" is an actionable concern.  ""If I don't stop this guy he might go home and beat his wife"" is not."

Not sure at all how you extracted such an idea from my words, though I suppose from a certain perspective, you could say that, but since the man was in the midst of committing armed robbery, I seriously doubt any DA would be retarded enough to go along with such a claim.  I said, the departing perp was not a threat to the shooter. In most states (Texas, as I just learned, being an exception) you cannot claim 'self-defense' unless there is an imminent threat, unless you are actually defending yourself from physical harm, which was not present in this case. The robber was departing, and no imminent threat to the shooter."

If he was able to get to his vehicle, remove a weapon and fire first I would say he was not in danger and like you said turned a wallet theft into a shoot out. Lucky for him he was not shot, or anyone else for that matter.  For the Texas clause below does that include going back into your house to procure a firearm and run down the person that robbed you or only if you have a weapon on your person at the time?"

For example, in Texas you're allowed to use such force to recover stolen property at night. So if someone gets robbed while taking out the trash cans at 11pm they are legally justified in using deadly force on a perpetrator whose back is to them and who no longer presents an immediate threat to them. Not sure what the laws are in Louisiana though."
CCW,3demsy,Sarcasticorjustrude,1 point,Thu Jul 16 03:38:58 2015 UTC,"TIL!

If I was about to lawfully use physical force would I not want to be armed?  I would, absolutely, so that if the criminal decided to further commit another crime (attempted murder, which I don't see why he wasn't charged with) I would have means of eliminating the threat.  Every state is different.  I don't believe New Orleans is a duty-to-retreat state.  But in any case, this is how I would argue this situation.    In short, just because you chose to be armed while doing something lawful (using physical force to retain your property) doesn't mean that it is now somehow unlawful for you to protect yourself now that your life is in peril."

When you go through the gallery, (even though the pic quality is potato) you can see the difference in the lining.  The 2.0 has some kind of synthetic crap.  The 3.0 backing is still synthetic, but it is textured and has a much more leatherish feel.  I'm sure it will still be sweaty, but the Neoprene is more comfortable as well.  Much softer.

You are guilty as soon as you walk through the door either knowing its posted, or failing to notice when you should have noticed the sign.    I've seen some bullshit on here recently where people say they need to ask you to leave in Ohio. That's absolutely wrong. The specific code section refers to another code section on trespassing which says nothing about being told to leave. Only that you're guilty of trespass as soon as you negligently fail to notice a sign.    You can drink in your own home. Because leaving after drinking though, as the law is ambiguous as to the standard (""under the influence of alcohol""). It basically gives a lot of discretion to an officer to decide whether or not to arrest you. That, together with the fact that Ohio is a duty to disclose state, means that you shouldn't walk outside without being sure you're sober."

I think this stems from the wording of the code, since it reads ""...a person who knowingly violates a posted prohibition of that nature is guilty of criminal trespass in violation of...""  Emphasis mine. The line of thinking is that if you claim to have not noticed the sign, you didn't knowingly violate the prohibition.

CCW,3ddocn,hail_taco,2,Wed Jul 15 17:57:13 2015 UTC,"But the code section specifically references being guilty under 2911.21, which references negligently failing to heed signage.   At best, it's vague as to what mental state is required, and you'd find yourself arguing these points in front of a judge.    Edit: also the fact that the signage requirement says ""conspicuous"" indicates that you wouldn't be allowed to argue ignorance. Which effectively makes this a negligence standard."
CCW,3ddocn,StAcacius,3,Wed Jul 15 18:00:37 2015 UTC,"The way I've always seen it interpreted is that 2923.126 (license code) is clarifying that if you ignore a sign and go in anyway, you're violating 2911.21 (trespassing code). That can be significantly different than if you don't see a sign (even if conspicuous) and go in without noticing it.  I've legitimately had the latter happen due to a propped open door, which hid the sign. Whether ""I didn't see the sign"" is a valid defense would be up to a judge, so I don't think it's as cut and dry as your initial comment made it seem. That said, I'd agree it's best to look for the sign and avoid going in, since explaining yourself in court isn't optimal, regardless of whether you're technically not trespassing."

Second is to use a gun with a high rear sight such as a target model with the adjustment screws since they tend to be large and can be pushed against a table edge. Lastly, maybe a higher capacity auto so the need to reload is not as likely? Load before or get help."

Wolf and Bear ammos are both made by Barnaul which makes ammo to CIP spec. So according to Ruger's own literature, there ought to be no problems. And yes, Russian ammo tend to have harder primers but if that is the problem and the firing pin won't hold up to even a couple boxes of harder primers, I'm not sure I'd want to keep the gun, regardless of what disclaimers about ammo choice Ruger puts out there."

CCW,3de5pz,acornhead456,9,Wed Jul 15 15:51:54 2015 UTC,"So here's my 2c. With concealed carry, you're most worried about people knowing you're carrying. The element of surprise is your friend.  With open carry, you've announced to the world that you have a weapon. Your main concern is now retaining control of your weapon. You need to make sure no one can sneak up on you and disarm you. There are some people who argue against this view, but I just feel like so easy to wear a retention holster and use it that it is worth it to wear one.  Unfortunately, I don't have a lot of experience with open carry. I wouldn't feel good about recommending a specific holster. I would recommend looking at ""duty"" holsters. I'd aim for at least one retention mechanism (thumb break, button to depress, etc). Personally, I'd want a level 3 holster. It'd make me feel better that someone is going to be able to grab my gun even if I get surprised."
CCW,3de5pz,Nicadimos,5,Wed Jul 15 16:09:24 2015 UTC,"So much this,  you need active retention to delay the thief from snagging your weapon when you turn to grab item A off shelf B.  Best practice is obviously CCW and they don't even know, but if you are going to OC, practice moves to disable someone who tries to take your weapon.  (Use your main hand, dig your thumb into the web of their hand and twist their arm while you turn around.  This'll give you positive control of the subject while maintaining their distance from your weapon.)  Be more vigilant, you are openly displaying a weapon which means you get to live in condition yellow/orange  somewhere between the two.  You are the threat to someone who would want to rob the store you're in and therefore the first one who has to be eliminated, on top of that you'll get people asking a lot of questions about it, as well as allowing a criminal to trail you, wait for a break in concentration and come take your weapon (This is where multiple retention mechanisms come into play), some criminals aren't fully familiar with all the holsters or how to bypass the retention on them (Even a Serpa level 2), but if they do, now you've lost your weapon....  Now what do you do?"

CCW,3de5pz,ptchinster,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:58:26 2015 UTC,Well shelf A is lower so you'll be crouching and making it harder for the subject to grab your weapon =)
CCW,3de5pz,Sardond,5,Wed Jul 15 18:17:34 2015 UTC,"Get a kydex holster with positive retention, at least level 2 and ideally level 3. I'm not aware of a leather holster like the SERPA or Safariland ALS with redundant levels of safety."
CCW,3de5pz,Pull_Pin_Throw_Away,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:58:58 2015 UTC,I believe safariland offers a leather retention holster. Although it is a duty holster so it might be a bit bulky.
CCW,3de5pz,DiscipleOfDrone,5,Thu Jul 16 14:25:57 2015 UTC,For an open carry holster I wouldn't use anything other than a Safariland.
CCW,3de5pz,slalomz,3,Wed Jul 15 16:12:48 2015 UTC,"What will you be doing while wearing this holster? Every day stuff around lots of other people? Hiking? Hunting?   Typically the only time I open carry is when camping/hunting/fishing in the woods or around my own house doing yard work and shit like that.   In my case I don't need level 3 retention because I'm not surrounded by other people while open carrying. I got a really nice thumb break holster from El Paso Saddlery that serves this purpose well for me.   If you're going to be open carrying while at gas stations and grocery stores I'd opt for something a little more secure.   If it's just a range holster I wouldn't worry about any retention at all, personally."
CCW,3de5pz,ck323k,3,Wed Jul 15 17:30:08 2015 UTC,"While I don't necessarily believe that gun grabs are as prevalent as some others in the CCW world, whenever I OC I use holsters with active retention. I currently use a Bianchi thumb break model and a Safariland ALS. Both have similar release motions so you don't have to get used to different mechanics. HOWEVER, I have also used custom leather OWB holsters (read: expensive) in the past and they are so well molded that I'd be willing to bet a gun grabber couldn't get my pistol out unless he was able to pull the gun out at EXACTLY the right angle. Either way, situational awareness goes a long way."

CCW,3dbw1n,SapperInTexas,2,Wed Jul 15 02:45:29 2015 UTC,"My usual carry is an LCP.  I have the Hogue grip as well.  It's a game changer for how that pistol functions and being able to practice with it for anything more than a couple magazines.  In regards to the ""trigger bite"" get yourself the Sweet Pea trigger for it.    http://gallowayprecision.com/ruger/lcp/sweet-pea-trigger-for-ruger-lcp/  It takes up that little bit of empty space at the bottom nicely and prevents you from getting that blister.  It's also adjustable for Pre & post travel (mine's the early version with only one adjustment, but that's plenty)  I would also look into a set of the Wolff calibration recoil springs.  I run the 12lb in mine and it does tons to take up the recoil over the 8lb stock springs providing you have a strong wrist, and it sounds like you do.  I have larger/stronger hands as well and this + the Hogue grip makes it a completely different gun from the stock configuration.  Much more manageable to shoot & keep on target, even at longer distances than you indicated.  Nice review!"
CCW,3dbw1n,Starfire66,1 point,Wed Jul 15 06:01:17 2015 UTC,"I'd thought about the sweet pea trigger, but I'm not sure I want that much adjustment. I'd seen a video where the post travel wasn't set right and the trigger wouldn't go far enough to actually shoot. I'm nervous about those screws walking out and causing that malfunction on their own. Thoughts on that?  The recoil really didn't bother me, so I don't know that I'm interested in the replacement springs. In addition, I often take others shooting with me that sometimes have problems racking the shield. Would replacing the springs make manipulating the slide too difficult for them?"

I've had 2 different women that had trouble with it with the upgraded springs & weak hands not being able to rack it, but for most people it's not a problem.  And I bought (traded for) mine with the sweet pea trigger already installed, so I was kinda spoiled with it.  Shot plenty of other ones that didn't have it, so I know the difference it makes.  I'm not too worried about the adjustment loosening up.  Mine's not budged in the 3-4 years I've had it, and I've put quite a few rounds downrange in that time."

CCW,3d98ye,Beesto5,4,Tue Jul 14 15:31:12 2015 UTC,It has a 32 gig micro SD card. It's plugged in my cigarette lighter so it turns on with my car and automatically starts recording. If your lighter has power all the time that may not work for you.
CCW,3d98ye,bigbossman90,4,Tue Jul 14 15:35:14 2015 UTC,Oh wow that's easy. Just take it out every couple weeks and Delete the old video?
CCW,3d98ye,Dash_Shill,12,Tue Jul 14 15:36:58 2015 UTC,"Most dedicated dash cams record continuously and overwrite older video automatically. If you ever need to pull the video, it most likely will be of something that happened recently, so there's no point in saving everything and it's super convenient to just leave it running. I bet you can also set it to save everything, but then you'd have to manually delete stuff as you said and then you risk forgetting to clear the SD card and it may not have room to record something when you really need it to."
CCW,3d98ye,dotMJEG,9,Tue Jul 14 15:40:41 2015 UTC,They have a function so it records in 5min clips. After the entire 32gb card is filled up (many hours or days or recording) it loops back and starts recording over the oldest ones.
CCW,3d98ye,rivalarrival,6,Tue Jul 14 15:39:57 2015 UTC,It automatically overrides old video unless it's locked. On that note make sure the g-sensor is low or off. Mine was on high for some reason and the whole memory card was taken up with video I couldn't delete from the camera. You have to put the card in a computer and delete it that way.

It's smaller than the G1WC and takes better picture in my opinion. It came with more features and it is more expensive. But I'm of the mindset that I get what I pay for.   It also came with an 8gb micro sd card. At full resolution, it'll do about and hour and 20 minutes before it records over itself on the 8gb. It sits right up next to my rear view mirror and I don't even notice it's there. I hardwired it so it turns on and off with my truck.

CCW,3d98ye,NVdustytrail,3,Tue Jul 14 15:20:48 2015 UTC,"I haven't seen that problem, but if I could do it again I'd go back to the regular battery G1W. The caps drain too fast and the unit doesn't record anything after you shut the car off. Also makes the g-sensor feature useless. They say the C is better for high temps but I never had issues with my old one in the heat, though I imagine that's a lifetime issue not an immediate one."

CCW,3d98ye,NVdustytrail,2,Tue Jul 14 15:57:32 2015 UTC,"Also, a lot of places require extra lights like that be covered when driving otherwise you could possibly get in trouble for ""impersonating a police officer"" or something similar."
CCW,3d98ye,ILikeLampz,2,Wed Jul 15 00:45:22 2015 UTC,"Yeah I have heard that you're supposed to have covers on them in some places, not a requirement here as far as I'm aware but rigid industries does sell covers for them. I would think it would just be an equipment violation ticket though, impersonating a police officer is a pretty serious offense  that I don't think they would be trying to stick someone with just because they didn't have a cover on their offroad/auxiliary lights."
CCW,3d98ye,dotMJEG,1 point,Wed Jul 15 01:09:30 2015 UTC,Yeah it would be a bit ridiculous to get charged with impersonation. I have heard it used as a warning but never heard of it actually happening (probably to get people to take the violation seriously more than anything).

With it up at the top, you can run the USB cable across the headliner, and down the passenger support column next to the windshield, wrap it behind the door, under the glovebox, and right into whatever power supply you need, and you'll not have to see the wire, or that big-ass camera in your field of view."

I've chosen to just carry pepper spray while running, but whatever conclusion you find best there was a point of context I noticed that it would be useful to consider as you find what's best for you. For a lot of people who recommended fanny packs or belly bands, I got the impression (and so could be wrong) that their definition of running was a slow to moderate jog of 1-3 miles. While that will work for a lot of people, I didn't find confirmed instances of people logging 20+ miles per week or doing 10 mile long runs while carrying.  After doing a lot of reading and thinking about it, I concluded that living a life that was active and exploratory was my primary goal, and that if survivability was important to me I would gain more benefit from regular cardio than I would by being armed but sedentary. Life is meant to be lived.  Good luck finding what works for you; consider a review for the next person with whatever you try."

CCW,3dbuzb,Outdoorsinwisconsin,1 point,Wed Jul 15 05:05:44 2015 UTC,http://www.stickyholsters.com/  I always thought these and other holsters like them were a terrible idea. We had a CCW expo in town a few months back and my mom bought one of these because she doesn't like to carry in her purse and doesn't like having to wear a belt.   I was leery at first but she loved it. I took it once and shoved my Kahr P9 in it and tucked it into the waistband on some athletic shorts and tied the string snug and went for a run. I was blown away. It didn't move at all. I ended up buying one of my own and use it any time I want to wear athletic shorts or sweat pants. It's a great option and not very expensive.   The only drawback I could see is if your gun is too big. Subcompact is the big winner when carrying without a belt.

(a) A licensee under this Act shall not knowingly carry a firearm on or into:  [...]  (a-10) The owner of private real property of any type may prohibit the carrying of concealed firearms on the property under his or her control. The owner must post a sign in accordance with subsection (d) of this Section indicating that firearms are prohibited on the property, unless the property is a private residence.  [...]  (d) Signs stating that the carrying of firearms is prohibited shall be clearly and conspicuously posted at the entrance of a building, premises, or real property specified in this Section as a prohibited area, unless the building or premises is a private residence. Signs shall be of a uniform design as established by the Department and shall be 4 inches by 6 inches in size. The Department shall adopt rules for standardized signs to be used under this subsection.  (Source: P.A. 98-63, eff. 7-9-13.)  [/LEGAL]  The property owner makes the call to ban carry. As this is a private residence and not a business, per 430 ILCS 66/55 Sec. 55 a-10 a. & d., the property owner is NOT REQUIRED to place a sign, he simply must inform you in a clear manner of his intention to ban carry on the property. The roommate is not the property owner and is not an authorized representative of the owner. This sign holds no weight of law. If it is not distinctly prohibited by the owner, you may lawfully carry. If the property owner says nothing, you may lawfully carry.  If your brother has told them he is carrying, maybe he shouldn't have. If they don't know, just keep it on the down low.

CCW,3dbhf4,lookatmycoolusername,2,Wed Jul 15 05:00:52 2015 UTC,"Different trigger feel. I have a VP9 as well. The vp9 has a lighter trigger pull and shorter reset. The p30sk is easier to stage, and the trigger pull is more predictable, allowing me to score more accurate shots. YMMV.   The LEM varients feel like striker fired pistols with more takeup. Have you tried one?"
CCW,3dbhf4,Tarnsman4Life,1 point,Wed Jul 15 05:05:27 2015 UTC,"I had a P30 with the ""light"" lem, it reminded me very much of a VP9 or PPQ but as you say with more takeup. I like hammer fired guns, in theory I like a second strike capability but when I think about it logically it holds no advantages (for me ) over striker fired. Every time I have had a round fail to go bang on the range and I have tried it again, sometimes twice more and in different guns I have yet to have one go bang."
CCW,3dbhf4,lookatmycoolusername,1 point,Wed Jul 15 12:07:51 2015 UTC,"I got one about a month ago. I absolutely love it.

CCW,3dakko,darthswader,3,Tue Jul 14 19:57:10 2015 UTC,"The law doesn't define them and it's totally arbitrary and up to the courts what to do.   Q - What section of the Penal Law authorizes the placing of restrictions on pistol permits by the issuing authority?  The Penal Law does not specifically authorize the placing of restrictions on pistol permits. However, court decisions have consistently supported the ability of licensing officials to impose these restrictions. Such an imposition is an administrative function of the licensing officer.  Licensees in violation of these restrictions would therefore not be subject to criminal prosecution but would face action being taken by the court of issuance in the form of suspension or possible revocation of the license.

CCW,3dakko,slalomz,3,Tue Jul 14 20:03:02 2015 UTC,"As someone who is not your lawyer, or indeed any kind of lawyer, my advice is to not try to stretch any definitions in the state of New York. They'll use the ""reasonable person"" definition and it will be a New York judge's opinion of what a ""reasonable person"" would think.  My guess is that ""hiking"" implies a trek through wilderness, not the local mall, and in the absence of anything else ""collection"" is probably the collection of firearms."
CCW,3dakko,IAmWhatYouHate,2,Wed Jul 15 12:28:56 2015 UTC,"The restrictions your county judge places on your New York Pistol Permit are purely administrative. According to state law you have been issued a permit to either ""carry concealed,"" ""possess on premises,"" or ""possess/carry during employment"" as per New York State Penal Law 400.00 (2). I will assume that you have been issued a permit to ""carry concealed."" Out of NYC the overwhelming majority of permits are this kind. Carrying outside of the restrictions is not a violation of law, however should an officer discover this he or she could contact your issuing judge. The judge could revoke your permit, but then again the judge can also revoke your permit at anytime without cause (concealed carry).  Yeah, New York is awful."
CCW,3dakko,m1_ping,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:33:19 2015 UTC,"Wow what County are you in? I've never heard of such a long list of restrictions, usually target/hunting is all I've heard of. That being said, legally you are allowed to carry it regardless of restrictions. That means that you shouldn't go to jail if a police officer finds you carrying outside of those restrictions somehow. However, he could very likely notify your issuing judge about this and if the judge hears about it he would probably revoke your permit.    Say I take a hike around the block or I'm going to hike around the mall?   I doubt the judge sees it that way.    If I'm going to collect something from somewhere, isn't that collection?   Again, not what the judge meant.   I would not risk losing my permit over carrying around the block personally, but it's not my decision to make. My understanding however is that it won't land you in jail, just potentially lead to losing your permit if the judge finds out.   It's a shitfest really. I'm so relieved that we finally have a reasonable judge in Broome, and glad to finally have my unrestricted permit. He requires you take a course which I found useful, and put in a written request. Even though I don't carry daily, I still find the lifting of restrictions a relief."

Another fun Shield manual fact: The Slide Lock lever is not designed to be thumb-released with the slide locked back. It will wear prematurely if you charge it in this manner. You are supposed to pull back the slide and release to charge the weapon from a locked position.  Perversely, my XDs .45 is the opposite - it charges from the slide release and you are NOT supposed to slingshot the slide, though after a hundred rounds or so it settled down to where slingshotting feeds fine.

A ""no ccw"" sign isn't going to attract a shooter in our culture as it is now, just like it won't deter them, and it only creates legal ramifications for otherwise law-abiding, responsible, upstanding citizens who are incorrectly portrayed as villains simply for expressing their right to have a part in maintaining their own safety.

CCW,3d9wch,squidofsteel,1 point,Tue Jul 14 22:02:49 2015 UTC,"Yet they always have other reasons completely unrelated to that. How many gun-free downtown coffee shops have been targeted? How many bdubs or starbucks?  School shootings are mostly kids who attend that school. That most recent church shooting was a racist nutter targeting a location they knew was mostly black. There's better explanations than ""they are ostensibly gun-free"", especially acknowledging the fact that many CCWers, like OP, don't respect the signs. It's not like they are searching people on the way in.  In MN I don't need to respect signs, just verbal requests. Since I'm concealed even the most staunch anti-CCW stores would never know. If nutters are actually worried about CCW they don't shoot up places, not ""shoot up places and hope CCWers are following the rules"".  Edit: to clarify, I think this would change if the norm was CCW. If nutters were raised in a culture where everyone carried, it'd be a major consideration. But they aren't, so it isn't. I carry, all my coworkers and most of my friends carry, yet it never crosses my mind that other people in public might be carrying because we're still a minority."

CCW,3d9wch,AOSParanoid,0,Wed Jul 15 02:04:19 2015 UTC,"I still don't think it factors into their decision. Cash on-hand, geographic location, ease of compliance etc. are all necessarily relevant, whereas a gun-free sign doesn't actually provide a necessarily gun-free zone. It's basically a hunch since concealed is concealed. I might be too stable to understand the mind of a common hoodlum, but I know the odds are in my favor that, sign or no, there is most likely no CCWers in any place I would rob (especially since I would choose to rob them with as few witnesses as possible).  I might worry about employees being armed, but I currently work in a business that forbids carrying while working, despite, as I said before, myself and all of my coworkers carrying on-duty (the girls actually don't carry on their person but keep their edcs in their purses, but I am packing at all times)."

I'm much more likely to get caught for whatever reason than to need my gun to defend myself.

Places with prohibited carry signs that are otherwise legal are just the trespass deal, leave if challenged and no legal problem.  But, Murphy's law could let my concealed carry somehow get discovered, and I don't want that to happen in a place where a violation would land me in jail or take away my CPL.  Concealed is concealed.  Well that's mostly fine, but I just won't do it in an actually illegal place.  Besides, I'm supposed to be a more law-abiding citizen than average, so flouting a law I don't like seems like it's violating the whole concept."

I get familiar with the exits, I keep an eye on others and I work out response plans in my head. Am I less prepared for a gunfight, active shooter whatever? Of course.

It has a really nice trigger on it and the stock sights are great. Not much more you can really ask for on a carry gun.   My only regret is not buying the subcompact version. That's only because it is really easy to get compact and full size conversion kits for the sub compact but it is impossible to find sub compact conversion kits. I love the compact grip, but I'd like to switch to sub compact when I feel extra concealment is necessary.  On that note, any accessory made for the 250 will fit the 320 because they are exactly identical except for the trigger and firing mechanism.

I had some friends that had been staying with me including an Ex girlfriend who started dating the convicted felon next door.  One day he started talking shit in my house to me and I just let him do it not wanting to start a fight he managed to get me all riled up after about an hour and we ended up outside with her between us so we didn't fight.   I told him never to enter my house again.  They all left and went out drinking together.  Fast forward about 5 hours and I was getting out of a bath when I hear what sounds like breaking glass along with a thud.  Thinking it was one of my friends falling into my fridge and breaking a shelf I walk into the kitchen in a pair of basketball shorts to find this gentleman pulling all the beer out of my fridge.  I told him to ""get the fuck out"" and he stood up saying that so and so said it was cool to take the beer as they wanted to go out booze cruising.  He walks out toward his car and I followed him outside and took the box of beer from him and stormed back inside with it locking the door behind me.    I armed myself with my New Haven 500 AT with 00 buck and prepared to defend my self as he started screaming at me and trying to kick in the rear door.  I could have shot then (by the laws in my state) but I didn't as I could see my friends walking up behind him and didn't want to hit any of them.    Another friend ended up calling the cops as he tried to kick in the door and I yelled.  ""Ronnie you mother fucker if you don't want to go back to fucking prison you better get lost the cops are on the way.""  He looked at me and turned tail running away.    I unlocked the door and let my friends in and sat down on my bed shotgun in hand.  The ex girlfriend was crying and apologizing for what happened.  I told the cops when they got there his name and where he lived so they went to try and talk to him but never could.  I made the decision that I needed new friends that night."

CCW,3d7lpr,talon04,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:05:46 2015 UTC,"Sort of used to be I guess.  This girl I was with for two years off and on.  I learned alot about what I didn't want in a woman in those two years.    It's really sort of a simple story I moved her from her hometown to mine was doing my best to take care of her and her son.  She just didn't want to really do anything. I think she had a job for about a month here.  And she never really wanted one.  She was sort of a cheap party girl.   One night when we were dating she told me she wanted to go out so I told her that was cool just let me know when she would be back.  She told me midnight or 1 am.  I went to bed at 1am and she wasn't answering her phone so oh well.  She got home at 5 am that night and started crawling into bed with me.  Being woke up at 5 am by someone crawling in your bed I went for my SD40Ve that was in the nightstand when I realized it was her.  You know that sort of shit happened alot.  She ended up losing her son as a result of her behavior etc.  The night it all came apart was at the same location as the other story with the convicted felon.  She was actually the ""friend"" who ended up calling the cops on him.  That night was bad I had had enough and gotten all but 3 of the people gone from the house, (only one of which I associate with today) she was angry as I told her to GTFO and leave I was tired of all the bullshit.  She demanded the right to take my cat with her.  I refused as she had no job no way to feed it or provide for it and I had paid for all the damn bills it had ever had.    I was holding the cat (Jax) when she tried to forcibly take him away. When I deflected it is when it turned physical.  She put me in a choke hold and started trying to strangle me.  I called 911 while a friend took the cat and the other person untangled her from me.  I was on the phone with dispatch when she started screaming at me and throwing shit at me.    As I was giving them our location and what was going on she screamed out ""and I'm going to take your fucking gun too!""  She grabbed the soft case it was in from the shelf and I pulled and twisted it out of her hand handing it to another to keep behind me.    The dispatcher heard it all and stayed on the line for all of it.  The moment she said gun the whole tone of the call changed.  I ended up between her and the rest of the house with her in the kitchen.  She gave me this smug 'fuck you I'm out of here,'  look and opened the rear door and shut it behind her.  The spotlight from the local PD cruiser outlined her in the blinds.   The officers came up and I gave a statement and showed them my neck where she had had ahold of me and they booked her for Domestic Violence and battery.  She admitted that she had chocked me but not hit me.  Officers told her that was battery.  Off she went.  She had the balls the next day to call me for bail money.  I laughed the bail bondsman off telling them I was the victim and that she could sit and rot for all I cared.  All of her ""friends and family"" did the same."

CCW,3d7lpr,cthompson07,11,Tue Jul 14 22:25:28 2015 UTC,"This happened right before I started carrying regularly.   My car was in the shop, so I was using the bus to get around. One night, about 10:30 or so, I'm on the bus. It's surprisingly empty. A few older teenaged dudes get on the bus, and sit in the seats around me. They're pretty boistrous, and saying pretty disgusting/rude things about women they know. They start talking to me, and asking me questions. I stay polite, but give one word answers.   One of them touches my head (I had a partial buzzcut at the time) and asks me if I'm a ""dyke"". I finally decided to get off the bus several stops early, at a place with a convenience store and a diner. I pull the cable and stand up abruptly and get off the bus. The dudes get off the bus too.   They're standing between me and the diner, and it's like they're waiting on me to make a move. So I start walking fast in the opposite direction from them. They start following me.  After a block, I duck down a street that a friend lives on and SPRINT to her house. Her inside lights are on, so I knock on her door. No answer. I hear the teenagers nearby saying stuff like ""where'd that bitch go?"". I ended up hiding between my friend's holly bush and house for thirty minutes, until I was sure those dudes were gone.   When I think about it now, I doubt I would have done anything differently if I'd been carrying. I mean unless they found me hiding."

CCW,3d7lpr,wvwvwvwwvwvvwvwvwvwv,6,Tue Jul 14 19:17:36 2015 UTC,"There are two stories that come to my mind. One was a road rage incident, the other had all the makings of a tragedy. First the road rage. I was driving home from work and stopped a red light behind a Chevy Volt. Light turns green and we go. Except we don't go very fast, the Volt only accelerates to about 20 mph. Whatever. Traffic clears and I go to pass. The driver of the volt for some reason takes umbrage at this, and gives me the one finger salute as I overtake him. I am frankly shocked, as I have don't nothing but pass a car doing 35 mph under the speed limit on a four lane road. I locked eyes with him, respond in kind, and am on my way. I don't make a habit of giving people the bird, but I will respond in kind when it is offered to me first. I carry on my way and now I notice that the Volt is behind me and following me. I am only about a half mile from home, where my wife and kids are, so I decide I don't want to lead him there. Nor do I want to engage in a rolling road rage incident, so I pull into the nearest parking lot. The volt follows. I pull to the farthest corner, where the only option for him to park leaves nothing but a clear backdrop behind him with no roads or other buildings. He pulls his car three spaces away from mine and gets out. At this point I realize we are going to have a confrontation. I reached over to the passenger seat of my jeep, grab a windbreaker that was there and place it over my lap. Under the windbreaker I have my Glock 19 with 15+1 Corbon 115 +p hollow points. The conversation that followed was short but intense, with lots of ""Fuck you""s from him and a lot of ""yes sir, no sir, thank you sir""s from me. There is no doubt in my mind that he had no idea that I had a handgun in my hand. Total elapsed time from when I noticed he was following me to when he left, probably less than 60 seconds.   The near tragedy was in my house two years ago. Our neighbors and us had a great set up where we would watch their child on the mornings that they worked, and they would watch our son on the mornings we worked. Its around 8:00 pm and I am in my basement working on laying some laminate floor. (Side note: I hate that stuff) I hear some creaking of the floor boards above me. Whatever, its a old house, but I'll check it out anyway. I walk up stairs and into my living room. Here is where a simple failure to communicate almost got my neighbor killed. My wife had left our sons blankie at the neighbors house that morning, and he had found it when he came home. He texted her, and she told him to come on over and drop it off. So he knocks, I don't hear him because I am in the basement working on the floor, so he just comes in. When I came around that corner, I didn't see my neighbor returning a blankie. I see a strange, bearded man in my house where he isn't expected, holding my sons blankie which my mind immediate associates with my son. My mind sees a stranger in my living holding my son. My hand immediately goes to my belt where that same Glock 19 is now in a kydex OWB holster. I lock eyes with the target and start my draw stroke. I clearly remember the fear in his eyes as he see's what is about to happen. I do not believe that the gun ever cleared the holster before I realized what was going on, and that John was not a threat. But he said afterward that he saw the look in my eye, and thought he was going to get shot. He now texts before walking into my house."

Sorry for the really compressed and shorthand typing, trying to make a long story short as I have posted this numerous times previously.  19, no pistol, only own an AR-15 and 15-22. Drag AR with me everywhere I go to work (Detroit property management). Go to Rekey and assess a home that was just evicted while the tenants were gone. I was the last one on site, neighbors watching house to stop evictees thing from being stollen from the dumpsters it was thrown in, don't wanna drag the AR out and spook them. Tenants come home with a bunch of pissed off friends and family, big guy breaks open locked security gate, runs at me with a natal object in his hand raised above his head ready to strike, run out the side door, everything is a blur, last I remember I'm standing at my car, boxed in with my rifle in my hand and 13 pissed off people on the lawn advancing with a range of blunt weapons, they stop advancing me...the dust settled and they said they were evicted illegally. 5 calls to the police between me and the evicted party. In the mean time I called my people to get down there with the eviction paper work and to get the house boarded up, things shortly deescalated ..was about 4 hours until we were all finished, no police showed up. His wife, kids, and mother in law witnessed the whole thing, the fact that they could have witnessed him getting shots messed with me for a couple years. Lost a lot of sleep that week but I'm over it now as I realize that I should stop worry about what could have happened other than what did happen, everyone went home alive.  2  Pull up to a house to take damage assessment photos, notice strange guy standing on the corner across the street with his hands in his pockets. got a pistol but no CPL as I was still 19, had to OC to legally carry, can't have pistol accessible in vehicle. Go to back hatch to grab pistol and drill to take down board on door, as I'm in the back, I hear the guy suddenly making his way towards me quite rushed. At this time I just happen to be loading my SR9c, drop the locked slide after slamming the mag in as I turn to look at him. He immediately runs down the street to my left, slips on some ice after a few steps, the revolver in his hand slides out in front of him, throw pistol in holster, drive out of there, call police, give description of incident and would be robber, go about my day."

It still didn't stop me from putting my hand on my carry spot, and yelling ""get your fucking dog, asshole, or I will shoot it right now"".  The dude starting crying, ""don't shoot my dog"" and jumped in the middle of the dog fight to pull his dog away. His dog bit the shit out of his arm and made him bleed.  Not my smartest moment to pull such a bluff, and I wouldn't recommend it, but then again, it saved my dog.

CCW,3d7lpr,Mnementh2230,10,Thu Jul 16 05:44:33 2015 UTC,"Road rage incident happened to me about a month ago. I was driving to work at night going down a dual lane interstate, car set on cruise control following about two car-lengths behind another vehicle. We were cruising along when we came to an on-ramp and I noticed a SUV coming up to merge.    I was outpacing the SUV that was going to merge, initially. They decided to speed up to try force me to move over. I assumed they were just going to tailgate me until I passed the car that I was following originally if I got over for them. I did not want to deal with them tailgating me until I decide to speed well over the limit to pass the first vehicle so they could blow by me anyways.  I kept my cruise control set where it was and they almost side swiped me because I wouldn't get over.  After cutting in behind me and passing me in the left lane, they threw something out of their SUV on purpose at my car and hit it while going down the interstate at roughly 70mph (Guy was leaning half way out the rear passenger side window and hurled something directly at my car, it was around 10pm and dark so all I heard was a loud BAM on my car).  I followed them to get their tag number, when they saw I was following they pulled off on an exit ramp and four guys jumped out ready to fight. I was on the phone with 911 at this point and tried talking to who I assumed was the driver through my window telling him they can't be throwing stuff at people's cars like that, the other guys were jumping around the front of my car the entire time taunting me to get out. I felt at that time if I didn't do something they would try and force me out of the car, so I presented my carry weapon and ordered them to back up loudly several times.  Once they saw I had a weapon one of them actually got even more aggressive, but the guy who I was talking who actually got a semi decent view of the weapon since it was dark, grabbed them and pushed them towards their vehicle and told them to get in. They fled the scene while I was on the line with the dispatcher, the dispatcher instructed me not to follow when I asked if he wanted me to. The cops never showed up to take a report because they could not find my location, after waiting for 5-10 mins for a responding officer I left because he wasn't where the dispatcher said he was, stopped at the top of the exit ramp. I was already running late to work because of the incident so I told the dispatcher I had to get to work and he gave me the okay to leave the scene.   They seemed like a bunch of stupid kids fresh outta high school with a wannabe gangster mentality to be honest. I'm just glad no one got hurt and after inspection I didn't really find any damage to my car."

I was leaving a movie theater with one of my friends. I must have been like 15 because I couldn't drive and was waiting to get picked up. So me and my buddy are just standing out front of the theatre kind of off towards the side. I don't know where they came from but several (probably somewhere between 6-9) idiots come up and surround us and start asking us questions about what we have. ""What's in your pockets?"" type stuff. I always carry a knife, but I did NOT want that to be known lest these folks decide I'm dangerous. Mind you the biggest one was my size, and my buddy was quite a bit taller than me. That certainly didn't stop them from targeting us though. So fortunately the biggest one is immediately to my right. I move my hands slowly to rest on my pockets to cover the knife. I managed to talk them down and they eventually moved on after a few minutes of hassling us. I didn't like the situation at all and had no intent of going physical (mainly because there's no chance it would have ended well for the two of us), but if it seemed like that was imminent my plan was to throw an elbow in the closest guy's throat, push him aside and then run. It wasn't all that far back to a place with a bunch of witnesses who would have intervened. They really had no sort of defensive posture, so I'm pretty certain I could have landed that. I guess having a plan, even a simple and imperfect one, helped me have the confidence to verbally defuse the situation."

He was banging on the door, hitting it with his shoulder, yanking the knob, all while yelling in Spanish. Through the door I told him to go away, that he had the wrong place, that I was calling the cops, etc. I called 911, told them the situation, they transferred me to the local PD, saying it wasn't an emergency if the door was locked. Local PD told me to call 911, that it was an emergency, and that they needed to dispatch someone. I got a hold of 911 and they dispatched it. My wife and I waited for 45 minutes while the guy screamed at our door, the whole time we were inside, I was holding a katana from my nerdier days as a teenager, but didn't want to make a move to the door. The cops showed up, the guy ran away, and the cops didn't even come to my door to take a statement, they just left after seeing him run.  Two weeks later he was back, this time I threw open the door with the katana and yelled at him. He left in a hurry. We ended up going to the apartment office and got approval for a transfer to another community without a transfer fee.  I now live in a home in a much nicer area in the burbs. I also own a handgun.

You're not required to answer his questions or volunteer any info. But I doubt it would get left at that, if he asked you directly. Definitely do not lie. If the question is addressed to the entire vehicle, keeping mouth shut and letting everyone else murmur a truthful ""no"" is your best shot. Maybe joke that you have no bazookas or hand grenades if you get put on the spot? (good luck!)  The law (though it is unenforceable) specifically states that when asked for ID while carrying, you display your CHL. So, if you want to be gee-wiz law-abiding, best you can hope for is quietly slide it to him (as if it were your DL) and try and catch his eye or something and hope he can understand and be discreet. Your chances of success are... not high.

And only then just so he wouldn't freak out on me.    Sec. 411.205.  REQUIREMENT TO DISPLAY LICENSE.  If a license holder is carrying a handgun on or about the license holder's person when a magistrate or a peace officer demands that the license holder display identification, the license holder shall display both the license holder's driver's license or identification certificate issued by the department and the license holder's handgun license.   No penalty, no nothing, just ""the license holder shall"" followed by a pissed off cop and a bunch of alienated ""friends."" It's a pretty good percentage bet if you really don't want to get outed: avoid the direct question and don't get frisked. My advice, get better friends or get it in the open and help them get over their hoplophobia. Sometimes we don't give people enough credit."
CCW,3d5qdi,Guy_Dudebro,2,Mon Jul 13 19:55:01 2015 UTC,Maybe joke that you have no bazookas or hand grenades if you get put on the spot?  try and catch his eye or something and hope he can understand   These are two very bad pieces of advice.  Doing either of these things will raise suspicions at best and make you look fucking crazy at worst.
CCW,3d5qdi,thatsaqualifier,7,Tue Jul 14 23:39:09 2015 UTC,If the officer asks you for your ID then you have to give him your concealed handgun permit as well. If he doesn't ask you for ID then you're fine and don't have to inform.
CCW,3d5qdi,slalomz,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:19:14 2015 UTC,This.  Duty to inform only comes into play if you are asked for your ID.
CCW,3d5qdi,alinius,6,Tue Jul 14 18:48:27 2015 UTC,"While I offer up front my permit and the fact I am carrying if I am stopped while driving as a passenger I don't say a word.  Unless a cop asks me directly if I am armed I don't say anything, but if they ask for ID I pass over my ccw permit as well.  That's only happened once and the cop didn't even look at my permit, just handed it back.    And my antigun friends don't know I carry.  The times they've asked I wasn't carrying it (because we were at parties and drinking) so now they assume I never carry it.  If they did know they'd fuck with me constantly so it's just easier."

CCW,3d5qdi,m1_ping,2,Tue Jul 14 13:13:13 2015 UTC,"As a passenger you may not be obligated to inform, I would imagine that the law varies by state on this, and even still it's probably a grey area dictated by case law (there may be none).  I can't think of any way to inform the officer you are carrying without your friends overhearing. Once you inform the officer they are going to ask for your permit/license (save Arkansas and Alaska). I don't see anyway around it."
CCW,3d5qdi,DoktorKruel,0,Mon Jul 13 20:22:14 2015 UTC,"Generally a passenger is not ""stopped"" or detained when a vehicle is pulled over for a traffic violation. If Texas' law is like many other states, duty to notify is dependably on the licensee being personally detained. I'd also be surprised if you're required to show ID to an officer who has no reasonable suspicion that you've broken any laws."

Had the unloaded gun/empty mag out of the gun/ammo in original box all in a hardcase I bought and had a non-TSA lock on. Got to the counter and the guy was real chill about it, just asked me to open the case. I wasn't sure if he wanted me to rack the slide or not so I just left it sitting there and he said it was fine.   Gave me an orange slip that I had to sign saying it was unloaded and put in in my suitcase but outside the gun case. I then went to oversized bagged where TSA opened the suitcase, but not the hardcase, and checked for explosives.   On the return trip the only thing different was they put the orange unloaded tag inside the hardcase.   I did not have a lock on the suitcase but looking back that was pretty stupid of me. I will get a TSA lock next time for the suitcase.  PS I am glad I took my gun to ATL. The grocery store across from our hotel had bars on the window and the cashier was behind bulletproof glass! I had to walk <5 mins from the hotel to a testing center and on the way back at 10PM the guy told me to get a ride... crazy! I didn't run into any trouble though, even on the MARTA which we rode every day.   Also, just a heads up: Georgia aquarium uses a wand on you. I heard they have lockers for guns but not sure if that is for cops only, so I left my gun during that day. They held my pocket knife for me. CNN has a real metal detector and also held my knife.

CCW,3d72gv,patsfann,1 point,Tue Jul 14 03:03:16 2015 UTC,Another vote for the LCP Custom here. I also have an XD but very rarely carry it as I just prefer the comfort of the LCP pocket carry way more.
CCW,3d72gv,atomicboy,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:14:56 2015 UTC,I carry a Shield all year. Hides just as well with a tee shirt or a coat.
CCW,3d72gv,theadguy,1 point,Tue Jul 14 04:59:50 2015 UTC,"I'm considering a Shield. Do you have the stock trigger or have you done the Apex DCAEK? How does it compare in your opinion to Glocks, Walther PPS, etc?"
CCW,3d72gv,dayz2gunz,3,Tue Jul 14 15:18:23 2015 UTC,"I love my Shield 9, stock trigger is good but not fantastic.. but factory striker triggers usually aren't. I can't mod it/against CCW rules in my county.  I like Glocks too, but perversely one of the things I really like about the Shield is the external safety. It's a good, satisfyingly solid click that doesn't at all seem like it can be (de)activated accidentally. Fires like a dream, I am actually more accurate with this than most of the longer-barrel pistols I've shot. Recoil is awesomely manageable for a small gun.  The Shield is worth the ~$400 price tag, great for waist concealing. For OP, you could drop it in some cargo shorts, but it's just a tad too big to carry in your average jeans without printing some. You can remora it and I doubt most people would think it's a gun, but it is bulky. It's a fantastic and relatively cheap carry piece.  The p238 is my suggestion for a 'pocket gun', i.e. something you always want to fit in a pocket. Expect to pay anywhere from around $5-600 new or like new for the basics. Works like a 1911 in miniature. I really like the fact the slide locks back and breakdown is similar to the biggies. Alternately, I've fired an LCP, same size, but a rough fire, not smooth, beats you up at the range but it is an effective pocket gun."
CCW,3d72gv,theadguy,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:30:10 2015 UTC,Thanks for the info!
CCW,3d72gv,atomicboy,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:47:17 2015 UTC,"I have the stock trigger. It has a heavy pull (around 6.5 to 7 lbs) but it's real crisp. With a little range time it's a real accurate gun. For me, I find it's best to shoot it like a revolver, you know, first joint of trigger finger. If you use the pad, the recoil will move your pad off. I'm going to keep the stock trigger as I really like it. I've put the Apex trigger's in full size M&P's and while it reduced the pull a lot, I didn't really like the feel. The Glocks are completely different feels. I don't know how to explain it but I shoot them just fine. Same with Walthers. Guess I'm saying that I feel more comfortable with a strong pull. It's like an extra safety. But try to shoot them all or at least dry fire them. Hope that helps."
CCW,3d72gv,hotvomit,1 point,Wed Jul 15 04:07:18 2015 UTC,I'm happy with my m&p bodyguard 380
CCW,3d72gv,Captinfucker,1 point,Tue Jul 14 06:49:50 2015 UTC,"The best pocket pistol is the p238. It's also one of the heaviest, so definitely account for that. If it's too heavy or bulky look at the S&W bodguard or ruger LCP"
CCW,3d72gv,Isuspectnargles,1 point,Tue Jul 14 13:57:15 2015 UTC,My Kahr CM9 works well in a pocket.  It's about as small as you're going to get without going down to a .380.
CCW,3d72gv,nerdburg,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:26:33 2015 UTC,Beretta Pico or the Kahr 380.
CCW,3d72gv,AaKkisa,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:54:41 2015 UTC,"My Kahr P380 is one of my favorite guns to shoot. Comfortable, great trigger, hides well and doesn't hurt your hand after shooting it a lot. Give it a look. It is a bit pricey compared to others but it is worth it."
CCW,3d72gv,pm_me_your_poop_plz,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:41:43 2015 UTC,XDS is just like the XDM but smaller. Pocketable if you wear cargo pants.
CCW,3d72gv,Lucky61611,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:03:48 2015 UTC,I have an XDM 3.8 9mm that I carry in the winter. When I want smaller I carry a sig938 in an alien gear iwb holster. It is heavy in a pocket. When I really want to pocket carry I have a ruger LCP with the viridian laser. It's great. Light. Laser makes up for horrible sights and it is instant on when it comes out of the holster. If you go with a LCP I recommend the grip sleeve. Can't remember who makes it but makes it easier on the hand when you practice.
CCW,3d72gv,El_Zalo,0,Wed Jul 15 08:23:01 2015 UTC,"All true pocket guns are a pain to shoot. I carry my full size Springfield XD as much as I can, but I switch to the Shield when I want to be a little more discreet. I can conceal a Shield IWB with almost any attire. I'm 5'9"" and also 190 lb."
CCW,3d72gv,nagurski03,4,Tue Jul 14 05:24:36 2015 UTC,This bot seems like it would be more annoying than helpful on a sub like this.
CCW,3d5tr9,uberphaser,5,Mon Jul 13 19:26:54 2015 UTC,"Excellent gun. I have four S&W semiauto 9mms including my carry gun, a 5906.  Solid reliable firearms."
CCW,3d5tr9,Mr_Weebles,3,Mon Jul 13 19:33:14 2015 UTC,"Cool, thank you - matches what I have read. Sounds like a great deal on a solid, reliable everyday CCW."
CCW,3d5tr9,CoverIsCode3,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:20:55 2015 UTC,"I've fired the stainless version, the 669, many times. They're great guns for their age. Still competitive today."
CCW,3d5tr9,phungus_mungus,4,Tue Jul 14 02:38:19 2015 UTC,I miss my little 3913. It was one of the best compact 9mm's I've ever owned.
CCW,3d5tr9,Dr_WLIN,2,Mon Jul 13 21:01:28 2015 UTC,$300 is a very fair price if the gun has minimal cosmetic defects.   Most accurate hand gun that I have ever shot. Loved mine but sold it to my brother because it was too heavy for an EDC.
CCW,3d5tr9,hotvomit,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:50:11 2015 UTC,"Great gun, only downside is the magazine disconnected safety. If that bothers you at all. I think the old logic behind those were if you got in a struggle with someone over your gun you could hit the magazine release and the gun is unusable after that. My old man was one and several older Smith autos and they've all been totally reliable."
CCW,3d5tr9,Loflyer94,2,Tue Jul 14 01:37:47 2015 UTC,The S&W magazine safety is easily removed.
CCW,3d5tr9,jcalvinmarks,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:35:28 2015 UTC,"That was my very first handgun. I bought it from my dad.  I loved it when I carried it, and I still have a soft spot for them. They're great guns and it will do just fine as a carry piece. But I'm not sure I'd carry it now (if I hadn't sold it back to my dad). It's not as ""compact"" as some of the compact guns you can get now. It's also heavier. And it's got the DA/SA trigger mechanism. If you like it that way, then there's nothing wrong with it. But I like a consistent trigger pull with a thumb safety (Ruger SR9c, Browning Hi Power, or H&K USPc V1), and I definitely don't like safety mechanisms on the slide.  For $300, I'd buy it and enjoy the crap out of it. But I think I'd carry something different."
