The real problem with the leopards speed is Gaijin can't model the 4x transmission properly so we currently have 7 forward gears. Whereas in real life the Leopard was probably always near 2200 RPM (optimal rev range) in game we can't even get close to it."
Warthunder,3e253m,WhiteknightPhaggot,21,Tue Jul 21 11:52:29 2015 UTC,"i actually doubt that this is a problem as you can see t34 transmissions operate even better than they did irl with amazing efficiency and acceleration and so do most russian tanks even the kv series seems nimble and fast compared to rl footage of those lumbering bunkers .  on the other hand german tanks and to some degree american tanks have a long history of mobility nerfs , bugs and in general incompetence and lazyness in their design .   by now i doubt this is just incompetence its deliberate just like the unhistorical nerfs and reload rate "" ballancing""  hell the devs even use fire chance to "" ballance"" nonrussian tanks"
Warthunder,3e253m,Sagr0,-9,Tue Jul 21 13:49:36 2015 UTC,"Or, you know, it could just be a bug.  Why do you even play a game which you believe that the developers of it are evil?"
Warthunder,3e253m,Argetnyx,10,Tue Jul 21 15:28:21 2015 UTC,"Because despite the blatant bias that half of this subreddit ( sekrit gaijin shills not included) refuses to believe exists, the game is still fun? We're allowed to complain about a game we otherwise enjoy - not sure why thats such a hard concept to grasp. Professional players of other games often criticize certain aspects of them - their issues just tend to be actual in-game issues where ours tend to be the developers who insist on claiming they strive for historical accuracy while arbitrarily deciding what is historically accurate - WHICH, are usually decisions that benefit the USSR. The irony of Gaijin being a Russian company is not lost on us.  Does that explain it?"

I dont see the sources for suggestions for fixes that would positively effect USSR vehicles being called propaganda with no other reason than a ""because we said so"".   You're so eager to call us needlessly paranoid, you ignore the reasons why we speak up in the first place.

You don't see it because you're wearing blinders focusing on what you want to see, which are the Russian examples. Every nation has its shining rays of bullshit but other nations aren't Russia so people tend to ignore them. Right now I think the absolute funniest example is how many people rave about the T-54 1947 being 7.7, but get sheepish and look the other way when you point out the Leopard is as well.    The biggest regret I have in this game is devoting so much time (and eagles) to my German tanks, not because they're weak (they're better now than they've ever been, trust me) but because my teammates are frequently insufferable defeatists. It's a bit hypocritical since I used to get pretty angry too, but I didn't let it blind me to the improvements that kept coming. There are still people who think the Tiger H1 is underpowered, holy shit. Thankfully the pilot teams seem pretty cool still, aside from the odd weirdo in a Ho 229 incredulous about a Bearcat on his tail.   I dont see the sources for suggestions for fixes that would positively effect USSR vehicles being called propaganda with no other reason than a ""because we said so"".

It's important to distinguish max possible and max allowable- I believe it's been mentioned elsewhere that an M18 operating at the max possible would break down very quickly, but I cannot provide a source for that quote.    edit: I don't want to link the scans since I'm not sure about the rules/legality, but you can find the 1953 very easily through Google; the 1947, however, was a pain in the ass to find."

Warthunder,3e253m,Sardaukar_DS,4,Tue Jul 21 18:51:17 2015 UTC,"I mean in the sense that there are actions that might cause something to fall apart (the tanks that broke down before they were rated to do so, the large guns in some planes that might blow the engine out when fired, the neutral steering that might turn the gearing into a pretzel, the rocket engines that might turn the pilot into red paste) and actions that will definitely, quickly cause something to fail (like running the PSU in your computer at the wattage listed on the box for more than a few minutes, or careering a tank as fast as it can possibly go)."
Warthunder,3e253m,Dressedw1ngs,2,Tue Jul 21 19:00:14 2015 UTC,Tiger using its neutral turning would break down as well..
Warthunder,3e253m,Sardaukar_DS,6,Tue Jul 21 16:49:39 2015 UTC,"And Panthers could catch fire. There are some allowances to be made for things that might happen, like a complex transmission falling apart sometimes when a particular task is asked of it, compared to things that will definitely happen, like a motor killing itself by being pushed to 100% strain. It's only an 8 kmh difference, anyway- the T-34 for instance also has a lower allowed speed than the max you'll find listed on most websites."

Warthunder,3e2d6r,ReachForTheSky_,2,Tue Jul 21 15:10:57 2015 UTC,It feels like 150 - 200 meters that I engage on so I guess it's around  115 mm pen? Should still work fine. Maybe I'm just unlucky...

Warthunder,3e2d6r,awFirestarter,2,Tue Jul 21 19:02:15 2015 UTC,I guess it's just all about the angle. At what angle you are diving and how the target is angled to you. According to this the 129B3 should be able to pen the front of a lot of tanks. I need to try it out again.

Warthunder,3e2d6r,Mafaka322,3,Tue Jul 21 13:01:39 2015 UTC,The 103's HVAP will take out tanks up to T4 (and even some T5s) from the side and (almost) anything below from the front. T-34s don't really stand a chance against it.  I guess that getting the guns on target with the Me 410 is substantially harder than it is with the Kugelblitz. Add in needing a bit of sustained fire for kills and it makes sense that the ground version would be significantly more effective.
Warthunder,3e2d6r,FreakDC,4,Tue Jul 21 14:13:32 2015 UTC,All player tanks aren't taking proper damage from the larger plane cannons.

Warthunder,3e2d6r,Mafaka322,0,Tue Jul 21 13:51:05 2015 UTC,"It is a bug or a devs mistake, since AP-I and API-T have different penetrations, and it doesnt seems like it really has 37mm penetration ingame."

The Shvaks were probably the weakest 20mm cannons of mid/late WW2 (muzzle energy wise), they were extremely weight efficient though. Even the 20mm Mg 151, with 115g projectiles at 720 m/s, had a slightly higher muzzle energy with AP (29890 J).

Warthunder,3e2d6r,Wanhope,-1,Tue Jul 21 14:14:40 2015 UTC,"Funny thing is that the number they have in game is actually almost spot on, and possibly even overperforming, assuming these numbers are correct. Most documents I have found say that it could penetrate 25mm of RHA at 400m, and according to the in game values it penetrates 25mm at 500m. The killing power of the VYa-23 came from the fact that it had a pretty damn meaty round that it fired, and once it penetrated, all hell broke loose inside the target. IRL, at any given point in the war, all nations fielded a wide range of tanks, to fulfill many battlefield roles. The way the MM is in war thunder, I feel that it looses a lot of the potential for fun and balanced gameplay via a method I like to call perfect imbalance. But I'm getting off topic."
Warthunder,3e2d6r,SteelSaxon,2,Tue Jul 21 16:35:00 2015 UTC,Would you like to explain that method?
Warthunder,3e2d6r,magiricod,2,Tue Jul 21 17:01:29 2015 UTC,"Basically, when applying the concept to war thunder, the MM is made to be based on Service periods as opposed to arbitrary values assigned in a futile attempt to directly balance what cannot be balanced. So, consider the fact that the BT-5, BT-7, T-26, T-70, T-80, and T-50 were all phased out of service only in 1945, and you start to understand what I mean by perfect imbalance. A T-26 can be placed into a 1945 game, but as long as you give light tanks like the T-26 a clear benefit and role that they can fulfill, and give players good reasons to play them, you will see much more balanced and varied gameplay at all tiers. (I'm just going by Ground forces right now because it provides the best illustration of the variance.)  Of course, there would be many mechanics needed to prevent some logical extremes of the idea, such as a team of all M22 locusts vs all Tiger II(H)s. Additionally, some periods may need to be adjusted slightly to give one side a fighting chance, such as in 1941 vs Russians, by in this example, skipping the period where there were no jury rigged stop gaps (mostly pak38s strapped to half tracks and light TDs, and the Marder series) so that the Germans will have some means to deal with the KV-1 and T-34.  The biggest thing that it would probably hinge on is a method of limiting certain vehicles based on how rare/common they were at a given timeframe, although a different approach would probably be needed for Air forces, because then 9/10 times you'd have all B-17s except 1 P-51 on an American team! Bombers seem to offer a conundrum with any system you try.  As for certain vehicles that are prototypes and/or paper, simply make an educated guess as to when the could have realistically been fielded had time/resources allowed it, or while also keeping a close eye on overall balance of it. So Maus would be late 1945/1946 despite having been built in 1944, simply because that would be stupidly OP in a 1944 match.  The idea has its flaws, but I think it'd be better than what we have now."

Fixed a problem which caused a loss of control while rolling with multi-engine aircraft, when ailerons and wings were damaged. Added a new parameter: “Automatic flaps control”, to the instructor settings. Added the display of armour-piercing shell penetration values for aircraft. Added the display of modification improvement descriptions for ground vehicles. Fixed surges in engine power caused by switching compressor gears. Fixed pitch handling problems in several aircraft when the setting “simplified joystick” is enabled in the “simplified controlling” mode.

It was possible that these modules wouldn’t catch fire or wouldn’t explode by damage from secondary fragments in some situations. Fixed the display of damage shown for enemies during hitcam playback. Now it shows the status of the modules after the last hit. (Previously it only displayed the relative damage of the last hit). Fixed lack of shell explosions inside vehicles during a hit and in deathcam, if the vehicle was destroyed by other destroying shell factors (secondary fragments or direct contact with a crew member). The correct distribution of ammo pack for BT-5, BT-7, SU-100, SU-122P, SU-76М, Т-34-100 has been introduced. Fixed a bug with resetting the reloading process by hitting the gunner, and the lack of resetting the reloading process by hitting the tank loader.

At least in SB.  I get that fuel endurance is easier to portray to players, but the problem is that the selectable fuel loads are all over the place. On some planes, the least amount of fuel you can take is approaching an hour, while others inexplicably can pick ridiculously small fuel loads.  Within the current maps, there is no point at all to have any aircraft carry two hours' worth of fuel. Regular games last only an hour at most. Enduring Confrontation mode of course lasts longer, but the maps are as small as ever, and the primary purpose for a heavy fuel load is to be able to get to a distant combat area, remain effective in combat for a prescribed time, and then be able to return to base safely.  That simply doesn't happen in War Thunder, where in most maps everything is only 10-15 minutes apart. The supercondensed environment generally means that you are already in the combat zone when you take off, and you end up choosing fuel loads for the duration of your effective combat time. There's simply no point in taking massive fuel reserves for transits, when there are no vast distances to cover.  And sometimes it would be nice to be able to take a minimal fuel load to be able to fight as effectively as you can for a short duration."
Warthunder,3e1zz5,IckyOutlaw,3,Tue Jul 21 14:13:13 2015 UTC,The most hilarious example that I know of would be the Fw 200 with 4 hours as minimum load. Most I see never survive for much longer than 5 minutes.
Warthunder,3e1zz5,willkinton247,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:31:32 2015 UTC,"I think the actual reason is actually based on the number and size of the tanks on board in order to remain balanced, especially at take off. For example, the P-47 has two fuel tanks in the fuselage, and a set of tanks in each wing. So the minimum amount (which I think is 45 minutes?) would probably be based on the fuel in just the main fuselage tank, which was 270 gallons. The next level probably is the main + auxiliary fuselage tank for a total of 305 gallons. The highest amount would be both the wing tanks at 90 gallons each, plus the main and auxiliary tanks, giving a total of 550 gallons.   So Gaijin probably just assumes that when filling a plane up, they would fill an entire tank system at a time, which isn't a terribly off-base way to structure it. It's probably way easier for a ground crew to just fill up certain tanks, rather than measure out x gallons which under the expected conditions could last for y many minutes to complete the mission expecting to last z many minutes.   As for the case of the FW200 as mentioned by /u/IckyOutlaw, the FW200 was designed to loiter out in the middle of the ocean for long periods of time. For an aircraft like that, even the minimum of 4 hours would probably be necessary just to ensure balance across the aircraft on takeoff. The FW200 had an endurance time of 14 hours, so compared to that, 4 hours is nothing."
Warthunder,3e1zz5,jk01,3,Tue Jul 21 17:51:52 2015 UTC,The Fw.200 was designed to fly long distances. It was an airliner which was modified to fit bombs during wartime. Loiter time was not a design factor.
Warthunder,3e1zz5,willkinton247,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:22:48 2015 UTC,"Yes, and No. As usual with history, the truth is kind of in between.   The civilian FW200 did have a long range, which is why it was adapted into a maritime patrol aircraft. That being said, this is what the interior of the maritime FW200 looked like (yes I know it is a model, but it's the best picture I could find). Those fuel tanks were put in there to give it a loiter capability well beyond what the airline version was capable of.   So if anything, it was designed to fly long distances as an airliner, and then redesigned to fly long distances and then loiter for a while looking for ships."

Warthunder,3e1zz5,Wanhope,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:30:37 2015 UTC,"The only reasons I can imagine are the follwing:   their code is fucked and they don't feel like unfucking it to account for variations of fuel, as they coded it to specific allotments. For balance purposes they make planes have specific fuel load outs so it impacts performance to a measured degree.    Since you know players would find optimal fuel loads for best performance for the average time in a match and we also know Gaijin hates having to actually test stuff."
Warthunder,3e1zz5,HerraTohtori,2,Tue Jul 21 16:00:47 2015 UTC,"their code is fucked   Could be.  I know for a fact that last time I test flew the He 162, fuel on board had no influence on the aircraft's top speed. The terminal speed was the same with full fuel load as it was with fumes in the tank. Climb rate, acceleration and maneuverability seem to be improved with less fuel, though I didn't actually perform timed tests for them with different fuel amounts so that's just based on the ""feel"" for how the plane behaves when maneuvering.  Better climb, turn and acceleration is what one would expect with reduced mass of course, but level flight top speed should also be affected at least a little. But it wasn't...  Which is really rather dodgy in my books."
Warthunder,3e1zz5,Wanhope,24,Tue Jul 21 17:22:56 2015 UTC,"Yeah they definitely aren't doing a true aero model, it's more like fixed max values with adjusted rates.  I think the simplifications start to show at the extremes. It actually makes it even less forgivable that stuff takes so long to fix."
Warthunder,3e1zz5,HerraTohtori,6,Tue Jul 21 17:24:53 2015 UTC,"To be fair, I feel obliged to point out that the concept of ""true model"" is an oxymoron.  Every physics simulation is an approximation to some degree or other. Sometimes you have to cut corners to get acceptable performance (or, in physics simulations, acceptable run time when your main concern is not about getting a consumer grade GPU run your sim at solid 60 FPS). But you need to be careful that you cut the corners that hopefully affect the accuracy of the results least...  The really confusing part is that coding something like arbitrary speed caps is actually more complicated than just letting the aircraft's performance parametres and the game engine to sort out how fast the aircraft will go (ie. at what speed the thrust equals drag, acceleration flattens out to zero and speed stabilizes to top speed).  The only even vaguely good reason I can think of for implementing arbitrary limits (or exceptions that take over from the proper simulation) is if they are having serious problems balancing certain aircraft's performance to match the supposed values at different altitudes. For example, if they make the He 162 perform normally at sea level, it might end up too fast or too slow at its optimal altitude - depending on how accurate or inaccurate their atmospheric model, engine model, and general flight model for the aircraft is. Doing a proper balancing would then require carefully tuning, say, the engine or plane flight model in order to match the historical performance stats of the aircraft.  But if you don't have time to do that properly, it might be tempting to just throw in a catch-all speed limit that doesn't properly care about the physics even if it creates an illusion or impression of being ""almost right"".  Personally I'm hoping they will at some point properly address that accursed aircraft and, among other things, give it its missing 50 km/h at all altitudes at 100% full 108% thrust. At full 108% boost 100% power setting, the maximum speeds are actually historically accurate, but of course they should also improve when the plane becomes lighter.  Could be interesting to do the same fuel-burning weight test with other jets, to see if their top speeds are affected at all.  EDIT: derp"
Warthunder,3e1zz5,Wanhope,17,Tue Jul 21 17:38:24 2015 UTC,"depending on how accurate or inaccurate their atmospheric model, engine model,    I think you might be on to something, I was reading stuff on the forums where the atmosphere modelling gets pretty out of whack at high alt, which was making very high altitude aircraft even less desirable to fly than the meta-game was already doing.  Considering the patchy jobs done to fix other elements of the game, it wouldn't surprise be that they went with the ""good enough for most applications"" solution if they hit any difficulties."
Warthunder,3e1zz5,HerraTohtori,6,Tue Jul 21 17:52:00 2015 UTC,"It's still pretty disappointing that a ~500 kg weight difference on a plane that weighs 1,660 kg empty and 2,800 kg fully loaded doesn't make any difference in level speed.  Personally, I would consider that a bug. If it's intentional, then whoever put that in the game doesn't understand aerodynamics well enough to be making decisions for coding a flight simulator.

Warthunder,3e1zz5,HerraTohtori,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:06:52 2015 UTC,"Probably worth it, if the issue is still present. I can't really play War Thunder at the moment because the PC at my parents' is made of wood, but I should be able to gather the evidence in about two or three weeks - not exactly sure about my scheduling for the rest of the summer.  If the issue is still present, then the evidence would just basically be a video and CLOG of climbing to optimal altitude (6000 metres IIRC) with the He 162 in Test Flight with limited fuel enabled, then accelerate to top speed at 108% throttle, which was 860 km/h when I last checked, and then just fly straight and level until the fuel runs out. The video should show TAS (or SPD) on the HUD.  Actually it would be good to have the same test done at 100% thrust as well to see if there's any weight-based performance variance there, below the ""absolute"" speed cap.  Just be warned that it's going to take quite a while to do this test because the fuel flow actually decreases at high altitudes, even though fuel pressure remains the same on the indicator. Which is of course yet another bug that really shouldn't happen on the very early jet engines, they were fully manually controlled and there was no ECU to maintain correct stoichiometric fuel-air ratio... so if the pilot had the throttle (fuel pressure) set at a higher than optimal setting, all the extra fuel at high power settings simply created a dark smoke trail. I suspect this might be tied to the magical ECU that prevents flameouts, compressor stalls and engine fires from advancing or retarding the throttles too rapidly in early jets.  Because of this, flying an He 162 at high altitude will extend its endurance well past the historical ~30 minutes at full power."

It was possible that these modules wouldn’t catch fire or wouldn’t explode by damage from secondary fragments in some situations. Look up air-fuel mixtures, goddamnit.   You really should have left that last one ""unfixed"", Gaijin. Fuel tanks didn't explode like in goddamn Michael Bay movies. At least not full ones, or half-full ones. The tank would have to be full of holes and fumes. The holes let in oxygen and the fumes are what ignite. In a confined space the pressure builds up until it explodes. When a full tank is lit on fire this can take minutes or hours as the liquid fuel boils and pressure slowly builds. For a tank full of fumes this can take only a second's exposure to an ignition source. Liquid fuel burns slowly, fumes burn very quickly. It's the fumes that kill.  For aircraft you have fuel bladders and self-sealing tanks that reduce the chances of fires and explosions. For tanks, you generally have firewalls and internal structures reducing or preventing damage from fires and explosions.  Model this goddamn shit properly.

Warthunder,3e0xfz,_Fimbultyr_,5,Tue Jul 21 06:28:20 2015 UTC,"I think it's because of aborted landings. If you approach via the hills, you can easily abort a landing and climb again over the sea. If you approach from the sea, there is no room for errors; if you have to abort and/or can't break, you dig into the hill. No way you can gain speed and altitude fast enough."

It was able to drop it while upside down looping and the bomb kept going upwards, curved over and fall down behind to explode. http://imgur.com/qEWuvXT,zhVyThN http://imgur.com/qEWuvXT,zhVyThN#1  That wiki diagram image is rubbish though. The bomb isn't released during the straight up vertical part, or it would never go backwards (Look at the bomb line it magically shoots backwards after going straight up) If the bomb is released in the flying upside down part of the loop then it will go backwards with the speed you were flying backwards when you launched it (roughly.)"
Warthunder,3e0tfn,Vanzig,3,Tue Jul 21 03:53:38 2015 UTC,"It's designed for nuclear bombing though, if memory serves. As such it wouldn't be much use in WT with any bomb. Just for fun, the nuclear capable aircraft in WT are:  USA:   F-84G (-B is present in game) could carry 1x Mk.7 nuclear device F-86F-35/F-86H (F-86F-25 is present in game) could carry 1xMk.7 nuclear device F2H-2B (F2H-2 present in game) could carry a single Mk.8 nuclear bomb F9F-8 (F9F-5 present in game) could carry some form of nuclear weapons, likely the MK.7 or Mk.8 AD-4B (nuclear capable skyraider with 4x20mm, not in game) The skyraider would be fitted with the BOAR 30.5"" nuclear rocket image B-29 SILVERPLATE/B-50 (B-29 present in game) B-29 modified with single bomb bay, removed all guns save the tail guns. Could carry Mk.1, and Mk.3 nuclear bomb. (little boy and fat man, respectively) B-57B Could carry probably 2 Mk.7 nuclear bombs   Germany:   CL-13 Mk.6 (Mk.5 present in game) could carry a Mk.7 nuclear bomb   USSR:   Il-28N (Il-28 present in game) Modified bomb bay to carry RDS-4 28 Kiloton nuclear bomb   UK:   Canberra B(i) Mk.6 could carry probably 2xMk.7 or 2xB28 or 5?

WE.177A Avro Shackleton (derived from the Avro Lincoln, which was derived from the Lancaster) Maritime patrol aircraft which could carry maybe 8 nuclear depth charges     so what this comes down to, is that there really isn't a use for LABS in war thunder, due to the lack of delivery platorms, (only 2 in game) and lack of utility for use with non-nuclear weapons"
Warthunder,3e0tfn,whatismoo,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:33:28 2015 UTC,"Wouldn't it depend on where your target is? If your target was almost immediately behind and below, you'd want to be more vertical than horizontal to make a high, but tighter arc.   To me, this method just seems like a dangerous, over complicated way of hitting a target. The math and skill it would take to essentially throw a bomb over your plane to hit a target behind you isn't worth the risk. If you're that unconcerned about accuracy - just drop hundreds of bombs from high altitude and spare the risk to your fighter and pilot."

Warthunder,3e0tfn,Argetnyx,4,Tue Jul 21 04:46:13 2015 UTC,"It would be useful if bombs had their real blast radius, so the big bombs required you to be 5km+ alt or do this kind of manoeuvre to 'get the fuck out of there' before the bomb explodes.

Warthunder,3e0tfn,akronymus,5,Tue Jul 21 17:53:35 2015 UTC,"I think even if you could release it in non-level flight it would just go up and go straight down, I don't think WT accounts for bomb's own drop trajectory/momentum enough to pull off moves like this.   Just tested it in test flight; it just goes up and straight down following the direction that plane was moving towards regardless of the bomb release position, tried it with 2x1000lbs with P-51D-5, none of the bombs dropped near the vehicle I was aiming for, tried to imitate maneuver best as I could,    dive on target  pull up in to loop  drop bombs as plane tips over and changes direction   and bomb still follows the direction that plane was heading before the pull, tried it 5 times but couldn't do it so there might be something wrong with me, it'd be useless in WT anyways, unnecessary waste of bombs, way too many chance of missing the target.  Also, I was able to drop bombs when I was fully inverted after immelmann as well, so there's that, bombs just phased thru my wings."
Warthunder,3e0tfn,Voxination,5,Tue Jul 21 02:40:13 2015 UTC,"goes up and straight down following the direction that plane was moving towards   So, if the plane was just beyond a vertical climb, and bomb released, wouldn't it function as advertised? That is, you're now moving away from your original heading slightly.  Also-     dive on target    Isn't it suppose to be performed from a low altitude approach? If you're coming in high you can release in the dive and avoid the blast. I don't see why this maneuver would be used if you're already diving on your target. It seems meant to avoid this, or performed at a greater height in order to give some time to get away from a larger, nuclear blast, and in that case, accuracy is probably less of a concern.  Also edited the image depiction to represent reality a little bit more."
Warthunder,3e0tfn,merrickx,2,Tue Jul 21 07:37:25 2015 UTC,Thanks for fixing the diagram (good enough for illustration purpose) The backwards speed from the bomb is coming from the backwards speed of the plane beyond the vertical.
Warthunder,3e0tfn,Vanzig,2,Tue Jul 21 08:22:19 2015 UTC,"It was slight dive around starting 700 meters before leveling on 200 to gather speed faster than level flight, also, did another 20 test bombings, only 1 attempt ever got close enough to destroy the vehicle, otherwise its weirdly eliptical bomb drop zone around the vehicle due to my inability to calculate where the bomb will hit.   I can't see use of it in WT other than maybe the base bombings, precision bombing is needed to take out ground targets on combined battles, like you said there's no need to do a convoluted corkscrew just to drop 1000 lbs from fighter plane only to have it miss because its annoyingly inaccurate and inconsistent when you can drop bombs on it and fly away, not to mention maneuver bleeds speed like m26 with nearly busted transmission on prop planes.  Who knows, maybe it works better on jets."
Warthunder,3e0tfn,Voxination,2,Tue Jul 21 08:46:10 2015 UTC,"You're dropping at the top of the loop?  There's your issue.  Follow the diagram, release as you pull just past vertical (90 degress or 1/4 of a full loop)"
Warthunder,3e0tfn,Esenem,0,Tue Jul 21 07:13:55 2015 UTC,"that diagram in OP is a bit rubbish. Launching when straight vertical would definitely make it go straight up and fall straight down, unlike the image.  When I went upside down in a fighter to launch, I released at halfway between straight vertical and backwards. I believe 45 degrees from vertical is supposed to give the optimal distance for most unpowered projectile launches (like tossing a projectile) at 0 altitude. As you increase the altitude, the horizontal velocity is much more important for how far the projectile goes. At 0 you'd want to fling it, if you're cruising at 5000m up it'll travel furthest if you drop it at your max speed rather than upwards."
Warthunder,3e0tfn,Vanzig,4,Tue Jul 21 08:17:25 2015 UTC,Allow me to quote myself:   just past vertical   ...hence giving it a parabolic trajectory.

WW2 bombs were - scientifically put - utter shit when it came to ballistics. They were HORRIBLE. That's one reason for why level bombings even in good conditions using the Norden bomb sight couldn't hit diddly squat and you needed to figuratively rain bombs on the enemy to score a few single-digit decent hits.  Some time after WW2 bombs dramatically improved in aerodynamic design (i.e. got more bullet-shaped) giving them more stability in flight and as such more predictable and accurate hits, but a WW2 bomb wouldn't be even close to a decently stable ballistic arc if tossed, and especially not over the shoulder."

Warthunder,3e160s,invertedwut,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:05:31 2015 UTC,"It's less hordes and more repeat offenders. american medium and heavy bombers are probably the most popular, with maybe german mid tier german and japanese medium bombers behind them, and at later tiers you start seeing russians more often. especially in the il-28.  I can't say how often I see 20mm YERs, that dorsal gun is pretty good, but its mag is really small, and being only one gun it requires some better gunnery than a pair of 50s. I'm more scared of a b-25 than a yer. And maybe someone else can say otherwise, but I think british bombers are the most rare.  I think the biggest reason for the american bomber popularity is a mixture of turret coverage and ammo load. All of the other bombers comparable to the b-25 or b-17 either don't have as good armament, or fire a shitty cartridge, or just carry smaller magazines."

Than I found my love for the A1 and the Jap A5. I think the A1 is absolutly awesome. When it is not uptiered (I hate it to fly alongside A4s with it) it is incredibly deadly. It can literally run away from anything on the battlefield and it teaches you great trigger and accuracy discipline. It flies just like the later 190s and that at 3.3 BR.  After beeing so angry about the USSR / US bomber spam when playing japan, I bought the jap A5 and for some strange reason I do absolutly great in it. I think the Jap A5 is the only plane I have a positive KDR in SB with. I think it is the mix of Zeros and Ki43s that allow the butcher bird to merciless slaughter the enemies. When I take my German A4 or A5 against Russia I do quite well, but not as good as in the Jap a5. The FM is the same, right?  The entire 190 series are by far my favorite planes in the entire game, especially for SB where I just can't get the 109s to work reliably for me (stupid visibility). I really whish to fly with together with you one day! Do you usually fly alone or do you have some squadmates? It would be really funny to hear you talking German over TS when I only know your english voice from your awesome videos :D  Keep up the great work!

Warthunder,3e0zsa,Kutya7701,7,Tue Jul 21 07:16:59 2015 UTC,AFAIK it was because sometimes people used Decals to make their tanks appear destroyed in sim and realistic battles as the name didn't appear over their heads. Still silly to remove it from planes tho.

Warthunder,3e1z3t,shadowphanto,7,Tue Jul 21 11:25:56 2015 UTC,"Patch notes -  Update 21.07.2015 (1.51.8.22)  Improvements and fixes have been made to the interface. Fixed a problem which caused a loss of control while rolling with multi-engine aircraft, when ailerons and wings were damaged. Added a new parameter: “Automatic flaps control”, to the instructor settings. Added the display of armour-piercing shell penetration values for aircraft. Added the display of modification improvement descriptions for ground vehicles. Fixed surges in engine power caused by switching compressor gears. Fixed pitch handling problems in several aircraft when the setting “simplified joystick” is enabled in the “simplified controlling” mode. Fixed a bug where the damage cam displayed modules incorrectly (in yellow colour). Fixed an incorrect response caused by damaging the fuel tanks and ammunition load with secondary fragments. It was possible that these modules wouldn’t catch fire or wouldn’t explode by damage from secondary fragments in some situations. Fixed the display of damage shown for enemies during hitcam playback. Now it shows the status of the modules after the last hit. (Previously it only displayed the relative damage of the last hit). Fixed lack of shell explosions inside vehicles during a hit and in deathcam, if the vehicle was destroyed by other destroying shell factors (secondary fragments or direct contact with a crew member). The correct distribution of ammo pack for BT-5, BT-7, SU-100, SU-122P, SU-76М, Т-34-100 has been introduced. Fixed a bug with resetting the reloading process by hitting the gunner, and the lack of resetting the reloading process by hitting the tank loader. Fixed the colour of the winter camouflage for the KV-1 with the KwK-40 cannon. Balance changes have taken effect on “Normandy” and “Kuban”. The errors during the ground vehicles tutorial have been fixed. Refined the weight of the Browning M3 shells. Increased the altitude where clouds begin to form for all game modes. Fixes and changes have been applied to the following aircraft models: Bf.109 (all models), Fw.190A-1, Fw.190A-4, Fw.190A-5, I-16 typ 5, Ki-43, Mosquito FB Mk.XVIII, Tempest MK2, Yak-9M, B7A2, A-36, Pe-2-83, Pе-3 (all models). Fixes and changes have been applied to the following ground vehicle models: KV-1B 756(r), Leopard I, Ferdinand, 10,5cm Tiger II, Pz.Bfw.VI (P), T-10M, ИС-2 обр.1944, IS-2 Avenger, SU-100Y, СМК, Т-26-5, Т-35, Т-34-100, М47. For the T-10M, the anti-aircraft machine gun has been enabled. New sounds have been introduced for the KPVT machine gun. New sounds have been introduced for the L7 and M68 cannons. Changed fuel consumption levels on the following A6M aircraft:     A6M2N - flight time with a full fuel tank and 100% throttle: 2 hours     A6M2/model 11 - flight time with a full fuel tank and 100% throttle: 1 hour 40 minutes     A5M3 - flight time with a full fuel tank and 100% throttle: 1 hour 08 minutes     A6M3 model 22/model 22 Ko - flight time with a full fuel tank and 100% throttle: 1 hour 24 minutes     A6M5 Ko/Otsu - flight time with a full fuel tank and 100% throttle: 1 hour 24 minutes Refined the fuselage polar for: Yak-1/1-B/7-B/9-P, Т, M, K, U, UT. P-47-D-25/28 - Changed fuel consumption level. Flight time with a full fuel tank and 100% throttle: 1 hour 17 minutes. Hе.112 V-5/А-0 - Refined the fuselage polar, cockpit lights added. I-301, LaGG-3 (all models) - Refined the fuselage polar and tail assembly (exchange rate stability was improved). La (all models except jets) - Refined the fuselage polar and tail assembly (exchange rate stability was improved). F-82E - improved handling at high speeds. Il-10 (all models) - Specified the calculation for the airflow on the horizontal tail surfaces, Inertia calculations updated and damped in all axes. Edited inertia calculations. Bug which allow ground travel outside the minimap on location “Kuban” has been fixed. Fixed a bug, where in the game mode “Break” was possible to respawn on the rocks. Fixed errors related to joining to “Enduring Confrontation” session that is in progress.   http://warthunder.com/en/game/changelog/current/477"

Warthunder,3e0sjo,AzureTsar,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:20:44 2015 UTC,"Mind a Copy paste from last guy who asked?  Okay, so here is a breakdown for both:  IS4M: Probably the easiest of the two. If you are facing him headon, or close to headon, you can shoot through the drivers port on his frontplate. You want to aim for the middle of the vertical (flat) part, as high on it as possible, so you can sneak the round through ''the hole''.. You will most likely have to use HVAP, both versions work. Also, you might pen his lower glacis, especially if he is even slightly higher than you.  IS3: This one can be a tricky bastard. If he is precisely headon to you, you will have to aim for either the ''godshot'', a hole about the size of a baseball, which is only doable from very short range, however it will kill 2/4 crew-members and might ammo rack him. A slightly better target is to the left of the gun shield, there is another (and bigger spot), where the gun shield also doesn't cover the mantlet, however here you can only get the loader (and once in a blue moon an ammorack). However, since both shots take time to aim, use the first round to disable his barrel. Both of these shots also require HVAP (either version works).  Hope this helps you :D"

Warthunder,3e1r9i,A_FriendlyMineTurtle,2,Tue Jul 21 16:39:41 2015 UTC,"Depends on your aim. The IS series is a very bouncy tank, much more so when compared with more square German tanks."
Warthunder,3e1r9i,Wheynweed,2,Tue Jul 21 16:42:44 2015 UTC,IME the IS 1 and 2s are effectively glass cannons. You just aim for the turret cheeks and bam one shot by anything with a hint of explosive filler.

Warthunder,3e3dpy,Argetnyx,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:36:34 2015 UTC,"I don't know if they've ever officially said anything about how the map rotation works, but supposedly, it's an RNG thing.  I DO know that the server does work on some sort of simultaneous rotation.  I can synch up with somebody in a different BR bracket and get on the same map and battle mode, but different games."
Warthunder,3e3l16,piankolada,4,Tue Jul 21 18:14:15 2015 UTC,"Engaging a T-34 from the front is fairly straightforward. They're like a Sherman in that you want to hit the forwardmost part of the hull where the upper and lower sections meet if you have at least 100mm of penetration (which you should have under 500 meters at least). You can also shoot the flatter area where the driver viewport is. If you aren't convinced in your ability to kill it right then and there with those shots, instead shoot the flat chunky thing directly below the cannon barrel. This will almost always disable the cannon and leave the tank defenseless.    The KV-1 is pretty polarized in its defenses. You won't do much without shooting the weak areas, but the weak areas are easy and incredibly potent. Either shoot through the driver viewport or the MG nestled next to it; both of these will send an explosive round into a tight nexus of crew, fuel, and ammo that will cripple the tank. If you can only see the turret, you can go for the edges around the mantlet, but that might be tricky if the KV-1 is smart enough to wiggle it.    For both tanks, if you can see their side they're knicked. Shoot the lower hull directly below the turret to set off the ammo. Try to put the round either between both tracks (risking interception by suspension) or between the upper track and hull skirt (smaller target window)."

Warthunder,3e0lw3,Esperante,2,Tue Jul 21 04:06:48 2015 UTC,"You know the answer, and as a business it makes sense. Why should they give players ease of access to all content in the game instead of putting something in there to make them decide if they want to invest time or money to go further?  They have bills to pay and people to keep employed. If the game were easy from start to finish in unlocking all content, people would fly through the game, unlock everything, get bored from lack of new goals to reach and leave the game which kills the game. Or they would just keep playing for free which in the end kills the game anyway.  Almost all F2P games have a wall players reach where we have to make this decision.

I've always heard from old players that it was the opposite, with German tanks stomping initially. From my experience this was seemingly followed by Russian tanks having the upper hand, then some turbulence featuring America and now things seem pretty good."
Warthunder,3e1g92,Sagr0,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:49:04 2015 UTC,"russians dominated from day 1 of cbt mainly due to generously low br (t34 proto fought german reserve and t1 tanks ) for their tanks as well as several artificial nerfs and bugs on german tanks due to absolute sloppyness and lazy design.  for example german fuses were bugged for months on end leading to russian tanks being able to survive absurd ammounts of shots whereas german tanks usually were crippled in a single hit.   back then crews actually died when they got hit by a shell ... also basically all guns were just as inaccurate as the russian t34 guns because gaijin ...german tanks were slow as a turd and lost all speed when turning as if they had frikking t34 transmissions ...   after a while gaijin actually fixed the german fuses instantly leading to a much more fair gameplay wich obviously lead to russian pounding as the players that played mainly russians relied on their tanks opness and bugs rather than true skill. ( no wonder when they were allmost immune to damage for the longest time)   in this very short timeframe germany dominated on most tiers but more due to the player discrepancies than actual imballance.  gaijin reacted immediately nerfing the german ammo massively , buffing russian tanks and reworking gamemechanics and maps to once again massively favor russian tanks ( kursk got fog and trees , several maps got even more russian facvoring capzones etc etc)   also before gaijin randomized spawns most maps massively favored the russian spawn side either by having 2/3 capzones closer to them or by having the german spawn behind a hill and other really obvious unballanced stuff like kursk where th egerman artilery fired into the ground for half a year despite hundreds of bug reports while the russian artillery could kill german tanks that werent even in line of sight ..."
Warthunder,3e1g92,rdco,3,Tue Jul 21 19:43:49 2015 UTC,Is there any difference to the barrel of a 105mm found in a KT versus the 105mm L7? Abrams?
Warthunder,3e1g92,PyroIite,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:17:10 2015 UTC,"Tiger II KwK46 has a 105mm L/68 gun, which means the barrel has a length of 68*105mm = 7140 mm = 7,14m.  The Royal Ordonance L7 is a 105mm gun which is 5588mm long (so its around L/53).  (For WW2 tanks) a longer bore usually indicates greater muzzle velocity and therefore greater penetration energy. The development of APDS, APFSDS, HEAT, HESH (in the 15 year junger L7 gun) makes this rule not apply. The sub caliber shells of the L7 get additional speed/penetration energy by trading weight and explosive filling for a smaller size/surface (not talking about HESH).    HESH is a plastic explosive head which detonates on the tanks surface emitting a shockwave through the armor plating which generates a fragmentation effect on the crew inside of the tank.  Also the 105mm KwK46 of the Tiger II had a two-piece ammunition consisting of projectile and cartridge while the L7 has single-piece ammunition (which makes it easier to load)."
Warthunder,3e1g92,rdco,4,Tue Jul 21 08:56:22 2015 UTC,Could a KT even fire a more modern shell?
Warthunder,3e1g92,Inkompetent,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:57:38 2015 UTC,"As long as the shell was designed for the twist rate, pressure, and muzzle velocity of the 10,5cm KwK L/68 - sure."
Warthunder,3e1g92,EnricoMicheli,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:44:24 2015 UTC,"Is there something particular about L/52 lenght (L7 is L/52)? There's the 10,5 cm sK 18, the gun on the Dickermax, and also in WoT, don't know how historical they are, there are some 105mm L/52 on the Tiger II and E-50"
Warthunder,3e1g92,Inkompetent,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:33:52 2015 UTC,"In a way - yes. A caliber length of 45-55 somewhere tends to be the optimum compromise between muzzle velocity and accuracy. For example the KwK 40 at 48 calibers, L7 at 53, sK 18 at 52, 2A46 of the T-72/80/90 at 47, ZiS-S-53 of the T-34-85 at 55, etc.  Shorter barrels give poor accuracy over range and most importantly poor muzzle velocity. Extremely long barrels (like the 8,8cm KwK 43 L/71) have extreme muzzle velocities and as such higher barrel wear, you need extra durable shells to survive the barrel, and you get insane recoil length of the gun.  On top of that it is often better to just overmatch the enemy armour (i.e. smack them with an even fatter and heavier shell) rather than to try to penetrate with a needle (extremely long-barreled guns at relatively ""low"" calibers, like the 7,5cm KwK 42 L/70 or 8,8cm KwK 43 L/71) because it both makes the gun more versatile in the different munitions it can fire (thinner-case HE shell thanks to low barrel pressure, unlike the extremely long high-velocity guns, so it means more HE filler) and you get immense killing power - not only penetrative power.  With the advent of low-weight APDS/APFSDS and chemical rounds like HEAT and HESH you could achieve very high muzzle velocities for the former with relatively low propellant charges thanks to the shell being so light, and you could still get maximum power out of the latter since they didn't need to be extra durable to survive a high-velocity barrel and they also work better with a bit reduced impact velocity."
Warthunder,3e1g92,TouniXVIII,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:58:30 2015 UTC,"Best example of your comment is the HEAT round used in the M551 Sheridan. With an extremely short caliber length, the M409 HEAT round was capable of penetrating 355mm of armor."
Warthunder,3e1g92,Inkompetent,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:17:32 2015 UTC,"That gun also has an insane caliber though. That's where it gets most of its punch. The reason for its small barrel is low weight so that it can be air-lifted, and as such chemical energy shells (HEAT and HE) and the Shillelagh missile were the only reasonable munitions for it.  It even needed the missile since its HEAT shells were so terrible over range and against moving targets due to the awful muzzle velocity. But yeah, the punch in it was good."

Won't have any defensive armament, and the only offensive armament it'd get is the bombs, but c'mon, wouldn't you want to be able to drop a 4,000-pound cookie bomb on some poor sap's face at 500kmh? It'll be like the first Arado, except with more raw derp in the max payload.  Is a bit disappointing about the rockets though. Really do wish that Gaijin had put in the Sherman Tulip instead of the Calliope, with only two of the rockets to spend it'd force the wallet warriors to think a bit more about when to use them.  All that said, I'm still looking forwards to Brit tanks immensely. I wants my 17-pounder guns."

Warthunder,3dytiy,wokeIIy,4,Mon Jul 20 21:01:22 2015 UTC,"That been said the British gun penetration values and velocity tend to be quite above average. Hell a 17 Pounder firing APDS can pen a Maus frontally half a km or so as long as the angle isn't too much on the turret. And i'm pretty sure the 6 Pounder APDS had the highest muzzle velocity of the war with 4,000ft/s (1,220m/s) so long range accuracy and leading should be pretty easy.  With decent rate of fire the British tanks should be able to surgically remove crew at least."

Warthunder,3dytiy,SphinX_AU,6,Mon Jul 20 17:45:10 2015 UTC,"Given how Narwhals, 229s, Ducks, and basically everything else with a large caliber gun handles players, badly."
Warthunder,3dytiy,SphinX_AU,5,Mon Jul 20 17:56:54 2015 UTC,"I agree with you somewhat on this but for some reason the mosquitos 57 seems more reliable then any other large aircraft guns. I've used the me410, hs129 and PBJ derp guns in matches and never had near the success I had with the mosquito. I think because of how maneuverable the mosquito platform is, it's easier to get a better attack angle. That may be why"
Warthunder,3dytiy,EVA_stage,5,Mon Jul 20 18:40:29 2015 UTC,"If the PBJ fired APHE rounds from that 75 it would be overly effective.  The problem is they all fire AP-T or HVAP, great for crew sniping, but trying to hit crew at 300-800kph is hard.  Bombers / ground attackers will always reign supreme in ground battles."
Warthunder,3dytiy,Ossius,-5,Mon Jul 20 18:49:36 2015 UTC,Player vehicles and AI vehicles are radically different in terms of what your guns do to them and hit registration.  You're not going to know what the Brit guns do until you get to shoot players with them.   Judging by the German guns... almost all of them will literally do nothing.

If you grind 10k it would take 22 days. It sounds alot but just enjoy the game and you soon realize youre halfway to Horten.

I learned this the hard way with my stalinbolt, i flew through teir 4, but when I started researching the Beagle, it was like I had flew into a brickwall in terms of RP income. It just wasn't worth using the P-47 to research jets.   If I were you, I would get the the FW-190 D9 and talisman that baby, that aircraft got me through all of teir IV and most of teir V, inluding the BiS.

I am close to unlock the 50mm 262 with Tier II FW190s, but thats more of a coincidence because I have every German plane I want (everything except the narwahl and bombers) so I play just for fun. For researching jets I would absolutly go with a talismaned D9, that is what I used (together with a B6R3) to unlock all jets, from the 162 to the CL13. Imho the 190 line is the best Germany has to offer in this game. Funnily I never liked them and always preferred 109s. It was not until I started playing SB that I found some love for the 190s and now I take them every time I can. 190 A1 / A4 D9/D13 are certainly the best, A5 /U2 (without pods!!!) is pretty good as well.

Warthunder,3dy0h7,ZombieNinjaPanda,12,Mon Jul 20 20:53:25 2015 UTC,"Was discussing this elsewhere; apparently how Gaijin's rendering system works is if from your point of view a tank is mostly hidden the game will not render them at all until they come fully into view.  Now the biggest issue with this is that players blatantly abuse this mechanic by hiding behind rocks, popping out, taking a shot and then going back so you're left searching. Once you determine where the shot is from they only render in the last second, after they've shot you and are retreating. Has caused me to rage quit many times."
Warthunder,3dy0h7,ArturTanreall,8,Mon Jul 20 16:26:35 2015 UTC,"WT rendres tanks only in Line of sight but it can be slow to render sometimes.

Warthunder,3dy0h7,speakingcraniums,0,Mon Jul 20 18:11:54 2015 UTC,Thats just because the binoculars are used from the commander position about a foot or two over the top of the tank.

Warthunder,3dy0h7,Yenraven,8,Mon Jul 20 15:03:59 2015 UTC,"FYI, this isn't for potato pc users.

Warthunder,3e2sxy,Forodrim,2,Tue Jul 21 16:43:28 2015 UTC,If the BR of the first T-34s was upped soon you would have to rise the M4A1's BR because it wouldn't have suitable opponents in 2.3-3.3 bracket.

If killing them were a problem, then I'd say there's some balance issues, but I've not had much trouble keeping T-34's at bay from the front or using the map geography to flank and get side shots. Also, they have really bad gun depression, so attacking them from a lower point while they're above you is a tactic I'd recommend."
Warthunder,3e2sxy,kataskopo,8,Tue Jul 21 15:46:45 2015 UTC,"A well angled T-34 1940 can get an effective thickness on its frontal plate of ≈125 mm., where a StuG, to stay with my earlier example, can only get ≈59 mm.. At the same time the T-34 1940's BR-350SP ammo can at 1500 meters penetrate 54 mm. of armor. That is more than an unangled StuG III F. The German PzGr 40 can at the same range only penetrate 108 mm. of armor. Enough to penetrate an unangled T-34 1940, but as soon as they angle just a bit... The T-34 1940 is BR. 3.3 and the StuG III F is BR. 3.7. If we take a T-34 of the same BR., the T-34 1942, then the StuG will face a tank with the BR-350B (MD-8 fuse) ammo type. That is an APHEBC shell capable of penetrating 68 mm. of armor at 1500 meters. The closest the StuG III F comes to that type of shell is the PzGr. 39, an APCBC capable of penetrating 95 mm. of armor at a range of 1500 meters. That is not enough for a T-34 1942 angled at 40°, which is 110 mm.. Ofcourse we could angle our StuG... At an angle of 40° we have over 110 mm. of frontal armor. The only downside is then, that we wont be able to shoot at the T-34, because our tank-destroyer only has a field of fire that covers 20°. At 20° we have a frontal armor value of 54 mm..

Warthunder,3e2sxy,Dracarna,7,Tue Jul 21 15:35:03 2015 UTC,"The problem is not how to kill them, the problem is that they are just as good as a StuG III F at killing things, have better armor, and better mobility... All in a lower B.R. package."
Warthunder,3e2sxy,Adamulos,4,Tue Jul 21 15:40:04 2015 UTC,"It's easy, just hit their small turret three times before they hit you anywhere !"
Warthunder,3e2sxy,Dracarna,-1,Tue Jul 21 16:08:07 2015 UTC,Because the f1 panzer is br 2.3 as the other person said and is a lot more damaging then the t 34 1940.  and that gets to seal club  br 1.3 and it g has around 5 sec reload.  Yes German tanks are bad at br 3.0 ~ but their br 2.3 is just as good a ussr's 3.3
Warthunder,3e2sxy,Adamulos,3,Tue Jul 21 15:50:24 2015 UTC,"But the shortbarreled 75mm is much worse damagewise after-pen than soviet 76mm, not mentioning heat makes it even worse."

Warthunder,3e2sxy,Adamulos,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:57:39 2015 UTC,"Even on equal terms F1 vs t34, the t34 has an advantage. And there are many more t34s than german competitive tanks at 3,3 or lower"
Warthunder,3e2sxy,letruepatriot,0,Tue Jul 21 17:00:59 2015 UTC,"I will agree with that and yes it is very strong, but  from my point of view id more that most other tanks are rather bad then the t34 being to strong."
Warthunder,3e2sxy,kataskopo,2,Tue Jul 21 17:22:02 2015 UTC,How is this balance if t34 does not need to think about aiming+wins in other categories?
Warthunder,3e2sxy,Archaelas,5,Tue Jul 21 15:40:00 2015 UTC,"Pssssh, it's absoultely balanced!   I only have 90% winrate when i play my t34 because i know how to play. See i'm better than other players, so my 10:1 kill / death ratio with the t34 means nothing regarding the balance of the game. It just means I kick ass ! Noobs mainly play German and US forces, so it's no surprise they lose most of their games.   It's not my problem they don't know where my weakpoints are. I hit their weakpoints all the time, even while driving and due to my superior maneuvering skill I manage to position myself so that I can bounce most of their shots.   If anything T34 needs a buff - after all everybody agrees the t34 was the best tank of world war 2 and it's pretty hard to kill a Königstiger with my 1942.  /s"
Warthunder,3e2sxy,kataskopo,4,Tue Jul 21 15:58:19 2015 UTC,"Duh, the T-34 are not overpowered! You just have to be better at them at everything, hope to get the jump on them, and also target them in a specific place, and only there!  See, they are not OP, duhhh!!"
Warthunder,3e2sxy,Dracarna,0,Tue Jul 21 16:56:54 2015 UTC,"See, now this is the same argument I've seen when other people complain of the Tiger problem for 5.7 Allies.    Tiger drivers consistently told me that I just needed to be accurate with my guns but the problem is, while the Allied vehicles have to be laser accurate and snipe every crew member from the Tiger, the Tiger is able to simply point and make things go boom.    Unfortunately, it's the same thing with the T-34s.  There isn't a whole lot we can do about it beyond complain to Gaijin and hope for change."
Warthunder,3e2sxy,Weeberz,4,Tue Jul 21 19:05:39 2015 UTC,"You have to be the best every time, they just have to be average once.  That grind for the Tiger is long and hard, unlike 4.7 German guns."
Warthunder,3e2sxy,kmacku,2,Tue Jul 21 19:09:29 2015 UTC,The person who spoke about German tanks at br 2.3 had said all a needed to say on the matter  The fact is I felt sad that I could not use my 2.3 line up to farm the kills for the event that we just had says the effectiveness of german tanks over the t 34.  Sorry i was typing while climbing and after having to keeping on having to say the same agreement  that has already been discussed is annoying. Also why the hell is there not this much hate for the tiger which is undamageable from the front apart  from by the kv 2 (which has 40  second reload) by any of the tanks around br 5

Warthunder,3e24o7,SnuwwieRotMG,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:07:37 2015 UTC,"What I did with the germans until I got tanks with good penetration was create a lineup of 2.3 tanks and when I had an attacker available I would put rockets into all the T-34's. They were pretty rare in my games, the most I've seen was 3 on the enemy team.   Honestly, I felt like a seal clubber in the 2.3 BR 75mm derp tanks. With AP shells they can 1-shot most tanks they see and they reload in 4s. You can literally get 3 kills in 8 seconds. I had around a 70% win rate in 30 AB games.  You could avoid them completely with a 2.0 matchup: Pz IV C, Pz IV E, Gepard (outside of 1.3 spread), at least until you get the KwK 39 Pz III's, the Pz IV F2 or the StuG III F and you create a 3.7 matchup. Although it might be less fun than the derp panzers."

Warthunder,3dzayt,Kasshi,3,Tue Jul 21 03:32:43 2015 UTC,"I personally love the Tiger 1P It's a Tiger but a bit more unique, and quite a different playstyle entirely. Angling is less effective due to the shoulders. This can be mitigated by only carrying 30 rounds, as it will completely remove the left side munition.  Find a good position to side scrape, and only expose the empty shoulder. Due to the electric driven engines it has quite good reverse speed, and reverse acceleration.   While standard side scraping is sufficient, the forward position of the turret makes it more difficult, and will always expose your shoulder. I more often than not reverse side scrape, like you would in an IS3 While doing this, you are a road block if you keep that turret hidden during your reloads.  The 88 on the Tiger is plenty for killing any opposition you'll run into. See an IS2? Shoot it in the cupola. See a T-44? Turret cheek. LFP of pattons, and T-34/Shermans any where. APCR really isn't even required unless you feel like you need to disable the IS2's gunner, before going for the killing blow.  Also I feel 6.0 sweet spot for Germany. Panther G/A, Tiger's, JgPnzIV(V) etc. Also due to the popularity of Hellcats, T-34/85s, and IS2s you often won't get uptiered.   If you like Heavy tanks like I do, you'll love the Tiger 1P. She's a big girl, and doesn't feel as nimble as her mass produced sister. When in a defensive position, or being used to break a camp, you can earn some massive RP/Credits though. I don't regrest my purchase, and most players I've seen complain about it, just really have no idea on how to play it."

Warthunder,3dzayt,Stone_CyberStone,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:35:18 2015 UTC,The T-34-100 performs very well. It's essentially an SU-100 with a turret. The recent buff to the 100mm gun bumps up the tank's usability a ton (I have the full ace qualification and before the buff I had 14.9 sec after it's around 11 sec) and it's incredibly mobile.   The armor and fuel tank layout suck so make sure you don't get hit at all or you're dead
Warthunder,3dzayt,Gonna_Rape_You,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:50:30 2015 UTC,"Tiger I P is pretty bad.  The only selling point over the E version is the 204mm frontal armor (not bad, but read below), as well as the fast reverse speed, which is indeed nice.  The frontal shoulders of the hull are 80mm thick, and they make it impossible to angle your hull like a normal Tiger can. This single feature is what makes it a bad tank. It just kills your survivability.  Simply put, this means you have to face enemies head-on. It's ok, your 200mm front will save you, right? No, because turret shots.  The turret front is only 120 like the Tiger H1, so you will get shot in the turret a lot. There goes 3/5 of your crew. So much for 200mm frontal armor.  This tank often sees 6.7 tanks like IS-2 mod 44 and T-44, which will be your nemesis because you can't penetrate them frontally without aiming for their turret weak spots. APCR won't help, because it sucks against sloped armor. Either hit the center of the cheeks or you're dead.  And to top it all off, if the enemy is feeling creative, they can still shoot your cupola, which won't happen because the turret face or hull shoulders are much better targets, but it's just another weak point in the armor.  If you want to grind Tier IV and V tanks, I'd recommend a King Tiger (H) talisman instead. It's cheaper too."

Warthunder,3dv6fk,skippythemoonrock,20,Sun Jul 19 23:35:45 2015 UTC,"It is the most effective way to brake. It's called ""gun braking.""   Also, kicking your rudder side to side is a great way to slow down on the shorter runways. Just don't go too far to either side or you'll snap your gear off.   Oh, and Russian planes can almost always withstand a ""spin out"" to brake ultra fast without ripping the gears or flipping.  You can also abuse the mechanics in the game to brake faster by raising your flaps up once you contact the ground. This while cause you to have more traction, and stop in a shorter distance."

Warthunder,3dv6fk,keller772,5,Mon Jul 20 07:09:24 2015 UTC,The flaps thing works in real life too. It isn't comminly practiced because it's rarely necessary and reduces your chances of pulling off a successful touch and go should you need to climb away in an emergency.

Warthunder,3dv6fk,Reutertu3,4,Mon Jul 20 01:46:02 2015 UTC,Shouldn't have to fire weapons to slow down.   The sad thing is that this is actually more efficient than using the actual brakes.

Warthunder,3dv6fk,Haredeenee,1 point,Mon Jul 20 07:36:25 2015 UTC,"Yeah, metal blades bend and turn to shrapnel.   Wooden blades splinter and act like a shotgun blast"
Warthunder,3dv6fk,JonnyCanWT,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:06:09 2015 UTC,"Emphasis on ""slight chance"". When the prop hits, everything attached to it bends and scrapes. Every ""kerchunk"" you'd hear from a prop strike is about another $5k to the repair bill."
Warthunder,3dv6fk,skippythemoonrock,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:19:39 2015 UTC,"Of course. Usually when you just apply the brakes too much and nick the Tarmac with the tip of the propeller. It just breaks off, and dosnt cause a catastrophic failure."

Warthunder,3dv6fk,Foodstamp001,9,Sun Jul 19 23:36:34 2015 UTC,"Jokes aside, that thing is incredible. I was 100% sure it was a large scale RC and then the guy inside started moving aroud. It's so tiny..."
Warthunder,3dv6fk,Sgt_Stinger,18,Sun Jul 19 22:33:47 2015 UTC,1/2 scale?
Warthunder,3dv6fk,ryebreaded,15,Sun Jul 19 20:31:30 2015 UTC,It's gotta be. That is waaaaaaay too small.
Warthunder,3dv6fk,AugustusSavoy,24,Sun Jul 19 20:38:08 2015 UTC,Way too big to be half scale. Probably 75% size or something like that.
Warthunder,3dv6fk,Marklar_RR,5,Sun Jul 19 20:50:57 2015 UTC,"Might sound ignorant, but wat are the benefits of making a 3/4 scale replica? Why not just make it full scale?"
Warthunder,3dv6fk,pisshorse,13,Mon Jul 20 02:56:50 2015 UTC,Money mainly.  Less materials and you can use a smaller engine to power it.

Warthunder,3dv6fk,skippythemoonrock,-1,Sun Jul 19 23:15:30 2015 UTC,Landing gear is an unnecessary safety feature.
Warthunder,3dv6fk,Alucard15423,3,Mon Jul 20 02:26:57 2015 UTC,Just like a warning for overheating oil.

Warthunder,3dv6fk,AnalBenevolence,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:35:06 2015 UTC,"I still dont get why that Pilot didn't use the emergency gear release.

Warthunder,3dv6fk,Harakou,3,Mon Jul 20 01:48:32 2015 UTC,"That thing is a 3/4th sized replica, which doesn't have nowhere near the weight of an actual warbird and most likely also has a way lower stall speed, resulting in a fairly low speed landing approach.

Warthunder,3e32yc,Argetnyx,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:14:55 2015 UTC,i agree with you but we do have the su152 tanks in game which were designed to destroy bunkers not tanks

While I was slightly disappointed with it's performance, it's a relatively sturdy air frame, carrying over a lot of the durability of the Tempest II.

Warthunder,3dw855,Dunk-Master-Flex,3,Mon Jul 20 02:39:46 2015 UTC,Shot down 3 spits with my 109G-2 and the game ended and this happened. :(

Warthunder,3dw855,Dressedw1ngs,3,Mon Jul 20 16:00:54 2015 UTC,Just got into it now. I think it's up.

Warthunder,3dw855,MochaMike,3,Mon Jul 20 05:21:11 2015 UTC,"Yeah, same. I thought it was me because i'm using Sprint 4G."

Warthunder,3dw855,SandwichSwagger,2,Mon Jul 20 02:17:45 2015 UTC,I had just decided to buy some golden eagles to get a premium account while I'm on vacation. And I can't login.
Warthunder,3dw855,nine_nine_percent,2,Mon Jul 20 02:21:25 2015 UTC,I'm getting error 81110013. Maybe this is telling me to take a break and play something that isn't an exercise in masochism.
Warthunder,3dw855,Peli-kan,2,Mon Jul 20 02:50:06 2015 UTC,"81110013 is the error I'm getting, and according to the warthunder forums, tons more across US and Canada. Russia seems okay. No idea yet what's going on."

Warthunder,3dw855,ImShawnMC,2,Mon Jul 20 03:36:18 2015 UTC,cool Looks like I wasn't the only one.  You guys also getting the error 81110013 with a link to a 2 year old fix involving turning off ssl connection scan if you have kasperski installed?  Edit: looks like everyone is getting this problem and it has happened in the past

Warthunder,3dw855,Notcow,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:38:10 2015 UTC,"I believe they will extend the event given how they've handled similar situations in the past.  However this is Gaijin we're talking about so it wouldn't surprise me if they didn't extend it either.  Wether or not you've spent money on the game, people expect it to work.  If there was some kind of planned outage/maintenance, they should let the user base know.  I've currently stopped spending money on the game, but I have dropped cash on premium several times."

Warthunder,3dw855,DuManchu,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:19:45 2015 UTC,"Well, some of us have spent money on this game and are having the same issue. Not to mention the free advertizing that we do by recommending the game to everyone else (gotta get muh 50 ge)."
Warthunder,3dw855,kotegawa,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:37:00 2015 UTC,"Yes, that one hour with daylight savings time is an important one (and tricky to code software to handle properly.)"
Warthunder,3dw855,veritropism,2,Mon Jul 20 05:06:44 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately I think this may be do to some script kiddie getting butt-hurt over his inability to acquire the D.521. There has been a rash of DDOS attacks against key servers in various prolific online multiplayer games recently and I suppose warthunder's authentication servers are now added to that list, just kids out of school i guess."
Warthunder,3dw855,Marc_spector,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:23:43 2015 UTC,"Was thinking same thing , hence why no real official word from the team. all iv got back from them is the authentication server is at fault. if it is a ddos thing..  its probably a bit more advanced then that being that security against such things would be installed other wise the only thing hacking & modding i would think is serendipity and they now are trying to fix./ this could take 72 hours..   but i assure you they would be working around the clock to negate this."

Warthunder,3dw855,RaumVogel,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:17:55 2015 UTC,I was getting in but then kicked out after the last few games and don't think it credited my scores. Now I can't get in at all.

Warthunder,3dw855,ScrubSandwich,4,Mon Jul 20 01:51:58 2015 UTC,Is it working for anyone else? I still can't login.
Warthunder,3dw855,Stinkis,2,Mon Jul 20 01:54:49 2015 UTC,Just checked and it is down for me. I wanted to grind some more for my Mig-9. :(

Warthunder,3dw855,RaumVogel,-12,Mon Jul 20 02:25:39 2015 UTC,what is wrong with you all bitching like this... SERVERS go down things happen THE GAME IS FREE TO PLAY... 5 years ago or more we never seen free to play good games like this.. these guys are doing there best to keep it up and keep things going. Yeah i hate this shit when it happens and want them to hurry the fuck up too.. but realy guys come on give them a chance to finsd whats wrong and deal with it
Warthunder,3dwfa2,SixshooteR32,42,Mon Jul 20 02:30:11 2015 UTC,My account was registered with an ISP email I no longer had access to. I made a support ticket explaining this and they allowed me to change the email on my account. They will need quite a lot of information from you to prove that you own the account but it was worth it.
Warthunder,3dwfa2,SoccerSpartan,14,Mon Jul 20 03:02:48 2015 UTC,Thank god there is hope.. I have 500 hours in so I definitely don't want to lose anything
Warthunder,3dwfa2,GnarleyGoat,8,Mon Jul 20 03:09:55 2015 UTC,"Unless the policy has changed, I think they can get it back. You have to provide passwords and proof that you own the email that you are changing to as well as proving you own the WarThunder account by telling them about your level/progression/planes unlocked. Takes a few day after submitting a ticket."
Warthunder,3dwfa2,uzzzer,2,Mon Jul 20 03:33:19 2015 UTC,"yeah i also had a problem with my email and i had to go through great lengths of explanation with screenshots, or telling them the most random things such as what level i was and my avatar. Eventually they let me change the email. Overall, I find Gaijins customer service to actually be really good at getting the job done."
Warthunder,3dwfa2,GnarleyGoat,2,Mon Jul 20 03:14:35 2015 UTC,"Came here to say this. They changed my email for me as well. Took 2-3 days after submitting a ticket but they were really cool about it. As well, they transferred some Golden Eagles I purchased between accounts."
Warthunder,3dwfa2,Pjup,14,Mon Jul 20 03:31:17 2015 UTC,"The sentences ""We do not provide e-mail change"" and ""We are serious about the security of our players' accounts"" don't work well together."
Warthunder,3dwfa2,Finear,-10,Mon Jul 20 03:23:18 2015 UTC,actually they do
Warthunder,3dwfa2,TheShadyPlayer,10,Mon Jul 20 08:36:56 2015 UTC,"Actually they don't, if your email is compromised you can't change it to secure, new email."
Warthunder,3dwfa2,Lee1138,1 point,Mon Jul 20 10:00:07 2015 UTC,"It goes both ways, it also means someone who ""hacked"" their WT password can't immediately change the attached email account and lock the owner out of it that way."
Warthunder,3dwfa2,TheShadyPlayer,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:16:54 2015 UTC,"It doesn't go both ways. You have to provide evidence that you're owner of the email/account to change it, merely knowing account password isn't enough. This literally applies to every single ticket based support service regardless of the game. A lot of times it's enough to be able to access the email, though, but if both of your account and email get compromised at the same time you fucked up somewhere yourself."
Warthunder,3dwfa2,Finear,-5,Mon Jul 20 16:58:04 2015 UTC,obviously lol because that would require access to your compromised email
Warthunder,3dwfa2,vidal66,3,Mon Jul 20 10:08:55 2015 UTC,This is the same system Wargaming has. I am pretty sure you can change it if you open a support ticket and give them enough information to prove its actually you.
Warthunder,3dwfa2,WankingWarrior,2,Mon Jul 20 07:32:00 2015 UTC,"kamrade, dah best security is gulag security"
Warthunder,3dwfa2,Redlyr,2,Mon Jul 20 02:59:12 2015 UTC,I am absolutely ruined. So much time and money invested.
