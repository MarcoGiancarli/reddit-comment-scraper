Because there is no TBS in my country and some other channel bought the rights to broadcast the show in my country.

gif,3di3zp,twas_now,30,Fri Jul 17 01:13:48 2015 UTC,Just have a separate hard drive or partition for it. Then turn that drive or partition on when you want it and off when you're done. Can't find it if Windows doesn't even acknowledge its existence. I doubt anyone will go into the device manager to check if any hard drives or partitions are deactivated.
gif,3di3zp,Jurdonidas,20,Thu Jul 16 15:59:09 2015 UTC,You don't need to turn it off or on. A better solution is to encrypt the drive and use a password to unlock it.

gif,3d69q5,drbatookhanxx,15,Mon Jul 13 21:18:10 2015 UTC,I've had a few pets go into the great beyond.   I didn't immediately go out and get another one.  There was a grieving process.  I know everybody deals in their own way but I personally needed some time to reflect on how great my little buddy was and how much he meant to me.    I would feel like I'm disrespecting his legacy or memory or idk if I just picked up another puppy the next day.  Just my personal opinion.  Not criticising these people.

Her dog died suddenly in a traffic accident after 8 years of companionship.  She had no emotional energy to invest into a new, untrained puppy.  I've had my dog for four years now, and she is my doggy soul mate.  It would take me a good long time after she passes to transition to another animal."

I remember seeing a dog competition where they jump into a pool in response to the handler throwing a toy or buoy thing. A good/bad throw affects the jump as much as the dog's skill because they're trying to retrieve the doohickey and will go as far as they can to reach it.

Then tilt the bar to the other side and the weights slide off that side.

gif,3cyn4f,irrational_abbztract,1 point,Sun Jul 12 03:51:22 2015 UTC,$600. It's called Maxx Bench and its on kickstarter.
gif,3cyn4f,rush2547,2,Sun Jul 12 07:04:11 2015 UTC,Saw this in another subreddit. On mobile so I cant give credit where its due but one of the top comments was how trying to find the pedal while lifting could throw off your balance and tear your pecs and rotator cuffs.
gif,3cyn4f,JohnBovril,2,Sun Jul 12 05:05:01 2015 UTC,/u/InterstellarGlue in this thread suggested it should be a fail safe cord that straps to your leg. I'm seeing it as a velcro strap - his suggestion was there to stop you having to look for the pedal while a heavy weight crushes your neck.
gif,3cyn4f,RedditEarth,2,Sun Jul 12 10:25:39 2015 UTC,"While it does look pretty cool, I'd be curious to see specs on this contraption. How much weight can it support? How sturdy is it to prevent shaking? Over time does hitting the switch just drop you down  instead of gently lowering?"
gif,3cyn4f,galapenojam,2,Sun Jul 12 13:10:46 2015 UTC,What about a gif that shows the bench instead of a close up of the dudes face while he's pushing eh?
gif,3cyn4f,alphaj1,2,Sun Jul 12 17:23:30 2015 UTC,"At lighter weights,  these are ok. But, I've seen gym contraptions fail before. Having upwards of 200lbs falling on you won't be fun. Despite the safety guard, you can still hurt yourself.   At the gym the other day,  one of the incline benches gave way. From an incline,  it failed back to flat while someone was doing French presses."
gif,3cyn4f,elsparkodiablo,10,Sun Jul 12 05:22:13 2015 UTC,"From an incline,  it failed back to flat while someone was doing French presses.   Well there's the problem, people shouldn't be brewing coffee while lifting"
gif,3cyn4f,alphaj1,-2,Sun Jul 12 05:38:16 2015 UTC,lol not sure if you're  jk but a french press is a tricep exercise  Edit: downvotes for explaining an exercise? lol ok  https://youtu.be/snsxB1ervSU
gif,3cyn4f,ErrorX,2,Sun Jul 12 05:54:19 2015 UTC,"Man, those are skull crushers. Don't make them sound so gay."
gif,3cyn4f,alphaj1,2,Sun Jul 12 10:31:21 2015 UTC,similar but not quite the same. Skull crushers are done with the weight lowered to your face.  The French press has the weight go behind the head
gif,3cyn4f,ErrorX,1 point,Sun Jul 12 14:17:27 2015 UTC,Interesting. TIL.
gif,3cyn4f,CaptainRene,1 point,Sun Jul 12 23:07:40 2015 UTC,"My 20‚Ç¨ jackstand hasn't failed and dropped my car yet, despite it having a TuKes rating of ""so you want to kill yourself?"", so I think that with proper hydraulic parts this isn't going to fail either.  Altough, back in school someone made a regular bench for lifting weights, I was talking shit to my mates while leaning on it and one of the welds gave out, and I'm not even a fatty, it was just a shitty weld. I was like ""shit, sorry 'bout that"" to my teacher and he was like ""don't be, had that shit broken while someone was lifting weights, we'd be fucked""."
gif,3cyn4f,carlsaischa,1 point,Sun Jul 12 12:52:51 2015 UTC,"Just use safety bars and proper form, if you fail your set just un-arch your back and your chest goes down enough for you to put the barbell on the bars."
gif,3cyn4f,Jimmbo6,1 point,Sun Jul 12 10:48:12 2015 UTC,Come on. Just push it forward and let it settle on your thighs. Then you can stand right up and turnaround and but it back up.

gif,3cyn4f,DeadEndStreets,-6,Sun Jul 12 06:25:23 2015 UTC,If you fail on bench you should be forced to preform the roll of shame.
gif,3cyn4f,theflyingdog,2,Sun Jul 12 05:02:44 2015 UTC,yeah unless you drop it on your neck and die or something
gif,3cyn4f,DeadEndStreets,-1,Sun Jul 12 05:06:09 2015 UTC,Benching over your neck would be terribly improper form. Plus this wouldn't save you from dropping it seeing as you have to hit the foot control for it to lower.
gif,3cyn4f,GigaJuice,-26,Sun Jul 12 05:12:42 2015 UTC,"I don't see the point in this. If he already has the weight up, cant he just rack it normally? If the bench was lowered before he started lifting to make it impossible for the weight to crush his jugular, then it would make sense."
gif,3cyn4f,dergs,9,Sun Jul 12 00:51:37 2015 UTC,The point is you can try for that extra rep without a spotter. if you get stuck you won't end up with the weight on your chest.
gif,3cyn4f,Smockron,4,Sun Jul 12 01:47:04 2015 UTC,"Its a fantastic idea, I have had to roll the bar to my waist a few times.  *I never lift anything that is really heavy or too much for me, just fatigue"

gif,3cyn4f,shitterplug,-6,Sun Jul 12 01:58:27 2015 UTC,"Maybe you should start lifting, bruh. Instead of judging others."
gif,3cyn4f,Smoogies,-6,Sun Jul 12 02:06:47 2015 UTC,"Look at his grip, people in /r/bodybuilding doubted me...  thumb behind the bar is a more effective work out children, you're not going to DIE from the 'death grip' or w/e you may call it.  Great invention btw"
