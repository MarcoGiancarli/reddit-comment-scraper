Naruto,3e2fks,Gek_Lhar,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:22:18 2015 UTC,That doesn't mean they didn't recycle some or all the sprites from one game to another.  I wasn't talking chronological I was just saying they could be the same sprites. So maybe they originated in one game but they are in both so neither is wrong since same sprites.

Naruto,3dxccb,shivu22,8,Mon Jul 20 15:04:44 2015 UTC,"I talked about this in another comment on this thread so ill only touch on it. So I think its more of an age/mastery thing have quality vs quantity type thing. Looking at the age groups we see, we see more young and less old from leaf while we see more old and less young from other villages.  But looking at the stronger ninjas them seem to have a more focused less varied jutsu repertoire to the point its hard to call some of their jutsus diffrent."
Naruto,3dxccb,randomdrifter54,15,Mon Jul 20 17:00:23 2015 UTC,Not including Talk no Jutsu of course!
Naruto,3dxccb,EndoplasmicPanda,25,Mon Jul 20 21:32:39 2015 UTC,"4 ish. He has mastered:shadow clone, transformation,  summoning and rasengan. He also can use 2 diffrent power up techniques which in themselves are not jutsus. He also can use most of the basic shinobi stuff: taijutsu, substitution and such. thus the ish. Sasuke is simular aswell. He has the sharingan techniques, chidori, and fireball. Thats more than naruto but still counable on two hands. Look at shikumaru as he is the most advanced of his generation only really uses 3 jutsu.    Its probably an age/mastery thing. It seems there is more of a focus on quality than quantity.  Thus they get more jutsus slowly but they are stronger.also alot of jutsus seem to expand previous jutsus which further supports my statement.  The other thing that supports my statement is most jutsu a person knows are interrelated, naruto is an outlier on this, which is definitely a mastery thing. Yes the two statements are circular."

Naruto,3dxccb,IamNR,4,Mon Jul 20 17:35:32 2015 UTC,"Well I used to be of the mind set of how it was awesome a suckass ninja like naruto could become such a badass. Then I realized a couple of things. One was that most ninjas had very focused ninjutsus and the ones that didn't weren't very good, iruka the forever chunin being the example. And the older a person is the more jutsus they seem to poses jiraya and the third hokage are the best examples there. They kinda just clicked as I was writing it out. Shikumaru kinda help exmplify what i was talking about, he was the first chunin and jonin and only had 1 and 3? jutsu respectively at those times. Naruto had a problem with the basics but once he got shadow clone he fit in with his graduation group so he wasn't very unusual at all except the demon fox part."

While Minato was just so exceptionally good at flying ryjin that it made him almost impossible to take on. If it came up to straight fighting prowess i would have to say minato is a bit better.  Though the first hokage was way more powerful due to the sheer scale of destruction he could cause, but there were very few people alive who could remember seeing him fight by Minato's time. So it's not unreasonable to the younger generation to think he was the strongest.  but the actual answer to your question is simply that Kishi didn't plan that far ahead."
Naruto,3e3gat,Omega_Warrior,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:06:37 2015 UTC,Oh ok I see and I do like Minato but seeing in one episode (not going to spoil) tobirama and hashirama show their power off abit so I thought they were stronger

Naruto,3e3gat,Lucky1g,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:30:29 2015 UTC,I agree with this
Naruto,3e3gat,swarbles,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:23:31 2015 UTC,"2 things:   Why do you think the 2nd has more chakra?? Minato's chakra was massive. His personal body guards needed 3 people just to perform the flying Raijin once. He flew all over the place all the time and was able to use space/time ninjutsu to transport shit like Bijuudamas MILES away. This takes insane chakra. In actual combat, Minato is pretty unstoppable. He might not cause the destruction that hashirama did, but he was more or less impossible to hit and had his way with pretty much everyone. Hashi is def stronger overall, but Minato's unique style of combat was very well adapted to his skills.   I think Kishi way fucked up the power levels of Hashi and Madara. Just seems completely unreasonable how strong they are compared to all other shinobi when there is no evidence or reasoning to explain why they are so much freaking stronger. It's kind of dumb."

He isn't that is probably a writing error on Kishimoto's part. I don't think Kishi knew how strong he was going to make Hashirama.   I never got why Minato was seen as the strongest when Hashirama and Tobirama are clearly stronger   Hashirama is clearly stronger, but Tobirama is not."

I mean the fighting spirit themes to get your blood pumping when a fight is turned around. The emotion in the sad songs that makes you cry and connect with the characters. Hell even the funny themes to lighten the mood.  Sadness and sorrow"

Naruto,3e0jzk,FedoraTipper15,2,Tue Jul 21 19:26:08 2015 UTC,Naruto has such a good soundtrack throughout the whole anime. Period.
Naruto,3e2npj,TLCplLogan,8,Tue Jul 21 14:16:27 2015 UTC,"Well, it was a Shinobi World War. Just like in our world, i'm sure the shinobi have some sort of drafting system in dire cases like a world war."
Naruto,3e2npj,papa_smurphy,2,Tue Jul 21 14:19:40 2015 UTC,"Maybe, but I don't think that would be the case. Having basically untrained people fighting in a shinobi war would be more of a hindrance than a benefit, if you ask me."
Naruto,3e2npj,papa_smurphy,6,Tue Jul 21 14:25:07 2015 UTC,"There was time between when Tobi declared the war and the war actually began, enough time to give new recruits basic training. They just need enough training to fight the Zetsu clones, while they leave the reanimations to the more experienced shinobi."
Naruto,3e2npj,night4345,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:42:37 2015 UTC,"Good point. Could be a possibility, I suppose."
Naruto,3e2npj,DasKatze500,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:44:48 2015 UTC,Didn't all Genin stay at their villages to keep some order and because they'd basically be useless in the War?
Naruto,3e2npj,Rokksolidrees,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:33:56 2015 UTC,"It seems that way. Team Ebisu stayed in the village, at least."
Naruto,3e2npj,DasKatze500,4,Tue Jul 21 18:57:18 2015 UTC,"Change that to an A-rank mission. I remember either Kakashi or the Third saying in one of the early episodes that you're only likely to fight other ninja on an A-rank mission. Chunins do A-B ranks as well once they've passed, so a higher ranked mission in the exams would make sense."
Naruto,3e2npj,IdRatherBeLurking,2,Tue Jul 21 14:36:38 2015 UTC,Iust an FYI in the land of waves arc Kakashi said that ninja confrontation would warrant at least B- rank.
Naruto,3e2npj,ImAnAppleBiteMe,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:33:54 2015 UTC,"I was thinking B-rank might be better, but A-rank seems a little too high. Those are usually reserved for jonin and/or chunin in high standing. We are talking about genin, after all. Even with help from their team leader, A-rank might be a little too difficult. They're trying to prove that they're worthy of becoming chunin, not necessarily that they're worthy of being the best chunin."
Naruto,3e2npj,IdRatherBeLurking,2,Tue Jul 21 14:39:17 2015 UTC,Yeah that's fair enough. B rank seems most suitable then.
Naruto,3e2npj,ImAnAppleBiteMe,2,Tue Jul 21 14:45:59 2015 UTC,"My problem with this is that when we get to the Shinobi World War Arc, there are literally thousands of chunin from every nation participating in the war.    In just that year, 153 shinobi participated in the Chuunin Exams  (Chapter 39, page 10).    but it's implied that there are never more than a handful of graduates from any one set of exams.   Nothing implies this, and in fact the opposite is implied, as just like you stated, thousands of chunin from every nation participated in the war. That implies that thousands of genin are made chunin every year across the hidden village system.  And regarding how people are made chuunin, while not winning the finals...   Although the tournament is designed for there to be an ultimate ""winner"", success does not guarantee promotion nor does failure preclude it; if the observing ninja and daimyō feel a genin displays the necessary qualities for a chūnin, that genin will be promoted regardless of how they place in the tournament. For this reason it is possible for as many as all of the finalists to pass, or even for none of them to. Therefore, the important point of this exam is for the examinees to show their aptitude in the field, and would have more opportunity if they advance to the next round.   So I think you're just fundamentally misunderstanding the purpose of the exams: They're not meant to weed out the children until only one is crowned a chunin, but rather as a model to assess the talents of the respective village's genin.  The incompetency you speak of is basically comedic relief in the show, and not meant to be taken seriously. Sure, in a real world scenario Ibisu would never be made a Jonin, but where's the fun in that?"
Naruto,3e2npj,IdRatherBeLurking,4,Tue Jul 21 15:15:14 2015 UTC,"Well to be fair it is implied that very few people pass. After the conclusion of the forest of death portion, they held a mini  tournament for the sole purpose of having less people go to the finals. And there were only what.. 21 of them?"
Naruto,3e2npj,ImAnAppleBiteMe,-1,Tue Jul 21 15:37:55 2015 UTC,"Again, that's for the tournament, which itself is not what makes a chuunin.   The fact that thousands of shinobi are chuunin by the World War implies that thousands pass, which lines up with everything I've said. If there were only a handful of chuunin, then it would be implied that not many passed."
Naruto,3e2npj,IdRatherBeLurking,3,Tue Jul 21 15:48:47 2015 UTC,"... But no one ever said you could pass if you don't make it to the  tournament in canon. The idea you presented is that all the Finalists could essentially pass. Thus you have to be a finalist which requires making it to the final round of the the chunnin exams, which is the tournament. Once at the tournament level everyone is in arms reach of the chuunin title but before that point you aren't.  At least that's how the people I know saw it."
Naruto,3e2npj,swarbles,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:59:07 2015 UTC,"But no one ever said you could pass if you don't make it to the tournament    Yet, we have tons of shinobi as chunin after the two year skip. How is this reconciled, if only the winners are made chunin?"
Naruto,3e2npj,IdRatherBeLurking,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:21:33 2015 UTC,"Well it is Naruto we are talking about; no stranger to holes in the sub plot details.  As someone said earlier it could have been a desperation draft. Another option is that the chuunin exams were changed in the time skip. However, The joint chuunin exams as a substitute for war sees less shinobi become chuunin by rules of the exam. My last idea is that the war is made up of ""irukas"". Those who have taken the exam many years ago some even when the exams were done individually by village but never made it to jounin. Some may have even retired like the guy jiraiya first used the rasengan on. This last option allows for there to be 100s of chuunin per village that suddenly appear out of no where. They didn't just get promoted, they were always there.  I believe it is either option 2 or 3. But the rules you originally presented based on the chuunin exams that we know imply that the joint chuunin exams are hard and that few people pass."
Naruto,3e2npj,swarbles,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:50:19 2015 UTC,"Well it is Naruto we are talking about; no stranger to holes in the sub plot details.    I would disagree with that statement.   We have no way of knowing whether it was standard or not to draft that many chuunins, only that this was the case. Whether through winning the tournament or not, damn near all of the Konoha 11 were made chuunin. This was done before the war, so it's safe for us to assume that while they all did not win the tournament over the 2 year time skip, they all were made chuunin. So, deduction allows us to make this assumption, but it is not explicitly stated either way in the manga."
Naruto,3e2npj,ImAnAppleBiteMe,2,Tue Jul 21 16:55:53 2015 UTC,"So, over 2.5 years, the time in which Naruto would have been gone, there was somewhere in the realm of 5 exams, depending on how often they are held.  This means that 2 Konoha Genin were made into Chuunin each exam during that time (as Naruto is part of the Konoha 11, that means 10 became Chunin).  This is not an extreme number. Given that (a) the first exam was interrupted by an invasion, and (b) the instability in the world following the invasion as well as the military losses Konoha suffered, it would make sense that they would make an effort to promote soldiers more quickly in order to bolster their military strength (i.e., the reason Kakashi became a Jounin at 12).  I think it's a bad assumption that everyone involved in the ninja war was Chuunin+. I think it's likely that many of them were Genin, or Chunin by experience only.  It's hard to argue that this isn't a plot hole in Naruto. Given that there are ANBU members who are taken out by next to nothing (and who fucking throw Kunai uselessly instead of using the supposed 2+ chakra elements they control), it's easy to poke holes here. Naruto is extremely solid when it comes to this type of thing but they had to create fodder somehow, Kishi just didn't do it in a way that made all that much sense."
Naruto,3e2npj,Dusk_Soldier,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:57:32 2015 UTC,"I don't see any reason to assume there are more than 1 a year. That's also not including all of the Konoha chunin/jonin in the war.  It's fine to theorycraft, but we can only go off of what we have seen in the canon storyline.  So no, its not hard to argue against this bring a ploy hole, just like many of the other ""plot hole"" theories."
Naruto,3e2npj,IdRatherBeLurking,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:03:41 2015 UTC,"I believe it says in the manga that it generally happens twice a year. At work and don't have time to go back and check but I just finished rereading the whole series so it's fairly fresh in my mind.  The problem is, you are taking evidence from part 2 and applying it to logic of part 1, even though there are statements in part 1 that contradict what you are garnering from part 2."
Naruto,3e2npj,swarbles,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:08:08 2015 UTC,"So what are you saying is that ""just because it wasn't properly explained doesn't mean that it can't be properly explained"". Am i getting that right?  If so that's all fine and I agree because I see a lot of ""blah blah plot holes"" that can be solved with logic. However, In this instance what we know is that the canon chuunin exam forcibly limited the number of possible graduates. What happened in the 2.5 years is anybody's guess. But calling it a plot hole according to your logic is unfair or just wrong."
Naruto,3e2npj,IdRatherBeLurking,2,Tue Jul 21 18:30:15 2015 UTC,"Nothing implies this, and in fact the opposite is implied, as just like you stated, thousands of chunin from every nation participated in the war. That implies that thousands of genin are made chunin every year across the hidden village system.    The comments from the instructors throughout the exam are what imply only a handful make it through. Most notably when they declared that 21 participants was too many for the final round, and hold a preliminary tournament to cut the field in half."
Naruto,3e2npj,swarbles,0,Tue Jul 21 15:31:54 2015 UTC,"Correct, that's for the tournament, which does not determine the number of chunin that are made."
Naruto,3e2npj,IdRatherBeLurking,2,Tue Jul 21 15:34:52 2015 UTC,"Correct me if I'm wrong, but Kages don't attend the preliminary rounds, which are essentially to weed out those that are unworthy.  You can argue if you want, but it is heavily implied that Chuunin are selected from those who make it to the final round. Theoretically it would be possible to become a Chuunin without making it to the final round, but if that were the case, and the standards were that much lower, we would have seen other shinobi become Chuunin during that exam.  Your points are contradictory ."
Naruto,3e2npj,swarbles,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:50:18 2015 UTC,"There are numerous chuunin who made it outside of the final round, which denotes that making it there is not the sole requirement."
Naruto,3e2npj,IdRatherBeLurking,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:01:08 2015 UTC,"Examples? If you are referring to those who lost in the prelims during the canon chuunin exam, none of them were made Chunin during that exam. the only Konoha chuunin promoted from the canon exam in Part 1 is Shikamaru."
Naruto,3e2npj,swarbles,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:06:30 2015 UTC,"If only one shinobi is graduated per exam (the winner), then how can we account for 10 of them being chuunin in 2 years?"
Naruto,3e2npj,BelieveInThePeeko,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:20:11 2015 UTC,"It's not that only 1 shinobi (winner) is graduated per exam, it's that you must make it to the final round (be in the top 10-ish) to be considered for Chuunin. Which makes sense, because they are supposed to be squad leaders."
Naruto,3e2npj,Danbito,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:23:46 2015 UTC,"They are supposed to be able to lead squads, but that's clearly not their main purpose. Why have 3 chuunin in one squad then?"
Naruto,3e2npj,jl1995,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:25:21 2015 UTC,because plot holes. lol. but mostly because the shinobi we follow are generally exceptional and participate in the highest level of missions therefore requiring a team of 1 jonin and 3 chuunin rather than 1 chuunin and 3 genin.

I think NaruHina is a better representation of Minato and Kushina's relationship because while Hinata is calm and reserved like Minato (at least that's my interpretation of him) Naruto is more emotionally abrasive like his mother. Also, Kushina and Hinata both play a better mother/non-shinobi role than Sakura does. I can't imagine Sakura sitting out on medical conferences or skipping over the medical helm after Tsunade has stepped down as a teacher. She would want to educate while Hinata would do as we see in ch.700, being the perfect ideal of a mother."

Naruto,3e09ac,4Khazmodan,18,Tue Jul 21 01:58:10 2015 UTC,"Honestly, during the filler eps in between part 1 and 2. Naruto and Hinata went on a lot of missions together. One episode in particular served as Hinata's blooming episode. In the episode, they were searching for a bug that could use Sasuke's scent to track him. They ran into a wasp-user, and Hinata showed how badass she was and took care of them when neither Naruto nor Kiba could. Also in that episode, Naruto saw a silhouette of Hinata bathing and told Kiba he saw a beautiful girl. There were several more eps where they went on missions and various moments between them. I know none of them are canon, but I liked seeing them together."
Naruto,3e09ac,xgenoriginal,4,Mon Jul 20 23:49:21 2015 UTC,Those were quite cute.
Naruto,3e09ac,coldvikinglyrics,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:50:04 2015 UTC,and then naruto farted on the bug and it was all for nothing
Naruto,3e09ac,nikolai393,13,Tue Jul 21 03:44:26 2015 UTC,"I kinda secretly wanted for Naruto and Hinata end up together and after The Last movie I just worshipped them lol. Hinata reminds me of myself, that's probably why"
Naruto,3e09ac,PakiIronman,7,Tue Jul 21 00:22:10 2015 UTC,"I became a NaruHina fan mainly because I felt like I could relate to Hinata a lot. I was pretty quiet and reserved and it would've taken some planetary devastation to admit my feelings to someone. In that way, I always rooted for her to get her feelings out there. I also took some inspiration from when she finally did."
Naruto,3e09ac,alloev,13,Tue Jul 21 01:59:58 2015 UTC,"Haha ok so funny story, when my friends told me to watch Naruto back in middle school I hated the first episode. I didn't like Naruto and I didn't like everyone else because they were dicks to him. But then Hinata was introduced and I saw a student who actually liked him. I remember talking about that first episode with my mates saying;   ""Naruto is shit, everyone is annoying. Except that girl with blue hair, she's cool"".   So I basically shipped them from the first episode."
Naruto,3e09ac,ShanklinX,9,Tue Jul 21 01:26:15 2015 UTC,"This is going to sound really basic, but I always like the main canon couples because that's like a factor in how much I'll like a series (not that it's the sole factor.) Also, Sasuke and Sakura are both really great characters on their own imo, so it's no surprise I like them together, too.   Aaaand I always go for the same type of favorite characters and pairings...my other OTPs are Zuko and Mai from ATLA and Chuck and Blair from Gossip Girl and fml they're like reincarnations of the same stupid pairing archetype. Stereotypical angsty bad boys dynamic ftw lmao I hate my life. Oh, also, Tifa and Cloud from FF7 even though that's questionably canon. I used to love that pairing way back in the day.  So I was a fan since Sakura first declared she was gonna get the duckbutt in season 1. No regrets. I do appreciate the other main rival pairings and stuff as well, though, it's not like I hate any of the other pairings."
Naruto,3e09ac,alloev,3,Tue Jul 21 00:52:35 2015 UTC,"I still ship CloTi! I know it was never like, solidified but I don't see why they wouldn't hook up after the game events or around Advent Children. I mean they're living together and have already adopted kids. I wonder if they'll officially make it canon with the remake."
Naruto,3e09ac,BitchImaKillYou,2,Tue Jul 21 03:55:35 2015 UTC,Yessss I'm so hyped for that remake!
Naruto,3e09ac,thisonethingnaruto,9,Tue Jul 21 05:13:07 2015 UTC,"Believe it or not, it was initially because of colors.   I HATED how Yellow and Pink looked next to each other. It was so unpleasant. Yellow/Orange and purple are complementary colors I believe and it just looked good.   Then I actually started to like NaruHina cuz I think the whole opposites attract stereotype is pretty cool.   SasuSaku sort of the same. They look cool together and light color+dark color looks good."
Naruto,3e09ac,gaarassandcastle,5,Tue Jul 21 01:25:29 2015 UTC,Hahaha reminded me of this
Naruto,3e09ac,lenne18,4,Tue Jul 21 02:29:44 2015 UTC,"I started to ship NaruHina when Naruto cheered Hinata on when she fought against Neji. I used to absolutely HATE SasuSaku and then one day, I suddenly realized I was wrong and it was a pretty sweet ship. Never shipped NaruSaku and I still don't. I do ship NaruSasu though ;). In all seriousness though, I became a fan of those couples because they're just really, REALLY cute and lovely in my opinion."
Naruto,3e09ac,marquis2395,10,Tue Jul 21 01:57:47 2015 UTC,Never been a fan of SasuSaku.    NaruHina... it's the pep talk before the fight with Neji during the Chunin Exams.
Naruto,3e09ac,Ootsutsuki,6,Tue Jul 21 00:24:08 2015 UTC,"SasuSaku fan, Forest of Death was what got me on this ship.  It was torturous, but they finally made it."
Naruto,3e09ac,panda58,3,Tue Jul 21 03:37:56 2015 UTC,"I shipped Sasu/Saku from the beginning when I saw Sakura's love for Sasuke.  To me it didn't just seem like a crush, she had a situation of she couldn't help who she fell in love with. Usually those types of situations end badly, so I wanted for those two to get together more than anything.  I was so happy when they did, they turned out to be such a loving- and I mean a really loving couple/family."
Naruto,3e09ac,rkellyturbo,3,Tue Jul 21 05:14:37 2015 UTC,"I just wanted the characters to end up happy, and those pairings allow them all to be happy together.  And now a moment of silence for poor Neji."
Naruto,3e09ac,erockarmy1,3,Tue Jul 21 05:30:51 2015 UTC,"I wanted Naruto/Sakura for the longest time because he actually showed interest in her. But sometime towards the end of the manga, around the time Team 7 were reunited on the same side, I accepted Sakura would always love only Sasuke so I was sold on what became the final pairings. I thought The Last did a perfect job explaining the true nature of Naruto's initial feelings for Sakura."
Naruto,3e09ac,TheJDUBS2,5,Tue Jul 21 08:20:09 2015 UTC,I liked the side ships like ShikaTema or NejiTen. Never cared for the mains.

Naruto,3e09ac,ruthmi88,2,Tue Jul 21 06:26:24 2015 UTC,"I was a fan of Naruto and Hinata individually pretty early on, but I didn't start relating them as a couple until Hinata's confession. I just didn't really care. I don't really have a reason why, they just seemed to fit well together, exact opposites but very much the same as well.  Now, if I'm going to read a fan fiction it has to be Naru/Hina centric. I could give fewer damns about every other pairing though, they aren't important."
Naruto,3e09ac,cxoxp,2,Tue Jul 21 01:52:17 2015 UTC,I automatically gravitated to NH because I like the whole one girl who always believed in the unpopular underdog when no one else did scheme. Granted I almost didn't ship it because I thought a little messed up that Hinata always watched Naruto from the distance but never approached during the early years (I'm guessing she tried though) but I kinda blame the anime for adding in these filler-only scenes during Naruto's fight with Kiba.  My FAVE NH moments is when Hinata took up Naruto's nindo and kept getting up to fight Neji even though she was beat beyond her limits and ofc THE PROUD FAILURE SPEECH :*  Shikatema imo is probably the best ship of the entire show simply because it was pretty balanced on both end pretty early. And I think the chemistry between during their chuunin fight was pretty hawt. And tbh I wish that all the pairings would've been done like this. No guessing games or beating around the bush as to will end with who. Just straightforward these are your future pairings.  Sasusaku I thought I'd like but I didn't and really still don't. Had the development to it been done differently then maybe I would've been okay with it.
Naruto,3e09ac,tht1guy52,2,Tue Jul 21 02:17:18 2015 UTC,"I actually started watching naruto a bit late. I did however remember an anime fight that caught my attention a couple of years before, it was hinata vs neji. About 2 years ago after looking up so much anime on YouTube a video suggestion came up that said ""hinata's death"". It was her fight against pain. Then i thought it sounded familiar so i watched it and really liked the animation so the more i watched the more i liked naruto. I then started from the beginning and loved naruto even more while i also saw the progress that led to the point of hinata vs pain and really began to ship them. In a way naruhina was the reason i got into naruto"
Naruto,3e09ac,hunterbelmont,2,Tue Jul 21 05:03:37 2015 UTC,"Personally, I still would prefer NaruSaku over all the others. Some thing about their characters just seems to mix really well for me. I never cared for NaruHina, but their relationship seems fine. Personally I would've seen Hinata maybe become strong enough to become the next head of the Hyuga, which impresses Naruto and gets his attention. Hopefully we see something that shows how their relationship developed more in the newest movie.   I also used to think SasuSaku was utter garbage until it happened. Now I actually like the pairing."
Naruto,3e09ac,AllenRyder,2,Tue Jul 21 02:58:25 2015 UTC,"Thing about Hinata was that she really never wanted to be head of the clan. She wanted to improve herself and be a competent ninja, but she never had very lofty aspirations. In fact, I think her and Naruto are similar in their goals in life. Naruto wanted to be Hokage, sure, but that's only because everyone hated him and he wanted recognition. Hinata, meanwhile, was basically disowned by her father and hated by her cousin. What they both really want is what they find together: a happy family where everyone loves and accepts each other."
Naruto,3e09ac,Thatguy69Kappa,2,Tue Jul 21 06:19:42 2015 UTC,"hmm..i was shipping sasu/saku because at the time i thought sakura would end up with naruto, i have like this..thing.. of supporting the secondary characters to be the chosen one."
Naruto,3e09ac,Kenny224,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:34:00 2015 UTC,Not that I am a big shipper but i always found Naruto Hinata a must happen in the series if Naruto or Hinata dont somehow die . Hinata was actually the first person to acknowledge but she was to shy to show it and well she played a bigger part in helping Naruto than maybe Iruka . Also never saw Sakura Naruto as a couple that would mesh together . It would just be constant fighting vs fighting and the way they end up they would kinda one day destroy the village . And after Hinata's fight with Pain I was sure NaruHina would happen also after that fight I loved her as a character .
Naruto,3e09ac,Hamurasage,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:47:43 2015 UTC,"I would have loved if it ended with SasuHina and NaruSaku, I don't know how but I think it would be oddly satisfying"

Naruto,3e09ac,MaimedPhoenix,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:12:53 2015 UTC,It was the chuin exams  (not sure if I spelt that right) when she is willing to show naruto her paper at the risk of getting kicked out I was alway on her side after that
Naruto,3e09ac,jamiethejoker26,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:43:23 2015 UTC,"Just a vibe. It all starts with that vibe. I felt that Hinata's crush being referred to and references a lot, and being followed up on, her inner monologues, everything, just implied and foreshadowed that she would end up with him in the end. I would've been quiet about it but fans are very heavy shippers and this naturally influenced me too. Seeing my personal favorite couple get attacked made me feel obliged to defend it and slowly, I got more defensive of their ship to defend it from the hordes of Naruto/Sakura shippers. WHO WON??? So... yeah."

Naruto,3dwfcv,BebopGuitarist,39,Mon Jul 20 08:28:58 2015 UTC,"I think you misunderstood the question. He means what do people think is canon that isn't, not what's a piece of canon that is indisputably the truest and most correct of all."
Naruto,3dwfcv,qwerto14,27,Mon Jul 20 10:51:09 2015 UTC,"I wonder how Hiashi feels now that the kids did not inherit the byakugan. He might feel anxious that his plan has failed... I can image a scenario where one night he slips out of the hyuga clan's house in order to secretly meet up with two fellow Hyuga members outside the Hidden Leaf Village. There, he stabs them in the back thinking ""All for the keikaku..."" and steals their byakugan. Then he goes to Naruto's house and implants the byakugan to his grandchildren while everyone sleeps (a parallel to how Madara implanted his Rinnegan to Nagato). The next morning everyone is surprised to see that both Boruto and Himawari have ""awoken"" the byakugan in their eyes. When some Hyuga members inform Hiashi about it, he acts surpised in front of them but as they are about to leave he grins behind their back thinking ""Just as planned."" and goes to find his beloved daughter and her family. There he tells them a theory that he created of how the byakugan in special cases can be awaken. After having a beautiful moment all together he returns to his house, closes the door behind him and starts laughing uncontrollably."

Naruto,3dwfcv,Neural_groove,10,Tue Jul 21 04:56:32 2015 UTC,"This isn't exactly true.  Naruto is actually the name of a series of whirlpools as well as a city in Japan. The food, narutomaki, is named after the whirlpools.  Think of it like this. A California roll is a type of sushi but no one would say that California means sushi."
Naruto,3dwfcv,Rokksolidrees,4,Mon Jul 20 15:55:25 2015 UTC,"While what you are saying is true, Naruto's name does come from the food. Kishi even used Jiraiya to say it in the manga when, Minato and Kushina tell him they are naming their son Naruto."
Naruto,3dwfcv,AmaranthSparrow,4,Mon Jul 20 18:39:01 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I know. I'm just saying that a Japanese speaker wouldn't necessarily hear Naruto's name and think ""fishcake"" just like an English/Spanish speaker wouldn't hear California and think ""sushi""."

Naruto,3dwfcv,Rokksolidrees,5,Mon Jul 20 19:43:29 2015 UTC,the problem with his name is that it should be lee rock because in japan they put their family name first but they put it as rock lee so thats why it is so different New Movie Spoilers
Naruto,3dwfcv,NormalDAHL,3,Mon Jul 20 05:44:38 2015 UTC,"But aren't Lee and Guy based off of western action movie stars? Even if they were based off of Bruce Lee, throughout most of the world that's how his name is said, not Lee Bruce.

Naruto,3dwfcv,a_gleeful_giraffe,-1,Mon Jul 20 22:47:26 2015 UTC,A theory I like. Before metal there was rock. Before rock there was blues. Blues = Bruce.
Naruto,3dwfcv,a_gleeful_giraffe,13,Mon Jul 20 20:51:45 2015 UTC,There's some rumor that got started that Sasuke likes tomatoes and I literally have no idea where it's from. Maybe it's canon and I'm just out of the loop
Naruto,3dwfcv,Caliburn0,37,Mon Jul 20 06:24:52 2015 UTC,"That's from the databooks. The databooks list most of the main characters' favorite foods. Sasuke's favorite foods are rice balls and tomatoes. It is weird how much some people fixate on it, though.  Source: http://naruto.wikia.com/wiki/Sasuke_Uchiha#Trivia"
Naruto,3dwfcv,DrBloodlust,7,Mon Jul 20 06:45:56 2015 UTC,Thank you!! I was so confused as to where that was from. I agree that the fixation is pretty weird- that's why I thought it was just a fan thing at first
Naruto,3dwfcv,knight504,3,Mon Jul 20 07:19:24 2015 UTC,"Well, considering how boring a moody teenager is, we have to give him some character quirks. That one is just ripe for the taking."
Naruto,3dwfcv,DrBloodlust,6,Mon Jul 20 23:04:03 2015 UTC,For Naruto using too much chakra for a clone probably comes from the episode where Ebisu is explaining how inefficient Naruto is at it and uses too much chakra. Don't know if it was canon or buffer though.
Naruto,3dwfcv,kaito0,2,Mon Jul 20 05:36:18 2015 UTC,Ebisu says that Naruto creates too much chakra and then uses too little.
Naruto,3dwfcv,IKillDirtyPeasants,3,Mon Jul 20 05:38:35 2015 UTC,Had to actually look up the scene and he says that he uses alot of chakra but doesn't have to control to use it effectively. Either way it runs counter to the theory that he creates so many clones to equalize his chakra build up. Oops :P
Naruto,3dwfcv,Otium20,11,Mon Jul 20 05:49:32 2015 UTC,"There is a bright side to all of those fanon references. They in no way corrupt how the original story lays out. They either have no real impact on the story, or they don't directly make you wonder why they're like that. I do however like the idea that Naruto can't perform the clone jutsu or genjutsu because he has too much chakra. It makes a lot of sense, as does the take on Lee's condition of not being able to mold chakra."
Naruto,3dwfcv,LILY_LALA,5,Mon Jul 20 02:48:45 2015 UTC,That doesn't work in the case of Lee. He's stood on water before so he's capable of molding chakra.   I think it's just a case of talent and playing to his strengths. Why spend years training to only be mediocre at ninjutsu and genjutsu when he can use that same time and effort to become a taijutsu master?
Naruto,3dwfcv,Caliburn0,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:04:05 2015 UTC,I've read the explanation on the Rock Lee standing on waterthing being that due to a defect be can't use his chakra outside of his body. Just a few millimetres for tree walking and water walking is enough though.
Naruto,3dwfcv,alloev,10,Tue Jul 21 11:03:51 2015 UTC,"The ""Namikaze clan"" ffs can't anyone in this story be good without having a clan sho horned onto them?, at lest most fanfics only call it a ""minor"" clan but jesus still almost every fic its a clan"

I have no idea where it came from, but it used to be on wikis and in fanfics/fanart galore back in the day lmao.   Edit: Evidently Kishimoto doesn't know either because he forgot it was mentioned lollll"

And if Sarada's just half-Uchiha and luckily, the Uchiha genes were more dominant, she got dem eyes... although, with glasses.  The Hyuga Clan is a clan that most fans think that they inbreed, exception for Naruto and Hinata 'cause you know... for the NaruHina fans, and Kishimoto somewhat intended it to be canon from the start, anyway... Not to mention that he forgot to give Naruto's kids the Byakugan."
Naruto,3dwfcv,CanadianJudo,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:48:20 2015 UTC,"It's not stated outright, but that's why the Hyuga Clan has two branches. The fourth databook goes as far as saying that they took efforts to preserve their kekkei genkai, which had been bred out of other clans (as a recessive trait).  Kishimoto drew a lot of inspiration from Koga Ninja Scrolls, a novel he read for research early on during the development of Naruto. It's a classic piece of Japanese pulp fiction from the 50s, about two warring ninja clans that have used selective inbreeding to cultivate special abilities (including doujutsu) in its members. It's obviously a bit more sinister in the novel, as they also tend to have genetic defects as a result of the inbreeding."
Naruto,3dwfcv,lilkarenm321,-1,Mon Jul 20 19:55:18 2015 UTC,"Wait. If he had a girlfriend in the clan, is that incest?"
Naruto,3dwfcv,pearlofivris,13,Mon Jul 20 08:36:33 2015 UTC,"A clan can be very large. Two people of native american descent can have sex without it being incest.   Two people in an eskimo village can have sex and not have it be incest.   A clan is a group of people with similar genes, like a race. It's not a small family. Besides, aren't we all related if we go back far enough. All sex is basically incest if you go back far enough."
Naruto,3dwfcv,alloev,2,Mon Jul 20 14:33:24 2015 UTC,"Clans can be huge the House of Saud which is one of the most powerful Clans in Middle east has over 10,000 member's."

Naruto,3dwfcv,simc0,-9,Mon Jul 20 05:21:39 2015 UTC,You're stupid
Naruto,3dwfcv,DasKatze500,7,Mon Jul 20 07:31:22 2015 UTC,"Kyuubi is the strongest bijuu.    Common in fanon, but Kishimoto tended to dance around the topic, including a scene where Gyuki outright denies Kurama's claim that  beast strength is dependent on tails.    Female Uchiha cannot posses/ rarely awaken the Sharingan.   Disproven with Sarada, but I saw this everywhere around the time of her awakening the eye and before it.    Uchiha were specially privileged.    Mostly fanfic exclusive. I don't see this one quite as often anymore, but writers would put the Uchiha clan on shiny Konoha pedastals, reverred by all but a handful and possessing of an elitist nature. Pretty sure it's the exact opposite in canon.  Also, 'Hn'. Everytime.   Tsunade is the last Senju.    There is literally nothing about the fate of the Senju clan in canon; they pretty much ceased to exist after Konoha's founding (barring the obvious). Also, has Tsunade ever used the Senju title in the manga? As far as I remember, she only called herself by her first name.   There are more that are common to fanfics, but it's debatable whether they are fan theories or simply plot devices."
Naruto,3dwfcv,night4345,15,Mon Jul 20 13:58:02 2015 UTC,"Common in fanon, but Kishimoto tended to dance around the topic, including a scene where Gyuki outright denies Kurama's claim that beast strength is dependent on tails.   Just read chapter 571 again. Kurama proves once and for all he is by far the strongest when he defeats 5 other tailed beasts at the same time, including matching their combined tailed beast bomb by himself."
Naruto,3dwfcv,spaghettidrk,7,Mon Jul 20 17:37:25 2015 UTC,"considering he fought only with one half, the diffrence gets even bigger"
Naruto,3dwfcv,TheCervixPounder_69,3,Mon Jul 20 20:52:34 2015 UTC,"Sasuke says Hn! Well, he grunts it, and it's definitely overused in Fanfiction, but it's not come out of nowhere."

Gyuki said Kurama shouldn't judge strength by tails because Shukaku hated him for it. He never said it wasn't true."
Naruto,3dwfcv,Rosebunse,0,Mon Jul 20 19:44:35 2015 UTC,"I have a bit of a theory. I started to believe that the reason the beasts with more tails have more/more powerful chakra is because they weren't born as versatile as their lesser tailed siblings.   With Shukaku being the weakest in terms of raw power, he has sealing tattoos, Magnet Style, and Wind Style. Compared to Kurama who can only use wind style and honestly it sucks compared to his raw bijudama anyway, the only good thing about kurama's wind style is that it synergizes with Naruto."
Naruto,3dwfcv,night4345,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:15:11 2015 UTC,Kurama has not been shown to have any elemental chakra in the manga. Fire and wind are anime only.
Naruto,3dwfcv,9000cody,6,Tue Jul 21 12:20:15 2015 UTC,"I don't know if this is popular, but I do see some fanfics here and there that say Itachi's first kill was when he was 4, during the Third Shinobi World War. He only saw what happened and that traumatized him, but he did not kill anyone."
Naruto,3dwfcv,hosche,3,Mon Jul 20 13:08:13 2015 UTC,"I know people have good reasons to hate the council, but the sheer amount of hate they get and the absolutely evil portrayals are a bit much."
Naruto,3dwfcv,pearlofivris,4,Mon Jul 20 16:47:33 2015 UTC,I think it went away now but years ago we had Itachi loving Pocky. Nowhere in-canon or databooks does it say he loves it.
Naruto,3dwfcv,9000cody,6,Mon Jul 20 19:48:00 2015 UTC,Actually Crystal style users!
Naruto,3dwfcv,IdRatherBeLurking,7,Mon Jul 20 06:04:22 2015 UTC,"I think it was filler but Guren was a crystal style user in the anime. So it's probably not canon, but it's also not fanon."
Naruto,3dwfcv,9000cody,6,Mon Jul 20 06:13:29 2015 UTC,"I liked Guren's Crystal Style. She was one of my favorite filler characters because of her ninjutsu. Wished it was canon instead, though. :/"
Naruto,3dwfcv,IdRatherBeLurking,-2,Mon Jul 20 12:52:53 2015 UTC,Not cannon I believe but I think there's Crystal style users still out there in the world that are cannon even if fans don't care much for it or believe it. It's my personal fanon
Naruto,3dwfcv,IdRatherBeLurking,2,Mon Jul 20 06:20:12 2015 UTC,"It's spelled canon  It was in a filler arc, and never mentioned in the manga."
Naruto,3dwfcv,IdRatherBeLurking,4,Mon Jul 20 15:42:15 2015 UTC,Isn't that from an anime filler arc? Filler isn't really fanon.

Naruto,3dxc0j,penguin_cheezus,13,Mon Jul 20 08:46:32 2015 UTC,"The Sannin fought Hanzo presumably at the end of the second war. A little time after that Jiraiya trained the Ame orphans, starting somewhere just a few months, or even weeks after the Hanzo fight.   A few years went by, and then Kakashi, Obito, Gai and most of the older generation was born. Itachi was born a little after them and then the third war started, while those we know as adults were just out of the academy. Itachi, being a prodigy Uchiha was sent right into the fray. AS A FUCKING 5 YEAR OLD! (yeah... it's fucked up) His (Itachi's) first kill was sometime during the 3rd war while he was 4 - 5 years old. It lasted a few years until Minato said Hiraishin no jutsu and everyone quit. The third Raikage also died in a fight against 10.000 shinobi. Sasori got famous. The original Akatsuki roamed Ame, trying to make peace, and then Yahiko died. Ao got his Byakugan.  Itachi is about 6-7 years older than Sasuke and Naruto. The elemental nations gradually slipped into this war and thus there is no fixed starting point. It is also described as a war of attrition.  Honestly, the exact time it took is hard to pinpoint, but I would take a guess and say anywhere from 3 to 7 years. With 5 being my best guess.   Sources: http://naruto.wikia.com/wiki/Third_Shinobi_World_War, http://jesterry.deviantart.com/art/Naruto-Timeline-Sketch-288724804, My mind.  Edit: Apparently Itachi did not fight during the third war, and only saw the aftermath."
Naruto,3dxc0j,Caliburn0,6,Mon Jul 20 11:25:19 2015 UTC,"About the Itachi part... From what I know (and from checking on Narutopedia), the Third Shinobi World War suddenly broke out and Itachi when he was 4, well... he just saw the mess, the corpses and the blood and all that. He was traumatized, but he didn't actually kill anybody.  Also Itachi is 5 years older than the 9 rookies, to be exact.  (This ""4 year old Itachi seeing the Third Shinobi World War"" and ""how Itachi passed the Chunin Exams at 10 years old in detail"" better be on Itachi Shinden. Or my fangirl heart won't be satisfied.)"
Naruto,3dxc0j,pearlofivris,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:02:10 2015 UTC,"Oh, yeah. Apparently it did break out when Itachi was four. Or at least the wiki says so. Where did you get Itachi's age from?"

Naruto,3e0oe5,TCpls,2,Tue Jul 21 10:33:45 2015 UTC,I honestly enjoy watching about his history because kakashi plays a major role in it and it take out the mystery in kakashi. The show DEFINITELY has possibly too many flashbacks and could slim it down just a little but in my opinion they're needed to tell the entire story of naruto and his comrades.
Naruto,3e0oe5,TandyHard,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:19:39 2015 UTC,"I don't really mind his backstory, it's just the fact that Obito plays such a central role in the end of the series, they gave his tragedy far more weight than Sasuke's, even though Obito's tragedy doesn't come close to what Sasuke went through."

Naruto,3dup8u,forgotmypasswordzzz,10,Sun Jul 19 18:21:32 2015 UTC,I thought that too but I think that Pain attacked Konoha around episode 100 of Shippuden - which means that it is accurate
Naruto,3dup8u,coldvikinglyrics,2,Sun Jul 19 20:46:10 2015 UTC,Felt later than that i guess.  Damn filler really warps how long it feels.

Naruto,3dup8u,PakiIronman,2,Sun Jul 19 20:51:03 2015 UTC,I totally understand the guy haha :D and yeah I agree with you. Both the Pain confession and Obito confession (it's kind of a confession) were done pretty good
Naruto,3dup8u,coldvikinglyrics,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:59:21 2015 UTC,"I assume you mean in The Last? I haven't seen it yet, but if you mean the one in episode 386, could you give a reason why? I thought it was very frustrating to have the confession and then ignore it for several hundred chapters."
Naruto,3dup8u,Evilsbane,4,Mon Jul 20 16:34:44 2015 UTC,"I like to think Naruto going 5 tails immediately after she got stabbed, then meeting his dad, then having to defeat and talk to nagato, made him forget exactly what happened."

Naruto,3dvq7r,zero105,9,Mon Jul 20 21:46:57 2015 UTC,"The thing about most of the akatsuki is that most of them have special abilities unique to them.  Like Nagato, Tobi, Kakuzu, all have jutsu and abilities that are either kekkei genkai or just impossible to replicate as a student.  Given that, Konan & maybe Kisame w/o Samehada are probably among the only ones whose ninjutsu talents can be learned via disciplehood."

Naruto,3dvq7r,HeavensGamer,9,Mon Jul 20 06:03:16 2015 UTC,Itachi intelligent and powerful as fk
Naruto,3dvq7r,ImCodeGreen,10,Sun Jul 19 23:50:04 2015 UTC,Only problem I see choosing Itachi is that he can't pass down his best techniques and as an Uchiha he's liable to murder you.
Naruto,3dvq7r,Neural_groove,8,Mon Jul 20 00:00:39 2015 UTC,"If really wanted to, he could give you his eyes (that possess his more powerful techniques) and even though he is Uchiha, he never murdered anyone without reason. He was pretty calm most of his life, especially while in the Akatsuki so I don't see him murdering a student of his."
Naruto,3dvq7r,HeavensGamer,2,Mon Jul 20 00:37:01 2015 UTC,"He witnessed so much death and murder as a child during the third shinobi world war that he became a pacifist. It shows in all of him battles too. He never throws the first punch and usually ends battles as fast as possible using eye techniques. He may do damage, but it's almost never physical.   ex: his run-in with naruto and chiyo going to go save gaara/ when itachi runs into jonin and uses tsukiyomi to incapacitate and escape/ when battles deidara to convince him to join akatsuki/ every attack on sasuke during his battle was to push him to the point of exposing orochimaru's chakra and sealing him."
Naruto,3dvq7r,Toad_Sage_Jiraiya,3,Mon Jul 20 06:36:52 2015 UTC,While i agree with what CodeGreen has said if what you say is true then i would still learn a lot from him before he tries to kill me

Naruto,3dvq7r,Ridoon,5,Mon Jul 20 00:40:11 2015 UTC,"Konan! Or Itachi. They both seem like the most patient/forgiving lol.  And definitely not Hidan, can't put up with his cult bs"

Naruto,3dvq7r,BlackZetsu,1 point,Mon Jul 20 10:21:21 2015 UTC,"I would say Orochimaru. Pein only uses his Six Path abilites making it useless for you to learn from him as you could only learn taijutsu. Itachi mainly uses his genjutsu through his sharingan, again making him useless unless you were an Uchiha (in which case I would pick Itachi).  Orochimaru however has a wide variety of jutsu's he could teach you, for obvious reasons, and he also is proficient at taijutsu, even without his arms. He could stand toe to toe with 4 tails Naruto mode with only the use of snakes and the Summoning gates for quite a while, along with the grass longsword."

Naruto,3dxglm,BelieveInThePeeko,2,Tue Jul 21 00:20:51 2015 UTC,Could be an oversight
Naruto,3dxglm,Phisix,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:24:16 2015 UTC,"The necklace chain seems to go through the gap in the pendant. If that's the case it could've easily just shifted slightly.   If not, then it's a tiny oversight by the animators. Good catch."
Naruto,3dxglm,Neural_groove,3,Mon Jul 20 15:09:18 2015 UTC,Its like that everywhere except the manga. Even the licensed merch and every fan site I know of has the triangle pointed down.
Naruto,3dxglm,Neural_groove,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:16:58 2015 UTC,"I think the reason is that the people who animate the manga also do drawing for the merchandising as well.   Good catch, OP. You dived very deep down this undiscovered rabbit hole."
Naruto,3dxee9,Ser_BellyFarts,3,Mon Jul 20 09:21:55 2015 UTC,"No, these abridged series are all parodies (the one by LittleKuriboh is pretty rad btw) Anyway, there isn't really a point in watching single episodes, rather should you focus on specific arcs. Some of my favorites include the Pain arc (obviously), the Five Kage Summit (really liked that one!), the significantly shorter Itachi Persuit arc, as well as the often overlooked Hidan&Kakuzo arc (though it's a bit slow-paced). The next two sentences may contain spoilers: From the Jinchuuriki Training Arc the fight vs Kyuubi followed by Kushina's flashback is pretty dope. The 4th Shinobi War arc holds some gems too, like Mifune vs Hanzo, Sai vs his brother, Gaara vs the 4th Kazekage and of course Madara's first appearance and his fight against the Gokage (a must-watch!) As for Part 1 most of the arcs are worth watching, really. They are all amazingly great and not that long if you skip the fillers. To do so you can use this list as a help: http://narutoepisodes.net/filler-list/"

Naruto,3dxee9,pearlofivris,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:10:24 2015 UTC,Maybe you should just read a summary of the episodes that you don't remember what happened anymore. I think that would be easier.
Naruto,3dxee9,Neural_groove,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:30:44 2015 UTC,"Perhaps the fastest thing to do for you would be to read the manga up until the Konoha Crush plot. It shouldn't take you more than a couple of hours to finish it.   Idk if that's what you want to do but it meets your requirements of no filler, no spoof."

Naruto,3dx6rd,Crowzur,4,Mon Jul 20 08:24:02 2015 UTC,"It's a fighting game. A fighting game, racing game and occasionally a shooter rely on the frame rate a lot. It may not seem like much, but the difference between seeing a chidori or whatever come at you at 30 or 60 frames can be the difference between a block or a hit."
Naruto,3dx6rd,yodonteatthat,0,Mon Jul 20 08:32:55 2015 UTC,"I'm going to respectfully disagree with you there.  Latency, or dropping frames (between system-to-monitor or online connection) can ruin gameplay.  But a smoothe-running, consistent 30fps is more than enough to keep a fighter snappy. SF4 runs at 60, with the minimal move startups (dp's, jabs, etc) being 3 frames.  most moves come out in 4-8 frames.  That kind of thing at 30 fps just cuts those frame numbers in half, affecting nothing.  Hell, good human reaction time is >= 6/60 sec.  For something considerably less technical than a competitive fighter, the only way a human is going to be able to tell a difference between 30/60 without a side-by-side comparison is by looking at the specs written on the box."

Naruto,3duqxe,Sabin10,2,Sun Jul 19 18:25:42 2015 UTC,"I disagree, Ive been trying to get a lot of people into Naruto who loved DBKai and FMABrotherhood but they cannot get past the Chunnin exams because there is A LOT of flashbacks and times where the camera just pans around the terrain for a minute and 30 secs before someone talks or moves.  Rewatching the series with friends I can easily cut out 5 mins of useless scenes per episode."
Naruto,3duqxe,TyFenrir,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:48:54 2015 UTC,The dragon ball anime ended in 1996 and the Kai series started in 2009.   It will be a while until Naruto gets any similar treatment considering the anime is still ongoing and will continue after the series ends.

Naruto,3dvtgw,HokageEzio,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:07:46 2015 UTC,Yeah but I am uneasy with they WAY he died. He got stabbed by a couple of tree branches and that's it. I mean Tsunade was splitted in half and she still had enough power to freaking do a kuchiyotse and recover.

These were high velocity spears moving faster than his rotation, which came from the most powerful thing in the planet. That shit fucked his body up.   Naruto called for medics but there was just too much bloodshed."
Naruto,3dvtgw,ediaz0209,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:58:07 2015 UTC,"What made it feel cheap was that Neji was underused post-timeskip and he died in a relatively anti-climactic way. I mean, jumping in front of some spikes out of no where? It should have been a more elaborate and personal type of death.  Take, for instance, Asuma's death. I'd argue he was a less developed character than Neji, but at least before he died, the series ""fattened him up"" by giving him a lot screen time. Same with Jiraiya and Sarutobi's death. But Neji? He barely got to do anything in the war and all his moments were either generic battle shots or dumb jokes."
Naruto,3dvtgw,hunterbelmont,3,Mon Jul 20 03:13:19 2015 UTC,"He protected the main branch, wasn't really out of nowhere.  That whole end flashback showed why it was personal.  Now, Kishi definitely wrote it specifically for him to die, won't deny that.  Hyuga show up talking about being the best even though they barely did anything Part 2.  Kishi shows the rotation isn't enough by hitting the head band, then Neji dies.  He really was the only guy personal enough to die."
Naruto,3dvtgw,HokageEzio,0,Mon Jul 20 03:24:37 2015 UTC,"He protected the main branch, wasn't really out of nowhere. That whole end flashback showed why it was personal.   No, no, no, no, no. You could have taken that and attached it to any death of his. He could have had a a 5-chapter mini-arc where he has to infiltrate the 10-tails and shut off its power reactor, and then you could have attached the same flashback to it afterward. The flashback isn't the problem. The problem is the  SPIKES ---> NEJI JUMPS IN OUT OF NO WHERE  Neji deserved better than to die at the hands of some generic monster's throwaway attack. If this were a video game, those spike's would have been a mid-level attack for the final boss's 1st of three transformations, that would maybe trip you up the first time, but you'd learn to dodge the second time after."
Naruto,3dvtgw,hunterbelmont,2,Mon Jul 20 03:30:59 2015 UTC,"I am 100% with this guy. With the amount of USELEESS filler we had, we clearly could have had a 5 chappter Neji-gaiden something to further develp his character hand give more meaning to his life and his death. Hell, even Danzo had a flashback at the time of his death that explained how he was not a bad guy intentions-wise... Neji -> branches -> dead! With the whole medical core and naruto there. I mean cmon! Guy lives after opening all 8 gates!! Wanted a meanningful death!? How about that?!?!"

Naruto,3dvtgw,hunterbelmont,2,Mon Jul 20 03:33:13 2015 UTC,The war should been village against village. The Edo Tensei and fodder White Zetsu never should have come into the picture. Kishi just didn't want the kids to kill anyone living.
Naruto,3dvtgw,erockarmy1,2,Mon Jul 20 12:41:20 2015 UTC,I think that's a bit...depressing. The point of the War Arc was to bring the villages together. Another real ninja war just would have been the same thing they'd had before.
Naruto,3dvtgw,Rosebunse,2,Mon Jul 20 16:04:36 2015 UTC,"Now, to be fair, the timeline wasn't quite as weird as the Namek Arc of DBZ. However, yes Kishi really wrote himself into a hole with Madara, and Kaguya was probably the best of a bad situation.   I got the feeling from the arc that, really, Kishi was getting tired of the manga by that point."

Naruto,3dvtgw,erockarmy1,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:42:10 2015 UTC,"The Edo Tenseis could have been executed way better. The Edo Tensei's were great for adding hype for a chapter. Seven Swordsmen? Hyped, couldn't wait to see how they worked and their power as a unit. Instead we get nothing, aside from a few panels that made it look like they were one trick ponies. They also could have been a way for other characters to shine, one last ride before the series ended. For example I was hoping for a Lee vs Kimmimaro rematch. And on Madara, I felt that Kishi had a decent enough build up between Madara and Naruto/Sasuke, they were on par, and on top of that, saving Kakashi and Sakura from Infinite Tsukuyomi ended up with a Team 7 vs. Madara standoff. It would have been perfect for his downfall, with his preaching about how he can control all this power, he's the savior, no one person can beat him, would have been poetic justice for the main characters to use teamwork to defeat him"
Naruto,3dvtgw,Danbito,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:43:26 2015 UTC,"The only problem was that Kishi rushed it. It started really good, but too much was skipped. I think he planned fights like Suigetsu vs his brother, Mangetsu and Kimimaro vs Jugo, both using cursed seal lvl 2. Torune Aburame poisoning everybody and his father, Shikuro Aburma saving everybody with the antidote (Torune was revived as an Edo Tensei, never appeared again. And Tobi mentioned his father when he first met him and that he has the antidote, was never mentioned again. So he clearly skipped something here: http://i20.readcdn.com/naruto/475/naruto-1038332.jpg ) Maybe the editors told him to skip the stuff, because most readers want to see the main characters..."

Edo tensei could have been done better, especially in the anime where they could have expanded on the edo's and their interactions with other characters. Spoilers  Nejis death was average. Especially considering kishi even says Spoilers. The fact he used that as the reason to kill of the character irks me the most.  Overall the war arc could have been much better. the edo fights should have been longer in most cases, instead they were regulated to a panel or two every few chaps, Especially the revived jins. IDK about anyone else but as a manga reader when i first saw those guys lined up with sharingans and rinnegans i was hyped as hell. That is one of the panels that gave the me chills reading it. The fight itself was average. It could have been done better."
Naruto,3dvtgw,Toad_Sage_Jiraiya,0,Mon Jul 20 01:05:23 2015 UTC,"Yes, most people believe that the War Arc was the weakest in the series. That said, removing Madara for Kaguya was the smartest decision Kishimoto did in years."
Naruto,3dvtgw,hunterbelmont,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:10:15 2015 UTC,"War Arc is definitely weakest from a story perspective. This was where you could tell Kishimoto made it up as he went along. But I don't agree with the Madara Kaguya decision, but I guess agree to disagree."
Naruto,3dvtgw,Danbito,2,Mon Jul 20 03:34:05 2015 UTC,"I don't understand people who wanted to see the series play out with Madara. He was so insufferable and overused at that point. He'd been around for, what, a couple hundred chapters or so? More if you count Tobito as his extension. Maybe one villain in a million can carry a series that long, but Madara certainly wasn't one of them. Kaguya, by comparison, was a godsend."
Naruto,3dvtgw,hunterbelmont,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:44:28 2015 UTC,"I can see how, but again Kishi just kept making it up as he went along, probably didn't mean to introduce him when he did if he were to do it all over. But the guy was built up that he had to go down, I'm talking Team 7 just straight humiliating him throughout the fight. I wouldn't even mind Kaguya if Madara's end wasn't so ...abrupt. Honestly I'd just cut from Obito and Madara getting the Ten-Tails to him betraying Obito, revive him and just proceed to become Jinchuriki"
Naruto,3dvpjh,qokz,5,Sun Jul 19 22:42:20 2015 UTC,Perhaps he thought Gamaken's set of skills - the staff and shield - would be more useful than Gamabunta's. It also introduced another giant toad for the reader. Risking your life for information that could save the lives of your comrades is a part of the job. He made a judgment call and he had good reason. He got his throat crushed in a surprise attack at practically the same moment he figured out the secret.
Naruto,3dvpjh,knight504,2,Sun Jul 19 23:00:03 2015 UTC,"1) Bunta's definitely not fit for that situation, I don't see him being as nimble as Gamaken.  They're built for pretty different situations, Bunta's more of an open field guy.  2) Cause he has guts.  His mission was to investigate Pain, he died to complete the mission.  It can be stupidity, stubbornness, or courage depending on who you ask, same goes for Naruto.    3) Kinda hard to substitute after getting your throat crushed... by the time he had it it was too late.  Then once he wrote the message he got shot.  Edit- Full representation of how quick it happened after he found the truth out.  Literally the same instant.  There was no escape."
Naruto,3dvpjh,HokageEzio,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:10:02 2015 UTC,"1-Gamaken was more deffensive and that's what he needed.  2- I agree with you. No ammount of information was worth his life. It was time to fall back and find another way to figure out the rest of the information  3- Same. All in all, I feel like Jiraiya's death is one of the most heart felt to me, but also one of the dumbest deaths in all the series, as he had plenty of chances to NOT die."
Naruto,3dsrb6,PugSwagMaster,39,Sun Jul 19 02:35:23 2015 UTC,"I don't disagree but imagine the consequences if somebody had actually died trying to get Sasuke back. Would've been pretty horrific, everybody in the village and especially Shikamaru and Ino probably would've resented him forever. Since nobody from the Leaf actually died because of Sasuke (not counting Danzo obviously) his return was made a lot easier I think.  Imagine being Sasuke and finding out that the nice fat guy from your class died literally solely because of you. Sure he would pretend not to care and convince himself he really didn't but damn.  So all in all, I'm glad nobody died."
Naruto,3dsrb6,maryinwinter,55,Sun Jul 19 04:49:45 2015 UTC,"Yep. Dude should have died there. Was a touching sacrifice from a guy who was just seen as a fat loser.

Naruto,3dsrb6,thesequimkid,2,Sun Jul 19 18:33:47 2015 UTC,"Frankly, I think a lot of characters should have died. Not because I enjoy seeing characters die, but because it got to the point where it seemed like people were invincible.  Choji or Neji should have died in the retrieval arc.  Tsunade should have died in the attack on Konoha.  Guy should have died after opening the 8 gates.  Aside from humanizing the characters and making us as readers actually feel afraid when we see someone in danger, it also would have lent a lot more emotion to the remaining crew, as they would have to deal with the deaths of their comrades.  The ninja world is supposed to be a cruel one (or so we are repeatedly told), and it would have been nice to see that a bit more, and see how our typically upbeat cast of characters dealt with it."

Naruto,3ds26u,FakeAdminAccount,4,Sun Jul 19 10:35:54 2015 UTC,"I don't think so, at least not in a biological sense. They may choose a gender to identify themselves with, but the way ""fem-Kyuubi"" almost always turns out to be some sexy redhead who tries to seduce Naruto is absurd."

Naruto,3ds26u,FakeAdminAccount,4,Sun Jul 19 11:15:35 2015 UTC,"not popular  overused as fuck   What?  But no, I'm not talking about those stories with like 2k words and maybe 4 reviews. I use the parameters of 40k+ words and by favorites (mostly to avoid stories that are pretty much just accepted as shit), yet I still see ridiculous cliches which immediately ruin the story for me. So some people have to at least tolerate this shit, if not enjoy it. Why is beyond my comprehension."
Naruto,3ds26u,covenantofsoulsVI,3,Sun Jul 19 12:17:51 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I contradicted myself there, sorry!   What I meant is that they all use the same 'plot' and wonder why they don't get any readers, it's because there are already 50 million copies of the same story...  I normally only read stories with 20k+ words but sometimes I lower it to see if there is a new story that I might like."

Also just got home from vacation in Japan like yesterday, and the hype for naruto is REALLY low... In almost any of the shops over there they at most have a small shelf with Naruto merchandise(This can have it's reasons like the series is ending and all), and the merchandise they got are only figurines or keychain thingys. So besides the Boroto movie commercials not much is going on for naruto there.   I honestly wouldn't even be surprised if it isen't in the top 10 most popular manga/animes over there anymore."

Naruto,3dsrgn,Zomg_A_Chicken,9,Sun Jul 19 03:42:21 2015 UTC,IIRC the original series filler was to let the Manga make enough material so they could make Shippuden at a pace the network would accept.

Oh and that face Kakashi makes when he finds out Gai taught Lee the gates was amazing.  Also, the filler episode where Gai talks about the camaraderie between him and Kakashi where they are fighting as eachothers senses against the swordsmen of the mist.

Naruto,3dtcvm,Aaroniero,2,Sun Jul 19 18:42:28 2015 UTC,There was a lot of time between that moment and when the Infinite Tsukuyomi started. They could've done any number of things to him during that time.
Naruto,3dtcvm,Aaroniero,0,Sun Jul 19 18:58:40 2015 UTC,"Exactly.  Could have.  Maybe they didn't. When Kakashi was talking to the lower half of Black Zetsu, he said the Allied forces believed Black Zetsu was captured, indicating they hadn't killed him.  That was no more than a few hours before the Infinite Tsukuyomi.  Odds are the top half of Black Zetsu slipped away at that time.  And if it never reunited with its lower half, it could still be out there."

Kishimoto only brought back up his journey for plot description when the Edo Swordsmen were around, that's how you know that plot point was useless.  Literally, he used Suigetsu like a walking encyclopedia, just so we know what the swords do.  Also Akatsuki rings.  They meant nothing in the end.  Orochimaru kept a disgusting, chopped off arm solely for decoration, cause that ring didn't mean shit."
Naruto,3dqt93,HokageEzio,17,Sat Jul 18 16:22:41 2015 UTC,"To be honest, Suigetsu would qualify as pointless for me in general. At least in the role he was given as a part of Sasuke's team. I think he would have served better as a current ninja of Kiri like Ao or Chojuro; that village probably has the smallest number of named, living and loyal shinobi to appear in the series.  Karin's one of the best sensors in the series and Juugo could speak to animals, both of which made them useful in tracking Itachi which was the entire reason they were put together. Suigetsu was just a bit of extra muscle who achieved very little by being Sasuke's lackey.  Spoilers"
Naruto,3dqt93,knight504,6,Sat Jul 18 17:00:52 2015 UTC,"It's not like it doesn't make sense for them to have the least loyal people, the Mist fell apart worse than the Sand in Part 1.

Naruto,3dqt93,BioshockedNinja,2,Sat Jul 18 17:29:18 2015 UTC,"Kakashi was like Sasuke in his academy days, Genin, Chunin and Jonin. What I think it is, he probably never really cared about women, he even didn't know Rin loved him (or purposely ignored her romantic stuff, just like Sasuke did), all he cared at that time about being strong, and following the ninja rules (until Obito TnJ'd Kakashi at that time of 3rd great shinobi war)."
Naruto,3dqt93,k-tax,1 point,Sun Jul 19 08:23:26 2015 UTC,Because people lose interest if you stone wall them for too long.  He wasn't rude like Sasuke but I never got the impression that he went out of his way meet new people or get to know others all that much.  He was courteous to those he came across but he wasn't looking for companionship.  So maybe he started out popular but over the years people are going to take the hint.
Naruto,3dqt93,ohwowcanyounot,1 point,Sun Jul 19 08:39:07 2015 UTC,"Kakashi got rekt by the death of his father, later death of Obito, Rin, Minato... he had pretty hard life, and trust me, fooling around with girls is the least things that come to mind when you feel troubled."

Naruto,3dqt93,Dovahking94,1 point,Sat Jul 18 15:59:43 2015 UTC,"A lot of people seem to think that Kishimoto had some grand plan but he was literally making it up on the fly nearly the whole time, especially before the time skip.   So much of the early stuff had no definitive direction other than the Sasuke-Orochimaru stuff and the big picture of Naruto learning how to control the Kyuubi chakra.  However, he might have just been trying to use her to imply how recent they had been at war with the other countries or on opposing missions. She's young but guided by her desire to avenge a friend. Or maybe he had thought about expanding on the Anbu but never got around to it. We'll never know."

Naruto,3dqt93,HeavensGamer,8,Sun Jul 19 01:13:33 2015 UTC,"Half of the people who were Edo-Tenseid. Notably these four, Kakuzu, Deidara (after Sasori was sealed), Kimmimaro (would have been awesome if he somehow ran into Jugo), Chiyo (at least she got a filler), the 7 Njnja Swordsmen (should have gotten at least 10-15 chapters on their encounter. Most of the focus was on Zabuza/Haku while it should have been on Mangetsu and just Kirikagure as a whole), the 6 Edo- Jinchuriki fight was pretty lame as well (was the perfect opportunity to make a 20 episode filler in the Jinchuriki and the other villages. Approx 3 episodes for each Jinchuriki would have been great).  TL;DR: almost all Edo Tenseis during the war"
Naruto,3dqt93,FalseCape,6,Sat Jul 18 18:01:35 2015 UTC,The Zabuza/Haku bit was right in the feels though. The japanese version gets me real bad.
Naruto,3dqt93,DommoUk,3,Sat Jul 18 18:02:28 2015 UTC,"I didn't mind that part. It was great, but after our ""feel trip"" we should have gotten straight back to the fighting, but instead, Kishi made it seem as if the 7 Ninja Swordsmen weren't really much of a threat anymore after Zabuza got sealed.  It would have been great if Jugo and Suigetsu would have gotten involved in the war after escaping from the prison. Weren't they already starting to piece everything together?  If they would have gotten involved, Kishi could have made use of Edo-Kimmkmaro and we could have had an encounter between Jugo + Suigestu and Kimmimaro in a forest somewhere. Jugi and Kimmimari could have had an emotional talk catching up with each other (with some funny Suigetsu commentary), and then Kabuto could have shut off Kimmimaro's emotions which could have led to a great Kimmimaro vs Jugo + Suigetsu fight.  After this, we could have gotten some focus on how each company was fighting in the war and after 30 chapters or so of this (all the 7 Njnja Swordsmen excluding Mangetsu would be sealed by this time too) Kjshi could have still shown how Kakashi'z company got split up fighting the 7 Ninja Swordsmen + Gari/ Pakura and he could have had a scene in which some fodder ninja + Sai and Lee or whatever are shown struggling against the last Swordsman left to seal- Mangetsu along with a couple White-Zetsu fodder. Jugo and Suigetsu would arrive to save the day and  help them and we could have gotten an awesome fight between Suigetsu and Mangetsu (while also having them talk and explain that Mangetsu died trying to protect Suigetsu from Orochimaru or something).  Anyway, what I'm trying to say is, I (and many other people) have so many ideas over how the first half of the war could (and should) have gone, and Kishi failed to deliver which is really dissoointing.  edit: sorry for an grammatical errors. I'm on mobile."
Naruto,3dqt93,Radu2703,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:38:49 2015 UTC,"I couldn't agree more. The whole edo tensei thing at the start of the war was underwhelming with what it could have been. It was bad enough the manga skipped over most of them, but in the anime that has filler all the time? OMG if i was studio perriot i'd be having a feild day with all the filler possibilities.  Now when i read this question i immediately thought of the other jinchuriki (minus bee) Now hear me out. I love the jinchuriki mythos and everything and they should have each had a canon arc like kakashi gaiden IMO. But in terms of OP's question. They were pretty useless by how kishi used them. He gave them virtually no screen time. So then why did we need them? The only use that i can think of having them be jins instead of just the beasts is that when obitio is using them to fight naruto/bee/kakashi/gai is that he can only control two tailed beasts at a single time.  I love all the jins. It is literally at the top of my naruto wishlist that each of them got their own canon gaiden.  But with the way kishi used them in his series, i think the qualify as pretty much usless. They serve almost no extra purposes that the tailed beasts themselves couldn't have fulfilled."

This guy seemed to be so fucking OP!! When Danzo fought against Sasuke, he even didnt used Shisui's eye aganst him, because he wanted to safe it against ""Madara"". I mean how strong was only one eye of shisui? Now imagine a Shisui with both of his eyes in an allout fight... He was the best friend of my favourite character in the show (Itachi), who is arguably the definition of being badass; now imagine the person that is admired by the defintion of being badass!    In the Hokage summit everyone was literally shocked when they heard that Danzo has Shisui's eye! I mean ALL this hype and we literally got nothing about Shisui Uchiha.

Her inclusion because Kishi couldn't think of a way to adequately kill off Madara is one of the things that will bother me most when looking back on the series. There's no reason Naruto and Sasuke couldn't have got their god powers, teamed up to beat Madara's ass (which they basically were already doing before the last minute kill steal by the scrub black zetsu), and then Sasuke pulled his whole betrayal bit as planned."

Naruto,3drbcn,Dsahld,2,Sun Jul 19 00:39:33 2015 UTC,"First off, I HIGHLY recommend not coming to this sub until you catch up with the episodes because this sub is filled with spoilers... Anyways, begin with the original episodes before shippuden of course. It's a story, always begin where the story begins. However skip those 70 episodes of suicidal fillers. You'll be hooked on the show in a few episodes."

Also the shoulder posturing is kind of weird, as specially for the character. But what I really like is the skin shading, it's subtle enough to really add some definition to the face.

Naruto,3dog4k,AzeiteGalo,17,Fri Jul 17 23:04:40 2015 UTC,/r/anime in particular has a strong dislike for mainstream shounen (like Naruto). The fillers and crappy animation get added on top of that...and you get one of the most disliked shows on that subreddit.

Naruto,3dog4k,sawada91,3,Sun Jul 19 08:18:04 2015 UTC,"Hmm... Just why the big 3 was seen as the big 3? Well I don't know for sure. One piece, Naruto and One piece became the most popular shows after Dragon ball finished. They weren't always the top 3, and in Japan, One Piece was the undisputed number one, while Bleach and Naruto was a bit further down the list.   All three were shonen though. Each with hudereds upon hundereds of episodes, and although Bleach and Naruto was only moderately popular in Japan, they were far more popular in the west. That led to 3 very popular shows that showed no sign of ending, and subsequently stayed at the top. Ergo, the big 3. While other, smaller series would pass them by from time to time, these three just did not end, and they stayed in the lead throughout their entire run.  Bu that's just a theory. A GAME TH... no. I'm sorry."
Naruto,3dog4k,Caliburn0,3,Sun Jul 19 09:36:39 2015 UTC,How is the most popular manga year after year not mainstream?
Naruto,3dog4k,Dovahking94,2,Sat Jul 18 16:40:29 2015 UTC,"It is mainstream... but... not? I don't really know how to explain it. It's very popular, but still quite unique in terms of shonen and Anime in general. It feels more like a niche product, rather than this huge series with hundreds of thousands of followers... if that made any sense...?"
Naruto,3dog4k,Caliburn0,3,Sat Jul 18 17:02:03 2015 UTC,Not really.
Naruto,3dog4k,Dovahking94,2,Sat Jul 18 17:28:00 2015 UTC,Well... I don't know how to explain it better. That's how it feels like for me at least.
Naruto,3dog4k,Caliburn0,-2,Sat Jul 18 18:56:53 2015 UTC,"It's because you don't know what ""mainstream"" means and through an implicit understanding of the concept try to convey opinions that are just wrong."

Naruto,3dog4k,Caliburn0,2,Sun Jul 19 02:56:31 2015 UTC,"I'm not really sure why. It isn't like it's the only thing they have to watch. Now, if those people wanted low quality, all they have to do is turn the TV to Bravo, E! or MTV. There's your low quality high profit shit right there."
Naruto,3dog4k,kaito0,2,Sat Jul 18 05:11:41 2015 UTC,Off-topic: I'm going to guess that you're a HxH fan? Your username points towards it.
Naruto,3dog4k,xTurK,7,Sat Jul 18 10:22:01 2015 UTC,"I like Naruto's animation. Is it bad at times? Yes, but sometimes It's really good. There's a scene in Shippuden where Naruto smiles, I absolutely loved that animation and then there's times like Obito vs Kakashi."
Naruto,3dog4k,Yosonimbored,7,Sat Jul 18 05:13:55 2015 UTC,Ye sure. Kakashi vs Obito was really great but what's up with the rest? Of course there's good animation scenes but there's a lot more shitty ones. Just compare Pierrot with a good studio like Madhouse and what they did with HxH. That's top notch animation consistent throughout the whole anime.
Naruto,3dog4k,AzeiteGalo,2,Sat Jul 18 13:04:47 2015 UTC,"That's true, but I thought that Naruto was even disliked in manga communities, such as /r/manga?"
Naruto,3dog4k,xTurK,2,Sat Jul 18 10:25:12 2015 UTC,"Yeah, a lot of people thought that the Naruto manga took a huge dip quality-wise, sometime during the War arc and there are a decent number of people who think the ending was rushed. Not that I necessarily agree with that, that's just what I've seen."
Naruto,3dog4k,PM_ME_ROCK_LEE_PICS,66,Sun Jul 19 01:08:25 2015 UTC,"Blame studio perrot. Yeah I feel for the animators but this is just ridiculous.  The gross overuse of flashbacks, buffer, an tons upon tons of filler (for no reason) have effectively turned so many off the anime. Hell, I'd just say fuck this shit and come back a year later to catch up and skip/fast forward the bullshit."
Naruto,3dog4k,muffinmonk,20,Fri Jul 17 23:03:03 2015 UTC,I think this is your best answer. This anime is a terrible one to follow week by week. Way too much padding and terrible filler.   I recently caught up with the anime at the point where A and Tsunade block Naruto's path. I stopped watching and will only continue when the anime is over.
Naruto,3dog4k,ZacUAX,5,Sat Jul 18 01:42:54 2015 UTC,don't forget the constant breaks after filler.
Naruto,3dog4k,Iron_Tits,3,Sat Jul 18 09:24:55 2015 UTC,"Keep in mind that this show is intended as a advertisement-with-bonus for Shonen Jump; it is a 20-minute commercial, not a separate work, a la Fruits Basket or 2003's Full Metal Alchemist.   If these things are kept in mind when discussing weekly adaptations, far less confusion and misconception will be spread about this show, inevitable as those are, being aimed at children, and of course, partially due to comics not being as popular or well-advertised in  North America or Europe than they are in Japan."
Naruto,3dog4k,huzaifa96,5,Sat Jul 18 13:44:33 2015 UTC,"yeah I never understood all of the random fillers, they happen in various amounts and at various (and random) times -- sometimes right in the middle of important and epic parts of the series.   also the flashbacks are ridiculous, I think I've seen that flashback where Itachi says ""foolish little brother"" (as well as most of the rest of that episode) at least 12-13 times in different episodes hundreds of episodes ahead in Shippuden. Its to the point where its completely unnecessary. I don't understand why they feel it's necessary to add so many flashbacks, as most of the time they're in the way and don't do much of anything for me.   I'd think the buffer was depending on the player you use to watch online... unless you mean some other form of buffer. But yeah I can see why most people hate on this anime series and for that reason I don't try and get them to change their mind, however I love Shippuden and it kinda sucks that the series will be over at some point soon. :("
Naruto,3dog4k,unalert,5,Sat Jul 18 07:05:32 2015 UTC,"Buffer is canon filler. Last episode had might dai, but the buffer was kakashi being in it too. Sometimes it makes sense and is pretty neat to see elaboration but it's still a waste of time."
Naruto,3dog4k,muffinmonk,1 point,Sat Jul 18 07:09:09 2015 UTC,I thought buffer was when they replay events that happened last episode?
Naruto,3dog4k,timholmescorporation,2,Sat Jul 18 16:52:26 2015 UTC,"For both Naruto and One Piece I've had this problem, and both times I stopped watching the anime in favor of the manga.  I'm waiting for the same response to happen eventually in the One Piece community.  After the time skip, pacing just seemed to get so much worse.  It's unwatchable for me at this point."
Naruto,3dog4k,Spiderdan,13,Sat Jul 18 07:06:28 2015 UTC,The larger the exposure the more people who hate it or at least criticize it.
Naruto,3dog4k,curlyfreak,21,Sat Jul 18 03:28:20 2015 UTC,"Naruto, LeBron, & Call of Duty are like the 3 most hated things on the internet. But regardless all 3 are great."
Naruto,3dog4k,KDW3,16,Sat Jul 18 03:58:35 2015 UTC,"I think it's because it's become such a huge sensation, it's sort of ""mainstream"" in some opinions to like Naruto now. Some of the reason is probably the anime adaptation. I don't know if I've heard anyone say they actually hate it, but there's often complaints of it dragging on too long, becoming too big, and it just being overrated. Can't win everybody, unfortunately."

Naruto,3dog4k,Thr0s,3,Sat Jul 18 11:38:31 2015 UTC,I wouldn't say it's generic or unoriginal but the pacing is terrible and the animation quality is pretty bad. Each episode feels so damn slow.
Naruto,3dog4k,tw04,3,Sat Jul 18 05:36:56 2015 UTC,"In my personal view its because Studio Perrot is such a washy animation studio, the animation jumps when it really shouldn't, scenes like the Fight with Pain and Six Tails Naruto turned me off the anime for the second time, while the filler and padding just made it harder to care. I still love the games and I finished the manga but the Anime is cancer to me"

Naruto,3dog4k,Yosonimbored,2,Sat Jul 18 05:15:53 2015 UTC,"it is either because of Naruto being the face of mainstream anime and people love to hate mainstream stuff for hipster-ism reason OR because the true nature of Naruto anime, badly animated, filler filled, and overused flashback, unless you're a true hard fan, who wants to watch that kind of anime?"
Naruto,3dog4k,suckthisanimation,2,Sat Jul 18 06:30:30 2015 UTC,"The Anime has become what's bad with popular anime, crappy fillers, constant flashbacks, the blatant milking that goes on kills the anime.

Naruto,3dog4k,Crisis7,2,Sat Jul 18 09:20:55 2015 UTC,"The people in this thread who are saying it's due to the popularity are the ones who have it right. You won't see as much hate leveled at series in the same genre, but with worse writing, like Fairy Tale. Meanwhile, you'll find similar levels of hate towards other popular, mainstream series like SAO and Shingeki no Kyojin, which only share a demographic with Naruto.  Basically, the more popular something is, the more cringeworthy its fans are. Most anime fans don't want to be associated with socially-stunted 15-year-olds writing fanfics about ""Steve the Hedgehog""."

Naruto,3dog4k,madaster97,2,Sat Jul 18 13:43:48 2015 UTC,"I used to love the Naruto Anime, it was actually one of the first Anime's that I watched subbed. The reason I stopped wathcing it was because Naruto had a shitton of filler content.  It started before Shippuden came out, when the story arc was getting Sasuke back from Orochimaru. I can't even count how many filler arcs they had and to me the quality became poorer and poorer. Very lifeless animations and the drawing became rather dull, especially compared to the Manga.  I think a lot of Naruto fans felt ripped off, as if the studio tried milking the cow, which they did.   There's also hate because the story stagnated a lot at some point and eventually became quite boring, the Ninja War certainly was. Also, the Sharingan just became ridiculously powerful, it was like every 100 chapters ""Hey guess what, it has an additional power that we didn't know about!"""
Naruto,3dog4k,SkimGaming,1 point,Sat Jul 18 14:39:34 2015 UTC,"Yea the Sharingan powers was lest part, there was a new power revealed in every other arc and in the last arc there were like 3 new powers. Other than that, the series didn't have many other ridiculous power ups."

Just a few weeks break here and there. I recently just started watching the anime again and what do you know? TONS OF FILLER. Got back to 1.5 canon episodes and then the next half of the episode was fucking filler. And now it's a Gai flashback. Fuck."
Naruto,3dog4k,Unclehouse2,3,Sat Jul 18 03:23:45 2015 UTC,"""Naruto is a gateway anime of the worst kind. It's a bad series, a clusterfuck of story and characterization that isn't very well done by any aspect, but which attempts to compensate for its weaknesses by adding in excessive shipping faggotry and DARKNESS. The normal anon can see this as the shit it is, and may enjoy it, hate it or be indifferent to it, but all the while recognizing that the series itself, regardless of their opinion, is plain bad.  However, these very aspects that try to smear over the shit of its core make it a breeding ground for aspie, unsociable underageb& faggots who engage in every kind of faggotry both online and in the real world. The superpowered characters all trying their hardest to look cool, the jutsus, peculiar, colorful clothes, the whole ninja faggotry and everything about the Naruto world fuels their escapist fantasies, while the pity-party character backgrounds, emphasis on revenge, and overall preachiness of the series make it fit just right with the mary-sueish drives of your average preteen and his sense of unwarranted self-importance towards the world. Exactly the kind of shit that makes little kiddies and underageb& retards eat this shit right the fuck up.  Naruto is basically THE series to attract the most hated anime fanbase known to /a/, which is why, regardless of individual opinions, it is the responsibility of every anon to troll the fuck out of this show and everyone who likes it, and ensure that no Naruto threads ever encourage the newfriends to show their faces here.""  So in short, it's the writing, the (admittedly at times spergy and childish) fanbase and its 'mainstreamness'. But the people in /a/ are arrogant contrarians who hate everything that's popular anyways."

Naruto,3dog4k,tipytop,1 point,Sat Jul 18 13:13:07 2015 UTC,"I think people hate it just because it's mainstream. I have a friend that always says something like ""It's a shonen made for 15 years old kids, so i'm not going to watch it"". Just like SAO or SNK. People will always hate things without knowing anything about them.  Oh, and don't forget fillers. People usually don't read manga, so they want the anime to cover the chapters as soon as possible. naruto has fillers (and nice filler arcs, like the ANBU or the Rokubi arcs), so people hate it. And i'll never understand why people like the One Piece anime. It's way worse in my opinion. The pace is killing everything (we wait a week to see useless episodes with random dialogues or opisodes wher we hear a snail ringing for 10 minutes) and the animation is terrible."

Yu Yu hakusho, DBZ, kenshin were the shit, but I finished them and i needed something else. at this point One piece was done by 4kids and was utter shit on american television. Naruto started and started great. it felt similar to DBZ but the fights were smaller, more focused and felt more dangerous.  but Naruto became a mess post time skip. in the minds of myself and many on reddit and elsewhere. their is a feeling that Naruto as a manga didn't achieve its potential. it started off creating the outline for an incredibly interesting world and then never really expanded on it. we didn't see the other nations, the other kages or the other jinchurikki until the end of the series. and really there isn't much foreshadowing for any of it, it almost seems like Kishimoto planned for a shorter series, then extended it after it became a hit.   also Naruto's villains were lacking, and the story repeated the same process (once again I LOVED this show, i admit this that I actually still read fanfiction of naruto, its embarrassing but i love the world) but the villains were just repeats of each other. first major villain Zabuza and Haku, really interesting. morally grey villain trying to acheive his own goal, not really a bad guy. then we get orichimaru, absolutely evil, great villain. then it starts to repeat. Itachi, secretly good. Nagato, misled, secretly good. Obito (should have stayed dead) misled, secretly good. Orichimaru, ""lol kk I'll behave guys"". Sasuke, i'm good, i'm bad, i'm good, no i'm bad, no i'm good. you can only pull that card so many times, and Kishi over used the trope.  and I don't want to inflame people here, but the fanbase. the fanbase can be really, really rabid. people talk about Naruto as if its one of the greatest animated series of all time, I'm sorry its not. objectively it is not. is it fun? yea. is it good? yea. but its not FMA, its not Yu Yu hakusho, or kenshin. its silly fun like DBZ. but the fanbase gets really defensive about the show. anytime someone has a complaint I see comments trying to explain it by using the very thing the person is complaining about.   ok so TLDR:  failure to live up to potential, didn't explore the interesting world it started to build, deus ex machina abuse, villain --- good guy over use. lack of character development. and the fanbase can be defensive and rabid"

Flood myths are commom to all cultures for example , the good and evil dicotomy is also commom .... the 2 brother myth is also commom in a lot of cultures as a representation of the dicotomy of human nature ...."
Naruto,3dqpjs,no_tourist,4,Sat Jul 18 15:15:59 2015 UTC,I'm sure it's pretty racist to call all Arabs stupid (also the fact you had spelt massacre kinda weakens your footing). Also I did like the idea until you mixed both religious ideas with relatively recent incidence (holocaust) and I doubt that Kishimoto would base a major occurrence in the story on the holocaust.

Naruto,3dndz7,SoddenEye,1 point,Sat Jul 18 04:24:03 2015 UTC,It would be interesting to see different writers creating a single story and the writers would write for different characters changing the perspective of the story. If it  was set during the pre-nation war and told from clan leaders it would be cool and inconsistencies in the different stories would make some sense. This could never happen though.

They're really making the rest of us who accept the ending as it is look bad.  It's not like we're going to change it. This is obviously what Kishimoto is going to stick by. You might as well move on with your life, and if you genuinely hate it so much you won't shut up about it, find something else you enjoy. There are so many anime out there, it's ridiculous."

Naruto,3dmi5n,Kilshaw12,8,Fri Jul 17 13:56:38 2015 UTC,"Hi there!  Most of the movies aren't canon and you can watch them after catching up with the series, although they do roughly fit into the Naruto timeline. Note the last two movies: ""The Last - Naruto the Movie"" and Spoiler contain spoilers about events not yet covered in the anime.  I've been looking around on-line and here is what the general consensus is regarding the timeline placement of the movies.  Part 1   Clash in the Land of Snow - after episode 101 Legend of the Stone of Gelel - after episode 160 Guardians of the Crescent Moon Kingdom - after episode 196   Shippuden   Naruto Shippūden the Movie - after episode 53 Naruto Shippuden the Movie: Bonds - after episode 111 Naruto Shippuden The Movie: Inheritors of the Will of Fire - after episode 121 Naruto Shippuden the Movie: The Lost Tower - after episode 143 Naruto the Movie: Blood Prison - after episode 221 (apparently doesn't matter due to plot inconsistencies.) Road to Ninja: Naruto the Movie - after episode 271 The Last - Naruto the Movie - This is based between chapters 699 and 700 of the manga.   That's roughly the placement of the movies within the Naruto timeline. Be sure to start on Part 1! (Shouldn't have to say it but I see too many people accidentally start on Shippuden). Here is a filler guide for Part 1 and Part 2 if you ever feel the need to skip them. If you need a place to watch them, I would recommend kissanime.com.   Also, try to avoid this sub-reddit due to massive amounts of spoilers regarding the anime and manga. Most importantly, enjoy! It's such a great story, never too late to join. :)"

Naruto,3dmi5n,izn1337,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:39:31 2015 UTC,I recently posted this for certain someone: https://www.reddit.com/r/Naruto/comments/3dk0dp/ok_im_hooked/ct6ey52
Naruto,3dl4o4,PakiIronman,19,Fri Jul 17 03:48:35 2015 UTC,I think every little moment of Sasuke being 'nice' was the reason. I have to admit that when Sasuke shows emotions it has greater impact than when other people do so I can't blame Sakura (nor Naruto) for liking him. But I may be delusional ¯_(ツ)_/¯  And Kishi doesn't care for long time so it's nothing shocking
Naruto,3dl4o4,ohnoyouwont,12,Fri Jul 17 06:51:48 2015 UTC,"I understand your point and it is true. Tone matters. Stoic characters showing emotion is often very pleasing. Emotional characters getting stoic and/or cold is often poignant. Case in point, Ron Swanson in the last season of Parks and Recreation goes from the very stoic and private person to a person who actually was willing to change jobs to be with his friends. It was really sweet.  Buuuuuuut... And I don't really mean this as an insult towards Sasuke... What you described also sounds eerily like a relationship with domestic violence.. The victim stays in the abusive relationship because for all the pain and suffering she goes through, her significant other's caring side is becoming addicting. But this is shonen... I doubt Kishi was trying to make points like that, it was more of a ""friends forever!""."
Naruto,3dl4o4,jonske94,8,Fri Jul 17 09:16:07 2015 UTC,"Yes, this is true. And your last sentence is the key. This is shounen and characters are written in that way that their emotions and changes are sincere.  After those changes their not turning back to their worse selves. This the difference between real people and fictional characters (in that case manga ones) that's why I often say comparing Naruto universe and our real world is pointless"
Naruto,3dl4o4,ohnoyouwont,2,Fri Jul 17 10:26:28 2015 UTC,"Excactly. It's fairly ridiculous to use real-life standards for fictional characters. Of course this fluctuates. Talking how ""realistic"" a fictional character in a manga like Naruto is just plain stupid but talking how realistic a character is in a show like Breaking Bad is not nearly as stupid."
Naruto,3dl4o4,jonske94,2,Fri Jul 17 11:42:54 2015 UTC,"Absolutely. I mostly meant media for teenagers when I said about non-realistic fictional characters, like in anime, manga, cartoons, some books and movies. Breaking Bad is actually good example how some characters can be realistic. But the show is on totally different level than Naruto manga not only because of the genres but also production and writing process."
Naruto,3dl4o4,ohnoyouwont,19,Fri Jul 17 14:13:13 2015 UTC,"Eh, I'm not so sure he's dissing the pairing and characters as much as laughing about how not so well he built up their relationship romantically."
Naruto,3dl4o4,irishsaltytuna,2,Fri Jul 17 07:47:16 2015 UTC,The real question is why the hell would Sasuke like her back??? I think Sasuke has a little bit of the settle-itis.
Naruto,3dl4o4,wktay,7,Sun Jul 19 09:55:11 2015 UTC,"In another interview, Kishimoto was asked why he didn't show Sakura's family or background, and Kishimoto replies that he didn't bother since she's not a popular character. Which is absurdly circular reasoning. She's not popular because she doesn't have a backstory. She doesn't have a backstory because she isn't popular.  Then, in that same interview no less Kishimoto wonders why Sakura isn't more popular, despite his attempts to draw her prettier, when the first thing Kishimoto did to try to make, say, Nagato/Kabuto/Obito sympathetic was have them vomit out their tragic biography to Naruto down to the last dead puppy.  In interviews Kishimoto talks about Sakura like she's some roommate he's stuck with, not a character he has absolute creative control over."
Naruto,3dl4o4,garrison105,3,Fri Jul 17 12:40:18 2015 UTC,"I think I've read that Sakura was added in by editorial mandate. I could be wrong on that, though."
Naruto,3dl4o4,hunterbelmont,8,Fri Jul 17 15:44:49 2015 UTC,Sasuke was. IIRC the editor told him that a rival for Naruto would make it more interesting for the readers.

But for whatever reason I think it's gonna be canon""."
Naruto,3dl4o4,HokageEzio,9,Fri Jul 17 04:35:38 2015 UTC,"I expected it just as much as Naruhina.  I didn't care to cheer for anything, I just went with the flow."

Naruto,3dl4o4,lonehawk2k4,10,Fri Jul 17 12:26:24 2015 UTC,sometimes love is just plain crazy.  like how the hell did she still end up with sasuke when she gave that fake smile to sai when he asked her if she actually trusted him.  if anything she landed sasuke the same way leonard from big bang theory got penny as sheldon described as constant persistence no matter how sad the attempt that eventually wore the target down.

Naruto,3dl4o4,Team7isBack,3,Fri Jul 17 10:34:56 2015 UTC,"I think it's more about how making a story like the Last for her would feel forced, the Last did.  IMO, it was explained pretty well in the manga, being admiration and later fangirling originally.     Also, why are so many people taking this out of context? Kishimoto didn't say anything negative lol. XD   And please include the translators notes next time, Japanese may sound different when translated into English. :)"

Naruto,3dl4o4,KDW3,-8,Fri Jul 17 13:20:16 2015 UTC,Can't believe he actually said this. He just finished Sakura's character for good. It's kinda weird that he assumed the guy liked Hinata for her breasts as well. Goes to show how much he actually cares for his female characters.

Naruto,3dne8g,916expat,9,Fri Jul 17 18:05:04 2015 UTC,"Will people still be reading/watching Naruto in 2034?   Yes. Because the studios will have continued to make remakes, spinoffs, merchandise. And they will run reruns or do ""kai"" like with DBZ. Naruto is not over until each of the Konoha 11 get their own anime. Or until Kishimoto dies.   Joking aside, a new anime is being added to the DB universe this year. Pokemon continues to thrive. Naruto will remain for a long time."

Naruto,3dmzt3,ImAnAppleBiteMe,2,Sat Jul 18 02:30:11 2015 UTC,"The only made up answer I can think of is that it's due to the whole clan thing. There are a bunch of Nara's running around in close proximity probably even in the same team on some missions.. So calling shikamaru ""Nara-kun"" or something would be confusing. However, when you say sarutobi sensei everyone assumes you are referring to THE sarutobi-sensei that runs the village.   This doesn't apply to Sakura tho, since she isn't a part of a ninja clan in my head.  A better example would have definitely been hyuuga, but it's too late now."

Naruto,3dmzt3,Aaroniero,5,Fri Jul 17 17:36:54 2015 UTC,"They probably call him ""Saru"" because of his monkey summon. If I recall correctly, ""saru"" means ""monkey"". So the Saru nickname might refer to that."
Naruto,3dmzt3,Feline_Felix,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:25:54 2015 UTC,"Some trivia: Sarutobi is based loosely off of the monkey god, Sun Wukong, from ""Journey to the West"" too and his weapon is also a staff. Sarutobi also has quite a short stature compared to most other people, bears a striking resemblance to the character in his battle gear, and also summons a monkey for battle."
Naruto,3dlswn,walta_,23,Fri Jul 17 08:41:18 2015 UTC,Itachi didnt knew Kakashi and Tobi were somehow connected .
Naruto,3dlswn,Thatguy69Kappa,6,Fri Jul 17 08:52:34 2015 UTC,"This is the most likely. Itachi didn't know Tobi was really Obito Uchiha, Kakashi's former teammate. If he did he would have made that connection and probably would have allowed for it in his plans."
Naruto,3dlswn,kaito0,6,Fri Jul 17 16:38:09 2015 UTC,I agree Itachi didnt mess with Obito in Akatsuki only because he though he was Madara and figured his chances were slim to win . If he knew I could see Itachi making a plan like Konans to take him down and actually being able to .
Naruto,3dlswn,Thatguy69Kappa,2,Fri Jul 17 16:46:13 2015 UTC,Would they have to be connected at all? All that was explained was that the amaterasu would activate as soon as a sharingan was shown to sasuke. Not even a mangekyo was necessary.
Naruto,3dlswn,Thatguy69Kappa,9,Fri Jul 17 09:19:07 2015 UTC,No amaterasu would activate as soon as Obitos sharingan was seen . Tobi said  that after he got hit with it .
Naruto,3dlswn,HokageEzio,8,Fri Jul 17 09:33:56 2015 UTC,"My theory is it only activated when the right eye was seen, not the left.  If not, than yeah, Kakashi would be blacker than Zetsu."
Naruto,3dlswn,tlh053,1 point,Fri Jul 17 13:40:06 2015 UTC,I guess itachi would have to know what Tobi's other sharingan looked like to have it respond to that one too.  And it was only made to react to Tobi's sharingan.
Naruto,3dlswn,-Obito-,1 point,Fri Jul 17 12:23:01 2015 UTC,"LOL never thought of this. Indeed, it would have been awesome to see.  However, I wonder how Itachi did to sync Sasuke's eye to Obito's, since he didn't know Tobi was Obito, he tought it was Madara."
Naruto,3dlswn,k-tax,-2,Fri Jul 17 22:19:34 2015 UTC,"But Itachi sealed the Amaterasu in his eyes, his own. The reason is: when Sasuke gets them transplanted to replace his own eyes, the eye would ""automatically"" attack Tobi, because it was obvious, that if Sasuke gets Itachi's eyes transplanted, Tobi would do it."
Naruto,3dlswn,Milko3399,11,Fri Jul 17 08:53:55 2015 UTC,But Sasuke didn't receive Itachi's eyes until way later after itachi's sealed amaterasu was already activated and after he defeated Danzo. I'm not entirely sure I understood your comment.

Naruto,3dlswn,Milko3399,0,Sat Jul 18 03:05:17 2015 UTC,"if so, mea culpa. I was sure the chain of events was like this: -> Sasuke fights Itachi -> Itachi dies -> Sasuke talks with Tobi -> Sasuke goes around doing stuff -> Sasuke decides he wants a transplant -> After transplant, Sasuke's eyes attack Tobi.  If it was different, then I guess Itachi had sealed Amaterasu when he tapped Sasuke's forehead, right?   Why did nobody just tell me I got it all wong ;_;"
Naruto,3dlswn,Sherlock_87,1 point,Sun Jul 19 10:01:27 2015 UTC,"Yep, he sealed it when he tapped his forehead. During the ""Sasuke talks with Tobi"" scenario, Sasuke's eyes attack Tobi"

Naruto,3dk0dp,Goairsky,4,Fri Jul 17 15:44:29 2015 UTC,"That's pretty cool to hear, it will get more and more hooking :). Here I've pointed few things which you'll need know about.     Stay off this subreddit, Naruto wiki, or any other Naruto related stuff until you've reached the last episode of the anime. Also, do avoid spoiler posts of the subreddit if you are just an anime-only watcher.   If you're watching Naruto in English dubbed, I'd recommend start watching the series in Japanese dub with English sub because that's way better, you'll enjoy the best of Naruto. Plus, English dubbed episodes are still far from where Japanese episodes are, so it's better if you starting watching in sub from sites like KissAnime, NaruSpot, and many other sites. It's also available on Crunchyroll in HQ which is only available for premium members.   The anime consists of many filler episodes, you should follow the filler list next time so that you won't have to watch fillers. Since fillers are not a part of the main story, you can simply skip them or watch them or totally watch them later? It still wouldn't affect the story. There are also ""mostly filler"" and ""mostly canon"" episodes, you can avoid ""mostly filler"" episodes since they're covered in the next episode. Do watch episode 101 though of Naruto Part I, it's fun. Naruto (Part I) Filler List Naruto Shippuden (Part II) Filler List   If there's something which is bugging you, like the episode details, or you wanted to read the specific manga for that episode, you can simply check this from the website I've linked below. List of all episodes with their info (Part I and II)   You must've known about Naruto and Naruto Shippuden movies, since they're not canon, doesn't fits so you can simply skip them if you want, or else watch them later just like I said about filler episodes. If you want to watch them in order, check this list out posted by /u/IdRatherBeLurking NOTE: ""The Last: Naruto the Movie"" and upcoming movie ""Boruto: Naruto the Movie"" are canon movies which needs to be watched after you've completed watching the anime AND also completed reading manga since manga has ended already and anime is still like 42 chapters behind)   If you'd like to read manga, you can read it from KissManga since they've mirrored Manga Stream scanlations (which are way better than MangaPanda's). The original manga is Naruto, anime divided same manga into two parts so don't worry there isn't like Part II of the manga, but there's a side story manga written by the same author Masashi Kishimoto named Naruto Gaiden (DON'T OPEN THE LINK BECAUSE MASSIVE SPOILERS AHEAD) which is like an epilogue, aftermath of the original series, which is like 10 chapters in total. Don't even dare to open this chapter since the full title of this manga has a massive spoiler. There's a group called Colorkage here who were exclusively coloring chapters 605+ (few chapters are missing here and there tho), you can read them here if you'd like to but again, you're not even close to those chapters, so just avoid opening the link."

Naruto,3dk0dp,Omega_Warrior,2,Fri Jul 17 10:37:08 2015 UTC,"Stay off of this subreddit for a long time.  You have been warned.  Simply seeing a name in the title will prove that the person probably isn't dead and will ruin any fights they have in the future for you, because you know they won't die.  You should really just stay out of here until the series ends or you read the rest of the manga."
Naruto,3dk0dp,DTakatsuki,2,Fri Jul 17 14:30:54 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't visit this subreddit too much as long as you didn't watch the latest animation and mangas. There's much cool shit waiting for you, don't ruin that by accidentally getting spoilered.  AND YAY KAKASHI o(≧▽≦)o"
Naruto,3dk0dp,lilkarenm321,2,Fri Jul 17 00:29:19 2015 UTC,"Dude, biggest thing I can say is skip the fillers!  I was so young when I started watching and didn't know what fillers were, now that I know, I would like to pass that knowledge onto you.  Skip them man!"

Naruto,3dk0dp,ownage516,2,Thu Jul 16 23:30:09 2015 UTC,Yeah. I googled a watch order list. I'm fucked. I told myself I'd finish the SOIAF books this summer but watching this is easier. Haha.
Naruto,3dk0dp,StrawberryF2,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:37:41 2015 UTC,You can do it! I got my boyfriend to start watching Naruto from the beginning in December. It is now July and I can say that we are about 40 episodes away from the current episodes!
Naruto,3dk0dp,jsgray345,1 point,Fri Jul 17 00:13:10 2015 UTC,If you are Canadian you will be disappointed the show cuts off about 150 episodes in. I don't even know where to start looking for the rest.
Naruto,3dk0dp,Tavros69,3,Fri Jul 17 14:02:59 2015 UTC,"By episode 150, that should be it for the canon Naruto part 1. Unless you're interested in the fillers, you can go straight to Shippuden"
Naruto,3dk0dp,jsgray345,1 point,Fri Jul 17 00:26:59 2015 UTC,"I am not too sure what you mean by fillers, but it cuts off during a fight and would seem wrong to end it there. I want to consume everything Naruto. Are there more to be found or is that the end of the english dubbed episodes?"
Naruto,3dk0dp,Coinkidinks,2,Fri Jul 17 04:36:07 2015 UTC,"The anime is an adaptation of the manga, so the manga is the source material. Any content in the anime that was also in the manga is considered canon. During the time, the manga and the anime were ongoing weekly, but the anime would cover more material in one episode than the manga would in one chapter. So to make sure the anime didn't catch up to the manga and they'd sit there for months waiting for new content, the anime team would create their own arcs and stories to stall until the manga got further ahead before resuming canon episodes. These non-canon episodes are known as filler. If you really want to watch EVERYTHING Naruto, then go ahead, but many dislike filler because they generally are weaker in animation, plot, and overall quality. Most are stand alones as well, as in they have nothing to do with the overall, original plot, but in Shippuden, they do make an effort to have the fillers related to the next canon arc. Googling ""Naruto episode __ english dub"" should be good enough to find the episodes you're looking for. The original Naruto series has 220 episodes and it is all dubbed"
Naruto,3dmlhi,Kalyb78,2,Fri Jul 17 14:24:50 2015 UTC,There is no episode this week due to a Pokemon special being aired in Naruto's timeslot. We are back on next week!

Naruto,3dgzso,InsaneZee,22,Fri Jul 17 04:10:32 2015 UTC,"That's not how it works.  The tag is for things not animated yet.  This was animated like, last year.  That makes it on you."
Naruto,3dgzso,HokageEzio,2,Thu Jul 16 10:53:39 2015 UTC,"Last year? Damn it, I know the whole deal about releasing one episode a week, but these guys have been a bit too filler happy."
Naruto,3dgzso,InsaneZee,1 point,Thu Jul 16 11:07:50 2015 UTC,Even without filler it was 8-9 months ago.
Naruto,3dgzso,Runefall,3,Thu Jul 16 15:22:32 2015 UTC,"I know I just checked. It just feels like nothing has... happened from that point yet. Until a while ago I guess, what, with the Madara stuff."
Naruto,3dgzso,BlueHundred,-29,Thu Jul 16 15:28:48 2015 UTC,That's not how it works at all. Anything in the series is a spoiler for some people.  :)
Naruto,3dgzso,HokageEzio,9,Thu Jul 16 15:31:49 2015 UTC,Do you recommend that we spoiler tag every post?
Naruto,3dgzso,Bloodshed101010,8,Thu Jul 16 12:10:22 2015 UTC,Jiraiya dies!!!  Spoilerz!!!
Naruto,3dgzso,BlueHundred,6,Thu Jul 16 12:34:22 2015 UTC,Naruto has a Fox demon inside him!!!!

Naruto,3dgzso,BlueHundred,5,Fri Jul 17 10:59:02 2015 UTC,Naruto is the main character if you didnt know  Should we also spoiler tag his name?
Naruto,3dgzso,Runefall,1 point,Thu Jul 16 12:47:19 2015 UTC,So what do you recommend?
Naruto,3dgzso,HokageEzio,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:48:55 2015 UTC,Nothing.
Naruto,3dgzso,Runefall,14,Fri Jul 17 10:59:37 2015 UTC,"It might be a spoiler for somebody, but that's not the rules we have to follow.  There's a difference between somebody who outright says ""I'm X far in the series"" and somebody randomly browsing that gets spoiled.   Use spoiler tags for anything that hasn't been revealed in the anime yet."
Naruto,3dgzso,HokageEzio,-20,Fri Jul 17 11:04:05 2015 UTC,"I know. Regardless, the truth is that it still is a spoiler for some people."
Naruto,3dgzso,Ultrahuntr,13,Thu Jul 16 12:12:58 2015 UTC,"If you know, than what's your point?  The rules are there, if you're not caught up it's on you.  That's how they're written, that's how I follow them.  Unless somebody says they're only so far in the series, I'm not gonna hold my tongue.  And nobody else should have to either.  They're following the rules."
Naruto,3dgzso,Who_Got_Dat_Loud,5,Thu Jul 16 12:47:10 2015 UTC,Preach.
Naruto,3dgzso,Runefall,3,Thu Jul 16 12:57:18 2015 UTC,Agreed I didn't even come into this sub until I was caught up in the anime and finished the manga.
Naruto,3dgzso,HokageEzio,-15,Thu Jul 16 13:00:16 2015 UTC,Which means that it's still a spoiler - it just doesn't get tagged.  :)
Naruto,3dgzso,Runefall,8,Thu Jul 16 15:13:20 2015 UTC,"It doesn't get tagged cause we don't have to.  Some people haven't seen the Wizard of Oz.  Does that mean I'm not gonna say there's a man behind the curtain?  No, go watch the movie. It's a spoiler, but it's your fault for not seeing it.    I'm not gonna spoiler tag that Naruto wants to become the fucking Hokage, just cause you haven't seen the first 5 minutes of the first episode.  If you go to a subreddit dedicated to talking about the most up to date topics, what else do you expect besides the most up to date topics?  Seriously..."
Naruto,3dgzso,Ultrahuntr,-19,Thu Jul 16 13:08:24 2015 UTC,"I never said it had to be tagged.  At this point, you're just complaining.  :)"
Naruto,3dgzso,Runefall,4,Thu Jul 16 13:11:40 2015 UTC,"You're just nitpicking though. Technically saying ""Naruto Sakura and Sasuke all end up in team 7 together"" is a spoiler to SOME people, but it'd be stupid to tag that as such."
Naruto,3dgzso,Ultrahuntr,-10,Thu Jul 16 13:12:18 2015 UTC,I never claimed that it was worth tagging.
Naruto,3dgzso,darkboyutz,3,Thu Jul 16 12:55:54 2015 UTC,Never said you did. It was just pointless to point out.
Naruto,3dgzso,Vekkuli,6,Thu Jul 16 13:07:58 2015 UTC,It's not like the episode was released over a year ago or anything.  Plus that's a link to a wikia page which is full of spoilers.
Naruto,3dgzso,chrisprudhomme,3,Thu Jul 16 13:10:22 2015 UTC,Anything that has happened in anime is not required to have spoiler tag. Then it's on you when you come to this subreddit.   We'd have to tag everything if we'd take in consideration all people.
Naruto,3dgzso,tb-talex,2,Thu Jul 16 11:10:00 2015 UTC,Then get off the sub and go watch the anime?

Naruto,3djm5g,turnip8961,24,Thu Jul 16 20:17:07 2015 UTC,"I love Kisame just because I could never make my self hate him . You cant blame him , he didnt have those complicated Danzo/Nagato motives that were for the greater good . He just had a fucked up life but was still kind of cheerful atleast for the freak show Akatsuki was . He didnt get held up by his past and pushed at what he believed in . And his death was amazing and one of the best deaths in the series without it needing to be that emotional more of a ""damn how do you not respect/like this guy "".  He was also bad ass ."
Naruto,3djm5g,Thatguy69Kappa,15,Thu Jul 16 20:49:55 2015 UTC,What's also fun about Kisame is that he's the one of the last people you'd expect to be among the last three surviving members of the Akatsuki.

Naruto,3djm5g,DoubleHunter,6,Fri Jul 17 07:33:01 2015 UTC,"I feel like he was overshadowed because he wasn't as gimmicky. Sasori had puppets, Hidan had immortality, Kakuzu had immortality puppets. Kisame just fucking killed people with his sword and some water jutsu."
Naruto,3djm5g,qwerto14,10,Fri Jul 17 08:07:22 2015 UTC,"I thought that manga cover of his death was perfect picture of him.  Made me realize that he was, in fact the perfect partner for Itachi.  Different attitudes, but the same strong shinobi beliefs to the death. One sits down, cool on the edge, while the other standing tall."
Naruto,3djm5g,ValleyofVino,3,Thu Jul 16 22:08:03 2015 UTC,Yeah that is true plus he always wrecked people like in movie 6 i like the quote he uses about grim wreaper chakra idk if thats a spoiler so thats all im saying
Naruto,3djm5g,Thatguy69Kappa,7,Thu Jul 16 20:53:11 2015 UTC,Im kinda sad we never saw him going all out . Versus Bee he wasnt trying to kill him and versus Gai he didnt have Samehada and wasnt at full power never the less still an awesome character .
Naruto,3djm5g,Shisui_1994,4,Thu Jul 16 21:05:58 2015 UTC,Yeah that is true but that was a good fight he put up anyway especially before he died
Naruto,3djm5g,tb-talex,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:14:47 2015 UTC,"I loved how jovial he always was at Akatsuki meetings, and he was arguably one of the most sadistic ones which is quite and that's saying something for a group like that."
Naruto,3djm5g,petru1745,17,Fri Jul 17 10:36:51 2015 UTC,"I liked Hidan. The Akatsuki were all pretty interesting characters, and Hidan, despite not having as much depth as probably any of the others, was hilarious, which helped me cope with Asuma's death."
Naruto,3djm5g,Hiratoshi,5,Thu Jul 16 20:37:59 2015 UTC,flair tho
Naruto,3djm5g,IamDoogieHauser,5,Thu Jul 16 22:14:45 2015 UTC,Like Tobi i like it when they have the funny characters
Naruto,3djm5g,Caliburn0,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:43:24 2015 UTC,"Mine's Hidan too! I feel like he didn't had much time/story compared to the other Akatsuki members. I would love to have a filler about him and Kakuzu before they joined the organisation, or just something with both of them 'cause it'll be hilarious. But yeah I think a sh*tty Chunin Exam is way better than knowing the story of some characters! :D"

Naruto,3djm5g,Caliburn0,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:20:02 2015 UTC,Yeah he was pretty good against kankuro he completely wrecked him
Naruto,3djm5g,Etealith,8,Thu Jul 16 23:12:23 2015 UTC,Orochimaru was cool.
Naruto,3djm5g,xgenoriginal,2,Thu Jul 16 21:22:14 2015 UTC,I was never the biggest orochimaru fan but everyone is entitled to their opinion :)
Naruto,3djm5g,Etealith,-1,Thu Jul 16 21:38:30 2015 UTC,"I agree with you. I find him vile and gross and kind of weak in comparison to our favorite characters, but I respect him and his thirst for knowledge."
Naruto,3djm5g,NaturaHigh,6,Thu Jul 16 22:06:36 2015 UTC,"If he hadn't lost his arms he would have had an army of immortal zombies. He has an army of unquestionably loyal soldiers. He is practically immortal, and knows an insane amount of techniques. All he needs is a strong body and enough chakra and he can play with the best of them."
Naruto,3djm5g,Caliburn0,2,Thu Jul 16 22:10:39 2015 UTC,"Yep. Don't forget he has neither the Sharingan nor is he a Senju or a Jinchuuriki. But imagine how strong he would be, if he succeeded in taking Sasukes body. Remember where Kabuto said he couldn't become a Sage because his body couldn't handle it? Well, with Sasukes body he could have. Imo he could then easily outpower Itachi and, given he would have access to Eternal Mangekyou after switching his eyes with Itachis, he could face even Madara/Hashirama(not that he couldn't resurrect them to fight for him)."
Naruto,3djm5g,NaturaHigh,2,Thu Jul 16 23:09:39 2015 UTC,Would he still have to switch out bodies over time or was saske the perfect host
Naruto,3djm5g,Caliburn0,1 point,Mon Jul 20 07:12:36 2015 UTC,"I think he would have to switch bodies, but he could just implant the Sharingan in the new ones, so it probably wouldn't be that bad."
Naruto,3djm5g,NaturaHigh,1 point,Mon Jul 20 10:47:26 2015 UTC,Too many ifs. How much higher would the other villains of the series rank with that many ifs.
Naruto,3djm5g,kundismack,1 point,Fri Jul 17 10:39:42 2015 UTC,"There is one if. A good body. With Sasuke and EM he would probably have reached Hashirama's and Madara's level. But all he needs to become really strong and a huge threat is a strong body, with or without Sasuke."
Naruto,3djm5g,NaturaHigh,1 point,Fri Jul 17 10:55:32 2015 UTC,"If he had sasuke's body, if he mastered a sage mode, if he unlocked all of sharingan's forms, if he hadn't lost his arms. And face it, he wasn't able to beat Sasuke during one of Sasuke's weakest stages."
Naruto,3djm5g,wbad123,2,Fri Jul 17 11:11:33 2015 UTC,"He doesn't need Sasuke. That road only leads to the strongest he can be. Not the only road possible for him.   If he had taken Yukimaru's body for instance. He would have a strong body with a tailed beasts chakra inside him. What could Orochimaru do with the power of a tailed beast?   Sage mode is also just outside his reach. You may see that as another if, but it really only depends on the body he has. Is it strong enough, or isn't it? A jinchuriki's body probably would be, although maybe not at first. He doesn't NEED the sharingan, he just really, really wants it."
Naruto,3djm5g,kundismack,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:04:49 2015 UTC,Sorry I didn't see your message because I'm on my phone and I loved it when Pain wrecked him without trying in the creation of the akatsuki thing
Naruto,3djm5g,LastOfTheDovahkiin,1 point,Fri Jul 17 10:00:29 2015 UTC,"To answer your question: Pain is probably my favorite villain. He's showed intelligence, great powers (which just happen to be the kind I'm a fan of) and his reason for becoming a villain is something I can respect.  I really like Itachi, too, but I can't consider him a villain any more.  Obito, has been really cool in general (in all his appearances), but his reasons for turning evil are a bit... anticlimactic.  Madara has good style, but I feel like all he has is brute force and very little intelligence. Whenever he succeeded was because he was just overwhelmingly powerful and not because he gave things much thought. This is my opinion.  tl;dr - Pain FTW"
Naruto,3djm5g,DoubleHunter,1 point,Fri Jul 17 10:35:27 2015 UTC,Yes Pain FTW and a villain or enemy is not necessarily a evil person they are just someone who has a conflict with the main character e.g. Pain he was not evil his intentions were good
Naruto,3djm5g,DoubleHunter,6,Fri Jul 17 11:43:12 2015 UTC,I'd have to say Pain. There was so much build up to that fight afterSpoilers   Edit: Added spoiler tag.
Naruto,3djm5g,walta_,2,Thu Jul 16 22:12:28 2015 UTC,Add me to the Pain Train!
Naruto,3djm5g,walta_,3,Fri Jul 17 10:41:32 2015 UTC,"Pain was also the strongest character at the time, so he seemed unkillable. Also he wasn't some impenetrable OP character like Madara."
Naruto,3djm5g,theresacakeinmyboots,4,Thu Jul 16 22:16:56 2015 UTC,Naruto's fight with Pain didn't drag on either and there was at least some strategy involved in it. As opposed to just random nonsense with Madara.
Naruto,3djm5g,AllOfEverythingEver,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:18:20 2015 UTC,Why did you need a spoiler tag?
Naruto,3djm5g,eg5cue,-1,Fri Jul 17 10:25:47 2015 UTC,Yeah pain is by far my favorite enemy he wrecks everyone and makes orchimaru look like nothing when he is meant to be a tough
Naruto,3djm5g,wbad123,5,Thu Jul 16 23:15:01 2015 UTC,"Danzo, but if separating Pain and Nagato is allowed then I pick Pain.  I also like Kisame and Kakuzu."
Naruto,3djm5g,wbad123,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:38:16 2015 UTC,Yeah Danzo isnt really all that bad although his methods werent always the best he did always try to look out for the village
Naruto,3djm5g,clockwork47,2,Thu Jul 16 20:44:34 2015 UTC,That's why I like him. An enemy doesn't necessarily have to be a fully evil person.
Naruto,3djm5g,DTakatsuki,0,Thu Jul 16 20:46:38 2015 UTC,"yeah that is true and  i liked Danzo i  just think he was mainly misunderstood and that also why i used ""enemy"" not ""villian"" because like you said a enemy in snot necessarily evil"
Naruto,3djm5g,hunterbelmont,5,Thu Jul 16 20:50:22 2015 UTC,"I think with Itachi, there are 2 elements about him that made him quite interesting.   Throughout Part 1 his character is shrouded in mystery. His abilities and his true motives were never fully revealed until much much later, the only thing we knew about his ninja profile was that he had legendarily wicked skills in all types of combat and was impossible to defeat at genjutsu. I think Itachi's character was the best written even up until the big reveal that Itachi's doings were for the sake of stability in the leaf village and indirectly the stability in the shinobi world. His character was complex, his ideals were based on what he truly believed a ninja ought to be. A ninja is all about self-sacrifice and enduring. If there was ever a shinobi that put more burdens onto himself and kept going with the end-goal on the forefront of his mind; it would be Itachi with Naruto as a distant second.  Nagato/Pain would also be a candidate for favorite enemy.   Out of any villain in the entire series no one understood the importance of peace more than Nagato did. Madara/Obito included. Part of what molded his character was the amount of Pain he had to suffer his whole life. Because of all the combined pain he endured he was convinced that if everyone felt the same pain then people will begin to understand each other. After all, that is how Yahiko, Konan, and Nagato were able to stick together for so long; they understood what it was like to be war orphans. He believed that if people were wounded by the same wounds that they caused against each other then there would finally be universal understanding. In this way people would finally be able to look past themselves and ""grow up"" as Jiraiya told Nagato as a child. He took extraordinary measures, with the ultimate goal being to give all the ninja villages super powerful forbidden jutsu to attack each other with. This leading to everyone feeling the same pain and eventually uniting."
Naruto,3djm5g,petru1745,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:35:47 2015 UTC,"Well i suppose you said it all about Itachi but I would not necessarily call Pain a ""villain"" but a ""enemy"" as a villain is someone evil you know bad intentions but Pain had entirely good intentions but was just manipulated by obito unknowingly due to the pain he has felt but still despite this intentions were to bring peace although his methods were not the best"
Naruto,3djm5g,AllOfEverythingEver,2,Thu Jul 16 23:20:02 2015 UTC,"Well when I said ""villain"", I meant it as in a character that causes lots of trouble/harm to the main protagonists."
Naruto,3djm5g,AllOfEverythingEver,1 point,Fri Jul 17 00:41:40 2015 UTC,Fair enough
Naruto,3djm5g,KaiserNova123,3,Fri Jul 17 09:53:17 2015 UTC,the Zabuza and Haku battle is my all-time favorite. Zabuza's ruthlessness and arrogance make him my favorite antagonist.

Naruto,3djm5g,brianlh9,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:58:51 2015 UTC,Yeah he was op like against deidera and pain is the most badass one of them all
Naruto,3djm5g,no_tourist,3,Thu Jul 16 23:14:05 2015 UTC,i like the akatsuki as a whole but if i had to choose one id say hidan

Naruto,3dnv3n,luigitheplumber,5,Fri Jul 17 20:17:12 2015 UTC,The simplest answer is usually the most correct
Naruto,3dnv3n,jamiethejoker26,-11,Fri Jul 17 22:07:05 2015 UTC,"And yet, people still say ""Son Goku"" and ""Monkey D. Luffy"" with their family names in the front."
Naruto,3dnv3n,lakelurk,12,Fri Jul 17 20:23:00 2015 UTC,I just call him Goku.
Naruto,3dnv3n,night4345,3,Fri Jul 17 20:38:42 2015 UTC,"I call it a matter of customs. The first name you hear, is the one your ear adapts to better xD. The first time I heard the name of Son Goku, I thought it was a kind of ""Mr Goku"" (that's why I call him mostly just Goku), and as for Monkey D. Luffy, I thought ""Monkey"" was the firstname, so I adapted to it. It was later on that I realized my error, but it was too late. I started watching Naruto as Naruto Uzumaki, if I had watched it as Uzumaki Naruto, then maybe today I would still call him like that."
Naruto,3dnv3n,-Obito-,9,Fri Jul 17 22:29:01 2015 UTC,Because it gets translated that way. If it bothers you then learn Japanese.

Naruto,3dnv3n,COH-CIV-TW,1 point,Sat Jul 18 12:59:15 2015 UTC,I've gotten used to that but the one thing that always catches my attention is when madara says madarada instead of madara. Is there some meaning to that? As much as I can think back to I can only think of him himself saying it and not obito saying it.

Naruto,3diajj,TKG8,9,Thu Jul 16 21:08:26 2015 UTC,"The last series, Best Wishes, which was based on Black and White, was pretty awful IMO. The side characters were extremely bland and Ash was really dumbed down, among other things.  However, with XY, while a lot of the filler/buffer episodes follow a certain formula (Ash and co. meet up with person/people with issue, try to help resolve the issue, Team Rocket attacks, beating Team Rocket helps resolve the problem), it still manages to remain fresh and stay entertaining, putting an interesting spin on things each time around. There are filler-ish episodes, which usually don't add much character depth or development, but they still have great animation and Team Rocket's comedy is pretty on point as well.  The battles actually employ a fair amount of strategy and don't amount to just shouting DODGE all the time. Anyways, this has sorta gone off-topic but basically I'm just saying that despite some of the episodes being sorta formulaic, the show still manages to remain fresh, especially with the introduction of Mega Evolution, and the main storyline episodes are pretty interesting too."

If he decides to come back and create manga he should just start a whole new manga and it might even be a bigger hit than Naruto and a better written story.

Naruto,3diuih,CloudShirai,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:19:02 2015 UTC,"Fighting games DO change often and it gets updated more than once a year for most. If you look at Mortal Kombat it has drastically changed from when it was first released. Also even though I'm getting Storm 4 I can guess why some people are not. Considering only a select few are getting updated move sets which will mean only about a quarter of the cast is new. Also you're reason for not having the seven ninja swordsman makes no sense considering they're releasing Rin who did basically nothing. So yes most of these complaints do make sense and the people who are complaining get to because it's their money that they are using and if they don't want to support CC2 that is their choice. Being thankful is the dumbest thing I've heard. Be thankful for what? CC2 is making money off of us so they should be the ones being thankful, not the other way around."
Naruto,3diuih,CloudShirai,2,Thu Jul 16 17:34:36 2015 UTC,"How has mortal kombat drastically changed? New mechanics and graphics and varying characters is nothing special. Sub zero, and Scorpion haven't been updated in years are you serious? I love Mortal Kombat but that was the worst example one could use to disprove what I said, if any.   I already addressed  why barely anyone in the game needs updated movesets. Would it make sense to have team minato storyline in the game without Rin? Also her being in the game though she has lack of shown moves doesn't make sense to me either. But I could see why they would make up moves for her like they did shisui, because she has a main part in the story, while the seven swordsman do not. and it makes more sense to be thankful for getting more than most franchises give rather than being a brat because they didn't add what you wanted."
Naruto,3diuih,Dovahking94,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:50:23 2015 UTC,"""Nothing special"" are you serious? Also two characters out of an entire cast not being updated out of 29 is pretty small even though they were updated. Quan Chi is the first that comes to mind considering they gave him new moves in updates that were given in the span of like two months. There is also the completely new stages and three variations for each character. I don't know if you noticed but the amount of effort put into a Mortal Kombat character is far greater than a Storm character considering there are moves that can add up to far more than three combos. Also the swordsmen were partially completed like the Edo Kages but only the Edo Kages were made into characters. The swordsmen are also part of the main story too considering they murdered a lot of the ninja during the Edo fights. I'm pretty sure there was an episode of fighting for all the swordsmen. I agree with you on the non updated movesets but it would've been better to do it like Hinata where she has at least one updated combo. There was also the problem of now only having three combos for no reason. Also it's not called being a brat if you're the one paying for it. Please explain to me why I should be thankful when I'm paying for it. It's not a necessity and it's not like I need it to live. Now please don't get me wrong, I'm just talking on behalf of the people who are complaining about the game. I'm still getting it and I'm pretty sure im only going to use Minato online because he's my favorite character. But that doesn't mean I can't see why others are mad. Also what is drastic change to you? To me MKX was much more different than MK9."
Naruto,3diuih,Dovahking94,2,Thu Jul 16 18:38:16 2015 UTC,"I've only played the arcade Mortal Kombat games, Armageddon, and MK9. Just watching videos I can see MKX is different than MK9 but my point is it's not different than what any other fighting game does when making a new game. I don't count stages in linear fighting games like MK with Injustice as an exception. I consider the variation thing a mechanic just like Revolution has it's own variation type thing. The big difference between MK and Storm series is that Storm is part of an on-going thing (the show) that they have to keep up with. Also the fact that Naruto has one attack buttons vs MK having 4 of course allows for more variation. I've noticed most open field style fighting games don't have more than one or two attack buttons, the naruto games on wii comes to mind as well as bleach games on wii. Anyways the character updates in MK seem big because they don't get any for years and don't have to because they're not keeping up with a show but I'm betting quan-chi won't be getting a new moveset for a few games (and side games). The seven swordsman did not play anywhere near a role as the kages did or even rin, and even in the anime where they fought a little they didn't do anything outstanding. The thing it seems they're going for when making these is having unique characters and frankly the swordsman didn't do anything to show they were unique. Neither did rin but her plot relevance seems to have saved her. I didn't mean to say it's being a brat but if you look at Naruto Shippuden Gekitou Ninja Taisen Special (thank god I modded my wii and didnt import it) They have sage naruto, minato, raikage, and killer bee as new characters but didn't include pain for who knows why. People still ate that game up so it's obvious that fans are willing to accept much less, with their 41 character roster. We should be thankful that they went above what we were willing to take way back with Storm 1 and have raised out standards."
Naruto,3diuih,Lozse,2,Thu Jul 16 19:09:21 2015 UTC,Ok I see your point now but it's not like I disagreed with you in the first place. I agree with you but I'm voicing why people would be upset. I guess their is just no way to please people. It doesn't matter to me if they add any more characters since I'll only use like two and also even if they do get added I bet no one will play them. The same happened with the Edo Kages. They got added but almost no one used them even though they were highly requested. I tried defending those people that complain about but I guess I like Naruto and these games too much to complain. The only thing I would be hoping for would be at least some new combos for some characters.
Naruto,3diuih,Lozse,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:19:06 2015 UTC,"Yeah I got you, I'm not saying these complaints are stupid and people who have them are too. I'm just saying usually people use these complaints to say the game will suck. and to say the game will suck for those reason is so miniscule in the grand scheme of the game that it brought out this post.  If you're looking at the whole game these are not reasons to say the games will suck, if you play the games to see characters then I guess that would be a reason for it to suck for you.  Also you're right, I try to use other characters but honestly I just get good with 3 or 4 people and main them online. Everyone else I use in endless or player match if it goes on for a long time. In Rev I main Naruto sage mode barrage(awakening type, with kirin sasuke)Sasuke Chidori true spear (ultimate type, with kiba) and Edo Minato (ultimate type, with kakshi, and obito) basically the all around characters lol"
Naruto,3diuih,Lozse,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:26:03 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I literally only use Minato and Jonin Minato is the one I use the most. I don't like Edo Minato that much but he's fun to use."
Naruto,3diuih,SuperSagejin,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:39:38 2015 UTC,I see what you mean but if they're covering all the new material in the manga then the character's Jutsu at the very least should reflect that. Like the other Konoha 12 should have new supers based on their fight with the Juubi minions. Team Asuma got it in their Combo Ultimate but none of the others did. If they're gonna do one they should do them all is what I'm saying.
Naruto,3diuih,SuperSagejin,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:40:28 2015 UTC,I don't remember exactly what everyone else did but I don't remember seeing much of a difference between their normal attacks. I agree there should be team ultimates for all the teams as well as related characters but for example: I can't remember any new thing Shino did during the war that would warrant him a new moveset or ultimate
Naruto,3diuih,AwesomeDattebayo,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:54:58 2015 UTC,"He had the Man Eating Bug that he did on the Juubi clones. I think that would be cool to have as an Ultimate, if a tad gruesome. Kiba's Triple Headed Wolf could very easily be his Ultimate and Hinata's should definitely be Twin Lion Step 64 Palms. That shit is badass."

The show is based on the manga. The manga has already finished with the war. Either that or you have to wait for the series to be over. The anime is at this current chapter. You can read the manga to the last chapter (Chapter 700) and then you can watch The Last."
Naruto,3dkkxf,Mehmedx,3,Fri Jul 17 01:07:01 2015 UTC,Okay thank you so much! Definitely going to read the manga
Naruto,3dkkxf,Omega_Warrior,4,Fri Jul 17 01:14:24 2015 UTC,Just so you know The Last takes place between chapter 699 and the epilogue on 700. For best effect watch it before you read 700.

Naruto,3djp6k,knight504,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:50:58 2015 UTC,Tailed beasts can't die because they're literally chakra monsters. I think he will be set free but will help Konoha if something happens.

Naruto,3djp6k,ohnoyouwont,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:51:06 2015 UTC,"Why not? Other tailed beast he is seen now as a Konoha member, not just a monster.  And how Naruto could be immortal? So many characters chased after immortality and failed so we know it's impossible."
Naruto,3djp6k,DTakatsuki,2,Thu Jul 16 20:58:51 2015 UTC,And how Naruto could be immortal? So many characters chased after immortality and failed so    hidan was immortal
Naruto,3djp6k,ohnoyouwont,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:31:25 2015 UTC,"As long as he did the rituals. So, not really immortal, he can die."
Naruto,3djp6k,knight504,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:33:44 2015 UTC,"Nah, that was a misunderstanding from a databook translation. He doesn't need to sustain his immortality with the rituals.  He does need to eat though. Comes up in the second fanbook, I think."

Naruto,3djp6k,ohnoyouwont,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:40:55 2015 UTC,"It's just a popular theory, I don't have a proof. But the info that he can die from malnutrition is from some databook, second I believe."
Naruto,3djp6k,DTakatsuki,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:46:00 2015 UTC,"ok taking that into consideration, if he had food to satisfy his hunger and performs his rituals, you can say that he would live forever"

Naruto,3dixfu,izzyazz,4,Thu Jul 16 18:04:10 2015 UTC,Yea he managed to survive the longest and be more of a role model to the village then the rest. Also he is responsible for the legendary sannin which in my opinion is an amazing accomplishment.

Naruto,3dixfu,vallz,4,Fri Jul 17 01:51:33 2015 UTC,"I believe it was Tobirama. Think about it, their were no major catastrophes while he was Hokage. Hashirama had Madara betray the village and try to attack it. Hiruzen had Orochimaru betray the village and try to attack it. Minato had the Kurama attack the village. And Tsunade had Pain attack the village."
Naruto,3dixfu,Sherlock_87,16,Thu Jul 16 17:23:21 2015 UTC,Could it be pure luck or coincidence though?  He was partially responsible for ostracizing the Uchihas which led to the planned coup.. not a very good move imo..
Naruto,3dixfu,Rosaline898,3,Thu Jul 16 17:49:39 2015 UTC,"yeah good point, he did put in everything in place that led to the Uchiha coup, but he died before that happened which led to Hiruzen taking the fall, i hadn't thought of that"
Naruto,3dixfu,Sherlock_87,4,Thu Jul 16 18:11:12 2015 UTC,You just reminded me of my best friend. He also believes Tobirama is the best because of the same. I think my only grief with the 2nd is the forbidden jutsu he created being one of the biggest used things in the war yea know. But he is awesome
Naruto,3dixfu,Rosaline898,5,Thu Jul 16 18:10:50 2015 UTC,I think Tobirama can be compared to scientists. They don't ask should I but rather can I?
Naruto,3dixfu,petru1745,2,Thu Jul 16 18:23:45 2015 UTC,"While i agree that without his Reanimation Jutsu the war would of gone much differently, it was the person using it not the Jutsu. Oro used the Jutsu for good instead of evil."

Naruto,3digun,huskar67,4,Thu Jul 16 15:19:25 2015 UTC,Yes. That's what got me hooked into the series. The fact that he is the main character yet he is not your typical Goku. It's not like he arrives to the battlefield and fixes everything... Rather he gets and makes it a little bit more complicated or screws it up somehow.

Naruto,3di5q3,Ringo007,13,Thu Jul 16 13:46:02 2015 UTC,"And if they must do filler why not make it interesting. There are so many more interesting things to explore than the Chuunin exams like: Tobirama's reign, Kirigakure under Yagura, Hiruzen in his prime, Hashirama's death, etc."
Naruto,3di5q3,DoubleHunter,7,Thu Jul 16 14:52:06 2015 UTC,I'd watch all of that
Naruto,3di5q3,espravbalcny,4,Thu Jul 16 15:21:35 2015 UTC,Same
Naruto,3di5q3,OnlyAwesomeAsian,4,Thu Jul 16 15:32:35 2015 UTC,Even if the premise sounds interesting doesn't mean that it's gonna be good filler. The chunin exams looked like it was going to be interesting but it sucked.
Naruto,3di5q3,G_Spark233,3,Thu Jul 16 15:37:06 2015 UTC,"Of course, but as long as relatively unexplored and interesting characters like Kisame, Tobirama, Hiruzen and Hashirama are involved and awesome scenes like this happen occasionally then I at least would be satisfied."
Naruto,3di5q3,DoubleHunter,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:28:56 2015 UTC,I wouldn't
Naruto,3di5q3,OnlyAwesomeAsian,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:21:35 2015 UTC,"Hell - they even could have made the Chuunin exams interesting. They just didn't. My problem with fillers is that precedent says they are going to suck. I enjoyed the Kakashi filler arc but... on the whole those have been the only good fillers for the entire series. You'd think it wouldn't be that hard, apparently it is."
Naruto,3di5q3,swarbles,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:32:41 2015 UTC,I would fucking LOVE to see Tobirama's reign..
Naruto,3di5q3,trappedoutthebando,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:00:28 2015 UTC,That's what I was hoping the history of  Konoha was going to be about. Nope just a bunch of random fucking garbage.
Naruto,3di5q3,methheadhitman,7,Fri Jul 17 00:40:11 2015 UTC,Do they care more for money then the fans which made the show popular?   I think you already know the answer to this.
Naruto,3di5q3,IdRatherBeLurking,8,Fri Jul 17 01:58:18 2015 UTC,The most annoying part is that this filler is almost pointless. The manga is over! There shouldn't be any need for filler!
Naruto,3di5q3,G_Spark233,3,Thu Jul 16 15:31:11 2015 UTC,Exactly. If their excuse is they have to drag it out longer because of contracts or they simply want more money. The scope they have for filler is endless. Give us itachi chronicles and have it be interesting. Not the dull lifeless goop they shove down our throat. I woke up and wanted to watch the red beast. But nope another week break. If it's a holiday fair enough can't do much about that. But the last 8 months have been us sucking a fat one.
Naruto,3di5q3,G_Spark233,5,Thu Jul 16 13:54:49 2015 UTC,This week's break is actually because of a Pokemon special not a holiday.
Naruto,3di5q3,b14m3m3,4,Thu Jul 16 14:05:40 2015 UTC,"The funny thing in all this is that Naruto is declining very much in Japan (Currently there on vacation and the interest seems to be very low), for the ""milking the product"" the most profitable thing would most likely get Naruto finished and start up new popular series to generate ""fresh"" revenue. That or they already got some new stuff planned, but need to drag it out a bit to get the new stuff started fully (though there should be plenty episodes left to be able to prepare for that). All I see here in Japan is One piece, Dragon ball, some volleyball series or something from jump, in terms of merchandise. Which would indicate it isen't worth it for jump to put more money into the stuff... (But who knows maybe they want to make a Boruto series depending on how the movie does and for some reason delaying...)  Personally as a very unpopular opinion in this sub, I actually enjoy most of the fillers(now there are some that a just truly horrible, like that robot one x.x), I just don't want my childhood series to end :("
Naruto,3di5q3,b14m3m3,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:38:44 2015 UTC,But it has ended. And if it is falling in popularity there they need to send it off with some dignity instead of dragging it through the mud like they have been for the lash 4 years. 4/5 damn years ago this story was wonderful. Meh it's your opinion. I enjoyed the first 2 episodes of kakashis episode last year. But these recent ones have bored me. Someone else here mentioned some of the potential filler arcs they could have done which would please fans. Tobirama arc etc.
Naruto,3di5q3,read-it-too,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:08:34 2015 UTC,"I fully agree, they should end the series without dragging it through all the fillers as it seems to be the more common opinion about the series."
Naruto,3di5q3,wookiee1807,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:15:19 2015 UTC,"The recent 6-months Chunnin exam filler could have been worth it if they developed more about the very last episode (still within those 6 months).  What I mean is that they very briefly mentioned that the girl (who later turned one of the Pain bodies) from the Rain died, and didn't stay long on the encounter of the Junchuriki girl and the Akatsuki. Those two highlights were already part of the storyline, thus would have been a great filler, but they jumped over them leaving questions unanswered, while they could have cut off on the Chunnin exam episodes. Just my opinion."
Naruto,3di5q3,Jmqt,2,Thu Jul 16 16:13:26 2015 UTC,"Agreed... In total, we've had like what, 40 minutes of actually in-anime time pass? Everyone just standing around staring at each other while they all reminisce about the past. I must have missed the part where they were all trained to glaze over during a major fight and relive moments of their past."
Naruto,3di5q3,kDiverse,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:58:48 2015 UTC,ditto :( :(
Naruto,3di5q3,HokageEzio,0,Thu Jul 16 13:51:33 2015 UTC,"Do they care more for money then the fans which made the show popular   If the fans didn't like the fillers, it wouldn't generate any money for them to keep airing it. It's a shame though, that an anime that I once loved is now a piece of shit. I just hope, which I doubt would happen, that they're going to use the money that they have made from the fillers to make the rest of the canon have the best animation."
Naruto,3di5q3,HokageEzio,0,Thu Jul 16 14:13:44 2015 UTC,Will it heck. Look at the trailer for the next episode. A particular hyped up event for manga readers and non manga readers must be psyched up too. But it looks piss poor just like obitos fights.

Naruto,3de5kp,jayjayace,2,Thu Jul 16 00:25:33 2015 UTC,So did you think he was like Naruto from the future or something?
Naruto,3de5kp,DuckterQuackWebMD,8,Thu Jul 16 01:23:29 2015 UTC,"Yeah, how could he not explain this one? I'm over here trying to rationalize Kakashi being Naruto and it doesn't fit. I mean, even Sasuke would've made more sense. Hell, I probably would've believed that way back when."
Naruto,3de5kp,RoseBladePhantom,27,Thu Jul 16 03:38:32 2015 UTC,"IIRC (I was like, 14 at the time, so forgive me if I don't remember properly), the two leading theories were that he was a ""half-Uchiha"" and got the eye from his mother or, due to the scar on his eye, that he either took it or it was given to him at some point during combat."
Naruto,3de5kp,swarbles,-4,Wed Jul 15 17:54:08 2015 UTC,"Irrelevant, How old are you now? I know the 4th Great Ninja War started just over 5 years ago in the manga, but this is much earlier in the series so I'm wondering."

Naruto,3de5kp,carinihada,3,Wed Jul 15 23:40:11 2015 UTC,I read it the same way you did and also thought it was in response to him being 14 at the time.

Naruto,3de5kp,Broski5454,7,Thu Jul 16 00:58:36 2015 UTC,To be honest I thought he might have had some distant uchiha blood in his family tree.
Naruto,3de5kp,walta_,11,Wed Jul 15 19:16:50 2015 UTC,"I always thought he possibly inherited from his mother because she could be an Uchiha (didn't think about his father because of Hatake), but Kakashi Gaiden changed that though.."
Naruto,3de5kp,izn1337,6,Wed Jul 15 17:05:55 2015 UTC,"I always thought someone gave him his eye. And irrelevant but, when we first saw Tobi and he only had one eye, the opposite of kakashi's I knew that was where he got it from!!!!!!"
Naruto,3de5kp,BakedOwl,9,Thu Jul 16 04:37:43 2015 UTC,"Well, that was way before my time, but Obito was mentioned a couple times in Part 1 and Kakashi did say his ""Best friend"" was on the memorial statue he spent all his life looking at in like Chapter 7. I'd be a bit surprised if people did not put twp and two together and think that that Obito Kakashi always talked about when alone was that same best friend, and put the pieces together that he also gave him his eye.  But I may just have the benefit of hindsight on that"
Naruto,3de5kp,RockSauron,23,Wed Jul 15 16:08:21 2015 UTC,I don't think it was even revealed that Obito was an Uchiha until Kakashi Gaiden.
Naruto,3de5kp,eagereyez,3,Wed Jul 15 17:02:42 2015 UTC,"My friends and I were convinced that he was part Uchiha and for whatever reason, he could only activate the sharingan in one of his eyes. The scar was from someone that tried to steal his eye and failed."
Naruto,3de5kp,PrecipitASIAN,2,Wed Jul 15 22:09:38 2015 UTC,"Real question is , did Kishimoto had Obito in mind ever since first +30 chapters where Kakashi was shown with sharingan , or did he created him later on , but what was original idea about Kakashi having that eye"
Naruto,3de5kp,Obelisk696,12,Wed Jul 15 19:58:01 2015 UTC,"You see obito and rin in a team picture as early as chap 16 i believe,and see them in the anime in the third hokages flashbacks when talking to oro just before he dies.  Their charecter designs were slightly different in those though. I'm pretty sure the obito character was very early on, hell kakashi even mentions him (not by name) in team 7's first training session. kishi likely had a general story thought out and probably changed it slightly into what we know it today."
Naruto,3de5kp,Toad_Sage_Jiraiya,3,Wed Jul 15 20:16:49 2015 UTC,"We saw Obito during that arc (chapter cover), so I guess, there was some kind of plan."
Naruto,3de5kp,henne-n,2,Wed Jul 15 20:07:52 2015 UTC,"I think Obito was definitely an original part of the story. Maybe not that he was the main bad guy, but his presence in Kakashi's life (and that he gave him the Sharingan) I think was more or less decided as soon as Kakashi's character took shape."
Naruto,3de5kp,swarbles,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:38:32 2015 UTC,"Looking back, it feels like someone like Obito was in the works for a while. However, like Sasuke and plenty of the other story elements, it feels like he probably wasn't created first thing. More like Kishi needed some sort of bridge for things to happen, and Obito was the right idea."
Naruto,3de5kp,Rosebunse,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:23:25 2015 UTC,"Kishi did think of Minato (4 Hokage as he was called then) when he created Kiba and Akamaru, so probably thought of Obito pretty early too."
Naruto,3de5kp,VBaus,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:57:46 2015 UTC,"Lord, it happened so long ago...I guess I figured he got it either from a friend, or he killed a rogue Uchiha."
Naruto,3de5kp,Rosebunse,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:22:01 2015 UTC,"I always thought somebody like his dad gave it to him, because we kinda knew he wasn't an uchiha, or that he killed somebody for it"

Naruto,3de5kp,RoseBladePhantom,1 point,Thu Jul 16 03:46:23 2015 UTC,"I never really thought about it. I always just figured that he was an Uchiha but kind of like the ""Naruto of the Uchiha.""  To clarify by ""Naruto of the Uchiha,"" I thought he was a rare deformed Uchiha with only one eye that works, and maybe an adult cut his eye to try to get rid of it, changed his name to Hatake as an alias.  Mine is more of an extreme purist theory."
Naruto,3de5kp,Chalaka,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:34:10 2015 UTC,"Father was Uchiha, mother was normal so he only had one sharingan. The scar I thought was from him attempting to remove his Sharingan to be normal."

Naruto,3dgijt,FadiHareth,16,Thu Jul 16 02:20:57 2015 UTC,This was actually part of the huge speculation way back in the day when people were trying to figure out who he was when he was first introduced.
Naruto,3dgijt,Spartn90,5,Thu Jul 16 02:27:37 2015 UTC,"I was actually fine with the way Naruto ended, but was a little disappointed that Kishi didn't put more effort into Obito's secret persona."
Naruto,3dgijt,NaturaHigh,3,Thu Jul 16 06:12:33 2015 UTC,Remember the future Sasuke theory?
Naruto,3dgijt,FakeAdminAccount,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:26:59 2015 UTC,"That theory was off the wall, but just plausible enough to believe."
Naruto,3dgijt,hreigle,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:09:53 2015 UTC,"I didn't think it was at all possible until I read people's theories, then it seemed possible."
Naruto,3dgijt,Spartn90,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:18:55 2015 UTC,"Do you know when the speculation on who he is started? Was it after we saw his sharingan or since he was senpai-ing deidara? Because I was late on watching the series, and I wasn't really speculating until they showed he had the sharingan, and then I went total nuts seeing who it was"
Naruto,3dgijt,BelieveInThePeeko,2,Thu Jul 16 14:15:51 2015 UTC,"Seeing his Sharingan just reinforced the possibility, people were throwing theories around like crazy as soon as he was introduced"
Naruto,3dgijt,Spartn90,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:18:06 2015 UTC,"Wow, that's interesting. I was a little stupid and thought he was slightly deformed like some of the other members and that was his face. It took the sharingan to show me that that's a mask. I hope I wasn't the only one because that idea just sounds ridiculous lol"
Naruto,3dgijt,BelieveInThePeeko,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:20:59 2015 UTC,"Man, I think our sub could have had a civil war deciding which theory was the best. I was sadly against the Tobito theorists. My money was on Izuna or 2nd Hokage or something."
Naruto,3dgijt,sugatooth,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:59:47 2015 UTC,"I remember thinking Izuna too, second Hokage though?  That'd be an interesting read, do you remember any of the points to the theory?"
Naruto,3dgijt,Spartn90,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:24:12 2015 UTC,"I think it had to do with the fact that ""Tobi"" was a part of his name (Tobirama) and that he also had advanced space-time ninjutsu.  That was a long time ago of course, so it's hard to recall everything exactly.  Edit: In retrospect this wouldn't make too much sense because the 2nd was already Edo Tensei'd once before--he would have had to be brought back to life multiple times for it to be plausible. Plus the motive was in question, too.."
Naruto,3dgijt,sugatooth,2,Thu Jul 16 22:13:15 2015 UTC,"Everything then was speculation, at one  point all we had linking him and Obito was the name and his haircut being similar, lol"
Naruto,3dgijt,Spartn90,15,Thu Jul 16 22:56:03 2015 UTC,"I was under the impression that it came from the combination of To, which is japanese for 10, and Bi which refers to the word tail. To he's bascially calling himself 10 tails and foreshadowing his goals from his very introduciton."
Naruto,3dgijt,hreigle,3,Thu Jul 16 04:47:18 2015 UTC,"Well I have no proof this is the real reason, just a thought that came to me.  It seems like the white zetsu that held on to Obito being named Tobi is why he called himself that, but what you and others said could be the reason why Tobi was chosen to be that name"
Naruto,3dgijt,Danbito,8,Thu Jul 16 05:33:50 2015 UTC,"Coincidently ""Tobi"" was the actual name for the Spiral Zetsu that helped Obito out by letting him suit up"
Naruto,3dgijt,SuperNeonManGuy,7,Thu Jul 16 03:15:33 2015 UTC,"If you write the word ""Tobi"" around a cylinder and turn it then it looks like ""tobitobitobitobi"", the word ""obito"" is right in there."
Naruto,3dgijt,BelieveInThePeeko,4,Thu Jul 16 05:21:16 2015 UTC,"what if they trolled us by giving him a wristband like this. ""Does it say Tobi or Obito?"""
Naruto,3dgijt,FakeAdminAccount,2,Thu Jul 16 14:16:39 2015 UTC,I would be OK with this.
Naruto,3dgijt,BelieveInThePeeko,2,Thu Jul 16 14:28:27 2015 UTC,"I kinda wish he did that now when I think about it. Imagine if in Kakashi's flashbacks Obito had a wristband like that to foreshadow his tobi character. Or maybe, you see the wristband in Obito's lab when he was awakening Sasuke's Eternal Mongekyos"

Most weaboos are uneducated about their obsession of choice and are often noobs who are overly zealous, trying to impress others with their otaku knowledge. Another trait of a weaboo is their desire to ""be Japanese"".  While the two terms are often fused together, weaboos are very different from anime fans or enthusiasts. A fan may be just as enthusiastic and knowlegable  about Japanese culture, mainly anime, but they neither boast about their knowledge nor call themselves otaku(because of its known negative connatation).

I thought Choji vs Jirobo was one of my favourite fights.  Until that fight Choji was just a fatass joke who ate all the time, had a kind of goofy looking ball-rolling technique, was kind of cowardly, and got his ass kicked in about two seconds by that sound ninja in the chunin preliminary matches.  Nobody expected shit from Choji. Not the other characters, not the audience.  But Shikamaru did - the smartest ninja in the show. And Choji stepped up, showed that he had a lot more to him.  He fought and his real self came out - and he was actually pretty strong. His appearance was deceptive - exactly like a ninja should be.  Choji gave it everything he had to the point of nearly dying, he won, and he saved his friends."

Naruto,3dd5w7,erockarmy1,6,Thu Jul 16 00:32:14 2015 UTC,Choji always had Shikamaru believing in him. Gaara had no one. So I think he came much further.  I like Choji though and usually disappointed he has so few fans. His wikia said he is the only member of the K11 to never be in the top 20 in any Naruto popularity poll. Even Shino and Tenten have made the top 20.

Naruto,3dd5w7,SJ_Gemini,8,Wed Jul 15 21:28:37 2015 UTC,"Let's be real - who grew the most in this series? There's only one answer: Naruto. He went from an arrogant, incompetent idiot to becoming the strongest ninja in the world, as well as grappling with the hatred of the shinobi system and being the leader in challenging the evil that threatened to end the world. A main character should generally grow more than anyone else. I don't honestly think any other character exhibits half of the growth that Naruto does.  Other than Naruto, I'd say it's a tie between Choji and Gaara, in very different ways. Choji grew up and began to learn how to not be a little bitch. Gaara learned what it meant to have bonds and went from a partially insane, bloodthirsty brat to become the Kazekage and the leader of the joint armed forces. Choji is great and all, but he really only has two moments of growth - the Jirobo fight and the Asuma fight. Gaara is constantly growing."
Naruto,3dd5w7,swarbles,4,Wed Jul 15 15:49:04 2015 UTC,"Gaara went from extremely antisocial to becoming the figurehead of his entire village. Not to mention from pure evil to benevolent.   Naruto as a child wasn't different from his future self in that he was outgoing, but the reactions that his environment stunted his personality. Naruto wanted to be nice to everyone and wanted to be friends, but nobody accepted him in his early years.   That being said Gaara exhibits more growth as an individual than Naruto does barring Naruto's strength at the end of the series which most of it he was ""born"" into. Naruto wouldn't be Naruto without Kurama and his ""bloodline""."
Naruto,3dd5w7,LILY_LALA,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:56:10 2015 UTC,"I don't agree with that at all. I think it goes back to the quote from Itachi - ""You don't become Hokage to make others acknowledge you, you become Hokage because they acknowledge you.""  Naruto did not experience the drastic swing from insane young child to kazekage like Gaara did. However, his character is by necessity the most complicated. At the beginning of the series, he still has an optimistic outlook, sure. He's also a wholly incompetent ninja, a loudmouth brat who no one likes, completely full of himself in an unneccessary way, and completely ignorant to the actual ways of the world and how to become Hokage. Over the course of 700 chapters, we see him transform into a bonafide genius shinobi, who is able to lead the entire joint shinobi forces and keep them going in the face of almost certain defeat, purely through the power of his will. He picks something up from every single one of his mentors throughout the show - Kakashi, Jiraiya, Minato, Nagato, and Itachi - and internalizes it to become a better leader. Gaara's transformation is amazing but Naruto is the main character, and Naruto is the most and best developed character."

Naruto,3dh3cr,letgourearthlytether,4,Thu Jul 16 05:40:22 2015 UTC,Kushina was weakened by having just given birth and used up her strength chaining Kurama. She knew was going to die one way or another hence why she asked Minato to seal the Kyuubi back inside and take it with her.
Naruto,3dh3cr,night4345,2,Thu Jul 16 06:04:23 2015 UTC,"I'm not 100% sure as to if there is a ""stated canon reason"" but Kushina had to die because after having the Kyubbi extracted, she was weak and going to die soon anyway, as that is what happens with tailed beast extractions. I believe they did not seal Kurama back into her because she was going to die from trauma anyway as well as she was too weak to be able to have the beast under control if sealed inside her again.  Since they cannot seal the beast back into Kushina, Minato had/wanted to die because the only way he could save the village from the Kyuubi was if he sealed it away inside himself (still being ""healthy"" and strong enough, so he used the Reaper Death Seal, which was possibly the only sealing jutsu in Minato's arsenal capable and powerful enough to seal a tailed beast."
Naruto,3dh3cr,ImCodeGreen,1 point,Thu Jul 16 06:04:06 2015 UTC,"what about the seal he used on Naruto? It wasn't in his arsenal? And it got Kyuubi under control. It's just a total plot hole, the whole sealing thing. Kushina decided to use shitload of her energy to ""protect"" themselves from Hiruzen and others coming. If she used that chakra to restrain Kyuubi instead of creating a barrier, Hiruzen would come, help with Kyuubi and at least Minato would have survived. But noo, better suicide and let your kid grow all alone, almost giving him to the dark side - Naruto specifically said a few times that if not for certain things, he and Sasuke could have been on opposite sides."
Naruto,3dh3cr,k-tax,4,Thu Jul 16 11:51:29 2015 UTC,"He used the Reaper Death Seal so that it would take part of the Kyuubi's chakra with him to death, because Naruto as a child wouldn't be able to control the ""complete"" Kyuubi. That's why he used the Reaper Death Seal first and not only the Eight Trigram Seal on Naruto. Kushina was dying and extremely weak and couldn't even restrain the Kyuubi completely, as it was still able to move and stab them with its claw. I doubt she'd survive a re-sealing in her state.   Minato also decided to seal the beast to keep it hidden/away from the Masked Man. Even if Hiruzen would come, I think he'd try to seal it too, how else do you get rid of a beast like that in a quick way? Either way, the beast gets sealed into someone.   Minato also strongly felt that Naruto would be the one to defeat the Masked Man and he believed that Naruto would be capable of doing that with the tailed beast inside of him. It was very risky doing that to his just born son, and it could have backfired in many ways, but it worked out in the end because the father had faith in his son. Besides, Minato sealed both his and Kushina's chakra in Naruto's seal and if Naruto did go down a darker path and unleashed his rage /anger/sadness onto others, his parents would be there to help. Minato was smart and called a prodigy, I doubt he made his choices without at least some logical thought.  You may see it as a plot hole but I see it as a key event in the plot. Without the events happening as they did, the show might not be as good as it is and it may not even exist since a big part of the story was about a boy with a beast inside him."

Naruto,3dh3cr,ImCodeGreen,1 point,Fri Jul 17 08:48:45 2015 UTC,"Bee was older and already a very good shinobi when he had the beast sealed in him. Naruto, on the other hand, was literally just born and I doubt he'd be able to control the entire Kurama (AKA the most powerful tailed beast after the ten tails). For this reason, Minato HAD to weaken Kurama to some degree if he was going to seal it into Naruto and the Reaper Death Seal is all that came to mind for him. The thing about using that seal is that the user dies, which is why Minato lost his life but not as a suicide, but as a sacrifice."

Naruto,3dh3cr,Rosebunse,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:21:12 2015 UTC,"Well, to be fair, Obito had it out for Minato because he blamed him for not protecting Rin and Kakashi.   Now, let's be clear, Kushina was going to die. She was weak from Naruto's very difficult birth, and even with her special chakra, that just meant she'd live a little longer.  Minato is a bit more difficult. I honestly think he just wanted to die. He was worried he'd be an awful father, and he wanted to do something that would perfectly disable the fox."

Something no one has mentioned is the fact that they were coming out of a great ninja war, and a jinchuriki is pretty much a nuclear deterrent. No one wants to fuck with a village with a tailed beast under control. Minato could have resealed the 9 tails into Kushina, she would have died and taken the Kyuubi with her, but that would have left Konoha without a tailed beast. If people found out about that, they would be viewed as weak and potentially attacked while vulnerable by another village with another tailed beast. He was looking out for the future of his village and wanted to believe that no matter what happened to him in life Naruto would end up stronger for it, and use the power he was giving him for good."

Naruto,3df39z,Caliburn0,11,Thu Jul 16 01:51:11 2015 UTC,"There is none. Jutsu are highly situational. Some are good in some instances, while others work better in other situations.   If I take some examples from the other comments...  The ten-tails bijuudama is probably the most destructive jutsu that is used in the show. Or at least the most successful destructive jutsu. I actually think Madara's ""meteor rain"" is the most destructive. If he spread that throughout the entire continent, the elemental nations would be fucked.  However, those are only most destructive and they can't be used for much more besides that. (Unless you want a giant mountain hanging in the air for whatever reason). Here the Hiraishin is vastly underestimated I think. Instant teleportation is a technique fit for nothing less than gods. It can be used to high effect on any power scale. Dimension hopping like Obito does is also extremely versatile. It doesn't matter how strong an attack is, if you can just teleport it away. Or teleport yourself away (If you don't care about everyone else, that is).  Now we also have Banbutsu Sozo. Or the Creation of All Things. Which can be used to create literally everything. You create matter out of energy. Used to it's full effect, together with gravity and time-space manipulation, this can be used to create an entirely new world. However, other jutsu are probably better in battle. If you are at the point of creating matter out of energy, you can probably do a lot more destructive stuff for less energy.  The truth seeking balls are a mix between all elemental transformations. They can be molded and change shape on command. However, their scale is limited. They can explode, but not nearly as large as the tailed beast bomb. They also have a range of 70 meters from the caster. (Or at least that's how far Madara could control them) They are highly versatile and powerful for both defense and offense. But that's all they are. Near indestructible matter, capable of changing form and exploding in relatively small explosions.  Then we have the Human and Outer Path of the Rinnegan. No one seem to understand the fact that, if someone can literally drag your soul out, it doesn't really matter how strong you are. You are still going to die. The same halfways applies to the Yamanaka Jutsu. If your mind gets taken over, what'u'gonna do? Even though the main villains (Obito and Madara) seemed to be immune (or at least resistant) to the jutsu.  Now, we have seals, or fuinjutsu, which can apparently do anything, given the correct design and enough energy. Then we have the eight gates, which is basically a one time Super Saiyan. Senjutsu can be used for some pretty crazy shit (Hashirama wood Buddha)... Kaguya's bones can apparently pierce through anything and rot it away in an instant. Kotoamatsukami can make anyone do anything. Although I chose to believe that people with sharingan or higher can at least try to fight (If they even want to), like Sasuke did with Itachi's Tsukuyomi. Then we have Dust Release... Which can split everything it touches into atoms. That could probably kill Goku, btw (if it could touch him). The ten-tails also summoned a gigantic storm, but that is probably trumped by the bijudama and meteor rain.  There is probably more, but you get the point. There is really no such thing as ""the strongest jutsu"". And even the most destructive ones can probably be outclassed by something else. All you really need is enough imagination and energy. Imagine using gravity manipulation to send earth out of orbit... (You could send the entire planet into the sun...)"
Naruto,3df39z,walta_,5,Wed Jul 15 22:22:11 2015 UTC,"By strong he must mean destructive power.   Otherwise most S-rank  and even A-rank jutsus can be the ""strongest"" depending on your ability to use them strategically."

Naruto,3df39z,GaBeRockKing,4,Wed Jul 15 23:56:28 2015 UTC,"Of those, fuuinjutsu is easily the most powerful.  step one: create a seal that drains chakra from nearby people and objects to fuel itself.  step two: make the seal use that energy  and nearby material to replicate itself.  step three: grey goo, and no one has the chakra to respond to it.  Poof. Global destruction on autopilot."
Naruto,3df39z,Caliburn0,3,Wed Jul 15 23:01:45 2015 UTC,"Heh, never thought about that. It has to be a damn powerful seal though. It consumes energy and is self replicating...

It's 夜ガイ,   夜 means ""Night"" ガイ means ""Guy""   So, ""Night Guy""    This creates a pun, because, because Night Guy & Might Guy rhym.  Also,   When you write Night Guy using hiragana, you get Naito Gai (ナイト・ガイ) When you write Might Guy using hiragana, you get Maito Gai (マイト・ガイ)   Maito Gai and Naito Gai rhym.    So it rhymes in both Japanese & English"

Naruto,3dcu3q,IIvoltairII,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:43:30 2015 UTC,I see where your coming from but for some of the scenes the flashing got too intense and I literally had to look away. It was excellent but the mushroom one used scenes that were overall more powerful. But I can see where you're coming from friend
Naruto,3dcu3q,Gokuto,1 point,Thu Jul 16 00:30:44 2015 UTC,"Lol yeah. I actually loved the flashing because it perfectly synced with the music(either the guitar and/or drums), but it really goes on preference and what the amvs were trying to capture.   The Mushroom Saeed amv like what Shabdanov said captured the feel and mood of Naruto and had more emotional/powerful scenes. The TTFAF amv captured the epicness and craziness in Naruto and was just an intense amv with no emotional scenes. It was like being on a fast fun rollercoaster."

Naruto,3dfyq0,Even456,5,Wed Jul 15 23:36:30 2015 UTC,"I'd probably rally the Uchiha around the time of the coup, use the supposed message that Madara foretold of the Uchiha Tablet and say that the unity of power and opposing forces will lead to peace for the Uchiha. Ally the Uchihas with the Mist Village ( which should be under Madara's control around that time), assault an attack on the Leaf and during the chaos grab Naruto. The attack should provide enough distraction with the Mist ninja being from the Bloody Mist era, maybe even have Kisame's generation of the Seven Swordsmen.  We now have two Tailed Beasts, and while I'm at it, attack the Waterfall village and grab Fu, taking advantage of the fact it's a small village. Eventually ally with the Sand, with the intention of grabbing Gaara or hopefully they hand him over in exchange for economic stability (he may prove to be a problem with his unpredictability). Eliminate Ao as his Byakugan would remove the hold of power over the Mist. Use the Hunter ninja to search throughout the lands for other Jinchuriki (Roshi, Han, Utakata). However, also have Nagato create Akatsuki, with the promise that with the Mist's backing, they could overthrow Hanzo's betrayal with Danzo, and secure peace for the Hidden Rain. Convince Nagato that the Tailed Beasts must be sealed away, and his Rinnegan is key, and with his powers, along with the Mist, attack the Hidden Cloud, where his Rinnegan powers could take care of Killer B and Yugito. With all Tailed Beasts chakra sample gathered, and the Shinobi World still in an untrustworthy state just after the Third Ninja War, there would be no Ninja Alliance to oppose. Convince Nagato that he must sacrifice himself to revive Madara, depict him as this person who's ideas were brought too early within a society that structured around warfare and therefore shunned, and he should revive him so he can be this prophet to lead them to peace (obviously not though). Madara's back and takes back his eyes, and absorbes the Gedo Mazo turned into the Ten Tails, and creates the God Tree and uses Infinite Tsukuyomi (SORRY FOR SUCH A LONG POST!)"
Naruto,3dfyq0,Danbito,4,Thu Jul 16 01:00:25 2015 UTC,I would have gone out of my way to learn Edo Tensei. Then I would have summoned Ginkaku and Kinkaku after Sasuke got part of the eight tails.

Naruto,3di6pm,Shruth1,18,Thu Jul 16 13:54:22 2015 UTC,I just enjoy more the Naruto universe than the One Piece universe
Naruto,3di6pm,Tamaur,15,Thu Jul 16 14:00:05 2015 UTC,"One Piece is a great manga. It's really enjoyable. I really like the happy-go-lucky attitude and Luffy's character is awesome. I am current with OP manga (I watch anime with my fiancee and OP took too long for it to get going for her so we haven't watched it in awhile).  I wanted to start with that so that you know I am an OP fan and that I have read every chapter and loved it.  Now, onto why Naruto is better:   The world. OP has an expansive world, but it, in all honestly, is not constructed as well as Naruto's. The way it is structured allows there to be many unconnected areas and storylines such that things that happen in one arc on one island don't always effect what's happening elsewhere (obviously, this is starting to change as we get further into the series). Naruto, on the other hand, exists in a carefully constructed political realm where every action has a significant impact on the outcome of the story, as interpreted through the relationships between countries and villages. It is a more wholly constructed fantasy world because of this. The interplay of the different countries is the crux of the series and having that political backbone gives it more weight and more merit allegorically. More =/= Better. We are almost to One Piece chapter 800. Oda said around the time skip that the story was halfway through. So we are looking at a story that will span upwards of 25 years in length and we aren't even in the heart of it yet. On one hand, this is very impressive. On the other hand - what were the last 800 chapters for, then? OP is an epic adventure, but that's all it really is. There is a lot more talking, a lot more arcs, a lot more things happening, but not in a way that significantly moves the overall plot. Oda tends to love these massive battles that have like seven different parts and take forever to get through piece by piece, because it's constantly jumping around. So now you get a scenario where we haven't seen Sanji for like a year and a half. Just because there is more of everything in OP it does not make it superior. Naruto has much more clear cut themes, a more streamlined plot, and more well-rounded characters. The tone of the series. Like I said above, OP Is a non-stop adventure. It's a lot of fun. But at the end of the day, we don't even know why we're reading yet. We don't know what's at stake. Naruto, from the beginning, constructed a world in which the shinobi system was inherently faulty. By opening up the series with the Zabuza arc, Kishi was making a conscious choice to steer Naruto in a darker direction, one that deals directly with the hatred and darkness within oneself. The general tone of OP is either ""Let's be friends, got any meat?"" or ""you made my crew member cry, I'm gonna kick your ass!!!!"" It is far more ""shonen"" than Naruto in that respect. Again - I love OP's tone. But it's fun loving atmosphere means that it's unlikely I'll ever like it as much as Naruto. What's at stake. Again - this has a lot to do with the fact that, after almost 17 years, we still have very little idea of what the actual plot of One Piece is. It moves too slowly. With Naruto, we had a clear cut understanding of the bad guys and that their motives would greatly affect either Konoha (part 1) or the world (part 2). In OP, every arc is so separated that it feels like individual mini-mangas that don't connect. That connectedness is what makes Naruto's storyline so brilliant (and the politics. I'm a sucker for well done politics).   edit OP could be condensed into the East Blue > Grand Line Arc, the Nico Robin Arc, the Rescue Ace arc, and the dressrosa arc and we'd be none the wiser. Those are the only ones that have really mattered."
Naruto,3di6pm,swarbles,2,Thu Jul 16 14:47:17 2015 UTC,It would seem OP plays fast and loose with the concept of fillers.
Naruto,3di6pm,brownarrows,2,Thu Jul 16 16:04:50 2015 UTC,"To be honest, some of the flaws that you find in One Piece are also very noticeable in Naruto, although sometimes in a different way.  Can't say much about the world as I think it comes to personal liking, as both worlds are radically different. Although I don't think Naruto's world is that well constructed or that the politics make that much sense. Both worlds have a lot more potential than any of the mangas really used, One Piece is a gigantic world, but with a really simplified system, whilst Naruto is not that big of a world, or at least the part of the world where the story takes place, but it is way too complicated for how concentrated around the same area everything is.  I also aren't a fan of Oda's style of setting every battle, and then show it one chapter at a time each, I do prefer the Naruto way here, were they concentrate in the same battle until it is ended for most of the time. However, I don't think that Naruto is more straightforward in the plot. Even if One Piece battles are all taking place, and are being shown at the same time, they are all happening in the same place, with the same cause, and each saga has a closure, whilst in Naruto, you inmediately jump from one place to another, the characters are almost never in the same place. For years the action was always divided between the Naruto group, and the Sasuke group, and in my opinion that took away a lot of the interest on the series, because it was never clear where the plot was going as it was jumping from both groups constantly, making it hard to follow weekly, as you could spend months without knowing a word about Sasuke, or viceversa.  About themes and characters, I think the themes are pretty much the same in both series, and I wouldn't say that any of the series has really good characters, most of them are pretty bland and one-dimensional.  Again tone is personal preference, can't say much about it, although I'd say that One Piece is more obscure than you seem to think. Luffy may say that Arlong made Nami cry, but we all know she's been tortured for years. Also, One Piece world is anything but a happy place. Luffy is a happy person that is true, but if Kishimoto showed that the ninja world is fucked up, Oda has also showned several times that both the marines and the pirates suck. Both main characters, Naruto and Luffy are islands of good behaviour and innocence in a world full of shitty people and shitty rules.  Naruto made it's plot very straightforward, however new shit was always appearing, and thus it also seemed like the plot wasn't advancing. To put an example, they knew they had to take down Akatsuki because they wanted to (oversimplification) dominate the world. How much time it took for them to do so? They started well in the Kazekage arc and the two guys who attacked shikimaru's group (sorry it's been too many years and I don't remember their names), but then it started to drag a lot, with a lot of useless, although cool, stories that went nowhere, the best example being the Pain Arc.    edit OP could be condensed into the East Blue > Grand Line Arc, the Nico Robin Arc, the Rescue Ace arc, and the dressrosa arc and we'd be none the wiser. Those are the only ones that have really mattered.   This is an oversimplification and you know it. Firstly because if we take the arcs as you say it, those are gigantic arcs. Only in anime form the East Blue is 50 episodes, the Grand Line Arc, which I assume is Alabasta is like another 50, The Nico Robin arc is more than 100 and the same with both Rescue Arc and Dresrossa.  You really are lefting out only Thriller Bark and Skypiea, which are the two arcs that pretty much every one piece fan also discusses if they were useless or not, although I liked them a lot.  Well, this was longer than I expected it to be..."
Naruto,3di6pm,Arvediu,2,Thu Jul 16 16:40:12 2015 UTC,"This is a really good post. To be clear - I don't disagree with anything that you have said. just personal preference. well said though. I agree that we've seen the faults of the world structure, but not to the extent as in Naruto.  And yes, the condensed arcs would take us from 800 chapters to around, 500? which I think would be great."
Naruto,3di6pm,swarbles,10,Thu Jul 16 17:03:33 2015 UTC,"Short version :  Naruto or even Bleach have imo a faster pace, a better character development, better fights, and a cleaner story to follow. One piece is somehow confusing and not stable.   Don't get me wrong, I like One Piece, but since Ace died, I found the new arcs very disappointing and long for no reason, too much random talks, not really any progress appearing ( at least for me ), the crew still seems as weak as before, the battles are really long and Oda is falling back into his old habit while the other mangakas of his time actually evolved their stories.   Oda is just using again and again the same recipe :   Crew goes to island A -> Some problem appears on Island A -> Crew decides to fight and help people -> They succeed a little but big boss and his evil crew appear -> Nice Crew is having some difficult time -> Evil crew splits, so does Nice Crew -> Each crew member having a 1v1, while ofc Sanji and Zoro taking care of the stronger opponents -> Luffy fights nicely at first against the big boss because of a random power up, then gets dominated or exhausted, then dominates again and that's the end.   I just don't feel the story progressing at all in One Piece, same for the character development, which only existed at the time when he actually looked for members or when Ace was captured, but they didn't recruit anyone since their training of 2years and spoilers."
Naruto,3di6pm,Yoshiji,9,Thu Jul 16 14:28:20 2015 UTC,"Never seen One Piece. Heard is as full of fillers as Naruto. I can tell you though that I liked Naruto at first because he was so opposite to all animes that I was watching at the time.  I mean, usually you would have your main protagonist to be the strongest, smartest, or most brave, the one that comes to the battlefield and prooves to be the strongest and saves everyone.   At first, back in Naruto original series times, Naruto was so opposite to this. I mean, he always shows himself to want to be that character, but as he lacks the strength or maturity, he fails tremendously. And most of the times causes more complications that his friends have to solve for him. That kind of character felt so real to me it just got me hooked.   The main story, the retrieval of Sasuke, the campagin of Naruto to save his friend from drakness, also hits me really deep in my heart as I too had to go through the same kind of feelings with a friend that was suffering from depression. My friend now thanks me everyday for always having stuck around and never giving up on her.   Having Naruto now as and adult in Gaiden, seeing how much he grew up from that kid that would not get any attention and would missbehave and be a mess. Is so reassuring, so satisfying. I love the fact that we were able to follow his life step by step and see his dreams come true through effort and dedication. It is very inspiring."
Naruto,3di6pm,maurodsimone,5,Thu Jul 16 15:34:58 2015 UTC,"When I was a kid (I'm 22 now, btw) I've watched few eps of OP when it was aired here, and I didn't find it interesting, even one bit (please don't hate me, OP fans), probably due to I don't know what's going on. However, when I was able to watch a few eps of Naruto, it greatly caught my attention for some reason, and I know what's going on in each ep. Take note that I wasn't able to watch the beginning of those series. Up until right now, I'm still not interested with OP despite having reached 800+ chapters. As for Naruto, I love it so much that I've downloaded all the chapters, episodes, and even the OSTs and the songs! :P"
Naruto,3di6pm,Takagi_,4,Thu Jul 16 16:14:19 2015 UTC,"I love both (more naruto) the main reason is that in one piece it takes too much time to get to the really good parts, there have been some arcs that I found really boring and they take too much time to make you care about characters that won't appear again.  In naruto we have a final fight in every arc that is 100% relevant to the plot."

Naruto,3di6pm,DoubleHunter,-8,Thu Jul 16 14:45:17 2015 UTC,Dude trust me watch one piece the plot is so much better and you get much more emotionally attached to the characters. The world building is just so much bigger and better and their is a lot of content to go through. The start is a lit slow (20 episodes) but from then on it just gets better and better. Nauto was good but then shippuden was just bad. One piece is also more meaningful with friendship although naruto is good at that too. But overall naruto can't compare to One piece greatness and its godlevel story.

Naruto,3di6pm,TheAmillion12,5,Thu Jul 16 14:02:02 2015 UTC,I watched one piece up to the going marry needing to be repaired (episode 233). The thing about one piece that made me stop is that nobody dies in that series.  Luffy just kicks his enemies ass and then after they just walk away for another day.    There is no heaviness to the series like naruto where people are literally killed or sacrificed for the plot.  Stuff like that is also why I enjoy attack on titan so much.  That impending sense of doom that your favorite character could die at any moment.    One piece is just to clean hearted.  I got sick of nakama nakama Luffy power up everyone survived for another day.
Naruto,3di6pm,read-it-too,-11,Thu Jul 16 14:22:54 2015 UTC,OK if you kept watching you see that one of the main characters dies. Everybody's favorite character is killed off and so many others die. It has more deaths than naruto where even if you die it has no meaning because you can be reincarnated
Naruto,3di6pm,idontevenknowbrah,9,Thu Jul 16 14:34:26 2015 UTC,"Saying that we have more deaths in OP than Naruto is just plain wrong.   Even if random background characters' deaths might be more important in OP (which we don't care because they're mostly here to show a liter of blood),  we have a lot more important deaths in Naruto.   Look at the beginning of each adventure : At the first Naruto's arc, we have both Haku and Zabuza dying.  In one piece: All villains are in fact captured ( we can see that on the scans ), the first real deaths of main characters are actually Ace and White Beard (flashback deaths are just here for the background, and we have plenty more in Naruto than OP knowing we had a great ninja war etc..)."

We're not getting more meaningful character moments or development at this point; it's just being stretched. I don't think, for instance, that the relationship between Luffy and Zoro has show anything new in the last five years that we didn't see in the previous five. And it bothers me that Luffy's brother died and he was just gifted another one. Ace's death was the first non-black border death perhaps in the entire series, yet it feels undone. And I don't think that any of the newer arcs have topped Skypeia, Enis Lobby, Alabasta, or even Arlong Park."

There's nothing wrong with having a turtle, or a slug, or an ape, or a rhino beetle in your lineup of monsters. There's no rule in the book that says they have to look ""cool"", which is highly subjective anyway.   I don't think Shukaku looks cool but that doesn't detract from his aesthetics. I rather like the look of Isobu. Son Goku is an obvious tribute to a series the mangaka loves. Saiken is meh, but so is Gyuki to me honestly. I love Choumei's design, looking at it is very mind-fucky at first which makes him the only thing in the lineup to properly fit the monster bill (ushi-onis and kitsunes are, like, so overdone).

He's quiet for a reason.   Many others are the same way, Itachi held the burden of slaughtering his entire clan to save his little brother, whom he loved so much but had to pretend to hate him to make him hate him back.

If this were true, then why are there so many weak Genin from The Hidden Mist Village in the war? Shouldn't they all be like bloody killers who would have pretty much killed all White Zetsu's themselves? I mean, I find it pretty difficult to believe that Chojuro did something like that.   After Zabusa's ...actions they changed the system. IIRC, Kakashi explained that."
Naruto,3dc376,henne-n,10,Wed Jul 15 10:37:39 2015 UTC,And kids that's where fodder ninja come from.
Naruto,3dc376,mihirkhatwani,11,Wed Jul 15 12:37:09 2015 UTC,"In the bloody mist you were paired 1v1 for a fight to the death to graduate to genin.  From what i can see on the wiki, the best of those was then named candidates to become swordsmen of the mist, Zabusa killed the whole class meaning... he became THE candidate for the swordsmen. And after that the killing eachother tradition was discontinued. (Though it says it took some time after becoming genin to be a swordsman)"
Naruto,3dc376,b14m3m3,2,Wed Jul 15 12:32:30 2015 UTC,"I also thought he was not actually in the genin class, he supposedly just showed up and killed the entire class."

This is a world where instead of going to school, you learn techniques to kill people if you show the potential to be able to do so. All of the main characters live in an insane reality, and that's exactly why Hashirama, Madara, Obito, and eventually Naruto wanted to create a new system where this bloodshed would no longer exist."

Naruto,3dc376,lucinator6198,1 point,Wed Jul 15 13:46:24 2015 UTC,"Itachi and Obito had a conversation on the evening of the massacre, where Obito agreed to help Itachi eliminate the Uchiha as long as Obito didn't touch Sasuke.  Why would Itachi make him promise that if he was going to do the killing?  This implies that Obito did most of the killing."
Naruto,3dc376,GwiyomiPrincess,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:21:50 2015 UTC,Obito wanted to use his mangekyo to control all uchihas so he doesn't have to kill them. But danzo stopped him and even stole one eye from him. Afterwards he gave his other eye to itachi because he knew that danzo would come to take the second one too and killed himself probably. So he never got a chance to harm the uchiha clan anyway

Naruto,3dc376,Shisui_1994,3,Wed Jul 15 19:58:28 2015 UTC,"Out off all the friendly characters we've seen (konoha 11, their teachers, family, exam proctors, etc.)  I'm willing to bet that at least a hand full of them would attack and kill innocents if they were ordered to do so by their hokage.  It's easy to forget that all ninja are straight up soldiers and not just people doing good things because thats that they like to do.  Luckily we only really see them do that stuff but thats because it just so happens thats all they've every been ordered to do.  This isn't to say that they'd all do it smiling, im sure a lot of them would disagree and complain but ultimately I think a lot of them would obey.  After all to most of them being a ninja is everything.  If they disobeyed and got discharged or declared rouge they'd have no fallback plan."
Naruto,3dc376,BioshockedNinja,11,Wed Jul 15 18:30:35 2015 UTC,"The original plan, should Itachi have not massacred the clan, was for Konoha to kill them all anyway, including the children such as Sasuke. Even if they didn't know anything, they were unknowingly dragged into the conflict. What do you think would happen when they see shinobi of their own village slaughter their own parents and relatives? They'd detest and hate the village, it would only cause more enemies and rebellions in the future. Danzo proposed to Itachi that he kill the clan himself in order to spare Sasuke, and only Sasuke. This takes the blame off Konoha and does not have Sasuke grow up to hate the village while stopping war and preserving the clan's honor as non-traitors. So all in all, I think Itachi did kill the other infants and children"
Naruto,3dc376,AbidingTruth,3,Wed Jul 15 02:55:40 2015 UTC,Then there would have been more Uchiha

Naruto,3ddl89,papa_smurphy,6,Thu Jul 16 03:25:56 2015 UTC,"Kurama stayed with Naruto because they developed a bond. They are friends. He is there by choice.. He didn't want to admit that he wanted to go back to Naruto and was getting embarrassed. To give him a little nudge Hagoromo asked Kurama to become the  ""meeting manager"" and Kurama pretended like he had no choice.  Because of this, it would be wrong to just seal Kurama in to the next generation unless it was entirely his choice and Naruto wouldn't let that happen to Kurama."
Naruto,3ddl89,Xtremis92,4,Wed Jul 15 20:00:58 2015 UTC,"He will more than likely be set free, but stay close in case shit goes down"
Naruto,3ddl89,Spartn90,6,Wed Jul 15 15:26:41 2015 UTC,"Kurama has changed, hes no longer the demon fox, hes a citizen of the hidden leaf. MOST likely kurama will be passed down again to the next in line.   the other tailed beast are roaming free, as time progresses its possible they maybe captured but thats a fact they have accepted.   the 8 tails will also like naruto's be passed down to the next heir."
Naruto,3ddl89,sacuna151,7,Wed Jul 15 13:50:06 2015 UTC,I don't see why they would pass him down. If he isn't a threat anymore then why keep him caged up?
Naruto,3ddl89,AFatz,3,Wed Jul 15 15:24:32 2015 UTC,"Not sure if it's a fact or anything, but don't the hosts help bring out the full potential of the beasts and visa versa?  If that's the case then keeping Kurama bonded with Naruto's descendants (Sage blood, yo!) would prove to be useful in case anything happened."

Naruto,3ddl89,MrSmook,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:07:14 2015 UTC,"I also think its not very likely. The most plausible one that came to my mind would be to gain power and control over others, selfish reasons. The fact that only Uchiha are able to control them is something I didnt think about, but I always thought a godlike genjutsu user should be able to control them too if they wanted"
Naruto,3ddl89,Zinouweel,2,Thu Jul 16 05:18:25 2015 UTC,All other Juubi's aside from Gyuki and Kurama are free. Kurama and Gyuki will probadly be set free aswell after Naruto and Bee die.
Naruto,3ddl89,FailerQt,2,Wed Jul 15 13:52:01 2015 UTC,"I think Konoha would do whatever Kurama wanted. Maybe he really likes another ninja and wants to help him (as well as assist in continuing to provide that meeting place for all the bijuu). Or maybe he really wants his freedom. Either way, I think he's more likely to be treated like everyone else and no longer like a dangerous weapon."
Naruto,3ddl89,swarbles,2,Wed Jul 15 20:45:55 2015 UTC,"Apart from what's already been said, the reason Kurama is staying with Naruto is because Naruto can be the meeting point for all the Biju since he has Chakra from all the Biju. Once Naruto dies there is not reason for Kurama to stay inside another host.  And seeing how all other tailed beasts were let go I think it is more upto the Ninja villages than nations."
Naruto,3ddl89,mihirkhatwani,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:06:53 2015 UTC,"The Fire Country doesnt have a say in the matter. The villages themselves created the jinchuriki. So the Hokage is the one who decides what to do with Kurama. And since the only ones not roaming free are Kurama and Gyuki, because they chose to stay with their hosts, i'd say that Kurama and Gyuki would have the choice of going free, or if someone was willing to be Jinchuriki, and the bijuu agreed, they could do that."
Naruto,3ddl89,papa_smurphy,1 point,Thu Jul 16 03:29:02 2015 UTC,My headcanon is that he's gonna sleep inside of Naruto's hollow stone head up on the big hokage mountain just kinda waiting for trouble to be a brewing so he can help out.

Besides chuunin aren't that strong, I mean look at Kiba, he's a chuunin, and honestly hasn't done much in battle. He's probably still as strong as Part 1 Naruto and weaker than Part 1 Sauske."
Naruto,3dd2km,Bachi-Trust,3,Wed Jul 15 11:56:01 2015 UTC,"First of all Kiba isn't ""not strong"" his attack style is just too direct and its not very flashy. Not only that but Kiba during the chunnin still had to battle enemies during the scroll search.   It's likely that when Iruka was taking the exam he would have had to eventually face other ninja 1v1 and fight for scrolls on other teams. All the while, he has to demonstrate that he has the capacity to make strategies, lead shinobi squads, and other chunin level duties.  Becoming Chunin is kind of a big deal, there isn't much of an excuse for a Chunin to be weak."

Iruka, as a Chunin, should have more to him, and that's OP's point - he's shockingly incompetent as a Chunin. He's literally displayed nothing more than basic academy graduate skills. It's just strange is all."

Naruto,3d8kyg,takahashia16,10,Tue Jul 14 10:14:58 2015 UTC,"How i'd like it:  Like you the customization should be extensive in terms of the the character (but this should pretty much be a given for all MMO's)  The whole stat and affinity should be decided upon reaching Genin rank, which should allow any player as academy student be able to try everything and get a basic understanding of everything before making big decisions regarding what type of player they want to be.  So academy student u don't know any affinity. Genin you get your main affinity, Chunin secondary affinty, and Jounin another secondary affinity... (growth patterns make you want to keep achieveing that milestone)  Villages are a good, and there should be events with wars between them (I'm not sure about the specifics of what you should be fighting for and how yet(Maybe land? some kind of rewards i dunno)). And you can create some kind of Chuunin exams to pair up the villages  Inside villages there could be clans, with each specialty, this could be an affinity or some kind of focus in a stat or for that matter a kind of style/jutsu (like gentle fist, hyuuga), and clans should be joinable at chuunin rank. I know you are all thinking ""what chunin?! that doesn't make any sense"", but instead of the whole birth into a clan, i'd want it be a milestone to unlock along with improving skills. (I'm not sure if you could maybe get an additional clan for Jounin) Examples: If you are a taijutsu master you can join a clan, that perhaps uses gentle fist, so you can learn some skills that disables enemy ninjutsu for a short while.  If you are Water as primary nature, and wind as secondary, you can maybe join a wind clan, making wind a another primary element. primary water + primary wind = Ice  The whole ""special chakra thing"" like senjutsu, Fuinjutsu and medical(for healing poisons during missions and the like, while i'd like normal healing should be achieved somewhere earlier) can be additional things to unlock as Jounin or special Jounin, to have special tasks or something at Jounin level missions.  I would for the sake of balance remove the whole Tailed beast thing, simply for balance. If included you can create story lines within the village for them maybe, or make them be in territories that villages can fight for. But mainly removing it from player specific content (It would most likely create more hassle than benefit sadly).  Sry for the wall of text and I bet there are a buttload of typoes in there."
Naruto,3d8kyg,b14m3m3,-1,Tue Jul 14 13:49:12 2015 UTC,"Chunin secondary affinty, and Jounin another secondary affinity...    Keep in mind Kakashi explains to Naruto only Jounnins may reach their secondary affinity, and that is not even that common. Much less for a Chunnin."

Naruto,3d8kyg,swarbles,9,Tue Jul 14 15:45:52 2015 UTC,Or we could just revive pockie ninja
Naruto,3d8kyg,bbubles,7,Tue Jul 14 11:22:26 2015 UTC,"Pockie Ninja was an enjoyable game in its own way, but if a new Naruto MMO were to be announced, it's pretty much exactly what I wouldn't want the game to be like.  In a Naruto MMO, I'd be primarily interested in character creation and combat. I'm not under the impression Pockie Ninja had any character creation, and its combat was that of a 2D fighting game. In a hypothetical Naruto MMO, I'd prefer if combat was on a 3D playing field, and more open than the storm games. That way, you can make use of the environment, like running on walls and trees. I'd also find character creation/customization extremely important, so I can make the sexy Uchiha I've always dreamed of creating.   Pockie Ninja didn't intend to do those things, of course, so no fault on that game. I definitely wouldn't take it as a replacement for a well-done Naruto MMO, though."
Naruto,3d8kyg,Kaonis,3,Tue Jul 14 11:50:43 2015 UTC,"Here's my take on how this game should be structured. I am going to talk about big aspects of the game, not specific numbers. See if you like it.  Rank Your character starts as a child. Academy Student. As you level up you grow up and you unlock the chance (through missions) to rank up from Gennin to Jounnin. After Jounnin you may specialize and become an AMBU.   Starting village As everyone says, where you start should have perks that incline your character torwards certain type of jutsu and certain chakra natures. This is an obvious one. I think it should be important though that also certain clans are available in certain villages only. (Nara clan belongs to Konoha only, but Temari's clan belongs to Sunagakure and so on).   Chakra Nature On the note of your starting village there is a concept that should be looked into. The discovery of your charka nature should take a chapter of its own. Remember only jounnin level ninjas may have two specializations. And only select characters in the series show to have 3 or more specializations. On this same note we should talk about all forms of Kekkei-genkai. About this matter I really have no solid idea how to introduce the concept without it being imbalanced. It obviously should be an unlockable only after you reach a very high level of your chakra nature and skills and ranking.   Starting clan You may choose to belong to a clan (it should be optional). Or maybe create your own family name. This last optio should come with some starting boost so that it is balanced. My idea would be as follows. If you start from a known clan family, like Nara or Uchiha or Huuyga, your jutsu skills tree is somewhat fixed (i.e. if you start out as a Nara, your character will only be able to scale jutsu skills from the Nara family). Whereas if you don't belong to any clan your justu skill tree is open to any variety (without access to clan's skills but giving you the chance to have mor variety of jutsu at your disposal). Making it more interesting to play.   Specialization This is a nobrainer as well. You specialize in Taijutsu, Ninjutsu or Genjutsu. I imagine a system very much like Elder Scrolls. Where the more you use one or the other you become more proficient and unlock new perks for it.   Secondary profession/specialization  Much like in WoW, you may learn a secondary specialization/profession. This is where I would introduce any kind of supporting role like healer or detector.   Story progression/timeline In this aspect I would take again the same approach as in WoW. The game should begin in the 3rd era maybe (it is a suggestion) and the game the villages appearence and the Kages in charge should change with every upcoming expansions.  Uchiha/Huuyga I feel I should make a note about these two clans. Personally I feel no reason why people would not want to belong to either of these clans. In the series they are probably the most powerful clans judging from their skills. I saw some suggestions that these clans should not be eligable or that they should be an option only available if you pay for it. I do not agree with that. But I do think there should be some serious consideration to have these clans be interesting to play but not overpowered (even if that is not the case compared to the series). Otherwise the game will end up with most players belonging to these clans.   Monetization Yes, we would all wish this game was entirely F2P, but lets be serious, if the game producers, designers, developers and testers don't make money out of it, they are not going to do it. I think LoL/Dota/CSGO monetization model works the best overall. That is to make it into a F2P but to be able to buy cosmetic personalization through IRL money. This would be for special clothers or hair or face types or makeup or maybe even specialized kunais or weapons.   Sorry for the long post, it is after all a big project that I have been thinking about with some friends."
Naruto,3d8kyg,maurodsimone,2,Tue Jul 14 14:44:19 2015 UTC,"How would you handle the 'growing up' feature later on during the higher levels? Maybe have it so that your character can actually die at some point keep some sort of ''legacy family tree'' system have children and keep going on that new character?   Making your own family name and having a starting boost of your choice is way too unfair. People would choose the options that will benefit them already and begin min-maxing before the endgame.  Hyuuga and Uchiha can still be balanced. Maybe clan skills force players to go a certain route? So no matter how bad you want to use ninjutsu as a Hyuga, you will have to incorporate taijutsu specifically the Gentle Fist art so that you can be competent in PVE/PVP. (This way those who are part of clans are somewhat pidgeonholed into a certain playstyle, not fixed. So its possible to be like Neji but use summoning techniques, but no further than that as you still need taijutsu.)  Storyline timewise should take place during the time of Naruto Part I, except its an Era of Warring States period so different groups rise and fall, the expansions idea with changing village appearances sounds pretty cool but I think that would only work until a certain point when technology has become a big thing and that will push away a lot of the fans.  F2P I personally think will not work for a game like this. Attracts immature audiences, less money for important things such as servers and bugfixes, less content coming out and an eventual pay-to-win once interest in the cosmetics has died down (which is has on several games). The B2P model (with a 7 day free trial) I believe is the perfect way for people to try out the game. The Lol/Dota/CSGO model work because they aren't even MMOs, they're FPS's and MOBA's."
Naruto,3d8kyg,maurodsimone,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:03:26 2015 UTC,"How would you handle the 'growing up' feature later on during the higher levels?    You mean becoming ""too old""? I think at some point you would stop ""growing up"". What I meant by the grow up thing was, you obviously cannot be an academy student if you are 25 ish Y/o. It would be WEIRD and creepy. Your character should start as a child and then you would get to modify its model a couple of times as he grows up to a certain point.    Making your own family name and having a starting boost of your choice is way too unfair.   I didn't mean this. I said there should be a benefit to start your own lets call it ""family/clan"" so that it is also interesting. Otherwise you would have only Uhihas and Hyuugas runing around IMO. One idea I came about was, if your PJ would belong to a certain clan, then your skill/jutsu tree could only expand upon the jutsu/skills from that clan. You could not deviate. Whereas if you would be a ""free of clan ninja"" you would have open regular options that you could mix up to create your own skillset. When I said boost I means maybe starting with a little more gold/coins/ryo or something of the sort.    This way those who are part of clans are somewhat pidgeonholed into a certain playstyle, not fixed. So its possible to be like Neji but use summoning techniques, but no further than that as you still need taijutsu   Yes, that's what I meant.    but I think that would only work until a certain point when technology has become a big thing and that will push away a lot of the fans.   Sure sure. As I said in the beginning I am talking about big concepts, not too many details. But it is important to have a gameplan of how it is going to develop. Even if it is a gross concept. I took the idea from WoW that made interesting landscape changes with some expansions.   F2P I personally think will not work for a game like this. Attracts immature audiences, less money for important things such as servers and bugfixes, less content coming out and an eventual pay-to-win once interest in the cosmetics has died down (which is has on several games).   I agree with you entirely, but if you look at TWO BIG MMORPGS that came out lately that you would swear they would never go B2P (Elder Scrolls Online and Starwars The Old Republic) they were not at all that succesful. And the had to change policies and go to the model I describe. Nowadays any MMORPG that is not WoW usually has a really hard time because it gets compared to hard.  I don't think I can recall a famous MMORPG that came out lately that was successful in keeping their B2P model. Maybe Destiny? Was that a cool game? DBZ Xenoverse, but is that for PC?  Thanks for your imput as well, hope I answered all your questions."
Naruto,3d8kyg,maurodsimone,2,Tue Jul 14 18:19:50 2015 UTC,"About the clans, if everyone had the option to start their own clan, they would all make some clan name that doesn't fit with the series and it would sound like something coming from an OC, I can imagine some of the most immature clan names being a part of the game. In MMORPGs, players love to be unique and if that means playing as a Nara or Akimichi, by all means they will do so. If you wanna specialise in summoning then Uchiha/Hyuga wouldn't be a good choice, but clanless would. Imagine how similar every Hyuga/Uchiha would be. The clan system I think of is one which discourages versatility and encourages a specific playstyle which will encourage players to go clanless unless they absolutely want the clan abilities.   Landscape changes would be a bit odd from an expansion than realtime. I would rather have two huge factions have a big war and the actual battlefield can be shown as a wasteland instead of buying a $10 expansion to see the differences. Also it wouldn't make sense seeing as one person would see one thing while someone else would see another. Unless you mean seperated players and its instanced to those who have the expansion, that just makes the population decrease drastically, making the game feel empty when in reality players are being split apart by an expansion. Changes to the world should be permanent, resources should be taken into account. Does a faction want the sand village for its harsher climates for protection? Or the fertile soils of the land of lightning so they have sustainable food? Then actual changes are made to those places.  Both ESO and SWTOR are far better off with the B2P model, which is different from what you described (F2P + Cash shop). The only reason most MMOs aren't B2P is because there have rarely been B2P's in the past, its becoming more and more accepted within the MMO community and it makes sense, its the perfect balance (in most cases) for an MMO. Guild Wars 2 is going strong and has the expansion coming out, this is the result of B2P and when you compare that with another cosmetic-filled MMO/MMO that sells P2W items, B2P simply is the better choice for longevity and functionality. Destiny wasn't even an MMO, it was meant to be a 'hybrid' of that and an FPS but used the worst aspects of MMOs (RNG, constant gear grinds etc.)."

Yeah, this is going to happen anyways. As long as you allow any kind of imput from a player you are going to have this happen. If not when naming a clan, when namming their own character. In any case I didn't mean create a clan; I meant have your character not belong to any known clan, sort of ""be your own clan, be a normal ninja"". Wich is something very real in the Naruto universe, not every character comes from a famous bloodline. This would open up the possibilities for players to create their own style of fighting within the bounderies of jutsus that are of common use.    Landscape changes would be a bit odd from an expansion than realtime.   I meant changes like adding more stoneheads in Konoha for every Hokage, changing the Kages to match the period of time, changes like that, not to open areas.    Both ESO and SWTOR are far better off with the B2P model, which is different from what you described   No they were not. That's why they admitted they changed to a F2P model.

Not saying you knocked my shit, but no as other-in depth answers were given. (Copy/paste my post from that other submission)  I have ALWAYS wanted a game like this. I remember playing clash of ninja on gamecube and wanting so badly to make my own character. If they added the character customization (which personally, I think 1000% heart and soul would have to go into that specifically for originality of each shinobi. Sliders would give the biggest range of options for an mmo like that.), PvP battles Something Xenoverse-esque, but with a 3 man squad, so 3v3 fights, OR how fucking fun does 12 v 12 sound?! It'd be graphics intense, but wouldn't it be oh so worth it?! You could challenge a player or squad to one, and then load into a map selection screen.) Obviously the open world mechanics would be interesting to think about. Something I cant even touch on. Even in 3 v 3, if it were after every player unlocked their chosen Kekkei Genkai, just imagine the fast paced absolute mayhem carnage. So mix all that with the ""choose your attacks"" from Xenoverse, and whatever element you chose.. Just.. Take my money, my first born, and my soul. I would looovee to see a lightning tunneling fang, or a masterful mix of mokuton style and fire style. ice/fire/whatever covered throwing weapons for extra damage.  Building off what others said, choosing your villiage, specialty, elemental type (it would determine the jutsus you could learn, and the visual effects. Imagine a blazing rasengan!), and even a kekkei genkai to be unlocked once you reach a certain level and know enough jutsus/combo moves. Depending on what Kekkei Genkai you chose, you start out having an affinity towards a certain element and fight style, but that wouldnt mean you can't mold/change it. EG: Sharingan/MS would mean you'd start with basic knowledge of fire attacks, something a puppet master or taijutsu specialist may have to work up to. Each would have starting perks. It would just be a stepping stone, or a way to decide what KG you want for endgame jutsu combos.  There could even be an economy/crafting/gathering and hunting system. Ninja tools, food pills, meals that give temp stat buffs.. Everything COULD be made by players. Materials? You'd need to go pick certain herbs for food pills or maybe hunt animals for their various items to be used in the crafting/gathering tree. Hell, you could even make weapons, armor, whatever, so long as you have the materials necessary. Too lazy for all that? Go check out a market board in one of the villages sprawled across the vast land."
Naruto,3d8kyg,Chokokage,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:09:11 2015 UTC,"I have not read your post, but I'm loving your ideas here.  I would love collaboration abilities that require high levels of skill and a good amount of compatibility after playing with the other person for a while.  The PVP is something I find very interesting, some people want arenas whilst others want Xenoverse like you mention. But for a sandbox game I think the best PVP route is the open-world one. One which directly ties in to the ecnomy and crafting systems and which leads to your clan/group having more power. Maybe there's a huge battle going on where you and your organisation are duking it out with other groups for control over a certain village. Take this situation:  Group 1 is allied with Group 2 and they make up the majority of the Sand Village, the Kazekage is a member of Group 2 but Group 1 have been plotting with Group 3, who are from the Mist Village, to overthrow Group 2. Secretely, Group 1 is part of the Mist Village and they have been at constant war with the Sand Village this entire time. The leaders of Group 1 and 3 decide to pay big money to the major clans from the Sand Village which they could not refuse after losing many resources at war with the neighbouring villages. Most major clans keep quite but some try to warn the Kazekage of the coup that will happen, but its too late as Group 1 and 3 dispatched elite ninjas to assassinate those people. Group 1 begins killing major members of the Sand Village including the elders and the leader of Group 1 kills the Kazekage, claiming the title for himself. Before the other loyal clans can help, Group 3 come charging in after the confusion and kill off all the other people loyal to that Kazekage.   If the game was hardcore where you die and lose your character, these situations would be big stuff."
Naruto,3d8kyg,Tevs4-04,1 point,Wed Jul 15 12:54:35 2015 UTC,"That's actually a great idea for permadeath scenarios, but i doubt people would want to play a permadeath naruto game with people running around at high levels, using their sharingans and fire styles. Haha.  BUT.. I really would want an open world sandbox game. The 1v1 or 3v3 pvp would be an arranged battle, where every player knows screens will change to something like a xenoverse or storm map select screen to fight on. As for actual WARS.. That'd be incredibly graphics intensive. Even a mere 30 v 30 (PCs would explode) would be chaotic on the actual sandbox map itself. I'd think some sort of arena would be better suited for that, since there's people all around levelling up on whatever creatures or fodder. Not necessarily a LITERAL arena, but maybe the 4th great war Battlefield for huuuuge scale fights. It could be a separate loading entity so all the jutsus flying wont lag the main servers.  Edit: A lot of the MMOs I played, unless it was 1v1 pvp, had a separate loading are for mass/clan/group pvp. It's because if you have 60 people throwing out high level jutsu, all creating the animation graphics for said jutsu, all having a physical prescence (like bullets in battlefield), then thats some serious lag for that entire area. Now just imagine if 8 or 9 were going on across the world.   OR.. I just thought of this, each land can be it's own area, meaning you'd have to pass a loading screen if you cross a land border, to go visit somewhere else, or you're too high a level for that area now, and your quests take you to another land. That'd be to help with lag, disperse the load a little. Hell, even Skyrim had areas you need to load into. So that being said, if a coup goes on, that villiage could be temporarily ""unloadable"" meaning nobody can enter, because there's a WAR going on inside. And inside the village, you could pretty much do everything a ninja does, wall climb, run fast as fuck, mid-air jutsus. Literally everything, but totally destroy buildings. (Think DCUO being able to fly/climb literally everywhere.) They could just appear as on fire and look severely damaged if the opposing clan or whatever wins. Now how do you fix that, you ask? In front of the respective Kage's mansion could be some sort of NPC that pops up as an advisor to the Kage, and that they're accepting any donations (money, stone, lumber, leather, different metals and ores), and it would literally take a community to build the village back. A very large amount of money and materials would be listed. So much, that it could take a week or two of everyone donating to get the village rebuilt."
Naruto,3d8kyg,Thatcouchhorse,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:32:49 2015 UTC,"Okay instead of huge battles maybe small skirmishes? This would be about ninjas and huge battles wouldn't make sense unless someone revives the Juubi and becomes the jinchuriki like Obito or Madara. So make stealth king in these kind of fights. Maybe two groups duke it out 10 v 5 but one group kept some of their stronger players hidden in the trees so that they can mislead the other group into thinking  theres only 5 of them. Or they hide in the trees to land sneak attacks that do big damage. A seperate loading screen wouldn't be very immersive IMO.  As for the Kage advisor, I'm loving this idea. But instead of the kage advisor, maybe the lords and the kage him/herself decide where the donations go and where the resources go to (academy, police, housing etc) and maybe they can form temporary alliances with groups who have those resources available to speed up recovery."
Naruto,3d8kyg,MasterMac94,2,Wed Jul 15 17:19:38 2015 UTC,"Responding with a second comment because word wall, my bad lol.  The missions you can do in a destroyed village should probably only rank up to B until you restore it. The market board would have more expensive prices, because.. What'd be the point if the prices were the same? There would be no push to restore your village. So basically everythings expensive (+20% onto everything ir something like that.) and your missions are limited to B, so if you want those hard bosses and that rare loot, better fix your village lolol.  The Alliances sound like a great idea. Depending on who you ally with, you could get discount prices on certain things, and raised prices on others. Theoretically, some villages may not approve of the alliance, and jack up their prices for those shinobi. It'd all be handled automatically though, so all price changes for the affected nations would take effect immediately, when a treaty is made. So.. Example. Otogakure and Sunagakure have an alliance. The proces for sand shinobi shopping in Sound would be lower, and visce versca. BUT.. The prices in Konoha would be exponentially higher for both. Sand allies with Konoha? Prices would be higher for Sound and lower in either place for either shinobi ally side."
Naruto,3d8kyg,jorgomli,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:55:02 2015 UTC,It would definitely make leaders think twice before attacking a village as they would have to deal with many consequences involved. Criminal organisations like the Akatsuki could establish bases and moles all over the world and can pull the strings when it comes to the economy. Then there's the important decision of alliances which may be broken and the Five Kage Summit which could be held after all 5 nations are in agreement with something(s).
Naruto,3d8kyg,maurodsimone,1 point,Thu Jul 16 09:31:11 2015 UTC,"Most MMO's have sectioned off areas simply because it'd probably constantly crash the servers to have hundreds of thousands of people in one giant clusterfuck map. It wouldn't really be done by choice, more-so to keep the mmo running smoothly for everyone around the world. Even FF:XIV has sectioned areas. Each area though, would be HUGE. MMO huge. I dont mean some measly 200x200 area, Imean huuuuge.  Village sizes would obviously vary since each village is different, but other than that, it would be a totally open world game. Basically area separation is to help the servers. The loading screen would be maybe 5-10 seconds tops to load you into the next area, then you can go on your way and kill shit or gather herbs, hunt, whatever.   Edit: Im saying a person kage is a bad idea out of experience, because the MMO Wakfu did that, and it made their in-game economy totally flip because people didnt like whoever was elected each time.  The skirmishes sound like a great idea. People could choose people with sensory or weaponry skills to hide, call out enemies, set traps, even throw weapons from the shadows to help other players. (forest of death) I dont think a kage should be a player SIMPLY because there are bots, hackers, boosters, etc, and thats just asking for trouble if someone/something like that becomes kage. I feel like the top dog positions shouldn't be obtainable by players. It could be a totally kage-tier npc you have to kill, alongside whatever players choose to help defend the village. To ""destroy"" the village, you'd have to wipe it clean. Once all the players respawn, and run their way back to the village, they can't access shops or their Kage until repairs are complete. They CAN access missions and a market board. (It'd halt progress and piss people off if you couldnt at least do THAT.) That also leaves room for missions FROM the kages themselves, since.. Sayyy.. The kage wont respawn until the village is fixed. Sort of forcing teamwork so you can get those awesome missions from your respective kage.  Edit 2: Now just because kages are NPC's doesn't mean you cant surpass them, since you have to kill them to secure a village. You'd just have to be extremely high level to attempt a 1v1 with the kage. Now a group of mid level players would obviously have a better chance, because other players will defend their kage. So 1v30? Even at kage level, chances are you'd get ripped a new one with 15+ people smacking you around with jutsus. AND, what if some of those add negative effects? Slow, bound to the ground (cant walk), temp sealed jutsu, fire/ice DoT, the possibilities are endless. It's basically promoting the teamwork aspect Naruto is known for."
Naruto,3d8kyg,Stretch127,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:29:47 2015 UTC,"Point made with the villages being instanced but not the world itself. Then other things like the bases of criminal organisations bases, housing and other stuff can be instanced too.  What will make bots/hackers Kages in the first place? Assuming the game has mobs and resources like Runescape, thats a good argument but bots and hackers would not risk their characters to go out and gather a buttload of resources when there's a permadeath scenario. This is why permadeath is a good thing, it forces people ot think twice before doing anything and skill and strategy wins. Then that same skill and strategy is rewarded with more powers but not so much that they can be immune to anything and can still get destroyed by a well planned low level player attack.  Back to the point, hackers could become Kage but MMORPGs have systems in place to check individual players and what programs they have on and when there's hundreds of thousands (possibly millions) of players on the game it becomes impossible to check for every single hacker. But this game involves individuals with a higher rank, i.e Kage and there's only 5 of them. Checking them alongside other major players who are at a high power stance would clear out the hackers and discourage any more hackers to be in the game. Then there's the B2P model which would discourage hackers further as they wouldn't spend money to end up having their account banned. From a hackers perspective, it becomes clear that they would only go so far before getting banned and wasting their money on getting power temporarily.  Also a player Kage IMO is a pretty good idea. Look at it this way:  The players from a village vote for the nominated Kages (Who can only be nominated after reaching a certain strength threshold, something Sannin level) and when the majority vote for Joe Hokage, there will always be those who are happy and those who aren't, thats just something you can't change. What can happen is if the Kage is someone who is corrupt, the majority will simply vote for someone else which will have major reprucussions for former Kage Joe who is now shunned by most because of how immature he behaved in that position.   This will make people think twice before doing bad as Kage and if they do plan to do bad then the Danzo route is the best route for them to go (working from the shadows, corrupt organisations, general scheming, etc.). If a Kage is known for being a really bad one and is ruining the villages economy, then there might be an assassination of the Kage, or a coup or even a mass exodus to another village swearing fealty to another Kage. This kind of system discourages dumb Kages and the majority would be able to actually make decisions that affect the world instead of randomised missions.  A NPC Kage on the other hand would be really weird. It just seems so out of place for a group of real life players to follow an NPC. What would the NPC do anyway? If the game is about Kage's warring with each other, then the Kage's give the commands and it can't be given by NPCs.   I've told someone else this and I'll say it again; player Kage is perfect for a permadeath scenario seeing as it has real impact on the whole village and creates thousands of different situations that can happen. Unpredictability is always good. Whereas missions given by NPC Kages would get repetitive fast. The only different way for a NPC Kage to be killed is by having them (like you said) killed in different ways which sounds very boring. Imagine making decisions as the player Kage, you consult the other player higher-ups and decide on where to spend money on improving/rebuilding (e.g. Academy for better training for lower level ninja, police force for better security, hospital for injured ninjas, the list goes on).   Then there's taxing on the ninja so the Kage can adjust it during different times. Maybe they are at war and need to tax the players more for faster recovery? Or they're at a prosperous state and barely need tax money? Then there's investments to the feudal lords of that respective countries land and they receive better resources from their farms and at a much faster rate? Or those farmlands were raided and destroyed by another village? Or the messages between the Kage's and Feudal Lords are intercepted and the notes are changed so that the Kage is decieved? Okay now I'm just going a little bit too far, but you get the point."
Naruto,3d8kyg,swarbles,2,Thu Jul 16 10:44:30 2015 UTC,"Ahhh.. THATS why you were stressing on permadeath. That actually makes a LOT of sense to do in a game like that now. I think you just sold me on a permadeath scenario hahaha.  BUT.. If it is permadeath, what if we had medical ninjas? They could be the only ones that can revive the dead, but at a great cost. I wouldn't say death for them like Chiyo, but maybe something like a temporary health cut. So say you have 200 hp. It costs 50 of your own to rez a player, but that hp is locked out and unrestorable for 24 hours, limiting the player to 3 or less revives a day. (assuming you're like.. AT LEAST Anbu level, skill wise. Saying kage level would be unfair. Medium level players need heals too lol) They could heal fatal wounds, cure various poisons and debuffs, Kai release mass genjutsu on groups of allies, restore hp, etc. Basically, they'd be the only ones that MIGHT be able to save a player whose HP has reached 0 if they have the skills to. I also think permadeath should have a bleedout clock. Say 5-10 minutes. So your allies MIGHT have a chance to save you if they rush you to a hospital in time.  In order to be a medical ninja though, would being voted in work? Otherwise everyone would just run around healing themselves constantly. Or maybe a healing nin cap? I like your voting system idea. That was the one mistake WAKFU made. People basically suffered 2 months until a new usually the same asshole was elected.. Again. But if you can vote people out, it would have to be a scheduled day and time with whoever is present. Otherwise people could just make newbie accounts in that village and go fuck over the votes for however long the polls are open.  As for the taxes and the kage being able to raise/lower that and item prices for the economy fluxuation, another great idea. I love player run economies, especially when you can make literally everytging for sale if you take the time to go raise your various gathering/hunting skills.  (Eg. woodcutting, herb picking, mining, etc. but the hunting would just be killing mobs for their horns, fur, etc.) That ended up being Wakfu's downfall, because with an idiot leader, he trolololed all the prices in the nation to like 1 mil for everything. Even level 1 newbie items. If you can vote out though, that shouldn't be a problem. Also, people can kill you if you're an ass and fuck up prices in a perma scenario. PERFECT grounds for a coup scenario! Omg. Absolutely perfect.  Edit: I do think there should be food shops, inns, hospitals, etc. Food would provide hour long buffs like +5% increased ninjutsu damage for 60 minutes. Hospitals can do the same as a healer, but they obviously aren't mobile, and would cost money. Healer nins would do it for free because they just want the xp. But a hospital would be great if no healer nins are around to help. ... Assuming you arent dead. Lol"
Naruto,3d8kyg,swarbles,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:47:55 2015 UTC,"Maybe the healing jutsu that Chiyo used can be ued by dedicated healer nins. Chiyo died because her life-force wasn't enough, so a good healer and someone with a large vitality (possibly an Uzumaki, just like the manga) can revive someone but they would be left in a critical condition like you said. To make things harder for the higher level players they might require more than 1 healing player based on their strength? Perhaps skilled fuinjutsu users can place a powerful healing seal on their body so that they can get a big auto heal during a critical condition.   About the organisations such as Akatsuki. What features would you want? Because I can definitely imagine carving out hideouts in caves or building hideouts, hiding them with a powerful genjutsu, uniforms like the Akatsuki. These big organisations can have goals to work towards, maybe they want to house the missing nin and provide a family for them? Or they want to capture the Three-Tails? perhaps they simply hold a grudge against one of the Kage and are dedicating all their resources to an assassination?   Another question I have is what do you think about the involvement of the Samurai? I personally think they should be a place of neutrality where players of different sides can't harm each other? Possibly a place to study the ways of the sword by the Samurai and become super powerful (after reaching a certain level of bukijutsu and kenjutsu?). Even holding the Five Kage Summit if everyone agrees so that they can make the big decisions about the other villages (Grass, Sound etc.)"

""Leveling up"" would have to be done through completing missions (essentially just Naruto verbiage for ""quests""). Mimicking the actual Naruto structure, you would start with D rank missions and move up in difficulty as you gained rank and ability. D, C, and B rank missions would be PvE based. Obviously we couldn't have every mission involve teams because it would be a pain, so you could complete these lower rank missions either alone or with a CPU-based team (Kind of like Guild Wars). Once you get up to high-B and A- and S- rank missions, you need to have a squad of other humans because the difficulty rises. Also, with A- and S- rank missions, like in actual Naruto, you will have a high chance of encountering enemy shinobi. Some of this can be PvE based, but what makes Naruto so cool is the political structure and the constant conflict - so some of these high rank missions could be a combination of PvE and PvP - where one team is trying to stop you from reaching an objective or it is a race to reach an objective first. All of these missions could be instanced, so that multiple teams can complete them at the same time and so that there is minimal influence from outside forces. PvP could come in another form as well: Pure PvP battle over contested territory. This would require devs constantly shifting battle zones and coming up with political scenarios that are causing conflict. Conflicted areas could have objectives for all involved sides to reach that leads to them ""winning"" that area and thus controlling it for a period of time. Along with that control could provide bonuses - extra XP, HP buffs, something along those lines. Planetside (note: NOT PS2) had a really cool system of controlling continents and linking conquering land to tangible benefits. Something along a lesser scale would be really cool. Combat would have to be done in real-time. It would have to be closer to WoW than Ultimate Ninja Storm, and mesh gear/experience with skill in terms of deciding the outcome of battles. Obviously each skill would have different effects - Genjutsu as CC, Ninjutsu and Taijutsu as DPS (ranged and melee), medical Jutsu as healing. At the highest level (Jounin/ANBU), completing difficult missions would have to give you items that boost your skills, thus allowing for post-game progression. Overall, the game would have to depart fairly significantly from Naruto. There would have to be less individualization with regards to skills, and standardization with regards to power levels. The biggest thing for me with a Naruto-MMO is that it is primarily PvP based. After all - conflict is the center of the Narutoverse."
Naruto,3d8kyg,TheHerny,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:07:04 2015 UTC,"I think missions should be decided by the current Kage and the whole teams thing sounds kinda cool, but what about missions that are randomly generated so that your given missions based on your current skills and the events that are happening in the Ninja world, so a espionage mission to take down another guild would be pretty damn awesome. Or a S-rank mission of capturing and sealing a Tailed Beast in player X given to the most powerful fuinjutsu users in the game (who are allied). I would prefer a system more similar to EVE. So everchanging territories and strategies that are created by faction leaders. Village heads would declare war on each other and grab land from each other. Rewards would include all the loot of your fallen foes (adding large amounts of risk and reward) and the most successful warlords will come out on top as the heads of the villages. I totally agree about combat but gear grinds shouldn't be the main form of endgame, it should be skill training. The best ninja were the ones with mastery over many things such as Kakashi and Jiraiya. So have the opportunity to slowly raise your skills that you neglected before (i.e. genjutsu and fuinjutsu) and increase your status and power in the world with your powerful weapons. PVE can still have a place in Naruto in the form of wildlife that exist and there's the sage regions which are home to overpowered animals. Then you got the Tailed Beasts who roam the lands.    I like alot of your points and I wish this were a real thing."
Naruto,3d8kyg,Scruffmcruff,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:13:08 2015 UTC,"Ohh fun, I like these suggestions.  So does this mean that you think the title of ""Kage"" should be bestowed on human-controlled people?  The only problem I see with skill grind as opposed to gear grind, is eventually you could end up with characters who are great at anything. By limiting it to a gear grind, you can effectively continue to specialize further. Otherwise you end up with endgame characters just being skill stacked all over the place.  Randomly generated missions would be really cool. Having a system in place to cause the world to be evolving, rather than stagnant, would be huge.  God damn, WHERE ARE THE GAME DEVELOPERS?!?! Someone needs to get this rolling...."
Naruto,3d8kyg,Ciniter,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:18:33 2015 UTC,"Point made with the skill grind, although a solution to this would be specialising in what your good at already. I.E discovering new nature transformations (e.g. Dust release for those who have extensively trained at the wind, earth and fire releases. There's plenty of things for people to further specialise in no matter what the field. Uchiha members working towards the unlocking of the Susano'o and other powerful techniques, senjutsu users trying to discover the everchanging location of the sage regions. Mount Myobokku might move around from time to time and is extremely hard to find for example.   Kage maybe would be like Presidency, so you get enough votes to win, propaganda, espionage you name it. Kage's can decide certain important missions, can change the infastructure of the village and decide important things with the Village Elders.  That said, what do you think about a hardcore server? So if you die, its done your dead and have to make a new character. It would certainly be very impactful on certain kinds of players who hold a position of power and end up dying because they were unpopular with criminal organisations (e.g. people who are like the Akatsuki)."
Naruto,3d8kyg,Ciniter,2,Tue Jul 14 18:46:57 2015 UTC,"Yeah those are good points. I like the ideas. I think hardcore servers are a really awesome idea too, because it would provide a limiter for how powerful a character could get based on the fact that you could actually die. The only thing I worry about is that Naruto, like a lot of manga, has some super-ultra-unbelievably-powerful characters that, if players were allowed to attain that level in said video game, could cause major imbalances.

Naruto,3d8kyg,Danbito,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:43:50 2015 UTC,"Like others have said a lot of players would choose to be affiliated with an ocular clan, but one way to make them less op would be to have a charge meter. For example if an Uchia would want to use the sharingan then the meter would have to be filled by fighting, then once activated the ability would allow automatic blocks and counters then one copy of a jutsu. For the hyuga the player could have the ability to block a random technique that opposing player has, and also attack a bit more efficiently(faster). Furthermore, a Nara could freeze an opponent all together and with the help of a different teammate inflict huge damage. Overall, I feel that each clan would have a special, meter fed that makes them special."
Naruto,3d8kyg,Ciniter,2,Tue Jul 14 20:04:41 2015 UTC,"Even with a timer, automatic  blocks and counters would be horrid balance. Balancing the Sharingan is tricky. I'm not sure how to go about copying jutsu with the sharingan, I just think it should allow you to not be limited in what jutsu you learn (clan jutsu and kekke genkai excluded). With hyuga characters attacking faster doesn't seem right, it would make more sense that whoever they attack (with gentle fist) has their chakra gauge go down. Your Nara idea is pretty spot on but not a complete freeze, just a temporary one that would allow for an opening to an attack."

Naruto,3d8kyg,SccsCats,2,Wed Jul 15 12:41:46 2015 UTC,"I would say make Mangekyo super tough to unlock. You would have to get a ""best friend"" which could be someone you've completed a ton of missions with, and then you would have to kill them, out at least watch them get killed. If you make death consequences really severe or permanent, very few people would accomplish this because other players would be hesitant to get close to an uchiha. Plus they could make it to where using the abilities puts stress on your body and rapidly drains chakra, and maybe even health to an extent. Plus, it would be interesting if the dojutsu became its own skill tree, so with a finite number of points, it could be hard to develop an op character."

Naruto,3d8kyg,SccsCats,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:35:49 2015 UTC,I don't think that Call of Duty is popular with Naruto fans.. Meter systems don't translate well with MMORPGs and a Chakra and Stamina bar would be better.
Naruto,3d8kyg,maurodsimone,2,Thu Jul 16 09:52:51 2015 UTC,"By meter I mean stamina bar like you said. I made a booboo. Also what I mean by the call of duty thing is that if people REALLY like something, they don't care about variety."

Naruto,3d8kyg,maurodsimone,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:15:17 2015 UTC,"If this were to exist clans would be have to be balanced so everyone wouldn't just pick the Uchiha and become op by just obtaining susano. I think after picking your character's village, some clans like the Nara or Akamichi clan that don't necessarily posses Kekei Genki could be choosable but for kekei genkei clan it should have a randomizer so it wouldn't be easy to get the Sharigan or Byakugan.   Sorry for spelling"
Naruto,3d8kyg,SccsCats,1 point,Wed Jul 15 02:05:20 2015 UTC,Randomizers wouldn't be well recieved. Think about it. What if uchiha player x is a pro at the game but never gets the sharingan but uchiha player y awakens it and is a total scrub? It would be far better to have the actual kekkei genkai choosable so a Hyuga who doesn't want the Byakugan so that they can specialise in other fields better.
Naruto,3d8kyg,narx33,1 point,Wed Jul 15 12:28:10 2015 UTC,"Yeah, a forced randomizer system would be kind of stupid, I'm just thinking of a way to prevent spikes from just getting the uchiha's op jutsu and just raping people on PvP"
Naruto,3d8kyg,SccsCats,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:01:18 2015 UTC,"Well there's a lot of different ways to make the game more balanced. Uchiha's are pretty powerful and got a lot of attention in the series but the game can simply make it take longer to unlock certain abilities and like /u/AllofEverythingEver said, you can have a ''best friend'' who you do loads of missions with and end up killing them for the power. Also the Uchiha's would be popular to use but that would make Water Release users very popular too due to the fact that they can counter Uchiha's Fire Release."

Naruto,3d8zjm,Fezzico8008,25,Tue Jul 14 13:02:35 2015 UTC,"I like the character of Danzo as a representation of what a shinobi is.  A shinobi's job is to complete the mission, without remorse, without feelings.  That's Danzo.  If you look at what a shinobi was made to be, in a non idealistic way, Itachi failed.  By not killing Sasuke, he failed the mission.  Danzo on the other hand was willing to go through with it.  Danzo is not the only person to do fucked up things to innocent people.  Ohnoki was one of the people bank rolling the Akatsuki.  Rasa tried to kill Gaara six times just to make him a stronger weapon.  The list goes on.  I think the character of Danzo is an excellent character for that reason.  He's not likeable, but he's not supposed to be.  You're supposed to think he's a fucked up human being, because Shinobi in general are supposed to be fucked up human beings.  They send 12 year olds to war.  Hell, Hashirama's brother Itama got jumped by 4 dudes at least in their 20s.  Danzo to the core is built off of that foundation (you might even say, that Root...).  That is why I like and respect the creation of the character of Danzo."
Naruto,3d8zjm,HokageEzio,3,Tue Jul 14 13:17:05 2015 UTC,"That's a very good point. Even if one were to hate Danzō, I feel like his endeavors, though they seem harsh, are what he wanted for the better of Konaha, making him a good character."
Naruto,3d8zjm,Rosebunse,3,Tue Jul 14 13:51:48 2015 UTC,"So...is Danzo Tywin Lannister? Because I feel like they're very similar. They both are the extreme of what they're supposed to be; a ninja and a noblemen. They both want to protect what they have, the village and the Lannister family. However, while they do seem to ""win"" in a sense, they ultimately lose because they're just so awful that the people they manipulate stop putting up with it."
Naruto,3d8zjm,DoubleHunter,2,Tue Jul 14 16:27:54 2015 UTC,He's more like a patriotic Varys to me.
Naruto,3d8zjm,Rosebunse,2,Tue Jul 14 17:01:45 2015 UTC,Really? How so?
Naruto,3d8zjm,DoubleHunter,3,Tue Jul 14 17:13:53 2015 UTC,"Both work behind the scenes using servants of unquestioned loyalty to do their bidding. Both claim to be selflessly helping a certain country prosper, when their actions ironically do damage to said country. Both show themselves to the world as relatively harmless creatures when in actuality they're some of the most ruthless characters in their respective series. Both are amputees who wear robes. Both have been working ""for"" their countries longer than most of the other characters in their respective series."
Naruto,3d8zjm,Rosebunse,2,Tue Jul 14 17:32:31 2015 UTC,"True...I still see him a bit more like Tywin, but I concede that he works for Varys too."
Naruto,3d8zjm,DoubleHunter,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:38:56 2015 UTC,"I think Tywin's more like a way more ruthless, ambitious and cruel Tobirama.  Of course, the biggest difference is that Danzo and Tobirama do everything for the village, while Tywin does everything for House Lannister."
Naruto,3d8zjm,Rosebunse,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:50:07 2015 UTC,"Sort of the same thing, really. House Lannister is Tywin's village."
Naruto,3d8zjm,DoubleHunter,2,Tue Jul 14 20:07:53 2015 UTC,"Yes and no. I think Danzo has some warped and twisted love for his people, while Tywin sees his people as mere tools."
Naruto,3d8zjm,BioshockedNinja,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:20:13 2015 UTC,"I would have liked him a lot more if they didn't also make him the scapegoat for everything.  I believe what you said would have been ideal, if they had just made him a representation of a cold blooded shinobi, but they also wanted to blame literally everything bad thats ever happened on him. That really ruined the character IMO because lots of the decisions they pinned on him were just god awful and honestly just plain stupid.  By writing his character in such a way that he would be able to take the blame they pretty much had to write him making mistake after mistake after mistake.  Making mistakes isnt the worst thing in the world as many of the characters in the series do this but what I really hated was how they made it pretty evident that most of what he did was extremely self serving.  He wasn't willing to harm innocents because he believed it was what was best for his village, he was willing to do so because it would serve his interests which he egotistically believed where the same as the village.  He clearly wanted power.  He was upset about getting passed up for the position of 3rd Hokage and he was mad at himself for not volunteering to sacrifice himself for his team.  He was not selflessly serving his village.  What you described would have been amazing but I think Danzo didn't quite embody the ideals you talked of."
Naruto,3d8zjm,Sarahmint,-1,Tue Jul 14 17:59:49 2015 UTC,"If he was Hokage for a longer period of time and Naruto usurped his position, it would have been a much better story.  Was a Sasuke fan for just this reason.  He [Sasuke] was the true revolutionary.  No one understood this better then him.  Instead we got ""soulmate-kun rivalry"" ending that didn't even conclude with them remaining and working together."
Naruto,3d8zjm,garrison105,15,Tue Jul 14 21:01:12 2015 UTC,"Danzo isn't complex, Danzo is a ""hate sink"".  A character that exists as a scapegoat. To absolve others of blame. Manga Spoilers Want the Uchiha massacre to be ordered by Konoha, but not by necessity make Hiruzen look like the bad guy? Here's this other old guy we've never heard about, that has his own ANBU and doesn't take orders from the Hokage, for whatever reason.  Even if you forget about the Uchiha, Danzo and his ANBU committed outright treason at least twice.  He's a textbook megalomaniac. The type that honestly believes the world would be a better place under his eternal rule and would justify any atrocity he commits under the excuse of it being ""for the greater good"". Of course, the ""greater good"" and his own self-interests just so coincidentally happen to always align."
Naruto,3d8zjm,HokageEzio,9,Tue Jul 14 14:16:27 2015 UTC,"I've said the same thing too, Danzo was a scapegoat for way too many things.  He was used like those people in the spoiler tag, a way to make everybody the good guy.  He went from the Uchiha massacre in his village, to the Rain Village just cause, and even to a random ass orphanage to make Kabuto good.  He's solely there so that everybody is manipulated and everybody was a good guy.  That being said, I still think he's a complex character."
Naruto,3d8zjm,Rosebunse,6,Tue Jul 14 14:29:36 2015 UTC,"You know, that's the thing about Kishi's characters. On the one hand, it's quite easy to see who's the bad guy and who's the good guy. On the other hand, the bad guys have plenty of good reasons for being the way they are, and the good guys are often very, very flawed."
Naruto,3d8zjm,GaBeRockKing,3,Tue Jul 14 16:25:34 2015 UTC,"The be fair, the point of a secret police force is to be secret, and it wouldn't fit with Hiruzen's character. Plus, characters that are evil for the lulz aren't as good as characters with complex motivations, and Danzo simultaneously gives a reason for Itatchi's villainy and himself has a reason for doing what he does."
Naruto,3d8zjm,AbidingTruth,4,Tue Jul 14 17:52:58 2015 UTC,"His own self interest IS the greater good for the village. I don't understand why you people always claim that Danzo was selfish when everything he has ever done is for the benefit of the village. I'm beginning to question if we're even reading the same manga, as his character was written to be the kind willing to do everything and anything for the sake of the village. His name can even be translated to ""I did it for the village"""
Naruto,3d8zjm,Doc_o_Clock,2,Tue Jul 14 19:27:26 2015 UTC,"I do wish that Danzo wasn't the almost universal scapegoat for the series. He was pretty much created and used so that Konoha could still be viewed as the ""good guys"", but I think that it would have been better if Konoha as a whole was just as morally questionable as the other villages.    But Danzo never wanted the greater good for the world. He just wanted the best for Konoha. The rest of the world could have burned for all he cared, so long as Konoha was still standing at the top. The only time that Danzo acted in the best interests of the world was when he tried to kill Sasuke and Tobi as he was dying."
Naruto,3d8zjm,Sarahmint,-1,Tue Jul 14 16:39:14 2015 UTC,"It seems like he started out as complex and was retconed into a ""hate sink"" for whatever reason, even though Kishi still praises Itachi for murdering an entire clan who only wanted to rebel to avoid such genocide from occurring in the first place!"

Naruto,3d8zjm,Rosebunse,3,Tue Jul 14 20:11:05 2015 UTC,"I just can't like Danzo. Sure, he had good intentions, but the village would have been safer without him. A lot of their problems came from his ""solutions."""
Naruto,3d8zjm,Doc_o_Clock,3,Tue Jul 14 16:21:45 2015 UTC,"Danzo was necessary during Hiruzen's tenure. Without him, Konoha would have been manipulated by the other villages and likely have been overrun, or at the very least, it would be far weaker than it was.    As time went on, and the political climate of the world changed, Danzo became less necessary for the survival of Konoha. What were once acceptable measures became extreme, which led to the villainous actions that we saw. Danzo was a product and a remnant of the old system of the shinobi world, which was a hindrance to the changes that were being made in the world."
Naruto,3d8zjm,Rosebunse,2,Tue Jul 14 16:52:40 2015 UTC,This is fair and reasonable. He'd probably be rolling in his grave if he knew what the village looked like now.
Naruto,3d8zjm,Doc_o_Clock,5,Tue Jul 14 17:10:06 2015 UTC,"It would be interesting. One thing that I like about Danzo is that he never really got the chance to change. And I think that's fine. He personifies the darkness of the shinobi world, the old system that Naruto and Sasuke fight to change, and I think that it is more fitting that he dies without changing or regretting his actions.    Though I will say, right before his death, it seemed like Danzo was starting to understand what was best for the world, rather than what was best for the village. So it may have been a symbolic glimmer of hope for the world to change, and a little bit of a redeeming moment for Danzo, as he started to view the bigger picture, rather than his narrow view of the world.    It's definitely interesting that he and Naruto never interact. Naruto only knows of Danzo, and Danzo certainly knows about Naruto, but they don't come into direct conflict with each other."
Naruto,3d8zjm,TandyHard,3,Tue Jul 14 17:34:24 2015 UTC,Oooo... great points! I never thought about these things before. You're right he never got to experience the talk no justu. Maybe that's why he had to die... a symbolic ending to the old shinobi way? Got me thinking now ;)
Naruto,3d8zjm,Doc_o_Clock,3,Tue Jul 14 17:51:58 2015 UTC,"I think that if Danzo and Naruto interacted and talked about their philosophies, they would both walk away changed.    Danzo has already seen some of the benefits of Hiruzen's methods, and to be honest, no one walks away from talking to Naruto unchanged.    Naruto, on the other hand, would despise Danzo's actions, but he's lived through 17 years of results that show the occasional necessity of the darker elements of the world. Naruto's ""light"" would probably be tainted a little, and I think that his outlook would suffer more than Danzo's."
Naruto,3d8zjm,TandyHard,2,Tue Jul 14 18:15:50 2015 UTC,"If Naruto talked to Danzo, he probably would've seen some benefit to not ending up as soft as the Third in some of his policies. But however Danzo first started off, whether in the best interest of Konoha or not, over time he succumbed to greed and personal self-interest. And that's why I think Naruto would've despised Danzo's tactics. Look at Pain. Orochimaru. Madara. All started with the idea that they were searching for something better and all succumbing to hubris and ego. Danzo is the same. But he never was redeemed and died thinking his way was the best way. Arrogance is never the way. And the way not a true ninja who holds to The Will of Fire should be."
Naruto,3d8zjm,Doc_o_Clock,3,Tue Jul 14 18:43:08 2015 UTC,"That's true. Danzo operated best in the shadows, but when he attempted to personally manipulate events and step into the light, he lost everything. He got too ambitious and it cost him.    The difference between Danzo and the other villains that you listed though, is that Danzo didn't concern himself with something better for the world. His views were much more narrow, and concerned solely with Konoha.    That's why I think that Naruto would have a harder time interacting with Danzo; he's not as broadly idealistic. He doesn't want world peace, he doesn't want personal power, he just wants Konoha's superiority. Their goals and their characters don't align so well, so a conversation between them can't go too far."
Naruto,3d8zjm,TandyHard,2,Tue Jul 14 18:59:23 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I can definitely agree with that. His view was narrowed to only village concerns. I think you're right. He wouldn't have been able to see the bigger picture and he and Naruto would never have been able to see eye to eye. Great analysis! Yet another aspect of Danzo....oh how I hate him but damn he was a great antagonist for the series!"
Naruto,3d8zjm,Doc_o_Clock,3,Tue Jul 14 19:12:16 2015 UTC,"I just noticed that we're having two different discussions with each other, so I'm just going to consolidate it here, since I think we're reaching the end of it. I haven't seen the Kakashi ANBU arc, I'll have to watch it; if it delves into Kakashi's ""vulnerable"" years like I think it will, it should be interesting. I was under the impression that it was filler, but I honestly don't know if that's true.    Anyways, Danzo is one of my favorite characters in the series, and I pretty much hang around this subreddit waiting for threads like these. I'm well aware that most people hate Danzo, which is fine by me, he is a very hateworthy character.    And I'm not trying to change anyone's viewpoint of him; people can hate him all they want, because frankly, he deserves it. But I love discussing his character, which I think is more nuanced than people give him credit for. And I know that I'll always be able to find people to feed my desire for Danzo discussion here."
Naruto,3d8zjm,Rosebunse,2,Tue Jul 14 19:27:04 2015 UTC,"I actually think him never meeting Naruto is very interesting. In that way, the two different viewpoints, one of staying in the past and the one of striving to the future, never converge, never infect each other."
Naruto,3d8zjm,Doc_o_Clock,3,Tue Jul 14 17:37:47 2015 UTC,"I pretty much think the same thing. Both of their viewpoints and actions are valid, but for different eras. What Danzo represents is necessary in the warring eras that he lived through, but it is detrimental in peacetime. Naruto's will thrives in peacetime, but wouldn't survive in the eras of war.    The bulk of the series, I think, takes place in a transitional period between war and peace, so in a way, both characters' ideals were necessary. They were at the opposite extremes, so I think that it was important that neither character's ideals were infected, as you wrote. Having the two interact but walk away unchanged would be unrealistic, but to have them interact but walk away changed would be unsatisfying."
Naruto,3d8zjm,Rosebunse,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:51:02 2015 UTC,"This is all very true, and I'm happy they never got too close to each other. I'm just not sure Naruto would have been the same manga. Maybe it would have been better? Or maybe it would have darker, but not better?"
Naruto,3d8zjm,TandyHard,2,Tue Jul 14 20:07:05 2015 UTC,lol omg probably!

Naruto,3d8zjm,TandyHard,2,Tue Jul 14 17:29:36 2015 UTC,lol
Naruto,3d8zjm,TandyHard,5,Tue Jul 14 17:36:20 2015 UTC,"My roommate and I have this argument every time he tries to find redeeming qualities in Danzo.  Danzo is completely self-serving. Everything he does, put the village in danger, take Shisui's eyes but depend on Itachi, demand Naruto not return to the village to help with Pain... everything he does is only to further his personal attempt at taking over the village. His desire to be seen as Hokage and best the 3rd will always tarnish any kind of so-called good he thinks he's doing for the village. Every action and choice he makes is for his own personal gain and never for the good of the village. That's why IMO he has zero redeeming qualities."
Naruto,3d8zjm,AbidingTruth,3,Tue Jul 14 14:54:16 2015 UTC,"You literally don't know anything about Danzo lol He trusted Itachi because Itachi was in ANBU, Shisui was an Uchiha first. And he didn't even fully depend on Itachi. He told him that Itachi can choose whether to side with his clan or not, either way Konoha will be forced to act and put them down. If Itachi sides with his clan, he will be killed along everyone else. If Itachi sides with Konoha, he can at least save Sasuke. He was already prepared for the event of Itachi not siding with the village, this choice was not for Danzo, it was for Itachi.  The Akatsuki were attacking Konoha specifically for their jinchuuriki. The jinchuuriki is not only a strong military asset for the village, but also needed for whatever the Akatsuki's plan was. Letting Naruto come back and potentially being captured (which was probably seen as incredibly likely as Pain killed Jiraiya and they had no idea if Naruto became stronger than Jiraiya in such a short amount of time) is absolutely stupid. He would let Pain search the village, then find out that Naruto wasn't there and leave since it'd be foolish to sustain injuries searching for someone not even in the village. He also knew that Tsunade was a medic and would probably exhaust herself healing the people of the village, so not only will the village not suffer too many losses, but also Tsunade is out of the way, who he believed would lead the village to ruin. Pain was about to retreat until Tsunade prompted him to use Shinra Tensei and destroy the village.  Danzo did not want to ""take over the village"" because he was evil and selfish, he saw Hiruzen and his successors such as Tsunade as unfit to lead the village. Hiruzen was too kind, you need to be cruel and always one step above your enemies to survive in the shinobi world, something Hiruzen was not capable of doing. He thought the same of those who followed in his ideology, and leading the village with this mentality will only have them crushed by the likes of Iwa or Kumo.  To top everything off, trying to argue that Danzo was selfish and didn't care about the village is to argue with how Kishimoto wrote Danzo himself. Danzo's name can literally be translated to ""I did it for the village"", it was very clear that he was written as a character who did whatever it meant, no matter how dirty or cruel, to ensure that Konoha would survive and prosper above the rest of the world."
Naruto,3d8zjm,Rosebunse,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:25:01 2015 UTC,"Now, to be fair, I really think he does care about the village, but like you said, it's all because of his own need for power and recognition rather than to protect anyone or help the village.   His war mongering is what caused Pein, a lot of the Uchiha problems, and then you have Yamato."
Naruto,3d8zjm,TandyHard,2,Tue Jul 14 16:23:33 2015 UTC,"Here's what I think... I think he's convinced himself that he's doing it all for the sake of the village and that he cares for the village. But his own selfish desires always permeate every action he takes. If we compare his tough stance on how to run the village with, let's say, Tobirama... we are left to ask ourselves, would Tobirama ever steal Uchia eyes to further his power? Would anyone worthy of the title of Hokage do such a thing? And yet in his quest to ""help"" the village by becoming Hokage, he covets not only Uchia eyes but also Yamato aka Tenzo who he knows would be beneficial to the village and helps with Orochimaro's human experimentation on kidnapped children. He has acted out his selfish greed for power under the guise of the ultimate warrior fighting for Konoha.  I have tried to see some of Danzo's tougher stances on how to deal with skirmishes between villages, etc and each time, though I can see how yes, sometimes the Third was too soft in these instances, Danzo's continual self-interest and his greed for power always taints all he does. And let's not forget that instead of furthering his own jutsu and training, he simply stole Uchia eyes to use. In his final battle with Sasuke he was only able to last that long due to the power of the Uchia eyes not through much power of his own. This speaks to how small and pathetic his quest for power really was. He never tried to be the best thru hard work and determination. He simply stole it from others.   So yeah... hahaha sorry so long! But I just really detest Danzo. But!! But what a great character!! Series wouldn't have been the same without him! ;)"
Naruto,3d8zjm,Doc_o_Clock,4,Tue Jul 14 16:56:42 2015 UTC,"I never really saw Danzo as someone who wanted to be the strongest person in the world, or even in the village. He just wanted what was best for the village, and he would go through any means to reach that goal. If it required his strength, so be it, but I think that Danzo worked largely behind the scenes, manipulating events rather than affecting them personally.    He wasn't looking for personal strength, he was seeking survival. Izanagi was the perfect technique for Danzo, it fit the contradictory nature of his mantra: self-sacrifice. With Izanagi, he could sacrifice himself without actually having to die.    He went to terrible extremes to protect the village, and he did nothing to benefit the world as a whole, but I absolutely believe that everything he did was for the benefit and survival of the village."
Naruto,3d8zjm,TandyHard,2,Tue Jul 14 17:57:03 2015 UTC,"Hmmm that's where I have to disagree. My earlier post in this thread pretty much summed up my view of his attempts at doing what was best for the village. In short, I think he convinced himself he was doing it all for the village but most of what he did was for his own personal self-interests. If he really was about self-sacrifice he wouldn't have stolen Uchia eyes, kept Yamato (Tenzo) for himself and he definitely wouldn't have allowed Orochimoro to kidnap children and experiment on them. His need for personal power kept tainting everything he tried to do for the village.   But your comment about how he never got to redeem himself before dying and never talked to Naruto has me believing that he was a relic of the past. An old misguided idea of how shinobi should be. The very idea that Naruto was trying to reshape. From the beginning Naruto had problems with the rules of shinobi. So when I saw your comment I could see how Danzo's death was symbolic in finally closing the door on the old shinobi ways. But I don't see how Danzo acted out of self-sacrifice in any way. Imo, he stayed in the shadows because that's where he was able to carry out his greedy tactics of stealing Uchia eyes and plotting to kill the Third without interference."
Naruto,3d8zjm,Doc_o_Clock,6,Tue Jul 14 18:22:44 2015 UTC,"His belief in self-sacrifice was in contradiction to how he acted, I think that's a major point of his character. He advocates self-sacrifice; it's how a shinobi should live and die. His father did it, his mother did it, Tobirama did it, Hiruzen did it, etc. He believes in self-sacrifice, but he's afraid of death; that's what I got from his flashback. Like I said, Izanagi is the perfect technique for him because he can sacrifice himself without dying.    And unless I'm mistaken, Orochimaru's experiments on children are the same thing that created Yamato, and I think that Yamato's creation is a boon for Konoha. Hashirama was unarguably, at that point in time, the strongest shinobi that Konoha had ever seen. Recreating even a fraction of that power would have been beneficial for Konoha's military strength and for its ability to control the Tailed Beasts.    Danzo is absolutely a relic of the past, and he represents that old world of the shinobi that Naruto and Sasuke strive to change. He stays in the shadows because that's where he belongs; he prefers espionage and deceit over powerful jutsu. A shinobi of Danzo's era is not meant to operate in the light. Danzo left the shadows to participate in the Five Kage Summit, and look where that left him. He lost what little credibility he had with the shinobi world's leaders and was killed by Sasuke. Covert, not overt, is what he was meant to be.    Side note, when was it written that Danzo was plotting to kill Hiruzen, because I don't have any recollection of that."
Naruto,3d8zjm,Shisui_1994,2,Tue Jul 14 18:49:33 2015 UTC,"That Danzo and Izanagi point you've made is such a brilliant perception, stuff like this is why I love r/naruto. Did you make that connection the first time you watched/read it?"
Naruto,3d8zjm,Doc_o_Clock,2,Thu Jul 16 05:07:24 2015 UTC,"I wish that I could say that, but I didn't make that connection when I first read the manga. It clicked in my head when the anime showed that battle though. For all the flak that the anime gets, to me, it does well at clarifying some things in the manga, and re-viewing events with the knowledge of what's happening and what's going to happen sometimes gives me insights like that.    For me, that's why Danzo's use of Izanagi is my favorite. It's more than just a get out of jail free card; it has symbolic meaning for his character. And while some people might hate when characters are hypocritical, I love it. It makes them flawed; it makes them human.    And honestly, Danzo is one of my favorite characters. I've had so many discussions about Danzo in /r/Naruto that they're pretty much scripted at this point. I've analyzed his character, motives, and actions so much that I think I know him better than any other character."
Naruto,3d8zjm,TandyHard,1 point,Thu Jul 16 11:40:23 2015 UTC,"Aaah... I didn't see your ""contradiction to self-sacrifice"" part. But yeah, I fully agree on the rest.   And you didn't see his plot to kill the Third?! Let me guess, you skipped episode fillers 344-362! I haven't re-read the manga as many times as I've re-watched the anime so it might not be in the manga but I believe it is still considered canon. So I can't give you the manga chapters but 344-362 covers a lot of Obito and Kakashi... it gets really good at episode 349 and delves into all of Kakashi's ANBU years. Minato, the Third, Danzo and Itachi all have important info revealed. Episode 351 is the specific episode that deals with Danzo's attempt on Hiruzen's life."
Naruto,3d8zjm,Rosebunse,2,Tue Jul 14 19:05:53 2015 UTC,"Seriously, he's awful, but he really added a lot to the series as a whole.   You know, your point about Tobirama is a good one. Tobirama didn't like the Uchiha, and he created quite a few awful jutsu that, ultimately, made it possible for Kaguya and Madara to do what they did. However, you're right, he never stole eyes from the Uchiha for his own gain like that, and you never hear of him sacrificing 60 very small children just to get that one who had his brother's jutsu."
Naruto,3d8zjm,TandyHard,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:04:59 2015 UTC,"Exactly. And that's why I personally can't find any redeeming qualities for Danzo.  But, that being said, I love Danzo as a necessary character in the series and also because he's so much like power hungry people in the real world who can't see or understand why sometimes the ends don't justify the means.   But damn that man pisses me off! Haha... every time I see him on screen doing his messed up crap, I always end up screaming horrid obscenities at my tv. But.... that's what he's supposed to do! They wrote this particular villain extremely well. The fact that it caused me anxiety when they were about to name him Hokage means the writers did their job. So I love the character for exactly why I hate him hahaha!"
Naruto,3d8zjm,Rosebunse,3,Tue Jul 14 17:17:11 2015 UTC,"You have to really love Kishi for giving us such a simple, yet oddly multifaceted character."

Naruto,3d8zjm,cloistered_around,2,Tue Jul 14 15:49:05 2015 UTC,"During the Five Kage Summit, Danzo used Shisui's Kotoamatsukami to trick the five Kages into working together to stop what was believed to be Madara Uchiha at the time.    Whoah whoah whoah that's not what happened. He used the eye to trick them into suggesting him as the leader of the alliance--not to make them work together in the first place. They did that on their own.  Danzo has always been about trying to gain power through any means necessary. He cares about Konoha, sure, (in a weird ""let it be totally destroyed and I'll rebuild it as the new leader"" way), but he doesn't trust anyone's judgement but his own and will do anything to get in a position of leadership. He sabotages peace treaties, steals people's eyes, kills messengers, tries to kill the Hokage himself... etc etc etc.  Tldr; Most of the bad things that happen in Naruto are because of Danzo. He's just selfish, and his selfishness ends up with him making an awful lot of bad decisions."
Naruto,3d8zjm,DoubleHunter,2,Tue Jul 14 15:55:35 2015 UTC,"Even though his character lacks focus I think he's one of the most complex character in the series. He might even be the single biggest piece of wasted potential in Naruto, which is saying a lot.  Since HokageEzio mentioned most the things that make Danzo great I'll just add to it.  Most Naruto characters could work well in other series, though slight modifications would certainly need to be made. However, Danzo works so well in the Naruto verse because it is run by ninja. His character tackles with issues that are only largely relevant in the world of Naruto, which just adds to the reason why he's one of Kishi's best creations."
Naruto,3d8zjm,FalseCape,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:18:56 2015 UTC,"During the Five Kage Summit, Danzo used Shisui's Kotoamatsukami to trick the five Kages into working together to stop what was believed to be Madara Uchiha at the time.   He definitely didn't do that. The Kages were already intent on working together to stop the threat of Madara Uchiha. What Danzo did was try to manipulate Mifune into making Danzo the leader of the allied shinobi forces. This action, once detected, nearly was enough to stop the 5 kages from working together and could have seriously jeopardized all 5 villages.   Either way, Fuck Danzo. All the good intentions in the world don't mean shit if you are a prick who murders anyone who opposes you or you see as a threat. Hitler had good intentions for his people, so did Stalin, didn't stop either of them from being some of the biggest mass murdering pricks in history."
Naruto,3d8zjm,FalseCape,0,Wed Jul 15 02:06:33 2015 UTC,"I'm not trying to convince you to like Danzō (nor am I saying that you said I was). You disliking him is totally understandable and it's great that there is so much controversy towards Danzō; it's what's making this discussion good. However, it is a fact that Danzō did say in episode 202 (Taka fansubs) ""I will do whatever it takes to protect the world of shinobi. This world should be united. Just like the First Hokage, Hashirama, united the clans and created our village. This time the villages will unite and form one ninja world. Discussion alone will not unite our world."" I don't think that he's lying because he knows how much of a threat the Akatsuki are since Pain pretty much destroyed Konaha right before the Five Kage Summit. If you do think he is lying and saying that just because the Kages are infront of him, please explain your reasoning why. 😃"
Naruto,3d8zjm,FakeAdminAccount,0,Wed Jul 15 03:27:48 2015 UTC,"What? No, I'm literally only disputing what I have quoted. He wasn't using Komoamatsukami on the Kages to get them to agree to an alliance. It's not like that would even be possible since at best he can use it on one person per day. And the person he chose to use it on was Mifune since he was the neutral party moderating the meeting between the Kages. The kage alliance was already happening and Mifune was trying to decide which Kage would be most apt to lead this force of allied shinobi. Danzo used this opportunity to put Mifune under Komoamatsukami so that he would decide that Danzo would be the person most fit to lead the shinobi alliance, thus securing his spot from interim hokage to actual hokage. Had he not used it the alliance still would have happened, Danzo just wouldn't have been the leader of it. Pretty much the end result would be the same in that Gaara would have been chosen as the leader. There was absolutely no reason to use Komoamatsukami on Mifune but to try to secure his position as leader of the shinobi alliance. It literally could not be interpreted as anything but a shallow grab for power. Sure he wanted the Ninja world united, but he wanted it united UNDER HIM and by extension the leaf. ""For the sake of the Leaf"" of course, but that's the kind of justification of tyrants and warlords.  So yeah, I'm saying he was a lying sack of shit when it came to his motives, which were purely self centered, even if he wasn't lying about his end goal of uniting shinobi against madara."

Naruto,3d5ts4,swarbles,6,Tue Jul 14 16:24:43 2015 UTC,"I love Dragonball and I love Toriyama's art style but he can't make good stories imo. Japan has different taste but Kishi and his wild feel rides, are top 3 imo. I've never gotten upset,happy,mad and cried with any other manga/anime as much as I have thanks to Kiski (and Studio Pierrot amazing detail to the emotional parts and extending some).  Naruto is my favorite so I'm probably biased"
Naruto,3d5ts4,Yosonimbored,1 point,Tue Jul 14 03:00:15 2015 UTC,"Dragonball Z was my favorite, and still has a huge place in my heart, before I was into Naruto for a few years. The character development, story arcs, plot, etc., in Naruto is just so good. Almost every chapter had my eyes welling up with tears just from pure emotion. I am also a very sensitive female :p But, just like you said: it makes you feel the entire spectrum of emotions."
Naruto,3d5ts4,amongstheliving,10,Tue Jul 14 04:44:08 2015 UTC,"The lesson, as always: Japanese people have very different tastes than Americans...."
Naruto,3d5ts4,swarbles,-4,Mon Jul 13 20:13:01 2015 UTC,"Not all Americans believe that something needs to be a perfect literary masterpiece. I'm perfectly content with how the series was presented, and any problems I have with it; well, there's fanfiction for a reason."
Naruto,3d5ts4,kaito0,2,Mon Jul 13 22:27:16 2015 UTC,"Not at all what I meant. American manga readers have a preference for (usually shonen) fantasy action manga over the other manga genres.  i.e. Naruto is #1 in the Western World, along with FMA, Bleach, OP, Death Note, etc."
Naruto,3d5ts4,swarbles,2,Tue Jul 14 13:57:12 2015 UTC,"Oh. Well, my comment still stands."
Naruto,3d5ts4,kaito0,3,Tue Jul 14 16:19:37 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's fine, I'm not arguing with it. It just has nothing to do with mine....."
Naruto,3d5ts4,swarbles,8,Tue Jul 14 16:22:11 2015 UTC,"8th in Japan, number 1 in the world.  Naruto basically the Dragon Ball of 21th century."
Naruto,3d5ts4,SilverStoneSlide,13,Mon Jul 13 22:18:14 2015 UTC,actually.... One Piece is the number 1 in the world atm... it even surpassed Dragon ball
Naruto,3d5ts4,tht1guy52,5,Tue Jul 14 01:07:49 2015 UTC,"And after recently catching up with One Piece, I'd say Oda and the series deserves it. As much as I like Naruto, I don't mind that One Piece surpasses it in popularity."
Naruto,3d5ts4,SilverStoneSlide,2,Tue Jul 14 19:38:45 2015 UTC,"Apparently, Naruto sold more in the western, but sold less in Asian compared to One Piece.  My mistake.  Still, I prefer Naruto over One Piece anytime, anywhere."
Naruto,3d5ts4,IamNR,-3,Tue Jul 14 09:33:51 2015 UTC,One Piece is #1 in Japan. Naruto is #1 in The World!

Naruto,3d5ts4,ultibman5000,5,Tue Jul 14 02:29:49 2015 UTC,"why would you exclude japan, it doesn't count as part of the world?"
Naruto,3d5ts4,Neural_groove,8,Tue Jul 14 09:16:34 2015 UTC,"Not really. Dragon Ball is the Dragon Ball of the 21th century, the nostalgia of that anime is nigh impossible to beat. Even on a sales level, One Piece sells the most copies worldwide, anyways."
Naruto,3d5ts4,Doxtator007,2,Tue Jul 14 02:11:05 2015 UTC,Not even mad. Top ten is still pretty good. Gintama is an awesome show.   100/10 would recommend.

Naruto,3d5ts4,sora677,-2,Wed Jul 15 02:16:38 2015 UTC,"Why the heck did they put Kishi in 8th? He should be in the top 3! His artstyle, story writing and character development is way too awesome than other mangaka"
Naruto,3d5ts4,swarbles,5,Tue Jul 14 08:33:24 2015 UTC,"it really isn't compared to the people above him, one piece world building, and writing is leagues above naruto. You can like naruto better but you have to concede that point.  tokyo ghoul has much better character development than naruto does (admittedly with a lot of insanity)   you can prefer naruto over the other series but it is true that they have better writing"
Naruto,3d5ts4,Rosebunse,-2,Tue Jul 14 09:20:05 2015 UTC,"I don't agree with that at all. Don't mistake ""more writing and world building"" with ""better writing and world building."" OP Is an awesome series, but I don't think it is anywhere near as well written as Naruto. It's really silly (which some people love). The world of OP is certainly cool but it lacks the complicated politics and history of Naruto that make it such a rich and believable fantasy world."
Naruto,3d5ts4,swarbles,0,Tue Jul 14 13:59:45 2015 UTC,"I think Naruto trimmed a lot of the fat OP had. My problem with OP is that it's so silly, so fantastic that it's hard to really get into and enjoy if you're just jumping into it. Naruto's basic premise is much easier to understand and appreciate."
Naruto,3d5ts4,Rosebunse,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:29:58 2015 UTC,"Agreed. Naruto's world is also just cleaner. More =/= Better. GoT is not better than LotR just because it is longer and has more characters. IMO, Naruto's world is built better, the story is far more streamlined, and the characters are FAAAAAAAAAAR more interesting. And it has consistent thematic elements that tie the story together very nicely."
Naruto,3d5ts4,swarbles,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:48:22 2015 UTC,"I don't think you can really compare GoT to LotR. They're very similar, but they're two completely things, with two different perspective. Naruto and OP are a bit more comparable because, ultimately, a lot of the themes are the same."
Naruto,3d5ts4,Rosebunse,2,Tue Jul 14 17:11:34 2015 UTC,"ehhh I think you could say the same about Naruto and OP, but you're also right, they were created in the same time with a few similar themes, whereas the 70 years separating GoT and LotR make for very different stories thematically... I was really just drawing a comparison between the two because they are the most well-known modern fantasy stories."
Naruto,3d5ts4,shikadainara,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:14:48 2015 UTC,"True, true."
Naruto,3d5ts4,swarbles,-4,Tue Jul 14 17:22:30 2015 UTC,Not 1st? Putting him at 8th is practically blasphemy..
Naruto,3d5ts4,shikadainara,1 point,Tue Jul 14 03:36:53 2015 UTC,"Just shows the difference in Japan vs. Worldwide. Oda and Kishi are 1/2 worldwide in some order, but Japan's tastes are more wide-reaching and not just focused on fantasy shounen action manga."
Naruto,3d5ts4,swarbles,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:23:22 2015 UTC,"Oda/Kishi isnt 1/2 in Japan? J-world features Dragon Ball, Naruto and One Piece.. so kinda seems these are the top 3.. unless J-World is targeted at international visitors.."

Naruto,3d7c9d,NitaXEU,1 point,Tue Jul 14 03:50:42 2015 UTC,Is it really better than the two others (naruget and narutospot)? Both these websites keep freezing on me if the episode isn't fully loaded
Naruto,3d7c9d,trojanspyda,4,Tue Jul 14 13:02:01 2015 UTC,kissanime is by far the best site for pretty much any anime in terms of quality

Naruto,3d7c9d,trojanspyda,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:45:12 2015 UTC,"Kissanime has the highest resolutions for every Naruto and Naruto Shippuuden episodes. The original Naruto series only goes up to 480p no matter what website you're on, and as Shippuuden progresses, so does the resolution on each episode, starting at 480p, then going to 720p, and for the past couple years the series finally got up to 1080p."

Naruto,3d7c9d,carinihada,2,Tue Jul 14 02:27:06 2015 UTC,Dubbed is Monday on naruget right?
Naruto,3d7c9d,Velith46,3,Tue Jul 14 04:45:49 2015 UTC,I think so. I'm not that far ahead in shippuden so I try not to keep watch of them for spoiler purposes.
Naruto,3d7c9d,carinihada,1 point,Tue Jul 14 11:48:48 2015 UTC,Okay. Well I'm pretty sure it is and was thinking it could be down because they uploaded a video late
Naruto,3d7c9d,the1mangekyo,3,Tue Jul 14 12:07:39 2015 UTC,I use the crunchyroll app to keep up with the anime
Naruto,3d7c9d,IIvoltairII,2,Tue Jul 14 03:41:33 2015 UTC,Do you have to pay for crunchyroll?
Naruto,3d7c9d,Thatguy69Kappa,2,Tue Jul 14 06:02:37 2015 UTC,"Yes you can use narutospot , the episodes mostly are HD or you can use Kissanime ."

Naruto,3d5582,Sherlock_87,24,Mon Jul 13 16:34:46 2015 UTC,It would be fucking awesome. The Naruto universe has so much depth that the details practically fill themselves in.
Naruto,3d5582,HighGuy92,33,Mon Jul 13 17:14:32 2015 UTC,"Something like Dragon Ball XenoVerse would be cool, where you get to make your own character. Only instead of picking species, you'd pick village. On a similar note, i think the same idea with the Avatar: The Last Airbender universe would be really awesome."
Naruto,3d5582,papa_smurphy,7,Mon Jul 13 16:50:07 2015 UTC,"I am a huge fan of character customisation, and this would've awesome! Perhaps an RPG-style game too?"
Naruto,3d5582,tb-talex,5,Mon Jul 13 18:02:57 2015 UTC,"Xenoverse-type Naruto game would be like dreams coming true! but DBX MP was so terrible, I don't know if they could have a stable MP structure, I'd even spend $100 for that shit."
Naruto,3d5582,izn1337,2,Mon Jul 13 18:17:22 2015 UTC,"Like I've been saying, with the end of the Ninja Storm series, It's the perfect time to switch. A Xenoverse themed Naruto game, and a Ninja Storm style DBZ game."
Naruto,3d5582,Crimson_Elysium,2,Mon Jul 13 21:36:18 2015 UTC,This this this!!! Naruto Xenoverse 😂 I can dream.
Naruto,3d5582,Shmewis_,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:06:31 2015 UTC,"They could also make it so for choosing species, you could also choose clan and certain techniques like the shadow possession jutsu and Kekkei Genkai like the Sharingan or the Byakugan exclusive to their respective clans."
Naruto,3d5582,Thundersoap,1 point,Tue Jul 14 01:47:32 2015 UTC,Exactly. And some clans would obviously be locked to certain villages.
Naruto,3d5582,papa_smurphy,14,Tue Jul 14 02:44:17 2015 UTC,"I think it would take a very large budget to make one that's any good, and MMOs simply don't make that kind of money anymore unless they're WoW or SWTOR."
Naruto,3d5582,IdRatherBeLurking,10,Mon Jul 13 16:35:44 2015 UTC,"Yes, which is why I would prefer a single player RPG like KOTR. A Naruto MMO would have a harder time than something like SWTOR simply because there would be a much smaller fan base to start out with.  But with something like KOTOR, imagine using the force ability upgrade system to develop your own jutsus, and workbenches to upgrade weapons . . . That would be such an awesome game."
Naruto,3d5582,Thousandtree,0,Mon Jul 13 19:02:46 2015 UTC,"ew no way. SPRPGs are soooo boring. The awesomeness of Naruto is the politics between the villages and the constant conflict of the shinobi world. I don't think a single player RPG would be able to capture that on the same level as an MMORPG.  KOTOR is an amazing game, don't get me wrong. But the Star Wars universe is very different from the Naruto one. You'd have to go one of two ways - either a semi-open ended RPG like KOTOR or a truely open ended RPG like Elder Scrolls - and I don't necessarily think it would translate well to the Naruto universe.  This is a world just begging to be turned into an online, PvP based game."
Naruto,3d5582,swarbles,2,Mon Jul 13 19:18:13 2015 UTC,"I would love a TES Naruto game. Maybe with a GTA-online style open world online map (with more than just a few heists) for people who want to take their characters online. I much prefer the storytelling of SPRPGs, which is where I think Naruto's universe would shine (doing stealth things like spying on other villages, joining akatsuki-like organizations, etc).  Of course, there would never be a budget for something as big as that."
Naruto,3d5582,Thousandtree,2,Mon Jul 13 19:43:21 2015 UTC,"That's actually a cool idea. My initial thought was that you could have PvP ""Missions"" that are instanced - i.e. you have an objective (a piece of information, or a target) and another team is in the same instance trying to stop it. Kind of like BGs in WoW but much more story and goal-oriented.  I agree that the storytelling of SPRPGs is vastly superior. My problem with them is the lack of dynamism inherent in a CPU-generated environment. It's just not as fun to compete against computers as it is against other humans, and village vs. village would have to be a huge part of any Naruto RPG."
Naruto,3d5582,swarbles,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:09:19 2015 UTC,Planetside 2 is pretty much an AAA title. DBG has a pretty decent track records with MMO's (if you ignore SW:Galaxies)

Naruto,3d5582,IdRatherBeLurking,1 point,Mon Jul 13 21:08:06 2015 UTC,"Pretty decently, with the PS4 release we're finally gaining players again (on PC and in total).

Naruto,3d5582,maurodsimone,5,Mon Jul 13 18:18:49 2015 UTC,It was only a failure as a subscription model. They've done very well for themselves since.

Naruto is at it's prime now with the final bits of the anime related manga and the 2 current (ish) movies.  Even if they started work on it now, it would take at least 3 years for it come out (and probably won't even be targeted at the Western World on release).  I have wanted a Naruto MMORPG for years, there is just so much potential for the jutsu system and they have so many characters they can draw upon. What to do about the eye powers though I wonder?"

Naruto,3d5582,TSM_DankPlank,1 point,Tue Jul 14 06:20:31 2015 UTC,"I have ALWAYS wanted a game like this. I remember playing clash of ninja on gamecube and wanting so badly to make my own character. If they added the character customization (which personally, I think 1000% heart and soul would have to go into that specifically for originality of each shinobi. Sliders would give the biggest range of options for an mmo like that.), PvP battles Something Xenoverse-esque, but with a 3 man squad, so 3v3 fights, OR how fucking fun does 12 v 12 sound?! It'd be graphics intense, but wouldn't it be oh so worth it?! You could challenge a player or squad to one, and then load into a map selection screen.) Obviously the open world mechanics would be interesting to think about. Something I cant even touch on. Even in 3 v 3, if it were after every player unlocked their chosen Kekkei Genkai, just imagine the fast paced absolute mayhem carnage. So mix all that with the ""choose your attacks"" from Xenoverse, and whatever element you chose.. Just.. Take my money, my first born, and my soul. I would looovee to see a lightning tunneling fang, or a masterful mix of mokuton style and fire style. ice/fire/whatever covered throwing weapons for extra damage.  Building off what others said, choosing your villiage, specialty, elemental type (it would determine the jutsus you could learn, and the visual effects. Imagine a blazing rasengan!), and even a kekkei genkai to be unlocked once you reach a certain level and know enough jutsus/combo moves. Depending on what Kekkei Genkai you chose, you start out having an affinity towards a certain element and fight style, but that wouldnt mean you can't mold/change it. EG: Sharingan/MS would mean you'd start with basic knowledge of fire attacks, something a puppet master or taijutsu specialist may have to work up to. Each would have starting perks. It would just be a stepping stone, or a way to decide what KG you want for endgame jutsu combos.  There could even be an economy/crafting/gathering and hunting system. Ninja tools, food pills, meals that give temp stat buffs.. Everything COULD be made by players. Materials? You'd need to go pick certain herbs for food pills or maybe hunt animals for their various items to be used in the crafting/gathering tree. Hell, you could even make weapons, armor, whatever, so long as you have the materials necessary. Too lazy for all that? Go check out a market board in one of the villages sprawled across the vast land."

Naruto,3d68xd,AbidingTruth,3,Tue Jul 14 00:29:39 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the statements are sort of conflicting. I think he means Itachi was holding back just barely enough so that he wouldn't kill Sasuke, but not to the same degree I thought he did.   You're free to disagree with that interpretation."

Naruto,3d68xd,AbidingTruth,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:42:42 2015 UTC,I think there are three main points where he would have died instantly if itachi was serious. I don't think sasuke could get out of tsukuyomi at that point. If he could then he would die when amaterasu caught him. If not then susanoo would kill him. This is assuming that serious itachi needs ms techniques to win.which he probably didn't at that point

Naruto,3d68xd,Thatguy69Kappa,8,Mon Jul 13 22:32:02 2015 UTC,Um this one goes to Itachi . Bee doesnt have a way to deal with Amaterasu as shown in the Sasuke vs Bee fight . And if Bee goes Full Tail Beast transformation Itachi would just burn him alive . Susanoo could hold vs form two chakra cloak . Bee could only possible take both out with a tailed beast bomb but he would still burn to Amaterasu . So best case scenario they both kill each other worst case Itachi slaughters Bee . Also I have 0 idea how would Itachi's susanoo go up against a full Hachibi transformation but I dont believe it would be able to hold his own even with the Yata mirror .
Naruto,3d68xd,haex19,3,Mon Jul 13 21:54:38 2015 UTC,"Well, considering that a Perfect Stabilized Susanoo can battle toe to toe against a Bijuu, I think that Itachi's Susanoo can hold 8 tails enough time to be burned with Amaterasu."
Naruto,3d68xd,Thatguy69Kappa,4,Mon Jul 13 22:12:40 2015 UTC,"A perfect Susanoo is stronger than a Bijuu (Madaras words when he shows it to the 5 kage ) . But the difference between a perfect one and a normal Susanoo is huge . A perfect Susanoo is  bigger than a mountain , a normal one cant even fill 1/10 of the bridge Sasuke and Danzo fought on. A full Hachibi form ( the one he used vs Tobi and destroyed kilometers of forests with rotating his tails a little ) would shit on a normal Susanoo ."
Naruto,3d68xd,WhereIsMyManatee,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:26:37 2015 UTC,"B already countered Amaterasu by removing a tentacle and switching to it. Itachi's stamina is awful while B's is absolutely huge.   Consdering an exhausted Kurama's V1 cloak and Garra's blocked Amaterasu, I'd say B's V1 or V2 cloak would do the same. Realistically, Itachi has no reliable counter to B's abilities or any method of taking him down, while B can outright overpower Itachi."
Naruto,3d68xd,AFatz,3,Tue Jul 14 10:37:16 2015 UTC,"That was Sasuke's very first Amaterasu. Also, people don't realized Itachi's stamina issue was largely impacted by his illness. That being said, full health Itachi would definitely win. And I'm a huge Bee fan."
Naruto,3d68xd,WhereIsMyManatee,2,Tue Jul 14 11:46:59 2015 UTC,"That being his first Amaterasu would have zero impact on how powerful it was. In any case, Sasuke has always been better with the black flames than Itachi ever was.   Even in Part 1 when he wasn't sick, 3 uses of the Mangekyo exhausted him."
Naruto,3d68xd,AFatz,3,Tue Jul 14 12:15:00 2015 UTC,"He was sick in part 1. And we haven't seen Itachi at full strength ever, so I'm not sure where you got that Sasuke, at the point when he fought Bee, was better with Amaterasu than Itachi."
Naruto,3d68xd,WhereIsMyManatee,0,Tue Jul 14 12:29:10 2015 UTC,We can only gauge what we've actually seen in the manga. An Edo Itachi was matched by B without his higher forms and would've lost to Kabuto without Sasuke's back up.   He was just naturally more skilled. Itachi never produced an Amaterasu large enough to engulf the Hachibi. He had to spam it numerous times just to tag Sasuke.
Naruto,3d68xd,WhereIsMyManatee,1 point,Wed Jul 15 07:18:20 2015 UTC,While this is true it was shown that Samehada can cut through flames... and since Bee began to wield samehada perhaps he can cut thru amaterasu?

Naruto,3d68xd,Gohan_Son,2,Wed Jul 15 11:47:55 2015 UTC,That is why Itachi had Kisame.
Naruto,3d68xd,izn1337,2,Tue Jul 14 18:51:49 2015 UTC,"Itachi wins. Tsukuyomi isn't a regular sharingan genjutsu, it can't be broken by the standard methods. That means Bee has no counter. Bee also has no counter to amaterasu. Itachi also has a greater defense than Sasuke had at the time and 2 legendary weapons along with it. I believe the only reason Sasuke even lost that fight is because of how little he knew about his own MS techniques. If Sasuke had susanoo or kagutsuchi, I believe he'd win."
Naruto,3d68xd,Gohan_Son,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:39:17 2015 UTC,Any type of genjutsu will not work on a Jinchuriki whos Bijuu is in control. Controlling Bijuu solely is possible with a genjutsu but not with a Jinchuriki who has Bijuu in control.
Naruto,3d68xd,izn1337,2,Tue Jul 14 10:47:08 2015 UTC,That is just simply not true. The reason a perfect jinchuriki is immune is because their tailed beast is the partner. The tailed beast can break the genjutsu for the jin. Itachi's tsukuyomi can't be broken by the partner method which means Bee is not immune. Also IT is another genjutsu perfect jins are not immune to...
Naruto,3d68xd,Gohan_Son,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:51:03 2015 UTC,"I remember someone saying about genjutsu (Hachibi said that?) won't work on Jinchuriki whom you've Bijuu in control or the way you say it, are friends with the Bijuu. But yeah, it was never really explained or shown if something like Tsukuyomi would work on him, I was just giving my two cents, guess I should've said maybe the first time since it wasn't explained or shown."
Naruto,3d68xd,izn1337,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:23:48 2015 UTC,It was said by Killer Bee and he did explain it. The tailed beast uses the partner method to break the host out of the genjutsu. Tsukuyomi cannot be broken that way meaning perfect jinchurikis are not immune to it.
Naruto,3d68xd,Gohan_Son,2,Tue Jul 14 20:37:35 2015 UTC,"ah thanks, I just found those panels.    Naruto to Bee Bee"
Naruto,3d68xd,Gohan_Son,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:05:04 2015 UTC,What is it that makes tsukuyomi different than other genjutsu? Is this ever explained? Where does it say that jinchuriki are somehow unable to break from this genjutsu?
Naruto,3d68xd,Gohan_Son,1 point,Wed Jul 15 08:02:53 2015 UTC,All we know is it's Itachi's special MS technique. We know how broken genjutsu can be like kotoamatsukami for example. Itachi says himself his tsukuyomi can only be challenged by another sharingan user with the same blood as him but others with sharingan can resist it slightly. He said it to Kakashi in Part 1 I believe.
Naruto,3d68xd,Spartn90,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:07:33 2015 UTC,"The only reason I can think of is because the tailed beasts inside the jinchuriki may not wake up the host in time since the genjutsu contains multiple days compressed over the course of a few seconds.  In which case, its not so much that it can't be broken but its so swift that its difficult to keep up with except via another sharingan from the same blood."
Naruto,3d68xd,Gohan_Son,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:12:46 2015 UTC,"I don't know what you mean. Itachi states the only thing that would work is someone with a sharingan that shares the same blood as him aka Sasuke. That's why whenever he brings out tsukuyomi it's always ""game over"" if you look into his eyes. It doesn't really matter how ""swift"" a regular genjutsu is anyway, a tailed beast would be able to break the host out of it. It's not like the hachibi gets there before the genjutsu hits. The host is hit, they are caught in it, then the bijuu breaks them out of it."
Naruto,3d68xd,Spartn90,0,Wed Jul 15 19:28:27 2015 UTC,Well the host's chakra is disrupted for 2-3 seconds and then they are on the ground after suffering what felt like several weeks of torture. Once caught in a genjutsu like that you would have to be awoken within a fraction of a second after you've been caught and even then you would still feel the affects of it.   The tailed beast when waking up the host has to know the host's chakra is disrupted and then agitate it again in order to wake them up. And during those seconds the host is undergoing multiple weeks of torture.
Naruto,3d68xd,izn1337,0,Wed Jul 15 19:50:13 2015 UTC,It wouldn't matter if the beast knew or not though because that method wouldn't work so the reason he has no counter to it is because he is not a sharingan user with the same blood as Itachi.
Naruto,3d68xd,Gohan_Son,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:57:29 2015 UTC,"Sasuke was just cocky at this point, then he got railed two times, he's lucky he had two people with miraculous healing abilities with him."
Naruto,3d68xd,izn1337,2,Mon Jul 13 22:51:16 2015 UTC,"He was cocky then, sure. But I still believe if he knew about his MS techniques, the outcome of his fight with Bee would have been very different and in his favor."
Naruto,3d68xd,Spartn90,2,Mon Jul 13 22:54:23 2015 UTC,"Ooh definitely, I'm just saying he was cocky for having his MS, sadly he didn't know how to use it properly."

At that time he wasn't really that much ruthless, but at that Five Kage Summit incident, he was turning more colder and was entering the darkness thus his eye powers got powerful, so yeah just sayin' if it only would have come the first time when he was fighting Killer Bee, the outcome would be diff :)"

Naruto,3d5oim,Otium20,1 point,Mon Jul 13 21:59:55 2015 UTC,"Kurama are quite a ways behind and Hatsuyuki seem to be on break, so the only option left to my knowledge is crunchyroll (horriblesubs are just crunchyroll & other streaming service rips, not a sub group).  I feel that Kurama take too many liberties with translations, but they are at least a scratch translation. I think (bar movies) Hatsuyuki tend to edit crunchyroll scripts for Naruto, as they have a fair bit of dub terminology (e.g. ""fire style fireball jutsu"") from what I recall."

Naruto,3d5gvi,sspazzy,2,Mon Jul 13 17:57:27 2015 UTC,"With just canon material (Chapter 668 to 710) it'd take a matter of 24-28 episodes to be exact (long fights, 1 or 2 chapters each episode). But, that will require great effort, they won't be able to provide episode on weekly purpose then, so it'd still take about 8 months (which means 3 episodes every month) or 9.5 months for 28 episodes. If we exclude 10 chapters of Naruto Gaiden which would or might (I don't know much about it) be a part of Boruto: Naruto the Movie, that will make about 32 chapters which will make about 20 episodes, maybe even more since there are long fights, plus they show complete flashbacks sometime."
Naruto,3d5gvi,izn1337,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:11:38 2015 UTC,"I was thinking about Gaiden.... I'm wondering if they'll release it before the movie comes out? Or if they'll save it for an end-of-series bonus like how they used Kakashi Gaiden as ""filler."" It's only going to be 2-3 episodes anyway."
Naruto,3d5gvi,swarbles,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:16:26 2015 UTC,"My estimation is that the anime will end in November/December. Actually, a couple of days ago when I was bored I made a plan. If (and that is a big IF) there are no more fillers and no more breaks (excluding this week and the special episode on August 6) and if one episode adapts 2 manga chapters, then the last episode will air on November 12.  But as I said, only if it goes according to my list...and I'm pretty sure that there WILL be more filler content, so the anime ending in December or even January/February is more plausible."

Naruto,3d0ktc,Elusieum,7,Mon Jul 13 00:32:51 2015 UTC,"Ok, now you've all made me think on this more. I think it would be easier for starters if I made an Akastuki deck first, maybe with Ace's being the main characters because it was a good suggested idea. So that would mean, reordering everything:  King of hearts: Sasori  Queen of hearts: Deidara  Jack of hearts: Tobi  King of Spades: Madara  Queen of Spades: Orochimaru (akatsuki version)  Jack of Spades: Hidan  King of Clubs: Pein  Queen of Clubs: Konan  Jack of Clubs: Zetsu  King of Diamonds: Kakuzu  Queen of Diamonds: Kisame (I DUNNO JUST ROLL WITH IT)  Jack of Diamonds: Itachi  Aces: Naruto, Sasuke, Sakura and....Sai?

In the Manga, is Naruto Hokage or is that only in Gaiden. I've seen alot of fan art of couples from the naruto universe and stuff (Shikamaru and Temari ect.) Is that from when the Manga ended, or just fan fiction stuff? sorry if this is below you guys but some clarification would be cool."

Susano'o used a Totsuka no Tsurugi to kill Orochimaru, a 10 headed demon snake that was terrorizing a village near a river. Inside Orochimaru was, you guessed it, Kusanagi no Tsurugi, which is one of the 3 imperial regalia of Japan, the other 2 being Yasakani no Magatama (a jewel pendant) and Yata no Kagami (a mirror).   Izanami and Izanagi were the 2 god predecessors of Japan and Shinto gods. Wife and husband, Izanami died giving birth to the fire god, Kagutsuchi, which made Izanagi so lonely he traveled to the underworld to revive her. When he found how decayed her body was, he escaped and cleansed himself. There were other ancestral gods even before Izanami and Izanagi, their class name being Kotoamatsukami.  Diving into Wikipedia can tell you a lot. Have fun :)"

So it goes to Itachi.

The thing is that they both know each others strengths and weaknesses, and because Kisame is more of a physical fighter in the sense that he rushes in, and Itachi is more cautious and having tricks up his sleeve, I think I'd give the win to Itachi. A healthy Itachi no doubt, but even an ill Itachi could probably pull it off. The only thing is that if Kisame gets the advantage at any point, he basically wins, but I doubt Itachi would allow that to happen."
Naruto,3d1d4l,ImCodeGreen,5,Sun Jul 12 20:19:16 2015 UTC,ITT people don't have enough respect for Kisame
Naruto,3d1d4l,FlicRair,2,Mon Jul 13 02:12:54 2015 UTC,"people seem to be forgetting that itachi had ninja AIDS and was sick as balls, his MS took A LOT out of him, kisame has basically unlimited stamina, have ot hand it to kisame here"
Naruto,3d1d4l,Dosu_Kinuta,1 point,Mon Jul 13 03:34:37 2015 UTC,What do u mean by ninja AIDS?
Naruto,3d1d4l,SJ_Gemini,2,Mon Jul 13 04:52:42 2015 UTC,"He was sick with some sort of disease which fans just refer to as ""ninja AIDS"" because it isn't explicitly revealed as to what the diseases was or why he contracted it."
Naruto,3d1d4l,HokageEzio,3,Mon Jul 13 05:17:16 2015 UTC,"Kisame would never fight Itachi to the death, too much respect for him.  It'd just end in pure stalemate, Itachi's not a fighter and Kisame respects him.  But if it happened to be a fight to the death, I might have to go with Kisame.  With Samehada, taijutsu is kinda the only way to beat him.  The stronger the opponents chakra, the stronger he gets.  Words from him.  If Susano can be absorbed (which it's just chakra, so there's no way it shouldn't be), that's game.  Not that Itachi's a slouch.    Even in an all out fight, I still think it would only come to a stalemate.  That's just how most of the teams are set up in the Akatsuki, they kinda cancel each other out minus Konan and Pain and Hidan and Kakazu.  Itachi, the calm and collected one.  And Kisame, the freak who loves a fight."
Naruto,3d1d4l,AbidingTruth,4,Sun Jul 12 20:47:09 2015 UTC,"My money is on Kisame. Ninjutsu won't work on Kisame, and while not officially stated, I'm very certain Samehada can break Kisame out of the standard genjutsus Itachi employs during the start of a battle. Kisame is capable of changing the entire landscape of their arena to be a small ocean, giving him an advantage of shark summons, water ninjutsu from any point around Itachi, attacking from below, etc. We don't know if Samehada can break Kisame out of Tsukiyomi, but someone of Kisame's caliber would know not to look into the eyes of a Sharingan user in the first place.   As for Amaterasu, Kisame has either one of two ways to deal with it. One is Samehada absorbing it. This has never been confirmed or denied either, but Amaterasu is a ninjutsu that uses chakra, Samehada eats chakra, so theoretically it should work. But even then, if Kisame could get within close combat range of Itachi, which is entirely possible, prolonged fighting would allow Kisame to sap Itachi's chakra and use it to continuously heal Amaterasu. In this scenario, it would likely end in a stalemate. But it's likely that Kisame would not get his by Amaterasu in the first place, as before Amaterasu is cast, skilled shinobi can sense a build up of chakra in the user's eye. Knowing that Amaterasu is coming, Kisame can retreat underground/underwater and use superior mobility to keep moving and avoid Itachi's line of sight.  If Itachi pulls out Susano'o, the likely response from Kisame is to use Water Prison Shark Dance and fuse with Samehada to have even more mobility in all three axis of space in order to get around his Susano'o. Once Kisame uses this technique, I don't see anyway of Itachi surviving. He will either be killed by Kisame's attacks or have his chakra completely drained with his superior underwater mobility or he will drown"
Naruto,3d1d4l,knownbynone,2,Sun Jul 12 21:51:05 2015 UTC,So say they go all out...how do you think Kisame would deal with susano'os Sword of Tetsuya and Yata Mirror?
Naruto,3d1d4l,AbidingTruth,1 point,Sun Jul 12 23:51:06 2015 UTC,"First, going all out and using Susano'o the minute combat begins is out of character for Itachi. But in this hypothetical, going all out for Kisame means instantly using Water Prison Shark Dance and fusing with Samehada. His mobility greatly increases underwater while Itachi and his Susano'o become restricted by the water. Totsuka Blade's sealing only works when stabbed, a pinpoint attack that Kisame can easily avoid in this scenario. Yata Mirror is most useful blocking big, long ranged and powerful attacks. When Kisame uses this tactic, he swims around his opponent and goes in for melee strikes or holds his opponent sapping his chakra. Yata Mirror is like a regular shield, Itachi can only hold off Kisame's assault from one direction and inside Water Prison Shark Dance, Kisame can not only traverse back/forward and left/right, but also up/down. Even if he cannot get past Yata Mirror for some reason, all he has to do is avoid Totsuka Blade and Itachi will drown"
Naruto,3d1d4l,knownbynone,2,Mon Jul 13 00:05:56 2015 UTC,"Yeah putting all of that together really makes me think Kisame would win it. Considering the only way Gai was able to beat him was with a long range, massive, physical attack. It really is the only way."
Naruto,3d1d4l,AbidingTruth,2,Mon Jul 13 01:02:13 2015 UTC,"Yeah, Water Prison Shark Dance and Samehada is just too powerful of a combination. Before we saw his fight with Killer Bee, I probably would have said that Itachi would take him, but since the addition of Kisame's trump card, there are really only a few people in the world who can beat him should he use that attack. Not many truly understand how strong he is, and how strong that jutsu is Imo, I feel like he gets underrated a lot"

The only hope Kisame has is being able to avoid amaterasu and the totsuka blade until Itachi is fatigued.

Naruto,3d1d4l,Lord4th,1 point,Sun Jul 12 18:52:46 2015 UTC,"Well Itachi is easily the overall stronger of the 2. That's for certain, but the actually fight is a bit different.  I would say Itachi still. Amaterasu is enough to take him out. And I'm not sure Samehada is sentient enough to break Kisame out of a genjutsu."
Naruto,3d1d4l,HokageEzio,1 point,Sun Jul 12 20:16:59 2015 UTC,"Pretty sure Samehada just has a complete mind of it's own.  It's filled with chakra, it should work on genjutsu.  That's how they fuse together."
Naruto,3d1d4l,Lord4th,1 point,Sun Jul 12 20:36:30 2015 UTC,But would it be aware and smart enough to know Kisame is in a genjutsu and then know how to get him out?
Naruto,3d1d4l,HokageEzio,1 point,Sun Jul 12 20:38:27 2015 UTC,"I don't see why not, the relationship with the sword is that they distribute chakra back and forth.  That's why it left for Bee in the first place, more food."
Naruto,3d1d4l,Sm0kescreeen,3,Sun Jul 12 20:40:57 2015 UTC,"The real question is can Samehada break Kisame out of Tsukuyomi (hope I spelled that right). Unlike other genjutsu it isn't something that can be easily broken, even if someone else disturbs it. Tsunade is the only person we've seen break it in someone else, and that's because she's the best Medical Ninja in the world. Samehada also has great healing abilities so maybe it can break it also."
Naruto,3d1d4l,HokageEzio,1 point,Sun Jul 12 20:50:28 2015 UTC,"Well medical ninjutsu is just extreme chakra control, and Samehada showed that same skill level.  So again, I don't see why it wouldn't break Kisame out.  Obviously if it can't that's a giant ass loss."

Naruto,3d1d4l,artyboi37,0,Mon Jul 13 00:29:39 2015 UTC,"Everyone's acting like Itachi would have to fight with susanoo. As far as I am aware, Kisame could be caught in genjustu and that would be the end of it. I don't think he could avoid it either, as the mangekyou sharingan enables the user to cast a genjutsu without making eye contact."
Naruto,3d1d4l,Spartn90,1 point,Sun Jul 12 21:32:13 2015 UTC,"Kisame would surely know a way around his genjutsu, Itachi can only cast it through his eyes and finger point, even if he was caught, Samehada would bite him and break him out of it."
Naruto,3d1d4l,artyboi37,3,Mon Jul 13 01:41:46 2015 UTC,If he was caught in Tsukuyomi it wouldn't matter if Samehada broke him out of it because it only takes a second to completely run its course.

Back in Pain Invasion, Shizune had no chance against the Pain that could suck people Souls, while in the Edo Tensei War, Naruto resisted Nagato's attempt to suck his soul.   Back to the topic, we only saw Totsuka Sword being used twice, against Orochimaru and Nagato, two ""humans"". We do not know the effects one Sage Madara, Sage Obito... Maybe they could resist the sealing and retaliate, or maybe they would be sealed and Kishimoto just threw one godly artifact in the trash."

Naruto,3cys4k,Bionike,80,Sun Jul 12 00:27:09 2015 UTC,"""Konoha"" is not a country it's a city in the village of fire.  The city IS the military of the country.  The best way to think of it is like an army base.  On army bases there is military law for soldiers and their family which supersedes civilian law, and along with military courts.  For instance, it is illegal for soldiers to commit adultery in the U.S. under military law.  Konoha belongs to the land of fire which is run by the feudal lord.  So I believe the land of fire is actually a monarchy.  The hokage of Konoha is chosen by the feudal lord but must be confirmed by the Jonin of Konoha making a vote of confidence.EDIT:  FailureQT points out that the daimyo only chooses the next Hokage when the previous hokage is incapacitated(Tsunade/Hiruzen).  In conclusion, Konoha is the military of a monarchical country with some republican values.    edit:  Some people have made a few valid points that I'd like to expand on.  ZacUAX says ""Daimyo don't seem to be much more than figureheads.  The Kage are the true leaders who make all the big decisions. . .  Of note specifically is the 1st Kage Summit wherein the village deals were established and the bijuu distributed. No daimyo in sight.""  The village country relationship does not exactly parallel the military country relationship.  My theory was made to make a best approximation towards existing military and government systems.  The villages are technically independent entities that govern their own and can enter into contracts with other lands/villages.  The biggest difference is the ability of a village to hire itself out to the daimyo of foreign countries, and daimyo's ability hiring foreign villages.  Imagine the U.S. hiring Mexico's army like the Land of the Wind daimyo hiring foreign villages. It would be flat out treason.  Each village seems to be associated with a particular daimyo so I doubt they could directly be hired for war against their own land, but they are ultimately independent and able to settle their affairs.  In the latest Gaara hiden this theme is expanded on.  The Wind daimyo views the 4th shinobi war as a shinobi issue, and  not one that he needs to repay the shinobi for.  Implying that the village hidden in the sand can enter into war independently from its country.  The daimyo are not figure heads(I know you've moved away from considering them that too), they seem to govern the countries' wealth and civil law.  I'd describe them as being independent of the villages. Great point though ZacUAX.  Extra information: Vilages are somewhere between a bound military and mercenary group.  Coincidentally, if you do any research on feudalism(Japan's or Europes) this is actually how most militaries started out.  Loosely organized groups that were hired out by wealthy land owners to enforce the law.  The leaders would have their personal guards(the 12 guardian ninja) but would mostly rely on armies who were truly loyal to their shogun, or knights loyal to their leader.  After time these shogun became associated with one particularly wealthy landowner and developed into an military.  This is the exact path that is shown in the creation of the village system with hashirama moving the Senju from mercenaries to a village with the Uchiha.   The villages could have begun with almost no daimyo association(first kage summit) and have become more connected to their homeland over time, but that is more conjecture than supported by cannon."
Naruto,3cys4k,yazsh,7,Sun Jul 12 02:51:46 2015 UTC,This is the correct answer.
Naruto,3cys4k,Cobalt_88,9,Sun Jul 12 03:05:40 2015 UTC,"This one is close, but if you look at the way the Villages are run, the Daimyo don't seem to be much more than figureheads. The Kage are the true leaders who make all the big decisions, hence things like the Kage Summits.   Of note specifically is the 1st Kage Summit wherein the village deals were established and the bijuu distributed. No daimyo in sight.   Edit: /u/yazsh made an excellent edit up top that makes a ton of sense. Make sure you read that, as it basically answers my objection."
Naruto,3cys4k,ZacUAX,8,Sun Jul 12 03:26:04 2015 UTC,"Military leaders meet and make deals all the time. Presidents don't run every single thing in their countries.  Also, the Kage are selected (with much prompting, sure) by the daimyo. Much like heads of state select the heads of military and paramilitary organizations."
Naruto,3cys4k,chaosattractor,5,Sun Jul 12 03:44:46 2015 UTC,"Well president can veto deals( and I don't think the daimyo could veto Hashirama, let alone the Raikage A haha).  I made an expanded post to ZacUAX above, if you're interested give it a read."
Naruto,3cys4k,yazsh,1 point,Sun Jul 12 05:05:03 2015 UTC,"The First Kage Summit literally changed the shinobi world to its very core. I'm not saying the Daimyo aren't important, but this level of importance for a meeting would likely warrant ALL important leaders, not just military ones."
Naruto,3cys4k,ZacUAX,8,Sun Jul 12 04:36:21 2015 UTC,"You're still going under the assumption that the daimyou were not aware of what was happening at the meeting.  When military leaders meet the presidents aren't there, but of course they know about it, the issues leading up to it and what their faction is going to propose. Come to think of it, world leaders don't go places, it's mostly the secretaries of state and people like that."
Naruto,3cys4k,chaosattractor,7,Sun Jul 12 04:45:42 2015 UTC,"This one is close, but if you look at the way the Villages are run, the Daimyo don't seem to be much more than figureheads. The Kage are the true leaders who make all the big decisions, hence things like the Kage Summits.    In all Kage Summits, dealings always dealt with the safety and protection of the region that the shinobis were entrusted with. In the first Kage Summit, it was all about dissemination of arms that the ""then"" superpower Konoha had. Then the latest Kage Summit dealt with the international threat that is Madara. If you think about it, it was never about running the economy and legal infrastructure of any country.  The Daimyos are not a figurehead, it just seems that way because of how we only mostly see shinobi perspectives and never the political dealings of daimyo to daimyo or daimyo to vassals.  EDIT: Spelling"
Naruto,3cys4k,ixvael,3,Sun Jul 12 03:50:56 2015 UTC,"That is true, Naruto as a story has next to no dealings with economic or legal problems. Figurehead was too strong a word.   The Kage definitely seem to wield more power, however. They also don't seem to answer to the daimyo after election. At least, if they do, I can't think of an example."
Naruto,3cys4k,ZacUAX,2,Sun Jul 12 04:37:52 2015 UTC,"In what way do the Kage wield more power? The Kage are more like generals than anything and have no say about what's being done in the Fire Country as a whole. Who do you think is supplying Konoha with land and money? Konoha is not self-sustaining, there is a reason they are aligned with the Fire Country.  Remember when Konoha was founded? The Fire Country are the ones who supplied them with the land and money to operate. Just because the Kage are the head of the military does not mean they hold all the power, they don't hold much of it at all.  Everything had to be run by and approved by the Daimyo. They couldn't go to war without the Daimyo's approval, they couldn't declare the next Kage without the Daimyo and his board's approval... All major decisions regarding the country are made by the Daimyo, not the Kage. All military decisions are made by the Kage, but that doesn't mean the Kage holds more authority than the Daimyo."
Naruto,3cys4k,dynrte,3,Sun Jul 12 04:52:46 2015 UTC,"It actually does. The military of a country is the might of that country. If a kage decides to replace the daimyo there is nothing stopping him/her from doing that. There are reasons why they shouldn't, but ultimately the kage is the one to decide on military matters, and the military is the real power of a country. Money only has value as long as everyone agree that it does. Might makes right is a rule of nature and is always true. I can imagine that the vote for the next kage was only necessary because there was no clear successor."
Naruto,3cys4k,Caliburn0,2,Sun Jul 12 10:05:20 2015 UTC,"I disagree. While the military of a country might be strength of a country, it does not mean the Kage holds more authority than the Fire Country's leadership itself. There is a reason that the village is affiliated with the Fire Country in the first place.  If a Kage decides to replace a Daimyo, there is people to stop them from doing that. It's been shown multiple times throughout the series that the villages have other ""elders"" who hold just as much authority as the Kage does. If a Kage decides to go rogue on their nation they would simply be destroying their own village. Why do you think all the clans in the warring-states era moved to a village and agreed to serve the country instead of themselves? For safety.  With the shinobi-for-hire system in particular, money can buy you a military force. If your Kage decides to go rogue you can pay off somebody (another village) to send assassins. The Kage is dead. What happens then? The rest of the shinobi who followed the Kage are sent into chaos and don't know what to do next.  There's also no guarantee that everyone in the village will blindly follow the Kage's orders (as seen throughout the series), especially if it's to overtake the daimyo. It doesn't matter if they declare they're taking over, they don't have the money, land, or resources to try and do anything to the daimyo. Why would anyone sacrifice their safety and go back to the era of warring states chaos? There's literally zero reason to. That's why the daimyo holds more power than the Kage. The Kage cannot even touch the daimyo without risking absolutely everything that isn't inside their village. The Fire Country provides safety, money, and resources for the shinobi (hence why clans joined and formed villages in the first place), and in exchange the village forms a military.  It doesn't matter if the Kage is the commander of that military when they still have other people to answer to, when they don't own the land, money, or resources, etc. If worst comes to worst you hire the best shinobi available from another village and just kill your current Kage. The Kage doesn't hold as much authority as the daimyo does."
Naruto,3cys4k,dynrte,3,Sun Jul 12 11:43:06 2015 UTC,"I see your point. But it is also stated directly in the manga that the hidden village and the nation they inhabit is on equal footing Source. When I say there is no one to stop the kage from taking over, I didn't mean there is nothing, there is just nobody. The twelve guardian ninja, (which by the way doesn't exist anymore in fire country) Does not have the power to stand up to a kage and a village's strongest ninja. They can simply kill the Daimyo and perform a coup. That was what happened in snow country."
Naruto,3cys4k,Caliburn0,0,Sun Jul 12 11:52:12 2015 UTC,I agree that they are on equal footing. I disagree that the Kage holds more authority than the Daimyo (which you said they DID hold more authority than the Daimyo).

A little clarification about this part. When Hashirama first formed Konoha, he proposed the ""Village system"" to the existing Fire Daimyo at the time. This Daimyo in turn gave Hashirama the area where Konoha now exists. Considering this information, the Hokage-Daimyo relationship already exists in the formation of an official shinobi village.  Edit: confused Wind country with Fire country."

Naruto,3cys4k,yazsh,1 point,Sun Jul 12 08:05:02 2015 UTC,"LOL, I messed up. Read back between Chapter 625-626 and the land was handpicked by Hashirama and Madara when they were still young.  About the proposal part, it's just something I interpreted from Chapter 625 dialogue between Hashirama and Tobirama so it could be more or less wrong.  Tobirama interrupted Madara and Hashirama's bro scene because they had to meet with the heads of the Country of Fire. This meeting would result in who the Hokage is. Based on what Tobirama said, the country heads and the village people should be responsible for choosing the Hokage (predating the culture of only shinobi choosing their kage). This means that Konoha is already integrated with the country.  The ""Shinobi Village"" blueprint that Hashirama talked about while sitting atop the face mountain was what made me think that this system was proposed by Hashirama as a means to realize his and Madara's dream."
Naruto,3cys4k,ixvael,1 point,Sun Jul 12 11:17:33 2015 UTC,"Actually the new Hokage is selected by the current Hokage upon their retirement, but if the old Hokage dies or is incapacitated before being able to do so, the Fire Daimyō appoints a Hokage Candidate upon the recommendation of the Konoha council and the Fire Daimyō council. Afterwards, the candidate will need to be approved by the jōnin of the village to become officially Hokage."
Naruto,3cys4k,FailerQt,1 point,Sun Jul 12 08:40:44 2015 UTC,"Hey wow, that is an excellent point.  Are we sure that the daimyo has no say in choosing the next hokage or that he just usually  defers to the hokage?"
Naruto,3cys4k,yazsh,1 point,Sun Jul 12 18:00:25 2015 UTC,It is true. When Tsunade was incapacitated after the battle with Pain there was a selection with the Konoha council and the fire Daimyo council. Tobirama named Hiruzen Hokage just before he went to sacrifice himself. Also the wiki is saying that the Hokage is normally chosen by the previous Hokage.

Naruto,3cys4k,yazsh,1 point,Sun Jul 12 19:25:44 2015 UTC,"From what I've seen it's more like the hidden villages are independent city-states, which are very closely allied to the nation they're situated in, and which the Daimyos pay to be on call in case they need an army of ninjas in addition to their regular militaries.  Like if the Vatican's swiss guard was a powerful fighting force instead of just mostly ceremonial, and Italy paid them to assassinate enemy politicians and do border patrols, etc."
Naruto,3cys4k,MadScientist14159,7,Sun Jul 12 18:23:56 2015 UTC,"Well this doesn't really answer your question but I think it's safe to say that Konoha was a lot less morally inclined than it appeared it to be in the manga/anime.   'Specially since it was serialised in WSJ, so Kishi didn't portray the harsher and more twisted missions they accepted, like assassination and obtaining info from unwilling people."

The United States is, by the will of the Founders & the founding documents, not a military centric country. Before WWII we only raised real armies for the occasions of war. Having to maintain an army sufficient to fight the soviets is what has made the current US military centric. Konoha was founded with the intention of military defense to maintain order. It was created with a strong military in mind.     But at the same time Konoha is a pretty liberal nation with far more advanced belief of morality and ethics.   The idea of Ninja Villages in the Naruto universe & the idea's introduction is comparable to the rise of Democracy throughout the world in the 18th & 19th century so in this regard Konoha, being the first, is very liberal. I would argue however that because of things like the atrocities comitted by the village & for instance Naruto's treatment as a child, that Konoha isn't anymore advanced morally than any other country or village.    However their army is the one that selects the president, so it's not a direct democracy.   This was what made me want to reply the most. What you described & what Konoha truly is by definition, is a military junta. While the Land of Fire itself seems to be Feudalistic, Konoha, being ran by a member of the military & appointed by the other members of the military, is a military dictatorship.   EDIT: Grammar"

Naruto,3cys4k,chaosattractor,1 point,Sun Jul 12 03:46:05 2015 UTC,He was the student of Minato. I never said the same clan I said the same party. If you're the student of the Hokage you're probably going to be the Hokage. That not fair who's to say someone else couldn't be a better candidate. Just because he's your student doesn't make him more qualified then someone who isn't. I use Konoha's White Fang and Itachi as an example. Two great shinobi who didn't happen to be students of the current Hokage of their time. Both of them royally fucked  by this so called Democratic system.

Naruto,3czz7t,Khaijit,12,Sun Jul 12 09:03:07 2015 UTC,I think Orchimaru is more evil but Madara had a far worse impact.
Naruto,3czz7t,BasedNoface,0,Sun Jul 12 11:09:07 2015 UTC,"Very true, and a very interesting observation. Orochimaru is very much the more evil one, and if it wasn't for him, a lot of the conflicts in the series wouldn't have happened. But Madara...actually, no, wait, it's all Orochimaru!   That guy caused everything, but then he squirms out of it at the last minute!"
Naruto,3czz7t,Rosebunse,1 point,Sun Jul 12 15:52:48 2015 UTC,If it wasn't for Madara setting everything up history could've been altered in a dramatic way.

Naruto,3czz7t,Rosebunse,8,Mon Jul 13 12:46:23 2015 UTC,"I think you portrayed Madara way too lightly. Their ambitions are different but both are cruel and merciless, they didn't hesitate to kill innocent people to achieve their goals. What Madara did to Obito was horrible, really. He basically broke some boy's life to enforce his plan.   Although I would agree Orochimaru is/was more evil because he fucked up more people's lives."
Naruto,3czz7t,ohnoyouwont,4,Sun Jul 12 09:15:37 2015 UTC,"Madara had valid goals and was justified by the cycle of hatred but he used brutal methods to do so, was an hypocrite (wanted to stop war and violence yet makes rape faces when Hashirama is near, loudly enjoys the prospect of crushing bones when he's back in a blood and flesh body, laugh madly after licking his blood, gleefully fight Gai when the youth man manage to wound him, willing to postpone his plans to fight the Gokage then Hashirama), tortured Obito to continue his plans, was a gigantic dick to nearly everyone and has no problems disposing of allies to continue his plans.  Orochimaru is a monster, an awful, awful monster, but Madara is not saint himself and ultimately have a greater negative impact on the ninja world than Oro."
Naruto,3czz7t,Bolded,12,Sun Jul 12 12:27:02 2015 UTC,"Every drop of blood on Obito's hands is Madara's fault.  So no.  Orochimaru fucked up a lot of lives, but nowhere near the reach of what was indirectly caused by him through Obito.  Uchiha Massacre.  9 tails attack.  Nagato going south (hell Nagato being dragged in in the first place).  All of this is Madara's fault, his reach is through the entire ninja world."
Naruto,3czz7t,HokageEzio,10,Sun Jul 12 09:32:17 2015 UTC,"I think you're misunderstanding the question. Destruction =/= evil. Madara obviously caused destruction and death on a level Orochimaru couldn't ever hope to match, but he did so with good intentions. That doesn't excuse his actions, but it makes him far less evil than Orochimaru. Everything he did, he did with the purpose of creating a perfect world in which nothing bad would have to happen. His intentions were good. Orochimaru, on the other hand, is purely evil. He is similarly willing to cause massive levels of destruction (as seen with the Konoha Invasion), is entirely amoral and seems to take a perverse delight in his cruelties. His goal is entirely self centered. He has no redeeming factor to his evils. You have to take into account the reasons and intentions of the person, otherwise Minato is one of the most evil men to ever live. He did, after all, commit one of the single worst massacre in history."
Naruto,3czz7t,onlytoask,8,Sun Jul 12 12:47:50 2015 UTC,"Different definitions for different people.  Madara knew full well the path he was sending Obito down, regardless of the intentions.  Obito had good intentions too.  Hell is paved with them.  And your Minato bit makes no sense :/"
Naruto,3czz7t,HokageEzio,7,Sun Jul 12 12:52:49 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry, I didn't see your last sentence.   Minato massacred something like 1000 Iwa nin in the space of a few minutes. He killed on a level few could ever hope to match. On the surface, this act is evil. He murdered hundreds. But neither you or I would consider it evil, or even negative, because of his intentions. He didn't do it for fun or because he wanted to take over the world or some such. He did it to protect his country. His intentions were good even though his action was not."
Naruto,3czz7t,onlytoask,2,Sun Jul 12 13:07:12 2015 UTC,He also sentenced his son to a loveless life in which he was ignored and ostracized for over a decade.
Naruto,3czz7t,onlytoask,-1,Sun Jul 12 13:08:26 2015 UTC,"Different scenario.  He did not do it to manipulate Naruto.  The only way his action would equal what Madara did is if he himself ripped the 9 tails out of Kushina, made it rampage through the village, and then sealed it into Naruto so he could be the Child of Prophecy.  And to the war bit, again, different scenario.  Madara both created the situation to weaken Obito, and then took advantage of that weakness for his own plan.  His reason was not ""I believe in you Obito""."
Naruto,3czz7t,HokageEzio,1 point,Sun Jul 12 13:13:02 2015 UTC,"Again, I didn't say they were the same, just similar.  Beyond what I've said already, I don't know how else I can make my point because you're just ignoring me. I feel like you are being purposefully obtuse so you don't have to admit you might have been wrong."
Naruto,3czz7t,onlytoask,4,Sun Jul 12 13:16:37 2015 UTC,How am I wrong if this is solely opinion based...?
Naruto,3czz7t,HokageEzio,4,Sun Jul 12 13:17:31 2015 UTC,That is exactly what I meant when I said you are ignoring my points and being purposefully obtuse.
Naruto,3czz7t,onlytoask,1 point,Sun Jul 12 13:20:16 2015 UTC,"You're absolutely right, but the action itself is only half of the equation. He knew that he was sending Obito down a path that was going to end in world peace."
Naruto,3czz7t,onlytoask,0,Sun Jul 12 12:54:12 2015 UTC,"And Obito didn't mind killing all those people because they ""weren't reality"".  He was just doing it for peace too.  Doesn't take any of the blood off his hands, and that blood is equally on Madara's hands."
Naruto,3czz7t,HokageEzio,2,Sun Jul 12 12:56:52 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying it does. I'm saying intentions matter when you're trying to gauge something like evil. If you are going to ignore the intentions behind the act and decide based solely on the act itself, then you have to admit that Minato is decidedly evil."
Naruto,3czz7t,onlytoask,2,Sun Jul 12 13:01:39 2015 UTC,"Minato did not manipulate anybody into doing his bidding.  He did not set up a well planned murder solely for his end goal.  If intentions matter this much to making a character not evil, Danzo would be a super well received character.  He just did what he thought would lead to a safe Leaf Village after all."
Naruto,3czz7t,HokageEzio,3,Sun Jul 12 13:04:30 2015 UTC,"I didn't say intentions take everything away. I just said they matter significantly and that is why Orochimaru is more evil. Madara is also evil, just less so. Minato did massacre hundreds and entence his son to a loveless childhood in which he was ostracized by his village. You can't have it both ways. Either Minato is a very evil fellow, or intentions matter."
Naruto,3czz7t,onlytoask,1 point,Sun Jul 12 13:12:29 2015 UTC,What did Minato do?
Naruto,3czz7t,night4345,0,Sun Jul 12 13:04:42 2015 UTC,He massacred something like 1000 Iwa nin. He also ended up sentencing his son to a loveless childhood during which he was ostracized by his entire village.
Naruto,3czz7t,onlytoask,3,Sun Jul 12 13:09:53 2015 UTC,The hell are you downvoted for? That's exactly what happened.  This guy wrote it like this to show that intentions matter if you do something.
Naruto,3czz7t,FakeAdminAccount,3,Mon Jul 13 09:54:44 2015 UTC,well if that's the standard then madara is innocent too. He was manipulated by black zetsu.
Naruto,3czz7t,Tsugo,2,Sun Jul 12 23:58:29 2015 UTC,"Depends really from what you understand as evil . Madara kills without mercy hell he probably killed more people with that first meteor in his first episode than Orochimaru did his whole life  . Even thou his reasons maybe good his execution is horrible , most of the events in Naruto are his fault . You could blame him for Asumas/Jirayas/Minatos/Kushinas and many more deaths if you think about it . Also who said that the inf . Tsukonomi would lead to peace he tried to enforce it on the world . He didnt go and say hey Hashirama,Tobirama I have this plan that will probably lead to peace and make the world a better place lets talk with other Kages and the villagers and decide if the world wants to do it . He just went killed a lot of people ruined the lives of many other and proclaimed he brings peace . And what exactly are Orochimarus end goals ? To figure the secrets of life / learn everything . Who said that when he does it he wont do something good with that knowledge . Madara is more evil ."
Naruto,3czz7t,Thatguy69Kappa,2,Sun Jul 12 13:24:56 2015 UTC,"Motivations would be the point to go to for me.  Madara viewed the lives he took as necessary sacrifices in order to bring the only true peace to the world.  He was lied to and tricked by a being far older than him, but his motivations were to help people.  He would kill hundreds, if not thousands, to save millions, as it were.  I also don't think he'd need to resort to war like Obito chose to do, he was just dead and couldn't do it himself.  I don't really think Madara was evil, or even Obito, they were just damaged by the curse of hatred and trying to do their best to save the world.  Orochimaru on the other hand had purely selfish goals.  He wanted to live forever and be powerful, so he tortured, killed and experimented on hundreds of individuals to pursue his goals.  He took over people's bodies against their wills and used them for the few years he could then cast them aside, trading the decades of their lives for a few years for him.  In the end, I think Orochimaru was far more evil than Madara and Obito.  Madara and Obito harmed more people, but they did so seeking to save the world, and nothing worth having is free.  Orochimaru was like Voldemort and so afraid of death he was willing to do anything to avoid it, no matter who he hurt."
Naruto,3czz7t,Baruu,1 point,Sun Jul 12 23:20:23 2015 UTC,"Madara has ruined more lives but his goals are more, for lack of a better word, noble than Orochimaru's, so I'm going to say that Orochimaru is more evil."

Looking at the number dead isn't really a good measure of how evil someone is. Hell even naruto killed people.   If you look at the motives then yeah, I would agree with OP and say that oro is more evil. He really just wanted revenge and to hurt people. Madara in the end wanted a world without war and pain. I think madara had better intentions than oro.   Edit: okay, naruto doesn't really kill anyone."

Orochimaru, on the other hand, is similarly willing to cause massive levels of destruction (as seen with the Konoha Invasion) is entirely amoral and seems to take a perverse delight in his cruelties.

People complain about Sakura's perceived uselessness and to think that if Kishi gave her some moderate genjutsu ability along with her taijutsu and medical ninjutsu would have mitigated those complaints is an interesting  thought.

Naruto,3cy71n,OldWoodenFap,4,Sun Jul 12 03:54:29 2015 UTC,watch episode 101 even tho it's filler
Naruto,3cy71n,IAmTheWasted,1 point,Sun Jul 12 02:46:44 2015 UTC,"This guy nailed it....follow the canon list and you'll be done with this show in NO time.  Its a wild, fun ride."
Naruto,3cy71n,PugSwagMaster,2,Sun Jul 12 12:15:52 2015 UTC,"Also honestly its so much easier and faster to read it. But really now that shipuden manga is finished I guess watching it ain't so bad, but if you read it you'll probably finish the manga before the anime finishes."
Naruto,3cy71n,IAmTheWasted,2,Sun Jul 12 07:42:52 2015 UTC,"What I'm doing is I'm watching every anime episode (minus filler) until I'm caught up to where the English dub is, then I'll either just read the manga, or just suck it up and watch the Japanese sub."

Naruto,3cy71n,tipytop,11,Sun Jul 12 16:40:59 2015 UTC,yes youre missing Hal the story
Naruto,3cy71n,Thr0s,6,Sat Jul 11 21:47:35 2015 UTC,"Episode 1 is under a category called ""Naruto Shippuden: The Kazekage's Rescue"". Is the difference that big from manga to anime?    I legit laughed out loud. Your friend was kind enough to stop you, but didn't explain? whats that about."

Naruto,3cz9aj,narx33,5,Sun Jul 12 03:20:14 2015 UTC,Respect this is probably my favorite one besides Minato. I also like rasengan. Bah so many good ones

Naruto,3cz91j,FakeAdminAccount,6,Mon Jul 13 10:08:00 2015 UTC,"Other than the obvious answer of 'because imagery', it's possible there were other celestial bodies around Narutoverse's earth at one point. I mean, if they could create a moon, surely they could pull a Piccolo and destroy it.   Otherwise, it might not be a moon. Or a sun for that matter. Were they ever called out as such?"
Naruto,3cz91j,ZacUAX,5,Sun Jul 12 03:31:19 2015 UTC,"No it isn't, it is referred to as yin-yang which is shown in Japan as Yin being dark and Yang being light. The Star is the light and the crescent is the dark."
Naruto,3cz91j,Legovil,2,Sun Jul 12 03:34:21 2015 UTC,There was still probably a celestial object. The moon is very important and not having one is a bit of a supreme error.  I always thought that it was destroyed during the Kaguya vs Sages bros battle.
Naruto,3cz91j,Bolded,1 point,Sun Jul 12 08:45:41 2015 UTC,"The Japanese 陰 'yin' represents ""the negative"": The moon as opposed to the sun, the shadow as opposed to the light, the shade as opposed to the sunshine, the unseen/private as opposed to the seen/open.  So it isn't based on the story, but based on real life imagery. :)"
Naruto,3cy2a4,AllOfEverythingEver,42,Sat Jul 11 20:31:02 2015 UTC,Hidan and Kakuzu vs Kakashi and Team 10 in the anime. Probably the best choreography in the entire show and barely anyone ever talks about it
Naruto,3cy2a4,AbidingTruth,10,Sat Jul 11 21:57:10 2015 UTC,"I agree, I liked all the strategy behind the fight and of course Kakashi. Also the first episode with a Rasen-shuriken which is one of my favourite jutsu in the show. (Although I prefer the Futon: Rasengan because it does nearly as much damage, uses less chakra and can be used in a closer range situation)."
Naruto,3cy2a4,Legovil,1 point,Sun Jul 12 03:39:05 2015 UTC,"I didn't think he threw a rasenshuriken until pein, and he just hit kakuzu with the wind style rasengan."
Naruto,3cy2a4,Legovil,4,Sun Jul 12 18:29:29 2015 UTC,The throwing isn't why it is the Rasenshuriken. The reason it is the Rasenshuriken is because of the shape.
Naruto,3cy2a4,GreatCucumber,3,Sun Jul 12 20:03:17 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure he hit Kakuzu with the rasenshuriken. He just didn't know how to throw it yet.
Naruto,3cy2a4,Legovil,3,Sun Jul 12 19:50:33 2015 UTC,He couldn't throw it because he didn't have Sage Mode at that time.
Naruto,3cy2a4,Legovil,1 point,Sun Jul 12 20:03:43 2015 UTC,"I don't think he needs sage mode to throw it, I thought he learned it at night while training to use sage mode."
Naruto,3cy2a4,JangoSky,4,Sun Jul 12 20:41:38 2015 UTC,"Nah he needed Sage Mode to throw it, he did extra training using Sage Mode to learn how to throw it."
Naruto,3cy2a4,Legovil,1 point,Mon Jul 13 01:02:31 2015 UTC,"Bruh, I've been on that boat for the longest. Futon: Rasengan makes a lot more sense for what he needs to do untl the Rasenshuriken really becomes necessary"
Naruto,3cy2a4,SpudSSBM,1 point,Mon Jul 13 03:35:31 2015 UTC,Exactly!
Naruto,3cy2a4,Rexzar,3,Mon Jul 13 05:56:26 2015 UTC,THIS 100x this
Naruto,3cy2a4,Legovil,28,Sun Jul 12 03:58:47 2015 UTC,Shikamaru playing his father at shogi while talking about Asuma was a really good scene.
Naruto,3cy2a4,ZacUAX,23,Sun Jul 12 01:10:14 2015 UTC,Shikaku was the only dad in Naruto regularly seen doing dad things.
Naruto,3cy2a4,Legovil,16,Sun Jul 12 01:40:45 2015 UTC,AHEM. MIGHT DAI.
Naruto,3cy2a4,rkellyturbo,17,Sun Jul 12 03:35:58 2015 UTC,"Regularly seen. No doubt Might Dai was S-tier father, but only one real appearance."
Naruto,3cy2a4,HokageEzio,6,Sun Jul 12 04:39:28 2015 UTC,No he did Dai
Naruto,3cy2a4,rkellyturbo,7,Sun Jul 12 18:30:13 2015 UTC,THAT WAS MEAN. MIGHT DAI IS BEST DAD >:O HE DIED FOR A NOBLE CAUSE (like Shikaku did to) BUT EVERYTHING MIGHT DAI DID WAS FOR GAI. EVERYTHINGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG.
Naruto,3cy2a4,volt16,8,Sun Jul 12 20:02:41 2015 UTC,Ironically he said that's the only fatherly thing he ever did with Shikamaru.
Naruto,3cy2a4,Rexzar,6,Sun Jul 12 05:00:18 2015 UTC,"He's humble.  He also was shown having a talk with Shikamaru after the Sasuke Retrieval failure (where he made him cry, which is probably why he didn't see it as such)."
Naruto,3cy2a4,BarneyrealG,5,Sun Jul 12 08:28:23 2015 UTC,True. I think he was talking about more of a father-son bonding thing than giving fatherly advice so that's probably another reason he didn't count that. In that conversation he was kind of speaking to Shikamaru as a colleague as well as his father.
Naruto,3cy2a4,knight504,2,Sun Jul 12 09:01:37 2015 UTC,"Also Shikamaru was always like ""I can't guys, my dad wanted to show me a new jutsu"" so obviously he helped him train."
Naruto,3cy2a4,night4345,2,Sun Jul 12 18:31:19 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't call this scene underrated, however wonderful it may be since this episode in general has been praised by many fans."
Naruto,3cy2a4,tb-talex,1 point,Sun Jul 12 18:14:56 2015 UTC,"Ya I guess underrated would not be the word for it, it does get praise but I also feel like it is often forgotten or overshadowed by fight scenes."
Naruto,3cy2a4,Sharruk,29,Sun Jul 12 22:33:31 2015 UTC,Sasuke vs orochimaru in the forest of dead
Naruto,3cy2a4,tb-talex,12,Sat Jul 11 23:54:57 2015 UTC,This right here. His shuriken wire- dragonflame jutsu combo is one of my favorites in the show.
Naruto,3cy2a4,TheSharkster,19,Sun Jul 12 00:57:57 2015 UTC,Neji vs Kidoumaru.  I really like Kidoumaru's fighting style and Neji shows off plenty of cool tricks during that fight.
Naruto,3cy2a4,4Khazmodan,8,Sat Jul 11 20:45:19 2015 UTC,"I did really like that fight. His spider theme was cool, and Neji's fighting style is one of my favorites in the series. My only gripe is that I wish he, and honestly a lot of other characters, would use other ninja techniques, like  substitution and elemental jutsus to compliment their clan techniques."
Naruto,3cy2a4,Xilent_Lions,6,Sat Jul 11 20:56:34 2015 UTC,My favorite of the Sound Four fights.
Naruto,3cy2a4,FailerQt,5,Sat Jul 11 21:11:21 2015 UTC,For  it was tied with the Shikamaru vs Tayuya fight
Naruto,3cy2a4,Freezzaa,19,Sat Jul 11 21:13:31 2015 UTC,"Shikamaru vs Temari at the Chunin Exams. Not sure if it is highly rated or not, but that is my favourite."
Naruto,3cy2a4,766856,5,Sun Jul 12 07:50:26 2015 UTC,"I love battles of wits, and they both displayed such a huge talent!"
Naruto,3cy2a4,HokageEzio,3,Sun Jul 12 15:12:23 2015 UTC,How intelligent must Shikadai be!?
Naruto,3cy2a4,Spartn90,19,Sun Jul 12 15:47:20 2015 UTC,"Third Hokage vs The First and Second Hokages  Sure they were much weaker than they should have been, but the the animation was great and if you think about the battles we had seen at this point (Zabuza, Chunnin Exams) this fight was on whole new scale."
Naruto,3cy2a4,ArabGuyAli,15,Sun Jul 12 05:03:08 2015 UTC,"Bee vs. Team Taka  Bee derails the Sasuke hype train by fatally wounding Sasuke not once, but TWICE. He then tricks them into thinking they defeated him just so he can have a vacation!"
Naruto,3cy2a4,ixione47,1 point,Sun Jul 12 15:11:14 2015 UTC,That was really badass
Naruto,3cy2a4,BestPeachNA,14,Wed Jul 15 17:40:15 2015 UTC,Tobirama's showing off his chakra scaring the crap out of almost everyone and then Hashirama just casually releasing his chakra scaring everyone including the other Hokages and almost destroying the Uzumaki temple aswell. Wondering why we did not see it often from strong characters.
Naruto,3cy2a4,JangoSky,2,Sat Jul 11 21:54:36 2015 UTC,When was that?
Naruto,3cy2a4,Ry_dawg,5,Sun Jul 12 06:29:16 2015 UTC,When orochimaru resurrected the 4 hokages for sasuke.
Naruto,3cy2a4,Tom38,13,Sun Jul 12 07:27:29 2015 UTC,"Utakata vs Pain, one of my favorite fights."
Naruto,3cy2a4,Vaerynbrah,7,Sat Jul 11 21:57:41 2015 UTC,"I HATE how short it is, great fight."
Naruto,3cy2a4,Thatguy69Kappa,10,Sat Jul 11 23:30:23 2015 UTC,There is a filler fight between Naruto and a pollen Gaara that I have only ever seen mentioned once or twice on the subreddit. It had some amazing animation. I would watch the fight if not the entire episode if you haven't already.
Naruto,3cy2a4,Kill_em_all9898,10,Sun Jul 12 02:20:48 2015 UTC,"not underrated but the scene where shikamaru talked to naruto after jiraiyas death was great.  the most underrated fight imo was choji vs jirobo.   the first time seeing choji, the one ninja i would never think of being a badass, actually being extremly badass was mindblowing back then."
Naruto,3cy2a4,Legovil,5,Sun Jul 12 11:21:46 2015 UTC,"The very short fight between team 7 and team Samui. I could have watched that fight go on forever. At least until Naruto starts to break out his ""supernova"" techniques."
Naruto,3cy2a4,Kill_em_all9898,2,Sat Jul 11 23:23:53 2015 UTC,YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSS. LITERALLY GET SO HYPE BY THIS FIGHT
Naruto,3cy2a4,Toad_Sage_Jiraiya,6,Mon Jul 13 03:38:38 2015 UTC,I personally like the fight between gaara and his dad.  It was actually pretty moving and very unique.
Naruto,3cy2a4,NorseWolves,1 point,Sun Jul 12 17:08:10 2015 UTC,"It was too short in my opinion, it was mostly a flashback from what I can remember."
Naruto,3cy2a4,rkellyturbo,4,Mon Jul 13 14:57:23 2015 UTC,"Team 7 vs Zabuza and Haku. That whole fight was filled with emotions, character development and is probably the only thing that kept me watching the show."
Naruto,3cy2a4,NorseWolves,5,Sun Jul 12 19:21:05 2015 UTC,The episode after Naruto fails to bring back Sasuke . Also when Gaara carries dead Naruto to Tsunade and Sakura and Hinata sees Naruto dead runs at him but stumbles and begs Neji to help Naruto .
Naruto,3cy2a4,samiam3220,1 point,Sat Jul 11 20:55:38 2015 UTC,"I remember the Naruto failing to bring Sasuke back episode, but when was Naruto dead and Gaara carrying him back to Tsunade?  Do you mean recently during the war arc?"
Naruto,3cy2a4,irishsaltytuna,1 point,Sun Jul 12 02:49:23 2015 UTC,I don't think he does because Neji was dead at this point.
Naruto,3cy2a4,Legovil,1 point,Sun Jul 12 03:37:33 2015 UTC,"True.  Shit, now I'm curious; I could have sworn I knew Naruto like the back of my hand."

Naruto,3cy2a4,Dovahking94,14,Sun Jul 12 03:08:18 2015 UTC,underrated
Naruto,3cy2a4,BioshockedNinja,10,Sun Jul 12 03:33:56 2015 UTC,"That is often called the best fight in the show, definitely not underrated."
Naruto,3cy2a4,AwesomeDattebayo,1 point,Sun Jul 12 03:36:52 2015 UTC,"Really? I'd heard it praised but didn't know it was considered the best. Well, still a great fight scene I guess."
Naruto,3cy2a4,sashabr,11,Sun Jul 12 03:50:26 2015 UTC,Yeah it's def considered the best. Before that it was Madara vs the Alliance and hopefully Gai vs Madara next week can top Kakashi vs Obito. Because it fucking should. Gai deserves it.
Naruto,3cy2a4,Sasquatch_in_bush,1 point,Sun Jul 12 04:15:21 2015 UTC,"I've heard the hype, I'm a sucker for spoilers and a long time show watcher, I can't wait. This is the most I've been excited for the show in a long time."
Naruto,3czce4,nocteo,3,Sun Jul 12 03:52:57 2015 UTC,You're gonna wanna start with 668. The anime has already covered some of the chapter in the last 2 episodes but the end of the chapter is where it leaves off.
Naruto,3czce4,rkellyturbo,1 point,Sun Jul 12 05:07:39 2015 UTC,"As rkellyturbo said you should start from chapter 668. And to read the manga online, you can use www.mangastream.to (the best online free manga website) or www.mangapanda.com . There are other manga sites too but they just host mangastream's and mangapanda's translations. :)"
Naruto,3cz90k,Sherlock_87,14,Sun Jul 12 03:17:23 2015 UTC,Nothing was ever said about only being able to have one type of animal summon. In theory you can have as many as you contract with.
Naruto,3cz90k,Rambro332,2,Sun Jul 12 03:23:59 2015 UTC,"That makes sense, it just caught me off guard because no other character is ever seen with 2 different summons"

Naruto,3cz90k,Arjun_Nair,9,Sun Jul 12 06:54:12 2015 UTC,Dude... Pain has like 5 summonings
Naruto,3cz90k,LastOfTheDovahkiin,2,Sun Jul 12 07:48:53 2015 UTC,"And before anyone asks, no, the rinnegan isn't a prerequisite."
Naruto,3cz90k,Arjun_Nair,1 point,Wed Jul 15 08:01:13 2015 UTC,Haha I too thought that someone would have said that.

Naruto,3cz90k,Ootsutsuki,8,Sun Jul 12 03:31:51 2015 UTC,"Yeah but thats the same species, Sasuke pulls out a snake and a hawk"
Naruto,3cz90k,Approximate_Knowledg,9,Sun Jul 12 03:33:39 2015 UTC,And it's funny because a hawk often eats a snake.  someone find the deep psychological meaning behind this.
Naruto,3cz90k,bangbangahah,13,Sun Jul 12 04:22:58 2015 UTC,Under orochimarus tutelage sasuke was a snake but after he found out the truth he wanted to shed his skin and spread his wings . Sasuke changed his team name accordingly from snake to hawk.
Naruto,3cz90k,narx33,3,Sun Jul 12 05:48:27 2015 UTC,"Uh....He summoned it first while fighting danzo, a snake in konoha working behind the scenes with orochimaru and ROOT   lol i dunno"

Naruto,3cz90k,HokageEzio,3,Sun Jul 12 16:22:54 2015 UTC,"you know how summons have ""contracts""? maybe it's possible to have more than 1 contract and the summoner can intentionally choose which animal they want to summon."
Naruto,3cz90k,Baruu,6,Sun Jul 12 03:24:14 2015 UTC,"Even Tobi didn't know, he basically said what fans said.  ""When the fuck did that happen?""  Apparently psychological meaning trumps actually writing a contract."

Naruto,3cvg24,LastOfTheDovahkiin,2,Sat Jul 11 22:43:42 2015 UTC,I think konan should be queen of something. And deidara. For lols.

Naruto,3cvg24,Hiratoshi,3,Sat Jul 11 04:37:39 2015 UTC,I'm guessing it is because of his weapon.
Naruto,3cvg24,Hiratoshi,1 point,Sat Jul 11 15:44:57 2015 UTC,"Well first I asked myself what suit he'd be. Spades made sense. Then for the card, his scythe has three blades and if I remember correctly, his ring meant ""3"" so I made it that. If it were to be part of an Akatsuki Deck, (I've made one of Sasori and one of Kakuzu too) then I'd probably bump him up to king. But then I'd have three queens other than Konan to fill somehow..."

Naruto,3cwroz,HokageEzio,17,Sat Jul 11 13:51:35 2015 UTC,gentle fists??? (too gross)!

Naruto,3cwroz,HokageEzio,9,Sat Jul 11 13:58:20 2015 UTC,it kinda sucks that nejiten never happened
Naruto,3cwroz,gruevee,14,Sat Jul 11 15:09:47 2015 UTC,I'm ambivalent either way. For me if it happened it'd be cool. If it didn't happen that'd also be cool. Tenten never was someone who expressed romantic interest in anyone during the series. Her chapter in Konoha Hiden really sells this notion too.  Heck the main thing she expressed passion for was her ninja tools. She was focussed more on becoming an excellent kunoichi and mastering her weapons as well as keeping Gai and Lee in check than seeking romance.

Naruto,3cwroz,HokageEzio,11,Sun Jul 12 04:39:27 2015 UTC,"I guess I wouldn't mind if Tenten is the mother, although I kind of liked the idea of characters dating outside their team. It always seemed to me that being on a team is going to develop a brother/sister relationship."
Naruto,3cwroz,hunterbelmont,6,Sat Jul 11 17:11:29 2015 UTC,Team 10 certainly dated outside their team.

Naruto,3cwroz,gruevee,4,Sat Jul 11 15:14:31 2015 UTC,taijutsu specialist + weapon specialist makes a pretty good combo actually
Naruto,3cwroz,naran6142,8,Sat Jul 11 18:57:39 2015 UTC,"I mean, it's possible, but I think if tenten was the mother, it would've been stated or shown by now so I really doubt it. But again, it's possible considering how much Kishi has ignored tenten over the years.  My guess is Lee married some random girl and Kishi just isn't going to draw her."
Naruto,3cwroz,Hanasuki,3,Sat Jul 11 15:47:03 2015 UTC,"I personally don't think metal lee looks as disgusting as his two predecessors, my biggest problem with guy and lee were their strange faces."
Naruto,3cwroz,Sak_,5,Sun Jul 12 14:18:28 2015 UTC,"Most likely. Its a trend in manga and anime for the casts to date/married each other.  Knowing that Lee married to Tenten gives more impact and give interesting pictures of their interactions than suddenly bring in some random woman to be Lee's wife.  Even Kiba is dating/marrying an already established character, the cat lady Tamaki.  http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/narutocouple/images/0/0f/324932864.PNG/revision/latest?cb=20141107122347"
Naruto,3cwroz,SilverStoneSlide,2,Sat Jul 11 16:03:39 2015 UTC,"This is a viable theory, but I think it would have been mentioned by Kishi in chapter 700 if Tenten were the mother. I just think that Lee married a random girl, who isn't worth mentioning, hence the abscence of Metal's mother."
Naruto,3cwroz,volt16,1 point,Sat Jul 11 13:37:23 2015 UTC,"Gai, Lee, and Kakashi didn't have mothers. Metal should be fine."

Naruto,3cw84s,Caliburn0,4,Sat Jul 11 12:12:01 2015 UTC,"It's title the False Origin of Shinobi, OP specifically wrote this as from the perspective of either the first origin story of the SO6P that the readers were told by Kishi, or what most people in the Naruto world who knew the history would have heard. I believe Madara is the only one to have the closest approximate knowledge of the actual truth"
Naruto,3cw84s,AbidingTruth,1 point,Sat Jul 11 19:08:27 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it was specifically ninshu which turned into ninjustu, ninshu being the connecting of one another together etc."

Naruto,3cw84s,Toxitheous,1 point,Sat Jul 11 20:42:32 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I just wanted to be more specific."
Naruto,3cw84s,Caliburn0,3,Sat Jul 11 20:58:20 2015 UTC,"An article similar to the History of the Tailed Beasts but technically not canon-compliant in this case.  Before we learned of the Otsutsuki and the God Tree, there was only the Sage of Six Paths and the Ten-Tails. You could think of this as the version of history mistakenly believed to be true up by those who knew of it until the Fourth Great Shinobi War.  Admittedly, I wrote this purely because I preferred the old canon history and wanted to put it all together. I may do a True Origin of Shinobi at some point."

Naruto,3cxtyw,night4345,10,Sat Jul 11 19:17:35 2015 UTC,I guess because it's literally making them a part of nature? They get closer by turning into animals and then go all the way by turning to stone.
Naruto,3cxtyw,knight504,3,Sat Jul 11 19:24:34 2015 UTC,They turn into frogs first.  Then they become even more natural and turn to stone.
Naruto,3cxtyw,HokageEzio,7,Sat Jul 11 19:26:21 2015 UTC,That is only if you train natural chakra with the toads. I imagine you would turn into a snake if you trained it with the snakes. Or just stone if you trained it outside a summoning contract.
Naruto,3cxtyw,Caliburn0,3,Sat Jul 11 19:45:26 2015 UTC,Because the author wrote it that way?

Killer Bee is considered a perfect Jinchuriki meaning he can access the 8 tails chakra at will, even transforming into the 8 tails himself.

Killer Bee has access to this ability at will also."

Naruto,3cxqi9,BrownDynamite923,14,Sat Jul 11 18:48:19 2015 UTC,Sub is better in my opinion.
Naruto,3cxqi9,badibatu,8,Sat Jul 11 20:49:52 2015 UTC,"I prefer english dubbed , but when those ran out I watched some subbed, but then I just read the manga till the end.   And btw naruto only says believe it untill like the chunin exams so yeah..."
Naruto,3cxqi9,Approximate_Knowledg,6,Sat Jul 11 21:54:42 2015 UTC,I've watched dub when I was a kid but when I re-watched the series I watched it in sub because that's what I prefer which includes all other animes (except for Dragonball and DBZ)
Naruto,3cxqi9,izn1337,12,Sat Jul 11 19:09:04 2015 UTC,"I grew up watching Naruto dubbed. It was also my first anime I ever watched. I watched ever single episode in dubbed up until I caught up with it and switched over to sub so I could continue watching (believe it was around Shippuden episode 220 or so). While I admit the sub is better, the dub just feels more nostalgic to me."
Naruto,3cxqi9,Yondemai,4,Sat Jul 11 18:56:15 2015 UTC,"Dubbed, like wise I grew up to it and I don't have time to learn another language. Can't stand listening to Japanese voices, and if I wanted to read I would pick up the manga and stop wasting my time."
Naruto,3cxqi9,Ninja20p,7,Sat Jul 11 21:39:29 2015 UTC,"Voice acting are decent in both. It's really up to you. Personally I watch in subs because they're way ahead of the dubs. So if you don't want to wait an eternity to finish the anime, i'd suggest you start with subs for the sake of continuity."
Naruto,3cxqi9,Neural_groove,4,Sat Jul 11 18:58:09 2015 UTC,"He won't say believe much longer, so your complaint will not apply for latter episodes. I would say dubbed. I have watched all the Naruto episodes in dubbed apart from the latest which I have watched subbed. I have to say, that besides Naruto every other dubbed voice is much better than in the subbed version. Gaara,Pain, Itachi and Sasuke have exceptional voice actors in the English dubbed version, unrivaled by the japanese ones. So you don't have to worry. Naruto is not like f.e One piece, which you have to watch Subbed, due to the Dubbed version sucking.  I also prefer dubbed because I can change tabs and browse 9gag or w/e during boring parts like recaps or flashbacks without missing out on the dialog.  It's ultimately your choice though."
Naruto,3cxqi9,volt16,5,Sat Jul 11 19:26:44 2015 UTC,The funimation dub of One piece is amazing for a dub.
Naruto,3cxqi9,CrazyBread92,1 point,Sat Jul 11 21:10:07 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the dub has been really done well. I just wish it was further along, but ya know... fucking 4kids."
Naruto,3cxqi9,Lucienofthelight,1 point,Sun Jul 12 01:11:31 2015 UTC,Agreed. Literally just finished watching the episode where Brook and the crew sung Bink's Brew/Sake and it was amazing. Especially Brook's little solo.
Naruto,3cxqi9,tht1guy52,2,Sun Jul 12 07:55:45 2015 UTC,Sub. Im from a country where we never dub anything other than children's movies. As a result I almost have to watch everything in their original language. The only exception I can think of is Dragon Ball Z.
Naruto,3cxqi9,Caliburn0,2,Sat Jul 11 19:48:58 2015 UTC,depends on how high i am
Naruto,3cxqi9,ticklek,2,Sun Jul 12 02:05:28 2015 UTC,"Sub, that's not even a question.  The Naruto dub is mediocre at best, the sub is 10x better."
Naruto,3cxqi9,scotbud123,2,Sun Jul 12 13:01:13 2015 UTC,I watched it sparingly dubbed as a kid and now I'm watching it all the way through subbed and I prefer it subbed a lot more. I feel like the inflections in the voice of the Japanese actors is a lot better. So even though I can't understand any of it and I'm reading a lot while also watching I feel like the show has a more serious feel to it.
Naruto,3cxqi9,Slowhand8824,1 point,Sat Jul 11 22:07:06 2015 UTC,yea especially in the naruto games. i played naruto shippuden ultimate ninja storm three in English and played it for half a year until i changed the voices to Japanese. and the game just felt more serious.
Naruto,3cxqi9,hokagenaruto,2,Sun Jul 12 00:43:33 2015 UTC,Sub all the way!
Naruto,3cxqi9,petru1745,2,Sun Jul 12 01:19:06 2015 UTC,"Naruto is one of the series where i think the dub is really well done. Many of the voices really match their character, especially Gaara, Shikamaru, Sasuke and Kakashi imo.   Ironically enough the only voice that i didnt like was Naruto, the one he had during the Pain arc."
Naruto,3cxqi9,TheKingEli,1 point,Sat Jul 11 19:26:47 2015 UTC,I watch the original Naruto in dubbed and then transition to subbed in Shippuden.
Naruto,3cxqi9,ShawnJackson827,1 point,Sat Jul 11 21:50:41 2015 UTC,"Subbed, the EVAs sound to similar to me"
Naruto,3cxqi9,Spartn90,1 point,Sat Jul 11 23:32:09 2015 UTC,actually both are really good. i grew up watching dub but then you know dub ran out of episodes so i then switched to sub to continue. as soon as i switched i noticed that the voices are kinda the same(for me). they just sound the same. i prefer sub for the show but honestly there isn't that much of a difference. the dub is basically (too me) the same actors just in English. the only character who sounds different than he does in sub is shino.
Naruto,3cxqi9,hokagenaruto,1 point,Sun Jul 12 00:39:41 2015 UTC,"Sub. The breaking point for me? Deidara calling Sasori ""Sasori My Man"" in the dubbed. I JUST. CAN'T. STAND. IT.  Why couldn't they just translate it to Master Sasori and be done with it... T.T"
Naruto,3cxqi9,NeonDragon123,3,Sun Jul 12 00:29:36 2015 UTC,That's my favorite part of the dub.
Naruto,3cxqi9,hessdawg3113,0,Sun Jul 12 02:18:04 2015 UTC,.....shudder
Naruto,3cxqi9,NeonDragon123,0,Sun Jul 12 03:59:20 2015 UTC,Not just Naruto but everything should be watched in its original language i think. Subbed for me
Naruto,3cxqi9,kckttk,-2,Sat Jul 11 23:01:22 2015 UTC,NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO  FOR THE LOVE OF GOD STOP ASKING THIS QUESTION HOLY SHIT  We already know there are people that get horny listening to the sub voices and vice versa with the dub voices then there are people like me who don't give a fuck and just want to watch the show they enjoy without all the annoying people screaming about how the sub or dub is better.  So please can we stop asking this because it always sparks a huge argument.
Naruto,3cxqi9,aldothetroll,1 point,Sat Jul 11 19:00:30 2015 UTC,"Why are people downvoting this? This is the damn truth. The only reason I prefer watching Sub is because its ahead. Otherwise, I want to listen in a language I can understand, without 'reading the show.'  I dont understand how people say the dub is emotionless. I can feel emotion in it, I dont see the difference. Naruto just doesn't sound like a prepubescent transvestite and I understand what he's saying."

Naruto,3cs57f,izn1337,11,Fri Jul 10 12:00:30 2015 UTC,Because Gai has always had God Ki/Chakra use. He just didn't want to pull it out till he met a fellow god.

Naruto,3cs57f,kannoneer,28,Fri Jul 10 14:16:51 2015 UTC,Yeah. Kishimoto's art looks a lot better.
Naruto,3cs57f,dynrte,6,Fri Jul 10 14:48:38 2015 UTC,plus his art is alot more detailed
Naruto,3cs57f,hokagenaruto,7,Fri Jul 10 17:00:11 2015 UTC,Do you even know the difference between a still shot and animation?
Naruto,3cs57f,jaxspider,2,Sat Jul 11 01:35:55 2015 UTC,me?
Naruto,3cs57f,hokagenaruto,2,Sat Jul 11 01:36:56 2015 UTC,"Of course, still art would be much more detailed than animation. But, at least compared to other anime I've seen, Naruto's animation seems very simple, especially compared to the source material."

Naruto,3cs57f,MissplacedLandmine,7,Fri Jul 10 21:48:29 2015 UTC,Guy is the next Super Saiyan God apparently.
Naruto,3cs57f,Mitaro_Soul,7,Fri Jul 10 18:16:24 2015 UTC,"I agree, the red flames should be laid out on top of Gai to created the burning vapor effect, not behind him like a Super Saiyan's aura. The hair is the most egregious."
Naruto,3cs57f,FlotsamsJetsam,6,Fri Jul 10 18:08:54 2015 UTC,"For me, it's the hair and the eyebrows that kinda kills it, I mean it should look like blood mist that is on fire and chakra, not like a woblly Dragonfruit hat and red cloth eyebrows."
Naruto,3cs57f,kannoneer,18,Fri Jul 10 18:40:08 2015 UTC,"IMO, this just shows how much more superior the manga looks to the anime. The manga shows it as if they are actual red flames coming out of his hair which looks so much better than how the anime did it. I don't know why they would make the art of 8th Gate look so amazing in the intro but in the actual anime it looks nothing like that. Such a missed opportunity."
Naruto,3cs57f,Mehmedx,4,Fri Jul 10 21:26:56 2015 UTC,God I hate the art the anime puts out. It looks nothing like what Kishi drew.
Naruto,3cs57f,aka_biscuits,10,Sat Jul 11 01:12:57 2015 UTC,He's supposed to be on fire...
Naruto,3cs57f,Timmies_addict,15,Fri Jul 10 17:00:03 2015 UTC,"and the smoke all around them was supposed to be the red vapor of his blood coming up from his burning body, not just red vapor around his spiky red hair...."
Naruto,3cs57f,spaghettidrk,2,Fri Jul 10 18:42:27 2015 UTC,"How much does a person stay alive while using the 8 gates? I mean if your body is burning like that, I doubt someone could stand more than a minute."
Naruto,3cs57f,Khaijit,4,Sat Jul 11 01:41:36 2015 UTC,Its very quick from what I remember (the fight)
Naruto,3cs57f,TeddyR3X,7,Sat Jul 11 02:23:15 2015 UTC,Don't forget that Guy is also bending space-time in this state.  He is literally the fastest human on Earth when the 8th gate is opened without taking interdimensional travel into consideration.  A minute in that state is more than enough time to wreak an appropriate amount of havoc.

Naruto,3cs57f,TeddyR3X,2,Sat Jul 11 04:17:30 2015 UTC,"Probably only minutes considering it's meant to kill you. I believe the gate of death pumps your heart at a rediculous rate which is basically overclocking guy. Once it's done he will burn up from consuming so much chakra and his heart will explode. The technique is used as a forbidden technique because of such, and the fact guy has a ""self made rule"" behind it that made him wait so long his will to survive is probably extremely high."
Naruto,3cs57f,spaghettidrk,5,Sat Jul 11 03:46:41 2015 UTC,It's definitely not as exciting as the manga.
Naruto,3cs57f,Raykushi,7,Fri Jul 10 20:12:50 2015 UTC,So I'm a bit behind. Why does guy look like Akuma?

Naruto,3cs57f,nudemonkey,4,Sat Jul 11 05:20:34 2015 UTC,"Y'all talking about how much detail is lacking in this, are y'all expecting some Ufotable UBW or F/Z levels of animation and detail?"
Naruto,3cs57f,Rebel908,12,Fri Jul 10 20:44:26 2015 UTC,"Maybe not but when this anime have proved they are capable of high standards like obito 'im in hell', madara vs shinobi alliance and most recently kakashi vs obito - you come to expect and demand better for one of the most anticipated moments of the series. Especially since the story is nearing its conclusion anyway with not many of these moments left."
Naruto,3cs57f,bhvgcf,3,Fri Jul 10 21:29:37 2015 UTC,well other anime have better animation. plus naruto is really popular so people would expect since the show is popular that it'd have better animation

It's like Beeruto just used Kage Beeshin no jutsu up in here, that's how many bees there are. Which are a lot. So that's cool.

Do you guys submit the assignments at the last possible second even though you know it isn't perfect? That's exactly what a lot of animators do, they halfass the work because it's too stressful."
Naruto,3cszkh,Neural_groove,7,Fri Jul 10 17:02:38 2015 UTC,"It's just something that all the people who chew them out should take into consideration really.  They have this super stressful line of work and all it gets is people complaining.  They actually get injured doing it.  And the reason they would hold out the filler is because A) money for the Studio which leads to B) the minimal amounts of money for the animator (aka, they need the fucking job...)  They aren't some art school rejects or some people who don't care about the story, they're just people trying to make ends meet."
Naruto,3cszkh,SilverStoneSlide,2,Fri Jul 10 17:18:57 2015 UTC,"People shouldn't blame the animators.  They're the ones simply taking orders, working under awful conditions and getting paid horribly.    I do blame the Studio management though or whoever calls the shots.  If they went to a 24 episode then half year break format I think you'd see a drastic improvement in not only animation quality but also content."

Naruto,3cszkh,YonkouProductions,4,Fri Jul 10 17:22:01 2015 UTC,"Not only does there need to be liscensing. People compete over liscenses, all the time. Let's say Studio Pierrot wants it. What if Funimation wants it? What if Funimation gives Shueisha an offer that they can't refuse. A bidding war will start. Especially over something as popular as Naruto. In fact, they might be going on right now.   Isn't Funimation work as distributor in US, while Pierrot is animator studio in Japan. They are not the same in the job. Can't Pierrot make the hidden anime in Japan, to be distributed by Funimation in US?  Also, I disagree the fans should just accept shitty product from the studio because the studio find out it's hard to continue animating their anime.   The studio themselves should find solutions for these problem, the studio in US can do it with their CG movie so why can't the Japanese? Especially when Naruto is worldwide popular product, the income should be steadily coming in. Pierrot should have some sort of royalty for each episode broadcasted and for each dvd/BD sold in all over the world.  Also, say if some other anime studio manage to secure the novel's license - and make anime for it because that's why you get animating license for - like in format of movies or OVAs, I think the fans will be fine with it too.  The main concern is actually for the hidden novels to be animated, doesn't matter by who -- for the Pierrot possible filler we can just not watching it."
Naruto,3cszkh,Neural_groove,-1,Fri Jul 10 20:31:02 2015 UTC,"I just said a random thing that came to mind.  And from what the articles said, it's not as simple as it is in America.  Japan doesn't have many choices in anime style animators, while America has a ton for CG animation.  Kinda hard to find people to make the show when there's nobody to find.  The anime studio is on a decline, and it probably has been ever since Toonami first went off the air, or even slightly before."
Naruto,3cszkh,Yosonimbored,1 point,Fri Jul 10 20:36:12 2015 UTC,"I thought so..  I've read the article you've mentioned, and it seems the problem in general is the animating studios lacks animators, plus the lower cost of outsourcing contributing to even lesser amount of animator.  Which lead to overworking the remaining animator, further increasing the decline in numbers of animator.  I think improving the working condition and reasonable wages will attract back people who are interested in animating.. Anime BD in Japan also insanely expensive, these studios need to reduce their pricing so more fans all over the world can buy their product."
Naruto,3cszkh,SMlLE,1 point,Fri Jul 10 20:48:09 2015 UTC,"Which is apparently what they're working on, cause the anime district is to them what the movie district is to us.  Pretty important.  I know for sure manga is important to the entire culture because of how overworked Japanese people are in general.  That's why they have so much manga of so many different genres, it's like their out with all the school work and work work.  If that Union stuff pulls through, which I'll probably end up looking around for news of, it would be good for fans, and most importantly, good for the workers."

Naruto,3cszkh,walta_,3,Fri Jul 10 22:12:39 2015 UTC,"I don't even think you understood the articles that you read.    Not only does there need to be liscensing. People compete over liscenses, all the time. Let's say Studio Pierrot wants it. What if Funimation wants it?   I guarantee that Naruto's entire series full rights will be in the hands of Studio Pierrot for as long as production of the series continues. You think that studios like Toei or Studio Pierrot are going to have to fight smaller studios for production rights to something like DBZ and Naruto?  Both Studio Pierrot and Toei are huge in the respective industry of anime and buying out the production rights and half-assing the actual show obviously makes them more money. It already takes a ton of cash for the production rights so why waste more money on the animation costs when they've invested into such a popular manga which they know will draw a huge audience regardless.   So the honest truth is, asking for Studio Pierrot to stop the fillers and make a Hiden or Gaiden (assuming Gaiden counts as it's own entity and therefore requires it's own liscene) anime, means nothing.    Gaiden would in no way requires a ""license"". SP, 99.9%, will have the production rights to the spin-off mini-series and if Kishimoto were to write more Naruto in the near future or even far future then SP will still have the rights to them.   The people who would require ""licenses"" for Gaiden are distribution+dubbing companies like Funimation, or Viz Media. These companies need to buy the license to the Japanese product Gaiden produced by Studio Pierrot to sell the refined product whether it be a dubbed version of the show or translated version of the manga to the respective target audiences.    It's not their decision. I can bet that they are begging for it right now. Hell, the head of Studio Pierrot is probably willing to suck so many dicks over at Shueisha just to get a hold of those rights.   It is 100% the decision of SP to animate within the boundaries of the contracts between publisher and studio. SP undoubtedly has the production rights to the entire series and everything that will continue in the series because no studio other than Toei has the same buyout power. Not to mention these contracts are done in intervals that span years which aren't publicized, but it's silly to think that just because Kishi wrote more content recently that it wouldn't already be owned by SP.   tl;dr: Licenses have nothing to do with why SP is doing a shitty job with Naruto. Thinking that Studio Pierrot doesn't already have the production rights to everything Naruto from here on out is plain dumb."

Naruto,3cvy6m,Ootsutsuki,1 point,Sat Jul 11 06:03:36 2015 UTC,I don't understand what you're saying.
Naruto,3cvy6m,Thr0s,4,Sat Jul 11 07:22:38 2015 UTC,he said that because they talk shit someone probably killed them for talking shit
Naruto,3cvy6m,HokageEzio,4,Sat Jul 11 14:55:30 2015 UTC,"The parents were scared of Naruto because they saw what the 9 tails did to their homes and friends.  The kids were jerks just cause the parents taught them not to mess with that kid.  They didn't know why.  Guy was made fun of because he was a scrub, that's what kids do.  They were like, 6 when they met him.  Same for Duy, except he never got stronger as far as they were aware, so they just tagged him eternal genin."
Naruto,3cvy6m,Leftydoesitright,0,Sat Jul 11 05:57:28 2015 UTC,I think he means why is it that only the no names treated  naruto/guy that way and not any one known. For example why dint the parents of Shikamaru talk down about naruto
Naruto,3cvy6m,HokageEzio,3,Sat Jul 11 07:14:04 2015 UTC,"Cause nobody else really cared as much, especially ninja.  There are degrees to disliking somebody.  Named ninja have seen far worse things, they've fought wars.  They aren't going to be troubled with harassing Naruto.  But a random civilian isn't built for that.  They are scared.  They can't fight."
Naruto,3cvy6m,Leftydoesitright,0,Sat Jul 11 07:57:24 2015 UTC,"I think kishi Just didn't  want any of the known good characters to be seen as assholes, if any of the Konoha 11 were being jerks to naruto as kids it just wouldn't feel right."
Naruto,3cvy6m,HokageEzio,6,Sat Jul 11 08:13:38 2015 UTC,"Neji beat the shit out of his own cousin and was about ready to kill her.  Pretty jerky way to create a character...    He explained exactly why the kids felt the way they felt, they didn't want to put Naruto in the hospital.  They didn't want him dead.  They were just annoyed by him.  Because he was annoying.  The adults were the only ones who feared him.  This is an established thing..."
Naruto,3cvy6m,HokageEzio,-1,Sat Jul 11 08:34:58 2015 UTC,"So why not make some of the named characters treat him the same way? If anything Iruka should of been the worst to him, but he was actually a good teacher to a troublesome child.  Also you forgot the moment when two adult shinobi beat up child Guy. He has no tailed-beast in him, he's no threat. And yet they managed to put him into the hospital. Maybe he would have ended up dead if it weren't for Kakashi."
Naruto,3cvy6m,HokageEzio,4,Sat Jul 11 07:18:01 2015 UTC,"Hiruzen hit Iruka with the feels trip by saying he used to be the exact same way for the exact same reason, that's why Iruka cared so much.  None of the other students knew why they were angry at him, they were just angry at him because it's what they were taught.  And then on top of that he was annoying, which actually gives them reason.  The two adults were basically A) being assholes (they weren't going to kill him, they were just roughing him up for throwing the rock) and B) this isn't our world, two older guys punching an Academy age kid means nothing.  Kids his age go out and get killed by even older people."
Naruto,3cvlr1,Crowzur,2,Sat Jul 11 03:37:53 2015 UTC,"Pretty sure it is a collector's edition (called True Despair Edition) that came with several stuff, and the game had a different case. It seems like they're selling the case by itself without the bonus content since someone traded it in and it's the same game so no difference"

Naruto,3cv33a,DommoUk,19,Sat Jul 11 00:44:02 2015 UTC,Madara vs Allied Shinobi forces for sure. That whole episode had amazing animation which really stood out. Madara does the sharingan scanning in that fight aswell and IMO it looks much better than Sasuke ever did it.
Naruto,3cv33a,Mehmedx,11,Sat Jul 11 01:49:28 2015 UTC,"One of my favorites has to be when Obito and Kakashi are fighting in the kamui dimension, and the way kakashi hit the kunai with the back of his shoe to cut obitos cheek.  I literally yelled ""oh shit!""   That, and when Lee and Gaara fought in the chunin exams, the way gaara was looking for Lee and his kicks suddenly showing up. That was really awesome."
Naruto,3cv33a,ValleyofVino,6,Sat Jul 11 01:37:58 2015 UTC,The moment when Obito uses kakashi's hand to form the fireball jutsu. That's when I went holy shit
Naruto,3cv33a,Coinkidinks,7,Sat Jul 11 06:05:56 2015 UTC,"""My pain is greater than yours!""    Also, Sasuke vs. Killer Bee. Bee's sword style translates a lot better to animation than to still images. I think that the movement really accentuates Bee's unique blend of speed, power, and unpredictability, whereas the manga is limited to depicting ""stopped motion"" and circles to indicate that he is spinning."
Naruto,3cv33a,Doc_o_Clock,6,Sat Jul 11 02:19:57 2015 UTC,Kurenai gets the sad news. Konan looks at the sky while dying. Shikamaru plays Shogi with his father.  I absolutely loved how those scenes were animated.
Naruto,3cv33a,volt16,5,Sat Jul 11 06:30:24 2015 UTC,Pain vs Naruto or obito and Kakashi

Naruto,3cv33a,King_Riku_,2,Sat Jul 11 04:28:14 2015 UTC,the whole chikara filler arc was amazingly animated. Jirayia vs Pain The whole Pain invasion arc Kakashi vs Obito Minato vs Obito 16 years ago Sasuke vs Deidara Madara vs Shinobi Alliance  literally every big fight in Shipūden as far as I can remember right now _^
Naruto,3cv33a,Drikani,2,Sat Jul 11 10:07:22 2015 UTC,kakashi vs obito sasuke vs bee kakashi vs hidan and kakuzu  sasuke vs deidaras clay soldiers was awesome during the fight madara vs the alliance

Naruto,3cv33a,4Khazmodan,1 point,Sat Jul 11 15:34:16 2015 UTC,Pain fight. Just 11/10 top notch fight. Best animation and art I've seen. Saidnooneever
Naruto,3cv33a,ArosHD,1 point,Sat Jul 11 03:33:12 2015 UTC,Well I thought its pain vs naruto animation captured the speed of their movements well. Especially the early stages of the fight.  But dear god anything is better than the garbage that is currently being shoved down our throats
Naruto,3crmnu,xFluffDawg,55,Fri Jul 10 05:32:51 2015 UTC,"This is funny, but apparently they don't actually say the jutsu name before they cast it, they say it in their heads for the benefit of the reader. So Kisame didn't say ""water prison jutsu""."

Naruto,3cw1ez,goegen27,1 point,Sat Jul 11 06:31:55 2015 UTC,Yes it's a genjutsu but also technically that movie isn't cannon so....
Naruto,3cw1ez,walta_,3,Sat Jul 11 06:47:00 2015 UTC,"Yeah it was made before the specifics of tsukiyomi was explained so it's pretty much isn't like real tsukiyomi at all. In the movie they definitely go to a different dimension since the alternate sakura ends up in the real konoha and the real naruto and sakura are nowhere to be found, otherwise someone would have just found them unconscious in the park."
Naruto,3cw1ez,Omega_Warrior,1 point,Sat Jul 11 06:51:36 2015 UTC,Correct me if I'm wrong but I believe that in the movie both Naruto and Sakura are not so much unconscious in a park but they were actually transported into that orb that obito was carrying.
Naruto,3cw1ez,walta_,1 point,Sat Jul 11 07:18:02 2015 UTC,"It's supposed to be a genjutsu similar to the tsukiyomi, but it's a non-canon movie so they could do Naruto meets Freaky Friday. I wouldn't say they were very concerned the lore-friendly reasoning behind it."
Naruto,3cwfbg,digitalXmage,7,Sat Jul 11 10:14:29 2015 UTC,Minato's a lot faster. He's reacted to the Raikage at his top speed and KCM Naruto was constantly compared to Minato in terms of reaction speed. He outran an explosion while protecting a newborn Naruto and his teleportation is actually instantaneous. Shisui is just really good at the regular body flicker.
Naruto,3cwfbg,WhereIsMyManatee,5,Sat Jul 11 12:13:55 2015 UTC,"Shisui uses the Body Flicker which is just fast movement, whereas the Hiraishin is instantaneous movement. Minato is faster, completely NO contest."

Naruto,3cwfbg,Lord4th,3,Sat Jul 11 16:05:56 2015 UTC,Shisui has no feats.
Naruto,3cwfbg,Neural_groove,-2,Sat Jul 11 13:09:05 2015 UTC,"It's the same jutsu so I would assume it's the same speed. Minato's just works with kunai as well, so I suppose it's more versatile."
Naruto,3cwfbg,night4345,8,Sat Jul 11 12:06:04 2015 UTC,"No, it's not. Everyone can use the Body Flicker which is just fast movement using Chakra. Flying Thunder God is actual teleportation."
Naruto,3cwfbg,Neural_groove,2,Sat Jul 11 12:34:46 2015 UTC,Oh okay I see. So then minato is definitely faster.   myfault

Could someone explain what might be some cultural factors which explain the discrepancy in how the west and the east views the characters differently?   Diedara and Sasori won't even make my top 50.
Naruto,3csjtt,night4345,4,Fri Jul 10 18:30:17 2015 UTC,"Well I know Deidara and Sasori are pretty popular even in the west.  But apparently from looking it up, he's popular because of Kakashi x Iruka yaoi fangirls... apparently tumblr fangirls isn't just a western thing.  But to answer the cultural thing, there are just some things that are culturally lost on us that aren't lost on Japanese people.  There are some things they might see that we see differently.  It's just a matter of how they are raised and what they value being different.  So another reason for him being liked could be the high regard they hold for Senseis in general (though there's no way that alone put him in the top 10)."
Naruto,3csjtt,FailerQt,1 point,Fri Jul 10 18:40:41 2015 UTC,"I see.. I guess I just don't villains enough.  But yea I am just curious on what kind of cultural differences will cause this. I know Japanese culture is very different from Western culture, but I just need someone to tell me how can characters like Jiraiya, Killer B, Rock lee, Might Guy be so far below.   Maybe Japanese people prefer characters who do not make fools of themselves? Because nobody except Naruto in top 10 is clumsy or dorky."

Kakashi vs Obito - No meteors ,unextinguishable flames, 500 meter susanoos just taijutsu bad ass as fuck taijutsu .  These are my favourites even thou there are more like Minato vs Tobi"
Naruto,3cvey9,BlackMacGyver,3,Sat Jul 11 02:32:31 2015 UTC,"I think we should ignore part one here. We've seen tons of variance in the power of a Kage - from, say, Mei to Hashirama. So there's no way to definitively set a benchmark for the power of a Kage. So in that case, just believe Part 2 when it sys it increases his power ×100"

As you saw the five kage couldn't even hurt regular madara. Here you have guy completely owning six paths madara with rinnegan and truth seeking balls. Someone who has the power of a God literally almost got kicked in half by guy. He is clearly far above anyone we've seen. I feel that even if he faced hashirama his talent for taijutsu is on such a level that he could beat most anyone, simply for the reason that his speed and power are on a level most people aren't ready for."
Naruto,3cvey9,RaspberryPoptarts,1 point,Sat Jul 11 20:04:03 2015 UTC,Umm what. First you said that the distance between guy and a current Kage is enormous. Then you said his taijutsu could beat almost anyone. I need an adult.
Naruto,3ctg9f,HokageEzio,14,Fri Jul 10 17:12:46 2015 UTC,"How do you know they were passed down to the next owner? It could be that multiple swordsmen died fighting Dai and the survivors retrieved their swords to bring back to Kiri. At this point in time, the Seven Swordsmen were still an active group loyal to Kiri, and we know that Mangetsu was the only swordsmen able to wield all 7 swords, so none of them have any incentive to keep the swords for themselves. It's entirely possible they brought them back to Kiri and they, Yagura, or whoever, distributed them to who they saw fit to be a new member of the swordsmen"
Naruto,3ctg9f,AbidingTruth,4,Fri Jul 10 17:18:43 2015 UTC,"I did say I think, not I know.  There's no way to know, just an educated guess.  If we base it off of the story of Zabuza, they go through a sort of Academy before they go on to be Swordsmen.  Kisame is the only one who stole it, which was his act of going rouge.  Which would lead one to believe that the proper way is earning it.  It just wouldn't make sense if some people went on and graduated to earn the sword, yet some others didn't."
Naruto,3ctg9f,Ultrahuntr,8,Fri Jul 10 17:30:11 2015 UTC,"That said, I think it not being ""much of a fight"" is still a potential understatement. By your story he killed 2, while fighting all of them at once. Did you see how vicious they were when reanimated? Yet 1 genin (Duy) fought all of them, and (by your count) managed to take down two by himself, as well as making sure none of them split off to go chase down Guy. If you ask me, that fight would have been pretty damn badass."
Naruto,3ctg9f,-Ryu-,3,Fri Jul 10 17:36:33 2015 UTC,"It makes him a badass, I'm not denying that.  And I'm not trying to say he didn't put in work, he would have had to.  It's impossible not to in 8th gate.  All I'm trying to state is that he didn't solo them or anything like some believe, or at least my speculation says otherwise."
Naruto,3ctg9f,AbidingTruth,2,Fri Jul 10 17:44:14 2015 UTC,why are you so jealous of his youth bruh? seriously.
Naruto,3ctg9f,night4345,3,Sat Jul 11 02:21:49 2015 UTC,"The academy is just like Konoha's, it was for becoming a shinobi in general. Besides, in Zabuza's story, he was never part of the academy. He just showed up one day and killed the entire class. It's definitely possible that there are multiple ways of becoming a swordsmen, like becoming an apprentice and having it passed down or becoming an apprentice (optional) and stealing it like Kisame. It could be possible then, that the swordsmen already had apprentices back at Kiri that took up the swords when several of them died fighting Dai, or if they didn't, they could have selected shinobi to take their place. In any case, there definitely has to be a back up plan for who receives the sword if the wielder should die in battle, the Seven Swordsmen are very valuable to the military force of Kiri"
Naruto,3ctg9f,xgenoriginal,-1,Fri Jul 10 17:44:41 2015 UTC,"Well when you're in the Academy, nobody is technically a ninja.  You aren't one until you graduate.  But fair enough, I could just be reading that wrong."

We know Guy is way better at the gates than his father probably ever was.  I think even Duy knew he wasn't gonna beat them, that's why he said ""I'll be the distraction"", not ""I'll beat these guys here""."

The first 20 some episodes are great but as Studio Peirot realized how fast it was burning through the source material, they waaaayyy dialed back the content speed.  Repeated flashbacks, cuts to explanations and way they to max out the chapter to episode ratio really ruined the pacing.  If Studio Peirot ever pulls a Dragonball Kai and cleans up that stuff, I'd definitely watch the series.    Naruto as it stands?  I'd recommend against it."

Naruto,3cucg2,Wraxu,2,Fri Jul 10 22:37:23 2015 UTC,"The whole point of them mastering the gates is because they're only capable of taijutsu. Unless I'm missing something, the huge boost in power is energy not chakra, which is why Samehada wasn't able to absorb 7th gate guy's techniques. So what would having a huge chakra pool have to do with opening the gates."
Naruto,3cucg2,walta_,3,Fri Jul 10 22:43:55 2015 UTC,"Well the 8 inner gates IS about chakra but its usage has more to do with the physical strength of the user.   After all, even the name refers to the 8 chakra limiters inside the body. But it has more to do with having the strength to do taijutsu without your chakra being limited when enhancing the user."
Naruto,3cucg2,shawnyboy07,2,Sat Jul 11 01:16:19 2015 UTC,"I agree with wraxu, the only thing a huge chakra pool might do for you is give you a last ditch effort of ninjutsu if the gates don't work......"
Naruto,3cucg2,Spartn90,2,Fri Jul 10 22:45:24 2015 UTC,"I must be confused at what you're saying, the gates opening increase speed and power, a huge chakra pool has nothing to do with that aspect, so how would having a huge chakra pool make the gates useless?  I want to agree with you, so maybe I'm misunderstanding"
Naruto,3cucg2,Wraxu,2,Sat Jul 11 01:16:07 2015 UTC,"I didn't say it would make the gates useless, what I'm saying is opening gates are for people who train and push their bodies beyond on the limits. It's for people who are strictly taijutsu, so why would someone with a huge chakra pool spend so much time and effort attempting to learn something so incredibly difficult when they could learn and refine ninjutsu? That's why the only ninja we've seen so far use the gates are the ones who aren't capable of utilizing their chakra."
Naruto,3cucg2,Spartn90,1 point,Sat Jul 11 01:46:47 2015 UTC,"Gotcha, I think the post was saying even if they still strictly used taijutsu with a huge chakra pool.  They still have chakra, they just can't mold it to use ninjutsu, if they could mold it like others then I see your point.  The gates are what you unlock to flow more chakra to your points beyond your bodies normal limiters, so more chakra I'm assuming would A. Make them even more fast/powerful, or B. Give them more time in the forms"
Naruto,3cucg2,The_Hippopotamoose,1 point,Sat Jul 11 02:02:58 2015 UTC,The 8 inner gates deals with chakra contained within the body. It allows chakra to flow through the body without limit. But no chakra is being expelled from the body. It's all inside. Which is why samehada couldn't devour gai's chakra. The hirudora is just shaped wind from a sonic punch

Naruto,3cqz3e,Btg42796,4,Fri Jul 10 02:25:47 2015 UTC,What would you mean by fillers?
Naruto,3cqz3e,Slysnake150,5,Fri Jul 10 03:40:00 2015 UTC,"By ""fillers"" we mean content that is not originally in the manga. Not all fillers are bad, but they are usually much lower quality and generally hold no relation to the actual plot.  An example of bad filler is the nearly 100 episodes of straight filler that follow the last ""true"" arc of the first anime. The Shippudden anime has lots of filler too, but the plots are for the most part more relevant and they are less intrusive to the real story."

Naruto,3cri50,vladthetransilvanian,8,Fri Jul 10 04:45:23 2015 UTC,The only one I agree with is the power one.. granted I only skimmed the discriptions. Two other arcs I would recommend are; Part 1: Gaara meeting Matsuri  Part 2: Kakashi's anbu days
Naruto,3cri50,Itachi4ever,2,Fri Jul 10 05:34:42 2015 UTC,"I really like the filler in which Gaara meets Matsuri as well. I wrote a huge comment about it 3 weeks ago. Not many people even know that she exists, but I find it really cool how she was created a filler character in Part 1 and how she still makes several appearances in part 2 (Gaara Retrieval arc, 5 Kage Summit, Blood Prison movie, Shinobi War, ending #22, and the most recent chunin exam filler arc).  I hope that she wasn't killed off during Madara's meteorite attack. It would be really cool if they make a part 3 and they show that she ended up with Gaara."
Naruto,3cri50,AwesomeDattebayo,2,Thu Jul 16 00:16:08 2015 UTC,"Meh. Other than the Power Arc, I don't like the list.  The one filler arc that should be on the list if any is the Kakashi Shadow of the ANBU Black Ops arc. I thought it gave the viewers a very good understanding of Kakashi's character and the tough life he had. That speech he gave Sasuke in part 1, I know understand what he meant when he said he was not a lucky pesron.   This arc also showed us a side of the Uchiha clan massacre that we didn't get to see before. Seeing 11 year old Itachi in ANBU was pretty cool. We finally got to see a little bit of Shisui in this arc. The guy was able to cast genjutsu on someone from 2 miles away. Just the sight of him made his enemies retreat. Seeing Itachi witnessing Shisui's suicide and awaken the mangekyo and seeing Itachi make Danzo shit in his pants were also some cool moments.   Danzo's presence in this arc made it that much more interesting. When it comes to instilling emotions of anger into the fanbase, the is no character better at it than Danzo. From him ordering an assassination of the Third hokage, to him stealing Shisui's eye, his presence just made the arc so much more interesting."
Naruto,3cri50,jl1995,2,Fri Jul 10 12:55:54 2015 UTC,"I would also recommend Kakashi ANBU ark and and the Hinata/Hanabi ""The Last "" special as I have never seen it recommended even thou its pretty good and gives Hinata more time to develop as a character ."

Naruto,3cnwk3,HighFiveMinato,32,Thu Jul 9 15:26:49 2015 UTC,Because some people just want to watch the world burn HighFiveMinato .. u_u  Lol but also seeing Mighty Dad go 8 gates of death would take away the shock of seeing Guy doing against Madara I guess.

Naruto,3cnwk3,Legovil,47,Thu Jul 9 20:27:33 2015 UTC,"Dude he really is. This manga is full of absent fathers and here is Might Dai doing bottom rank missions to support his son all the while being as compassionate and supportive as one could possibly be. And he does it ecstatically. He works during the day, trains his son in the evening, and trains himself in the night so he can pass on his family legacy ability. He fills his son with hope while validating his fears and giving him reasonable advice to help him through it. To top it off he literally gives his life for Guy. We also know how great of a person Guy is and he's passing on the will and amazing mentoring learned from his father to Rock Lee. As far as father figures go, Asuma, Sarutobi and Iruka are all pretty good but Dai just blows them out of the water."
Naruto,3cnwk3,F_i_z_z,15,Thu Jul 9 21:24:41 2015 UTC,"Don't forget that now Lee is passing on his legacy to Metal Lee ! Dai began this youth (I like to believe he did anyway) and it is being passed on through GENERATIONNSSSSS. He also didn't get mad when Gai questioned him, and just explained himself. I like Might Dai. Can we have a Might Dai flair pls? /u/jaxspider"
Naruto,3cnwk3,Legovil,5,Thu Jul 9 23:54:44 2015 UTC,"This quote confuses me when Kakashi says that Guy's dad is the coolest dad. Why? Because Kakashi's did the exact thing, yet Kakashi despises him for it. Given the time when this would have happened in the timeline (he has both of his eyes), it would be prior to Kakashi finding his love for his comrades."
Naruto,3cnwk3,Ryuzakku,4,Sat Jul 11 00:54:43 2015 UTC,"He's being supportive of a friend. Even so, he hated his dad for other reasons. His dad couldn't live up to his legend and failed a critical objective to protect companions. Might Dai is has nin if that bagage to kakashi. Might Dai must remind him of all the positives of his dad."
Naruto,3cnwk3,kingmanic,2,Sat Jul 11 01:11:15 2015 UTC,"His dad saved his comrades and failed a mission, and Dai says it's okay to fail so long as you protect what's important to you, which is exactly what Kakashi's dad did.  Although that led to his dad killing himself due to ridicule from everyone for failing the mission. But I guess that's why Kakashi's hates his dad."
Naruto,3cnwk3,Ryuzakku,45,Sat Jul 11 01:33:05 2015 UTC,Man...that fight against the seven swordsmen would be an awesome one to animate. Too bad we didn't see Might Dai at least go eight gates if not the full fight.
Naruto,3cnwk3,Icewavez,85,Thu Jul 9 11:41:06 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I think that would take away from Guy Sensei's big moment.  This isn't about his father, this is him vs the most powerful being on Earth.  He shouldn't be showed up by the past.  Both manga and anime wise.  Just my opinion."
Naruto,3cnwk3,HokageEzio,19,Thu Jul 9 11:47:00 2015 UTC,"I whole-heartedly agree. It would be AWESOME to see the fight with the Seven Swordsmen but It would take away from Gai's battle. I really, really hope beyond all hope that they get the same guy that animated the Madara v. Five Armies and Kakashi v. Obito fight to animate this fight. I will be sorely disappointed if they don't."
Naruto,3cnwk3,partyatwalmart,8,Thu Jul 9 11:56:33 2015 UTC,"Well, not to get your hopes up, but he's directing Boruto: The Movie, so there is absolutely no chance of him animating this fight. On the bright side: Boruto: The Movie should have incredible animation!"

Naruto,3cnwk3,narx33,10,Fri Jul 10 14:39:51 2015 UTC,"3 were replaced. The theory is dai a genin took down 3 by himself, before getting rekt. But yeah he didn't die because he used the 8 gates he died because they handed his ass to him on a plate of youth. 😐"
Naruto,3cnwk3,ImAnAppleBiteMe,6,Thu Jul 9 15:31:15 2015 UTC,"If SOSP Madara was struggling against 8 Gates Guy, what makes you think the 7SOHM had any chance? I'm going with his time burned out."
Naruto,3cnwk3,gwizmcpyro,7,Thu Jul 9 19:29:00 2015 UTC,"Well, iirc, the gates multiplies the user's base power. Meaning, Dai dies not have a high base power like normal gai,  thus, when gai uses the 8th gate, he is increasing his base power exponentially. His dad's base power is not the same if gai's"
Naruto,3cnwk3,j053,2,Thu Jul 9 19:48:17 2015 UTC,Very true. I still expected him to had holes through the chests of atleast a few of them before they got smart and bum-rushed him.
Naruto,3cnwk3,gwizmcpyro,6,Fri Jul 10 02:23:05 2015 UTC,"Dai was a genin.. Eight gates multiplies the base power it does not give you super powers. So dai got much stronger but he was fighting a team of seven legendary jounin, he wasn't winning unless he got so6p mode.  Gai on the other hand was an elite jounin, and the villages strongest taijutsu user to boot. The two levels of the 8th gate do not compare in the slightest."
Naruto,3cnwk3,ImAnAppleBiteMe,3,Thu Jul 9 20:38:23 2015 UTC,hahhahah
Naruto,3cnwk3,Da_Bawl_D,2,Fri Jul 10 00:13:33 2015 UTC,I think that he beat 3 but then the timer on the Gate run out and he died.
Naruto,3cnwk3,Pifpif,3,Fri Jul 10 09:06:40 2015 UTC,i dunno about rekt. im sure its safe to assume it took out at least one or two. 8 gates is no fucken joke i dont care who you are

Naruto,3cnwk3,Orbitalmechanix,2,Fri Jul 10 16:21:24 2015 UTC,"He only killed 2, because these guys are the last generation of the Swordsmen.  Meaning Kushimaru and Jinin died, while Zabuza, Ameyuri, Mangetsu, and Jinpachi became replacements.  And then Kisame killed Fuguki."
Naruto,3cnwk3,HokageEzio,1 point,Fri Jul 10 16:41:01 2015 UTC,"What about being after the fight?

Maybe that would take away from the scene still, I'm not a writer."

Naruto,3cnwk3,Daynos_,60,Thu Jul 9 11:30:26 2015 UTC,"I don't care if it was filler/buffer, I'd take a full episod- hell a FULL ARC of kakashi and guy as kids so we can watch their eternal rivalry blossom.   It was really cool to see Kakashi be there as emotional support for Guy that I wish we could see the reverse for when Kakashi's life really goes to hell."
Naruto,3cnwk3,bhvgcf,63,Thu Jul 9 16:07:58 2015 UTC,"We did see it. In the anime, Guy actually did a great deal for Kakashi despite Kakashi turning him down. Guy constantly invited Kakashi out for dumplings but Kakashi would decline. Kakashi went out on a ton of missions which didn't give Guy much time to work with. Eventually he couldn't stand the darkness in Kakashi's heart and pleaded with the Hokage to remove him from the ANBU and succeeded.   That's how Kakashi became a Jonin Instructor leading Team 7. Despite the fact that Guy was turned down by Kakashi, Guy was always there for him and trying to do things to help him. He brought Kakashi down the right path again by having him removed from ANBU."
Naruto,3cnwk3,dynrte,7,Thu Jul 9 16:21:25 2015 UTC,"Yeah you're right I forgot about that. But that was all during his very severe depression after the whole Rin thing. It would have been nice to see Guy there for him too when Obito ""died"" and he had his new sharingan. I'm guessing he would have been too difficult to console during this period and I'm sure Guy helped him through it. But idk guess I just wish over the course of the series we'd got more of them hanging out together."
Naruto,3cnwk3,bhvgcf,4,Thu Jul 9 16:29:44 2015 UTC,"Yes, I was just giving an example of Guy being there for Kakashi. There's no reason to believe he wasn't there for Kakashi, as he even served as Obito's replacement to help him on a mission in episode 288, showing just how much Guy cares for Kakashi.  In Episode 349 Guy saves Kakashi from dying during his depression following Rin's death.  We've actually seen a lot of Guy and Kakashi being friends throughout the series, quite a lot actually. If you want more of them ""hanging out"", there's plenty of filler episodes about that too not to mention the canon material where Kakashi and Guy work together on many missions. Sure, it might be nice to see more of their friendship, but we've already seen a lot of it contrary to what you're claiming."
Naruto,3cnwk3,dynrte,16,Thu Jul 9 16:44:32 2015 UTC,My favorite is the race through the Konoha reconstruction during Kakashi's Hokage episode.
Naruto,3cnwk3,kyle6477,2,Thu Jul 9 17:41:56 2015 UTC,Yes! Great episode with them both.
Naruto,3cnwk3,TandyHard,1 point,Fri Jul 10 18:01:11 2015 UTC,I binged almost the entire show and skipped over most filler including kakashi's anbu arc so I guess I should watch some of these episodes if I want more guy/kakashi action.
Naruto,3cnwk3,bhvgcf,2,Thu Jul 9 17:14:21 2015 UTC,What episodes were these?
Naruto,3cnwk3,F_i_z_z,5,Thu Jul 9 21:17:06 2015 UTC,The filler Kakashi ANBU arc.
Naruto,3cnwk3,dynrte,2,Thu Jul 9 21:24:24 2015 UTC,"It starts at episode 344 and goes on thru episode 362. They cover a lot of Obito's beginning and then by episode 349 it delves into Kakashi's ANBU tenure and his journey. It's really a great arc. Long but full of great info on Kakashi, Minato, Itachi and of course Guy trying to help Kakashi with his pain ;)"
Naruto,3cnwk3,TandyHard,2,Fri Jul 10 18:09:12 2015 UTC,Thanks friend! I generally skip all filler but that one may be worth it!
Naruto,3cnwk3,F_i_z_z,2,Fri Jul 10 23:21:36 2015 UTC,No prob! I think it's definitely worth checking out. I've probably re-watched that particular arc dozens of times cuz it's so good... and not just cuz I'm a huge Kakashi fan ;) Hope you enjoy it!
Naruto,3cnwk3,TandyHard,12,Fri Jul 10 23:42:30 2015 UTC,It wasn't a filler though.   That whole flashback was an important piece in the manga to show why and when the eighth gate is necessary.  Fillers ended the week before the last.
Naruto,3cnwk3,CharmExclusive,10,Thu Jul 9 22:58:44 2015 UTC,"I know, I've read the manga but there still was many added scenes throughout the episode that never actually happened in the source material which were included to build on the intended flashback. Not that I'm complaining, I thought this was a brilliant set up episode for whats to come."
Naruto,3cnwk3,bhvgcf,3,Thu Jul 9 23:10:39 2015 UTC,"""I'd take a full episod- hell a FULL ARC"" Glad you don't care...... I wouldn't mind if they did all this junk AFTER the mains series is finished. I also think its ridiculous when people say stuff like this now. They are not putting real money or time into this anymore. They care about filling DVD boxes. All you would get from that arc would be half-assed animation and characters like that fat dude from the last one. The story may not even be good."
Naruto,3cnwk3,TheLawlessMan,7,Thu Jul 9 16:37:09 2015 UTC,The fat dude who sweated a lot?
Naruto,3cnwk3,doughboy011,3,Thu Jul 9 17:10:26 2015 UTC,The fat dude who sweated a lot and breathed really heavily?
Naruto,3cnwk3,HauptmannYamato,3,Thu Jul 9 21:58:59 2015 UTC,"Obviously I said that on the assumption that it would be good. With a quality story and decent animation. There's nothing inherently too wrong with filler. I know that sounds crazy but hear me out. If filler was just used tactfully and decently, and not poorly and excessively, I'm sure they wouldn't really be an issue when we are given filler now and again.  But of course, in reality when it comes to SP this is just wishful thinking since pretty much all their filler is trash and quite often comes in at the worst possible timing. Just like a decent Guy/Kakashi arc is wishful thinking which I meant in my original post."

Naruto,3cnwk3,redditrandomacc,3,Thu Jul 9 17:08:39 2015 UTC,Yeah it was so good I didn't know which bits were filler and which weren't. Is the mighty dai stuff filler? I don't wanna read the manga until after the anime finishes...
Naruto,3cnwk3,StarGangCo,2,Thu Jul 9 20:59:37 2015 UTC,"There wasn't really much filler, mostly everything in the last two episodes was from the manga."
Naruto,3cnwk3,CharmExclusive,6,Thu Jul 9 22:59:30 2015 UTC,"Not everything. Lots of it was thrown in, like five-year-old Kakashi using Tajuu Kage Bunshin."
Naruto,3cnwk3,chaosattractor,26,Thu Jul 9 23:01:46 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty happy with the amount of canon in it. Overall, pretty decent episode. Some much needed Gai progression. Kinda hoping for some decent animation next week and with the (extremely spoiler-ific) preview it doesn't seem like they'll extend the fight much longer than the manga did."
Naruto,3cnwk3,arisbee,5,Thu Jul 9 11:24:25 2015 UTC,"It seems like they're placing much more importance on the conversation than the fight.  Which I guess is fair enough, the conversation is pretty important."

Naruto,3cnwk3,Spartn90,66,Thu Jul 9 13:41:19 2015 UTC,Everyone is just bitching. Honestly I thought it was a good episode. The struggle guy's father went through to find the jutsu and pass it down to guy is pretty deep. The 8 gates technique is might duy's legacy. Honestly it makes him as a character jump up so many levels. And he did it just so he could pass on something to his son and then use it to protect him. This episode was badass. Fuck the haters.
Naruto,3cnwk3,Neural_groove,9,Thu Jul 9 13:23:01 2015 UTC,"It seems like it was just the initial comments as the supportive ones are rising to the top. I think the story they made for the background was extremely touching and Dai represents what every father wishes they could be. We got a small, but great evolution into Kakashi and Guy's friendship and even Kakashi praising Dai. It was very touching for me and I was glad I spent the time to watch it!"
Naruto,3cnwk3,F_i_z_z,2,Thu Jul 9 17:01:45 2015 UTC,Agreed. It was a good episode.

Naruto,3cnwk3,Croc_Chop,66,Thu Jul 9 15:09:10 2015 UTC,the animation for the next episode.... im not even hyped anymore
Naruto,3cnwk3,assassin19_,23,Thu Jul 9 11:44:23 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure the preview of episode 420 is just animated by the people who animated episode 419, so I don't think it represents the quality of the next episode. At least I hope so...."
Naruto,3cnwk3,TrueLongman,29,Thu Jul 9 12:49:58 2015 UTC,"it was the same with 391 (Madara revived).. preview at 390 end was shitty, but we got pretty decent animation that looked nothing like the preview"
Naruto,3cnwk3,bs_,3,Thu Jul 9 14:53:17 2015 UTC,Aimen to that to my knowledge its now two weeks between episodes so hopefully that time will be used wisely and produce a awsome episode!
Naruto,3cnwk3,Andrew4017,3,Thu Jul 9 13:21:29 2015 UTC,The episode was finished at least a month ago.
Naruto,3cnwk3,Dusk_Soldier,42,Thu Jul 9 18:51:29 2015 UTC,Seriously.. that looks really bad. This fight deserves a lot better than what I just watched.
Naruto,3cnwk3,stiggystoned369,19,Thu Jul 9 12:47:29 2015 UTC,"You mean all two seconds of it?  Not that I think the animation will be good, I don't think Studio Pierrot has different teams that are better or worse (as some people hope). They seem to care more about intros and outros than the actual episodes.  I'm not holding out hope like many people in this sub who think that because nearly every episode since kakashi vs obito has been poorly animated, they must be working really hard on these cool fight scenes we care about. I just think they're bad."
Naruto,3cnwk3,o_hai_mark,7,Thu Jul 9 13:56:59 2015 UTC,But this current outro thoo
Naruto,3cnwk3,bhvgcf,2,Thu Jul 9 16:10:02 2015 UTC,"I don't keep up with the anime much, but was this episode the first one to have this ending? Last ending I saw was that female VA one with a creepily happy Madara."

Naruto,3cnwk3,dynrte,3,Thu Jul 9 16:22:21 2015 UTC,It's been this outro since last episode but yeah it was the creepy madara one before.

Naruto,3cnwk3,bhvgcf,8,Thu Jul 9 11:14:13 2015 UTC,"My only problem is that they had 5 year old Kakashi whip out a Multi Shadow Clone Jutsu, when Shippuden Kakashi straight up tells Naruto that he can't make more than one or two clones at best."
Naruto,3cnwk3,zaldria,7,Fri Jul 10 19:02:57 2015 UTC,I noticed that as well. They definitely missed the mark there.

Naruto,3cnwk3,Mewzen,46,Thu Jul 9 17:08:06 2015 UTC,"Haven't seen it yet.  But I'm gonna make a prediction.  A bunch of complaints, a couple threads about Studio Perriot being assholes, people forgetting what was in the manga and what wasn't, the usual.  Edit-Animation was bad, it was a bunch of still shots with very minimal movement.  And those random colored movement slides in the background.  That is what actual bad animation is, contrary to what people seem to usually think.  Random pictures of eyes is not bad animation, the two frame one foot up one foot down is terrible.  Reused thumbs up scene.  Random ass black background.  Stuff like that.  This is actually a good sign, maybe even a great sign, that means they put their D team on this episode, which leaves the A team for the episodes that matter.  If you ever wanted a representation of bad animation, this what it actually is.  Content wise, disregarding the animation, it was alright.  It's Guy and Kakashi, I can't be mad.  I think of it the same way I thought of the Obito stuff they added, it adds to the character.  But it also stalls for the parts everybody is waiting for.  I'm a more patient person, I just watch stuff when it comes."
Naruto,3cnwk3,HokageEzio,2,Thu Jul 9 11:25:38 2015 UTC,Haven't seen it either and I was just searching for complainings about this episode not being canon even though it is.
Naruto,3cnwk3,catzi1,18,Thu Jul 9 11:37:56 2015 UTC,"People just don't really get the difference.  There's filler, and then there's buffer.  This was definitely buffer.  But it's building off a canon section of the story.  But the way people see things, any single thing they add is filler, and they get mad about it.  They still don't understand, everything in the series has filler.  The random add ins in fight, filler.  Scenes that are added to explain a character, filler."
Naruto,3cnwk3,HokageEzio,10,Thu Jul 9 11:41:53 2015 UTC,"Its not the filler part of the episodes that annoys me, its the fast we just had a massive filler arc as the cannon series comes to a climax, and still we are getting 2 minutes of story progression after waiting 9 months to see it get serious"
Naruto,3cnwk3,CameronMH,6,Thu Jul 9 11:51:35 2015 UTC,"I agree, they are definitely stalling.  Whether it's money or content (which I guess technically go hand in hand, cause you need money for content), we won't really know until the most important stuff comes up (Sasuke and Naruto's comeback).  For what it's worth, when it comes to say what they did with Obito, I personally thought they made up for what the manga lacked (making Rin look like more than just the cute girl next door, like an actual friend).  To me, I guess it's like a double edged sword.  They add to characters, but they stall the everliving fuck out of the main story."
Naruto,3cnwk3,HokageEzio,6,Thu Jul 9 12:05:33 2015 UTC,It sucks that I'm at work.  Uh... I guess I'll watch it tonight with a nice ice cold beer and some freshly popped popcorn.

Pathetic naruto! Their team should be ashamed of themselves for producing this garbage..At what point do they decide the fans are worth more than the money because without the fans they wouldnt be where they are!

Naruto,3cnwk3,Skodd,2,Fri Jul 10 01:09:28 2015 UTC,How do they fuck up Gai opening the 8 gates. The fan art completely blows away what Studio Perriot has done. I think nobody can deny that the way Gai looks with 8 gates is quite underwhelming. Why cant he look awesome like in the Opening?!?!? Man i hope these 2 weeks will get the animators to finally do some decent animation and give this fight the greatness it deserves
Naruto,3cnwk3,AsianCalvin-_-,2,Fri Jul 10 13:37:57 2015 UTC,"It made me tear up when Kakashi told Guy that his dad is the coolest shinobi in the village. Young Kakashi was kind of a jerk sometimes, but showed his true character in the times it was needed most."

Naruto,3cnwk3,MiaCannons,15,Thu Jul 9 12:42:28 2015 UTC,Because Studio Pierrot comes on Reddit in a completely different language to see our complaints in the first place.
Naruto,3cnwk3,HokageEzio,2,Thu Jul 9 12:46:51 2015 UTC,"""Our complaints"" = fan complaints. The Reddit Naruto fanbase is hardly unique: if we're complaining about something, fans in Japan probably are as well."

There are a lot of flaws in the story, but I'm a fan and I atleast enjoy experiencing the story.   But lately I haven't really enjoyed any episodes. As a person who has read through all of the later chapters, I watch the anime hoping that they can make the experience better or atleast decent. Some good pacing without filler or prolonged flashbacks, or maybe some solid animation and cool fighting scenes.   I'm not seeing it. I probably need to take a break."

Naruto,3cnwk3,Bartiemus,2,Fri Jul 10 12:32:36 2015 UTC,"After seeing the preview for next next week, you guys gotta keep your expectations in check..   Lemme rant a bit,   I'm confused though, how can this bad animation and forever stalling kept occurring to one of the most popular anime ever? Some of you guys said Studio Pierrot kept the animation bad decent and put so many fillers in between to preserve budget and make some time to greatly animate some certain episode, Uh Oh, it seems that's not the case! Seriously, last episode who i felt has that great touch of animation was Obito vs Kakashi, you can actually see there is something different in the animation, the drawing, the outline, coloring, animation flow, etc etc. The other episode worth mentioning was Madara vs Alliance.   Lots and lots of battle animation in between was animated as decent (in a sense of 'bad' kind of decent) as they could. Whole battle between Karui army, Kakashi army, Gaara army (sans Madara part), Mifune army, basically almost the whole battle parts of 4th Shinobi War. I am OK if i had to suffer bad animation and fillers if we got great animation for every character battle there is. Hell, what even i'm talking about? even in episodes where no battle scene present, even in flashback semi-filler episode we had today, Pierrot still butchered the animation with probably lowest budget as they could.   In the end, Studio Pierrot did all of this because of money they get from commercial in between every episode and they don't give a damn about the quality in the end, and we just have to suck on butchered animation they gave us every week. The attachment works with us needed them, not the other way around, so the least we can do is rant or complaining. Not counting the filler material they gave us, Allied Shinobi Mom Forces and Ninja Ostrich, very amazing indeed, great job Pierrot!! /s  /rant  Fun fact, the case of ultra amazing animation seems to be happens once every year, Kakashi vs Obito aired in 2014, Madara vs Alliance aired in 2013, Chikara arc (even though it's filler, it has movie production quality animation) aired in 2012. We haven't see this case for this year, and it's clearly not for Gai vs Madara, because you've seen next week preview don't ya?   At this point, i'd rather have 24 or 25 episodes seasonal anime where the animation was amazing in every episode with breaks every year, than all-year-long episode with shitty animation every week with fillers and flashback all over the place.   So, it will probably happen to"

Naruto,3ct6qu,ohnoyouwont,3,Fri Jul 10 16:03:57 2015 UTC,and that would make upto 3-5 episodes without adding any filler. I believe they'll just adjust that into the current series.

Sure they could add in some slightly improved art in 10 years instead of 1, but in my opinion the difference would be so minor. The pacing in parts can be even worse then the filler to, so getting that resolved would be nice. I'd like to see it started when he's a kid and not right at Shippuden. I always though it was weird Kai skipped Dragon Ball."
Naruto,3co6hn,TLCplLogan,0,Fri Jul 10 12:09:47 2015 UTC,Less dialogue takes away from narutos main attack
Naruto,3co6hn,TLCplLogan,3,Sat Jul 11 09:24:30 2015 UTC,"You're joking, but that wouldn't necessarily be a bad thing. I mean, it's a huge time skip between the last two chapters and its not exactly like 700 has a ton of content, or anything. It would be nice to see some filler stuff."
Naruto,3co6hn,TLCplLogan,2,Fri Jul 10 13:07:10 2015 UTC,"Yes, it would be a bad thing.  Just because they are 20 years older doesn't mean I want that done in real time.  They can add stuff in, like Naruto becoming Hokage, or things like that.  But there is nothing to add after 699.  Unless they're going to show me what Sasuke's doing, I don't care.  And I'm not even the type who wants to slit my wrists the moment I see filler."
Naruto,3co6hn,SilverStoneSlide,2,Fri Jul 10 13:10:51 2015 UTC,"I guess I don't see what the big deal is. By the time that they get that far, there isn't anything else to cover besides 700, which they could easily do in one episode. Why not do at least a few fillers? Or maybe even animate some of the Hiden stuff?"
Naruto,3co6hn,SilverStoneSlide,1 point,Fri Jul 10 13:16:49 2015 UTC,"Gonna say what I said to a different guy.   They can't just up and decide that though. That would be my guess, though I'm no business man. They have to actually get the licensing for it from Shonen Jump, I would guess. Which is a long process.   They can't just decide what they animate.  They are licensed for Naruto Shippuden, not Gaiden.  Not the novels.  That's not how business works."

And for their sake, because nobody want to watch Pierrot's filler, and this will affect Naruto's rating on the TV.  Still remember that Ostrich ninja filler. I forced myself to watch it, and I literally got headache by watching that freakin annoying Ostrich.  The casts also isn't like their regular selves in the filler, usually they suddenly get a lot weaker and a lot stupider which really fuel my hatred towards Pierrot's brand of filler.  Ugghhh.

Naruto,3co6hn,live22morrow,5,Thu Jul 9 13:36:37 2015 UTC,:(
Naruto,3co6hn,SlipperyThong,6,Thu Jul 9 13:21:28 2015 UTC,"It's pretty sad when you think about it.  Naruto runs the show, so they're gonna keep it going as long as they can.  Seeing that just confirmed it has nothing to do with stalling for the important bits.  The only bit I have any hope for now is the final fight."
Naruto,3co6hn,MIMBs,6,Thu Jul 9 13:25:28 2015 UTC,"Anime is a business after all so it doesn't surprise me, the fact that the animators get paid jack and the industry seems to be on downward trajectory financially means that filler and shoddy animation is always inevitable. I don't really mind it when there's filler, i've grown to prefer the manga."
Naruto,3co6hn,lizauchiha,8,Thu Jul 9 15:45:51 2015 UTC,"I hate Studio Pierrot with a burning passion now. I understand wanting to pump out more Garbage Filler to extend the life of the Anime, but they literally keep going to filler in the middle of the CLIMAX of the entire plot. Make crappy filler after the final arc!   Everytime I get hyped because of the awesome stuff happening, Pierrot comes in and puts out Filler after Filler. Heck, recently, we returned to canon from an extremely large Filler Arc for One and a half episodes.   At this point, the Anime is turning into a Bleach."
Naruto,3co6hn,Dovahking94,3,Thu Jul 9 15:11:47 2015 UTC,That's because with bleach they kept catching up with the manga so filler is there as a buffer.
Naruto,3co6hn,hokagenaruto,4,Thu Jul 9 15:46:47 2015 UTC,"The problem is that the manga is over, and has been for nearly a year. They're only doing filler now to maximize the episode count before they reach the end, so they can get more money from advertisers and DVD sales. Even worse is that their fillers and flashbacks are lazily conceived and inserted in ways that completely kill the story's momentum.  It's a cashgrab, plain and simple."
Naruto,3co6hn,mykal17,5,Thu Jul 9 18:08:57 2015 UTC,"That is how the industry works, they want to milk it as much as they can so they can keep their jobs. This is a business, and animators gets paid next to nothing."
Naruto,3crhe4,blitzkGreg,7,Fri Jul 10 04:37:29 2015 UTC,"You would have another teammate join you in their place or you would join another team. It has long been assumed that Sakura joined Ino and Chouji in one of the future Chuunin Exams, for example."
Naruto,3crhe4,knight504,4,Fri Jul 10 05:39:38 2015 UTC,"In a later filler arc, it's revealed that Sakura took Shikamaru's place as the third member. I'm guessing something similar was at work."
Naruto,3crhe4,vladthetransilvanian,2,Fri Jul 10 04:49:29 2015 UTC,"On another note, was it ever said how one becomes a Jonin?"
Naruto,3crhe4,AustinRivers25,2,Sat Jul 11 05:28:17 2015 UTC,I haven't come across it yet. Figured I'd cross that bridge when naruto gets there :p
Naruto,3crhe4,Waterbeetles,2,Sat Jul 11 05:43:19 2015 UTC,"Pretty sure you only become a Jonin after the Hokage promotes you to it, no exam included."
Naruto,3crhe4,AustinRivers25,1 point,Sat Jul 11 11:58:50 2015 UTC,Ahh okay. Sounds reasonable but not as fun as the chuunin exams.
Naruto,3crhe4,onlytoask,1 point,Sat Jul 11 15:26:35 2015 UTC,"Members mix up to fill in the gaps. Sakura probably filled Shikamaru's spot on Team 10, for example. Having a full squad is the important part, not who's in it."
Naruto,3crhe4,AuraXmaster,-3,Fri Jul 10 06:04:19 2015 UTC,They would still have to take the exam. Most of them still go on missions as a team even after becoming jonin as seen with neji
Naruto,3crhe4,onlytoask,5,Fri Jul 10 04:47:51 2015 UTC,That's ridiculously incorrect.
Naruto,3crhe4,dynrte,6,Fri Jul 10 06:02:18 2015 UTC,"Alternatively, this could explain the plothole of Kakashi somehow taking the Chunin Exam at the same time as Obito and Rin and Guy while apparently becoming a Chunin at age 6 (Obito didn't even graduate the academy until age 9 and is the same age as Kakashi)  I don't actually assume this to be true by the way. Not my headcanon, I just felt like pointing out a plot inconsistency. Don't kill me :v"
Naruto,3crhe4,zibwefuh,1 point,Fri Jul 10 09:14:27 2015 UTC,wait so a jonin could potentially be competing against genin in the chunin exams?
Naruto,3crhe4,BasedNoface,2,Fri Jul 10 04:50:25 2015 UTC,I mean there could also be two S-Rank criminals disguised as a genin and a woman competing against genin in the chunin exams :P

I guess I'll start by saying thank you, it has been such an amazing experience, I honestly could not equate my feelings into words to rightly say how fantastic these last two or so years have been. I remember when I first saw the Colorkage group, I was looking to see if anybody had colored the Naruto Manga; I was having trouble to make out what was happening in the action scenes and figured that would help. Before then I had no idea anybody even colored manga. I searched online and eventually came across this website stating that they hosted colored Naruto chapters. Alas, I had found something! I spent the next hours just completely shut in and immersed, devouring chapter after chapter, I just simply couldn't believe it; this group of people colored Naruto, and it was awesome! (This was around when they had only colored up to around chapter 655.)  After I was done reading through the chapters a thought sprung into my head... maybe I could be one of them. I mean no, there is no way they would let me in-- wait a second, I have an idea! That idea was to somehow learn how to color, so I could join the Colorkage. And I am so thankful that said idea popped into my stupid head and stuck around for long enough to make an impact instead of rushing away in the constant flow of daily thoughts. I was determined. Determined to learn how to color and get into the Colorkage. Now, prior to this I hadn't done anything especially art-y besides doodling a few stick men. Regardless I practiced day in and day out, and while I met much failure, I soon saw my skills progressing. I decided it was time to post some of my colorings on the /R/Naruto subreddit, and possibly get noticed by the Colorkage.  And so I did and, surprisingly enough to me, they were met with words of encouragement and criticism. And so I continued posting my shitty beginner colorings, and the best part is that it was the words of the denizens of /R/Naruto that motivated me enough to actually continue coloring and practicing. After a while of my daily practicing, along came a thread. A thread that I will never forget; a Colorkage recruitment thread! I lept at the chance and put together my submissions. Checking every hour to see if I had gotten in. I was intimidated by the other colorists attempting to join, but that didn't stop me. Eventually came a message, saying that I was accepted. I lept with joy, I ran around my house ecstatic, I didn't have a care in the world, I had finally gotten in! And what a journey it has been since. I have made many amazing friends and learned lessons I will never forget. These guys, the Colorkage, have helped me these past two or so years to improve my skills greatly, and have been simply amazing. My favorite part by far has been the interacting with other Colorkage. I have loved and will cherish every moment with these goddamn fantastic assholes. Yes, even the constant spamming of  'Tearin up My Heart'. Stay golden, motherfuckers.  As for the community, The encouragement from all you guys still has pushed me to continue coloring. Thank you so much.  Much love, Rekkiton. (and sorry for the wall of text)"
Naruto,3cmmeu,Rekkiton,11,Thu Jul 9 02:23:08 2015 UTC,"Oh look, its politically correct Rekkiton.  Oh man, I remember when you joined. I could not really handle your personality. But I'm glad that we ended up getting along in the end."

Naruto,3cmmeu,PathofAvin,15,Thu Jul 9 20:41:47 2015 UTC,"Ey so since this will be our final chapter I guess everyone's gonna write something down in the comments. I have no idea how feelsy they will be but I guess mine is gonna be rather feelsy so I don't know it's a warning or something. I'm not sure why I'm typing this but whatever.  Anyway, so it's our last chapter! Thanks for all the support throughout the two years. It's been sorta a while ride. You guys see our final work but never really get a glimpse at the process and conversations we have while working on the chapter and while I enjoy putting out a finished product for everyone to look at, for me, the real fun of the Colorkage has been interacting with the group members. The only reason I joined in the first place was sort of a fluke. It was around 2am and Cdi-Fails and Properlogic accepted my work into the group and thus I was a Colorkage in its infancy. I was in and excited. It was fun to work on coloring a manga that I have been following for practically my whole life. I saw the first airing of Naruto on Toonami and have been hooked ever since, but I digress. For the first five weeks of coloring I had a blast. Sure I wasn't very good but it was great to have conversations with others about art and Naruto for what really was the first time I talked to others about it. But surely and slowly something had been creeping into my life that I knew would happen eventually.   It's hard to explain exactly how I felt. I like to imagine it like a constant climb up a mountain. Everyone's climbing along with you. Sure some people are ahead and some behind but everyone's together. When depression hits you you just stop climbing and walk back down that god forsaken mountain. Every step you take beings you closer to the flat, sprawling plain that lies at the foot of the mountain. Once you get there  there's little hope of climbing back up. I'm explaining this because for a lot of people it's hard to understand. Anyway, so for 29 chapters I slowly tumbled down the mountain, not communicating, not coloring, not doing much of anything. I had left behind the relationships and friendships I had formed in the group and it killed me inside. I realize how silly and overdramatic this sounds but for the five weeks that I colored I felt like I had made some real friends in the group and It sucked to leave them behind though Im not sure if they would remember me. So after 29 weeks I sent a PM to Properlogic asking to rejoin the group. He accepted and eyyyy they remembered me! I must note that I'm still depressed at this point and although I'm back to coloring my heart isn't in it. If I recall correctly the week I rejoined Rekkiton also joined but I cant remember exactly. When Rekkiton did join though I noticed one thing; we were both on the same level of ability. We weren't good but I'll be damned if we weren't equal. So the night I first met Rekkiton we skyped about how to color grass. I had no idea what I was doing but hey, I found someone in the group that I can compete and grow with in the hopes that we both might achieve a level of coloring that will blow everyone away!   For fifteen weeks my new-found drive kept me coloring and trying to improve but I hated it. I truly hated coloring with a passion. It felt like a chore and that initial five week drive and love I had was gone, too high up this mountain to ever reach again and so, at the tail end of the fifteen weeks I had given up. I felt that I wasn't improving enough to stay in it. And I left for a second time leaving behind much more friendships and bonds than before. At this point the Kage really did feel like a second family. We all have our nuances, our inside jokes, and we really did care about what each other was doing.  When I left for the second time I was not in a good place for various reasons but I knew that I could not longer produce quality enough work to justify hanging around and felt that I would bring down the quality of the chapters. This time was rather rough for me and without going into detail, I do need to thank Lim, Des, and Rekk here. Anyways, so while I was away from coloring one thing, like last time, kept me tied. It was the people involved. I didn't care for coloring this much is true, but I did care for the friendships gained along the way, all of them with every kage. So after some more time I came back this time not carings for quality but really just wanting to be apart of the group. I resigned myself to not really caring about the quality of my work but instead cared and focused more on maintaining friendships with the kage.   And that's where I'm at today. I really do hate coloring but I can never hate this group. Everyone in it has been so wonderful I would never trade these experiences for the world. In the beginning I wasn't sure why I was writing this and while I'm not sure anyone really wants to read this I think I have a point to make and that point lies in the fact that no matter what we do or how we feel we're not alone. And though emotionally I've been through hell and back there's always been an anchor; friends. Again, I know this can sound really silly but whatever, it's the truth and while everyone sees our colorings every week, they don't really see the friendship that the group spawned. So it is with a heavy heart that this essay is posted. Not beacuse I'm sad I won't color but because I know that the friendships formed may not last. While of course I want them to I can't predict the future. So to the kages I'll say thank you, truly from the bottom of my heart, thank you for the wonderful memories."

Too much has happened to be able to sum it up in a few paragraphs, but one of my favorite parts of this whole project was probably interacting with the rest of the kage, many that have left and many that are still here. Watching them improve, along with the personalities they brought with them has been a great joy.  Thanks for all the support guys, we couldn't have done it without you!"
Naruto,3cmmeu,Desorienter,7,Thu Jul 9 02:44:47 2015 UTC,"This has been a helluva lotta fun for the short (nearly 2 months!) that I've been here, and I only wish I would've joined sooner.

Naruto,3cmmeu,PurpleKakashi,6,Thu Jul 9 02:57:35 2015 UTC,"I just want to say how great these past couple months have been for me. I got drafted into the group and in no time at all you guys not only taught me how to do this, you guys let me into the group easily, making me feel very welcome. I cannot express how much of an experience this has been, I can’t imagine what it’s like for the guys that have been doing this for a couple years. From learning basic tech, to creating monstrosities at 4 in the morning, it’s all been great. Thank you for everything guys, you’re all the fucking best."
Naruto,3cmmeu,D1V1NEONE,5,Thu Jul 9 02:23:47 2015 UTC,"I guess this is my message, though I have no idea what I will actually write, so please bear with me. Naruto and especially /r/naruto are a special part of my life. Things would have been very different, at least I would not have been a colorkage and writing this that's for sure. So, like last year, I was browsing the net, searching the net for some colored Naruto chapters (reading black and whites becomes boring yo) and I stumbled upon this website called colorkage.com and wow I just found something I least expected and what I wanted - colored Naruto manga. So I started reading this and was amazed by the awesomeness.  Then I came to this place called reddit, and saw that a guy named Rekkiton has cleaned up some pages and wants to see how others colored. And I grabbed a page, and started to use MS Paint (ridiculous isn't it?) and found out that this shit is HARD and other novice guys were doing much better than me. So, I scrolled down and saw that Rekkiton had posted this Amaretti tutorial and seeing that, I downloaded photoshop and got into coloring.  The sub itself was extremely helpful. Without the sub, I would have quit ages ago. They looked at my shitty works like this and told me how to improve. They never told me I sucked and that I should quit. And gradually I improved. So, its all thanks to this sub that I am now  a colorkage (though I still have a lot to improve)  As a colorkage the experience has been nice. I am the newest here (only like a month old). But the guys are totally awesome, if  you ask them they really help you out and I picked up some technics while I have been here. And although sometimes completing the pages turned extremely boring it was still cool.   I guess this is the end. There are more things but writing all that down...I can't.    THANK YOU Y'ALL"

Naruto,3cmmeu,86mcss,5,Thu Jul 9 04:06:21 2015 UTC,Joining the colorkage was a great decision for me. I've learned so much from the group and just having the opportunity to color on a weekly basis has been great. I always struggled to find things to draw or come up with ideas. This project lead me to do so much more artwork than I could ever have done alone. The talent in the group is incredible. Seeing everyone's colorings progress from start to finish in the Dropbox was always one of my favorite things to witness. It's sad that this is over...I've been so busy lately I haven't been able to chat with everyone as much as I would have liked. I hope we stick together and do small projects here or there. Every colorkage has been friendly and just awesome to talk to.   Thanks for encouraging me to join after I made those first few posts on r/naruto! I hope I was a good help :) ... And thanks everyone who's viewed our work. Your compliments and critique encourage us and make us better at what we love.   ....Ill miss this. Though it's nice to be free!

Naruto,3cq7ei,Im_Sparkz,1 point,Thu Jul 9 22:19:40 2015 UTC,"here's a quick tl;dw for what happened up until the Naruto vs Pain fight which I'll assume you've seen.  Season 1: The Akatsuki (cloaked dudes) go after Gaara (who is now the Kazekage of the sand village), and successfully capture and kill him.  They take his tailed beast and Naruto and friends save Gaara and kill one Akatsuki member (Sasori) in the process.  Gaara is revived by an old lady, but the Akatsuki still keep the tailed beast.  Season 2:  Naruto and friends continue the search for Sasuke and have a little battle with Orochimaru on the way.  They find Sasuke in one of Orochimaru's hideouts and have a little altercation with him.  They realize Sasuke is cold blooded and set on revenge and appears to care very little about the old times with Team 7.  Sasuke leaves with Orochimaru and Naruto wishes he was stronger to help Sasuke.  Season 3:  The Akatsuki continue capturing the tailed beasts, Naruto trains to get stronger, and then Shikamaru and Asuma's team fight some Akatsuki.  Asuma dies, but later Naruto and friends help out and defeat two more Akatsuki members (Hidan and Kakazu).  Season 4:  Sasuke kills and absorbs Orochimaru before Orochimaru could take Sasuke's body and then he goes on a hunt to kill Itachi.  Sasuke rescues some of Orochimaru's prisoners and forms a team with them.  Sasuke fights and kills an Akatsuki member along the way (Deidara).  Naruto and friends try and track Sasuke down, but run into an Itachi clone on the way.  Itachi's other clone meets with Sasuke and tells him where to go so they can end their feud.  Season 5:  Jiraiya goes on a mission to the rain village to track down the leader of the Akatsuki.  He learns it was one of his old students, and transmits the message to the leaf village before he dies.  Season 6:  Sasuke kills Itachi after a long battle, and is taken to a hideout by an Akatsuki member (Tobi) who reveals himself to be Madara Uchiha (spoiler, he's not really Madara).  He tells Sasuke the truth about Itachi (Itachi was ordered by the leaf village to kill the Uchiha because they were planning a revolt.  Itachi was actually a good guy and cared a lot about Sasuke).  Then Sasuke joins up with Tobi and the Akatsuki and goes and captures Killer Bee and the 8 tails.  Oh and Sasuke learns a new jutsu (Amaterasu).  Season 7:  The leader of the Akatsuki (Pain) attacks and dismantles the leaf village and kills a shit ton of people.  Naruto goes and masters sage mode then returns to the village and defeats Pain.  He met his father in his psyche during the battle and his father turns out to be the fourth hokage Minato and they share some touching moments.  Pain turns out to be Nagato (a student of Jiraiya's) and then Nagato (who also has the Rinnegan) gives up his life to bring everyone he killed back to life.  Everyone in  the village now loves Naruto and he's a hero.  Alright that sums up Naruto up til 2010 pretty nicely.  Also there won't be a new Naruto episode next week due to a Pokemon special.  July 23rd is when the new episode comes out.  If you want to know more about the plot then I suggest reading here."

Naruto,3cq7ei,HardChibi,1 point,Thu Jul 9 23:48:37 2015 UTC,Read the damn manga.
Naruto,3cq7ei,Spartn90,1 point,Fri Jul 10 05:22:27 2015 UTC,You should either watch the episodes (while skipping the fillers) or read the manga. Next week there will be no episode so you have 2 weeks time to catch up :) Pretty doable if you love the series.
Naruto,3cra2v,ItzzFinite,2,Fri Jul 10 03:28:17 2015 UTC,Haha cutting off his tongue wouldn't do anything. He can literally just shed his skin to heal from all damage.
Naruto,3cra2v,rkellyturbo,-1,Fri Jul 10 03:48:14 2015 UTC,"The tongue is an organ though, not skin."
Naruto,3cra2v,cjspike1357,7,Fri Jul 10 03:58:12 2015 UTC,Skin is an organ
Naruto,3cra2v,rkellyturbo,4,Fri Jul 10 04:01:14 2015 UTC,"Like i said, it lets him heal from all damage, even regrow lost limbs.  And that's just one of the possibly thousands of ways he can escape death."
Naruto,3cra2v,Try_Another_Please,1 point,Fri Jul 10 05:35:17 2015 UTC,He healed himself after almost disintegrating once so I doubt it'd do anything

Naruto,3cp2th,3mn_,11,Thu Jul 9 17:07:38 2015 UTC,I always assumed that line meant that he had time to do it before he died.
Naruto,3cp2th,Ultrahuntr,0,Thu Jul 9 17:26:34 2015 UTC,"Yeah its possible, but I would imagine nagato would of lived if he didnt use it, he still had enough chakra to survive seeing as he had he enough to use the technique, and naruto wouldnt kill him"
Naruto,3cp2th,Ultrahuntr,4,Thu Jul 9 17:31:37 2015 UTC,"That's just conjecture. He could've known he was dying, but had just enough chakra to revive everyone. This is more believable, seeing as he died afterward."
Naruto,3cp2th,Ultrahuntr,1 point,Thu Jul 9 17:43:32 2015 UTC,"It could be, im not denying that, but konan even says 'if he uses that technique with his current chakra levels, nagato will not survive, he is willing to go that far for this child' to me, this makes it sounds alot more like he is choosing to die rather than he is going to die anyway, and I imagine his current chakra levels would of been, at minimum, enough to survive if he had enough to revive that many people, but who knows, i guess its not really made clear"
Naruto,3cp2th,dynrte,3,Thu Jul 9 18:09:08 2015 UTC,"Fair enough, but in relation to your original post, I still don't think the length of time Madara was dead would have had anything to do with it. regardless on whether or not he he would've died without enough chakra to sustain himself."
Naruto,3cp2th,Sm0kescreeen,3,Thu Jul 9 19:19:16 2015 UTC,"I concur with Ultrahuntr that there's nothing to indicate that there was a time limit on Rinne Rebirth and that Nagato was most likely referring to the fact that he can still cast the technique before he dies.  As far as Konan goes, she was probably still under the impression that Nagato could be saved (and he probably could have) whereas Nagato did not believe he would survive.  Also got to remember that there are more circumstances at play here. ""I still have time to revive everyone"" can be taken many ways. It's possible that there were more complications in reviving many people as opposed to one. Either way, Nagato was pretty vague and this is a translation and it makes more sense when read in its original language.  TL;DR Nagato was too vague and there are too many mysteries surrounding the Samsara of Heavenly Life Technique to make a conclusion."
Naruto,3cp2th,DoubleHunter,3,Thu Jul 9 20:30:58 2015 UTC,"Based on what Nagato said, it is implied there is a time limit. Madara planned for this; before he died he told Obito that he left behind some rod that contained his ""essence"" which would allow Nagato to revive him. It's the same reason Obito was able to revive Madara after Black Zetsu took over him. Madara's ""essence"" was in the Edo-Tensei body, so even though a lot of time passed since his death he could still be revived."
Naruto,3cp2th,Legovil,3,Thu Jul 9 21:01:55 2015 UTC,"Thanks, this makes sense"
Naruto,3cp2th,rkellyturbo,1 point,Thu Jul 9 21:11:03 2015 UTC,Perhaps the technique becomes less efficent when it's used on multiple people.   What I have a hard time figuring out is how a geezer Madara could be able to take control of the Juubi.
Naruto,3cscc2,MrChunkylump,1 point,Fri Jul 10 11:18:08 2015 UTC,You can watch it on NWanime but its Korean audio and shit subs

Naruto,3cscc2,Kyuubi87,1 point,Fri Jul 10 11:59:11 2015 UTC,You can if you want poor subtitles and Korean audio. I'm personally buying The Last blu-ray asap when it comes out since it never aired in the UK.
Naruto,3cscc2,garrison105,1 point,Fri Jul 10 17:33:48 2015 UTC,any idea of release date in the UK?
Naruto,3cscc2,garrison105,-2,Fri Jul 10 20:36:23 2015 UTC,Here.
Naruto,3csgp0,garrison105,10,Fri Jul 10 12:11:37 2015 UTC,"As a person who asked this question himself, I know it is asked often but in the end of th day, many simply don't know that. Asking directly answers far better than Google ever could, especially when looking for movies. You have to find the right movie, with the right video/audio, etc... trustworthy site, and these things can be better answered by people like us rather than strangers on google."
Naruto,3csgp0,MaimedPhoenix,3,Fri Jul 10 13:08:31 2015 UTC,Exactly. God forbid a fanbase be friendly and enjoy helping people enjoy their hobby better.
Naruto,3csgp0,hunterbelmont,7,Fri Jul 10 13:13:34 2015 UTC,"Well, most people on the sub are pretty cool and helpful and every time the question is asked, at least one person answers it. But in general, people on the internet are jerks."

I've been having this argument with people like you for years, and I'm going to say what I always say:  UNLESS YOU BELONG TO A FAST-PACED, HIGH TRAFFIC COMMUNITY, THERE IS NO COMPETITION FOR THE FRONT PAGE.  This subreddit moves slow and molasses, with content remaining on the front page for sometimes over a day. Downvotes easily sort out content like repetitive questions. This is not an issue. It is not something that needs to be dealt with. You are wrong on this one."
Naruto,3csgp0,hunterbelmont,-5,Fri Jul 10 13:08:17 2015 UTC,"I am so sorry I have offended you. I am merely suggesting people should try to google a question before asking others.  Also, a rule that prevents obvious questions is not elitist. The questions always both go unanswered, downvoted to hell, or even met with outright hostility. Which would be prevented if they weren't allowed.  Also, you comment I'm an ""entitled"" ""elitist"" ""jerk"" ""Comic Book Guy"" looking down on ""pleb questions"" from my ""little fort"" all based on ""having this argument with people like you for years"", but we've never spoken before, and you expect me to treat the daily volley of repeated obvious questions with respect and on a case-by-case basis, huh? Fair enough."
Naruto,3csgp0,hunterbelmont,3,Fri Jul 10 14:51:59 2015 UTC,"There is no daily volley of repeated obvious questions being leveled at you. You are choosing to cruise the new section and take part in slow-moving communities that have no competition for front page space. You have no right to complain about repetition because you're not being inconvenienced by it in any way on any level. You can ignore it completely and have the exact same experience on /r/naruto that you would otherwise have.  If, say, you're on /r/technology and you see ten submissions about Comcast on the front page, that's ten submissions about other topics that you wouldn't be able to see. That's why mods of fast subreddits allow you to filter out certain topics. However, in small subreddits like this, where there aren't a lot of submissions anyway, content remains on the front page for sometimes more than a day. You are losing out on nothing by people spamming questions about The Last. This entire issue is you just being annoyed at seeing something, when you could easily not pay it any attention.   Also, a rule that prevents obvious questions is not elitist. The questions always both go unanswered, downvoted to hell, or even met with outright hostility. Which would be prevented if they weren't allowed.   Nobody wants a community where questions just get deleted left and right. That's much more of a turn off than downvotes or even open hostility. It's basically saying, ""You're not good enough to have a say here"". We don't want that for /r/naruto.   Also, you comment I'm an ""entitled"" ""elitist"" ""jerk"" ""Comic Book Guy"" looking down on ""pleb questions"" from my ""little fort"" all based on ""having this argument with people like you for years"", but we've never spoken before   The fact that you use the term ""spoon-feed"" is pretty telling."

Dude, you're talking about banning questions and auto-deleting submissions. You are not turning this around on me. Anyway you look at it, you're the elitist trying to be hostile to newcomers. I'm advocating on their behalf and trying to explain to you all what a non-issue this is.   The fact that you judge strangers like so is pretty telling.   Right, how strange it is to judge people on what they say . . .   Who's ""nobody""? Who's ""we""? Do you mean ""I""? I use ""I"" to refer to myself and for my personal opinions. Which I know are both subjective, and mine and mine alone.   Fine, let's sticky a poll. We can ask people ""Do you want to be welcoming to newcomers, or do you want this to be a fort where only the cool kids get in?"" What do you think is going to be the preferred answer?  So yes, we don't want that for /r/naruto. We don't want a community that's hostile to newcomers and who gets upset at things that don't affect them on any level at all."
Naruto,3csgp0,hunterbelmont,-2,Fri Jul 10 15:23:27 2015 UTC,"I don't get why you think it's something that shouldn't be brought up to the mods.  We just had a discussion on the spoilers, which the mods supported.  People said what they had to say, and a decision was made.  It wasn't people being entitled, they had reason to both sides."
Naruto,3csgp0,HokageEzio,3,Fri Jul 10 15:39:41 2015 UTC,That is a completely apples and oranges situation. The spoiler policy affects all active users. Questions about The Last don't affect anyone who doesn't want to be affected by it.
Naruto,3csgp0,hunterbelmont,-2,Fri Jul 10 15:42:55 2015 UTC,"Spoilers also wouldn't affect anyone if they chose to go to /r/narutomanga , but nobody planned on doing that.  I don't see why putting a little notification to make things run smoothly is this big fucking problem to you."

I don't see why putting a little notification to make things run smoothly is this big fucking problem to you.   It isn't. I've said that multiple times.

Naruto,3csgp0,Spartn90,-1,Fri Jul 10 15:50:06 2015 UTC,I honestly don't understand why this guy is so vehement about this. It's like he doesn't even want the subject talked about.
Naruto,3csgp0,HokageEzio,0,Fri Jul 10 15:43:57 2015 UTC,"Probably because he's one of the people who asked ""where can I find the Last in Japanese with English subs?"""
Naruto,3csgp0,hunterbelmont,-1,Fri Jul 10 17:11:55 2015 UTC,Literally every post disagreeing with what he's saying he has to say something...
Naruto,3csgp0,HokageEzio,0,Fri Jul 10 15:44:33 2015 UTC,"That says more about you than it does about me. I've calmly explained how this is a non-issue that affects no one, but everyone continues to counter with,   No, no, no! I have a right to be offended and annoyed at things that don't affect me! We should change the rules to accommodate me and fuck over newcomers who aren't as l33t as I am."
Naruto,3csgp0,idontevenknowbrah,2,Fri Jul 10 15:56:45 2015 UTC,"How?  Every single comment somebody has made has been followed by your retort.  You are the one continuously bringing on the replies, followed by anybody disagreeing needing to rethink their opinions."
Naruto,3csgp0,hunterbelmont,-1,Fri Jul 10 16:04:20 2015 UTC,"Oh come on son, that's a massive strawman and you know it. No one is screaming about this problem on either end. In fact, I can just as easily say that pretty much everyone everyone other than you is just reasonably pointing out that:   Posts about the last have become incredibly numerous. Maybe the mods should do something to answer the question before it's asked?   And you're acting like:   No no no! You're all entitled freaks that hate newcomers! Anyone that disagrees with me is an entitled freak! You aren't allowed to care about this! Don't you dare question me while I proceed to do the same to you! You all care too much about this!"

We can ask people ""Do you want to be welcoming to newcomers, or do you want this to be a fort where only the cool kids get in?"" What do you think is going to be the preferred answer?   See, that kind of feels like a leading question. Kind of like   ""Have you stopped beating your kids? (Y) (N)""   How about:   Should questions about where to find ""The Last"" or other unreleased movies be left alone, or be filtered out?   If the majority votes that the posts not be filtered, then fine. It was addressed, and now I'd know I'm in the minority, no problem. That's democracy."
Naruto,3csgp0,hunterbelmont,2,Fri Jul 10 15:35:33 2015 UTC,"At this point, I'd like to ban people complaining about questions about The Last. We need fewer Comic Book Guys here who are jerks to newcomers."

Naruto,3csgp0,hunterbelmont,0,Fri Jul 10 17:15:04 2015 UTC,"So you'd have me banned, for disagreeing with you?  Notice you've been as much of a jerk to everyone in this thread as I have been to you. So, you'd share the ban with me too, right?  I don't want anyone banned. I want repeated posts filtered."
Naruto,3csgp0,HokageEzio,2,Fri Jul 10 15:46:51 2015 UTC,"Again, you're not turning this around on me. I'm advocating for being nice to new users, and you're advocating for being a hostile jerk to new users. I saw your smug ""let me google that for you"" comment that caused you to make this submission in the first place. Do you think this community needs more people like you, looking down on casual fans who just want a little assistance?"
Naruto,3csgp0,hunterbelmont,1 point,Fri Jul 10 15:51:30 2015 UTC,"You also noticed it was the only comment there? It was a dick about it because I'm sick of that question. But I answered. I did send him the link. You think he's watching the movie right now?  Where were you? You respond here, defending the questions, but are not there actually answering them? Don't you want a welcoming community?"
Naruto,3csgp0,HokageEzio,0,Fri Jul 10 16:05:36 2015 UTC,"I'm gonna play devil's advocate, even though I'm usually one of the first people to reply getting ticked off when I see a post about The Last.  Some of the people who come in and ask don't even visit this subreddit.  There was a dude a couple days ago who had no clue that it was a common question.  There is no proper way for them to think ""oh, this must be a question asked every day, let me look for it"".  Sure, you can google to look for it.  But none of those are the high quality one they are waiting for.  So what I suggest, put a sticky at the top of the movie release dates (for both movies).  Put it where the Chapter Discussion goes, not like we're gonna be having anymore any time soon, right?  And then revise the rules to put a big ass bold sentence saying the dates and not to ask about it.  I'm not just talking read the rules.  I want BIG ASS BLACK LETTERS saying the dates and not to ask about it.  I want it to take up 90 percent of their fucking screen.    That is my solution, #VoteHokageEzio4Mod"
Naruto,3csgp0,hunterbelmont,2,Fri Jul 10 13:00:39 2015 UTC,"Seriously, people come here for help, and we're supposed to ban and chastise them? Get the hell out of here. The downvote button works fine for issues like there. Asking the mods to come in is unnecessary and whiny.  If this were a high traffic community and questions about The Last were regularly getting upvoted to the front page, that'd be different. But they aren't. There's no competition for space here, so people need to stop willfully getting offended."
Naruto,3csgp0,HokageEzio,0,Fri Jul 10 13:11:20 2015 UTC,"I'm gonna hit you with the flip side since you seem to think downvoting and moving on solves the problem.  It doesn't.  The downvote does not work for this question.  If we downvote the thread out of existence because we get annoyed by the question, and it's from some random person who never even touches the Naruto subreddit, what does that solve?  They just think they got downvoted for no reason.  It doesn't answer their question in the slightest.  So what are they gonna do, they're gonna try to ask it again.  Maybe they just had a tough crowd.    These people aren't entitled asking the mods for a better solution.  There needs to be a better solution, and the only ones who can implement that is the mods."
Naruto,3csgp0,hunterbelmont,5,Fri Jul 10 13:17:17 2015 UTC,"No, you're misunderstanding what the problem is. The problem is not you being annoyed by seeing people ask the question. The problem is the hypothetical front page space lost by the question being asked. You are not entitled to be protected from people asking where they can see the last. You aren't. If you're cruising the new section or are a part of a slow moving community, then you're going to see submissions you don't always think are worthwhile. There's only an issue if it gets upvoted to the top and pushes other content out, which it doesn't.   These people aren't entitled asking the mods for a better solution.   Yes, they are.   There needs to be a better solution   No, there doesn't. I've explained why there doesn't. This is a non-issue. There is no problem. You're making an issue where none exists."
Naruto,3csgp0,HokageEzio,0,Fri Jul 10 13:20:35 2015 UTC,"So you think answering a question everyday is not an issue, when there is a much simpler solution to just placing the answer right in front of them?  Cause I've been answering this question since last year.  And I didn't just start out getting annoyed by it, I answered it.  I shouldn't have to answer it every day.  I've done my part to be kind about it.  When there is a simple way to fix it, which is suitable for any person passing by, why not do it?"
Naruto,3csgp0,ohnoyouwont,4,Fri Jul 10 13:24:39 2015 UTC,"You don't have to answer the question. You can ignore it, downvote it, or ignore and downvote it. No one is paying you for this, so obviously, only be helpful as you please. I shouldn't have to tell you that some people like helping others and allowing them to get more immersed in a mutual hobby.  I seriously don't know how you people don't understand you're creating drama out of thin air. This happens on every slow moving subreddit everywhere. Every now and then, you guys get bored and want to have these come to Jesus talks about how the community needs to deal with a ""grave issue"". Just stop it already."
Naruto,3csgp0,hunterbelmont,2,Fri Jul 10 13:30:09 2015 UTC,"And if it's made simpler by putting a notification of it in plain sight, nobody will have to answer it.  Soooooo..."
Naruto,3csgp0,ohnoyouwont,5,Fri Jul 10 13:32:29 2015 UTC,"If mods want to put a reminder of the date of the BD release, fine. The question isn't always as simple as that anyway. Some people want to watch it right now and want to know the best subs to get. It's a pretty common question in the anime community.  We don't need mods autobanning questions or shaming people for just trying to get some help. This is a small, slow-moving community that has no need to be more exclusive with what kind of submissions are allowed. All you're doing is telling newcomers that we're a bunch of elitist jerks who think we're took important to be bothered by outsiders and their pleb questions."
Naruto,3csgp0,hunterbelmont,-1,Fri Jul 10 13:38:13 2015 UTC,That's why I said I would play devil's advocate instead of going full Hitler mode and saying ban all people who ask.

Naruto,3csgp0,Spartn90,3,Fri Jul 10 12:31:37 2015 UTC,How is it frustrating? In what way does it frustrate you? It doesn't take up space on the front page and it is easily ignored. It's not possible for this issue to frustrate you unless you're going out of your way to be offended.  Downvote and move on. Stop trying to create drama where none exists.

It's fine for mods to put a message up in the submission page, but going as far as to delete these questions as they come up is not what we need here.  There isn't an actually problem here.

Naruto,3csgp0,idontevenknowbrah,-3,Fri Jul 10 15:06:34 2015 UTC,"Forgive me for disagreeing with you! I was under the impression that I was entitled to my own opinion! I am now truly humbled by my ignorance!  Sure, you can make the argument that no one is directly affected by the question being spammed, but that doesn't mean it isn't annoying and unnecessary. You want to know how posts get out from the 'new' section and onto the front page of the subreddit? People frequently do go there and upvote/downvote posts, and seeing the same goddamn easily answered question over and over again after answering it over and over again can start to get a little irritating. It's an easily solved problem that does nothing but clutter up the 'new' section of the subreddit every day."
Naruto,3csgp0,hunterbelmont,4,Fri Jul 10 15:24:57 2015 UTC,"but that doesn't mean it isn't annoying and unnecessary   It does, actually. That is exactly what it means. It's like someone going out of his way to get hurt then calling the thing that hurt him a public danger.   seeing the same goddamn easily answered question over and over again after answering it over and over again can start to get a little irritating   No, it can't. There's no reason a rational, well-adjusted person should get annoyed at it. It's actually a little bit scary that you are.  I've seen this happen a thousand times before and it will continue to happen. People in small communities get bored and try to make issues out of innocuous things, so they can feel like they're improving things, when they really aren't. All you're doing is wasting everyone's time and making this subreddit more hostile and elitist.   It's an easily solved problem that does nothing but clutter up the 'new' section of the subreddit every day.    First off, there's no clutter in new. This subreddit is slow moving. Second, you're right, it is easily solved; just ignore it."

Naruto,3csgp0,animetheory,-1,Fri Jul 10 15:52:41 2015 UTC,You and I have very different definitions of the phrase 'entitled freak'. Mine is 'Someone who wants every single thing handed to them and is unreasonable about it'. Yours seems to be 'Anyone that disagrees with me'.  Any particular reason this issue gets you so riled up? You're kind of acting like a jerk all over this thread. People are allowed to have different opinions then you.
Naruto,3csgp0,idontevenknowbrah,0,Fri Jul 10 15:55:31 2015 UTC,What's the point of us talking if you're just going to ignore what I'm saying? I've explained to you multiple times how this is a non-issue. Questions about The Last are   Not shoved in your face. Not pushing content off the front page.   You can ignore them and live the exact same life you would live otherwise. You are not giving up an inch by having them stay there. They are not taking a crumb off your plate. You are an entitled freak by thinking that the rules should be changed so something that doesn't affect you goes away.
Naruto,3csgp0,animetheory,-3,Fri Jul 10 15:59:17 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying that the fate of the world hinges on this decision, as you seem to be implying. I'm saying that if the same question has been asked and answered literally over a hundred times with no signs of stopping, it should reach the point where the mods do something about it. Despite what your insults towards me claim, I'm not fuming or obsessed with this issue. I just love this subreddit, and while this may not be a massive issue, it's still one that can be fixed easily just by having a message easily viewable that answers the question. The frequent trolls and youtube spammers that have been showing up here lately are a minor problem as well; should we just ignore them too? Just because something isn't a world-ending issue doesn't mean it shouldn't be addressed."

Naruto,3cqjxu,Archimedes-,3,Thu Jul 9 23:46:11 2015 UTC,"I started watching Naruto last year when I was going through an awful phase of depression. I was so depressed that when I saw my little cousin watching a Naruto movie, I immediately sat beside him to watch it, and Sasuke and Kakashi piqued my interest. I decided on watching it from the start since I found it really pleasant and heartwarming. That's where the splendid journey began.  I finished watching part 1 in two weeks and read the manga in a month. I finished reading the manga right before the last exam of my finals and it was emotionally tormenting. But Naruto's ideologies turned into mine, and since then I have never been depressed about anything again. Naruto rescued me, and I am grateful to Masashi Kishimoto and the whole Naruto fandom for that!"

Orochimaru - it would be fun to pick his brain, we never really know what he's thinking. Hashirama - Did you see that story time?  He sounds like he could make a story of paint drying entertaining.  Plus his ideology is interesting.  I'd talk to him about just life in general probably. Tobirama - Again, interesting ideology.  I would want to know if say he blames the Uchiha for being cursed, or if he holds resentments for them after fighting them for so long as a kid. Danzo - One of the most complex characters in the series.  His methods, terrible.  But his message makes you think (kinda like Madara talking about hatred all these years).  He's just overall an interesting person to see what he's thinking, and why he thinks that way. Itachi - Probably just end up talking about peace and if he thinks it can truly be attained, or if ""chaos is the natural order"" like his fanboy believes."

I guess the conversations would be interesting, but I'd rather meet some of the more fun people:   Jiraiya - Provides both the serious conversations and the fun.  Naruto - Similar fun to Jiraiya, except less pervy and more goofy. He probably has a ton of good prank ideas.  Mei - Mei is bae. If I could be one character in the Narutoverse it would be Chojuro because he's close to Mei and is badass. Mei is just so cheerful and fun as opposed to the other Kages. Tobi / Guruguru - Not Obito, but the Zetsu Tobi. I would answer his questions about poop too. Real tho the Zetsu seem pretty cool."

I don't know how one would get it to recognize questions and not just reply to everything that has the word 'last' in it, but this would be pretty useful if it overcame this obstacle. I think a bot that answers all FAQ and deletes itself after a certain amount of downvotes might be ideal to make up for the misplaced posts."
Naruto,3cmq7l,irishsaltytuna,15,Thu Jul 9 05:00:07 2015 UTC,"/r/naruto is a community, and it is important that we're communal and friendly to newcomers and occasional visitors out of the loop.   At the same time though, it can be infuriating to see the same question asked again and again. Granted, some people wouldn't classify themselves as 'redditors', and would be unaware of/wouldn't use the search function, but still...Nonetheless, we should try to make an effort to put up with these posts, regardless of how testing they can be."
Naruto,3cmq7l,cloistered_around,1 point,Thu Jul 9 02:59:57 2015 UTC,Agreed. We do tend to try and be nice to newcomer questions... but gad if it doesn't wear on you seeing the exact same question asked every single day. Half the time the question is asked someone else already asked it not 7 hours earlier.  So it does get a bit hard to keep being polite about it.

Naruto,3cmq7l,HokageEzio,6,Thu Jul 9 04:10:05 2015 UTC,"I decided to play devil's advocate and try out the search. (Which I personally detest.) After some trial and error, I managed to find the aforementioned question from 5 days ago. So, I do see your point, but that's not necessarily my point. My point, as another redditor pointed out, is that we're a community. No matter who we are, what our individual lives are all about, we all came here because we all like Naruto.   It's about bonds. (lol.) If you think it's annoying, don't reply, or reply shortly. After all, same question, same answer, right? Some people are just downright rude though. Personally, I don't think the repetitive questions are doing much harm. Yes, they're always there, but I mean, so what? I look at the first 100 post on the sub and there's 1 post about when the movie comes out. Is that a good reason to leave the village and train under Orochimaru? I don't think so.   Obviously the last person around to ask the question wasn't around for the time before that. So they're either innocently ignorant, or really boring trolls. Peace is what the kages would've wanted."
Naruto,3cmq7l,KHlover,2,Thu Jul 9 04:37:28 2015 UTC,"As someone who frequents many subreddits, i do understand its a community. But its also a place for discussion, and constant reposts are just as bad as shitposts imo. Especially when they are easily avoided. Although i also dont think it would hurt to put something about it in the sidebar, or for the mods to make some stickied FAQ post."
Naruto,3cmq7l,13ig13oss,2,Thu Jul 9 04:49:47 2015 UTC,"As I said, I get your point. I also have to reiterate that I don't think this problem is going to stop. Especially when there's gonna be another movie where the same thing will happen. Unless the mods decide to start removing the posts or something, I think the best we can do is either be nice, don't reply, or reply shortly. I'm also not against downvoting the posts since they are just text posts, and as you said, basically daily reposts.   My main concern is the toxic attitude some people have towards obvious newcomers/lurkers and people that are out of the loop. Nobody's doing it on purpose. And I see you've been a redditor for over a year, you should know that people are prone to ignore the search bar. Long before you and I were around people still refused. It's one of those things that'll never change. And that isn't to say you're wrong, it's just that you're fighting an uphill battle by suggesting the search bar. People who are gonna do it, will do it. I personally prefer googling things if I'm trying to find a post on what I'm looking for."

Just imagine you were the strongest fighter, so strong that even the best fighters of their time couldn't touch you. People will still try to fight you but of course they fail every time and eventually you get really bored. Suddenly someone comes at you, after many many years and you can feel that he is good enough to actually hurt you if you are not careful.  Thats what Madara meant. He saw how powerful Guy is and is really looking forward to that challenge so he finally has to fight seriously again.

Naruto,3ckynr,The_Hippopotamoose,4,Thu Jul 9 05:40:15 2015 UTC,"No one can really say what constitutes an acceptable level of Naruto tattoos. Why should they only get the curse mark or a phrase if plenty of people already have this idea to begin with? Maybe 10-15 years ago this could be seen as too bold, but now when over a third of 18-25yr/o Americans have tattoos how can this be rationalized as a poor decision comparatively? By all means you’re allowed an opinion, please do as anyone is. Perhaps it’s that it’s not conservative enough for your own taste (or something else to justify) but you can’t say that this is over the top by today’s standards as matter-of-fact."
Naruto,3ckynr,123ebm,2,Thu Jul 9 00:27:03 2015 UTC,"Thank you for saying this. Tattoos are a personal choice, as are piercings and dying your hair funky colours. People gotta stop judging about that sort of thing!"
Naruto,3ckynr,The_Hippopotamoose,1 point,Thu Jul 9 01:36:41 2015 UTC,we're not saying it's a bad decision because it's a tattoo. It's a bad decision because it's chibi anime characters. In a super visible place
Naruto,3ckynr,brooksiepants,6,Sun Jul 12 02:41:45 2015 UTC,Well I wouldn't consider it an obsession because people usually have tattoos that's meaningful to them on themselves.
Naruto,3ckynr,erqq,1 point,Wed Jul 8 23:14:45 2015 UTC,"I get that Naruto is a cool show and all, but getting it tattooed on your body is implying that it is one of the most important and meaningful things in your life. Not your mother. Not your country. A cartoon. That just doesn't seem right.   I guess it's okay if you have a lot of tattoos and that's just one of them. But if that's your only tattoo or one of a few, then I don't think that's a very good idea at all."

Naruto,3cn4v4,MissplacedLandmine,3,Thu Jul 9 14:00:55 2015 UTC,That's a great idea. I believe CAC is the natural progression in anime based games once the main series has ended e.g. xenoverse. Multiplayer UNS style battles would be incredibly fun if they can make it run smoothly online too (which is also a flaw in xenoverse)
Naruto,3cn4v4,GuySchmuy,1 point,Thu Jul 9 10:57:15 2015 UTC,"You have the choice of being a regular ninja, a medical ninjutsu user (mainly), a kekkai genkai user, or a jinchuuriki.  how they would balance them but lets just say kekkai genkai and jinchuuriki start off weaker and get boss later on?  You gain jutsu as you go and your Chakra increases like Kai in DBX"
Naruto,3cn4v4,AustinRivers25,1 point,Sat Jul 11 05:49:53 2015 UTC,"I can see it!   Regular ninja: well balanced  medical ninjas: tanks and healers  kekkai : ninjutsu specialist  jinchuuriki : strong physical attacks and skills  These main types could branch out into more a specialised focus. for example regular nins could lvl up into puppet or ninja tools, weapon specialists.  what if every ninja has a minimum two nature types. These chakra nature type could influence your ninjutsu and compliment your play style as well serve as an advantage if your nature type happens to beat another player's type.   You could choose to focus on only one nature type if you wish or try to add another charkra nature to have very powerful skills but with a restricted range or high cooldown. (Excuse my rambling)"
Naruto,3cn4v4,GuySchmuy,1 point,Sat Jul 11 06:10:51 2015 UTC,"Yes!! I personally would have a Kekkai and a Jinchuuriki (with the 9Tails ofc).  I want finishers too, like say I hit you with a Rasengan and it kills you it triggers me using Kage Bunshin and using Massive Rasengan Barrage.  I also want to choose my chakra nature and it effects stuff like say you don't have Wind nature? You can only use Rasengan, have wind nature you gain access to Wind Style Rasen Shuriken (unlock it from Naruto as a master like in DBX)"
Naruto,3cn4v4,AustinRivers25,1 point,Sat Jul 11 06:19:06 2015 UTC,Love the idea of finishing combos. It would be pretty cool having all the naruto characters mentor you.

Definitely Kakashi and Sasuke (Chidori and advanced forms of Chidori).  Wind? Asuma and Naruto (Wind with your weapons and Rasenshirken).  Kurani for Genjutsu and Itachi for Sharingan users.

Neji- He died really heroicly and for the people who say his death was just to get NaruHina going they are really wrong . Also knowing that from the Konoha 11 he will be the only one who doesnt have a family wont be able to change the Hyuuga and so on makes it to damn sad . 3.Minato/Kushina- those final words form Kushina were heartbreaking . Even thou she was in 3/4 episodes you get really emotional , its was really well written .  Asuma- Really sad death , really sad way to die (him stopping to smoke because he has a child ),really sad funeral everything was made sad as fuck and his place on this list could be between 1 and 4 based on personal likes .  Pain almost killing Hinata was also really damn sad but the part that she didnt die ruined it . Its probably my one of my all time favourite episodes and tha post ending scene was just heartbreaking if you thought she was dead ."

I think the japanese actors convey the emotion in the voices better than in the english versions. Although that's not to say that the english version does a bad job, just that japanese is slightly better.   During the Pain invasion when sakura screams for naruto, the voice is much more powerful in the original japanese than in the english dub."

The sub version is good, but I like to watch the show and do other things, so having to keep my eyes fucking glued to the bottom to read what is being said can be quite troublesome. But I do enjoy the subbed episodes. It just took some getting used to I guess."
Naruto,3cnmdi,NorseWolves,2,Thu Jul 9 08:41:57 2015 UTC,"Agreed. No offense to Naruto, it's one of the best Animes I've ever seen, but the English voices have more variety unlike the Japanese voices, so it just makes more sense to me :)"
Naruto,3cnmdi,NorseWolves,4,Thu Jul 9 08:51:43 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I definitely have an easier time watching with the English voices, but it is so far behind, there is almost no choice."
Naruto,3cnmdi,Spartn90,3,Thu Jul 9 08:53:12 2015 UTC,"I just think a majority of the male voice actors sound too similar, maybe it was simply because I'm not used to them, but I watched a few episodes of shippuden, and at one point closed my eyes and could not differentiate the voices between Itachi, Jugo, and another character, I only watched the English version on Cartoon Network when it first started airing, until they repeated the Zabuza arc for the third time then switched over for some progression and never went back.  I also remember dreading Naruto's EVA."
Naruto,3cnmdi,Rosebunse,2,Thu Jul 9 14:56:50 2015 UTC,"Really, I think the only reason so many anime fans think the Japanese versions sound better is because they can't understand them. If they did, they'd see how bad the voice acting is. Not saying that the English dub is better...  Except for Orochimaru. Steve Blum knocked it out of the park on that one."
Naruto,3cnmdi,xlAnonym0uslx,2,Thu Jul 9 16:09:59 2015 UTC,"I feel like the emotion is portrayed better in Japanese and it's just weird hearing the Naruto dub knowing that he's voiced by a 50 year old woman(even if the Japanese dub is a 20 year old woman). And words like ""Dattebayo"" that don't really have an English translation are better kept in Japanese and not translated to crap like ""Believe it!"", which fortunately they stopped doing. I can't stop imagining those cringe videos of weeaboos at anime expos doing impersonations either..."
Naruto,3cnmdi,Rambro332,2,Fri Jul 10 09:20:25 2015 UTC,I can't stand half of the English voices. You're entitled to your opinion though. At least Naruto doesn't sound like a 10 year old in the Japanese version.

Naruto,3co0i0,Rosebunse,5,Thu Jul 9 16:36:22 2015 UTC,Probably the Uchiha. The third hokage and Jiriyai are the only ones capable of fighting Itachi and shisui. Shisui could recruit one of them with his MS ability as well. Obito could just about solo everyone himself Edit Tsnuade wouldn't do to bad herself. She could take some of the tops of the uchiha clan but Itachi and shisui stomp her.
Naruto,3co0i0,KingBonu77,4,Thu Jul 9 12:01:21 2015 UTC,Itachi wouldn't have Mangekyo.  That puts him way down on the list in power.  He'd be beaten.
Naruto,3co0i0,HokageEzio,2,Thu Jul 9 13:10:03 2015 UTC,Yeah I forgot about Itachi not having MS. He could fight and eventually lose or draw with. Kakashi at that point. Shisui is still a beast though. He is a master of the body flicker technique and his MS is god teir. If Shisui managed to manipulate someone powerful like Jiriyai then Id say it's all over for Konoha.
Naruto,3co0i0,KingBonu77,2,Thu Jul 9 13:15:44 2015 UTC,"Not sure why Itachi and Obito would support the Uchiha. Anyway,  whether or not Guy has mastered the Eight Gates could be the deciding factor.   Edit. The only chance the Uchiha have of winning is if they get to cast Koto on Guy, Hiruzen or Jiraiya.  And even then Konoha could still very well win."
Naruto,3co0i0,DoubleHunter,1 point,Thu Jul 9 12:21:43 2015 UTC,"This is true, considering that Obito had sided with Madara by this point. He no longer cared about the Uchiha."
Naruto,3co0i0,Rosebunse,1 point,Thu Jul 9 16:37:33 2015 UTC,I doubt guy had mastered them at that point. He would be an early jonin. He should be able to open a few like lee but all 8 I doubt. With 7 he could give Itachi a run for his money though.
Naruto,3co0i0,KingBonu77,3,Thu Jul 9 12:25:34 2015 UTC,I'd say that Itachi without his  Mangekyo Sharingan would stand no chance against him.
Naruto,3co0i0,DoubleHunter,1 point,Thu Jul 9 12:30:48 2015 UTC,Oh yeah I forgot Itachi wasn't at his peak. If shisui wasn't dead then Itachi is without his MS and is severely weaker. Yeah guy would probably beat him then
Naruto,3co0i0,KingBonu77,2,Thu Jul 9 12:33:31 2015 UTC,"Well, if my memory serves correctly, You'd have Jiraiyai, Tsunade, Danzo, Kakashi, Yamato and the Third Hokage to protect the village. Itachi would most likely not side with the Uchiha. Obito would most likely be out of the picture as well depending on what time the event happened as well.   I'd be willing to put my money on Konoha. You have to think that at around this time, the only really prominent Uchiha that we know of were Shisui and Itachi... and those two weren't really supportive of the Uchiha's uprising.   Jiraiya could most likely take out the majority of the Uchiha at that time by himself, and if he couldn't Sarutobi definitely could have. People tend to forget that Sarutobi was one hell of a Hokage, a master of all the elemental types AND he took on both of his predecessors at once (even if they were edo-tensei'd in sub par jutsu level).   Also, by this time I believe Kakashi and Yamato are at least Jonin level, the fourth Hokage would have been dead. Shisui and that all started right around the time Sasuke was 4-6 years old. Kakashi would still have MS. Yamato would still be able to deal massive damage."
Naruto,3co0i0,BigTayTay,1 point,Thu Jul 9 12:39:12 2015 UTC,Pretty sure Tsunade was gone by the time of the Uchiha unrest.
Naruto,3co0i0,night4345,1 point,Thu Jul 9 12:41:46 2015 UTC,"Well so was Obito, but this is theoretical right? I'm sure Tsunade wouldn't say ""Fuck Konoha"" if she got wind of it being attacked."
Naruto,3co0i0,BigTayTay,2,Thu Jul 9 12:43:30 2015 UTC,She didn't give a shit when Orochimaru attacked the village and killed her teacher. Obito was there during that time.
Naruto,3co0i0,night4345,2,Thu Jul 9 12:49:20 2015 UTC,Touche sir....touche. I totally forgot about the whole Orochimaru thing. :/ That was so long ago ah the memories....
Naruto,3co0i0,BigTayTay,1 point,Thu Jul 9 12:52:34 2015 UTC,"Yamato is pretty young, he would be around jonin level. Kakashi can't use MS. He learned his to use it during the part 1-2 timeskip."
Naruto,3co0i0,KingBonu77,1 point,Thu Jul 9 12:49:03 2015 UTC,"He awoke it when Rin was killed... they showed it. So at around the time of this theoretical event, he'd have MS. The Uchiha uprising took place about 12-13 years before Naruto fought Kaguya."
Naruto,3co0i0,BigTayTay,2,Thu Jul 9 12:51:12 2015 UTC,He unlocked it but collapsed shortly after. He wasn't aware of having it. That's why he never used it in part 1.
Naruto,3co0i0,KingBonu77,1 point,Thu Jul 9 12:53:43 2015 UTC,"Okay, fair enough. Even so, the whole collapsing of power overload would apply to Shisui and Itachi. Itachi at this point wouldn't have MS, and Shisui could barely sustain his Susanoo. The rest of the Uchiha clan most likely hadn't awoken even the full extent of their regular sharignans."
Naruto,3co0i0,BigTayTay,1 point,Thu Jul 9 12:56:13 2015 UTC,Itachi won't be that effective. Shisui and Obito are gonna be the real threats for Konoha. Yeah most of the uchiha clan are normal shinobi or slightly better.
Naruto,3co0i0,KingBonu77,2,Thu Jul 9 12:59:20 2015 UTC,"It seems like everyone is forgetting about the Hyuga and ANBU Root. Hyuga is a highly respected clan in Konoha, and we dont even know what kind of shinobi Danzo could be breeding in Root at this time (like yamato). I'd say 100% win Konoha!"
Naruto,3co0i0,sinnedal,1 point,Thu Jul 9 19:06:11 2015 UTC,"If you're asking if they attacked during the coup, Konoha.  One, Obito would never just randomly side with the Uchiha during that time.  But I digress.  Itachi would not have Susano, he wouldn't even have Mangekyo.  That automatically nerfs them tremendously.  Shisui can be taken by a lot of the higher ups.  And Obito, if he for some random ass reason joined in, could be handled by people like Kakashi with a team, Hiruzen, Jiraiya with Sage Mode, etc.  He's in for a rough ride, and he'd basically have to solo.  The rest of the Uchiha are just normal people.  They can last a little while, but they aren't gonna win.  There was just no way of them coming out on top of it."
Naruto,3co0i0,HokageEzio,1 point,Thu Jul 9 13:09:08 2015 UTC,Obito could solo pretty much everyone.  Obito is the strongest akatsuki member.  And the 3rd was having trouble with orochimaru...  Were as pain destroyed him without much effort.   Kakashi can barley use kamui at this  point.  And it took minato  FTG Lvl 2 to make him retreat.  Jiraya with his vast knowledge would be a threat.    I give this to the uchiha.  Obito has one of the strongest/op/hack abilities in the entire show....  Only space time justsu can stop him and taijutsu.  Gai at that point is undetermined in skill level.
Naruto,3co0i0,Zelhard,0,Thu Jul 9 20:53:12 2015 UTC,what is kohoha ?
Naruto,3co0i0,no_tourist,0,Thu Jul 9 12:16:18 2015 UTC,The hidden leaf village. I think konoha translates into the village hidden in the leafs
Naruto,3co0i0,KingBonu77,1 point,Thu Jul 9 12:18:39 2015 UTC,"ohhhh koNOha .... ok but konoha is not a clan , its a vilage , and uchiha clan is part of konohakagure ... so did op mean uchiha vs the rest of the village ? konoha has a lot of clans in it (like hyuga , uzumaki , uchiha , hatake , etc)....  but theres are a lot of powerfull ninjas not belonging to the uchiha clan like  Sarutobi , the 3 legendary sanin  (jiraya , orochimaru and tsunade), the uzumaki clan , the senju clan (hashirama and tobirama) , even hanzo was very powerfull , and dont forget KABUTO thats for all effects is from kohona...."
Naruto,3co0i0,no_tourist,1 point,Thu Jul 9 12:28:11 2015 UTC,Yeah The uchiha vs the rest of the village. OP meant at a specific time period. When the uchiha clan was planning to revolt. Most of the villages strongest shinobi aren't alive at this point.
Naruto,3co0i0,KingBonu77,1 point,Thu Jul 9 12:32:27 2015 UTC,"hanzo and sarutobi evn though rivals , they were alsovery powerfulll ... Hiruzen Sarutobi was a powerful ninja, hailed as a ""God of Shinobi"". remember when he faced orochimaru and the edo tensei tobirama and hashirama senju .During his life, he was regarded as the strongest Hokage in Konoha's history,[6] and the most powerful of the Five Kage.["
Naruto,3co0i0,no_tourist,0,Thu Jul 9 13:14:49 2015 UTC,"The third is good, but He's not in his prime though. He's still really powerful but he's not 'God of shinobi' powerful.  Keep in mind hashirama and tobirama were severely nerfed during the fight against the third. Compared to what we later see him do hashirama was joking around. Tobirama didn't even use FTG arguably his most powerful jutsu."
Naruto,3co0i0,KingBonu77,0,Thu Jul 9 13:20:55 2015 UTC,"Konoha, Jiraiya could solo itachi, Danzo would solo Shisui like he did when he took his eye, Obito would be a problem with his eye ability but then again Kakashi is there for the counter kamui."
Naruto,3co0i0,Wraxu,0,Thu Jul 9 12:33:17 2015 UTC,Danzo vs shisui was filler. We can't assume that's what happened since it wasn't in the manga. Kakashi can't use kamui at this point. He learns to use it during the part 1-2 timeskip
Naruto,3co0i0,KingBonu77,3,Thu Jul 9 12:36:00 2015 UTC,"Filler or not, Danzo ended up taking his eye defeating the young Shuisui, let's not forget 3rd is still there to protect the village."
Naruto,3co0i0,Wraxu,0,Thu Jul 9 12:40:11 2015 UTC,The third is old. Granted he's still incredibly powerful but Obito would dispatch of him swiftly. Obito could easily teleport behind enemy lines and kill the third without much difficulty and ruin the leafs chain of command.  Who says Danzo was alone though? Knowing him he probably had an army with him. Also considering Shisui didn't use his MS he obviously held back. Shisui going all out could beat just about anyone because of how OP his MS is.

Naruto,3cneta,Gundam336,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:07:23 2015 UTC,You just finished up season 12 that means you can go from episode 276 to 309 which is 33 more episodes....... then you play the waiting game
Naruto,3cneta,Neural_groove,2,Thu Jul 9 07:20:55 2015 UTC,This may seem like a stupid question but has either the non dubbed series or the manga reached the end?
Naruto,3cneta,Neural_groove,1 point,Thu Jul 9 07:25:57 2015 UTC,"The manga reached its last chapter a few months ago with chapter 700. There was an epilogue series called ""gaiden"" which ended last week with a total of 10 chapters.   The subbed anime isn't done just yet. It's getting close though."
Naruto,3cneta,HokageEzio,2,Thu Jul 9 07:30:56 2015 UTC,is there any estimates on when the dubbed will be finished?
Naruto,3cnd4t,SpencerjW346,12,Thu Jul 9 06:29:23 2015 UTC,"Interesting comparisons. As a huge DC fan I'll give a bit of input. The ones you put forward made a ton of sense, so we will go with those to start off  Kakashi - Batman (skilled, keeps his face hidden, dark past, not as powerful as his peers)  Tsunade - Wonder Woman (a physical powerhouse, and the only female on the team)  Minato - The Flash (serious, but with a jokey personality. specialty is speed)  Tobirama - Aquaman (one of his specialties is water. a very serious disposition)  Now I will go with who is left.  Naruto - Superman (a heros personality, and the most powerful)  Hashirama - Martian Manhunter (his wood abilities remind me of Manhunters shapeshifting, and he is probably the 2nd most powerful, and more than a match for Superman)  Hiruzen - Green Lantern (doesnt really fit, but he is the only one left haha,)"
Naruto,3cnd4t,noj776,4,Thu Jul 9 08:33:52 2015 UTC,"Yea that's how I saw them too. I really like Lord 1st and picture him as Superman, but I know that Naruto just is the most powerful, and he just feels more like Superman since he can fly and all that.   Lord 3rd I feel kinda does fit GL because he has every chakra nature and knows a ton of jutsu, GL's power is only limited by his imagination so I guess they can fit that way?"
Naruto,3cnd4t,Neural_groove,5,Thu Jul 9 09:04:40 2015 UTC,This is a pretty strange analogy. But if you wanna play this game then naruto is most definitely superman.
Naruto,3cnd4t,pezmez,1 point,Thu Jul 9 07:25:36 2015 UTC,naruto superman  kakashi GL  Hiruzen batman  Minato the flash  Hashirama Martian Manhunter  Tobirama Aquaman  Tsunade wonder woman

Naruto,3cnd4t,RobotSnake,2,Thu Jul 9 08:40:25 2015 UTC,"Naruto has his own kids, so I'm guessing Himawari would be Supergirl."

Naruto,3cnd4t,yaasssss,-5,Thu Jul 9 21:54:58 2015 UTC,Isn't aquaman supposed to be useless?
Naruto,3cnd4t,rokudaimehokage,4,Thu Jul 9 08:12:24 2015 UTC,"No. He's as bulletproof as Superman, strong as I dunno Spider-Man? (Strong enough to knockout a t rex with one kick), can speed dial a herd of sharks, and he can use magic of sorts."
Naruto,3cnd4t,WhereIsMyManatee,3,Thu Jul 9 08:34:21 2015 UTC,"He's not bulletproof, but they only really scratch him a bit. He's way stronger than Spiderman in that he can lift cruise liners (which way 100,000+ tons) and he can block the same attack that sunk Atlantis.  He's very powerful, but closer to Iron Man than he is Superman."
Naruto,3cnd4t,rokudaimehokage,1 point,Thu Jul 9 10:13:16 2015 UTC,So he's like Goku pre DBZ. At least with the bullet stuff.
Naruto,3ci16f,xFluffDawg,140,Wed Jul 8 01:50:01 2015 UTC,I wonder how much shit would have been avoided if he didn't pretty much encourage Sasuke to become a psychopath.
Naruto,3ci16f,Rambro332,51,Wed Jul 8 02:13:47 2015 UTC,"This is why the narrative of Itachi having such a great master plan never resonated with me. He tortured a young child for the mental equivalent of 6 days for basically no reason. And did it in the most traumatic way possible. Hell, Itachi is responsible for turning Sasuke into the avenging psycho who almost destroyed the world."
Naruto,3ci16f,InvaderDJ,9,Wed Jul 8 11:48:10 2015 UTC,"If Sasuke didn't have revenge to live for, what else would he have? Sasuke only had his family and idolized his brother, he didn't have an identity outside of them when he was a child. If Sasuke didn't have a strong purpose to live after the massacre, then he would've either killed himself or been lost in insanity.    One of the earliest and most prominent themes was what happens to someone who has no reason to live. Haku was a disposable minion  who didn't have an identity outside of his master, same with Kimmimaro. Gaara was a tragic monster who couldn't end his own life and found an identity in killing others. Sasuke living for vengeance did undoubtedly warp his psyche, but there was no way it wouldn't be after having his entire family massacred."
Naruto,3ci16f,Brothaniels,1 point,Thu Jul 9 01:05:23 2015 UTC,I mean so was naruto but naruto overcame having nothing to live for and became awesome.
Naruto,3ci16f,timidman,12,Thu Jul 9 03:17:22 2015 UTC,I think this was an overestimization on Itachi's part. I'm pretty sure Sasuke would have wanted revenge without the torture.
Naruto,3ci16f,NJDCat,46,Wed Jul 8 16:17:21 2015 UTC,"Yeah, no kidding. Was Itachi worried that Sasuke was just gonna look at his parents freshly killed corpses and think ""Nah, it's cool Itachi. Ya win some, ya lose some."""

Naruto,3ci16f,thehippykid,9,Wed Jul 8 19:25:57 2015 UTC,"It's not the ""master plan"" that makes Itachi so awesome, It's the fact that he did what he thought was right and selfless and in the end was even able to admit that he was wrong. He saw his own faults not just those around him."
Naruto,3ci16f,TyFenrir,8,Wed Jul 8 20:37:47 2015 UTC,"That's true, but holy crap was he wrong. He could have simply told Sasuke exactly what he did and why and there's a good chance Sasuke wouldn't have done what he did."
Naruto,3ci16f,InvaderDJ,3,Wed Jul 8 22:25:48 2015 UTC,"He couldn't tell anyone why he did it, it's his duty to the village or something"
Naruto,3ci16f,123ebm,3,Wed Jul 8 23:28:23 2015 UTC,"Such a stupid reason. Hindsight is 20/20 and all that, but really telling Sasuke or even the whole village would have been much less damaging overall than what Itachi did."
Naruto,3ci16f,InvaderDJ,4,Wed Jul 8 23:35:23 2015 UTC,"but by keeping it a secret, itachi was able to infiltrate the akatsuki and keep the leaf village, and naruto, safe from them."

Naruto,3ci16f,demonkobra,-7,Wed Jul 8 17:54:25 2015 UTC,"nope, swapping brothers eye didnt work if you remember Itachi's speech about EMS. Itachi had to increase the strength of Sasuke's chakra to reach Madara's level and the best power up an Uchiha can hope for is Indra's curse. were not sure what Itachi knew but IMO I dont think he knew about Indra but he did have clues to Madara's true power"
Naruto,3ci16f,tbarranger47,0,Wed Jul 8 18:31:56 2015 UTC,I dropped the manga for a while after Itachi's bullshit 'plan' was revealed. It was just a way for Kishi to keep Sasuke in the DARKNESS and away from Team 7 and thereby extend the life of the manga.

Naruto,3ci16f,dynrte,16,Wed Jul 8 16:04:10 2015 UTC,"You can blame Obito all you like, I am not going to say you are wrong in blaming him, but I believe you are discrediting Madara a great deal here. Madara could have grabbed any Uchiha out there with good potential—as I am sure there were many—but you kind of have to choose an Uchiha child for a few reasons.  Children are naturally easier to manipulate than adults. In Obito's case, he was still very innocent which made him all the more easier to manipulate. Madara needed to make Obito see the world as a living hell, and he succeeded tremendously. Props to Madara for pulling the strings on that one. When you go through psychological trauma as Obito did, it's going to be easy to capitalize on that psychological trauma and manipulate him into doing your bidding.  Furthermore, I feel that people discredit the trauma that Obito went through. Rin wasn't just a girl Obito had a crush on, Rin was really the closest thing Obito had to ""real love"". Rin genuinely cared about him, and growing up without parents is really hard on you. It's natural he would fall in love with her. And then when the one person who you felt really mattered dies in front of your eyes... and you're a child, you aren't going to be able to cope with that very well, especially if you have a psychopath grooming and manipulating you to turn into a psychopath yourself.  I honestly feel like if any normal person went through what Obito did, including the Madara manipulation, they would be driven to insanity far beyond that of Obito's. This doesn't mean anything he did was right. It was all wrong, but you have to understand what happened to Obito was really fucked up.  As such, I give more credit to Madara for all the bullshit Obito pulled than Obito himself. After fucking up Obito's life, Obito then went on to see all the absolute shit in the shinobi world which only reconfirmed that life was hell. He saw all the bullshit that the Hidden Rain went through, he saw all the bullshit in Kirigakure (which started BEFORE his ""death"" as Zabuza and Mei going through the Bloody Mist exams proves) and probably many more things.  So if you want to blame anyone, blame Madara and the shinobi system. Obito is very much so a product of the cruel shinobi society, and while you cannot justify Obito's actions at all, you have to understand what led to Obito's downfall."
Naruto,3ci16f,Stretch127,6,Wed Jul 8 09:03:38 2015 UTC,I just caught up on the anime after finishing the manga last year. During the flashbacks im like damn she is supportive of him.

Naruto,3ci16f,hunterbelmont,1 point,Wed Jul 8 20:16:35 2015 UTC,"Obito isn't even in the Top Five when it comes to tragic lives in the series. Kakashi had it way worse than him, and he never wavered.  But I could have forgiven Obito if he had done a 180 and made some humble sacrifice after he died. But he doesn't. Even after he becomes ""good"", he still acts like a jerk, then he gets to the afterlife and says, ""Hey Rin, I saved Kakashi, because I didn't want him to come here and ruin our special alone time"". It's disgusting.  Compare Obito to Nagato. Nagato had to go through several lifetimes worth of tragedy to finally break, and when he got TnJ'd into becoming good, you got a sense of true regret from him. And even when Nagato was evil, he wasn't backstabbing and manipulating people left and right; he was straight forward about his intentions."

And we dont really konw the time between when he meet Jiraya and killed that shinobi that tried to kill Yahiko , and im guessing that was like some days after he met Jiraya , so probably Jiraya didnt pay attention ."
Naruto,3cnohu,Thatguy69Kappa,3,Thu Jul 9 09:19:57 2015 UTC,"Actually, when Nagato was first introduced as a child during his flashback speech towards Naruto, we see that his hair covers his eyes. After the death of his parents by Konoha ninja, it appears that he ""awakened"" his rinnegan, when in truth he's always had it. From then on, for the entirety of the series he has never once switched off the rinnegan. His true eyes forever lost. It also appears all those who have the rinnegan can't switch it off."

Naruto,3cmlsm,Drikani,1 point,Thu Jul 9 06:32:44 2015 UTC,I tried google translate but it went horribly wrong. It wouldn't do the story any justice if i read it like that. thank you though. it did seem like it would have been interesting!
Naruto,3cmlsm,Drikani,1 point,Thu Jul 9 06:43:50 2015 UTC,I would like to translate this story but neither do I have the permission to do so because I can not contact the writer nor do I have the time at the moment because I do write my own fanfic and I want it to be finished :D
Naruto,3cmlsm,Drikani,1 point,Thu Jul 9 10:19:34 2015 UTC,whats the fanfic you are writing?
Naruto,3cn00t,753509274761453,7,Thu Jul 9 04:13:18 2015 UTC,"I'd say the hidden cloud might've, since the majority of their more prominent figures, such as the Raikage and Bee are adept in fast and strong attacks."
Naruto,3cn00t,Ultimatenut,3,Thu Jul 9 04:26:55 2015 UTC,"Besides the Raikage and 5 gates Guy, I don't think anybody else could've dealt with Pain besides Naruto. Also keep in mind that a lot more people would've died if Tsunade didn't save them, and a lot of people STILL died with her protection. Pain's major weakness is Taijutsu and most of the kage are good at Ninjutsu. If she wasn't focused on healing, Tsunade might have been able to handle most of the paths, but I don't know how she could've gotten past universal pull/almighty push.    Ohnoki might be able to counter universal pull/almighty push with his flying, give flying to his subordinates, and can punch things with a stone fist."
Naruto,3cn00t,thesagem,2,Thu Jul 9 05:54:35 2015 UTC,"Hidden Cloud could hold themselves. They got the Fourth Raikage, Bee, Darui, and that dude who has the rubber jutsu. They have the highest chance of stopping Pain.   Hidden Stone, don't really know the have Ohnoki, and the two other people that were with him in the Kage Summit. I Think they could handle Pain, but in the end they would lose.  Hidden Sand only has the three siblings, and they aren't that much compared to Pain, so they would lose.  Hidden Mist we haven't seen that many people, all they have is Mei, the last Swordsman, and the dude with the Byakugan. They most certainly will lose.  All in all Leaf and Cloud stand the best chance because of the people they have, but Cloud will suffer more deaths because they don't have Tsunade nor Naruto's TNJ."
Naruto,3cn00t,KMKOmega,-1,Thu Jul 9 15:10:29 2015 UTC,"Honestly, it's gonna sound like I'm hating, but the world building is too poor for a legitimate answer. I don't think the sand could've taken it though. Wouldn't that shit just be collapsed sand once shit hit the fan? How many people have been shown to actually control sand, cuz I can only remember Gaara. I think Gaara could've put up a decent fight, but if you're talking about the structural integrity of the village, it would be fucked after 1 or 2 attacks."
Naruto,3cn00t,RoseBladePhantom,-4,Thu Jul 9 04:41:32 2015 UTC,"Naruto wasnt saved for last because of the statue overflowing with chakra. That ""statue"" is designed to hold thd chakra of all the tailed beasts, so it wouldnt overflow from the 9 tails. The only reason Pain didnt come for Naruto first is because if he did, the series would have been a lot shorter. With that said, i think the 5 main villages would probably all handle Pain's assault as well as Konoha. After all, they are supposed to be equally powerful."
Naruto,3cn00t,papa_smurphy,3,Thu Jul 9 04:24:59 2015 UTC,"The akatsuki did try to get naruto sooner. They tried twice. They sent their strongest team - kisame and itachi. Unfortunately for them, they never knew that itachi was a double agent and only pretended to fail to capture the nine tails. Both times, itcahi convinced kisame that they wouldn't be able to take on the enemy and fled."
Naruto,3cn00t,Neural_groove,5,Thu Jul 9 07:51:58 2015 UTC,"Naruto wasnt saved for last because of the statue overflowing with chakra.   Yeah, he was."
Naruto,3cn00t,knight504,1 point,Thu Jul 9 04:41:10 2015 UTC,The link you posted literally contradicts what you said
Naruto,3cn00t,valyriandirewolf,0,Thu Jul 9 13:17:48 2015 UTC,"Naruto was saved for the last because of the statue. Kisame says the Nine-Tails has to be sealed last or the statue would break.   I'm not seeing the problem, unless we're being really specific about the wording since the statue ""overflowing with chakra"" is implied rather than stated."
Naruto,3cn00t,knight504,-2,Thu Jul 9 17:13:47 2015 UTC,"Well he does say ""or so our leader said"" implying that is most likely not the whole truth. And we do know they werent sealed completely in order because at least one had been sealed before Garaa i believe."
Naruto,3cn00t,papa_smurphy,1 point,Thu Jul 9 04:46:04 2015 UTC,Which doesn't make it untrue since there's no evidence against it and it was really just a way of telling us that the information came from their leader himself. Two were sealed before they even attempted to capture Gaara which means that the order was never numerical.

Naruto,3ck3zw,3mn_,25,Wed Jul 8 15:12:12 2015 UTC,"I would assume it is difficult or dangerous to use. For example, Minato taught it to some ninjas but, it took like 3 or 4 ninja to teleport one ninja."
Naruto,3ck3zw,Awesomeana12,2,Wed Jul 8 15:43:49 2015 UTC,"This.  Also, not all shinobi are talented at space-time ninjutsu.  I actually imagine that Ten-Ten could be quite talented in it, but decided to focus on ninja tools."
Naruto,3ck3zw,feralstank,28,Thu Jul 9 04:17:52 2015 UTC,"since only 2 people know the technique my guess is there is a little more to it than just a jutsu formula, i mean the only two that used it were both Hokages."
Naruto,3ck3zw,KingZeonidas,20,Wed Jul 8 15:40:56 2015 UTC,You forgot the Hokage Guard Platoon. And it required all three members of the squad to use the technique.
Naruto,3ck3zw,notresponding98,7,Wed Jul 8 16:39:26 2015 UTC,I was about to point this out as well.  Someone at Hokage level could only go as far as getting 3 non-Hokage level people to work together to do it themselves. And those 3 elite jounin had to work hard to manage that.   That makes it apparent that the Flying Thunder God technique is quite a bit more complicated to implement than its end result.
Naruto,3ck3zw,sugatooth,-3,Wed Jul 8 17:25:14 2015 UTC,None of them were jounin.
Naruto,3ck3zw,rkellyturbo,3,Wed Jul 8 21:40:38 2015 UTC,"Fairly sure they were the same jounin that got ambushed by the sound 4 in the ""Rescue Sasuke"" arc of Part 1. Also, why would the Hokage have a personal guard of ninja that weren't at least jounin?"
Naruto,3ck3zw,sugatooth,1 point,Wed Jul 8 22:10:27 2015 UTC,"They are the ones who fought the Sound Four, but they weren't jounin except Shizune. Genma and Raido are tokubetsu jounin and Iwashi is a chuunin. They were chosen as the Hokage's bodyguards because that's their specialty."
Naruto,3ck3zw,rkellyturbo,1 point,Wed Jul 8 22:35:39 2015 UTC,"I stand corrected haha. Forgot that specialized jounin were a thing, too."
Naruto,3ck3zw,sugatooth,-1,Wed Jul 8 22:38:05 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but do remember, or go back, I rewatched that ep yesterday, they said it takes the three of them because is a very complex technique and requires a lot of chakra. And they did not get to learn it entirely from Minato. I mean, they don't have the complete technique mastered."
Naruto,3ck3zw,maurodsimone,8,Wed Jul 8 18:20:47 2015 UTC,"Similar to how hard it was to master the rasengan because it needed the proper amount of chakra, shape manipluation and power, maybe the 4th's technique is far too advanced of a jutsu for regular ninjas to master. His bodyguards are able to use it but only a toned down version of it and it requires more than 1 person. Tobirama invented the technique and Minato refined and improved it and made it his own, both were extremely intelligent and Minato was a prodigy."
Naruto,3ck3zw,Wraxu,5,Wed Jul 8 15:46:37 2015 UTC,"Pretty sure they just can't due to the difficulty, as others have said. It's an S-rank technique!"
Naruto,3ck3zw,_lanyi,5,Wed Jul 8 15:59:46 2015 UTC,Hard to learn.  Like any S ranked jutsu.

Naruto,3ck3zw,Hamurasage,2,Wed Jul 8 19:08:42 2015 UTC,"It's a space-time ninjutsu which is very dangerous and requires alot of hard work. Even MS Kamui, which is also a space-time ninjutsu/dojutsu requires alot of effort and chakra, just remember how Kakashi was struggling to actually control the Kamui and his chakra + strength was depleting instantly. Pretty sure Tobirama and Minato worked their asses off to even master it at that level, even Minato's bodyguards must have taken ages to actually complete their formation jutsu and they ""must"" be at their limits too but it wasn't really mentioned that they can or can't do more Flying Thunder Formation Technique."
Naruto,3ck3zw,izn1337,3,Wed Jul 8 16:14:38 2015 UTC,"Kakashi's MS was so costly because he isn't an Uchiha, it wasn't his eye and MS increases the depletion of Chakra."
Naruto,3ck3zw,night4345,2,Wed Jul 8 16:50:05 2015 UTC,"Pretty much everyone uses the lite version - the body flicker technique. Only those two (that I've seen) can use Flying Raijin.  In addition to all the stuff about it being really hard to master and use effectively, remember that high-level jutsu are all supposed to be like, secret, and a lot of them are hereditary. You can't just go to the library and check out ""Flying Raijin for Dummies"" or ""The Idiot's Guide to Rasengan."""
Naruto,3ck3zw,snarkhunter,1 point,Wed Jul 8 17:36:49 2015 UTC,"Body flicker isn't a spacetime technique. Kawarami may or may not be, though."
Naruto,3ck3zw,GaBeRockKing,1 point,Wed Jul 8 19:47:35 2015 UTC,"Yeah i meant ""lite"" as in ""similar effect"". Kind of like how anyone can use clone jutsu, it was the graduating exam at the academy. But shadow clone is pretty high level, and even someone like Kakashi can't use it as well as Naruto.  Really good parallel, i think. I like how both Naruto and Minato base their fighting style around a single, simple, flexible technique."
Naruto,3ck3zw,snarkhunter,1 point,Wed Jul 8 21:28:06 2015 UTC,Actually this is explained by Minatos old Hokage guards when they were transporting Mei to the battlefield. Minato himself tried to teach them the technique but it still required three people to perform.

She thank me for always being there even though she would behave in such a way that was not deserving of that. And she gave me an answer that was pretty much like the answer Sasuke gives to Naruto.

I know some of my friends have told me that Naruto is overrated or too corny but I never felt that way. There's enough great dramas in entertainment that, for me, it's a genuine relief to be able to sit and watch a show that's silly, dramatic and inspirational all rolled into one. Naruto makes me cry. It makes me laugh. It reminds me to never give up. It makes me try harder to be a better person. The themes of the show encourage me to never give up and to always be there for my friends. I love disappearing into the Naruto-world and being able to relate to the challenges of the characters who are all trying to be the best they can be. Yes, the filler got too crazy and yes, there were a couple of storylines that might have been done better... but it always tried to stay true to its themes. And underneath all that filler and flashback excess was and is a whole lotta heart."

He has a crap ton more abilities but that's the basic of what the akatski knew about"

Naruto,3cja5m,swarbles,-1,Wed Jul 8 16:54:31 2015 UTC,"well to be fair, Kishi has plenty of assistants that could probably continue to replicate his art style. Just need a new author."
Naruto,3cja5m,kannoneer,1 point,Wed Jul 8 14:58:49 2015 UTC,"I don't think it would be just that easy to find a worthy replacement for Kishi, it takes a lot to create such a great story, and every author has different beliefs, convictions and techniques, so that would inevitably transfer to the work, and thus it would not be the same work anymore, it would be elaborate fanfiction at best."
Naruto,3cja5m,swarbles,3,Wed Jul 8 16:25:34 2015 UTC,"American comics do this every few years. This is not a weird concept - finding new authors and artists to draw the same basic world. Young adult stories are not that thematically complex - Naruto, thematically, is a pretty simple manga. What separates it from other works is the world building that has gone along with it - there are virtually no mangas that create as complete of a independent fantasy world as Naruto does. From this world, thousands of stories can be told. They don't all have to utilize the same tropes and characterizations as Kishi used, and in fact, having a different author tell a entirely separate story would add depth to the fantasy world, not detract from it.  The only difference between ""elaborate fanfiction"" and actual new manga is it being officially distributed. For example, much of the later Dragon Ball content (especially the anime-only stuff) was not directly created by Akira, but rather by those in his studio. He obviously had a hand in design/storyline, but not to the extent he had in the early series.  edit For clarity, things that could be told without trampling on the sanctity of the original series: Itachi's story, Minato's story, stories from other villages. Something set in the future. Even a Boruto/Sarada story has openly endless possibilities: We've already seen the Uchiha/Senju dynamic played out on a large stage. A new story, even with recurring characters, would mandate a new set of thematic components and an entirely different storyline."
Naruto,3cja5m,kannoneer,1 point,Wed Jul 8 17:11:59 2015 UTC,"You're right, it could work.  But still, whether it was better or worse than the original, it would never be the original, and that can't be changed.  I honestly don't think it could be done a lot better, but of course, I might be wrong there, but as long as the original stands there, well-done and unchanged, I'm happy. If someone wants to build on that, sure, go ahead, it might be even better than the original, but one would have to do really well in this case to surpass it."
Naruto,3cja5m,swarbles,2,Wed Jul 8 22:54:06 2015 UTC,"I think what would be important is allowing it to stand on it's own. By any measure, Naruto is one of the greatest mangas ever. I think the value of having a new author come in would be that we could get something unique - still in the same universe, but very different, so that it wouldn't just be the same thing all over again.  I agree that it would be very hard to surpass it, but even coming relatively close would certainly be good enough for me!"

Naruto,3clufo,bootynuggets,0,Wed Jul 8 22:40:37 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure about it, I think Itachi was a little bit too brutal with Kakashi and the other Joning during their fight."
Naruto,3clufo,volt16,8,Thu Jul 9 09:44:58 2015 UTC,I believe he said in an interview that at first all he knew was Sasuke had a brother who did something bad. But by the time of Itachi's full debut he had decided Itachi was secretly a good guy.
Naruto,3clufo,rkellyturbo,3,Wed Jul 8 23:14:24 2015 UTC,"Reading/watching Sasuke's past (via flashbacks from his first fight against Naruto in the Valley of the End), you can see that Fugaku held certain expectations of Itachi. Expectations that at the time, seemed very enigmatic. However, now that we know the truth, the conversations with Fugaku and Itachi should make much more sense.  http://mangasee.co/manga/?series=Naruto&chapter=220&index=1&page=16  http://mangasee.co/manga/?series=Naruto&chapter=220&index=1&page=17  Reading these two pages from chapter 220, it's apparent that Fugaku wants Itachi to be enlisted into the Anbu. He goes as far to show his sharingan to Itachi and states that his enlistment will ""become a very important event for the clan"". It seems that Fugaku was hinting towards Itachi, in front of Sasuke, that his enlistment into Anbu was part of the Uchiha clan's first step into their ill fated coup.  http://mangasee.co/manga/?series=Naruto&chapter=221&index=1&page=14  http://mangasee.co/manga/?series=Naruto&chapter=221&index=1&page=15  http://mangasee.co/manga/?series=Naruto&chapter=221&index=1&page=15  Continuing on to reading these three pages from chapter 221, Fugaku, Mikito, and Itachi all meet late at night in the secrecy of their own home, away from Sasuke's innocent ears. Fugaku shows his disdain for Itachi's choice of not attending the Uchiha's meeting the next day. He states that Itachi does not know of the importance of his position, and that Itachi himself is the link the clan has to the village (possibly the only link the Uchiha has). Fugaku makes sure to state how important Itachi is to their plan, and that he is the only one who has a link to the village and their nerve center.  http://mangasee.co/manga/?series=Naruto&chapter=222&index=1&page=10  http://mangasee.co/manga/?series=Naruto&chapter=222&index=1&page=15  http://mangasee.co/manga/?series=Naruto&chapter=222&index=1&page=18  http://mangasee.co/manga/?series=Naruto&chapter=222&index=1&page=19  Continuing on. These four chapters really hint at Itachi's view of the clan and the choice he's made (most likely post conversation with Danzo). Shisui's suicide note states that their is no future for the clan, and more importantly, that he cannot continue to walk the ""path"" any longer. The path seems to be a reference to the path the rest of the Uchiha's seemed dead set on taking, a coup against the Hidden Leave Village. The following three chapters give insight onto Itachi's point of view of the Uchiha clan, and how little he thinks of the clan due to the arrogance they hold of their name. Itachi's rant makes it certain that he intends to follow through with Danzo's idea.  http://mangasee.co/manga/?series=Naruto&chapter=223&index=1&page=15  In this page from chapter 223, Fugaku appears to have given up on Itachi, seeing that Itachi openly condemned the clan in the previous chapter.  http://mangasee.co/manga/?series=Naruto&chapter=224&index=1&page=3  To me, reading this page from chapter 224, it seems that Fugaku has set his eyes on Sasuke to replace Itachi as the ""pipeline"" to the Hidden Leave. This is just speculation though.  TL;DR: Masashi Kishimoto appears to have planned Itachi being a good guy from near the end of part 1."

First off, initially it wasn't planned, but long before his full reveal, it was probably thought, ""Why did he do something bad?"" which is reason enough to make him a double spy for the higher ups.

Naruto,3chcym,dasecondcomin2,6,Wed Jul 8 22:27:24 2015 UTC,"5'2"" is pretty normal for an Asian girl. I'm considered tall at 5'6"""
Naruto,3chcym,LILY_LALA,1 point,Wed Jul 8 04:35:40 2015 UTC,"I'm Indian and most girls are around 5'4"" here. 5'8"" is considered average for guys here."
Naruto,3chcym,silversherry,1 point,Wed Jul 8 12:02:54 2015 UTC,"Wow you're super tall, I'm just 5' 10'', so i would be around the same height compared to them."
Naruto,3chcym,ZaheerUchiha,1 point,Wed Jul 8 04:14:23 2015 UTC,"5'2"" isn't that short! My lovely fiance is 5'3"" and I'm 6'1""...."
Naruto,3chcym,swarbles,1 point,Wed Jul 8 14:06:08 2015 UTC,"5'11"" would be taller than the average technically but my 5'11"" friend is usually around the average when we're with people our age.  So my guess is if we took an average of college aged men the average would be closer to 5'11"" than the 5'9"" others are posting.  Edit: We're from the US by the way."
Naruto,3chcym,Slowhand8824,58,Wed Jul 8 20:30:55 2015 UTC,"Well obviously... a 5'11"" me is taller than a 5'9"" goku"
Naruto,3chcym,HuyThien,12,Tue Jul 7 23:21:18 2015 UTC,"The title says   at 5'11""   not   a 5'11""   I can't think of a more concise way to put it than OP did."
Naruto,3chcym,CallMeBanjo,5,Wed Jul 8 09:54:59 2015 UTC,"Thanks for clarifying for him /u/CallMeBanjo. Guess I could've put ""TIL  that at 5'11'', Post-Timeskip Naruto is taller than 5'9'' Goku"" for the people who can't read."
Naruto,3chcym,HuyThien,2,Wed Jul 8 11:26:08 2015 UTC,"Still doesn't change the meaning. You're basically saying TIL at 6cm I'm taller than 5cm or at 6 years old I'm older than x at 5 years old. The proper title would be:   TIL [Post-time skip] Naruto (5'11"") is taller than Goku (5'9"")."
Naruto,3chcym,ldashandroid,3,Thu Jul 9 00:36:15 2015 UTC,Thanks for the clarification
Naruto,3chcym,live_lavish,5,Thu Jul 9 05:29:42 2015 UTC,its funny because the art perspective of DBZ vs Naruto makes everyone in DBZ look taller than Naruto characters. Other than Jiraiya that guy is a tower.
Naruto,3chcym,jalford312,2,Wed Jul 8 15:11:05 2015 UTC,Piccolo is also a Tower.
Naruto,3chcym,pluggemr,6,Wed Jul 8 18:44:35 2015 UTC,TIL dbz characters are manlets
Naruto,3chcym,imrunningfromthecops,3,Wed Jul 8 14:28:52 2015 UTC,You'd think a beyond super human level alien would be taller than the average human.
Naruto,3chcym,wardaniel9,1 point,Wed Jul 8 17:44:02 2015 UTC,Wait.... How tall is Vegeta then?
Naruto,3chcym,BitchImaKillYou,1 point,Thu Jul 9 23:12:42 2015 UTC,I guess I'm just as tall as Goku then.
Naruto,3chcym,codenamederp,-29,Wed Jul 8 11:00:22 2015 UTC,that makes sense... Naruto does seem taller now.... also Naruto would totally kick Goku's butt right..... (shots fire)...
Naruto,3chcym,PSIRockin243,29,Tue Jul 7 22:41:23 2015 UTC,Lol k
Naruto,3chcym,codenamederp,23,Tue Jul 7 23:32:00 2015 UTC,"Naruto with his most powerful attack will cause a gigantic explosion, size of a small country at best. Goku as we all know can blow up planets."
Naruto,3chcym,SHINee21,4,Tue Jul 7 23:35:34 2015 UTC,Spirit bomb can do that right? Could Naruto's biggest Rasengan destroy a continent?
Naruto,3chcym,BitchImaKillYou,6,Tue Jul 7 23:48:48 2015 UTC,"Not really, just enough to destroy a  country. Goku for the win any day."
Naruto,3chcym,Zirc0nius,0,Tue Jul 7 23:53:57 2015 UTC,Just a crater*
Naruto,3chcym,wardaniel9,-5,Tue Jul 7 23:59:44 2015 UTC,"I'd say if he spams his SO6P Mode 9 Bijuu Rasenshurikens, he can destroy continents. Remember, each of these cause explosions the size of very small satellites."
Naruto,3chcym,Zirc0nius,4,Wed Jul 8 01:43:56 2015 UTC,"lol piccolo, who is weaker than goku, can destroy planets, in the beginning of the series, when he's at his weakest point yeah, goku can destroy planets xD"
Naruto,3chcym,wardaniel9,-6,Wed Jul 8 03:31:24 2015 UTC,just because piccolo destroy the moon doesn't mean Goku can do it... :p..
Naruto,3chcym,Zirc0nius,6,Wed Jul 8 18:29:07 2015 UTC,"Considering, as I already said, that Goku is stronger than Piccolo, yes, it does."
Naruto,3chcym,wardaniel9,-7,Wed Jul 8 18:31:10 2015 UTC,"Stronger in what way??.... Goku can beat up piccolo in a fight, OK.... Goku is physically stronger than piccolo, OK.... Goku is faster than piccolo, Ok.... Goku can produce a similarly powerful light beam thing that piccolo used that one time to destroy the moon... well we don't know that for sure.... so we can't say that he can or can't but yall believe for sure that he can even though it's not canon..."
Naruto,3chcym,Zirc0nius,4,Wed Jul 8 18:39:13 2015 UTC,Frieza could. Goku beat Frieza as SSJ1. That is canon. He can easily destroy planets. The only reason he hasn't is because he has no reason to.
Naruto,3chcym,wardaniel9,-4,Wed Jul 8 18:42:19 2015 UTC,yes Goku beat Frieza in a fight (Frieza didn't die if you remember) and Goku beating Frieza in a fight doesn't mean he can do that light beam bomb thing that Frieza use to destroy the planet... and I don't remember this all to well but wasn't that planet(piccolo's planet) already weak and was about to die by itself... so if am remember right Frieza destroy an already weak and doom planet..(this am not sure of but maybe)...
Naruto,3chcym,pmitch94,2,Wed Jul 8 18:53:49 2015 UTC,"Frieza destroyed planet Vegeta, in his first form, effortlessly. Goku, in now one of his weakest forms, nearly killed Frieza in his final form, which was many many times stronger than his first form. Then, Trunks, who is again, WEAKER than Goku, one-shots Frieza as a SSJ1. Goku can destroy planets."
Naruto,3chcym,wardaniel9,-3,Wed Jul 8 18:58:28 2015 UTC,"All this prove is that they could beat the other person in a fight and not that they have the power to destroy a planet... Frieza and piccolo are the only one that can because they did... the other we just don't know for sure.. If you have the evidence then show it to me, if not then its inconclusive at best.."
Naruto,3chcym,itmakessenseincontex,1 point,Wed Jul 8 19:04:21 2015 UTC,"Gokus uses a Ki attack to repel Planet busting Ki attacks all the time, Proving that he is capable of creating planet busting ki attacks if his ki can overpower a planet busting ki than Goku = planet buster."
Naruto,3chcym,codenamederp,1 point,Thu Jul 9 00:57:10 2015 UTC,When did he do that??
Naruto,3chcym,Magic-Man2,5,Thu Jul 9 01:03:34 2015 UTC,"Okay, everybody always brings up Rasengan v Spirit Bomb, but you for get something very, very important: Talk no Jutsu."
Naruto,3chcym,LIGHTNINGBOLT23,12,Wed Jul 8 03:14:11 2015 UTC,"Ultimate Talk no Jutsu is by the the most powerful attack. Naruto has reached a level far beyond any shown previously. In the latest Gaiden Manga, he just touches a character in order to end everything. No words required anymore. Taking the talk out of the Talk no Jutsu. That's like removing a bullet from a gun and still managing to shoot an enemy down."
Naruto,3chcym,wardaniel9,1 point,Wed Jul 8 03:31:23 2015 UTC,Kurama touched him.
Naruto,3chcym,PSIRockin243,1 point,Wed Jul 8 06:02:29 2015 UTC,Goku used earplugs!
Naruto,3chcym,Hibria,1 point,Wed Jul 8 05:42:23 2015 UTC,Which planet did he destroy??
Naruto,3chcym,wardaniel9,10,Wed Jul 8 16:24:58 2015 UTC,It's stupid to compare them.
Naruto,3chcym,MasterMac94,2,Tue Jul 7 23:32:04 2015 UTC,"Goku can destroy a planet, naruto is a pussy compared to goku."
Naruto,3chcym,wardaniel9,-7,Wed Jul 8 07:39:09 2015 UTC,When did Goku destroy a planet??....
Naruto,3chcym,MasterMac94,7,Wed Jul 8 16:24:08 2015 UTC,"He never did obviously, but it'd be effortless if he wanted to."
Naruto,3chcym,wardaniel9,-7,Wed Jul 8 16:47:27 2015 UTC,So it's not canon then... therefore Goku cannot destroy a planet... thus we need to use another means to compare Naruto vs Goku... :p
Naruto,3chcym,MasterMac94,10,Wed Jul 8 17:08:21 2015 UTC,"Oh boy, I hope you're trolling."
Naruto,3chcym,wardaniel9,-6,Wed Jul 8 17:30:02 2015 UTC,You and everyone else who says Goku can destroy a planet are the ones trolling because he obviously cannot cause he HASN'T.... you're just making stuff up...
Naruto,3chcym,MasterMac94,9,Wed Jul 8 17:50:25 2015 UTC,"Uh no, Goku has never had a reason to, but he casually stomps planet destroying villains by this point, he himself is more then capable of doing it as well."
Naruto,3chcym,Hibria,-7,Wed Jul 8 17:58:36 2015 UTC,Non of that validates the statement that Goku can destroy a planet.... people just making stuff up... :p
Naruto,3chcym,wardaniel9,10,Wed Jul 8 18:11:53 2015 UTC,"Well, this is a waste of my time, since apparently it's everyone ""making stuff up."" because you don't agree, It's an awfully childish way to think, good day to you."
Naruto,3chcym,Hibria,4,Wed Jul 8 18:22:16 2015 UTC,Do you really think he couldnt?
Naruto,3chcym,wardaniel9,-6,Wed Jul 8 16:53:32 2015 UTC,"Well did he or did he not?? Cause you said ""Goku can destroy a planet"""
Naruto,3chcym,Hibria,6,Wed Jul 8 17:04:36 2015 UTC,"Not that I know of or remember he didn't.  Saying somebody could do something is not saying they did do something. He destroyed frieza and frieza destroyed namek, and that was only super saiyan level 1."
Naruto,3chcym,wardaniel9,-5,Wed Jul 8 17:10:53 2015 UTC,Just because he kill frieza and frieza destroy a planet doesn't mean Goku can destroy a planet.. so if you don't know stop saying that he can... also he didn't even destroy freza because spoiler alert freza is still alive... :p
Naruto,3chcym,Hibria,5,Wed Jul 8 17:21:50 2015 UTC,Goku CAN destroy a planet.... you thinking otherwise is ridiculous. I know frieza is still alive but he was pretty fucked up after namek blew up.
Naruto,3chcym,Desolate_Decapitator,-6,Wed Jul 8 17:31:28 2015 UTC,"Goku CAN destroy a planet....   OK, tell me when... or which planet... and if you can't that mean it's not canon so you are just make stuff up..  And frieza survive the planet exploding while Goku had to use his transmission thing because he would have die, therefore frieza is stronger than Goku even though Goku can beat him in a battle..."

Naruto,3cgzxo,monkeybuttplug,15,Tue Jul 7 21:00:29 2015 UTC,"I actually think that they would hinder each other and prevent each other from using their strongest techniques without killing their teammates.    Kakuzu and Hidan are pretty much the only duo that could fight at full strength without worrying about killing each other due to their immortalities. But for everyone else, they wouldn't be able to use every jutsu in their arsenal because it would likely kill their teammate.    Granted, even if they were limiting themselves, I still think that if all ten (or fifteen if we're counting each Pain) Akatsuki members were to fight at once, they would be able to defeat any single opponent. It wouldn't even be a fair fight, unless they were fighting Madara or Hashirama, I guess. Against an equal sized group, it might be more interesting, though."
Naruto,3cgzxo,Doc_o_Clock,6,Wed Jul 8 00:26:47 2015 UTC,"Deidara would be next to useless unless he separated himself from his teammates, and Kisame wouldn't be able to use his water bubble but he could still use Samehada. The rest of them if they were in a wide enough area could use a decent number of there attacks without getting in each others way. And yea if all of them working together would be next to unstoppable as long as there personalities dont get in the way(that always felt like the Akatsukis biggest weakness)."
Naruto,3cgzxo,uriel_777,5,Wed Jul 8 01:51:25 2015 UTC,"If Deidara takes one of Pein's paths with him in the air, good aerial scouting. Itachi with his Susano'o at the front, with Hidan and Kakuzu by his sides (Immortality reasons) ready to use as distractions, along with Kisame so Samehada(Samehahahahahada) can eat at Naruto's Kyuubi chakra. Sasori at the back protecting from any sneaky use of Shadow Clones/Stitching/Possesion. Tobi landing sneaky attacks with Kamui and Konan air-bombing with paper wings.  Personalities would conflict though."
Naruto,3cgzxo,RobotSnake,3,Wed Jul 8 03:41:31 2015 UTC,"Deidara would take the biggest hit, I think. He wouldn't be able to use C3, C4, or C0, and his usual strategy with C2 wouldn't be too viable."
Naruto,3cgzxo,Doc_o_Clock,1 point,Wed Jul 8 03:08:16 2015 UTC,If they worked together effectively Deidara would be great at maneuvering the enemy where they want them. Dropping bombs that force only one direction of movement.
Naruto,3cgzxo,MrNinjasoda21,3,Wed Jul 8 18:51:18 2015 UTC,My thoughts as well.  Let's say top 10 vs akatsuki...(after time skip before any member of Akatsuki die) Kakashi Naruto Shikamaru Jiraya Tsunade  Guy Neji Sakura Shino (dudes possibly the most badass of them all imo) Asuma Gaara  I would chose those 10 to fight akatsuki...not sure who should fight who since no one would be dead there would be no Grevence against anyone so it would basically be Shikamaru pairing the matches up based on assumptions and likely hood of survival
Naruto,3cgzxo,The_Entire_Eurozone,3,Wed Jul 8 01:41:45 2015 UTC,"The Akatsuki would probably win, but only because of Tobi and Pein.  Tobi because he can't really be hit at that time, and Pein because as we know, he's quite the powerhouse.  The rest don't really compare to Jiraiya or Gai's full power."
Naruto,3cgzxo,Keychupp,1 point,Wed Jul 8 03:06:07 2015 UTC,It would possibly a different outcome if it was top 10 all villages instead of top 10 Konoha
Naruto,3cgzxo,Frix,1 point,Wed Jul 8 10:47:28 2015 UTC,"he did include Gaara, so they're not all from Konoha."
Naruto,3cgzxo,Keychupp,2,Wed Jul 8 11:40:30 2015 UTC,"True, but people like A or some of the Jinchurikis are probably stronger/more useful than Sakura Shino Asuma or Neji"
Naruto,3cgzxo,Pifpif,3,Wed Jul 8 11:43:28 2015 UTC,"We haven't actually seen Shino have a ""big"" fight so we don't know but I bet he would probably beat some of them."
Naruto,3cgzxo,narutofag,1 point,Wed Jul 8 14:09:07 2015 UTC,No other village actually had any problems with them like konaha did except gaara.  And I believe Sakura is a very important member of that line up mainly due to her added healing on top of tsunade.

Naruto,3cgzxo,haex19,3,Tue Jul 7 21:31:01 2015 UTC,No. The Akatsuki only has two Rinnegans. Is Nagato going to have them both or is Obito getting the other one?
Naruto,3cgzxo,Shisui_1994,6,Tue Jul 7 21:33:47 2015 UTC,"I think Nagato got to keep both of them, because when Akatsuki was still there, Obito hadn't taken Nagato's eyes yet."

Naruto,3cgzxo,Frix,3,Tue Jul 7 21:56:11 2015 UTC,"Deidara is basically the whole definition of teamkiller. Pein's biggest jutsu are all area-of-effect, as are kisame's. Itatchi, sasori, kakuzu, konan, hidan, zetsu, and tobi would be the people in such a team, and with itatchi backstabbing them at a precipitous moment Konoha should be able to win (Assuming Jiraya and Tsunade are with them.)"

Naruto,3cgzxo,almondsAndRain,3,Wed Jul 8 02:55:23 2015 UTC,Dude even if they were up against toddlers the Z warriors would somehow stretch it out to 5 episodes.
Naruto,3chfdc,Dosu_Kinuta,20,Tue Jul 7 22:53:00 2015 UTC,Kiba. Simply because Ino is useful is a team setting whereas Kiba basically has one ability which is like a drill and does less than Rasengan.
Naruto,3chfdc,Legovil,8,Tue Jul 7 22:54:48 2015 UTC,2 headed wolf  3 headed wolf  Dynamic Marking  Tail Chasing Rotating Fang  Super Fang over Fang  ....I wouldn't be so sure......
Naruto,3chfdc,walta_,17,Wed Jul 8 02:29:10 2015 UTC,Outside of the marking they're all pretty much become a drill no jutsu
Naruto,3chfdc,FlicRair,6,Wed Jul 8 02:30:40 2015 UTC,"Nope not the Tail Chasing Rotating Fang.  And even if that were the case, so what? I mean it's taijutsu, and there are plenty of ninja who focused only on brute force."
Naruto,3chfdc,walta_,5,Wed Jul 8 02:35:35 2015 UTC,He might be an okay ninja but the question is comparing him to the rest of the konoha 11. Easily he's at rock bottom on that list.
Naruto,3chfdc,Neural_groove,3,Wed Jul 8 07:05:56 2015 UTC,"Yeah but the most we've really seen Kiba do is take down one of the minions the bijuu made, while Ino used her Mind-Transfer technique to divert a blast from the bijuu by taking control of Obito. I know those aren't very comparable, but it shows that Ino is more useful than Kiba is in a fight."
Naruto,3chfdc,FlicRair,1 point,Wed Jul 8 02:43:10 2015 UTC,"No it wasn't. It was when the allied shinobi forces arrived on the battlefield, before Naruto distributed his chakra."

Naruto,3chfdc,erockarmy1,9,Wed Jul 8 03:40:41 2015 UTC,Kiba....is that even a question?
Naruto,3chfdc,fangirl505,7,Wed Jul 8 14:27:59 2015 UTC,really over tenten?
Naruto,3chfdc,ZaheerUchiha,12,Tue Jul 7 23:09:17 2015 UTC,"Tenten is weak alright, but she was trained by the best taijutsu user of their times, even if she lacks on ninjutsu we can be sure she must have some pretty decent taijutsu."
Naruto,3chfdc,BigShel,8,Tue Jul 7 23:10:43 2015 UTC,I dot know if this is considered a spoiler but people are forgetting she got a few of the legendary ninja tools... aka she’s got weapons that make her a legitimate threat.
Naruto,3chfdc,Neural_groove,3,Wed Jul 8 02:29:26 2015 UTC,but they also slowly kill her if she uses them to much
Naruto,3chfdc,Newtonbomb11,9,Wed Jul 8 05:00:36 2015 UTC,"Her ninja tools will last though. As akamaru ages, kiba's attacks are weaker."
Naruto,3chfdc,henne-n,3,Wed Jul 8 05:11:14 2015 UTC,"Really, I don`t get why you guys say tenten, sure all shes got is shuriken and kunai, but she can make TORNADO KUNAI AND SHURIKEN... sort of."
Naruto,3chfdc,Thatguy69Kappa,2,Wed Jul 8 07:07:36 2015 UTC,I always loved her fighting style (as seen in the games lol). It's kinda cool but we hardly did see it in the manga.
Naruto,3chfdc,DustyMill,7,Wed Jul 8 00:16:17 2015 UTC,Either Kiba or Ten ten who both are super strong anyway its just that everyone else is godlike and maybe Shino even thou i would put him over both Kiba and Ten Ten.
Naruto,3chfdc,DustyMill,-3,Wed Jul 8 06:53:20 2015 UTC,I'd say Tenten or Ino hands down. We haven't seen much of Shino but (not sure about fillers) he has never been shown losing a fight and  he seems to be pretty close to Sasuke when it comes to combat awareness
Naruto,3chfdc,mike1883,7,Tue Jul 7 22:56:23 2015 UTC,ino can at least go into peoples mind and make them kill themselves (something like what fu was going to do) and tenten has.. shuriken and kunai
Naruto,3chfdc,GaBeRockKing,0,Tue Jul 7 23:11:06 2015 UTC,I remember someone asking this question a few days ago and that jutsu in the only reason I didn't say Ino because it is a pretty useful jutsu
Naruto,3chfdc,mike1883,1 point,Tue Jul 7 23:13:13 2015 UTC,so we agreed on tenten lol?
Naruto,3chfdc,DustyMill,4,Tue Jul 7 23:17:22 2015 UTC,It wouldn't shock me to know Kiba is weaker. 10/10 has the Sages tools.

Naruto,3chfdc,Thatguy69Kappa,3,Wed Jul 8 12:51:15 2015 UTC,When it comes to 1v1 I think we can agree that Ino is the weakest link among the Konoha 11.
Naruto,3chfdc,DasKatze500,2,Tue Jul 7 23:41:57 2015 UTC,"It's going to be tenten.  People who obviously don't qualify:  Naruto, Sakura, Lee, Neji, Shikamaru  People who're okay:  Hinata, Choji  Out of the remainder (Ino, Kiba, Shino, Tenten) Ino is a med-nin, and kiba and shino are both trackers. All tenten has is combat and sealing, and we don't see her seal much in the canon episodes (filler doesn't count.) Sure, she's OK at combat, but outclassed by the majority of the K11."
Naruto,3chfdc,Thatguy69Kappa,3,Wed Jul 8 02:31:30 2015 UTC,"Hinata got a big boost in The Last so she is above or the same as Sakura in terms of power . Choji won allmost all by himself a single battlefield in the war versus Kakuzu,Asuma,Dan and Neji's father , he is S tier if you ask me ."
Naruto,3chfdc,HighGuy92,3,Wed Jul 8 03:44:35 2015 UTC,I haven't watched The Last but why are people so sure that Hinata is now on Sakura's level? To my (admittedly poor knowledge) she got some of Hamura's chakra or something? How does that mean she is as skilled/at Sakura's level?
Naruto,3chfdc,BlueVelvet90,2,Wed Jul 8 08:26:23 2015 UTC,"Well SPOILERS she got all of Hamura's chakra ,she is his reincarnation . The same with Naruto/Ashura and so on . And by watching the movie you will see she broke something that isnt that easily breakable (that was the most unspoilery way for me to say it :D ) ."
Naruto,3chfdc,maurodsimone,1 point,Wed Jul 8 17:39:52 2015 UTC,"I don't mind spoilers. I've read the plot of The Last, I've just forgotten, and from what I remember I didn't recall Hinata doing anything to indicate she's reached Sakura's level.   Besides this breaking of something that isn't easily breakable (aha) did she do anything else proving she's on Sakura's level, or are people just assuming she's somewhere around there due to being the transcendent/incarnation thing of Hamura?"
Naruto,3chfdc,WhereIsMyManatee,1 point,Wed Jul 8 18:58:30 2015 UTC,Well I dont really remember her doing that much people are just assuming it but she was fairly strong before that and her being an incarnation makes it kinda logical that she would get a boost in power.
Naruto,3chfdc,Neural_groove,2,Wed Jul 8 22:17:38 2015 UTC,"It's easily Ten-Ten. Throughout the entire series, does she ever do anything very impressive? Even when she finally gets an OP weapon, she's too weak to be able to use it to its full capacity. Also, Ino and Kiba's skills are more useful to the village 95% of the time than Ten-Ten's sealing is."
Naruto,3chfdc,WhereIsMyManatee,4,Thu Jul 9 08:43:02 2015 UTC,I'm gonna go with Ino.

Naruto,3chfdc,BitchImaKillYou,3,Wed Jul 8 00:02:20 2015 UTC,"Probably Ten Ten.   Hinata might be one of the stronger of the Konoha 11, given what happened in the Last."
Naruto,3chfdc,WaffleStealer,2,Wed Jul 8 13:32:21 2015 UTC,You'd say Tenten is weaker than kiba?

Naruto,3cg999,henne-n,4,Tue Jul 7 19:16:44 2015 UTC,"I have often thought this. I also think the animation style, like in the Ninja Storm games, would really lend itself to looking damn good on a video game. Naruto is perfect for an MMORPG because there are so many different abilities, items, skills, etc. I wish this would happen. I would pay mad $$ for it.  what would be super awesome is, instead of leveling up, your character gets older (would obviously have to stop around 25-26, prime age), and your chakra reserves increase and you can learn new skills.  You could have a skill point system that allows you to allocate for certain spells (think Diablo II) so that you can choose the path you want to go down. Each path could have summonings, attack jutsu, support jutsu, and associated ninja tools, and would be unique to each village.  I think it would be cool if you could somehow make bloodline limits available in some respect. It would have to take away from another skill you'd otherwise have though so characters didn't get too powerful.  Some skills could be from the game - i.e., Rasengan, Chidori, etc., others could be created by the developer in order to give the game a unique feel."
Naruto,3cg999,swarbles,1 point,Tue Jul 7 19:22:23 2015 UTC,"There should be different trees of specializations. i.e.  Type of jutsu: Genjutsu/Taijutsu/Ninjutsu  Your role: Support (Healer)/Tank/Assasin/ maybe more?  Your Justu knowledge and capabilities: Shape and Nature control. Ammount of natures you can control.   Level within your village: Academy, Gennin, Chunnin, Jounin, Ambu (?), Sannin (?), Kage should not be reachable (?). Or maybe be a rouge ninja alltogether or a criminal.  Your clan. I.e. relating with other players to form a clan or a family and inherit bloodline traits? Have a specific zone within your village for your clan."
Naruto,3cg999,maurodsimone,1 point,Tue Jul 7 20:10:36 2015 UTC,"Good idea.  So, starting zone you could choose your clan (comes with certain benefits and restrictions, i.e. Uchiha clan means you are fire type - obviously stuff like sharingan is fairly untenable in reality so maybe it could provide certain ""racials"" like in WoW (i.e. for byakugan, ability to slowly drain enemies chakra, or for sharingan an ability to copy a technique for 1 time use) - unique skills that are helpful but don't break the game. And if you didn't want to place yourself in a clan you could choose some kind of ""independent"" option which would give you maybe a minor chakra boost or an extra skill to select due to the lack of clan technique (because clan techniques tend to take up a large portion of ones skillset in Naruto).  I think ranks would probably have to be academy (short tutorial of the game), Gennin (complete easier missions, probably alone), Chunnin (start to do harder missions, against CPUs), Jounin (most difficult missions / player-vs-player combat missions). ANBU/Sennin wouldn't really make sense as ranks. Although a person could classify themselves as ""ANBU"" perhaps within the Jounin ranks and maybe specialize in a certain type of mission to boost their skills."
Naruto,3cg999,swarbles,1 point,Tue Jul 7 20:36:53 2015 UTC,"I think AMBU should be a rank. Maybe not Sannin... Maybe you could name the Admins like that? IDK...   Starting zone, your village, as you said should give you benefits and restrictions. Same goes for picking your clan or maybe not belonging to any clan... It is a must that is balanced, we don't want to have 120381290318230980 million uchihas with EMS running around... LOL"
Naruto,3cg999,maurodsimone,1 point,Wed Jul 8 13:07:07 2015 UTC,"lol thats true. I think some stuff you'd have to leave out. Like obviously mangekyou powers are mad OP and in the manga only like, 4 people unlock it, so it shouldn't even be available.  As for sannin... it's not really a rank anyway. so I think ya having it be like the Admin title would make sense. Obviously the kages would have to be NPCs - probably like in WoW, where you have Raid Boss-level Mobs as the ""chieftan"" of the city. That way you could have active PvP.  The big question is, when to set the game? Do we set it in the future, with Naruto as hokage? Or should it be set in the past, either in the period of the 2nd/3rd Great Ninja Wars or in the Warring States period."
Naruto,3cg999,swarbles,1 point,Wed Jul 8 13:59:55 2015 UTC,"Think of expansions! We could have it start in the past. And expansions set that would move the timeline along.   The only thing about villages and clans I feel like, is that we have way more information about the Konoha clans than of any other village. I mean, there are not too many known clans in the other villages that I recall.   This means we would have 1 of two options. Have this ""clan selection"" thing be possible regardesless of which village you start from (which makes no cannon sense, but makes practical sense). Or come up with some significant buff to start in any other village rather than Konoha.   PS, I am loving this debate!"
Naruto,3cg999,maurodsimone,1 point,Wed Jul 8 14:10:13 2015 UTC,"True, that's a good point. I think you would have to add some really cool clan options to the other villages to entice people to play in those villages. And, in general, just encourage people not to all be uchihas lol. Or maybe beyond ""clan"" it can refer to a type of jutsu. I.E. Suna has puppet jutsu, Konoha has the Ino-Shika-Cho jutsus and sharingan/byakugan, kumo has the Lariat, black lightning, and gale style. Iwa has particle style, golem jutsus, Kiri has a bunch of kekkai genkais and the Houzaki clan abilities, etc. So maybe instead of picking a clan you would have the option to choose specialized jutsus, to promote spreading people between villages.  I am loving this too. WHERE IS A GAME DEVELOPER AT WE HAVE A WINNING IDEA."
Naruto,3cg999,swarbles,1 point,Wed Jul 8 15:30:05 2015 UTC,"I would pay mad cash to be part of the Nara clan just sayiing... But yeah, powers, skills and that would be SO interesting to balance out.   One thing though to be certain is that no ninja in the narutoverse is complete on his own. That is why ninja teams are always at least composed from 2 to 4 members. So even if you would become a strong genjutstu uchiha, there should be other aspects that you might be lacking into. What I mean is, even if the Uchiha would seem like the most powerful clan, there sure is a way to balance it out so that people will want to belong to other villages or clans. Also, going ROUGUE should be an option.   Gosh, this would be such a great idea!!!!!!!!!!! Are you a dev? Is there anybody out there!!!!?!?! we have a money making cow here!!!"
Naruto,3cg999,maurodsimone,1 point,Wed Jul 8 18:00:59 2015 UTC,"Yeah I think you would have most higher level missions be instanced and require a team. And some missions could have multiple teams or even multiple sides going for the same or different objectives. That way you can combine PvE and PvP in a uniquely Naruto way.  going rogue would be cool, but I wonder how it would work. Would there be like a black market side of the game where you could get assasination quests and stuff? maybe you could join up with shadow organizations like Orochimaru."
Naruto,3cg999,swarbles,1 point,Wed Jul 8 21:56:43 2015 UTC,What about Kekkei-genkai? I mean like combination of chakra of two or more natures?   What about shape or nature control? Wouldn't that be a specialization?   Just throwing maybe even more ideas.   I would love the idea of such a game.

Naruto,3cg999,Blacklotus30,1 point,Tue Jul 7 21:08:17 2015 UTC,"You know I wonder why we don't even have that YET, I mean i've seen a few naruto games that are considered mmoish? but they are LAME in every possible way.  Naruto is the perfect setting for it. I mean you could follow one of the ninja villages story(each village will have it's own contained story in which your character ages. you know say you start the story at age 5 going to the academy and as the story of the village progress your character gets older and you can change clothing and stuff) but in the background a world story happen(involve missions outside the village). You could have skill based progression working in parallel to jutsus.  you start with a small appartment and work your way to a bigger house to store your hard earned stuff.  clan system would also be important, but I would like that at the start you can choose to be in a clan from the beginning if you choose to and then you are put in the village with other people of the same clan. There possibilities are endless here.   Additional to an MMO, I would like a single player RPG where you make you own character and follow a new storyline you get to meet characters. You know like your own personal ninja story."

And Sakura has surpassed that.  Could she go blow for blow with him, no, that's obvious.  But physical strength within a punch, Sakura."

Naruto,3cgxe3,sluckinfuttbuckin,1 point,Fri Jul 10 17:18:37 2015 UTC,I see thanks!
Naruto,3cgxe3,SilverStoneSlide,2,Tue Jul 7 21:06:01 2015 UTC,"First, let me get this straight. Sakura is not physically strong, as in having muscular body or high amount of endurance. Her punch was devastating only because she have very good chakra control, and can channel it efficiently to her hand when punching.  I'd say, pre epilogue Madara's punching strength is not as strong as Sakura, since Madara don't fight using hand combat.  For second timeskip, Edo Madara's punch still isn't as strong as Sakura for the same reason. But his Biijudara form punch could be stronger than Sakura, since in that form he have access to huge amount of chakra, so even if he can't channel it as efficiently theoretically he still can dish out more chakra than Sakura. Madara never use chakra enhanced punch in the manga, though.   If you want to see the ultimate chakra enhanced physical attack, see Guy's 8 gates attack. That flying kick got to be the strongest  taijutsu in the manga.  ps. Speaking of chakra control and punch, it remind me of Sarada. She could be the ultimate genjutsu master. She have sharingan and great chakra control, both are great for using genjutsu."
Naruto,3cgxe3,Caliburn0,2,Tue Jul 7 22:24:13 2015 UTC,Everyone uses normal chakra enhancements on their muscles. It's just that Tsunade and Sakura takes it so much further.
Naruto,3cgxe3,SilverStoneSlide,1 point,Wed Jul 8 10:54:54 2015 UTC,"Agree.   Shushin no jutsu (body flicker) is one of the example of chakra enhancement on muscle (leg muscle), which used by many ninjas, so it won't be so odd to think other ninja using similar punching technique as Sakura and Tsunade.  However, the manga itself never specifically mentioned anyone use chakra enhanced punch aside those two, so it pretty hard to confirm your statement."
Naruto,3cgxe3,Caliburn0,1 point,Wed Jul 8 12:34:02 2015 UTC,"Ehh... They can jump higher, punch harder, run faster. Ninja are physically stronger than should be possible with a human body. The logical conclusion of this is that they all use chakra enhancements. If nothing else, then subconsciously. I can come up with several theories of why good chakra control can help this, but it wouldn't really lead anywhere, as all of it would just be fan-theories."
Naruto,3cgxe3,SilverStoneSlide,2,Wed Jul 8 13:48:34 2015 UTC,"Theoretically, chakra can be one of the explanation for the super strength ninja seems to have. It was never directly implied, though.  To me, it's weird that jutsu like Sakura's punch and Shunshin was specifically implied to use chakra as enhancer, as if it was a separate technique than regular ninja jump or ninja run.  The super strength also can be explained by low gravity of ninja world, or by the fact ninjas are descendent of Hagoromo, who are among an alien race.   Senju and Uchiha are specifically mentioned as the descendent of the Sage, but who to say among these people didn't breed with human, release their ties with the clans and start creating their own ninja clan?"
Naruto,3cgxe3,Caliburn0,1 point,Wed Jul 8 14:37:01 2015 UTC,"Low gravity would create more issues than it solved. Such a thing would have much farther reaching consequences than just being able to jump higher.  Also, regular ninja are not descendants of Hagoromo. That just isn't possible. There are far, far to many. Plus civilian children with no ninja parents can also become ninja.   All of these issues can easily be explained however, but you have to take some liberal freedoms. It makes sense that all ninja enhance their basic physical abilities. But it only goes up to a certain limit. I would say that Gai is pretty much at that limit, as is A, Bee and a few other physical powerhouses. However, Tsunade found a way to surpass this limit, somehow. My guess is that while normal ninja enhance their muscles with chakra, she pushes forward with that chakra. At the same time, she uses the exact same amount of energy the exact opposite direction of the original energy. So that the force exerted on her arm is zero. This requires insane amounts of chakra control, but if you manage it, the limit of how hard you can punch is only dependant on the users chakra control and amount of chakra used.  Shunshin is a little harder, and with more possibilities. Speculating exactly how a technique works is somewhat of a favorite past time for me, and it also helps me when I write fanfiction. ;)"
Naruto,3cgxe3,SilverStoneSlide,1 point,Wed Jul 8 20:25:33 2015 UTC,"You are correct with not all ninja are Hagoromo's descendent. Further reading I discovered Hagoromo shared his chakra with the normal people, meaning even a non-Ōtsutsuki can have chakra.  Your explanation of ninja always use chakra to enhanced their strength still didn't make sense to me since whenever they were implied, it always categorized as a technique rather than something all ninja always can do naturally."
Naruto,3cgxe3,Caliburn0,1 point,Wed Jul 8 21:45:54 2015 UTC,"Implied... It feel the fact that they jump 10-20 feet through the air more than implies that they use chakra. Civilians can't do that. Only ninja do that, what does ninja have that civilians don't? Chakra. It makes total sense to me. Not that believing otherwise would detract from the story in any way..."
Naruto,3cgxe3,SilverStoneSlide,1 point,Wed Jul 8 22:12:54 2015 UTC,"You see, you just said normal non-ninja parent child can be a ninja, and the Sage shared his chakra with normal humans through Ninshu. Meaning even civilian can be ninja if they trained.  I won't say chakra isn't involved at all for ninja's super physical feats, it could happened using your argument, what I am saying is we simply didn't have proof, that's all.   Plus, every chakra enhancing moves are labeled as technique/jutsu, while the punches and running didn't labeled as such, so there are rooms to say these ninjas are simply strong or strong for a reason aside chakra boost."

Naruto,3cfhvv,DoubleHunter,5,Tue Jul 7 15:05:08 2015 UTC,"The Last and Boruto. However, you're still hundreds of episodes away from the end. Heck, the anime isn't even done yet."
Naruto,3cfhvv,Garciadomain,1 point,Tue Jul 7 15:20:26 2015 UTC,only watch Naruto The Last for the NaruHina moments. The actual story and pertaining villain are a waste of time.
Naruto,3cfhvv,TBWolf,1 point,Thu Jul 9 02:44:37 2015 UTC,"on netflix, there's only like 150/220 episodes or so, though it has the important episodes I believe.  I'd skip the movies until you're a ways into Shippuden though, that's what I'm doing. I'm still on episode 240 or so, and I haven't watched them yet."
Naruto,3cfhvv,Awesomeana12,1 point,Thu Jul 9 09:18:47 2015 UTC,"there is about 60 more episode of filler that are not on Netflix but, they are horrible and have no effect on the story. If you don't want to watch the filler, you are really going to want to stop at Season 3 Episode 31. There is a sequel called Naruto Shippuden on Crunchyroll for free and is legal or you can read the manga (which in my opinion is better than the anime.) For the most part, you can understand them without watching many episodes. I always like to think of the movies as long filler episodes."

Naruto,3cd4jj,4Khazmodan,8,Wed Jul 8 00:00:52 2015 UTC,"Poor Mr. Sandman, life as a leader isn't easy. Good on him for taking everything so well, behaving like a true Kage and an empathetic human.  But seriously, the writing in this last chapter was simply superb. The tension was really built up well by alternating between the situations in Suna and the outskirts and the twists and resolution were phenomenal.  And does Shikamaru smoke now? I thought he hated the smell. Oh well...  Quite a heartwarming end to a poignant chapter. Though Gaara didn't find romantic love, the strength of his bonds with his siblings was reaffirmed, as well as established in the case of Shikamaru.  This has been a fantastic read overall. Major props to Ukyō Kodachi for writing it as well as Cacatua."
Naruto,3cd4jj,rvbcaboose1018,5,Tue Jul 7 00:30:53 2015 UTC,"yea, this chapter was killer (actually, this whole novel has been amazing). And shikamaru started smoking after asuma died, but i can't remember when he stopped, so many it's only every once and a while now?"

Naruto,3cejfb,AwesomeDattebayo,14,Tue Jul 7 10:52:56 2015 UTC,I would kill for a Part 3. Sarada would make an amazing protagonist and I liked how the Gaiden was written (from her perspective).

Naruto,3cejfb,Wraxu,2,Tue Jul 7 12:26:32 2015 UTC,But what would the plot be?
Naruto,3cejfb,henne-n,12,Tue Jul 7 12:07:40 2015 UTC,A plot solely based on how much they can break the plot.
Naruto,3cejfb,HokageEzio,3,Tue Jul 7 12:31:12 2015 UTC,I thought they already did that with the movies?
Naruto,3cejfb,silversherry,13,Tue Jul 7 13:24:06 2015 UTC,Except now Kishimoto can join in on the fun.
Naruto,3cejfb,HokageEzio,4,Tue Jul 7 13:26:37 2015 UTC,"The vast, overarching plot? The unknown force that Kaguya was building an army for.   The more localized plot? Similar to part one - a new generation of ninja. Going on missions, etc while being trained by the previous generation. I'd like to see Sarada have water and wind jutsu.  Bolt has a lot of maturing to do, and I feel like there's a ton of potential there. If Kishimoto wants to do a 'history repeats' thing, Bolt could even break down to the Circle of Hatred, spawned by intense jealousy of both his father (Hokage, beloved, jinchuuriki) and Sarada (sharingan, natural chakra control)."

Naruto,3cdgm6,kaito0,2,Tue Jul 7 05:12:48 2015 UTC,growing up I would run like that too! I played a lot of sports (and snuck it in there). I remember those Saturdays at 10:00 when naruto would come on. I watched from the very start and had no idea what kind of an effect that show would have on me
Naruto,3cdgm6,swarbles,6,Tue Jul 7 05:05:29 2015 UTC,"As much as I hate to say that it has a lot of plot holes and inconsistencies, it does. The bright side to all of that? Fanfiction. Whereas with most series I've read or watched that have ended I pretty much stop following there, I've continued on with Naruto because of the prospect that there are still fanmade stories being written out there."
Naruto,3cdgm6,dasecondcomin2,2,Tue Jul 7 05:15:16 2015 UTC,"Couldn't agree more. I started reading Naruto a decade ago and it's been a long and emotional ride. The idea that it is ending seems so... silly. Even if Kishi doesn't want to continue, I hope he allows someone to take up his mantle. There are so many more stories to tell, it would be such a shame to see one of the greatest fantasy worlds ever created go away. NEED MOAR NARUTO"

Naruto,3cfk4k,RockSauron,1 point,Tue Jul 7 16:39:52 2015 UTC,"I've never watched the filler episode but according to Narutopedia   For an unknown reason, Yūkimaru has the ability to partially control the Three-Tails. By use of pills given to him by Kabuto, he can summon the Three-Tails. At first he could only make an apparition of the beast appear, after taking some of Kabuto's pills. Later, after taking a larger dosage of the pills, combined with Guren's Crystal Release, he is able to make the beast fully appear, but couldn't control it. Yūkimaru can also control the Three-Tails for a short while without the aid of Kabuto's pills, as when he restrained it when Guren was in danger of being harmed."
Naruto,3cfk4k,Awesomeana12,1 point,Tue Jul 7 15:03:54 2015 UTC,Is the pill later explained in episodes after?

Naruto,3cekhq,izn1337,1 point,Tue Jul 7 10:19:19 2015 UTC,The text literally didn't past into program. So someone apparently didn't bother to QC or just type it out again.
Naruto,3cekhq,LILY_LALA,3,Tue Jul 7 17:21:01 2015 UTC,Mangastream translation makes more sense because Sakura was already pregnant during the 5 Kage meeting flashback where Sasuke was explaining to them his theory about Kaguya's mysterious enemy.   Would make sense that she was already or going to travel with Sasuke/Taka
Naruto,3cekhq,faceroll_it,3,Tue Jul 7 09:04:52 2015 UTC,We don't know that she was pregnant. It's just speculation at this point. It actually makes more sense in the timeline if she isn't pregnant there

Naruto,3cbwhk,Trainer_Kevin,15,Mon Jul 6 18:35:50 2015 UTC,"Hand signs are used to dictate the amount of chakra to moulded into the jutsu, it could be viewed as better chakra control requires less chakra needed into the technique, and less hand signs as a result. It could pretty much mean large chakra reserve or simply better chakra control"
Naruto,3cbwhk,Danbito,2,Mon Jul 6 18:48:04 2015 UTC,"We did never get too much theory on how Hand-waving signs works... That WOULD have been cool to know, but then again so many of these questions would arise..."
Naruto,3cbwhk,maurodsimone,7,Mon Jul 6 19:27:06 2015 UTC,Yes we do. It's explained throughout the series. The wiki page does a good job of collecting the information given to us.
Naruto,3cbwhk,dynrte,0,Mon Jul 6 19:31:55 2015 UTC,Ok this wiki page should have had a chapter at least... I wouldn't have minded a filler about this...
Naruto,3cbwhk,maurodsimone,3,Mon Jul 6 19:55:34 2015 UTC,"The wiki sources all of its claims, telling you which exact chapter you can find the information in."
Naruto,3cbwhk,dynrte,5,Mon Jul 6 19:57:20 2015 UTC,"Clone jutsu is not the same as Kage Bunshin mind you... Shadow clones are solid, whereas Normal clones are not. Two different techniques although I dont know what that sign with the cross fingers is."
Naruto,3cbwhk,maurodsimone,2,Mon Jul 6 19:34:39 2015 UTC,The Cross Fingers isn't a traditional seal. Apparently it is it's own unique seal.
Naruto,3cbwhk,dynrte,3,Mon Jul 6 19:48:11 2015 UTC,"First of all, hand seals are used for molding chakra. The exact amount of chakra required to perform a technique is manipulated via Hand seals. While many techniques require a number of hand seals to work, skilled ninjas can use less or even one hand seal to perform a technique for a variety of reasons such as chakra pool.  One example of this is Water Dragon Bullet technique which requires 44 hand seals normally. Tobirama can do this technique with one hand seal, a testament to his skill. Sasuke mastering the Chidori and fire techniques are just another example of this,  Also, the Kage Bunshin is COMPLETELY different from the normal clone technique. There is a BIG difference."
Naruto,3cbwhk,night4345,3,Mon Jul 6 20:44:28 2015 UTC,You use handsigns to manipulate Chakra better. As Sasuke got better he needed less and less handsigns to do Jutsu. Clones got their own seal.
Naruto,3cbwhk,night4345,7,Mon Jul 6 20:00:39 2015 UTC,Pretty obvious Kishimoto realized 300 handsigns would be insane to draw. Also Kakashi was copying the technique so he'd have to go along with what Zabuza was doing.
Naruto,3cbwhk,AmaranthSparrow,1 point,Mon Jul 6 21:28:47 2015 UTC,"Hand signs are basically like a mathematical formula to help the shinobi cast a jutsu, as it helps them control their chakra more precisely.  The more skilled a shinobi is at using a particular jutsu, the more efficient they are, which means they can weave fewer seals, or even no seals in some cases.  Think of it like the difference between long division and short division."
Naruto,3cbwhk,knight504,-4,Mon Jul 6 21:34:39 2015 UTC,Probably the anime being inconsistent.
Naruto,3cbwhk,dynrte,7,Mon Jul 6 21:38:30 2015 UTC,"This is incorrect. If anything, the anime has been very consistent with hand seals."
Naruto,3cbwhk,ankrotachi10,3,Tue Jul 7 05:57:20 2015 UTC,Kage Bunshin (Shadow Clones) are different to ordinary clones.
Naruto,3cbwhk,ankrotachi10,6,Mon Jul 6 18:48:46 2015 UTC,That's what I was saying... They are different.
Naruto,3cbwhk,zaerosz,4,Mon Jul 6 19:32:11 2015 UTC,How is that not different?
Naruto,3cbwhk,dynrte,2,Mon Jul 6 21:40:10 2015 UTC,"Why? You do know what hand seals are for, right? They're for molding chakra. The clone seal is probably a special seal that indicates the amount of chakra you're giving to your clones. It's not by any means an activation seal..."
Naruto,3ce54l,AllOfEverythingEver,6,Tue Jul 7 05:13:07 2015 UTC,"I may be wrong, but I believe that the replacement technique can be used with anything, not just organic materials. From my understanding, which could be flawed, the only reasons that logs are used commonly is because the story takes place in Konoha, and the kage bunshin are energy constructs that may or may not be considered organic. As for the rabbit I always thought it was a trick Zabuza used to confuse enemies that were able to detect him, since he seemed to like playing mind games."
Naruto,3ce54l,GnaritusFibrosis,2,Tue Jul 7 05:35:55 2015 UTC,"To add on to the rabbit. If you throw a knife and hit something, what is more suspicious; a rabbit or a cut up log?"
Naruto,3ce54l,MrNinjasoda21,2,Tue Jul 7 05:58:04 2015 UTC,"I never understood why they needed to escape the attack, go find a log and place it in the way of the attack. Why not just side step it?"
Naruto,3ce54l,NaturaHigh,2,Tue Jul 7 08:13:29 2015 UTC,The only way substitution makes sense to me is if they actually switch spots. Like teleporting.
Naruto,3ce54l,NaturaHigh,2,Tue Jul 7 13:03:25 2015 UTC,"That would make most sense, but I recall it being described by Kakashi as moving fast and replacing youself with whatever .  Spoilers  Edit: added spoiler tag"

Naruto,3cb04d,Terceras,3,Mon Jul 6 14:32:51 2015 UTC,"We don't really know. But I would go with. No, it can't absorb the explosion from a bijudama, kirin, or already released techniques like a tidal wave that already has momentum. It might be able to, but I honestly can't see how. Still, everything is energy. So it might be able to absorb other types of energy than just chakra, only much, much slower. That's a stretch though, based purely on the fact that absorption is absorption and energy is literally everything around us."
Naruto,3cb04d,Caliburn0,1 point,Mon Jul 6 18:35:22 2015 UTC,"The Preta Path doesn't just absorb chakra. It takes outside chakra, spins it in the opposite way it's already spinning, and inject its into the user's chakra reserves.   Given that it works in such a way, I don't think it would be possible for it to do that. We even saw that it can't absorb nature chakra properly, so trying to absorb an outside force might either fail completely or blow the user apart."

Naruto,3cb04d,MinatoAgara,3,Mon Jul 6 15:11:42 2015 UTC,"If I recall correctly, the reason Kirin was so fast, powerful, and required so little chakra is because Sasuke only used chakra to guide already existing lightning. That's why I asked if a Preta Path user could absorb it."
Naruto,3cb04d,sacuna151,0,Mon Jul 6 15:20:28 2015 UTC,"Preta would be able to absorb the chakra being used to guide the lightning, but the lightning itself would still strike him.

Naruto,3cckti,LILY_LALA,5,Mon Jul 6 21:25:28 2015 UTC,I'm just saying that what's shown on the show/manga makes this untrue.

Naruto,3ce362,XStarK48,22,Tue Jul 7 04:53:03 2015 UTC,"I think Sasuke recognized that, like Naruto, Sakura never really gave up on him while he was off being a massive dick for a while. She's a childhood comrade of his, and an incredibly powerful ninja. I can understand it pretty well."
Naruto,3ce362,Rambro332,15,Tue Jul 7 05:57:31 2015 UTC,I don't think most people cared tbh.
Naruto,3ce362,Lord4th,19,Tue Jul 7 04:56:41 2015 UTC,"I really don't care.  Sakura could have ended up marrying Akamaru and Sasuke with Tonton for all I care.  It really doesn't bother me either way.  Sasuke went on his little Pokemon journey, found his true feelings like all emotional Uchiha bitches need to do, and found out that he finds Sakura's wide ass forehead attractive.  Greatest relationship ever told."
Naruto,3ce362,HokageEzio,-3,Tue Jul 7 05:48:18 2015 UTC,I agree. Very well written
Naruto,3ce362,ohnoyouwont,4,Tue Jul 7 06:01:35 2015 UTC,Because they have same hairstyles.  (And because of Sasuke -> Sakura moments)
Naruto,3ce362,DoubleHunter,5,Tue Jul 7 07:14:46 2015 UTC,Why do people care about shipping in general?
Naruto,3ce362,sussurate,7,Tue Jul 7 09:02:04 2015 UTC,idgaf about the whole shipping thing... some people are so passionate about the romance aspect of the series that they seem to be more absorbed by it than the actual plot lol  But I guess people are pro-sasusaku (mostly fangirls) because there are parts of the series where Sasuke shows consideration towards Sakura... but is2g Kishi didn't even mean to write a full-on romance so that probably explains why their romantic relationship if not all romantic relationships were underdeveloped.
Naruto,3ce362,cloistered_around,3,Tue Jul 7 05:09:20 2015 UTC,"You have a fair point. I fully acknowledge that shipping is a very minor part of Naruto and we really should be caring less about who Naruto ends up with when he's in the middle of a war to decide the fate of the entire planet ..but darn it all if who he ends up with isn't more important to me anyway. I know it's irrational given the stakes--but I guess I get more (personally) from the relationships than the action. =/  As far as SasuSasuke goes, though, Even most shippers agree that it doesn't make a whole lot of sense even if they like the pairing. Sakura loves Sasuke just ""because"" (she never says why she likes him aside from ""he's cool""), and Sasuke always said she was annoying or tried to kill her. So there seemed to be almost zero interest on his part. They grew on me a bit during Gaiden, but even then there wasn't a clear romantic relationship between them. Sasuke's largely uninvested."
Naruto,3ce362,alloev,3,Tue Jul 7 17:27:21 2015 UTC,Idk but I was rooting for ChiyoSaku I mean damn what a harsh let down when half of your ship dies. They had so many good moments together. They're the only real romance in Shippuden lbr.  I'm still waiting for Sakura to revive her beloved with forbidden jutsu so they can be 2gethr 5evr.
Naruto,3ce362,Tormound,3,Tue Jul 7 15:59:56 2015 UTC,Because it would insure NaruHina.
Naruto,3ce362,_lanyi,3,Tue Jul 7 17:54:43 2015 UTC,"For me I always accepted their relationship because Sakura is one of the few girls who Sasuke interacts with. Karin's obsession with Sasuke is... creepy. By the end we see that Sakura's feelings for Sasuke have matured and she genuinely cares about him as a teammate and friend instead of just a crush. Anyway I found a Tumblr post that sums it up quite nicely:    What Sasuke feels towards girls...  Ino= Indifference Karin= Indifference, Disgust Any other girls = Indifference Sakura= Annoyance, Anger, Concern, Embarrassment, Worry, Frustration, Surprise, Amusement, Protectiveness, etc... (more in original post)    Basically Sakura gives Sasuke feels."
Naruto,3ce362,Wraxu,2,Wed Jul 8 16:24:18 2015 UTC,"Sauce needed to revive his clan and make some babies, Sakura was always there ready to throw the sauce dat pootang so he obliged. Also in this manga it seems if a girl loves you, you don't have a choice in the matter. Jokes on Sakura though, Sasuke isn't the kissing type it seems and doesn't show his affection the way normal people do."
Naruto,3cb8k8,MoarWolfjob,15,Mon Jul 6 15:39:53 2015 UTC,A recreation of the Orochimaru vs Hiruzen fight where all the characters are as powerful as they were hyped up to be could be cool.
Naruto,3cb8k8,DoubleHunter,3,Mon Jul 6 15:51:57 2015 UTC,"Very true, if only Kishi put as much effort into the actual fight with Hiruzen as he did with hyping him up. Hiruzen got no love :("
Naruto,3cb8k8,DoubleHunter,2,Mon Jul 6 16:07:50 2015 UTC,"Yeah, even after the Hokages got Edo Tenseid Hiruzen was pretty much the only one who didn't get to show off his better techniques. He was just doing shuriken jutsus and waving his magic wand."

Naruto,3ca1s0,InsaneZee,2,Mon Jul 6 18:52:39 2015 UTC,"Do you think Madara asked Obito before giving him a senju arm and leg?  Obito was completely unconscious during that time, Madara could have used that time to put the seal. Did they ever mention Obito knowing about it?"
Naruto,3ca1s0,Keychupp,3,Mon Jul 6 19:05:48 2015 UTC,"Yeah when Madara discovered it had been removed, he realized Obito knew about it and deliberately got rid of it. Chapter 675"
Naruto,3ca1s0,rkellyturbo,2,Mon Jul 6 20:35:21 2015 UTC,"Indeed, I completely forgot that detail. I wonder how he knew though..."
Naruto,3ca1s0,Keychupp,1 point,Mon Jul 6 21:00:28 2015 UTC,Sharingan maybe. He probably noticed at some point that something was restricting him from disobeying Madara.
Naruto,3ca1s0,rkellyturbo,1 point,Tue Jul 7 22:12:44 2015 UTC,Yeah you do have a point. It's just funny picturing it though!
Naruto,3ca1s0,InsaneZee,9,Mon Jul 6 19:49:11 2015 UTC,"This is never stated explicitly but using Almighty push, universal pull, and planetary devastation seem to require a lot of experience with the Rinnegan. Madara could only use a few of those sparingly (assuming he only had the Rinnegan much later in life and transferred them very soon after to Nagato before meeting Obito). It probably requires a long time to master so only Nagato had the Rinnegan long enough to do so.   As for everything else, it makes sense when it is known that he is in the Kamui Dimension. Therefore, Obito cannot phase through attacks like he normally would. Without that, he becomes a much more standard ninja, with a powerful Sharingan. As for the Rinnegan, it does not seem to be of any use to Obito without the other paths of Pain."
Naruto,3ca1s0,acesilver1,5,Mon Jul 6 07:51:02 2015 UTC,"Obito stated that he could use those techniques (any of the Rinnegan techniques), but Kakashi / Naruto / Guy already knew counters to the abilities and those techniques required a lot of chakra and they would be a waste.  The Almighty Push and Universal Pull techniques in particular would come to mind, and they kind of work against his Kamui technique as he would have to solidify to cast the techniques which would leave him vulnerable. Kind of a waste when you have the tailed beasts to work with."
Naruto,3ca1s0,dynrte,1 point,Mon Jul 6 13:45:25 2015 UTC,I don't recall him ever saying he could use those moves. Can you reference the chapter or particular page?
Naruto,3ca1s0,acesilver1,7,Mon Jul 6 14:31:08 2015 UTC,Ugh let me find it.  Here. Guy and Kakashi basically analyze it. Tobi values using the Tailed Beasts over Pain's techniques and it'd be a waste of chakra to use the Pain techniques.
Naruto,3ca1s0,dynrte,2,Mon Jul 6 14:38:46 2015 UTC,"In my opinion, this is a bullshit reason. Just because they know how to counter Deva Path Pein who's only ability is to use the shockwave, doesn't mean that it would have been useless for Obito. They always say ""Every jutsu has a weakness"" but the inability to use an all powerful shockwave 9 out of every 10 seconds isn't a weakness when no one else can use it at all. Plus the ability to steal chakra and summon huge animals is still useful even if they had seen it before.  Edit: Also, the waste of chakra thing isn't valid when one of the abilities steals chakra on touch or absorbs it from jutsu."
Naruto,3ca1s0,AllOfEverythingEver,2,Tue Jul 7 05:26:40 2015 UTC,"In my opinion, you are overlooking a lot of key factors here. And by a lot, I mean a lot. Do you really think controlling Six Tailed Beasts and their Jinchuriki at one time is easy? All of this while simultaneously using Kamui, a Mangekyo Sharingan ability? Obito doesn't have unlimited chakra, dude and at this point he's fighting four extremely good opponents. He has to save chakra for later in the war too. He has superior abilities to the Rinnegan's basic abilities in the Tailed Beasts and he doesn't need to waste unnecessary chakra on techniques that they already know how to counter.  Before you call something out as bullshit, look at the facts. Smh."
Naruto,3ca1s0,dynrte,1 point,Tue Jul 7 05:31:14 2015 UTC,"Alright fair enough. I'll concede that him not using Rinnegan abilities makes some sense, but not for Obito's stated reason of ""you guys know how to counter those"" which is what I was originally arguing."
Naruto,3ca1s0,AllOfEverythingEver,2,Tue Jul 7 13:12:29 2015 UTC,"Also, HOW exactly is Obito supposed to steal chakra in that fight? He'd have to solidify to do it himself, he can't do it through a Jinchuriki because the chakra doesn't go back to him. Smh."
Naruto,3ca1s0,dynrte,1 point,Tue Jul 7 05:32:46 2015 UTC,"Would he actually have to solidify himself? Not saying your wrong, but why would he have to? I know he does to make attacks and things like that, but the chakra absorb isn't always a touch. Obviously he wouldn't be able to do the one where you take people's chakra by touching them, but he may still be able to absorb ninjutsu."
Naruto,3ca1s0,AllOfEverythingEver,1 point,Tue Jul 7 13:14:44 2015 UTC,That was so long ago! I wouldn't have recalled that haha Although it is hard to tell if it is either Obito confirming or Obito bluffing (so that they are always on their guard).
Naruto,3ca1s0,acesilver1,1 point,Mon Jul 6 19:09:08 2015 UTC,It probably requires a long time to master so only Nagato had the Rinnegan long enough to do so.  Sasuke used Planetary Devastation Immediately on the Tailed Beast lol - But then again it is sasuke.
Naruto,3ca1s0,RoyalBlueGuard,8,Mon Jul 6 18:28:41 2015 UTC,"I don't remember Obito really losing that fight? Anyway, Obito only had one Rinnegan and much less accustomed to it than Pain, and Kakashi had strategies against the Six Paths jutsus. Spoilers"
Naruto,3ca1s0,rkellyturbo,5,Mon Jul 6 07:40:26 2015 UTC,He threw the fight for $322
Naruto,3ca1s0,SHINee21,2,Mon Jul 6 14:32:20 2015 UTC,Threw the fight.
Naruto,3ca1s0,HokageEzio,2,Mon Jul 6 12:49:49 2015 UTC,"Does Obito just have his rinnegan for show? Almighty push, universal pull, Planetary devastation? Why didn't he use any of these jutsu?    Obito only had ""one"" Rinnegan, so that won't be enough to do those techniques.    He could have also used the wood style with his senju DNA.    From what I can tell, he wasn't able to grasp the Hashirama's cell. But, he did use it to before to grab Naruto and then got head-butted by Naruto. Moreover, he also attacked with the Mokuton (Wood) with the tails of Jyuubi (Ten-Tails). I also do think that it wasn't easy to control Hashirama's cell. While that Sasuke and Danzo fight, Obito explained it himself that Wood Release is quite hard to control due to the life force within Hashirama's cells, which can easily overwhelm anyone who are using them, just like that moment when Danzo's arm turned into tree when his chakra was depleted by Sasuke.    So why Kakashi was still able to beat Obito? The answer is simple, Obito was hesitating, same for Kakashi (but he got better after seeing Naruto), they were never fighting for real, like that time when they were using Genjutsu."
Naruto,3ca1s0,izn1337,1 point,Mon Jul 6 07:55:21 2015 UTC,Uh. He threw it so that the seal would be unlocked and he could become the ten tails Jinchuriki.
Naruto,3ca1s0,cilllah,0,Tue Jul 7 10:03:59 2015 UTC,There is a reason why Madara wanted someone else to be his heir instead of Obito but he was stuck with Obito due to necessity.

He loves his village more than anything since it's his big brother legacy so he knew what the uchihas were capable of and if you ask me he was partially right.  Most of the uchihas were evil and ready to attack Konoha but that doesn't mean all them were bad: Kagami, Shisui, Obito (before he went crazy over Rin's death), Itachi and even Sasuke before his thrist for revenge.  Tobirama knew that and that's why he decided to keep an eye on them outside of the village by making them join the Konoha police force."

I'm confused; people have been saying instant awakening has been removed and if it's true, I'm definitely not buying the game but just wondering. Oh and is instant awakening still in the game? What about tilt/grab cancels (no clue why they removed those in the first place). Also just more info to add: I don't think the counter mechanic adds damage either, just a knock-back as it always should have been."
Naruto,3c8idu,Gohan_Son,2,Mon Jul 6 01:09:09 2015 UTC,Circle pad as in the 2 joystick thingies haha. Isn't that what it's called?! Oh god I'm a noob.   I like no instant awakening
Naruto,3c8idu,AwesomeDattebayo,1 point,Mon Jul 6 01:34:08 2015 UTC,"Instant awakening is used for combo cancels rather than more power. No instant awakening means no combo cancels. No combo cancels means this game has literally devolved severely into an actual masher. Since they've removed tilt/grab cancels, people are only limited to jutsu and UJ cancels meaning all we have are normal combos, jutsu, and UJ. Matches will be slow and boring and good players will now be forced to play on the same level as those who only mash. It certainly seems for every step CC2 takes forward, they take 5 back. I probably won't buy the game either at this point and this news has killed all of my hype. Thanks so much for your info and sorry for the rant."

Naruto,3c8idu,AwesomeDattebayo,1 point,Mon Jul 6 02:11:45 2015 UTC,Umm do you not remember Generations bro? That game didn't have instant awakenings and it still had a shit ton of good players who somehow made combos last an entire minute (although combos were way longer back then).
Naruto,3c8idu,Jalidric,1 point,Mon Jul 6 07:10:33 2015 UTC,"In Generations, you could also cancel into tilts or grabs which prolong the combos. I don't think anyone is understanding what I am saying. Instant awakening was never necessary before Rev, but since tilt and grab cancels were removed, instant awakening was the only way to get these cancels back. Now that all of it is removed for S4, there are no cancels at all.  That means no more interesting/creative/stylish play and everyone is severely limited. No more of things like this: https://youtu.be/VFVVJf_9apE?t=19s"
Naruto,3c8idu,dirtymindrebel,0,Mon Jul 6 15:28:32 2015 UTC,"ORRRR if you wanna continue your damn combo, just fucking dash at them again while you're doing the combo. Instant awakenings are not needed."
Naruto,3c8idu,dududu9531,-1,Mon Jul 6 06:37:37 2015 UTC,"It's not about continuing your combo it's about variety for chaining attacks. It seems you don't understand at all.  Instant awakening was never necessary before Rev, but since tilt and grab cancels were removed, instant awakening was the only way to get these cancels back.

No more getting creative with combos: https://youtu.be/VFVVJf_9apE?t=19s  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMcL0pP54Yc  So go ahead and downvote but just because you play it to mash doesn't mean everyone wants to play that way. Dashing doesn't have anything to do with cancelling into tilts or grabs so no clue why you'd suggest it. Why you would defend the game actually taking backward steps and removing content is beyond me."
Naruto,3c8idu,Gohan_Son,2,Mon Jul 6 15:30:51 2015 UTC,"Up item is still guard break, I don't like this, not because it's guard break but because I miss the characters having items specific to them, for example, using Sakura's awakening gave you a debuff that doesn't allow you to use her awakening until it's removed, using her previous up item in generations could cleanse that so she could instant awaken again, it made for interesting gameplay, although a lot of these items were just stat boosts.   This!!! I swear, I thought that I was the only person who doesn't like the top item. I definitely agree with how it takes away from each characters ""uniqueness."" Another thing I don't like about the top item and counters is that they have never even been performed in the series. It's just some stupid feature that they decided to put in, and I agree, I wish they brought back the old top items :(  Another thing they should have done is make the bottom item something that relates to (most) people's chakra nature. Now this obviously doesn't count for people like Lee or Sakura since they don't really use offensive ninjutsu, but it would be cool if the down item was an attack that could make Kakashi, Bee, Sasuke, and whoever else had an electric chakra nature send out some kind of electric shockwave of some kind that does 5% damage but maybe 10% or so if it's performed in water which conducts electricity or something. Water chakra nature users such as Kisame, Zabuza, and Suigetsu could send out like 5 rows of waves or something that get faster and perform more damage if preformed on a body of water.   These are just some ideas that I came up with since the new stage feature is going to play a huge part in fights. Pretty excited to see how this plays out."

So to me I keep trying to hold the guard button while jumping to attempt to do a safe air dash, but they removed that in the last game too and I haven't adjusted yet, but other then that, attacks connect well, battle feels the same. Even with having awakenings and ujs and all those supports, I didn't feel like it was too much, if anything it actually made you have to keep track of so many different resources that I think will make the pro players stick out.

Naruto,3c8idu,Kyuubi87,1 point,Mon Jul 6 08:23:12 2015 UTC,"From the videos I've watched, I've noticed a huge damage nerf to the 2 giant awakenings (Kurama and Perfect Susano'o) compared to the E3 build, in which frankly the awakenings hit for absurd amounts of health. I'm still very disappointed by this nerf though, and I do hope that this will change when the game comes out.  Back in Storm 3, a full combo by any Tailed Beast would deal a bit more than half a health bar (about 55-60%), and a Tailed Beast Ball would deal roughly the same amount of damage. This made playing the Tailed Beasts worth it: you feel like a force of destruction capable of instantly vaporizing your opponent, as all Tailed Beasts are meant to be. This didn't even make them overpowered: giant awakenings are basically bigger targets that you can hit to your heart's content, and the low health awakening threshold makes the risks of getting KO'ed while awakened even higher.  Then in Revolution, all the Tailed Beasts got a major damage nerf, and their full combos now do something like 35-40%. Their Tailed Beasts Balls do even less. Kurama in the current build still seems to do pathetic damage, and his Jutsu is even worse than the old one (poor tracking + unable to reliably hit at close range). I barely notice the damage buff from normal Naruto to Kurama, and it seems all Kurama's got is good range, which normal Madara already has.  I just want Kurama to be awesome, damn it!"
Naruto,3c8idu,garrison105,1 point,Mon Jul 6 07:27:27 2015 UTC,"That made them extremely overpowered...jinchurikis would almost desperately try to get you to lower their health so they could immediately do anything they could to awaken. Once awakened, they would punch and back up. The small character attempting to combat it is small therefore lacks range. They can't hit the bijuu and the bijuu repeats this. Once far enough away though, they'll mostly spam you with unavoidable bijuu bombs until you drop. It's a good thing they got nerfed and I'm glad to see perfect susanoo has a lot of mobility."
Naruto,3c8idu,Gohan_Son,1 point,Mon Jul 6 17:08:19 2015 UTC,"It's a matter of opinion and personal experience, I guess. I've been able to consistently deal with the Tailed Beasts, unless I'm up against an opponent who's already better than I am. I never once felt like it's game over only because my opponent has bijuu awakening.  For one, awakening into the Tailed Beast in the first place is already a difficult thing to do. If your opponent gets some pressure on you and is intent on not letting you awaken, it's almost impossible to do so unless you've got good support and know how to use them. With good support, you can win a match without having ever awakened at all. Next, once you've turned into a Tailed Beast, you have only about half a health bar to work with, and your awakening doesn't last very long. The opponent then has 2 strategies, depending on what you do: they can attack you relentlessly with the help of their supports, or they can just stall for time. The Tailed Beast Bomb is very hard to avoid, but totally safe to block - it's not gonna hit a skilled opponent unless he's caught off-guard. As for close range combat, your opponent has the annoying tendency of subbing right above you, allowing them to to do an air combo out of your reach (I'm not sure if this has been fixed in the newer games though). If the opponent keeps on subbing then chakra dashing right into you, it's very easy for them to overwhelm you, especially with their supports. Basically, what in saying is that even though the Tailed Beasts have overwhelming offensive abilities, their defenses are piss poor, and they can be taken down very quickly (especially if they neglect to block, which a lot of players do).  At least we can agree on one thing: perfect Susano'o seems to have good mobility. He attacks pretty quickly too, which for now makes him vastly superior to Kurama. I can already point out 2 things.   Kurama's second hit (the giant hand slam) comes out very slowly. If the first hit connects, then it stuns your opponent long enough for the second hit to connect as well. If the first hit misses, however, the opponent can move around to escape the second blow. This isn't the case with Susano'o, whose second attack comes out very quickly, which can easily catch the enemy. Kurama's last hit in his combo (the one where he backflips and throws a tailed beast ball) won't happen unless the previous hit connects. Basically, again, shit damage. Susano'o's last hit (the flying Amaterasu) will always come out, and it seems it can hit opponents well beyond the range of the normal sword combo.   I just want Kurama to be awesome :("
Naruto,3c8idu,Bolded,1 point,Mon Jul 6 17:39:16 2015 UTC,"Arguing about a game mechanic is the last thing I want to do but ok.   For one, awakening into the Tailed Beast in the first place is already a difficult thing to do.   Not at all. All you have to do in order to awaken is get the opponent down for a few seconds or even pre-occupy them for a few seconds. What a lot of people do is throw an explosive tag. If the opponent does not immediately sub, they can and will awaken.    Next, once you've turned into a Tailed Beast, you have only about half a health bar to work with, and your awakening doesn't last very long.   The awakening lasts long enough, if you're evenly matched, your opponent isn't unscathed so it's not like they'd have a ton more health than you, and the awakening lasts long enough. You only need a very small amount of time to knock of tons of health.    The opponent then has 2 strategies, depending on what you do: they can attack you relentlessly with the help of their supports, or they can just stall for time.   There is attacking relentlessly essentially mashing the attack button but this can be easily stopped. They sub, and reappear blocking. Your combo ends and they ninja-move backwards out of your range. Their range is greater than yours and they hit you with their combo, rinse repeat. If you get too far away, you're dead.   The Tailed Beast Bomb is very hard to avoid, but totally safe to block - it's not gonna hit a skilled opponent unless he's caught off-guard.   The TBB breaks your guard in two hits...one if you're in the air and almost impossible to avoid.   If the opponent keeps on subbing then chakra dashing right into you, it's very easy for them to overwhelm you   No, that's actually a really terrible plan. That's how you eat all of your subs and all the TB has to do is wait for your combo to be over and back up out of your reach.  Perfect susanoo is looking fantastic and pretty quick. It almost functions like a normal player just on a larger scale with its jumping and shuriken."
Naruto,3c8idu,sawada91,1 point,Mon Jul 6 19:15:57 2015 UTC,I agree that arguing over game mechanics at this point is meaningless. I'll just stop right here.  Perfect Susano'o seems pretty awesome indeed.

Naruto,3c9nb1,redditrandomacc,2,Mon Jul 6 04:34:07 2015 UTC,Shit they could have targeted Naruto for being Kushina's son instead. The idea of Naruto having that special chakra would be a wet dream for Kumo.
Naruto,3c9nb1,kaito0,1 point,Mon Jul 6 18:48:32 2015 UTC,Being Uzumaki didn't mean he was her son. Seeing as how Uzumaki were apparently known for being brough over to become the 9tails jinchuriki. (Kushina wasn't Mito's daughter in this same respect)  But being the only Namikaze is a dead give away lol.
Naruto,3c9nb1,CelticDK,20,Mon Jul 6 19:22:31 2015 UTC,Security reasons.  The third did not want Minato's enemies coming for Naruto.
Naruto,3c9nb1,HokageEzio,22,Mon Jul 6 05:12:52 2015 UTC,Naruto Namikaze sounds cool as hell.
Naruto,3c9nb1,Doxtator007,8,Mon Jul 6 05:26:04 2015 UTC,"If I'm not mistaken, the 3rd didn't want Naruto to know that he was related to a Hokage when he grew up, so giving him the Uzumaki name was an easy choice in that regard. Also Minato was very well known, and revenge/hate can sometimes extend to the next generation, meaning 'bad' people could have gone after Naruto for just being his son."
Naruto,3c9nb1,Kyuubi87,5,Mon Jul 6 11:14:03 2015 UTC,"I have never understood how surnames/clan names work in the Naruto world.   Naruto is obviously an Uzumaki and not a Namikaze because the series shows that Naruto has larger chakra levels (as Uzumaki's do).   But I also had thought that the child took the clan of their father.... As Spoilers  Honestly, I just can't ever understand how any of this clan stuff works. It was never really explained."
Naruto,3c9nb1,Rosaline898,2,Mon Jul 6 14:29:49 2015 UTC,"Kishi never elaborates on it, is the problem. Clearly somewhere Hinata was called Uzumaki Hinata, but we won't know if that was official until the databook for Boruto: Naruto the Movie is released."
Naruto,3c9nb1,kaito0,1 point,Mon Jul 6 18:46:49 2015 UTC,But that messes up the purpose of her surname... Because she is definitely not an Uzumaki... Weird.
Naruto,3c9nb1,Rosaline898,2,Mon Jul 6 21:43:55 2015 UTC,"I meant after they got married, she possibly adopted his surname, instead of staying Hyuga Hinata.  I'm not going to say I understand how surnames in Japanese society work, or even if that's how Kishimoto intended them to work in the series, but I read somewhere that if the woman's family name has a higher standing than the man's family she would keep her family name and depending on the circumstances the man may adopt it himself, and if not the children would inherit the surname with higher social standing if allowed by whoever the head of the household at the time is.  Someone will have to either confirm or deny that what I said makes any sense or is bullshit."
Naruto,3c9nb1,kaito0,0,Mon Jul 6 22:23:21 2015 UTC,"It is still a bit odd, because let's say a Hyuuga and an Uchiha got married. They had a child, and it was born with the Byakugan.   I am not 100% sure which of those clans is stronger, or higher ranked, but for example purposes lets say Uchiha is higher.   So this child was born with the byakugan, but just because the Uchiha is the higher rank doesn't mean they are then named an Uchiha...   And same with the parents. If the mother has the byakugan, and the father is an Uchiha with the sharingan, it doesn't work to change the surname of the wife to Uchiha if they clearly have the byakugan.   Ugh, this is all so confusing... Maybe it's time to drop this topic, but if you are still up for discussing, I could discuss this all day! :)"
Naruto,3c9nb1,Rosaline898,1 point,Tue Jul 7 04:45:08 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately that was the extent of my knowledge on family surnames in Japanese society. And I'm not even sure if it's correct, or not.

Naruto,3c9nb1,dynrte,-1,Mon Jul 6 04:56:39 2015 UTC,"then why? if you say to protect him against being targeted for being the former hokage's son, that's still his mother's maiden name, it's no secret who minatos wife was, and her being the only uzumaki in the leaf village, it's not hard to put two and two together to know naruto is minatos kid."
Naruto,3c9nb1,onederful,6,Mon Jul 6 05:38:51 2015 UTC,There's no indication that anybody from the other villages knew that Kushina was Minato's wife. We haven't even seen them on any missions together.
Naruto,3c9nb1,dynrte,3,Mon Jul 6 05:49:25 2015 UTC,I mean the 4th Raikage clearly knew Kushina was Naruto's mother as he literally says as much when he meets Naruto and Bee before they enter the war.

Naruto,3c9nb1,kaito0,2,Mon Jul 6 18:49:29 2015 UTC,"Potentially, but I don't see Naruto's parentage being something of the utmost importance to discuss when Tsunade had only very recently awoken from a coma and there was a war to plan.  I would imagine the marrying of a Hokage would be common knowledge in the village, and it's likely every village had spies in other villages.  If the Raikage can know about the Tsuchikage employing Akatsuki secretely, he can likely know that the 4th Hokage was married to Kushina."
Naruto,3c9nb1,Baruu,0,Mon Jul 6 20:18:20 2015 UTC,"by the same regard, there was no inclination that she was kept hidden either. also, uzumaki mito was the first's wife as she wasn't kept hidden either, and it seems everyone knew that tsunade was the firsts granddaughter and wasn't taboo to mention it at all, so clearly it didn't bear too much importance to keep family ties a secret. only secret that was kept for the longest time was that naruto was the new jinchuriki of the nine tails."
Naruto,3c9nb1,onederful,1 point,Mon Jul 6 05:59:03 2015 UTC,Tsunade was alive during the same time as the 1st so there's no way to hide them being related when they obviously spend time together

It was stated that the reason Naruto took his mother's last name was because his father made many enemies (killing 1000 Iwa nin in one battle). Nothing states or indicates that anyone from other villages knew Kushina was Minato's wife therefore we cannot assume it was common knowledge.   Tsunade went around saying she was the first's granddaughter and apparently resembled him as Madara was able to point it out.  For the other family ties, it's usually father/mother and their children as they look the same and bear the name of their clan. Husbands and wives are different as when they are not members of the same clan they look different and Kushina never took Minato's name. Probably for a good reason.  Nothing in universe states that Naruto took Kushina's name because the clan is ""more prestigious"". Also, the Uzumaki was a big clan and was known to have spread out since they lost their village."
Naruto,3c9nb1,dynrte,0,Mon Jul 6 06:03:58 2015 UTC,"about the resemblance thing, you do realize that naruto looks a hell of a lot like minato, in fact pointed out several times throughout the series. Idk where you got the point about kushina's clan being more pretigious, i didn't mention that.Lastly i hadn't downvoted your comment, as if i cared that much, as proof. check it again. now i did."
Naruto,3c9nb1,onederful,5,Mon Jul 6 06:09:39 2015 UTC,"You were defending the guy who said Kushina's clan is more prestigious and said ""then why?"". We know as a fact that the reason he took his mother's last name was to hide him from Minato's enemies."
Naruto,3c9nb1,dynrte,4,Mon Jul 6 06:14:47 2015 UTC,Kishi didn't plan it ahead. I was thinking about a month ago....to some extent the ninjas from Kakashi's generation really should'nt have looked down on Naruto so much since I'm pretty positive majority should've known who is father was.
Naruto,3c9nb1,ruthmi88,1 point,Mon Jul 6 06:07:30 2015 UTC,"I don't think they did look down on him so much for being a jinchuriki, but more so for being a prankster."
Naruto,3c9nb1,kaito0,1 point,Mon Jul 6 18:50:15 2015 UTC,"I figured that too but I also thought that could've thought ""never thought Naruto could do this....then again he is the son of Minato"" but that would've ruined the mystery~ of his lineage."
Naruto,3c9nb1,ruthmi88,0,Mon Jul 6 19:21:38 2015 UTC,"yeah that's what i was getting at, it's no secret that kishi changed direction after the first few years/time skip. so there's some things that are left a bit blurry."
Naruto,3c9nb1,onederful,0,Mon Jul 6 06:11:10 2015 UTC,Yeah I mentioned this in another post but how come Naruto and Sasuke were never put in that orphanage?? The original series made it like they were alone from the start! Also how come the 3rd Hokage never adopted Naruto since he knew the 4th. Kakashi and Jiraiya always knew who Naruto's parents were....why didn't they ever check up on Naruto?? LOL see like Kishi didn't realize he should've payed attention to the minor details and he didn't think things through/plan it out.
Naruto,3c9nb1,ruthmi88,2,Mon Jul 6 06:18:34 2015 UTC,"All of this can be explained without much difficulty. Why wasn't he in the orphanage? He probably was, at least to begin with. But he was still 'the demon brat' and they didn't want him. Why wasn't he adopted? Well... Let's look at the possibilities there. Jiraiya, Kakashi and Hiruzen.  Jiraiya is probably the likeliest possibility. However, then he would have to settle down in Konoha. That would mean Konoha lost a major resource in the form of Jiraiya's spy network. Could he have taken Naruto with him? Possibly, but that would have been really risky. If anyone discovered who he was, or what he contained not even Jiraiya could have protected him forever.  Kakashi. He is in no shape to take care of a child. You all know his lifestory, so I shouldn't have to explain why.  Hiruzen. Probably the most fit of the three. He stay's in Konoha, and is not hindered by grief, guilt or other feelings. There are a few problems however. One. He is the hokage. This would have been the case if Minato was alive as well, but Naruto would still have his mother. The hokage is very busy, and has a lot of responsibilities that makes them mostly unfit to be parental figures. Still, this is better than the alternative though. Right? Not necessarily. There is a fanfiction which takes up the issue much better than I can. ""Life in Konoha ANBU"" Essentially, the ninja world is not a great place to raise kids. Lonely, emotionaly stunted orphans might be better than child assassins. It would have forced Naruto to grow up fast, to lose his childhood in a sense.  Also, why do you think Kushina's and Minato's relationship was well known? If it wasn't outright stated, it was at least implied that they were seeing each other in secret. Yes, they married, but that coulf also quite easily have happened with only a few people knowing about it.  Much of Naruto's storyline is blurry, things that are not fully explained. Most of these things can be explained quite logically however. There are a lot of orphans in the shinobi world, and being a jinchuriki does not help. The fact that he is the yellow flash's son is detrimental everywhere but in Konoha and even then, that fact only increse the already considerable danger he is in. It's safer if no one knows."

Naruto,3c9nb1,ajtpak,4,Mon Jul 6 06:30:33 2015 UTC,In Japan its traditional give the child the stronger clan's name which in this case is uzumaki
Naruto,3c9nb1,IndigoCup,1 point,Mon Jul 6 07:45:05 2015 UTC,Uzimaki is probably more prestigious but I dont think we've met enough Namikaze members to know which clan is straight up stronger.  We know one of em became hogake but a sample size of one is pretty bad.
Naruto,3c9nb1,BioshockedNinja,4,Mon Jul 6 09:01:53 2015 UTC,"If the Uzumaki was strong enough to A) be direct allies of the Senju, B) have their symbol on every Konoha flak jacket and C) the Namikaze clan being nothing important enough to reference (might not even be a clan), I think we're pretty sure..."

Naruto,3c9nb1,ruthmi88,1 point,Mon Jul 6 19:25:10 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying a lot of these guys are wrong, but the main reason was to protect naruto because minato was a very feared man and many nations had grudges against him. Also a lot of you guys are forgetting that not a lot of people knew kushina was pregnant, just a select few."
Naruto,3c9nb1,lVlulcan,1 point,Tue Jul 7 04:02:39 2015 UTC,Kishimoto didn't know His parents name at the start of the manga would be my guess.  does anyone even know what chapter Minato and kushina are first mentioned by name? I'm pretty sure its well into shippuden.

Naruto,3c9mvs,JeSuisFoxyTrot,4,Mon Jul 6 06:14:39 2015 UTC,"Obito actually said that he could use those abilities, but it would be a waste of chakra as Kakashi and Naruto already knew counters for those abilities. In the case of Obito specifically, the push / pull ability doesn't work very well with his intangibility."
Naruto,3c9mvs,dynrte,2,Mon Jul 6 06:17:37 2015 UTC,Obito - He was busy keeping control of the Bijuu and possibly because he only had one eye  Madara - He did use Deva Path to create those meteors   Sasuke - Similar to Madara Spoilers
Naruto,3c9mvs,night4345,3,Mon Jul 6 06:01:02 2015 UTC,"I think that while Rinnegan gives you acess to ""X"" powers, you need ""learn"" them to tap into the powers, if that makes sense."
Naruto,3c9mvs,Lulcielid,2,Mon Jul 6 14:52:55 2015 UTC,Both Madara and Sasuke used the preta path powers as well.
Naruto,3c9mvs,WorkplaceWatcher,2,Mon Jul 6 21:34:04 2015 UTC,"If you learned to breath flames, could you instantly weave complicated patterns and summon a fully animated dragon? No. In short. Practice. Obito had like, 1 day. We have no idea how long Madra had. Probably not that long, and with a body that couldn't take much training. Sasuke didn't have any training at all. Preta path seems to be the most instinctual and easiest to use. The gravity techniques is probably pretty instinctual as well, however to what degree is unknown."
Naruto,3c9mvs,Caliburn0,1 point,Mon Jul 6 18:49:35 2015 UTC,"This.  Madara died soon after unlocking it, then regained it during the same fight. Yet he still had the mastery that he did.  Only Nagato had a very long time with it and even only after becoming an Edo (inifinite chakra/regen) could he actually do it all together in one body. (Hell maybe even absorbing the 9tails and 8tails chakra even played a part in it)"

Naruto,3ca2h8,Sfogle11,10,Mon Jul 6 07:37:58 2015 UTC,"I don't like when people say ""Part 1 fights were so much better because they were more strategic"" because fights in Part 2 never stopped being strategic. They just added DBZ-like moments with strategic moments and everyone just remembers big explosions and immediately assume Part 2 Naruto went full DBZ. In fact, as I'm recalling all the fights throughout the war, against the juubi, and against Obito and Madara, there were very few DBZ moments and nearly all of them included strategy. The DBZ moments were only when they had to divert/block bijuu bombs"
Naruto,3ca2h8,AbidingTruth,2,Mon Jul 6 09:50:58 2015 UTC,"I agree with you to an extent. There are a few instances where it was pretty dbz status. I think the pain invasion was a good example. And I don't see how the battles with madara were very strategic.   BUT you are right in that it isn't ALL dbz. Most if not all of the fights involving akatsuki were very strategic, from the get go of shippuden. The thing is that it's a bit of a shift for the reader/watcher of the anime because the original series was very underpowered and focused a lot on hidden clones and plans. Shippuden lost a lot of that intricacy in battle, so I can understand why people feel that way."
Naruto,3ca2h8,Neural_groove,2,Mon Jul 6 12:16:09 2015 UTC,I think the pain arc was really good even though it was all big explosions. It kinda had to be for what was happening
Naruto,3ca2h8,Neural_groove,1 point,Mon Jul 6 14:28:59 2015 UTC,I agree. Just because it's less strategic doesn't necessary make it worse.   Personally I've gone back and rewatched the two hour pain fight like atleast 3 times. The part where pain uses chibaku tensei to seal the kyuubi...fuuuuuu  so sick.
Naruto,3ca2h8,AbidingTruth,2,Mon Jul 6 15:07:39 2015 UTC,"I never said it was better, I just said it was  completely different. And I kinda disagree because once madara stepped on the battlefield it was all about big jutsus and explosions"
Naruto,3ca2h8,Neural_groove,16,Mon Jul 6 14:27:40 2015 UTC,"Tagging /u/Neural_groove so I don't have to comment twice  I disagree with your disagreeing that once Madara came in it was all big jutsus and explosions. Or, if you did want to state that, there were a lot of big jutsus, but they did still use strategy.

Naruto,3c8tag,uriel_777,15,Sun Jul 5 23:46:35 2015 UTC,"The best written characters with the most complex motives are Itachi and Obito.   Sasuke is also a well-written character despite what people say about his actions. Sasuke has by far suffered the most psychological trauma and abuse in the series and had a lot of bad influences in his life (Orochimaru, Obito).  But since Obito is the coolest guy, I'll go with Obito as the best character."
Naruto,3c8tag,dynrte,2,Mon Jul 6 01:07:44 2015 UTC,You are correct.
Naruto,3c8tag,cilllah,2,Mon Jul 6 03:26:19 2015 UTC,I don't get why people say a character is badly written based on their actions in the plot. He was supposed to not be liked during those times... It's not bad writing
Naruto,3c8tag,argonia,1 point,Mon Jul 6 13:45:23 2015 UTC,Because Naruto fans are all obviously professional writing critics. Sarcasm.  Every time something happens in Naruto that they don't like one of the first responses they come up with is a shot at Kishimoto or his writing.
Naruto,3c8tag,dynrte,1 point,Mon Jul 6 13:48:54 2015 UTC,It doesn't matter if a character is supposed to be liked or disliked if the actions of said character are out of character and/or not well build up.
Naruto,3c8tag,DoubleHunter,1 point,Mon Jul 6 14:39:26 2015 UTC,"Fiction is one of those things in which the author needs to find the proper halfway between realism and entertainment. The characters should feel alive. Their motivations should be believable... but they should also be entertaining.. And that's very subjective.   To use A Song of Ice and Fire as an example, one could say that the biggest flaw of the A Feast for Crows was just this. It focused too much on the realism. The complicated yet realistic family affairs in Dorne between Arianne and her father. Brienne going through the Riverlands to find Sansa when the reader knows that Brienne has no chances of finding her. A Feast for Crows is not a badly written book by any stretch of imagination. It's just not as entertaining as the others.  Sasuke is A Feast for Crows. Belieavable and fairly realistic in terms of Narutoverse. But compared to many of the other characters, he's just not entertaining. And I'm not talking likability. I can dislike a character while being entertained by the character."
Naruto,3c8tag,jonske94,1 point,Tue Jul 7 13:02:41 2015 UTC,Do you think that Sasuke's motives after the final fight with Naruto were believeable?
Naruto,3c8tag,DoubleHunter,1 point,Tue Jul 7 14:05:44 2015 UTC,"It was stretching it. But then again, a lot of the motives in Narutoverse are stretching it. In my opinion, it was just a bit too neat but it was the most entertaining and satisfying chapter about Sasuke for me since pre-time skip chapters.  Which kind of brings me back to the realism/believability vs. entertainment point I made. It usually boils down to how much it entertains me. I can tolerate unrealistic and unbelievable events if I'm entertained by them. But it's harder to tolerate realistic and belieavable events if I'm not entertained by them. I think it's fairly universal but as I said previously, it's also very subjective. So that's my weird almost non-answer. To be frank, it has been a while since I read the manga. I'm kind of hazy on the excact details of Sasuke's motivations after the final fight."
Naruto,3c8tag,jonske94,1 point,Tue Jul 7 14:39:38 2015 UTC,"To me it kinda sounds like you're talking about guilty pleasures.  Oh, and thanks for giving me a mature and thoughtful answer. Your two post on this thread are by far the most intelligent posts I've read on this subreddit so far."
Naruto,3c8tag,DoubleHunter,1 point,Tue Jul 7 14:51:36 2015 UTC,"Thanks! And I guess you're right about the point about guilty pleasures. The whole concept of guilty pleasures is fascinating to me. I never got into The Wire even though I think it's genuinely a good show.. Atleast the two seasons I watched. If it's on TV, I'm not going to change the channel but it just never grabbed me. Then there's shows like The Walking Dead that are just profoundly mediocre... And I still can't stop watching. Despite actively sighing at some of the developments. I don't know, whatever! Opinions are interesting!"
Naruto,3c8tag,jonske94,1 point,Tue Jul 7 15:11:19 2015 UTC,"That's funny, because for me it's the opposite. I stopped watching The Walking Dead years ago and I think that the the 3rd and 4th seasons of The Wire might be my favorite seasons of TV ever."

Naruto,3c8tag,Neural_groove,9,Mon Jul 6 12:23:45 2015 UTC,"Orochimaru. He's a very interesting kind of bad guy.  Most bad guys appear to create a problem for the hero, only exist in relation to the hero, and die or go away when their arc is resolved. You see it with a whole bunch of villains in Naruto. Zabuza, Pain, Sasori, etc.  Orochimaru though, he's one of the very few that gives the feeling that he really has his own life. He bumps into Naruto pretty much randomly, and isn't even interested in him. He's got lots of side interests and projects, Sasuke just happens to be the one that concerns the main characters the most. He has dealings with other characters, and very long term plans that aren't relevant to the main plot.  He's not a nice person, but he's not pointlessly evil, he's working towards something. And he's got an interesting personality."
Naruto,3c8tag,dale_glass,7,Mon Jul 6 00:29:50 2015 UTC,"imho it would be naruto but i guess that's the obvious answer so my secondary would be either Hinata or Gaara.  Gaara I think went through the most thorough and radical character development more than almost any other character. He went from a feared despised bloodlusting murderous-weapon for the Sand, into a universally respected female eye-candy shinobi war-leader and kazekage. It's almost unbelievable how much he turned around.  Hinata I think because her struggle was more internal that her development can get overlooked but I think what made hinata special to me as a character was not only did she grow to be more bold and more assertive but she also inhereted Naruto's ninja way. She dedicated her life to living as Naruto lived. Even as I type that I get tears in my eye, because that's just whole 'nother level of resolve in my opinion.   The greatest shinobi is the one with the greatest resolve. If excluding Naruto, Hinata & Gaara are definitely candidates."
Naruto,3c8tag,walta_,3,Mon Jul 6 01:48:40 2015 UTC,"I agree with Gaara, but Hinata is highly overrated.  We're speaking of characters here, so let's look at Hinata as a character. She has a short story arc in the pre-shippuuden series where she has a problem with her family, specifically, Neji. That gets resolved. After that, she pretty much ceases to exist except in very brief intervals, and has no existence besides how she relates to Naruto. Even that is scarce. She doesn't even get to have a normal conversation with him in the whole series. After her confession, nothing comes out of it for ages. Once she marries Naruto, she's just Naruto's wife.  She's more of a placeholder for a character than a character, really. Remove Naruto and there's nothing left of her. And that impressive change in her personality is really implied, and not really seen being developed. It's easy to make dramatic changes in a character's personality if you forego all of character development and just show snapshots years apart with no explanation of how things got there."

Naruto,3c8tag,tixrain,6,Mon Jul 6 12:53:51 2015 UTC,"Jiraiya, he was a character who was sometimes really silly but once he got into a serious battle he was focused. His prominence in the show meant that his death was an extremely sad moment, the most sad moment in the show in my opinion. The commentary before he dies in his dead is also really sad because he has completely accepted death when nobody else HAS. He also was a major part of the story to Naruto instilling the ideals of peace to him and giving Naruto a Father figure for part of his life (however short it may have been). He was my favourite character.  Also spoiler tag your post."
Naruto,3c8tag,Legovil,1 point,Sun Jul 5 23:50:24 2015 UTC,"I think a lot of characters had accepted their death before they died. 3rd Hokage comes to mind, and the 1st Hokage when he says he would kill himself when Madara asked him to. Or whatever that situation was, he said he would without hesitation. Itachi too, he accepted that shit a loooong time before he died."
Naruto,3c8tag,13ig13oss,0,Sun Jul 5 23:56:54 2015 UTC,"When the Sandaime died it was early on and we knew nothing about him really and hadn't connected. When Itachi died we generally thought he was a mass murdering baguette (although I thought there was something odd with the massacre). The Shodaime was also somebody who while we knew about him, we didn't really relate that much like Jiraiya."

Naruto,3c8tag,Legovil,1 point,Mon Jul 6 00:12:13 2015 UTC,"It's the picture for the topic as talking about the characters could have spoilers.

Naruto,3c8tag,DoubleHunter,4,Mon Jul 6 00:51:15 2015 UTC,"OP people are gonna pick their favorite character.  My picks for best character is either Itachi or Tobirama. The former honestly being the embodiment of a shinobi throughout the series (I don't even like Itachi that much).  Tobirama mostly because he's pretty complex. I feel like he is very flawed but wanted the best for the leaf (but not the Uchiha, which IMO was his biggest mistake). He's just really neat because for every good thing he does there is also something bad. Very interesting dichotomy.   Edit: Jesus Christ what happened to this thread. Almost every one is at 0."

Naruto,3c8tag,JeSuisFoxyTrot,2,Mon Jul 6 00:29:09 2015 UTC,Shinobi throw away their feelings to complete the mission.  Danzo does just that.

And im saying that despite Itachi being my favorite character.

His character design is awesome.  In terms of character development and growth, Shimakaru got quite a good one during his arc  Backstory wise, Gaara and Neji has pretty good back stories"
Naruto,3c8tag,maurodsimone,1 point,Mon Jul 6 04:00:20 2015 UTC,Nagato and Itachi are the obvious choices. I dont see anyone choosing kakashi though and I think he has one of the best character development

Naruto,3c8tag,DoubleHunter,1 point,Tue Jul 7 05:24:31 2015 UTC,Best backstory: Itachi  Best design: Madara  Best developed character: Shikamaru  The overall best character: Danzo
Naruto,3c8tag,Neural_groove,1 point,Mon Jul 6 10:12:10 2015 UTC,Why do you think shikamaru is the best developed?
Naruto,3c8tag,maurodsimone,3,Mon Jul 6 12:29:14 2015 UTC,"He's the character who matures the most during the course of the story. He starts the series as a lazy kid who's reluctant to do anything and ends it as a fully matured adult willing to do what is to him a ""troublesome"" job for the sake of the people he cares about. He also develops/has well written relationships with characters like Temari, Shikaku, Choji, Naruto and Asuma. Then when he loses people he's attached to he goes through loss and revenge without becoming a ridiculously emo character. He also doesn't do drastic out of character 180 personality changes like certain other characters."
Naruto,3c8tag,DoubleHunter,2,Mon Jul 6 13:06:11 2015 UTC,"Ohh, so for you he's more grounded and realistic than the other characters. So he's more relatable and hence more well developed. I get you."
Naruto,3c8tag,Dosu_Kinuta,1 point,Mon Jul 6 13:47:13 2015 UTC,Best overall character Danzo? Are you high?

Naruto,3c9yuo,Thr0s,2,Mon Jul 6 09:03:23 2015 UTC,"If you remember what you've seen, then you could go straight to Shippuden. After the battle between Naruto vs Sasuke at the Valley of the End and Sasuke goes to Orochimaru, that's pretty much the end of part 1, there's just one episode showing Naruto leaving with Jiraiya to train for two and a half years.  Some fillers get reaally bad, others are decent and some fans do like them. It's up to you really. The thing about Naruto fillers, especially during Shippuden, is that they actually did try to make the filler relevant to the canon parts coming up. That is until the war arc where it was almost always filler from a flashback to like the second time Sakura and co took the chuunin exams or some shit"
Naruto,3c9yuo,AbidingTruth,1 point,Mon Jul 6 06:58:37 2015 UTC,"I would say it's worth finishing regular naruto first. If you remember most of it there's no need to restart. The original naruto really helps build emotional context for a lot of fights and events that occur in shippuden.   Also it's pick and choose with fillers. I'd say 70% of filler isn't worth watching, but there are many fillers ESPECIALLY in shippuden that are AHmazing. Some filler go back and shed light on backstories for very important characters and really build character and depth.   Bottom line: finish naruto before shippuden. Skip filler only if it's crap."

I still read it but the story feels forced and as if it's simply trying to reach 700 chapters to compete with Naruto & OP. Fairy Tail has surpassed it as far as shonen in my eyes.   To the OP, I would just wiki what you've seen and start up with Shippuden. Not like there aren't hours of recap."

If you liked the kakashi one then i also suggest you watch the ramen filler,laughing shino and that with the bearlike creature whose name i cant remember."

Also keep in mind that it was during the portion of SAO that was actually pretty decent before we traversed into fairy world and edgy gunplay.  EDIT: Also, where is Berserk on this list?  I'm also disappointed Ichigo vs Byakuya didn't make it.  HxH (2011) isnt even on there and they had a few fights for contention (Meruem vs Netero, Gon vs Hisoka, or Gon vs Neferpitou would've been acceptable)."
Naruto,3c5s8h,dynrte,3,Sun Jul 5 11:42:44 2015 UTC,"As far as Ichigo vs Byakuya goes, I wouldn't even expect it to be on the list... Bleach hasn't been popular in years and even when it was I'm sure that fans would vote for Ichigo vs Ulquiorra or Ichigo vs Aizen."
Naruto,3c5s8h,maytagem,1 point,Sun Jul 5 16:46:55 2015 UTC,Yeah this exact conversation comes up every couple of months. That fight wasn't the best in the series let alone all time. Add in the fact that it wasn't really concluded and it's easy to see why this fight isn't top 10.
Naruto,3c5s8h,GoVorteX,1 point,Sun Jul 5 18:30:30 2015 UTC,Why? The original first part of SAO was fantastic.
Naruto,3c5s8h,dynrte,1 point,Mon Jul 6 01:06:39 2015 UTC,"""Fantastic""  Going to disagree there. Kirito is the most generic cookie-cutter Mary Sue protagonist in all of recent anime and the story had so much potential and fell flat. It would have been better if it didn't go the harem fan-service route and actually fleshed out Kirito's character more to make him believable.  The first few episodes of the series were good. After that it went terribly downhill. Good examples of what the series could have been are seen throughout SAO 1 and 2. The Moonlit Black Cats were good and the Laughing Coffin guild could have made for some very interesting storytelling.  Heathcliff was also not fleshed out enough before the big reveal and the way Kirito defeated him was really lame.   Alfheim Online was atrocious and so was all of SAO 2.  If we're going to talk about the best fights ever, Kirito vs Heathcliff comes nowhere close."

There are some that are probably correct, but in order to keep continuity with the events of the story, I think that there is an error of a few years.    There was a thread a few days ago where I pulled apart the ages of the Rain orphans and Obito from the databooks, and if those ages were correct, then Yahiko died at least 2 years before Obito came into contact with him.    Since Kishimoto wrote the databooks, the ages are technically correct, but there are definite inconsistencies that show that they should be accepted tentatively or as an estimated age. I mistakenly worded that first post to seem like it was an absolute, but I still think that Minato and Kushina were pretty young when they died."

Naruto,3c7bp5,Jmqt,3,Sun Jul 5 18:13:39 2015 UTC,"Well he didn't actually lose his legs, just the use of them. So my guess is even with hashi cells for legs he wouldn't be able to use them."
Naruto,3c7bp5,Waterbeetles,3,Sun Jul 5 20:51:23 2015 UTC,I think he's asking why didn't they amputate his leg and give him the artificial one
Naruto,3c7bp5,DustyMill,2,Mon Jul 6 03:48:06 2015 UTC,"Just remove his leg and make a new one for him. they can manage it, it's not that delicate. They're removing their eyes and just putting them back anyways, eyes are more delicate than legs. x)"
Naruto,3c7bp5,Jmqt,2,Mon Jul 6 06:54:38 2015 UTC,They did...
Naruto,3c7bp5,HokageEzio,2,Sun Jul 5 22:05:14 2015 UTC,really? o.o then why is he still in a wheel chair.
Naruto,3c7bp5,Jmqt,2,Mon Jul 6 06:52:27 2015 UTC,Having an artificial leg doesn't mean he's walking everywhere.  In the book he was seen walking once I think.
Naruto,3c7bp5,HokageEzio,2,Mon Jul 6 07:10:22 2015 UTC,"Well Danzo had some of his DNA,which was not impossible for him to get since was his superior and died during his lifespan. Orochimaru probably got it from him while helping him with his arm, and implemented it in Yamato. Madara got his from the the battle vs the first, which were then given to Zetzu and tobi ... so technically noone ever had to rob his grave"
Naruto,3c7bp5,simc0,2,Sun Jul 5 20:44:07 2015 UTC,Didn't he get that arm after the Uchiha Massacre therefore meaning that Orochimaru used the DNA prior to creating the arm.
Naruto,3c7bp5,Legovil,1 point,Sun Jul 5 21:17:28 2015 UTC,Nowhere to be found or Kabuto would have Edo Tensei'd him.  His body is already gone from the first round by Orochimaru.
Naruto,3c7bp5,HokageEzio,11,Sun Jul 5 15:57:53 2015 UTC,"Wasn't that impossible, since Kabuto didn't know how to get Hashirama's soul out of the belly of the Death God?"
Naruto,3c7bp5,DoubleHunter,1 point,Sun Jul 5 16:37:24 2015 UTC,"We just said the same thing.  Kabuto wouldn't be able to find the body in Part 2, because Orochimaru found and wasted his body in Part 1."
Naruto,3c7bp5,HokageEzio,3,Sun Jul 5 22:04:35 2015 UTC,The body is irrelevant if the soul is out of reach.

Naruto,3c7bp5,HokageEzio,4,Sun Jul 5 22:23:30 2015 UTC,it could be found but edo requires the soul to go into the body which was in the body of the death god.. you should know this tobirama you invented edo tensei
Naruto,3c7bp5,Dosu_Kinuta,2,Sun Jul 5 21:01:12 2015 UTC,Then how did naruto got his arm? Also any idea why Sasuke didn't?
Naruto,3c7bp5,HokageEzio,8,Sun Jul 5 16:11:24 2015 UTC,Left over Zetsus.  Sasuke being Sasuke (too cool for stupid things like limbs).
Naruto,3c7bp5,elxx714,2,Sun Jul 5 16:12:41 2015 UTC,Pretty sure Sasuke chose not to have the arm. Naruto told him it would be ready soon and he chose to leave anyway
Naruto,3c7bp5,carinihada,1 point,Sun Jul 5 21:14:43 2015 UTC,What novel is this in?
Naruto,3c7bp5,elxx714,1 point,Tue Jul 7 23:09:54 2015 UTC,I believe it was in chapter 699
Naruto,3c7bp5,Alluka-,2,Wed Jul 8 19:43:19 2015 UTC,Sasuke didn't want it.   Don't forget their arms were blown clean off. Guy's leg was destroyed from the inside out and was slowly crumbling away from being turned to ash. He didn't lose it though.  I'd say he could've gotten a replacement if he actually lost his leg but I don't think the damage that was done could be healed so easily. He shattered his bones and burnt away any chakra networks he had.
Naruto,3c7bp5,Tormound,-2,Mon Jul 6 02:40:01 2015 UTC,Gone. It was buried for decades and whatever was left was taken by Orochimaru. I'm surprised there was DNA left at all to edo tensei him since his body should have decayed away to the bone by the time they went through his grave.
Naruto,3c7bp5,Tormound,2,Sun Jul 5 22:24:01 2015 UTC,Why won't DNA be left after a person is dead? (why are you surprised?)
Naruto,3c67qv,Aaeriana,14,Sun Jul 5 05:29:55 2015 UTC,Naruto was pure gold until all the filler before shippuden.

Naruto,3c67qv,NaturaHigh,6,Sun Jul 5 11:18:19 2015 UTC,Doesn't Jiraya's death at least deserve an honorable mention?
Naruto,3c67qv,catzi1,2,Sun Jul 5 13:11:59 2015 UTC,"Oh, silly me.  How could I forget about Jiraiya Sensei?  Of course, probably the best death in the entire series and that soundtrack makes my eyes wet every time I hear it."

He got even more badass Edo Tensei'd, but fuck was reunion that sad.   Im currently rewatching Naruto as well, so those Zabuza arc feels are still fresh."

Naruto,3c67qv,UnbiasedPashtun,1 point,Sun Jul 5 07:49:52 2015 UTC,Source? I could totally see that being the case.
Naruto,3c67qv,IamNR,2,Sun Jul 5 08:08:29 2015 UTC,"This was quite a while ago so I don't have a source, sorry. I'll try looking for one though. I don't know if that rumor is legitimate or not but its just something I remember reading online somewhere.  I think it's just a fan rumor, but I believe it is likely that could be the case since Haku looks very feminine genetically instead of only dressing feminine."
Naruto,3c79xo,elxx714,14,Sun Jul 5 15:24:14 2015 UTC,Spiralling Flash Super Round Dance Howl Style Three is my favorite. For such a complicated name it's just throwing 6 kunai instead of 1 and teleporting to one of them.

Naruto,3c79xo,a_gleeful_giraffe,0,Sun Jul 5 22:21:34 2015 UTC,In the Naruto universe it is pretty safe to assume that Tobitama invented every jutsu possible and everyone since has just stolen them from him

Naruto,3c5w86,irishsaltytuna,5,Sun Jul 5 03:02:07 2015 UTC,"I noticed lots of filler references  Also, wow, Shino development   And the wedding next time!"
Naruto,3c5w86,RockSauron,1 point,Sun Jul 5 03:38:52 2015 UTC,"I really liked Shino's development in this story.   It's revealed that he is extremely worried about things changing and being left behind. He also didn't have a clue about where his life would be going, and that scared him.   As the beekeeper stated, Shino comes off as a cold and calculated shinobi, but deep down he is very passionate about what he does and his friends.   Also apparently his bugs can form swords, so that's a thing."
Naruto,3c5w86,GameBoy09,3,Sun Jul 5 20:13:17 2015 UTC,"“Eh? Come to think of it, have we not met before this in Konoha? I recently moved there.

It lines up perfectly with the Kiba one-shot where they ran into each other in Konoha shortly after The Last.  Also, the bamboo fog really reminds me of the Bamboo forest in one of the episodes of Mushishi."
Naruto,3c5w86,IamNR,2,Sun Jul 5 03:14:49 2015 UTC,"To be honest, they were confident that their knowledge in genjutsu was higher than other ninjas. Of course, that included breaking out of them too.   What??"
Naruto,3c5w86,IamNR,4,Sun Jul 5 09:36:14 2015 UTC,"What's confusing? Kurenai is a genjutsu specialist, so she taught her students all about the physics and mechanics of genjutsu, as well as all the varieties of it.   She also taught them how to recognise, counter and break out of genjutsu. Them being ninja with heightened perception helps greatly as well."

Naruto,3c64bg,KurioHonoo,12,Sun Jul 5 04:54:30 2015 UTC,Rinnegan ability. Sasukes is his short range object switching teleport.
Naruto,3c64bg,KurioHonoo,2,Sun Jul 5 05:04:48 2015 UTC,/thread  thanks I was actually very confused about that.
Naruto,3c64bg,night4345,3,Sun Jul 5 05:12:56 2015 UTC,"That's why literally no one could see it other than Sasuke after he got his. Naruto could sense them, but that wasn't until he got So6p mode"
Naruto,3c64bg,Yoshiji,6,Sun Jul 5 05:14:32 2015 UTC,Limbo was a Rinnegan power.
Naruto,3c64bg,Yoshiji,7,Sun Jul 5 05:06:32 2015 UTC,"I think that he just never used his eyes' abilities because he was just not interested in those.  Story-wise if we consider the character I think that's legit. We know that Madara is a pure fighter and is thrilled with interesting battles, his fighting abilities have always been at the top and isn't interested in a one way slaughter by just standing there.  If we consider now that some MS powers are like Amaterasu, Tsukuyomi etc... so give an unfair advantage where opponents can't easily get out of it, and are based on eye powers only, I don't think that he would be interested in these powers at all. He would just be interested to use Susano'o in order to duel the opponent and actually do something because that's how he is.  So imo, most convincing reasons :    He didn't like to rely on his eyes, instead he prefered to fight enemies ""fairly"". He just wasn't good at using those He got crappy powers"
Naruto,3c64bg,jl1995,4,Sun Jul 5 14:55:19 2015 UTC,That's a pretty good breakdown. I doubt that he wasn't good at using them. But I agree with everything else you said.
Naruto,3c64bg,RsRadical108,3,Sun Jul 5 14:57:51 2015 UTC,"Yeah but knowing he's an excellent fighter and reckless kind of guy, I think that it makes sense he's less gifted when it comes to dojutsu. After all, as far as we know, he didn't use the rinnegans to their full potential as well, that's why I placed this reason before the ""he got crappy powers"" one.   But yeah, I really think that the most convincing reason is that he didn't want to rely on his eyes. Knowing how he is, and enjoy battles this much etc.. I highly doubt that using some eye powers would make him happy, after all the only ability of the rinnegan he used (Limbo) in a sense is a physical and fair one, and maybe he got that ability because it fits his personality."
Naruto,3c64bg,DustyMill,4,Sun Jul 5 16:04:54 2015 UTC,"Well there are 5 mangekyo abilities that we know of. Amaterasu, Tsukuyomi, Kamui, Koto Amatsukami and Shin's telekinesis ability.   By using the process of elimination I think it is safe to rule out that Madara did not have Kamui or Koto Amatsukami since those two abilities are absolute game changers.   So it is possible that he had any of the other three. Which one is anyone's guess. It's also possible let that he had a entirely new one that we don't know about ."
Naruto,3c64bg,DustyMill,1 point,Sun Jul 5 15:54:06 2015 UTC,Telekinesis is pretty useless if you have rinnegan
Naruto,3c64bg,Rambro332,10,Sun Jul 5 20:27:11 2015 UTC,"I remember Itachi saying you needed Tsukuyomi and Amatarasu to get Susano'o which was proven to be false but I like to think that it's what Madara's abilities were. Hashirama said Sasuke was more like Izuna which with Itachi being older obviously made him Madara.   Plus I feel like the jutsu Madara got from his MS would be 2 he either didn't like or wasn't good at such as Tsukuyomi and Amatarasu. Tsukuyomi because Madara has only been shown using a basic genjutsu twice I believe which kinda tells me that he's not good at them like Sasuke, or it could be the same reason as Amatarasu which I would think he wouldn't like because it's too quick and Madara likes long battles that give him a thrill. It's no fun if they can't fight back because they are in a genjutsu long enough for you to deal with them or being burned by flames that never go out."
Naruto,3c64bg,Rosebunse,5,Sun Jul 5 11:20:47 2015 UTC,"The reasoning in your second part makes sense to me. But the whole itachi being analogous to madara in terms of power and sasuke being like izuna is way too farfetched for me. But I agree, whatever madara had it was probably useless compared to his susanoo or it was too quick."
Naruto,3c64bg,Thatguy69Kappa,2,Sun Jul 5 12:24:48 2015 UTC,"Obviously when we look at how Itachi and Madara carried themselves later on in life, they were pretty different with how they went about stuff. But what I meant when I said that (although poorly worded properly since I typed that pretty late) is   Madara was the older brother as is Itachi Sasuke was said to resemble Izuna from Hashirama They can say they were evenly matched but we know Madara was always stronger as was Itachi Madara seemed to be more understanding of people as was Itachi whereas Izuna seemed to have issues really trusting anyone as did Sasuke (example being when Madara thought about going back over to Hashirama's side but Izuna told him not to)   It's not the perfect link between the 4 of them of course but hopefully that makes a bit more sense of where I was coming from."
Naruto,3c64bg,elxx714,1 point,Sun Jul 5 22:07:23 2015 UTC,"Yeah that makes a little more sense. I never saw that parallel before, but it's interesting. Like history repeating itself kind of."
Naruto,3c64bg,seriouslybrosrs,1 point,Mon Jul 6 04:12:05 2015 UTC,I think what Itachi was saying was that he needed to awaken Amaterasu and Tsukuyomi in each of his own eyes to activate his own susanoo.
Naruto,3c64bg,elxx714,4,Sun Jul 5 15:51:26 2015 UTC,It could just be that he never used them.
Naruto,3c64bg,_johnning,3,Sun Jul 5 14:36:01 2015 UTC,Meteors maybe ? Other than that I dont think he wouldnt be able to master his eye's jutsu I mean we are talking about god fricking damn Madara .
Naruto,3c64bg,LastOfTheDovahkiin,1 point,Sun Jul 5 19:05:07 2015 UTC,"It looked like he used Tsukuyomi a while ago on a member of the shinobi forces right after he was reanimated, but then again is could have easily not been Tsukuyomi"
Naruto,3c64bg,_johnning,1 point,Sun Jul 5 15:11:40 2015 UTC,Seems like an enormous assumption considering it was used with a normal 3-tomoe and it was regular genjutsu. To assume his MS ability must be Itachi's is ridiculous.

Naruto,3c77uo,pmitch94,1 point,Mon Jul 6 00:09:34 2015 UTC,"Easy.  1. the training trip with naruto and Jirayia as a part of the story. this is where the story lost most of its potential and really showed (my theory) that Kishi did not have shippuden planned out when first starting Naruto. he should of returned to the village knowing who his parents were and having LEARNED something while away with the Jiraiya. We should have seen pieces of his travel and been introduced to the other countries and more of the other Jinchuriki, making their deaths actually mean something and make it possible for naruto to grow as a character. We should have had more conflict between the villages. Finally both Sakura and Naruto should have given up on Sasuke after he tries to kill Naruto for the second time. Naruto should have learned something about the Uzumaki and their techniques.    Relationships :I don't care if Sakura and Naruto end up together or not (i prefer it to him and hinata and sakura/sasuke) but I don't get the pairings at all, Hinata needed way more development then she got. If she's the girl then at least make her a decent character, everything she does revolves around naruto, she's just like Sakura was too sasuke, in the start of the series just stronger. she's a glorified fangirl. She needed more development and interaction with Naruto, or just forego it and put naruto and sakura together because they had the most development and chemistry simply because they were together the most. Sakura and Sasuke shouldn't ever be, where Hinata and naruto needed more interaction and character development Sakura needed an atomic bombs force of development. Her character is PATHETIC. the man tries to stab her, literally stabs Karin, and both forgive him almost instantly. ITS INSANE! there is a point where actions become unforgivable, it would be like Anko hooking up with Orichimaru after what he did to her. the man straight up went to kill her. Now i Kishi was dead set on naruhina, fine but don't match sakura with anyone or pick a random character it would be better than sasuke. the idea that a 12 year olds crush was true love that lasted through 3 years of no contact after being abandoned and the next meetings are him trying to murder your closest friend and then you... yea.. sakura and Hinata have no real agency outside of pleasing naruto and sasuke and its shit, they deserve to have had better development. no bringing back Obito, it was dumb. the whole idea that Tobi was an immortal madara worked with the story, the idea of immortality was set up by Orichimaru so it wasn't like it was being sprun on us. Obito surviving getting crushed to death was just ridiculous. I think Sasuke should have taken over from weakened Madara as leader of Akatsuki, showing the ultiamte failure of Itachi's actions and leaving the burden solely at naruto's feet to Stop Sasuke. this makes a 100% more sense for them to have their final duel. I would also have Orchimaru pop up during the final arc, and if sasuke was to have any redemption he would die saving naruto's life from orichimaru and allowing naruto to get the killing blow."
Naruto,3c76zp,vladthetransilvanian,1 point,Sun Jul 5 14:53:05 2015 UTC,"I like this.    I still don't think Sasuke would instantly forgive Konoha and have a lot of hate for it when he learns what kind of village it truly is, though."
Naruto,3c76zp,Sarahmint,1 point,Sun Jul 5 18:51:58 2015 UTC,It's not so much forgiving the village as him wanting to honour Itachi's wish.
Naruto,3c76zp,Sarahmint,1 point,Sun Jul 5 21:35:28 2015 UTC,Itachi's wish of supporting a genocidal government?
Naruto,3c76zp,Legovil,1 point,Sun Jul 5 22:19:37 2015 UTC,"Honestly, Obito wouldn't let Karin hear his conversation and would likely either kill her or make sure she wasn't nearby. Also how would she know about the truth from Obito when he didn't say the truth, even if she knew he was lying. Sasuke wouldn't feel any remorse for his brother and would probably just let his body rot, however he would definitely take his eyes.  He also knew the truth anyway therefore wouldn't protect Konoha for Itachi, he would likely go down the same path and help Obito even if he was lying.  Pein wouldn't delay the attack on Konoha because he wanted to capture him last, it was more because he was always with Jiraiya who Pein didn't think he could fight. Remember that Jiraiya lost when he was in Pein's territory and had help from Konan. This means that if Jiraiya was in Konoha then Pein would most likely have been squashed. If Jiraiya gets killed like in canon then the invasion will probably just take place at the same time.  The reason that Naruto learned senjutsu (not senju mode :P) was because Jiraiya was dead and they knew that Naruto needed to learn it so that he had a chance against Pein. Jiraiya needed Sage Mode to beat Pein and he was better than Naruto without Sage Mode anyway.  Edited to explain more."
Naruto,3c76zp,Legovil,1 point,Sun Jul 5 21:30:24 2015 UTC,I never said he told her anything. Karin just happened to listen in on their conversation.
Naruto,3c74sq,kamac496,13,Sun Jul 5 14:27:37 2015 UTC,"Susanoo and the Six Paths aren't exactly eye-based jutsu themselves even if they originate from a pair of eyes. As long as you've awakened those powers, you have access to them regardless of whether you still possess the eyes themselves. Apparently.  And some random trivia: Amaterasu was born when Izanagi washed out his left eye, Tsukuyomi was born from the washing of the right eye, and Susanoo from the washing of the nose."
Naruto,3c74sq,knight504,3,Sun Jul 5 14:33:15 2015 UTC,Then why couldn't Obito use Susanoo before he got his both eyes back?
Naruto,3c74sq,knight504,9,Sun Jul 5 14:35:01 2015 UTC,Obito never awakened the Susanoo. He would need both eyes himself first to awaken it which couldn't happen because Kakashi had one of them.
Naruto,3c74sq,knight504,1 point,Sun Jul 5 14:37:29 2015 UTC,"I see. So, you need to have both mangekyou into your eye sockets, and then you unlock Susanoo, and then it doesn't matter if you have them anymore.  Spoilers"

Naruto,3c74sq,knight504,1 point,Sun Jul 5 15:55:39 2015 UTC,Never awakened Susanoo before losing one eye.
Naruto,3c74sq,Lonelyrick,1 point,Sun Jul 5 14:36:42 2015 UTC,This might be a stupid question but does that mean Kakashi can still use Susanoo?
Naruto,3c74sq,Rosebunse,3,Sun Jul 5 14:44:44 2015 UTC,"Spoilers.  Like I just said to the OP, I don't think so since he's not a Uchiha and was just a Spoilers. His Spoilers was just temporary like that whole power-up."

Naruto,3c4ufs,AFatz,3,Sun Jul 5 00:16:03 2015 UTC,It would be interesting to see a fighting game that chose accuracy over balance.  Edit: the Dragon Ball: Raging Blast Series was one of these types of games. The OP characters were the OP-est.
Naruto,3c4ufs,raella69,2,Sun Jul 5 02:43:19 2015 UTC,"Or kid Naruto's Uzamaki Rindan = Sasuke+Naruto combo Black flame rasenshuriken nuclear explosion, I feel like they could at least make those do maybe a 1/4 bar more, considering you have 2-3 bars"
Naruto,3c4ufs,Spartn90,3,Sun Jul 5 03:11:59 2015 UTC,"So, having not played any of these games, I've got a question. Is the game balanced so all characters are around equal, or does the power of each character reflect their power in the manga? I can't really see either way working well, because the first way, it'd be pretty dumb to have Kiba stand toe to toe with Madara, and the second way doesn't really seem like it would work, because you'd have no real reason to play anyone besides the top 5 characters if your goal was to win."
Naruto,3c4ufs,SgtMcMuffin0,2,Sun Jul 5 04:48:13 2015 UTC,"It is more about spectacle and enjoyment, not so much about competitive play. Though I guess you could win as any character even versus the supposedly tougher ones."

Naruto,3c4ufs,ArtistBlock,1 point,Sun Jul 5 03:43:07 2015 UTC,"Definitely not. There are simple combos and there are very difficult combos. There are 4 combos for each character, each can be cancelled at almost any point in them, chained by tilt, grab, dashes, jumps, jutsus, ultimates, shuriken, etc. Each character plays differently to depict their power in the anime/manga and pulling off complicated combos is pretty rewarding.   If the game was just mashing a button, there would be no skill gap and the learning curve is rather large. If it required no skill, anyone could beat anyone else no matter the experience and that's just not the case here."
Naruto,3c4ufs,Gohan_Son,1 point,Mon Jul 6 01:38:48 2015 UTC,"there are 4 different combos you can do. You can string these combos in many different ways using things like Ninja dash, quick doublejumps, items, support characters, timed blocking and more. The Naruto games are more about reaction and knowing what your enemy is capable of. for example if you are using shino you aren't going to charge right at Kiba. Once you actually get into it, it's one of the most complex fighting games out there."
Naruto,3c409s,garrison105,18,Sat Jul 4 15:39:50 2015 UTC,"Yup, I have read somewhere that he was telling he will continue his work as a mangaka but not for Naruto and also he may not draw in weekly basis. He also referred that he will be more focusing on Sci-fi"

The schedule was always consistent, and I can imagine where he would be burnt out."
Naruto,3c409s,Rosebunse,7,Sat Jul 4 18:53:06 2015 UTC,"I do wonder. Supposedly, Kishimoto actually wrote the screenplay for the Boruto movie himself.  If he enjoyed the experience, there's the possibility he could continue the series as movies instead of manga, or as a TV series like Dragon Ball Super.  I imagine only having to write scripts must be significantly less work than being a weekly mangaka."
Naruto,3c409s,TheDragonSageNinja22,2,Sat Jul 4 19:14:30 2015 UTC,I think this would make more sense. Naruto is still making money and has been insanely popular for years.

I mean his greatest achievement is Naruto and that shit ain't going away anytime soon I'm sure the animation studio will milk that sucker dry for years and all he would really need to do is sit back and reap the profits while spending time with his family

Naruto,3c2e7o,-Obito-,9,Sat Jul 4 07:00:42 2015 UTC,Dat over-analysis. Obito is just like most bad guys. He was just a dude who saw some bad shit go down and then realized the world is shitty.
Naruto,3c2e7o,Mehmedx,3,Sat Jul 4 11:33:24 2015 UTC,"Right, but other bad guys are more believable. Nagato had to go through tragedy after tragedy after tragedy to get to where he was. Obito, meanwhile, lived a comfortable life filled with love from all sides, but the death of his school age crush was enough to push him over the edge. Obito isn't as likable or well-written as other villains."

But my mother has BPD, so I'm relatively acquainted with what it looks like and frankly Obito doesn't really display many BPD characteristics... they live in a world of war, death, and very real threats while BPD tend to react more to perceived threats. Perceived threats such as: you ate some leftovers that they had wanted to eat, so it turns into a huge sob fest because you eating leftovers means that you knew they wanted them (even though they didn't say that) and did it on purpose, which means you hate them, which means you think they're a terrible person unworthy of love, which means no-one loves them, etc etc. Small stupid stuff blown way out of proportion.   Obito is in denial. He's hurt and trying to get rid of that hurt, but he just doesn't seem BPD to me... He has a very real concerns that he just approaches the solution to differently than our hero."

Kids' brains are not developed enough to make a romantic attachment in the same way that adults do; that's a simple fact. You got over your first crush, just like Obito should have gotten over his. And besides, he's claimed more than once to have seen the dark side of humanity, which implies that he's travelled the world. That life experience alone should have made him intelligent enough to get over Rin."

Naruto,3c2e7o,jorgomli,3,Sat Jul 4 05:03:10 2015 UTC,"Also he was, like, the coolest guy. /s"
Naruto,3c2e7o,stiggystoned369,5,Sat Jul 4 06:48:40 2015 UTC,"Alright, first off, it'll be a cold day in hell before I read all of that.  Second, I like the story of Obito personally.  He's Nagato 2.0, with a couple changes here or there.  I personally think the Ame Orphans were Kishi's best creation.  Obito's story was basically a copy and paste of that.  Boy see's shitty thing, boy goes bad, boy gets used, boy redeems himself.  Except replace Nagato with Obito and Obito with Madara.  That being said, that's not necessarily a bad thing, just the fact that it's not new makes it less interesting to me personally.  He even compares himself to Nagato at one point, because he was about ready to go out the exact same way.  I understand why he broke, I respect the way he was written as a character, and I don't look at him as just some friend zoned loser.  But I also don't necessarily think he deserved as much retribution as he received.  He is responsible for everything.  Yes, he was used by Madara.  Yes, somebody like Nagato did bad things as well.  But the difference is that Madara did not commit those actions, Obito did.  The blood is literally on Obito's hands.  He does not deserve any shot at being a hero.  Who killed Sasuke's clan by his own hand, Obito.  Who killed Naruto's parents by his own hand, Obito.  Who caused the Bloody Mist by his own hand, Obito.  Obito, Obito, Obito.  I don't care what Madara did to him, sorry doesn't erase that all of these things are directly Obito's fault.  Or else I should feel bad for Madara because of BZ, which I don't, because he did terrible things to Obito."
Naruto,3c2e7o,Rekthor,7,Sat Jul 4 06:06:17 2015 UTC,"Expanding on what you said but not quite, I'm not so sure I would call Nagato's, Obito's, or Madara's stories copy and paste although they do have overarching overlap.  I would say that Nagato struggled with bringing peace to the world, and fulfilling what he felt was his duty to the shinobi world. He wanted to mature the world by bringing equal destruction to the ninja villages and thus everyone could comprehend each other since they all would know the same pain and therefore would be able to come to an understanding.  Obito on the other hand felt that along with Rin dying so was his glimmer of hope that the world was maybe not a living hell. Rin was the only thing in Obito's life that was evidence the world was possibly a good place. Once Rin died so did his belief that the world was worthy of living on. So he decided to create a new dream world in which nothing bad ever happened.  I could go on, but my point is...in the end you can always reduce it to: they lost a loved one and turned evil seeking revenge against everyone. But I feel it is a little more complex than that."
Naruto,3c2e7o,Nothanks2U,0,Sat Jul 4 07:00:15 2015 UTC,"Which is pretty ridiculous on Obito's part, considering he had a clan, a village, friends, and was well-treated and fed. He had a good life. Obsessing over Rin was disrespectful to her and everyone else in his life."
Naruto,3c2e7o,hunterbelmont,1 point,Sat Jul 4 14:12:35 2015 UTC,"To be fair he wasn't completely well-treated, but he definitely wasn't at the 'naruto level' outcast. His best friends were elderly people and his teammates.   And plus he didn't obsess with Rin, so much as obsess over Rin's heart/spirit. Something he had never experienced in any other individual. She was the only one who truly respected and believed in Obito's gung ho pipe dreams as much as he did and even vowed to watch over him."
Naruto,3c2e7o,Nothanks2U,5,Sat Jul 4 19:23:03 2015 UTC,Obito doesn't deserve to be mentioned in the same sentence as Nagato. Nagato had a hard life start to finish and didn't turn bad until he was forced to murder his friend due to the corruption of his village leader collaborating with foreign powers.  Obito turned bad just by seeing his friendzone crush get killed. He lived a relatively good life up until that point. He has no excuse for doing the things he did.
Naruto,3c2e7o,hunterbelmont,0,Sat Jul 4 14:11:31 2015 UTC,"Good in comparison, but wasn't he an orphan?  Not trying to counter the statement, I can agree to an extent, just stating that Obito didn't have it as easy as say, I don't know, Sakura."
Naruto,3c2e7o,cilllah,2,Sat Jul 4 14:15:22 2015 UTC,"He may have been, but he still had a clan. I imagine they would have taken care of him.   I can agree to an extent, just stating that Obito didn't have it as easy as say, I don't know, Sakura.   I don't even know if I agree with that. Sakura had to fight in a war, too. And it's much harder watching a friend/crush turn evil than it is watching a friend/crush die an honorable death in combat to save the lives of others. Sakura had to live with the weight of what Sasuke had become, whereas Obito should have been proud of Rin for giving her life for others.  I'd rather have people I love give up their lives for others than become a murderer."
Naruto,3c2e7o,Creanyo,1 point,Sat Jul 4 14:24:19 2015 UTC,"12 year old Sakura.  That was what I meant.  The most 12 year old Sakura dealt with was her forehead issues, a boy who didn't like her back, and bullying at a young age.  The thing with Obito is that he broke so badly that he missed all of that.  In his mind, the world was wrong.  And the way to fix it was to create a new one.  It was sweet nothings that Madara whispered into his ear.  It's basically Madara telling him exactly what he wants to hear."
Naruto,3c2e7o,cilllah,1 point,Sat Jul 4 14:30:50 2015 UTC,"You know, as an aside, I find Madara to be a much more believable villain that Obito. Madara lived a life of conflict; saw his family killed; and tried to find build a better world, but watched his people get pushed aside as second class instead. Then he finds this religious text that's like, ""Hey, just do this crazy plan and it will save your clan"". I think there are much more people in real life like Madara than Obito."
Naruto,3c2e7o,sum1rand0m,1 point,Sat Jul 4 14:39:01 2015 UTC,"That's exactly it, Obito is Madara.  From the moment Obito died to the moment he turned on Madara, he was Madara.  All people who want Infinite Tsukuyomi, are Madara.  Madara is more than a person, it is an idea.  An idea that Obito lived in for 20 years.  That was Naruto's reasoning for why Obito was ""a cool guy"", and what Kishi tried to portray.  The mask is Madara, but the man behind the mask is Obito.  And the mask is not just physical.  It's basically his way of saying Obito is the good part.  I don't really agree, but that's the jist of it."

Naruto,3c2e7o,hunterbelmont,3,Sat Jul 4 07:51:59 2015 UTC,"And rightly so, imo. It's not like we all have finite upvotes. This took a lot of effort, even with the copy/paste jutsu. OP still had to tie it all together."

Naruto,3c2e7o,hunterbelmont,6,Sat Jul 11 20:41:44 2015 UTC,That copy/paste jutsu.
Naruto,3c2e7o,hunterbelmont,2,Sat Jul 4 08:23:58 2015 UTC,"I think you're reading into something that isn't there.  I speak as a writer when I say that Obito looks - to me - as a pre-planned twist that Kishimoto was packing long in advance. He wanted to say ""What if the leader of the Akatsuki, wasn't really the leader?!"" Hence, Obito, and he threw in the Madara's-name twist just for the sake of double-or-nothing.   He's not well-written as a result. Characters like Itachi, Pain and Zabuza: these are characters who are well-written. Their motives are clear, believable and yet they can still act with some depth of character (admittedly, some have hiccups; I still think Pain getting hit with the Friendship no Jutsu was one of the most gross mishandlings of a character in the entire series). Obito's motives are completely absurd. Seeing his childhood crush die and suddenly he loses all hope for humanity? Um, no. Just no. Kids his age are not old enough to understand love the way adults do; they simply do not see it in the same way that we do. Parental love? Sure. Romantic love? Absolutely not. Their brains aren't developed enough to make a connection on that level yet; Obito looked like he was just hitting puberty, and you can't tell me that you fell eternally in love with your first crush unless you're still a teenager yourself. You got over it, and so should Obito.  Ergo, this is an unbelievable motivation for his character, only compounded by the fact that seeing one person die (he's a shinobi; this should be line one of the job description) sends him into a nihilistic rampage. That doesn't happen to normal people. Itachi's motivation - being forced to make an impossible choice and make the best of a no-win scenario - is interesting. Pain's motivation - watching everything around him burn to ash from the day he was born until the day he adopted his new name - is interesting. Zabuza's relationship with Haku - not understanding whether he sees the young boy as a tool to fight a heartless world or as a friend to help him weather it - is interesting. Obito is a character written in post-hoc: a tool to serve the ends of the writer rather than the characters and story around him."
Naruto,3c2e7o,catzi1,1 point,Sat Jul 4 16:48:28 2015 UTC,I've always like Obito even when he got hate during the manga. But I'm glad during the anime he started to get a lot more love
Naruto,3c2e7o,hunterbelmont,2,Sat Jul 4 08:08:22 2015 UTC,"Why do you think he deserves love, exactly?  From my perspective, he was an immature person who hinged his entire life on a school age crush and was disrespectul in not honoring her sacrifice, but using it as an excuse to become a monster. He was loved by other people in the village, but that meant nothing to him, apparently."
Naruto,3c2e7o,benzineee,1 point,Sat Jul 4 14:17:07 2015 UTC,"He had the love of his life killed right in front of his eyes, he fed up of war, hated that his master for always being late, was manipulated by Madara and Obito had the power to make changes. You never had a loved one die in front you nor do you have powers so can't say he was immature. Besides he was like 12 when Rin died and he was being manipulated at such a young age."
Naruto,3c2e7o,AwesomeDattebayo,2,Sat Jul 4 18:47:24 2015 UTC,"Rin was not the love of his life. Rin was his schoolboy crush. And instead of being proud that she gave her life for others and honoring her ideals, he went against everything she died for. Then, a couple years later, he attacks the village that gave birth to him and murders Minato and Kushina, who had always shown him love. Obito is just rotten."

Naruto,3c2e7o,benzineee,1 point,Sun Jul 5 06:24:13 2015 UTC,As someone with BPD I'm glad you are spreading awareness and knowledge about the disorder. I think a lot of the reason why I fell in love with Naruto when I was younger was because of how much I could relate to Naruto and Sasuke so much.
Naruto,3c2e7o,cilllah,1 point,Sat Jul 4 08:30:46 2015 UTC,"I love you for this. Obito is definitely the best character in Naruto and my favourite character in any series ever.  I've written so many reasons why he did what he did. I don't see how people don't realise that he was a young child, downtrodden and then emotionally manipulated. UGH  So thank you! <3<3"
Naruto,3c2e7o,benzineee,1 point,Sun Jul 5 06:18:32 2015 UTC,"I enjoyed this post. I have a been a big Naruto fan since I was a teen and have coincidentally dated a BPD girl. But I don't know if Obito has BPD, maybe PTSD from losing Rin. Obito was like the opposite of Naruto. He did not find a healthy way to cope and just blamed everyone else around him for all the bad things going on. His bipolar mood swings were more of a disguise. His manipulation was to further his plans but not for survival to control his surroundings like a typical BPD. And not knowing his own identity was a result of him being manipulated himself at a very young age. BPD usually do the things they do to feel more human since they are usually empty inside. What Obito was doing was planned out to destroy the word and live in a fantasy world with Rin. I just feel like Obito was what Naruto would have been like if he never had the drive to do better and make the best out of his situation. To forget reality and live in a fantasy world instead. But I like your analysis."

Naruto,3c2e7o,HokageEzio,6,Sat Jul 4 14:28:18 2015 UTC,"Don't compare Obito to Naruto. Naruto was hated by the village and never knew why. Obito was just a goofy underachiever. He never had the hate that Naruto got.   he showed shame when he was around Rin  he was humble and did feel shame, I think apologizing, and constantly talking about how you deserve to die count as humble   He maintained his ""I'm a badass fighter everyone back me up"" persona, even after he had tried to murder all these people. Then get gets to the Afterlife and is like, ""RIN I KILLED MYSELF AND LET KAKASHI LIVE BECAUSE I WANT YOU TO MYSELF AND DON'T WANT KAKASHI AROUND"". I mean, he literally said that."

Yes, indeed Obito had a fucked up past and for that he's one of my favorite characters from Naruto along with Itachi, Nagato and Jiraiya.  We can all relate to him since we all had a childhood crush so we wouldn't know how we'd react if we would've seen our best friend Chidori her to death without knowing the reason.  Actually, I like his character because he wasn't really evil, he was good in his ways.  He just wanted for everyone to be happy in their ideal dream world, gladly Naruto's TNJ worked."

Madara had the Juubi and everything, Hashirama healing power and truth seeking balls. I don't think he had any of the Hagoromo powers whatsoever.   They engaged in combat before Madara had his second rinnegan, and Sasuke is clearly superior, Madara was running away from him. After the second rinnegan, it is unclear if any of them are stronger.

Naruto,3c336h,seriouslybrosrs,1 point,Sun Jul 5 04:12:09 2015 UTC,Original lifespan - died of old age.  Rinne Tensai - died after Kaguya ordeal.   ...?
Naruto,3c336h,seriouslybrosrs,1 point,Sun Jul 5 08:38:52 2015 UTC,"He died fighting Hashirama as well. I, of course consider that."
Naruto,3c336h,FakeAdminAccount,0,Sun Jul 5 15:38:59 2015 UTC,Maybe he/she's counting the Zetsu incident as a death.
Naruto,3c336h,rkellyturbo,6,Sun Jul 5 14:58:43 2015 UTC,"You cannot simply add power-ups together like the two are made up of coins you can gather to determine who is worth more. Secondly, good job downplaying Sasuke for no reason.  Sasuke clearly has a special eye that can also use his EMS techniques effectively meaning he can use his sharingan techs and rinnegan techs at the same time, something a regular rinnegan can't do. You claim Sasuke ""sucked"" yet he was praised by Kurama for being ""at the level of the Sage of Six Paths"". You claim he sucks yet his unique rinnegan ability surpasses Madara's limbo which can be detected by Sasuke's rinnegan. His susanoo is superior (in my opinion) due to its mobility and power. His teleportation and speed are both too much for Madara and even though he was extremely limited in his final fight with Naruto in terms of rinnegan techniques, he still was able to equal him. If you're counting all versions of Sasuke, his eye can now dimension-jump adding yet another powerful technique to his arsenal. In the end, I'd say Sasuke has surpassed Madara. He was pulling out feats left and right when he had only had the rinnegan for a day. Prime Sasuke I would say is stronger than Madara."
Naruto,3c336h,seriouslybrosrs,5,Sat Jul 4 17:51:24 2015 UTC,Also Sasuke put all the tailed beasts in a genjutsu and chibaku tensei combo just by looking at them.
Naruto,3c336h,rkellyturbo,1 point,Sat Jul 4 20:31:57 2015 UTC,Madara could use EMS and Rinnegan powers at the same time. He needed both to summon the meteors.
Naruto,3c336h,seriouslybrosrs,0,Sat Jul 4 21:37:51 2015 UTC,"Not true. Madara had to de-activate the rinnegan to use EMS genjutsu. If he could use it through his rinnegan, he would never have to deactivate it. Susanoo does not need eyes at all to be activated so I don't know what you're on about as it proves nothing."
Naruto,3c336h,rkellyturbo,1 point,Sun Jul 5 02:59:25 2015 UTC,"I know he had to deactivate it for that, but it was only one time so we can only assume it's the same all the time. Remember he didn't have his full Rinnegan powers in Edo Tensei so maybe that's why he couldn't use genjutsu with his Rinnegan form like Sasuke. Susanoo is a Sharingan tech regardless so what I said is technically true."
Naruto,3c336h,Rosebunse,0,Sun Jul 5 06:27:49 2015 UTC,"No, the fact that it was ""only one time"" shows that he cannot use sharingan techniques with his rinnegan. Sasuke is the first person we have seen able to use sharingan and rinnegan techniques.  Susanoo has been proven to be able to be used with no eyes so clearly susanoo can be unlocked with the MS, but is not required to use it. That means the fact that he has the rinnegan proves nothing. He could have byakugan in his sockets and still pull out susanoo, he could have golf balls in his sockets, that doesn't mean said byakugan or golf balls are allowing him to use his MS techniques. Please stop."
Naruto,3c336h,Thr0s,1 point,Sun Jul 5 14:55:09 2015 UTC,"I didn't even say that. I'm just saying Susanoo is still classified as a Sharingan technique whether or not the eyes are actually needed. So in the literal sense yes, Madara was technically the first we've seen able to use a Sharingan and Rinnegan technique at the same time. Since it hasn't been fully explained, I'd rather not jump to conclusions like you are. There's too many unknowns for either of us to say for sure, maybe he only needs to deactivate it for that specific jutsu, or the other reason I said. Who knows"
Naruto,3c336h,Ibrahimnaldo,2,Tue Jul 7 22:09:47 2015 UTC,"Technically, Madara was stronger, so was Kaguya. Madara was defeated by a sneak attack by Black Zetsu, and Kaguya just got cocky."

Naruto,3c53t1,RockSauron,1 point,Sat Jul 4 21:50:47 2015 UTC,Honestly I think this is and advice. While you are not wrong- it's much better for story telling purposes to watch the anime as it is intended.
Naruto,3c53t1,ChrisArm0,2,Sat Jul 4 22:10:41 2015 UTC,"Watch as intended... the story was ""intended"" to be read via the manga. If you're going with how it was intended, then read that. Both the anime and the games are adaptations of the original source. The only difference is that the game doesn't have tons of filler and useless flashbacks that kill the flow and natural progression of the story unlike anything I've ever seen before."

Naruto,3c2myc,ReusedRocket,1 point,Sat Jul 4 19:10:23 2015 UTC,I would turn out better if Minato simply sealed one half into Kushina and another half into Naruto.  Naruto wouldn't be an orphan and could even have an easier time learning to tap Kurama's chakra with Kushina's advice.  My take on this is that neither Minato nor Kushina know that resealing a tailed beast will save its host.  Non-uzumaki hosts will instantly die if their tailed beasts are extracted so no one would have thought of that possibility before.
Naruto,3c2myc,ReusedRocket,1 point,Sat Jul 4 07:04:28 2015 UTC,And how does he do that with the Reaper Death Seal? The reason he used it was to separate Kurama into two halves. He can't seal the other half into Kushina because to use the Reaper Death Seal he has to seal it within himself. I don't think it's possible

Naruto,3c4ymb,TheSerialTaco,6,Sat Jul 4 20:55:35 2015 UTC,"Better formatting:   Hello all,  Since Kishi has announced he will no longer write/draw anything naruto anymore, do you think there's a chance he will give the series for another author to continue? Financially, there's a ton of money to be made.  IMO Kishi has been an incredible author but he has his flaws. One of them being his displeasure writing happy intimate moments (IIRC he said he hated writing the shikatema relationship). In Naruto the primary focus was on the kids and parents weren't (too) important. But in gaiden we know all the main characters too well. They will definitely have to play a part, specifically through their interactions with their children. That should make up a considerable of gaiden in my opinion. I feel Kishi may not be best suited for writing this kind a of story. Don't get me wrong, he's been great and this story has been one hell of a ride with its action. But in addition to action packed parts of naruto, gaiden also carries a very significant theme... Family  And by that I mean actual happy family moments not ""My parents were murdered by a demon fox, My crazy brother murdered my entire clan, My sole purpose in life is too protect my cousin."" (Part 1 perspective). A new author might be... Fresh. We will maybe see things we have never seen before. Change might be good... Who knows? The future holds what it holds. All I can do is pray naruto is not over. Your thoughts   Personally, I would prefer it if the series was truly finally over. It was amazing and he has done what he needs to and wrapped it up well. I think the only reason to keep it going is for that money! All I can see happening is movies every couple of years or something. Maybe something like DBZ now.  If he gave it away, we would probably get something like DBGT. I would prefer it just end."

Naruto,3c2fci,dynrte,1 point,Sat Jul 4 13:24:30 2015 UTC,"I think it was because he used a jutsu that required more chakra than he actually possessed.   Running out of chakra may not kill you, but trying to pull more out at the expense of your life force or whatever would probs kill you."

Naruto,3bziox,studentbrady,93,Fri Jul 3 12:21:38 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure why he gets a bad rap. I recently reread the whole Minato/Kushina arc and he was really great. He rescues Naruto and Kushina. He figures out Obitos abilities almost immediately. He fights and wrests control of the kyuubi from Obito. He formulates a plan to seal the kyuubi, preserve some of his and Kushinas essence so they could meet/help/advise their son in the future. He sacrifices not only himself, but also his son for the future of the village, as he knows there is a foe out there he will not be able to deal with. Also, he is far and away the kindest of the hokage. His attitude and belief is the real will of fire personified."
Naruto,3bziox,vietbond,47,Fri Jul 3 15:28:47 2015 UTC,Who ever gave him a bad rap?  I thought he was praised.  I know he's one if my favorites
Naruto,3bziox,AuraXmaster,16,Fri Jul 3 16:07:33 2015 UTC,"I don't know. I often read about how much the 4th messes up and every time I see lists of the best hokage, he's always right before Tsunade, but after everyone else...even Kakashi."
Naruto,3bziox,vietbond,7,Fri Jul 3 16:30:01 2015 UTC,"He messes up quite a bit in the war, especially the fight against madara there is no denying that, but as a whole Minato is loved on this subreddit"
Naruto,3bziox,Rexzar,3,Fri Jul 3 17:35:48 2015 UTC,"Idk about that. Mess up? the only thing you could count as a mess up was the fact he didn't kill obito, but even then in the end it turns out for the best as obito is critical in defeating Kaguya. I wouldn't say Minato messed up at all. He was up against two much more powerful villians than himself, and saved the allied forces multiple times."
Naruto,3bziox,Toad_Sage_Jiraiya,2,Fri Jul 3 21:37:45 2015 UTC,Minato easily one of my favorites too.
Naruto,3bziox,Hibria,4,Sat Jul 4 04:45:13 2015 UTC,"Blame the Fourth Great Shinobi War. Once that arc got started, his character took a lot of hits."
Naruto,3bziox,knight504,3,Fri Jul 3 20:08:21 2015 UTC,"Also, Minato was the one who actually hit Obito with his Rasengan so that makes him the first one to hit/damage Obito since his Mangekyo Sharingan activation."

Naruto,3bziox,Gabain1993,5,Fri Jul 3 16:29:59 2015 UTC,I thought kushina was going to die regardless or at least as far as they knew. So it would only have been a temperary solution.
Naruto,3bziox,Ninja-Otter,1 point,Fri Jul 3 16:58:06 2015 UTC,I'm basing this on the fact that to save Naruto they have to implant a tailed beast into him before he dies. Therefore shouldn't it be the same for Kushina?
Naruto,3bziox,kaito0,3,Fri Jul 3 17:19:00 2015 UTC,"We'll never know why Minato couldn't reseal Kurama back into his wife, instead having to use his son to seal only half of Kurama. Maybe a complication of childbirth."
Naruto,3bziox,Kazarath,5,Fri Jul 3 18:08:41 2015 UTC,Minato had to seal the nine tails into Naruto cause Minato and Kushina had been impaled. He also only put half in Naruto due to the fact that the technique he used (can't remember the name) was going to lock Minato and the Nine tails away in a dimension where they'd essentially fight for eternity. He also did it because he believe in his son's ability.
Naruto,3bziox,kaito0,2,Fri Jul 3 18:35:58 2015 UTC,"But Minato planned on sealing Kurama inside Naruto from the moment he was ripped from Kushina. Minato and Kushina were impaled protecting the alter that Naruto was on.  So, the question is still there: why didn't Minato just reseal Kurama inside his wife, if there was a chance she could have survived?"
Naruto,3bziox,Gabain1993,2,Fri Jul 3 18:54:17 2015 UTC,What i meant was did they have that information? As far as they know extraction means death. And no way of knowing that resealing would cure her. Based on their conversation they assumed she would die regardless. Atleast thats what i remember.
Naruto,3bziox,night4345,1 point,Fri Jul 3 19:36:06 2015 UTC,"I don't think Kushina had much of a chance to survive. She was weakened by childbirth, had Kurama ripped out of her and spent her strength keeping him caged up in her Chakra Chains.  I think Kushina tells him to put the Kyuubi back inside her so she'll die and take it with her.  Minato had to put only half of Kurama inside Naruto because baby Naruto couldn't hold all that Chakra similar to Obito basically breaking apart because of all the Ten Tails' Chakra."

Naruto,3bziox,muffinmonk,1 point,Fri Jul 3 20:41:08 2015 UTC,Probably because it wouldn't make much sense. She's already very weak. Naruto would be used as hostage. She wouldn't benefit from Kurama's power since they're aren't on terms.

Naruto,3bziox,dynrte,1 point,Fri Jul 3 18:36:24 2015 UTC,You're missing the blatant fact that Minato and Kushina were impaled and dying anyway...
Naruto,3bziox,thesagem,2,Fri Jul 3 18:52:10 2015 UTC,It looked like he was planning on doing that before Kushina was impaled.
Naruto,3bziox,Ninja-Otter,1 point,Fri Jul 3 20:05:50 2015 UTC,"Well when he first sealed half of it into him, I'm pretty sure no one was stabbed at that point."
Naruto,3bziox,walta_,0,Fri Jul 3 20:39:54 2015 UTC,I think Kushina was too weak to have the 9tails resealed within her. That must be it.
Naruto,3bziox,Ninja-Otter,1 point,Fri Jul 3 21:58:26 2015 UTC,"Actually, Naruto fainted as soon as Kurama was removed, however Kushina managed to stay concious etc. for an extremely long time."
Naruto,3bziox,Willo101,2,Fri Jul 3 22:02:48 2015 UTC,It's probably bc Kushina is a full blooded Uzimaki where Naruto is a Hybrid.
Naruto,3bziox,beef-jerkey,-1,Fri Jul 3 23:33:16 2015 UTC,"I would argue they all have the will of fire, the only one who was a bit of a jerk was 2. And he was a herk to the Uchiha because. . . well he makes it clear why he doesnt like the Uchiha, a super powerful clan that gains power through hatred. 3 had to ride the line, he segregaded the Uchiha away after the 9 tails was used by an Uchiha to attack the village and kill the 4th."
Naruto,3bziox,bribedpayton34,19,Fri Jul 3 17:37:58 2015 UTC,"I'm confused. Why does no one give the 3rd Hokage any credit? In the manga he was regarded as being the strongest of the 4 previous, and in his old age was able to defeat a reincarnated 1st, 2nd, and almost Orochimaru. It feels like people always throw him under the bus."
Naruto,3bziox,Not-Hitler,14,Fri Jul 3 17:28:23 2015 UTC,Mainly cause of no showings. If we take the fourth databook's word though that should easily put prime Hiruzen over Tobirama and Minato. Having all the ninjutsu in the leaf (even if they're restricted to non-clan) is incredibly OPed.
Naruto,3bziox,CobraCommanderVII,4,Fri Jul 3 18:28:37 2015 UTC,"Mainly because that fight was before the power of Hashi and Tobirama was really established. Based on what we've seen, Hiruzen hasn't done anything as impressive as Hashi, although word of God does place him very highly"
Naruto,3bziox,Toad_Sage_Jiraiya,2,Fri Jul 3 18:43:18 2015 UTC,"This was in part 1. A lot of things in part 1 are retconned away later in the story. The 1st and 2nd were revived nearly completely surpressed the first time, which is why they were weaker.   I think the third was clearly the strongest of his generation of kage and was powerful indeed,but remember most of his hype comes before the story was really finding its feet. I mean an anbu even exclaims when tobirama used water style jutsu without any water around.... this is clearly retconned away later in the story, hell at the begining of part 2 didn't kisame's medium create a huge tidal wave in the middle of a desert?   Again its because most of his hype,feats come when the story was still being built."
Naruto,3bziox,UnbiasedPashtun,0,Fri Jul 3 21:48:37 2015 UTC,The reason he beat the Hashirama and Tobirama was because Orochimaru revived them at only 30% of their full power.
Naruto,3bziox,rastogishubham,21,Fri Jul 3 22:58:14 2015 UTC,"You are correct, minato was in his early 30's IIRC when he died but that means he could have kept learning and improving. I don't know if he would eventually be hashi level but yes he did have the potential and was a genius shinobi with incredible skills as he is shown to master the kyuubi chakra (just after being reincarnated) and perfect toad sage mode"
Naruto,3bziox,Legovil,21,Fri Jul 3 12:53:58 2015 UTC,He was 27 24 when he died.  Edit: Thanks /u/dynrte he was indeed 24 and not 27.
Naruto,3bziox,dynrte,30,Fri Jul 3 13:51:58 2015 UTC,"He was 24, confirmed in the databooks."
Naruto,3bziox,carolnuts,17,Fri Jul 3 13:57:43 2015 UTC,"24 and hokage , damnnn that's impressive"
Naruto,3bziox,MattValtezzy,10,Fri Jul 3 16:17:55 2015 UTC,"I think he was actually 22 when he became Hokage (I think he'd been Hokage for at least a year or so when the 9 tails attack happened)   Dang it Kishi, why you no make an official timeline yet?!"
Naruto,3bziox,916expat,2,Fri Jul 3 20:34:31 2015 UTC,I don't think he was hokage for that long. Kakashi was 26 at the beginning of the series. The nine tails attack happened 12 years before the beginning of the series meaning Kakashi was 14 years old. He was only 13 during the mission to Kanabi bridge. This means Minato was only hokage for a year or less before he died.
Naruto,3bziox,MattValtezzy,1 point,Sat Jul 4 08:13:28 2015 UTC,I've seen sources that say he was 12 during the Kannabi Bridge mission.
Naruto,3bziox,Legovil,5,Sat Jul 4 18:43:05 2015 UTC,Ahh yes you are correct.
Naruto,3bziox,Lord4th,16,Fri Jul 3 14:02:08 2015 UTC,Well I would argue he's already surpassed the 2nd Hokage but I digress.  But no. I seriously doubt at any point he would be stronger than Hashirama.
Naruto,3bziox,dynrte,9,Fri Jul 3 13:49:17 2015 UTC,I disagree. If Minato mastered sage mode and had the half of the Nine Tails sealed within him that he did when he died he would be on par with Hashi. He also never had time to complete Rasengan.
Naruto,3bziox,ABashfulTurnip,9,Fri Jul 3 13:59:10 2015 UTC,The sage mode I'd agree with however because he didn't die he would never have gotten kurama sealed inside him. Also i don't think he would have been able to complete Rasengan since he didn't have the huge chakra reserves necessary to maintain such the shape and element effects on the attack.
Naruto,3bziox,dynrte,6,Fri Jul 3 14:22:57 2015 UTC,"The Kurama point is very debatable. He could have handled the situation differently and used a different seal that wasn't the Death Reaper Seal but he didn't know what to do with Kurama. He thought Naruto was the child of prophecy so he gave him Kurama but had to do something with the other half. Had he chosen to seal it all within himself he could have lived and raised Naruto, but he wanted Kushina to meet Naruto and he wanted to make Naruto strong.  And what makes you think he wouldn't have been able to complete Rasengan? If he masters Sage Mode he wouldn't have to worry about the limits of his chakra and could develop a powerful move using Sage Mode and Rasengan. There's also the point that he did have a good chakra pool because he can spam Flying Thunder God over and over."
Naruto,3bziox,ABashfulTurnip,0,Fri Jul 3 14:33:10 2015 UTC,"I think he would never have sealed it in himself no matter the situation, even if he hadn't sealed it in Naruto he would have had to reseal Kurama in Kushina to keep her alive.  And the reason i think he wouldn't of finished Rasengan is because I don't think he would have mastered sage mode, when naruto is learning it at Mount Myoboku Fukasaku says how only those like him and Jiraiya with large amounts of chakra are able to master it (while Minato had a decent amount Naruto was said to have nearly 100 times what kakashi did). While it might be that Minato isn't mentioned simply because he didn't master it or because of not wanting to spoil the big reveal that he is naruto's dad. And without sage mode I don't think he would have enough control to be able to properly complete Rasengan."
Naruto,3bziox,dynrte,5,Fri Jul 3 14:53:03 2015 UTC,"Before we go any further I need a source for this claim:   when naruto is learning it at Mount Myoboku Fukasaku says how only those like him and Jiraiya with large amounts of chakra are able to master it    If you get that source then we can continue.  Lots of things wrong with this as well. Jiraiya never mastered it. Minato actually achieved Perfect Sage Mode, he just didn't know how to utilize it very well in battle. So he did master it. The only step is learning how to use it. Next up, where does it say Jiraiya has a large amount of chakra where as Minato does not?"
Naruto,3bziox,Ninja-Otter,8,Fri Jul 3 14:57:19 2015 UTC,"Just to support you here, Jiraiya didn't master sage mode, the toads mention about how Jiraiya constantly needed their help to do use it. Plus it's also why in the Pain fight, Jiraiya needed to have them on his shoulders. And why Jiraiya's nose started to get warts on it when he went into sage mode."
Naruto,3bziox,ElModeloEnPace,-1,Fri Jul 3 15:07:29 2015 UTC,"he just didn't know how to utilize it very well in battle. So he did master it.   These 2 statements directly contradict one another. That's like knowing how to use a sword, but not being very good at fighting with one. It doesn't matter if you know all of the best techniques if you can't use them effectively. No one would call you a master swordsman."
Naruto,3bziox,dynrte,0,Fri Jul 3 18:25:11 2015 UTC,"These 2 statements directly contradict one another. That's like knowing how to use a sword, but not being very good at fighting    Incorrect. They don't contradict each other. Minato mastered the gathering of nature energy within himself to the point where he did not have any features of a frog - Perfect Sage Mode. Jiraiya immensely struggled with this and needed help to go into sage mode - Minato could do it almost instantly. However, after going into Sage mode he did not know what to do with it (i.e Sage enhanced attacks, Frog Kumite, etc.). Did you even read the manga? It's pretty obvious what transpired."
Naruto,3bziox,kamac496,1 point,Fri Jul 3 18:34:03 2015 UTC,"Incorrect.  From the wiki:   By his own [Minato's] admission, senjutsu is not his strong point, as it takes him too long to gather natural energy (though he is shown entering it without preparation) and he can't maintain it for very long; for this reason he rarely uses it   Minato had the potential to master senjutsu, but didn't master it in the end."
Naruto,3bziox,Yosonimbored,0,Fri Jul 3 19:45:05 2015 UTC,For all we know he could have still been practicing before his death.
Naruto,3bziox,dynrte,0,Fri Jul 3 22:18:28 2015 UTC,He did master the gathering of senjutsu by having Perfect Sage Mode
Naruto,3bziox,Willo101,0,Sat Jul 4 01:16:32 2015 UTC,He could have handled the situation differently and used a different seal that wasn't the Death Reaper Seal but he didn't know what to do with Kurama.   If he had a different seal he would've used it rather then the Death Reaper Seal which is a sacrificial seal.    Had he chosen to seal it all within himself he could have lived and raised Naruto.   The seal he used is a sacrificial seal even if he sealed it all in himself he still would've died.
Naruto,3bziox,Lord4th,2,Fri Jul 3 17:25:20 2015 UTC,If he had the Nine Tails half I agree.  But I was under the assumption he wouldn't have it if he didn't die because sealing was the thing that killed him.
Naruto,3bziox,SHINee21,2,Fri Jul 3 16:23:10 2015 UTC,"You think Minato would be on par with Hashirama just cause he has half the Kyuubi and sagemode? He beat Madara with EMS, whole Kyuubi and perfect Susanoo."
Naruto,3bziox,dynrte,0,Fri Jul 3 15:15:25 2015 UTC,There's a big difference between being a Jinchuriki and attempting to control the Nine-Tails itself from the outside. And you're forgetting that Minato is already powerful in his own right. I also said that he would need to master the Rasengan which he hadn't done yet. He was only age 24 at this time.
Naruto,3bziox,emoka1,0,Fri Jul 3 15:20:37 2015 UTC,"I see your logic but Hashi, Madara and Sasuke and Naruto are reincarnation of ninja gods it'd break the story if other ninjas were able to reach their power or overcome it."
Naruto,3bziox,dynrte,1 point,Fri Jul 3 17:03:33 2015 UTC,"How would it break the story? Guy, Obito, and Kakashi all surpassed the levels of Hashirama. In fact, Hashirama is rather weak in comparison to Peak Madara, Sasuke, and Naruto. They would all wipe the floor with Hashi without much effort.  Guy surpassed Hashirama when he went Eight Gates, that doesn't necessarily mean he surpassed Madara, Sasuke or Naruto.  Kakashi surpassed Hashirama when he went Dual Mangekyo Sharingan with Perfect Susanoo as Kamui is a broken ability.  Obito surpassed Hashirama by becoming the Ten Tails Jinchuriki.  None of those instances ""broke the story"" and there is most certainly room for more ninja to achieve a level higher than Hashirama given time.   Just because they are reincarnations of ""ninja gods"" (who aren't actually gods) means absolutely nothing. They don't gain their power whatsoever. In fact, Naruto would be absolutely useless throughout the story had he not had Kurama. Take away Kurama and Naruto wouldn't have gotten where he is now. That's so godlike for someone who's supposed to have innate power.  Also, the reincarnations don't always do the things they are supposed to. Naruto and Sasuke were reincarnations of the feuding brothers and it was supposed to end with Naruto killing Sasuke to continue the way the Ashura and Indra fought. They broke that destiny when Sasuke admitted his loss.  You act as if every reincarnation of Ashura or Indra will always have some innate power that makes them automatically above everyone else. This isn't true. If that was true then how come Guy, Obito, and Kakashi happened? Hashirama isn't at any of their levels in their peak forms. Did that break the story? No, it didn't."

Naruto,3bziox,Toad_Sage_Jiraiya,0,Fri Jul 3 19:40:43 2015 UTC,"I don't think you can count Kurama as part as Minato's powers he might have had. As others have said he likely would have sealed it in Kushina/Naruto rather than himself. There is no reason to believe he could have mastered the rasengan, but i will say he could have mastered SM.   I think the 4th could have been above the 2nd and 3rd, but i really don't see him ever competing with the 1st. Hashi is just that OP."
Naruto,3bziox,Ninja-Otter,-3,Fri Jul 3 21:52:51 2015 UTC,"If you're caught up with the manga, then I don't think theres any doubt about why he wouldn't catch up to Hashi. But ignoring that, Wood release was extremely powerful, plus he could use healing jutsu without any signs, which noone else can do. Also he managed to capture the Bijuu, Minato would never be able to do that.   Also, Sage mode wouldn't help Minato, from my understanding he never chose to master it because it didn't help at all with his fighting style."
Naruto,3bziox,dynrte,6,Fri Jul 3 14:22:30 2015 UTC,"I am caught up with the manga and I think there is plenty of reason to believe he can catch up to it. You're the one who sounds like he's not caught up considering a few oversights.   healing jutsu without any signs, which noone else can do.   Jinchuriki can do this. At the very least the Nine-Tails Jinchuriki can which I gave Minato for this situation.   Also, Sage mode wouldn't help Minato, from my understanding he never chose to master it because it didn't help at all with his fighting style.   It would help him immensely. There's no reason it wouldn't. He said he wasn't very good at using it. He was still young and could have trained with it, he was very astonished when he saw Naruto mastered the Sage technique. No reason to believe it wouldn't help his fighting style considering it's a huge powerup."
Naruto,3bziox,Ninja-Otter,-2,Fri Jul 3 14:25:21 2015 UTC,"Sage mode is understandable.  Healing - The healing jutsu that Hashi can use is a form of the Strength of a Hundred seal that Tsunade and Sakura use, just it is even more powerful, plus he can use the same healing jutsus as Tsunade and Sakura without hand signs to an even greater level. He is the only one that can do it. Also the reason that Naruto heals fast is because of Kurama, yes. BUT he cannot heal anyone else with it.   Finally, and this is where the spoilers come in. s"
Naruto,3bziox,dynrte,2,Fri Jul 3 14:34:48 2015 UTC,"It doesn't matter if he can't heal anyone else or not. If we're talking a one on one fight between Hashirama and Minato the fact that he can't heal others doesn't even come into play.  Next point, he actually can heal others. If you master the Nine Tails you can give your chakra to other people, thus, healing them.  And for your last point Spoilers"

Naruto,3bziox,elxx714,0,Fri Jul 3 19:07:35 2015 UTC,What makes you think his chakra reserves are low? Also he supposedly had perfect susano and not to mention amazing deductive skills in combat

Nobody is knocking his deductive skills in combat, but the 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th had great deductive skills in combat as well as do Shikamaru and Shikaku Nara. Do we ever actually see a full bodied Susano from Itachi though? When I think perfect Susano I'm thinking of what we see from Kakashi, Madara and Sasuke."
Naruto,3bziox,EriGorman,0,Fri Jul 3 21:22:23 2015 UTC,He had low reserves due to ninja aids. And even with it his chakra was enough to go even with Sasuke (who at the time had Orochimaru limiting him)
Naruto,3bziox,bayoemman,1 point,Sat Jul 4 22:28:12 2015 UTC,"Thats not true, it has nothing to do with ninja aids and there is nothing to show that his illness limited his stamina, Itachi stamina wise wasn't a powerhouse, and he's never shown himself to be that kind of fighter who just throws out massive jutsu one after another, whereas we have ninja like Nagato, Sasuke, Madara, Naruto and Jiraiya who are known for their much larger reserves.

Naruto,3bziox,MattValtezzy,1 point,Sat Jul 4 23:29:49 2015 UTC,"If Minato got to live in his 30s, he would have surpassed both the 2nd and the 3rd. Imagine Minato with more ninjutsu, who has years of practice time for his sage mode. He probably would have been able to create a rasenshuriken-like jutsu. So we now have a 30-35 year old minato, who is  an experienced ninja with more ninjustsu, an OP rasengan and sage mode. Now THATS potential. Imagine something like a faster Jiraiya with a better rasengan and more talent."
Naruto,3bziox,FanoftheFalls,1 point,Sat Jul 4 15:38:52 2015 UTC,"I'd actually argue that he was stronger than Tobirama when he died but if he were to be able to surpass Hashi, well...  I could confidently say that if he lived longer, he'd easily be on Hiruzen's prime level if not surpassing that. But here's where things get tricky. If he had lived, he wouldn't have half of the Kyuubi in him for starters. He would've had to work another 20 years or so (at least that's what Kakashi said) in order to perfect his form of the Rasenshuriken and around that length of time to stabilize Perfect Sage Mode for battles.  Also what should be taken into consideration is that he probably would've continued being Hokage for a long time (like Hiruzen) and this leads to weakening of power in times of relative peace (which probably would've happened as he stays working as Hokage along with Tobito never attacking) or better known as ""The Gohan Effect."" As Hokage, he'd be busy ruling over the village, raising Naruto Spoilers with Kushina and speaking of Kushina, probably making siblings for Naruto since when you have a Waifu that looks like this, nobody would blame you (I guess). You know what that doesn't leave much time for, extensive training. ""The Gohan Effect"" took its toll on Hiruzen (well not nearly as much as age but still), Spoilers so I doubt Minato would've been exempt from it. I'm obviously saying this from a place of love for Minato (my 2nd favorite character in the series & would've been #1 if we'd seen more of him) but he probably would've gotten stronger than petered out for the rest of his life however longer he would've stayed alive under normal circumstances but I kinda dobut that he would've gotten as strong as Hashi if he'd live the rest of his normal life. If he had the half Kyuubi in him, it might've been different but that wouldn't have happened unless he died the way he did. Also Hashi was the reincarnate of a God figure so Minato's also at that disadvantage which doesn't means he couldn't get to Hashi's level (just look at Gai) but it'd be that much harder. Anyway, gotta close this out like I do with anything relating to Minato on this sub.  Minato has died   Minato has risen  Minato will rise again"
Naruto,3bziox,MattValtezzy,1 point,Fri Jul 3 20:54:36 2015 UTC,"I think the comparison with Tobirama is slightly unfair. It's asking who is smarter, the guy who invented the lightbulb or the guy who perfected it."

Naruto,3bziox,MattValtezzy,1 point,Sat Jul 4 01:08:13 2015 UTC,"I think, that based on the jutsu he invented, Tobimara was definitely the smarter one. Compared to the Rasengan (a good, but not a holy shit game changer jutsu) Edo Tensei, Shadow Clone and FTG had far more impact on the Narutoverse.

Now they were not loyal to itachi they just didn't know the real reason behind itachi destroying the uchiha clan. They thought he did it because they were weak compared to their former glory his basic part 1 reasoning.

In the heat of battle, between ""Madara"" and Minato, there isn't anyone else to put Kurama into.

Sealing the 9 tails within her would have also had the added ""benefit"" of taking away one some of the military strength of Konoha."
Naruto,3c1m5s,Wraxu,2,Sat Jul 4 01:48:36 2015 UTC,"you know, that poses a great point. obviously for plot reasons kurarma had to be sealed into naruto. i don't think they make any mention/implication of why they chose to seal it into naruto over kushina (besides him being the ""savior of the world""/""child of the prophecy""; i think minato assumed that naruto would be able to control kurama one day and would use him to save the world)."
Naruto,3c1m5s,animetheory,1 point,Fri Jul 3 22:49:01 2015 UTC,He probably didn't know about the resealing thing until in the war when he was told by Gaara.   Or he knew that to defeat this guy (Tobi) they would need someone who could control the 9 tails which Kushina could not but Naruto possibly could
Naruto,3c1m5s,elxx714,1 point,Fri Jul 3 23:02:19 2015 UTC,"Only explanation I could think of was re-sealing Kurama was his original plan if it would save her, but Kurama obviously wasn't just going to sit there and let them seal him away again. She was using her last bit of strength for the uzumaki chains to restrain him and I'm guessing they let their guard down. When Kurama went to kill Naruto, the two of the combined were just enough to stop his claw from impaling naruto as well.   Just re-watched their death and it would of been better if sealing him into Naruto was a last resort since they were caught off guard with Kurama breaking free and attempting to kill the baby. He could of sealed away half of Kurama into Naruto and Kushina if that was possible at all."
Naruto,3c1m5s,IAmTheNick96,1 point,Sat Jul 4 00:10:42 2015 UTC,"Plain and simple, Minato lacked the power to defeat Kurama so sealing Kurama back into Kushina was an impossibility. Therefor Minato resorted to Reaper Death Seal."

Naruto,3c116x,GilbertGolduser,2,Sat Jul 4 04:16:35 2015 UTC,"okay lecture begins, first off its good to know sound is simply vibrations. in TFOD dosu  states that he can blow out peoples ear drums (he destroyed lees ear drum) this takes 150 decibels and he does it on a miss and quite easily, in the same fight he destroys the log trap with the melody arm and one had sign, the vibrations needed to explode something like that is about 250-300 decibels at this level of decibels the human ear cant hear the sound anymore and it just becomes intense vibrations, similar to the shockwave of a very large explosion (1 ton tnt bomb), this intense ability combined with dosu's ability to use his chakra to focus all the vibrations straight to the point he wants ( i believe he also states this when fighting lee). so he essentially controls shockwaves. also sound waves  travel incredibly long distances until the sound is dispersed to a hz to low for humans to detect and then even less after that, dosu again can control the waves and concentrate them where he desires( enabling the possibility of mid range), assuming as a genin he doesn't have perfect chakra control he would only be able to have weaponised sound up to about 80ft anything after that and someone like lee would msot likely be fast enough to change location, a normal person or someone like sakura would not.  sound waves (vibrations) travel faster through different mediums,through air assuming them temp is 68degrees F is about 373 m/s, through water  is 1482 m/s and speed of sound through granite is 5950 m/s  , many solids the speed changes based on what its going through,  traveling through Beryllium sound has a speed of 12890 m/s or 42530 feet per second.so if dosu were to put his hand on the ground and use resonating echo drill ( the jutsu he uses for most of his attacks, in this particular example when he explodes the giant log) he could control the vibration that are going 9.75 times faster than the speed of sound in air (sound in concrete in 3600 m/s) and basically shake opponents apart from the legs up."

Naruto,3c116x,Dosu_Kinuta,17,Sat Jul 4 21:49:10 2015 UTC,"That Sakura should have been impaled by sasuke during the 5 kage summit ark.  Sasuke goes in, kakashi can't save sakura, and she gets impaled. Naruto watches from on top of the bridge in horror as the woman he loves, and his best friend is killed in front of him by his other bestfriend.  Later in the series as we learn the parallel between kakashi and obito it would have been perfect. It also would have added so much more drama into the final moments of the series and really changed the tone. It also would have made naruto and sasukes last fight more epic. We would have had no idea if sasuke was going to make it out alive or not.  Last time I brought this up I got downvoted and told that ""it's not that kind of story."" Which yeah I know but I can dream damnit!!!"
Naruto,3c116x,chaos122345,2,Sat Jul 4 03:53:12 2015 UTC,"That's really good. I know sakura fans would whine about it, but that kind of writing is how you build tension in a story. The parallel would have been great, the dark ending for a girl who did nothing but love him gets killed by him mercilessly bit, the final battle, ah it would have made the wait for the ending and the cooperation between naruto and Sasuke SO tense.  Your idea is good and it would have made the story better overall. It would completely change the ""happy ending"" thing but at least it would feel real compared to a fairy tail like what we got."
Naruto,3c116x,katniss_everjeans,26,Sat Jul 4 15:39:54 2015 UTC,Sasuke is a better character than Naruto.

Naruto,3c116x,Bolded,4,Fri Jul 3 20:49:05 2015 UTC,I know right ? I was sighing when I saw this because it just meant one more mode for Minato.  Its subsequent poor performance against Madara and explanation about being bad at it convinced me that it wasn't that bad however.
Naruto,3c116x,HokageEzio,2,Fri Jul 3 21:12:56 2015 UTC,"KCM makes complete sense, but Sage Mode, nope.  But Sage Mode is absolute crap.  You're telling me he fought the man he saw as the future Raikage, and the 8 tails jinchuriki, but didn't even attempt to use a shadow clone for Sage Mode.  Ok.  Seems legit."
Naruto,3c116x,Ultimatenut,7,Fri Jul 3 21:17:49 2015 UTC,"Well, let's not forget that the reason Naruto's able to do use shadow clones like that is because of his ridiculously massive amount of natural chakra as a result of his Uzumaki heritage, something Minato doesn't have. It's already hard for him to gather up nature energy efficiently. If he divided his chakra in half, it would be significantly harder to maintain the required proportion of nature energy vs. Chakra energy. Also, don't forget that Cloud Shinobi, like A and B, specialize in speed. A fight with them probably isn't gonna last very long. Just playing devil's advocate."
Naruto,3c116x,HokageEzio,2,Fri Jul 3 21:38:37 2015 UTC,"All you need is one clone.  If Kakashi can make 3?, Minato can waste more than enough for a massive power boost.  And knowing how forward thinking Minato is, he'd have a clone in the back of his squad ready to sit and gather natural energy if the time comes.  That's just his look on strategy."
Naruto,3c116x,Bolded,1 point,Fri Jul 3 21:45:57 2015 UTC,"Maybe he didn't learn it at the time, the dialogue would also indicate that it wasn't planned, and given A/KB's speed, setting up a shadow clone without it being pulverized to paste or forced to move around would've been impossible for all his skills."

The Ninja system was based on brutality and violence and their actions were a reaction to the injustice of the ninja system. Sasuke was correct to want to kill the 5 Kage, just as much as he was correct to want to kill Kabuto, Obito and Madara.   Naruto represents peace and understanding, and a lack of blame. Him forgiving Obito, Kabuto and Madara is consistent with his views. If Naruto held hatred for them, he would be hypocritical to not hate the Kage as well.  What I am trying to say is Obito really is the coolest guy, and Kabuto helping Orphans in the village makes sense."
Naruto,3c116x,dynrte,1 point,Fri Jul 3 22:27:28 2015 UTC,I couldn't agree with you more. The village system was pretty damn bad as far as the peace of the world goes (but logical for the individual countries). The biggest screw up is Hashirama attempting  to make nice with the other villages and giving them Tailed Beasts.   Hashirama had the opportunity to keep all the power in Konoha which could have led the world down a better path. Hashirama's next big mistake is what Madara pointed out: not giving his successors a way to revive him. Hashirama was way too trusting...
Naruto,3c116x,sunwukong15,1 point,Sat Jul 4 21:24:17 2015 UTC,"I think thats a bit unfair towards Hashirama, we don't know how bad things could get if Konoha had kept all the tailed beasts. We also don't know much about the politics of that time period.  My theory is Hashirama handing out the tailed beasts was a way to avoid war. I suspect the other 4 nations would have forged an alliance and ganged up on Konoha. As powerful as Hashirama was he can't defend the country from 4 different fronts, and they also wouldn't really be able to control the tailed beasts in battle."
Naruto,3c116x,dynrte,1 point,Sun Jul 5 04:39:44 2015 UTC,"It isn't really unfair. Hashirama trusted far too many people with the peace of the world. He attempted to bring peace between the nations by distributing weapons of mass destruction (the tailed beasts), but this failed miserably and instead led to more unnecessary conflict. He trusted Madara way too much despite everyone's warnings.  Hashirama made the wrong decision in distributing the tailed beasts. He should have kept them within Konoha, doing his duty to not only protect the Fire Country (put his native country in serious danger by distributing tailed beasts), but the world. Hashirama could have led the villages down a better path (and possibly united the villages) if he had kept the tailed beasts in Konoha because then the villages could not get power hungry because Konoha could deal with them swiftly.  As such, the villages would be forced to cooperate with Konoha and even though they may not initially like it, they would be forced to.  Also, the tailed beasts don't necessarily need to be controlled for them to be used. Just the threat of having them is always there. You don't need to control the tailed beasts to use them.. at all. Examples of this include the sand using Gaara who had no control over Shukaku, Obito using the Nine-Tails, and the mist's attempt at using the Three-Tails on Konoha.  When a beast is unleashed it's hard to stop it. Just the threat of having the tailed beast is huge.   It's well known that the Senju and Uchiha are the strongest clans in Naruto (aside from the Otsutsuki Clan, but they didn't belong to a village and are scattered)... With the eight tailed beasts they had they were in a very good spot. Also the Sarutobi clan and Shimura clan joined very early.  Hashirama admitted himself he made a lot of mistakes and I would hold him partially responsible for the state of the world as it was. At the very least he contributed heavily to the future wars."

Naruto,3c116x,FalseCape,6,Sat Jul 4 04:34:24 2015 UTC,That The Last isn't canon because there's no way in fuck Naruto was using shadow clone jutsu @ 5 years old and that's literally the first scene of the movie.
Naruto,3c116x,okaytran,5,Sat Jul 4 04:06:00 2015 UTC,"there are some plotholes. but if the definition of canon is the original author's ideas and storytelling, then the Last is mostly canon. but yeah you're right, it has a very filler-ish vibe that most naruto movies have. people just like it cause naruhina."
Naruto,3c116x,GaBeRockKing,4,Sat Jul 4 05:04:35 2015 UTC,"The Last actually happened, but what we see is how Naruto tells it to an audience, and as we see in Gaiden he has a tendency to exaggerate his own accomplishments."
Naruto,3c116x,FalseCape,5,Sat Jul 4 05:54:21 2015 UTC,"You know, I've heard various justifications every time I've voiced this complaint, but that's definitely the first one I'm willing to accept. I really like that explanation."
Naruto,3c116x,DoubleHunter,15,Sat Jul 4 05:59:08 2015 UTC,"Danzo is by FAR the best villain of the series Tobirama is by FAR the most badass character in the series Part 1 was good, but still somewhat overrated Kabuto is not as bad of a character as some people make him out to be There's almost nothing wrong with Tobi being Obito. The fault lies with the execution of his motives I don't care about Asuma   Edit.   Hiruzen has by FAR the best theme music The Edo Hokages saved the War arc Shikamaru is pretty much the only consistently well developed character"

Naruto,3c116x,DFAnton,7,Sat Jul 4 02:37:39 2015 UTC,"Danzo had actual motivations and went about things in a realistic, calculated manner. Black Zetsu was basically an out-of-nowhere villain of Aizen like proportions (I've been manipulating everything forever!)"

Naruto,3c116x,GilbertGolduser,1 point,Sat Jul 4 12:00:30 2015 UTC,I still disagree. We were hinted at Black Zetsu being much more than we were led to believe by his appearance at the fight with Madara and Hashirama. And for Kishi to have known he was the villain behind it all this whole time leaves me with no reason to believe he isn't the best villain.

Naruto,3c116x,DoubleHunter,5,Sat Jul 4 21:12:26 2015 UTC,"Where to begin.   He is his own man, and not a puppet or a pawn in someone else's plans. He has a personal connection with one of the two main characters. He's at the end of the day a pretty average dude. He doesn't hail from a super powerful clan, he isn't a reincarnation of a demigod and even his most powerful techniques are stolen from others. He's motives are pretty interesting. He's been a Konoha ninja since pretty much the foundation of the village. He's seen it all: the three Great Ninja Wars, Madara attacking Hashirama, Tobi's Nine Tails attack, the Uchiha plotting a coup, etc. So he knows of the threat the other clans and countries possess, so his radical patriotism is understandable. That's way more interesting than just unquestionably following the orders of your creator. He leaves a huge impact on the plot. Kabuto joining Orochimaru, Nagato becoming Pain and the Uchiha Massacre are all at least partly the direct or indirect result of his actions. Naruto talks about his dream of becoming the Hokage without even thinking about the negatives of the position. Danzo has devoted his life to doing what he thinks is the best for the village, and he pretty much prevented another Great Ninja War from erupting by doing so. And what has he gotten in return? He's killed by a guy who after a few days thought about doing the same things as he had. The humiliation! Out of all the characters in the series, Danzo is the one who embodies being a ninja the best. The majority of the population knows nothing of his actions, he masks the parts of his body that show his true power and nature, his servants are just people who he has turned to obedient servants through training and even his attacks are harder to see than your average Rasengans and fireballs.   PS. It doesn't take him multiple centuries to put his plans into motion."
Naruto,3c116x,Lord4th,12,Sat Jul 4 09:22:41 2015 UTC,Tobirama is overrated.  Hiruzen is the weakest Hokage.  Itachi could beat Jiraiya in a fight.  A ton of part 1 is now invalid because Kishi isn't a good writer and couldn't keep what was said consistent with what was shown.
Naruto,3c116x,AFatz,2,Fri Jul 3 23:22:49 2015 UTC,"Full health Itachi, imo, would have wrecked Jiraiya  EDIT: Shouldn't say wrecked. But I don't think Jiraiya could beat him once in ten matches."
Naruto,3c116x,Lord4th,5,Sat Jul 4 01:58:13 2015 UTC,"Yup, hell I think sick Itachi could beat Jiraiya 6 or 7/10."
Naruto,3c116x,AFatz,1 point,Sat Jul 4 02:01:50 2015 UTC,I don't disagree. Though it would be quite a bit closer. Even though Itachi could probably just open up with Susanoo and I'm not sure what Jiraiya could do.
Naruto,3c116x,Lord4th,1 point,Sat Jul 4 02:09:04 2015 UTC,The reason IMO why Jiraiya would lose is his defenses aren't up to snuff against Itachi.
Naruto,3c116x,dynrte,1 point,Sat Jul 4 02:22:46 2015 UTC,Disagree. Jiraiya had his special barrier that he could retreat into that not even a hardcore sensor type like Pain could find.
Naruto,3c116x,Lord4th,1 point,Sat Jul 4 21:05:39 2015 UTC,Itachi has the Sharingan. That could potentially detect the chakra. Although I could be completely wrong.
Naruto,3c116x,dynrte,1 point,Sun Jul 5 00:45:05 2015 UTC,"Unlikely. Nagato couldn't detect Jiraiya's presence with his rain technique in the village until he got out of his toad barrier.  Jiraiya's defenses are pretty damn strong. Itachi has no chance unless he's healthy Itachi, as sick Itachi wouldn't be able to spam his abilities enough to kill Jiraiya. Jiraiya can also create swamps and the inside of a toad's mouth."
Naruto,3c116x,dynrte,1 point,Sun Jul 5 00:50:15 2015 UTC,"Sick Itachi would have to go all out against Jiraiya and would end up dying on overuse of his powers...  Only reason he stayed alive was the willpower to face Sasuke in a fight. If sick Itachi went against Jiraiya, at best they both would have died. No way does Itachi live through the fight especially with Jiraiya toad summons getting kills for Jiraiya from the grave."

Naruto,3c116x,dynrte,1 point,Sat Jul 4 04:27:19 2015 UTC,"Seriously? You're reading WAY too much into these statements. Not going to comment on the substitution jutsu because I'm not sure what you mean, but the other two:   Hiruzen being the ""strongest Hokage"" was a biased and uneducated character statement by Iruka. Iruka was not even alive to see Hashirama or Tobirama in action and saw Hiruzen as a fatherly figure. Iruka's statment has zero credibility. Itachi literally had ZERO reason to fight Jiraiya. He said what he said because he didn't want Kisame to be picking a fight with Jiraiya. Yes, it may have been an incorrect statement (which is still very debatable), but Itachi had no reason to fight Jiraiya whatsoever. You also have to take into consideration that Itachi had already used Tsukuyomi twice in a timespan of twenty-four hours. He would not be able to go all out in his condition, and Jiraiya can use Kisame's water in his favor."
Naruto,3c116x,Lord4th,1 point,Sat Jul 4 21:11:33 2015 UTC,I don't think you understand what I meant. We are in agreement.  I mean people used these quotes you just listed as facts.   Those quotes are invalid. Because of the reasons you listed.

Sasuke's life was way more lonely and painful than Naruto's.  Danzo and Obito were cowards who'd rather run away from truths than face it. They are vilians that don't deserve sympathy.  Naruto should've killed people.  The child of prophecy stuff shouldn't have been there.  Sasuke and Sakura shouldn't have ended up together. Sakura should've ended up with someone like Lee.  Gai, Tsunade etc should've died in the war. In fact it would've been nice if Kishi had killed off Chouji or Ino, breaking the Ino-shika-chou, that would've been truly tragic like in Harry Potter Spoilers.  I could go on forever.

Naruto,3c116x,CRAEREASDW,5,Fri Jul 3 22:32:27 2015 UTC,"I think Kaguya's colors are shit. Yellow and purple clash, that's why Naruto and Sasuke have them as their colors. Putting them on white just makes them stand out more and it looks garish. I'm not excited for 8 gates Guy because he will necessarily have to fight at long range. It'll just be air pressure spam unless they ignore Madara's staff of disintegration and orbs of annihilation. I think Pain's backstory was underwhelming, but don't mind Obito going nuts over a girl. During the war, I really did think he was the coolest guy. Hagoromo is Hiruzen/responsible for all the bad shit. They even have the same beard. I didn't care about DMS Kakashi coming out of nowhere. I was so hyped when that happened. I think Sasuke was inferior to Naruto in their final fight and cheated to a draw. He is also irrationally petty and psychotic. I think Naruto and Sasuke were stronger than triclops Madara. Naruto alone could counter pretty much everything Madara threw at them and with Sasuke there, they would have won for sure. I liked Madara getting rekt by Zetsu. It was a fitting end for the chessmaster to have been a pawn in a larger scheme. The larger scheme was dumb, but whatever. Kishi should draw a picture of Obito stumbling across Rin cheating on him for Madara. Konan was a low tier fighter in the manga, though the anime managed to make her look good. Her only power is a worse version of Tobirama's own paper tag technique. Sakura's pain is always amusing and often deserved. Her contributions are token at best and she doesn't really belong on the same team as Naruto and Sasuke. Obito's defeat was a perfect end to the war with equal parts teamwork and TnJ. Madara's return started a trend of asspull no jutsus. Tobirama was the third weakest Hokage. Tsunade was vastly more powerful than a sharinganless Kakashi, making him the weakest. Kaguya did nothing wrong. Tenten should have defeated Madara with the sage tools. That plot point went nowhere. It was pretty obvious from the start that Hinata was introduced to become Naruto's main love interest and Sakura Sasuke's. Hanabi is better than Hinata. Like Kurama vs Shukaku better.  Madara and Obito were more responsible for world peace than Naruto was. I like ending 32 best. Himiwari is a pointless character. The story would be the same if she had never been added. Sorry, you asked for opinions."

It got to where I didn't want Gai to die, but I was ready for it; but no.

Also unsure if this is unpopular, but I hate Hinata. The only girl I would have less preferred Naruto end up with would have been Sakura.   Also, not so much an opinion, but I refuse to believe to that Samui is anything more than two or three years older than Naruto.

Naruto,3c116x,dynrte,1 point,Sat Jul 4 21:11:31 2015 UTC,"Honestly that's pretty bad reasoning for you to sound so angry about Samui (a very minor character) being 29 years old to the point where you refuse to believe even what the author has to say about it. Citing fanfictions for your reasoning only makes it worse.  Sorry, I just can't even see where your anger is coming from."
Naruto,3c116x,onlytoask,1 point,Sat Jul 4 21:16:22 2015 UTC,"I'm not angry and I don't know why you think I am. I care only for the reason any of us care about the series. I just refuse to believe she's that old. I'm not citing fanfiction as my reasoning for thinking she's younger than canon states, just to make a point that I'm not the only one that never even thought she was anywhere near that old.   Also, I've read hundreds of Naruto fanfictions, most of them of high quality and some I find more enjoyable than canon. When only counting those over 100,000 words, I've read a total of 15,573,618 words of Naruto fanfiction, about 45,000 pages worth, or over 14 times the length of the total Harry Potter series. I've spent far more time reading them than I did reading the manga itself. Because of that, there aren't really any characters that are minor to me. I care about a lot more than just the main characters of canon because a lot of them have been significant, or more significant than in canon, in novel length stories I've read. Samui, for example, is a relatively important character in one of my favorites, called The Howling Wind."

Naruto,3c116x,dustymons,5,Fri Jul 3 22:38:35 2015 UTC,"Ohhhh, I have a few   Sakura is the single worst character in the series, I feel she could have been replaced by a shadow clone of Naruto wearing a pink wig, and the series would have been better for it. Obito is the coolest guy (okay, maybe that one's popular). I really would have loved to see more fun adventures with team 7 after the whole zabuza arc. The fact that it just jumped from Zabuza, to Chuunin test, to Sasuke retrieval, to right around 100 episodes of grade A filler is horrible. I would have loved a few more actually good main story arcs to make the series a little bit better. I didn't mind a lot of the filler. Some of it was bad, but most of it was pretty silly and definitely paced things out. What I didn't like was filler right in the middle of an epic story arc (mecha-Naruto, anyone?)."

Guy should have died after using the 8 Gates.  I didn't mind the whole Zetsu/Kaguya debacle.  I liked Kakashi getting double MS Perfect Susanoo.  Rock Lee and Tenten should have gotten married and Metal Lee should be their child.  Konaha 11 + Sai should have gotten more focus throughout the series. Obito is my favorite character.

Naruto,3c2tgr,Kyuubi87,2,Sat Jul 4 17:09:10 2015 UTC,It's a shame Kishimoto forgot about Sasuke's relationship with his father in part II.  The irony of it all would have been wonderful to read.

Naruto,3c19fp,Waterbeetles,2,Fri Jul 3 21:16:09 2015 UTC,"errr technically lol , asura and indra chakra need to be present, so when madara combined hashiramas dna with his own, them being asura and indra reincarnation allowed madara to get the rinnegan, so yes you do, if you have the uchiha dna in you you will awaken the sharringan (still has to be activated because of emotions etc)"

I always thought that Hashi would need to get Madara's sharingan rather than the DNA, then the same way as Madara activated the Rinnegan at an old age it would activate."
Naruto,3c19fp,covenantofsoulsVI,3,Fri Jul 3 22:49:59 2015 UTC,"I like to think of it like this: Asura inherited the ""body"" of the sage while Indra inherited the ""eyes."" Combining their powers gives one the power of the sage. Madara took a chunk of Hashirama's body and patched it into himself, meaning he had both the ""body"" and the ""eyes,"" blessing him with the Rinnegan. Perhaps if Hashirama used Madara's original eyes, he too would then possess both powers and develop the Rinnegan.  Unfortunately, we can only speculate since none of Asura's reincarnations have infused themselves with Indra's power."
Naruto,3c19fp,Dosu_Kinuta,0,Sat Jul 4 05:31:05 2015 UTC,no he would then have to go through some kind of emotion trama to get the sharringan

This is about people who don't get paid to run these subreddits not being appreciated and them just having enough and taking a stand. It would be nice if before everyone shut their subreddits down they would take their work elsewhere and provide the means for everyone, even new members, to get there so that reddit users don't have to necessarily suffer without a choice but I can see where they are coming from. These people aren't even workers, they are volunteers and apparently they are not being treated well which does not make sense because if you have people doing a ton of work for you for free you should do what you can to keep them.

Naruto,3byitl,RobbieNewton,1 point,Fri Jul 3 11:18:07 2015 UTC,"yeah im not arguing for a blackout, dont get me wrong. I just think its nice to state your opposition to the admins whether or not you make the subreddit private, which a lot of subreddits have done /r/wow for example.   not doing anything is the worst thing you can do. Atleast we have a thread here and are talking about it, that all that matters. But I do commend the mods of the extremely popular subreddits for ignoring the angry people who just see this as drama and making their subreddit private anyways."
Naruto,3byitl,Butters_Thats_Me,2,Fri Jul 3 12:35:51 2015 UTC,"Not for nothing, and I am not taking sides but usually employers don't present to the public reasons for firing/dismissing an employee."
Naruto,3byitl,AlienVII,3,Fri Jul 3 11:42:08 2015 UTC,"Yes, but for example If subway fires the sandwich maker, doesn't hire a new one, tells nobody, and still opens for business what the fuck do the customers do? This ofcourse sounds extreme, but thats only because you know that subway knows how valuable their sandwich makers are. Reddit admins on the other hand have absolutely no clue how any of this works. They didn't foresee this, which is saying something because anyone could have seen this coming if there was a theoretical question of whether or not she would be fired without being replaced, its obvious to the people who use the site every day that she was a big part of a lot of different subreddits."
Naruto,3byitl,Butters_Thats_Me,0,Fri Jul 3 12:28:45 2015 UTC,"But it doesn't really matter. People get fired all the time, we don't really need a ""warning"" that someone is going to be fired from reddit. This IS a temper tantrum. I don't get how people didn't do this when people were being censored but now that someone is fired EVERYONE is closing their subs and shit? It's plain stupid. I mean I guess how I can see how the mods of /r/iama might have needed a warning but for so many people to close their subs is fucking dumb."
Naruto,3byitl,RoseBladePhantom,1 point,Fri Jul 3 13:23:18 2015 UTC,"you still dont fully grasp the situation, or are just making little of it. Its not about her being fired, it how they fired her. It didn't just affect her.  Imagine if a subway fired their sandwich maker and didn't hire a new one, didn't tell anyone about it, and still opened for business. Thats essentially what it boiled down to."
Naruto,3byitl,tachibanakanade,-13,Sat Jul 4 01:31:11 2015 UTC,"If there are ulterior motives, godspeed. But let's not make this about someone getting fired when we have no idea why they got fired. You could justify it anyway you want, most the comments and remaining content are just making this seem like it's all about Victoria.  Just like with The Fattening a few weeks ago where people not unlike yourself claimed that it was more than just about hating fat people-- It sure didn't seem that way. I don't think I'd be wrong to say most redditors are simply jumping on the bandwagon rather than having a legitimate cause. Hell, maybe it's not fair to say that because it's really only the mods affecting the site right now."
Naruto,3byitl,RoseBladePhantom,19,Fri Jul 3 06:32:44 2015 UTC,"tbh, this is all about Reddit's hate for Ellen Pao."
Naruto,3byitl,FrostyTheSnowNigger,-10,Fri Jul 3 06:35:26 2015 UTC,"I don't even wanna say this is true, but seriously, to not say that this is in anyway shape or form a circlejerk stemming from the blind hatred for Pao and the admins... That'd just be untrue. Are there legitimate reasons to be displeased with them? Of course. Are there legitimate reasons for this blackout? Maybe. But what pisses me off is that this is basically the Ferguson of Reddit. One little thing happens and we're gonna use it as a good excuse to riot under the guise of many other reasons."
Naruto,3byitl,tachibanakanade,9,Fri Jul 3 06:39:16 2015 UTC,"The thing you're not understanding is that this isn't some little thing. It's a bunch of small and medium things mixed with some large things like FPH and now this. This was just the straw that broke he camels back. Mods had enough of it, this has been coming for a while now. And you can't even say it's blind hated toward Ellen pao, people know exactly why they hate her, what's so blind about that?"
Naruto,3byitl,FrostyTheSnowNigger,8,Fri Jul 3 06:56:00 2015 UTC,"They hate her because she got rid of shitty, toxic subs? Oh."
Naruto,3byitl,tachibanakanade,0,Fri Jul 3 06:58:49 2015 UTC,"Yep. You'd be surprised at how much people hate censorship. You can censor a subreddit you don't like, it's not like you have to go to them or see their content."
Naruto,3byitl,Butters_Thats_Me,4,Fri Jul 3 07:05:24 2015 UTC,"At least one of the banned subreddits contained illegal material. Reddit - which is a company, Conde Nast's company - cannot overlook that.    And, quite frankly, it seems like most Redditors don't understand what a company exists to do: make money. Reddit can't make money if it becomes Stormfront 2.0, which it's coming perilously close to (example: /r/conspiracy - one gigantic anti-Semitic forum)."
Naruto,3byitl,Butters_Thats_Me,-1,Fri Jul 3 07:08:53 2015 UTC,reddit cant make money if they do a 180 on the rules and policies that got them to where they are today because the people who give them the traffic dont like this censorship and the admins general shitty communication and lack of understanding of what makes this site so good.
Naruto,3byitl,Hauntmachine,0,Fri Jul 3 07:15:03 2015 UTC,"did you not read what I even typed? I said it doesn't matter if her firing was just or not. The way they did it was absolutely atrocious and affected way more people than just Victoria....  and why would you bring up FPH? Sure some of it was because people hated fat people and jumped on the spam bandwagon, but later that day and for the next few days the majority of posts were about how much people hated ellen pao and censorship, not so much what they censored, but the censorship itself. Jailbait was different, thats illegal and there was child porn going around in PMs with that subreddit, but hating on fat people isn't against the law so even people who didn't agree with the content disagreed with it's censorship."
Naruto,3byitl,KSKaleido,0,Fri Jul 3 06:52:12 2015 UTC,Sounds like it's just the admins/mods having a bitch fit to me. Fuck both groups.

Naruto,3byitl,maurodsimone,8,Fri Jul 3 06:20:33 2015 UTC,please dont downvote /u/Armonster for asking a simple question.  I'm personally for it because it would be a show of unity among moderators.  The Admins decision made things a lot harder for a good deal of subreddits that enjoy having AMA events with whoever is relevant to their interests.    That said if you just like using reddit to enjoy talking about your favorite fandom I can totally see why shutting down a subreddit would be annoying especially if you dont care about all the political bs (im tired of it too).

Keep in mind that in the world of Naruto, these characters are very much outliers when it comes to sheer power. Mangekyo level shinobi are extremely rare, Shin said that Naruto and Sasuke were pretty much the only people he couldn't take on.

Naruto,3bu8dk,da_illest101,23,Thu Jul 2 05:04:42 2015 UTC,Was Suigetsu alluding to the fact he thought Sasuke and Karin were having sex when Karin kept repeating his name?
Naruto,3bu8dk,helterstash,37,Thu Jul 2 05:18:22 2015 UTC,I think he was referring just to when she would say his name all the damn time when they were in Taka together.
Naruto,3bu8dk,ExpressiveSunset,24,Thu Jul 2 07:01:09 2015 UTC,"Sasuke giving someone a hug has to be the greatest development we've seen for him, such an affectionate guy he is! Poor Sakura, she got no poke or kiss... If Kishi only gave us one day in the future Sarada as Hokage with bentos for everyone, I'd be happy.... what a weird mini series, this gaiden...but I'm okay with it."
Naruto,3bu8dk,N4RUT0,21,Thu Jul 2 05:32:05 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I think the whole Shin orphanage thingy is really silly. Like, how are those guys gonna adapt in society. I wish they would have at least ""accidentally"" shaved that number down to only 1 or 2 of them.   Everything else was just great though. Happy ending for Sarada is awesome. Plus, Kuruma got real tired of all this shit."
Naruto,3bu8dk,-Carlos-,83,Thu Jul 2 05:15:58 2015 UTC,I'm still disappointed that Naruto's kids don't have the byakugan. All because Kishi forgot -___-
Naruto,3bu8dk,Cambijao,31,Thu Jul 2 05:07:20 2015 UTC,Nothing prove they don't have it. Since they are half and not full their eyes might transform like the sharingan.
Naruto,3bu8dk,frank_13v,47,Thu Jul 2 05:28:03 2015 UTC,"Didn't expect that much character development from Karin. Goddammit Kishi you know how to make your characters grow in less than five panels.  This chapter is the epitome of everything's that beautiful about the bonds in Naruto  ALSO, SALUTE TO THE CRACK THEORY THAT SARADA WANTED TO BE A HOKAGE. WELL, IT'S NO LONGER A THEORY BY NOW."
Naruto,3bu8dk,RedAutumnLeaf,24,Thu Jul 2 05:31:11 2015 UTC,Feels. Overload. This. Is. Too. Much.   Edit: that's it. The end of naruto. It's been such a ride 4 whole years  I attempted to pick it up when I was 12 but thought it was too childish and 4 years later I was so into it that I used to wake up at 5 am every Wednesday to read it. Can't believe it's over.
Naruto,3bu8dk,FlameBallz,204,Thu Jul 2 05:17:58 2015 UTC,Can't believe some people believed Karin was actually Sarada's mother. Sasuke cheating on Sakura wouldn't fit in a manga like Naruto at all.

Naruto,3bu8dk,2th,47,Thu Jul 2 05:33:15 2015 UTC,Karin did say that suigetsu needs to apologize to sarada for what he did so they will eventually find out

Any post I make you have some snarky ass reply to, hop off my nuts please.  Im just saying i think what they're doing is wrong, and id like it to change beacuse I dont want them to fuck up the final parts of the manga, Leave Kishi's material alone. I have just any right to mention this as you do to be so condescending.  I dont pay for the anime, but i do buy the manga to support the author and because i love the story, and dont want the anime to continue heavily altering it. Wishful thinking? sure, but i can atleast say something about it."

If you don't pay for it, than your complaints, or even the entire sub's complaints, mean nothing.  They are never going to see your complaints, but they will see a loss of money if people stop paying for it.  That is how you hit companies, with your wallet."

But manga-wise, I highly doubt it, I don't remember a time where this happened, and even so, if someone tries doing it, he would always be compared to Kishimoto etc..

For instance, the true ending for me to House MD was Season 6 when he goes crazy and has to go into a mental institute. Everything after that was very much a silly buildup for another kinda cool ending."

Naruto,3buzhs,Jokinzazpi,29,Thu Jul 2 12:31:32 2015 UTC,If your a manga reader there was a whole fiasco about who the mystery foot belonged too.
Naruto,3buzhs,MusicJOO80,3,Thu Jul 2 15:57:26 2015 UTC,What were the most common guesses?
Naruto,3buzhs,GGABueno,10,Thu Jul 2 16:32:05 2015 UTC,"Before it was revealed that Kabuto was saving Sasuke, no one knew who it was (obviously) and all we had seen was the Foot. So we just referred to the character as the Foot or Foot man or something."
Naruto,3buzhs,Dark512,5,Fri Jul 3 08:55:11 2015 UTC,"When the manga came out, people were wondering who the hell that guy was. In the manga, all we saw was the foot. So from there, everyone came up with the most absurd theories. I think the majority  of people knew it was Kabuto."

Naruto,3buzhs,mihirkhatwani,85,Fri Jul 3 01:37:05 2015 UTC,Did kakashi just beat up two full grown men as a 5 year old?  Worst ninjas ever....
Naruto,3buzhs,Croc_Chop,67,Mon Jul 6 07:54:13 2015 UTC,That's fodder ninja for you
Naruto,3buzhs,Kiinako_,27,Thu Jul 2 12:47:35 2015 UTC,"He graduated the academy when he was like 5 years old and could already use jutsus, then he became a jounin 4 years later - i'm not surprised. I'm surprised that he does not seem much stronger currently. I feel like Kakashi should be on the same level as the Sannin or perhaps even stronger based on how talented he was, but it seemd like even Hidan was stronger than Kakashi."
Naruto,3buzhs,Akilee,13,Thu Jul 2 14:55:28 2015 UTC,"but it was just after he entered the academy, so he shouldn't beat up two chunins with that much of ease."
Naruto,3buzhs,k-tax,6,Thu Jul 2 15:05:55 2015 UTC,"He graduated that same year and the next year he became a chunin, I doubt his abilities improved too much in that year. He was already chunin level, he went on missions after graduating and then quickly became a chunin when it was time for the exam. I wouldn't be surprised if Kakashi could have become a Jonin at the age of like 7 or 8 because he was definitely smart enough maybe slightly naive due to his age but still smart enough to be a Jonin level captain. There was probably a restriction like you must complete a certain amount of missions to prove you can become a Jonin or w/e and that's why it took him until 9 years old to become a Jonin. Anyway, my point is Kakashi was extremely talented, I'd say he could compete with Hashirama and Madara when they were 5 years old that kind of talent so even though he has low chakra reserves or stamina he should still be much stronger than he is. I feel like he should have become as strong if not stronger than the Sannins especially since his father was assumed to be stronger than the sannins because his name was more feared or something. I also feel like the only person to be stronger than Kakashi at the age of 5-6 was Uchiha Itachi and that Itachi would become stronger than Madara if he had the same level of chakra reserves."
Naruto,3buzhs,Akilee,3,Thu Jul 2 16:27:38 2015 UTC,"As I recall, Itachi's advancements in academy and later in ninja ranks were slower than Kakashi's.  Still, I believe he learned something in the academy etc. It's not like he uses Chidori at the age of 5, is it?"

Naruto,3buzhs,AllShallFear,45,Thu Jul 2 11:31:23 2015 UTC,"Not this much, Guy watching Kakashi climb a mountain was definitely not in the manga. The next episode is going to probably be 70-80% filler"

Seems kinda premature.   Secondly, I like the alteration showing Kakashi kicking their ass - the manga had them sending him to the hospital, but this way, its a nice introductory touch.  Third, yeah. HYPE!"

The store has bore witness to so many historic events in the village as well as hosting so many important figures. Where else could you find a ramen store that has the patronage of all 5 Kages at the same time? :)

They might be able to do The flashback in this next episode.   I personally would like the song that played for Rock Lee vs Gaara during the chunin exam. Sure it is old but I think it fits.

I'm not an anime guy, i'm into movies, guessing that has something to do with my appreciation on this"

But yeah, this flashback in the manga, people should've known, and they should've known they would put a bunch of filler in the flashback making it last 1-2 episodes."
Naruto,3buzhs,Hanasuki,2,Thu Jul 2 12:44:53 2015 UTC,Everyone please this episode is not filler. It is CANON!
Naruto,3buzhs,jessipassmore,1 point,Thu Jul 2 12:57:49 2015 UTC,How about madara vs gai ? next episode ? or what ?
Naruto,3buzhs,Atarashifatan,1 point,Thu Jul 2 22:06:01 2015 UTC,The feels from that ending.
Naruto,3buzhs,Yosonimbored,1 point,Thu Jul 2 11:44:09 2015 UTC,Please what is this for ending music? Thanks.
Naruto,3buzhs,James2253,1 point,Thu Jul 2 14:28:13 2015 UTC,"Man, a season with Silhouette as the OP and this ED would be too good for words."
Naruto,3bzkki,Jezamiah,2,Fri Jul 3 12:42:52 2015 UTC,"Naruto gaiden manga is over, that being said if kishi wants to do chapters later on he can come back but for now no new chapters I myself do not know when the subbed version will come out and haven't watched it yet"
Naruto,3bzkki,rastogishubham,2,Fri Jul 3 12:49:14 2015 UTC,Thank you for answering :)
Naruto,3bzkki,rastogishubham,3,Fri Jul 3 12:50:57 2015 UTC,No problem happy to help! Look forward to the boruto movie though and there is also a new set of light novels announced so there is some naruto content to look forward too
Naruto,3bzkki,Spartn90,2,Fri Jul 3 12:55:09 2015 UTC,"It comes out on bluray July 24th, so I'd guess a week or so afterwards"
Naruto,3bvjrq,potm-of-the-moon,54,Thu Jul 2 14:31:11 2015 UTC,First Sasuke now his replacement. Naruto's making a habit of stealing the guys Ino likes.  Edit: Now that I look at it again Ino looks kinda into it.
Naruto,3bvjrq,night4345,26,Thu Jul 2 15:07:39 2015 UTC,"To be honest, Naruto looks creeped out as hell."
Naruto,3bvjrq,bayoemman,11,Thu Jul 2 16:17:25 2015 UTC,Exactly... You can just tell she's having some hardcore yaoi fantasies right there.
Naruto,3bvjrq,Mixthefox,7,Thu Jul 2 21:22:56 2015 UTC,She's wishing she was those chopsticks
Naruto,3bvjrq,m0rena,13,Thu Jul 2 22:31:40 2015 UTC,Wouldn't be the first time
Naruto,3bvjrq,_JAD3N,5,Thu Jul 2 16:42:33 2015 UTC,Pretty sure that's what this is referencing.
Naruto,3bvjrq,idontevenknowbrah,11,Thu Jul 2 20:21:43 2015 UTC,I'm more worried about Ino's index finger.
Naruto,3bvjrq,henne-n,2,Thu Jul 2 18:16:52 2015 UTC,Pretty sure its lustful ino :D
Naruto,3bvjrq,Toad_Sage_Jiraiya,1 point,Fri Jul 3 04:09:27 2015 UTC,Which ep?
Naruto,3bvjrq,IamNR,1 point,Fri Jul 3 10:34:45 2015 UTC,Its in the new ed that just came out in the Guy vs Madara episode.
Naruto,3bvjcn,AotsukiAyame,84,Thu Jul 2 14:27:28 2015 UTC,"He could just mean he wont draw anything further Naruto related. Although after 710 chapters, 11 movies, and extra art and concept for the games and anime fillers, you cant blame the guy for wanting to put his pen down."
Naruto,3bvjcn,papa_smurphy,32,Thu Jul 2 14:34:01 2015 UTC,"This was my guess. He's already expressed his satisfaction with the Naruto series and wants to pursue his career as a mangaka in another capacity; so he probably wants to continue drawing, but wants to work on something different."
Naruto,3bvjcn,kaito0,3,Thu Jul 2 14:50:51 2015 UTC,"I'll support whatever he decides to do next, though I hope it's something sci-fi-ish or fantasy."
Naruto,3bvjcn,irishsaltytuna,3,Thu Jul 2 18:41:41 2015 UTC,"I honestly don't read enough manga for it to matter too much to me, although I might depending on what he chooses. I'm not too particular when it comes to which mangaka I prefer to read."
Naruto,3bvjcn,kaito0,1 point,Thu Jul 2 19:48:47 2015 UTC,"You can be guaranteed that it's gonna get an anime unless it's absolute shit, and even then it might still.  A Sensei of Kishi's caliber is guaranteed to be published in his next endeavor, and practically guaranteed an anime.  I'm probably gonna wait until whatever he makes next is animated."
Naruto,3bvjcn,gerrettheferrett,1 point,Fri Jul 3 04:22:06 2015 UTC,"I usually prefer to wait for anime adaptations of manga or light novels myself. Not because I like watching animation, but because by the time an anime comes out the story is usually guaranteed to have the body of it's story already developed. I hate waiting for things."
Naruto,3bvjcn,kaito0,1 point,Fri Jul 3 04:35:55 2015 UTC,"I hope he does something similar. The thing that attracted me to this anime is the fact that Naruto had a bad ass demon inside of him that he was able to use when he was in a time of extreme panic. That always kept me excited during fights, because I always had hope that he will win by turning into something ridiculously cool and destroy the opponent. Same with Sasuke's curse mark in the early chapters."
Naruto,3bvjcn,ON2000,39,Fri Jul 3 02:17:42 2015 UTC,"he could Pull an Akira Toriyama and not draw anything dbz related for 20 years LOL, i don't blame him financially he should be set for life with the success of nartuo.   but i do take it as ""i won't draw anything Naruto related"" more than "" i'm retiring"""
Naruto,3bvjcn,sangai,6,Thu Jul 2 15:26:57 2015 UTC,"Honestly, this is kind of what I am thinking will happen."
Naruto,3bvjcn,Darkar123,1 point,Thu Jul 2 18:57:29 2015 UTC,Seeing as Dragon Ball releases a game about once a year he can make plenty off royalties if Naruto does the same thing.
Naruto,3bvjcn,TeTrodoToxin4,2,Fri Jul 3 04:51:43 2015 UTC,"Just look at the reviews and sales the Ninja Storm Games pull off. There WILL be new games after the Storm Series, no way around it :D"
Naruto,3bvjcn,KHlover,14,Fri Jul 3 07:44:35 2015 UTC,"Give the dude a year off and let's see where we are.  The world of Naruto is just too well built out to not have more stories told in it. On the other hand, I'd be interested to see something toadally different from Kishimoto."
Naruto,3bvjcn,snarkhunter,8,Thu Jul 2 15:51:44 2015 UTC,"To be honest, even the anime studio could decide to pull off a ""Dragon ball GT"" and to launch ""Boruto"" as an original series. It wouldn't be that weird."
Naruto,3bvjcn,Yoshiji,3,Fri Jul 3 00:19:57 2015 UTC,"They could just bounce ideas off of Kishi, give him an executive producer title"
Naruto,3bvjcn,natehopz,3,Fri Jul 3 01:11:18 2015 UTC,"Yeah, he planned to not draw anything related to Naruto anymore, but that's all.  Knowing how famous and appreciated Naruto is over the world, the critics on the games and the potential of Naruto's/Boruto's world, I don't see how they wouldn't consider expanding Boruto to a full series and a new line of games/movies."
Naruto,3bvjcn,Yoshiji,12,Fri Jul 3 01:25:41 2015 UTC,"I don't think he is going to retire, I remember reading somewhere that he really wanted to draw his story for Mario the gangster guy. But hey, it's possible especially given the success of Naruto."
Naruto,3bvjcn,ImAnAppleBiteMe,1 point,Thu Jul 2 15:10:54 2015 UTC,Doesn't Mario kind of look like Naruto?
Naruto,3bvjcn,parduscat,5,Thu Jul 2 21:22:27 2015 UTC,He will come back like maybe 10 years later to start another series cause he misses it.
Naruto,3bvjcn,Doxtator007,7,Thu Jul 2 18:15:46 2015 UTC,18 years to maintain the expectative
Naruto,3bvjcn,Zurce,1 point,Thu Jul 2 21:20:38 2015 UTC,Lol yea Toriyama
Naruto,3bvjcn,Doxtator007,3,Thu Jul 2 22:36:36 2015 UTC,"Its probably about Naruto itself being over which sucks because the way Naruto is set up is for it to continue for a very long time even after Boruto the movie, but all good things must come to an end, maybe he will continue it after a couple years"
Naruto,3bvjcn,KingZeonidas,3,Thu Jul 2 18:06:56 2015 UTC,"Not that he's retiring for good, because he said he was going to work on another manga. What this means is he's done with Naruto after this. We have the New Era project which started with The Last, went on with Gaiden focusing on Sarada, and concluded with Boruto. After this, he's done. I'm sure the Anime studio will continue like DBZ did and we'll have Naruto GT but it won't be anything on Gaiden. As far as canon is concerned, it ends here."
Naruto,3bvjcn,MaimedPhoenix,5,Thu Jul 2 22:01:30 2015 UTC,B-but I want a continuation where Sarada is the main protagonist!
Naruto,3bvjcn,GalactusAteMyPlanet,7,Thu Jul 2 18:23:40 2015 UTC,Just read the Gaiden. It's like an episode of Maury. LOL
Naruto,3bvjcn,UchiGames,2,Thu Jul 2 19:44:54 2015 UTC,It even comes with the annoying fat black girl.
Naruto,3bvjcn,Zlinnt,2,Fri Jul 3 10:46:01 2015 UTC,Imgoingtohell
Naruto,3bvjcn,Zlinnt,0,Fri Jul 3 10:46:16 2015 UTC,LOL she was funny tho. I enjoyed her character. I'm sure she'll mature very nicely. She's got great genes and parents. Choji likes them dark kunoichi XD LOL
Naruto,3bvjcn,UchiGames,2,Fri Jul 3 15:36:12 2015 UTC,"So, is he giving up manga completely?   Granted, I'm happy he has the  financial stability to do so, unlike so many manga writers, but still...  Good for him."
Naruto,3bvjcn,Rosebunse,2,Fri Jul 3 00:29:19 2015 UTC,"I think he means that he is done with the naruto franchise, but i believe he has announced in the past he wants to start another series completely unrelated."
Naruto,3bvjcn,elxx714,1 point,Fri Jul 3 00:40:28 2015 UTC,"Yeah, sounds more like he is referring to the Naruto series and not his mangaka career. I'm looking forward to what he may draw. Maybe a Mario serialization, or maybe even a baseball manga? He did release a baseball one-shot a couple of years ago. :-)   And I think it's very possible, that some years down the road he may still draw something Naruto-related. I wish him good luck on his new journey."
Naruto,3bvjcn,UltimateAnimeHero,1 point,Thu Jul 2 15:32:55 2015 UTC,I don't blame him. If he does do another series I hope its monthly so he can take breaks lol
Naruto,3bvjcn,ruthmi88,1 point,Thu Jul 2 16:00:32 2015 UTC,Do you think he will still be taking part in the Hiden series'?
Naruto,3bvjcn,DommoUk,1 point,Thu Jul 2 18:21:23 2015 UTC,He may have notes or something.
Naruto,3bvjcn,Rosebunse,1 point,Fri Jul 3 00:32:12 2015 UTC,"He'll probably just step away from the Naruto series, and maybe eventually come back to it. I doubt he'll retire for good."
Naruto,3bvjcn,Freeleaf,1 point,Thu Jul 2 21:08:03 2015 UTC,"He's only 40 years old, I doubt he's going to want to retire. Probably take a break and then move on to something else."
Naruto,3bvjcn,Seltonik,2,Fri Jul 3 00:16:06 2015 UTC,"To be fair, the man has kept a ridiculously consistent schedule over the past 15 years. Naruto never really went on breaks like Bleach and One Piece did.   Plus, with the movies, and fan appearances, and just life in general, that's a pretty ridiculous schedule. Can't blame him if he wants to be done."
Naruto,3bvjcn,Rosebunse,1 point,Fri Jul 3 00:31:36 2015 UTC,BRUUUUUH. I don't know what to do with myself without Naruto in my life.
Naruto,3bvjcn,SMlLE,1 point,Fri Jul 3 13:43:58 2015 UTC,I honestly could give a fuck if Kishimoto keeps writing as long as he passes of the rights to another/many other authors. Naruto's world is too well built to see the end now. There are so many stories left to tell!!
Naruto,3bvjcn,swarbles,1 point,Thu Jul 2 19:38:40 2015 UTC,I wish he let other people continue his work. I want to know what happened during Sakura and Karin's travels.
Naruto,3bz0ur,gritodedolores1946,1 point,Fri Jul 3 08:31:41 2015 UTC,Jax has already said that wasn't going to happen.
Naruto,3bz0ur,Lord4th,1 point,Fri Jul 3 16:25:47 2015 UTC,Ok thanks
