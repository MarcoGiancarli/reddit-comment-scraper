artstore,3e6701,omutant,1 point,Wed Jul 22 07:01:32 2015 UTC,"so lemme see if im understanding this right, you want a piece (sketch/ full painting) with the singer as an infant merman on the beach, singing to an audience of angels/ archangels? yeah, i could do that :) PM me if you want and we can discuss details, and pricing and such :3"
artstore,3e4k8h,icepigs,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:18:43 2015 UTC,"What size were you thinking? what's your budget? Do you have preferences as to what medium is used (oil, watercolor, etc.)? When would you need it done by?"
artstore,3e4k8h,dweebie,1 point,Wed Jul 22 02:27:06 2015 UTC,"I would like to for it to fit in a 11x17 or maybe even a 16x20 frame.    Don't have a lot of money to get it done, but to be honest, I'm not sure what my budget is.  (I know that's a very unhelpful answer, but the budget is negotiable.)    The medium can be pretty much anything, I think...   I would like the artist to give me some ideas, then I can look at similar mediums to see if I like it or not."

artstore,3dv1t2,cjerman,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:21:39 2015 UTC,"I've been creating collectible toys and figures for a few years now that are shown and sold at conventions and online. It's been tons of fun, but I miss working directly with customers to create something special.  Im drawn to woodsy scenes and animals, but am not limited whatsoever by those things. I have an Illustration degree and work traditionally, digitally, and with a variety of clays and paints (as well as moldmaking/casting to duplicate these figures if needed). These works will last a life time and are an amazing way to give a one-of-a-kind something, whether they be produced as standing pieces, magnets, custom frames, keychains, ornaments, whatever..!  Check out my Instagram to see illustrations and some sculpts  Or find more sculpting work, here  Message me now with your project idea and lets talk!"

artstore,3drnqo,trycatchfinally,2,Sun Jul 19 03:00:52 2015 UTC,"Thanks! I've faved your etsy story. I like how the background of this one has a bit of a de Chirico feel with the smooth flatness, and the gradient in the dress is so lovely. Your other works are such an interesting throw-back to earlier 20th century illustration styles, I can't really place them, but I just love the feel of it all!"
artstore,3drnqo,AGamerDraws,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:04:55 2015 UTC,"Thank you that's very kind! For this painting I was inspired by Edward Hopper's Nighthawks painting. I've always loved 20th century art as well, so that's part of my inspiration for my other works. It's great to hear you love the feel of it all!"

artstore,3do48g,Adaptingfate,2,Fri Jul 17 21:21:23 2015 UTC,"What price range were you considering? I charge $4 per square inch.  I am classically trained. I take a 20% deposit to start, and provide a lifetime guarantee on revarnishing as well as minor repairs. I also include an animated .gif of the process as a gift.  If that is reasonable to you, I will send my portfolio once I am home and in front of a computer rather than my phone."

artstore,3dgyin,cajolerisms,1 point,Thu Jul 16 12:49:40 2015 UTC,"I think you have to try to get yourself out of the mindset as the person who made these drawings, and pretend you're a potential customer. Are these prints something someone would want to buy? Would they spend $20+ on one and hang it up in their house? If you came across a similar piece, would you buy it?  If your goal is to sell on Society6, look at what the top sellers are in your chosen categories and evaluate what about those pieces are attractive to a buyer."

artstore,3dc4ec,OnePieceJPG,6,Wed Jul 15 02:56:05 2015 UTC,"This is my specialty. I paint pet memorial portraits in oil..   I also do them in digital paintings, colored pencils and also graphite/charcoal.   The question is, what time frame were you looking at?  What medium?   What size?  I charge by the square inch for traditional mediums, higher for oil, lower for pencil. Digital is a set price but depends on how complicated you want the image. Basic portraits I keep at $50. Background increases the price but depends again on how complicated.   I am a county girl and have always had dogs in my life. I can only imagine how much that tore him up. I'm so sorry.   This is a very thoughtful gift. I hope he loves it, regardless of who you use to do the work."
artstore,3dc4ec,Cerulean_Shades,3,Wed Jul 15 03:22:27 2015 UTC,"Oh man, I always love seeing that cat portrait u/Cerulean_Shades linked! She is a great artist.  Here is my website with my pet portraits if you'd like to take a look: Link  I think I could work with the photos you already have, and the 3rd one reminds me of my source for my most recent painting, Chester, so though it's a bit blurry I think I could pull out the details.  For a similar 11x14 I charge about $350 with some wiggle room depending on background/details, etc.  I work in oil on wood and it would take about a month.  I can't offer any other mediums that might be a little more cost effective like digital or watercolor, unfortunately.  Best of luck with your search and as already noted this is a very thoughtful gift.  Happy to answer any questions!"
artstore,3dc4ec,nikuryori,2,Wed Jul 15 16:56:36 2015 UTC,I always love seeing your stuff. You have a gorgeous way with light. Plus you know I love blues! And you use them perfectly.   I would not have hurt feelings if I lost to you :)
artstore,3dc4ec,Cerulean_Shades,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:02:28 2015 UTC,"<3 Oil portraits are such a tough sell on here because the budget is usually pretty tight.  I hate asking for prices that seem high to a low-income person like myself, but at a certain point I can't dedicate 20-30 hours to something and sell for $100 anymore :'(    That digital husky portrait is really fabulous!  I see you estimated about 5 hours of work.. that's like a whole different world.  Having a few medium options seems like a good idea, but I just don't enjoy digital/watercolor as much as oil.. probably because I have that ""I-have-no-idea-what-I'm-doing"" feeling the whole time ;D"
