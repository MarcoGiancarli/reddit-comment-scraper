I use linux, so its one of the /dev/sg# placed on the SCSI tab instead of the /dev/sdX disk - this also works but appears as a fixed disk to the Mac...  Iomega tools will actually see it as a SCSI zip drive and format it with drivers if you go the former route. The latter it refuses to recognise it as a zip.  Funny thing, too, is iomega tools will refuse to install unless it sees a zip drive on the system- but this worked amazingly  I like using Bailisk to manipulate my Mac disks since its true macos doing any write operations, its a better guarantee of no screwups in my mind..."

Many games expect 48K ram and would just crash because of one bit missing in 32k-48K memory area.

The Language card served two purposes. To provide an Autostart ROM F8 to earlier Apple systems that did not have the F8 boot ROM installed, allowing an Apple II to boot from a Disk Drive; and to provide an extra 16k of RAM to a fully expanded 48k Apple to bring the total memory available to 64k. As the Apple II evolved, the F8 ROM was eventually shipped as standard with the computer, and so the Language Card was soon no longer required.

Beige G3 Desktop - working last time I checked. 450mhz g3 zif, 750mb ram, zip, floppy, CD. I think it dual-boots OS9 and 10.4 but I really don't remember. I played with this quite a bit when I was more into the retro Mac scene. The speaker grill had a hole smashed in it when I got it, so I started to cut it out with a dremel to replace it with something a little cleaner-looking.  7600/132 - missing HDD. has CD and floppy. functional status unknown. Supports up to 1GB of RAM. 520c - booted last time I tested it. no battery, no charger, has a line of dead pixels. base level RAM. latch doesn't work. missing rear port door. probably best for parts. 6116CD - fully functional, good condition. Sometimes you have to power it on, it'll fail to boot, and then if you power it on immediately after, it boots fine. I'm assuming the mobo battery is dead. Functions fine other than that and has all its parts. ADB keyboard - really dirty, never had a chance to clean it after I received it from previous owner. good condition though. White G4-era USB keyboard. Cable shorts near connection to keyboard. Could be shortened and re-soldered.   They're all a bit discolored after being in storage for about 8 years in a non-smoking house. They could probably benefit from a shot of retrobrite.

You can have a LOT of harddrives or partitions each with different versions of OS X. From that boot screen though, you can't select OS 9 if OS X is present on the drive, but if you go to system preferences in OS X and choose start volume, you can select between OS 9 and OS X on any drive in your computer.   The start volume preference (also available in OS 9) will read any classic or OS X boot folder and allow you to boot from it, without any problems."

If I'm to bother with the old stuff, I'd rather have the old software available without emulation.   You know though, that the Classic environment is emulation. It's emulating an OS 9.2 system to run the old apps, and much like other emulators, it's not perfect.  On my G5 (which dual-boots 10.4.11 and 10.5.8), it's a total crapshoot whether classic apps will run better in the Classic environment on 10.4 or in SheepShaver on 10.5. Some apps will have glitches in one environment, but not the other, or refuse to run at all in one of them.  I tend to boot 10.5 more often because it feels much more modern to me than 10.4 (probably because 2 out of my 3 Intel Macs still run 10.6, which acts just like 10.5). QuickLook alone almost makes it worth it...I don't know how we ever lived without that before.  EDIT: As for browsers, TenFourFox is the definite winner for me. All of the browsers from the old age are pretty much broken now with the current web, and Leopard WebKit looks and feels exactly like the highest possible version of Safari I could run, making it pointless. (If anyone has any other browser recommendations for 10.4/10.5, I'm all ears, because I'm not terribly happy with anything I've found so far. Being an avid Chrome user, everything for the older systems leaves much to be desired.)"

Part of it was that the G3 was a CPU that actually did kick Intel ass for a while in the late 90s, whereas the G4 came limping out of the gate and basically stumbled along for a few years until the G5 put it out of its misery.  Also, somewhere out there, I dream that there is an early G3 prototype in the original Studio Display colors: http://core0.staticworld.net/images/article/2014/12/25_apple-studio-display-15-with-stand-100536088-medium.jpg"

VintageApple,3bmaxj,Kichigai,5,Tue Jun 30 15:25:06 2015 UTC,"It's a great idea, but you've got some problems here with your campaign.  First, let's talk about the video. Thirteen seconds doesn't tell me much. The video you put on Kickstarter is often seen as being your big moment to make your pitch. But you didn't do that here. Instead what I got out of this was that you have a functioning prototype, but it makes noises I'd probably want to turn off and it's incredible thick.  It doesn't tell me anything else about the product. What you need to do is actually show up on camera and give us a proper demonstration. This is where you have your opportunity to recognize problems with the prototype and explain how you're going to address them. For example, ""this prototype is extremely thick but the final model will be only one third the size"" or something like that. We also need to know about you. Give us a sense of your personality, why is this project important to you? Put some passion into this project, because let me tell you: passion is what's going to push someone to put money into this thing.  You need to tell us where this is going to go. How is it going to be used in every day life?   A complete 1980's era microcomputer for your wrist! It features a virtualized 6502 clocked at a blistering 1 Megahertz and a whopping 32K of memory!    For the record the original Apple ][ came out in 1977, so this is a 1970s era microcomputer. Also describing your 6502 is ""virtualized"" is a bit inaccurate as you're actually performing hardware emulation. You correctly refer to it as emulated everywhere else, so minimally I'd suggest changing that up for the sake of consistency.   It is software compatible with the original Apple® ][ and includes a custom hardware accelerated BASIC interpreter.   In what way is this hardware accelerated? You should probably explain that, because I'm not aware of any ARM SoCs that have BASIC acceleration modules.   Full Day Battery Life (Or Multiday With Power Save Enabled)   Somewhere in your pitch you should explain how Power Save works (does it just turn off the screen? Does it put the whole watch into sleep mode? Do I have to press a button to wake it? Etc) and what the realistic gains are (multiday could mean two days or it could mean twelve). These are all things people look at when shopping for a smartwatch.   1.8"" High Resolution Color LCD   That is pretty big for a watch. This display is compared against a US quarter. Here is a US quarter compared to my Pebble. The size of the watch itself alone might be a dealbreaker for some people.  I know it's going to be more of a ""statement"" watch than a functional thing, but you're going to have to show that thing on someone's wrist to prove it's wearable. This is something you can demonstrate in your video.   Ultra Low Power ARM Cortex CPU   Now the question is going to come: why aren't you just using a 6502 or some variant? This would eliminate the need for an emulator and would dramatically increase battery life, plus add to the authenticity of the watch. The Tamagatchi uses a 6502 so it isn't impossible to source. Now I'm sure you've got a reason(s) for choosing ARM, but you should probably mention it is my point.   User Interaction   You're going to want to really expand this area. So far all you've talked about is an OSK, but there's so much more to interaction than just that. You're going to have to talk a bit more about CinnamonBASIC and your Apple ][ emulator. Will people be able to turn off the buzzer? Is there a menu system people can use to ""swap disks""? Is USB OnTheGo an option? Can they load CinnamonBASIC software without having to use the OSK?  You should probably also explain the platform a bit more. So far what we have seen is CinnamonBASIC, which you describe as ""a custom interpreter written in C that runs as a native mode application on the watch."" Is CinnamonBASIC the way we are expected to primarily interact with the watch (e.g. do we launch the emulator from here)? What's under CinnamonBASIC. Can I write my own code outside of CinnamonBASIC or is it actually the OS for the whole thing? What separates it from simply running an Apple   You should probably expound a bit on interactivity with the Apple ][ emulator. Will there be ways to ""remap"" keys to the native hardware (e.g. map gestures to match the arrow keys)? Can one easily jump into and out of it? Things like that.    Now, don't take this as a dig against the project itself, but rather my critique on some information you might want to add to your Kickstarter campaign. You talk a lot about the hardware, but not much about the software or the actual experience of using the watch, and in the end those are the things people are going to be interacting with primarily.  For example, look at this campaign. They touch on what it's like to use the device and what it's like to develop for the device. Now, you may be early into your project and still have some things that are up in the air, but you should have an idea about what you want the end result to be and that is what you should talk about."

I have never seen another powermac labeled ""6500/225"", so I guess this is a REALLY obscure configuration for a tower (6500 is the model and 225 is the MHz I believe). It did come from an elementry school, so I think maybe it was only available to education or no one else could afford it (it's got the same amount of megahertz as a first gen iMac I think, although it's a different processor)."

So Performa 6400 = PowerMac 6400, LC 475 = Performa 475, etc. The internals are exactly the same, but Apple gave them different names depending on their intended buyers.  So coming from a school, a PowerMac 6400 perfectly fits the bill. But coming from an old lady neighbor's attic, it would more likely be a Performa 6400, yet be the exact same model. Though none of this applies to your computer, since the 6500 was only ever released under the PowerMac brand. Apple dropped the entire Performa line after the 6400."

The client didn't seem to know very much about it and asked me some basic questions. I booted it for her and showed her a few basic things to answer her questions. Simple stuff.

VintageApple,3apc89,Woolio,2,Mon Jun 22 16:39:26 2015 UTC,"Thanks - this is the method I ended up using.

VintageApple,3apc89,Woolio,2,Wed Jun 24 07:25:06 2015 UTC,"No problem. I've had this problem a couple times with my Cube over the years. Discs just get jammed for some reason, and you can't do anything in the OS to remove them."
VintageApple,3apc89,spacebulb,1 point,Wed Jun 24 12:19:19 2015 UTC,"Do you hear the ejector/injector mechanism operating when you attempt to eject? If so, it could be that the disc is being blocked from either a slightly warped casing, or some other obstacle. In this case, gently reaching into the drive with some long needle nose pliers and again, GENTLY grabbing the disc while hitting eject should do the trick.  If you do not hear the ejector working, the drive will need to be replaced. You will probably need to disassemble the drive to recover the CD."
VintageApple,3apc89,dvdkon,3,Mon Jun 22 12:25:53 2015 UTC,I'd recommend not forcefully grabbing the disk. Our family iMac once ejected a disk with bits of the drive.

I ran first aid to verify and repair disk (I forgot to make a note of the error that came up when verifying). I went back to the install screen and re-installed OS X with an erase and install.

Somewhere in there (I never found it) is a pair of Tandy 1000s and a Commodore 64 as well. I'd definitely ask around and see if your relatives / friends have some old kit laying around, especially old people that never get rid of anything.  Ham radio conventions are also a bit hit-or-miss for computers but you sometimes stumble upon a good find. Sometimes schools dig old clunkers out of storage and try offloading them as well, I snagged a monitor for my Powermac from a community college that had dug it out of storage."

I'm 35 now, and the first computer I got was in 1993 and it was actually an LC II, which was actually a Performa-something (I can't remember which one). It had System 7.0. I remember that I would call BBS's a lot, and I downloaded a PC emulator which was very slowly able to emulate DOS and DosShell. I wished I could do Windows, but my computer wasn't fast enough. It was 16 MHZ.  I loved it and all, but I really wanted a PC. I sold the Performa and bought a 386 DX 25 MHZ with 1 meg of RAM, a 120 MB hard drive, and a 2400 baud modem. I really favored the PC, though. I loved messing around in DOS.   I had the 386 for a few years, and it was the computer that really let me do awesome things at the time - for what is was, at least (spec wise).  Man, do I miss the old days. But I have to love the fast computers and tech we have nowadays. Especially this sick laptop that I just got recently which has an I-7 4710HQ processor, an NVIDIA GTX 860M (with 2 gigs of dedicated RAM), 12 gigs of system RAM, a 7200 RPM 1 TB hard drive (I want to go SSD eventually), lighted keyboard - the whole nine. It's so fast, I can't believe it. To me, it's like the culmination of all the technology I've owned throughout the years. I've just never had much money growing up; even until now.

Back in the late 70's, computers were something kids ordered out of Popular Mechanics and built like they were ham radios or what-have-you. Apple I's were sold as kits, circuit board, parts, and assembly instructions. They required a keyboard, power supply, storage and display. I believe that what we are looking at is a case modded for an Apple I board that would have sat entirely under the lower plate where the keyboard is embedded - either that or you've got the world's first example of some hipster Apple fan modding his PC to look like a Mac. :D  Fewer than 50 Apple I's are known to exist today.

Put a dab of the cleaner fluid (alcohol) on the white pad and then try to run some regular operations  with the drive. A Q-tip with alcohol on it will work, if you can reach it without damaging it.  I've noticed older disks have a residue on them, and it gets on the drive read/write heads.  Also, floppy disks do go bad over time. You'll want to keep backups.

The Classic uses the ADB connector for peripherals, which all Apple computers used from the mid 80's on to the end of the 90's, when they switched to USB. The connector is the same as the one used by S-Video.  It should not be too hard to find an old ADB keyboard/mouse - the bulk of 'beige' Apple peripherals will use that standard, with the exception of very early ones.  As for the buttons on the side, those sound like programming buttons?

It was introduced on the Apple IIGS in 1986 as a way to support low-cost devices like keyboards and mice, allowing them to be connected together in a daisy chain without the need for hubs or other devices. ADB was quickly introduced on later Macintosh models, and also found use on computers from NeXT, and saw some other 3rd party use as well. ADB was rapidly replaced by USB as that system became popular in the late 1990s; the last external ADB port on an Apple product was in 1999, though it remained as an internal-only bus on some Mac models into the 2000s.

For the IDE drive, a beige G3 would also be perfect since it's got two IDE busses. Or a USB/FireWire enclosure could be used with a newer machine.  Once you've got that image you can back it up, copy it to a modern machine, and keep it safe without worrying about the old hard drives going bad.  Depending what system version is on the disks, you might be able to boot them in BasiliskII. And even if you can't boot off them directly, you could always install a supported system inside Basilisk or SheepShaver and just run the apps from those.  I assume you don't have a stash of old Macs sitting around, what's your location? Maybe someone can help."

I can't stand some of the stuff they did when they were still using plastic for their stuff (most of their past laptops...), but the stuff that they've done with aluminum makes me drool.

Like running Linux as the main OS on MacBooks (at least keeping OS X for firmware upgrades), or modding the living hell out of older Apple PCs.   That being said, after a certain point in Apple's history, I REALLY came to hate who they were and what they stood for as a company. I like Steve Wozniak, but I can't stand Steve Jobs, even in death.  Back to the design aspect of things..... After certain points, they really needed to go in a different direction than what they did. Like the new MacBooks for example. It's the thinnest PC they've released to date. Wooo.... twirls finger Or the new Mac Pro. It's a garbage can. The semi-convection-based heating is a wonderful idea, and the way that they designed the innards is marvelous, but the computer looks like shit over all...

VintageApple,386tit,hanz333,2,Tue Jun 2 19:22:36 2015 UTC,"From wiki: ""Early blue and white G3s (""Revision 1"" units) had IDE controller problems related to the ATA/33 hard drive controller that made it impossible to connect two hard drives and prevented the use of newer drives. Using newer ATA drives in those units resulted in data transmission errors if the drives were connected to the on-board ATA/33 controller, the severity of the problem varying according to the particular make and model of the drive. Workarounds include replacing motherboards and employing the use of SCSI, Ultra ATA or SATA PCI controller cards. Stable operation can be achieved if the drive can be limited to Multi-Word DMA Mode 2 (disabling UDMA), although this limits throughput to 16 MB/sec. Some hard drives support disabling UDMA in firmware through manufacturer-supplied utilities (generally DOS-based). Alternatively, the transfer mode can be limited to Multi-Word DMA Mode 2 through the use of third-party driver software such as FWB Hard Disk Toolkit.  The secondary ATA channel has also been reported to have issues with respect to flash upgrading certain DVD burners. Otherwise, it is generally held to be relatively stable.  Mac OS X attempts to avoid the UDMA issue by disabling UDMA on all affected G3 motherboards, but xlr8yourmac.com reported that reader Tim Seufert still found issues with single drives under Mac OS X. He reported that as of January 23, 2002, the fix would not be activated under Mac OS X when no slave drive was present."""

VintageApple,36syob,LlaughingLlama,3,Thu May 21 23:24:34 2015 UTC,"TL;DR:  The computer was rescued from an old shed during a cleanout, was allowed to take it home as a thank you for helping there all day.  There was lots of awesome computer and video game stuff in the shed, but only a fraction of it worked, including the Apple II C.  For those who don't know:  A few years back, I visited an elderly couple and assisted them by cleaning out their old storage shed.  Inside, there was a whole treasure trove of old computers ranging from Tandy, Commadore, and the Apple II C. There were also a few retro systems such as the NES and first gen SEGA genesis that were also there, but nothing that really stood out as ""rare"".  As a thank you, the couple said I could keep something from the lot and the rest was going to a yard sale.  I kept the Apple II C and a practically untouched Commadore TV monitor as well as some old Macintosh/Apple II books.  The rest was sold, and it sold very quickly (especially the commodore stuff, even though it wouldn't power on).  It was an amazing experience for both the couple who got quite a bit out of the sale, and of course from what they allowed me to take home.   This computer is now being used to learn BASIC as well as learning the ins and outs of computer parts.  Safe to say, the computer is in good hands :)"

In other words, once the computer was ""refreshed"", access to the key was blocked.  So here we are in 2015.  One computer is from the 80s and still works with some minor repair jobs, and yet the other is now a $900 paperweight due to some DRM nonsense.

Snow Leopard was the last version to support Rosetta, the PowerPC compatibility layer.  I think much of the slowness on Lion may be due to a slow hard drive.  Lion brought a lot of new features and visual changes. However, it also introduced skeuomorphic designs (the calendar looks like an actual calendar and the address book looks like an actual book) which were widely panned.

VintageApple,35bid0,ph1l_91,4,Fri May 8 18:54:34 2015 UTC,"PRAM batteries are pretty cheap on Amazon.  There was an option for slot loading DVD drives. Find one, and you could switch it out. Video files are pretty much hopeless on these now. They're good DVD players if you can get a DVD drive in, but don't count on much for video files of any sort.  If Diablo asked for Classic, that means it was written to run on an older Mac OS (think 8 or 9). You should be able to run it in Classic mode if you installed that with 10.3.9 (I'm kinda fuzzy on details, maybe someone else can chime in here. I'm not sure if you had to have classic installed first or if it came with OSX).  If your wifi USB sticks are compatible with 10.3.9, I don't see a reason it wouldn't work. The USB is 1.1 though, so don't expect blazing speeds at all.  I have loads of extra speakers for iMac G3s... if you'll cover shipping, I'll send you a few. (Edit: I see the prices you mentioned above in Euros. I'm in America, so shipping might be prohibitive. Though the offer still stands if you can't source anything from that side of the pond). The tough part is getting into and out of the case without damaging it. Since the G3s didn't have an internal fan, they ran pretty hot. That, combined with time, leaves much of the internal plastic brittle and very difficult to work on without snapping pieces. Might be a better idea to get external speakers instead of risking replacement if your unit's in good shape now.  If you do open it up to do any work, be careful with the CRT. Google around to find out why if you're not familiar."
VintageApple,35bid0,Quethandtheheatsinks,1 point,Fri May 8 20:00:49 2015 UTC,"Thanks for taking the time!  I asked about the batterys and which one to get because I've heard that bad ones can potentially screw up your hardware. Is this a thing, or is the worst case szenario with a bad battery that it just won't last very long?  Why are video files hopeless? There must have been video files back in the day, so why should it now be impossible to play any of them? (Maybe because the video formats changed?)  I will definitly watch out for broken iMacs that i can salvage parts from (drive, speakers), but does the drive have to be an original one from an identical machine, or is it possible to just get any slot-loading drive as long as it is an IDE-one? (Maybe from an old laptop?)  Your offer to send me some of these speakers is very kind, but considering the distance (I live in Austria) I will search for other sources first, but will happily keep it in mind.  And thanks for the warnings considering working on the machine, but I've already opened the case several times when replacing the HDD. You may ask why I had to open it up several times - because I have never installed an Mac OS bevore and thought the HDD wasn't working because it didn't show up right away in the setup program. So I ended up doing the whole thing 3 times. Some plastic clips in the front snapped when I opened it up, but I was told that this would be hard to avoid and won't be visible afterwards."

VintageApple,3590l0,MeatPiston,2,Fri May 8 03:50:34 2015 UTC,"The only drives that can read/write 800k Mac floppies are ""built in to a beige Mac"" drives, and similar-vintage Atari ST and Amiga computers. No USB floppy drives will do it."

VintageApple,3590l0,MeatPiston,1 point,Fri May 8 18:08:30 2015 UTC,"Its not that USB floppies can only read 1.4 MB disks - nor standard ""PC"" floppy drives.  It's that Apple's low-density disks use a completely different method of storing data, packing it in tighter. That's why Mac disks are 800 kb while PC disks are 720 kb.  A USB floppy drive can read a PC 720 kb disk fine. But not a Mac 800 kb disk."
VintageApple,3590l0,vadermeer,1 point,Fri May 8 18:59:50 2015 UTC,"Standard PC drives should be able to access 800k mac floppies with the right software (TransMac for example http://www.acutesystems.com/scrtm.htm) but it requires low-level direct access to the drive. (Possible on modern PC OS's but requires admin privs in later versions of windows)  Found a good tutorial on dealing with legacy mac floppies on mac and PC here - http://www.hardwaresecrets.com/printpage/How-to-Generate-Floppy-Disks-for-Old-Macintosh-Computers/1713  Looks like if you have access to a PC with a standard floppy drive you should be able to create 400 and 800k floppies with standard 1.44meg HD media.  ""Standard"" pc drives have not changed since they were introduced and indeed use very old, very low level mechanisms. USB floppies don't use the same low level mechanisms since they're abstracted through the USB bus and the OS's USB stack.  USB floppy drives are a unique bit of hardware. From what I understand they use something called ""UFI"" - A part of the USB mass storage spec that's specifically designed to accommodate floppies and their peculiarities as legacy devices.   You can read the spec here: http://www.usb.org/developers/docs/devclass_docs/usbmass-ufi10.pdf  I don't know if UFI devices can grant the kind of low level access needed to do things like read LD mac floppies, or if it's a deficiency of modern usb stacks (Reading legacy 400/800k mac floppies in a modern OSX machine is an edge case that nobody would probably care to test for)  USB floppy drives were a bit of a transitional tech created to help people access their disks on new computers (Particularly Macs, which abandoned floppies after the beige era) - Now they're just obscure and who knows how well they're supported on modern systems.  If you're serious about getting data on/off old disks there are various hardware projects like this:  http://www.kryoflux.com/  They're special drive controllers designed to help you get data on and off of old disks. This particular project looks mostly aimed at Amiga and Apple II and some other obscure 3.5"" formats (looks like using a standard pc drive, which is handy) but I've seen other projects that can interface with all sorts of old drive hardware.  Edit:   Yeah, reading more about the old 400k/800k disks reveal that they use a CLV scheme. Not surprised that USB floppy drives can't read that. PCs with old standard drives can probably pull it off with some clever hardware twiddling but it looks like UFI USB floppy devices only provide block level access to 1.44 meg HD floppies, and nothing else."

In order to backup the existing data, you have only two options :   Boot off an external SCSI drive with enough free space to copy up to 160MB out of the internal drive Extract the HDD and connect it to any machine with an SCSI-1 (not LVDS) port running either Mac OS, Mac OS X or Linux (windows may do the job with aditionnal software)   To clean install this machine, after a thorough hard disk test (zeroize it and test every sector once backed up), you will have to boot the machine with anything from 7.5 to 7.6.1 and have the installation files available through either the internal HDD, an external SCSI drive or a CD.  I'd strongly advise against wasting time with the CD drive : it would really be a miracle if it can still read modern CD-Rs. edit : plus it will take ages to setup and won't help with the backup part.  Little hint though : when I worked at an Apple premium resseller's repair booth, I always kept images of bootable drives with blessed system folders on a Linux machine, ready to DD it to a ZIP, syquest or external HDD. Such bootable media can contain installation files for multiple OS version, diagnostic and data recovery tools, and for some macs, a working network stack to push backups over Ethernet.  Today I'd probably go with a SCSI emulator and multiple drive images on a flash card instead of multiple drives kept over the years. You never know when a customer will come over with such a rare piece, and still beeing able to help them on 20+ year old systems is a big plus to gain their trust."

That have yellow shit all over it? Yeah, thats 20 year old lithium grease. Go ahead and get it all off and put on some new stuff. At this point, you should be able to put in a blank floppy disk (not a good one) and it can inject/disinject with a nice click. However, you must grease one more part. The worm drive. Look it up on google, because none of the youtube video show this part. It's a mechanism deep inside the drive, really hard to see. But that again is covered with yellow shit. It's a huge pain, but you're going to have to clean all that off. it took a ton of q-tips for me, but I got the majority off and put some new grease on. reassemble turn on..but don't be surprised if it gets stuck. it might take a few tries for the grease to spread, like mine.  if still stuck, disassemble and try to grease the worm drive again. this part is the trickiest but it's what matters the most.    let me know if you more questions. once you're done, you'll realize how simple it is."

For System 7.x, the largest single partition is 2gb but you can have multiple partitions on one disk.  7.5.3 is probably going to be a bit slow on that machine, especially if it doesn't have much RAM.  It'll run though, and you can trim it down.  7.1 (or 7.01) will be a good bit speedier, but they're a lot thinner on the added-in goodies.

While I could stumble through it if I absolutely had to from decades old familiarity, I wish I had the ability to cruise through the Classic OS's as much as I do 10.x."
VintageApple,3225pz,izlib,2,Fri Apr 10 19:13:53 2015 UTC,"As someone who is probably a few years older, and was an 'expert' on OS 8/9 before moving on to OS X, I would observe that Classic MacOS was a LOT simpler than OS X. Many of its technical problems stemmed from this (it was basically the same OS that the original Mac team built in 1983, with more bits cobbled on), but nevertheless it made troubleshooting very straighforward. Usually it boiled down to resolving extension and control panel conflicts, which was done by dragging and dropping files in and out of the relevant folders, and rebooting. No config file, no terminal, no UNIX tools... from a users point of view OS X is a MUCH deeper system. Becoming an expert in Classic MacOS troubleshooting boils down to knowing some startup key combinations to reset nonvolatile memory, and knowing some techniques for extension conflict resolution. Beyond that, throw up your hands and reinstall the OS."
VintageApple,3225pz,sprashoo,2,Sat Apr 11 17:03:50 2015 UTC,"Those were the days. The OS was drag-and-drop installable and you could boot with two files (later, four). Getting a lot of 3rd party software and drivers to work together on the same machine could be fun. Extension sets and load orders and heap sizes... etc.   My ""favorite"" thing about the Classic Mac OS was the memory management (or lack thereof). Most ""power users"" of sorts had launch orders for their applications that would try to minimize fragmentation. It was always annoying when you had to quit a bunch of applications to clear memory fragmentation. You couldn't allocate memory non-contiguously so if you started with 16 MB of free memory, launched a program that used 4 MB, launched a program that used 2 MB, then quit the first program, your largest available block was still only 10 MB until that 2 MB program in the ""middle"" of the memory was quit. You certainly did not want to load a large or crash-happy program like your web browser ahead of something you were going to keep open like your IRC client, email client, or maybe Hotline or KDX. :-)  There was no protected memory so applications could take down the whole system. You could force quit an application but that was hit-or-miss and usually you needed to reboot after a force quit anyway just to be safe. But that also meant that it was easy to patch parts of the OS and hook onto calls to do weird or cool or occasionally useful things like Oscar the Grouch. There was also no pre-emptive multitasking so things like pulling down a menu (which gave control of the computer to the Macintosh Toolbox) would cause everything else on the machine to grind to a halt. Your printer would stop printing once the buffer ran out. Files would stop copying in Finder. iTunes would stop playing when the buffer ran out, etc. When you got off the menubar it would all pick up where it left off. A lot of power-user folks I knew back then had two or more Macs on their desk towards the end of the Classic era because it made multitasking easier when you just had two separate computers.  It was amazing that this OS model lasted and worked for as long as it did. But it was fun to work around the quirks and limitations and the community around the Macintosh was always fun and helpful back then (not that it isn't now, but it was just a different time).   I will always wonder what the OS would have ended up being like if Copland had never been killed and NeXTstep had never been brought in as the core of the 'new' Mac OS. Better or worse, we'll never know."

Boot to BASIC, and type the command to load a program from cassette (""LOAD"" in standard Applesoft BASIC.) Then you hit ""Play"" on the desired program on the ""playback"" device.

VintageApple,305152,ClairelyClaire,3,Tue Mar 24 15:21:48 2015 UTC,"No, no way to force it.  640 times 400 times 2 (2 bytes - 16 bits) = 512K.  The 5300c only has 512K of built-in VRAM, which is exactly enough for the lower 640x400 at 16-bit.  Not for 640x480 at 16-bit.  The 5300c does have the possibility of the external video card having its own separate 512K of VRAM.  This may add up to 1 MB, but it is really two separate 512K video cards.  The 5300ce has a full 1 MB of built-in VRAM to run its 800x600 16-bit display.  (Take a look at the PB5300 Developer Note, figure 2.1 (PDF page 26) to see the two separate VRAM architecture.)  Even if you add a higher-VRAM third party video card, that card only has the VRAM for the external display, not the internal, which is fixed at 512K from Apple.  (For the non-ce model.)"

VintageApple,2zz667,board_rocker,2,Mon Mar 23 05:01:13 2015 UTC,"Got it - so I should be able to install 8.5 the same way I tried to install 8.6, and then I can run the 8.6 installer.    Do I need to install 8.6 while booted into 8.5 or do I still need to boot off a floppy and install 8.6 separately?    Also - can I boot 8.5 off a CF card or do I need to use a boot floppy? I was getting the ""you must boot off the original media"" error with the 8.6 installer."
VintageApple,2zz667,board_rocker,1 point,Mon Mar 23 14:13:35 2015 UTC,"Right, here's my tutorial:  First things first, you must be booted into 8.5, then move into the folder that has 8.6.  The issue you're getting, aside from not being on 8.5, is that you're installing from an unsupported (as far as I've seen, and I've been tinkering with PowerBooks for almost seven years now) medium. I've never managed to install from a CF card. In your case, floppies are the best bet.  So, yes, booting into 8.5 via floppy, and then attempting an install would probably yield the best results."
VintageApple,2zz667,board_rocker,1 point,Mon Mar 23 14:22:42 2015 UTC,"Thanks!    The floppy I made is from the 8.1 Disk Tools image. Is there an 8.5 version that will fit on a floppy?    Do I need to make 8.5 installation floppies? That will take a LOT of floppies...    How did people install various OSes on the 5300c, since it doesn't have a CD-ROM? I have one of those huge SCSI drives (Apple CD 300 or something like that) but was hoping to avoid hauling it out."
VintageApple,2zz667,board_rocker,2,Mon Mar 23 14:33:42 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately, yes. You need installation floppies.  The OS came prepackaged on a set of floppies, making the ordeal not so bad. Of course, there were people who had SCSI CD drives, like you, who would just use CDs. I highly recommend digging that out."

Connected to 5300c using PCMCIA adapter. Booted off floppy. Installed 8.5. I got a few errors about missing optional packages, but the base OS installed fine.

Especially the first model where the two parts separated.  The Apple II hard drive is very interesting. I'm not sure how much it will fetch though in this era of SD card interfaces.  The 6100 with the Sonnet accelerator might get something.  The 7500 represents an interesting part of Apple's past, it was right around when they almost went out of business. There were a lot of differing models, and when Steve J. took over he switched to a very clear product plan (the grid of 4 if you remember). But I thought the 7300/7500/7600 were very nice machines. And of course the Quadra 605 was a nice consumer machine in its era.  I personally wouldn't mind picking up an Apple IIgs.  Honestly I think you could advertise a sale on Craiglist, and people could show up and purchase items. Also you could even get a booth at a retro convention (which is becoming more and more popular, I went to one in Portland and it was awesome, had thousands of people)."

It was created in 1986 by Canadian programmer Steven Halls. It is the first animated talking agent on a personal computer and featured a moose that would appear at periodic intervals with some joke or witticism. The moose would also comment on system events and user actions and could speak what a user typed using the Moose Proof desk accessory.  The moose was the first facially animated talking agent with lip synchronization and it became the seed idea for future talking agents, such as Clippy the paperclip in Microsoft Windows, and Prody Parrot from Creative Soundblaster.  The Talking Moose used Apple's Macintalk software, the first version of which famously made the original ""Never trust a computer you can't lift"" speech at the Macintosh launch in 1984. Apple's development of Macintalk had petered out and they granted Halls permission to use, and continue refining, the software for free. Halls did not just improve the fluidity of the speech and the reliability of the interpretation but gave the moose a library of comedic observations and wisecracks which gave it a distinctive character.

The size used by Apple for their old monitors, and PCs for game controllers, is ""DA"", the size used by PC 9-pin serial and VGA is ""DE"".

VintageApple,2ylkw2,cpressland,4,Tue Mar 10 20:35:32 2015 UTC,You can mount the disk image to an external FireWire hard drive and boot from that. I would run my own copy of OS X off of my iPod back in high school (I think those were the PowerMac G4).

VintageApple,2y71u9,Amahoola,5,Sat Mar 7 00:55:40 2015 UTC,Welcome to the sad Mac club
VintageApple,2y71u9,softcore_robot,3,Sat Mar 7 05:04:01 2015 UTC,I didn't do anything with it yet. I also don't have a System 6 floppy. But does somebody know if this is a hardware failure and if I can fix it?
VintageApple,2y71u9,dmcnelly,5,Sat Mar 7 00:57:01 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's classic hardware failure.   The code it's throwing is a RAM test failure in bank A. So, you've got bad RAM. It can be fixed. But this looks like there might be more going on, unfortunately. Looks like the graphics chipset is failing too. That'd be harder to repair."
VintageApple,2y71u9,gaosc,1 point,Sat Mar 7 01:27:23 2015 UTC,Would the graphics chipset course errors to or will it just show those stripes? (because I can live with that.) And how would I fix the ram?
VintageApple,2y71u9,willywalloo,1 point,Sat Mar 7 10:55:44 2015 UTC,"I took it apart, and I saw that there where 4 1mb ram simms. I swapped Bank A with Bank B and then the error changed, so I looked it up and found that there was something wrong with bank B now. First I removed one, and had an error (00000005 F000F000). And than I removed the other one and placed simm 4 in simm 3. I got the same error. Then I removed both ram simms in Bank B (so Bank B is empty). When I booted up the pc there wasn't any error. But it didn't boot or show a floppy icon (the screen was just black). The led of the harddisk didn't go on. Does somebody know what I can try next."
VintageApple,2y71u9,TheDanielHolt,1 point,Sat Mar 7 14:55:06 2015 UTC,"There are jumpers on the Ram card that you can switch to 2mb or 4mb if I remember. The computer is ""working"" but needs to be recapped. Go to 68kmla.org and you will find a community that sells the caps and also repairs the boards for a small fee. The computer is fixable. The Ram can also be found on ebay for like $10 if you hunt around."
VintageApple,2y71u9,willywalloo,-1,Mon Mar 9 00:16:50 2015 UTC,"If you are willing to bet the board, you could try a re-heating of the board in a toaster oven. Remove all (removable) plastics. 350 degrees, 20 mins should do it. Mileage may very, every chef has their own recipe. This reconnects the solder joints on the graphics chip. And judging by the 'noise' on the output, it's a video memory(which could be shared with RAM) or GPU issue."
VintageApple,2y71u9,TheDanielHolt,3,Sat Mar 7 03:00:14 2015 UTC,I'm pretty damn sure this won't help with older hardware like this - I would say OPs problem is due to bad caps because that's what happens most of the time with the Classic Macs.
VintageApple,2y71u9,willywalloo,1 point,Sat Mar 7 17:55:42 2015 UTC,Dang. I havnt seen this board in a long time. Caps can be replaced pretty easily. I've done a few iMac G5 boards in the past.

VintageApple,2y3qcq,willywalloo,7,Fri Mar 6 04:06:58 2015 UTC,I have a ton of OS X day one release posters. 10.0 was sweet when it came out. Transformed my blue and white G3 completely. Was the OS it was always meant to run.
VintageApple,2y3qcq,sprashoo,3,Fri Mar 6 04:54:19 2015 UTC,"OS X was a dog when it came out. I remember the excitement when my 10.0 disc came - I knew the betas had been slow but I had believed the rumor sites that said that this was due to ""debugging code"". Anyway, that was not true :)  It turned my Lombard PowerBook G3 into a dog.   Great OS after a couple of revisions though!"
VintageApple,2y3qcq,kallekilponen,1 point,Fri Mar 6 13:26:42 2015 UTC,"Not really. IMO 10.0 should never have come out as a commercial release...it was more a beta version. 10.1 was usable, but still pretty buggy and 10.2 seemed like what it was meant to be all along.  I remember not switching over from OS 9 until 10.1 because I found 10.0 to be nearly unusable and 10.2 was the point I booted into OS X more often than OS 9."
VintageApple,2y3qcq,willywalloo,1 point,Sat Mar 7 03:55:05 2015 UTC,"Agreed. The geek in me loved the early terminal implementation and the simple utilities it had already built in. Like an mp3 player, native IE which was nice back then, the nearly crash proof kernal. The GUI was full of graphical issues at 10.0, but impressed everyone when I showed it off. My linux/Unix friends also found the command line familiar. It was right then that I knew that Apple had chosen a great path to ride On. And these have grown into the current version of the OS and iOS stuff."
VintageApple,2y3qcq,derfherdez,4,Sat Mar 7 04:30:48 2015 UTC,"10.0 was amazing, but 10.1 really turned the curve.... 10.2 was just freaking awesome."

VintageApple,2y3qcq,vexos,2,Fri Mar 6 11:22:31 2015 UTC,I think 10.5 is when Apple's vision really began to take shape. Some great new technologies (Time Machine is still the best home backup solution on the market) and refined visual style that stayed all the way through Mavericks.
VintageApple,2y3qcq,crawlywhat,2,Fri Mar 6 21:23:13 2015 UTC,"It also dropped support for classic witch is where indrawn the line between ""early versions"" of OS X and the more refined versions that were released after."

Then it moved to the ""Quicksilver"" chassis, which was the same physical design, only with a more 'silver' color, rather than the darker gray graphite.  Quicksilver lasted from the 733 (overlapping speed with the graphite ""Digital Audio"" model,) through 1 GHz.

If you upgrade the RAM to 2GB and get some of the bubble speakers, you might get a lot of use out of it yet. I use it for playing music (speakers are pretty decent) and watching movies and TV shows in bed (the LCD arm is terrific).   You have to work with its limitations, though. With the full RAM, Leopard is a must to get the most out of it (I dual boot with Tiger for Classic support). I've found it generally can't handle anything except cartoons in H.264 720p (I found they ran best in VLC). Live action shows on H.264 are mostly out of the question, though I've had some success playing them through iTunes of all apps. Shows and movies in DivX/XviD (.avi) generally run great though. MPlayer OSX Extended (with Perian installed) is my app of choice for those files. DVDs run like a dream.  TenFourFox or Webkit allow some light browsing and even (if you're patient enough to wait for it to completely buffer) HTML5 video on YouTube. Forget about Flash though...  Games of the time run pretty well. Age of Mythology is one example. It can handle some emulation as well. Genesis/Mega Drive games run well. I've had success with Playstation 1 games as well.  Consider installing a little app called Soundfly to stream audio to the iMac (works best over a wired connection). This is great if you want to utilise the speakers but don't have your entire music library on the iMac.  If you already knew all this, then nevermind. Good luck anyway!"

The iMac was the coolest thing ever, I used to make all sorts of awesome stuff on it.  I've actually had two Mac collections so far. This is my 'old collection' and sadly I don't have any of these computers anymore. I got rid of them in a fit of short sightedness. Huge regrets.  For the keenly eyed, in this room I've got 2x Mac 512ks, 2x Mac Plus, 1 Mac SE, and 1 Mac Classic. There's also a Powerbook Duo 280c/Duo Dock under the table, and a Mac IIsi, and some performa whose model number I can't exactly remember.  Under my bed - so not pictured - I had at least a PowerBook 160, a Mac LCII, Mac LCIII, and a fully decked out Apple IIGS with almost everything. Plus a heaps of monitors and accessories.

VintageApple,2w3hnd,p8712,1 point,Mon Feb 16 23:30:03 2015 UTC,"the biggest difference: silence! That thing is so quiet I can't even tell if it's on (without looking at the screen). I got a 16 or 32GB SSD. Probably 32 because I remember regretting not getting 64. It was fairly inexpensive.  I didn't spend too much time working with the original internal harddrive so I don't know the speeds, but when transfering to or from a flash drive, it's full USB 1 speeds of (half?) a MB per second. Internal, it's just blazing fast.  I can listen to music in iTunes and do something with the harddrive with no problem. I don't remember the last time music paused since I put the SSD in (before it would stop just about every second).  Although, if you do get a pata ssd, it may make a difference if you format it in OS 9 or OS X. Online I always saws posts about people formatting it in OS X and then not being able to run OS 9 on it (or at least assuming you can't). I figured if I bought a machine that can run OS 9, why take that away? So I tried formatting it in OS 9. And OS X can't mount the harddrive. (except in firewire diskmode) So I don't know if I'll be able to put OS X on it ... I may just buy the 64gb one, format it in os x, and if I can't get os 9 to work on it then I'll just pop it into my g4."

I believe Basilisk II can run System 6 but Mini vMac is meant more for the older Macs that were around when System 6 was in its prime.
VintageApple,2v6pmj,medes24,3,Sun Feb 8 12:18:24 2015 UTC,"Short answer: no.  Long answer: no way, no how. VirtualBox is just a virtualization solution, which for the most part just utilizes existing system resources and presents them to the software simply rewrapped. Most prominently: the CPU.  The trick is that System 6 runs on the Motorola 68000 family, and uses a lot of elements that are quite foreign on PCs. So to run System 6 you would have to emulate basically the entire machine, and that's not what VirtualBox does.  Emulation is far more complicated. Virtualization pretty much just passes instructions from the virtual CPU to the physical CPU. In an emulated system a complete mock-up of the CPU, and when an instruction is executed on the emulated CPU the host system has to run through the motions of simulating the entire process of how that emulated CPU would work, rather than executing the instructions directly on real hardware."

VintageApple,2v6pmj,ahandle,1 point,Tue Feb 10 22:43:53 2015 UTC,"Straight-up, no.  But yes: You need to install a host OS like OSX, Windows, Linux, first.  Then install an emulator within (Basilisk II or Mini vMac)"
VintageApple,2v4wyv,sylenthikillyou,8,Sat Feb 7 22:58:21 2015 UTC,"Personally, I enjoy the charm and nostalgia of my old Apple computers. Heck, most of them are older than me but I still just like the way they are.   Turning on my Performa 475 and knowing it hadn't seen the light of day in 10 years just sort of ignited this passion and sense of thrill in me that I can't really explain in words. It's like when you go to your ch ildhood home, except it's someone else's home and you're just looking at the front door.   I like the way they look - they look like my beige-box childhood.  I love cleaning them out, making them like new, upgrading them to once completely unaffordable specification.   The software also interests me. Owning computers with software from 1990 and onwards gives you a really interesting look at how things have changed in 25 years. Try using Photoshop from that long ago and then you really see the night and day difference.   All in all, everyone gets something different out of it. If you're not interested in the vintage side of Apple at the moment, why not try and pick up an old iBook or something cheap off of Craigslist and dive into the quirky retro world of old computers?   This is all just my two cents, hope it was interesting for you to read."
VintageApple,2v4wyv,PowerMac_G4,5,Sat Feb 7 23:56:07 2015 UTC,"One answer that would probably be the most understandable would be retro gaming. Emulators are nice, but nothing beats the original hardware. And that doesn't necessarily have to mean vintage Apple computers... that can include old PCs and consoles.  But generally, I think it's just fun. I recently got a PowerBook G3 off eBay, and last night I pulled it apart and put it all back together. Just to have a look, just to have something to do, and something to do with my hands.  It's also interesting to experience hardware you might not otherwise have gotten to. I was born in 1985. I didn't get to experience the buzz originally surrounding Apple with the Apple II or the Macintosh. By tracking those machines down at this point in my life I get to vicariously enjoy some of that buzz.  One really handy thing about playing with old computers is that it makes other old computers useful and worth owning. I have a 512k Macintosh, and the way I make disks for it is by using a Power Macintosh G3 as it's not only the last Mac to support a floppy drive, but it's also internet capable.  I dunno. There's lots of reasons :)"
VintageApple,2v4wyv,jdmoser,3,Sun Feb 8 02:52:43 2015 UTC,"I try to have a use for almost all of my vintage stuff... the IIe is my Oregon Trail machine, or occasionally a fun place to play around with BASIC. My LCIII has an awesome 'Mario Teaches Typing' game that was left on the HD when I bought it. I use my old PowerMacs to play other Classic games (Myst, Riven, etc), and to transfer pictures from my QuickTake camera through AppleTalk to an iBook clamshell running OSX (and then on to modern machines). I browse the web on iMac G3s just like I did once in school.   I never could have afforded all of those things when they were new (like /u/PowerMac_G4 said, maxing the hardware into a 'dream machine' is great), but it's fun to go back, to imagine how excited people were to use them when they were the latest and greatest technology available. And some of those things are straight up beautiful. The way the original Macintosh vaguely resembles a face, the iBook clamshell's colorful curves, I can really appreciate the industrial design."

VintageApple,2v4wyv,strider_sifurowuh,2,Thu Feb 19 00:12:52 2015 UTC,"For me, it's a little like the guys who buy the car they badly wanted in high school.  What a lot of people don't realize is just how expensive hardware used to be.  People complain that a new MacBook runs over $2,000 or that you have to drop $2,500 on the Retina iMac.  Well, when I was in college in 1990, one computer everyone was drooling over was the Mac IIfx.  I wanted one so badly.  But in 1990, the IIfx cost $10,000.  According to data.bls.gov, a IIfx would cost $18,113 in 2014 dollars.  My main desktop today is a 2011 Mac Mini I bought new for $599 and bumped up to 8GB.  I don't play games or tax the CPU much, so this machine is super fast for me and hardly cost anything.  I think my family paid about $3,000 for a //e about 30 years ago.  I bought my IIfx about ten years ago for $150.  It was my dream machine and it is still smoking fast running System 6.0.8.  I use it now and then, but there's something wonderful about buying what was once completely unattainable.  The other computer everyone drooled over in the campus bookstore was the NeXT Cube.  That and the IIfx always had a crowd around them.  So I bought a Cube a few years ago, too.  It is still exciting to use.  I did have a Mac Classic way back then and still love the all-in-one Macs.  I have about 20 of them, all bought or found about 15 years ago.  Most cost $5 and I have a few I found left out for trash collection.  Finally, I do look at these as sort of an investment.  In the US, people buy stuff, people throw it away, and then everyone wants it again.  This happens to pretty much all consumer goods.  The original Apple I machines are just about at that 40 year mark and they've been going for a healthy six figures.  I don't have any illusions of that, but I do think I'll make a healthy amount on them.  And if not, it isn't like I have a lot invested.  Maybe $500-$600 total."

System 6 is what I learned computers on so I am very nostalgic for it.  To be honest, I emulate my old Mac (Performa 637CD) more than I run it.  It's mostly on my desk to give my setup a bit of flair.   A lot of the software works just fine today though.  I can use early 90s Word Processors to do what I want just as much as the new version of Office.   Lack of modern Internet is a nuisance but FTP still works.  Actually the main thing that keeps me from using my Performa more is lack of USB.  Seriously fuck floppy disks.  We did 't know how bad we had it."

It has some features that Mac OS didn't have for well over a decade. Granted, the Office System pretty much only has Apple's 7 apps, but it's really cool to see it in action. Just the other day I discovered that installing the apps is different than on a Mac; you hit Apple-D to duplicate the app off the floppy into RAM, then drag the duplicate to the Widget drive. Looking at that shows how much things have evolved. For me, using a Lisa for the first time was experiencing history."

VintageApple,2v4wyv,strider_sifurowuh,1 point,Thu Feb 19 00:10:35 2015 UTC,"Yeah, this is a great subreddit. It's really fascinating to see what people have collected!  I haven't yet collected any vintage Mac stuff (although I'm really keen on a G4 Cube...not to use, but to turn into a piece of furniture/decoration).  So I can understand the motivation. The most ""retro"" thing I have is a Japanese Nintendo Virtual Boy, in its original packaging. It works beautifully and it's still in good-as-new condition. I bring it out now and then to show people, since it's such a weird oddity. But it's also nice just to own it; it's a piece of history, and I think it's especially relevant now with the resurgence of VR.  So, I can definitely see how people really feel like they are connecting with history when they pick up these vintage models; that's literally what they are doing, after all. I think that technology changes so rapidly that it's easy for some of these older, beautiful creations to simply be discarded on the scrap heap because they are no longer ""useful"" or are ""too slow"".  But in time, I think we'll come more and more to appreciate the historical value of these objects...many of them represented fundamental sea changes in thinking and it's pretty remarkable to own a piece of that. :-)"

Then, in Desktop and Screensaver, I changed by wallpaper to Dark Gray Medium, in Solid Colors.  For the Apple logo, I used this tutorial.  Then I changed the icons of the applications I keep on my dock to black and white (duplicate icon, set saturation as low as possible in (Tools -> Adjust Color). Then I right clicked on the app in Finder and copied and pasted the new icon onto the old icon preview in Get Info. Rinse and repeat for each icon, including all the folders I wanted black and white.  Of course, I don't really have a System Folder on the desktop, and all the folders inside were fake, just to get the full effect of the recreation of the original image.

Not to sure what the networking capabilities of the Mac SE are so your only recourse might be to get a USB floppy drive for your main computer and move data on old diskettes.   Have to eBay all of that I am sure.    I have found it useful to maintain emulated versions of my Performa on my desktop Mac and my Macbook.

Corel stopped releasing WordPerfect for Macs after 3.5 so I've had to have a System 7 machine around all that time to use it lol! Basic word processing needs can be handled by these old computers no problem, as long as you have a method of pulling the files off.

VintageApple,2uud5w,ahandle,1 point,Thu Feb 5 17:53:58 2015 UTC,Get a PDS Ethernet adapter. (PM me if you want to buy mine.)  Max out the RAM  Buy a SCSI CDROM drive and a bigger SCSI HDD.  Install NetBSD or Debian m68k.
VintageApple,2umd1s,catatonicChimp,5,Tue Feb 3 09:27:19 2015 UTC,"You will also need a way to write 400k floppy disks. That is the hardest part.   I might suggest a BMOW FloppyEmu, as you'll still need to get terminal software onto the Mac."
VintageApple,2umd1s,mbaran,1 point,Tue Feb 3 17:44:58 2015 UTC,"Awesome, that looks like a much easier way then having to deal with trying to write 400k disks.

VintageApple,2umd1s,mbaran,1 point,Tue Feb 3 21:54:01 2015 UTC,"Oh, it's not much faster than a real floppy, I believe it's pretty much limited by the CPU.  You definitely won't get the sound though. Are they still sold out?"

VintageApple,2umd1s,RichB93,3,Tue Feb 3 23:54:38 2015 UTC,"Sounds like a pretty cool project! I can't give you too much Mac-specific advice, but I did a similar thing with an Apple IIc a few years ago. Some things I've come across that may get you in the right direction:  A Mac 128K has a DB-9 serial port, so with a serial-to-USB adapter it should be fairly straightforward to get it talking to a Raspberry Pi as a terminal. Depending on the version of your system disks, you may or may not have MacTerminal on there, which should do everything you need for the first phase of your plan.  In general, getting old Macs to talk to the modern world can be a bit of a pain, as the OS uses a lot of Apple-specific protocols, some of which aren't even supported by modern Mac OS X versions. For writing programs or transferring files, a modern Mac and/or an emulator like SheepShaver might save you some headaches.  As far as transferring other software, this site gives a guide for doing it from a modern Mac to an older one, but it seems like the general principle is a serial link and a terminal program that can do XModem on both ends which shouldn't be too hard to find if you're not running a Mac on the ""modern"" end.   There was this article a while back about writing programs that run all the way back to System 1.0 on a modern OS X machine - again, needs a modern Mac, but might point you in the right direction for doing some of the same tasks in an emulator.  Keep us posted if you make any headway!"
VintageApple,2umd1s,ahandle,3,Tue Feb 3 14:21:10 2015 UTC,"Make sure you remove that battery! You don't have to replace it, but at least remove it, as the acid can leak and destroy traces on the logic board rendering the system unusable.  Re: Your question I imagine that you could bit-bang data into the machine over the GPIO ports of the Pi to the serial port on the Mac."
VintageApple,2umd1s,3583Bytes,3,Tue Feb 3 18:17:32 2015 UTC,"Don't worry, the first thing I did was remove the battery... it looked like it had only leaked a little, and we sprayed the area around it with an electronics cleaner that is supposed to neutralise battery acid, not that we could see any leaks onto the board."

VintageApple,2u9fxi,iASD,3,Sat Jan 31 01:34:39 2015 UTC,"Any OEM batteries left unsold are probably rotted beyond use.  I'd imagine the best way is to get your hands on a used battery no matter the condition and buy new cells.  I'd imagine that they're relatively standardized in terms of size, shape, capacity, and voltage.  It's worth noting that most new Li-Ion cells are of a higher voltage which will cause the cells not to charge properly in the laptop and could damage the computer."
VintageApple,2u9fxi,coonster,1 point,Sat Jan 31 04:12:50 2015 UTC,"Thanks, that sounds like the best plan. From what I can tell I think it's gonna be cheaper to buy another full spares or repair iBook with a dead battery as it's hard to find dead batteries on their own. On the plus side at least I'll have some other spare parts incase I ever need them."
VintageApple,2u9fxi,coonster,1 point,Sat Jan 31 10:52:10 2015 UTC,"What sort of battery life are you hoping for?  My iBook G3 SE has its original battery and it lasts ~30 minutes to 1 hour although percentage reporting isn't accurate (it will drop suddenly around 50% and you'll have a few minutes to shut it off before it dies).  If you just want a battery so its complete (and so you can demonstrate how wireless it really is by putting it through a hula hoop like Steve Jobs) and runs without AC, a used battery or one pulled from another clamshell iBook should do the job."
VintageApple,2u9fxi,eatthebankers,2,Sat Jan 31 12:51:27 2015 UTC,"Lmao, seems you've seen right through me, putting it through a hoop like Steve Jobs is exactly what I intended :p  Joking aside I'd be happy with even an hour or so charge out of it. Obviously more would be nice, I've seen videos of people stating their iBooks have 4 hours battery life but I'd be surprised if that were accurate today. To be honest my biggest frustration is if the cord gets unplugged or I even just want to take it to another room I loose what I was doing and with it being an old machine it takes ages to reboot. So just having a bit of battery life would be great."
VintageApple,2u9fxi,eatthebankers,1 point,Sat Jan 31 13:33:43 2015 UTC,"Fer crimes sake! Just buy the battery on eBay! FYI are you sure it is the battery and not the power control? When you get it you will know. In the mean time, lock the clock and put your work in a folder. ( I am going thru same with mine, I have to charge the battery on my other iBook.) I pulled the charger port out of a donor but too lazy to get her open and plug it in. Sigh..."

I'm old enough to remember when the SE/30 came out and I wanted one desperately.  All I could afford was the Classic, which I also loved.  So, for some of us, a SE/30 is a dream machine.  Enough have been recycled or destroyed, so it would be nice to see one given another chance.  Also, have a look at what vintage Apple I machines have been selling for.  A SE/30 will never be worth that much, but there's a good chance it will fetch a thousand or two within the next ten years.  Vintage computing will be a thing and people will want a working old Mac.  Especially a classic like the SE/30.  If you make it into a clock, it will be worth only as much as the case, which someone will try to restore into a working Mac sooner or later.

VintageApple,2sydgk,Gamer9430,2,Mon Jan 19 17:49:06 2015 UTC,This is super common for the 1st gen macs with SystemSavers or other external fans. The reason being is that the fans tend to draw a bulk of their air through the floppy opening. This will cause dust and lint to gather up around the floppy mechanism.  If you crack it open (being careful around the high voltage components of course) you may be able to bring it back to life just by cleaning out all of the dust and gunk that is likely to be built up around the eject mechanism. It may also need re-greasing. Failing both of those things it's likely that the springs have lost tension and need to be replaced. Try the cleaning first though - it's free!
