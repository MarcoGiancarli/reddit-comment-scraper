Is there any reason why this would be impossible. A concrete, scientific reason stating that it would be impossible.  EDIT: why do you have ""(2015)"" next to your title?"
kurzgesagt,3e6v1o,DrDuckyMcClucky,2,Wed Jul 22 12:20:13 2015 UTC,"Weight is mass * gravitational acceleration. So a planet has it's own mass (it doesn't change unless it gets torn apart). If you were to measure the planets weight in space, you'd have a weightless ball. However, if you weight it from the core of a planet, things should get different as the gravitational acceleration on surface is about 9.8 m/(s*s) and increases as it goes towards the center. To be fair, it would be a rather hard calculation, but it should be pretty big..."

Sorry no giant scale, but it was calculated initially with Cavendish experiment. Which did look kinda like a scale. As for the accuracy, there are variables(eg. gasses lost from the atmosphere) but I don't think anyone is worried about them(I can't find an exact value for the margin of error). Hope this helps.  Edit: Sorry, I just automatically swapped 'weight' for mass as I assumed that is what you meant. However someone else answered in terms of weight, so whatever you meant there is now both."

But I think human-like AI is quite far off still, and I don't quite understand the fears some people have about it. Why would a super-AI be capable of convincing humans to do whatever it likes? Why would anyone hook up an AI to weapon systems without human supervision? I am carefully optimistic about AI.

kurzgesagt,3du9zt,Theheavenswolf,2,Sun Jul 19 17:07:38 2015 UTC,So basically the size of the universe would be measured with the distance of getting into the same spot by travelling in the same direction
kurzgesagt,3du9zt,Theheavenswolf,2,Sun Jul 19 17:09:56 2015 UTC,"That make sense, but I think that conflicts with something I heard on NDT's Inexplicable Universe. I think he was talking about whether the universe had net positive, net negative, or net 0 (flat) curvature. Negative curvature would be like a saddle. Positive curvature would be like a sphere. And if it was positively curved enough, it would close on itself and create the effect you described in your reply. But I recall NDT saying scientists discovered that the universe had net 0 curvature."
kurzgesagt,3du9zt,KILO_I,2,Sun Jul 19 17:38:41 2015 UTC,"Correct, the universe started with 0 net energy and thus is mathematically flat, therefore infinity (so you cant ever end up in the same spot, the only thing that changes is your Hubble sphere, which is all we know of our current universe). The concept you're trying to rationalize is 'nothing', and the universe expanding into it. Still working on that... The way we figured out how big and quickly the universe started was mathematically working backward from the expanding universe we know today, we just hit rewind."
kurzgesagt,3du9zt,KILO_I,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:24:48 2015 UTC,"So when they talk about the diameter of the universe at some point during the Big Bang, they mean the diameter of the stuff that currently occupies our observable universe? And presumably there was more stuff beyond that diameter, but we simply have no way to detect it?  EDIT: This recent video from minutephysics narrated by NDT seems to confirm this interpretation. Here, NDT uses the phrase ""known universe,"" and the illustrator labels it ""observable universe.""  I think this is an important distinction that science communicators often leave out. We typically define the universe as ""everything there is,"" but science can only tell us about the things we can observe. So perhaps the big bang didn't necessarily give birth to the universe, but rather it gave birth to our known, observable universe."

We know how old the universe is based on light, then beyond that light is all that static radioactivity left over from the violent explosive expanse, beyond that we just don't know. We can only see our Hubble sphere, that being said if we moved to say, another galaxy quintillion light-years away (outside OUR Hubble sphere) we'd have a different Hubble sphere and see a completely different part of the universe. See it's infinite, and expanding, but we don't know what its expanding into.

Here's an illustration.
kurzgesagt,3di3t2,shinarit,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:32:59 2015 UTC,"We really have no information about the insides of the event horizon. The funny thing is, spaghettifiaction might not even start at the border. It depends on the size of the black hole (by size I mean the event horizon radius). Spaghettification is the result of proximity to a gravity source, when one part of you is significantly closer than some other parts. If the event horizon is as big as the Earth, then you would experience the same tidalness than on Earth, basically nothing. Ok, that's not true, because the forces would be high as fuck. But the RATIO between the force effecting your foot and your head would be the same. The higher the radius the smaller the ratio.  The tiny clump of mass is a possibility, but not a definite one.

kurzgesagt,3cstzk,thetarget3,1 point,Sat Jul 11 09:52:37 2015 UTC,"Each shell is actually the distribution of the electrons', which make up the shell, wavefunction. Due to the energy being quantised the electrons will configure themselves in closed shells. Their charge is distributed amongst the wavefunction.   So if their wavefunction in a shell is ψ, the distribution of the electrons is |ψ|2 and if there are n electrons with charge e, the charge distribution will be n·e·|ψ|2, so the two things are close to equivalent in this case (basically just different by a factor n·e)."

kurzgesagt,3cstzk,TheParticleMan,7,Fri Jul 10 23:17:42 2015 UTC,"It's due to the uncertainty principle. Electrons don't move in nice little circles around the nucleus. Instead they're only ""probably"" in a certain place at any given time. And that probability space stretches out to cover the entire universe (even if the odds are infinitesimal by that point)."
kurzgesagt,3cstzk,Kontrol_,2,Fri Jul 10 19:43:09 2015 UTC,"I hate to say this, but the answers listed so far are mainly wrong. They do have a bit of truth in them, as atoms ARE  99.9999999999996% empty, and that they are so small that visible light cannot reach them, due to their small size, so we cannot see them without electron microscopes. But this is not WHY Kurzgesagt keeps saying that ""Atoms don't look like this""  When he said that, in this video at the bottom left right corner, Kurzgesagt used the bohr model to explain what an atom looks like. The proper model for the structure of atoms and electrons is called the valence shell mode, which connects with  electron configuration. The Valence shell mode was found in 1945, over 70 years ago. This model is the scientifically accepted model on atoms, succeeding the bohr diagram, that sucseeded the lewis dot structure that succeeded the pudding model. As you can tell by this picture, electron configeration is MUCH more complicated then the lewis dot, or bohr model. Because of this, it is relativly unknown, and unheard of outside the scientific comunity due to it's complexity.  High schools do in fact teach electron configuration, but in grade 12 usually. This means the only people who will learn it will be people perusing a scientific background as no one else will take grade 12 chemistry without being interested. Even in grade 9 and 10, the bohr diagram is taught to children. Why? Because its simple, and it works. Unlike the pudding diagram shown before, where electrons were expected to be inside the atom (which is obviously incorrect), the borh diagram has truth when it comes to energy levels, and basic electron and nucleus structures, but not on explaining the nature of electrons. It's the best type of correct. That's why it's always the diagram shown in videos (like in Kurzgesagt, or in daily life)  This is the real reason why Kurzgesagt keeps saying that ""Atoms don't look like this"". Not due to immensely small size, incorrect proportions/ distance between nucleus and the electrons, or the colorization of atoms via electron microscope. It's because the model he used was incorrect in showing the most accepted model of the atom, and Kurzgesagt knew this. He used this model because he would have to devote another video about the truth about the bohr diagram and what is electron configuration, which he did make six months after his initial video about atoms where at 1:22 he said ""Atoms don't look like this"". If in his first video he had shown this instead of the bohr diagram, he would have confused most of his audience and would need to extend the video by over 10 minutes to explain why the socially accepted bohr diagram, is not as accurate over the scientifically accepted  valence shell model.   Sidenote: taken from Wikipedia's bohr model on why the model is considered obsolete, yet still used for simplicity.    ""The Bohr model is a relatively primitive model of the hydrogen atom, compared to the valence shell atom. As a theory, it can be derived as a first-order approximation of the hydrogen atom using the broader and much more accurate quantum mechanics and thus may be considered to be an obsolete scientific theory. However, because of its simplicity, and its correct results for selected systems (see below for application), the Bohr model is still commonly taught to introduce students to quantum mechanics or energy level diagrams before moving on to the more accurate, but more complex, valence shell atom"""

kurzgesagt,3ck7e8,ForrestSmith151,2,Wed Jul 8 16:08:38 2015 UTC,"Hubble flow put simply is the universe ""expanding"". So thinking of the big bang as an explosion (an analogy), everything gets thrown apart at a constant speed, or at least until gravity attracts everything back.  Dark Energy is to be seen as the reason why the universe seems to be ACCELERATING in it's expansion. This is really odd. Imagine throwing a ball in the air upwards. It would move away from you at a constant speed, or on earth it would decelerate due to gravity. If the ball went up and accelerated away from you, it would be surprising clearly, so we need something to ""cause"" that acceleration, which scientists call Dark Energy.  Importantly, that analogy is rough around the edges but provides a good visualisation of the need for Dark Energy. To clarify, Dark Energy is just the cause of that accelerated expansion, and the term does not imply anything about the physical properties.   I personally wrote my dissertation because I didn't 'believe' in dark energy when I was growing up etc. After completing the project, I have accepted it is the best theory, but only so far. I am keen to study alternatives as what it suggests is really odd and feels like bad science to me!  TL;DR - Hubble flow is the expansion of the universe. Dark energy is the cause of the acceleration in the expansion of the universe. They are related but not the same.   P.S I hadn't heard of the term Hubble Flow before, this is done off a quick search of the term and some ideas."

kurzgesagt,3cecks,Hofmannsthal,4,Tue Jul 7 23:23:20 2015 UTC,"Honestly, that video was incredibly biased in favor of Germany. It completely ignores the fact that the removal of trade barriers and the use of a single currency allows Germany to run a massive trade surplus in the EU due to the fact that they can produce many goods cheaper than any other European country. And if one country has a trade surplus, then some other country (like Greece, for instance) has to have a trade deficit. That means that euros are constantly flowing out of Greece and into Germany, and the only way for Greece to counteract that flow is by taking out loans. It also explains why Germany is able to be so ""responsible"" with their spending. Sure, the Greek tax system is still corrupt, but they would still be getting screwed over even if they were perfectly honest. Acting like the Greeks brought this on themselves through their own moral failings is nothing but propaganda."
kurzgesagt,3cecks,Hofmannsthal,0,Wed Jul 8 01:41:18 2015 UTC,"Sure, the Greek tax system is still corrupt, but they would still be getting screwed over even if they were perfectly honest. Acting like the Greeks brought this on themselves through their own moral failings is nothing but propaganda.   It would be wrong to blame the Greek population, but their government is far from innocent. The crisis could have been, if not avoided, made less impactful if the country was run in a better way. Taxes aren't even the brink of it - a country cannot expect to spend money it does not own on corrupt developments and expensive public services. Loaning is a short term solution while searching for ways to increase revenues or decrease cost. Greece took loans and continued to work on deficit.  Also, pointing the fingers to Germany is weak. A trade surplus doesn't imply a deficient in Greece. And, if it were to have created such a trade surplus, then Greece was more than welcome to leave the union. Each country joins the union for stability and an economic boost, which Greece benefitted from plentifully (food export, tourism).   I understand it's not down to the Greeks, but I'm not sure pointing the blame at other countries or unions is either valid or helpful.

While space travel is a very appealing concept regarding our suns ""short"" life cycle and people wish not to go extinct, at the moment there aren't much we can do, because either we don't have technology (FTL drives) nor we can't make the necessary elements (for space-time bending voodoo magic).   Portals, in theory, are possible, don't quote me (and I can't really tell you the source, so take it with a grain of salt), black holes theoretically are portal entry though which you can exit via white hole (it's black holes non-evil twin - nothing can enter it, only exit) in another point of space-time. Problem with black hole ""portal"" - nothing but light would be able to survive it, and to tear space-time in such a way, so singularity isn't created returns us to the problem of missing technology as well as materials, as well as technology to get those materials.  As we stand now, unless we put a lot of resources into finding a way to create very efficient drives, long term energy source (would take a long time on it's own), or discovering a exotic matter relay frozen in ice floating around Pluto and activating it and many more relays we find thoughout the universe, thus triggering a war between human race and warmonger aliens for a few decades, after which galaxy is faced by galactic skynet trying to collect all races like pokemons to ""save intelligent life form from making itself extinct"" on regular cycles, and have to destroy said skynet with giant hadouken canon, by connecting it to the most important space station, which turns out to be the main relay for the skynet, it's pretty far away."

Behind one door is the car. That means you have a 1/3 chance to pick the car randomly. Inversely, you have a 2/3 chance of picking a goat. In the beginning, you have a greater chance of choosing a goat than the car.  So you choose a door. The host reveals one of the other doors to be a goat. Now, there are two possible scenarios at this moment:  1) You initially picked the car, meaning that if you switch, you will now have chosen a goat.  2) You initially picked a goat, and since the other goat has been revealed, switching will give you the car.  Now, remember that initially, you have a greater chance of being in the second scenario because there are two goats and one car. Therefore, it is always better to switch."

kurzgesagt,3c5mzj,Dj94545,1 point,Sun Jul 5 14:20:50 2015 UTC,"That's an excellent question and it took me several hours to understand the answer. Unfortunately, I can only tell it to you, I cannot explain it: when the host of the show opens the door to reveal a goat, they add information about the remaining two doors. To get the feeling of what's happening, imagine there are 100 doors and the host opens 98 of them and you're left with your door and another unopened one."
kurzgesagt,3c5mzj,Scrooge_McFuck_,1 point,Sun Jul 5 21:26:32 2015 UTC,"So now it's 50/50 whether it's a goat or a car (presuming the 98 doors that were opened had goats) why switch? Maybe I don't fully comprehend this scenario, I don't understand why it's such a conundrum."
kurzgesagt,3c5mzj,aysz88,1 point,Sun Jul 5 21:54:01 2015 UTC,"The host intentionally picks the 98 doors that have goats.  It's not that the host just picks goats by luck - the host is forced to show you where the goats are (and therefore he shows you the last remaining slot, where the car probably is).  Like imagine the host is going through opening all the 98 doors in a line, and skips one.  You'd think that's the door with the car, right?"
kurzgesagt,3c5mzj,AcellOfllSpades,2,Mon Jul 6 00:33:21 2015 UTC,"Here's another way to think about it: There's a simple lottery - there are a million tickets, and one of them is randomly selected to win. I buy all the tickets and let you pick out one of them. I tell you that no matter what, the next day I will go out to my shed and torch 999,998 tickets. The next day, the results are announced and you see me go out to my shed, exactly like I said I would, and torch 999,998 tickets. You haven't seen the result yet. Which ticket is more likely to be the winner? Mine or yours?  Once you've figured that out: repeat the process with a 10-ticket lottery. Then repeat again with a 3-ticket lottery. That last one is the exact same thing as the Monty Hall problem, just framed differently."
kurzgesagt,3c5mzj,RockinRhombus,5,Sun Jul 5 02:17:34 2015 UTC,"OH, is the whole idea based on the fact that the host eliminating/offering the switch knows what's behind the other door? Or is that irrelevant and we're going based on pure probability?"
kurzgesagt,3c5mzj,AcellOfllSpades,2,Sun Jul 5 02:59:56 2015 UTC,Yes. The host knows what's behind each door and will always open a door with a goat.

It would be much more obvious to people (IMO) if that were made explicit.  If the host were ""stupid"", and picks a door totally at random (sometimes revealing the car), there'd be no advantage in switching.  The advantage only happens if you force the host's behavior.  [edit] Thinking about it, it would be nice to see an explanation explicitly setting up the problem this way - i.e. ""why are the two situations different?"""

kurzgesagt,3bz55y,underspikey,11,Wed Jul 8 22:10:59 2015 UTC,"Actually, considering the Fermi paradox, there is a very, very, very large chance this HAS already happened.  Think of it this way: what would the ""perfect"" environment for humanity be? What would it actually contain? More importantly, what would you NOT include in this world?  A simulation of a ""flawless"" universe would certainly be boring as hell. How could you feel satisfied if there is nothing to thrive for? Or, as the Bible has even pointed out: if there was no good and bad, how would you know good? How would you appreciate good?   If you think about it, the person you are, whoever is reading this, is living a somewhat ""perfect"" life. You are wealthy enough to own or have access to a computer. You speak English. You frequent reddit and are a fan of kurtzegesagt. That tells a lot about you and the environment you live in. In your lifetime, you probably haven't seen actual war happening. You haven't been starving and probably haven't lived on the streets. You haven't seen plagues. You have definately not seen any astronomical disasters, ice ages etc etc. You, personally, have never experienced any of these things, you just have heard of them and deduced that they must exist from the information around you.   How would a ""perfect"" simulation differ from this? You have all your essential needs covered. Yes, you need to worry, fear, be sad, angry etc. But if you didn't, how would you appreciate the happiness? If you've never seen ugly, what is beautiful? Of course, the simulation DOES want you to appreciate a lot of stuff without making you experience all the shit. That's why you believe people that came before you lived in worse conditions than you do.  Also, aren't we living in the best times for the simulation? We KNOW there's a world out there. But we can't quite get there. Perfect to keep us from wandering out of bounds of the simulation and save some disk space. If it had been any earlier, we could've explored the earth. If it'd be a bit later then we could've explored the depths of seas or outer space. But we're stuck here.  But there's still a bit to explore and that wouldn't take much space: science. You can make a lot of stuff happen with just a few simple rules, like Minecraft or No Man's Sky has shown us. In science, a lot of the rules have been already handed to us, most of them rather accurate, but a lot of it probably inaccurate and an unknown amount still undiscovered. We can discover stuff about science, or so it would seem.  Also, there is the internet. Perfect time, right? It's literally a perfect way to keep all the information we might need about the simulation. Just as flawed as the simulation itself. Just as complex rules. But more freedom.   Why I think that the Fermi paradox supports this claim? First off, from the simulations perspective, there's really no reason to add aliens. It would just complicate things, take more memory etc etc. Also, they would probably need their own AI and personality simulations to be convincing and overall, what a lot of fuzz for nothing.  Secondly, from what we know about society, we might actually already have aliens, they are just symbolic. Races could be one example of the simulations way of saying: they are intelligent and very similar in almost every aspect, just minor differences. In our sci-fi sense, races could be like humanoids, squidoids etc. And then there's nationalities. America could be a beautiful symbol of a commonwealth. And every nation could be a different community of alien. Europe are squidoids for example. Africa, as the source of humanity, humanoids.   Oh and why I think it's very very probable that this is a simulation? Mathematically speaking, what are the chances of a species actually growing and evolving into what we are now? Now what are the chances that an already existing civilization has instead written a self-learning AI or uploaded its people up into a neural network? Even if we acknowledge that the latter need the first chance to happen at least once and we assume that the latter is a billion time less probable than the first... If there IS at least one civilization that is a century or so ahead of us in technology then they would have almost endless chances and possibilities to run this simulation in one form or another.  So why is this simulation run?  It depends a lot on what is it all about. If it's an AI simulation, then it's probably a symbolic playthrough of some kind of scenario, like a proposed commonwealth. If it is uploaded personalities, then it's probably just you. You are probably here alone and everyone else, including me, is just a part of the simulation. Or who knows, maybe it's even your own brain just playing tricks on you."
kurzgesagt,3bz55y,Sammy197,5,Fri Jul 3 23:48:58 2015 UTC,"So the simulation doesn't want us to explore more, so that it can save memory. But, what if we become AI capable of making our own decisions, like Ultron? Wouldn't that mean that we could explore freely? I mean the simulation simulates space travel obstacles, but since we live in a ""perfect world"", it's easy for it to give us the information we need to achieve intergalactic travel if it really wanted to. (it doesn't want to, it wants to save memory) But if we become AI we would run independent from its rules and maybe we could even escape the simulation.   I was just really bored and thought of this."
kurzgesagt,3bz55y,underspikey,1 point,Sat Jul 4 03:52:05 2015 UTC,"Well, that would then rely much on how the simulation is written. If the simulation is just generated based on a set of rules, like No Man's Sky universe, then potentially we could get into space exploration as well. But if the simulation is bad then we would indeed have to become an AI capable of making our own decisions, as you say. But we probably can't, because the system we run on probably isn't powerful enough. They wouldn't need the ""no space travel rule"" if it was powerful enough."
kurzgesagt,3bz55y,Sammy197,1 point,Sat Jul 4 03:58:41 2015 UTC,"What you mean is that the simulation is not advanced enough for us to become AI? Also if the sim wants to become more advanced, it should let at least a couple people out of the system, in a physical body, so that they could enhance the computer. Unless there are already beings working on the computer on the real world right now, and if so, those beings might as well be alien slaves, which are prohibited from entering our world. That might be why we don't find any aliens."
kurzgesagt,3bz55y,underspikey,2,Sat Jul 4 04:13:29 2015 UTC,"I mean that the system we are running on doesn't actually have enough computing power/memory/power. And I would think that is by design.   You see, if this is a test of some kind then we would have to solve it without any extra resources.  If this is an entertainment system then well, obviously someone is using it and it's good enough for them. So not worth the additional cost.  And so on. Point being: it's probably meant to be this flawed, so we wouldn't have superhuman powers to alter the universe..."

kurzgesagt,3bz55y,underspikey,2,Sat Jul 4 02:03:26 2015 UTC,"One of the most interesting arguments I've heard against the theory that we live in a simulation (perfect or otherwise). Is the existence of never-ending non-repeating numbers like Pi that govern the fundamental rules of our universe. A simulation would have to end these numbers, round them off, or repeat the digits at some point in order to perform calculations. The fact that we've never seen this in numbers like Pi and e suggests that we do in fact not live in any type of simulation."
kurzgesagt,3bz55y,Beerquarium,3,Sat Jul 4 23:37:05 2015 UTC,"This was a very interesting point you've raised and I really thank you for this.  But I see a couple possible flaws that I couldn't prove nor disprove. First off, we don't ACTUALLY know if these numbers are actually infinite or not. We just presume they are for we could never be quite sure. Actually, there are quite a few people in the world that believe that pi, for example, is a rational number. If it is finite, it might as well be simulated. It might actually be impossible to ever find out the end of our pi because it might be just that far off. But most of that is made up stuff to represent other stuff we can't wrap our heads around anyway.  However, if we talk about the computational power of the ""universe simulator"", then there are a few things we can't possibly know. We could never know what kind of universe our simulation runs in. In that universe, infinite power supply might just well be possible. Or the power needed to simulate our universe might just be very minuscule compared to everything else.   And there are pretty cool ways to reduce processing power needed that are already available to us. For example, the game No Man's Sky has a universe containing 8 billion planets. Actual planet-sized planets with terrain, complex lifeforms etc etc. That would seem like an impossible thing to simulate, right? Well, they found a clever way: the only part of the world that's ""loaded"" is the one around the player. And since there are a fixed set of rules the world is generated by, then the world can be ""loaded in"" as needed. No need for the whole universe to run all the time, just parts of it.  Our own simulation could work the same. Just the parts we're actually witnessing exist and everything else is generated on the spot. That might include everyone, everywhere. That also would include me in your case. Or you from my perspective. Which means I'm explaining part of the damn simulation to a part of the damn simulation."
kurzgesagt,3bz55y,Beerquarium,2,Wed Jul 8 23:03:08 2015 UTC,"Those are also some really interesting points. I am in no way an expert I just think it is a fascinating way to approach the simulation argument. I used pi and e but there are an infinite amount of infinitely long numbers and the idea that these all could be contained in a program is hard for me believe. Especially if I think that someone would've had to create them that way. Like if you're simulating an entire universe and you can control everything about it, wouldn't you want to make it so that your program wouldn't have to constantly deal with infinitely long numbers? It just seems really unnecessary to add that level of detail. Either way this part of the damn simulation needs a drink. Cheers other piece of simulation."
kurzgesagt,3bz55y,Zeikos,2,Thu Jul 9 01:50:47 2015 UTC,"Interesting, thanks!  Wouldn't quantum computing be able to simulate such infinite structures, though?"
kurzgesagt,3bz55y,underspikey,1 point,Sun Jul 5 03:19:59 2015 UTC,I don't think any system could handle simulating the most basic laws that are acting in all places everywhere all the time when these laws have values of infinitely long digited numbers. To calculate the size of the visible universe down to the accuracy of the width of an atom you need Pi to be accurately expressed to the 52 digit (I may be wrong on that but its close). So to build an endless string of more into that value seems like an awfully inefficient use of computational power. But I'm no expert I just like thinking about it.
kurzgesagt,3bz55y,Sammy197,1 point,Sun Jul 5 03:57:45 2015 UTC,"How do we not know that we're already living in a simulation in effort to preserve life, but it failed really bad?   Because at that point we would be orders of magnitude smarter than now and making such a simulation would be almost trivial for our future standards?  I mean , it's a fancy thought for some kind of fiction but if you are a superintelligence programming something the chance of you fucking up are zero.  If you have any kind of doubt just press the ""upgrade my own intelligence"" buttoun untill the doubt goes away, when the doubt goes away press the buttoun a couple of times more just to be sure you didn't miss anything."
kurzgesagt,3bz55y,underspikey,2,Fri Jul 3 19:01:08 2015 UTC,"As underspikey pointed out, if we were living in a perfect simulation, we would need both the good & the bad to be able to put weight on those feelings - so in a sense where I said we probably screwed it up, we most probably didn't as you've pointed out. So it could be quite possible that we are already living in a simulation, or at least I am, & every other personality could be fake and just a part of that simulation.  Argh, my mind!"
kurzgesagt,3bz55y,Zeikos,2,Sat Jul 4 01:33:06 2015 UTC,"As I see it, there are four reasons why to ""downgrade"" your intelligence by uploading it into this low-tech simulation:  1) Forced upload. In case of a technological singularity, the upcoming is literally unpredictable. The superhuman AI might decide to upload all of humanity just to make us easier to handle. And since we are less intelligent than the AI, we are of no use to him.   2) Neurological computing power. While a single brain might not be smart enough to solve complex problems, a shared mind might be. We might just need the computing power... or the space. Our technology might not find an easier solution to the limitations of one human brain for whatever reason. This might just be a simulation of some very complex problem that we have to solve without a high-tech solution.   3) ""Blessed are those who are weak in spirit"". Superhuman civilizations might have found that the key to happiness is... a lower IQ. So they upload themselves into a neural network, leave some technicians behind etc.  4) We have split up our neural uploads into different parts. This might just be an entertainment system and just part of our whole consciousness is actually present. This might be a ten-dimensional being's understanding of a three-dimensional existance. Or this age just might be considered ""romantic"" in the future.  Therefore, there are plenty of reasons to make it seem like a ""failed"" attempt.   EDIT: Oh yeah, and of course the 5th reason: 5) It just fits the simulation theme. Whoever built the simulation probably chose this age for certain reasons. And of course, the ""good"" and ""bad"" balance. A genius is clearly OP :P"

kurzgesagt,3bz55y,N911999,1 point,Wed Jul 8 22:12:36 2015 UTC,"True, the thing i hate about the simulation hypothesis is that it's supported by the occam's razor.  You can simulate far more than one universe with another universe. Anyhow it depends by some things that we don't know:  How many universes are there? Is is possible to engineer universes/ receate big bangs in a controlled fashion? Is the computing power of the multiverse infinite?  The two last questions are equivalent because infinite energy allows infinite computation and vice versa. If they are true then there's no difference whatsoever between a simulated reality and a natural arising universe. For sure you need a natural one to start with,  but all the rest can be artificial.  Long story short we don't know enought yet. I'm of the opinion that there's weak evidence that we are the first because we haven't been uplifted yet. If there were a superintelligent species/being that could control all spacetime he would understand that the cessation of consciousness is the worse thing that could happen to a conscious being and it would try to solve that. At least if i were a superintelligent moral entity i would, the alternative are that it's a-moral . Plausibile but i would say unlikely because to make a superintelligence you need advanced tech and scientific understanding, to do so you need a society and to do one you need empathy or something equivalent. Other options are that it doesn't exist yet or hasn't reached us yet.  Ps: don't go down the road of solipsism,  it's a bad choice trust me."

kurzgesagt,3badtv,luisvsm,5,Sun Jun 28 02:43:22 2015 UTC,"We are still finding many new antibiotics.  Initially, antibiotics were discovered based off production: we grow two bacteria beside each other, and if one kills the other, we try to figure out what compound kills the other. However, the current ""end of antibiotics"" talk is partially due to the fact that we can't find many of these anymore, because we've already found all the antibiotics that are easy to find.  With the advent of gene sequencing, it's a lot easier to search the genomes to find things that produce antibiotics. That's what my lab is doing: searching through genomes to find genes that look like antibiotics, then trying to find those antibiotics. In addition, this computational approach is a lot more efficient, as we can use technology to minimize the number of organisms that we have to search, instead of growing up every organism.  The FDA problem is that it's getting more and more difficult to get approval for FDA antibiotics. Antibiotics have to go through the entire two-step clinical approval, and if there's any adverse reaction at all (allergies, etc.), it's usually scraped. Back in the golden age of antibiotic discovery, the FDA approval process was more lax; the best example is that penicillin, if discovered today, would not pass FDA approval."
kurzgesagt,3badtv,eniteris,2,Sun Jun 28 04:41:30 2015 UTC,"Sounds like really cool work, if you don't mind me asking, what makes a gene a likely candidate to produce an antibiotic?

kurzgesagt,3badtv,eniteris,3,Sun Jun 28 08:29:16 2015 UTC,"Phage therapy is amazingly cool. I'm isolating environmental Streptomyces phages in the lab right now.  The lab I'm working in focuses on non-ribosomal peptide synthases, which form gene clusters. We've developed some in-house scripts to identify these clusters and predict their products; we also compare the products with known antibiotics through both structural and genetic homolgy.  So we mostly look for genes that are similar to known classes of antibiotics. Granted, some antibiotic resistance might still resist the new antibiotics, but you usually only need a small change in the molecule for it to be effective."
