I watched a documentary on it years later and saw how effective it was in turning lives around. They loved those kids, but with a tough love. The kids helped build the place - from the housing to the big geodesic dome that was our gathering place. They worked the farm to grow our food. They had to learn to be responsible and contribute to the community. One of the rules posted was ""If you don't work, you don't eat"" and it was enforced.  Us younger staff kids had it a lot easier of course. We'd make forts in the woods, eat corn picked right off the stalk and play in the swamp. Our school was an ""un-school"" where the teacher taught us what we chose to learn.   It was awesome!"

DrunkOrAKid,3bvdq7,cameroncac,12,Thu Jul 2 21:40:12 2015 UTC,Gonna guess kid? But I actually did this as a 21 year old the other day at work. I accidentally dialed 911 just having my hand in the same pocket as my phone. Realized after the call was already ended and then got a call a minute later asking if I was in any trouble and if I meant to call 911. I had to explain to the woman that I was just standing at work with my hands in my pockets and I didn't know how 911 got dialed in the first place. Her response indicated that this was a fairly regular occurrence so I didn't feel too bad in the end.

The first time it happened, I received a call from my local police department. They asked if I was okay because I had dialed 911 and were able to locate me and asked if I needes assistance. I said ""no, thank you though!"" And went about my business. The next few times it happened I went through the same dialogue. Eventually it would happen multiple times in a shift and they just stopped checking in on me. I can't tell whether or not I should feel thankful so we don't waste each other's time, or if I should be worried if I actually have an emergency and cannot speak that they would just think ""oh, its this asshole again."""
DrunkOrAKid,3bvdq7,TiggsMC,1 point,Fri Jul 3 05:10:51 2015 UTC,Maybe you should look at how to prevent it happening again? Is it something you're doing or maybe something about your phone that leads to these constant pocket dials?

We got back to our hotel with a mutual guy friend that we had been hanging out with and we decided to drink more and just relax. I ended up falling asleep on the bed for about 10 minutes and wake up to my friend drunkenly attempting to give a blow job to our guy friend that obviously had whiskey dick. Feeling awkward, drunk, and not knowing what to do, I decided the best way to deal with this was leave the hotel, and wander a city that I had never been to before, at night, by myself, with no phone. Being honest, most of the stuff I did on this walk is slightly fuzzy, but I ended up with a homeless persons jacket, crying on the sidewalk, and a woman named tiffy and a guy named mark helped me find my way back to the hotel."

DrunkOrAKid,3b65cu,natestate,22,Fri Jun 26 14:22:02 2015 UTC,Finally someone explains it to us
DrunkOrAKid,3b65cu,CaptainBlagbird,29,Fri Jun 26 19:44:24 2015 UTC,"Full story:  Midsummer's eve 2002, southwestern Swedish countryside.  Me and my best friend were celebrating Midsummer at the family farmhouse, right in the middle of farmland nowhere. We were picking seven different kinds of flowers (according to an old tradition, if you pick seven different flowers and put them under your pillow at Midsummer's eve you will dream of the person you will eventually marry. It might not seem very sensical, but traditions rarely are). I noticed that the nearby cattle field had a shitload of flowers, and all that seperated it from us was an electric fence. Now, in the middle of buttfuck nowhere Sweden electrical fences just consist of old wooden poles smashed into the dirt with one or two metal wires running along them connected to the electrical system of the neighbour you hate the least. The top wire was at my breast height. There was a treestump about a foot high next to it, and I figured that if I had a running start I could totally use that as a stepping off point, leap over the wire and get to those sweet looking flowers on the other side. It almost worked. As I was at the topmost height of my trajectory my foot caught the wire, so I did a 180 in the air and faceplanted into the mud (and probably cow shit, now that I think about it). As I squirmed in the dirt I, somehow managed to get the wire wedged into my crotch, and had my newly descended balls act as conductors three or four times. I screamed into the mass of shit, dirt and grass that was covering my face, and my friend entirely lost her shit. I've rarely heard anyone laugh as hard as she did right then.  Finally I managed to untangle myself. ""Are you okay,"" my friend wheezed through the laughter. ""My balls got shocked,"" I coughed, holding my groin. My friend's laughter somehow intensified. Filled with pain and indignation I punched at one of the fenceposts. The universe hadn't had it's fill of slapstick for the night, so I hit the exact point where the wire looped around the log at the exact moment that another burst of current lept through it. I shrieked and jumped back.  I don't know if it's possible to die of laughter, but right then my friend was very close to doing so. I got the fucking flowers, though."

I think it's more a case of not comprehending all the factors, not of lack of empathy. Small children aren't exactly notorious for thinking details through.   Oh, and as far as how pissed she was, she wasn't happy, but it wasn't snowing and she had also already stayed outside with my brother waiting for the bus, so it wasn't like she had only expected to be out there for 5 seconds (even if she had ONLY gone to get the mail, the driveway is quite long too). My cousin was notorious for being overdramatic (there were many reasons she was living with my family...), so everyone actually thought it was rather funny she got a taste of her own medicine. Plus, she left a toddler alone for like 5-15 minutes, results could have been a lot worse.](/spoiler)"

Each attempts to throw a knife and get it to stick in the ground near the opponent. If it's near enough that the opponent can reach it, then he/she has to reach their foot out to where the knife is while leaving their other foot in place. They then continue to do the same to you.  It sounds dumb, but it was taught at a church camp (the same that played full tackle football, had an awesome basketball court, and a legend about an owl man who wore a thong and ran around the camp. He teabagged me one night after I figured out who he was). Surprisingly fun."

DrunkOrAKid,2zz9r5,Jlpanda,10,Tue Mar 24 00:51:56 2015 UTC,"It's not a very good story in terms of me looking good but here we go. So in high school I was quite the player or at least much better then I am now and come senior year I feel madly in love with this one girl though. We dated all senior year and my life was perfect. We agreed to breakup mutually at the end of the year but it still killed me. I would fall into this pretty rough depression going into college due to that and a few other reasons, but mostly that to be honest. To make this whole issue worse was when I came home for Winter Break I saw her at a New Years party, come midnight her and her also very attractive friend grabbed my best friends and they all made out while the entire party watched, which made me a sad boy. Seeing this my first thought was let me kill my self literally with alcohol, I drank an excessive amount that I stole from the party and attempted to walk home but a friend found me on the road and picked me up. He was driving home his neighbor who lets just say isn't the bell of the ball, and gained the name Mayo over the years. So I get in and look at her and say ""make out with me"" she's says you can barely stand and I saw you throwing up on the side of the road!"" This clearly upset me because I asked her if I could at least tell her a secret and I bite her on the cheek. In the morning I apolgies and she said it wasn't a big deal but it did hurt the shit out of her, and regarding my depression things are getting streadly better, not too proud of this story but I hope it gives you all a laugh."

Standing at the top of the jungle gym by the slide, since it was tradition for the bride and groom to slide down the slide holding hands together. I was wed to my bride Jane and everyone in Mrs. Gulick's 1st grade class was in attendance and emotions were high as my best friend Jeff said ""you may kiss the bride."" I leaned in for the kiss and she wasn't havin' it!

Next goal: the iTunes store insert dramatic music here. Getting an app into the Apple store can be a wee bit ... challenging. So we'll see how that will unfold.  And to spice things up, I may or may not have a bet going on - 500 downloads by 1 April. And there is beer involved. Just saying.

Rather than get up, I decided ""Maybe I should just lie down here for a while."" I was a bit older than eight.  About a month later, my buddy pulled a similar stunt on a different hill with a different retaining wall - at least an eight-foot drop onto a little barbecue area.

It wasn't until a couple weeks later my mom informed me that I threw up into a McDonald's cup while I was pissing and then poured my vomit into the toilet. Then I rinsed out the cup in case of round 2.   And now I stick with beer or vodka. No more Fireball, that shit will kill you."

It got really late to the point where he couldn't go back to his dorms so he spent the night by my hotel (along with like 14 other people in a room for 4). My friend didn't even make it to a bed he just lied down next to the bed on the floor, 3 minutes later he threw up a lot all over the floor next to him and we just threw a towel over his head too drunk to deal with it. The next day was check out so in the morning we just moved the bed against the wall and covered up the mess. He still has no recollection of this night and still calls us dicks for just leaving him with a towel over his head/throwup"

The goal of an app is to browse while out and about not be at home. If you are at home you should use the website. The discussion then becomes which app has the most features. In this case, reddit sync with it's added support for tablets has become the best mobile app. It's simple and easy to use and it has a nice UI with the cards ""theme"" built in that you can disable altogether if it isn't your thing. Although the apps have become so similar now that it doesn't make sense so compare the two on such a critical level."
