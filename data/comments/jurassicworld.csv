jurassicworld,3dnmb5,orb360,4,Fri Jul 17 19:05:12 2015 UTC,"Maybe the raptors didn't see it that way. Maybe they saw their alpha withholding a meal from them (the guy that fell in) and nothing more. We know how packs of non-extinct animals function to a degree, but it's hard to know whats going on in the head of one of those raptors. They're stated to be very smart, but do they understand why their alpha is doing what he's doing? Or do they just reason ""oh there goes our alpha withholding food from us again"". I don't even think they were chasing him to eat him. He ran and they followed...they probably just wanted to nip him for being a greedy asshole. Of course, It could just be a plothole..."
jurassicworld,3dnmb5,Fapachuu,1 point,Sat Jul 18 00:56:33 2015 UTC,That's what my friends said... I guess that makes some sense. It still feels weird though.  I guess as long as the raptors didn't interpret it as attempt to escape it works though; There's just no way to portray that on-screen effectively.

jurassicworld,3cpg43,abledoer,6,Thu Jul 9 18:45:48 2015 UTC,"The two kids in the film were bad actors and totally unnecessary.  Boo hoo, our parents are getting a divorced.  Hey look, teen age girls.  No personality at all.  Give me Lexi from the first film any day. 2) The Irex was way smarter than he needed to be.  Really, he camouflaged himself and turned his body heat down to match the surroundings, knowing humans would enter his cage and leave the door open? 3) They had an awfully lot of people on the island with no where for them to go in case of an emergency.  What if there was a hurricane.  Where would they find shelter? 3) The flying creatures.  Their first motion is to fly to a crowd of people and stark attacking? 4) The red head running in high heels with a flare.  Really? 5) The idiots who were going to attack a fully grown Irex with stun guns.  How did that work out for you? 6) Jeeps that have been sitting in a shed for 10+ years.  Oh yea, we can get them up and running, no problem.  Don't tires go flat?  Doesn't gas turn bad? 7) and finally, that Irex.  He got shot several times, blown up by a rocket launcher, attacked by several dinosaurs, and he never seemed to slow down.  A little vunerability would have made him a little more believable.  He was like some super dinosaur.   It was a good movie, and I had enjoyed it.  My complaints are not major complaints, just ideas that seemed a little bit ""too much"""
jurassicworld,3cpg43,saucony95,1 point,Fri Jul 10 03:07:19 2015 UTC,"I think the older kid was the only bad actor of the two. He could learn a thing or two about improv. ""Oh, my emo haircut and apathy should be more than enough to please the audience and fulfill the role!"" Bah, get a clue. The younger one actually did pretty good, and he already proved himself in Iron Man 3 as far as I'm concerned."
jurassicworld,3cpg43,MrDNA86,3,Sun Jul 12 20:07:41 2015 UTC,"So many plot holes in the form of lacking emergency plans - especially considering that JW is same continuity from JP, which had exactly the same disaster scenario!   Billions of dollars invested, thousands of civilians around dozens of potentially dangerous huge animals. Yet no emergency shelters, no evacuation plan, no animal-proof armoured vehicles, no ability to take down large animals, etc. Even the mercenaries and Pratt's character went hunting 20 ton animals armed with small caliber rifles.   In the original movie, the park was still under construction, so bugs in the system and non-operational safety features were somehow understandable. However, JW had no such excuses."
jurassicworld,3cpg43,prowleri,3,Sun Jul 12 11:50:07 2015 UTC,"The biggest plot hole is definitely the fact that they could put Indominus rex to sleep (like they did that pachy at the beginning of the movie, or bull T Rex in TLW), yet they kept shooting at it with safari guns.. I mean, come on. So many plot holes... Lowery asking Claire ""where are you?!"" when he's sitting in a room with camera feeds of almost every angle of the island. Masrani not seeing Indominus since birth..I mean, she couldn't have grown that much in 6 months or a year regardless of what kind of accelerated growth genes she had added to her DNA strain.  Also I am almost positive dinosaurs, like in the first film, weren't made there, but on another island. That lab is too small for something as huge as this. Even on the poster on here, behind the raptor you see a stegosaur being flown in while the park is being made. There IS another island for sure."
jurassicworld,3cpg43,TechBro87,3,Mon Jul 13 12:04:43 2015 UTC,"Aside from the just complaining I have already read, I would add that in my opinion more of the park, and its daily activities, should've been shown. It would have been cool to see the kids spent at least a night there, so we would see the park better and then the chaos happening. Because the park was really cool. Or maybe it works because they don't say a lot so you wonder how awesome it would be."
jurassicworld,3cpg43,DoubleDD88,2,Mon Jul 13 20:52:31 2015 UTC,Why.
jurassicworld,3cpg43,coffeeblack1203,2,Thu Jul 9 19:00:17 2015 UTC,I noticed a lot of plot flaws and aspects that could have been improved.
jurassicworld,3cpg43,Snugglejitsu,2,Thu Jul 9 19:02:50 2015 UTC,"The entire underlying plot. IRex escapes because of thermal cloaking? How did it know it was being monitored thermally? How did it know the gps tracker was in its skin?    The more plausible subplot would have been: Asian science man is conducting mad science on behalf of InGen. Vincent DiNofrio and Asian science man collude to disable infrared censors thus forcing the exact same reaction from park staff.  This subplot fixes many issues with the movie.  A. Why the hell does Asian science man need human spines floating in liquid in his lab. Very macabre decorations.  B. We've already got a defense contractor trying to weaponize Raptors, it could merely be the next step because Chris Pratt was taking too long.  C. Instead of criminal incompetence costing dozens or more human lives we can blame the failures on a morally bankrupt military complex, which is more satisfying than professionals just making poor decision after poor decision.  D. Why would a Fortune 500 company NOT wanting to test weapons grade dinosaurs in a civilian rich environment put such a wildcats in a civilian rich environment. Corrupt company fabricating escape is much more plausible. Presumably the billions of dollars this company spends could have bought them an absolutely safe second island. Even Hammond had more than one island.  E. Communications failure. Instead of the no signal on phone or radio trope you have active collusion preventing responsible parties from working effectively... Instead of incompetence.   The kids were worthless McGuffins with no tangible substance or emotional connections. If the director had focused on building Pratt and park directors characters their relationship might have felt meaningful and if there was a need to generate drama in absence of the kids... Just use some errant civilians getting stuck and go have Pratt save them. The instant the first strike team failed all systems would have gone red. The fact that JurassicWorld didn't have a combat ready strike force able to neutralize any threat within minutes blows my mind. We are dealing with animals so big. Also, from a liability standpoint the park couldn't afford to let people get hurt. Even if the Rex were neutralized one civilian death could result in millions... If not billions in liability. Incompetent employees: this is fucking Costa Rica and dinosaurs, not six flags. In fact, six flags was better ran than the ""rides"" at JW with just one pimply kid managing the several hundred thousand dollar gyroballs. 20 year old jeep in tropical conditions would not have tires that worked. Any wiring, spark plugs, etc would also not be functional.   That's all I can think off now"

Jurassic World is the only movie in the franchise that is so gratuitous with the violence, and the death count seemed huge. Honestly, this one seemed darker and more mean spirited- With the British chick getting tortured by the pterodactyl's and then fucking eaten by that Dino fish, the beak going through the dude's chest in the copter, and seeing civilians getting torn up. I think this movie catered to the kids/humans that experienced the original."

jurassicworld,3c7637,chewieconcarne,4,Sun Jul 5 15:51:32 2015 UTC,"That death was so intense, a great scene. I think she would get dropped straight down the gullet into the dino's throat.

jurassicworld,3c7637,zolikk,5,Sun Jul 5 19:29:15 2015 UTC,She was given just enough characterization for her to not be a random face. It gives the death more impact. If you're going for gruesome shock effect it helps if your audience has a name to put to the face.

jurassicworld,3bbsm2,welderblyad,1 point,Sun Jun 28 03:04:08 2015 UTC,Yeah. The older bro and girlfriend thing was stupid. He was checking out other girls on the island.

jurassicworld,3bbsm2,twerkysandwich,5,Mon Jun 29 01:29:23 2015 UTC,I found this part hilarious
jurassicworld,3bbsm2,pardelkat,1 point,Sat Jun 27 21:24:51 2015 UTC,"You know what I thought was hilarious? The horrified look on Gray's face when the raptor drags that one guy out of the truck right before they start driving away. And his posture, he looks like he's trying to climb up the wall. XD"
jurassicworld,3bbsm2,MrDNA86,4,Sun Jul 12 20:22:51 2015 UTC,"When the brothers get the jerps from the first couple of movies running. Also, how they integrated some parts if the older movies in with this one. I've heard they maybe making another Jurassic triology."
jurassicworld,3bbsm2,smashley117,1 point,Sat Jun 27 23:54:32 2015 UTC,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AivH6RJPxQ  Calming the raptors.
jurassicworld,3bbsm2,kingphysics,1 point,Tue Jul 7 19:51:49 2015 UTC,The scene where you see the raptors are attacking the InGen troops through the head cameras mounted on the troops and the raptors. That was awesome!
jurassicworld,3bafs6,Khyroki,1 point,Sat Jun 27 09:05:31 2015 UTC,Indeed.
jurassicworld,3b2hqf,Sacredless,3,Thu Jun 25 13:05:47 2015 UTC,"Just a small comment, but I believe when Blue and our Rex look each other in the eyes and don't attack is because of basic instinct. The Rex has experience fighting raptors before and knows she can sustain more damage, albeit from a single raptor. The raptor has eliminated its attacker and now faces a just-as-large opponent, without any support.  It's like in any natural battle. Predators pick and choose the battles they take. If wolves are in a losing battle with Buffalo they will back off; the same goes for lions, who, if they are engaged by several buffalo from a herd, will usually back off when the herd presents persistence.   So, I believe it's instinct for them when the walk away."
jurassicworld,3b2hqf,Solenus,1 point,Thu Jun 25 22:29:40 2015 UTC,Precisely.
jurassicworld,3b229d,LuvShinyThings,8,Thu Jun 25 09:54:29 2015 UTC,"""Predators don't hunt when they're not hungry""                -hunter guy from The Lost World"
jurassicworld,3b229d,ThandiGhandi,3,Thu Jun 25 14:11:56 2015 UTC,"This, exactly. The T-Rex didn't attack the I-Rex because it was hungry, it attacked it because it saw a potential threat to its territory. The second book (which was terrible btw) goes into how territory is a big deal for dinosaurs like this- it may have been tempted by the (seemingly) easy snack that showed up near the open paddock, but the moment it saw the I-Rex it knew that it had to establish itself in the food chain, just as the I-Rex had spent the entire movie doing."
jurassicworld,3b229d,UltimaGabe,3,Sat Jun 27 23:49:12 2015 UTC,"I'd say because the T-Rex was just in a nearly fatal encounter with the I-Rex.  After that threat was no longer present, the Rex probably needed to go and nurse its wounds.  Probably figured it would let Blue handle the smaller creatures (us)."
jurassicworld,3b229d,thebestv2,3,Thu Jun 25 12:30:28 2015 UTC,"The Rex form 1 is the same Rex from 4. Shes old now...which is part of why I get that she just walks away in the end. She just had a big fight...almost died... Just doesn't feel up to fighting a raptor. Limps away because shes ""Getting too old for this shit."
jurassicworld,3b229d,thelastevergreen,2,Thu Jun 25 19:20:10 2015 UTC,"according to 2, all the dinosaurs on the original island got wiped out by a hurricane.   Unless 2 & 3 aren't considered canon anymore, which someone was trying to tell me"
jurassicworld,3b229d,donatello_vs_batman,1 point,Mon Jun 29 01:05:46 2015 UTC,Uh.... where in 2 does it state that?   Because I don't remember that happening.
jurassicworld,3b229d,thelastevergreen,0,Mon Jun 29 01:20:02 2015 UTC,just tried to verify...I guess I made it up.  For some reason I thought Hammond said that when he was talking to Malcolm.  But nevermind
jurassicworld,3b229d,donatello_vs_batman,1 point,Mon Jun 29 01:32:36 2015 UTC,"Just watched 2 yesterday, I believe what Hammond says is that the facilities the humans were using on site B got wiped out by a hurricane, but the dinosaurs were left to their own devices after that."
jurassicworld,3b229d,kneeod,2,Mon Jun 29 14:32:31 2015 UTC,"I figured she just wasn't hungry. With the park fully functioning for 10+ years, she's probably getting fed on a regular basis anyway. The only reason she attacked iRex is because the other huge predatory dinosaur was a threat to her territory. Once iRex is down, all that's left are a little raptor and a bunch of tiny humans, which pose no interest to her except as potential future snacks, so she wanders off.  Note also that she pauses for a few moments after the Mosasaurus eats iRex, as if to say, ""...It's dead, right? Definitely dead? Not coming back up? Okay, yeah, that's long enough, it's dead."""
jurassicworld,3b229d,SceptileMasterr,1 point,Sat Jun 27 07:43:03 2015 UTC,And why was the sea dinosaur in the ocean at the end?  Or am I mistaken and the body of water it ate Indominous from not the ocean?
jurassicworld,3b229d,GroovyLube,4,Thu Jun 25 14:26:28 2015 UTC,It was the same big sea world-type pool that it was in in the beginning.
jurassicworld,3b229d,coffeeblack1203,3,Thu Jun 25 16:01:11 2015 UTC,"Ah, okay.  For some reason I thought that final battle took place on the edge of the park and backed up into the ocean.  Thanks for the clarification."
jurassicworld,3b229d,GroovyLube,2,Thu Jun 25 17:41:10 2015 UTC,It's backed up against the Mosasaurus Lagoon.
jurassicworld,3b229d,thelastevergreen,2,Thu Jun 25 19:25:35 2015 UTC,So what's stopping the mosasaur from leaping out of there to eat visitors?
jurassicworld,3b229d,ajhoff83,1 point,Fri Jul 3 01:15:24 2015 UTC,There's a retaining electric fence that the I-Rex shatters through just before the Mosasaur jumps out.  Assumedly the falling fence pieces is what attracted it.
jurassicworld,3b229d,thelastevergreen,1 point,Fri Jul 3 01:38:17 2015 UTC,"I also remember that T-rex cannot see you if you are not moving, so if the humans stayed put, it wouldnt be able to see them."
jurassicworld,3b229d,flakyred,1 point,Mon Jun 29 22:52:20 2015 UTC,"My theory? She wasted too much energy in the fight. The tiny morsel-like humans wouldn't have given her enough of a return on the energy it would take to actually catch them. And the raptor, probably even less so, plus Blue helped her out, she earned a free pass."
jurassicworld,3b229d,MrDNA86,1 point,Sun Jul 12 20:26:41 2015 UTC,That it's just a movie and not real
jurassicworld,3b229d,JacksLackOfSuprise,1 point,Thu Jun 25 12:26:40 2015 UTC,Yeah. Yep.
jurassicworld,3azyt8,mrjackdoe,2,Wed Jun 24 21:27:25 2015 UTC,By far the best thing I have come across today!

jurassicworld,3awxlb,SSROCK,1 point,Wed Jun 24 04:41:27 2015 UTC,"I think the person that says that this plush appeared at the movie meant that the plush itself or something similar to it appeared at the movie. At first I thought it meant the type of dinosaur itself but no.  I'm really considering watching the movie again just to look at the background for plushies, but maybe that would be too much. Hehe, thanks for your answer :)"
jurassicworld,3awxlb,thebestv2,2,Wed Jun 24 04:48:45 2015 UTC,Definitely not in Jurassic World.  Maybe they were thinking of Jurassic Park?  http://imgur.com/mUodnIM
jurassicworld,3awxlb,thelastevergreen,2,Thu Jun 25 12:41:27 2015 UTC,Maybe in the scene where they're hiding in the merchandise hut during the I-Rex fight.
jurassicworld,3awxlb,Khyroki,2,Thu Jun 25 19:35:21 2015 UTC,Was thinking the exact same thing  But to see it you should freeze-frame it because everything goes fast when they are there
jurassicworld,3awxlb,mrw612,2,Sat Jun 27 09:08:55 2015 UTC,Yes! I searched for on online picture and found this poster. It is! I haven't gotten a better picture yet but it's exactly the colors and the size of the plush of the left side here. I was really excited when I found it. Thanks!

jurassicworld,3arj0i,ScroogeHD,1 point,Tue Jun 23 20:24:11 2015 UTC,"holy shit, see that would have been an interesting, fresh take on the annoying kid routine. and it would actually explain a lot about some of the oddities plaguing the story in its current form."

jurassicworld,3arj0i,ScroogeHD,5,Thu Jul 2 14:16:51 2015 UTC,"I think it was a throwback to JP. The kids were there because the mother was going through a divorce.   I cannot recall who, but someone says it when they arrive."
jurassicworld,3arj0i,altimax98,2,Thu Jun 25 16:58:19 2015 UTC,"It explains why the kids went to the island alone.   But also, I thought it was to reinforce the heteronormative/procreation theme of this series. ""Life will find a way."" The parents were getting divorced but at the end it seemed like they were getting back together. Just like how Owen and Claire got together. And how in JP Dr. Grant seemed to have decided to have kids with Dr. Sattler."
jurassicworld,3arj0i,initiallyperk,2,Wed Jun 24 03:39:18 2015 UTC,Although in JP3 it was shown that Grant and Sattler never did have any children.

jurassicworld,3arj0i,LiteralHeadCannon,2,Fri Jun 26 22:45:36 2015 UTC,I looked at that moment and the mother outside of the business meeting to show reasons why the parents may have not gone with them.
jurassicworld,3arj0i,CJHal,3,Tue Jun 23 02:00:34 2015 UTC,Wasn't a business meeting. That was their legal proceedings.   I'm pretty sure her husband was seated across the table.
jurassicworld,3arj0i,thelastevergreen,1 point,Tue Jun 23 10:40:03 2015 UTC,Also why did they show that the older brother had a girlfriend? Didn't seem like that added much to the plot in my opinion.
jurassicworld,3arj0i,brock_hard,1 point,Fri Jun 26 02:14:33 2015 UTC,"It didn't, but I think it was an attempt at showing that this is how a 15 year old might act.  Has a girlfriend (whom he doesn't really seem that infatuated with) so maybe he would rather stay and hang out with her then spend a week babysitting his little brother.   So then it keeps showing him checking out every girl on the island (like every 15 year old boy would be doing) etc.   It does a poor job at it, and continuously implies that he might talk to one of them and end up getting her caught up in the shenanigans but then is put down by Gray's funny staring remark.   Also, filler. I don't know. The sub-plots were weak for sure...but luckily the rest of the film's pageantry outshines all that.   Plus when I was 15, I would have been out of my fucking mind if I got to go to Jurassic World. I would've been worse than Gray was."
jurassicworld,3arj0i,__KODY__,1 point,Fri Jun 26 18:25:50 2015 UTC,"Yeah I agree, every plot needs that sort of filler but it just seems like they did a somewhat poor job of it.  And if I got to go to Jurassic World and see behind the scenes... you better believe I would make the best of it."
jurassicworld,3arj0i,brock_hard,1 point,Fri Jun 26 21:23:20 2015 UTC,"I think that was supposed to illustrate how a lot of people were desensitized to the thrill of the dinosaurs, thus them developing the Irex. But they didn't do a very good job of connecting that plot point to his character."

jurassicworld,3aqs2i,chewieconcarne,3,Mon Jun 22 23:41:02 2015 UTC,I actually thought it was cool how they used all these companies to show that Jurassic World was just ALLLLLLL the other theme-parks in the real world. Also isn't the whole movie basically making fun of theme-parks and big corporations so having all those companies showcased only cements that theme IMO. :)
jurassicworld,3aqs2i,mikus-fikus,1 point,Tue Jun 23 07:46:51 2015 UTC,"I mean, how is that any different from any other amusement park? Big name brands set up shop on and around the premise. The non-subtle product placement of major brands is probably among the most realistic elements of the film."
jurassicworld,3aqs2i,KoalaExpress,1 point,Tue Jun 23 14:00:27 2015 UTC,"You imbecile I'd you'd paid any attention to the film you'll know that it takes the piss out of product placement, with the whole Verizon sponsoring the I-Rex plot, Lowery says 'why not just let them name the dinosaur' and 'pepsisaurus' as a joke. The whole cola placement is in that typical fashion and such because it's making a joke. Think about it."

jurassicworld,3alnom,thelastevergreen,2,Sun Jun 21 19:37:08 2015 UTC,Can you give some examples?
jurassicworld,3alnom,Regular_Slinky,5,Sun Jun 21 21:13:48 2015 UTC,The gyro ball thing was number 7.   Some vehicles had 7s on them.  Under the Jurassic World Cup there was a 7 written.  The drinks cost 7 dollars.   There's probably more.
jurassicworld,3alnom,Eduardo_dcell,0,Sun Jun 21 21:42:04 2015 UTC,"The number 7 is a number important to the Illuminati and esoteric occult groups. The Qabalah book that illuminati, and New Agers always refer to as a source of esoteric knowledge features a book called ’777.’ However, more importantly, occultist and magician Aleister Crowley referenced it in a document he wrote called Liber 777 Vel Prolegoma Symbolica Ad Systemam Sceptico-Mysticae Viae Explicande, Fundamentum Hieroglyphicum Sanctissimorum Scientiae Summae. The ’777′ is important in the title of all of that, and it’s used in many magic rituals."

jurassicworld,3akbhu,TLSupremacy,2,Tue Jun 23 19:19:09 2015 UTC,That's because given the overwhelming quality superiority of the first one the T-Rex was probably a real one.

jurassicworld,3ah51y,fnaticownsall,6,Sat Jun 20 03:23:08 2015 UTC,Just got back from watching it and was a little pissed we saw so little of the park. I could of sat for 20 minutes long if they had more of the park at the begining
jurassicworld,3ah51y,G_skins31,3,Sat Jun 20 05:43:32 2015 UTC,Big time!  I felt like we didn't even get to see a fraction of what the park could've housed.
jurassicworld,3ah51y,sailboatsare,1 point,Sat Jun 20 04:11:11 2015 UTC,"Well, they wanted us to forget about the T-Rex, at least, so as to be surprised by him saving the day at the end.  Granted, I found myself hoping early on that T-Rex would show up and fuck shit up, but I did not at all expect it to happen."
jurassicworld,3ah51y,Kaibakura,1 point,Sun Jun 21 05:27:35 2015 UTC,"I don't agree. I'll compare it to others.  JP - There was 5 total dinosaurs in the movie, and up until the trex broke out, there was 0 Dino's at all, other than the sick triceratops that was shown for 5 minutes.   JPTLW - This was probably the most based on Dino's of the whole series. There's tons of free roaming Dino's, Dino babies with protective parents, there's too many Dino's to make a list. Even those little compys are in it and never are in the others. Probably the best in terms of Dino's.  JP3 - Was also really good. The pterodon in the broken cage was brilliant, the spinosaurus was also excellent, and the water scene was really good too. Lots of Dino's, and even feral raptors.  JW - there was so many different Dino's, easily had the most different species of Dino's. There was also a new category with the mosasaur, unlike any of the previous movies.   So in my rating, based on Dino's it's:  The lost world, Jurassic World, JP3, and then the first one in last."
jurassicworld,3ah51y,thelastevergreen,1 point,Sat Jun 20 05:00:37 2015 UTC,"7 in the first movie.   Rex, Raptors, Bracchiosaurs, Parasaurolophus, Dilophosaurus, Gallimimus, Triceratops.  And you see 2 of those before the Rex escapes."
jurassicworld,3agawp,Filmmaker_Dude,3,Fri Jun 19 22:24:43 2015 UTC,"I know exactly why her death was the most brutal and drawn-out. She represented the main female lead's ""flaws"" by being the corporate baby-sitter. Gennaro got similar treatment in JP as a foil to Grant's character development which Claire's mirrors throughout the movie."
jurassicworld,3agawp,grottohopper,2,Sat Jun 20 01:50:57 2015 UTC,"I get that's what they were going for, but the point the article makes is that she wasn't as developed a character as Gennaro was. In the short time we spent with him, we got a full blown character portrait and an earned story-driven death. In interviews, Colin Trevarrow said they wanted to make the first female death epic, but seemed to have forgotten to make her either A. a loathed character that deserved what she got or B. a heroine who went above and beyond for other characters and as a result, went out in a blaze of glory"
jurassicworld,3agawp,LiteralHeadCannon,1 point,Sat Jun 20 02:02:08 2015 UTC,"I'm not a big fan of TLW, but I think Zara's death more closely parallels Eddie's than Gennaro's.  My interpretation would have been a lot more effective if there'd been a scene or two of her scrambling to find the kids, though."
jurassicworld,3agawp,LiteralHeadCannon,2,Sat Jun 20 05:24:39 2015 UTC,"Right, that's why it was unsettling to some people. She's little more than a bystander. To spend so much time watching a minor character get essentially tortured for what seems like a long period of time compared to the other deaths feel tonally wrong from a story telling point of view. The screenwriter John August wrote up this piece and I feel like it sums up that scene and the uncomfortable feeling it left pretty well:  http://johnaugust.com/2015/when-do-characters-deserve-to-die  Again, my point is from a writing/story point of view. Her death seems more brutal and shocking because it wasn't ""earned"" in the context of the story."
jurassicworld,3agawp,TLSupremacy,1 point,Sat Jun 20 20:49:55 2015 UTC,"I do really think it would have been better for her to earn her death through sympathy rather than schadenfreude, though.  Deaths are more impactful the more we know about the dying character.  Deaths are less impactful the more we hate the dying character.  Making Zara mean and unpleasant so we don't feel that bad about her death is an anesthetic.  Making Zara virtuous and relatable is an intensifier, and, I think, an even more effective intensifier than any of the violent action in the scene.  EDIT: The other change I would have made to her death would be adding more reaction shots for the kids; make it more of a point in Zach and Gray's arc.

jurassicworld,3agawp,UTLS,2,Tue Jun 23 19:34:32 2015 UTC,"If you were to argue anything wrong with this film argue the reality behind humanity and their strengths. There's a park that's been open for a decent amount of time now and they have some minor amount of security on a massive island containing the deadliest known creatures to have ever existed. To boot they're fucking with their DNA to create a super apex predator.   Throughout the entire creation of the park they decided to not add more security measures than what the first park had originally? Considering the corporation behind the tourist attraction is the 8th (I think) wealthiest person/corporation or some shit in that universe, he didn't add anything more than an electrocuted fence of sorts? Not a full security response force, automated turrets, technology that fucking exists in our own world which is the same year as Jurassic world? With the best technology available to them, they couldn't contain 1 apex predator. It's so stupid just to define it as ""smart"" and all of a sudden humanity is weak as shit.   The film did bring a sense of realization. A lot of predators on Earth have developed a special trait, camouflage, enhanced smell/hearing/eye sight, etc. Yet the most dangerous creature (and highest on the food chain) to live on Earth does not have any advanced sensory or traits to assist in hunting. As humans we have nothing but our brain, literally, and yet our ancestors were able to take down fucking mammoths with nothing but sharp sticks. Deal with environmental hazards with no modern technology. BUT every single movie that comes out now depicts man as weak, fragile, and either morally wrong OR an emotional wreck. Battle LA, having soldiers break down just because an unknown force is attacking you.  Troops that have to deal with the thought of being dead in an instant due to a road side bomb. Or battleship, ""Lets honk our horn at it bcz they know wtf that means and then freak out bcz theirs is louder. Fuck it dude just fire everything out of the blue!   TL;dr I want a movie  that has the character Bolvar Fordragon in it or proper representation of armed personnel that aren't cowards. Oh and please can we not have armed civilians be able to take out an entire squad of train soldiers just because they had the surprise on them (walking dead / The governor reference). Because we all know these soldiers aren't trained against gorilla warfare tactics used today by our ""enemies"".   Edit: Just to add more to the training behind the US's military.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7zoWcPeRmQ The police are having issues in certain cities with gangs that have recruited ex-soldiers."
jurassicworld,3agawp,TLSupremacy,2,Sat Jun 20 06:03:38 2015 UTC,"I think the most horrific part of it is that with the way the mosasaurus bites on the other dinosaur shes probably still alive and whole when she gets swallowed, definitely the most gruesome death in the franchise."
jurassicworld,3agawp,widermind,2,Sat Jun 20 06:27:53 2015 UTC,"It was a horrible, violent, and gruesome way to die but I think it carries more meaning than what the article said. In the beginning of the movie, the Mosasaurus provides entertainment for our visitors. The movie audience is forced to have a mutual relationship with the animal through the awesome experience. Later when Zara dies, the movie leaves us deciding that on our own. And it rudely awakens the fact that Mosasaurus is not ""on our side""; it's  part of nature that we don't have control over. The last part of the movie however when the Mosa kills Indominus resembles the scene in the first movie where the T-Rex comes in and saves the day. It brings the audiences back to a neutral state with the Mosasaur, and acts as a second reminder to us that the we, the mosasaur, and the Indominus Rex is part of nature."

Zara’s death rankles not because she didn’t deserve to die   Zara should have died   wtf? she did nothing to deserve to die. Being minorly selfish and disinterested in kids isn't a reason within a film or outside of a film to deserve to die. She has probably shown loads of unwanted special guests around the park and this day is no different.  If they had set her up as super bitchy and then killed her then wouldn't we be complaining about how cheesy and cliche that was?  I think part of the reason this film wasn't appalling was that it just ignored a bunch of ""cinematic language"" and was slightly more nihilistic and meaningless in its events"

The Dino DNA is altered to speed up their growth, so the trex is very old at the time of Jurassic world. Notice how they had to put flares on the goats just so the Trex could find it? She's old.   She just nearly got killed by a Dino bigger than her, so no shit she's not about to go rampaging.   And for the raptor not getting attacked or anything, she's old as fuck, tired and just nearly died, and ever heard of the saying ""the enemy of my enemy is my friend?"" The raptor just saved her, she's not about to attack him.   It all was reasonable if you put thought into it."

When he comes into the control room with his men he mentions that the board of directors had a plan for this scenario. That plan, of course, is having their security team take over. As for the divorce being brought up. 1) It isn't out of the blue. When the kids parents are waving them off at the airport the father mentions something along the lines of ""So much for our last family breakfast"". Which is shortly followed by the mother snapping at him. 2) Everyone seems to think that the mention of the divorce is to make us feel more attached to the kids. I disagree. I think that the reason why it was mentioned, as well as why the older brother keeps looking at other girls, is to give a casual atmosphere. The kids have no idea that shit is kicking off as they speak. They're just sat on a monorail which, lets face it, is a rather boring activity in comparison to everything else they had done that day. But that is just my opinion. I completely  agree with the bullshit scene where the older brother decides to press on despite being told to return.

jurassicworld,3a1omw,freethecoconuts,2,Tue Jun 16 17:06:55 2015 UTC,I had a blast watching it. Great fun movie. Why sit there and dissect it? It's not a movie made to over analyze the story lines. They aren't going for the academy award here hahahaha
jurassicworld,3a1omw,SilverBell2449,1 point,Tue Jun 16 22:22:29 2015 UTC,We all know the people who love this film are in the majority and it is because they are unable to concentrate or comprehend.  That is the whole point. There are 100s if not 1000s of threads on reddit sucking this film's dick. Go be deconstructive there.   EDIT: for link
jurassicworld,3a1omw,The_LA_Baker,1 point,Fri Jun 26 12:23:43 2015 UTC,I'm not the one deconstructing the movie here! haha You just wrote a goddamn essay picking apart a movie about CGI dinosaurs for its plot lines. It's not that serious bro. If anyone is sucking the films dick it sure isn't me HAHA
jurassicworld,3a1omw,SilverBell2449,2,Fri Jun 26 22:49:08 2015 UTC,"That is not an essay, it is a short list of POIs. The point of the thread is that the film was bad. Turning off your brain is not something you should be proud of or promoting. It's just a pathetic excuse for a bad film. Enjoying it is fine, but saying it is a good movie is absurd."
jurassicworld,3a1omw,The_LA_Baker,2,Sat Jun 27 05:31:52 2015 UTC,"You know they had to use at lot of CGI. That's just what Hollywood does. It's hard to write a movie that is able to attract a wide audience, so there had to be something in there for everyone. The divorce was probably a throw back to the Jurassic Park novel, the love story was for the romantics (even though many of us didn't buy it), the female lead's underlying struggle about whether to have kids or not was eye roll worthy. BUT regardless of these plot holes and the shameless set up for the sequel it made me feel incredible. Like I was a kid and excited to be alive again. I loved it."
jurassicworld,3a1omw,Muuviestar,2,Wed Jun 17 00:44:22 2015 UTC,"I'm not committed to calling it a Jurassic Park movie honestly. It ignores or presents evidence which outright invalidates plot elements of the first three films.  It feels like a spirited remake / selective sequel. Much like how this next Terminator movie ignores the last one, or how the next Alien flic will retcon us back to the end of Aliens.   AS a spirited remake, I think it was loads of fun. I wanted a spirited remake, not as badly as I wanted an installment worthy of the original, but i did want a spirited remake.   AS an installment in the Jurassic Park line of movies as we've come to know them, you're on the money. Which sucks, but things could have been a fuck-ton worse.   I think this movie gets made a thousand times, and only maybe a hundred are actually better than this."
jurassicworld,3a1omw,AlaskanSkunkBear,2,Wed Jun 17 06:59:58 2015 UTC,"how can any sane, critically thinking person enjoy this movie through the more than valid points that OP made. yes there are dinosaurs and yes there is destruction, but those shallow factors should not be the defining characteristic for any movie, especially not a jurassic park movie.  after we went to see it, in our post movie discussion the same exact points came up. so many plot lines were started that didn't go anywhere. and for some reason we should have cared about the assistant. (besides feeling sad because a hot chick died)  and this is just from a storytelling point of view, disregarding the actual ridiculous nonsensical story elements and plot devices.  and what bothers me is not even the fact that there is a rad popcorn flick dinosaur movie, but that the jurassic park IP is held up with this garbage direction that this movie went in for the forseeable future, especially now that it made a metric shitton of money. and i don't know if i'll see it vindicated in my lifetime."
jurassicworld,3a1omw,the_walking_mad,1 point,Wed Jun 17 09:12:12 2015 UTC,"Basically, this film has so many plot holes, unanswered questions, goofs, and inconsistencies, plus scenes/dialog breaking its own rules, it is a bad movie, but a great ride.   Before I go into a long diatribe without being asked, I will state a few POIs.  There was a HUGE contradiction in the film, and I'm not sure how it was not caught before release. In the beginning of the movie, the comment is made ""We've created the largest dinosaur to ever exist"" while referring to their new super-dino. But we see that's simply not true. Super-dino-shark-alligator was obviously 2 or 3 times the size.   They said the I Rex was 50+ft tall and then they said the wall around it was 40ft tall. Huh?  Why did Claire drive down a dirt road and THEN call control? Why didn't she just call control when they thought the I Rex escapedThere were people working on the wall, why didn't Claire & Owen ask them if they had seen a giant dinosaur climb the wall they were working on? Nobody looked for dinosaur footprints and broken trees before jumping to conclusions? How did they think the I Rex escaped? It had little arms, it couldn't have climbed the wall.  Where did they put the tracker in the I Rex? How exactly did it reach to claw it out? Why was the tracker so HUGE? It looked like a giant version of one of my amps vaccuum tubes.  Why is there no evacuation procedure? Put aside the obvious dinosaur threat(they learned nothing from the first park, NOTHING) what about a gas leak, or I don't know... a HURRICANE. They should have had some sort of plan, at least for insurance's sake.   Who thinks humans would get bored with dinosaurs? Zoos operate just fine. Even if some people who had been to JW got bored of it, there are BILLIONS of people on earth and more dino obsessed kids born everyday. The film satirically presents a world where transcendent spectacle isn’t enough, and where audiences demand dinosaurs that are bigger and louder and scarier and more explosive and have more moreness, but the movie makes the fatal mistake of being those very things it is calling out. It’s bigger and louder and more violent than Jurassic Park, and it ends with a big, flaming battle royale that seeks to top JP’s climax, even though it can never hope to top that film’s craft and majesty.  When the T-rex was let out, why did Claire stand in front of the door? How did she run that fast in heels(and the T-rex run so slow)? She couldn't of used that other guy's 4-wheeler?  The I-Rex can camouflage, see infrared, and mask its own heat signature. That is retarded enough, but it doesn't use any of its abilities when they would be useful( or at all after the initial paddock scene and subsequent slaughter of underpowered retard security commanded by obtuse retard corporate moron). It also absorbs copius amounts of bullets and explosions with appearently no injury. Why make a dinosaur that can go invisible to the tourists who paid $1000s to see it? That was a significant issue in JP when the dinosaurs couldn't be seen from the jeeps.  What happened to that black guy under the log? They just left him there and took all the vehicles. ""BLUE!""  What ever happened to that divorce thing?  How and why does Pratt(former Navy man) know so much about taming dinosaurs/animals?(massive character development fail)  Why was the villain not much of a villain and so boring? Why was the ""villain"" killed off screen, yet an innocent woman we have no reason to hate and who was frantically trying to find the kids(creates empathy) is killed in the most drawn out and brutal way? He’s just a villain because we’re told he is, not because his actions are any worse than anyone else’s.  Why do they suddenly pause in the middle of an air attack and have a dramatic moment when they are in extreme mortal danger, and without any urgency at all? Especially after just witnessing previously mentioned brutal death of their babysitter.  Irrfan Khan as the billionaire behind the park, a character who has zero consistency. In one scene he explains that making a profit on the park isn’t the point, that he’s happy to spare no expense to keep John Hammond’s dream alive, and in the next scene he’s saying the Indominus can’t be killed because they spent too much money developing it.  How did they manage to make some of the CGI look worse than the original?  How did the glass ball vehicles achieve traction on any semi-slick surface? They would be sliding around everywhere. Why didn't the glass get dirty? They shouldn't have been able to see out that thing within minutes. They were obviously very vulnerable to heavy impacts since the first hit it takes cracks it. What if a triceratops rammed that thing, or a brontosaurus stepped on it? Why is there no override when the ride closes? What is to stop John Q from not going back and joyriding around the park? Why was that gate open, are we supposed to know it was the I-Rex? Why would that kid go out there(""off road, dude"")?  How exactly is Owen keeping up with the raptors on that motorcycle? They are clearly shown running through dense forest laden with fallen trees and thick shubbery.   Why is there basically no security in the park except a handful of guys, who were repeatedly told to use non-leathal weapons dispite the dinosaurs killing people? Even during the flying attack they are told to use non-leathal weapons(you hear a man speaking over a loudspeaker saying ""DO NOT FIRE LIVE AMMUNITION"")...WHAT?!  CEO who just learned to fly, pilots retrofitted combat chopper. The fact that he isn't very good at flying is some sort of joke, I guess.  Why was Pratt's .45-70 completely ineffective, and why did he keep shooting since it was doing nothing?  The most mutinous yet somehow loyal raptors. Foe, then friend, then foe, then friend, then nod and walk off like Clint Eastwood. You cannot deseat an alpha without killing or defeating it. Either Owen never was alpha, or the writers are really stupid(or think we are).   What happened to the 2nd helicopter that was flying in with armed iNGen mercs? They are shown flying to the island, a guy kills a flying dinosaur with his LMG from the back of the heli, then the heli disappears and is never seen or spoken of again. A gun ship would be useful, me thinks.  “Jurassic World” is actually a film about Blue and the Indominus Rex forming a partnership to overthrow their mammalian overlords. Blue was clearly the Alpha of the raptors. She was just going along with the be-vested primate’s attempts to “train” her while waiting for the opportune moment to strike. Indominus was the tortured anti-hero who lived in experimental isolation her entire life and vowed revenge on her captors. How did this movie not realize the best twist could’ve been to have them team up and destroy the arrogant human oppressors once and for all?  How were the jeep tires not flat? They had no spares, and the engine would not start without major work. The gas wouldn't burn, the oil in the engine would be sludge and at the bottom of the engine, ect.  Did Jimmy Buffet make it? I saw him run with his margaritas, but his ultimate fate is left open. Don't leave me hangin'!"

jurassicworld,39u2qw,SillyMedStudent,4,Sun Jun 14 19:53:53 2015 UTC,"I have no idea. I posted a similar question the other day actually. They accept that they made this dinosaur to spike interest and visitors. Were they just planning on telling the public that the dinosaur was ""classified""? Wouldn't that defeat the point of making a hybrid dinosaur?"
jurassicworld,39u2qw,ThatGuyRoss,1 point,Sun Jun 14 20:03:04 2015 UTC,"I don't think it would defeat the point. They'd show the dinosaur, it'd be bigger and scarier than ever before, everyone gets excited. They just wouldn't reveal the exact DNA.  Why Masrani isn't allowed to know what's in it is another issue."
jurassicworld,39u2qw,chuckymcgee,3,Sun Jun 14 20:54:14 2015 UTC,Masrani corp owns the park but Ingen still seems to exist and owns the genetics/dinosaurs.

""Picture that thing but smaller, undetectable, and camouflaged""..   Henry and his lab were taking advantage of the wide open request, of ""something cool"" to fulfill the military requested creation. But finally, it was because the script called for Masrani to give up asking out of shock of a perceived good argument."
jurassicworld,39u2qw,InsaneNinja,5,Sun Jun 14 22:33:11 2015 UTC,"I suppose that makes sense.  I was under the impression that Masrani had control of the entire company, given the way he spoke to the military personnel and the speech he gave about Hammond, but I suppose that was some assumption on my part.  EDIT: Looking at some of the promotional material for the movie, it does seem Masrani is in charge of the whole thing - some wiki pages cite promotional web pages that mention Masrani acquiring InGen, and the Jurassic World website has a link to Masrani Global blah blah blah."
jurassicworld,39u2qw,dakturis,2,Sun Jun 14 23:34:32 2015 UTC,"Isn't the more important question ""Why isn't anyone allowed to know what's in the hybrid?"" Knowing it contents offers no insight into its actual genetics, while not knowing is a OBVIOUS hazard. It's especially obvious, because it happened already at the first park. When cloning the Dilophosaurus, noone had any idea that it could spit, until serveral workers were blinded. Which required them to redesign the Dilopo's paddock. So yeah, they should already be familar with the dangers of unknown DNA. There are other examples of safety features that already exsisted being removed as well, and this park seems to have been built as if the events in the first movie just didn't happen."
jurassicworld,39u2qw,458MAG,1 point,Mon Jun 15 08:24:22 2015 UTC,Because it keeps him from knowing the side deal with the doctor and Ingen.  He's kept in the dark so that when the time comes they whisk him off out of harms way.  He knows its messed up but they're in the middle of a huge crisis and he doesn't have time to fix their insubordination just yet.

jurassicworld,39v7d9,firebreathingraptor,2,Mon Jun 15 02:42:27 2015 UTC,This is the second post I've seen asking for ways to view the movie illegally online. If you enjoyed the movie and support the JP/JW franchise then show your support by buying a ticket. JW didn't break the $500 mil mark or squash all the other record holders by being streamed illegally. I'm not usually a hail corporate kind of guy but I'll throw money at JP/JW until I am broke if it means we get more movies and more dinos on the big screen. If you need to make a few bucks to cover the ticket cost head over to /r/beermoney and earn the $6 you need for a matinee show in a matter of a few hours.

jurassicworld,39rsls,RagsyBoy,1 point,Mon Jun 15 16:14:55 2015 UTC,"Eh, I feel that that article is using a very liberal definition of 'easter egg'. I see them as more subtle throwbacks or references and not straight up 1:1 matching of things that are the feature of the scene. Something that's more special by knowing that it actually means something or requiring special knowledge outside of the context of the movie to realize that it is a reference.   The 'Winston's' restaurant is a prime example of it since even people who saw the original JP probably couldn't tell you that that was anything but a name they came up with, and it references someone outside the movie.  Some of the 'matching' scenes like dino busting the car/gyrosphere or the flare/T-Rex ones are more just straight up references to JP that don't add anything more. I don't think the scenes are better or more interesting because of it.  It might seem like splitting hairs to some people, but imagine I find a scene in JP where there are claw marks and compare it to the I-Rex cell as an 'easter egg'. Or find a dinosaur and show that it was in JP."

jurassicworld,39iqst,Thunder-Squid,7,Sun Jun 14 02:50:59 2015 UTC,Its honesly the way the movie wants to portray the dinosaurs. If they chose to make the raptors pack hunt it makes sense in the movie. A thing that bothered me was since the D-Rex was part T-Rex why didnt they both communicate like with the raptors. I think it was since it was more of who can dominant their territory but again its the movies portrayal.

I attribute it to a few things,   This was a very brutal death for the series. It reminds me of Eddie Car's death except it was much more drawn out and she obviously suffered a lot of trauma before being swallow and most likely suffocated in the Mosasaurus. Most of the deaths in the series are due to people's stupidity or serve as a plot device, I didn't really see a reason for her to die. (Not including the San Diego rampage in JPII) She is the first confirmed female to die in Jurassic Park. So there's that. I felt her role was going to take on a bigger part, sort of like how Claire turned a bit bad-ass in the same sense."

Anyway, I didn't have the same outcome as you. My expectations were about met.  But I went to the restroom before leaving and there was a little boy ~ 5 years old with his dad, and he was talking on and on about how AWESOME the movie was and how cool and big the dinosaurs were and how awesome the dino war at the end was. IT WAS THE BEST MOVIE EVER OH MY GOSH CAN WE SEE IT AGAIN!  And I realized that the kid was saying the same shit I was saying about Jurassic Park back when it came out. It was pretty sweet. For  kids now this is the first look in the Jurassic series and it did a great job of creating new fans. It's not for people who enjoyed the prior movies, but it has enough in it to keep us happy. Not unlike having adult jokes in kids' cartoons.  But I found most of the movie rather predictable, cheesy, and good  god whoever plays Claire probably wants a redo.

Chris Pratt is training the raptors purely for research purposes, or even for a new attraction. The film becomes quite a bit better to me.   And for the finale , I really think they could have done without the T-Rex. Say you had everything else. The raptors where helping Owen fight the I-Rex. All of them scenes can stay the same. Owen is stood on the main path, shooting at the I-Rex. I-Rex rips the last of the Raptors off his back, looks directly at Owen and starts to charge. Owen begins running towards the Mesosaurus enclosure. He then jumps over the barrier followed by the I-Rex, out comes Meso to snap him up.   Or they could have just come up with a completely different resolution. But as I said I enjoyed the movie, Chris Pratt was great."
jurassicworld,39iqst,vicarage,9,Fri Jun 12 11:02:00 2015 UTC,"And for the finale , I really think they could have done without the T-Rex.    They definitely could have, but think about why they DID keep the T-rex. Does it make it a little more ridiculous? yes absolutely. But this is the mascot of the franchise, this is first truly terrifying creature we see wreck havoc in the original film, and also the only reason some people survive at the end. This is the definition, the epitome, of Jurassic Park.   With all the throwbacks to JP throughout, we all knew the T-rex was coming (would have been nice to have it break free earlier but not meet the Indominous until the end IMO), and it had to be in spectacular fashion. We got in on screen apology for the butcher of the rex in JPIII and we got to see a brawl. It was a love letter to the fans of old. It was their way of letting us know ""hey, even though this is the new JP (JW), we respect our roots.""  The ending fight was absolutely ridiculous, I agree. But it was that way for a reason that I very much respected.   Still like your idea though - for a more realistic resolution."

It was definitely a nod to the Spino fight from three and gave us all a little bit of justice. It's not like I hated the scene or anything. I still really enjoyed the film and am looking forward to seeing it again.   Thanks, I thought they where foreshadowing that when the I-Rex wouldn't follow the boys into the water.

Apparently the kid's parents are getting divorced (but this is addressed only once for no apparent reason), apparently the older brother is so mean that the mother cries about it (though all the older brother really seems to do through most of the movie is look at girls because funny horny teens are funny (right?), and then as the movie progressing both children are reduced to comedic devices for the occasion and completely-out-of-place one-liner).   So here is Jurassic world, an amusement park. Great, that's good. And here are the raptors we're training. That's ok too. And here is this geneitcally modified dino. Fine. And Then things go wrong, and the movie goes wrong too.  The dinosaur sets a trap (doesn't make much sense but sure, we'll say it's a genius dino). The dino evades thermal detection (really doesn't make any sense at all). People go into the dino cage to... look at the claw marks? Whatever, mutant dino escapes. Pratt saves himsefl by disguising his smell. He will never use this tactic again for no apparent reason, yet the audience should be constantly surprised when the sniffing dino returns for a jump-scare.  Super-dino escapes tears out its tracking device. How? How in god's name does a dinosaur with two stub arms claw a tracking device out of itself? Maybe you put that device out of reach of stub-arms?   Not to worry, they are sending out a containment group.... armed with electric prods and electric guns that do absolutely nothing. Even if this wasn't a mutant dino, this would not work. This is stupid.  There is some military guy who wants to use raptors as weapons. Lets think about this for a minute. This is the stupidest military tactician in human history. How much does it cost to raise a raptor? feed it? train it? transport it to war zones? maintain it while there? And then, you get the most useless weapon in any environment other than really confined space. Desert warfare? Our raptor weapons are dead from the heat sir! Winter? Our raptors froze to death sir! Tigers are pretty good killers too, but armies don't use tigers because it doesn't make any sense. People have guns.   Moving on. people finally decide to use guns on the escaped dino via helicopter that crashes. For some reason, the aviary contains hundreds, or potentially thousands of carnivorous murderous dino-birds.... apparently contained within a structure that can be broken by a charking rex. Probably not a good idea to build such a shoddy containment structrue for murder birds. Of course, the murder birds immediately begin murdering. Oddly. Like, they are vengeful. The don't fly away, the head to packs of people to killing them.   But not to worry, our protaganists can have a shoe-horned kiss for no reason while people are being murdered by psycho birds all around them.  Oh, the birds are gone, never to be an issue again.  Lets go hunt this escaped dino with raptors. Chriss Pratt says no. Military guy says ""we'll do this with or without you"". Pratt says ""I quit"" and, since he's the trainer of the raptors, with the special bond, the military guys can't do anything because the raptors only respond to Pratt. Good move move on pratt's part right? ....oh wait he actually got on a motorcycle to ride through the jungle (somehow) with raptors.   Don't worry, the military jerk will be killed by an oddly vengeful and stealthy (yet quickly clumsy) raptor later on.  Oh ya, it turns out the mutant dino has raptor DNA and is now communicating with the other raptors. Remember how we used the mutant dino DNA as an insanely convoluted plot device so many times already (cuttlefish camo, frog thermal invisibility somehow)? ya... here's another one where we use it to explain traitor raptors.   Everyone with a gun will wait to fire upon the mutant dino until it is running away... for no reason.   Oh ya, I forgot about the pinball scene. Remember in jurassic park when it was a car that the dino attacked and I thought ""holy shit this is intense""? Well now it's two kids in a pinball bouncing around like idiots and I think ""this is so unbelievably cheap and stupid"". And then the kids come across the old visitors center from the first movie and I think ""wow, this is going to be sweet"" and instead the kids are mechanics somehow and get an abandoned car working.  Back to the story. The super dino and raptors make it to the visitors centre. But, the raptors are friendly again! Why? no idea! it doesn't make sense. These are just raptors that love to switch sides (almost like they know they are in a movie). And then the mutant dino kills the three remaining raptors. How do we stop this dangerous dinosaur? ""I know"" says the business lady, ""we'll release the t-rex"" (there are still thousands of people nearby but whatever). T-rex mutant battle commences. All appears lost as mutant has won and turns on the protaganists again.   But hey audience. Hey. Fuck you. That T-Rex was only faking its injury. And a that raptor was faking its injury too. Bet you didn't expect that, right audience? Ya. So the trex and raptor attack the mutant together, pushing it close to the water's edge. And its eaten by a gian gator thing.... PLOT!   And now I know what you're thinking. The mutant is dead, but now you have a raptor (with dubious, traitorious intentions) and a t-rex in front of the protaganists. Well fuck you again audience, we'll just have them.... get this.... leave. PLOT PLOT!"
jurassicworld,39iqst,CliffordFranklin,8,Fri Jun 12 10:41:21 2015 UTC,"As a Mechanic, the scene were they get a jeep that's been sitting up for 20+ years to crank simply by putting a new battery in, made me cringe hard. I was about to jump up in my seat and scream ""oh come on, that's not how it works you little shit!"" Cause after 20 years, that gas would have been so bad, the lines and carburetor would have been gummed up and incoherent mechanic rambling Anyways . . . Some of the plot points made little sense, and assume the audience is mentally retarded."
jurassicworld,39iqst,Dowarner,4,Mon Jun 15 14:42:23 2015 UTC,"I searched reddit for a comment like this.  I agree 100%.  One of the main things that bothered me was the initial scene with Pratt entering the raptor cage to save the idiot intern who fell in.  In this scene, Pratt can barely be said to control the raptors.  He does a middling job of holding them at bay, and then BARELY escapes as they finally attack.  This whole scene is completely inconsistent with everything else we see regarding the raptors later on.  Pratt announces that he is ""the Alpha"", and that they've done scent-hunting exercises with them before.  Clearly the writers thought that whole point of the scene was to establish Pratt's dominance over the raptors... yet everything in that scene establishes the opposite.    Next, let's talk a minute more about that mutant dino, the I-Rex, and its tracking device...   So somehow, this dinosaur remembers that it's been implanted with something, and remembers exactly where on it's body the implant is.  Fine.  So the implant is somewhere that the dino can bite or claw it out.  Fine.  But now we have to take the obscene, IMPOSSIBLE leap in logic:  The dino knows that the thing implanted in it is a tracking device!  I mean, this is the only possible reason it dug the device out when it did.  So not only do we have to believe that the dinosaur is intelligent, we also have to believe that it's been educated about radio waves and triangulation.  Holy crap, what a steaming load of bullshit.  Next we have to deal with the fact that the park is HUGE, yet somehow that mutant dinosaur is popping up EVERYWHERE.  It's killing herds of huge dinosaurs, while also tracking the kids wherever they go and Pratt wherever he is, and the military teams wherever they are.  How many mutant dinosaurs were there again?  Oh just one?  Huh.  Other things that bug the hell out of me, in no particular order:  The kids start a 20-year-old car.  Gasoline starts going stale after about 6 months.  Even if every other part of that car worked, 20-year-old gas isn't going to power an engine.  Whoever wrote this clearly never tried to start up a neglected lawn mower or snowblower.  Let's talk about the entire premise, by the way:  Jurassic World needs to create mutant dinosaurs... WHY?  Because normal dinosaurs are boring.  Basically, kids think of them as being as exciting as elephants...   Well, guess what, if there was only one zoo in the world that had elephants, that place would be packed, all the time, forever.... MAYBE.... MAYBE in a hundred years where there were other competing dinosaur parks out there... then MAYBE, MAYBE I could see a slight drop off in ticket sales... but still nothing justifying the creating a super-mutant.  Okay... what else?  Oh yes, let's mention the completely ineffective weapons.  Actually, let's not.  It's all too stupid for words.   No one would ever, in their wildest dreams think that they could take down a monster like that with a taser.  No security person in their right mind would agree to even try, regardless of the paycheck involved.  Then there are the cliches:  Idiot military guy-- check.  Company risking innocent lives to protect expensive investment-- check.  No recognition that a single customer death from gross negligence would cost even more than that in lawsuit/settlement fees and loss of future business-- check  Then let's talk about the water-dino that saves the day at the end.  Did no one else notice that this huge sea monster could easily have jumped into the audience during the show, killing hundreds of people?  Did no one else notice the this sea monster could have eaten a human any time it wanted if they happened to be standing at the wrong railing?  Hunting the mutant dinosaur with raptors... that was the stupidest of all.  I mean, we know that even a T-Rex was able to take out a pack of raptors.  We saw it in the original Jurassic Park.  Never mind all that though... even if the raptors had done their job and taken down the mutant... what next?  Were they just going to curl up and purr softly at Pratt's feet?   What was this plan exactly?  God... this movie was overflowing with stupid."
jurassicworld,39iqst,VonZ,3,Wed Jun 24 19:56:06 2015 UTC,All good points. Audiences should stop supporting films that so blatantly disrespect the viewer.
jurassicworld,39iqst,CliffordFranklin,3,Thu Jun 25 08:28:42 2015 UTC,Great list.  I would add to the list the fact that the kids are bone dry and pain free after diving like 50 feet into a waterfall?
jurassicworld,39iqst,teh_fizz,3,Sat Jun 13 16:53:03 2015 UTC,"Totally agree with everything you just said. I was very let down. It really makes me sad, this movie had everything going for it too."
jurassicworld,39iqst,freeloader11,9,Sat Jun 13 22:20:41 2015 UTC,"This can be seen as accurate for the most part however there are a few points to pick up on.    Chris Pratt never took a shower however it was Bryce Dallas Howard character it probably smelt as she was constantly with him.   The dinosaur didn't have stub arms and I'm pretty sure they had some massive claws on the end. It could easily reach it's back.  They managed to capture and hold a full T-Rex down in The Lost World so why is this idea of stun bullets so ridiculous?  Yes I agree on most of the raptor part but desert warfare wouldn't affect them because 65-100 million years ago Earths temperature was 20-40 degrees C. warmer so I don't think it'd bother them if it wasn't such a far fetched idea.  It was a glass dome... The only reason the pteradons didn't break it was because it was the space they grew up in and it was all they knew. It was established in the 3rd film they showed extreme aggression towards humans. Here they have a whole buffet here so why not. They were probably hangry.  Ok yes the kiss was a WTF moment but I supposed it cut out any super cheesy-ness at the end if they were to kiss then.  Pratt went because he didn't want them to kill his raptors and when they did you saw his frustration and anger.  The whole film series is about genetics so why not amp it up? I mean what else could they use to make a ""hybrid"" dinosaur? They're probably going to use other species.  Yeah okay I would have just shot the thing straight away if it was standing in front of me.  The 'pinball scene' I think showed how useless we as humans are if we were in that sort of situation against such a reckless force. The jeep fixing bit probably took a lot longer but they just got to the point showing the kids did have some uses in some situations.  Yes because the raptors trust Chris Pratt. They are intelligent creatures  The T-Rex follows the flair not anything else. It's learnt that flair means food so it's likely to follow this dominant response and follow it rather than wonder off and eat everyone.  They couldn't make the T-Rex come across like a loser again in this film they had to make it win.  We already know the raptor wouldn't attack Chris Pratt. The protagonists were all standing still and if you know Jurassic Park then the T-Rex wouldn't be able to see you if you don't move. It doesn't have anything else to do so yes. It leaves.    But you are pretty accurate in what you've said. Obviously there are mistakes as there are in any film."
jurassicworld,39iqst,NPPraxis,7,Fri Jun 12 11:36:07 2015 UTC,"i appreciate your list.  Regarding your last comment. I don't think my criticism are akin to little nit-picky mistakes like ""the bottle of beer is full now when it was half-full last scene"", but major errors central to the film, taking place from beginning to end. If you like that kind of movie, great I have no problem with that (I have watched parody shyte monster movies that I have enjoyed...) but I think that the audience experience can only be improved by improving the story. Nobody leaves a theatre and says ""I cared too much about those kids living"" it is the viewer's involvement that brings the richness of experience, and the viewer's involvement is interupted by constant nonsense! Basically, it doesn't hurt to make a movie that isn't full of overwhelming and central sillyness."
jurassicworld,39iqst,CliffordFranklin,3,Fri Jun 12 20:28:10 2015 UTC,"I completely understand what you are saying when writing this I wanted to give the film positive feedback because, now I've had time for it to sink in, in hindsight I know it wasn't all it could or should have been. The more I read other reviews or comments and think back at the film, the more I develop my opinion. I still hold my view that it was a good film but the main reasons for that are both nostalgia and the build up of time for this new film to arrive and my excitement.  This is what we got and I think we have to make do with it whether we like it or not.  But I really appreciate your comments, thank you!"
jurassicworld,39iqst,-Fighters,5,Fri Jun 12 21:03:34 2015 UTC,I was severely disappointed. The dialogue was awful. There was no tension. They kept throwing in dumb jokes at inappropriate times. The tension didn't last long enough. The movie was trying to too many things (action movie? Jump scares? Romance? Why?!). They used too many light setups and shots. It was a mess.   I honestly have not been so disappointed in a movie so much in my life. It would have been so much better if the monsters were the main characters instead of the people.
jurassicworld,39iqst,SpaceBreaker,2,Sat Jun 13 19:30:39 2015 UTC,I'm glad you could at least look at these points with a logical explanation behind them. Instead of assuming you knew exactly what the producer's intentions were.
jurassicworld,39iqst,LokiShinigami,2,Fri Jun 12 19:36:03 2015 UTC,Leaving the T-Rex alive isn't a big plot hole.  It's got a working GPS tracker and it stops killing when it's full. It doesn't see you if you don't move and it's not that bright.
jurassicworld,39iqst,metamf,3,Sun Jun 14 16:29:55 2015 UTC,"Haven't said anything about plot holes. Only saying there are an overwhelming number of cliches and silly central plot points that raise numerous and increasingly cumbersome questions.  If you want to try to answer one of the questions that arise from the silly points, that's fine. We can dream up answers for these questions, but they aren't found in the film itself. And there are a thousand others that need answering.   Also, maybe some people weren't overly bothered by the silly points and have a lower silly threshold, and that's fine. People will have different thresholds of when a plot point becomes questionable, and when too may silly points become overwhelming."
jurassicworld,39iqst,CliffordFranklin,2,Sun Jun 14 18:28:13 2015 UTC,"Thank you for this write up. The only way this movie was enjoyable was to go into mentally handicap mode and ignore the tremendous amount of story flaws. I'm surprised that a movie such as this still received a lukewarm reception. It goes to show that people buy into popcorn flicks, which is why movies like this come out and make money. The downside to this formulaic approach is we'll rarely ever see classics like JP1 and JP2 again."
jurassicworld,39iqst,freeloader11,4,Fri Jul 10 09:40:04 2015 UTC,people finally decide to use guns on the escaped dino via helicopter that crashes   Oh and another issue with this is that they use an inexperienced pilot rich man to fly the helicopter! Probably has something to do with it crashing but whatever PLOT CONTINUES!  EDIT: I found it quite believable that the business lady was able to out run a T-Rex in high heels.

I was really lazy to write something like this but you've read my mind and everything in your post is on point. 'Switching sides raptors' and 'military tactician' was probably the most cringiest of them all. And that scene when Protagonist and his 'good friend raptor' looking at each other after the T-rex mutant death: ""No problem bro. Everything for my good freind ;)  btw original JP as well as the second one aren't that realistic too but at least those movies were about amazing adventures, philosophy (that indian man imitating Goldblum was so bad) and mysterious things. But this damn movie was about Parents corny emotional stress and hard life of average mother. About 13 yrs old flirting. About retarded militarian's retarded evil plan to kill all the people in Iraq with dinos :/ sorry but I'm over it.

jurassicworld,39iqst,NFossil,2,Fri Jun 12 11:03:26 2015 UTC,"I agree. Originals aren't realistic. Realism isn't necessarily important. The problem is when bullshit removes the viewer from the movie. So a movie can be absurd, as long as the absurdities are hidden, or rare enough that they don't become so overwhelmingly evident. Sure, make the t-rex thing suddenly turn into a drop-off for an exciting cable-decent. I might miss it and not be taken out of the movie by asking ""what just happened?"". But as these issues compound endlessly, they become more and more apparent until the movie seems just silly!"
jurassicworld,39iqst,Juventin1897,1 point,Fri Jun 12 20:14:14 2015 UTC,You sound upset. But it also seems that before seeing this movie you expected a garbage plot. So my question is why even waste money on it?
jurassicworld,39iqst,LokiShinigami,3,Fri Jun 12 19:33:19 2015 UTC,"I am frustrated by the way that big movies are now. I did not expect this movie to be garbage because it was Jurassic Park and I liked the earlier ones (not JPIII though). I have basically stopped seeing blockbusters because I constantly leave the theatre feeling cheated. I guess I should extend that to all blockbusters now because they all seem to follow the same formula:  Endless cliche where everything is predictable. Convenient post-hoc plot device. Convoluted complex story with no single strand of the story sufficiently explored to make any sense at all. Shoehorned love. Constant out of place one-liners. Packed with characters I don't care about, who make choices that are entirely unrelatable (and I start hoping the dinos eat them)....  I guess I should just stop trying with summer adventure/action.... actually any big summer movie at all anymore, and wait for the rare good winter release.  edit:  People have been making stories for thousands of years. Stories that make sense. There are fantasy and gods and heroes and love and anything. Really, it is not hard at all to make a story that works. For a production budget of 100 million (or whatever) make a story that isn't stupid. People have been doing it for thousands of years. There are millions of people around today who can make a story that isn't this stupid, while retaining the action which the audience (it is presumed by execs) gushes over.   I should also note I think there is a ratio of shyte story to good. The reason why bad story gets in the way is because it takes the viewer (me, at least... and I assume at least some others in some movie) out of the experience and raises the question ""how did that raptor just transport itself?"" ""how did that t-rex come back from the dead?"" ""what happened to the murder birds?"" and even ""why did the director think it was a good choice to allow this kiss here?"" ""why did the screenwriter think these post-hoc plot explanations were acceptable?"" And these questions just detract from the richness of the film. You can have SOME shyte story, or device or whatnot. Like in the first jurassic park a power outrage leads to escape.... that's stupid. But the movie isn't over-burdened with such crap. ALSO, time is spent in the original on deepening the viewer's interest. Having a bit of character familiarity, know who you are rooting for, know why Nedry (the human villain of the first film) is sabotaging things a bit. But in current film there is no viewer-investment in the characters or story, and there is overwhelming number of events that don't make sense.  Action does not preclude story. It is not a difficult problem to fix. Fixing it would only expand the enjoyment of the movie.  (this isn't exactly a response to you, but I'm so frustrated with hollywood (I used to like movies! I used to spend SO much more on them) that I just need to vent)"

It was implied that the threat was essentially dealt with. They were picking off quite a few with rifles in just the shots we saw on screen so its not out of the question that they killed enough of them to limit the threat. They were keeping people indoors after that so its possible there were probably a few out there.   Kids are in absolute danger but meanwhile a single tear rolls down the cheek of the aunt after she watches the agony of a dinosaur, which was killed by this big Indominus. While there is a huge monster hunting people in the Park! WTF!   Her crying in this scene wasn't really about that dinosaur as much as it was her finally realizing that the dinosaurs in her park weren't just attractions, but living creatures that can suffer. The way she felt about them was touched on earlier.   No Security taking care of the area of this big ass monster? No guys with big guns watching Indominus? Only a tired and silly looking dude that said: ""Oops, he is gone."" He then gets caught and opens the door through which the mutant escapes. So only one wall between this big ass monster and the visitors? No pit, no second/third wall, no guards, no river, no nothing?   Shocking tracker and large restricted zone aside, I'll admit this was a little ridiculous. I'll attribute this to arrogance. It's the same mistake that faulted the first park.   No external control of the gyrocopter in case of emergency? No way to communicate with each gyrocopter?   Once again, I have to agree on this one. There seemed like a lot of potential flaws with that ride.   At the end people staying in a big room next to the harbour, while a huge T-Rex is on the run (maybe it disappeard as well). The T-Rex is shown as a solution but is itself somewhat dangerous I guess. Obviously not.   We see the T-rex roaring at the end, but that doesn't mean it was in the best shape. She got absolutely thrashed by by the I-rex and would still be recovering. They certainly would have overkill security at that point and she would be unlikely to attack in that state anyway.   The only threat comes from the big mutant.. what about all the other dinosaurs on the island. The characters don't have to deal with them? Only the Velociraptors, Indominus and the Pterodactyles? Other dinosaurs are also living in the park...   The grid never went down like in the first film. All the other potentially dangerous dinosaurs would most likely be safely contained in their enclosures.   Velociraptors are friends and communicate (wink?) with the alpha human. Also they are attacking a way bigger animal to save the human. Really?   A stretch yes, but they are implied to be highly intelligent and they are pack animals. There have been cases of people being protected by their dogs from much larger animals so it's not completely out of the question just extremely unlikely since they aren't domesticated like dogs.   She waits for the T-Rex to approach and runs on high heels 200 m or so (of course doesn't get caught) only to be stuck in a big fight between T-Rex and Indominus and Velociraptors.   I noticed this too but kind of just let it slide. Sometimes you just have to accept the little things in a movie.  That's about all I have time address right now. Like any movie, it had some flaws, but it wasn't riddled with them. I thoroughly enjoyed it. It was definitely better than any of the other sequels."

jurassicworld,39l5bg,tyrano421,8,Fri Jun 12 14:23:52 2015 UTC,"I thought the first 2/3s were pretty damn good. My biggest gripe was when the dinosaurs started teaming up together. The head nods between each other, etc. were ridiculous."
jurassicworld,39l5bg,PapaDontPreech,0,Sat Jun 13 04:33:04 2015 UTC,"Did you imagine head nods?  I don't remember seeing any and I'm asking because if you got a team up vibe maybe your mind is filling in details to reinforce the idea.  But I only saw the movie once and I could be wrong, too."
jurassicworld,39l5bg,VM1138,0,Sun Jun 14 18:52:27 2015 UTC,Maybe a physical head nod didn't happen...but just the looks between blue and the t-rex/blue and Owen were extremely cheesy. The dinosaurs lost a lot of their animalistic characteristics that were so strong in the original. I still enjoyed it though for the most part.
jurassicworld,39l5bg,PapaDontPreech,7,Mon Jun 15 01:41:33 2015 UTC,"I remember being young and watching the first three. It was about the dinosaurs and less about the plot or extras. But you need the extras to create something for the ""hard to please"" type people. If you were disappointed then go back to your soap opera dramas with the lack of humor or creativity. Leave the movie to those who are about imagining life with dinosaurs, after all, those people are the reason this film was made. TL:DR If you watched the movie to see dinosaurs, it was a success."
jurassicworld,39l5bg,Tri-T,3,Sat Jun 13 08:34:40 2015 UTC,I enjoyed it but it definitely was nowhere close to the original.  This one had absolutely ZERO character development.
jurassicworld,39l5bg,LsDmT,5,Fri Jun 12 14:41:31 2015 UTC,"I completely agree with you. I really wanted to enjoy this movie... but it was just so completely stupid. The characters were hollow shells, with neither development nor growth. Maybe they should have hired some writers. How about foreshadowing… or establishing that a character has a skill before that skill is needed? I-Rex needs invisibility, done. Child needs to know automotive repair skills, better upload that from the matrix directly into his brain.  The drama was slapped on. The relationships were unbelievable. The action was good... but action without invest in the characters is basically porn. Every decision in the movie was senseless, and the animals all attacked like monsters with murder lust. How the fuck is everyone less prepared than they were for the initial park? How is there partial cell phone service? This is not a big island, and it is in the middle of the ocean, either it has its own cell towers, or doesn’t…  In no way would a raptor have military uses... They cost millions/billions to produce, are uncontrollable, and offer no advantage over a k-9 unit. Why would the I-Rex's DNA be so secret that none of the employees have any idea what its super powers are? Wouldn't like... almost everything be confidential? Wouldn't EVERY employee have to sign a non-disclosure? How does knowing that it's half rex, half frog, half cuttlefish, half raptor, half man, half pig, and half bear offered ANY insight into the actual structure of its DNA? Obvious safety issues vs. protecting the vaguest of trade secrets? From people already trusted with highly sensitive information... And then for some unknown reason they raised this thing without any assistance from an animal handler. They tell us in one scene that the mutant has no social skills from being raised in isolation... then show it communicating and converting the raptors in a later scene.  This was just pandering garbage, meant to sell nostalgia... and it makes me sick that movies like this are commercially successful. I had some hope when I found out that Michael Bay wasn’t going to be the director… but we had 2/4 dead raptors explode… so shrugs what does it matter?"

Theres also a dino in the Lost World book that has camo ability. I think the raptors have always been protective and close as a pack.

jurassicworld,2ofzth,shittier_unidan,1 point,Mon Feb 2 21:44:53 2015 UTC,Not sure. Just thought about it when the original trailer was released a month or two ago.
jurassicworld,2of9h5,SIESTA_FIESTA,2,Sat Dec 6 02:07:23 2014 UTC,Cage? What cage? It's a lake.
jurassicworld,2of9h5,330ml,2,Thu Dec 25 15:02:18 2014 UTC,Maybe they built a mini hoover damn with a huge concrete wall?
jurassicworld,2of9h5,shittier_unidan,-1,Tue Dec 16 00:14:22 2014 UTC,My thoughts. It was a nateral lake but they built a wall around it. Drained it and dug it very deep. Then released the megaladon when it was just a baby
jurassicworld,2of9h5,clumsybassdropper,8,Thu Dec 11 05:41:10 2014 UTC,"There isn't a Megalodon in this film. Megalodon is a giant extinct shark, the animal in the trailer is a Mosasaur. Also Mosasaurs aren't marine dinosaurs, just marine reptiles."
jurassicworld,2o07zr,zr7s,2,Tue Dec 2 02:37:28 2014 UTC,"If you have read the original Jurassic Park book then you might remember when Henry Wu was remembering creating the dinosaurs.  He wanted to make them behaviorally modified so that nothing could go wrong (basically they would be living robots).  John Hammond wanted them to be as generic as can be and they straight up brought the real deal to life.  Henry Wu is the only returning character from the original movie, so maybe we will get a little light shed on this subject in the film version.  I think that they have made ""trainable"" raptors by going with Henry Wu's original plan this time around.  Let me know what you think."
jurassicworld,2o07zr,dmaul1998,2,Tue Dec 2 03:49:22 2014 UTC,"It's really not hard to believe that they're trained. Falcons are raptors too, and falconers have been around for ages. Hammond said when the raptor hatched in the first movie that they ""imprint on the first living creature they come into contact with"". If Pratt's character is a raptor behaviorist, I can easily see how he may have snagged a couple of eggs and raised them himself."
jurassicworld,2o07zr,RANKINFullStop,1 point,Tue Dec 2 16:39:48 2014 UTC,"Its gonna be theory two, Owen has trained them and the final show down will end up being the raptors vs. The hybrid Dinosaurs(s)"
jurassicworld,2o07zr,axerman3,1 point,Mon Dec 8 05:48:02 2014 UTC,Like Danaerys  Targaryen.
jurassicworld,2o07zr,Frankengregor,0,Tue Dec 2 03:38:51 2014 UTC,I love OPs Theory 1. That would be such a kool scene if that were the reason behind why they were all escaping in the same direction. :)
jurassicworld,2o07zr,mikus-fikus,0,Fri Feb 6 13:38:14 2015 UTC,My impression (based on all the information I've seen) is that they are running with him.  My thought is that its sort of like running with a pack of really intelligent wolves.  I mean... they aren't going to kill you right now... and perhaps if you demonstrate that you are dominant they will even work with you... but just don't be shocked if they decide that they would like to be the pack leader instead.
jurassicworld,2nyah9,dmaul1998,5,Mon Dec 1 16:41:56 2014 UTC,Also it's implied in the 3rd movie when they first encounter the spinosaurus. Grant mentions it not being on the list which makes him wonder what else Ingen was up to on the island.
jurassicworld,2nyah9,shittier_unidan,2,Tue Dec 2 22:18:53 2014 UTC,"yeah thats a really good point actually, but InGen isn't confirmed for the movie but it is rumored to be."
jurassicworld,2nwa22,JaysianPersuasion,6,Mon Dec 1 01:33:06 2014 UTC,"I agree with most of what you said, but the thing about the JP franchise is that it has been sci-fi while still being realistic, which I always thought was really cool."
jurassicworld,2nwa22,dmaul1998,2,Mon Dec 1 16:43:45 2014 UTC,"My take on it is, we've already seen the ""realistic"" Jurassic Park and it's the best one as well as being a classic. I'm ready for trained raptors and a genetically modified superbadassasaur!"
jurassicworld,2nwa22,Emalezable,2,Tue Dec 16 15:10:32 2014 UTC,"Crichton set a certain bar with the level of research and authenticity that he put into the first story. Since then, it's just kind of been ""cloning is cool"" in the remaining stories and not actually using plausible scientific information in the story. People are going to bitch about it. At this point though, I don't really give a fuck so long as there isn't a scene with a 80 lbs. teenage girl kicking a raptor out of a window."
jurassicworld,2nh1yn,Tom_QJ,1 point,Wed Nov 26 12:44:30 2014 UTC,"There is still a lot of post production to be done.  The doors were the only thing that stood out to me as bad.  Otherwise I thought it was all right.  For the amount of work that goes into 3D and vis effects, they are doing a great job."
jurassicworld,2nh1yn,MasterDeBaitor,-1,Wed Nov 26 19:07:15 2014 UTC,"yeah the doors for sure looked odd, but i also thought the gallimimus scene looked a little off with the lighting and a couple of the other scenes. I did notice that this isn't noticeable on a smaller screen but when watching it at 1080P these visuals where more noticeable."
jurassicworld,2nh1yn,MasterDeBaitor,2,Wed Nov 26 19:35:04 2014 UTC,Yea they still have a lot of time to work on it.
jurassicworld,2nh1yn,CheesyGorillaFingers,1 point,Wed Nov 26 20:05:41 2014 UTC,Colin stated that they used cgi for the gate just for the trailer. In the film it'll be a real gate with a lot more solid objects throughout the film. Someone in this sub had a discussion close to this a while ago and it was said that typically the trailers are rushed and not polished like the final version of the movie will be. I hope that's the case because honestly I'm a little tired of the heavy cgi use in every movie these days.
jurassicworld,2nh1yn,Sky-Walker,1 point,Sun Jan 4 21:33:47 2015 UTC,I wouldn't judge the special effects in this movie by trailer standards - that remains to be seen.
jurassicworld,2n7s0c,xam3l,1 point,Mon Nov 24 00:45:43 2014 UTC,Really shows you how little of the story has been revealed.  Can't wait to see the movie!
jurassicworld,2n7s0c,tyb323,1 point,Mon Nov 24 21:44:53 2014 UTC,Awesome ! Do the full trailer pleaseee !!!
jurassicworld,2mlms8,vineezus,1 point,Mon Nov 17 21:52:46 2014 UTC,Uhh.. Please tell me how to do this.
