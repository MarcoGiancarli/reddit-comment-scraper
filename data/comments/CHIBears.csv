CHIBears,3e1qg4,Aeterna_LIbertatis,23,Tue Jul 21 07:48:19 2015 UTC,"I was the photographer on this story. I posted because I was so struck at the difference I saw in Jay. He wasn't sad or dour, but genuinely happy to be working with the kids. This was a fundraiser, and it wasn't cheap to get in. One kid was diabetic and his family weren't ""Vandy alum"" and couldn't afford a ticket. Not only did the kid get in free, but Jay spent the most time with him. He remembered us local media guys from his college days, and greeted my boss with the same ""Marion!"" that everyone else does. I came away from this event more convinced that Jay is not portrayed or treated fairly by ESPN/big sports media.   Also: Among items at the silent auction were a few pieces signed by Kyle Long, because Kyle Long is a fucking BOSS."
CHIBears,3e1qg4,Angry_Caveman_Lawyer,11,Tue Jul 21 16:14:59 2015 UTC,"I love it when I read stuff like this about Cutler.  I think he's a great dude, I just wish we'd get more Ws during the season.  But at the end of the day, he's making a real difference in these kids' lives, and that's worthy of respect, no matter what people think of the man on the field."

CHIBears,3e1qg4,tyhopkin,2,Tue Jul 21 18:12:34 2015 UTC,Awesome! How'd you get access? I'm a professional photographer (mostly weddings and some editorial/lifestyle) and recently photographed Russell Wilson's camp at NIU and that was just a random craigslist ad.
CHIBears,3e1qg4,ramblin34,3,Tue Jul 21 18:32:58 2015 UTC,"Kind of off topic, but does anybody else think Jay is somewhat of an introvert?  A lot time introverts come off as don't care, pouty looking at times, aren't necessarily vocal (i.e. lack of perceived leadership by the media), emotionless at times, etc.  I say this because I had people who came to know me over time describe similar things about me until they got to know me."
CHIBears,3e1qg4,tyhopkin,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:33:50 2015 UTC,"I go to Nashville quite often as my best friend lives there and I am in love with the city. We frequent the Vandy area and I can tell you without a doubt they love Jay downt here. But they will tell you he's just a really closed off, introverted kinda guy who gets freaked out when people bother him.  Not everyone can love the spotlight. He's naturally just isn't comfortable with the fame. I don't mind that- I find it real.  Like when he visited all those kids on Christmas Eve at the terminally ill ward at a childrens hospital. The media got hold of the story after and he pretty much told them to fuck off lol. He does it because he's a legit good guy."
CHIBears,3e1qg4,Sks44,12,Tue Jul 21 23:08:13 2015 UTC,"Regardless of someone's opinion of Cutler, the fact that he has been able to be a starting NFL QB for as long as he has while dealing with Type 1 is pretty amazing.  I knew a couple kids when I was younger who had Type 1 and it was scary how easily and quickly things could go south if they didn't take care of themselves properly.  I just can't imagine what it takes to do that and be an athlete at his level."
CHIBears,3e1qg4,tyhopkin,14,Tue Jul 21 15:35:46 2015 UTC,"I'll always be a fan of John Madden but I loved when he defended Cutler and brought up the type 1 Diabetes reality. None of those commentators who bitch about Jay's demeanor seem to acknowledge it. Madden had some family with it and knew it can be a bastard, especially in a high pressure athletic environment."
CHIBears,3e1qg4,Roadfly,3,Tue Jul 21 16:33:39 2015 UTC,Yep and his commentary on it seemed to come out of nowhere like he was fed up with the BS you typically hear about Cutler and had to get something off of his chest.  You could tell it wasn't just some PR diatribe.

They're almost never on the same channel as the Colts.   I used to live where I got both Indy and Ft Wayne; the Ft Wayne stations would show Bears games. Thgen I moved a mile south and lost Ft Wayne. Recently I somehow started getting South Bend stations, which is more a Bears market than a Colts market, so I'll have games again this year.   Those stations don't come in HD, but they're better than watching a choppy feed.   Pretty much any station in northern Indiana that he can get on antennae should have Bears games."

What I ended up doing is purchasing a SlingBox and giving it to a friend back home (in Wisconsin).  He hooked it up to his TV, and now I can stream any channel over the internet in full HD.  I just have a PC hooked up to my TV and stream it from there.  It works perfectly!  If I remember correctly, the SlingBox was about $350 4 years ago, I'm not sure how much it is now.  But it's a one-time purchase, and now I get to watch every game as if it was on local television.  Hope that helps.  Good luck finding a solution!"

CHIBears,3dzu6x,enjoycapitalism,55,Mon Jul 20 21:34:22 2015 UTC,This is a false dichotomy.  It's not that he's the best since Sid Luckman.  It's that he was the best of what was available. Taking a monster cap hit by cutting him and downgrading at the QB position would have been an exceptionally stupid thing to do.
CHIBears,3dzu6x,RogueEyebrow,15,Mon Jul 20 23:32:40 2015 UTC,Yet many meatballs demanded it
CHIBears,3dzu6x,timebomb13,22,Tue Jul 21 00:24:33 2015 UTC,"True, but...  Having a certain opinion with logical reason doesn't make you a meatball.  Having an opinion for a stupid reason makes you a meatball.  If someone can intellectually spell out why they thought we should cut Cutler, does that really make them a meatball?"
CHIBears,3dzu6x,DrunkWisconsinite,7,Tue Jul 21 00:30:03 2015 UTC,No but I think you'd have a hard time doing that in the current QB market.
CHIBears,3dzu6x,DrunkWisconsinite,10,Tue Jul 21 00:35:38 2015 UTC,"I somewhat sided with the rebuild mentality some had.

Also, I never get the whole ""best of what's around argument"" as justification to settle. So what if he is? We haven't honestly been a championship worthy team in years. In order to get a good qb you have to try. You can't just lie contempt."
CHIBears,3dzu6x,RogueEyebrow,3,Tue Jul 21 03:08:04 2015 UTC,"In order to ""settle"" there first has to be better options available.   There weren't."

Even if they did want to pursue someone like Mariota, they would have had to pay a ridiculous amount of picks to move up in order to draft him.  It's cost-prohibitive."
CHIBears,3dzu6x,GodIsTheSun,0,Tue Jul 21 14:30:56 2015 UTC,"Doesn't matter. It's not a wasted cost to pursue new rookie qbs if you've established that the one you have won't take you where you want to go. There are only so many incoming new qbs to the NFL each year. If you're not playing the game, you're losing."
CHIBears,3dzu6x,toby224,3,Tue Jul 21 15:25:03 2015 UTC,Sorry. You don't have to get rid of cutler to search for better options. You search for better options and if you find one then you get rid of cutler. That is what the new GM did. Cutler is our best option to win this year. If there is a better option at QB next year we go in a different direction. But for now we need to put the best team on the field.
CHIBears,3dzu6x,DrunkWisconsinite,0,Tue Jul 21 15:49:18 2015 UTC,I think the only way it's palatable last season is if it's a good crop of QBs and the BPA is a QB when our number is up.
CHIBears,3dzu6x,sledge07,4,Tue Jul 21 01:09:37 2015 UTC,"At the time though, lots of people did think Mariota could go to Chicago at 7.   Many people outside of Chicago mocked Mariota to us."
CHIBears,3dzu6x,DrunkWisconsinite,4,Tue Jul 21 01:12:26 2015 UTC,"And if we had picked Marioto, in the words of the commish, We'd be in no better shape at the end of this season"
CHIBears,3dzu6x,RogueEyebrow,9,Tue Jul 21 01:41:12 2015 UTC,"Yes, we would. We would have someone who could develop into a good QB. Jay may be gone at the end of the year. I'd call having a top 10 pick at QB better than having who ever will be behind Cutler.  Even with Jay, at the end of 2015 we would still be ""better off"" with Mariota.   We know what Jay is. There is no more mystery."
CHIBears,3dzu6x,Crathsor,4,Tue Jul 21 02:09:25 2015 UTC,You are forgetting that we would have had to pay a king's  ransom to move up to draft him.  Mariota is certainly no sure thing.
CHIBears,3dzu6x,sledge07,3,Tue Jul 21 11:09:40 2015 UTC,"Here's the thing:  when we traded for Jay Cutler, he was a top 10 QB.  Seriously!  Take every active QB in the NFL right now, then sort them by their passer rating after their first three years.  Jay Cutler, number 10.  Obviously he has fallen from those heights, but the point here is that if you bring in a QB, even a good one, into a situation with bad lines, bad defenses, or both, it's not likely to end well.  No one player is a solution to a team's problems.  At best, you can have a guy who will carry you if you set him up to succeed.  Which is something the Bears have not done well with their QBs."
CHIBears,3dzu6x,Holy_City,2,Tue Jul 21 02:22:18 2015 UTC,"I was not impressed at all with him at the chpionship game, and I'm not a fan of Winston either. The cat from Ohio state was a way better QB than either of them. My problem with Mariota is, we do not play that fast paced style of offense that they have in Oregon and our team is not geared for that style of play. We'd have to add soany weapons to make it work."
CHIBears,3dzu6x,DaFire97,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:17:56 2015 UTC,Who would pick up Cutler and his contract? I feel like if the Bears tried to trade Cutler we would end up retaining salary or getting hosed in the deal.

CHIBears,3dzu6x,sledge07,0,Tue Jul 21 12:34:01 2015 UTC,Are you serious? Bro Mariota is such a good QB and poised to excell at the NFL level. I would take that over Jays double digit interceptions anyday!!
CHIBears,3dzu6x,Dr_Shakalu22,5,Tue Jul 21 12:33:38 2015 UTC,"Poised. That's the problem. He isn't proven yet. Guess who else was poised to be a great NFL QB and didn't succeed? Oh wait, too many to name."
CHIBears,3dzu6x,Formidable__Opponent,3,Tue Jul 21 12:40:13 2015 UTC,"I agree. He's just the best in recent memory. Erik Kramer was probably the last solid Bears QB before Jay, we just had some decent game managers in there like Jim Miller and Kyle Orton."
CHIBears,3dzu6x,RogueEyebrow,3,Tue Jul 21 04:52:19 2015 UTC,Are you saying he is not the best QB we have had since Luckman?

Your record may not show it due to a shaky at best defense, but I got the over for $50 on 6.5 wins.  If all of us in the division could just team up and fuck the Packers so they go 2-4 in the division, it really could be a toss up by the end of the season for the division"
CHIBears,3dzu6x,Doug_McDermott,9,Tue Jul 21 01:14:59 2015 UTC,"I agree with you. I can see 7 to 8 wins. It's not like this team isn't talented, at least on offense. And the d has potential. After we had the second best scoring offense two years ago, I really thought we would get over the hump if Tucker could put together a middle of the pack unit.  In retrospect, I think Aaron Kromer and Marc Trestman are responsible Jays poor play. They completely played into his weakness and the anemic play calling was the shit icing on the shit cake."
CHIBears,3dzu6x,sulandra,3,Tue Jul 21 02:49:02 2015 UTC,"I like your defensive and offensive FA pickups honestly.  A bunch of solid guys (vets and guys who didnt sign second contracts) who can bridge the gap while re-tooling the team.  Kromer and Trestman were garbage.  Jay knew who was talking shit before it broke to the media, and Trestman decided  to stick with Kromer and try to prove a point that anyone but Cutty could run a Trestman offense and put Clausen out there once he knew he was canned to secure an OC job after his firing."
CHIBears,3dzu6x,RogueEyebrow,14,Tue Jul 21 03:05:39 2015 UTC,"Half of the fans I come in contact with do not even fully grasp the concept of the salary cap lol. Cutler's front-loaded contract was pretty smart, and i think Jay is terrible. The only real regret I have with regards to Jay was ever trading for him in the first place."
CHIBears,3dzu6x,sulandra,7,Tue Jul 21 01:25:45 2015 UTC,"Well said.  No sane Bears fan who is unhappy w/ Cutler is saying to just cut him.  The argument in this thread about that is a bunch of nonsense.  No one is saying cut the guy.  While I regret trading for him in the first place, Phil Emery re-upped with the guy instead of franchise tagging him.  That was the real mistake.  The fact that he's now on his 3rd contract w/ the Bears is really amazing to me.  It just shows systemic failure at Halas Hall."

CHIBears,3dzu6x,sulandra,-1,Tue Jul 21 12:59:09 2015 UTC,And there are plenty of people saying Jay Cutler's contract is no big deal.  It's horrendously bad.  Repeatedly cited as one of the worst contracts in the NFL.  The people who defend that contract are equally delusional.
CHIBears,3dzu6x,Trust_One,0,Tue Jul 21 13:53:19 2015 UTC,"How is it ""horrendously bad""?  /u/joliet_jake_blues is right: He's the 9th highest paid QB based on average annual salary, and that ranking will only drop lower as the next set of QBs get paid.   Almost all of his guaranteed cash was front loaded, so we can walk away from him after 2016 with only a $2 million cap hit."
CHIBears,3dzu6x,RogueEyebrow,0,Tue Jul 21 14:28:27 2015 UTC,"That's a rather shoddy analysis/opinion.  The front loaded nature of the payments are a detriment to the contract, not a value, because it creates dead money and prevents the Bears from ever cutting him.  Also, it's been explained numerous times why it is a below par contract relative to his peers due to the guarantees being superior to anything other QBs see at that payscale vs. performance level."
CHIBears,3dzu6x,sulandra,3,Tue Jul 21 14:43:16 2015 UTC,"The front loaded nature of the payments are a detriment to the contract, not a value, because it creates dead money and prevents the Bears from ever cutting him   Uh, no. It allows a small amount of dead money after a short amount of years. We can cut him for $2 million next year. That's completely fine. We had a 2 year window to compete with him, and now we can shed his contract with very little penalty. You're creating an issue where there is none because you don't like Cutler."
CHIBears,3dzu6x,Joliet_Jake_Blues,3,Tue Jul 21 16:29:07 2015 UTC,"I just finished saying the Bears can cut him after the third year in his contract with only a $2 million cap hit, but you're still talking about how they can't ever cut him?  Seriously?  That dead money you talk about is almost entirely gone after the third year, even after the front-loaded guaranteed payments kick in at the beginning of each season.  Yes, the Bears are handcuffed to Cutler for three years.  No, that isn't the straight jacket you are making it out to be.   Kyle Orton and Mark Freaking Sanchez weren't even remote side-grade options, much less an upgrade.  You made a good point about the Defense having to play from behind because the Offense couldn't move the ball last year, but the Defense was still horrible outside of that vacuum, and you ignore the numerous injuries on the OLine & WRs.   You are also wrong to say that Cutler didn't produce anything but meandering underperformances with quality Defenses.  Last I checked, they were in the NFCC in 2010, and were easily en-route to the playoffs again in 2011 before he broke his thumb."
CHIBears,3dzu6x,theswigz,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:43:32 2015 UTC,"That dead money you talk about is almost entirely gone after the third year, even after the front-loaded guaranteed payments kick in at the beginning of each season. Yes, the Bears are handcuffed to Cutler for three years. No, that isn't the straight jacket you are making it out to be.   I think it absolutely is and that's the way most people characterize it outside of this tiny circle of /r/chibears fanatics.  3 years is a life time in the NFL, that's the average length of an NFL career.  Who would ever lock into 3 years of guaranteed payments with a guy who has suspect decision making, up/down performance and some injury history.  It's crazy.  The only thing this contract is good for is tanking right now while the team rebuilds.   Kyle Orton and Mark Freaking Sanchez weren't even remote side-grade options, much less an upgrade.   I'd take Kyle Orton and $5 M payments + the rest spent on defense/other position players vs. a Jay Cutler and his contract in a heartbeat.  Without any hesitation, I would do that in an instant.   Last I checked, they were in the NFCC in 2010, and were easily en-route to the playoffs again in 2011 before he broke his thumb.   Funny.  They had a championship level defense that year and Cutler was like 5-6% of the total salary of the team.  Now he's 13%.  It's like you want to bestow upon this guy all the positives and completely ignore the cost of what this team has given up for him and then give him a pass when they bet hard on him and his skills in 2014 (which did not produce).  He gets a free pass on the contract ""because that's what QBs cost,"" but gets all the benefit of the doubt when it was the defense that carried the load in '10.  What an impartial analysis.  Not."
CHIBears,3dzu6x,black-ra1n54,4,Tue Jul 21 17:21:16 2015 UTC,"After the offseason signings, Cutler isn't overpaid at all.  Look at what the Dolphins and Panthers paid their QBs.  IIRC, Cutler is the 9th highest paid QB and a lot of the guys behind him are due, coming up on new contracts that will likely pay them more than Cutler."
CHIBears,3dzu6x,tillman33,2,Tue Jul 21 08:38:12 2015 UTC,I just wish the Bears would have franchised him last season instead of giving him a significant contract.  That's pretty much it.

CHIBears,3dzu6x,juicyja,5,Tue Jul 21 02:42:51 2015 UTC,"True. Yet, of all the other qbs in his pay scale who also played horribly last season, you don't see any of their fans going insane and readily awaiting to burn the city down if they don't move the QB. My biggest issue is that everybody wants to blame Cutler only for the failures of the team. Nobody seems to remember that there are 21 other people and a coaching staff as well. I'm thinking having somebody in there who is proven to do good with talent (Fox) will help show what Jay really has. I do agree though that if he can't produce under somebody like Fox with a better team around him, its time to go."

CHIBears,3dzu6x,sledge07,0,Tue Jul 21 03:18:55 2015 UTC,"See guys, these people should be the ones being labeled meatballs, not the realistic ones who want to rebuild without a mediocre QB at the helm. Jay wont be on another championship team unless he can recruit 5 more hall of famers to carry him like in 2011.   Edit: Conference championship that is. Not even 5 hall of famers could get him to a superbowl..."
CHIBears,3dzu6x,theNightblade,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:36:21 2015 UTC,"Tearing his MCL in 2010 has something to do with that loss, don't you think?  If Caleb Freakin' Hanie can almost pull off the win, Cutler would have had a good chance.    Can you please stop overexaggerating about ""these 5 hall of famers"" ?  Only Peppers and Urlacher are realistically going to make it in. While the Bears had awesome Defenses under Lovie, you are forgetting that the Cutler-lead Offense was averaging 22.6 PPG while he was playing (after adjusting for D/ST scores) in 2011, and 28 PPG during their 5-game win-streak before he broke his thumb.  That was with the worst OLine this franchise has probably ever seen, and one of the worst WR corps, ever."
CHIBears,3dzu6x,bigtimetimmyjim22,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:13:19 2015 UTC,"Yup. Picking up a unproven QB who plays in a totally different fucikng style of offense is the key. The thing is, we are stuck with Jay whether any of you like it or not. It would absolutely kill the team to get rid of him right now financially. So its a bad thing to be optimistic and hope the team does well this year? I think that's called being a fucking fan."
CHIBears,3dzu6x,tillman33,0,Tue Jul 21 17:47:14 2015 UTC,"among his 'peers'  you need to define that.  all things are not equal among NFL QBs right now.  There's arguably 6-7 legitimate HoF locks playing currently (Manning x 2, Brady, Brees, Rodgers, Roethlisberger, Rivers is borderline imo)  Take those 6-7 out of the equation and compare Jay to the 'regular' starters of the league and he's probably in the top tier."

CHIBears,3dzu6x,soxside107,0,Tue Jul 21 20:20:48 2015 UTC,"Okay??? But we arent paying him like a regular fucking QB! We are paying him Flacco money, except Flacco actually won something for his contract. Jay just sat there and was carried by a bunch of studs and now that they are all old/gone Jay is fucked. But go ahead and tell me about how lucky we are that Jay will keep us just above mediocre so we get no high draft picks AND no playoff appearances."
CHIBears,3dzu6x,juicyja,2,Tue Jul 21 15:40:14 2015 UTC,"Actually any starting QB in the league that can win some games is almost guaranteed a $100M contract.  Or did you miss all of the extensions signed this offseason?  Sure they were younger guys but seriously you can't just let a QB walk if you don't have a better alternative.  It doesn't matter anymore who you're paying, if you have a guy that can win some games you're going to pay out the ass for it.  I mean fuck, Dalton just signed a $96M contract.  Cutler is better than him, and he gets paid like it.  A regular QB is worth a fuck ton of money nowadays."

I can't help but believe that every facet of the franchise has gotten better since then. There can be no doubt that the management and coaching have improved, and upgrades have been made to numerous schemes and positions.   This will carry over to Jay as well, because even if we assumed he is the pisspants sulky crybaby all his detractors say he is it would still be easier for him to go along with the rising tide than to continue to exert the effort to sulk by himself.   Bears will win at least 10 games. We just need to play .500 ball through Thanksgiving and the end of the season is a cakewalk. Anyone who doubts this is mistaken."

In 2013 they almost beat them. The reason the Bears didn't win came down to a historically bad defense. It's important when judging Cutler's success against Green Bay to remember they have Aaron ""Playoffs Guaranteed"" Rodgers, so the Bears have to field a complete team to beat them, and the Bears have been nowhere near that. They've had a great defense and an awful offensive line. Then they had a great offense and an historically bad defense. Of course that's a ""Cutler excuse"" so take it or leave it."

CHIBears,3dzu6x,PhilDunphy_,-11,Mon Jul 20 22:53:26 2015 UTC,"""The best QB since Sid Luckman,"" is not an argument.  It's an excuse and a hollow argument.  He's not worth the money.  What about the insane contract they gave him?  I'd rather see $5 M spent on a Mark Sanchez or Kyle Orton journeyman QB than $20 M on a Jay Cutler.  It's a no brainer to me.  Spend the remaining money on defense.  If you told me I could have Jay Cutler for $8 M, I would say OK.  QBs in this league would kill to have the offensive weapons and talent the 2014 Bears had.  They couldn't score 30 points a single time.  That's outrageous and falls squarely on the shoulders of the QB and the recently departed Trestman.    Jay Cutler is not a franchise QB that you build around.  Josh McDaniels knew it when he traded away Cutler and set the Broncos up for draft picks that fueled their Superbowl run years later.  And Phil Emery found that out the hard way."
CHIBears,3dzu6x,jakerake,15,Mon Jul 20 22:58:30 2015 UTC,It doesn't fall squarely on the qb. I can't believe I'm gonna even reply to such moronic talk. But maybe you can be enlightened by logic. Did you notice in 2014 both of our WR were hobbled for about 10+ games. Also lost Brandon Marshall for some games. There's a lot more to blame than cutler. Anyone who only blames him is an idiot who doesn't watch football.   Is he worth his contract? No but neither are more than half the quarterbacks in the league. Thats the going rate for a qb. Trestmans system was t very good the reason it worked in the beginning is cause teams didn't have tape of it. After they did they figured out how to combat it. Furthermore our defense was historically bad two years in a row. add in a shuffle of offensive linemen which made our moron HC afraid to throw the ball down the field which is one of Cutlers strengths.   And JOSH MCDANIELS?!?!? That's your fucking argument? Hahahahaha you mean Josh Mcdaniels the guy who ran the Broncos in the ground? Or the guy who couldn't find any other job so the patriots took him back as OC? Gotcha that dipshit. Terrible argument.

CHIBears,3dyekj,ssor21,7,Mon Jul 20 20:51:35 2015 UTC,He's about to leaping smash that fool with the ball. Just look at his face he knows he's about to die.

CHIBears,3dyekj,bemeren,9,Mon Jul 20 21:58:08 2015 UTC,"After Brian left, he was supposed to lead the D, and he hung it out to dry and let it become the worst defense in Bears history.  I loved the good years he gave us, but there's no way he can be in my top favorite players anymore.  Real Bears don't phone it in, they keep trying even when it gets tough."

CHIBears,3dyekj,bluntsncuntss,5,Mon Jul 20 23:53:50 2015 UTC,"I don't think he was given very much to work with either though. Putting the results of the Trestman regime defense solely on him is not something I can do. The entire team was lost in the locker room, not just him."
CHIBears,3dyekj,bemeren,2,Tue Jul 21 00:13:57 2015 UTC,"That's definitely something to take into consideration, but a real leader wouldn't have quit on the team like Briggs did."
CHIBears,3dyekj,bluntsncuntss,0,Tue Jul 21 00:55:58 2015 UTC,He asked to take leadership of the defense after Urlacher left. He wanted it and instead of stepping up into that role he fell flat on his face and had a meh attitude.
CHIBears,3dyekj,Moh7,3,Tue Jul 21 12:01:56 2015 UTC,Do you mean what he's doing in the picture? Because that's the first thing I thought.
CHIBears,3dyekj,PeanutPunch33,2,Mon Jul 20 22:53:01 2015 UTC,"That's what I think, too. At first I thought that Briggs had retweeted someone who retweeted him, but then I realized what the tweet meant. Bear or not, it's still 55 days, so he just retweeted it.   Now what his weird split legged jump was all about? I have no idea."
CHIBears,3dyekj,classic__schmosby,-1,Mon Jul 20 23:08:41 2015 UTC,I mean does he think he's going to be playing for the Bears in 55 days?

CHIBears,3e0fs0,RickSmith123,16,Tue Jul 21 00:21:16 2015 UTC,"Equating this to JPP messing with fireworks is asinine.  Houston's injury is easy to laugh at/mock, but all he did was a little hop.  There is nobody on this Earth who would have said beforehand, ""no Lamarr!  Wait!  You might tear your ACL!""  Not even Stephen Tulloch.  I don't know why the score is always brought up, like you're not supposed to be happy to make plays when you're losing.  Yeah I want my team to give up, not try hard and play with passion.  I want to lose because, man, we weren't even, like, trying.  That's what football is totally about."
CHIBears,3e0fs0,Crathsor,6,Tue Jul 21 00:42:16 2015 UTC,There was a cubs player a few weeks back that stared down the away dugout after hitting a home run being down by like 5. That's fucking moronic.
CHIBears,3e0fs0,raj96,3,Tue Jul 21 06:46:05 2015 UTC,It's pretty silly but I don't think it compares to being careless with fireworks.
CHIBears,3e0fs0,Crathsor,5,Tue Jul 21 06:55:33 2015 UTC,Give me a fucking break. We were down by 2000 points. The attitude that you're going to flail around like a fucking idiot at that point during that game is ridiculous. I hope John Fox doesn't put up with that kind of shit
CHIBears,3e0fs0,pacificlivin,7,Tue Jul 21 01:18:40 2015 UTC,"Nonsense.  He didn't flail around like a fucking idiot.  He took one little hop.  It wasn't some choreographed fishing thing or a cowboy simulation.  Bears did far more ridiculous shit this season.  While losing, because we usually were.  Houston took one little hop to celebrate a sack.  It wasn't anything to be mad about, and nobody would have noticed and we would all have completely forgotten about it if he hadn't suffered a freak injury.  And I still say comparing it to carelessness with fireworks is stupid."
CHIBears,3e0fs0,Crathsor,4,Tue Jul 21 01:54:50 2015 UTC,i agree with both of you somehow.
CHIBears,3e0fs0,ReddDawn,5,Tue Jul 21 14:57:09 2015 UTC,"I agree that it's completely different than the fireworks injuries from the other week but it wasn't just ""a little hop"". He did an excessive celebration given the situation.  You can still try hard and be humble about the situation you're in. Everyone on that field knew we were losing that game. He should've acted like a professional and ran back to the line for the next play.   I completely agree with /u/pacificlivin. There's a difference between celebrating your accomplishments on the field and making yourself, and your whole team, look like a joke by celebrating a sack when down 25 with like 3 minutes left in the fourth. That's not how winners act. Celebrating an individual achievement when your team is getting absolutely destroyed is pretty embarrassing if you ask me."

CHIBears,3e0fs0,ripjerryseinfeld,3,Tue Jul 21 05:04:53 2015 UTC,"Maybe, but that happens all the time, every week, on every losing team.  Very few NFL players stop playing with passion and happiness just because they're losing.  Do you really want them to?  Seriously?  I argue that acting humble has zero place on the field.  In post-game interviews, sure.  On TV and radio, absolutely.  But on the field, I want 53 guys who absolutely believe that they can win until the clock reads 0.  That takes a certain arrogance.  It is mandatory if you want to win anytime there is adversity."
CHIBears,3e0fs0,Crathsor,2,Tue Jul 21 04:14:19 2015 UTC,"That's not really the point. If he hustles back to the line and gets ready for the next play versus celebrating his sack of a backup quarterback at the end of a blow out, he's going to put the team in a better position, I think. It's like when Justin Tuck got in Khalil Mack's face after he was called off sides celebrating a sack. You're not putting the team in a position to win when you act like a moron."
CHIBears,3e0fs0,wolfrine20,3,Tue Jul 21 05:03:46 2015 UTC,"If he's out there dancing so long the team gets a penalty then yeah he's an idiot and we're on the same page.  That's not what happened, though.  He just took a hop and yelled.  That's it.  There was no dance routine.  It was a typical celebration, and wouldn't have impacted the game in any way if his knee hadn't blown out."
CHIBears,3e0fs0,Crathsor,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:11:45 2015 UTC,"I'd take a penalty over a blown out knee and mass scrutiny that I'm more into getting a single sack than, you know, winning the game."
CHIBears,3e0fs0,wolfrine20,2,Tue Jul 21 05:15:09 2015 UTC,But you're acting like the injury was intentional or even predictable when it wasn't.  I think that's the disconnect:  you cannot reasonably blame him for getting hurt here.
CHIBears,3e0fs0,Crathsor,2,Tue Jul 21 05:19:10 2015 UTC,"Just to clarify, I want to see him celebrate too, I really do. In this case, it could not have been at a worse time. There was nothing to celebrate when you're getting your head kicked in. Showing poise and focus over a minor celebration that had major repercussions, injury wise and publicity wise, is key here. It's poor timing is all. He should be getting other guys back to the huddle ready for the next play, trying to get the ball back, do ANYTHING with the time left. I wanna see him do that instead of ""little hops"" as you put it. THAT shows passion, that shows me, as a fan, that his head is in it."
CHIBears,3dzdij,Losalou52,6,Mon Jul 20 19:36:12 2015 UTC,"Over the last two seasons, Forte has turned 731 touches into 3,779 yards from scrimmage with 22 touchdowns. A year ago, he set the NFL record for receptions by a running back with 102 and joined LaDainian Tomlinson as the only backs in league history to rush for more than 1,000 yards while recording 100 catches in the same season.  To be clear, Forte averaged only 7.9 yards per reception last season because he was needed far too often as a check-down safety valve for quarterback Jay Cutler. New Bears offensive coordinator Adam Gase likely will expand Forte's receiving responsibilities, using the running back's ability to spread out wide while also featuring his crisp route running and reliable hands.   He still managed to be second in the NFL for YAC last year.  That includes WRs & TEs.   I find that impressive as hell, especially with how often Defenses were sitting on screen routes."
CHIBears,3dzdij,RogueEyebrow,2,Mon Jul 20 21:21:16 2015 UTC,"Quizz needs to be more consistent packing the rock.  Not sure if it was the line situation, the play calling, or him but he seemed to get buried in the backfield a lot in Atlanta.  He is a plus blocker and receiver.  If he can be a threat in the run game he will be a great depth addition, if not he will be relegated to a limited 3rd down role."

CHIBears,3dnztf,Mine_is_nice,32,Tue Jul 21 20:09:37 2015 UTC,Come on dude. He gave Chicago 3 great seasons and we should be grateful for that
CHIBears,3dnztf,PrisonInmateSBH,5,Fri Jul 17 21:24:39 2015 UTC,He did have his best years with the Bears. I'm just a little salty with the Bears team as a whole while he was apart of it. There's no question that he was a bug in the locker room.
CHIBears,3dnztf,enjoytheshow,4,Fri Jul 17 21:43:57 2015 UTC,I try to remember him by his one handed catch against the 49ers or that epic stiff arm against the Pack. I know things went south but you can't take those moments away.
CHIBears,3dnztf,Sks44,2,Fri Jul 17 21:52:45 2015 UTC,I think there are plenty of people on this sub that really like Orton.  He led us on some key drives / games that made our Super Bowl appearance possible.

CHIBears,3dnjx6,BearDownChicagoBears,5,Fri Jul 17 19:59:56 2015 UTC,I think the defense could be atrocious.  Not sure how they'll stop the run and not sure of the secondary will be any better at defending the pass.  I'm sure hoping Vic and John can work some magic tho!
CHIBears,3dnjx6,HideAndSeek,11,Fri Jul 17 20:21:13 2015 UTC,"They should be just fine stopping the run, IMO.  I'm much more worried about pass coverage, especially from the ILBs and S."
CHIBears,3dnjx6,BearDownChicagoBears,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:22:57 2015 UTC,"But aren't the OLB's the ones in pass coverage in the 3-4 scheme?    The Bears got gashed on the ground last season and now there'll be players in new positions all over the front 7.  I'm scared, hold me."
CHIBears,3dnjx6,HideAndSeek,3,Fri Jul 17 21:05:49 2015 UTC,"their run D was actually roughly average last year (17th in yards per game, 22nd in yards per carry).  Their pass D was terrible.  The reverse of 2013.  And the OLBs rush the passer more than they drop into coverage.  They're roughly equivalent to 4-3 DEs, especially in 2-4-5 nickel looks that will be very common in passing situations."
CHIBears,3dnjx6,BearDownChicagoBears,2,Fri Jul 17 22:04:40 2015 UTC,"No, olbs rush the passer in the 3-4 scheme...."
CHIBears,3dnjx6,bojackvinceman,1 point,Sat Jul 18 14:38:09 2015 UTC,At least one of the OLBs will rush the passer on nearly every down. The three down linemen are more gap fillers than pass rushers.
CHIBears,3dnjx6,fryingdutchman69,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:11:34 2015 UTC,"The beauty of the scheme is that you don't know.  Take the basic 4-3 as the base for football:  four pass rushers (the defensive line).  In the 3-4, you only have three linemen.  So they're all heading upfield, but you have an extra slot.  Who will it be?  MOST of the time it's an outside linebacker, and that's how guys like Lawrence Taylor racked up so many sacks.  But it could be anyone.  The o-line doesn't know who's coming even on a base (non-blitz) play.  The 4-3 can do this too, (e.g., with zone blitzes), but it's baked right into the 3-4 on every single play.  Assuming you have more than one competent upfield rusher among your back eight and some variety in your playcalling, this makes the offense's job harder.  We should get better against the run and the pass just because sometimes our opponents will call bad blocking assignments, fooled by who we were rushing and who we were dropping back.  It is safe to say that never happened last year.  If McPhee turns out to be all we have, or if we're too predictable, then worst-case scenario is that we're back to the 4-3 with a little less weight and a little more athleticism on the field.  That could go either way.  But I think between Houston, Acho, and Allen there should be at least a second guy who is dangerous, and Fangio has not been a bad playcaller in the past, so we probably don't have to worry about this outcome."
CHIBears,3dnjx6,Crathsor,1 point,Sat Jul 18 14:58:57 2015 UTC,We HAD one of the worst run defenses in the league before the offseason. I wonder now if that will change.
CHIBears,3dnjx6,fast420sailor7,-7,Fri Jul 17 22:00:17 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry, Russell Wilson and Cam Newton in the same category as Megatron and AP? Is this The Onion?"
CHIBears,3dnjx6,fryingdutchman69,9,Fri Jul 17 22:10:17 2015 UTC,"The author is talking about them taking over a MADDEN game.  Some players have physical attributes that make them incredible in Madden while leaving something to be desired in life, Vick is an example."
CHIBears,3dnjx6,bigtimetimmyjim22,5,Sat Jul 18 00:14:05 2015 UTC,"They didn't really say that.  All they're saying is that they are all the kind of individuals who can take over a game.  Russell Wilson once threw for 300 yards and 2 TD while rushing for another 100 yards and a score.  Seahawks lost that game but I still think that fits the definition of taking over as much as a single player can.  Cam's had a couple 280 passing yard days with 100+ rushing, too.  Panthers didn't win them both but I don't think you can blame Cam for that.  Adrian and Calvin lose lots of games, too.  In this one respect, I think it's fair to lump these guys together:  if you don't account for them, they can beat you almost by themselves."
CHIBears,3dnjx6,Crathsor,5,Fri Jul 17 22:35:40 2015 UTC,"However, like LeBron James, if these players take over, it's often because they have to compensate for players around them who are underachieving, which often means that they don't necessarily make their team more likely to win as much as they prevent a blowout. How many times have you seen Megatron ball and the Lions lose, or AP get 150 yards and a pair of TDs in a loss? I can recall more than a couple times that's happened."
CHIBears,3dnjx6,Antitypical,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:55:17 2015 UTC,"No question!  I'd much rather have a solid team than a superstar.  But that doesn't change the fact that some players can take over, or that Wilson and Newton are both that kind of player."

CHIBears,3dmsp6,TheBard87,19,Sat Jul 18 16:33:41 2015 UTC,"There is plenty to discover about the Bears as they prepare to embark on their 14th summer training camp at Olivet Nazarene University in Bourbonnais.  Tribune special contributor Matt Bowen sat down for 10 questions about what he expects from new coach John Fox and the re-tooled team.  Has John Fox set tempo for this team already or is that something that really takes place in training camp?  ""Any new coach is going to establish the culture and tempo during (organized team activities) and minicamp, offseason strength and conditioning workouts. But you really build a new team under a new coach when you put pads on. I expect this will be one of the most physical camps the Bears have had in years. The last couple of years reminded me of a Mike Martz training camp when I played with the Rams. It was more attention to detail and technique over physicality.  ""What you want to do is get a blend of both where guys are playing with technique but they are hitting and competing. You get to the point where you walk in on the first day of practice and you know almost all of the jobs are for sale. Who wants to go get them? The way you do that is with pads and letting guys go hit.""  People talk about offensive coordinator Adam Gase working the last two seasons with Peyton Manning a lot, but how imaginative was his X's and O's stuff?  ""It is pretty complex. You're going to see a lot of core schemes you see around the NFL, … but what you really see with Adam Gase is putting his skill players in a position to succeed. Obviously, his offense did cater to Peyton Manning to a certain degree (but) this is the best collection of skilled talent Jay Cutler has had since he has been here.  ""It is Gase's job to put those players in a position to succeed, especially rookie Kevin White. You have to (give) him four to five routes to master. Coming from a spread (college) offense he's a little raw in his route-running but athletically he is off the charts.""  Can Gase be a good fit with quarterback Jay Cutler?  ""He can be. If you watch the second half of Denver's season last year (when) Manning's arm was getting a little worn down, they were more balanced. They were physical up front. They would bring six offensive linemen into the game. What that does is protect your quarterback. You don't get to third-and-8 and say, 'OK Jay, go make a play, go save us.'  ""You want to be in a situation where you can manage the playbook, you can move the sticks and take shots over the top. You want to have every play call in your back pocket and use whatever you want. In the beginning you have to be balanced. In terms of fixing Cutler, that narrative is old and worn out. But he has all the tools to succeed in this offense because of the talent around him. With balanced play calling, he should be in position to succeed. He should have no excuses.""  Bigger difference maker in 2015 — Eddie Royal or Kevin White?  ""Eddie Royal. White is a rookie and you expect him to produce some, but Royal is a proven guy. He can line up outside the numbers but more important (is) production from the slot and that speed. I mean change-of-direction speed, acceleration, production after the catch. You don't have to run a 4.3 to play in the slot. You have to be quick. You have to have great footwork and you have to be a good route runner. That's what Eddie Royal is. ""Yeah, you want Kevin White to catch seven, eight, nine or 10 touchdowns. He is a top-10 pick. But you have to manage those expectations. White could be a very big-play guy and a mismatch guy but when you need to make a play, I expect the football to go (to Royal). I don't think people are talking about Eddie Royal enough. He's a premier slot receiver.""  How does Matt Forte fit what the Broncos did under Gase in the running game?  ""They will run some power but their base is going to be zone blocking. He has to be one cut and go. There can be no hesitation. That is going to lead to their play action and that balanced play-calling. In terms of a running style, does he fit? Of course he does. There is no reason he shouldn't be a productive runner in this offense, especially with this offensive line that is better than a lot of people give it credit for.  ""The key for Forte is press the edge of the formation, look for a cutback lane, find daylight and get up the field. He glides through his cuts. He is a smooth runner. To get there you have to get the first part — pick a hole and go.""   Is the addition of 32-year-old Antrel Rolle enough to steady the safety position, at least temporarily?  ""Temporarily. That is the key word. He's not the answer. He doesn't run like he did in his late 20s. But what you get is a veteran who is not going to bust you, can line everyone up, is dependable and accountable and can play through injuries. You need those guys in the secondary. … What you have with Antrel Rolle is hopefully a bridge to the future and you can get one or two good years from him (when he can) protect you over the top, especially when you have a new scheme. This is complex stuff and you need a leader back there.""  The Bears have veterans out to prove something on defense like Jared Allen, Lamarr Houston and Tim Jennings. Does that bode well for the defense?  ""It bodes well for the competition in camp because every day is going to be an interview for these defensive players and no one has a starting job. When you have a new coach, especially on defense, you have to autograph your performance every day during practice. That is even harder to do now with only one practice a day so these practices are important for competing for your job. Tim Jennings, we've seen in the past he can produce, he can make plays on the ball. Jared Allen, he can get to the quarterback.  ""This is why you get a guy like Lamarr Houston. When Phil Emery brought him in they had some creative ideas but they never got to that point. He was playing a little out of position. You weren't maximizing his talent. In this defense, (coordinator) Vic Fangio can maximize that talent. He is physical. He is tough. This guy should be a pit bull on that defensive front.""  Pernell McPhee did a lot of different things for the Ravens. Can he be a top pass rusher for the Bears?  ""You (paid) him like that on the first day of free agency so you expect those sack numbers to be there. They will be creative with him. They will line him up at D-tackle. They will line him up at outside linebacker and defensive end because he has rare ability given his size and his weight. He is big but he can get home to the quarterback. I thought he had some of the best film in the NFL last year. Now that was in a limited role. You are trying to project his talent to a full-time role. But in terms of skill-set and talent, this is the guy you want for this defense.""  Kyle Long — right guard or one of the tackle spots?  ""There is no question he can play tackle in the NFL. (But) in today's NFL, the guard position is becoming more valuable (because of) what they do and how much they pull and how much they move. Long has the strength at the point of attack and he has high-level athletic ability for a man his size. I would keep him at guard, especially if you are going to be a zone team or a power team. You are going to pull Kyle Long. It's not that he can't play tackle … but I've always said you build a team up the middle. If you are strong up the middle, you can win football games. That is why I would keep him at guard.""  Can the Bears surprise a lot of teams this season?  ""If they play better defense. Much better defense. The underlying story for this franchise the past couple of years is the rapid decline of defensive talent and defensive production. You throw on the Sunday night game from Green Bay last season, that is embarrassing football.   ""Offensively, they are going to score some points. They have the talent and the line to move the ball. Defensively, they have to get better and they have to completely change the way they play. ""If I was coaching, the first meeting of camp I would put on that film from Green Bay last year and say, 'We are not going to play football like this.' If they play better defense this season, they'll be in the discussion at Thanksgiving and that is where you want to be as a football team."""
CHIBears,3dmsp6,ChLoRo8523,8,Fri Jul 17 15:22:46 2015 UTC,You're the hero we need
CHIBears,3dmsp6,Antitypical,10,Fri Jul 17 15:53:43 2015 UTC,"I think Bowen makes some fantastic points here.  A few of my favorites:  1) Situational play calling to avoid repeated terrible down and distance plays where you put Cutler in position to take risks (and turn the ball over).  This was a huge problem for Chicago last year, and something Denver was really good at.  Here's hoping it translates to Chicago and wasn't just the Peyton effect.  2) Houston is a great fit in this D.  People talk about him being out of place, which makes no sense.    3) Physical training camp with lots of guys competing because they have to EARN jobs.  I'm looking forward to that.    I also found it interesting he said this is the best collection of talent around Cutler that he's had.  I would put last year over this, as I'd rather have Marshall than Royal + White as a rookie."
CHIBears,3dmsp6,ohanewone,12,Fri Jul 17 15:37:28 2015 UTC,"They didn't have a true slot reciever last year. Royal gives Cutler a whole new type of weapon. Is the combination of Royal & White better than Marshall? Maybe, that's yet to be seen though. However I think this is by far the most balanced level of talent Cutler has had around him since he got here. He has access to pretty much every type of reciever he could need, not to mention the size of the recievers. Bennett is 6'6"", White and Jeffery are both 6'3"", Forte is 6'2"", it's gonna be nice having Royal out there at 5'10"" as the small slot reciever. We won't know if this is truly the most talented collection Cutler has had around him until we see them play, but it's certainly the most diverse in terms of what each person is capable of doing. I'm so excited to see what they come up with."
CHIBears,3dmsp6,whaturpriceforflight,2,Fri Jul 17 17:42:38 2015 UTC,"It's the deepest and most versatile, but I would disagree with best.  I'd take 2013 or 2014 over this just due to more studs."
CHIBears,3dmsp6,Antitypical,4,Fri Jul 17 18:08:19 2015 UTC,"I also found it interesting he said this is the best collection of talent around Cutler that he's had.  I would put last year over this, as I'd rather have Marshall than Royal + White as a rookie.   I was pretty pumped for royal. I think alshon, due largely to his training with brandon, can take over that big strong possession receiver role. One of the issues last year was kind of a lack of speed or quickness off the line. I think between royal, jeffery, and white (once he develops a bit) the bears have the different  receiving aspects down; strength, possession, physicality at the point of catch, quickness in the slot, and some good speed to take the top off and keep the defense honest. And that's not even considering Bennett  or Forte. I think this offense has a ton going for it, ability wise. Add in a good coordinator and I'm looking forward the offense this year for sure."

CHIBears,3dj7tj,Green89,3,Thu Jul 16 18:32:13 2015 UTC,"I think this is a bit high on the WRs.  How do you give a position an A when they have only 2 players on the roster who have even caught 20 NFL passes, and only one of them has made a Pro Bowl?"
CHIBears,3dj7tj,BearDownChicagoBears,3,Thu Jul 16 19:52:51 2015 UTC,"I'd also say it's a bit high on DL, CB, and S.  Really tough to call any of those positions above average right now, IMO.  Not enough stars, and too many unproven youngsters."
CHIBears,3dj7tj,BearDownChicagoBears,3,Thu Jul 16 19:54:04 2015 UTC,And tight end. Bennett himself is a B+ on the bell curve with Graham and Gronkowski being the As.
CHIBears,3dj7tj,fryingdutchman69,3,Fri Jul 17 01:54:54 2015 UTC,"Hey guys,  We're doing a series ranking every NFL team by position on our sportsblog, and the Bears were next. I hope it's reasonably accurate, and I apologize if you feel we relied on PFF a little too heavily.  I have a couple of questions for you guys if you don't mind. How do Bears fans feel about Cutler? Do you like him as a starter (ignoring the ridiculous cap hit). Realistically, how well do you think this team can do this season? The Bears don't seem to be as bad on paper as people claim."
CHIBears,3dj7tj,emaugustBRDLC,4,Thu Jul 16 18:33:39 2015 UTC,I have a lot more faith in the average-ish performance Cutler is due to put in than I do in our DL putting in an average-ish performance this year. Or our secondary.
CHIBears,3dj7tj,BearDownChicagoBears,2,Fri Jul 17 21:06:31 2015 UTC,"The opinions on Cutler vary widely based on who chimes in.  Some think he's terrible, others think he's great, I think the overall consensus is probably somewhere in the middle, around average.  Most fans might not necessarily like him as a starter, but at least accept that he's the best option for now and will likely be gone in the next few years.  Most people seem to have pretty low expectations, but some have talked playoffs.  Personally, I'm hoping for around .500.  I don't think they're a terrible team, but I also don't think their overall talent is more than average.  Plus the schedule seems pretty difficult.   If the defense takes a huge step forward under Fangio and the offense regains closer to its 2013 form with better injury luck, I could see them in playoff contention, but those are two big ifs."
CHIBears,3dj7tj,fryingdutchman69,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:52:22 2015 UTC,I don't know how you're rating our TEs an A. What does New England and New Orleans get? AAA?

CHIBears,3dj7tj,rudeboybill,3,Fri Jul 17 02:43:32 2015 UTC,"Grades seemed pretty fair, maybe overplaying our OLB depth right now as most of them are 4-3 DEs we're hoping can make the switch. Also worth note is that Cutler doesn't really have 5 years of cash heading his way; I believe we can cut him next year for 0 dollars guaranteed."
CHIBears,3dj7tj,BearDownChicagoBears,3,Thu Jul 16 18:43:35 2015 UTC,2 more years and then the money is out (all but $2M)
CHIBears,3dj7tj,opeth10657,2,Thu Jul 16 19:49:06 2015 UTC,Really? Guess Cutler's out of here pretty soon then?
CHIBears,3dj7tj,rudeboybill,6,Thu Jul 16 19:10:03 2015 UTC,Really depends on how he plays this year/next year i think.  There isn't really any other qb his level or above waiting around for someone to give them a starting job
CHIBears,3dj7tj,psychicmachinery,2,Thu Jul 16 19:11:52 2015 UTC,"Yup, and I'd even assume if they did draft/sign (unlikely)/trade for (even more unlikely) someone to replace him next year they'd keep Cutler around until he's ready."

CHIBears,3dewqo,nklotz,31,Wed Jul 15 19:01:41 2015 UTC,"GB would have never let that happen, but fascinating to think what if.  1) That 2008 team would have been damn good.  They were already pretty good at 9-7, and they gave away 3 games they had all but one thanks to Lovie going uber-conservative in his ""prevent a win"" defense too early.  I still can't believe they managed to lose that ATL game after scoring the go-ahead points with 6 seconds left.  2) Favre retires after 2010.  Bears had never traded for Cutler, so what now?  They're looking at drafting a QB very highly in 2011.  Could they have ended up with Dalton or Kaepernick?  Or would they have reached for Christian Ponder like the Vikings did?    It would have certainly meant a seismic shift for the franchise since 2008."
CHIBears,3dewqo,BearDownChicagoBears,14,Wed Jul 15 19:49:24 2015 UTC,"they gave away 3 games    In 2008 they blew games against the Panthers, the Bucs, the Falcons (big time - I will never get over that loss), and the Texans."
CHIBears,3dewqo,thepikey7,15,Wed Jul 15 19:56:17 2015 UTC,The ATL loss still makes me sick. I still remember screaming about Lovie's prevent D on that one. They were 13 YARDS OFF THE WR!!! I need to lie down.
CHIBears,3dewqo,StubbyK,5,Wed Jul 15 20:36:58 2015 UTC,"Worse than that was the decision to play a guy who never played for the Bears at safety at that time... I didn't have a huge problem with the large cushion, just make sure you are between the sideline and the receiver, he get tackled in bounds or takes one half second longer to get out and theres no time left."
CHIBears,3dewqo,thepikey7,6,Wed Jul 15 20:40:39 2015 UTC,not to mention the short kickoff to give them a shot at even getting into FG range in time.  That was an unconscionable decision.
CHIBears,3dewqo,BearDownChicagoBears,3,Wed Jul 15 22:24:20 2015 UTC,They reasoning on the squib kick was because the Atlanta returner had returned one to mid field earlier. Shitty reasoning in my opinion.
CHIBears,3dewqo,thepikey7,4,Wed Jul 15 22:38:18 2015 UTC,"a return to midfield on a normal kickoff would have run out the clock.  Normal kickoff and they either need to hail mary or get a return TD.  Squib kick and they can do exactly what they did, which has much higher odds of success."
CHIBears,3dewqo,BearDownChicagoBears,3,Wed Jul 15 22:53:18 2015 UTC,"Yup, should have kicked it deep and trusted your coverage team. The only worse option would have been a kick out of bounds. Also, interesting note, under ""Squib kick"" on Wikipedia it says this:   A squib kick can work against the kicking team, especially if the receiving team is expecting it. Because the kick is so short, the receiving team will usually get good field position, even if there is a minimal gain on the return. And if the receiving player can manage a moderate gain return, the field position can be outstanding. A good example of this occurred on October 12, 2008, when Chicago Bears head coach Lovie Smith decided to squib a kick with 11 seconds to go vs. the Atlanta Falcons and the Bears up 1. The Falcons got the ball at their own 45, and after a pass play, they kicked a 48-yard field goal to win with no time left. A few weeks later, in a Monday Night Football game vs. the Green Bay Packers, Smith again ordered a squib kick after the Bears had tied the game with 3:11 left in regulation. Following the squib kick, and a return, and an unnecessary roughness penalty on Adrian Peterson, the Packers had the ball at the Bears 35. Fortunately for Smith, the Bears defense shut down the Packers, Alex Brown blocked the field goal attempt and sent the game into overtime, where the Bears would win."
CHIBears,3dewqo,thepikey7,2,Wed Jul 15 23:06:32 2015 UTC,I was at that Bears Packers game..coldest game in soldier field history..but that win though..priceless!

The tears would have been delicious."
CHIBears,3dewqo,Antitypical,47,Wed Jul 15 19:32:50 2015 UTC,"If we had Favre, we wouldn't have traded for Cutler, which means we still would have had two first round picks, and a third, plus a good backup in Kyle Orton.

I'd take Kyle Orton over Jay Culter any day.  Orton got only 1/4th of what Cutler got in salary last year and had a better year."
CHIBears,3dle7u,sulandra,3,Fri Jul 17 20:10:15 2015 UTC,"You are simply not correct. Even adjusted to the 3 extra games, Cutler had more yards, better completion percentage and more TDs"
CHIBears,3dle7u,odd_orange,-7,Fri Jul 17 20:41:09 2015 UTC,"The numbers you cite do not matter, because his stats last year were skewed by garbage time unlike any other year in Cutler's career.  IF you are sitting here telling me with a straight face that Cutler had a career high year, but:   The guy (Phil Emery) who signed his contract was fired. Jay Cutler's statement during a pre-season interview w/ Bears sideline reporter was that the single most important measure of success in 2014 would be turnovers.  I suggest you look up that figure and compare it to Kyle Orton, because that's what impacts game outcomes more than cheap dink and dunk screen passes to Matt Forte. Bears ownership had ""Buyers remorse"" over the contract (who wouldn't.. it's one of the worst contracts in the NFL, some rank it the absolute worst). Jay Cutler statistically regressed last year, when you factor out the garbage time (cheap yardage).   IDK why everyone has to make this about personalities or think someone is talking smack.  This AM on 670 Score, they were talking about Brandon Marshall.  Several points were made:   BMarsh is a true #1 WR, the radio hosts (including Bears All Access host Zach Zaidman) said they didn't think Alshon was. The Bears were a worse team without BMarsh.  ""Say what you want about his locker room antics, the guy is a hell of a player and he made everyone else around him a better player."" What matters most (wins and losses) was better under Orton than Cutler.  He managed games better, he produced wins and didn't turn the ball over.   IDK why everyone has to think Brandon Marshall has a mental disorder or is somehow talking trash.  BMarsh said in his most recent interview on ESPN 1000 that he wished Jay nothing but the best but it's like everyone's always said, ""He has all the tools, but can he put it together?""  Reminds me of another BMarsh quote from the 2014 season, ""Same mistakes... same mistakes,"" when he was talking about careless turnovers Cutler made.  tldr:  this entire thread is represented of meatball mania in /r/chibears.  Rather than acknowledge BMarsh's informed and probably correct opinion, he's written off as having some kind of ulterior motive.  it's laughable."
CHIBears,3dle7u,sulandra,4,Fri Jul 17 22:33:40 2015 UTC,"Congrats, if you're a troll you made me probably the most angry and frustrated I've been from reading on the internet in months. If not, then I wrote something for you  1st, no. Just no. Orton is not better in any way, shape, or form than Jay Cutler. I don't think Jay is the best in the league, but Kyle Orton is certainly not better. Orton has played I believe 3-4 complete seasons, so an incredibly small sample size, and even then he's in no way markedly better. Literally the only stat that he's been better at than Cutler is ints. That's it. End of discussion on that.   2nd. Brandon Marshall is an idiot. He threw his teammates under the bus, challenged people to fights, and literally no one on the team really cares that he's gone. He's been like this since he's been in the league with three teams.   3rd. Alshon is in what, his 3rd year? Last season he was battling injuries? I'm pretty confident that he can be a number 1 (which has ABSOLUTELY NOTHING to do with this argument at all)  4th. It's incredibly easy to win when you have a top 3 defense in the league and have to do literally nothing. Even then they had 3 more wins.   Oh, and Phil Emery got fired, which means by some part of the transitive property, Cutler is terrible. Guess we can forgot about your beloved Marshall, Kyle Long, Alshon, Fuller. They're useless. They have the taint of Emery.  When Marshall was traded everyone was on his balls and hated the deal. Then everyone came to their senses and realized he probably did in fact instigate issues and isn't a great team player. You're being dumb. So please stop"
CHIBears,3dle7u,odd_orange,-1,Fri Jul 17 23:31:35 2015 UTC,"Congrats, if you're a troll you made me probably the most angry and frustrated I've been from reading on the internet in months.   IDK if you have a selective reading disorder, because in both posts I specifically cite last year and not over the course of their comparative careers.  I don't think Orton has the body of work and wasn't given as much opportunity.  I don't think you can even make legitimate career-wise comparisons between the two.  But I think for a guy who is an elite Wide Receiver and played with Cutler and Orton, then Marshall is certainly entitled to his viewpoint and I would certainly take his educated viewpoint on who is a better QB than some schmuck in /r/chibears who chooses to contort logic and invent some kind of tawdry National Enquirer-like he-said, he-said story about how they are no longer friends and it's all about personalities and baseless animosities.  What utter nonsense.   literally no one on the team really cares that he's gone.   This isn't true and multiple outlets have reported that Martellus Bennett and Alshon were not happy to see him go, but understand the business aspect and disinterest from Bears ownership about having him around.   I'm pretty confident that he can be a number 1 (which has ABSOLUTELY NOTHING to do with this argument at all)   Well your confidence exceeds anything I've seen out of any Bears beat reporter.  Feel free to cite any paid professional analyst who shares your viewpoint, because I as far as I've seen, everyone is skeptical and taking a wait n see approach.  There were a few games last year when BMarsh was out and Alshon was healthy, and he did not produce like a true #1 (the way BMarsh is).  Feel free to pull up the Mully and Hanley show (I believe it was the 2nd hour this AM) where the discussed this issue.  The reporter who does the Bears All Access show w/ Halas Hall/Bears organization gave these and other points as to why Alshon isn't a true #1.   4th. It's incredibly easy to win when you have a top 3 defense in the league and have to do literally nothing. Even then they had 3 more wins.   When you only have to pay $5 M for your QB and can afford to spend gratuitously on defense, then you can produce that kind of season.  The Bears spend enormously on offense (starting with Cutler).  The salary cap was expended almost 2 for 1 on offense vs. defense last year and that means the onus is on the offense to produce high scoring, shoot-out contest winning football.  Where was it?  The Bills bet on defense, so for you to try to discredit Orton, simply because he's executing the franchise's roster strategy, is rather illogical.  In what game last year, during the first half, did Cutler go toe-to-toe with an opposing team and march the team down the field repeatedly and score repeatedly -- winning a high scoring, offensive shoot out?  Maybe one game -- the Atlanta game.  Outside of that Cutler had sub-par (almost entirely negative grades) in every single other game according to pro football focus.   Phil Emery got fired, which means by some part of the transitive property, Cutler is terrible. Guess we can forgot about your beloved Marshall, Kyle Long, Alshon, Fuller. They're useless. They have the taint of Emery.   The two biggest decisions Phil Emery made were Marc Trestman and Jay Cutler, and that's why he's out of a job.  He made a lot of other decisions, which by most accounts were decent.  But he bet on a ""win now"" strategy coupled with Cutler/Trestman and that was his downfall.  It's not Brandon Marshall, it's not Martellus Bennett or any of this other nonsense.  In any job, mistakes will be made, but when you screw up the biggest decisions with millstone contracts like Cutler's (the worst contract in the league by most accounts), then you are handed your walking papers."
CHIBears,3dle7u,sulandra,6,Fri Jul 17 23:46:59 2015 UTC,"Dude...really?  Okay, you say that it's only about last year. Marshall said that Orton is the best he's ever played with. That means he's referencing every season either have played. Then you go on to say that Cutler and Orton can't be compared because Orton doesn't have enough games to go off of. Well, Brandon is saying otherwise.  Then you go onto say that I can't blame Orton for playing the system of having a great defense, but you can blame Cutler. Which is something you actually mention, the garbage time. When you're down by 28 in the first half because you're defense can't stop a drive, you're going to make big and riskier throws leading to more picks. More picks being the one reason Orton was better according to you.   As for Alshon, his summary on rotoworld"
CHIBears,3dle7u,odd_orange,-4,Sat Jul 18 00:07:12 2015 UTC,"Okay, you say that it's only about last year. Marshall said that Orton is the best he's ever played with. That means he's referencing every season either have played. Then you go on to say that Cutler and Orton can't be compared because Orton doesn't have enough games to go off of. Well, Brandon is saying otherwise.   The point is it's a totally legitimate viewpoint, there is evidence to support it (last year etc.), and to dismiss Marshall (as every meathead idiot here seems to do) is total homerism crap.  Orton is a better QB.  I'd even take Mark Sanchez for $5 M a year instead of Cutler for $18-20 M.   Then you go onto say that I can't blame Orton for playing the system of having a great defense, but you can blame Cutler.  Which is something you actually mention, the garbage time. When you're down by 28 in the first half because you're defense can't stop a drive, you're going to make big and riskier throws leading to more picks.   When you spend 2 for 1 of the salary cap on offense vs. defense, it's the responsibility of the offense to score on early possessions.  How often did the maligned defense play with a lead?  Rarely.  It's remarkable the excuse making that goes on for a big money QB and high priced weapons.    As Jim McMahon said tonight in an interview on CSN, ""I've never met Jay Cutler.  I don't know Jay Cutler.  But I can't understand with all that talent how they were not scoring 40 points a game.""  With big paychecks, comes big responsibility.  It's entirely up to Jay Cutler to lead the team and score points.  He's got the big contract, show up and perform.  The offense should be keeping the team in the ballgame and not the hollowed out defense.  The Phil Emery bet was on offensive talent.  Comparing the defense of the Bills to the Bears, is moronic.   As for Alshon, his summary on rotoworld   This is your ""analysis""  a quote from his own QB?  What an impartial and fair/balanced analysis.  It's as meaningless as George McCaskey calling up Ray MacDonald's family and asking them if he's a ""good guy""... what a joke."

CHIBears,3dff1n,Veride,2,Thu Jul 16 22:27:04 2015 UTC,I would say that is about right if they expand to a 16 team playoff.
CHIBears,3dff1n,Headwallrepeat,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:55:35 2015 UTC,"Interestingly, two teams in the last 20 years have turned around from a record of 5-11 or worse to win the super bowl!  The first was the 1999 Rams who went 4-12 in 1998 in Dick Vermeil's second season as head coach.  The other was the 2001 Patriots who won during Bill Belichick's second season after going 5-11 in 2000."
CHIBears,3dff1n,juicyja,3,Thu Jul 16 12:54:28 2015 UTC,"In each case, they discovered they had a quarterback who was a real gem.  If Cutler discovers that it's always so dark cause he has his head up his ass, he would still need a proctologist and an entire season to heal from the injury."

CHIBears,3dff1n,juicyja,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:44:46 2015 UTC,Playoffs?  What are playoffs?
CHIBears,3dfpgs,BearDownChicagoBears,19,Wed Jul 15 22:25:04 2015 UTC,I would wait and see how he does as an number one WR before paying him.   Marshall missed the final 3 games so Jeffery was the number #1 WR those 3 games. He had 184 total yards combined those 3 games but only caught 12 catches on 29 targets.   Two of those games were divisional games against the Lions and Vikes. With Marshall in the game Jeffery caught 20 of 30 target. Two games against those teams without Marshall he caught 8 of 20 targets.   I'd wait to see if he can actually handle being the number one. Could save them a couple million or cost them a couple by waiting.
CHIBears,3dfpgs,LaCW09,4,Thu Jul 16 00:20:26 2015 UTC,"I disagree. We know he's a keeper. If the contract we give him is on par with Cobb as an elite WR2, he's already proven he can fill that role. Then all that's left to do is groom him to take over as a WR1 at a high end WR2 price."
CHIBears,3dfpgs,juicyja,3,Thu Jul 16 12:30:35 2015 UTC,"Don't forget Cobb turned down $12M/year to re-sign with GB.  Hometown discount to play with the best QB in the NFL on a SB contender.  You can't expect the same from other players, and Jeffery has already accomplished as much as (if not more than) Cobb with a year to go before FA.    Again, all signs point to Jeffery signing a contract in excess of $12M/year if he plays out his deal this year.  They can probably get him for closer to what Cobb signed in GB if they sign him now though."
CHIBears,3dfpgs,morphd_,4,Thu Jul 16 20:47:37 2015 UTC,"consider what you're saying.  when marshall was out the next best receiving threat on the outside was who? josh morgan? of course we had bennett and he did an exceptional job at the te spot, but he doesn't have the speed to line him up outside the hashes on a consistent basis.  this year should be a better measuring stick considering our receiving corps are way more diverse this time around."
CHIBears,3dfpgs,GabeDef,4,Thu Jul 16 13:36:17 2015 UTC,"Mike Wallace hit FA coming off a year in which he only caught 64 of 119 targets for 836 yards, and he signed what was the 2nd biggest WR contract in the NFL until yesterday.  Barring a career-altering injury, there's basically no way Jeffery gets cheaper next year compared to signing him right now."
CHIBears,3dfpgs,MidwayRoar54,2,Thu Jul 16 12:39:29 2015 UTC,"There's a lot of cap room next season to get Jeffery in a long term deal.  I agree to wait and see - he's been excellent, but I feel the hard work is coming this season."
CHIBears,3dfpgs,rblumenfeld76,5,Thu Jul 16 12:33:51 2015 UTC,"Well I would like to simply see how this season plays out considering we drafted Kevin White.  I know he's just a rookie, and FOX is known not to start alot of his rookie draft picks even though White went 7th overall BUT considering the attention on Alshon we should have a pretty play action game with Whites height and speed...sorry for ramblin I'm at a solid [8]... DAAAA BEARSS!"
CHIBears,3dfpgs,rblumenfeld76,1 point,Thu Jul 16 07:25:00 2015 UTC,"What's he expected to get?  I don't see him getting much more than than Brandon Marshall, if that.  Anywhere from $10-$12 million I'm assuming."
CHIBears,3dfpgs,rblumenfeld76,2,Thu Jul 16 19:53:04 2015 UTC,"if he signs now, then around $10-11M per year sounds about right (like others who extended early, including Marshall and Jordy).  If he plays to an expired contract, the comparables change to players like Mike Wallace, Jeremy Maclin, and Vincent Jackson, who all signed for $11-12M/year.    Maclin didn't have a resume matching Jeffery's, Jackson was a few years older, and Wallace signed the biggest deal ($12M/year) on a smaller cap coming off a down year.  So I'd expect Jeffery to be between $12-13M a year if he plays out this year."
CHIBears,3dfpgs,VIJoe,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:26:40 2015 UTC,I thought Mike Wallace got $27 million a game.

CHIBears,3dfgum,e39,2,Thu Jul 16 01:48:12 2015 UTC,honestly that kind of thing does occasionally happen but not usually if you bought from one of the better rated sellers.
CHIBears,3dfgum,ACSimeon,3,Thu Jul 16 02:08:52 2015 UTC,"The AliExpress jerseys get the job done, but when you wear one of those next to someone in an authentic, it looks real bad.     sizing is inconsistent patches and numbering are often off-center coloring is just wrong (an intended deep orange looks peach or neon)   With the way the Bears turn over their roster, I'll never fault anyone for getting an AliExpress jersey, just know that they're not as close as people think."
CHIBears,3dfgum,Newport_100s,2,Wed Jul 15 22:28:22 2015 UTC,"True. If you're unhappy with the quality, they guarantee your refund. So it's a moot point. Like you said, they get the job done."
CHIBears,3dfgum,ACSimeon,2,Wed Jul 15 23:01:37 2015 UTC,"Do you have to pay shipping back to China, or do they just refund your money?"

So I disputed the order, then they refunded my money and I gave the Hull jersey to my nephew."

CHIBears,3de8ww,JaquiskiTaterTartt,7,Wed Jul 15 16:15:42 2015 UTC,"That's pretty shallow analysis, IMO.  Kyle Long is obviously one of the top 3 Bears.  Tim Jennings is nowhere close, and Matt Slauson and Jeremiah Ratliff should be in that also considered section, IMO.    I'd go with Forte 1, Long 2, and either Jeffery or Bennett 3, probably Jeffery."
CHIBears,3de8ww,BearDownChicagoBears,3,Wed Jul 15 17:02:21 2015 UTC,"So it's pretty shallow but you have 2 of the same top 3, the 3rd of which they listed as an alternate? It sounds to me like it's dead on."
CHIBears,3de8ww,GodIsTheSun,4,Wed Jul 15 17:21:33 2015 UTC,"It leaves out Kyle Long, who was probably the best Bear last year.  I think you'll have a very difficult time finding anybody who actually watched the Bears last year intelligently saying any of those trio were better than Long, especially Jeffery (who really struggled through that hamstring injury, though he still put up volume numbers) and Bennett (who put up big numbers but had some attitude/effort problems).    It also completely ignores Slauson and Ratliff, and still mentions Tim Jennings, who has been awful for the last 1.5 years.  Basically whoever wrote this looked at skill position guys who put up big numbers and then threw out a couple other big names as also considered."
CHIBears,3de8ww,BearDownChicagoBears,2,Wed Jul 15 17:34:35 2015 UTC,Lol how does it leave out Long? He's right there. The skill positions are called skill positions for a reason. Ratliff is going to be phased out by younger dlinemen this year. Slauson was out more than half of last season and is not more important than Long.   I don't have any problem listing the players who are needed to score as most important
CHIBears,3de8ww,GodIsTheSun,2,Wed Jul 15 17:38:25 2015 UTC,"This isn't about most important, it's about ""best."" I question the depth of research the writer did if he thinks Bennett or Jeffery are better at what they do than Long at what he does.    And again, listing Tim Jennings there implies he's one of the 5-6 best players on the Bears, which is nowhere close to true.    This is a list done for all 32 NFL teams by one person.  The quality of analysis for the Bears leaves something to be desired, IMO.  Seems to me like it's based on stats/name recognition more than actual film study."
CHIBears,3de8ww,BearDownChicagoBears,2,Wed Jul 15 17:43:48 2015 UTC,I don't think being based on stats and name recognition is a bad thing or wrong at all though.
CHIBears,3de8ww,GodIsTheSun,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:36:28 2015 UTC,"Value was taken into consideration, just not so heavily to where quarterbacks would be atop every list, that would be lame. How good they are projected to be was also a factor, though I made sure my personal opinions on breakout stars or guys that I believe will drop off a ton did not affect the list too much cuz next season has yet to happen. By that I mean how they are trending (positively or negatively) mattered but it was not the overwhelming factor.  On the front page it states, ""The value of the player, their position and role on the team, is taken into consideration, but not so heavily to where quarterbacks will top every team. The rankings are based on how good they are currently and how good they project to be next year, so older players will generally be a bit lower. I will not include rookies, as that would be too much projection.""  Jennings is old, but I'm expecting a bounce-back year from him. The secondary as a whole struggled due to the lack of pass rush. Guys like Kyle Fuller and Ryan Mundy are talented but still had a rough time for much of last year. The secondary as a whole should look much better than last year with the addition of McPhee and the scheme change. Fangio knows how to generate pressure.  This list specifically only contains the NFC teams, thus only 16. I know, that's an arbitrary thing to point out. However, if you look at some of the other pages, name recognition is certainly not the leading factor.  Slauson is a good starter, but nothing more. I don't see him trending upwards or downwards, rather, his play should stay at the same level. I like Ratliff and I have him starting as a defensive end (some say Jenkins will play over him). However, we have not seen him play in a 3-4 since the Cowboys ran one. He is older now, at 33 years old age and is unlikely to trend upwards. If there is one thing that looks to work out for him it's that he is playing under Fangio. I'm a big fan of him, being a 49ers fan."

CHIBears,3daogs,LeRawxWiz,3,Wed Jul 15 04:05:45 2015 UTC,"no, I don't think so.  Lovie largely handed off offensive responsibilities, and kept defense and special teams under his control.  Orton had a ceiling, and they traded him at a pretty good time for the best return on investment imo.  The question is, was that ceiling high enough, and that defense good enough to get a ring if they held on to him for a year or two... idk"
CHIBears,3daogs,OMG_Ponies,6,Wed Jul 15 05:01:41 2015 UTC,I don't mean the trade... I meant the PAINFUL years of Rex starting ahead of him.
CHIBears,3daogs,LeRawxWiz,2,Wed Jul 15 06:33:48 2015 UTC,"Orton was terrible his rookie year.  Barely over 50% completion, just over 1800 yards in 15 starts, more INTs than TDs.  Those are close to Tebow numbers.  Orton becoming a viable short-term starter was a nice surprise; there was no reason to believe he'd be a better starter than Rex or Griese prior to him getting desperation starts at the end of 2007, and even then he didn't set the world on fire."

CHIBears,3ddf3w,StSeabass,-6,Wed Jul 15 15:34:00 2015 UTC,The picture is of how douchy his license plate is. So saying he would do the same implies that he would get a plate too. Perhaps I'm reading too into it. It's really not a thing to discuss. I'm kinda glad the Bears don't do that honestly. Because we would be just as insufferable as the Packers fans who claim ownership of the team. We would do the same thing except then the Packers fans would have the fact that their team is better so they are better owners and it would become this whole thing. So.... Yeah:

The cost of tickets + concessions + hotel + travel + parking quickly adds up to a ridiculous amount.  Sure I could usually find some 4th level or endzone seats cheaper, but I'd rather just watch the game on TV at that point.    This year, I took a different approach. I called Tampa Bay's ticket office before their single-game tickets officially went on sale and bought 10 tickets (thus qualifying as a group sale) for the Bears/Bucs game on December 27th.  I ended up with second level seats for something like $60 per ticket, and now me, some family  and friends will be flying to sunny Tampa to watch the Bears defeat Lovie once again as part of a mini-Christmas vacation.

When they arrived deputies spoke to the caller and learned three boys had been fishing on the beach when the suspect, later identified as Buffalo Bills Offensive Line Coach Aaron Kromer, and the suspect’s son confronted them over the use of beach chairs left by a beach access.   Victims told deputies Kromer grabbed their fishing pole and threw the pole into the water and then pushed one of the boys to the ground and punched him in the face. It was stated Kromer then told the boys to return the chairs to where they found them.   The victim stated Kromer also told him if he reported him to the police he would kill his family.

CHIBears,3d27ki,bigben929,4,Mon Jul 13 23:19:02 2015 UTC,"Here's the thing with Conte. He did that dive like 20 times a year. When it worked, which was rare, you got that amazing play. When it didn't, you got him getting beat by the packers in week 17."
CHIBears,3d27ki,Antitypical,8,Mon Jul 13 17:36:22 2015 UTC,"Isn't this a dead conversation? Isn't it common knowledge now that there was a miscommunication between Tucker and Briggs that ended up leaving Conte in man coverage when it was supposed to be zone?  Conte screwed up a bunch throughout his time in Chicago, but let that one go, because that one wasn't on him. Also, he had to make like the most touchdown-saving tackles in the league over the last two years. Free safeties are supposed to be coverage first, but when your front 7 lets everyone through and makes it so that you have to play run first, you're going to get burned in coverage a couple times."

CHIBears,3cxfqq,bwkrayb,9,Sun Jul 12 21:09:08 2015 UTC,Soo what happened to the Buddy Ryan 46 defense?
CHIBears,3cxfqq,EsquireKing,16,Sat Jul 11 19:58:33 2015 UTC,"Mostly, the West Coast Offense.  Run properly, the passes come out too fast for the pass rush to get there, and with so many on the line the 46 can struggle to get back in time to cover quick hitters.  It is no coincidence that the 49ers beat Ditka's Bears in both NFC Championship losses, nor that Dan Marino - who had a very quick release - was the one to beat the '85 team.  There was also a change in offensive philosophy.  The 46 was designed to stop the run and medium-to-long passes.  The NFL began to move away from run-heavy schemes and fell in love with short passes, so the 46 was solving a problem that no longer existed."
CHIBears,3cxfqq,Crathsor,2,Sat Jul 11 23:22:02 2015 UTC,Is there a defense designed  to stop the short passes nowadays that's as dominate as the 46 was with the run?
CHIBears,3cxfqq,EsquireKing,24,Sat Jul 11 23:44:51 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure that's even possible.  In the days of the 46 vs the run you were taking away all their holes and cutback lanes, so they were often left with no choice but to fail.  Offensive plays today are so flexible that if the offense reads the defense correctly, they usually have a tweak or option available that will work against what you're doing.  The game has just changed too much to allow defensive dominance like that.  Hybrid defenses and the weird fronts that Rex Ryan uses are actually using some of the same principles as the 46 though, namely disguising what you're doing so thoroughly that it's really hard to read and the offense makes mistakes.  I think that's about the best you can do now:  try to cause bad reads."
CHIBears,3cxfqq,Crathsor,9,Sun Jul 12 00:01:28 2015 UTC,Damn that was a well thought out answer  Thanks for the knowledge
CHIBears,3cxfqq,EsquireKing,2,Sun Jul 12 00:29:11 2015 UTC,Both Rex and Rob have said they run the 46 out of their 3-4 alignments. I've also read Jeff Fisher still uses parts of it as does Frazier and some others.
CHIBears,3cxfqq,Sks44,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:48:44 2015 UTC,Maybe early years of the Tampa 2? Corners take away the flats and get pressure up the middle.
CHIBears,3cxfqq,mushperv,1 point,Sun Jul 12 22:49:52 2015 UTC,"The Tampa 2 punishes mistakes but I don't feel like it really forces them like the 46 did.  Since 1982, there have been three teams with 70+ sacks.  The Bears 46 was two of them.  46 also had a couple 60+ years.  Best Tampa Bay team had 55, they were generally in the 40s.  I readily agree that sacks aren't the end-all, be-all stat for pass rushing, but I think a difference that large indicates a gap in the pressure being exerted, and it was that unrelenting pressure that led to the dominance the Bears had for a few years there.  Everything you tried to do, there was at least one Bear in your backfield.  The Tampa 2 isn't usually even trying to get pressure on that level (for good reason - modern offenses feast when you're overly aggressive.)"
CHIBears,3cxfqq,Crathsor,3,Mon Jul 13 00:18:27 2015 UTC,"With modern 5 yard rules, the defense can't really take away the short pass."

CHIBears,3cxfqq,BuffyTheUmpireSlayer,0,Mon Jul 13 06:55:47 2015 UTC,"The Tampa-2 was considered the offense that cause problems for the WCO. An athletic middle linebacker and two safeties could basically create a cloud in the field that took away the quick hitting slants,hitches and outs."
CHIBears,3cxfqq,Sks44,3,Mon Jul 13 17:46:49 2015 UTC,iirc the spread pretty much tore it apart.
CHIBears,3cxfqq,chiefos,2,Sat Jul 11 21:53:07 2015 UTC,Playing 8 guys in the box isn't a great plan against a spread offence
CHIBears,3cxfqq,hlainelarkinmk2,1 point,Sat Jul 11 22:50:53 2015 UTC,"Essentially this:  1) It, like many defenses, is very personnel specific. You need two corners who can single cover well. You need a safety that can act as an extra linebacker while not being a complete loss in coverage. You need linebackers who can pass rush and you need defensive linemen that can play multiple positions. The Bears had 3 HoF players at important positions plus excellent players that fit the system at others.   The corners are super important because, if you don't get a QB hit or pressure, your corners are most likely going to have one deep safety for help.  2) Rule changes didn't help. When your defense has a huge component of multiple hits on the QB every chance you get, flags will be thrown. Also, holding became much more allowed as the NFL became more pass happy.   3) Bill Walsh and Joe Gibbs re-designed offenses solely to beat it. Those two were geniuses and, in Bill Walsh's case, he had a QB in Montana that was perfect to beat a blitz-happy system. Montana made reads faster than anyone thought possible and was athletic.   4) You need coaches who can call blitzes well. Half of it is knowing how to blitz and when.  5) People talk of the 46 as a QB crushing system but it was very good against the run. The NFL began shifting to pass-first and shotgun heavy offenses. That means running isn't as important and the shotgun gives the QB a wee bit of extra space to make a read.   That being said, many teams still use versions of the 46, especially 3-4 teams. Personally, I think the 46 would work real well in college against read option teams."

CHIBears,3csdvt,Jebbu,1 point,Fri Jul 10 14:57:37 2015 UTC,"This pretty much sums up what we as Bears fans already know. And as witnessed on the top 100, his peers recognizes this as well.

It's hard to say how good he really is.  Lynch was barely a thousand yard guy in Buffalo; moved to Seattle and now he's elite.  The team matters a lot.  I'm not really arguing with you, to be clear."

CHIBears,3cq249,sulandra,1 point,Sun Jul 12 17:57:47 2015 UTC,6-10.  Losing season.  Last year of Forte in a Bears uniform.  Pace probably makes some moves on the defensive side of the ball ahead of the trade deadlin once Vic Fangio figures out what he has (uses the first half of the season to figure out who can play where).    Cutler another middling/poor year with flashes of a strong arm in certain plays.  It gives enough for his last holdout / defenders to be happy and blame WRs like Kevin White for being a rookie in key interceptions (the blame placed on Santonio Holmes for interception or w/e last year was laughable).  I see the Bears in last place in the NFC North.  I don't think the team is truly competitive until 2017 really.

Long is the jersey I'd go for if I'm looking for the surest bet of the dude staying on the team. Even if you like somebody who is retired, you can still probably wear their jersey around with pride if they were a great player. Nobody is going to give you flak for wearing a Payton or Butkus jersey. If you're at a game you might shy away from wearing a Hester or Urlacher since they're in recent memory (and Hester is still in the NFL), but it's still a show of pride and support to the team."

With older guys like Payton and Butkus, they are out of that recent memory and to the team that are much more just symbols of ""The Bears."" Urlacher is too recent to be in that crowd and too late to be just honoring his career after his retirement. I'm probably over-thinking this.   I'm certainly not saying that you shouldn't wear an Urlacher jersey to games. It's more that if you are looking to buy one jersey for this purpose and Urlacher isn't a clear choice, then I would consider other names first."

CHIBears,3cqe6n,LastMileHome,1 point,Sat Jul 11 14:44:22 2015 UTC,"Sure. I had a similar situation when Alshon had not played a snap in the NFL as yet. I thought I'd be a hipster and get his jersey before the season started because I was so sure he was going to pan out. And he did.   After watching him as an SEC fan, I had a strong feeling he would come in and put up numbers like similarly heralded SEC WRs of that time in Julio and AJ.   Still, I never pulled the trigger on it, but I get the same feeling from White. There's just too much talent for him to not get at least 700-800 yards this season. I think he'll do just that and more.   And considering how he's still a rookie, I think we have a good 4+ seasons with him before we worry about unloading him in case he doesn't pan out or something.   Just my personal experience. I have the same feeling for White that I did with Alshon. Granted, Alshon got hurt his rookie year, but after that he's become a top WR."

CHIBears,3col60,bluntsncuntss,63,Fri Jul 10 17:41:09 2015 UTC,"They should emphasize the ""effort"" part of this article. Look back at last years Dolphins game. Marshall was the only one putting the effort in. When an INT was thrown, he ran down the intercepting player when everyone else just said... ""Fuck it. Its a TD."". Marshall is constantly training off season and tries to motivate others to do the same. The guy gave us a lot as a player."
CHIBears,3col60,Xarddrax,16,Thu Jul 9 15:35:35 2015 UTC,"yeah, it might be a gain in the locker room, but there's no denying the positive benefits Marshall brought on the field."

CHIBears,3col60,juicyja,18,Wed Jul 15 15:48:51 2015 UTC,It'll be interesting to see what kind of influence Jeffery will have on White. Hopefully he can be positive an impact as Marshall had on him.
CHIBears,3col60,totaldebacle,11,Thu Jul 9 15:23:31 2015 UTC,"Everything I've read is that White was the hardest worker at WVU so I don't think he'll lose his focus, and I've been encouraged seeing pictures of him with Cris Carter and the like soaking things in.  Think the Bears have a younger, faster, Marshall on their hands."
CHIBears,3col60,strifeblood,5,Thu Jul 9 17:03:36 2015 UTC,"Even if White has mediocre rookie season, I'd still be glad we drafted him because of what he'll do for this offense. I think it'll be better for our offense to have Jeffery, White and Royal because it'll keep defenses honest. While Marshall and Jeffery are a great receiving duo, they're too similar. Big and strong possession type receivers who can get any jump ball. They couldn't get any separation because neither of them have amazing speed. I think White and Royal will be much better for us than having Marshall since defenses will know also be on the lookout for a play over the top."
CHIBears,3col60,strifeblood,8,Thu Jul 9 18:42:32 2015 UTC,"nobody was complaining about them being too similar in 2013, when they were both healthy and dominating.  It became a problem in 2014, when they were both playing hurt and the rest of the WRs on the roster were garbage."
CHIBears,3col60,Crathsor,4,Thu Jul 9 19:12:48 2015 UTC,"You could also argue that was because defenses didn't have an offseason to gameplan against the duo. Jeffery was decent his rookie year, but didn't set the league on fire. Same reason Trestman's offenses always get worse his second year, why the wildcat lasted one season and why the read option isn't dominating anymore. You have to mix it up in the modern NFL because otherwise defenses will figure you out. No doubt a big factor was their health, but that's not the only factor."
CHIBears,3col60,totaldebacle,1 point,Thu Jul 9 21:51:13 2015 UTC,"Well, Trestman's offenses always getting worse the second year is false; that argument was both misleading and factually incorrect.  I think the offensive line's health was a bigger factor, actually; we got part of one game with a healthy starting five.  Hard for a receiver to excel when the playcaller is scared to run anything but screens."
CHIBears,3col60,HIGHHAMMER,1 point,Sat Jul 11 04:35:24 2015 UTC,"Agreed, that plus a coach with a willingness to mix it up with the run a bit more should help out that side of the ball tremendously."

He wants to do TV in NY, Pace and Fox said no, B is now IN New York.    Not the reason he left.  But it's in keeping with your persistently inaccurate understanding of Brandon Marshall.    A year ago, you were saying the cooling of the Cutler/Marshall relationship was basically overblown by the media.  Today, Marshall is on another team, Cutler and Marshall aren't speaking, and Marshall wouldn't even call Cutler as one of his best teammates.  Incorrect much?"
CHIBears,3col60,RogueEyebrow,3,Thu Jul 9 20:15:15 2015 UTC,"You make me out as a Marshall hater. That is not the case. At all. Who really gives a flying fuck if Marshall thinks Jay was one of his best team mates. Their history was always rocky. Buddies? Sure, even in Denver they had problems and it extended to when B was in Miami. In the game against Chicago, he tried to start shit with Jay. Not a huge deal but still.  Also, all-knowing one, what was the reason for Marshall leaving? I don't know ALL the reasons but if he was unwilling to adhere to the rules set by the new staff, including out of area television appearances regularly, I see can see that playing a factor.  In the end, I'm not a Marshall basher. I loved him here and he is still a great player I look forward to seeing play. However, it is time for us to move forward and quit lingering on this issue. Marshall is not here. Love they guy, but he is gone. Sorry"
CHIBears,3col60,sulandra,8,Fri Jul 10 16:31:00 2015 UTC,"When he's calling out Matt Forte, the only dude who managed to score that day, for ""not trying hard enough,"" it's a little tough for me to defend Marshall."
CHIBears,3col60,RogueEyebrow,6,Thu Jul 9 19:02:11 2015 UTC,Not sure I understand your logic..  Scoring is not where Forte slacked off.  It's in blocking.  He is one of the worst blocking RBs in the league for a reason.
CHIBears,3col60,Joliet_Jake_Blues,-1,Thu Jul 9 19:45:40 2015 UTC,"The context was the Dolphin's game last year.  Forte scored two touchdowns, the only points scored that day, aside from Gould's PATs.

CHIBears,3col60,Zanios74,1 point,Fri Jul 10 02:56:27 2015 UTC,Love Marshall one of the greatest talents at receiver the Bears or I have seen. However I think it was right moving on. He was a great leader but the team and its young players need to be hearing from Fox and the coaches. Also when you are implementing this new culture you need to eliminate things such as a player traveling to New York to film a weekly television show. Not that I believe it hurt the team necessarily but players need to understand where the team needs to be headed and the culture.

Bennet shows up to Cutler led camp that Jeffrey didn't attend, because he likely scheduled his workout with Marshall before Marshall was even traded.  New Headline: Jeffrey ""skips"" Cutler camp.  What about the fact that Cutty is leading a camp? Does that demonstrate leadership? Or maybe he's on the outs with the Bears, because he only invites brand new teammates and bad guy Bennet.

CHIBears,3cknap,tomseymour12,8,Thu Jul 9 00:46:10 2015 UTC,ITT: People who didn't read the article and are bashing it because of the title. It is just a matter of fact title. It says what happened. If you read the article the author says it's not a big deal because Alshon credits Marshall with being his mentor. He also says that his own article is typical mid-offseason fluff. Because he doesn't have anything else to write about. He says this doesn't matter and people can't say anything about the relationship between Alshon and Cutler due to this.

CHIBears,3cknap,QEDomelets,-3,Thu Jul 9 04:47:30 2015 UTC,"LOL.  Without googling it, can you tell me what his position was, and who holds that position with the Bears?  Yeah, I'm sure the fans were really upset about losing a guy they'd never heard of.  Ryan Pace was a nobody.  He didn't even have a wikipedia page until the day he was hired by the Bears.  (And I think the Saints are a little more worried about how their FO didn't manage payroll properly and they needed to dump anyone with talent to get under the salary cap.)"
CHIBears,3cknap,Joliet_Jake_Blues,2,Thu Jul 9 05:00:16 2015 UTC,"He was director of player personnel most recently. Anyways, why do you feel the need to quiz me? One of my good friends is a huge Saints fan and the day we hired Pace I asked him his opinion on Pace, and he told me, ""You guys are lucky to have him...I'm upset he's gone"". He didn't say, ""well, I didn't really know him or know what he did"" or anything of the sort. He had a quick response about Pace, and that speaks volumes for what Pace did for the Saints, knowing that his grandest title was Director of Player Personnel.  Nobody on this sub appreciates the kind of blatant pessimism and distaste towards Pace that you're expressing. There's a respectable way to go about it, but it's hard for you to see that from the horse you're sitting so high on."

Even if White is as good as Marshall, that means we traded the #7 pick for a 5th round pick.  Pace is fucking clueless."
CHIBears,3cknap,Joliet_Jake_Blues,3,Thu Jul 9 05:35:48 2015 UTC,"Bro you're embarrassing yourself. All you've done is shit talk Pace and the only thing you've said he did wrong was the Marshall trade. He traded an aging and somewhat expensive player for a draft pick.   You said it yourself. We are probably going to be bad this year. We would have been bad with Marshall, too. So why not get what you can out of him and shed some salary? Would you rather go 7-9 and still miss the playoffs? No.   Pace is rebuilding. That might not be fun for guys like you, who clearly don't understand the concept. What good would Marshall have done for us on a losing team?"

CHIBears,3clesn,mmuell31,12,Wed Jul 8 20:37:12 2015 UTC,"I think at this point we get Jay Cutler. He's not an elite quarterback. But he's not a bad one either. He's going to give us games like the ones against the 49ers and Falcons, and occasionally Jay's gonna shit the bed just because he's human. He's gonna let us down more than an Aaron Rodgers or even a Russel Wilson, but that's part of having an average guy at the most important position. After acknowledging that, it's important to not just say ""this is Jay's last chance, if he doesn't play lights out cut him!"" because he IS the best quarterback the Bears have ever had (by a pretty substantial margin), but its also equally important to not just keep him. The Bears should, and hopefully are, look for his replacement. Not look for his replacement after cutting him, but while we have him now. I guess what I'm saying is Jay should be our quarterback until someone beats him out of the job, because then we'll know we have something. The Bears shouldn't just walk away from him and try to find someone, because look how long it's taken the Browns, Raiders, and Jags to even find a halfway decent option. Just my two cents on the issue."
CHIBears,3clesn,rrtk77,3,Wed Jul 8 23:34:06 2015 UTC,"Yep. Agreed. Personally, I was never expecting Cutler to be an elite-level QB, even when he came here. I just wanted competence and an end to the carousel, so I'm pretty satisfied overall."
CHIBears,3clesn,ElectrosMilkshake,1 point,Thu Jul 9 19:37:21 2015 UTC,"I just wanted competence and an end to the carousel,   The problem is we really want more than that, but only a little. We want a QB we can not lose because of. Not necessarily one that will win us games, but Jay Cutler can often be a guy that can be why we lose. We want better than that and that is what he was supposed to be. I still remember when Denver drafted him and being hyped for him and I could really give a shit less about most rookies unless they are JJ Watt caliber. Otherwise, I care when players start making names. But Jay stood out. He was never expected to be a guy that will shit the bed so often. That is why he gets the shit he does."

CHIBears,3clesn,Chantertwo,8,Fri Jul 10 14:00:35 2015 UTC,"That was a pretty silly article. A bunch of stats with no explanation why they matter. I'll take just one as an example. Number of head coaches/OCs? That only matters if you already believe Cutler is a coach-killer. If you're a reasonable person though, you know that Cutler's Shanahan era ended because Josh McDaniels was a moron, his Lovie era ended because Lovie had reached his peak in Chicago, his Trestman era ended because Trestman was a moron, and we haven't gotten to see him and Fox work together. The importance (or non-importance in this case) of the author's stats could be deconstructed easily, but the author didn't spend two minutes doing it."

CHIBears,3ckipy,QEDomelets,7,Thu Jul 9 05:02:27 2015 UTC,"I'll go against the grain and show my age, but a play that really would have enshrined the Bears in history forever took place in the 1942 NFL championship game. Winning that game would have made the Bears the last undefeated team in NFL history.  The play? Down 14-6 in the fourth quarter, the Bears mounted a 79-yard drive that took them to the Redskins’ one. An apparent touchdown by HB Hugh Gallarneau was nullified by a backfield-in-motion penalty. The Bears proceeded to turn the ball over on downs and in the end it was Washington running out the clock and coming away with the NFL Championship by a score of 14-6."

CHIBears,3ckipy,AdamWestsBomb,5,Wed Jul 8 22:05:17 2015 UTC,"I know this isn't close to the worst play in even the past 5 years but it's the one that hurts me the most, dammit.  Conte's blown coverage on that game winning toss by Rodgers with 30 seconds to go two seasons ago. It was crushing. Lost us the Division Title, the playoff berth, and I was watching it with a packers fan."

I felt as if Trestman was blatantly inept before that game, but that moment seemed to reveal a cruel joke we had just then been let in on."

CHIBears,3cihdd,_Shut_Up_Thats_Why_,6,Wed Jul 8 05:00:21 2015 UTC,"For everything Forte is great at, somehow his pass blocking ability has declined over the years. It will be interesting to see how Gase uses 'Quiz, because Forte is such a threat receiving. Although 'Quiz is no slouch receiving as a back either...should be fun."
CHIBears,3cihdd,Headwallrepeat,1 point,Wed Jul 8 05:14:45 2015 UTC,For years he was one of the best blocking backs in the league. I wonder if the past couple years he was being asked to do more than a running back should with our shoddy O-line. If we are better at getting him the ball on the ground instead of the air I could see his blocking increase.
CHIBears,3cihdd,e39,1 point,Wed Jul 8 21:50:25 2015 UTC,Line Forte up outside and let the defense try and figure it out.
CHIBears,3cihdd,RogueEyebrow,3,Fri Jul 10 03:02:02 2015 UTC,"The Gase offense requires bodies at the running back position.   Considering the possible Forte holdout (when Rodgers was signed), it was a smart move by Pace to bring players in. You couldn't put the entire load on an untested Ka'deem Carey."

CHIBears,3cihdd,rblumenfeld76,2,Wed Jul 8 12:20:21 2015 UTC,"Do the Bears still have a Fullback on the roster? The last Fullback I remember on the roster was Tony Fiametta, but he's gone and I don't remember there being a replacement. I see we let go of Montell Owens but I never even heard of him.  I could see Forte and Rodgers in the backfield simultaneously."

Conversely, if you're in the area, you can hit me up and we'll go to a bar where you can actually sit and have a beer and watch a Bears game, but it's filled with very very very disillusioned Dolphin fans and it's ridiculously entertaining to watch them (they're a good group of people, a bit obnoxious, but hey, it's a bar on a football Sunday). My friends and I all get drunk and start shit with them and at the end of the day we say: ""Good day, see you next Sunday"" ... and we repeat this for 16 weeks."
