lowpoly2d,3dwvkv,sixstringshred,2,Mon Jul 20 05:07:52 2015 UTC,Really well done. I would take it to photoshop and try making individual polys more distinct from another just to give it more of an isometric look.

lowpoly2d,3dm5lf,Ninej,1 point,Sat Jul 18 00:52:24 2015 UTC,My thoughts exactly. Still a good looking piece though.
lowpoly2d,3dm5lf,bay0network,2,Sat Jul 18 04:04:50 2015 UTC,I'm sure you've just used a filter in Photoshop and then made the eyes and nose black...

lowpoly2d,3ai9x7,crrfrfr,2,Sat Jun 20 18:27:21 2015 UTC,"A red crowned crane   On getting started with watercolor poly: Start your work with a pencil  outline of what you want to make. If you are a beginner, practice by tracing pictures of any subject (animals, cars, bananas, whatever) using the least amount of straight lines, while maintaining the shape of the subject. Once you have your outline it's easy to start with the fun part, which is to draw in and then colorize your ""polygons"". :)  If you meant what materials you need to get started: Some (cheap) watercolors or inks (I use liquid watercolors), watercolor paper (needs to be absorbant) and some watercolor brushes."

It bothers me that the shapes are touching seamlessly and then in some areas  (like most of the jacket) and not others. The gaps in the hair and face are distracting.

lowpoly2d,3026zl,JustinKeenan,8,Mon Mar 23 21:44:49 2015 UTC,Great job for a first try! What program did you use to make this?  As for feedback: you could try to use smaller polygons in certain areas to retain some of the shading of the original image. A little trick I like to use is to imagine what the subject would look like as a 3d model and then draw on the polygons like that. (In your image that would look something like this). But basically just closely follow the contours/shading of the image and you'll be a pro in no time :) edit: spelling

lowpoly2d,2zqch8,Finejake,5,Fri Mar 20 19:24:23 2015 UTC,"Consider the shape and contour of the object you're trying to ""mesh"". You picked a fairly round and symmetrical object, so unfortunately, you end up with a lot of very similar equilateral triangles which might've gotten a little boring after a while.  On the other hand, take the famous bird whose body has a lot of long, narrow feathers. If you were to actually mesh it, it'd involve a lot of long narrow triangles. I try to imagine what the mesh would look like in 3 dimensions, and project that into a 2D plane (starting with the biggest polygons and working outwards)."

lowpoly2d,2uo641,ExtraSaucess,2,Tue Feb 3 20:36:55 2015 UTC,"I think you should have add more triangles in that part, so it would shade naturally. The reason there's the jagged edges is because of the sudden transition from black to white. I think, anyways."

If you're looking for pointers for improvement, I've listed a few below. (I'm not a pro but work a little photoshop in school. This is just my observation.)   There is little contrast between the reindeer head and the background (same colours, different hue). hence, it doesn't stand out as much as it should. There are gaps between the faces, but of course this will improve with practice. Unless it was intentional, the horns look very 2D. Maybe some form of drop shadow would make it look better.   Either ways, well done!"

I mirrored it do I only had to do half of the work and I wanted it to be symmetrical. Okay now to the background. Originally I was going to have chrome and lime green like a Forrest setting but I thought it wouldn't be fitting since its on a plaque. So I thought to myself ""Hmm if I was a deer hunter and this was my best darn deer I ever shooten. Then where would I put it? Man cave.""

lowpoly2d,2paxtg,Drumsat1,4,Sun Dec 14 23:21:19 2014 UTC,"An excerpt from the book ""Sled Driver"" by former SR-71 pilot Brian Shul:   There were a lot of things we couldn't do in an SR-71, but we were the fastest guys on the block and loved reminding our fellow aviators of this fact. People often asked us if, because of this fact, it was fun to fly the jet. Fun would not be the first word I would use to describe flying this plane. Intense, maybe, even cerebral. But there was one day in our Sled experience when we would have to say that it was pure fun to be the fastest guys out there, at least for a moment.  It occurred when Walt and I were flying our final training sortie. We needed 100 hours in the jet to complete our training and attain Mission Ready status. Somewhere over Colorado we had passed the century mark. We had made the turn in Arizona and the jet was performing flawlessly. My gauges were wired in the front seat and we were starting to feel pretty good about ourselves, not only because we would soon be flying real missions but because we had gained a great deal of confidence in the plane in the past ten months. Ripping across the barren deserts 80,000 feet below us, I could already see the coast of California from the Arizona border. I was, finally, after many humbling months of simulators and study, ahead of the jet.  I was beginning to feel a bit sorry for Walter in the back seat. There he was, with no really good view of the incredible sights before us and tasked with monitoring four different radios. This was good practice for him for when we began flying real missions and when a priority transmission from headquarters could be vital. It had been difficult, too, for me to relinquish control of the radios, as during my entire flying career I had controlled my own transmissions. But it was part of the division of duties in this plane and I had adjusted to it. I still insisted on talking on the radio while we were on the ground, however. Walt was so good at many things, but he couldn't match my expertise at sounding smooth on the radios, a skill that had been honed sharply with years in fighter squadrons where the slightest radio miscue was grounds for beheading. He understood that and allowed me that luxury. Just to get a sense of what Walt had to contend with, I pulled the radio toggle switches and monitored the frequencies along with him. The predominant radio chatter was from Los Angeles Center, far below us, controlling daily traffic in their sector. While they had us on their scope (albeit briefly), we were in uncontrolled airspace and normally would not talk to them unless we needed to descend into their airspace.  We listened as the shaky voice of a lone Cessna pilot who asked Center for a read-out of his ground speed. Center replied: ""November Charlie 175, I'm showing you at ninety knots on the ground."" Now the thing to understand about Center controllers was that whether they were talking to a rookie pilot in a Cessna, or to Air Force One, they always spoke in the exact same, calm, deep, professional tone that made one feel important. I referred to it as the ""Houston Center voice."" I have always felt that after years of seeing documentaries on this country's space program and listening to the calm and distinct voice of the Houston controllers, that all other controllers since then wanted to sound like that and that they basically did. And it didn't matter what sector of the country we would be flying in, it always seemed like the same guy was talking. Over the years that tone of voice had become somewhat of a comforting sound to pilots everywhere. Conversely, over the years, pilots always wanted to ensure that, when transmitting, they sounded like Chuck Yeager, or at least like John Wayne. Better to die than sound bad on the radios.  Just moments after the Cessna's inquiry, a Twin Beech piped up on frequency, in a rather superior tone, asking for his ground speed in the Beech. ""I have you at one hundred and twenty-five knots of ground speed."" Boy, I thought, the Beechcraft really must think he is dazzling his Cessna brethren.  Then out of the blue, a navy F-18 pilot out of NAS Lemoore came up on frequency. You knew right away it was a Navy jock because he sounded very cool on the radios. ""Center, Dusty 52 ground speed check."" Before Center could reply, I'm thinking to myself, hey, Dusty 52 has a ground speed indicator in that million-dollar cockpit, so why is he asking Center for a read-out? Then I got it, ol' Dusty here is making sure that every bug smasher from Mount Whitney to the Mojave knows what true speed is. He's the fastest dude in the valley today, and he just wants everyone to know how much fun he is having in his new Hornet. And the reply, always with that same, calm, voice, with more distinct alliteration than emotion: ""Dusty 52, Center, we have you at 620 on the ground."" And I thought to myself, is this a ripe situation, or what? As my hand instinctively reached for the mic button, I had to remind myself that Walt was in control of the radios. Still, I thought, it must be done in mere seconds we'll be out of the sector and the opportunity will be lost. That Hornet must die, and die now. I thought about all of our Sim training and how important it was that we developed well as a crew and knew that to jump in on the radios now would destroy the integrity of all that we had worked toward becoming. I was torn.  Somewhere, 13 miles above Arizona, there was a pilot screaming inside his space helmet. Then, I heard it the click of the mic button from the back seat. That was the very moment that I knew Walter and I had become a crew. Very professionally, and with no emotion, Walter spoke: ""Los Angeles Center, Aspen 20, can you give us a ground speed check?"" There was no hesitation, and the replay came as if it was an everyday request.  ""Aspen 20, I show you at one thousand eight hundred and forty-two knots, across the ground."" I think it was the forty-two knots that I liked the best, so accurate and proud was Center to deliver that information without hesitation, and you just knew he was smiling. But the precise point at which I knew that Walt and I were going to be really good friends for a long time was when he keyed the mic once again to say, in his most fighter-pilot-like voice: ""Ah, Center, much thanks, we're showing closer to nineteen hundred on the money.""  For a moment Walter was a god. And we finally heard a little crack in the armor of the Houston Center voice when L.A. came back with, ""Roger that Aspen. Your equipment is probably more accurate than ours. You boys have a good one."" It all had lasted for just moments, but in that short, memorable sprint across the southwest the Navy had been flamed, all mortal airplanes on frequency were forced to bow before the King of Speed, and more importantly, Walter and I had crossed the threshold of being a crew. A fine day's work. We never heard another transmission on that frequency all the way to the coast. For just one day, it truly was fun being the fastest guys out there.

Anyway I lost motivation and just live traced it to get paths and then used the live paint bucket to fill them, but this left solid white lines so I went over to photoshop, selected the white lines via select color range, and then filled the selection using content aware.

lowpoly2d,2mgx7i,markmeeks,3,Sun Nov 16 19:04:35 2014 UTC,"Cheers. The mesh was made first, probs best to look closely at the image rather than my less than perfect explanation! But it is a series of repeated crossing lines from I think 6 different angles, I actually started with making all lines over the art board, then pathfinding them all into the individual triangles. When later I realised I only had to make the one intersecting triangle shape you can see and duplicate. However, my first method allowed me to have slight variances in the different line stroke weights, some of them are almost imperceptible.  TL;DR: Some gumf about triangles."
lowpoly2d,2mgx7i,periscallop,2,Sun Nov 16 21:04:27 2014 UTC,Very cool effect. I really like the tesselated overlay.

lowpoly2d,2mf48z,RexRedstone,1 point,Sun Nov 16 05:00:32 2014 UTC,"I just used GIMP to finish everything up. Remove some background, take away some bits that fell outside the triangles, that sort of thing."
lowpoly2d,2mf48z,greenishcrayon,2,Sun Nov 16 05:44:28 2014 UTC,So majority of the hard work was done in Inkscape. Your one came out better than mine that used all GIMP

Very jazzy or like chaotic stained glass. The only part i really don't like is the top of the head: the topmost band is too large (makes it look flat instead of 3d).
lowpoly2d,2l3c75,periscallop,2,Mon Nov 3 20:02:43 2014 UTC,Your right it does look a bit flat on the top of his head. I suppose its a result of it grabbing the colors of the background. I did use the poly editor beta so its a one shot type deal. I'm totally new at this and was just having a bit of fun with the last three submissions. I assume I could get something with some more style and depth using illustrator and photoshop. Thanks for the comment :)

Since the fur is similarly colored, I was getting almost the same color for adjacent triangles.  I tried this by manually selecting triangles and then filling them with average color. This is a pretty cumbersome and slow process and doesn't work out that well.  I'm looking for any tools which can triangulate automatically, after selecting a certain boundary. For example, I make a boundary around the eyes and the program automatically fills it with random triangles. Similarly for other parts with details.  Thank you."
lowpoly2d,2j97f4,GareKon,1 point,Tue Oct 14 21:29:45 2014 UTC,"Your triangles are slightly too big, especially on the details of the face like the nose, mouth, and eyes. Those parts are what helps people recognize the picture that you're trying to recreate. As for automatic triangles there are a couple scripts people posted but mostly doing everything by hand would yield the best results so that you can correctly get the contours and shadows of the model to your best ability.

Regarding TheAdventureTimeWorm's comment about the image resize feature, you can disable this by un-ticking the Resize toggle under Display Mode. However, this is not required because if you would like to print your Triangulated image you only need to export the output as a PDF, which generates a Vector image for print, resizing and deconstruction as the triangles are kept as their own separate shape. =3  Note that the PDE version of the program is going to be much slower than the OS-specific versions. Generation speed also varies depending on the values set for Area and Quality (higher the values, the faster the render), the amount of colors in the image (the more chaotic the image the more triangles the program has to render), and the depth of the image (higher DPI means more pixels to account for and more triangles to render). A wallpaper sized image at 72DPI rendered at the default settings should generate rather quickly."

lowpoly2d,2gzf8u,Prst_,2,Sat Sep 20 21:40:32 2014 UTC,Please share your technique! This is awesome and i want to make one like this.
lowpoly2d,2gzf8u,khanhntq,2,Sun Sep 21 06:11:00 2014 UTC,"Here's how i did this. The 2 tools i use are Photoshop and Flash. Photoshop to prepare the image and add textures later and Flash for the vector drawing. I prefer Flash because it's simple and i'm used to it, but most people would choose to do vector drawing in Illustrator. The process is pretty similar, i think.   First i choose a nice photo to turn into low poly art. Best to do any corrections in color and contrasts etc in Photoshop now, so you can use the colors in the image when you do the vector drawing an coloring. Here are all the bitmaps i used for this picture. I resize the image to max. 600 pixels in height. At this size i can make a screenshot of my laptop screen at 100% magnification. Copy the image to a new layer in PS and choose 'edit'> 'puppet warp'. This will put a mesh of triangles on top of your picture. Take a screenshot of the image with the triangles copy the screenshot to a new layer, crop it so the whole photo is in frame > save for web. i now have my reference image Open Flash, make a new document with the dimensions of the photo i just saved. Import image to stage. Lock layer 1 (the layer with the photo) Add new layer, pick the line drawing tool. I have it snap to the nearest node, so it automatically will connect the lines. Start drawing triangles! I begin tracing the important details with little straight lines. These will become the sides of small triangles. In places with low or unimportant detail, i follow the guidelines of the puppet warp for larger triangles. See screenshot here After the image is filled with triangles, start filling each of them with the eye dropper tool and the paint bucket. In each triangle select the color that best represents the contents of that triangle with the eye dropper. Double click with the paint bucket to fill the triangle with that color. Rinse and repeat till the whole image is filled. This may take a while ;) After all triangles are filled, delete the lines. You end up with a picture made out of colored triangles; your low poly image. Like you see here Export the image at a good resolution (i ususally set it to 300 dpi) not everyone likes to do the next steps, but i like adding some textures to the low poly image. This is done in Photoshop. I like adding textures from a large folder of textures i have. Those are collected mainly from Flickr groups like these and googling for texture packs. The more subtle ones usually work the best. This image uses 3 different textures, one of them is a scan of a painting made by one of the kids in the picture. See the textures and a description of the blend modes and opacities here. There are also 2 adjustment layers. One for the levels of the black and white image to bring out a bit of the mid tones and one for vibrance on the paint texture.   That's it!"

Fix the alignment of the edges, it's very noticeable when they're not lined up correctly. This should really be one of your main concerns when it comes to graphic design. Meticulous attention to detail is absolutely crucial."

On an even more meta note, I'm willing to entertain many variations on the style. 2D low-poly will probably only go so far before we need to innovate it for it to remain interesting.

lowpoly2d,2bohwn,Theburritodebacle,2,Fri Jul 25 10:06:13 2014 UTC,Not bad for a first go! Only thing I'd say is that the ibis doesn't really stand out much from the background and the body shapes get lost a little with the background. Some things you can do to avoid this are either just leaving the background unpoly'd or make the background polys larger around the bird and give them more contrasting colors if that makes sense.

That and it'd probably be easier to do a clearer picture seeing as to how the back wheel and part of the body is covered by the dirt cloud. Love how low poly looks on cars though. <3"
lowpoly2d,2aeb8x,GareKon,1 point,Fri Jul 11 04:40:41 2014 UTC,"Yeah I was having issues with the grid halfway through it. I just said screw it and didn't snap to the corners anymore. I realized it was too big of a first project too far into it, so I just went with it. I agree a clearer picture would have been better, but I wanted it to be my phone background and I love rally, so of course I had to have dirt flying. Oh well, if I ever get ambitious I may try again."

I'm not going to discriminate as long as we can still make out polygons and people are upvoting.

I though that the brown of the grizzly would work better for the composition too.

lowpoly2d,287wo5,periscallop,1 point,Wed Jun 18 13:14:41 2014 UTC,Photoshop but used the cute low poly python applet that was listed on here. I have the raw svg from that and hires png.
lowpoly2d,285sqq,CatSand,3,Sat Jun 14 22:17:11 2014 UTC,"Just my opinion, but I think that Bruce was done extremely well, so it would be better if Dory and Marlin weren't low poly- it's nice to see a mix."
lowpoly2d,285sqq,-shrubs-,2,Sun Jun 15 04:51:21 2014 UTC,"Exactly what I thought. However, this is very cool nonetheless."
lowpoly2d,285sqq,onlinelauren,1 point,Sun Jun 15 07:20:07 2014 UTC,oh my goodness I love this
lowpoly2d,285r1k,MriBear,1 point,Sat Jun 14 21:53:06 2014 UTC,I love this! This is my new wallpaper!
lowpoly2d,285r1k,UnsolvedCypher,1 point,Sun Jun 22 20:59:09 2014 UTC,glad you liked it
lowpoly2d,28686q,BlackShadowRose,2,Sun Jun 15 01:48:48 2014 UTC,"I think it's really well done, only thing is it looks to me like she has a white hood on because her hair isn't separated from the background. The face is perfect though."
lowpoly2d,28686q,SweetShakes,1 point,Sun Jun 15 04:58:53 2014 UTC,"I can't un-see the white hood now, lol. You are right, I should fix that. Thank you btw!"
lowpoly2d,28597x,Hippomonkeyman,2,Sat Jun 14 18:10:33 2014 UTC,somebody?! Please?
lowpoly2d,28597x,Anaminus,2,Thu Jun 19 18:10:26 2014 UTC,I'm on it! Expect a youtube video in a few days.
lowpoly2d,284ksz,bokkerstylepik,1 point,Sat Jun 14 12:26:08 2014 UTC,Nice!! But...the numbers are in different colors. and the Nike sign is mirrored and on the wrong side on Robben's shirt...
lowpoly2d,284ksz,ZZtorb,1 point,Sat Jun 14 17:37:13 2014 UTC,Thats because in the original image he was wearing the older version of the shirt and i mirrored the image.
lowpoly2d,282xzq,wallabywrangler,2,Fri Jun 13 20:43:41 2014 UTC,"That's really cool, especially the eye looks awesome"
lowpoly2d,282xzq,kamby,2,Fri Jun 13 21:14:59 2014 UTC,Fantastic job!  The low poly really captures the viper.
lowpoly2d,282xzq,andrewia,2,Fri Jun 13 21:18:39 2014 UTC,Yesssssssss
lowpoly2d,282xzq,periscallop,2,Fri Jun 13 22:00:05 2014 UTC,You nailed this project
lowpoly2d,282xzq,lazysundays,2,Sat Jun 14 01:25:59 2014 UTC,Nice. I'd like to see what it looks like with a normal eye
lowpoly2d,282xzq,mtfreestyler,2,Sat Jun 14 02:49:01 2014 UTC,"ooooh I really like this one :)  I must say, I'm really happy about hot with sub is turning out :)"
lowpoly2d,282xzq,noppy_dev,2,Sat Jun 14 10:19:53 2014 UTC,This is really great! Awesome job.
lowpoly2d,282zhl,dezlim,4,Fri Jun 13 20:59:40 2014 UTC,That's a lot of poly. How long did this take?
lowpoly2d,282ys8,IIIstan,3,Fri Jun 13 20:52:30 2014 UTC,Looks great!
lowpoly2d,282ys8,SoooHappy,2,Sat Jun 14 01:53:14 2014 UTC,That's awesome.  Thanks!

lowpoly2d,282yrg,periscallop,1 point,Sat Jun 14 01:20:16 2014 UTC,Sorry if that came off as sarcastic. I really do like them haha. Good job
lowpoly2d,282yrg,JalapenoJohn,1 point,Sat Jun 14 02:35:28 2014 UTC,"haha its fine, its the logo for my network: www.aeryon.net   Just used that as a watermark."
lowpoly2d,280tri,REVOREV,2,Fri Jun 13 03:20:17 2014 UTC,I like this a lot. My only advice would be to clean up the hair that's sticking out at the top. I like the glasses and the hand in particular. The shirt I'm 50/50 as to whether it would look better simpler.
lowpoly2d,280tri,periscallop,1 point,Fri Jun 13 04:12:51 2014 UTC,"That apartment looks very familiar. You don't go to school at UT, do you?"
lowpoly2d,27zlye,echief,5,Thu Jun 12 19:22:11 2014 UTC,"The color palette is great, but the lightness/darkness of your polygons isn't consistent with the shape of a snake so it looks... misshapen. You can also tell that you started on the outside border with the double triangle pattern and got more liberal as you went towards the middle, which also contributes to it looking misshapen. Once again I love the color choice though!"
lowpoly2d,27zlye,nighght,0,Thu Jun 12 20:41:24 2014 UTC,Love the colors
lowpoly2d,27xea9,echief,3,Thu Jun 12 01:19:35 2014 UTC,"Awesome definitely one of my favorites , love the out of focus background in contrast with the sharp edges of the polygons ."
lowpoly2d,27xea9,tarkam,1 point,Thu Jun 12 02:20:31 2014 UTC,"Poly want a cracker? (also, nice job!)"
lowpoly2d,27wmsv,echief,4,Wed Jun 11 20:27:56 2014 UTC,"This is really awesome! Great job. Only suggestion is that if you're using Photoshop, just to fix up a bit of the fur that goes outside the shapes with the content-aware tool."
lowpoly2d,27wmsv,Hammington_Meowthews,1 point,Wed Jun 11 21:05:03 2014 UTC,what about Jacques the green cheeked condor?
lowpoly2d,27wuw5,NATALIE--PORTMAN,1 point,Wed Jun 11 21:45:46 2014 UTC,"You can easily make out the design of the horns! It's great. However, as I'm sure you can see, the polys are not perfectly aligned.  I'm not sure what program you're using (use the tags!), but if you're using illustrator you can fix it by selecting all of the lines that should meet in the same place, and  then using the align panel to align anchor points"
lowpoly2d,27wuw5,JalapenoJohn,1 point,Wed Jun 11 22:40:58 2014 UTC,"You did a really good job on lighting. However, I would positively suggest slightly smaller triangles, and more of them, to add detail"
lowpoly2d,27wuw5,Hippomonkeyman,1 point,Wed Jun 11 22:56:28 2014 UTC,"The misaligned polygons create a neat effect, but I would put a layer underneath them so (what I'm assuming is) the picture underneath doesn't show through."
lowpoly2d,27wuw5,periscallop,1 point,Thu Jun 12 00:24:55 2014 UTC,That's a good idea! I'll have to try that next time!
lowpoly2d,27ugju,mexicant123,3,Wed Jun 11 03:02:43 2014 UTC,big phoenix fan. nice work! :)
lowpoly2d,27ugju,Velocirapppptor,3,Wed Jun 11 05:16:59 2014 UTC,"I really love this, uses the low poly effect to portray depth perfectly. Keep it up!"
lowpoly2d,27ugju,tomarrell,2,Wed Jun 11 05:47:39 2014 UTC,Thanks a lot! I just started making stuff in Photoshop and your kind words help me :)
lowpoly2d,27ugju,redditsearcher,2,Wed Jun 11 06:17:49 2014 UTC,Love this album and this picture
lowpoly2d,27uv7h,JalapenoJohn,1 point,Wed Jun 11 06:23:31 2014 UTC,"Wow the mountain is pretty sweet! Loving the design, I found a new wallpaper!"
lowpoly2d,27uv7h,Sunny2456,1 point,Wed Jun 11 14:04:37 2014 UTC,"The face is very good, and I like the mountain too. Excellent contrast of detail with different sized polys. At first I thought the foreground of the mountain could use a little work, but then I realized it was the reflection of the mountain. Very nice. I think it's the eyes on the wolf that I don't like it as much."
lowpoly2d,27uv7h,periscallop,1 point,Wed Jun 11 16:24:55 2014 UTC,"Hey, it's the internet's busiest music nerd!   These all look great, by the way! Splendid work."
lowpoly2d,27uv7h,Cruxal_,1 point,Wed Jun 11 19:55:37 2014 UTC,I give it a strong 7 to a light 8
lowpoly2d,27ttbx,mexicant123,1 point,Tue Jun 10 22:44:50 2014 UTC,Its a good first start. It looks exactly like my first attempt before watching   this video that explains how to use the grid to make sure all of your triangles meet in the same place.
lowpoly2d,27ttbx,Bfreak,1 point,Wed Jun 11 00:45:59 2014 UTC,"Like Bfreak said, it's definitely a good starting point. I would suggest you clean up your anchors and focus on using less triangles in the more detailed areas, while less in the less detailed areas. Keep it up"
lowpoly2d,27ski6,bokkerstylepik,2,Tue Jun 10 15:41:10 2014 UTC,Nice job on getting poly size to indicate the 3D shape of the subject. What did you use for this?
lowpoly2d,27ski6,periscallop,2,Tue Jun 10 16:56:51 2014 UTC,Thanks!  I used Photoshop cs6
