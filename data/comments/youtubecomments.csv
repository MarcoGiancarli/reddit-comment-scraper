youtubecomments,3dauy0,NeonHD,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:07:45 2015 UTC,"This is actually very interesting, amongst all the spambots I've ever seen on YouTube, this is probably the most clever one I've seen so far.  So far my analogy is this: This particular spambot has an ""alpha"" account and posts a somewhat controversial comment on a video, then the initial comment from the alpha bot will suddenly trigger another bot to reply to the comment, and then that triggers another bot to reply to the first bot, and so on until it creates a massive chain of bots replying to bots that is replying to bots.  But here is the fascinating part, all the replies that the bots had sent usually consists of typical butthurt comments from random people who are sick and tiered of bots. This creates an illusion that makes us think that they are actual people replying to the alpha comment, but what's actually happening is that the bots are imitating the obvious replies that we ourselves would make, which are indeed being butthurt as in like ""STFU you spammer"" etc.  Tl;dr An alpha bot posts a comment that triggers a chain of replies from other bots, and the replies are full of obvious insults that us ""humans"" would write, thus creating an illusion that the bots are actually humans.

youtubecomments,2z52l1,fortyozjuicebox,13,Sun Mar 15 18:24:46 2015 UTC,"I think what we are starting to see is some hardy backlash against the anti masculinity spam from third wave feminists online and in the news and media. Did you see those ""No More!"" Anti domestic abuse ads aired during NFL football games? They were specifically targeted at men to foster the idea that any man can and will become abusive if given the chance, when in reality the domestic abuse rates are equally split between men and women. Its propaganda at its core, groupthink to the extreme. It will be interesting to see how these opposing views start to affect public policy in the US. You already see gender exclusive events (read: females only) held on public college campuses. The city of Toronto is already overrun with anti masculine culture. I believe the 21st century will be known for the rise of gender discrimination in policy and education. Watch your back, egalitarians. 3rd wave feminists don't want to compromise."
youtubecomments,2z52l1,LtCthulhu,2,Sun Mar 15 18:51:08 2015 UTC,"But...but.. I'm a feminist. I uploaded that because well if I believe in feminism that's what it means for all of us. Equality. Then again, I'm also a men's rights supporter. I mean, I guess I'm sounding pretty vague here, but my point was that hating feminism ain't the solution. You call yourself an egalitarian. That's awesome. Stand for what you believe in. But that also means that you do not undervalue someone else's stance on something that you might not know as much about. Just my two cents. I'm open to a reply. :)"
youtubecomments,2z52l1,themrme1,2,Sun Mar 15 19:00:20 2015 UTC,I've stopped using the term feminist and started using the term equalist to refer to my stance on the subject due to the negative image feminism has acquired today and because it gives a better idea of what my ideals are.

The word ""Feminist"" even means ""someone who supports women's rights"", which was all fine and dandy.. a hundred years ago. In today's society, in which women do have the right to vote and they do have full rights to pursue whatever occupation or position men can pursue, I prefer to use the term equalist because it, in and of itself, refers to someone who believes in equal rights, not just for both sexes but for all individuals, be they homosexual or heterosexual (or neither), black or white or Martian, for all I care. This does indeed make me a feminist, to a degree, but also homonist (menist? Whatever the antonym for feminist is)."

youtubecomments,2z52l1,Spacemanseeds,3,Sun Mar 15 19:40:27 2015 UTC,"I was very glad to have the chance of taking a feminism course, although it wasn't my first pick in my second semester of college (turned out to be my favorite class)  I learned a lot from the oppression that women used to face, along with some of the issues that they face today. It was very interesting because the only thing I grew up knowing is that women finally go the right to vote.....never knew about the glass ceiling, the controversies in abortion laws, oppurtunities, photoshopping in modeling, ideal beauty, etc.  One faithful day, a hardcover feminist was going on a rant. To sum up basically, she said women deserved more opportunities than men, which is when I stood up and told her:  ""You know, you're entitled to your beliefs, that's absolutely fine, but don't start trying to make your side the dominant sex. If you want equality, then fucking fight for equality! Don't try to justify yourself off of things that happened 30 years ago! (This was the section we were in, very early in the semester)""  That's where she stopped with her rant and really started to think differently.  Now as a male, I still don't understand why politically we are having such a debate over this. Pay everyone the same, treat everyone the same... I mean is it like we can't grow up? Like a sex defines us or how we treat people? Why aren't we more worried about our troops? Why aren't we more worried about the US economy?   Just my two cents...."
youtubecomments,2z52l1,rutabaga5,-5,Mon Mar 16 19:05:15 2015 UTC,Ahh the old anti-feminist circle jerk. Because all women want exactly the same things out of feminism. The majority of men are just as much to blame for the above things as women are.
youtubecomments,2z52l1,Lolzor,8,Mon Mar 16 00:17:55 2015 UTC,I am a feminist. This is not anti-feminist. This is pro-equality. I don't quite get the point you are making.

youtubecomments,2z52l1,Lolzor,0,Sun Mar 15 20:15:01 2015 UTC,"The youtube comment runs along the same lines as a very popular anti-feminist argument. The idea is that by telling women that they'll have to take an equal share of the bad things that effect men, they can discourage women from wanting equality in the first place. The people who make this argument are under the impression that feminism is really about taking rights away from men and giving them to women. By their logic, no woman would want to say join the army or split the bills. They think they've found a fatal flaw in feminism."

It was a T-shaped traffic signal (with 3 positions), invented by Garrett Morgan (a black inventor), that was more useable than other early traffic signals.

Garrett Morgan is always on that list even though his only two notable inventions (a traffic light and a gas mask) have been obsolete for nearly a century. I'm sure Mr. Morgan was a good, hard-working man, but I can see why someone would find it laughable that we still (kinda) honor him."

youtubecomments,2y994z,b4gelbites,0,Sat Mar 7 22:03:29 2015 UTC,"I'm not subscribed to any video subreddits and usally when I watch videos on YouTube, it's a few hours after they're uploaded, and to add to that, I don't read comments all that often. This is a first time for me seeing these.   The thing is that even if you consider them funny, people who don't reddit take those comments seriously and then whenever anyone mentions they reddit, they instantly label them as neckbeard, fedora-wearing fat virgins. I know because I've seen it, repeatedly. Taking jokes that people won't understand outside of a community can be harmful, even if it's not the intention.  Also, channels like these tend to attract a lot of idiotic pre-teens that just make YouTube comments painful to read, so I tend to take everything like it was written by literal 12 year olds. It helps to avoid feeding them."

Shedding between summer and winter still occurs for both types of dog though, but dogs with fur lose considerably larger percentages of their body covering than dogs with hair .  here is an article to read :)  http://www.vetinfo.com/dog-fur-hair-difference.html#b"

It is up to the discretion of the person with the pointy stick and usually wicked hair to decide how to interpret markings and context. It's more subjective than just taking things literally/at face value, which takes the magic out of it. Every performance of a piece should be different, personal, and emotive. No two people are going to get a score and see and hear the same two things, and that's always been the case, so there's not really a strict black and white case of 'right' and 'wrong'. 'Tasteful' and 'Distasteful', perhaps, but it's still so much more complicated than that!  source: is a M.D/Conductor. Yes even opinions are subjective wahoo.

The guy was either trolling or was straight up racist.   As a black person myself, I will say that I do believe that black (African) people tend to be more 'aggressive' than white (European) people, but that doesn't mean all black men beat their wives and are very violent. That's racist and straight up prejudice. Much of the police brutality against blacks is a result of this stupid idea.

It's like the Muslim post that's in the front page except this one is more relatable by the usual Internet YouTube warriors. The fact that 51 people agree with it is more disappointing."
youtubecomments,2ottdy,Brendever,14,Sat Dec 13 21:48:29 2014 UTC,"There's a lot to say about these comments and I'm afraid I'll give the wrong impression but I want to try anyway.  I agree with the first person, actually. If loud hate-spewing idiots keep trying to commandeer a movement, even if they are the extreme minority, then people are going to make negative associations with the movement. Furzkampf made that association.  I'm not yet personally decided on whether popular perception, intended or not, actually redefines the movement.  All the examples and scenarios that Furzkampf made are real or plausible and they need to be respected and understood. However, his persistent conclusion is that they are all the fault of feminism, which is misguided if you believe Phoebe's claim. Even if you think that the movement is defined by the vocal minority, then Pheobe clearly subscribes to some better ideology than that, yet Furzkampf is lashing out at her as though she is part of the problem when in fact she probably is opposed the hateful and harmful effects Furzkampf is referencing.  Just wanted to put that out there."
youtubecomments,2ottdy,TibsChris,7,Wed Dec 10 14:53:21 2014 UTC,"Don't really get why you were downvoted. In its most intrensic form feminism is a philosophical ideal stating that women and men are equal.  By reciting things that women do to men which are harmful does not show a problem with feminism, it mearly shows that Furzkampf does not understand what he is speaking about.  *Edit.. Apparently the downvote gods have reversed their decree"

youtubecomments,2ottdy,orionsbelt05,0,Wed Dec 10 21:37:02 2014 UTC,"Popular perception completely defined and subsequently killed the Gamergate movement.

All movements should fear and respect the possibility of this happening to them, and take humble and intelligent measures to avoid it."

youtubecomments,2ottdy,TibsChris,2,Wed Dec 10 17:45:55 2014 UTC,"That's right. Gamergate might also be scrambling to find a new tag so that the movement can continue while the actual misogynists keep derping. If the movement is effective, it doesn't matter what it's called, if anything at all. People who support gamergate for the right reasons are gaining traction, as the less savory ""reporting"" sites are starting to feel the fallout of a fed-up community (if by no other reason than by ad revenue pullouts)."

I usually follow gaming news, but I never heard about GG until it REALLY blew up. Then about a month later, after several prominent people denounced it based on what it's wrought instead of what it actually stood for, I stopped seeing news about it. I'm sure there are plenty of people who still adamantly work for what GG stood for, and I hope if anything dies, it's the violent trolls hitchhiking on a popular hashtag, misled sociopaths attacking feminists, and news outlets misinforming the public to get clicks."

Cancer is mostly used as an adjective or other things, for example:  Kankerhoer = Cancer whore  Opkankeren = Cancer off (as in Fuck off)"

youtubecomments,2nbe9u,drunk-penguin,3,Tue Nov 25 13:25:45 2014 UTC,"What about people who actually have cancer? What do they say?   Many people are insulted by using cancer as a swear word (those who have it and many others), because cancer is of course a very serious disease. There is no stigma around having diseases, more so to using it as a swear word. People who use it are not insulting people who are suffering from cancer. The main reason why people use it to swear is because it is the most rude form of swearing and it sounds harsh (loud, 2 K's in one word)   Do different diseases equate to different severities of swearing? (i.e. Cancer dick>flu dick)   Some diseases like Typhus (tyfus in Dutch), Tuberculosis (Tering in Dutch) and cholera (shortened to klere in Dutch). Using diseases like flu is not very common, but when in use it's mostly banter."

youtubecomments,2lm8i7,OboesBleat,27,Fri Nov 7 21:28:14 2014 UTC,"From 1013 on, there are exactly 20 numbers per row. Because of this, the first digit of every first number of a row after 1013 is one larger than the second. For example, 1034, 1055, 1076 are the first numbers of the first three rows after 1013. The last digits of those numbers are 4, 5, 6.   If a number was missing between 1013 and 4918, there would be two consecutive rows with the same last digits. I checked, there aren't.  This can be applied to 106-990: As long as no numbers are missing, the last digit of a row's first number is the same as the fifth row above/below.   I also checked for 990-1012 and 1-106, no number is missing.  Therefore, no whole number larger than 0 and smaller than 4919 is missing. Or, every number that is not a whole number larger than 0 and smaller than 4919 is missing.  TL;DR all numbers below 1, all numbers above 4918, and every non-integer number between 1 and 4918 is missing."
