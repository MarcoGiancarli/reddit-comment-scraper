nes,3e2ud3,polle96,4,Tue Jul 21 15:08:45 2015 UTC,"This is the NES ENIO board with Ethernet/CPU expansion board.  The ENIO board plugs into the never-before-utilized expansion slot on the bottom of the NES; you need to remove the plastic cutout to get to it.  The CPU/Ethernet board is optional, and I'm unsure whether or not the creator of this project gave up on it like /u/the_tubes mentioned below.  Having said that, the ENIO board itself is worth it because it allows use of Famicom expansion peripherals (such as the Famicom BASIC keyboard, lightgun, and Japanese ROB) plus it adds the needed resistor that enables Famicom expansion audio on certain games (Akumajou Densetsu, Madara, many Disk System games).  I just got one a couple weeks ago, so he's still producing and selling them. If you just want expansion audio, doing a resistor mod is MUCH cheaper (a couple bucks at most, versus the $40 for the ENIO board) but requires soldering skills, where as the ENIO is plug-and-play."

For great video quality, you'll want to get a CRT TV, preferably a Sony Trinitron. For absolute best results, modify the NES for RBG output and connect to a Sony BVM or PVM. I have a little 13"" Sony Trinitron manufactured in 1985 and despite using the NES's composite video output, the video quality is excellent.   If you want to continue to use an LCD, but with good picture quality, you'll need a very high-end external scaler like the Framemeister. Even with one of these, it might not be the best option. If your LCD panel has any noticeable input lag (ruins many NES games requiring precision, like platformers), a poor contrast ratio, or bad motion blur, you're still going to have bad results."

Keep in mind that the older one is one of the 1st so they may have changed a component in ones by mid 1986.

nes,3dmqgl,the_tubes,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:51:07 2015 UTC,Oddly enough some of the early genesis power adapters are marked 9 Volt but later model 1's came with 10V supplies. The mah like vern says is what I'd read up on. I did so a while back and can't remember exactly but I think as long as the mah is higher than the rating of what your using it lets it work with no problems but if it's lower then it just won't work at all (not enough milliamps or flow of electrons I guess) Also the NES has a voltage regular that will allow a bit of wiggle room on the volts but if it gets too much it will blow but if a fairly easy fix with 3 solder points ( I know because I just took one out of a nes board to replace a bad one on one of my sega master systems ) 7805 voltage regulator. It's what basically gets hot and heats up the back corner of the NES by taking the 9 volts in and reducing it to 5 volts out to the nes board the excess leaves as heat.
nes,3dmqgl,nesmaniac78,2,Fri Jul 17 17:31:10 2015 UTC,"It's the voltage you have to worry about.  If it's higher than the device is rated for, it'll fry the device.    The amperage is where you have leeway.  As long as there's enough of it (it meets or exceeds the device's requirements) you're good.  If there's not enough of it the device won't power on.  This is why you can use a 5 volt 2 amp iPad charger on an iPhone that normally comes with a 5 volt 1 amp charger.  The device only draws as many amps as it needs."
nes,3dmqgl,shantigilbert,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:01:02 2015 UTC,"luckily, the 7805 that the NES has supports voltages up to 25v, so the Genesis power brick is perfectly fine. I would not recommend you put 25v anyways, since it will get hot, but in theory it is possible.  datasheet here: https://www.sparkfun.com/datasheets/Components/LM7805.pdf"
nes,3dmqgl,seg-fault,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:01:50 2015 UTC,"The NES power adapter outputs AC current, while the Genesis adapter outputs DC.  Internally, I believe the NES has some rectifiers that take the AC current and output DC.  This is why you can use a DC adapter with the NES, but I would not recommend the reverse (AC adapter from the NES hooked up to a Genesis).  You might be able to get away with it for a while, or indefinitely, but I would just spend the 20 or 30 dollars to get a dedicated adapter for each and some composite cables.  The RF is absolute shit and having dedicated adapters beats the hell out of having to constantly switch them."

Going the other way (plugging the NES's AC adapter into a Genesis) will definitely fry your Genesis.   The Genesis Model 1 adapter is well known for being so universal. It works for the NES, Genesis, Famicom, Famicom Disk System and Sega CD."

I use metal glo paste and q-tips on connectors that look bright and the q-tips keep coming out black. (brasso or something similar I think would work too) but if you have a security bit to take the cart apart you can use a big eraser to erase the years of yellow tarnish off the connectors and it's amazing how they shine like new. Out of a 1,000 carts or more I've dealt with over the years I've only had one nes game (galaga) that I could not get working & I still don't know what was wrong with it because it was in great shape.

nes,3d9zpz,TheCardiganKing,6,Tue Jul 14 17:36:32 2015 UTC,It will never end.  Get what you want now before prices get worse.  Three years ago I was selling MM1-6 bundles for $100 shipped and at that time it was a very good price to sell at.  Good luck with it now.
nes,3d9zpz,SpaceJockey1979,2,Tue Jul 14 18:21:27 2015 UTC,And I passed up a copy in person for $65 because I thought that was too much. Now I'm just waiting for this price bubble to burst.
nes,3d9zpz,fastlane250,3,Tue Jul 14 23:44:39 2015 UTC,"I'd say a bubble is definitely forming. I don't understand the thinking of resellers in this sub-Reddit who keep saying the prices will never go down. They will, it's just a matter of time. I posted a few weeks ago how FF7, the black label, used to run for like $60 - $75 in the mid to late 2000's. Now it's back down to $25 or $30. Things do fluctuate as well as interests. It takes a whole host of storage space to keep these cartridges and I can see storage becoming tiresome in the coming years for collectors. Problem is that prices won't ever go down to their cheapest and that it's going to take a few years for it to happen."
nes,3d9zpz,the_tubes,4,Wed Jul 15 03:00:58 2015 UTC,Fuck ebay and that trending price shit.  I know that's the cause of the problem for many of these games!  God If there was just some way to stop it.
nes,3d9zpz,DamienCIsDead,4,Tue Jul 14 19:30:36 2015 UTC,"Everyone bought all the games by this point, plus NES fan sites shot themselves in the foot by ranking everything by an arbitrary rarity system and sealing boxed copies up in acrylic cases. Won't get any better unless there's a 2600-like collector market crash.  Personally I've been making repros of everything because it's easy to do and I can get copies of Astyanax & Super Spike V'Ball (good common donors) cheap near me. I thought about turning every World Class Track Meet cart I find into a Stadium Events and just dropping them off in the wild to screw with the market, but it's too much effort for what is essentially just a lame troll."
nes,3d9zpz,kicklecubicle,2,Wed Jul 15 01:39:35 2015 UTC,"I agree. Was it you who was talking about dropping copies of Earthbound and Metal Storm in another thread? I don't blame you for your opinion. Prices are astronomical now.  As for the Youtubers; they totally did screw the market. Unless a game had a print run of several thousand copies, what difference does a run of 500K vs. 800K really make? What sickens me the most is that I keep seeing ""Mega Man 5 V Rare Cart Ultra Rare"" on Ebay. I've said it before and I'll say it again; Mega Man 5 is not rare. None of them really are in the series. If you're talking Dragon Warrior 4 or some obscure game, then yes. The prices for commons like Zelda, Mario 3, and Super Mario World for SNES are getting out of hand. $25 for Super Mario World? Are the sellers out of their minds?  Well, it may be wishful thinking on my part because there are plenty of early 30-somethings like me who have extra income to now burn. I just hope after a few years people get tired of hoarding and start unloading the stuff when more people start having kids and need money."
nes,3d9zpz,Mechageo,3,Wed Jul 15 02:57:08 2015 UTC,"Hey, it's me again, from the last time you made this thread.  I'm foolishly going to try again.  How many copies of MM5 were sold in the US?  I ask because you talk with such certainty about its rarity.  Please give me the number.  I'm sure it sold well, but the SNES had been out for a year and a half.  You're probably overestimating how common it is.  Really you're probably overestimating how common NES games are in general.  It's 2015.  Super Mario Bros sold 29 million in the US.  Would you be surprised if 8 or 10 million of those are gone by now?  I wouldn't!  And the Metal Storm comparison... so what?  Rarity isn't the only factor in the price.  I love the game, but it's not well known.  There will be a lot of people that want to collect the old Mega Man games.  I don't understand why you're so furious about this, especially since you keep saying the prices will come down eventually."

The terrain was fun to play, it gives you the ability to create your own tracks and although the NES did not have saves, it was still awesome that they included the feature. Add physics where you have to control angle of jumps and landings to scrape milliseconds away from the race time, the danger of overheating by going too fast and you have a game that is easy to pickup but requires practice and attention to detail to master."

nes,3da20g,DamienCIsDead,3,Wed Jul 15 23:51:55 2015 UTC,"They missed a huge opportunity by not having it 2 player on the NES. It's not as fun playing alone, since the challenge comes from beating your friends time by making sure you land properly off jumps and tap the boost button at the right time.  As an extra challenge, My friends and I always tried to see how many other bikes we could knock down on the way.  I never had ""Vs Excitebike"" as a kid, but it sounds way way better."
nes,3da20g,the_tubes,2,Tue Jul 14 18:47:26 2015 UTC,It's not great. We used to play this during breaks in grade school and it was really only fun watching someone play and taunting them when they crashed or overheated.  The music kind of brings me back to those days but it's otherwise unremarkable.
nes,3da20g,Turtle_Power86,2,Tue Jul 14 18:48:39 2015 UTC,I think it's the programmable tracks that everyone loved.  Shame that it required a shitty keyboard and a tape recorder that was never released outside japan to save the tracks (even though it was a shitty way to save a game in the first place).

nes,3da20g,Hot_Fist,2,Tue Jul 14 21:08:33 2015 UTC,"I grew up playing it, so I might be a little biased in my praise. But a big part of it was the customizable tracks--something that was basically unheard of back then (and this was a damned launch title!). It was a blast setting up impossible tracks and then having a buddy race them. Also, try playing it and attempting to beat the best time for each track. There's a big challenge there trying to hit all the jumps and landings perfectly. Not to mention pushing the limits of the temp gauge."
nes,3da20g,justinsayin,2,Tue Jul 14 20:04:10 2015 UTC,"Pretty much what he said.  I grew up playing it so I have some nostalgia-fueled love for it.  And making your own track is awesome.  Too bad you couldn't save them though, unlike on the FDS version in Japan..."

I can save up to 4(?) tracks for later play (writes to the disk), and also play 2 players on said tracks. Maybe the ONLY thing that sucks about it is that I'm worried my FDS might die from being old and then I won't be able to play it.

nes,3d26yz,TheRetroChallenger,3,Sun Jul 12 22:43:29 2015 UTC,That was a more obscure treasure from my childhood. I probably only made it about 1/3 through that game with their ridiculous upper and lowercase password system. I think I messed up writing it down and never went back after that.

nes,3d1d47,DanzoFriend,2,Sun Jul 12 18:41:20 2015 UTC,"I just installed an RGBNES board in a spare front loader I bought on eBay. I use it to get S-Video out to my TV, and the quality is freaking incredible. You won't want to ever go back to composite. I also retooled the 72-pin connector, disabled the region lockout, and bought an NES ENIO adapter. All I need now is to whip up some retr0bright to clean up some of the ugly yellowing from this old thing.  The hardest part is desoldering the PPU, but if you've done desoldering before and have the right tools it's not so bad. With a vacuum desoldering pump, people have been able to do this in about five minutes. Desoldering the chip took me about 45 minutes using a standard variable temperature iron, desoldering wick, and a cheap hand desoldering pump/iron combo unit.  Next I'm going to mod my Sega Genesis model 1 to output S-video. Should be easier than the NESRGB mod because you don't need to desolder any chips.  Thankfully the SNES already outputs RGB to S-Video, you just need the proper cable. I got one coming in the mail for that system."
nes,3d1d47,DamienCIsDead,2,Sun Jul 12 20:36:19 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure if you know but S-Video, while much better than component, isn't RGB. The same people who did this video explain here (there's a lot more cool info on this in this video you should checkout). Component video transmits video over a single channel while S-Video transmits over 2 channels. RGB on the other hand transmits over three separate channels giving even greater quality.        To transmit true RGB you're going to need a SCART cable. Your Sega Genesis, and many other systems too, can actually output RGB already via SCART without any modding at all. If you're using a Framemeister you can get a SCART to XRGB Mini 8-pin adapter. You can also use a SCART to HDMI adapter which is cheaper, but from what I understand the Framemeister helps with input lag as well."
nes,3d1d47,DamienCIsDead,2,Mon Jul 13 23:43:03 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'm aware of the difference. But I knew S-Video would be light years better than composite (which it is) and with the NESRGB board I always have the option to output to a true RGB monitor (like a Sony PVM) if I ever come across one or to a flat panel if I ever invest in a Framemeister or some other type of upscaler/HDMI adapter. It looks freaking amazing on my Sony Trinitron through S-Video though, and I'm happy with it.  Same pretty much goes for the Genesis. I know there's a Genesis model 1 cable that has RGB SCART with separated audio output, but I could buy one of those if I ever need one. The S-Video mod for the Genesis is pretty easy to do and the composite output on mine is pretty awful; even worse than the NES was."

nes,3czd2q,sp00kyh00va,3,Sun Jul 12 08:27:16 2015 UTC,"I don't think I could narrow it down to just one. But here's a few of my favorites-   Mega Man 2   Great music, great platforming, great challenge.   Zelda    My mom and I used to play this game all the time together, she was an avid reader of Sci-fi/Fantasy so this game was really enjoyable for her. I also credit this game with teaching me to read at a very early age (like 5 maybe?)   Super Dodge Ball   I used to play this one in a laundry mat when I was younger. It was the arcade version of course, but when I got addicted to it I bought the home version and it was great fun. I con't count how many times I've beaten it.   Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II   Another arcade favorite. Got addicted to it and had to have it.   Star Tropics   I actually recently re-discovered this game. I used to rent it all the time when I was younger and never could remember the name. I played it recently and all these memories of going to the rental store and getting this game multiple times flooded back.    Blaster Master   This game is one almost everyone knows. It is has solid game play, great music and a ridiculous story that was only in the American version. Go figure.   Burai Fighter   This is one I got in a ""lot"" of games but had no nostalgia for. But when I started playing it it turned out to be a great game. A horizontal shooter that lets you shoot in all 8 directions, has 4 or 5 difficulty levels for all sorts of players and a few great music tracks that stand out."
nes,3czd2q,sp00kyh00va,4,Sun Jul 12 08:40:50 2015 UTC,"Good to see StarTropics on your list! That's a great game, but the battery save on my copy no longer works so I've never made it to the end. I have to restart any time I boot it up. I'd say some of my favorite games that aren't in most people's standard top 10's are Faxanadu, Ghosts and Goblins, Guerrilla War, Kabuki Quantum Fighter, Street Fighter 2010, Xexyz, Tetris 2, and Super Spike VBall. But of course I love the standard favorites like SMB3, Zelda, Contra, Ninja Gaiden, Kirby, Duck Tales and Mega Man too."

nes,3czd2q,aerobert,1 point,Sun Jul 12 08:54:44 2015 UTC,I agree with Burai Fighter. Bought it like four years ago here in Europe and it turned out to be good. The music is somewhat boring for a shmup though.

On a serious note, I'm glad that you're only getting the games that you enjoyed. I've had to slow down my collecting as of late because I haven't even been playing the games I've been buying. I'm trying to obtain games that I actually play(ed). The games I haven't played I've been trying out on emulators and it's saved me quite a bit of money. Spend more money on one thing if it's good and it's what you want. Don't spend small amounts on multiple carts of ""meh"" stuff that you're unlikely to play. I understand completionists, but not everyone has to be one."
nes,3cyisa,dividebyzeroZA,4,Sat Jul 11 22:59:13 2015 UTC,"Very cool idea.  I'd love to print out one of those just a desk ornament.  I think you should rephrase or drop that legal statement because downloading ROMs still isn't legal - even if you own the particular game.  I'm not a lawyer, but my understanding is that you can possess a ROM legally if you made the backup yourself.  Giving legal advice makes sense if you're a lawyer and understand the law, otherwise I don't think you should make legal recommendations.  In reality, nobody is getting prosecuted for ROMs for personal-use, a silent majority pirates them en masse, while a vocal minority always feels the need to speak up against it.  Why do we all insist on pretending it doesn't happen?  Just leave it at ""downloading ROMs is not legal under current law."""
nes,3cyisa,seg-fault,2,Sun Jul 12 02:08:06 2015 UTC,Good point - I thought it was okay if you owned the cart.    But I'm definitely no lawyer and your suggestion makes perfect sense.  I've amended it slightly to have a completely different tone now.  Thanks for the kind words too.

nes,3cthnh,squeaker,1 point,Fri Jul 10 20:24:10 2015 UTC,The disk itself is writeable.  However Mario 2 only saves the scores if I recall.  Games like Zelda and Metroid saved progress on the disk by writing to the disk.
nes,3cthnh,scicog,1 point,Fri Jul 10 20:25:09 2015 UTC,"No, from what I remember it actually saves how many times you've beaten the game, but does not save your high score."

nes,3cthnh,rainwarrior,0,Sat Jul 11 00:02:31 2015 UTC,"Why would you think it has a battery save?  None of the NES Mario games had battery saves.  On the NES and Famicom, only adventure games and RPGs had saves.  Batteries add extra expense to the manufacturing.  So, while I don't know 100% that Japanese-SMB2 didn't have a battery, I'd certainly put my confidence at somewhere around 99.5%."
nes,3cthnh,Grantagonist,1 point,Fri Jul 10 19:32:09 2015 UTC,The reason I would think it had a save would be you have to beat the game 8 times to get 8 stars to unlock world A. Each time you beat it a little star lights up at the intro so with all the carts of this being pirates anyways I simply want to know do any of them have a save feature as the famicom disc system apparently had? I hardly think anyone is going to beat the game 8 times in a row without turning their system off. As far as that goes I know Nintendo released a gameboy advance famicom classics version so I'm guessing it has a battery backup and super mario bros deluxe I recently discovered has lost levels in it & I'm pretty sure it has a battery. I think everygame with a highscore counter should have some sort of battery backup which is one thing that is making the everdrive n8 look more enticing but I just started reading about it today.
nes,3csopm,W_W_P,6,Fri Jul 10 13:34:19 2015 UTC,"This isn't something I'm familiar with, but I looked it up. From a 2008 NintendoAge discussion:   USA controllers (NES-004) will not work on PAL consoles. PAL controllers (NES-004E) have an extra pull up resistor on the data line that the USA controllers do not have. That isn't needed on the USA console so PAL controllers will work on USA consoles. Soldering in that resistor is easy if you really like the controller.  It can be put inside each controller or once inside the console.   And:   For some reason Scandinavian (PAL-B/SCN) systems use the same controllers as the US (NES-004) and regular PAL controllers (NES-004E) doesn't work on SCN systems. It may have something to do with Scandinavia was the first region in Europe to get the NES...?    Essentially, your Swedish system is a hybrid of the European PAL console and the American version."

nes,3crkcl,TheMovieMaverick,16,Fri Jul 10 05:08:00 2015 UTC,"For those that didn't know about this and trying to do it now, the book isn't completely correct. Do this:   Go to world 1-1.   At the end of the level make sure both digits of your coin count are the same as the second to last digit of your score. (if your score ends in 40,  your coin count should be 44. Score 60, coins 66. You get the idea).  You can use the bricks and pow to do this near the end of the level. Fly up in to the pipe above to reset them if you need more bricks to change your score or coins to match your score.  Stand under cards at the end, when timer turns even, jump and end the level.  Enjoy your coin ship! There's a hidden 1up at the end.    PS: easiest way to get the score/coin match-up is to get the coins to whatever you want, then just start tail whipping bricks til your score is correct. Each brick is worth ten points so it only takes a few regardless.   Source: Been playing SMB3 for 24 years."
nes,3crkcl,ILPV,2,Fri Jul 10 09:27:42 2015 UTC,"I have a pattern for doing this in world 1-1 that I have been doing for decades.

Not sure how many, but it's almost all of them.  And by almost all I mean don't miss more than one or two max.

nes,3crkcl,Rayoshi,2,Fri Jul 10 06:17:44 2015 UTC,"your score counter must match your coin number.  Example, you have 11 coins, so your score must have a 1 in the tens digit, such as 9,310. The tens digit is the 2nd number from the right. If you have 22 coins, your score could be 15,420. Also make sure the timer is an even number when you end the stage.

nes,3crkcl,justinsayin,1 point,Fri Jul 10 21:57:42 2015 UTC,Your score has to be the same number as your coins. Ex: Coins are 11 your score has to end with 10 and the timer has to be an even number. Also the hammer bro that's on the map has to be alive still.

nes,3crkcl,scicog,1 point,Fri Jul 10 15:05:43 2015 UTC,"No, the moving level gives you a bonus mushroom house if you get all the coins.  The coin ship is activated by the coin time and score method discussed above. I am pretty sure you can only get coin ships in odd numbered worlds."
nes,3crkcl,nesmaniac78,2,Fri Jul 10 13:32:59 2015 UTC,"A Treasure Ship (also known as Coin Ship) is a large, flying vessel that appears in Super Mario Bros. 3. If Mario or Luigi venture onto a Treasure Ship, they will find dozens of coins that they can collect, plus an invisible blue 1-up mushroom for the NES version. Not including the ones battled at the end, there are no enemies found on the ships. However, they can still lose a life either by getting crushed by the scrolling screen, falling off the ship, or letting the timer run out. If a player dies while onboard a Treasure Ship, it reverts back to the Hammer Bro icon.  The map of the Treasure Ship in the Super Mario All-Stars version of Super Mario Bros. 3. Treasure Ships are summoned through a trick that must be perfomed by following a specific method:  The player must be in either Grass Land, Water Land, Sky Land or Ice Land. A Hammer Bro must be on the map. Mario or Luigi must finish a stage with a Coin total ending in a multiple of 11 (zero doesn't count). The tens digit of the player's score must match the multiple of 11. As each second left on the timer will award the player 50 points, the timer must be stopped on an even number so that the number of points received is a multiple of 100. Alternatively, an odd number will work if the score is 50 points off from the correct multiple. For instance, if the above criteria is met, and the player ends a stage with 44 Coins and a score 0246240, they will successfully trigger a Treasure Ship. Note that this trick will only work once in any given world.  At the end of the ship, two Boomerang Bros. are fought. The reward for defeating them would be whatever item the Hammer Bro that got replaced by the ship would've normally given."
nes,3crkcl,BCProgramming,1 point,Fri Jul 10 15:20:59 2015 UTC,"I've had this happen up to world 3 at least. I basically tried to get every coin in the level, and would accidentally end up with a coin ship. I figured it had something to do with getting every single coin in the level.. kinda of like 1-4 but with different rewards? It was a hunch at most."

Took me over 15 years to find one this low # so I guess a 2 min video not too bad considering I was excited about my find. Kind of wanted to explain things to those who are not familiar with the NES as well because getting more interested in the NES scene is really the whole purpose. Also, I think I have the highest # one as well because I was searching both sides of the spectrum. Nintendo refurb's with barcodes don't count since they renumbered those with a 80 million range starting point. I'll post pics of it when I get a chance."

Show is obviously scripted because I saw an episode not long ago where Darrel the gambler found a lot of NES stuff and it was just too good to be true with a stadium events cart and other great ones. No one is that lucky or at least I don't think so. I know because I've looked for this stuff for so many years & seldom find anything great & nothing like that.

nes,3ckgfs,grink,3,Thu Jul 9 15:52:33 2015 UTC,"Interesting. I wonder if it has the ""rough top""? The NES that were the premier batch to be sent to the US (East coast mostly) were made with higher grade materials and are know to last longer. I got one from a guy who used to own a pizza shop in NY (stereotypical, ha).   The texture of the plastic on top was much different than any of the other NES I have. It had a low serial number as well, though I'm not sure what it was as my father has it on the other end of the state. I gave him that one because of the assumption that it was made with higher grade materials (could be bullshit) and he wouldn't have to service it. But it is still kicking and playing duck hunt (the only game he plays being ex-military and 70)."
nes,3ckgfs,grink,1 point,Thu Jul 9 06:57:31 2015 UTC,It's a smooth top. I have several NES consoles and I know for sure they have smooth tops up until the 4 million range. My first new nes from 88 is around 6.5 million and it has rough top. I'm pretty sure I have some 5 million range with rough top.
nes,3ckgfs,mbsk1,3,Thu Jul 9 16:34:01 2015 UTC,"That's very cool maniac, my lowest is in the 20,000 block.  For those wondering of the significance, this would be the one hundred and thirty-first NES ever produced, out of 32 million sold in the US.  Overall, 62 million were produced worldwide.  So his serial number is RIDIC."
nes,3ckgfs,-good-,2,Fri Jul 10 05:03:14 2015 UTC,"You have yourself a test market system there for sure. I remember finally finding a nes under 1 million (900,000 range) after searching a long time. A few years later I started searching ebay for the pre deluxe rob sets & ended up buying a couple low numbers (9000) with matching serial number warranty papers intact. Never dreamed my search would lead me to finding one of the 1st couple of hundred. When I first heard of it I thought it was a joke but after seeing pics I knew it was real deal. I was extremely fortunate for once with timing and circumstances on getting it."

I also had two games from them that did not work and they did very little help to compensate. They wanted me to send them back at my expense and they would send another but I would have to pay the shipping again. In total I would have had to pay shipping 3 times to get the game I ordered.

When I rediscovered my NES collection in my mom's basement, I had an SMB3 and a Track and Field that I don't remember owning.  I think SMB3 was probably borrowed from my cousin and never returned.  I highly doubt he remembers or cares today.  The Track and Field is more mysterious, though.  It has a barcode sticker, which suggests it was a rental at one time.  My best guess is that I picked it up cheap from a video store closing sale right before I moved on from the NES.  It's weird, though, because I have no memory of buying it and I'm not an especially big fan of Track and Field."

So a power supply and some AV cables should at least let you know if it will start. Recommend you disable the lockout chip and clean the game connector slot as well.

nes,3c56lp,captain_herbal_life,2,Sun Jul 5 04:52:50 2015 UTC,Try boiling it. Not kidding. https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=TnxZIuYb9WU  Also make sure you're cleaning the connector rather than just bending the pins. Give it a good once over with an old toothbrush.
nes,3c56lp,btgreenone,1 point,Sat Jul 4 23:42:46 2015 UTC,I cleaned it before as well. I'll give the boiling a shot and if that doesn't work I'll buy a new one.  Will boiling it clean it in the process?
nes,3c56lp,brianbonner22,1 point,Sat Jul 4 23:50:09 2015 UTC,"Yea I can verify that along with, well  probably almost everyone on this sub. I just boiled my pin connector and bent the pins back (the video I watched showed him using a cart to bend the pins back instead of individual pin bending) and mine works like a charm. Only thing I really had trouble with was putting the connector back on the board but it was just a matter of me not using enough force to slide it back on. Also I disabled the NES lockout chip which isn't that hard to do either that helps the problem with blinking from what I read."
nes,3c56lp,btgreenone,1 point,Sun Jul 5 00:04:03 2015 UTC,"the video I watched showed him using a cart to bend the pins back instead of individual pin bending   Yeah, this will also accomplish some of the cleaning OP was asking about. The boiling may loosen some of the stuff on the pins, but while you're in there, take advantage of the access to really scrub the shit out of it. I wouldn't do anything abrasive but even a credit card wrapped in an old T shirt with some isopropyl on it will give you better leverage than any cartridge cleaning kit just because you've got a better angle at it when the connector is pulled out."
nes,3c56lp,captain_herbal_life,2,Sun Jul 5 00:29:17 2015 UTC,"Boil the 72-pin (as already mentioned) or disable the lock-out chip (also known as the 10NES chip).

nes,3bt47l,GirlField,1 point,Thu Jul 2 04:02:01 2015 UTC,"Exactly. The eraser is for cleaning, the alcohol is for drinking after it's playing."

nes,3bt47l,Schlitz001,4,Thu Jul 2 03:08:35 2015 UTC,"It's a very thin gold plating.  The Weiman's is an abrasive.  Just because you don't think you see it doesn't mean it's not happening.  An abrasive will expose the nickel underneath, which is more prone to oxidation and therefore makes it more susceptible to deterioration.  I really don't recommend using abrasives unless absolutely necessary.  You are shortening the lifespan of your games."
nes,3bt47l,mzupeman,1 point,Thu Jul 2 04:09:14 2015 UTC,"Erasers are an abrasive too, really."
nes,3bt47l,Schlitz001,1 point,Wed Jul 8 15:45:57 2015 UTC,"By definition they are. But Brasso/Weimans contains fine silica dust that is designed to literally scratch off soft metals. The eraser by contrast just removes the gunk via friction and has very little effect on the actual metal. Think of it as sanding a piece of wood with sandpaper versus, well, an eraser."
nes,3bt47l,mzupeman,1 point,Wed Jul 8 17:49:14 2015 UTC,"The problem is that some people apply things like Brasso and leave it on too long. Or they wipe off the Brasso, and neglect to THOROUGHLY clean it off with isopropyl after the fact. Leave that stuff on, and it'll eat through that outer layer.   I think this is more of a problem than the actual product that's being used:  people just aren't sure about what they're doing."
nes,3bt47l,Schlitz001,1 point,Wed Jul 8 18:01:36 2015 UTC,"Abrasives only work with friction, just like sandpaper. Leaving it on longer doesn't remove more of the metal. It's not like acid where the reaction is chemical."
nes,3bt47l,Oops_Insurance,1 point,Wed Jul 8 19:22:41 2015 UTC,"I'm sold on this method, because alcohol alone didn't work for me. The question is, how long will this last?

nes,3bulky,simoalley,3,Thu Jul 2 07:35:14 2015 UTC,"It really depends on what you find acceptable image quality and how much you want to spend.   If you get a NES from ebay it will most likely come with an RF connector, it will not look very good on a new TV like a plasma or LCD. You could use a composite cable, but it still wont look very good on a new TV.  Also Australia being a PAL territory, means the games are 50hz and that makes the image squashed and the games run a bit slower mostly. example  You could get a region modded console or learn how to mod consoles yourself. You could get an RGB modded NES, the appropriate cables and an upscaler like the Framemeister. But that is pretty expensive, and not how it was intended to look in my opinion.  Consider getting a CRT, the only downside for retro gaming is its size.  Consider getting a NTSC console (you will need a PAL power brick, check first)  Consider getting a flash cart. Its just like the real thing.  You could get a Wii and mod it to play NES games and plug it in through component."
nes,3bulky,ArcadeGoon,1 point,Thu Jul 2 09:13:11 2015 UTC,I messaged a guy that has an online store selling retro stuff in Australia. He said it should be fine on a plasma and it uses the standard Nintendo av cables so should be fine with the RYW.   I will consider a CRT depending on how bad it looks. I'm not usually super worried about that sort of stuff though. Especially if I've never seen the original.  I'm sorry I don't know what a flash cart is our how to mod a Wii. Are you able to link some stuff that will show me what to do with that. Would be much appreciated. Thanks.

My stepfathers plasma, it was almost a second - any serious delay and almost all NES games are unplayable. This varies on TV, and you will simply have to try and see. No CRT standard def tv will have this problem though ."
nes,3bulky,Bamboobag_Pandarrell,2,Fri Jul 3 17:24:04 2015 UTC,"Some of the best games on the NES are designed to straight up murder you for cheap reasons. It was a way to stretch out the limited rom space, and doesn't hold up well for many new players, unless they're sadomasochists.   Your best bet to see if you can tolerate this kind of abuse, is a game like Megaman 2, Castlevania, or Ninja Gaiden, where the power-up rewards and classic soundtracks make the experience a little less painful.   But there are other games which still hold up, and are even unique to the system. Moon Pool, for example, is a great puzzle game that doesn't involve any matching at all.    May I recommend Chrontendo as a resource? It covers every single game for the Japanese Famicom and American NES, and places them in their proper historical context. It's far from the last word on the matter, but it's a great way to pick up on hidden gems that even most die hards will miss out on."

It's all luck of the draw on where the tube came from and if the original convergence dials have held true and the chassis is still putting out the proper power levels.   Sounds like you scored a good one though."
nes,3btkle,darknezz18,4,Thu Jul 2 02:38:41 2015 UTC,"Not sure why you got downvoted.  You are 100% right.  There are a lot of abused Trinitrons out there with terrible geometry and convergence.  A lot of times curved tube TVs will look much better.  My recommendation is to just find a tube TV in good condition and use it.  EDIT:  All that said, if you find a nice Trinitron, it is a great thing."

I've seen brand new after-market ones that were just too tight or barely worked. The flashing red and orange screen indicates a reading problem.  What games are you having trouble with? Are these all gray licensed carts or are a lot of these Tengen, Camerica, Wisdom Tree, or other carts?  Second off, clean them using a pink eraser on the contacts on both sides of the cartridge. Then take a q-tip, dip it in rubbing alcohol (or if you have higher percentage alcohol that's even better) the eraser residue off the cartridge. Then use the opposite side to dry the cartridge. Now try your cartridges."

nes,3bnic3,DamienCIsDead,4,Thu Jul 2 18:47:49 2015 UTC,"They're probably not permanently damaged.   Get the following: 3.8mm Security Bit/Driver (This will allow you to open up NES cartridge shells), 99% Isopropyl Alcohol, Q-tips, thick pencil eraser such as these. Open cart. Physically inspect the PCB. Check for broken pieces on the card edge or corrosion on the gold pins, they could indicate a dead cart. This is extremely rare however. Take eraser. Rub the eraser on the cartridge pins on both sides thoroughly. This will remove a lot of dirt/corrosion. Dip Q-tip in alcohol, rub pins on both sides thoroughly. Use dry side and rub them again. More dirt will come off. Reassemble cart and try firing it up again.   Following these steps, along with replacing your 72-pin connector and disabling the NES lockout chip will make your system run like new and rarely ever have trouble with games. Those two fixes are optional, but most people recommend doing them for maximum effectiveness.  Also remember to clean each new game you buy, because who knows what condition some of these games were previously kept in."

nes,3bl6tm,rainwarrior,4,Tue Jun 30 18:07:00 2015 UTC,"It was a late release for the system, and had a pretty small print run.  It's also a really good game.  Rare plus good equals expensive, and hype has been driving the price up for years.  Ten years ago, $400 would have been pretty reasonable, but old Nintendo games are very trendy right now."

Combination shmup and top-down exploration game, very well done and not well known at all.  Ninja Gaiden II was mentioned, but I'll throw the original in there as well. And if you like Life Force, you've gotta have Gradius. If you like puzzlers, Adventures of Lolo and Kickle Cubicle are two of the best on the NES. Lolo's sequels are pricier but the original is still less than $10.  Beyond that, I'll recommend two fun racing games - RC Pro-Am, one of Rare's first games for the NES, and Galaxy 5000, a pretty obscure space racer with a great sense of humor. Also consider Solar Jetman, an exploration/fetch quest game with an amazing physics engine. None are must-haves but are worth a try at their price."

nes,3b733k,TheCardiganKing,5,Fri Jun 26 14:29:35 2015 UTC,"So these two controllers are my first attempts. I painted the Kirby controller first for my girlfriend. I couldn't get a mirror finish, but I didn't burn through it on the final sanding, cut, and polish as I did on the Castlevania one.  I am very disappointed that I overworked the Castlevania controller. I had a perfect finish the first time around, but noticed small indents along the rim from the cord creating impressions and burning through the still soft paint. In the second pic you can see a long burn streak as well as two ""chip"" burns along the corner. I tried repolishing and learned that is a huge no-no.  Things I learned if anyone's interested in doing this:   It's all in the prep work. Sand, sand, sand. Sand until the controller feels super smooth before doing any type of painting or priming. Sand all edges and try to round them very slightly. This will help avoid burning through the paint during the cut and polish process. This is not a one day project. The first controller I attempted (Kirby) I was hugely impatient and it didn't come out as well. Wait at least a week after painting/clear coating before the final sand, cut, and polish Clear coat the living hell out of it. I put 6-7 layers on and although I shouldn't have gone sanding-happy, I feel I could have used 2-3 more coats to avoid some burning issues. Lightly sand only a tiny bit and do not over kill on final sanding. I learned it should be a very light sanding for at most 30-60 seconds. I learned this the hard way. If you avoid most orange peel through a proper painting process, which I did for the black one, sanding should be kept to a minimum. Compound and lots of polishing by hand will get that mirror finish if there is already little to no orange peel. Don't stop at 2000 grit wet-dry sand paper. I still have very fine, fine scratches on the mirror finish because I did not go up to 3000 or 3500 grit wet-dry sand paper. If you're to do this right, go all the way. Something I need to keep in mind for future attempts. Do not ever attempt to cut and polish unless you put a ton of clear coat on. When I attempted this the second time I started burning through the clear coat and my once near perfect mirror finish started developing slight orange peel again on some small spot areas. Paint takes a month to a month and a half to fully harden. I was rolling up the cord around the controller for safe keeping and noticed notches around the edges (which I tried repolishing as described and did more harm than good). Let the casings dry a month before assembly and before use, then put them together. It might be because I used the controllers right away, but a mirror finish will scratch easily before the paint fully hardens. I highly advise to wait a month before handling. Soft paint is too touchy and prone to surface scratches and dents.   This being all said and done, I see why CustomNESGuy on Facebook has a seemingly slow turnaround. He has to make sure that his paint jobs harden and remain dent/scratch free through the hardening process before use.  What's funniest and the worst part of all of this is that I was a fine art major in college and have drawn/painted most of my life. Painting solely glossy, mirrored paint jobs is a whole other animal and I underestimated auto/model painters' ability, patience, and experience. I never worked much with spray paint or with having to hand polish to a mirror finish and it was quite the eye opening experience. This is something that will take time to perfect, so be patient.  Thanks for looking and reading my what turned out to be long instructible on how to paint a custom controller!  FYI: I am interested in eventually selling these once I feel they're up to a high enough standard. As it stands now I'm still learning and I do not feel comfortable selling them. There are many flaws that my crappy camera on my smart phone did not pic up.  Additionally, I think the Ebay seller I bought the overlays from is CustomNESGuy under a different name and I will not be selling anything with his graphics on them. It is his work and I will not be profiting from how much time he has put into it. I'll eventually design my own graphics and have them ordered out when the time comes."

nes,3b733k,Mechageo,1 point,Tue Jun 30 22:14:00 2015 UTC,"When you wet sand the final time to get an even surface right before using compound and polish, you're only supposed to lightly sand for at most a minute. Burning is when you sand through the clear coat, exposing the paint underneath. Without clear coat there it is impossible to get a mirror finish. Not to mention the paint job will have dull and shiny areas."

Not bad. They're high quality. Eventually I'd like to start using my own graphics and decals if I really get into this.  Little art project I'm making that will be a multiple video game console TV stand. I'm going to attempt to use it as a canvas and make it Takashi Murakami inspired.  One thing's for sure.

I wouldn't really recommend it to anyone for its gameplay, but I've spent so much time playing the game over the years that I can't help but love it anyway.  The cutscenes are probably my favorite thing about the game, and they really impressed me compared to what a lot of the other games in my library were offering back when the game was still relatively new."

But the all time winner has to be Altered Beast. Essentially Kung Fu Master on steroids, its graphics were the big selling point on release - it's what crippled the Master System/C64 ports. The Famicom ignores all that, and aims for quick response/variety instead. Plus, original levels, found nowhere else. Since carts didn't hold much memory, this means the sprites are small even by NES standards, and the adorable cartoons that represent the animal's faces on the bottom of the screen aren't helping."

I like Twin Cobra because it sort of plays like the arcade game Raiden, but it has some very boring, rudimentary graphics at times.  I'm a huge fan of NES Strider, and while the graphics themselves aren't bad the game was sort of an Obvious Beta and has graphical glitches everywhere.

nes,3b2brs,TheCardiganKing,12,Thu Jun 25 12:05:36 2015 UTC,"The problem is tied to the way ebay/price charting work.  Ebay only tracks what individual items actually sell at. It doesn't include lots, it doesn't include listings where no one buys the item.   Ebay suggests prices for games. So it's only tracking what individual copies go for, this causes people who list Buy It Now listings to put them up at a slight premium over the trending price for the convenience of not having to deal with sniping at an auction. This then starts a trend where game X is listing as ""Trending at ____"", ebay sellers list Buy it now's for 10% more than the trending price. Actual auctions might go 5% higher than what's the trending price because people desperate for a game might be willing to pay anything less than the BIN prices. This causes a neverending cycle of game prices going up until the prices are unsustainable.  Factor in that many brick and mortar stores use PriceCharting (which pulls its price data from ebay), or ebay listings to determine their prices and you have a huge market of resellers."

Supply v Demand, the generation that grew up with this stuff has a lot of disposable income now and guess where it's going."
nes,3b2brs,SpaceJockey1979,8,Thu Jun 25 17:02:31 2015 UTC,"I see it not so much as the games are overpriced now, as they were underpriced before. Mega Man is awesome.

The only people I've heard trying to justify the price gouging have been retro game shop owners who stand to make a considerable return on their purchases of years past. Let's get real, in the end these are games, not historical artifacts. There is no argument out there to justify what's going on. What irks me the most in contemporary society is that virtually everything is speculated on to make a profit. The real losers in this will be the people who pay these absurd prices and then lose out on when prices drop."

nes,3b2brs,gyp_casino,6,Fri Jun 26 03:11:16 2015 UTC,I think price gouging can only occur with collusion. For example two gas stations next to each other who collude to simultaneously raise their prices. Retro games is a larger free market.
nes,3b2brs,kicklecubicle,2,Thu Jun 25 17:11:15 2015 UTC,"Just a thought though. Couldn't it be considered a form of collusion if Ebay notifies sellers of a higher price point and most, if not all, sellers set prices accordingly? It seems to me that it allows sellers to collude unwittingly. What do you think about this?"
nes,3b2brs,kicklecubicle,0,Fri Jun 26 03:25:44 2015 UTC,"With all due respect, good sir, you just don't understand.   Demand is real, but when we're talking about scale vs. how many carts are still floating out in the ether... That doesn't make for a good argument.   Demand is not an ""argument"".  If a person puts Mega Man 5 up on eBay for $100 and someone buys it, guess what, that's a person telling you that they currently value the game at $100 or more.  That's a person that probably looked for the game out there in the ""ether"" for a while and didn't find it, which will be almost everyone's experience.  Not to mention that no one has any actual idea how many carts are ""floating out"" there, so let's not pretend to.  How many copies were sold?  How many were lost or destroyed or just thrown away?  How many are now just retained by collectors?  What year is it?   The real losers in this will be the people who pay these absurd prices and then lose out on when prices drop.   So, now you're defending the people that would buy it just to resell it?  Think about what you're saying."
nes,3b2brs,HarryManilow,-2,Thu Jun 25 21:30:50 2015 UTC,Someone's getting a little butthurt. Thought this was some light hearted conversation. I meant the people attempting to resell. You didn't register the context. Those hoarding games in the end will be in for a rude awakening. There will be a time when our generation sells them off and they won't be as valuable because younger generations don't own the same sense of nostalgia. I advise people getting into the hobby to not do so for money and speculation. There will come a day when games no longer hold a high price point.
nes,3b2brs,kicklecubicle,0,Fri Jun 26 03:21:41 2015 UTC,"I would like a jury of our peers to read your post and then mine and tell us which sounds more ""butthurt"".  Really, though, your entire premise is flawed.  Each sale on eBay represents a seller placing a value on his Mega Man 5 cartridge and a buyer saying, ""Why, yes, I would rather have that 20-year-old chunk of plastic and chips than these 120 US dollars.""  And now that I think about it, all you're really doing is picking the value that YOU think it's worth and telling everybody not to pay more than that.  What if you thought that $30 was the reasonable limit for Mega Man 5?  And that paying $50 for it was ""pricing out the average collector""?  Please."
nes,3b2brs,HarryManilow,-1,Fri Jun 26 08:55:48 2015 UTC,"LOL dude. Really, don't take this all so seriously. We have different opinions on the matter. There is a threshold as to what average Americans make, disposable income, etc., or are you not aware? There is a price point that goes beyond what people can reasonably spend and call it a hobby. It gets into pseudo antique collecting at a certain price point. Your arguments are getting so generalized that you can apply your own argument against yourself. You're getting off point about the affordability issue which is what I was addressing and how it prices the average person who would like to collect out of getting into the hobby. That was in my original post which I guess you failed to pick up on. Do you honestly feel that considering they are video games after all, that a person with limited income who would otherwise like to collect a $25 - $60 good, AAA, and critically acclaimed game might never be able to do so because the price points are ever increasing beyond the pace of household income growth? That's my point and I do not believe it is fair to be doing so. I make decent money, this has nothing to do with my complaining I can't afford something. My issue is price gouging, and consumers taken advantage of for a hobby that is very likely to bottom out in the coming years. Again, you sound more and more like a reseller or retro game shop owner trying to justify his prices. It's a bit irritating, honestly."
nes,3b2brs,Omni-Slash,1 point,Fri Jun 26 15:54:07 2015 UTC,"this thread is amusing.  sure people are willing to pay a lot of money for MM5 at the moment, but the argument is whether this is reasonable and a good idea to buy now.  We can argue about the mechanisms behind a game's current price and the definition of economic terms, but it's merely an opinion whether a game is worth that much to any of us this second.  Personally I think everyone is crazy for paying the current prices for most NES games. 10 years ago I was getting games on ebay for $5 and no one cared about them. there are millions of copies of these things floating around.  I really doubt anyone is going to care about Mighty Final Fight in 25 years, and I would feel pretty stupid paying $200 for the BOX right now because ""prices can only go up!"" I know no one is going to buy that box on eBay, but it's still ridiculous that the listing even exists.   I have Mega Man 5 in the box with manual. bought it brand new with birthday money at K-Mart when I was a kid. i don't think it's ""worth"" $200 but it would take an unreasonable amount for me to part with the memories. this is why i don't sell any of my NES stuff. it'd have to be enough to change my life, and i don't see that ever happening."

It may take some time yet because we have YouTube personalities and other things sustaining public interest in the hobby at the moment which is largely keeping prices artificially high, but within a few years it will self-correct just like the comic book industry did and a lot of these resellers are going to get left holding the bag."
nes,3b2brs,Grantagonist,4,Thu Jun 25 16:39:30 2015 UTC,"This bubble talk is little more than wishful thinking.  It's not going to break until collectors start to die, or if the fabled myth of bit-rot starts actually happening.  Comic books are a false comparison; the circumstances of the comic market crash were pretty wildly different (over-supply, large amounts of speculators, content that wasn't actually that good).  (I assume you were talking about the 90s comic market crash.)"
nes,3b2brs,Bamboobag_Pandarrell,2,Thu Jun 25 21:53:50 2015 UTC,"Bit rot is a myth, at least we agree on that much.   The same issues you listed with the comic book industry are present here, the difference is only a matter of degree. The industry in both cases maximizes profit as much as possible while the wave of interest continues and then falls rapidly.  NES games cannot maintain value increases of fourty percent a year. That isn't sustainable growth, it's hyperinflation. Public interest waxes and wanes and we have people on this very board saying it's getting too extreme for them and turning them off from collecting. Even major collector guys like Gamester 81 have come out publicly to state that it's getting too expensive and the fun is gone.   Edit: spelling"

Sounds like the only people quitting are the people who haven't really started.  Have any big collectors started liquidating their collection?  Gamester81 may have lost the interest to buy more, but I bet he's not selling anything.  (Disclaimer: I have no idea who this guy is.)  Unless he and 1000 other collectors are going to sell out their collections and exit the hobby, it won't affect the prices at all.    Rising prices may provide a higher barrier to entry for less-moneyed gamers, but that means nothing.  The guys who can afford it aren't going anywhere, and they'll be competing with each other and keeping the prices up.  Guys who are currently in the hobby know what their stuff is worth, and they're not going to start selling at a loss until the market has been sagging for a long time (like, 6 months) and they've given up hope that the market will bounce back.  I could see the market slowing down, and some of your comments support that, but I can't see any reason that prices will actually drop."

I know Gamester is one of those guys and I haven't heard he was selling. But even those guys aren't going to abide endless price increases of 40%a year, and when younger guys and guys just now getting interested because they came across an AVGN video start seeing the sticker shock factor, who's going to be buying? With comics in the 90s it turned from being a sellers market to a buyers market Almost overnight because of the same factors. Sure, big collectors may not be liquidating yet but eBay resellers want to be continually seeing growth on the product they're moving and when the market self corrects because there aren't enough old guys wanting to pay 200 for Mega Man 5 and the younger guys can't afford it, it's going to drop the wind out of the sails of resellers and the prices will fall."
nes,3b2brs,AntcuFaalb,2,Fri Jun 26 18:11:26 2015 UTC,"Re: the comics comparison  Are you much of a comic collector?  Comics in the 90s was such a unique situation... I feel like you might not realize it.  The comic market crashed in the 90s mostly due to ridiculous speculation.  After the early successes of Image Comics and the high aftermarket prices of their early issues, speculators started buying high numbers of all #1s and special-event issues.  In response, publishers started publishing more of them.  These parties fed on each other for 2-3 years.  Of course, this had an effect on ""real"" back issues as well.  And it all came crashing down when buyers realized that these modern-issue ""investments"" weren't panning out.  (Usually the new titles got cancelled before issue 10 anyway.)  On top of that, these high orders for #1 issues caused high print runs of #2 and #3 issues that went unsold and thus hurt both stores and publishers.  A lot of money was spent on crap that never had any value in the first place.  When that market crashed and those speculators exited, the rest of the back-issue market fell to its real value.  As a seasoned bargain-bin digger, I've seen numerous 50-cent bins with pockets of 25+ issues of Deathblow #1 or Avengers #300 or some other equally forgotten title with a shiny cover.  These pockets were bought by one dumb guy who thought this was a solid investment and that each issue would be worth $20 or more within 24 months.  There were hundreds of these dumb guys.  Does any of this sound similar to the vintage games market?  It's not similar at all.  Comics crashed because speculators were making large bets that didn't pan out.  Maybe there are speculators in the vintage games market, but they're buying things that have value to begin with.  To the rest of your argument:   when younger guys and guys just now getting interested because they came across an AVGN video start seeing the sticker shock factor, who's going to be buying?   But there's no shortage of these potential noobs, and there's new ones all the time.  As long as modern companies keep the flagship brands alive, there will be fans who keep checking out the roots.  If prices ever start dropping, the noobs will start buying at levels they can afford, and the prices will stabilize.  Thanks to inflation, prices will never drop for long.  And you're citing the real gems.  Most new collectors will get many of the staples and stop.  They'll get Mega Man 2, Super Mario 3, Contra.  Only the really committed will try to get Mega Man 5, and they'll pay it."

I can't believe that people go back to the '90's comic book implosion in these retro game forums and have the audacity to say it isn't the same thing. It is exactly the same situation despite cartidges being no longer in production. We are, however, looking at in the least hundreds of thousands of carts still floating around and a niche market for them. I don't know if people doling out the comic book crash were even alive or old enough to have experienced it and it is not an isolated event. In the '90's people had money to burn. Baseball cards experienced the same speculative market and those prices have never recovered just as comics from that time haven't. If retro gaming ever gets big enough and demand is high enough, I really believe large companies may contract out to smaller companies new runs of major titles and lowering the market for them.

I want to have the good 'ol US of A type cartridges and not have to load and unload a converter.  Bass, yeah, I hear you. I've posted several times that flea markets aren't a complete bust, but it's been a hassle. I felt icky about paying $100 recently for Chrono Trigger, but that's always been historically somewhat high and in the past I've seen it fluctuate and priced higher, so it wasn't too bad. But some guy over in /r/retrogaming bought Pocky And Rocky for $200... That is crazy. I can't justify that at all. If some in-demand and COMMON titles like Mega Man 5 ever reach that price point, I might walk away from the hobby for awhile much like Omni said he has.  ICantRecall, thanks for the explanation. I suppose since we're all older now some of us have money to burn. I just won't do that nor can I sustainably and affordably keep buying the way things are going. I do hope there will be a huge backlash and a dearth of buyers to stick it to resellers. I swear people solely resell on Ebay.

nes,3b2brs,glitchedgamer,3,Thu Jun 25 13:19:04 2015 UTC,"I got tired of the price inflation. My personal solution to the problem.  Lucky I got my copy of MM5 a couple years ago; traded GB Mega Man V and GC Mega Man Anniversary Edition for it to some guy on an internet forum.  I sort of get why 5 is the most sought after; it was released when the NES was dying and probably didn't sell well. Mega Man 6 was different because they released it around when Nintendo released the NES 2. I remember they released and re-released a bunch of games and sold them for $10 at places like Kay-Bee Toys and Toys 'R' Us. The bargain bin at my Kay-Bee was overflowing with copies of Metroid, Zelda 1, Mega Man 6 and Kirby's Adventure.  Wish I could go back and buy five copies of each. :P At least I got MM6."

nes,3b2ifi,chesterstone,1 point,Thu Jun 25 14:11:00 2015 UTC,"Quite frankly, it's not all that surprising.  A mass majority of the difficulty in almost any 2D platform game is not knowing the patterns of the levels and now knowing how to properly react within a few frames of gameplay.  Strip those away and you're left with a game you can finish in a bus ride home.  Today games offer multiple modes of gameplay, add in game collectibles and achievements, downloadable add-ons, in game stores, and online gameplay.  Before, the only thing we had was multiplayer gameplay for replay value, and the desire to master a game (e.g. no-death runs in Super Mario Bros.)  This isn't a bad thing either, but it shouldn't come to a surprise that games were much simpler back in the day. I'm more than sure in the next 30 years we'll say the same thing about todays games."

nes,3at2j5,aerobert,4,Tue Jun 23 12:45:23 2015 UTC,"The short answer is look locally.  Check thrifts, used media stores, etc.  The problem with buying games online is the ebay infinite loop of rising prices.   Ebay tracks how much games listed as a particular title sell for. It tells people listing games (and potential buyers) what they trend at. This causes sellers to list games with higher reserves or buy it now prices. This then causes resellers to buy games sold in game stores, other online retailers if they're considerably cheaper than the ebay ""trending price"" to resell. This then causes stores that specialized in retro games to raise prices in order to keep stock on hand. A good video on this topic can be found here.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKHk5U8tmfw  The short answer is check your local craigslist. Look for people selling lots, a lot of craigslist sellers want ebay prices but people just looking to sell unwanted items usually don't. Try thrift stores, try other secondhand stores that don't specialize in used games."
nes,3at2j5,icantrecallaccnt,2,Tue Jun 23 18:39:25 2015 UTC,Thrift stores in small towns have been great for me.

nes,3at2j5,chris2webby,1 point,Fri Jun 26 18:06:45 2015 UTC,"I'd avoid buying single titles if possible when looking at eBay, you rarely get them for more than 20 percent under list price.  But  Punch-out, Super Mario 3, Paperboy, Star Tropics and so many other games regularly appear in lots, where you stand a better chance of picking up a few decent games in a lot and having a handful of duplicates - make friends online with other collectors just getting started and try to trade games of similar value with them, or sell the duplicates to try and recoup some of your costs.    Just don't look to make much income - it's definitely an over-saturated market, few sellers have any reason to sell at discount, it's easier to buy up popular titles and increase the price.  Otherwise, as others said, check out thrift stores and pawn shops outside of major cities.  For every half dozen, one likely has a couple NES games in a case or on a shelf.  If you offer to buy a few games and ask them to knock off a few bucks, they'll usually oblige.  These games are out there, developers published millions of carts, it's just harder work than it was 5-10 years ago.  Also, have you tried Goodwill's online system?  Getting pricier, but still less than Amazon/eBay prices for most items."
nes,3at2j5,diburgio,1 point,Mon Jun 29 16:17:57 2015 UTC,"There is no magic cheap game store.  The prices you see on pricecharting.com reflect the actual market prices that people are paying right now.  The only way to get games cheaper is to find an uninformed seller, and those don't last long."
nes,3at2j5,Grantagonist,1 point,Tue Jun 23 14:49:28 2015 UTC,"Between eBay and collecting sites (which I won't link to because they contribute to the inflation of prices), it's harder and harder to find games these days, at least at reasonable prices. Anything with a recognizable name - Mario, Zelda, Metroid & whatnot - will run you $20 minimum. Resellers invaded all my local flea markets and buy cheap/sell high. If you get lucky you'll find a cache of games at a yard sale by people who don't know any better, but this is getting extremely rare.  You could be like me and do something crazy like buy a crapload of shitty common carts, buy a chip programmer, rip out the ROM chips for the old carts and solder in EPROMs that have the games you want on them.  It requires some soldering/wiring skills but is pretty easy to do. This is also how people make physical carts for fan translations/unreleased prototypes. Oh, and for making near-perfect reproductions for the purpose of ripping people off. It's super easy to make your own copy of Stadium Events, for example, using a copy of World Class Track Meet."
nes,3at2j5,DamienCIsDead,2,Wed Jun 24 15:31:16 2015 UTC,"Ha ha ha. I like the way you think. It's getting to the point where people will start buying more repro's, maybe even repro's of licensed games (illegal, however). Earthbound, for instance, is just too high in price. I bought Chrono Trigger for $100 on Ebay (with shipping), but that's as high as I'll go and I don't know if I'll ever spend that much on a retro game again. To be honest, I'm getting into console/peripheral modding and only bought Chrono Trigger because I want to make a custom painted Chrono Trigger SNES.  I keep telling people in the various retro game sub-Reddits that flea markets aren't a complete and total bust. If you want to buy games, you must learn how to haggle and to learn to walk away if a seller just isn't budging. I keep saying that if sellers aren't willing to bend at a flea market then good luck with them selling at all. They might as well wait and sell on Ebay then. I've brought her up many times, but my girlfriend loves flea markets and she also loves haggling/deals. She has talked people down 1/3 to 1/2 the asking price on certain games. My advice is if anyone out there has a girlfriend, have her pretty herself up and make the deal for you at flea markets. Video game nerds are suckers when it comes to talking to a pretty lady."
nes,3at2j5,TheCardiganKing,2,Wed Jun 24 16:27:13 2015 UTC,"I still go most weekends in the summer because it gives my girlfriend and I something to do and I just like sifting through old junk. Once in a while I'll come across a real good video game deal, but it's rare. The last super crazy find I had was a copy of Metal Storm for $10 last summer.  The people who do have NES stuff know it's a cash cow right now and mark everything up. I pass up a lot of good games because they're overpriced.  I always try to look like I just rolled out of bed with crappy clothes to match, because in my area if you look like you have money you'll get charged more and the sellers are less likely to haggle. :P  NES has been overpriced for a while, and SNES is retarded expensive right now. Genesis was okay for a while but now that the others are drying up they shot right up in price. Just try buying any Konami Genesis game for under $50, even cart only with shitty labels.  With my chip burner and soldering iron, I have more fun making repros of translations/hacks. My favorite repros that I made are:   A copy of Ninja Gaiden 3 that someone hacked to be easier and have a password feature, like the Japanese version A version of Gradius that was hacked to have better graphics, save-able control customization and high scores (!!) and VERTICAL SCROLLING (!!!) That version of Donkey Kong that was included in some Wii compilation with the ""Pie"" stage re-added And I did turn a World Class Track Meet into a Stadium Events for myself, for shits and giggles   Some of the rarest games for NES are unfortunately the most fun. I figure I could spend roughly $200 on something like Little Samson or Bubble Bobble 2, or spend that same amount on a chip programmer, some EPROM chips, and a good soldering iron & tools and make the same damn game for myself plus a couple others."

nes,3aqvka,Iswitt,1 point,Mon Jun 22 20:08:37 2015 UTC,"Most of the prices seem ok.  But I'd like to see them selling chrono trigger for less.  They could afford too, since I am sure they paid pennies on the dollar for it."
nes,3aqvka,trinitis,2,Mon Jun 22 20:42:42 2015 UTC,"If Chrono Trigger hits even the $80 mark, I'm buying. I'm tempted to buy up a storm. I don't really agree with Gamestop, but some of the games up for offer under cut the prices of tons of Ebay re-sellers.  Edit: Screw it. I'm buying it even though I don't own an SNES at the moment. That price isn't really that bad. I feel ashamed.  Edit 2: F me. People have beaten me to it. They're unavailable online. The prices are decent and if I buy them with a Pro account I'll get money off. Guess I have to check daily."
nes,3aqvka,TheCardiganKing,1 point,Tue Jun 23 11:31:30 2015 UTC,Maybe they are going to start reprinting old games again like they did with Xenoblade and Metroid Prime.
nes,3aqvka,Graner316,1 point,Tue Jun 23 01:25:16 2015 UTC,"I can totally see new print runs happening. I can see the retro games market getting huge and new SNES and NES games being made, if not just reproduction runs."
nes,3aqvka,TheCardiganKing,1 point,Tue Jun 23 05:56:23 2015 UTC,Doubtful. I don't see a lot of money in it.
nes,3aqvka,TickleFightProTour,2,Tue Jun 23 02:07:35 2015 UTC,"There is a lot of money in it when you continue to sell a new game as ""used"" for $90 like they did with Xenoblade."
nes,3aqvka,Graner316,2,Tue Jun 23 06:09:34 2015 UTC,But you can't do that with nes/snes/genesis/random old console.   Most of the games aren't worth much. Prices can fluctuate a lot. A lot of the games are already available on different platforms(virtual console.) Nintendo won't print old games.

nes,3argn7,releasethedogs,2,Wed Jun 24 20:15:41 2015 UTC,"It's basically a big huge retro store that just opened recently-ish around my location. It's usually called Disc Replay in other places but they chose Mega Replay here for whatever reason. They've got old DVD's, old vinyls, all sorts of retro gaming paraphernalia... And they sell them for as cheap as possible. I talked to the manager once and he said the goal was to keep a constant flow of merchandise rather than to make a big profit. Keep everything moving quickly. The plus side is that you can get games for a lot cheaper than online... Bad side? You've gotta be watchful to make sure you don't miss something you want."

I've heard about Expert mode and Second Quest but don't know what those two entail. Hopefully it'll be plenty more for me to do."
nes,3amw6o,thenottoserious,2,Sun Jun 21 22:51:11 2015 UTC,"You'll be punished almost beyond belief by the second loop / expert mode.  I can no-death clear the basic game; but stage 1 of loop 2 is harder than anything in the first loop, and I gave up on stage 2.  (For now.)  So yeah, you should have more to do :)  I love this game too.  I especially love how short and brisk it plays, makes it an easy choice to pop in."

Apparantly the common price for it is just $7, which is in my opinion a steal. It plays like a run and gun, but isometric and on the water as a boat :). The level variety is pretty big for an NES title with races, rescue missions and boss fights following each other up."
nes,3anhln,TricKyBoy,2,Sun Jun 21 23:18:28 2015 UTC,came here to say cobra triangle :) are you still able to beat it?

nes,3amvzx,ItsJustJoss,3,Mon Jun 22 05:01:54 2015 UTC,I never had a problem with it. It was a great game and I was so happy when I realized that StarTropics had a sequel.
nes,3amvzx,TXFDA,2,Sun Jun 21 23:30:12 2015 UTC,"I think some video, The Happy video game nerd maybe? did explains it. They removed the grid-based controls, but kept the grid-based level design. It's wonky and weird. It's not that it's BAD, it's that it's different, and the decision makes no sense. So to some people that enjoyed the first game a lot, going from that, to Zoda's Revenge just feels off."
nes,3amvzx,releasethedogs,1 point,Sun Jun 21 22:53:43 2015 UTC,can't a GG code be created that nixes the diagonal movement?
nes,3amvzx,Grantagonist,2,Mon Jun 22 17:09:57 2015 UTC,"To me, it doesn't feel like a true sequel to StarTropics.  The controls are different, the mechanics are different, the game flow is different.  It feels like it was developed by a different team."

The latter part of stage 9 was the toughest for me, and I never did beat the falling-blocks stage on the low path.    Rondo of Blood is probably a saner game design; it also has alternate paths with plenty of fun content, but any given path will be shorter (and easier) than the grueling quest in CV3.  I've one-lifed Rondo as well, and its fun remake on PSP."

I think the host is supposed to be generic. They don't mention the hosts name in the manual, but the game was released in '90/'91, so going by that it should be Ray Combs. If it is, that looks nothing like him, but it doesn't really look like Dawson either."
nes,3ahgpr,Sidetrakkd,2,Sat Jun 20 07:07:10 2015 UTC,Yea I thought the set looked like when Dawson hosted and the host kissed everybody like dawson but he looked more like combs than dawson if I had to pick.  HS is not for Humongous Savage?

Also be sure to clean your cart using the tip of an eraser on both sides of the contacts, then take a q-tip and some rubbing alcohol (the higher the alcohol percentage the better), and clean off the eraser residue plus any dirt/dust on the contacts. then use the other side of the qtip to dry it.

After that, I'd highly recommend you play ""A Link to the Past"" for SNES, GBA, or Virtual Console. And if you enjoy that style of gameplay and have a PS3, track down a copy of ""3D Dot Game Heroes"". You can make your own custom character in that game and even download NES Link from GameSpy. Also, there is a fan made port of the original game called ""Zelda Classic"" for PC that can not only play the original maps, but custom maps and graphic packs as well. Have fun!"

I didn't find it incredibly hard when I was a kid. I think I was either 8 or 9 when I got it, and I was able to beat the first quest in a couple of weeks without hint guides. The second quest, on the other hand, is the only time I have ever called into the Nintendo help line.  Some basic tips:  1) There are hidden heart containers scattered around behind walls, under trees, etc. Bomb and burn everything you see.  2) If you're ever given the choice between a potion and a heart container, always take the heart container.  3) There are two sword upgrades and two armor upgrades in the game. Finding them will be critical to your survival.  Anyway, good luck with it. I hope you have fun!"

I only called it once ever, too! Mine was for Final Fantasy Legend III on the GameBoy. I was at like Level 5 and Lara kept stomping my party. The hotline guy looked it up and said ""it says here that by level 10, your party should be ready to take on this boss.""  I didn't know which dazzled me more- the fact that my parents had approved like $8 in phone bills for that help or the 5 whole levels I was gonna have to sit there and grind through. Oh and that's when I learned about grinding!!"

nes,3abnai,chimney3,2,Fri Jun 19 00:06:14 2015 UTC,Congrats!! The best thing about this game is the replay value. You can just go exploring if you get frustrated and it's part of the fun. I end up exploring even when I'm trying to beat it because killing bad guys is neato.

I played it as a kid and to really know where to go and where to find things, you had to talk to people at school and share secrets and locations.  Use the map that came with the game.  Don't feel bad if you have to look things up.  Besides that it's not really all that hard.  Some of the fights can be tricky, but it's very doable.  The hard part is finding the things you need to find."

It introduces a class based system where you change between a warrior, wizard, and a thief. Each class has different features that allow you to access different areas. Overall, I enjoyed it."
nes,39xqzj,skeleman,3,Mon Jun 15 18:22:40 2015 UTC,"Wizards and Warriors 3 is the best one, it is a lot different than the first two.  I never really did like or play the first two that much.  You could get 3 ranks in 3 different jobs(warrior, wizard, and theif) and each rank had different abilities.  To get jobs, you have to find a bronze, silver, or gold statue for the job and then bring it to the trainer.  Then you have to complete a fairly difficult platforming section to pass the tests to get a better rank in a job.  The map is alot more larger and open, but you need the powers of different jobs to access new parts on the map.    It was one of my favorite games when I was a kid.  Some of the platforming in the parts where you are getting a rank for a job can be a pain in the ass but overall it is a pretty fun game that is underrated in my opinion."

Basically, I played 1 at a friends house, and wanted it for my 5th birthday.  3 is what I ended up with.   It's quite vastly different than the others.  3 has great music.   I think the game itself is underplayed and underrated.  Back in the early '90s, with no Internet, it was very easy to get lost.    I actually had a book called ""How to win at Nintendo games"", and I learned how to read just to advance in Wizards and Warriors 3."

nes,39xqzj,BuzzThunder,1 point,Mon Jun 15 23:17:39 2015 UTC,"2 is pretty good. It's hard. I wish that it had unlimited continues like the first one. Bosses are elemental-themed and are gigantic and impressive for the NES. If you get to the bosses without getting the proper item(s) from the level first, you tend to basically die immediately.  3 is confusing coming in from the other games. It has RPG-ish character class features. I've heard that it's good once you wrap your head around making progress.  1 is probably still my favorite, but I haven't gotten to play much of 3 yet. There's something very nicely simple and focused about the gameplay of the first one, yet you still get some depth out of collecting gems and using one item versus another. If I only had the second game though, and not the first, I wouldn't complain."
nes,39xqzj,bigsphinxofquartz,1 point,Tue Jun 16 06:42:12 2015 UTC,2 is very very hard and my least favorite of the series.  3 was my favorite of the series and one of my favorite NES games. It's actually set up like a metroidvania where you have to explore a large open game world and gradually develop new skills and items to get to new places.   Highly recommended!

Always, always keep your phone, download the Ebay app, and check prices before you buy. Have them come down in price and let them know they shouldn't bother putting them out for sale if they price it that high. You might as well have used the ""buy now"" option and got better condition items for that much. Because of the internet, you have to be a bit savier. I use my GF to haggle down prices. Got DK Classics for $8 at a flea market yesterday thanks to her."

I'm very familiar with that type of controller, and I can say that it is absolutely essential that you use the Vaus controller for that game.  I can't imagine trying to play it with a standard NES gamepad; it's completely impossible.  If you are able to acquire a working paddle controller, you will immediately notice a world of difference and you'll start improving dramatically, and the game will be tons more fun."

nes,39riz0,petmaster,1 point,Sun Jun 14 16:45:56 2015 UTC,Word. Is it that smooth throughout the whole game?
nes,39riz0,hack_jalsey,3,Sun Jun 14 16:50:43 2015 UTC,Yup!  The fighting mechanics are also impressive for that time.  The reason this submission link is popular is because that jumping knee is performed by correctly timing A+B immediately after landing from a jump/jump attack.  There is also another powerful uppercut move that is time sensitive.   The game's difficulty is not that hard(for NES standards) and the soundtrack is awesome.  The game is a must-try.

And not just any gold, it's gold mined by eight year olds from a mine in Central Africa. What do you get when you cross a walking egg, tree houses, and an evil wizard? Besides a delicious breakfast combo, you get one awesome RPG. You (Dizzy) have to save your family, the Yolkfolk, from the evil wizard, Zaks, by solving puzzles and playing various mini-games. Some of the puzzles are ridiculously hard, like when you find a bottle and a plant and you are supposed to mix the two to make your sick Grandpa some medicine. The plant you have to find looks like part of the background, and once you get it you don't think to put it in a bottle. ""Here Grandpa, drink this random weed I found, it will make you better."" Maybe instead of a bottle you get to find a bong, that would be easier to figure out. Hey, you don't know what grandpa has, it could be Glaucoma."

What it took was extreme tenacity; it was the most I ever worked to beat a game, and took over a month and 100+ continues the first time.  So worth it, though.  Act VI is the crux, you will need to get there and park yourself there until you've mastered its stages, with the enemy layouts and a strategy for the tough segments fairly burned into your brain.  Only then will you be able to get enough practice on the bosses.  Now, my skill went through distinct phases according to what kind of powerups I needed to defeat the bosses.  Eventually for a one-life clear you've got to use sword alone on Jaquio and Demon (since your subweapons are cruelly taken away after each boss).    The plus side is that learning to defeat Jaquio by the sword is possible and really surprisingly fun.  It takes subtle timing but becomes intuitive with practice.  Good luck!"

nes,39gnuq,IBlackseven,3,Thu Jun 11 16:22:45 2015 UTC,"You may just need to clean the connectors on the games and/or the NES. I would definitely take the NES apart down to the pins and check the condition of the 72 pin connector. While you're in there, you can disable the chip that causes the red light blink. There are a bunch of good sites you can google for detailed help. http://mrgamefix.hubpages.com/hub/THE-BEST-Way-To-Fix-Your-NES is a decent example. Hope that helps."

nes,39gnuq,Alderdragon,2,Thu Jun 11 16:45:43 2015 UTC,"That's a great price, even if the console doesn't work.  But it probably just needs some work.  First of all, I'd recommend disabling the lockout chip (which causes the red blinking)  https://www.ifixit.com/Guide/Disable+Nintendo+Entertainment+System+Lockout+Chip/15677  After that, if it's still hard to get the games to work, it could either be that the game is dirty, the 72-pin connector needs replacing, or both.  Try cleaning the games before you replace the pin connector.  Start with isopropyl alcohol (70% or higher) and Q-tips.  It's not uncommon to go through 15 or more Q-tips on a single cart.  If that doesn't help, I'd recommend a little bit of Wiemen glass cook top cleaner.  This stuff is abrasive, so it will remove some of the outer layer of metal on the cartridge, meaning the Q-tip will always come out looking dirty.  But it's not dirt, it's metal.  Technically any abrasive method will damage your games (the pins will be unprotected and may rust in the future), but even games that I've taken steel wool to have worked for 10+ years.  I'd do maybe 2 or 3 Q-tips with Wiemen's if you want.  You could get a more thorough clean if you take the game apart first, but it's not necessary.  Also if the pin connector is at fault, you may be able to get a game to start up by fiddling with how it's positioned when you turn it on.  Some pin connectors only work if you don't press the game down.  Others work only if it's in the middle.  Others work only if it's 100% down.  It depends.  Usually the replacement 72-pin connectors are really tight and work best without the game being pressed down."
nes,39gnuq,Peekles,2,Thu Jun 11 16:52:27 2015 UTC,Don't press the games down.
nes,39gnuq,icantrecallaccnt,1 point,Thu Jun 11 23:53:29 2015 UTC,"The first thing to try is taking your system apart and boiling the 72-pin connector. Here is a link on how to do it. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnxZIuYb9WU  The heat from boiling it expands the metal pins and causes them to expand and make better contact with the pins on your cartridge connectors.  Additionally, you want to clean your games thoroughly. Take a pink eraser, run over the contacts on the cartridge on both sides. Then take some rubbing alcohol (the higher the alcohol percentage the better) put it on a qtip end, rub both sides of the contacts. this should pick up eraser residue and any dirt. Then use the other side to dry it. Now try your cartridge."

They put a lot of work into their games and the games are meant to be played on real hardware anyway.  It's one thing to pirate games that have been out of production for decades, but games that are brand new and readily available?

I know that programing all the time, supporting a website and a FTP server for my files, designing my website and supporting people 24/7 is different than making a NES game ROM, but I'm sure there's someone who doesn't do it for the money but just the sake of it, I hope you understand.

nes,39bpc0,st1tchy,1 point,Wed Jun 10 18:02:06 2015 UTC,"Edit: I feel I was giving erroneous, uneducated, and tangential information. I know this for sure:  Some adapters may actually be converting the AC to DC. I can't recall if the NES takes DC or AC, but I know those big, bulky plugs/adapters you get are AC/DC adapters and convert the current. So I suppose your system requires DC power and the adapter takes the AC that goes into your house and converts it into DC power that the NES needs. Educated guess here."
nes,39bpc0,TheCardiganKing,1 point,Wed Jun 10 18:22:28 2015 UTC,"I am familiar with the AC/DC converters, and both systems say to supply them with AC. According to the other reply, the system is fine with either."

It's a racing game(duh) with two player split screen, but the views switch depending on who's in the lead. There's two modes of play, an initial drag race type mini game and the actual race itself. There's also cinematic helicopter shots during the races when one player passes another and you battle it out from an ariel view. All pretty impressive stuff for the NES.

Shadow of the Ninja - Terrific graphics (look at the rain and thunderstorm effects in the first two levels) and smooth controls. One of the best-looking games on the NES.

I never really like the Bases Loaded franchise, but have spent a lot of hours on Baseball Simulator, RBI Baseball, Baseball Stars.  By far though, my favorites are Bad News Baseball and Dusty Diamond's All Star Softball.  The former is a fun and cartoony baseball game that allows you to play through a ""season"" of teams with ranging talents, and the latter is very much like the grandfather of the ""Backyard Baseball"" series on the PC. The player selects a roster of players of varying talents and plays against a computer selected team. The graphics are a major downgrade when compared to Bad News Baseball, but Dusty Diamond's All Star Softball has its moments as a very fun game as well."

A little afraid to take it back off because of how much pressure it takes. Not sure if this picture helps, but it looks like this: http://imgur.com/JLomAiI  I tried a couple games. Mario Brothers 3 came on for about five seconds and then went into glitch mode. The Simpsons: Bart vs Space Mutants worked 100% the first try, and then stopped after taking it out and putting it back in."

Actually take a q-tip and some rubbing alcohol and clean the connector that the 72-pin piece plugs in to. I've had this wind up as the problem several times.   Besides that cleaning your games might help. Take a pink pencil eraser, a thin one is best. Rub both sides of the cartridge contacts. Then take some rubbing alcohol, the higher the percentage of alcohol the better and a q-tip. Thoroughly wipe off the connectors on your games. Then dry them with the other side of the qtip you want to get off any eraser residue and black residue and dust that may have built up. Now try your games."

nes,393a3h,FallingSnowAngel,2,Tue Jun 9 03:24:37 2015 UTC,"One of the biggest problems the NES faced was the 3 colors per sprite limitation. It's why Super Mario 3 features a Mario sprite with holes cut out of his suit posing as buttons.   The easiest way around the limit, is to make use of a completely transparent 4th color, and stack the sprites on top of each other. The catch is that the NES can barely run most of the games in it's library already, and this dramatically increases the workload.  Check out SNK's P.O.W. for a great example of how good an NES game can look, if you don't mind all the beautiful sprites flickering in and out of existence. Or try Parodius and Streetfighter 2010 - you'll have plenty of time to take in the view, as your NES tries to process all that data, and slows down to the speed of a pitch drop experiment.   Still, if you don't mind risking a cpu meltdown, they're worth checking out, just to imagine what could have been..."

Some parts look great, others, not so, but the waterfalls in the one and some background tiles look amazing.  Streetfighter 2010 looks like a borderline early 16 bit game. Pretty impressive."

nes,38vsf3,carontheking,3,Sun Jun 7 13:58:45 2015 UTC,"Elecman stage has a nice upgrade that makes other stages easier. So I find it helps to do that stage as early as possible. The problem is that Elecman can kill you in something like 3 hits from full health. So it really helps to have his weakness, which you get from Cutman.  Other than that, Bombman, Cutman, and Gutsman are doable with no special weapons. So it's sort of up to you. Of those three, Gutsman has the hardest stage."
nes,38vsf3,dagit,3,Sun Jun 7 15:37:15 2015 UTC,I usually start with Gutsman's stage. The trick with the moving platforms is that they drop when the back hits the break (the connecting part) - so watch that. It's a lot easier once you figure that out.

nes,38vrij,CHIBI_titan,2,Mon Jun 8 19:34:58 2015 UTC,"You're better off sticking with the CRT television. The NES and newer hd TVs were not designed for each other. Besides having a stretched picture or two black bars on either side of it because of the aspect ratio, modern TVs are notorious for having a fraction of a second of lag when connected to the NES for some reason. Maybe some of them digitize the NTSC signal before displaying it, I don't know, but when it occurs this lag is noticeable to anyone who's used to playing on CRT TVs. Also Zapper games will not play right on most non-CRT TVs."
nes,38vrij,AsmundGudrod,2,Sun Jun 7 07:34:55 2015 UTC,"Maybe some of them digitize the NTSC signal before displaying it,   Yep, tv has to get the analog signal from the console, digitize it, upscale it, and then do whatever else you might have the tv set to do (color correction, smooth motion, etc...). Most TVs have a 'game mode' of some type of setting to help turn off some features and lower the latency. But at the very minimum the analog input still needs to convert to a digital output and be resized, so it'll always have some type of lag compared to a CRT."

nes,38vde2,Oops_Insurance,5,Sun Jun 7 03:44:12 2015 UTC,Blinking screen is always caused by the 10NES sending a reset. I use a miniature screwdriver (like an eyeglass screwdriver) to do it- a set can be picked up at a dollar store.   A note about bending the pins; I have found that if you bend them up too much the games may work just by inserting them and not pushing the toaster down. Alignment of the 72 pin connector on the motherboard needs to be checked as well.
nes,38vde2,mmss,3,Sun Jun 7 09:32:31 2015 UTC,"So first of all I'm glad you have done your research.   I'd suggest boiling the connector again (10 secs at a time, maybe 3-4 times) AND NOT BENDING THE PINS AFTERWARDS. Often times the boiling does all the work and bending the pins after boiling does more harm than good.  Also the only tool I use to disable the NES10 chip is a corn cob holder (yes those things that you hold corn cobs with while eating them). So you have the tools to do it. Just pull the pin out of the chip, no cutting or anything needed.   And lastly be careful of the Game Genie, they are well known to bend pins to a point where nothing can be played in the NES without it. The fact that some of your games are working with it makes me think the pins are incorrectly bent, thus boiling again should help.  Let me know if it still doesn't work and I'll try to help more. Best of luck friend!"
nes,38vde2,captain_herbal_life,2,Sun Jun 7 05:03:21 2015 UTC,"As others have mentioned I'd also recommend boiling the connector again.  I have seen instances where the connectors get to be too far bent or gone to be usable. I've also see instances where the connector on the opposite side that plugs into the PCB on the NES needs to be cleaned along with the PCB connector on the NES for the connector to work.  If reboiling (leave it for 10-15 minutes), and cleaning the pin connector on the NES daughter board where the 72-pin connector snaps in doesn't work, you may just need a new connector."
nes,38vde2,icantrecallaccnt,1 point,Mon Jun 8 14:19:55 2015 UTC,"UPDATE: I boiled my connector again, as well as the old ""new""  72 pin that I removed. While that was boiling, I used one of the corn holders to break the leg of the lockout chip. After boiling, excessive drying with a hair dryer, and reassembly, I plugged her in and the first two games (TMNT and Solomon's Key) worked perfectly. No blinking, so I know I disabled that bastard chip correctly. The next 8 games, which I cleaned within the last week, did not work. I got blue screens and gray screens and in the case of one game, green, pink and red screens; all solid. The kicker is that after the 8 fails, which I repeated like an insane junky trying to get his retro fix, the first 2 stopped working. If it's possible, I'm even more sad than last time. Is there no hope? You guys have been very helpful. I really don't want to pick up another NES."
nes,38vde2,98digger,2,Tue Jun 9 04:10:30 2015 UTC,"If you haven't already, try wiggling around the game cart while it's in the console (and pressed into the downward position).

nes,38vde2,SonofUlysses,2,Mon Jun 8 01:29:45 2015 UTC,"It's a placebo effect. The thing that got your games to work was reseating them. When a computer doesn't boot, you don't take the ram out and blow on it. You disconnect and reconnect it."
nes,38vde2,FrankEGee88,2,Tue Jun 9 18:30:55 2015 UTC,"No. I've done numerous tests with my machines. I've reset them over and over, turned the power off and on, removed and reinserted the carts to ensure maximum contact, and the first time I blow on them, they work. I want to believe there is a better way, but like I've said, nothing beats hard evidence. Same thing goes for my Neo Geo."
nes,38vde2,SonofUlysses,2,Tue Jun 9 19:21:32 2015 UTC,"You're right in that nothing beats evidence. And there is no evidence to support the blowing mechanism. Seriously. Every electronic technician in the world will tell you you're wrong, and it's because you are being misconceived by the notion that blowing on your contacts for your game does anything."
nes,38vde2,FrankEGee88,2,Wed Jun 10 04:31:45 2015 UTC,"There's my own evidence. Everything else is pure theory. There is no misconception. I put the game in: it doesn't work. I take the game out, blow on it, reinsert, and it works. It doesn't get much more simpler than that."
nes,38vde2,SonofUlysses,2,Wed Jun 10 13:20:21 2015 UTC,"Hence why it's a placebo effect. You could take it out, and instead of blowing on it, praise it to Oden and ask for Thor to personally bless it and it will work. Please do your research."
nes,38vde2,SonofUlysses,2,Wed Jun 10 17:45:03 2015 UTC,"You have no idea what you're talking about. From what you're describing, you sound like you don't even know what the placebo effect is. Praising Norse gods would not work. Blowing on the games does, as I've described. When method after method fails, and blowing on the games works immediately, then clearly that particular method works."
nes,38vaka,ncarson9,2,Sun Jun 7 03:17:12 2015 UTC,"It's not the connector because your other games work fine. The blinking light issue means there is a poor connection between the game and the console which is usually caused by dirt in the game.

nes,38vaka,captain_herbal_life,2,Sun Jun 7 05:47:54 2015 UTC,"Ah, ok, that is disabling the lock-out chip. Thanks for the clarification.  Have you tried to boil the 72-pin connector? It sounds like the other pins aren't making a connection."

nes,38brif,basiliskfang,8,Thu Jun 4 11:06:01 2015 UTC,"Best: NES Advantage A solid joystick with a weighted metal bottom. Two responsive buttons, turbo and slow-mo settings. It was a high quality joystick that could have sold for double what it did and still been worth it. Not perfect for every game but a fantastic accessory overall.  Worst: Power Glove There's not much I can say here that hasn't been said by others. You have to hook up a large L shaped piece over your TV or monitor to get it to ""work"". Even then the actual hand and finger usage for controlling it is just terrible. Sure, Super glove ball was somewhat playable. But trying to play literally anything else with it was beyond a chore"
nes,38brif,icantrecallaccnt,1 point,Wed Jun 3 09:05:58 2015 UTC,"I have an issue with the Advantage. Let me describe it and you can tell me if you experience the same thing. When I move the joystick back and forth, the whole controller shifts in my lap. It moved around too much to really feel good as a controller. I like an arcade joystick because it's completely static but the Advantage is too light."
nes,38brif,gyp_casino,1 point,Wed Jun 3 19:20:31 2015 UTC,It's definitely a handheld joystick. It has the little pads for being on a surface but it's not quite meant to by like a big Hori stick. For the price and quality it's fantastic.

Both worked on a similar method, too - When you shoot the zapper, the screen went black and the target went white for a brief moment - the zapper would 'detect' a hit by working out the percentage of white that got to the sensor. Hence why they break easy. ROB worked under the same principle in that the screen would do a different type of flashing for an instruction, which the eyes picked up and translated into a motion."

nes,38brif,Hot_Fist,2,Wed Jun 3 18:13:43 2015 UTC,Oh just a quick note. While the Game Genie functioned okay. It bent the pins on many a NES cart slot to a point where the systems couldn't be used without it.   Any peripheral that breaks your system IMO goes in the bad category.

nes,387q0k,whichwayislondon,4,Tue Jun 2 13:21:21 2015 UTC,"You could always look for the individual pieces to make it CIB.  I've seen boxes and manuals sold separately from cartridges, and the total price of the three separate items is usually less than the price offered by a seller of a CIB package.   I'm not saying that's a great way to make some easy money, but I'm not saying it ain't, either."
nes,387q0k,cvillemade,3,Tue Jun 2 13:24:24 2015 UTC,"In the US they've never been that easy to find.   The NES unlike say the Atari 2600 or Intellivision didn't have a huge surplus of NOS (New Old Stock) carts floating around in the years and decades after it exited the market.  Unlike say the Sega master system or Genesis, the NES didn't have plastic cases that people kept, just cardboard boxes which often got tossed or recycled.  I have around 180 CIB NES games in various levels of condition. I haven't been specifically looking for CIB only (I own around 775 unique carts between licensed, unlicensed, homebrew, converter famicom carts, foreign carts, etc) but in general my finds of carts locally have dropped off as more people are swooping in to resell old video games.  With that said I don't do that much looking on ebay, especially for NES stuff as I already own most of what I want."
nes,387q0k,icantrecallaccnt,2,Tue Jun 2 13:49:39 2015 UTC,"I used to be a strictly CIB NES collector up until about five years ago, but eventually my local stores stopped stocking any boxed games and the prices on eBay went crazy.  So I've stopped pursuing CIB games for now.  Perhaps in 5-10 years these games will find their way back into the market as collectors start selling off their collections."

On the NesDev forums, many have reported success with simply cutting it, but some have reported issues with that.  The lockout chip in the NES, and the chip in the cartridge are both the same chip. the 4th pin sets weather the chip should be in lock or key mode. A stock NES gets +5VDC to this pin to set it to lock mode, where it will toggle the reset lines if it's not happy with your cartridge. By cutting this pin, you have a floating input, which should usually be at or close to 0V, but if you run into issues with this, you should run a jumper wire from the 4th pin to the 8th pin on the lockout chip, to tie the input to GND.  Personally, I cut mine a long time ago and have not had any issues, but YMMV."

nes,37v1qy,Grantagonist,5,Sat May 30 18:12:29 2015 UTC,Why don't you provide a direct link to the actual Kickstarter?
nes,37v1qy,Hobbycoder,-2,Sat May 30 18:36:05 2015 UTC,"It is not going active until the official announcement at Too Many Games.  This is just a ""Trailer"" for it."
nes,37v1qy,Hobbycoder,1 point,Sat May 30 18:52:33 2015 UTC,So it is a book about each nes game for collectors + an rpg in   bundle?

nes,37v1qy,davefmurray,2,Sat May 30 20:26:19 2015 UTC,"Ok I've read that now and I have to say that this is not presented in the trailer. The trailer you posted is more confusing than anything if you do not know the people who are behind it personally. Maybe the videos of successful Kickstarters can inspire you.    The little cut scenes from the personal life of the makers does not make this seem professional. Of course it is not sopposed to be super ""professional"" in some sense as it is on kickstarter. But you know what I mean.    I have the feeling the trailer wants to show how epic and fantastic it is rather than what it is. I think the what should be the main focus if you want people to finance you. The epicness could be presented better in the very beginning and end of a trailer.    That is my opinion."

nes,37pk05,MATMAN333,5,Fri May 29 11:45:11 2015 UTC,"Take a pink eraser. Run the pink eraser over the contacts repeatedly, you should start to see it turn dark. Then take some rubbing alcohol and q -tip. Put the q-tip in the rubbing alcohol on one end and scrub the contacts, then use the dry end to dry the cartridge contacts.   After doing this try your games again."

nes,37m2qu,SlothDaemon,1 point,Thu May 28 17:59:56 2015 UTC,"Agreed.  I have some nostalgic love for the OG NES controller, just because the toaster NES was my first game console, but the dogbone controller was a great upgrade."
nes,37m2qu,icantrecallaccnt,1 point,Thu May 28 18:30:32 2015 UTC,The Dogbone is one of the few controllers I haven't gotten my hands on. Is it true that the wire is shorter than the standard NES controller?
nes,37m2qu,VikingFirebeard,1 point,Thu May 28 20:18:48 2015 UTC,I think that's just the Famicom version because I have super famicom controllers and those indeed have short cords.
nes,37m2qu,Gamecube007,1 point,Fri May 29 04:22:07 2015 UTC,"yeah, the ones included with the AV Famicom have three foot cords.  The aftermarket dog bones also have short cords.   Don't buy an after market one as all the ones I've tried have dpads that are a little too lose."
nes,37m2qu,Zak_McCracken,1 point,Fri May 29 12:21:15 2015 UTC,I have one that actually has chew marks in it. Someone took dogbone too literally! Picked it up cheap just for the curiosity.
nes,37kvl6,slade2501,7,Thu May 28 11:06:47 2015 UTC,"Ebay, Amazon, Flea Markets, small game shops are all raising the prices of games. It's not fun any more to collect."
nes,37kvl6,polishgoku,3,Thu May 28 12:54:54 2015 UTC,"tell me about it.  Used to love collecting, now it feels like work.  I have to work to find a good deal, or a great opportunity.  and sadly, it doesn't really make the find more exciting, it just stretches out the time between finds."
nes,37kvl6,polishgoku,2,Thu May 28 13:12:17 2015 UTC,"Absolutely, I'm not even in it to sell. I just like collecting. It burns me when I go to a flea market and some random person has this assortment of games, without a clue of what they are priced to what ebay has them for. Sadly, the only good finds left are random garage sales where people don't care about the value and just want's to get rid of them."
nes,37kvl6,lartrak,1 point,Thu May 28 13:17:53 2015 UTC,"The most frustrating thing for me are all the sellers who use Buy it Now only and have it over market value. When other people bid annoyingly high, well, whatever, but at least then I have a chance for a deal.   By the way, it does appear to me prices are slightly dropping on a number of big ticket games. I got Bucky for under $70 for example - it was trending to be a $100+ game, but mid $80ish seems typical now.   SCAT has come down a few dollars in the past couple months.   By the way, SCAT and Mighty Final Fight have beem pricey for a over a year. If you paid $25 last year, you got a great deal."
nes,37kvl6,TheCardiganKing,1 point,Wed Jun 3 15:44:26 2015 UTC,"This has been highly, highly irritating. Prices will bottom out. There was a poster in another thread who stated that the market's a bit saturated right now and people seem to be unloading their game collections. The good news is that sellers aren't getting bids. I recently saw a Mega Man lot ($300 for all 6 games) zero out on time with no bids on a 30 day bid timer. People aren't buying and I hope the sellers realize that if they want to make a sale they have to bring games down to reasonable prices. Speculators are ruining things at the moment, but already I've been getting Mega Man games individually for $10 less than what they've been selling in recent months and prices seem to be going down slightly.  Flea markets piss me off even more. So many people pricing by Ebay that get butt hurt when haggled with. They would rather not make a sale and have their games languish and collect dust. It's a great thing that my girlfriend's a hot Korean girl. She haggled down some prices for me with Adventures Of Lolo and Ninja Gaiden at a flea market recently. She's nerd bane.  Just wanted to add: What's worse is that I went to a retro game store that's pretty cool in recent months for the first time, but it was disappointing talking to the owner. Got into a conversation with him how games seemed to be a bit inflated on Ebay and he replied with, ""Well, I think Ebay's great because it's reflective of what people want to pay."" I then said, ""Well, they're used games though and I bought (X-game) for this much only a few years ago. It can't possibly have spiked that high in that amount of time.""  You guys wouldn't believe the response (talked about Mega Man prices since he had a used one with box that was nearly destroyed for almost $160), ""Well, Mega Man was $80 when it came out. Games were more expensive new then.""  I wanted to smack him upside the head. These are used games and comparatively the dollar had more buying power when NES games were released. I just stopped talking to him."
nes,37kvl6,trashedputin,2,Thu May 28 13:55:35 2015 UTC,"In fairness Ebay is reflective of what people will pay. It might be speculators and resellers, but you see tons of posts on the game collecting subreddit of people paying FMV on Ebay as well. This guy is only wrong is he is pricing by unsold listings.  As for saying the price when it released, that is a pretty bizarre thing to bring up when you are dealing in used items. Really only makes sense for things that just released, not 30 years ago."
nes,37kvl6,Schlitz001,1 point,Thu May 28 14:07:27 2015 UTC,"In fairness Ebay is reflective of what people will pay. It might be speculators and resellers,   You have to wonder if resellers and speculators can maintain high prices long term.  Eventually the product has to end up in the hands of the end user or resellers/speculators are just selling to themselves over and over again, needlessly inflating the price.  It's a positive feedback loop of sorts and it's what will eventually cause the prices to down turn.    It might be tomorrow, it might be 20 years from now, but at some point speculators/resellers are going to have a tough time making money.  And once the pendulum starts swinging the other way, it's going to be a scramble while people hurry to dump their games before the price plummets."
nes,37kvl6,gianni_retro,1 point,Thu May 28 15:58:37 2015 UTC,"The irony is that we have the power as consumers yet some hardcore collector or whomever will drop the ridiculous money that retailers/resellers are charging. If we stop it they will have to lower prices. I refuse to pay for any NES games over $20 in a retail store. Luckily I had picked up a lot of the expensive, more common games much cheaper. Hell 2 years ago I grabbed Bucky O'Hare for $35 here in Canada and it goes for $125 now. Madness! We need to stop buying for awhile. Emulate, and see what these vultures will do!"
nes,37kvl6,asdfqwer426,1 point,Fri May 29 18:45:46 2015 UTC,"i agree that his argument about the initial price of mega man is garbage, BUT ebay can be a good course for seeing what people will pay. while you mention seeing lots of auctions that get no bids due to people putting high prices on things, you can also search recently sold auctions, to see what people are ACTUALLY paying for things instead of what sellers want. I know a local game store that does this. their prices, while not awesome, are fair for the most part.   except the gameboys. I don't know what they're thinking with the gameboys."
nes,37kvl6,FF7Cid,1 point,Sat May 30 01:21:12 2015 UTC,"I think it's possibly because more people are getting into retro game collecting / and people that played these games as kids now have the money to collect. I think another factor (like the games you mentioned) are good games that are harder to find, so the price skyrockets because people want them. I can take some screenshots of some NES games I bought on Amazon a few years ago for .99 cents that are now 25.00 + dollars."
nes,37kvl6,Slayback,1 point,Thu May 28 15:53:33 2015 UTC,Sheesh. I paid like $10 for Metal Storm about 10 years ago. It was a game that I remembered from childhood that no one else seemed to care about...
nes,37kvl6,FF7Cid,1 point,Thu May 28 16:02:27 2015 UTC,Lucky! I just dropped 90$ on a copy! but good games like these are always raising in price.
nes,37kvl6,Slayback,2,Thu May 28 16:04:16 2015 UTC,If it makes you feel any better I think it's worth it. :).
nes,37kvl6,FF7Cid,1 point,Thu May 28 16:06:34 2015 UTC,"After watching a few videos, I was sold. Action Platformers are my favorite NES games and it seems like Metal Storm is really unique, kind of reminds me of one of the stages on Mega Man 5 but expanded to a whole game."

nes,37kvl6,SpaceJockey1979,1 point,Fri May 29 16:43:41 2015 UTC,"Every single online review and video review, AVGN and others are known for causing price hikes.  All the online articles stating, Games you may have that you didn't know are worth $$$$$.  Lots of shit like that.  Plus the kid generation that grew up with NES is old enough to afford all the games they never had before."
nes,37kvl6,TheWiiGuy_GGG,1 point,Thu May 28 17:58:43 2015 UTC,"It's the increasing popularity of retro gaming, and with price charting/rarity sites as well as popular Reviewers and Let's Players exposing certain games, I'm sure more and more sellers of those popular games catch onto oncoming demand and increase the prices.   It's a whole lot of factors, but with the Internet and so many more people talking about these games than 10+ years ago, it's taking effect."
nes,37kvl6,TheMovieMaverick,-3,Fri May 29 01:06:21 2015 UTC,"damn, as far as ebay and NES collecting, some of you people have no idea what the hell youre talking about"

nes,37as90,captain_herbal_life,3,Tue May 26 06:30:58 2015 UTC,"The NES has a LM7805 voltage regulator in it, this means it can support any AC adapter from 6v up to ~30v, I would not recommend you use one that high, since what is not used turns into heat, and like OP said, can cause sound or video distortion. Just get a used known brand AC adapter in a thrift store or flea market that's 9v 1a and you should be golden.  For NES the plug is not uncommon, for SNES it is kind of uncommon, I would say proprietary, but if you have an old SNES AC adapter that died (like mine) you can cut the cable and solder it to a new adapter."
nes,37as90,shantigilbert,2,Tue May 26 21:49:52 2015 UTC,def would not go over 10-12 volts.  maybe not even 12 volts for long term use.
nes,37as90,_imjosh,1 point,Thu May 28 17:03:11 2015 UTC,"That's why I recommend a 9v, I would not even use a 10v one, where I live, with electronics the more heat I can avoid the better :)"
nes,37as90,shantigilbert,5,Thu May 28 17:19:12 2015 UTC,Just go to goodwill and find a plug with the right specs and a well known phone or vacuum brand on it.
nes,37as90,Zabii,1 point,Tue May 26 10:31:42 2015 UTC,"It varies, I've had good luck and bad luck from unit to unit with the three in one AC adapters. I've noticed the past two I've picked up have been unusually light and have caused some static using one plug (SNES style) or the other (NES, SMS, Genesis). But I have a few that work great."
nes,37as90,icantrecallaccnt,1 point,Tue May 26 11:26:53 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I got one of the combo NES/SNES ones. It worked fine for the SNES, but when I used it with the NES there was a constant hum."
nes,37as90,museman,1 point,Tue May 26 14:46:50 2015 UTC,"Well, for what it's worth there's really not much to the basic power adapters of the NES, SNES and Genesis. Really, the only thing you have to be careful of on the SNES and Genesis (and Famicom as well) is polarity. If the NES takes DC when it's expecting AC, it just runs the DC through the rectifier and might lose a little bit of power but it will get stepped down to the right voltage by the 7805 voltage regulator.  For whatever reason, Nintendo decided to put the voltage rectifier (the part that turns AC into DC) inside the NES (it was in the brick of the Famicom.) This is why you should never, EVER, EVER!!!!! use an NES power supply on a Famicom. I bought my Famicom ""for parts / not working"" and inside, sure enough there were a couple of blown caps, a smoked 7805 Voltage regulator and a dead fuse. The caps were easy to replace and the VReg is common and can be found at any Radio Shack if you still have one of those, but the fuse takes a little hunting for but it can be found on Digikey.  Anyway, that brings me off topic. Basically what I was trying to say is that all it needs to see is 9VDC. One could, at least in theory, take a beefy 12VDC power supply (say like the stock one for the Wii) and run three connectors in parallel (making sure you get the polarity right) and run an NES, Genesis and SNES off of it all at the same time. I've seen people who do it for the Genesis/Sega CD/32X combo."
nes,37as90,battraman,1 point,Wed May 27 00:03:07 2015 UTC,"Look for the heavy ones w/ an actual transformer inside.  Most new power adapters are switching adapters which can cause problems w/ these old systems (especially shoddy, cheap ones like the OP mentioned.)  If you do try to use a switching adapter, try to use ones that came from better, name brand electronics - think Linksys or Motorola; transformer style ones are getting much harder to find."
nes,37as90,_imjosh,0,Thu May 28 17:01:15 2015 UTC,I'm actually trying to get rid of one of the yellow box 3 in 1 power cords too.  I actually don't need it and had it laying around.  It is very light compared to regular power adaptors so that could be a sign of quality.
nes,37as90,SpaceJockey1979,-2,Tue May 26 17:19:45 2015 UTC,"I'm a bot, bleep, bloop.

nes,37aiwp,Data_Mining_Machine,3,Tue May 26 04:50:16 2015 UTC,"The original nes and the top loader use the same power cord, but these third party ones such major shit and should not be used. Just bite the bullet and buy an original one on eBay. They aren't that much."

You are better off finding the Power specs for the system and buying ANY replacement at a thrift store or something. I mean, just look at these reviews! You are looking at under powering at best or possible damaging it at worst.   I'm sorry for my outburst. I want people to enjoy their systems and there are so many scam artists making it seem like these things are a good idea. I'll look in my collection of cords to see if I have a replacement that will work. No guarantees though."

nes,37aiwp,rainwarrior,2,Tue May 26 14:27:50 2015 UTC,"Yes, it's the same adapter for both.  Also, have an upvote.  :P"
nes,37aiwp,Zak_McCracken,1 point,Tue May 26 05:26:38 2015 UTC,"It should work, but these cheap adapters tend to have a high dud rate.  If it was $5.40 with free shipping, I'd say it was worth it, but (at least for me) it says $12.66 shipping, which put it right out. It's not worth $18.  I find with this kind of stuff they don't do quality control testing, so maybe there's a 1/5 chance it was incorrectly built. If you at least have a multimeter you can verify the voltage with, I wouldn't hesitate to buy one or two of these (at the right price, anyway). If you bought two, you'd have very good odds that at least one works properly, possibly both."
nes,37aiwp,lartrak,1 point,Wed May 27 16:35:40 2015 UTC,I bet you have one that would work in a drawer or box in your house. Check the specs (voltage/amperage) and get to searching.
nes,37af08,Gamecube007,7,Tue May 26 04:14:05 2015 UTC,"I would say Battletoads. At least Ghosts and Goblins, Silver Surfer and Ninja Gaiden all have unlimited continues, making them a little more forgiving, in my opinion."
nes,37af08,metatronsaint,2,Tue May 26 08:54:25 2015 UTC,"Most games spend the early levels teaching you how the physics and gameplay works and increase difficulty in later stages through tricky level design and enemy placement (Super Mario 1 is the prime example of this).  Battletoads, on the other hand, is the most difficult NES game because it does precisely the opposite. As soon as you get a grasp on Battletoads' physics and gameplay, the game changes entirely. Level layouts change drastically and new gameplay elements are constantly being introduced. Clinger Winger and Rat Race are punishingly difficult because almost nothing in the game to that point has prepared you for those levels."
nes,37af08,keith_is_good,2,Wed May 27 03:20:12 2015 UTC,"I've heard it was made that difficult to make it impossible to beat on rent, thus forcing people to buy the game.  The secret of Battletoads' difficulty is that every level requires an astoundishing level of memorization combined with precise input. Unlike other games, there are no skills or reflexes that can save you from a hazard you didn't know about before: it's 100% impossible to beat a level your first time without knowing it.  What I've personally realized is that once you master a level you think:""It wasn't that hard!"". The only little problem is that mastering a level requires between 50 and 100 deaths, but you only have 10-15 lives through the whole game. So you have to beat all the previous levels 4-5 times just to advance to a new stage. It's one of the most frustrating thing on earth and requires time (20-30 hours) and a lot of dedication and patience. Just putting unlimited continues or a ""practice mode"" level selection option would have made the game way more enjoyable and fair without being less challenging."
nes,37af08,metatronsaint,1 point,Wed May 27 11:04:32 2015 UTC,"True... but if they'd done that, would it be the stuff of legend it is today?  And would you be here sporting Battletoads flair?"

nes,37af08,joeangler,2,Tue May 26 04:22:56 2015 UTC,"Excluding outright broken games, I give it to Battletoads. Most really hard games you can get down a pattern via trial and error and infinite continues; eg I can reliably no-death beat Ninja Gaiden and Castlevania III.  In Battletoads most of the levels past Stage 2 leave zero room for error. Even with pattern memorization and a Game Genie it's a brutal game."

nes,37af08,itsmevichet,1 point,Tue May 26 04:21:34 2015 UTC,Tetris is super easy once you get the strategies down. Every once in a while you get screwed by a ton of bad blocks in a row but for the most part if you start damage control soon enough instead of just hoping for that one piece you can get pretty high scores.

The Adventures of Bayou Billy is also a close second for me.  I have found games like Battletoads, Silver Surfer and Ninja Gaiden to be easy after taking time to get the patterns of everything down. But some games (like Sky Shark and Bayou Billy) are insane to do things right otherwise you have to start over."

nes,375f0p,Parenklisis,3,Mon May 25 01:04:36 2015 UTC,Well they also made deja vu and uninvited. They are the same design with different stories. Deja vu is a film noir story.
nes,375f0p,joshuar9476,2,Mon May 25 01:20:23 2015 UTC,"For some more detail...  In Deja Vu, you play...  someone.  You're suffering from amnesia and you've just woken up in a bathroom with some holes from a needle in your arm and a revolver with only three bullets in it.  Your goal is to recover your memory and clear your name.  While it's a good game overall, I find that even now it's a bit tricky to win and sometimes suffers from a case of Guide Damn It.  The Uninvited is my favorite of the three; you've just had a terrible car accident in front of a mansion, and your sister has vanished.  The puzzles can be a bit obscure at times, and there's a very subtle and unpleasant trap in the mansion.  But overall, I think it's the most accessible of the three.  If you've already beaten Shadowgate, this one should be a simple enough task.  Watch for callbacks to both Shadowgate and Deja Vu in this one."
nes,375f0p,spook327,2,Mon May 25 07:16:30 2015 UTC,Thank you.  It has been a long time since i played either.

But on the other hand I no longer have the time to sit and try to figure a game out like I used to so that is not fun either.  I have yet to find a balance.

nes,3724i2,Schlitz001,-1,Wed May 27 01:25:09 2015 UTC,"I predict that prices will begin levelling off soon and eventually decrease significantly. Collections are reaching their saturation points. Reselling is at an all time high. Collectors are getting to the age of needing more liquid income to support families. The appeal of having an unplayed stack of games can only last so long. Not to mention the inevitable bit rot that will make all chip based games unplayable.  Plus near perfect, inexpensive emulation.   Acting as if video games are an investment has all the potential to leave you let down."
nes,3724i2,TheCardiganKing,2,Sun May 24 07:10:17 2015 UTC,"You're probably right. I've been going on an NES cartridge buying binge as of late and my girlfriend said the same exact thing. I don't buy games as an investment, I legitimately want to collect them. I do think the games and chips may very well last much longer than people think provided owners take care of them.  I can totally see where you're coming from. Younger generations aren't going to want NES games because the nostalgia isn't there. Most games will probably plunge with the exception of the Mega Mans and some rarer games that might go for $10-$20.  The same thing happened when baseball card collecting bottomed out in the mid '90's. I was around 10 in '95 and I had tons of cards worth over $50. Then the market crashed and they've never since recovered in price. Collecting is based on want and as more of Generation Y ages other more important priorities (as you said) like family come into play.  My girlfriend is trying to encourage me to sell my NES games now while they're still high. She doesn't know I actually want to keep them. I have quite a few rare games at this point.  For the speculator that started this thread:  I don't think there are many hidden gems left. It seems since AVGN became huge others have jumped on the NES review bandwagon. Most games for the system have been reviewed to death; most games worth mentioning, that is."
nes,3724i2,GeneralRose,1 point,Sun May 24 11:58:49 2015 UTC,"Just tell her that you're not buying them to resell them, you're buying them because you actually want to play the games"
nes,3724i2,TheCardiganKing,2,Sun May 24 17:05:23 2015 UTC,"I've been following nes cartridge sales for literally the last 10+ years and they have steadily gone up year after year. It's a limited commodity that inherently becomes rarer over time. It's a no brainier. Sure retro gaming is in vogue but it's developing into a culture. It's a facet of geek chic and I don't see that going away any time soon as geekdom is spreading deeper and deeper into mainstream. Pessimists seem to see this as a ""sudden surge"" but it's been decades coming and has penetrated the zeitgeist. Saying retro gaming will crash is like saying comic books will crash which (even when marvel almost went bankrupt in the 90s) didn't happen."
nes,3724i2,TheCardiganKing,2,Mon May 25 02:57:07 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but comic book appreciation has more or less tanked. There was an over saturation of titles in the mid-'90's and it is largely in part why I stopped reading them around that time. Comic books, outside of the very old and near antique number one issues, have not appreciated well.  The problem with collecting is that for something to be valuable people have to want it. I am positive that once the people born in the '80's grow older that there will be less interest in collecting vintage games. There might be a spike when mid-life crises come along for many men, but then there would be a huge downward trend after that.  People should collect because they want a certain collection, not because they're speculating on price or using them as investments, which is moronic. Buy stocks instead or you might end up like the Beenie Baby hoarders."
nes,3724i2,Schlitz001,0,Mon May 25 06:04:49 2015 UTC,"i think this is a pretty inaccurate analysis of comic book trends. Many 90s titles are worthless, but as always popular story arcs and first appearances continue to grow in price regardless of decade. Do an eBay search for Incredible Hulk #181 and compare it's average sold price by year. This is the first appearance of wolverine."
nes,3724i2,releasethedogs,0,Tue May 26 02:39:27 2015 UTC,"Not trying to knock you two days on, but that appearance of Wolverine issue is included in that antique bracket I was talking about. Again, markets for all sorts of collectibles bottomed out in the '80's and '90's due to speculation and over printing. Collectors knew old cards and comics were valuable and speculated that those items would appreciate in value; a foolish move. The industry took advantage of this and made its money then and there at that moment in time. There was (and now is for many things marketed as collectibles) an over supply of items.  Our grandchildren are going to have no connection to the nostalgia our generation has for vintage games. I can see them viewing them as boring or as a quaint novelty. I may prefer vintage games right now, but most of the world has moved on. The current video game industry speaks for itself havng overtaken the movie industry in profits.  One day, when we're all old and dying, when our families come across our old game collections they may just recycle them. I'm willing to wager that more people than any of us think will be keeping games in very good condition throughout our lives and even by the time we kick the bucket there will still be numerous copies upon copies of most games.  Unfortunately, society has caught on when it comes to collecting and it's no longer much of a profitable means of investment. You think Magic The Gathering cards, the Black Lotuses out there, are always going to remain pricey? Once we grow older and interest wanes prices will plummet. I'm not saying those cards will ever be worthless, hell Black Lotuses might become an odd collector's item, but those other expensive cards popular because there's player demand for them? I guaruntee you they'll go down in price over our lifetimes.  The same will be said of vintage games especially since we're already placing less value on physical formats and the future is in streaming or purely digital purchases. Younger generations won't know or care about the value of real ownership and the carts we all know and love will one day go down substantially in price."
nes,3724i2,bossmanishere,1 point,Wed May 27 15:29:02 2015 UTC,"That's a well articulated argument that I respect, I just disagree. The point I was trying to make with the wolverine first appearance comic is that while the games as a whole may not hold their value, select titles will. I think that if titles like SMB, metal gear, mega man, and Kirby continue to prosper in the future, future generations will have an inherent interest in seeing where it all began (NES)."

In order of gentle to rough, isopropyl alcohol, then eraser, then Brasso. Brasso is definitely an abrasive, as are all polishes, but the active ingredient, silica powder, is extremely fine grit. Brasso WILL leave residue because you're literally removing some of the metal (though at most, a few microns' depth of it). As long as you clean it up afterwards (with iso or some other cleaner), and as long as you're not doing a daily clean with Brasso, you should be fine.  If it's still not working? As /u/TheCardiganKing said, clean your pin connector. Beyond that, get a multimeter and check for pin continuity on your carts, or just get new ones..."
nes,36zzlm,TheCardiganKing,1 point,Mon May 25 05:11:47 2015 UTC,"You should not use Brasso. That stuff is pretty caustic. I use it to clean my drum cymbals... You may have damaged the pins.  Try disassembling your NES and cleaning the pin connector. There sometimes is accumulated dirt on them from all the various dirty games that get shoved into there.  Unlike Pass said, I would suggest using alcohol. Household cleaners could be more abrasive than you think and I would not test the waters with them if your games are important to you. Alcohol tends to leave residue if there is too much used. Just don't drown your pins and clean your cartridges like you're bathing them in alcohol and you'll be fine. A little water on a Q-Tip won't do much harm if getting residue off is that important to you."

I've used more than a few of them (retron 2, 3, YOBO, etc.) and they all put out a muddy picture and off putting sound. All the controllers I've ever used are of poor quality and if you're going to spend $40 plus controllers that's about the same cost as buying an original NES. Because you are still going to be using cartridges, so you might as well make sure that you will have 100% compatibility (which these clones never seem to have) as well as the correct picture and sound.   TL;DR- Avoid clones like the plague if you want to enjoy your games."
nes,36y35h,captain_herbal_life,1 point,Sat May 23 10:54:09 2015 UTC,"I've used similar, they are great for the price.  Sound is kinda poor for NES games and a handful just won't work.  The convenience makes up for it.  The SNES portion will be better from what I understand, but still with a handful of incompatible games.  edit: I'm all about real hardware, I use an AV Famicom for my NES/FC gaming; all I'm saying is that these clones are cheap and generally reliable.  They're a great way to play old games you have laying around and maybe later you'd invest in real hardware if you start to build a sizable collection."
nes,36y35h,DNA128k,1 point,Sat May 23 03:05:51 2015 UTC,"I have one.  If you're going to use it for NES, don't use the S-Video output, as it messes up the display.  Also any non-original NES carts or flash carts will NOT work on this system."

I took a breif look on YouTube and the RetroN3 seems to be the way to go from the reviews I've seen, an added bonus is that it can also play Genesis games and has ports for the original controllers. If I didn't already own all three consoles I might have looked into getting one myself, it's a little more expensive but it seems to have a bit better compatibility and one of the more accurate clones on the market right now.  Just note that with these clones the music/sound may be way off and that not all games will be compatible. So if there are specific games you want to play, you might want to look into whether or not they work properly (one game that tends to be the most problematical is Catlevania III) before you make any final decisions."

Super Mario All Stars, F Zero, Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 and Earthbound Uncut work with absolutely no issues.

nes,36wpit,LotsOfBacon78,5,Fri May 22 19:14:48 2015 UTC,You probably have the two screws that are towards the front part of the tray to tight. They need to be snug. Back them out about a turn and a half. That should help.   The blinking red light just means either dirt on the game contact or a bad 72 pin connector. Try boiling the 72 pin with distilled water.  Here is a instructional video.

nes,36wpit,Gamecube007,2,Fri May 22 20:05:04 2015 UTC,"Make sure that your games are clean as well.  This is just as important as cleaning the connector.  You can use alcohol on a q-tip (keep doing it until the q-tips no longer look black and gross).  I'm guessing that since this is your first NES you don't have the bit to open the cartridges, but you should get one.  Then you can properly clean your games with an eraser:  http://www.cgquarterly.com/articles/cleangames.htm  EDIT:  Also just wanted to say that I'm sorry that your post got down-voted.  I guess some people are probably tired of the constant questions on the exact same topic, but I would rather help someone fix their NES then have them throw it in the trash thinking that it's junk."

nes,36nsuv,TheWiiGuy_GGG,3,Thu May 28 10:35:47 2015 UTC,"Super Spy Hunter is one of the best games I can think of that no one talks about, especially under the golden age of Sunsoft games! It's got some of the best fast paced action, and of course, the awesome catchy sounds of late Sunsoft!  James Bond Jr is another, this one is certainly a game that takes time to get into, but I love its challenge and its a unique experience from Eurocom, also the soundtrack by Neil Baldwin is exquisite!  Palamedes is nothing special for the most part, but it's a very simple, fun and addicting puzzle game by Natsume, and one of there more underrated titles, and can't forget a catchy soundtrack by Kyouhei Sada!  Isolated Warrior I don't think gets enough talk, it's an excellent title that is also unique as an isometric on-rail shooter, definitely nothing else like it on the NES!"

Other favorites of mine that have flown relatively under the radar:   Dragon Spirit: The New Legend - killer vertical shooter. Play as a dragon and collect lots of cool power ups. Dirt cheap game to boot. Zen: Intergalactic Ninja - part isometric action game, part platformed. Definitely unique for the NES. Developed by Konami. A Nightmare on Elm Street - fun platformer based on one of my favorite movie series. Arkista's Ring - Zelda meets Gauntlet. Whomp 'Em - some call it a Mega Man clone. Fun but very stereotypical of native american culture (which I find wrong but it's still fun). Nintendo World Cup - fun soccer game. I like doing the super shots and knocking out players from the enemy team. Dirt cheap. Nightshade - half point-and-click, half action game. Play as a detective trying to foil an Egyptian-themed evil-doer. Alien Syndrome - published by Tengen. Kind of a shitty shooter but I've always really liked it."

It has tons of chips inside, way more EPROMS than most carts, and is about 2 times to 3 times as heavy as a regular Famicom cart. I bought this on Craigslist with the Game Axe Color and a few good pirate controllers for $100. I purchased this bundle because my previous Game Axe broke, and I needed a replacement. I have a real Famicom, but I like to play the games on the go, so the Game Axe is a huge help. It was listed as ""Game Axe Color with Super Mario Bros"".

nes,35j1io,mmss,3,Mon May 11 01:38:00 2015 UTC,I say restoring just because these were all original yellow and scratched up controllers and now they are painted and clear coated to last much longer.  I feel modding is more of manipulating something to do something it was not originally intended to do.  These controllers work just the same as they did 30 years ago.

I challenge everyone to find another NES game with as much depth as that game has. The sheer vast amount of enemies, bosses, weapons, armor, items, characters, hell, even the game world are baffling for an NES game.

nes,35kgke,Christ-Centered,1 point,Mon May 11 07:16:01 2015 UTC,"I don't think I could pick just ONE favorite. There's a few games I'd say are my ""favorites"". Also a few games other people praise, that I don't care for.  Mario 1-3(and the Japanese Mario 2), The entire Mega Man series, 1943, Contra and Super C.  As for reasons, I dunno really. They're just games I tend to come back to when I'm in the mood for NES. I can pick any of those games up, and just..play. I'm not overly worried about winning, or doing things in the correct order. I can just enjoy the games. Even if I die, I can keep playing.  Another game I quite like, which I wouldn't say is my FAVORITE, and it's technically a Famicom game, not NES, is Moon Crystal. It's fun, and the animation in it is good. Something about it just feels good to me.  3 things that most people praise to death, that I don't really care for, is Zelda, Metroid, and the Ninja Gaiden series. I just never got into them. Zelda and Metroid I just found boring. And Ninja Gaiden was hard as balls."

nes,35kgke,Wildzooz,1 point,Mon May 11 23:59:00 2015 UTC,"Practically exactly like the newer ones, only I feel that the newer ones haven't really improved on their predecessor. The closest is Kirby's Epic Yarn. I really feel like that game captures the same playful, whimsical atmosphere of Adventure.   If you've played Nightmare in Dreamland on GBA it's a remake of Kirby's Adventure.  Kirby and the Amazing Mirror on the same system is a great game too, but I feel the gameplay suffered for the backtracking and such. It's a metroidvania type game, and I always felt anxious about having the right power to be able to access the different areas. It worked well, but it's a far cry from the casual nature of Kirby's Adventure.   Anyway as you can tell, I really love Kirby!"

This could manifest in a number of ways:  Damaged CHR connection - graphical glitches  Damaged PRG connection - program glitches/complete lack of function  Damaged 10NES connection - endless blinky power light resets  I'm racking my brains, but can't think of how a drop would cause that particular kind of problem."

So right now, emulation is my only way to play NES games. I do love my emulation. I have my collection of custom palettes, and the NTSC filter is great, especially on Nestopia where you can completely customize it with sliders. I also use my USB SNES controller with it, which is nice.  If I ever did buy another NES, I'd probably want to get a flashcart for it. Right now, money prevents me from buying an NES and flashcart. Same reason I can't buy an SNES flashcart. But IF I could, I'd rather a flashcart.

As far as compatibility goes, that is one of the main reasons a Flashcart sounds awesome, but don't they also have some compatibility issues? (special chips)"

nes,35eoh9,CHIBI_titan,1 point,Sat May 9 21:36:24 2015 UTC,If it's just the A+B buttons that are dead it's gotta be a problem on the circuitboard of the controller. The fact that the D-pad still responds means the controller's shift register is still sending bytes to the NES when polled (asked for input) by the program.
nes,35eoh9,earthtoannie,0,Wed May 13 19:31:08 2015 UTC,"Just give it a wash. Tear it completely apart and wash everything in the shower, with toothbrush and soap and warm water.

nes,35cppf,Power0fCheese,2,Sat May 9 01:17:24 2015 UTC,"Most of this is great fun, and involves more research than the average retro gaming nostalgia, but there's one which should have been caught before publication - claiming that Game Genie codes for palette changes were actually unlocking hidden shout-outs to fans? The Gameboy wasn't even released back then.   It scans like the kind of random facts many of us made up when we were too young to know better, in order to put the world together in a way that made sense. Unless it's not meant to be serious, but the internet eats anyone who uses figurative language alive for breakfast, and then whines about food poisoning."

nes,3563u0,Eldgrim,3,Thu May 7 12:40:17 2015 UTC,I actually had an issue with a copy of rbi baseball 2 as well recently. I feel like the tengen carts work better if you pull them towards the front of the console as much as you can before booting. Hopefully that helps
nes,3563u0,Deadfish211,2,Thu May 7 14:14:45 2015 UTC,I'll try.
nes,3563u0,Shadax,3,Thu May 7 19:13:36 2015 UTC,"Any luck?  The way I would get a game to work in this situation was to push it in just enough so the very edge of the cartridge is still over the ledge of the console, like a millimeter, just enough to where it's not in enough.  Then I would push down gently until it sinks against that edge, if that makes sense.  It's basically putting the game in as far forward (as oppose to all the way in) as you possibly can.  It worked like a charm."

nes,35668e,cola_warrior,2,Thu May 7 13:04:25 2015 UTC,"It will work.  The voltage needs to be the same (well you can go higher but don't, the LM7805 voltage regulator can take higher than 9V).  Amps needs to be the same or higher and the polarity needs to be the same.  The original Nintendo actually took AC input (it has it's own rectifying circuit inside) but you can use a DC power supply.  EDIT: Oops, the original power supply didn't have polarity because it's AC.  Just get a power supply that's positive tip.  EDIT 2: The 50/60 Hertz difference won't matter since the NES rectifies the input to DC."
nes,35668e,grink,2,Thu May 7 17:03:02 2015 UTC,"The polarity is not important, there is a rectifier in the NES. Any power adapter with enough amps will work fine. I use a 12V adapter, it works OK, the 7805 doesn't overheat."

I guess Gorilla glue would be the same.    If you are not sure you want it permanent, use wood glue, or regular white paper glue, just make sure it completely dries before you move it.     also, try /r/consolerepair ;)"
nes,34yzrp,shantigilbert,2,Tue May 5 20:59:01 2015 UTC,"I would say, for a permanent solution, use a razor blade to scrape any adhesive residue from the backside of the sticker, and then use a two-part epoxy to adhere them together. Use a disposable brush of some kind, and paint a ""ring"" around the inside edge (meaning around every buttonhole and d-pad cutout) and the outside edge, about 1/4"" from the edge. Fill the rest of the space with feint zigzags of epoxy."
nes,34yzrp,BangkokPadang,1 point,Tue May 5 21:42:01 2015 UTC,"I advise against gorrila glue, as it would be very easy for it to expand unevenly and make a mess of the situation. I can also suggest that there are some pretty neat custom face plates available online."

nes,34sf6h,IM_MT_,2,Mon May 4 17:08:35 2015 UTC,"""rediculously"" easy is an exaggeration.  It's not nearly as hard as people make it out to be, but the bosses and certain traps in levels will still get you if you aren't familiar or have memorized them.    with that said, Contra isn't nearly as hard as a lot of people make it out to be.

I think the length of the game combined with the route choices make it appear harder than it is, though.  I agree with you on Mega Man, though: the first Mega Man was a bit challenging at times, but I don't think the series would have been nearly as popular if the ones that followed it were as difficult.  I remember renting and beating a number of them throughout my childhood, each within a weekend (the mom & pop rental store in my hometown was closed on Sunday, and I rarely ever rented past that two-day window)."

Also, I think the difficulty of the Mega Man games is absolutely perfect."
nes,34sf6h,LyndonSlewidge,2,Mon May 4 11:42:38 2015 UTC,"I think there is a difference between difficult and bad design/cheap tactics.  Games like Mega Man, Contra, Castlevania, etc. are certainly challenging games, but they are (mostly) fair and once you start to learn and become familiar with the game they are definitely winnable.  In contrast, some games just feature such terrible controls and design that they are truly cheap.  When the challenge of the game comes not from intentionally designed puzzles and fights but poor controls and arbitrary hurdles the challenge comes from you working against the poor design.  Certainly something like a Mega Man game is hard at first, but once you put in some work it's all very fair, fun, and challenging."
nes,34sf6h,LyndonSlewidge,2,Mon May 4 15:47:09 2015 UTC,Double Dragon 3. I beat it very easily.

As far as I know, you can't get hit at all while doing the tag team hurricane kick.  The only real trick is for 2 players is the jumping sections of Act 5."

nes,34sf6h,followmarko,2,Thu May 21 19:35:31 2015 UTC,"Battletoads is a very difficult and frustrating game, but the turbo tunnels really aren't THAT hard.  People just die and get all mad and never wanna play again.  You could say that about a lot of NES games if you wanna go down that road.  And I have beaten Battletoads without cheats or warps, and it is a seriously hard game.  But it gets really hard around level 7 on.  and it takes a lot of practice.  I don't think Contra and Super C are nearly as hard as a lot of people make them out to be.  Again, they die, and don't want to try any more because they died and gotta start over and get all mad, instead of trying again and paying attention to wtf you are doing.  Mega Man games are tricky but with the generous password system and energy tanks (EXCEPT for mega man 1, that one is pretty rough) they're not that bad.  It's more knowing what weapons work on what boss than anything and not just running as fast as you can and jumping instead of (again) watching wtf you are doing.  I find Ninja Gaiden 1 and Castlevania 1 to be really punishing and unforgiving.  Even with continues.  People who have beaten these games must have some serious discipline."
nes,34sf6h,quezlar,1 point,Tue May 5 06:59:15 2015 UTC,I've actually beaten Castlevania without continuing. The only part I still find challenging is Dracula's first form. That timing can be rediculous.
nes,34sf6h,BuzzThunder,4,Wed May 6 04:22:25 2015 UTC,"One that I found surprisingly easy was ninja gaiden, the game is based around never letting go of the run button. All the enemies appear on screen in the perfect spots to dodge or hit them but you have to be running when they appear otherwise they end up In a place that's awkward. Once you get the hang of it it actually had a very authentic ""I'm a ninja kicking some ass"" vibe to it that is just purr genius for a game of its limitation. Still hard as shit compared to some games but no where near the behemoth people say it is."
nes,34sf6h,ThetaReactor,5,Mon May 4 11:10:29 2015 UTC,"Sorry, but I have to completely disagree with this. Maybe the general controls aren't as hard as people make them out to be, but you can't possibly say that the final act, broken up into three stages and multiple final bosses, is anything close to easy. You had to be near flawless to beat the game. I did it one time about eight years ago and I had to leave the NES on overnight. Never again."

I've been able to beat all of them since I was a kid without TOO much effort. The Castlevania's are challenging, but I wouldn't call them particularly difficult. Especially C3,, since you have unlimited continues, you can literally keep trying until you beat the sectiom you're stuck on. I don't remember if there were unlimited continues in C1... C2,, though, I would call difficult because it's broken and lies to you about what to do and where to go, not because of gameplay though.  I'm going to nominate Ghosts n Goblins for this one. Yeah, it can be difficult, but it has the same benefit of unlimited continues. Just keep trying and you'll eventually get it. I've never felt super frustrated playing that game, and can usually finish off both quests in a couple of hours at most."

nes,34qno3,SlothDaemon,2,Mon May 4 12:21:45 2015 UTC,Time Lord. I'm convinced that the entire game was designed just to force kids to call into the Nintendo help line. Each level you had to do different random things that there was no indication of at all. it was so unintuitive that it had to be by design.

nes,34qno3,clacas,4,Tue May 5 02:40:10 2015 UTC,"Ok, im done with Raid 2020.  First the controls, are weird, you are not allowed to go between axis X and the strangest axis Y  you can imagine at the same time, so its one direction at the time, its hard to control, mostly because you have to enter doors, kill enemies but most important its not imposible.  The game features a lot of variety like: Different kinds of weapons, a jetpack, capability of return in both directions, a life bar (and hearts to refill it) so the game its not imposible to beat.  One thing i liked was the fact that the enemies stay dead once you have take them away, so the game can progress faster.  That was just the level one, the level 2 is a mission where you use  a jetski. The controls have a little delay but a hardcore player will notice soon and will not have problems controlling the jetski and his weapons.  Its a awkward game with awkward controls ... but is not the worst game ever . The progresion is also kind of rewarding, the power ups are many and the heart sistem make the game playable and beatable.  Thats why i take my upvote once more, its a bad game, but not the worst by far. (and thanks a lot for the invitation, love to play all kind of games, the worst are the most fun some times)"

Some of the games still had old video store rental stickers on them and he shaved a dollar off here and there when they were dirty and needed quite an effort to rehabilitate.  I got into a conversation with him how N.E.S. games have become kind of inflated in the past ten years (since Funcoland/Gamestop liquidated a lot of stuff) and he gave me the whole spiel of, ""Well, if it's reflective of what people are willing to pay, then I think the prices are justified.""

nes,34jcqm,ChrisRK,1 point,Fri May 1 20:10:08 2015 UTC,Could you post a picture of the adapter? I'm from Europe and all the AC adapters I've seen for the NES or the SNES (they use the same adapter) are either this one or this one. The one with the silver label is the SNES one but can be used with the NES. Both of them have the blue plug though. Maybe you've got a universal adapter?

It's made for the NES (the model is NES-002 just like mine), yet it has a different plug and the information is not displayed the same way. Could it be for a peripheral for the NES that could require an AC adapter?    Edit: Ok, I've just seen another one just like yours on a swedish site, but it says it's for the NES. I've seen ac adapters like the ones I've got with the black plug too, so apparently there are some variations. Why your plug doesn't fit your console is puzzling me. Maybe some PAL regions used different adapters and console inputs?"

""The first Seiken sold well enough to warrant the creation of a sequel, which was planned as Squareâs debut title for Nintendoâs PlayStation CD-ROM system being developed in collaboration with Sony. But once again, the medium spoiled the message; when Nintendo pulled the rug out from under Sonyâs feet and decided to axe the idea of a Super NES CD-ROM add-on altogether, SD2 was hastily repurposed as a standard SNES cartridge game.""

nes,34cedy,LonelyCannibal,1 point,Thu Apr 30 15:12:04 2015 UTC,"Final Fantasy Adventure:       Final Fantasy Adventure, originally released in Japan as Seiken Densetsu: Final Fantasy Gaiden (èå£ä¼èª¬ ï½ãã¡ã¤ãã«ãã¡ã³ã¿ã¸ã¼å¤ä¼ï½ ?), and later released in Europe as Mystic Quest, is a Final Fantasy spinoff and the first game in the Mana series. Published by Square in 1991 on the original Game Boy, it later saw a North American re-release by Sunsoft in April 1998.   Originally being developed under the name Gemma Knights, features gameplay roughly similar to that of the original The Legend of Zelda game, but with the addition of role-playing video game statistical elements. Along with Final Fantasy Mystic Quest, Final Fantasy Adventure was the first Final Fantasy game to be released in Europe. A remake, Sword of Mana, was released in 2003 changing the plot and many gameplay aspects. A second remake was released on mobile phones in Japan which only improved the graphics and music of the original version.  The story follows the hero and the young heroine as they attempt to thwart the Dark Lord of Glaive and his sorcerer assistant, Julius, from destroying the Tree of Mana and dooming their world. The game was released with many familiar elements of the Final Fantasy series, such as Chocobos, but these were later changed to feature common enemies and the gameplay style of the Mana series.  Final Fantasy Adventure was met with generally positive reviews at the time of its release. Over the course of time, reviewers have considered it one of the best action adventure games on the Game Boy. The game also spawned an entirely new game series, called the Mana series, which became a successful video game RPG franchise.

Seiken Densetsu released for Gameboy and as Final Fantasy Adventure in the US. Seiken Densetsu 2 AKA Secret of Mana released for the SNES   A game named Seiken Densetsu was for a moment going to be for the NES.  That got cancelled and we never saw a game from that project.  So, they named another game for the gameboy, Seiken Densetsu becuase they already had the copyrights.  That game was Final Fantasy Adventure in the US.  Also remade for the GBA as Sword of Mana.  Then a sequel was planned for Seiken Densetsu on the SNES.  Seiken Densetsu 2 is Secret of Mana in the US.  Also, Final Fantasy IV was going to be for the NES originally.

The other versions only have three rounds with a top value of $1000 in all of them and the third round is always the Speed-Up Round.

I've not used the Yobo, so I can't tell you about its quality.    Of the clones I've used, the Hyperkin Retron 1 is the best by far.  Still not as good as the original hardware, but worlds better than either the Retro Duo or the Retro Entertainment System.  I was actually completely bewildered by the poor performance of the RES, as I thought it was the same machine internally as the Retron 1, but both the sound and video quality were awful.    Of course, the original hardware is the best way to do it.  But if you're going to get a clone, the Retron 1 is good.  Specifically compared to the Retro Duo, the colors look more accurate (if a bit over-saturated), and the sound is much, much closer to the original system (though still not quite as good)."

nes,3483if,muxman,1 point,Wed Apr 29 03:33:43 2015 UTC,"an HDTV makes the image ""stretched"" out   That can be fixed by settings on you HDTV most of the time.  My tv does that and it has an option to fix it and display correctly."
nes,3483if,NPCtendo,1 point,Wed Apr 29 11:03:39 2015 UTC,"If you're using composite on your retro duo (the yellow, red, and white cables), then the image quality should be about the same (on mine, the retro duo looks washed out while the retron 1 looks slightly oversaturated, but I'd say the retron 1 looks better).  If you're currently using s-video then the retron 1 will look fuzzier by comparison (simply because s-video is superior to composite), but the color should still look better.  Neither is ideal for playing on an HDTV, but if you're not willing to spend the money on an original NES then you definitely don't want to spend the money on a Retron 5 or AVS (which isn't even out yet) or an RGB mod for an NES plus a framemeister.  If you have the space, though, you might want to consider just getting an old CRT TV.  I bought a Sony Trinitron (a very nice CRT TV) for $3 from a thrift store a few weeks ago."

You can mod it to use RGB, and then buy an upscaler to turn that into HDMI, but it's difficult and expensive.  Honestly, until the AVS comes out (a fan made clone console with HDMI output), the best way of getting good image quality for NES games on an HDTV is to use emulators."

So how old is Karnov? He lived all the way through ancient times of dinosaurs and wizards, only to be beaten down by a Bad Dude in 1989. Sad really when ya think about it. Or perhaps it speaks to volume of how Bad of a Dude you really are.  And after typing all of this I looked up the game on Wikipedia and lo and behold, here's what I found.    From the wiki article   ""As Data East's mascot, the title character was reintroduced in many other Data East games, including Bad Dudes Vs. DragonNinja in which he played a boss in the first level.   So it's true. From ""Karnov"" to ""Bad Dudes,"" you go from being the boss, to beating the boss."

As others have said it does get tough, but as a kid that made victory all the sweeter, despite the crappy ending. :) I don't know if it deserves a place in, say, a list of 100 all-time classics.

nes,340b5l,groovy_giraffe,3,Mon Apr 27 07:51:40 2015 UTC,"As the others have already said, I'd suggest disabling the lockuout chip (and you can play pirate games too!) and boiling the original pin connector. Don't worry about it, the plastic won't melt or deform and the contacts don't rust."
nes,340b5l,Mr_Patatoo,2,Mon Apr 27 15:12:08 2015 UTC,What is it about the lockout chip that takes away the ability to play standard games?
nes,340b5l,Mr_Patatoo,3,Mon Apr 27 19:06:48 2015 UTC,"As far as I know, the lockout chip prevents the console from ""reading"" games from different regions. PAL consoles can only play PAL games and NTSC consoles can only play NTSC games. Neither of them can play bootleg/pirate games. Even in PAL territory there were different regions (PAL-A and PAL-B) and if I remember correctly you couldn't play a PAL-A game on a PAL-B console and viceversa. However the region lock chip can fail over time too, resulting in your console not being able to play games from your region (blinking red light). That's why a lot of people just disable the chip. It's a quick and easy mod, and there're plenty of tutorials out there."
nes,340b5l,Mr_Patatoo,2,Mon Apr 27 19:30:42 2015 UTC,"The lockout chip was the red light problem but my connection isn't strong enough to play normally, I boil the pins, cleaned the games but still getting a steady grey or colored screen unless I really wiggle the cartridge"
nes,340b5l,Mr_Patatoo,3,Mon Apr 27 19:56:06 2015 UTC,"Hmm that's weird... It's not the chip neither the pin connector then. Only thing I come up with is that the contacts on the board where the pin connector ""plugs in"" are dirty. Try cleaning them (the contacts on the board) with some Q-tips and rubbing alcohol. Rub them with an eraser until you see them shine and clean all residue left with alcohol. See if that helps and good luck!"
nes,340b5l,captain_herbal_life,1 point,Mon Apr 27 20:38:46 2015 UTC,"I took an Emory board to the pin connector then flushed with alcohol, connection is much stronger. I should go buy a new eraser before I try what you suggested but I'm up to about a 90% success rate. Now the problem may be the game I'm trying, example: Metal Gear won't even give me color so the game may be the problem."
nes,340b5l,HarryManilow,3,Mon Apr 27 21:06:26 2015 UTC,"Great! A regular eraser will work just fine, fyi. If you have the special screwdriver, open the games and do the same to their contacts. The games look like new and work perfectly!"

nes,33zry9,kwkbox,6,Mon Apr 27 03:54:51 2015 UTC,"Mickey Mousecapades is a logical choice based on it's wonky controls and queer development as you pointed out. I give it some leeway though because it is an earlier release, it's still playable, and fun all the way through (IMO). Granted, I played it as a kid when games were $50 and you had to make the best of them.  I'd say Adventures in Magic Kingdom. It doesn't feel like a Capcom game and instead feels generic and boring to me. Talespin isn't great either, but I don't think it's as bad as it's usually made out to be. That said, a not-so-good Capcom game is still better than a lot of other NES games."
nes,33zry9,BigBobBone,4,Mon Apr 27 05:36:17 2015 UTC,"Man, Hudson made some of the worst games imaginable.

nes,33zry9,KTown_Killa,2,Mon Apr 27 07:43:37 2015 UTC,Well as others have pointed out a bad Capcom game is still better than many other NES games.  Its still playable I just do not recommend playing Ducktales than this.  Reverse the order to appreciate it.
nes,33zry9,turf1218,1 point,Mon Apr 27 17:35:48 2015 UTC,"It's a bit of an unfair/obvious question, as the answer for most is Mickey Mousecapade, since it was the only one of the Disney-Capcom games that wasn't exclusively developed by Capcom. But of course if it wasn't for that game, the Disney-Capcom games wouldn't exist.  For me it might be Adventures in the Magic Kingdom, which isn't to say it's even bad, just doesn't have the flair the other games that were Capcom-developed had. The Little Mermaid is up there as well, but it's only because it's too easy, which isn't really a fault worth deeming it the the worst."
nes,33ya04,Omegladon,2,Sun Apr 26 20:04:44 2015 UTC,"Technically, the NES palette will differ based on TV, version of console, output type, and whatever else. The NES color palette seems to be topic of a lot of confusion. Since the NES didn't use normal RGB, I think it was YIQ?(I don't know a ton about it, just what I've heard people discuss.) it doesn't have a normal palette we can just..grab. It relied on the TV to create the colors, and since TVs usually had different settings and stuff then, the palette was barely ever the same.  There's the wiki palette that was already linked, and about a million custom palettes people have made to look like a real TV palette. There's also a ton of custom palettes people have made to be the ""nice looking"" palettes. Ones that aren't quite accurate, but look better. And then there's the Playchoice 10 RGB palette that was official, but was slightly inaccurate with it's yellows and things. There's also the newer palettes from the Wii's Virtual Console, and the NES Remix games, both of which have different palettes.  Your best bet is to either use the wiki colors, since that's the more well-known one, or look up palettes online, and see if you can find one you happen to prefer the looks of. There's also at least one or two palette generators floating around online, with hue/saturation/tint options, to customize your own."

If she is on ravelry you can do a search for NES themed patterns and it will tell you what yarn and what color was used."
nes,33ya04,zomboi,1 point,Mon Apr 27 00:57:35 2015 UTC,"The NES doesn't generate RGB colours, so there isn't a definitive version of the palette (it's an analog signal decoded by the TV, lots of variables there).  This NES palette generator by Bisqwit creates a very good version of the NES palette, and lets you adjust the parameters: http://bisqwit.iki.fi/utils/nespalette.php  Alternatively, this generator by Drag is also pretty good: http://drag.wootest.net/misc/palgen.html"

But you have to remember, Japan is very homogeneous. All the people living there and born there have very similar traits and are from a very similar gene pool.   There are a very small number of foreigners there(1.98 million or 2% of the population). So their jokes of this nature can tend to seem a bit harsh from our perspective because they lack the experiences with people of these ethnicity's.   But even we, the western world, make jokes about Russians drinking lots of Vodka, The French being quitters, The Spanish male ego, etc.   So short answer, from a Japanese programmers perspective, who lives in Japan with little to no interaction with anyone from outside his country, only having various media from those countries (which can be pretty ridiculous themselves) NO, Mike Tyson on the NES is not intended to be racist."

nes,33lva9,Tonberry2k,7,Thu Apr 23 16:06:04 2015 UTC,Super Dodgeball. Infinitely replayable against friends.  Cobra Triangle & Chip & Dale Rescue Rangers should get honorable mentions as well.
nes,33lva9,240ZT,3,Thu Apr 23 16:51:18 2015 UTC,"Cobra Triangle is like a 10$ game and to me one of the best of the NES , its just so much fun!"
nes,33lva9,TricKyBoy,1 point,Thu Apr 23 22:39:08 2015 UTC,I absolutely love Super Dodgeball. C&D was on my Honorable Mentions short list (along with Jackal) but I got sick of typing...
nes,33lva9,240ZT,2,Thu Apr 23 16:53:47 2015 UTC,Jackal is great as well.
nes,33lva9,funny_little_birds,2,Thu Apr 23 17:03:35 2015 UTC,Jackal was very fun.  You ever play Heavy Barrel?
nes,33lva9,TheMovieMaverick,2,Thu Apr 23 19:23:45 2015 UTC,"Doesn't anyone feel that after learning the simple gameplay of Super Dodgeball, it becomes a stalemate immediately?  My friends and I would just keep catching each others throws until one of us got tired of the back and forth and let the ball crush them.   That said, yes it's an incredibly fun game, better in one player."
nes,33lva9,chimney3,2,Thu Apr 23 20:05:00 2015 UTC,"To me, it becomes a matter of brinksmanship. Who's gonna break first and try for style points? Who's gonna start catching the ball in mid air? Who's going to resort to using the back court players for cheap shots?  If you're just trying to win, yeah, it's a stalemate of throws and catches because the controls are entirely too straight-forward. As soon as someone tries to break the stalemate and have some fun, well... that's where the fun starts!"

nes,33lva9,Grantagonist,3,Thu Apr 23 20:34:33 2015 UTC,"You could add Shatterhand and Vice: Project Doom to the ""Ninja Gaiden""-likes.   The NES was one of the consoles that helped consolidate the ""dramatic"" action game, or the dark serious platformer. Gaiden, Vice and Shatterhand were important in these subgenres.   Also, you should include, as part of these NES-sentials, a multicart with the early Famicom line-up. The games in question, and the presentation specifically, should represent the NES experience of a great portion of NES owners - the Japanese because of the first impression of the Famicom, and the third world, who got these games and the idea of ""multicart"" in the early 90's, as an integral part of owning a NES."
nes,33lva9,xerdopwerko,4,Thu Apr 23 17:59:51 2015 UTC,"IMO, the Famicom should be its own list.  The English-speaking world had an experience different from the Japanese, and to try to unify them is folly."
nes,33lva9,Grantagonist,1 point,Thu Apr 23 19:37:09 2015 UTC,"I agree. Plus, I'm lacking when it comes to knowledge in region exclusives."

What I mean is that a huge chunk of the ""English Speaking"" region that got the NES also experienced most of its NESsing with pirates, multicarts, and hacks - and that a few years after the NES hit the original release in the States.   Famiclone multicarts (the first good ones, with lots of Famicom launch titles or copies of Japanese carts) are a huge part of the experience of the gamers that got the American region NES in nearby regions, like Latin America."

nes,33lva9,bass_n_treble,3,Thu Apr 23 19:34:45 2015 UTC,I skipped Tetris because it doesn't really offer anything on the NES that you can't get on SNES or computer or TI calculator.
nes,33lva9,FF7Cid,3,Thu Apr 23 16:43:37 2015 UTC,"There's something about Tetris on the NES. It had a very NES feel. The gameboy, phone, and PC versions I've played since then just aren't as good, even if they have better graphics.  The soundtrack turns that little puzzle game into an experience."

Its settings and sprites were just so bright and vibrant, it looked more like an SNES game, and it was certainly less one-note than Punch Out.  Zelda 1 is amazing but not as user-friendly.    Punch Out, SMB3, and Contra can all be beaten during a single sitting, so to me, these are The Big Three."
nes,33j4an,TheMovieMaverick,2,Thu Apr 23 02:27:05 2015 UTC,Super Mario Bros 3 and Punch Out were the two games that immediately came to my mind. So here's an upvote.
nes,33j4an,icantrecallaccnt,7,Thu Apr 23 17:28:09 2015 UTC,Mega Man 2.

It's certainly a hardy discussion to choose even the Top 10 best NES games, but some other favorites I would put in competition are Vice: Project Doom, James Bond Jr, G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero, Journey To Silius, Super Spy Hunter, Isolated Warrior, KickMaster, Power Blade, Shatterhand, and SCAT: Special Cybernetic Attack Team"
nes,33j4an,TheWiiGuy,2,Thu Apr 23 01:11:25 2015 UTC,Metroid for me.   Close seconds would be Zelda and Mario 3.
nes,33j4an,Hot_Fist,2,Thu Apr 23 02:05:58 2015 UTC,"I'd say River City Ransom. Catchy music, a fun atmosphere, and BARF"
nes,33j4an,WAHSNoodle,3,Thu Apr 23 15:57:26 2015 UTC,"I think it is Kirby's Adventure.  I say this because considering other games that came out on the NES this game is incredibly visually impressive, it has a great soundtrack and the gameplay is intuitive and far more forgiving for even the most casual gamer.  I think it's one of the few NES games that you could show someone from a younger generation or someone who wasn't much of a gamer and they'd find it enjoyable.  I'm not saying it's my absolute favorite for the NES, though it's way up there, I just think it's most well rounded game."
nes,33j4an,PhilosophicalToilet,3,Thu Apr 23 01:24:01 2015 UTC,"I agree but will add that I also happens to be my favorite game on the system, and also my favorite platformer all-time.

My personal favorite contender for best might be Mega Man 2, or just the entire Mega Man series.  I feel Castlevania/Castlevania III and Dragon Quest IV also deserve honorable mentions."

nes,33i1qa,justinsayin,1 point,Wed Apr 22 19:49:29 2015 UTC,What? LOL. So you would suggest just keep going for a few more coats until I can completely cover them? I already have about 4-5 coats on it and I'm afraid I might cake on too much paint.
nes,33i1qa,justinsayin,2,Wed Apr 22 22:02:48 2015 UTC,"Without a picture, none of us have a fucking clue what to advise you."

nes,33i1qa,SlothDaemon,2,Wed Apr 22 22:24:49 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply. I kind of get justinsayin's point. I sprayed on a few more coats and it got most of what I needed to get sans some very small nigh indiscernible specks of gray. Servicing the controller is a must and the controller, for my first custom, is turning out O.K. Practice makes perfect. I learned a lot to apply to the second one I'm making.  BTW, to the purists out there, this NES controller was yellowing pretty badly so I figured I might as well make a nice custom one for the girlfriend."

The easiest way to describe it is, imagine Super Smash Bros on the NES. It's a River City Ransom game that is made as a 4 player brawler, 2v2 or every man for himself. There are some cool stages with different features like mines, electric barriers, icy floors, and so on. I wish didn't only come out in Japan, because it could have been huge."

nes,333bdw,SlothDaemon,1 point,Sun Apr 19 17:19:10 2015 UTC,The bags are resealable. GunSmoke/Castlevania/Contra get the most play from me since they've aged so well and are perfect for short gaming sessions. But most of my time now is spent working or playing Hearthstone.
nes,333bdw,pawxy,1 point,Sun Apr 19 19:20:21 2015 UTC,"Ah, nice. guess that extra bit of protection couldn't hurt. What would you say is the crown jewel of your collection?"

I made myself play through the entire game probably a year or two ago though and you're right you miss so much of the fun just by trying to race through the game!"

I could have used mspaint to make a more interesting and relevant image for this post.  1-3 is actually a beautiful and unique level with green grassy platforms that contrast appreciably with the red koopa troopers. That was the shot I should have posted. I picked the least correct image for this post that was still relevant to the text.  I'll try and grab something better tomorrow!"

nes,32vr0o,JosephLeo,2,Fri Apr 17 03:24:00 2015 UTC,When are you allowed to post your first milestone? 100?
nes,32vr0o,JosephLeo,3,Fri Apr 17 07:36:28 2015 UTC,"I'm not a mod or anything like that, but I'd say any reasonable milestone you set for yourself is postworthy.  Round numbers, fractions of the set, publisher sets, black box set, etc. OP posted his 600th and now this is his 650th. But that's acceptable because there's just so many rare titles at that level now.  600 to 650 is hard, 650 to 700 is even harder, 700 to 750 is extremely hard, and 750 to 765 is ultra hard, then those last three titles (Cheetahmen II, Myriad, Stadium Events) are near impossible."
nes,32vr0o,Hobbycoder,1 point,Fri Apr 17 13:52:19 2015 UTC,Reading that last paragraph makes my stomach upset lol. I probably won't ever own them all just because the price of those games are ridiculous. Also finding them are really near impossible. There's a lot of other NES stuff out there to collect.
nes,32vr0o,iwasinthepool,2,Fri Apr 17 16:42:03 2015 UTC,"No ill intents!  Realistically speaking, 0 to 765 is a matter of just bankrolling through it since all of those games are available all year round 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.  650 to 765 is a tough job if you're looking locally only.  Cheetahmen is available pretty much six times a year, Stadium Events available 3 times a year, and Myriad is available once a year (sometimes twice) on eBay and are probably the only way to get them anyway.    The fun part about the NES library though is that once you finish your set there's still a TON of other NES games to go for. First off you have the 6 test carts and one system cart.   Control Deck Test Cartridge Joystick Test Cartridge Legend of Zelda Test Cartridge NTF2 Test Cartridge Port Test Cartridge Power Pad Test Cartridge NTF2 System Cartridge   Next you have the PAL exclusives. In all there are 33 Licensed PAL exclusives and 36 Unlicensed PAL exclusives, excluding one particular group of games, and the one ""Asian Region"" exclusive title that's rarer than Myriad 6-in-1.  Licensed PAL   Aladdin Asterix Aussie Rules Footy Banana Prince Beauty and the Beast Championship Rally Chevaliers du Zodiaque Crackout Devil World Dropzone Elite Formula One Sensation Hammerin' Harry International Cricket Kick Off Konami Hyper Soccer Legend of Prince Valiant Lion King, The Mr. Gimmick New Ghostbusters II Noah's Ark Over Horizon Parasol Stars Parodius Da! Rackets & Rivals Road Fighter Rod Land Smurfs, The Super Mario Bros. / Tetris / Nintendo World Cup Super Turrican Tecmo World Cup Soccer Trolls in Crazyland Ufouria   Unlicensed PAL   4-in-1 Funblaster Pak (Australia) 4-in-1 Mindblower Pak (Australia) 4-in-1 Total Funpak (Australia) Adan y Eva (Spain) Booky Man (Spain) Corre Benny (Spain) Cosmos Cop (Spain) Creatom (Spain) Crime Busters (Brazil) Duck Maze (Australia) El Destructor (Spain) El Monstruo de los Globos (Spain) Fighting Hero (Brazil) Fire Dragon (Brazil) Fire Hawk (UK) Futebol (Brazil) Jackpot (Australia) Jovial Race (Brazil) La Alfombra Magica (Spain) La Gran Aventura Submarina (Spain) La Guerra Del Golfo (Spain) Little Red Hood (Australia) Magexa Soccer / Super Sprint (Australia) Magic Block (Brazil) Magic Carpet (Brazil) Millionaire (Brazil) Othello (Australia) Penguin & Seal: Arctic Adventure (Australia) Pipemania (Australia) Policeman (Spain) Side Winder (Australia) Skate Boy (Spain) Tanque (Spain) Twin Eagle (Australia) Volley Ball (Spain) War in the Gulf (France)     If you want you can go after that one extremely rare Licensed Asian Region exlusive game. Mah Jong.  and if you need all of the game titles released for the NES library you're going to need the remaining 69 Sachen Games. But i'm pretty sure there's 14 of them that made it here to the U.S. or to other PAL unlicensed regions.  ...  of course, you do realize though that there are a ton of licensed and unlicensed Famicom and Famicom Disk System games that never made it to the U.S., Asia, PAL, Brazil, and Aussie regions as well.  That's what I love about the NES library though. There's just no end to it! It's an expansive, huge library that's full of mystery, variants, re-releases and amazing stuff that makes it just so damn collectible.  In all, that means if you go after all the NES software minus the Famicom stuff there are 901 titles. Exclude NWC and there's exactly 900!    Category Total    NTSC (Licenced) 677   NTSC (Unlicensed) 91   NTSC (Test) 7   PAL (Licensed) 33   PAL (Unlicesed) 36   Asian 1   Sachen (exclude x-regions) 55   Total: 900"

I was saying I'm in it for the long haul and I was down voted for that. I love NES and I will not stop collecting for it.
nes,32vr0o,BelldandyMorisato,1 point,Sun Apr 19 06:04:53 2015 UTC,"Collect how you want to collect, don't listen to anyone's rules but your own.  Lots of older collectors are a bit bitter towards people who steamroll through entire sets like it's nothing. Others believe if you don't take your time it's done in vain, and others just feel people are going for fullsets as a fad.  Whatever it is, there's a clear divide in how people feel they should collect and neither way is wrong.  Enjoy your collection, can't wait to see you complete your set!"

nes,32t2j3,truename_b4,1 point,Fri Apr 17 15:43:37 2015 UTC,"Lovely game.  First run through the game is a rigorous workout.  Then there's a killer 2nd loop that's one of the hardest (good) games on the NES.  It's also notable for having a quirky mechanic (gravity-flip) that becomes second nature, so you get more interesting levels built around this added dimension yet it still plays like a straight-up action game rather than a puzzler."

nes,32ra0b,gianni_retro,2,Thu Apr 16 10:10:54 2015 UTC,"When I usually think of a dark and moody NES game, I usually point to the soundtrack, though NES games can garner big points in the visual department, especially from a particular source (Sweet Home or A Nightmare on Elm Street).  Going off what I said, soundtracks that have a relatively dark and a more particularly moody vibe from non-dark games would be: Zombie Nation, Recca: Summer Carnival 92', Sword Master, Platoon, Golgo 13: Top Secret Episode, Ghoul School, Die Hard, and Darkman (no pun intended).  Though I will say, I do think Bram Stoker's Dracula has the best dark and atmospheric music by Jeroen Tel, absolutely brilliant!"

I'm just not sure enough to say it like it's a fact.  I always felt like two levels after this one was just insane.

nes,32msf2,Deeblite,2,Thu Apr 16 00:41:19 2015 UTC,I used to purposely kill Raphael right before the last bomb. I forget why now. But I did have some reasoning. In my current state I am linking this with killing frogger every 2000 points.
nes,32msf2,BrotherEnoch,4,Wed Apr 15 08:42:03 2015 UTC,"Because every time you kill a turtle, the clock starts over but the bombs do not reset.  So if you sacrifice a turtle, you don't have to worry about racing against the clock anymore.    And Raphael is utterly useless in that game."
nes,32msf2,bass_n_treble,3,Wed Apr 15 16:36:28 2015 UTC,"Now I need to replay this game. I can't remember why I would intentionally kill a turtle when I could just finish the ""damn dam"" (that's what I called it) without dying at all. I remember making fun of other kids who had so much trouble with this level and then just sacrificing Raphael. WTF? It's emu time."
nes,32msf2,StillAnOutlawStar,2,Wed Apr 15 08:48:57 2015 UTC,Isn't there a jump in this game that is actually impossible?

nes,32nklu,CoinOpProductions,2,Wed Apr 15 05:31:55 2015 UTC,"Cool that you chose that game to review. You don't see a lot of reviews for Astayanax.  But you should work on the way you describe things. You use the words bad and sucks too often as descriptors, and those words don't really mean much without examples of why.   You mentioned that you looked up a code for invincibility in Nintendo Power but that it wasn't cheating and trailed off like there was supposed to be a joke there, but it fell super flat.   I feel like you tried really hard to find things to hate about the game. For instance, you complained that the sprites are large and bulky, and cartoony. Then compared them to Zelda and Mario. But lets be honest, there was nothing realistic about either of their graphics either. You just took a shot at the game and then pandered by name dropping Mario and Zelda.  It may be a sign of your age, but I was alive when this was a new game. The graphics were actually pretty good for NES, and overall I think it's a well regarded. Maybe not on the level of Contra or Zelda as a must play everyone gets the references, but I bet you'd find it in plenty of top 100 lists."
nes,32nklu,RadMcCoolPants,1 point,Wed Apr 15 18:05:30 2015 UTC,"First of all, thanks for the critique! It helps to hear what people have to say about our videos. I think one of the main issues we're dealing with when it comes to these videos is that Dylan doesn't care about the review when the game, in his opinion, is bad and therefore doesn't dedicate a lot of time to explaining things. As far as Mario and Zelda go, I think it's less about being realistic and just that Astyanax had sprites (specifically for Astyanax) that in game were huge while in the cut scenes he was not near as bulky looking. Anyway! Thank you again for your thoughts, we'll keep these things in mind for future videos!"
nes,32msw3,ILPV,3,Wed Apr 15 01:18:23 2015 UTC,"I had this ""problem"" once. After replacing my 72 pin, I did not put the console back together properly. Actually, it just wasn't put together tightly enough. But do you really need to press the cart down? It will last longer if you don't. Less movement. Less friction. It's a bonus, really. The pressing in and then down was something created to make the console more like a VCR. It's not really a necessary or good thing. Don't ""fix"" this problem, OK?"
nes,32msw3,BrotherEnoch,1 point,Wed Apr 15 09:06:00 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's not so much a problem for me as much as it just makes me curious. Guess it's just the death grip these connectors have. Oh well, it's of little consequence. Thanks!"
nes,32msw3,BrotherEnoch,3,Wed Apr 15 23:57:23 2015 UTC,"I ran out of 72 pin replacements, but had a terribly mangled game genie, so my last refurbish had a built-in game genie and the benefit of not having to push the cart down before playing it. They thanked me for it."
nes,32msw3,yeeah_suree,2,Wed Apr 15 09:09:29 2015 UTC,"My friends nes does the same thing. Not sure the cause or how to fix it, but I guess it could be a common issue. I too would be interested in knowing why/how to fix it."
nes,32msw3,icantrecallaccnt,2,Wed Apr 15 03:34:19 2015 UTC,The aftermarket 72-pin connectors generally don't work like the originals. After a lot of usage it might get to a state where it works when pushed down. But most of the aftermarket ones grip the cartridge with a death grip and generally only work in the up position.
nes,32msw3,Company_Whip,2,Wed Apr 15 14:57:05 2015 UTC,"Yeah after replacing my 72 pin connector, all the games booted up first try, and i noticed that i didn't have to press the game down. I thought ""cool"" and have been doing it that way ever since"

All the other were under 5 dollars, now a days they charge that almost for shipping alone.  Best bets eBay lots ( you'll eventually end up with doubles that you can turn around and sell ).

nes,32h5v3,crashdummie,1 point,Mon Apr 13 20:34:01 2015 UTC,"I hate when people do that. ""THEY SELL FOR 15$ ON EBAY!"".  First, you're looking at the ""buy it now"" prices. The completed auctions listings are usually much lower. Second, like you said, if I wanted to pay that price, I'd have bought the game on ebay and if you want that price, sell it there.  There's another shitty thing that people do too. A week or two ago, I was on a local sales facebook page. Some girl was selling Mario Kart 64. I PM her asking how much she wants for it, and she tells me to name my price. So I say ""What about 10 bucks?"".  10 or 15 minutes later, she messages me saying ""Someone else is offering me 15 for it."". I politely told her that I wasn't gonna start a bidding war and that if the other guy wanted to pay 15, he could have it. I also told her to have a nice day.  I didn't mean it though. This idiot probably kept going from person to person until she couldn't drive the price any higher."

nes,31yq4j,warrensr3,1 point,Fri Apr 10 11:00:22 2015 UTC,"Those NOS controllers on ebay really are great. I even bought a few extras and keep them in storage for when I need them.   If you live in an urban area with a lot of game stores, just keep your eyes open for controllers with good response. I just found a game store OEM  controller for $8. I'm always on the lookout. A clean responsive controller is heaven."
nes,31yq4j,Schlitz001,1 point,Thu Apr 9 11:06:48 2015 UTC,I wouldn't go for OEM controllers. There are plenty at original nintendo ones at thrift stores and whatnot. 10 bucks is a normal retail price per controller.

nes,31vxv9,JosephLeo,2,Wed Apr 8 16:45:55 2015 UTC,"Typically speaking the price variance of cart to cib is in different tiers.  Common and Uncommon games range from 50% to 100% premium on the cartridge for a CIB.  Rare games, and Hangtab box games are almost always a 100% premium, with even more higher premiums for better condition, mint condition can see variances as high as 500% for mint.  Blackbox games, especially in hangtab format are almost always triple and beyond, up to 20x for mint (especially for a game like DK Jr. Math)"
nes,31vxv9,gyp_casino,1 point,Thu Apr 9 00:08:34 2015 UTC,"The box always increases value, but the variety in game values is huge. Some games are worth $5 complete in box, some are worth $1000."

nes,31o928,CAT5e_,2,Mon Apr 6 21:29:57 2015 UTC,"Here's a decent guide I wrote that will help you with cartridge cleanup: http://8bitbeyond.blogspot.com/2014/08/rid-your-collection-of-stickers-and.html  For consoles and controllers it's mostly just using these same products and common sense. There are also special products that can clean the cartridge pins, or for an original NES you can swap out the whole 72 pin connector for a new reproduction piece. For controllers, I recommend getting some wooden toothpicks that you can use to pick out the nasty dirt along the seams of the plastic and crevices."
nes,31o928,puredynamo,1 point,Mon Apr 6 22:00:05 2015 UTC,"Awesome. I do have a couple with stickers so that will definitely help. And I will wait and see if I run in to any issues before I replace the 72 pin connector, but I will keep that in mind, thank you."
nes,31o928,icantrecallaccnt,1 point,Mon Apr 6 23:18:01 2015 UTC,Goo gone is great but you can also use a hair dryer to warm up the adhesive. Just heat it up for like 10 seconds and most stickers peel off easily. Then just use a tiny bit of goo gone to remove any stickiness on the cart.
nes,31o928,icantrecallaccnt,2,Tue Apr 7 14:33:16 2015 UTC,"Let's start by asking which system you were having that much trouble with. The 101 (the top loader) should read carts pretty consistently.  The next step is cleaning your games. Get some 90% or higher alcohol and some q-tips. Clean both sides of the inside of the cartridge that makes contact with the slot. Then dry it with the other side of the qtip, do this for every one of your games. You'll see the tip of the cotton swab get darker. That's dust, dirt and other things being removed.   Once you've cleaned your games, put them in the top loader and more often than not they should work on the first try.  With regards to the 001 (original NES where you push the carts down), the 72-pin connector that rads the cartridges can be problematic. There are a few youtube videos ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnxZIuYb9WU)  on how to restore these by boiling them but they can get beyond the point of no return. I once picked up a NES from a goodwill with mold growing on the connector."

nes,31j2ts,mauzy,3,Sun Apr 5 16:08:04 2015 UTC,"If you don't have any TV repair knowledge, try  to contact someone who does work on arcade games. Personally, I would use the same troubleshooting steps to fix that TV as I would if I were troubleshooting an old arcade monitor.   DO NOT attempt to work on it yourself if you are not familiar with tube monitor repair. Those tubes, even if they appear to not be working, can and probably will store thousands of volts that can kill.   That being said, if you're feeling adventurous and you've done a bit of research past what I am about to tell you, pop the back off, DISCHARGE THE TUBE with a discharging tool (Google it), let it sit an hour unplugged, discharge again, and check any and all fuses. If those check out, then I'd probably replace all electrolytic capacitors on the board and test from there. If you still get nothing on the tube and no sound, you're looking at a board issue around the initial power processing phase. If you start getting sound but no picture, check the brightness controls: if cranked all the way up you see diagonal white lines on the screen OR if you seen a dim glow on the tube but still no picture, then you're looking at signal processing (something I never messed with past cap replacement).   If you see anything along the lines of a SUPER bright horizontal white line, you may need a flyback replacement.  If you see a super bright vertical line, check out your horizontal width coil.  Take all basic troubleshooting tips I listed with a grain of salt: I haven't worked on a TV or arcade monitor for about 5 years, so I may be starting to get rusty!"

It's worth fixing, even if it's just to re-sell.  [EDIT] I hadn't looked into them in a while, but here are recently-sold listings on eBay. The remote, if it's the model I think it is, is probably worth more than the TV, if it works and is cleaned up."

You can fake playing Megadrive games on a SNES with a RetroGen, which is essentially a clone console itself in a cartridge form factor.  However, since I'm actually running on a Pi, I can emulate a variety of other consoles too. My initial plan is to keep the NES controller, which will also work fine for eg. GameGear, GameBoy, and a few Megadrive games."

Most of the time they won't invade your space because they'll jump on top of the pillar instead of through it. I haven't played in a while but I think you might be able to use the flame wave power-up to get rid of one of them. Or maybe it multiplies them and does no damage. I dunno. Good luck."

(Note the difference in movement speeds between the two.) The dogs will occasionally jump past the pillars into the spaces on the edge of the screen; this is hazardous, but you can learn to eyeball when this will happen.    You can also get a decent number of hits in when the dog is resting on the pillar, facing the wall: run a bit toward the center and start jumping up to slash.  (The fire-blast weapon is also a solid choice.)  By the way, you haven't felt true boss pain until you hit Jaquio and Demon on Act VI.  Even getting thru the Act to them is a nightmare, and then... well, you'll see :)"

Like so: https://youtu.be/h1hUIMMtlpo?t=6m13s. With the blade spin, you can press down and attack for a regular air attack so you don't waste all your Ninpo on the way there. You only need 5 if you don't miss so keep that in mind.   If you can't manage that, hide under one of the pillars and slash at anything that gets close, they wont hit you with their jumps because they land above you on the pillar instead. You can kill their projectiles with one regular attack. The one on the left with the bigger jump is the one with the health bar, you don't have to kill both of them to win the fight.

nes,316xri,kwkbox,3,Thu Apr 2 14:03:18 2015 UTC,"Interesting glitch. Here are my thoughts.  Bit rot is normally used to refer to code that hasn't been updated in a long time failing to interoperate with other things, despite working fine the last time it was updated. It's caused by the other software components changing in a way that makes them incompatible with the now bit rotted code. So, nonstandard usage, but also fitting.  If I had to guess, then I would say something is wrong with the character data on the cart. There are several places where something could go wrong. If a pin were dirty I think you'd see more widespread glitching with game logic and sound too due to the way rom is read. I wonder if the chip that holds the chr data was damaged on the board. Another possibility is that something is causing a short inside the cart, due to being stored poorly.  Have you opened it up to see if the circuit board is clean? Check all the solder joint too to make sure nothing is creating a short., especially on the pins of any ICs. Do you have a rom dumper? It would be interesting to compare this rom to the usual one. And you could upload it has a challenge mode smb3."
nes,316xri,dagit,3,Thu Apr 2 16:23:03 2015 UTC,"Yes, definitely damaged CHR-ROM (the ROM chip that hold graphics data), or lines connecting to it. The reason we can still make out blocks is that a different palette is selected for each sprite, and for each 4x4 block of tiles. This 'palette selection' is done in software (stored in the other ROM chip, PRG-ROM) which appears to be working fine. A ROM dump would probably give us a CHR-ROM full of FF bytes."
nes,316xri,sircoleslaw,1 point,Thu Apr 2 20:44:51 2015 UTC,"Oh right, I forgot that palette information comes from more that one place."
nes,316xri,dagit,1 point,Thu Apr 2 21:10:03 2015 UTC,I looked over the cart and it looks fine with no specific obvious damage anywhere on the board.  I do not own this cart but in the video Kyle explained he got it from a guy that found it in a damp basement storage and his theory is that the moisture in the air that was in the storage area over a long period of time caused this.  I unfortunately do not have a rom dumper nor the ability to make a rom of this cartridge.  I would like a rom of it though as it is a unique challenge cart as you said.  I wonder if you could easily manipulate a working rom to do this?
nes,316xri,dagit,1 point,Thu Apr 2 19:18:44 2015 UTC,"I did a google search and found out that rom dumpers are actually pretty cheap ($20 + shipping, $25 if you want snes support too):  http://www.infiniteneslives.com/aux3.php  Here are schematics to make one from scratch, in case you're into that: http://sourceforge.jp/projects/unagi/wiki/kazzo_intro_en  I think it would be relatively easy to make a ROM hack that has a similar effect. That is, easy relative to how hard it is to make a modded game. It seemed like most sprites and background data was coming through as a solid block of color instead of the individual pixels. So you could probably just change the pixel data in a normal SMB3 rom to look like solid blocks of color. I think the hard part would be figuring out exactly when the cart you have does that and which color it's going to use for the whole block."
nes,316xri,dagit,1 point,Thu Apr 2 20:18:50 2015 UTC,I will look into these options.  Thanks for the info.
nes,316xri,Darknezz19,1 point,Thu Apr 2 22:05:04 2015 UTC,I looked at the rom dumper a bit more and realized that the snes support is not worth it unless you plan to also buy a snes flash cart from them. They have a note that says it doesn't currently work for dumping snes carts.

nes,316xri,doowi1,1 point,Thu Apr 2 15:28:17 2015 UTC,I recorded with my toaster but I also own a top loader and I got the exact same results.  The game was fully cleaned.  I have been collecting NES games since my childhood and have over 600 of them so trust me when I say the game was as clean as new and still did this.  I really think a part of the board is just going bad and in this unique situation the game is still functioning.

nes,314tiv,NT_Redmage,2,Thu Apr 2 00:24:44 2015 UTC,"I kinda miss the old Nickelodeon, I really do. I know this is kind of a 90s thing, but hear me out. Imagine a channel were you could watch a whole bunch of different things. Adult oriented cartoons, gamesshows, kiddie cartoons, occasional anime, silly sitcoms. Essentially anything and everything preteen and early teens related you can think of. All in one channel.  Now imagine that it has degraded into nothing more than poorly thought out semi educational cartoon drek and Spongbob reruns as far as the eye can see (Fairy Odd Parents not withstanding mind you).  You have pretty good representation of what happened to this game, they took something with a lot of personality and kind of just shit all over it after taco tuesday. A perfect example of what Nickeloden has become wasted potential and no personality.  Double Dare for nes is an example of getting half the formula right and then just not caring anymore.  For the most part the games sound and graphical fidelity are fine. The trivia system works as intended(except that hosts grin, creepy) but the second you actually do something other than answer trivia questions, the game goes to shit.  All of the games physical challenges are nothing more than reading a meter. Instead of being engaging they are nothing more than trial and error. All of them use the same meters to judge where objects go and nothing else. Thankfully these are not the majority of the game, but it makes you dread whenever they come up.  The last part of the game(like the show) has a obstacle course that looks on par with the shows. And that's where the similarities end. Running requires you to mash left and right on the dpad as fast as you possibly can, some thing the nes dpad was never inteded to do. When you reace a portion where climbing is involed you have to mash up and down, then occasionally jump for a flag.  I tried on multiple occasions to complete the course, but was unable to. The game responds so slowly to the controls that I could probably run the course myself in real life, stop for a sandwhich and juice and finish it long before you could in the game.  I probably shouldn't be so angry at this game. I mean, it's just a licenced peice of expendable garbage that Nickelodeon occasionally puked out because they felt the need to have market presence everywhere.  I guess my real anger is that they got half of it right and then fucked the cat on the other half or it's my anger that something from my childhood is nothing more than a husk, only existing to make money with the lowest investment/effort humanly possible. Possibly both.  I'll see you all next time. I need a hug.ï»¿"

nes,30zzlj,CaptainAction,5,Wed Apr 1 01:27:09 2015 UTC,"Honestly man, the pin bending thing is totally overblown.  MAYBE if you regularly use a Game Genie for years, you'll bend the pins.  I have refurbished tons of NES systems and have never had to bend pins.  I think people bend them to make up for the fact that they aren't truly clean and they make better contact if they're tighter.  Honestly if you want to keep the NES in good working condition, just don't EVER put dirty games into it.  If you don't already have them, buy some tools for opening your games  And properly clean all of your games.  I never have a problem with my NES systems because after refurbishing them, I clean every new game that comes in to my house.  And congrats on scoring such a nice system.  Have fun with it!"
nes,30zzlj,wtfamireadingdotjpg,4,Wed Apr 1 03:21:50 2015 UTC,"Agreed. It's not the pins bending that's the issues, it's people blowing in games. The games get really corroded, and this rubs onto/corrodes the connector inside. 91%+ alcohol to clean the games (and a bit of Brasso for really bad ones), never ever blow in them.   If OP is that worried about keeping it as mint as possible, they should put in a new 72pin connector to abuse and keep the original somewhere."
nes,30zzlj,DSPLegend,1 point,Wed Apr 1 13:36:14 2015 UTC,This is a really solid suggestion. I say don't hesitate to open the NES up and replace the original connector with another 72-pin connector and preserve the original (both from dust and grime that the games will eventually get on the connector and the bending of the pins themselves). I think this'll give you the best return in the long run for you.
nes,30zzlj,Zombiii,1 point,Fri Apr 3 02:01:06 2015 UTC,This is exactly it. I repeatedly cleaned and bent the pins on the connector over a couple of days trying to get the games to work. It wasn't until I thoroughly cleaned all my games that they finally all worked. They all work flawlessly now. If I did it again I probably would have just cleaned the connector and the games. The connector now has a death grip on my games making it hard to remove them from bending them.
nes,30zzlj,gyp_casino,2,Sat Apr 4 12:52:04 2015 UTC,The only thing you can do (that I am aware of) is not leaving the cartridges in for long periods of time.  Take them out when you're finished playing.

Keeping a cart in the system probably accelerates it.  There's third party connectors that will likely be produced as long as NES is collected for, but if you're concerned you could buy a few extra or be familiar with the repair strategies (boiling, qtips, bending pins back, etc)."

Adventure Island is an awesome series.  Same with Adventures of Lolo,, all of them are solid.  Startropics is a ton of fun, and very cheap.  Solomon's Key is a great but very challenging puzzle game. Seriously it can be brutal. It's sequel, Fire n Ice, is a lot better but very expensive.  Ninja Gaiden if you like challenging platformers. Battletoads if you like impossible ones. Same with Ghosts n Goblins.  Lots of great Disney games too. Ducktales, Chip n Dale, Darkwing Duck, etc.  Can't believe I forgot to list Mega Man. They're all amazing, 2 & 3 are my favorites.  If you like SHMUPs, there are a bunch of them. 1942, 1943, Tiger Heli, Twin Eagle, Gradius come to mind.  Some good light gun games too, like Duck Hunt and To The Earth and Hogans Alley and Freedom Force.

With out it, who knows what would games would be like. There are three slots to save different games. Also, if you used the name ""Zelda"" when you created a new game the map would be re-arranged (Castles & secrets would be relocated which required you to search hard core.

nes,30qyj0,BloodBride,1 point,Mon Mar 30 13:15:38 2015 UTC,The reason might be why sell an all-in-one console with 30 built in games for 40-70 when they can still sell the individual games at 5.00 each on virtual console. I think we'll eventually see this.  The reason why it wouldn't play original carts is the level of support they would need to provide relating to 30 year old NES carts being played in newly issued hardware would be problematic.  They're not going to want to troubleshoot the malfunction regarding why of a 30 year old copy of Duck Hunt with corroded connectors from when little Billy spilled ecto-cooler on it while doing a homework assignment on the merits of Reganomics.

One, they could be honoring the collector's value of the original system, which is doubtful, but possible.    The second, and more likely opinion, is that they would have next to no real financial gain. With the virtual console, they can rerelease their games just fine. And they woundn't have to worry about the startup cost of refitting a factory, along with going back to recreating ancient processor chips, and dated methods of recreating the original circuit boards. And all this, for basically novelty. While I would like them to do so, I can see why they wouldn't."
nes,30qyj0,Nightfalcon4,-1,Mon Mar 30 11:11:30 2015 UTC,"would they really need to clone their own old circuit board though? So long as the chips do the same thing, they don't need anywhere near the same stuff. Hell, they could make the board smaller, lighter and improve the quality of the native crappy sound card... Also improvements in the fact it wouldn't need shielding the way it used to if they also updated the connectors used."
nes,30qyj0,BloodBride,0,Mon Mar 30 13:12:30 2015 UTC,"I've wondered this too. There are millions of people who grew up with it who now have disposable income. If done right, it seems like the sort of thing that a lot of casual gamers, non-gamers, and collectors would buy."
nes,30qyj0,BigBobBone,2,Mon Mar 30 03:44:18 2015 UTC,"Agreed man, it would sell like hotcakes. Figure $20 to manufacture. People would buy it up like it was gold"
nes,30s39o,Schlitz001,6,Mon Mar 30 05:50:02 2015 UTC,"It works by ever so slightly moistening the cartridge contacts with the humidity of your breath.  This allows the game to make proper contact long enough to pass the 10NES security check, before the moisture evaporates.  It isn't that blowing in the cart is a placebo effect, it's that it's a bad idea, for the reason that /u/captain_herbal_life stated.  Keep your cartridges and system clean and you won't need to blow into anything.  A q-tip and some rubbing alcohol is a much better solution, and is really the bare minimum when it comes to cleaning your games."
nes,30s39o,captain_herbal_life,1 point,Mon Mar 30 06:25:20 2015 UTC,"This is also a very salient point (about the humidity), and one I haven't considered as all my NES have the 10NES chip disabled."

nes,30s39o,Grantagonist,6,Mon Mar 30 06:59:39 2015 UTC,It also corrodes the contacts quicker and its likely just taking them out and resetting the connections is actually more helpful than blowing.  But whatever you think bro...
nes,30s39o,captain_herbal_life,-2,Mon Mar 30 05:57:24 2015 UTC,"Also, that study says ""it seems more likely"" that reinserting the cartridge is the real reason that it works. But where is the actual evidence? Where is the study?"
nes,30s39o,captain_herbal_life,1 point,Mon Mar 30 06:55:45 2015 UTC,"I get downvoted, but no one has evidence that blowing isn't a better solution than rocking the cartridge back and forth."

nes,30s39o,Grantagonist,-5,Mon Mar 30 16:21:35 2015 UTC,"I'm not claiming it won't cause long term damage, only that it works in the short term."
nes,30s39o,Grantagonist,2,Mon Mar 30 06:51:16 2015 UTC,"Next time just try taking the game out of the NES and then putting it back without blowing on it. Or better yet, clean it with a Q-tip and 90% alcohol (or windex depending on your preference)? We have so many better options (short term and long term) why damage something when you don't need to? Especially 25 year old electronics that can be hard to replace these days."

nes,30o4r6,DSPLegend,6,Sun Mar 29 04:02:34 2015 UTC,Have you tried the NES on a CRT television?   Are you using the Coax connection or the RCA connection?
nes,30o4r6,captain_herbal_life,2,Sun Mar 29 04:06:48 2015 UTC,"I'm using a coax cable, and it's on a modern television!"
nes,30o4r6,mazdawg,5,Sun Mar 29 04:13:54 2015 UTC,Try rca?  Rca is higher quality than coax anyway.
nes,30o4r6,mazdawg,2,Sun Mar 29 04:15:56 2015 UTC,Will the type of TV affect it as well? And is there a more technical explanation as to why RCA >> coax - I'd figure the different wouldn't be significant?
nes,30o4r6,captain_herbal_life,3,Sun Mar 29 04:19:46 2015 UTC,"One you get this problem fixed try both and you will see a clear difference.  Clarity and brightness are surprisingly better. Edit: I don't know why, just better to not have both audio and video signals on one cable I guess."
nes,30o4r6,captain_herbal_life,5,Sun Mar 29 04:23:58 2015 UTC,"Yep. Separating a signal makes it clearer, which is why component is better than S-video, S-video is better than RCA and why RCA is better than Coax."
nes,30o4r6,rainwarrior,3,Sun Mar 29 04:29:56 2015 UTC,"Well I certainly appreciate it (to everyone in this thread). Reddit is usually my last resort for these trouble-shooting type issues - this community is absolutely amazing and I'd hate to bother people when they're doing their own thing on NES, but I literally tried googling all sorts of weird things (like ""grainy screen NES"", etc) and got nothing! But of course the people of Reddit have come to save the day with experience and knowledge - something I greatly appreciate."
nes,30o4r6,Oakroscoe,3,Sun Mar 29 04:36:19 2015 UTC,Glad to help.
nes,30o4r6,Oakroscoe,4,Sun Mar 29 04:40:24 2015 UTC,"Using the RCA composite output will almost certainly help. It is a direct video output from the system.  The RF adapter takes the video output from the NES, and then modulates into a signal meant to coexist with all the other channels that would normally go through the coaxial cable. There is less bandwidth overall (causing a degradation of the signal, particularly the audio), so even with a good TV, the RF output is worse than the RCA composite output.  This is made even worse by most modern TVs, which don't have very robust RF demodulation (if at all), since it's become an obsolete technology. The quality is often very poor, as you've seen here."
nes,30o4r6,captain_herbal_life,2,Sun Mar 29 09:26:55 2015 UTC,"Ah I see. Well I actually ended up testing the NES on another TV (actually more new than my own), and surprisingly it worked absolutely great - the quality was so much better! Certainly I think when that TV was built, there was good attention paid to the signals it would have to take - something I've never looked at when judging TVs before.."
nes,30o4r6,captain_herbal_life,5,Sun Mar 29 19:37:11 2015 UTC,What kind of tv is it and how are you connecting it?
nes,30o4r6,mazdawg,3,Sun Mar 29 04:10:55 2015 UTC,Coax cable with some random HDTV I picked up on the cheap at an electronics store
nes,30o4r6,captain_herbal_life,3,Sun Mar 29 04:14:57 2015 UTC,"I had better luck hooking up my NES/SNES/64 up to my denon receiver and running it through that to my HDTV, if I wanted to play on the big tv instead of my smaller CRT tv."

However, I am legitimaetly curious why this is true - I'd love to learn some more information if you don't mind explaining."
nes,30o4r6,HarryManilow,5,Sun Mar 29 04:17:15 2015 UTC,"NES, SNES and N64 output a weird 240p signal. Most modern LCD TVs do not handle these signals well. Some of the early models of LCD TVs had the ability to read these signals better because they were bridging the gape between CRT and LCD."
nes,30o4r6,mazdawg,3,Sun Mar 29 04:20:06 2015 UTC,"Oh wow, thank you for that information! I didn't even bother thinking 240p signal was even a thing except for video recorded with cameras on older youtube videos - I will experiment on another television - and hopefully with an RCA cable as well!"
nes,30o4r6,j1ggy,4,Sun Mar 29 04:22:10 2015 UTC,"No problem, and the RCA connection will probably work much better on that TV. I have about 6 NES and two of them are hooked up to LCD TVs via RCA. Its a pretty clear signal and is still enjoyable to play. Its awesome that the NES 001 had the option for RCA connections (though the Mono audio is a bit of a bummer but can be bridged with a Y adapter easily) as most TVs of the day only had Coax connections."

nes,30ira4,dustmop,3,Sat Mar 28 05:54:25 2015 UTC,"I had considered it, but there's a number of technical hurdles.

nes,30fa3c,fastlane250,8,Thu Mar 26 22:07:05 2015 UTC,"If I remember correctly the removed pins were for interfacing with accessories that used the expansion port on the bottom of the NES, which never came to be."

nes,30fa3c,SlothDaemon,5,Fri Mar 27 17:26:35 2015 UTC,"The center pins were removed on many later carts as a cost cutting measure for manufacturing since they were never used.  If you ever test the pins, you would see that those center pins go to various places in the board, including the controls and the mysterious bottom expansion port. The possibilities for those center pins were never fully exploited though, so in the end, they removed them.  As for which one you should keep from a collector standpoint, It's fairly unimportant since I've never heard of the revision mattering to the value. But if you want to go by Comic book rules, then keep the older one. (as long as it works)"

nes,30fa3c,GorillaEstefan,1 point,Fri Mar 27 17:29:35 2015 UTC,"I think, too, that some of the center pins had to do with writing the save files to a game. when making a NES repro, a specific copy of mario 2 was needed for one project, i read because it had the added pins in the middle. i even had to solder a wire to one of the unused center pins to make the game work. my guess is the pins just went to somewhere on the NES that had to do with writing to the SRAM chips used for saving. I could be completely wrong however."

Those pins in the middle never got used for anything, so it was slightly cheaper to leave them out.  Just like in late 1987 they switched from the 5 screw design (with the smooth edges next to the top label) to the 3 screw design (with plastic hinges next to the top label), and then soon after started using security screws instead of the regular type that could be opened with a small flathead."
nes,30fa3c,SnackyChunk,1 point,Fri Mar 27 04:32:35 2015 UTC,"Another interesting thing about some of those early games is that they had to use Famicom boards to keep up with production demands, so you crack some open and they have Famicom to NES adapters built in."

nes,30c1kf,RobbieXtreme,3,Thu Mar 26 06:32:14 2015 UTC,"Yep, this is what should be done. I would also recommend that OP test the system after putting the 72-pin connector back on (but before putting the rest of it back together.)  If the NES doesn't work great at this stage, take the 72-pin connector back off and put it in boiling water. (See YouTube for tutorials.)   These three steps, (polishing motherboard contacts, disabling lockout chip, boiling 72-pin connector) are what finally got my NES working like a dream. I recently beat the first two Zelda games and the system worked flawlessly."
nes,30c1kf,wellsdb,5,Thu Mar 26 17:30:24 2015 UTC,Did not know what a lockout chip was until you mentioned it and looked it up. Thanks!
nes,30c1kf,rainwarrior,4,Thu Mar 26 06:58:40 2015 UTC,"Yes, it is a PCB (printed circuit board).  If I wanted to clean one, I would usually use isopropyl alcohol and a toothbrush. The areas you highlighted shouldn't be a problem.  The orange gunk is probably resin left over from the soldering process; it is not conductive, and can be safely cleaned away with alcohol.  There's really not much of an advantage to cleaning the motherboard, though. It doesn't have any moving parts, and dust/resin is usually inert. If you just like it to look/feel clean, then go ahead, but it probably won't change how it works at all."
nes,30c1kf,rainwarrior,3,Thu Mar 26 03:41:04 2015 UTC,"Oh I see. Did not know cleaning the motherboard gave no real advantages. I thought it'd increase current flow or something lol, but obviously I'm no expert on this.  However, I do like the clean look. Can I safely brush over the components on the back (like the diodes, resistors, etc) with a toothbrush? Are PCB boards really this tough?  And thanks!"
nes,30c1kf,lartrak,2,Thu Mar 26 03:44:15 2015 UTC,"It should normally stand up to brushing pretty well, unless something is loose or broken on it. The electronics on these boards are usually fairly durable. Don't use excessive force, but a scrubbing should be okay.  I wouldn't submerge any of it in alcohol. Just use it on the surface. You want it to be completely dry before you use it again, and liquid might collect in unseen places if you submerge it."

nes,30aeds,SerpentOfHatred,1 point,Wed Mar 25 19:49:59 2015 UTC,You should clean it more thoroughly.  Do you have the needed tool to open the game and take the PCB out?
nes,30aeds,TheMovieMaverick,2,Wed Mar 25 20:51:40 2015 UTC,Nope I dont have that neither an easy way to get one. I guess you can find those weird screwdrivers on ebay or something? But I got it working for now with a super tiny bit of alcohol on a q-tip.
nes,30aeds,Darknezz19,2,Wed Mar 25 21:51:17 2015 UTC,Were you not using alcohol before?  You don't have to use a tiny amount.  Go ahead and get the q-tip damp (not soaking wet) and scrub away.  I would keep doing this with new q-tips until they come out looking clean.  Then just make sure that the cartridge contacts are dry before you test the game out.

nes,307j9h,octhrope,1 point,Wed Mar 25 02:34:41 2015 UTC,I actually got a loose Felix cart for (somewhat literally since I forgot the exact price) a few dollars a couple years ago when the game was going for $30+ on eBay. I played through it about a year ago and actually enjoyed it despite it's low difficulty and lack of knowledge regarding Felix the Cat and the whole franchise aside from that it dates way way way back before video games were possibly even an idea.
nes,307j9h,ZeroBeast2,2,Wed Mar 25 08:34:27 2015 UTC,"Felix is an important character that really deserves to be remembered more. He started in the silent era and became the first cartoon star (beating out Koko the Clown.) His design and personality is directly responsible for the Disney/Iwerks creations of Julius the Cat, Oswald Rabbit and of course, Mickey Mouse. More relevant to video games is the fact that Felix's design is responsible for inspiring Naoto Ohshima to create Sonic."

The game is pretty free with one ups. That said, it's a really fun game to play and I'd recommend it if you can find it.   I wish Konami wasn't forever sitting on the Hudson Soft library.

nes,305wnr,AsmundGudrod,2,Tue Mar 24 21:03:48 2015 UTC,That's smart thinking. I've always wondered why we don't have precise dates for these things. It's not as though they happened hundreds or thousands of years earlier. We should be able to determine the date of an event from 26 years ago.
nes,305wnr,randomaccnet,2,Wed Mar 25 02:24:57 2015 UTC,The maddening thing is that pretty much every Famicom game has an exact release date attached to it. I don't know what the hell happened over here in the States.
nes,305wnr,glitchedgamer,2,Wed Mar 25 03:29:48 2015 UTC,I remember foundry buying the game in March of 1989. I was in 7th grade and track season had just started. I remember thinking about that game all practice and couldn't wait to get home to play it.   No way in hell it was May.
nes,305wnr,BBA935,2,Thu Mar 26 12:51:44 2015 UTC,"In the 8-bit era, games didn't have an official release date. They were put out on shelves as soon as they arrived, which could really vary depending on how far away your store was from the Pacific Ocean.  The first video game to have a worldwide launch date was Sonic 2, with Sonic 2sDay (the Tuesday before Thanksgiving in 1992)"

nes,305wnr,Grantagonist,1 point,Wed Mar 25 01:14:49 2015 UTC,"It's worth noting that for most of the NES era, there really weren't solid release dates.  Things got shipped out to various stores, and when they got them they were ""released""."
nes,305wnr,lartrak,1 point,Wed Mar 25 02:20:55 2015 UTC,"This is exactly right.  Publishers shipped out games, and whenever they got to the store, they were put up on the shelves.  There were not ""street dates"" for most games back then, meaning that stores didn't have to sit on games until a certain day, when they ere allowed to start selling them.  The best that I have found to try to nail down when a game started showing up in stores is to scour through old Usenet posts.  Unfortunately, the first mention that I found of Ninja Gaiden on rec.games.video wasn't until July of 89.  Usenet has proven much more useful to me when researching 16-bit games and newer."

Unfortunatly it is confusing in 4 player mode because player 3 & 4 have the same colors as 1 & 2, but with slightly different sprites that can sometimes be hard to tell apart. The game is also confusing because it doesn't tell you where to go and has you walk back and forth through a bland stage to try and guess what level to enter. The way you have to enter a level is also very finiky and you will sometimes think that you can't enter a level even if it's the level your supposed to enter.  Overall I'd say that the game is without a doubt the best game LJN ever produced, but with a little more polish could have been an NES classic and one of the best liscensed games for the system. I'd give it a 7/10."

Definitely a copyright violation in almost all cases (possible exception: some people send in a legit cart in Japanese, and have the ROMs replaced with translated ones).  But the companies that own the rights clearly don't consider it worth pursuing, considering there are multiple vendors doing it openly and none of them appear to face any legal pressure.  The generally high costs and low profit margins are probably the reason.    I'd suggest no one is really being hurt in terms of their bottom line by the practice, but if you consider people using intellectual property against the probable intentions of the owner to be a moral wrong, then yeah, that's pretty much what it is in most cases."

nes,2zuk4v,NT_Redmage,1 point,Sat Mar 21 22:29:49 2015 UTC,"Legend of Zelda 2:Adventure of Link review  Or as I like to call it, discount Fuaxandu (oddly enough they both came out the same year).  So Let's get the giant maruading elephant in the room out of the way; notI don't hate this game and no it doesn't deserve as much hate as it gets. If you are reading this hoping for me to demolish the game and call it the worst POS since Silver Surfer then you are better off reading someone elses review.  I promise to not to sugar coat my critisism however, the game does have problems(all games do).  From nearly every other standpoint the game is actually ahead of it's competition of that time period. The dungeons are reasonably complex, the main character pops out and it's easy to distinguish enemies from backround and foreground objects. The sound quality is pretty good, though I don't remember them ever re-using most of the music made for this game. The combat is reasonably tactical and you get a bunch of spells to help with certain enemies.  The problems however, detract somehwat from the overall experience.  Firstly, the minor problems. Enemy encounters are far too frequent, especially in the overworld when traveling from town to town. I understand the need for there to be threats, but there should be a quicker way to not deal with them. In the original Zelda you had situations where fighting all the things on the way to the next dungeon was not the best idea, not unless you wanted to be drained of hearts by the time you got there.  In Zelda 2, you kind of don't have that option. If an enemy runs into you, you're stuck fighting them. This I believe was there to support the out of place and boring grind system. The game uses a point system to give out bonuses to damage, health and lowers the cost of magic spells. The problem with this is not only does it take away from the exploration element(you could hide these upgrades in caves randomly), but also makes the game feel grindy as all hell. The other problem is you also desperately need these upgrades whgich leads into my next problem; difficulty.  Random encounters are not all that difficult, there are a few that can be annoying, but most of them are a cakewalk for anyone experienced in any sidescrolling game. However, they do drain you fairly quickly, especially if the dungeon you're headed to doesn't have a town close enough to counter this. The real problem is the dungeons are littered with enemies that hit like trucks early game.  Both Darknuts and those flame flinging things all hit exceptionally hard early game and many rooms are setup in no win situations; a common trope of the time, but annoying. This wouldn't be too much orf a problem, except that the last part amplifies this; no map system.  Imagine if you were playing a link to the past, but htere was no overworld map OR any kind of dungeon map. In that games context, it wouldn't be the end of the world as the dungeons in those games have some landmarks to work with. In Adventure of Link, you may as well be playing on planet Namek because all the dungeons rooms look the kami-damned same (At least the halls leading to them anyway). Getting lost means you have to re-fight some enemies throughout the dungeon. Thankfully Darknuts, stalfos and the harder enemies do not respawn, but it's aggrivating to lose your positioning.  Now what if you have to stop mid-way through a dungeon to go eat, or pick up a kid. well, sucks to be you, you now have no idea where you ahve already been and guess what? All the harder enemies are back, have fun with that.  Theres also the time honored tradition of mistranslated tips from the random villagers you encounter, but this is only a minor problem as the game is mostly set up in a linear fashion in terms of what dungeon is next.  All of these problems are fairly easy fixes, so much so that hacks of the nes rom can have the grinding removed, caves added to give out boosts and even a map system added in. All of which make the game so much more fun to play.  However, those problems aside, it's still one of the better games on the nes. The sense of adventure is still there, though blackened by the mark of grindy bullshit and a lack of a map."
nes,2zuk4v,vandilx,2,Sat Mar 21 22:30:09 2015 UTC,"Are you reviewing this from the modern save-points/maps/OCD era context? or are you reviewing this from the context of the era that is was released?  When Zelda II came out, its challenge and difficulty were a staple of the era.  Games with RPG elements had either an XP or cash (or both) grind.  You had to make your own maps or memorize the layouts. (I'm 37.  I've played Zelda II when it was released and continue to give it a playthrough every couple of years and I still have those palaces, caves, and tunnels all memorized.)  The joy was discovering things after risking the difficulties of backtracking.  You'd eventually figure out how to defeat Iron Knuckles with ease with a crouched jump attack.  You'd figure out how to bypass hard-coded enemy encounter tiles by having a random spawn attack you as you walked on the tile.  You'd figure out that you can kill the bubbles with about 84 stabs in the first palace and gain 50XP for doing so and ""grind"" for about 30 minutes, earning enough XP to get your attack to level 4, your magic to level 4, and your life to level 5.  Level your attack first to reduce the number of stabs to eventually around 40-ish per bubble.  This makes Horsehead a breeze and the rest of the palaces/caves on the first continent and death mountain simple. (The second XP spot is the 5th palace falling brick area with the firey moas.  Simply let a 4-brick high wall form (or cut it out of the completed wall) and walk until the moa flies over.  Crouch and kill him and he should respawn at that 4-brick high level, ready to be crouch-killed again and again while you just hold down and stab (add Fire to your sword just in case) and get yourself to levels 8-8-8.  Additionally, you'll get lots of 200 point bags and red magic jars while doing this.)  At 8-8-8, you'll dispatch Gooma and the rest of the game's content fairly easy.  You also learn about the every-6th-kill-yields-a-point-bag-or-magic-jar rule.  Good to know in dungeons once you know the Life spell.  Kill bots or whatever until you get enough magic to do what you need.  Likewise to fill up before the boss.  You'll also learn which statues can be stabbed (inside palaces and select palace entries) to yield a red magic jar.  Some are hidden in invisible walls (especially the Great Palace).  A lot of this is trial and error, but that's how games were back then. There was no tutorial level or map or explicit villager clues.  You had to experiment knowing you were going to have to do basic risk management with random encounters, backtracking, and dying until you memorized stuff.  You had to commit for a long play session.  There was no pick-up-and-play intended.  Figuring it all out was the zen moment."

nes,2zinnp,BL4CKV4LOR,1 point,Thu Mar 19 17:35:11 2015 UTC,"Clean all of your games with Qtips and windex or rubbing alcohol until the Qtips come out completely clean. Don't use Brasso. Use the dry end of the Qtips to dry the Windex or alcohol off the pins. Don't leave them wet.  Then, boil your original NES 72 pin connector.  Finally, disable the lockout chip."
nes,2zh4s1,F1shard,2,Wed Mar 18 15:28:31 2015 UTC,I remember the first time playing the bridge level. The music was so motivating I felt like I could kill anything in my path. Then I met Mr Eagle on the bridge...

When you die, you go back to the beginning of the game and have to traverse all the way back to where you died. There are 6 bosses. That's a lot of walking."
nes,2zdqko,Itellsadstories,2,Tue Mar 17 19:11:15 2015 UTC,"It took me a long, long time to beat it. I was just watching a video of all the different bosses since it's been a long time since I played it. The third and fourth bosses were the ones I had the hardest times with. Rewatching them, holy crap that last boss is easy. I think getting there was harder than the boss. I wish I had youtube as a kid to help with these."

It's wonderful. the two bosses before that are annoying because of their shields. Especially the boss with the shield and sword. That boss fight takes absolutely forever. Missiles were my friend during that battle."

nes,2z8aog,jdllama,3,Mon Mar 16 13:33:48 2015 UTC,"Context: This was from the Classic Tetris European Championship. The PAL version of the game is considered much shorter, because the speed of the blocks is MUCH faster than NTSC. As such, Level 19 is considered the Kill Screen, or the screen that is impossible to clear (The NTSC version has Level 29 as the Kill Screen, which is almost impossible to clear).  The fact that this player, Jani, was able to clear the PAL kill screen, and then clear the screen after it, live on stage / Twitch stream AND it was part of the Finals, is absolutely amazing."

But for the best picture make sure you connect using the composite jack directly (yellow RCA connection). Using the RF-adapter to the antenna connection will worsen the picture.

It's not the NES's graphics that are messed up, it's that the TV you're using has trouble displaying a 4:3 240P picture.  As many others have mentioned hitting thrift stores (some no longer take them in) or craigslist for a cheap CRT is probably your best bet."

nes,2z0z9t,Picassolsus,1 point,Sat Mar 14 22:01:42 2015 UTC,"As many have said, it looks normal to me. Normal composite looking output creates a lot of noise and artifacts like that. I'd look into either getting an upscaler, or some kind of RGB/HDTV mod for your NES. Remember, these old systems weren't exactly designed for newer TVs.  Also definitely wanna change the TV to a different aspect ratio. NES games don't look good in widescreen."

You don't just hit a direction on the d-pad once, you hold it for a specific amount of time while holding run and jump buttons.  Even if it was that simple, this image isn't going to help you, it's not like you can reference this in real time while you're trying to play the game.

There are dozens of online shops and collectors/resellers for each country, especially as there are several EU PAL region codes for different countries. Different country ebay pages like ebay.co.uk, ebay.de and ebay.fr will carry their own resellers and stock of ntsc.  Most will probably have a limited selection of NTSC games, but to really get what you want, I'm thinking US ebay is the best. Or collector forums in each country. However, games, both PAL and NTSC are way more expensive here than in the states or Canada."

nes,2ys668,aerobert,1 point,Fri Mar 13 08:40:15 2015 UTC,"Not good unfortunately. As you say...shipping is expensive and you are at risk of getting high custom taxes. I don't know how it works in Germany but here in Sweden they add the extra custom cost to your package if it does get caught, but you will still have it delivered to you adress as usual.  I'd try european collector forums. Sndb.se is the biggest for Sweden/Scandinavia which has a huge market, I know that many carry NTSC games if one only asks. It's not that popular with NTSC...yet. But it's slowly starting as well due to prices being lower.  As far as germany goes, I only have tried http://www.nintendofans.de/ You'll get far with english in both forums.

This basically meant the outer 5% of the image, on every side, was being shot ""outside"" the viewable area.  Many video game designers took advantage of this to have less space to have to fill with sprites, etc. This is one case.  As TVs got nicer, and were made more precisely, they started being able to show the ""full"" image, overscan and all.

Maybe find someone you can trust to temporarily lend the cartridge to, or someone in your local area that could dump it for you in-person. NESDev or NintendoAge are both good places to look.

That's just rough enough to clean the pins without filing away the metal, as long as you don't get too aggro.  Use a can of compressed air to blow it out afterwards, then follow that up with some rubbing alcohol on a folded piece of paper.  Lastly I brush some DeOxit on the pins and then use another folded up piece of paper to remove all of the excess by inserting and removing it over and over.  I've never tried the boiling technique but I can definitely see why it would work.  You've got gunk on the pins, and hot water is a great solvent."

Saying the above would be the easy way out though and I'll be damned if people start calling me lazy.  If I could quantify everything this game represents in just a few words it would be ""90's Marketing gone wrong"". I can understand companies making contests, nintendo did it frequently in the late 80s and early 90s, but Treasure? I never even heard of a game they made and judging from this game I can reason why.  The game is a directionless, confusing, poorly tossed together trainwreck of a game. Imagine if a company sold you a crappier version of Mckids for 60$, then asked you to call a 1-900 number (another 5$ easily) to register and give them your address so they can send you a date when a special code would be given.  The code in question was show a couple times very briefly on MTV and if you didn't have cable, well, you got fucked son. Welcome to how the economy works. THEN you have to hope you have  properly working VCR (it's a ancient recording device for you kiddies), a tape to record with and have the sense not to put the recording on standard play.  Now you have to speed run the game AND a level you have never even seen and send in your best run post dated within a 1 day  of the code being sent out.  Yeah, it's one of THOSE kinds of deals. It's kind of like those silly quizzes you would occasionally see in EGM or Gamepro with 30 questions that require a 10$ entry fee each time and you ahve to complete 5 of them to MAYBE get a 2000$ entertainment center (which I never heard of anyone ever winning one of those. Maybe someone can link me an AMA of someone that did.)  This may be a lesser exampe, but it should infuriate anyone. They are selling you a bad game to sell you a bad contest so they can make even more money off entry fees and the 1-900 number.  Wait...I just realized something. That sounds oddly like games set up to sell DLC. Huh, look at that, someone sold DLC in the form of a contest before the internet even existed (BTW this is satire, I know its different, it's intentional hyperbole kids.).  Anyway, avoid.

I've done it to 4 or 5 NESs at some point or another.  edit: you also probably need a new 72 pin connector, which are cheap and trivial to install as well!"
nes,2xsbgp,240ZT,3,Tue Mar 3 14:15:52 2015 UTC,This guy is getting downvoted but I had a NES giving me flashing problems even with a new 72 pin connector. I disabled the 10NES chip and it hasn't had a problem since.
nes,2xsbgp,crashdummie,1 point,Tue Mar 3 17:49:33 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure they did that even when they were brand new. Welcome to Nintendo Land.
nes,2xubv5,Itzwessyg,2,Tue Mar 3 23:03:34 2015 UTC,"Generally I'd suggest EBay, Craigslist, local pawn shops, local game/comic book shops, etc.  I'm not a huge collector though, so somebody else probably has even better places that I've never heard of."
nes,2xubv5,slysendice,1 point,Tue Mar 3 23:34:37 2015 UTC,"In my experience, Ebay is going to be a lot like amazon (top price). You may get lucky, but I have my doubts. Best bet is local shops / flea markets."

nes,2xubv5,slysendice,2,Wed Mar 4 01:06:21 2015 UTC,"Finding ""good"" prices on high demand/low supply NES games is very difficult these days.  If your budget is limited, I would suggest finding some less expensive, quality, common games to play.  The great thing about the NES is that there is a HUGE library of games under $10 that are very enjoyable.  Just yesterday I saw a copy of Blades of Steel for $1 and Blaster Master for $2.  Good Luck."
nes,2xubv5,Schlitz001,1 point,Wed Mar 4 02:29:00 2015 UTC,2 bucks for blaster master?  That's an amazing price for such an awesome game.

nes,2xubv5,budamunk,1 point,Thu Mar 5 01:37:25 2015 UTC,rely the best place is ebay. you find what you are looking for. for high end games that you will never afford just buy an everdrive if you can find one. download the roms and play on your console. I think all nes roms would fit on a 1gb sd card.

nes,2xs8v3,Mr_Patatoo,2,Tue Mar 3 13:32:16 2015 UTC,"Carts can have the chips on them rot out over time. Pins on the connectors so corroded they never work properly the same way again among many other problems.  On LICENSED NES cartridges it's extremely uncommon to see a cart be completely dead unless it's a cartridge with a battery for saving and the battery has exploded causing corrosion on the chips inside or severe neglect (in working at Funcoland years ago we had defective cartridge where the entire PCB was sticky like soda or juice was poured on it).  On unlicensed carts, the build quality does appear to be a bit worse. I've seen way more flat out dead Camerica carts than I have licensed NES carts that do not meet the criteria listed above."
nes,2xs8v3,icantrecallaccnt,1 point,Tue Mar 3 14:38:36 2015 UTC,"Hmm, interesting. It could've been just dirt or dust inside the console (he hadn't cleaned it yet) but the game did start on the first time. On a side note, can a dead battery (not damaged, just dead) cause graphic glitches? I'm pretty sure the battery on my StarTropics is dead, and there is always an horizontal line (kinda like an interference) everytime I talk to someone. The rest is good, though."
nes,2xs8v3,icantrecallaccnt,2,Tue Mar 3 18:21:42 2015 UTC,"It's possible if the battery popped that the contents leaked on to a pin or elsewhere on the catridge and could be causing the problem as well. I've seen a few NES carts where batteries started leaking ruining the PCB inside, more often than not the batteries just run out of power over time and your cart simply no longer saves."
nes,2xs8v3,BloodBride,1 point,Tue Mar 3 18:35:07 2015 UTC,"Nope, it looks just fine. I'll replace the battery eventually so I can save games again and see if that solves the problem. By the way, StarTropics has one of the coolest soundtracks I've ever heard in a NES game. Well, not exactly super cool, but quite catchy haha."
nes,2xs8v3,BloodBride,2,Tue Mar 3 18:50:24 2015 UTC,"could've been nothing more than dirt on the cart or grubby connectors in the console itself. You'd need to dismantle and clean the 72-pin connector and all of the carts and then re-test it. Opening the cart up could also show if there's anything defective like capacitors that've caused physical damage to the board. With games this primitive, it's really obvious to tell."
nes,2xs8v3,BloodBride,1 point,Tue Mar 3 14:47:50 2015 UTC,"I don't know if it was a faulty component, as the game did actually play ok except for those bits. Should've tried cleaning the game contacs and the 72 pin connector. I would do it now, but he traded some of his games for a Legend of Zelda, this one included."
nes,2xs8v3,icantrecallaccnt,2,Tue Mar 3 18:24:25 2015 UTC,"I actually had the same title artefacting you mention on a copy of Zelda II, funnily enough - legit cart, the battery is fine - it was just dirty. You'll be surprised what sort of glitches can happen - colours can invert, change palette entirely, or the wrong chips can display (which is what you were describing.)"
nes,2xs8v3,BloodBride,1 point,Tue Mar 3 18:43:40 2015 UTC,"Just texted him and he no longer has the game, but the contacs and/or the connector being dirty makes sense. He told me that he cleaned the NES shortly after that, so we can't determine whether it was the console or the cart's fault."
nes,2xs8v3,Grantagonist,1 point,Tue Mar 3 18:48:03 2015 UTC,"For future reference, if you get yourself an NES or another cartridge based system, get yourself some isopropyl alcohol. 70%-90%. Apply with a q-tip. That gets dirt off, doesn't corrode anything, dries quickly and doesn't leave residue. For retro collecting, it's your best pal and your automatic first point of call for maintenance.      My NES is on the 'try boiling the connector in distilled water' point of its life - after that, it's disabling the region chip, followed by a new connector."
nes,2xs9iy,MairusuPawa,3,Tue Mar 3 13:39:41 2015 UTC,I would just leave it or try to find someone selling just the cartridges slot door on eBay for cheap and just replace that part.

Also, Rare put out quality games, like Battletoads, however, also like Battletoads, they didn't feel as refined as Capcom or Konami/Ultra games. Some pretty big glitches.  That said, it's going to cost a pretty penny just to get a complete Capcom set."

Dragon Warrior/Quest has always been my favorite game series, and it started with these cartridges. It's the 4 Dragon Warrior games, if the picture isn't clear.  He held onto his NES and games since he got it originally in Christmas 1990 until this summer when he decided to sell it off and part ways. He held on to these 4 to pass along to me though,  and suprised me with the awesome display to go along with it!"

I imagine it was while the PS1 was out I think.   The first game is basically a dime a dozen, I think that came prepackaged with the Nintendo in many cases, and 3 & 4 were bought sometime in the early 90's by my brother.

nes,2xixe7,truename_b4,2,Mon Mar 2 14:20:16 2015 UTC,Good job man. One of the most difficult games on the NES with that fucking last level and bosses. Took me nearly 20 years of my life to beat that shit.
nes,2xixe7,truename_b4,2,Sun Mar 1 09:34:27 2015 UTC,"Good stuff!  I've been obsessed with this game and recently managed to 1CC it (win without continues).  I am just an average gamer in terms of basic reflexes, etc., but attained this through patience, memorization, and a love of the game.  Based on the video, you have the fundamentals of combat down well enough to aim for this if you want it.   If so, my advice is as follows (general advice, no real spoilers):    (1) get to Act VI.  The rest of the game doesn't really matter at this point since you have continues;  you can practice it later once your skill has been honed in the fearsome gauntlet of Act VI.  (2) Practice the living hell out of Act VI, with an emphasis on memorizing each section (drawings might help) and, especially, developing a consistent strategy for the tough spots.  (The flying ninjas are the only part where I still find myself having to improvise sometimes.)    One thing about the game that makes this process easier is that, thanks to the respawning enemies, you can often backtrack to try the same hard passage over again.  The other general pointer here is that enemies in this game spawn at precise trigger-points, and anticipating these points gives a huge advantage.  For example, that machine-gunner at the beginning of 4-1 is much easier if you can anticipate his apperance.  Inching along slowly also allows you to control the appearance of enemies so you can take them down one at a time (although often an expert may be able to run fast thru multiple enemies).  (3)  To 1CC the game, you will almost certainly need to be able to defeat at least one of Jaquio or the Demon without powerups.  If you're an average gamer like myself, this will take a good amount of practice.  To obtain this practice (without save-state abuse), you'll have to become a fair ace at 6-1 thru 6-3.    (4)  Once you've managed to master Act VI and its bosses, you should be able to fill in the details of the rest of a 1CC run without any further help!  You'll find that, while it's stingy on extra lives, the game is reasonably generous about health refills (full health with every cutscene) and it is enough to see a skilled player through."

But don't get it for your X-box unless you have a 3rd party controller with a decent d-pad.  The X-box controllers made those games a lot less fun.  I have them now on my Wii U and they're good again.

nes,2xfbzk,yodayolo,3,Fri Mar 6 16:27:16 2015 UTC,"2 is often regarded as the best, and is probably the easiest to start with.  It implemented many of the trademarks of the series, like Rush accessories (in function, if not name), E-Tanks, and the teleporter boss rush at the end.  The first one is more difficult and not quite as well-balanced and polished, but still fun.  3-6 are fairly straight iterations, adding features like the slide, charge shot, and currency systems.  4-6 are probably the weakest ones, due to some less excellent level design and bosses/weapons, but they're still worth playing.  9 and 10 revert back to MM3-era gameplay, but are harder than any of the classics.  They're great for diehard fans, but not where I'd start.  Don't forget about 7.  While the graphics received a 16-bit upgrade, it still plays just like the classic series.  The Game Boy versions tend to feel like remixes of the NES games, taking direct inspiration from them but still being original."
nes,2xfbzk,ThetaReactor,2,Sat Feb 28 10:12:36 2015 UTC,"On the NES, 2 is the one I like best.  If you include 9 and 10, I think 9 is my favourite."

ProTip for MM2:  Metal Blades give you three shots before the fourth shot consumes 1 unit of weapon energy. Before firing a 4h shot, simply call up the subweapon screen and dismiss it and you've reset the counter to zero. Infinite metal blades!  This also works for the Bubble Lead, which uses 1 unit of weapon energy on each 2nd shot, so call up the subweapon screen after each shot and you effectively have infinite ammo."

nes,2xdktz,SirCiph,6,Fri Feb 27 18:24:07 2015 UTC,Sounds like the games need a cleaning. You may also need to clean the pins on the 72pin connector. Youtube has how to's I recommend watching them. Its not hard at all. I clean all new games and systems I get from garage sales and resale shops.
nes,2xdktz,teamhex,3,Fri Feb 27 18:38:33 2015 UTC,"Yup, boil the connector and clean all the game contacts with 90%+ alcohol. Use Brasso for really gnarly ones with corrosion. Also you may want to consider disabling the lockout chip if you have one."
nes,2xdktz,wtfamireadingdotjpg,2,Fri Feb 27 20:17:59 2015 UTC,"I also suggest getting a gamebit screwdirver. Not only for cleaning, but you might be lucky and have a famicom adapter sitting in a game (they're definitely pretty cool).  Also, along with cleaning the 72-pin (maybe boiling it, depending), you may also want to disable that lockout chip. It's pretty easy."
nes,2xdktz,StillAnOutlawStar,2,Fri Feb 27 19:47:52 2015 UTC,"I would definitely suggest taking the time to clean the entire thing. If you know what you're doing enough, take the console apart and make sure it's all clean. And take the time to clean the contacts on the carts too. If it's been sitting in storage for a while, it probably needs it.  I'd also suggest, if you can get the right screwdriver to do it, to open up your Gyromite cart and see if there's a Famicom converter in there. Those are nice to have, because then you can use it to import and play Famicom games on your NES.  I could also suggest getting an Everdrive N8. Always a purchase I think is worth it. Even if you plan on having a large collection of games, an Everdrive is still nice to have. Aside from the obvious, being able to have almost the entire library of NES games on one cartridge, you can also play all those weird bootleg games, homebrew,  rom hacks, fan translations, rare and stupidly expensive games, japan-exclusive games, and disk system games, all on real hardware just by downloading them and adding them to an SD Card.  Personally, I'd love to get an NES again. It's been a while since i had one. I had to sell my old one since I needed money. One of these days when I get enough money, I'm gonna get an old front-loading NES, a few controllers, and an Everdrive. Might even get myself an old CRT so I can play zapper games."
nes,2xdktz,TXFDA,1 point,Fri Feb 27 19:51:12 2015 UTC,"Congratulations! Fisrt, you need to clean at least the 72-pin connector. It's quite easy, and you don't need special tools to disassemble your NES and give it a good cleaning. I'd clean the controllers too, but that's just because I love in-depth cleaning. Second, I'd suggest getting a GameBit screwdriver to take the games appart (it's just 3 screws) and give the contacts a good cleaning and polishing. You don't want to use anything too harsh. I always get rid of the grime with q-tips and rubbing alcohol and then use an eraser to make the contacs shine as new. Rub again with the alcohol and a dry cloth to remove any eraser residue and you're good to go! Enjoy!    PS: Try using the original AC adapter as well, as I've found out that using universal ones cause a loud background hum in the audio."
nes,2xdktz,Mr_Patatoo,1 point,Fri Feb 27 19:36:30 2015 UTC,"this tip is probably not recommended by anyone who knows how Ninetendos actually work but when I was kid (and I was a kid during the NES heyday), we would stick the games in the freezer for about 5 minutes before trying to play them.  I don't know why that worked, but it did.  Every time.  Also, when you get to Tyson in PunchOut!, be sure to hit up after dodging left or right during the first 1:30 of round one. This will bring you back to center immediately allowing you to dodge again (watch for his blinking eyes)."

nes,2xbwf9,hamz0r,7,Fri Feb 27 07:15:08 2015 UTC,It's just slowdown. Too much to handle for the good ol' NES. The PAL versions suffer slightly more from this than the NTSC versions.
nes,2xbwf9,aerobert,7,Fri Feb 27 07:22:10 2015 UTC,Most games can only handle 8 moving sprites on screen before the game starts lagging.  Slowdown just means crazy intense NES magic is happening.
nes,2xbwf9,Schlitz001,1 point,Fri Feb 27 08:11:06 2015 UTC,8 sprites per scanline
nes,2xbwf9,DRM_Removal_Bot,5,Wed Mar 11 14:08:48 2015 UTC,"Game logic usually runs in vertical blank interrupt.  It works as a timer.  In the NTSC TV standard, the TV draws 60 images a second.  In PAL, 50.  At the end of one image, the CPU gets ""interrupted"" from what it was doing (which is often nothing) and runs a ""vertical blank handler routine"".  Usually this routine includes game logic.  That's an easy way to make game logic run once every 1/60th or 50th of a second.  However, if the game logic takes too long to run (too much going on on the screen... too many things to multiplex, too many collisions, whatever), it'll run too long.  Almost always, people turn off interrupts while in interrupts to keep things from getting really screwed up.  So if it's still processing game logic by the time the next vertical blank interrupt comes around... it simply ignores it.  Then the game starts moving everything at 30 fps instead of 60, or 25 instead of 50.  This will happen in parts of SMB3 too."

But for people that don't want to/can't, pliers are totally fine, just put a small piece of cloth between the pliers and the grip-space on the cartridge when you pull it out (if you don't use cloth your pliers will ALWAYS mar the cartridge even in the slightest).  Pulling it out wont hurt the game or system, I've had that issue a million times and it's never hurt anything, just remember that this is vintage gaming and to be delicate."

I had this game since it was released and the first 6 years was wondering aimlessly (I was like 6 or 7 around there.) And sure it was fun being poochie and walking around not getting hit but there was no structure. Now I find this an amazing and rewarding game.

Licensed   Stadium Events   Unlicensed   Myriad 6-in-1 Cheetahmen II   Competition   NWC Gold NWC Grey   If you count them all you're just 170 away! Personally speaking I wouldn't worry about Stadium Events. NWC's though..."

The Cheetah 2 and Myriad eh not sure if I want to pay the price for them yet. I know a guy who wants to sell me Stadium Events for 6k! He's crazy. I deal with a guy that has 3 copies of the NTSC Stadium Events. Yes I said 3. Not Pal or April Fools versions. Bastard said he won't sell me one.

No one knows what it is, everyone I know is more impressed by my sealed Super Mario Bros. 1, and playing Duck Tales and hearing that there's such a thing as Duck Tales part 2. There's no benefit to owning it.  I'd much rather have saved my money and bought WCTM instead and buy the rest of the 676 licensed NES games because other than the price tag, the title screen, and the Bandai branding there's zero difference between the two.  I know a few guys with multiple copies too, they're investors not collectors, and certainly not gamers :P"
nes,2wz2wt,JosephLeo,2,Tue Feb 24 19:08:37 2015 UTC,Value is of the beholder really you know. There is so much out there for people. People like different stuff. As long as you collect stuff for you and not for other people. That's what I think anyway. Mario 1 is my favorite game btw. Great copy
nes,2wz2wt,minnick85,2,Tue Feb 24 19:34:30 2015 UTC,"I would have agree with you before getting it, but there's just so much poison about this game.  It's taken away all the challenge of collecting, I can use this as trade bait and get just about anything I want now...so no more fun in that aspect.  It's taken away the excitement of opening up a shipment since nothing can top the rarity of this thing other than the NWC's.  It's taken away the fun of going to garage sales since that ""big find"" isn't as exciting anymore.  The community surrounding this game (even myself) is just toxic sludge.  This game has nothing positive to say about itself :P"
nes,2wz2wt,Kimchifries,2,Tue Feb 24 19:38:23 2015 UTC,Then it's definitely time to trade that thing away. Take a pic or vid then just trade it for lots of goodies.

nes,2wz2wt,greenbanana17,2,Tue Feb 24 19:19:29 2015 UTC,Flea Markets in the very beginning were ok. You can find a lot of commons there. They don't haggle anymore where I'm from so they want you to pay over value. Yard sales were not good for me. It's more for game collecting meaning multiple systems. The good ol world wide web is where I had to go. EBay and other sites for commons. Craigslist has been great but most people want to Buy ads are on there. You just have to follow the rabbit hole until you can find yourself real dealers that know your the real deal and not a re-seller.

That's based on resale market value of us selling that bundle to people and not us buying from someone which is even lower unfortunately.

nes,2ws7fp,jumpbug_be,5,Sun Feb 22 18:49:26 2015 UTC,"I remember being only 3 or 4 and my uncle having a couple game consoles, Atari 2600, Sega Master System but the one that always grabbed my attention was the NES. Played Super Mario Bros, Excitebike and RC PRO AM every second I could get my hands on it. A cousin had Kung Fu and some games for the POWER PAD and then it was just too much for me not to have my own, I begged and begged AND BEGGED my parents to buy a NES for what seemed like ages. Luckily enough they did on Christmas morning 1988 along with a few games, I was so ecstatic! Got SMB / Duck Hunt of course but also Pin-Ball and Rad Racer as the first games. This held me over for a while until we went to a movie rental store and I saw this weird game with a shiny gold cartridge... The Legend of Zelda. Your story reminded me of my own, I remember my mom not really liking video games but helping me read words in the game, finding my way through the dungeons and figuring out the map and secrets along the way. She wouldn't admit it but she loved that game as much as I did and I always think about her when I play it now. We rented that game so much that the store let us keep it longer for cheaper and the next year it was my birthday present! Didn't beat that game until a few years later but Zelda is still my favorite NES game ever. I've played both quests to death and can beat it in about 30 minutes. Like you, I think it taught me valuable lessons to keep trying new things until you figure it out. I also attribute some of my problem solving abilities and being able to make mental maps when I travel, to that game."

I was never fond of the pin-ball game, but I did play PinBot, which had a lot of variety and was, to be honest, quite an evil pinball game with all the monsters and alien ships late game. RC Pro-Am was indeed a great game too, quite challenging to get all the upgrades, the NINTENDO letters on the track and winning all the cups."

We didn't get an NES until fall of 1990, when I was in first grade, although my brother and I had been playing it for a couple years at the neighbor's, two houses down.  We of course had the SMB1/Duck Hunt cartridge that came with it, and that TMNT arcade game. I honestly can't remember any other games we owned for the first several months, but we did start renting them at Video Library that next summer. Anyone remember that place?  First, we tried SMB2, which we loved but already figured we'd love based on the series it was a part of. The second game we rented was Ninja Crusaders, which was insanely hard and as I would find out years later, fairly obscure. The third game was Mega Man 2. I even remember my mom suggesting it and us two brothers protesting due to the corny-looking box art. I'm so glad we listened to her. We get home with it, and as I imagine happened with most people on their first time, I picked Crash Man because he looked cool and I thought I was gonna play as him."

I played around with it a bit but the graphics blew me away. After I got home I remember trying to write a little game like Super Mario Bros. in C64 assembler with only the memory of the game in my head. I got some tile scrolling stuff done but nothing as awesome as Super Mario Bros.  Later on my little brother got a NES in 1987 for his birthday and since I had a TV in my room he asked if he could hook it up down there. My folks, though they bought me an Atari 2600 back in 1982, didn't understand video games that much and my little brother couldn't play the console as much as he'd like.  I watched him play Super Mario and played a bit by myself and got hooked. Next we played Super Mario 2 and we played together helping each other out. He had better hand/eye coordination and I had more of a logical mindset to figure puzzles out. It must have been all those CRPGs I played. After Super Mario 2 we played and solved Metroid together. I loved that game.  And after that it was Legend of Zelda. That experience made me fall in love with the Zelda series. We always worked together to solve those game though. Him with his hand/eye coordination and me with my more logical puzzle solving ideas.  After that we played many, many games together. I will always have fond memories of playing those games with my little brother. He was a lot younger than me so we really never bonded until he got that NES.  Great times indeed."

If your DK Jr. Math is a Canadian variant, you'll be the first person in the history of collecting to have ever found a copy. If it's U.S. then it's just another rare copy of DK Math.  Anyway, price on black box games is WIDE, like super wide....   Are they loose, or boxed? If boxed, how is the condition of the box? If boxed, are they complete with manual? If boxed, do they have the white seal of quality, or black? If boxed, do they have a hangtab? If boxed with hangtab, is the hangtab in tact, missing a punch, or ripped off?

Might be worth digging into to try and find an interview with Miyamoto retelling the story or something, but my Google-fu is pretty weak.  I think the console mentioned in the Wiki is actually referring to the basic Console Deck + Player's Guide, but the way that it's worded is kind of confusing, and I'm less positive about all the different console variants.

nes,2wfehf,TXFDA,1 point,Thu Feb 19 18:08:10 2015 UTC,"I still haven't beaten NG1 even today.  2 is definitely easier.    If you're familiar with the plot of 1, you'll enjoy 2.   2 picks up after 1, but you don't have to have finished 1 to understand it.   2 is my favorite in the series."
nes,2wfehf,yojumbo,1 point,Thu Feb 19 18:55:40 2015 UTC,"Agreed 2 is easier to beat. I JUST recently fought my way through the first game and beat it. It may have been my third, MAYBE fourth time beating it since owning it as a kid. It's no picnic!"
nes,2wfehf,Wolvatron,1 point,Thu Feb 19 19:08:14 2015 UTC,"If 2 is easier, I may consider playing it. I'd like to beat at least one of the Ninja Gaiden games in my life. Maybe if I beat 2, I can move back to 1 since I'll be a bit more used to how the game works."
nes,2wfehf,TXFDA,1 point,Fri Feb 20 01:40:24 2015 UTC,"If you're having trouble with the first game, remember the sword hitbox is much larger than in the second one. The first trivializes most bosses with the spin slash, the second form final boss is almost impossible without the down+B attack glitch."
nes,2wfl1s,markgbe,6,Thu Feb 19 14:43:54 2015 UTC,"You can definitely move the horizontal position of the TV using the menu options.    I personally use a CRT TV and absolutely love it.  Just the ability to play games without input lag makes all the difference in the world, plus the picture looks 10 times better than any HDTV I have seen."
nes,2wfl1s,Schlitz001,2,Thu Feb 19 15:05:40 2015 UTC,"Worked great.  I got into the service menu and adjust the H pos, and vs POS, and now it looks perfect.    Loving this."
nes,2wfl1s,CYBRSOLDR,6,Fri Feb 20 17:02:38 2015 UTC,"All my classic systems are hooked up to a CRT. Besides, you cant play light gun games without one. I personally use a Sony Trinitron."
nes,2wfl1s,rainwarrior,2,Thu Feb 19 16:45:36 2015 UTC,"LCD monitors tend to interlace the NES' 240p 60hz output down to 480i 30hz, so the framerate is halved, and you get alternating lines across the image. Not great.  The CRT is much nicer. Smooth 60hz. No delay. Deep, rich colours.  As an alternative, though, you can get an upscaler like the XRGB Framemeister that will upscale 240p to an HD resolution without interlacing."
nes,2wfl1s,crashdummie,2,Thu Feb 19 18:48:30 2015 UTC,"For me, a CRT is a must for retro consoles. They don't have any imput lag and since the consoles' video outputs usually aren't very good, they'll look the best on these TVs.  For more modern games, unless it requires extremely precise timing like Fire Pro Wrestling Returns, I play on HD TVs. I usually don't notice any lag."
nes,2wfl1s,hamz0r,2,Thu Feb 19 21:07:02 2015 UTC,The games just look so much nicer on a CRT. I'm using a Sony trinitron aswell. Plus to me it adds a bit to the nostalgia feeling playing it on a big CRT. It just wouldn't be the same playing it on a flatscreen lcd or hdtv
nes,2wfl1s,icantrecallaccnt,2,Fri Feb 20 16:58:01 2015 UTC,"Geometry on any monitor can be a little difficult. The NES outputs at 240 and most TVs try to display at 480. With that said there MAY be geometry adjustments in your menu.  As far as what I'm using for displays, I have a few Sony PVM monitors and an NEC XM29 I use for most of my retrogaming."

nes,2wfl1s,icantrecallaccnt,1 point,Wed Feb 25 16:11:08 2015 UTC,"I got mine a few different ways.  First one I got was via ebay. Waited for a regular auction within a close enough range to me to come up. Bought it, was about 80.00 shipped. One I found on Craigslist. One I found via a local person who was selling lots of professional video editing gear, I saw ads for other products and asked if he did had any PVMs for sale, and sure enough he did. One other one I got at a Goodwill."
nes,2wfl1s,Egleu,2,Thu Feb 26 01:25:11 2015 UTC,"Personally I'm using a Sony Trinitron 27"". I think that size is a sweet spot because anything larger is far too heavy. Also, unless you RGB mod your NES these old CRT's usually have decent comb filters to help the picture from composite video."

nes,2wgq0c,Grantagonist,1 point,Fri Feb 20 19:25:53 2015 UTC,"The guy who coded and/or ported most of the good emulator for Macs also sells this software to unlock all of the emulators' features. Features that are all free in any other emulators on any other platform mind you.  I got them before openemu even existed, and I didn't mind paying for it to help out the guy, but nowadays, it seems pretty ridiculous considering what the competion is offering."

nes,2wdxu0,TastySnax,2,Thu Feb 19 02:38:28 2015 UTC,"If you're deciding whether to use your NES with a CRT or LCD, I'd recommend a CRT. Easy scanlines, which make sprite-based games look great. If you plan on playing a lot of platformers, I'd also recommend you get a Trinitron CRT. The glass only curves on one axis, so the picture won't appear as distorted as on other TVs. That, or just get a really cool looking retro tube."
nes,2wdxu0,SturgeonMcGuai,3,Thu Feb 19 06:24:35 2015 UTC,I have a Trinitron that's 12 years old and NES/SNES...basically any retro game looks amazing.

The story, music, and gameplay, although simple, are perfect RPG fantasy. I also like how you are a lone warrior as opposed to the sequels where you are always in a party.    The tip from Schlitz001 regarding the MP refill guy is the most important thing to know in the whole game. I never realized this as a kid, and wasted many many many manymanymany extra hours getting off the ground levels fighting the basic slimes and harpees, only to barely afford an herb every so often and it took forever to get the copper gear.    Also the death penalty is really harsh in this game, it takes half your gold. In most games it goes without saying, don't die, but here it really sets you back."
nes,2wcglv,elephant_chew,1 point,Wed Feb 18 23:24:51 2015 UTC,"I figured out the death part. I got myself to level 2, and wondered why my gold was so low. It was because I have died about 20 times. Good thing I bought that pole when I first could!"

nes,2w8u7s,st1tchy,1 point,Wed Feb 18 00:40:06 2015 UTC,"I think they are in the process of making an arcade with a bar, and yess they sell games. Atari through PS4. I got $42 worth of Atari 2600 games the other day for $7.50. I don't blame them for leaving Cincinnati Mills either. That place is sorta creepy. For anyone who has never been there, imagine a 2-story mall in a T shape. There is a Bass Pro Shops (leaving this summer for a different location) a Kohl's and a movie theater at each point of the T and then about 5 others stores scattered throughout the mall. Nothing else is there. Its dark and creepy at night.   GameSwap has whatever people sell them, so it can be hit or miss. The prices seem pretty reasonable on some, and outrageous on others, as with any second-hand video game store, so you need to have a general idea on how much something is worth when looking. The have everything from Atari to PS4. They had a copy of Earthbound for SNES there a month or so ago. I had never seen a copy in person until then. Sold it for $250."

From the pictures I expected it to be a lot bigger than it is. I have been there once, and the kid behind the counter was playing COD and barely looked away long enough to answer if they had Donkey Kong Country 3 there. I don't plan on going back.   And I have never seen security of any sorts there. I see a lot of middle-aged women in groups power-walking though. It seems like a great place for that. Inside, no people to bother you, quiet.

nes,2w8u7s,022688,1 point,Thu Feb 19 16:39:22 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I was disappointed by my trip there, too. Especially considering that I don't drive and took a metro downtown, then walked across the river and eight or nine blocks to the store. The kid working there seemed irritated that I'd even stopped by. I was still gonna spend a bit of money, but when he claimed to not have the key to the cabinet with more expensive games (I was looking to buy Lufia II on SNES) I gave up and left. I won't be making a return trip.  The real shame of that place is how many consoles they have simply piled on the floor under the shelving units that could be in good homes.  I'll probably have Earthbound and Chrono Trigger for a long while considering the trickle of interest I've received for either, so feel free to hit me up anytime if you're interested in trading or buying.

I kept countering every uppercut with a left head punch, the when he started with the hooks I landed every counter.  I still have never been able to do it again, and this was long before we could record games and share.  The only other achievement I consider better was beating Double Dragon in the arcade on one quarter."
nes,2w5m1p,I-Downvoted_You,3,Tue Feb 17 14:53:48 2015 UTC,I don't believe you.    There just isn't enough time to do that much damage in the 1st round unless you were using a game genie.

I can fight Tyson flawlessly in Rd 1, dodge each punch and counter every instance, and it just doesn't do the same amount of damage this video shows.    Even slightly pausing after each first counter isn't hurting him enough to get him down 3 times.    Hey, maybe I'm just not good enough, but I've been playing this consistently since 1987."
nes,2w5m1p,lunarseed,2,Wed Feb 18 04:29:46 2015 UTC,"The strat for TKOing Tyson in round 1 involves many delayed punches of which your timing needs to be incredibly precise throughout the entire round.  Your claim that you accidentally TKOed Tyson in the first round is preposterous.   Either way, beating Tyson is an achievement no matter what round you do it in."
nes,2w5m1p,ob1jabroni,3,Tue Feb 17 21:10:31 2015 UTC,"I never used the word accidentally, at the time I was able to beat Tyson no problem, I just kept on playing the game, sometimes not even using the code to get to Tyson.  I always found Super Macho Man harder.  Like I stated, I have zero way to prove it, I only can state what I know I did at the time.  It is definitely not impossible. I don't even think I owned a Game Genie at the time.  However, you just inspired me.  I think I'm going to dust off the old NES, load up Tyson, and start practicing.  Then I'll see what I can do to record it.  I think it will be fun.  If I did it before, I'll do it again.  Last year I booted the game up for grins and beat Tyson on my second try, so now it is challenge.  Don't hold your breath though, finding time to do stuff is easier said than done.  Does anyone have a suggestion on how I can record from an NES?  I rather do this from the original console to take everything else out of the equation."
nes,2w5m1p,lunarseed,4,Tue Feb 17 21:29:43 2015 UTC,"Yes, not to mention fighting tyson on an emulator is much different due to timing/lag (even if its just a little).  I have an Elgato Game Capture that I use.  You can get any sort of USB video capture device and it should work. You'll also want 2 RCA splitters so you can play on a regular screen and record the video.  I'm in no way saying it's impossible to First Round TKO him, but it requires a LOT of things to happen actively by the player.  You have to dodge the dynamite punches and counterpunch, then dely the second counterpunch.  Then when the straight punches come out you have to dodge them but quickly return to center while tyson's glove is still out and punch him.  This does more damage per second than two counterpunches and you can also score a star uppercut with those one-shots which is extremely helpful in the R1TKO.  If you're going to do it, than so am I.  I have a lot of shit going on too, but I feel like knowing so much about the R1TKO and never actually getting it is a shame.  Maybe I'll try the R3KO as well.  EDIT: Here's a cheap capture card  Here's a more expensive one that's pretty sweet"

Part of this is  for me is probably muscle memory but I can beat Tyson/Mr. Dream 90% of the time I fight him. I actually have a little more trouble with Super Macho Man. With that said that comes from constantly putting in 007-373-5963 to go right to Tyson as a kid, learning how to beat him and it being like a bicycle something you just don't forget."

nes,2w440r,xamphear,2,Tue Feb 17 00:08:37 2015 UTC,"Zero Insertion Force. It's the description for any connector where you simply place the two parts of the connection together and then press down/pull a lever to make the connection firm.   The top loader (and Genesis, SNES, N64, etc) are not ZIF because you have to push down on the cart to get it in there and then really pull on it to make it come out."

Buying one with a new 72 pin is always reassuring, but most NES consoles still work fine to this day.  Amazingly durable.  Keep the system clean by always using clean games. Inserting one dirty game into a clean console could fuck it up for the rest of the day.  Spend $50 shipped for a complete system with Mario/Duck Hunt, or expect to pay a little more for a bundle with games.  The top loader's perk is that it plays like an SNES, less touchy than an NES, but since the front loader works well enough, spending that extra dough isn't worth it for someone just looking to play."
nes,2w440r,ProjectShamrock,1 point,Mon Feb 16 21:30:13 2015 UTC,"Personally, for a front loader I wouldn't pay over $30 for one that was in working order with all the hookups and two controllers.

nes,2w440r,mzupeman,1 point,Tue Feb 17 04:14:32 2015 UTC,"Well you have options. Depending on how much you want to spend and how much you care about quality, the best you could conceivably get would be a top loading NES modded for RGB output. They are pricey as hell though, even more so than the composite mod. The difference is night and day though. Keep in mind, however, you'll need a display that can accept RGB output, as well as an adapter for it."
nes,2w440r,pdelponte,1 point,Tue Feb 17 05:44:20 2015 UTC,"I'd say get a front loader like most people say. Though just boil your connector and wait for this when it comes out: http://www.arcadeworks.net/blw.html Which will make it behave like a top loader and has a lockout chip on it itself so you don't have to worry about disabling it or anything. Also for controllers I prefer the Hudson Sansui Joycard SSS. Should be able to find some for around $10. Feels nice in my hands, has turbo switches, and an option to have the sound piped to and then through the controller to your headphones if sound is an issue."

If the new label could be passed for an original, then you have the potential that someone 2 owners down the road could get ripped off.

That's not my case, however. See, I'd buy games in perfect condition (NES, SNES, Atari, Gameboy... Whatever), even boxed if I could. What collector doesn't want all their games to be spotless and boxed? I certainly would, for sure. But I'm 21 and have other hobbies like model planes and analog cameras, so I don't have a lot of money to spend on NES games (or other console). I don't have a magnificent retro man cave like some of you. I can count my whole NES games collection with my fingers. Now, I live in Spain and while retro games are rather cheap in the US, that stuff is really expensive here. I mean 25 euros for Super Mario Bros for the NES. As I already said, I've to take advantage of every opportunity I come across. And sadly that includes buying games with damaged label or no label at all. I've mentioned Snow Bros too. I know it's a rare game, and I'd like to own an original one. But for $100 a game, I just can't. So yes, I'm going to buy a pirate NES Snow Bros copy, put the board in a ""donor"" cart and make a custom label. It's the only way I'm going to be able to play it, at least for now. Of course I want to make custom labels for my games, and make them look as close as the original BUT making obvious that they are reproductions (either putting my name on the corner or the Nintendo logo, I don't know). I just want to play retro games and enjoy the hobby as much as you, so I can't see where the problem is as long as I don't try to pass them off as original and sell them."

And I know if I have a game with a screwed up label, I would rather just replace it myself if I'm able to. Instead of buying an entirely new copy of the game.  Again, if it's for his own personal collection, who cares? If he sells his collection one day....who cares? There would be obvious signs that it's not a real game, so even if someone does get it and sell it for too much, someone would find out eventually anyway. Again, if it's part of his own personal collection, who are you or anyone else to say what he can and can't do with it?"

From Dangevin, ""...with the toploader it will stretch the pins apart so when you play a naked cart later on, it's like... throwing a hot dog down a hallway.""  Bunnyboy has this to say, ""The problem with the Game Genie is the circuit board is extra thick, so it will make contact in the up position of a front loader. The thick board pushes the pins out more than usual, eventually making them so loose that only the thick Game Genie will work and not anything else. If you have no problem replacing that connector then don't worry, otherwise use it sparingly and don't leave it plugged in.

If so, those usually have better images, but it's not that good. No where near what an emulator looks like on your monitor.  Make sure your TV is set to game mode, turn down sharpness. Turn off anything that says ""auto"" or ""enhanced"". For two separate reasons:   you want to minimize lag so that you can actually play games that require precise timing the older CRT TVs had a tendency to fuzz the signals, color, image, etc and that sort of smoothed things out and made them look a bit better"

nes,2vd408,crashdummie,3,Tue Feb 10 05:49:48 2015 UTC,"This is almost my exact strategy. I rarely go for the pitchfork, and I find it easier to fight Jason inside, but the rest is pretty spot on.  Turbo Tips   Get knives, potions and keys for every counselor on your first day. As soon as one of them has the items, put him in a cabin and switch. Then, work on killing 60 zombies with every counselors to get a machete. When one of them has a machete, go kill Jason's mom to get the axe. On day 2, go kill Pamella Voorhees again to get the sweater, and try to use the counselor wearing it to walk around the camp, as it reduces the damage Jason does to you during his surprise attacks. On day 3, maybe get the pitchfork from Pam if you're feeling brave (Use the counselor wearing the sweater, she's brutal on the 3rd day), but mostly just wait for the Jason alarm, go to the cabin and fuck him up. He's not so bad once you've figured out his pattern."

nes,2vcyfo,zFoxx,3,Tue Feb 10 11:21:31 2015 UTC,"Don't use windex it can do more damage than good. The ammonia in it will clean it, but there are a lot more fragrances and ingredients in windex that could damage it. You need 91% rubbing alcohol and q-tips. Brasso is fine as a last resort (over use will do damage but one time is fine) if you gently apply some, and then go over with rubbing alcohol to make sure the white film brasso leaves is cleaned off.

I don't use Brasso because it's abrasive, as you said it will damage it over time.  The best method (imho) is using a white vinyl eraser on the pins, but this requires opening every cartridge. Easy enough with 5 screw and flathead carts, but it's a hassle with other carts unless you have the bit to open them. I've used the vinyl eraser to resurrect games I've had for years that NEVER worked despite using Windex, alcohol and Brasso."

nes,2vam9r,Zombiii,3,Mon Feb 9 12:43:31 2015 UTC,It may be worth picking up a new 72 pin connector and installing it.  This is really easy and will be a step before you start taking all of your carts apart.
nes,2vam9r,MrBeausephus,2,Mon Feb 9 13:57:18 2015 UTC,I read about those and was about to order one but then read that refurbishing an original one is actually better than buying a new 3rd party one.   The thought is an original one is better built and has higher tolerances. The pins can be bent back into shape pretty easily and in the end it it works better.   I can't comment either way because I only fixed my original one.
nes,2vam9r,MrBeausephus,1 point,Mon Feb 9 14:04:43 2015 UTC,"Well, the new 72 pins can be spotty, but for only a few bucks it may save you quite a bit of time.  I know it's the root of many common problems with the NES."
nes,2vam9r,Schlitz001,2,Mon Feb 9 14:43:45 2015 UTC,Listen to this guy. If you can only get 7 of 30 games working it's probably a good Idea to focus on the system. The lookout chip won't solve a problem of the game not contacting the 72 pin connector.
nes,2vam9r,icantrecallaccnt,2,Mon Feb 9 17:19:47 2015 UTC,It turns out it was the games.  I cleaned them again and used sandpaper to clean the pins on the games themselves.  Got all of the games working.  Work first try each one of them now!

nes,2vam9r,mediaG33K,1 point,Mon Feb 9 13:14:50 2015 UTC,Thanks.  I have cleaned the connector really well with alcohol.  Bent the pins upwards.  Even lightly sanded the pins.    Maybe I'll try boiling the connector and cleaning the games again.    Was just wondering if when the game starts up and the chip is trying to communicate to the cart but doesn't quite get a good connection would disabling it have better results.

nes,2vam9r,zFoxx,1 point,Mon Feb 9 13:35:05 2015 UTC,I used alcohol and q-tips. I didn't take them apart though. They are in pretty good condition. Were all in plastic black sleeves.   I rubbed the q-tip pretty hard on the game until there wasn't any black residue on the q-tip.
nes,2vam9r,dahnjohnson,2,Mon Feb 9 13:45:49 2015 UTC,"Try a tiny amount of Brasso brass cleaner on a q-tip. Alcohol will take care of most surface dirt, but it won't take off the worst of the tarnish, which is what prevents things from working on the NES most of the time. Keep cleaning with a fresh q-tip until the black gunk tapers off then hit it with 91% isopropyl."
nes,2vam9r,icantrecallaccnt,2,Mon Feb 9 14:19:17 2015 UTC,"Yep Brasso does wonders as a last resort. Zelda II was flashing the white screen. Used q tips and 91% alcohol, then applied brasso, then went over it again with alcohol. Haven't had a game I couldn't get working."

Kid Icarus -- or maybe this is a well-known good game now? King's Quest V Rygar -- so many fond memories, but plot makes 0 sense Goonies II"

nes,2uytwz,battraman,1 point,Fri Feb 6 15:04:53 2015 UTC,I had this game as a kid and even though I found it pretty tough I couldn't stop playing it. Looking back I think it hit that sweet spot where a game is just difficult enough to be challenging but not overly frustrating. I haven't played it in years so it's hard to say it I would still enjoy it today.

nes,2uytwz,battraman,2,Sat Feb 7 15:57:37 2015 UTC,"DuckTales 2 is also a fun game that no one EVER mentions.   It's obscure merely because it was released near the end of the NES's lifetime, after most folks had moved on to the Genesis or SNES.  Quite simply, very few people played it back in the day, and that's why it's not well-remembered now.  Since the NES was near end-of-life, DuckTales 2 was produced and sold in low numbers.  That's why it goes for more than $100 loose.  (Same story for Chip 'n Dale's Rescue Rangers 2 also.)"
nes,2uytwz,Grantagonist,2,Fri Feb 6 15:12:52 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I figured it was something like that. I didn't check when it was released, but I know there's a few decent games that go unnoticed because it was released late. But still, it's definitely a game worth mentioning and having more people try."
nes,2uytwz,Christ-Centered,2,Fri Feb 6 21:24:14 2015 UTC,"Destiny of an Emperor is a sweet RPG by Capcom. It takes place in China's Warring States period (think Destiny of an Emperor). Your characters are generals, their ""hit points"" are soldiers, and random encounters are skirmishes with rebel forces, bandits, etc. Instead of magic you employ one of your generals as a strategist who provides the rest of your party with various tactics to use in battle such as fire attacks, water attacks, healing, buffs and debuffs. Boss battles are fought basically every time you reach a new town, comprising of several enemy generals you must attempt to dispatch simultaneously.   There are many generals you can recruit throughout the game, I don't know the exact number but it has to be close to 100 or even more (probably 98% of all the generals you ever encounter). Aside from simply meeting them in town and asking for their services, you can attempt to recruit any enemy general you face in a random encounter by offering them gifts after you defeat them.   It's really a great game, one of my all-time favorites. Growing in power and amassing your army is so satisfying. It's a bit on the expensive side because it didn't sell as much, but if you ask me it's the best RPG the NES has to offer."

It came out that he was starting sell his whole collection because his wife wanted their amazing house back.  Also you'll be happy to know I lost his phone number that very week.

The dungeon walls all looked the same to me and I had kept forgetting where I already tried to blow up walls.   Zelda II I played so often that it became muscle memory. Once you have your down-sword, you can sail through a lot of the levels. You become a whiz at blocking with your shield.   I never understood the Zelda II issues. I think it gets a bad rep undeservingly.   Congrats!"
nes,2uuum5,peterkeats,3,Thu Feb 5 09:54:17 2015 UTC,"I 100% agree. I only beat the first Zelda game about a year ago (and still haven't been able to get through A Link to the Past...), and even with tips from the internet, I still had a hard time with the end-game. Zelda II, on the other hand, I beat repeatedly as both a kid and an adult.   It's possible I'm just biased towards side-scrollers, but I really do feel Zelda II is way easier than the original."
nes,2uuum5,Varis78,3,Thu Feb 5 15:13:08 2015 UTC,"The Downward Thrust technique is one of the most amazing upgrades in retro gaming. It's by far the most useful sword technique next to the basic jump/slash.  Link completely changes his sprite in mid-air while attacking enemies from above, and the BOUNCING?  How cool is it to kill Bubbles using that technique just bouncing on top of them?  I'll tell you:  Kinda cool."
nes,2uuum5,MrSinister55,9,Thu Feb 5 20:14:38 2015 UTC,"When it was first released, it was universally praised. There was no precedent for what a Zelda game was supposed to be at that point. It wasn't like the first game, but we didn't know what formula Zelda games were supposed to follow. It wasn't until later that people decided it didn't fit with the rest of the Zelda universe, and (no offense) critics too young to have experienced it when new would have been alive, or old enough to play. Good on you for keeping an open mind about it!!"
nes,2uuum5,icantrecallaccnt,2,Thu Feb 5 12:08:50 2015 UTC,"Besides Nintendo Power (a company owned propaganda magazine) there wasn't a lot of gaming media in the US at that time. EGM, GamePro and a few other magazines were 6 or more months away. So there weren't a lot of ""game critics"" at least outside of Japan.  I'd say the general reaction to the game was ""Oh, this is different"" but there weren't a lot of sequels on NES at that time. Super Mario Bros 2, Ikari Warriors 2 were about the extent of it. So peoples expectations for sequels weren't quite set yet either."
nes,2uuum5,MrSinister55,1 point,Thu Feb 5 13:41:22 2015 UTC,"It was pretty much just as popular with my friends and I as the original, and we all liked it. Simon's Quest got the same deal Zelda II did, that it was quite popular upon release, but was later looked at with a little less enthusiasm as the series matured. The SNES was a reboot for a lot of series, where Zelda and Castlevania both returned to what would later be called their roots. That wasn't the case then, really. We had the reaction of ""Oh, it's more like the first one"" than ""This is how the game should be""."
nes,2uuum5,icantrecallaccnt,2,Thu Feb 5 14:02:05 2015 UTC,"I liked it as well, for me it was a gateway drug into more traditional Japanese RPGs like Dragon Warrior which arrived shortly thereafter in 1989.  With that said when I first saw pictures of Zelda 3 in 1991 I was pleased it was more like the original."
nes,2uuum5,MrSinister55,1 point,Thu Feb 5 15:29:59 2015 UTC,"I was pleased with Zelda III as well, and it's still my favorite of the series.  The first time I played the original LoZ, I was hooked. My RPG addiction only got worse and worse. I can't remember if it was Dragon Warrior or Final Fantasy that was my first true JRPG. I also had a buddy with a Sega Master System, so I owe a lot to Phantasy Star as well."

Got it for Xmas when it came out, and I was immediatly drawn into this huge world. Forest, swamps, beaches, desert, mountians, graveyards, caves, towns, castles.... For 1988 this had it ALL. Much like DW and FF, but having you able to navigate all the areas in 2d made it much more immersive than those early RPGs.    I can still remember eyeing up that patch of land beyond the boulder blocking my path, and dreaming about what lays beyond. Sometimes it took me weeks before I found out, and it was truly exciting.  Same with getting the raft (Haft), and sailing to the new continent, pure excitement. And nothing can compare to the excitement i felt when I found New Kasuto without any help from a magazine or friend.   I know I have rose tinted glasses with this one, but I cannot remember ever feeling so amazed by a game as I did with AoL.  Super metroid came close.  I am glad you got to experience it, its truly a gem."

I kind of thought that section of the map was a bit fishy since the cave that lead to it had some tough enemies, but there was nothing there to reward you.  After about 2 or 3 weeks of getting nowhere, i was just bored and decided to cut down all the trees with the hammer once I figured out you could.  Oh man, the shock when a village popped up was insane for 9 year old me.  I jumped up and down and had to call my Dad downstairs because he had been also stumped for weeks.  Pre-Internet times were a great time to game!"

nes,2uuum5,sundayrefugee,3,Mon Feb 9 19:21:36 2015 UTC,"Well, since you beat it, you should know pretty well.. How long of a game would you say it is? I mean, it's NES, it's not going to be some 40 hour long open ended RPG, but I'm just curious mainly.  Then again, I probably won't even try beating Zelda 2, until I beat the first Zelda.

nes,2uuum5,Varis78,2,Thu Feb 5 09:42:55 2015 UTC,"It depends how good you are at video games.  As a seven year old I'd estimate this game took me 50-60 hours to beat.  As an adult 10 years ago, maybe 7 or 8 hours. Simply put I got a lot better at combat, jumping, general coordination and ultimately had the benefit of going to the internet if I had any questions about where I was supposed to go next. Something that wasn't available to me at the time when the game was new."
nes,2uuum5,quezlar,1 point,Thu Feb 5 13:46:41 2015 UTC,"It's pretty close, at least. The first time I ever played it I'll bet I put in every bit of 40 hours into it. But I'm also kind of a completionist and its a game that rewards exploration. Knowing the game like I'm a bot running a script as I do now, I'm guessing 16-20 hours in a no-stone-unturned run."
nes,2uuum5,Varis78,1 point,Thu Feb 5 11:58:34 2015 UTC,"I guess it took me around a dozen days of sitting down and playing it to get to the end.  It was kind of odd, I never really got lost in the palaces, I always found my way to the boss without much issue.  Sometimes I'd have to backtrack to get the palace item but nothing too annoying.  But watching walkthroughs in the past and playing a bit on emulator really helped me with attacking enemies when I played it on my console.  Developing your strategy to attack enemies is the most important thing to learn in the game."

However, I do feel fairly safe in saying that most of the poor game-design choices in Zelda II are not in BoO (for example, while there is an overhead map of sorts, you don't actually have to navigate it--and get lost doing so). I'm sure the game had its own set of flaws that I'm just failing to remember, but the developers did seem to have learned some things from the mistakes of Zelda II."

nes,2uuum5,punkbenRN,1 point,Fri Feb 6 07:51:42 2015 UTC,"What I really, really loved about the game is the mastery required in combat: you have to know the exact pattern of your enemy, dodge its attack and strike it with pinpoint precision. In order to achieve this you have to die a lot and practice, and once you succeed is one of the most satisfying things in gaming. I really wish this attention to combat in future Zeldas.  However I didn't like the fact that the game is unclear about what to do and where to go, but this is gold compared to the first Zelda."
nes,2uuum5,kazorek,1 point,Thu Feb 5 09:56:22 2015 UTC,"I got it for Christmas in 1988.  While I'll say I didn't like it quite as much as the original Legend of Zelda, I still think it's a fantastic game and was quite a challenge for me as a seven year old, but after quite literally a month or so I eventually completed the game.  Maybe 10 years ago I replayed it via the Game Boy Advance NES classics re-release and found that it held up pretty well all things considered.   I think think the problem with Zelda 2 isn't that the game is bad, it's that it's not what people expected from a sequel to The Legend of Zelda."
nes,2uuum5,quezlar,1 point,Thu Feb 5 10:15:49 2015 UTC,"I played it last year (3DS). It's much easier with the save state feature to pickup and put down.  Very annoying at the start, but after playing a bit, I restarted the game and chose my upgrades better. (More attack!)   I beat it in 89 or 90, and it's still a challenge today... made somewhat easier by the ability to find a good ""grind"" spot to level up.  When I originally played, I don't remember much grinding, but I probably erased that memory in favor of other happier stuff, like taking Zelda II out of the NES and playing Zelda again instead."
nes,2uuum5,TaylorS1986,1 point,Thu Feb 5 13:17:23 2015 UTC,I still need to do this. About 6 years ago I played it right up until the final dungeon and then stopped. I need to bust it back out and beat it.

nes,2uuum5,accaris,1 point,Thu Feb 5 15:10:59 2015 UTC,"I think the second one holds up much better than the first, especially if you like beating games without using any help materials. The first one is basically impossible unless you get out some graph paper and make your own map (which got really tedious).   With a lot of action titles on the NES, combat strategy is pretty shallow; not so in Zelda II! Fighting enemies holds up so well. It takes focus and concentration. Its my second favorite NES game to Metroid."

nes,2uq7f6,Sidetrakkd,3,Wed Feb 4 05:46:16 2015 UTC,"In all, there are 340 games ranging from cart only to factory sealed. Most of them are complete in box. For reference in the pictures (since they always look so small when I upload them), each shelf is 6 feet long, and the shelves reach from floor to ceiling.  The breakdown:  Factory sealed -- 6  Complete in Box -- 272  Boxed -- 33  Cart only -- 29  The six factory sealed games are all boring, common titles. Dance Aerobics, Destination Earthstar, Hoops, Jeopardy Jr., Operation Wolf, Racket Attack  Of the boxed games, most of them are only missing manuals, but a few titles are missing a map or reference card or something. I consider a game Complete In Box if it has the box, manual, cartridge, and any reference material that comes with the game. I don't consider posters/registration cards/promotional materials to be required for CIB, but others do. To each their own.  Of the cart only games, nothing is really noteworthy. Nothing exceptionally rare in that section, mostly just filler that came through trades or lot purchases that I haven't gotten around to completing yet.  Over the last year, since I had already purchased pretty much every game that I wanted to play, I decided to focus on picking up many of the rare games. Flintstones: Surprise at Dinosaur Peak is obviously the highlight of the collection (and I've shared it with /r/nes before), but I've also picked up Chip 'n Dale 2, Panic Restaurant, Little Samson, Donkey Kong Jr. Math, and many other semi-rare titles, like Sqoon and Duck Tales 2. Since the Canadian dollar is so weak right now, I've slowed down on my collection, really only picking up a few cheaper titles here and there. It's slowed down a bit, but still going strong. Hoping to hit 300 CIB titles by the end of the year, but all together I've over halfway through an NTSC licensed collection, which is my ultimate goal.  Most of the collection has been funded online, as I live in a small town in Canada with not much to find locally. I scour eBay every day and have picked up a few ""steals,"" and generally I know what everything is worth and where my personal line lies. I visit three or four online stores every day to see what they get, but only rarely buy from them. Trades with other collectors, pickups from friends, purchases through other collectors, etc. Pretty much any avenue I can find to pick up a new NES game, I'll eventually use it.  That's all. I'm incredibly proud of my collection and enjoy sharing it."

But THESE? DAAAAAMN.  What do you do that allows you to afford such awesomeness, if I may ask?"
nes,2uq7f6,PrinceOfNarnia,2,Wed Feb 4 18:31:17 2015 UTC,"I remember seeing your pics before, you have a very impressive collection. I've been collecting off and on since about 2003 -- I had a fairly large collection (about 250 CIB titles) up until 2007, then had to sell a lot of them for personal reasons. I kept about 30 from there (the Mega Mans, Zeldas, Castlevanias, Marios, and a couple other random titles that I enjoyed), but recently got back into collecting in 2012.  I work as a butcher, which pays... okay. Better than you'd expect, but I'm not rolling in cash. A lot of this was funded with very smart purchasing habits (knowing what they are actually worth and avoiding BINs unless they are good deals, etc), but a large portion of my disposable income goes towards my collection. I don't have many hobbies outside of collecting, so this kind of takes up a lot of my extra money. That coupled with cheap cost of living, almost no debt and very few expenditures per month makes it slightly more affordable, but it's still a very expensive hobby to be in. I kind of wish I didn't collect CIB, because some of the prices are insane. I'm too far gone to stop now, though~!  For some of the really expensive games, while I got them at a good price, they still cost several hundred dollars. I wait until I get bonuses/tax returns/Christmas or birthday money, and set those aside for when I come across an affordable rare game. I lucked out with some, coming across them at steep discounts when the seller was trying to move them, and others I've picked up because the boxes are in less-than-great condition. DKJrMath has a large tear on the back, Little Samson is missing the inner tabs, Flintstones is in pretty good shape but has a lot of small scuffs and whatnot on the box and the manual is starting to come away from the staple. With some of the really rare games that can knock hundreds of dollars off the value. All of those I got for well under FMV, but they're still expensive."

Get a q tip and drench it in rubbing alcohol and clean the contacts on both sides. It's totally harmless and can't hurt the game and it almost always works for me. Sometimes the games are really dirty. Try it!   EDIT:  i totally get an F for reading comprehension.   For what it's worth, I never boiled my 72 pin connector but we did the thing where you ""pull"" the pins up with a small tool. Worked like a charm though.

Sometimes if the RF shielding and board aren't lined up right you run into weird issues like this.   I recently repaired an NES for the first time in 3-4 years and spent about an hour reseating everything, then screwing it back in so it lined up just right. I suspect something (probably the big metal RF shield) is sticking up too high and causing the door to be misaligned."

nes,2uiygn,TastySnax,3,Mon Feb 2 16:01:41 2015 UTC,You need to replace the AC adapter. If it's not outputting voltage correctly it can cause those issues. The buzzing you're hearing is due to using the wrong AC adapter as well.

nes,2uiygn,icantrecallaccnt,1 point,Mon Feb 2 18:23:22 2015 UTC,So the NES ac transformer outputs AC voltage which the NES then uses a bridge rectifier and 7805 voltage converter to drop it down to 5V DC.  The model 2 genesis adapter outputs DC.  My money is on your bridge rectifier or 7805 going out. Either is relatively trivial to replace if you're good at soldering. You could just run it with an aftermarket DC power supply since the NES converts to that internally anyhow.
nes,2uiygn,aCreditGuru,1 point,Mon Feb 2 18:38:28 2015 UTC,"My nes did the same thing for years.  About 6 months ago I went to a local game shop and bought a new adapter for it.

nes,2udc1l,rezb1t,3,Wed Feb 4 11:49:47 2015 UTC,"For me, the biggest factor is that emulation is still no where near perfect, sans the SNES. I hate it when I'm playing a game and there's a glitch, and I can't even be sure if it's how the game is actually supposed to play. In practice you might think this problem is rare, but nestopia undead, the most accurate open source NES emulator(to my knowledge), still has many instances of incorrect behavior or games flat out not booting.  Another huge issue for me is latency. When playing on an emulator, despite your best efforts, there will be a delay between when something happens and when it is displayed on screen. This is typically created by the fact that the computers emulating these old consoles are running operating systems, so there is no direct calls to hardware. On many android devices the delay is terrible, between 120-200ms. It sounds small but it can really affect you in timing sensitive games. Even on my PC I get about 40-60ms, which is just enough to be perceptible and slightly annoy me.  This might sound stupid, but I play Gimmick, Castlevania 3 and Mega Man a lot, and the latency actually screws up my timing for a lot of things. Once you notice the latency, you can't go back!  IMO Flash carts are a very good solution to this problem. You get the advantage of running ROMs but they are running on the actual console. The flash cart could be simulating the game mapper incorrectly, but for most US and European releases this isn't a concern because the mappers are very simple.  Consider getting an Everdrive N8 or a Powerpak to avoid having to buy every game, but pick up the games that mean something to you anyway :) I know my Famicom collection means a lot to me"
nes,2udc1l,TXFDA,3,Sun Feb 1 03:08:03 2015 UTC,"You mentioned the Everdrive N8 and Powerpak..   You wouldn't happen to have a preference would you? I'm probably gonna look them up to see the difference, but I wouldn't mind hearing an actual opinion too. I'm planning on getting an NES some time this year (I'd have one already if it wasn't for money..), and I'd love to get a flash cart for it. I just don't know what the difference between the two are."
nes,2udc1l,rezb1t,1 point,Sun Feb 1 05:29:27 2015 UTC,"It's a bit of a complicated comparison. The short story is : Get the Everdrive N8 unless you really want to play one of the MMC5 games (except Castlevania III, that works on the Everdrive) or you really want NSF support.  The PowerPak and Everdrive N8 both work in pretty similar ways. The Everdrive N8 uses newer hardware than the PowerPak and it currently supports more mappers, but there are a few things that are better on the PowerPak.  The PowerPak also uses CF cards instead of SD cards which kind of sucks... Finally, the Everdrive N8 is still supported by krikzz while the PowerPak hasn't received an official update in a while.  So, overall, Everdrive N8 wins.  If you want NSF support, the PowerPak might be a better pick though."
nes,2udc1l,TXFDA,2,Sun Feb 1 05:55:40 2015 UTC,"Nice, thanks. I have no need for NSF support, and the fact that the N8 is still supported is good. I think I'll get an Everdrive then.  Thanks again."
nes,2udc1l,rezb1t,2,Sun Feb 1 06:06:22 2015 UTC,"Wow I actually had no clue that NES emulation still had issues and bugs. I totally agree with the everdrive statement, I purchased one for my N64 because too many games had emulation errors as well as high pricetags for physical copies."
nes,2udc1l,Dakooldog,2,Sun Feb 1 05:39:23 2015 UTC,"N64 emulation is pretty much the worst :( NES emulation isn't bad by any means, you can enjoy all the big name titles without any issues, but it's still not perfect. Here's some testing done by the TASvideos community regarding NES accuracy:  http://tasvideos.org/EmulatorResources/NESAccuracyTests.html"
nes,2udc1l,captain_herbal_life,3,Sun Feb 1 06:28:08 2015 UTC,"This not only applies to my NES collection, but to everything I have in my collection as a whole. To put it simply, collecting anything under 16 bit for me is having a relic of a beautiful culture and beautiful time for videogames. The early days were damn good, and it's nice to have a piece of the past that has so much influence sitting on my shelf to marvel at and wonder what kind of inspiration that game gave to someone to further develop the video gaming culture or industry as a whole. But, 8-16 bit emulation is damn near perfect, if not 100%. The same applies to 32 bit and above, on top of obscure system emulation being underdeveloped. Its nice to just sit down, and play a game it was meant to be played and experience it how it was meant to be experienced."
nes,2udc1l,TXFDA,2,Sun Feb 1 08:02:38 2015 UTC,"It all comes down to doing what you love. Your collection should speak something about you. I collect only the titles I wanna play, for the most part, but others go all out (flea markets hunters, CIB, sealed, etc). I have to delete apps off my phone so that I stop buying games. But just think about it this way, there are people that collect vinyl, guns, cars, stamps, cups, wine, books, cats, you name it, some one, somewhere collects it. Why do they do it; because it fills them with joy, it fulfills them and it brings back memories nothing else can replicate.   This just in, getting mega man 2 & 3 tomorrow!"
nes,2udc1l,Sidetrakkd,1 point,Sun Feb 1 03:54:36 2015 UTC,That's a pretty good way of looking at it. Collecting physical copies of my favorites seems to be the way to go. You can't go wrong with getting physical copies of the Mega Man games. Completely eliminating my ability to use save states brought me many hours of fun / frustration.
nes,2udc1l,NintendoVHSVinyl,2,Sun Feb 1 05:43:52 2015 UTC,As others have mentioned it's nostalgia. I have 3 Wiis all modded to play NES games. The Wii controller sideways is pretty good at being a NES controller.   But really it comes down to time. If I don't have the time to dedicate to a game to where I can get to a password screen I use the Wii. That way I can save-state and not have to worry about losing progress.
nes,2udc1l,lebagnard,1 point,Sun Feb 1 04:28:42 2015 UTC,Yeah I can imagine that the old usage of passwords or the need to keep a game paused for long periods could really shed some light on just how useful save-states are for people with busy schedules. It works great with NES titles since a lot of them have a really nice 'pick up and play' style.

I mean, I did at one time, years and years ago, but they got sold, which I regret nowadays.  But I'm thinking about some time around the end of the year, I might buy an NES and start buying some games for it. I probably won't 'collect' so much as just get the games I want. I'll probably get an Everdrive to play other games and just buy a few loose games here and there, and maybe some repros.  The reason for wanting to buy an NES and some NES games, is simply Nostalgia and fun. I like the NES. It's one of my favorite game systems ever, and I play NES games (through emulation) more than modern games. I'd love to have an NES and a small collection of games that I like. Even if I have them, I'll probably still emulate at times because it's just..easier. But the simple idea of owning a physical NES and carts is a nice idea to me."

nes,2u3r0t,Rastervision,3,Thu Jan 29 19:20:51 2015 UTC,... And no one is there because they went to get the Q-tips and alcohol to clean the cartridge. :)
nes,2u3r0t,jeff_from_antarctica,2,Fri Jan 30 20:06:56 2015 UTC,That's quite nice. The only thing that really sticks out is the lack of the label on the NES controllers.

They've improved the interface in the last few versions, though, and are working to make it more user friendly.  edit: the tutorial and support community is pretty strong, as well.  Youtube has a nice variety of helpful tutorials, as I'm sure you're aware.  To be fair, it must be a nightmare finding how to tuck away all of the options and necessary tools needed in 3D software.  Other similar packages (Maya, Lightwave, Softimage, etc., which can be very expensive)have a steep curve as well.  I love blender because it's robust and absolutely free.  What an amazing age we live in.  edit:  I swear I'm not here to hype Blender.  I'm just really fond of it, I guess.  I appreciate your compliment.  :)"

I'm sure you know that there are tons of great tutorials out there.  I'd encourage anyone with a passion for this sort of thing to go for it full force.  It's overwhelming at times, but over time you'll look back and see many, many areas in which you've improved.  Give yourself little projects and don't quit until the project is completed.  Even if it's less than perfect in the end, you'll learn tons along the way!"

nes,2u3r0t,Remmy,1 point,Sun Feb 1 01:10:16 2015 UTC,Any chance you can share the source so I can render it for my dual screen steup?  Heck maybe my triple monitor setup as well?  Or will you take requests for specific resolutions?  =)
nes,2u3r0t,CoryZ40,3,Thu Jan 29 19:53:20 2015 UTC,"I'd really, really like to accommodate either or both of these ideas.  Problem is that the scene's not optimized at all (Because I didn't have the scene in mind when I built the models, I scanned textures at resolutions higher than is needed, and when modeling, I used more geometry than is called for as well.)  Because of that, the files necessary for rendering would be a real pain to upload.  In addition, the floor texture is from Andrew Price's Architecture Academy, so I'd have to look into whether I have the rights to distribute that or not.  That said, I'm open to suggestions, and might even be willing (at some point within the next week) to sit down and downres/relink more appropriate texture sizes.  I have no qualms at all with sharing.  The problem with taking render requests is simply that of render time.  The scene being so un-optomized and because I'm running on a mid-level machine, this quality and resolution took me between 20-25 hours to render in total.  I'm open to suggestions here as well, though.  I could certainly do a lower quality render and that would take less time, but that means more noise throughout the image.  When I set out to make this, I liked the idea of sharing the setup freely.  I still do, but I've got to figure out the best way to do it.  What sort of resolution would you be looking for?  Any idea how you'd like everything framed?"
nes,2u3r0t,maanto,2,Thu Jan 29 20:11:51 2015 UTC,"Apologies for the very late response.  I understand your apprehension in releasing your base files.  I asked for shared at first due to the scene probably being larger than the camera shows.  The TV for example, the walls etc, so I could use more of those things in my shot in order to fill the massive space that my monitors create.  I run two different setups:   3840x1024 4096x1152   About framing... I'm not sure really, the better it fits, the better ... obvious I know, but... I can't imagine a smooth transition at all."
nes,2u3r0t,maanto,1 point,Mon Feb 2 17:48:31 2015 UTC,"Thanks for getting back with me.  Give me a week or two and I'll see if I can't figure something out.  I've had a request for a nighttime render as well, so I might set up a few of these custom renders.  If I do, I'll post them and let you know about them."

nes,2u04rh,sourjough,2,Thu Jan 29 00:35:11 2015 UTC,Pretty sure the biggest single contributor to the price is the RGB PPU.  The original NES PPU output composite video directly from the chip; to get RGB you have to swap it with a PPU from a Playchoice-10 system.  Price 'Playchoice 10 PPU' on eBay for fun. :V  The palette on the PC10 is also slightly different than the NES; see second post down. http://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?f=21&t=10970

Also, if you do get it you can get white high end controller ports made by them. I just wish they would release a video that showed a comparison of the hdmi vs standard coax/av cables."

nes,2tre10,DNA128k,2,Mon Jan 26 21:04:02 2015 UTC,"If your earthbound cart is using the 'zero' ROM then it's modified to be easier.

I was happy with his work (though I'm wondering why the hell I decided to buy HeroQuest; not recommended).  If you like Zelda, I highly recommend the Zelda Outlands hack.  Super well-done.  I played it on emulator but I liked it well enough to get it on a cart."
nes,2tre10,atomiswave2,2,Mon Jan 26 21:22:04 2015 UTC,"AWESOME. Though in the original Super Mario Bros. 2 (Japan), if you play through the whole game without warping, and achieve the coveted world 9, the game provides you with only 1 life. Oh, the pain! In the Lost Levels version the game lets you retain existing lives. Just a heads up!"
nes,2tre10,Grantagonist,2,Mon Jan 26 22:33:08 2015 UTC,"The only ones I've played out of that, are Mario and Recca. Emulated, but still. I have issues getting into the 2D rpg games for some reason. I'm not against them, I just can't get myself to sit for a long time and play them. The only 2D RPG I've sat and finished, is Chrono Trigger.  I've always liked the idea of Repros. Especially of good rom hacks. There's definitely quite a few rom hacks I would get Repros of if I had the chance. Currently though, I lack an NES, or the money to get one. I do have an SNES though, so I might get some for that when I get some money."

nes,2tre10,atomiswave2,2,Mon Jan 26 22:00:42 2015 UTC,I sent the carts that were required or that I had on hand. As I recall they were. I don't know of anyone who does SNES carts. Though I'm looking as I would like FF5 as well.  Super Mario Bros 2 <--Mandatory for FF3  The Legend of Zelda <---one of few options  Cyber Stadium Series: Base Wars  Home Alone 2  Tetris 2
nes,2tre10,SagiMewtwo,1 point,Mon Jan 26 22:27:53 2015 UTC,"Many ""repro"" (what a crap term that is) sites find their own raw materials.  You just buy them, like any store.  NesReproductions sells a little cheaper, but you have to supply a ""donor"" cart.  Certain games require certain donors; this is because many games have slightly different chipsets.  Check their site and you'll see that each game has a list of applicable donors.  Sadly, shitty cheap sports games are not always sufficient.  To find repro dealers, just search Google for ""NES [or SNES] reproductions"".  There are a lot of guys who make and sell them."
nes,2tre10,mckgn,1 point,Tue Jan 27 03:46:19 2015 UTC,"For repros, depending on the system, there are different things to look out for: SNES: Size of the game,  Does it have battery save, Does it use FX chip.   NES:  PCB type,  Size of the game.   (I'm kinda generalizing here, but it makes the thought process easier) SNES games are easy to repro until you get to the larger games like Clock Tower and Secret of Mana.  Those require a flash chip that's more expensive and harder to solder.  NES games take more research to figure out which repro can be made with what donor, but the skill required to make the repro is less than that of larger SNES games."
nes,2tre10,mckgn,1 point,Tue Jan 27 23:50:08 2015 UTC,I have a snes game called Vortex with the super fx chip and its a terrible game. I world trade that in a heartbeat. I heard I can use a super fx chip in a sd2snes solder it in there.
nes,2tre10,Bender3455,1 point,Wed Jan 28 07:18:38 2015 UTC,I'd definitely love to get Mother/Earthbound 0 since Earthbound is one of my all time favourite games.
nes,2tre10,mckgn,1 point,Mon Jan 26 23:22:31 2015 UTC,"Maybe a dumb question, but does anyone actually produce these without using donor carts? I'd rather not take more games out of circulation since the prices are constantly climbing as is (not that all of the games are good that need to be used for a donor, but some are).  Also if you have a cart that may not be working on your NES, would they be able to use it? Cause maybe it's not a dirty factor, maybe something is internally wrong, and when they flash it or whatever it may work. I don't know the whole process but that would be a great reason to buy non working carts."

Well, video game collecting is kind of the same sport. The people who grew up in the 80s and 90s with an NES and would stare at store shelves drooling over games they didn't have now have the resources to obtain them. And with the NES as popular was it was, its popularity as a collectable has exploded in recent years."
nes,2t9tug,icantrecallaccnt,2,Thu Jan 22 16:08:21 2015 UTC,"The parallels don't end there. Look at what Nintendo is doing with Limited Edition consoles and Amiibos. It echoes what Marvel was doing with LE covers, variants, and so forth. History is repeating itself."
nes,2t9tug,DarkKobold,1 point,Thu Jan 22 17:41:52 2015 UTC,"yep.  You're seeing more and more of games aimed as being collectables.   I remember when Ocarina of Time came out in the US. While ""Collectors Editions"" were common in Japan. That was the first time I can remember a special edition variant of a game being specifically created for the US market. In that case it was for preorders only and the idea that a video game became a collectors item was novel for a publisher to identify in the US.   Compare that to today when practically every product NISA releases has a limited collectors edition released. How times have changed."

nes,2t9tug,4-bit,3,Thu Jan 22 21:17:33 2015 UTC,I was sort of in the same boat as you. I started collecting about 10 15 years ago and life got in the way as it does. Got back into it 2 years ago and it's gotten ridiculous. Even people at flea markets and garage sales seem to gauge. The game store in my town sells things for way more than the eBay prices. I hope this is a bubble that pops soon.
nes,2t9tug,thefacelxxix,3,Thu Jan 22 20:11:48 2015 UTC,Bionic Commando is worth about $7 now (loose). I would avoid whatever shop you're at because they sound way over priced.  Game prices have increased a lot recently but no way is Bionic Commando a $40 game.
nes,2t9tug,cynicaljedi,1 point,Thu Jan 22 20:46:03 2015 UTC,"Yeah its back in my home town back in Canada so I dont go there often. They seem to have a pattern there like if a game was popular, its 40$ regardless of its rarity.   Here in europe I find the average price for ntsc games is 10-15â¬. Will never be as good as in the US, but I will have to live with it."
nes,2t9tug,HarryManilow,2,Fri Jan 23 08:27:57 2015 UTC,A bit of it can be traced to when a console bundled with games sold for like 10 grand.  A lot of people didn't read up and find out it was only because Stadium Events was one of the games.  So scalping and resellers have been pretty crazy for a while now.  That's also the explanation for that infamous Storage Wars clip
nes,2t9tug,superkneemaster,2,Thu Jan 22 09:22:03 2015 UTC,"it's gotten nuts. i had no idea a lot of my games would be worth anything now. I acquired most of mine new as a kid, and bought some loose ones on eBay in the early 2000s and late 90s for basically pennies.  i have to wonder if they'll ever be worth more than they are right now, too. Not considering selling them because it's not enough money to change my life or anything, but they seem kind of absurdly priced right now. There are millions of these things. The new R Kelly album is more rare.   People will make posts saying ""best $200 ever spent!"" and it's three loose Mario carts. Crazy."

Over 300 games, and the console for $100. At the time I was full into the 64/ps1 era so no one wanted these old games. My friend ended up getting the box and the idiot gave it away to some family(good on them I guess).  Will never get an opportunity like that again. I may have to brefriend that family..."
nes,2t9tug,tortus,1 point,Fri Jan 23 08:31:51 2015 UTC,This is true of just about all retro systems. My Neo Geo collection has outdone the stock market by orders of magnitude.
nes,2t9tug,icantrecallaccnt,2,Thu Jan 22 17:12:40 2015 UTC,"Well it's true from when used prices were lower. Looking at Neo-Geo, the average AES game was 250-300.00 brand new. There's a lot of cheapee carts out there. I'd imagine when you consider inflation ""most"" AES games aren't worth what they were brand new.  Yes, the later releases (post 1995 or so) particularly US versions all go for a good amount of money and a lot are worth more than they were new but as of right now that's not the case with most of the lineup.  There's also the fact that people who bought Neo-Geo stuff (I'm talking AES carts here and not MVS or CD stuff) were pretty big into gaming as a hobby and took care of their stuff.  They also had nice plastic cases.  Hence the default expectation of condition for AES games are cart, case and manual rather than with NES,SNES,TG16 (at least the earlier boxed games) where loose carts are the vast majority and complete games are considerably less common and more valuable than most copies in circulation."
nes,2t9tug,tortus,2,Thu Jan 22 19:38:45 2015 UTC,"AES games started at $200 in 1990 and crept towards $300 towards the end of the system's life.  Most early games are not worth much because they made too many of them. It's still possible to get games like Magician Lord and Nam 75 brand new to this day. There are exceptions to this, but as a general rule of thumb it stands.  But quite a few games are weighing in around the $1000 mark these days, and some hover around $2000+. Even games long considered ""common"" and not ""that great"" such as Sengoku 3 US now sell regularly on eBay for $1300+    So depending on when one started collecting AES, it's possible their collection has gone up dramatically in value.    btw, this is also true of Neo Geo Pocket Color games. The UK clamshell releases of certain games now easily get into $500+ territory."

nes,2t9tug,gyp_casino,1 point,Thu Jan 22 18:55:43 2015 UTC,"The same happen here in France, there had been a lot of newcomers on the ""market"" and mostly very interested in profit ones :/. So the only games I bought these last years were very common ones, when a seller sold a bunch of titles I didn't own for a acceptable price. Here there have been a lot of ""popular"" youtubers which reviewed retro games and then, they were tons of kids ready to buy these games at very high prices, just to follow the hype, and the prices went nuts. I don't know if it's the same case anywhere else. It's sad to think that now I can't buy some classic gems like some Megaman, Castlevania or even some Mario games without selling my organs. I even saw SMB 1 on the nes, loose, broken cartdridge (it had to hit the floor, and not once) for 15 â¬ (17 $) in shop, and anyone know that super mario 1 is a very rare title haha. And the salesguy from the shop came to me ""we have very rare nintendo games, like King Kong"", first it was Donkey Kong, second, it's not rare XD."
nes,2t9tug,Charleaux330,1 point,Thu Jan 22 23:17:44 2015 UTC,"Some like to buy the rare stuff so they can sell it, and there's retro game shops EVERYWHERE looking to scoop up deals both online and off, local or not, so they can turn a profit.  Still, I think the biggest problem isn't necessarily the business end of it, but the fact that most of the people who played the NES as children are now adults, and are viewing the past with rose colored glasses.  I know I certainly am... that said, I've emulated games for a long, long time.  I've never really lost my love for the old games, but I DID hate myself for getting rid of all that old stuff.    As a result, things are only going to get worse.  Keep in mind, I grew up in the 80's, but there's another generation behind me that grew up beginning with the SNES, and another behind that starting with the N64, and so on.  Retro gaming is likely going to get more and more popular as more and more find themselves wanting to relive their childhood fun... meaning stock will go down, while demand and prices go up.  Buy now if you want something.  That's my advice."
nes,2t9tug,thankyouforfu,1 point,Fri Jan 23 20:23:41 2015 UTC,I think one driver of retro gaming collecting is the popularity of gaming channels on YouTube.  There are a number of great retro gaming channels that have increased the enthusiasm for collecting.

nes,2t7bu0,battraman,2,Wed Jan 21 22:48:18 2015 UTC,"Thank you! I have always wondered why this game went so unnoticed? This game was one of the prides of my collection. The artwork on the box and cart were beautiful. The story was original, and coherent. You got multiple weapon upgrades, and a large variety of sub weapons and utility items.(Remember getting hit by nothing in the graveyard until you figured out what the torch was for?) The bosses were varied, the bonus rooms had that ""don't get greedy"" twist, as well as the extra life signs. The music was awesome, and ill never forget hearing the music on the final stage.  My only complaint, was that if you didn't get the instructions (like me) you didn't get A)A very important code, and B)Nowhere in the game does it tell you to pause and press down to access your second inventory. (If you never figured out what the torch was for, this is why)   This is what I always consider to be a gem of game that never got enough recognition. It got one sequel near the end of the NES' lifespan, and it was promoted along with Mega Man 6 for a brief period, and it as well faded into obscurity. This could have been an amazing franchise (still could if they chose to IMO) and I think it's shame it hasn't even gotten a nod in Smash Brothers. Mike would be killer."
nes,2t7bu0,TXFDA,2,Thu Jan 22 01:47:11 2015 UTC,"Mike in Smash would be totally devastating! And I'm so glad I finally bumped into someone else who agrees that there should be some sort of continuity in the series! Sure, it might be considered niche, but I see nothing but greatness!  As for the inventory system, I completely understand! I used to get so PISSED during the 1st boss fight because I didn't think to freeze him, nor even knew of the inventory system!  Thank you so much for your passionate and thoughtful response! Good times! :-)"
nes,2t7bu0,Empolo,2,Thu Jan 22 02:40:59 2015 UTC,"As we talked of Dizzy earlier, you clearly have great taste in NES games. What is your take of Snake Rattle and Roll and or Snow Bros? Crystalis?"
nes,2t7bu0,Empolo,2,Thu Jan 22 02:45:37 2015 UTC,"Thanks! :-) I happen to love both Snake Rattle & Roll and Snow Bros! Snake Rattle and Roll has an amazing soundtrack that fits the action perfectly, and has a very unique, isometric perspective, crazy enemies, and blends action and strategy very well!  Snow Bros. is epic in that it featured simultaneous 2-player action, and is fast-paced and epic! Not to mention that the art is beautiful! I can totally get lost in games like these! :-)  I haven't had the chance to play Crystalis yet, but I may be picking that up here in the next month or so, and from what I can tell, it looks pretty awesome! :-)"
nes,2t71qo,SpookyMcPants,5,Wed Jan 21 18:26:56 2015 UTC,So the game would be walking around until Jason appears or a house flashes... I thought the game was boring before! I'd rather have something to do while I wait for the children to be slaughtered in the lake house because I'm stuck in a forest loop.
nes,2t71qo,revgill,3,Wed Jan 21 19:21:08 2015 UTC,"I kinda liked this game. It was fairly ridiculous but it had a certain take your time play when you're bored type of charm to it.  Plus, Jason kills the campers. Finally."

IMO it's important to play for victory with NES games, even if it seems very tough.  Beating the game is like making a friend who you can then revisit over the years.  Playing for a few hours and then giving up just leaves you with the memory of a weird, frustrating experience in low-res graphics."

nes,2sy7om,XXXCheckmate,16,Tue Jan 20 05:06:28 2015 UTC,"I think it depends on how you want to define difficulty.  I see it as two kinds of difficulty: difficulty because of good game design, and difficulty just for the sake of being unfair.  An NES game that is challenging because of good game design would probably be the Japanese Super Mario Bros. 2.  There was definitely a lot of challenging moments, but with trial and error it was definitely beatable with time and dedication.  The same can be said about Mega Man 1 and 2, Castlevania, Contra, Battletoads (for the most part), Ninja Gaiden, and plenty of other games.  As for games that create an artificial challenge simply by making the game unfair, examples would include Double Dragon III and the Silver Surfer game that you mentioned."

You are so right about the controls being fair. So many times I would get hit and instantly wonder why I broke from the pattern I had used every time prior. Those last stages are a bitch.

I just started playing it the other day (haven't touched it since september, busy uni student), still got that whole part down. Once you do it a billion times, you have it forever :P"
nes,2sy7om,shelcod,1 point,Mon Jan 19 23:59:18 2015 UTC,Yea lot of trial and error. The later stages (especially the clock tower) have insane amounts of precision jumps.

nes,2sy7om,CantoDragon,2,Mon Jan 19 17:57:16 2015 UTC,"The thing about most of these games is that they're entertaining enough to keep trying.  Mega Man especially.  Half the fun was just trying to figure out which order to beat the bosses.  It was probably the first non-linear game I ever played, and I really liked that I was able to choose which order to tackle the levels.  Karnov is one of those games you have to let grow on you.  The controls are klunky, and the odds seem heavily stacked against you from the onset, but if you can get past the first couple of stages it really starts to grow a beard.  Rygar rules.  And TMNT... it was just brutal for no good reason.  The controls were awful.  The level design was sadistic at best.  And it was very unforgiving if you made any mistakes.  Hats off to anyone that stuck with it and beat that game."

nes,2sxhgb,ColonelCo,3,Mon Jan 19 12:33:17 2015 UTC,"I had this same issue with my old nes. I even bought a new Chinese 72 pin connector to replace the original.  After about a week of dealing with the games never working despite the fact I had meticulously cleaned all of them and had a new connector, I wasn't going to start blowing in them again. After doing some investigation I discovered that the red light comes on often not because of a bad connection, but because the lockout chip went bad in the console, and isn't validating the games properly. If you look up how to disable the chip by cutting one of the pins, not only will you games work more often, the system will no longer flash when games do not work, because the chip causes that and it's now disabled. My games work much more often on the first try now without blowing, and I still use my now cleaned 72 pin connector, as well. A video of the procedure was easy to find on YouTube. EDIT: Words."

I have had a few games where i needed to open the whole game case to clean the few spots of the contacts hidden by the plastic, after that they worked like a charm.

The NES used regular AV cables so that's no problem, and the Power adapter is a pretty common one (9V, 1 amp or 1000 mA). I have come across dozens of these power adapters at thrift stores near me, or the original Power adapter can be found for around 8 dollars if you want it to be fully authentic. Don't get ripped off by scammers, you'll just hate yourself in the long run."

Honestly, I just have one of the very common 3 in 1 wall warts that work for the NES, SNES and Genesis Model 1 (not at the same time, though) and just plug them in when I need them."

To be fair - it's not overly hard, and it is the easiest of the game's levels. But as a novice coming into the game, it's difficult enough to be rather off putting. KQF's Lvl 1 should be it's Lvl 2, with a more basic introductory level offering a slightly rewarding sense of accomplishment for noobs.  I was a kid when I got this and the story is pure wtf. A NYC cop is digitised into a computer and because his grandfather was Japanese (or something) he appears wearing kabuki theatre garb.  After seeing this review I wanna go and play it again!"

It's not like they've made them in the past 1.5 almost 2 decades. So if your's is in good condition and working now, it goes without need of thought or speech that his (if in good condition) would also work.  The man is asking how much longer a life can he expect from this device. To answer you must ask yourself 'how much longer do I expect mine to last?""  So Prit!

This was around '97 or '98, so we were still far away from the hand holding games of today. I just didn't have the patience at that age to adapt to something so different than what I was used to, even if it was from a simpler time.   Funny thing is that I now consider Super Mario Bros. to be the greatest video game ever made. The NES is my all time favorite console now and I have amassed almost 200 games for it and counting. The point I'm trying to make is don't expect young children to react positively to these kind of things.

I can see where most these kids come from though. My dad can destroy me in Space Invaders on our Atari. My brother can destroy me in Mario Kart 64, but hand we a Wii Controller and Mario Kart 8 and I will conquer all. It's a little discouraging to get beaten by my old man playing a game that has one button and only two directions though."

Of course I don't even get close to the rose tinted glasses to say all games from that era were great.  That said games that took the limitations into account made for amazing fun with limited but polished gameplay.  More games should strive for that now instead of complicating the heck out of gameplay.

A lot of the old games don't have that smooth flow and virtually none of them have much in the way of geometry (you kind of have to go to the vector games for that). Maybe they're responding to the non-representational nature of Super Hexagon, and something like SMB isn't going to scratch the same itch as that. Welp, good luck anyway"

The most valuable game you have is Donkey Kong Jr. Math, but only because of rarity.  It sucks, but it's a launch game that wasn't produced in high numbers (shocker; no one bought the educational game!).  Looks like you can expect $40+.  The Mega Man games, Castlevania, Super Mario 2, and Mike Tyson's Punch Out are your next highest.  They're not rare, but they're fun and well-recognized.  $20-$30 each.  Metroid's about $15-$20.  All of your baseball games are near worthless except Baseball (the plain Nintendo one), which is slightly better than worthless because it's a launch game.  Top Gun is also worthless.  The rest aren't of any notable value; $3-$10 each.  Please double-check my numbers, of course.  Again, pricecharting.com is your best resource.  All the $15+ games you should sell individually.  The rest you ought to sell as a lot or include as freebies with your systems."

nes,2ruzvz,Kmac09,1 point,Sat Jan 10 04:03:52 2015 UTC,Those EPROM chips need to be erased with a special tool. Sure I bet laying it out in the sun an hour would damage some of the data for sure. But hanging on the wall in someones game room? Doubtful.
nes,2ruzvz,rainwarrior,1 point,Fri Jan 9 20:40:19 2015 UTC,I believe UV exposure in general is what was used to erase EPROMs.  Even then they weren't really designed to last forever so they may be bad anyway.  Still storing them uncovered will not do them any favors.
nes,2ruzvz,KTown_Killa,1 point,Fri Jan 9 20:45:45 2015 UTC,Well sure but usually they would use something like this to concentrate the UV light. It would need to sit outside in direct sunlight for hours to completely erase it. Regardless I think its silly to place such value on a cartridge that will have data degradation over time even if its sitting in a black box in a closet somewhere.
nes,2ruzvz,pieps86,2,Fri Jan 9 20:52:15 2015 UTC,It is true you would definitely use something like that to ensure it was erased before reprogramming.  You would never leave the actual EPROMs uncovered though.  That said completely agree that most of those carts are just collectors items and likely unplayable at this point anyway.
nes,2ruzvz,ChrisRK,2,Fri Jan 9 20:57:10 2015 UTC,Thank goodness that we have the ROM dumps of these. I am all for backups when it comes to backuping important pieces of gaming history.  I went to panel on game preservation at the Portland Retro Gaming expo by Roo from Clan of Grey Wolf. It was pretty interesting on what can destroy games and it actually seems to be a pretty common problem across the board if stuff isn't taken care of.
nes,2ruzvz,rainwarrior,0,Fri Jan 9 21:04:51 2015 UTC,"Indirect sunlight will do it, just very slowly. An EPROM eraser isn't that special, just a box with a flourescent UV light that does the job quickly and thoroughly."

Like /u/Company_Whip mentioned, most NES covers are straight out of the Iron Maiden playbook (including some of my own), but this one is a fair bit slower, especially in the drum department. - Almost 4 on the floor, no ""galloping"" on the kicks/rhythm guitar.

Not just a story, but an actual, factual source that Nintendo said ""to convince customers it's a toy not a game system?""   The entire NES system was redesigned from the famicom for that very purpose, though. It was (as I understand) a separate add-on in Japan, but for the NES the original set included ROB.  In terms of sources, though- there is a television program called ""Icons"" and according to a Wiki cite note, Episode #5010 covers this, and has input from various Nintendo employees that were around at the time and provide first hand information on some of those decisions.   ""We didn't want to launch just a game platform, because everybody at retail was saying 'Another game platform, we just did that, we just got done with that, why would we do that again?' so we had to come up with something a little more Americanized and something with more of a hook to it.""   -Don James, Executive VP of operations, Nintendo of America  It also covers the subject you are referencing. After the NES was designed (After the failure of the first design of the ""AVS"" version of the famicom at the CES) they approached Atari with a partnership proposition, where Atari would be the distributor in the United States. Nintendo's reasoning was because Atari was well known in the U.S for Gaming products, whereas Nintendo was practically an unknown. Atari turned it down and Nintendo gave NOA the chance to launch the new system in the United States. New York City became the Test Market, with a Focus group. The kids had a very negative reaction to the system.  ""in Early 1985, the engineers at Nintendo came up with R.O.B the robot, which was made part of the Nintendo Entertainment System. So we went to retailers, 'No, this isn't a home video game like an Atari, this has R.O.B the Robot""  -Howard Lincoln, Former Chairman of Nintendo of America  Here is a arguably crap quality youtube upload of the episode I was able to find: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_CuFfZGDbw"
nes,2r47h9,tortus,2,Sun Jan 4 09:26:40 2015 UTC,"See, and I remember watching that, and just watched it again (thank you!) and came away with an entirely different take on it.  Here's the problem I keep running into in my mind.  Who is stupid enough to not recognize the Nintendo for what it is, even with the robot?  Seriously.  Rob didn't get people to think ""oh, I guess it's NOT a game system"" rather it's got the potential to be a game system AND some other things.  Because here's what was shown:  http://kotaku.com/5938751/your-nes-could-have-had-a-keyboard-and-wireless-controllers  It looks like any of the other early computer systems.  the C64c/128, some of the Apples and Amigas of the time.  It just didn't stand out.  It wasn't that they had been burned, but they had already had too many of that very same thing on the shelf today.  It needed a hook, and not a trojan horse.  What does he say right after they flash that pic on the screen very briefly.  They ditched the keyboard and disk drives and added a toy robot.  They made it MORE of a game, less of a computer.    It seems like a subtle difference, almost inconsequential, but how it flavors everything makes a huge difference.  There's this context that consumers didn't want video games anymore, and yet, we can find proof of lots of people trying to get into and stay in the market at that time, when I don't remember that reality, and when I look at what people are saying, it seems like it's a lot of telephone to fill a narrative that makes a better story than the real one.  While looking all this up, I found another use for ROB.  http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/11/08/the-unknown-story-of-nintendos-secret-weapon  One of the other things ROB did is give two slots on the shelves at stores for Nintendo.  This starved competition for shelf space, and helped hold Atari and Sega back since they couldn't find room in stores.  I'm still looking into this, but the more I dig, the narrative of the crash, and how Nintendo came to be isn't jiving 100% with the common narrative in my mind."

nes,2r47h9,RetroFan89,5,Sat Jan 3 02:46:58 2015 UTC,Yes I have one.  The two games that use it are Gyromite and Stack Up.  In the case of Gyromite rob reads flashes on the TV and you use those to control Robs arms into picking up gyro's and placing them on a rube goldberg machine like contraption that presses the action buttons on your controller in order to move columns out of the way to allow you to progress in the game. It's long and time consuming but fun.  The other game stackup ROB does not directly interface with the game but instead you have to put stacked rubber discs in particular order while ROB physically carries out these motions.

Guerilla War is one of my favorite NES games.  Some of the best arcade action you'll find on the NES.   TMNT 2 is good enough but it's more fun 2 players.  3 is probably a better game overall and was made specifically for the NES rather than getting an inferior (in a lot of ways) port.    NES Q Bert is a pretty good port.   Donkey Kong has a crazy unforgiving ""jump death distance"" thing that kills you if your fall distance is longer than Mario's dick. That's not an exaggeration. I'll never understand why you can barely jump from platform to platform without Mario seeing stars.   Gradius and Life Force are both great but really hard. Life Force is a bit leas dated."

If it appears to be junk, they won't take it.  The owner asks himself if, in his most desperate hour, if that product is something he'd have in his own collection... and if the answer is no, he just doesn't accept it.  The stuff they do receive is completely refurbished... this is the biggest selling point for me.  Every cart that comes in is cleaned, opened to make sure everything is good inside as well (as blowing in those carts for all those years can actually cause rust to form), and they'll test the game to make sure it turns on properly, and that the cart can hold a save.  If the save battery is dead, they replace it.  They price accordingly... meaning two of the exact same game, even if they're cart only, may not be the same price.  He takes the condition of the sticker label on the game into consideration, too.  The condition of EVERYTHING matters in regards to price.  I respect that not everything has a flat fee.  If you can have that kind of quality assurance, you'd easily be a top contender for online retro game shopping... because that's always the biggest concern... finding games that are actually in good shape and aren't already crap out of the box (again, because of it being dirty, dead battery, etc.)"

nes,2qii8v,Abrican,1 point,Sat Dec 27 06:44:44 2014 UTC,"Try cleaning the pins on the games, and/or replacing the 32 pin connector on the NES. Easy fix to do, and both should help you out."
nes,2qii8v,aCreditGuru,1 point,Sat Dec 27 07:51:07 2014 UTC,"I think you meant the 72 pin connector and no don't just go replacing it. It's far better to clean the OEM one.  Step 1: Clean your games with 91% isopropyl alcohol using a q-tip.  Step 2: Disable the 10NES chip on your front loading system.  Step 3: Boil the pin connector and clean the pads for the connector on the board with isopropyl alcohol and q-tips.  That all should get the OP up and running without having to drop the coin on a NES-101 if it's just a cart connection issue. With the OP saying the NES-001 won't turn on anymore it could be anything from bad caps, bad 7805, bad CPU/PPU/work ram, etc."

nes,2qiprx,iamyounow,1 point,Sat Dec 27 08:45:37 2014 UTC,"Yep that's correct. 120$ is probably the cheapest you're going to get it.  There is the yearly sale on retrogate at Black Friday or buying in bulk, in which case they go for about 90$ (also on retrogate). But that's the absolute lowest I've seen it go.  Used copies are pretty rare, usually when I see them sold, if they prove they are official, they go for about 10-15$ less than the new price.  Beware of clones! There are many fakes of the Everdrive N8 out there and they have no where near the game compatibility as the official one, nor are they supported by krikzz. Any store from this page can be trusted as authentic. If you are buying from someone else, ask for a picture of the front and back of the PCB and compare to a picture of the real PCB."
nes,2qiprx,rezb1t,1 point,Sat Dec 27 14:03:38 2014 UTC,Sometimes the various enthusiast forums will do a group buy to get bulk discounts and as stated they have a sale on retrogate on Black Friday where it was 20% off this year. That's where I picked mine up this year.  You can also save a little by modifying a real NES cart shell for the everdrive N8. Here are those directions. Just pick something crappy like pin-bot :P or pick up something super common from a local store for cheap.  As /u/rezb1t said; stay away from clones and the 'china version' which come with no support and limited compatibility.

nes,2qa901,rag3train,9,Wed Dec 24 15:44:56 2014 UTC,Supply and Demand. Snow Bros was released in near the tail end of the NES lifespan but it's a good game and was discovered to be a good game so the demand went up.  Similarly Metal Storm was rediscovered in recent years and what was once a game that fetched a few dollars is now commonly listed at $75 or more.   Not really the ideal way to play it but it's commonly on Famicom multicarts if you want to go that route.
nes,2qa901,battraman,2,Wed Dec 24 16:46:59 2014 UTC,Supply and demand. This guy gets it. Everybody is sick of the hysteria and prices anyway. There will be a second video game crash (on retro games) eventually.

I'd suggest tracking down a copy of the Mega Drive version (although it's not much cheaper) or just emulating the arcade game in MAME, even if you're not nostalgic for those versions.  Retro prices have been going up across the board over the last year or two, mostly due to the abundance of retro articles and youtube series that are exposing all the ""hidden gems"" to new audiences."

Upon reassembly most people don't get the lip under the main board causing cartridges to not click and stay down."

Since the followers of the system bought like 3 games and then played those, they did not have as many ""fans"" as the competition despite one assuming they would when they saw sales figures. The Wii was a success because of its focus on the novelty of motion controls and because of the move to emphasize more casual gaming than its competitors in Xbox 360 or PS3 it was an entertainment thing for group atmospheres for families and such so because of that, everyone had one, but much fewer people would claim to be, ""fans of the Wii"""

I guess the one that always surprises me the most is Genesis, because at the time of the SNES and Genesis, Genesis had almost 50% of the market share.  And Genesis gamers weren't casual gamers either.  Genesis appealed to the hardcore gamer, but for some reason SNES gamers came back to the system and Genesis fans did not.  It really says something about the Nintendo brand."
nes,2pswxx,TheMovieMaverick,2,Sat Dec 20 22:46:08 2014 UTC,"Perhaps it's the staying power of Nintendo? after the Dreamcast I know SEGA all but stopped making consoles, Nintendo is still kicking today with the Wii U with a big part being the Virtual Console, we can play SNES games on the Console but you can't play Genesis games since it was Nintendo's competition. Those who played SNES as a kid will remember these games and will go back to SNES subreddits and those who got into video games too late or with kids were born after the SNES or the NES or Gameboy and all of that will learn of the SNES and go to the subreddit to learn more. I think that's is the best explanation I can think of as for PS2 I am totally baffled I am a big Nintendo fan, but i probably spent more time on my PS2 than my Gamecube. Maybe it is that Nintendo modern consoles focus more on the past and present but PS4 is all about the present and future, once again referring to Virtual Console, maybe I don't know the first thing about Sony."

nes,2pu8nz,mohallor,1 point,Tue Dec 23 03:05:53 2014 UTC,"Sorry for the belated reply, but it took a while for holiday craziness to cool down enough for me to get a chance to play it...  It's kind of an odd case (and is all over the place in rankings), so it depends on your taste.  The gameplay is an idiosyncratic mix of platforming and point-and-click sections.  The platforming isn't difficult enough to pose a real challenge, and the in-game graphics are pretty rudimentary, though supplemented by a fantastic cover painting and a solid soundtrack that's a favorite of cover bands (including ""The Goonies 'R' Good Enough"" in 8-bit!); so what's interesting is figuring out how the various short platforming segments fit together (it definitely requires mapping it out) and how to get items.  And some of it is simply outright peculiar enough to be interesting (taking the Goonies characters and putting them in a plot where the aim is to rescue a mermaid)."

I certainly would have never bit the bullet and bought this expensive piece, had I not played it for hours previously :)  EDIT: In reply to why it wasn't released in the US, I believe that we were going to see a release (judging by the complete state of the dumped prototype of Mr. Gimmick), but I think that poor reception in the other locales didn't help and Electronic Gaming Monthly's review of the game was probably the straw that broke the camel's back. It's a  shame too, because if you read the review, it almost seems as if none of the reviewers(save one) even really played Gimmick.  http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/gimmick/gimmick.htm  EGM review is near the bottom of this page"

Mr. Gimmick does not sound bad by any means, it ranks up amongst the top of the NES library. However Famicom Gimmick steals best sound of any NES or Famicom game ever, in my opinion.  I just made a direct recording of the audio output of my Twin Famicom playing the Gimmick cart posted.

Back then used game stores had ridiculous amounts of NES carts and couldn't get rid of them because at that time they weren't considered vintage, retro or anything like that; they were just considered obsolete. It was a great time for collecting. I'm happily hoarding them all and will for many years to come!"

If the RCA isn't working see if your tv has a combined component & composite input with green being the yellow video input, you may need to change a setting in the tv to tell it that its composite, if it doesn't and its component only or if you cant pick up analog with the tuner you will need to get an adapter."

Older consoles were never meant to run on digital HDTVs and sometimes you run into problems like this or some games not working, most notably games that use the Zapper. You can get a good size CRT for practically nothing these days, just go on Craigslist, or Goodwill, or a thrift store, or even your local recycling center.

Still, I remember these napkins. I think we got them at one of those closeout type stores for super cheap because I'm pretty sure we had them at one of my birthdays or something."

nes,2oy983,adamrools,6,Thu Dec 11 06:52:36 2014 UTC,I would recommend getting a ROM cart. It will let you put the game files on an SD card and put it in the ROM cartridge and play games.  Also to replace the lid buy an NES from eBay that is listed for parts. These are usually broken beyond repair but you could scavenge a lid or top half of an NES unit. You might even be able to find just an NES lid on eBay.
nes,2oy983,oyaknow,3,Thu Dec 11 07:23:39 2014 UTC,i would agree  mostly because the usb thing is not going to work

nes,2ovuva,RhetoricalGamer,7,Wed Dec 10 18:07:47 2014 UTC,"Sooo, why not just buy a 72 pin replacement and disable the lockout chip? It's a $10 part and takes 15 minutes to replace/modify the chip.  Sure the connectors are ""borrowed time"" but they still last for years. Plus, I don't know many people who use and abuse their nes console like they did when we were kids. A new connector should last easily another 20-30 years"
nes,2ovuva,Fallen_Milkman,2,Thu Dec 11 00:10:07 2014 UTC,"Cleaning your games helps a lot too. Actually cleaning them too, not blowing spit into them heh.  My games work on the first try 9/10 times."
nes,2ovuva,rpgguy_1o1,2,Thu Dec 11 00:32:15 2014 UTC,"Many people are turning to cleaning the old pin connectors vs getting a new one. There are a few good reasons for this. The new ones are primarily made very cheaply in China with inferior materials that fail after a short period of time, and they tend to death grip the games so tightly that some people say they damage the cartridges. The old connectors usually are just dirty, and boiling them in a pot of water on the stove for a few minutes is the easiest way to bring your old one back to working like new again.   But, there's an even bigger issue than that causing the red light blink on the NES: The lockout chip inside the console itself fails and causes the games to fail to load even if they do make contact properly. Disabling it is as easy as clipping one of the connections on the chip, and the problem goes away for good."
nes,2ovuva,SnackyChunk,1 point,Thu Dec 11 01:32:20 2014 UTC,"Yeah, I should note that I did disable the lockout chip on mine too.  New 72 pin connectors can get way too tight, but if your original one is too loose you can always bend the pins a bit to tighten them up"
nes,2ovuva,rpgguy_1o1,1 point,Thu Dec 11 01:38:48 2014 UTC,"Yeah, mine were super tight on the replacement I got, and after a little practice, bending them just right with a safety pin got it to work well for me. I managed to fix the original by boiling it eventually, but I keep the new one as a backup."
nes,2ovuva,SnackyChunk,1 point,Thu Dec 11 01:46:24 2014 UTC,I clean mine with a cleaner my friend used at his Bar to clean the brass fixtures. Works amazingly well.   I replaced my connector and disabled the lockout chip. I clean every new game before putting it in my NES. I haven't had an issue with any game in years now.
nes,2ovuva,Fallen_Milkman,1 point,Thu Dec 11 02:05:55 2014 UTC,Is it bar keeper's friend? I know a guy who swears by it for carts
nes,2ovuva,rpgguy_1o1,1 point,Thu Dec 11 04:56:57 2014 UTC,I believe that's what it's called. My friend uses it to clean then end caps and the rails on his bar.
nes,2ovuva,Fallen_Milkman,1 point,Thu Dec 11 15:12:13 2014 UTC,I was thinking the same but the replacement 72 pin connectors are crap and have the death grip. This replaces that and turns it into a slot similar to a snes. It doesn't have the nostalgic feel of pressing the game down though but this definitely looks way better quality wise then a new 72pin connector.
nes,2ovuva,MagicFarts,1 point,Thu Dec 11 14:48:59 2014 UTC,"Well, in my case, because the spring in my NES's cartridge slot is also broken. This covers everything about making my NES functional for $20 instead of having to buy a second, functional NES with a new 72-pin connector for $50."
nes,2ovuva,bigsphinxofquartz,2,Mon Dec 15 17:02:20 2014 UTC,Hmm... Hard to see.. but.. is the connector the same type a super/64 has?
nes,2ovuva,-good-,2,Wed Dec 10 18:26:22 2014 UTC,It effectively makes the toaster NES a side-loading top-loader.  Reading Helps :)

nes,2ovuva,Grantagonist,1 point,Wed Dec 10 20:49:36 2014 UTC,"Definitely a great idea. This essentially makes the front loader almost on par with an AV Famicom with an adapter (I'm not a huge fan of the awkwardness of the front loader in general.)   Still, great to see the NES still getting love after all these years."
nes,2ovuva,battraman,1 point,Wed Dec 10 23:05:03 2014 UTC,"Yeah I really don't see the point of this. If you have to take apart the NES anyway to get this thing in there, just either replace or boil your pins and disable the lockout chip yourself.  I get my games to play with little to no effort for most carts."

The new ones you can buy to replace them are generally much lower quality and wear out way quicker, so unless you've actually snapped a pin off of the original 72 Pin or something you should just clean and re-align that every so often.  I cleaned and re-aligned mine last month, and it plays all of my other games just fine. It's just this Galaga cart giving me problems."

Or, just ask around here and someone will send you another copy, since it's like a $5 game."

I will try some eraser and alcohol.  Here's some updated pics. http://imgur.com/a/O5TnI  The first two are before cleaning and the last two are after. Still getting the same glitchy start up screen. I'm using a Generation NEX player and will have to dig out my original NES to see if has the same result.

nes,2oftpu,Nekrom4n,2,Sat Dec 6 05:56:47 2014 UTC,"Nope, an NTSC NES is fully capable of playing NTSC and Famicom games at full speed, your TV won't affect how fast the game plays. However, if your TV does not support 60hz you might get strange tearing, a black and white picture, or other oddities.  A CRT that can play at both 50hz and 60hz would definitely be ideal.  One final thing to mention is that NTSC AC adapters are usually built for 120V wall plugs, whereas in europe they are generally much higher. If you just plug one of these adapters in it might blow up your NTSC system, you may need to purchase an american power down-converter. Japanese consoles are built for 100V so they also need downconverters.  However, you do not need a downconverter if your AC adapter can change depending on the input voltage! The way to find out is by looking at the power rating: If it says 100-240V AC Input you're good to go  If you meant play NTSC games on a PAL console, sorry but there's really no way to do it, even with modding. PAL NES games require a PAL NES and NTSC games require an NTSC system. The clock speeds are different, the steppings are different, and the way the clocks are divided is also different. The gory details can be found here: http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/Clock_rate"

nes,2oftpu,aerobert,1 point,Sat Dec 6 06:49:57 2014 UTC,What /u/rezb1t said. There's really no good shortcut to play NTSC games on PAL consoles without extensive modding. A NTSC unit with your multiadapter is the best solution. Also be wary of the polarity on your pin on the adapter. Some consoles like the Sega Mega Drive requires negative polarity on center. Multiadapters usually have interchangable pins.

nes,2o8f5t,quezlar,2,Thu Dec 4 18:04:21 2014 UTC,"If you just want to play NES, then go with original hardware. If you want to play multiple systems and don't want all the clutter, then you might want to look into a multi-system clone. If you go that route, then do some research beforehand so you know what you are getting."
nes,2o8f5t,pop361,2,Fri Dec 5 03:11:25 2014 UTC,"Stay away from the clones like others said.  By this point, many consoles have issues reading games, but that can be resolved by cleaning and refurbishing the connector inside."
nes,2o8f5t,seg-fault,1 point,Thu Dec 4 13:59:21 2014 UTC,"Almost everyone here is reccomending buying the original NES, which is good advice. However, I have a Retro Gaming System clone that I got on Amazon for $15 when my NES died and it works quite well. I do reccomend getting original NES controllers if you go this route, and look into which games are not compatible (it's a pretty short list). I'd stay away from the toploader unless you're willing to do an AV mod or pay someone to do it for you, as many TVs don't have an RF input anymore."
nes,2o6k7i,AeroisKing,3,Wed Dec 3 19:30:50 2014 UTC,I'm referring to the plug-n-play all-in-one types. The one we found was called the Maxx Vs all-in-one. The controller did indeed suck it was a modified N64 controller with a light gun sticking out of the top :P
nes,2o6k7i,shelcod,2,Wed Dec 3 23:04:15 2014 UTC,"I think I played something similar, except the N64 controller was seperate from the light gun. The D pad and buttons were also some of the worst I have ever seen. Made the games pretty much unplayable."
nes,2o6k7i,Tito312,2,Wed Dec 3 23:48:59 2014 UTC,"By Famiclone, do you mean a plug-n-play system that is a controller and console in one, or a console with which you could use original NES carts and controllers? I have played both, and the plug-n-play consoles always have some major flaw, like a fulty button or the d-pad is stiff"
nes,2o6k7i,BangkokPadang,2,Wed Dec 3 22:59:07 2014 UTC,LOL I always buy these just to see what zany games are on them.  Every experience I have ever had with them has been worth a single dollar.
nes,2o6k7i,aerobert,2,Thu Dec 4 01:45:41 2014 UTC,"Not a plug-n-play type. But I've tried several regular ones, and one of the best is the Polish Pegasus. It might look like crap, but plays really well."
nes,2o6k7i,ThePenguinParade,2,Thu Dec 4 09:39:33 2014 UTC,"I'll have to check it out then, I'm kinda fallen in love with famiclones. I have another one and my friend and I are gonna do a let's play of us playing through all the game :P"

nes,2o48h8,BrewPounder,1 point,Wed Dec 3 04:38:38 2014 UTC,Unfortunately I've only heard bad things about trying to use Rob as the second player. Maybe if Rob supported more than 2 games and worked on a flatscreen I'd get one.

nes,2o48h8,quezlar,1 point,Wed Dec 3 20:06:49 2014 UTC,Plug a Power Pad into the second port.
nes,2nz7eb,NESAtlas,5,Mon Dec 1 21:12:18 2014 UTC,"I'd love to play a version like this. Being able to, ya know...see the obstacles coming up would make that level at least somewhat possible."
nes,2nz7eb,GameMaster366,6,Tue Dec 2 07:44:08 2014 UTC,"I can't recall how many times it took me to complete this level back in the day. A million times? This layout would have made that level a little more bearable. After finally beating Battletoads, I have no desire to ever play the game again. It was pain."
nes,2nz7eb,ACE_C0ND0R,3,Tue Dec 2 16:51:16 2014 UTC,Beating that game at all is a hell of an achievement. Ive never even come close without savescumming an emulator.  Ive even hooked up five game genies (they work in series) to the cart and used 15 cheat codes...not even close.
nes,2nz7eb,Campmoore,2,Wed Dec 3 01:18:07 2014 UTC,"It was grueling and rage inducing. I beat the game legitimately, but only after trying a billion times."
nes,2nz7eb,ACE_C0ND0R,4,Thu Dec 4 22:43:45 2014 UTC,"I never really had an issue with the Turbo Tunnel. The first time I played Battletoads was at an NES tournament and the guy I was playing it with made it look so easy, so I just followed his movements and evetually figured it out. Now the Snake Pit is hard as hell and I have never legitamitly made it past."
nes,2nz7eb,shelcod,3,Tue Dec 2 17:36:54 2014 UTC,How did you do that?
nes,2nz7eb,wardrich,3,Tue Dec 2 00:03:05 2014 UTC,Here's a time lapse of how it's made.
nes,2nz7eb,wardrich,4,Tue Dec 2 04:10:09 2014 UTC,Thanks!  That's actually pretty rad.  It's too bad we can't fool the emulator into doing something like this during gameplay.
nes,2nz7eb,rainwarrior,2,Tue Dec 2 04:22:20 2014 UTC,"Wow, I was really surprised to see that you do it all by hand! I would have written a program to do the bulk of the alignment."
nes,2nz7eb,vernscustoms,1 point,Wed Dec 3 18:41:34 2014 UTC,"Yeah! People have already tried and I keep a nice playlist of them all.  I think the most efficient way would be to use LUA to layer and position the atlas map from RAM values, then just use After Effects to clean it all up. But so far I've only done it by hand.  The real challenge is to get this all running, while you're actively playing, right in the emulator wink wink ;)"
nes,2nz7eb,Sidetrakkd,2,Thu Dec 4 03:15:40 2014 UTC,Haxor.

nes,2nz7eb,trappedinternethelp,2,Wed Dec 3 16:06:08 2014 UTC,"Aaa! Thanks! I really love the NES Atlas videos, but Battletoads has a special place in my heart."
nes,2o0gfg,Bonus_Erectus,2,Tue Dec 2 03:54:48 2014 UTC,"Those are some excellent games.  If anything is defective, it's the cartridge connector.  It's worth refurbishing the original connector before you resort to buying new ones.  Search youtube for ""nes 72 pin repair"" and you'll find several methods to try.  Don't cheap out on a power supply, either.  Some of the really cheap Chinese ones suck."
nes,2o0gfg,ThetaReactor,1 point,Tue Dec 2 12:21:59 2014 UTC,Is there any power supplies that would suggest?
