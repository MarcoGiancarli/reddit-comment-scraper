ptcgo,3e6ukf,Corey_Austin,1 point,Wed Jul 22 13:07:32 2015 UTC,"I can't confirm legitimacy of this observation, but for me at least it the ex rate has gone down considerably. Just starting out last fall I pulled a bunch, but lately it's gone down noticably. I wonder if anyone else has noticed this over time? If so, could it be patch related or maybe a throttle on players who have been around a while. Upping the ex drop for newbies seems like a good way to encourage participation in the game early on."
ptcgo,3e6ukf,Azaqurah,1 point,Wed Jul 22 14:18:29 2015 UTC,"I'm sure this is just natural variance.  Having said that, the drop rates online do seem to differ depending on the set.  Most people seem to agree that the drop rate improved drastically going from Primal Clash to Roaring Skies.  So that could be part of what you're experiencing as well."
ptcgo,3e6txu,thuglyfe21,5,Wed Jul 22 12:08:13 2015 UTC,No  It's not op
ptcgo,3e6txu,Lightness07,4,Wed Jul 22 12:18:20 2015 UTC,"Lol, Lysandre, I can tell you weren't around a few years ago when Pokemon Catcher didn't require a flip."
ptcgo,3e6txu,Delta_Red,4,Wed Jul 22 12:22:01 2015 UTC,I think its an important card.  There should definitely be a tradeoff to loading your bench with a bunch of Shaymins and Jirachi.  Their abilities are way too good to just go unpunished.  Plus you use up your supporter for the turn.
ptcgo,3e6txu,Lastafay,3,Wed Jul 22 13:44:30 2015 UTC,"You have definitely never played the game back when Gust of Wind was legal. Lysandre is a joke compared to that card, which didn't get banned. What makes you think Lysandre would even brush against the ban hammer?"
ptcgo,3e6txu,Rakkis157,3,Wed Jul 22 12:26:25 2015 UTC,"Catcher used to be a thing like others said and wouldn't it be terrible for some decks that can't do bench dmg to have someone retreat their almost dying EX with 10-20 hp and have no way of interacting with it for the rest of the game.  If we didn't have catcher or lysandre type cards in the game some decks would lose a lot of appeal to play because the opponent could just keep running while low and not get punished.   Also having a soft out to Pyroar, Safeguard, Aegislash, trev lock etc is important for some decks to not deal with them. Even some mega decks you can just play snipe the support poke because of lysandre cause some decks really can't deal with Koing 2 220+ hp Pokes. And even in catcherless/lysandreless worlds we still have access to force switch effects: E Rope, Ninetails bright look based off a format dominating luxray of the past, Genesect red signal and prob a couple more in the format and older ones."
ptcgo,3e6txu,MaddixMochi,2,Wed Jul 22 13:48:08 2015 UTC,"of course not! it's a staple, and since the beginning of the game there has always been card like Lysandre, but with different names for it like Gust of Wind or Pokemon Catcher..."
ptcgo,3e6txu,0023XX,2,Wed Jul 22 12:18:50 2015 UTC,"No it doesnt break a win condition, the pokemon tcg doesnt ban cards because they're op, they're banned like trump card because they completley remove a win condition.  Only a couple of cards have ever been flat out banned from play."
ptcgo,3e6txu,Rayiara,1 point,Wed Jul 22 12:26:51 2015 UTC,"No. It's a supporter. If you use Lysandre, you get the excellent effect, but you trade the ability to use a different supporter. Just because a card is effective in most decks doesn't make it overpowered."
ptcgo,3e6txu,mrogersj5,1 point,Wed Jul 22 12:19:22 2015 UTC,as mentioned not only does it take up your supporter for that turn but also up to 4 slots of supporters that could be used for many other things. I would not say it is op  as there are other cards which could easily change the outcome as well such as umm N for instance.
ptcgo,3e6txu,monsters2343,1 point,Wed Jul 22 12:26:32 2015 UTC,No it would not. The reason trump card was banned was it removed a win condition from the game. Card bans are Very rare. You could not count the amount of cards banned on your hands in 20 years of the game.
ptcgo,3e6txu,cellojake,1 point,Wed Jul 22 13:18:33 2015 UTC,"I personally think it's op since you can use it in literally every deck to fuck up your opponent, but ptcg doens't usually ban cards so probably no"
ptcgo,3e6txu,flyingepeto,1 point,Wed Jul 22 13:20:01 2015 UTC,"I personally think it's op since you can use it in literally every deck to fuck up your opponent   And they can use it in every deck to eff you up. Gust of Wind Trainer Cards has never been this balanced since Base Set, because so many years ago, the same effect was on an item, so you can pull something out and still Juniper."
ptcgo,3e6txu,Rakkis157,1 point,Wed Jul 22 13:52:10 2015 UTC,"and i think gust of wind was op aswell,and you just added to my point that you should run lysandre because your opponent is gonna run lysandre, there's not a reason not to, it wins so many games on it's own, way more than any other card, that's why i think it's op"
ptcgo,3e6txu,flyingepeto,1 point,Wed Jul 22 14:00:43 2015 UTC,"it wins so many games on it's own, way more than any other card, that's why i think it's op   Honestly, I would attribute this to purpose rather than OPness, because that is the point of that card; promoting a pokemon active and in clutch situations, letting you win the game. It is like saying that Professor Juniper is OP because it lets you draw through your deck quickly (which, by the standards of other TCGs, it bloody is). The question is to what degree.   Game winning, on its own is not a sign of OPness, because by that logic Shaymin EX (The Grass one) is OP due to it being able to flip the tables. The question is what conditions must be present for a card to win a game, and what drawbacks would spawn from the improper use of it. Gust of Wind lacked the latter, but Lysandre very much does. It requires you to burn your Supporter per turn for it, which forces you to use it and not draw cards, or forgo it completely. This alone already makes it fairly hard to play which is in my opinion enough of a balancing factor for the effect."
ptcgo,3e6txu,Rakkis157,1 point,Wed Jul 22 15:39:32 2015 UTC,"Being able to not only control your side of the field but have a way to control your opponents side also makes the game extremely diverse.  If your opponent couldnt do the same that would be means for your post but both have the same cards available. Using lysandre comes at a cost as does every card. Being an item, yes thats over powered because in turn you cam play a supporter. Now having it as a supporter makes it less op tbh.  I wouldnt want to play a game where you can only play your sude of things and then just wait for your next turn with no thought or interaction towards your opponent.  You should go back to playing checkers cause even that has the basics of opponent manipulation if you play proper rules!"

ptcgo,3e6txu,sodamnhappy,1 point,Wed Jul 22 14:35:53 2015 UTC,"Since it's a supporter, using it means you cannot use another supporter for that turn. So, you have to make it count.  Without it, it can be very difficult to deal with things Garbodor on the other player's bench stop all pokemon powers. It helps keep the pressure in the game."

ptcgo,3e5dtv,DoctorMaye,2,Wed Jul 22 02:16:29 2015 UTC,Yep pure F2P. You can earn everything in the game for free minus Gem stuff but even then you can trade in game packs/cards for them.
ptcgo,3e5dtv,MaddixMochi,1 point,Wed Jul 22 02:22:59 2015 UTC,wow you can trade cards in this thats pretty sick
ptcgo,3e5dtv,MaddixMochi,3,Wed Jul 22 02:37:34 2015 UTC,"Basically tourney is like your arena. You enter queue with either tourney tickets or tokens. Token Queue gets you tickets depending on how well you place and Ticket Queue gets you tradable boosters of the most recent set + 1 random one depending on how well you place. If your good enough and decently lucky with draw in theme tourney you should be able to get 2nd place at worse most of the time. For the constructed queues usually theres enough mix of beginner and advanced players that a ""meta"" deck should get you pretty far each queue.  There is no cap to how many tokens/tickets you grind a day unlike HS's 100 g cap only time.   Most beginners grind tokens to 500 buy a theme deck and start playing in theme deck mode. There you can get tickets for tourneys and tokens for untradable 5 card packs/bundles. Theme decks are all preconstructed with Dark hammer being the general favourite due to consistancy and card quality. You still lose to RNG and stuff it's just the most consistant.   When you start getting a bunch of packs you should trade them rather than opening them since the Estimated value in most packs isn't high enough minus getting lucky. Then in public trades you can trade the pack(s) for cards you want for the standard (B/C soon to be XY onward) or Expanded decks. Or you can spend like 30-50 dollars on a stack of codes and trade for a bunch of high tier standard/expanded decks and skip the work."

ptcgo,3e5dtv,Darkroronoa,2,Wed Jul 22 15:00:13 2015 UTC,You can buy gems (in Canada) and tournament tickets but it's a horrible deal for what you are getting. Buying code cards is a way better deal because you can get one tournament ticket per dollar (10 for 9.99 but pretty much 1 per dollar) and you need 4 to enter a Tournament where you can win max 3 packs so each pack is worth $0.75 whereas if you buy code cards online you can get one code card for $0.20-$0.30 (depending on the set and the deal). So I wouldn't spend money directly on the game but if you want more packs buy code cards (I haven't done either because I'm super cheap like most people and just play for free) but it's not a bad idea if you have the extra cash.
ptcgo,3e5dtv,MaddixMochi,1 point,Wed Jul 22 02:41:57 2015 UTC,"If you buy pack codes how much you should spent to build a budget deck? With a search i saw you can get 30 packs with a 10$, will that give you enough common/uncommons and rares to build something nd trade? Also, expansions are every 3 months? Is it possible to gather enough booster packs with tokens to build a decent deck or expand one you own? the game looks cool, i hate the rng of the coins but overall a decent deck looks like can be quite consistent."
ptcgo,3e5dtv,forgotthepassworddoh,1 point,Wed Jul 22 10:59:51 2015 UTC,"Trainers and items in general will be 0.33-0.5 packs per and you only need about 30ish in your deck and a lot of them are from your default decks like Sycamore/Juniper, Switch, ultra ball, muscle band. You can spend tokens on packs if your still looking for important playsets of some uncommons but don't expect to get 3 of some EX you want unless u buy tons.  Most decks can get away with basic energies and DCE and only a couple need specific special energies that again are pretty cheap minus Strong Energy maybe.   Then for Pokemon usually the most expensive piece of any deck will be 8 packs at most (looking at Shaymin, Virizion, Landorus) and most pokes are actually more bulk leaning towards the 2-4 pack range. There are some decks where all the pokemon are 2 or less packs in price.  Once you build a core of trainers and energy you should only need to get pokemon when trying to build a new deck. And all you need is one good standard/expanded deck and the rest you can just grind boosters in tourney queue and trade them for new set goodies. And yah new sets I don't keep track but probably around 3 months."
ptcgo,3e5dtv,flyingepeto,1 point,Wed Jul 22 14:42:25 2015 UTC,"I've played maybe 3 months put together and I haven't spent a dime yet have thousands of cards. Heck, since RoS started I've pulled 3 FA shaymin-EXs and 4 regular shaymin EXs, and a ton of other EXs as well as pretty much all staple trainers.  If you spend money you just get cards faster, no difference in between cards."
ptcgo,3e5gb9,PapiDimmi,1 point,Wed Jul 22 02:36:49 2015 UTC,Lysandre's Trump Card is legal in the Unlimited format.  The red X is just a glitch.
ptcgo,3e5gb9,trivialremote,0,Wed Jul 22 02:39:06 2015 UTC,"I always thought the red X was apart of the card, but then I started noticing that it sort of.. lifted off the card itself, I guess.  I wouldn't think that would be too hard to fix. Wait.. why is there a red X on the card in the first place? Can't they put a message when it's illegal? Why isn't there a red X on cards such as Battle City, Team Rocket's Trickery, et cetera?  I might have equal IQ as a two year old goat, so can someone please explain?"
ptcgo,3e5gb9,scenia,1 point,Wed Jul 22 03:45:26 2015 UTC,"Those cards aren't banned. LTC is, going by its set, legal in all formats, but there's a special rule in effect that makes it illegal except in Unlimited and the big red X notifies you about this fact. This also applies to First Ticket and to temporarily banned cards (like the Slowking that was temporarily banned due to a bug recently)."
ptcgo,3e5gb9,Flawless_Ruby,1 point,Wed Jul 22 08:12:50 2015 UTC,You also can't test an unlimited deck that contain a Lysandre's Trump Card since the game think there's an invalid card in the deck.

ptcgo,3e29em,cellojake,3,Tue Jul 21 15:20:15 2015 UTC,"Landorus EX is just one of many EX that has already seen a massive drop in value on PTCGO, a card that was valued at around 17 packs before you can get for a mere 8 RS now on public trades. I doubt the value will drop much more than that. A lot of people also will still want to play decks in expanded, especially now considering the new XY only Standard is quite limited in terms of cards still."

ptcgo,3e29em,Rakkis157,2,Tue Jul 21 15:51:09 2015 UTC,"And if pokemon wants it to become like MTG modern stuff like comp searchs, lasers, floats seem like juicy pick ups/keeps. And expanded stuff online like eels and dark patch have kept their deck prices pretty high and stable. Fa Dragon Rays are still worth about the same as a typical high played EX like manectric, yveltal, toad, C ray etc. I expect Lando FA to fit into this price range maybe a bit higher at 10ish eventually. No reprint in a tin might make regs stay highish if people like it enough in expanded. I feel a fair amount of people will be holding on to their playsets for expanded testing and stuff. Still gonna drop a bit probably.  I'm personally keeping my landos because landorus bats was one of the funnest decks to me and theres always decks to bully in expanded. Not really gonna lose too much holding them since I get play value out of them too."
ptcgo,3e29em,MaddixMochi,2,Tue Jul 21 16:28:44 2015 UTC,I agree with r1ggles and would add that prices may drop a little more as we get closer to rotation and the release of ancient origins. Cards that are going to get rotated will be very inexpensive with AOR packs right when they release. Just my opinion though
ptcgo,3e29em,atisakson,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:11:42 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the answers so far. According to your answers it's probably safe to assume that a card like Lando EX will not drop below something like 5 packs, so I'm probably gonna try to find some for 7-8 packs, bc I'd really like to try a fighting deck until the rotation :)"
ptcgo,3e29em,MaddixMochi,2,Tue Jul 21 15:38:30 2015 UTC,Try trading 7-8 packs for a shaymin and trading the shaymin into a reg art lando that should work if ur not having luck directly trading into em :p.

As for as I know: Theme decks redeemed from real-life codes are trade locked once you open the Theme deck (so you can trade the unopened Theme Deck box + contents, but you cannot trade it once you open it)."
ptcgo,3e1d6o,The_Filthy_Goat,2,Tue Jul 21 05:36:06 2015 UTC,"Unless there's a way I'm not aware of, Theme decks cannot be traded even unopened. It was possible a few years back, but for quite a while now, they're hidden in the trade view. Source: I have a tradable unopened Furious Knights and have been trying to trade it for a long time since I also have an opened one..."

ptcgo,3e1d6o,Samhayne_TCGO,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:46:55 2015 UTC,"I've bought a real life dark hammer deck and redeemed it in game and opened it, and the cards from it are not trade locked. So I'm curious what will happen to my theme deck if I trade some of them."
ptcgo,3e1d6o,Flawless_Ruby,3,Tue Jul 21 05:49:22 2015 UTC,"I can't find it, but I remember u/Samhayne_TCGO saying that theme decks can't be made unplayable by trading the cards. If you trade them, they show up in your collection anymore, but the theme deck will still be complete."
ptcgo,3e1d6o,scenia,2,Tue Jul 21 10:47:24 2015 UTC,That's correct.  The cards themselves are separate from the ability to play in Theme Deck Mode.  This is part of the reason that Theme Decks as a whole are not tradeable (the cards themselves are tradeable).  Hopefully that makes sense :)

ptcgo,3dwwqt,21jiggawatts,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:18:45 2015 UTC,so i just started playing a few weeks ago.  my decks are not very strong. (only 1 EX card in my 'best' deck).  is it worth it for me to play in this tourney or am I just going to get stomped on?
ptcgo,3dwwqt,Bobbybunn,4,Mon Jul 20 16:03:41 2015 UTC,It's free! Why not?
ptcgo,3dwwqt,fmardini87,2,Mon Jul 20 17:02:38 2015 UTC,"this tourney is based on standard but the one before was without EXs, and it could be a good experience for you to see how other players play"

ptcgo,3e0o9f,funny-original-name,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:54:59 2015 UTC,Looking at it just now I see I was wrong. My basic Red and Blue are available in VS. but not my basic Green. And my red and blue decks have a win count that shows it doesn't matter. My basic Green deck doesn't show up anywhere but in the trainer challenge.
ptcgo,3dz4j0,enochism,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:32:09 2015 UTC,"You could consider running with Pokemon Fan Club if the focus is to get up an early Malamar-ex since you can grab -ex pokemon with it. Also, maybe a Jirachi-ex to get a guaranteed early supporter or a shaymin-ex"
ptcgo,3dz4j0,KamikazeNapkin,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:04:07 2015 UTC,"Interesting idea but I wouldn't rely too heavily on coin flips, the other issue is that once Malamar gets knocked out you have to attach energy all over again to a new attacker.  If you are relying on supporters to get Malamar out there then I would scrap colress as he is useless at the beginning of the game. I would add more N and a couple Junipers/Sycamore.  Possibly consider adding either a Victini or Trick Coin to help get more consistent coin flips."
ptcgo,3dzxkb,kilojoule_kj,2,Mon Jul 20 21:58:32 2015 UTC,"When you say you only receive one, do you mean it only gives you the one option or you only get the chance to complete one? You can only ever choose one challenge a day, leveling up just gives you options every day and allows you to carry them over if you don't finish within a day."
ptcgo,3dzxkb,ELB95,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:43:09 2015 UTC,oh i tought i would have two to be able to do
ptcgo,3dzxkb,New_Redit_User,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:24:09 2015 UTC,"There used to be a glitch that allowed you to select up to 3 missions per day. Unfortunately, they seem to have removed it in the latest update.  Now, you can only select one challenge per day. However, the higher your level, the more selection you'll have. You are also able keep your challenge from the previous day, if you hadn't finished it, and select a new one. This way, you can have up to 3 active challenges at a time."
ptcgo,3dzkbs,emp_Waifu_mugen,2,Mon Jul 20 20:24:33 2015 UTC,Wailord is losing a lot of trainers when rotation comes and grass pokes will get a bit more popular so you might wanna hold of a week or two to see if the deck is still viable post rotation unless your goal is expanded.

ptcgo,3dzkbs,monsters2343,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:23:48 2015 UTC,"I've played a few tournaments with wailord.  I definitely had problems timing out at first.  Now I just realize I have to play fast right from the beginning and can't spend a lot of time thinking about complex moves.  So basically, if I spend more than a few seconds without doing anything, I remind myself to end my turn and I can keep thinking while my opponent makes his moves.  The time limit still is a factor but remember, it's as big an issue for your opponent as it is for you.  Actually, once you remember you're playing wailord, time becomes a much bigger problem for your opponent. Also, I have had several people just quit as soon as they see me open with the double wailord.  One time, my opponent quit in the finals during my first turn. Oh, and I ran into a flygon/dusknoir deck, which was an interesting matchup to say the least."
ptcgo,3dzkbs,sodamnhappy,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:49:55 2015 UTC,I agree with his comments. I don't time out. My opponent does.   It's a fun deck to play because of the complex strategies that can be invoked. I would practice with it in VS mode so you have a good feel and then take it into tourneys.
ptcgo,3dwzcb,funny-original-name,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:51:45 2015 UTC,"Thanks, really helped me out with daily missions"
