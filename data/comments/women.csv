women,3e5t8g,kgulrich,1 point,Wed Jul 22 05:47:06 2015 UTC,"Posting pictures isn't fat shaming unless they're a picture of a specific person with arrows and words that indicate/state the person in the photo is fat AND that by being fat they should be ashamed of themselves.    A picture of a thin person isn't fat shaming.   A picture of an average size person isn't fat shaming.   A picture of a fat person isn't fat shaming.   A picture of a thin person that states ""this person is thin"" isn't fat shaming.   A picture of an average person stating ""this person is average-sized"" isn't fat shaming.   A picture of a fat person stating ""this person is fat"" is also not fat shaming.  If someone is offended by any of the above situations, it's their fault. If someone sees a picture unrelated to them as a personal attack on their self-worth, that person needs to re-evaluate their self worth and find outlets that help them love themselves that don't include projecting on others.   No one with healthy self esteem attacks others for posting pictures of any body type."

There are the women assholes, who think that because they went through hell that they should treat women under them terribly. They are awful, terrible human beings. Not every woman is this way, but a percentage are. There are male assholes that will just use anything they can against you. You should wear make up, be less emotional, oh it is shocking how smart you are given you are a woman...stuff like that is pretty common.   The other issue I have had is that people expect me to be nice and friendly and chipper all the time. My male counterparts can be who they are, but I need to be charming, well put together, and most importantly it makes them uncomfortable that I am single. A female being single, who couldn't care less about settling down, is really offensive to some people for whatever reason. Granted, I am in a small town. I have a male colleague who is similar to me, but they just love him. When he has a bad day and is snappy or he is sarcastic, oh how charming. But me? God forbid I even think of being less than a smiley, chipper, warm, person.   So I guess I have run into quite a few problems."
women,3dyn4m,safescience,2,Tue Jul 21 02:49:20 2015 UTC,"As a lung doc who trained in the 90s, I had very few women ahead of me to serve as mentors.  Maybe 90:10 ratio for the pulm - critical care faculty where I trained (and it had not been much better in med school itself as far as faculty).    There was definitely a ""fit in or else"" feel.  The most overt discrimination related to pregnancy - I had a baby my last year of med school and the advice around pregnancy accommodations was pretty crappy.  I ended up just taking a full year off right after as I was told even ASKING about this type of thing might jeopardize my future chances of matching for residency at the competetive program I was interested in.  Basically shhh let's pretend you didn't ask that and don't ask it of others.    A friend who ended up chief resident later at that program was told she was not allowed to get pregnant.  Lol.  That was 2000 (her chief year) and my guess is no one would say that out loud now - but they would still think it.  The gender ratio is changing pretty fast  - I had quite a lot of women in my class in med school (40%), and about 25 percent during my specialty training (pulm-cc)  And then even more since then in training - allowing many more women amongst our junior faculty.  As I think about it - I guess I'm actually the oldest woman in my division (early 40s) and therr is only one woman even close to me in age  - vs about 8 older guys and another 4 close to me in age.  I don't notice it day to day much, but I do still find that there are very few women serving in leadership roles or making it just to the regular highest rank of ""full professor"".  And if I get asked to be on a fancy committee it will probably by 80:20 or worse.   Partly we women tend to not work full time some of the time - and partly other factors such as lack of encouragement, lack of mentors, discrimination to some extent etc."

My old work had a small team, so pregnancy was a thing that disrupted us quite a bit. But that never stopped anyone from having babies. It just meant that when someone got pregnant we knew our boss would be stressed out.  My new job is much better in that regard. Big team, so pregnancies are no big deal.  Aside from pregnancies I have not once came to a point where being female has stopped me achieving anything beyond some heavily lifting.

If you really love someone, you don't call them a carcass.  If she loved you, really loved you, she wouldn't have said the things that she said to you.  You will love and lose a lot of people before you find the one for you.  It's not a Win/Lose experience; it's a Win/Learn experience.  Each time you love and lose, it hurts but you learn more about who you are and who you want to be with.  You have to learn to let go and accept that this wasn't the one.  If you were to harm her, then her life is over and so it yours.  Would that really be worth it?  Yeah, you showed her by destroying both your lives.  The best revenge is to go on, straighten your shit out, learn how to be an awesome partner and find an awesome partner who loves you the same way.  That really will hurt her.    You do need therapy, if you can find it for sure.  Anger management therapy should be a priority.  Learn how to control yourself, how to control what you say and how you react to a situation.  You need to find a better way to handle situations like this one because it's going to happen more than once.  Things like this happen to all of us.    Buddhism really helped me with anger issues.  Try listening to ""Don't Bite the Hook"" by Pema Chodron.  She has lots of other audio and E-books etc.  that are amazingly helpful.  They really preach the art of letting go.  Lots of Buddhism sources online as well.  It's not a religion, it's a philosophy on how to live life and not suffer.  Your anger causes you to suffer.  Let it go and move forward with your life.    Please don't ruin her life and yours.  There are so many beautiful places and people in the world, that you haven't seen yet.  So many things to experience that will bring you joy.  Don't let your hatred for one person ruin all of that for you and the people who love you."

This kind of relationship is normally prohibited by companies because it can cause all sorts of problems. If you did decide to go forward and ask her out, I suggest you first invite her to lunch with other colleagues. If she repeatedly turns this down, she's probably not interested. If that goes well, just straight up ask her out for coffee or lunch together. This is low-key, casual. If she says no, you choose to make it awkward, in my opinion. If you feel like you can't continue to be professional and treat her the exact same at work regardless of what happens, you shouldn't ask her out."

She knows you are interested, trust me, people do this, they file you away under ""yeah they're keen"" and if they feel like it later because circumstances have changed, they will take you up on it. If they don't then you can take it as read that they're not, they won't feel uncomfortable asking you at a later date because they already know they won't be rejected.  Do work relationships work, sometimes, but that's not why you don't have them, you don't have them because if they turn to custard you still have to work with this person.  Me personally, I would join a hobby club or a sports club or dance class or some kind of special interest group, for two reasons, it's a relaxed environment which is not specifically for dating so nobody is nervous or stressed, and you already know the people you meet there share an interest with you.   It's more natural and if you don't meet someone you don't feel like your time has been wasted or that you've failed, because you already enjoy the pastime.   Lastly if I was just going with gut feeling, nothing you have said leads me to think ""he should go for it"", all I can hear is alarm bells."

I do like the feeling of not wearing a bra if I'm just going for a stroll or sitting around the house though, it's nice.

So the limit is intended to balance those issues against the severity of a crime, and the public interest in prosecuting the perpetrator.

I won't go out telling people that they shouldn't say that, but I know that there's absolutely no reason anymore to stereotype like that.  We're getting into an age where the mind is by far the most important tool. And that means that actual differences between the genders, like muscles, are almost completely unimportant. With that, men don't have to be those who earn the money and therefore also the ones who decide things anymore. It can just as well be the partner who does that, which means that with every new generation, there is a growing number of boys, who can very validly opt for being the supportive role in the relationship. And then they neither need to employ the traditional boy-behaviour at all.  This also means that same-sex relationships become more and more feasible, which should also already increase in frequency due to more and more weight being put on the mental aspect of relationships (love)."

As the youngest person in my workplace by 10+ years, I get dismissive comments about my age all the time (and I'm NOT even that young, but almost everybody who works here is old, like near-retirement old, so to them, I'll be ""young"" until I'm 40). When I try to negotiate a raise, regardless of my consistently excellent performance reviews, I'm told I don't ""need"" it because I am young. I get work passed on to me constantly by people I don't even work with, because of the assumption that I can't be busy, because I'm young and therefore perpetually low on the ladder (never mind my lazy supervisor who never does her own work - she passes her shit on me for other reasons, at least).   It seems minor and if you've never been on the wrong side of it, you'd think it an exaggeration. But it literally affects the money I make and the work I do.

I took ibuprofen in the morning, and took as much as I was supposed to according to the bottle for the next 2 days, per the doctor's recommendations.  For the insertion, I have a very sensitive cervix, so the doctor numbed me, I think with Novacaine, in order to get me to not jump around. It wasn't painful, just a little uncomfortable.   You will spot for a few days afterwards, not badly. DO expect your mens. cycle to be more heavy than you are used to for a few months. I got mine in March, and the cycle is still heavier and longer than I'm used to. My first two cycles post-insertion were more painful than normal, but ibuprofen (not aspirin) is a non-inflammatory and is your best friend.  No regrets for me."
women,3dhaao,aww0110,1 point,Thu Jul 16 09:13:44 2015 UTC,"I chose hormonal because I had read that the non-hormonal IUD made your periods worse. I also read that most women with the hormonal IUD no longer get their period (ahhh, to be confident when wearing white).   Unfortunately, my period is a persistent little prick. So I still get it, but it is extremely light. I only need pantyliners (no pads, no tampons).   It's painful if you haven't had children (which is the case for me). Getting past your cervix is more difficult because it's less flexible and the hole is typically smaller. It did hurt a lot the first day, but it wasn't unbearable. I just went home, had some wine, and slept. I felt much better by the next day.   I have no regrets. I love my IUD. I tell everyone about it. Sometimes, my sharing is inappropriate, but it was nice to find something that works. I also used to take the pill, but I forgot to take it all the time.   I would suggest going with an SO (my SO is super supportive of my vagina's well being), planning a ""reward"" for yourself afterwards (maybe a reward that will be at home waiting for you -- you probably won't feel like walking around afterwards), or, if need be, having a little alcohol or weed. I want to stress the word ""little"". Too much and the doctor might decide that you're not able to consent to your decision, something could go wrong and you're not in the right mind, or your blood might thin too much from the alcohol. So, an amount that would ""take the edge off"", which is 1.5 beers for me."

women,3dhaao,kissmyankle,1 point,Thu Jul 16 12:29:27 2015 UTC,"I'm a seriously old lady whose childbearing years were years ago, but I'll tell you about my experience. In those days (the 70's) there were only two types available to us but I chose an IUD because I needed a break from the pill and wanted something I could depend on.   Insertion was a little uncomfortable - about like a short-lived cramp, but not that hard to take. The discomfort that does occur is due to the small amount of dilation that's necessary to put the IUD in place. I wore it for a couple of years before having it removed, and never noted any particular increase in discomfort during my periods.  As for going to an OBGYN, you should know that the ones I've encountered during my life were among the best physicians I have known. Most are real experts at helping new patients calm down. Just let her/him know you're a little uneasy. The doctor who delivered my last child even asked my advice on the travel posters he attached to the ceiling above the exam table. He was also the first one I'd known (remember how long ago this was) who used a heating pad as a warmer for his speculums.  Reading up a little bit on deep breathing exercises as they relate to self hypnosis would also be helpful. You'll be fine."
women,3dh1z2,jphman1234,3,Thu Jul 16 05:24:15 2015 UTC,"As a lady ma'am myself, I'd say there are two kinds of attraction, physical and mental. Mental meaning what is ""attractive"" to said woman in our minds ie. what he's wearing, how he smells, how he does his hair, or even how he walks, can all be ""attractive"", if that makes sense. Physical is pretty explanatory; how tall or short, smile, eyes etc.  Personally (28f), I find smile creases attractive. I have a thing for backs. I like when I can see the shape of a guys back through his shirt. An odd thing, but I noticed this the older I got. Most importantly, how appropriate he is (polite and empathetic). If you're a complete bag of dicks, you'll get nowhere or a shattered woman to match.  I also find humor important.

I like men who are funny, but not in a mean way, I have a thing for well-defined arms and good listeners.  The truth is, though, is that it's going to be impossible, or nearly impossible, to nail down a list of traits that every or even most women find attractive. Everybody is different. I think one of the best things you can do is try and be a person that you're happy with, and the confidence and happiness that come with that can go a long way in attracting women."

That's one of the most important things to me is not worrying about facing criticism and being supported. I like maturity but it's important that you aren't a dick about it, ya know? like if I tell you I love to watch Steven Universe, Don't act like you're too grown up and can't enjoy things.  Physically, I'm okay with most men. I usually find myself attracted to nice hair and a warm smile. You can tell a lot based on someones smile.

But this whole ""I'm gonna rock it anyway"" shit has to stop. This is all yet another reason why fat shaming is more popular than ever these days. People who give a shit about their health, their appearance, and have a sense of style are the ones who deserve respect. It's something that is earned. Enough with this female entitlement and health at every size crap. It's absurd."

women,3cod5s,dissaver,3,Thu Jul 9 15:50:39 2015 UTC,"20-35% increases in yearly premium   This is what I've noticed too. Several friends were floored by how much their insurance coverage went up, and they were even getting less coverage. Another person I know couldn't afford health insurance even before the act, then got fined for not having health insurance. From what I understand, it was a hefty fine."
women,3cod5s,HazMat68W,2,Thu Jul 9 17:07:10 2015 UTC,you need to shop around. premiums typically go up year over year but increases have slowed. it's worse if you don't shop around.
women,3cod5s,xian,3,Fri Jul 10 04:50:26 2015 UTC,"It's such bullshit that premiums have done this. With more people paying premiums, you'd think that there was more money in the pot, even with birth control pills being covered. It sounds like it's just a farce cooked up by insurance companies to jack up prices however they can. Ugh."
women,3cod5s,RampagingKittens,2,Thu Jul 9 23:08:20 2015 UTC,"This is what happens when competition is restricted across state lines, thus reducing the pool of insured people and spreading the cost amongst a smaller and constrained group."
women,3cod5s,dissaver,2,Thu Jul 9 23:16:43 2015 UTC,Was it not like that before the ACA?
women,3cod5s,RampagingKittens,2,Fri Jul 10 00:05:56 2015 UTC,It was. It seems that the ACA has caused insurers to offset the cost of having to cover things they didn't have to before and people they didn't have to before with higher rates across the board.
women,3cod5s,dissaver,4,Fri Jul 10 00:09:26 2015 UTC,Breast pumps are also covered. But I have heard complaints from friends saying they could barely afford the insurance (in VA...so I guess northern VA jacks up the overall state cost). I need a pro's and con's list...unbiased.
women,3cod5s,HazMat68W,3,Thu Jul 9 17:05:25 2015 UTC,"Oh please. Yeah, two years ago I was paying $40/month for birth control. Now i'm paying $0 for birth control, but $430 for health insurance. Kind of feels a whole lot like now i'm paying $390 for birth control, since that's the ONLY use it has been to me. If I had a choice (which I do not) I would go back to the $40/month."
women,3cod5s,snickertwinkle,2,Thu Jul 9 19:15:20 2015 UTC,"But the problem is that, in a sense, the birth control costs much more. Premiums are so much higher now that the net effect is that you're paying more. It really didn't solve the problem as much as everyone hoped it would."
women,3cod5s,RainingRabbits,3,Thu Jul 9 22:35:14 2015 UTC,"Pre health care reform, my name brand birth control was only $10-25. Post health care reform, my name brand birth control is no longer covered and costs about $75. The only option for free prescriptions are generic brands. I've been on generic for 10 months and have never had more problems with hormone reactions. I've realized it's worth spending the money."

You can bulk-buy cloth pads from china for ~$2 a pad at the 100+ pad volume, and even cloth pads made in the US (which thinx are not) are way cheaper.   A ""luxury"" item doesn't seem to be a good solution here at all. Organizations like days for girls already are looking for volunteers who can transport their actually well thought out and appropriate cloth pad and panty kits, but even if you don't want to partner with an organization, giving girls one single period panty that's hugely more expensive than cloth pads seems a waste of money and resources."

We chose Thinx because they provide a cloth pad to a girl in Uganda for every pair of panties that is purchased, so our project will be benefitting girls in both Ghana and Uganda. Also a luxury product like Thinx has broad appeal and has helped to inspire donations that we otherwise wouldn't have received. People like to give nice things, and girls in Ghana will be thrilled to have something more than a bare minimum solution. However, we were unaware of projects that are already trying to bring cloth pads, and we should have done more research. It is important to benefit as many girls as possible. We will do our best to work with Days for Girls, and also look into other organizations that might be able to work with us in a shorter timeframe. In the mean time, our project with Thinx will go forward because that is what people have donated to.  Links to the funding page have been blocked here.

I'm so much more comfortable with how my lady parts look now. Sure, I think it's ridiculous that I or anyone else feels like they need to hack off parts of their vagina to feel more confident in the bedroom, but that's reality. Porn and the media give us a manipulated sense of ""beauty"". I'm very pro cosmetic surgery and think if it will make you feel better, it's worth it.  Post surgery it felt like I didn't even have anything done. I didn't have any issues wearing jeans or tight clothing right away. I had mild soreness for a few weeks and the only time there was actual pain was when I was touching/wiping that area. If I wasn't touching that area, I didn't feel anything. There was no discomfort in performing my regular routine actives or while lounging around the house.  I had a minor infection about 2 weeks after surgery because I was having my period while I was in my first week of recovery which I believe was a result of bad timing. If you can, try to schedule the surgery to where you won't be getting your period for another 2-3 weeks post surgery.  Other than that, it healed up completely after about 6 weeks. All swelling went down and there was no scaring. It looks like nothing ever happened down there. My gynecologist mentions to me how amazed she is by my surgeon's work every time I see her haha. If you happen to be in or near Houston, PM and I'd gladly give you his info. He's an amazing doctor and even though I don't plan to have any more future cosmetic work done, there is nobody else I'd consider if I were to ever change my mind.  Edit: I should add that my tolerance for pain is low. I don't even like getting shots or blood drawn. Labiaplasty recovery is a breeze and hurt even less than recovering from my oral surgery when my wisdom teeth were removed."

women,3cb54v,ZombievsUnicorn,3,Mon Jul 6 15:12:49 2015 UTC,"Usually with any UTI's, the first thing anyone will ask you if how you wipe. You want to go front to back so that you are wiping any bacteria that comes from your anus or vagina away from your urethra.  I would think that the IUD shouldn't have any effect on the UTI's unless it wasn't sterile when it was put in (it should be). Talk to your Dr. and see if she recommends taking it out or replacing it."
women,3cb54v,Vana21,3,Mon Jul 6 18:55:35 2015 UTC,"Go to the doctor and give a urine sample, make sure it's a UTI vrs a yeast infection. To try and clear this one up, drink lots of water (not pop or juice, water). Wear cotton underwear, and when you wipe do so front to back. If you do it backwards you're pulling bacteria from your rectum/vagina to your urethra. Also, while this may not be an issue having just finished your period, pee after sex. All that bumping and grinding can also pull the vaginal bacteria to the urethra. Avoid sex until this is cleared up for the same reason. You can also try cranberry capsules. There's a theory that something in the cranberry makes it hard for the bacteria to stick to the walls of the urinary tract. Honestly, I recommend an antibiotic if you can't clear it in a day or so. Bacteria in the bladder can travel to the kidneys and cause pyelonephritis (inflammation and infection in the kidneys). I would also speak with the physician who placed the UTI and see if they have any suggestions."

women,3c6svh,ehImCanadian,-2,Mon Jul 6 05:49:02 2015 UTC,"MYTH: Women earn 77 cents for every dollar a man earns—for doing the same work.  FACTS: No matter how many times this wage gap claim is decisively refuted by economists, it always comes back. The bottom line: the 23-cent gender pay gap is simply the difference between the average earnings of all men and women working full-time. It does not account for differences in occupations, positions, education, job tenure or hours worked per week. When such relevant factors are considered, the wage gap narrows to the point of vanishing.  Wage gap activists say women with identical backgrounds and jobs as men still earn less. But they always fail to take into account critical variables. Activist groups like the National Organization for Women have a fallback position: that women’s education and career choices are not truly free—they are driven by powerful sexist stereotypes. In this view, women’s tendency to retreat from the workplace to raise children or to enter fields like early childhood education and psychology, rather than better paying professions like petroleum engineering, is evidence of continued social coercion. Here is the problem: American women are among the best informed and most self-determining human beings in the world. To say that they are manipulated into their life choices by forces beyond their control is divorced from reality and demeaning, to boot."

By itself it's not specifically diagnostic of much, but my understanding is that, if a clinician finds any unexplained features of behavior, cognition, speech, etc. then knowing that a person was born via C-section provides a hint of a hypothesis--that is, if a C-section was done, that often means there were scary or dangerous things happening, biologically, right at the end of the pregnancy, and those things could have been caused by something developmentally not-optimal with the child, could have been traumatizing to brain growth, or both the C-section and any developmental anomalies might both come from the same set of causes.  It's for similar reasons that many clinical intake forms have your handedness as a question; because being left-handed can (IIRC) be an indicator of developmental difficulty (e.g., genetic or in-utero).  So it's not utterly bizarre, but I don't know what a kindergarten teacher would do with the information, unless he or she was doing some kind of full-spectrum diagnosis process and was putting this information together with lots of other bits about the kids."

women,3bjr53,devonflinn,4,Mon Jun 29 20:05:02 2015 UTC,"“Men always say that as the defining compliment, don’t they? She’s a cool girl. Being the Cool Girl means I am a hot, brilliant, funny woman who adores football, poker, dirty jokes, and burping, who plays video games, drinks cheap beer, loves threesomes and anal sex, and jams hot dogs and hamburgers into her mouth like she’s hosting the world’s biggest culinary gang bang while somehow maintaining a size 2, because Cool Girls are above all hot. Hot and understanding. Cool Girls never get angry; they only smile in a chagrined, loving manner and let their men do whatever they want. Go ahead, shit on me, I don’t mind, I’m the Cool Girl.  Men actually think this girl exists. Maybe they’re fooled because so many women are willing to pretend to be this girl. For a long time Cool Girl offended me. I used to see men – friends, coworkers, strangers – giddy over these awful pretender women, and I’d want to sit these men down and calmly say: You are not dating a woman, you are dating a woman who has watched too many movies written by socially awkward men who’d like to believe that this kind of woman exists and might kiss them. I’d want to grab the poor guy by his lapels or messenger bag and say: The bitch doesn’t really love chili dogs that much – no one loves chili dogs that much! And the Cool Girls are even more pathetic: They’re not even pretending to be the woman they want to be, they’re pretending to be the woman a man wants them to be. Oh, and if you’re not a Cool Girl, I beg you not to believe that your man doesn’t want the Cool Girl. It may be a slightly different version – maybe he’s a vegetarian, so Cool Girl loves seitan and is great with dogs; or maybe he’s a hipster artist, so Cool Girl is a tattooed, bespectacled nerd who loves comics. There are variations to the window dressing, but believe me, he wants Cool Girl, who is basically the girl who likes every fucking thing he likes and doesn’t ever complain. (How do you know you’re not Cool Girl? Because he says things like: “I like strong women.” If he says that to you, he will at some point fuck someone else. Because “I like strong women” is code for “I hate strong women.”)” ― Gillian Flynn, Gone Girl"

I ended up legally changing it to his because my last name is well known in my town and I hated censoring my opinion at Chamber of Commerce/school board meetings and always getting ""Oh, you're so-and-so's daughter?""

I like the idea of keeping my name, especially with it being more common, but I could still see some merits of changing it. I guess I just want to remind everybody that it's just as legitimate of a decision to change it, I guess.

The actual legal name change is the least of it - I think in my state that comes for free with the marriage certificate, if you want it, and you can do it at the same time. But contacting all my creditors, utilities, etc.... My sister-in-law had trouble because she booked a flight months in advance using her old passport. She informed them her name had changed and they said to just bring the marriage certificate along so she did, and at the gate (not even the security screening which let her through, but the gate itself) the people were like ""we can't accept this."" So she ended up renewing her not-even-remotely-close-to-expiring passport just to avoid the hassle on the future.  Anyway, I imagine much of this swing is less identity politics and feminism - though it may very well be! - and more the sheer hassle of changing your name. Why bother?"

I'm guessing that's where your ""width"" is.    I will tell you from personal experience that I can be highly aroused and my vagina will still hold a tampon in place -- and that's about the diameter of a finger.  It's not like the vag just opens up and out drops the tampon.  Now, sex or penetration of any kind (like insertion of a tampon) can be difficult when the muscles are tense.  It's just hard to get anything in there.  That's why relaxation is important.  But no, there's not a cavity."

My biggest problem was that I felt like someone wanted Claire to be an amazing character with an arc, but someone decided to push Owen as the singular bad ass. She was the only interesting character, the only one with any real character growth, and was clearly the hero in my opinion and the movie didn't treat her as such.  The biggest example of this was when the kids rush up to meet Claire and the only thing they see is Owen being attacked by a flying dinosaur and Claire shooting it to kingdom come.

However, I would say it's far more likely she was fired for calling out specifically Adam Sandler, one of the most powerful actors in Hollywood. Still ridiculous though.  EDIT: you know, the more I think about it, I am kind of annoyed Rose McGowan did that. She totally squandered what could have been a great opportunity to raise awareness to an issue.    Tweet photo with everything but Sandler reference. Other publications pick it up, and do the dirty work for her.  Progress in seriously talking about the inherent sexism of Hollywood.   I read a study, it's been awhile so it may no longer be true (2008ish?), but there was a survey done about Afghani attitudes towards Americans. Guess what the biggest positive influence was? Friends. Motherfucking Friends has done more for ""winning the hearts and minds"" than anything the U.S. government has attempted.   Raises the profile of Rose McGowan.    I can't totally speak to this as an outsider, but it seems that the public of opinion of Adam Sandler is already so set that they'll surely believe it's from an Adam Sandler movie casting director even if it wasn't.  His star power so to speak is fading, and most likely isn't as powerful as it once was. I'll put this as a toss-up, but I suspect those inside Hollywood think it's a no-brainer.   It's a noble effort to be sure, they absolutely deserve to be called on their shit. Also, it's just plain insulting, it would feel pretty shitty to be expected to do something like that, so I understand just not giving a fuck and being like this is bullshit, I am sick of this.

There's nothing I can think of for you to have done... But since you might be in this situation in the future (walking home at night alone) there's a great app calle watch over me which uses your Gps location to track you until you get home and forces you to check in on the way so it knows your safe. If you fail to check in authorities are disbatched to your location and/or your emergency contact is notified. It's super helpful, and worth looking into if you have to walk home at night. Again, I'm sorry this happened to you. No one who stops to give a dog love deserves bulllllshhhhiiittt like that."
women,3ao2jy,liah,4,Mon Jun 22 02:44:14 2015 UTC,I have to look into that app!  Right now I'm planning on getting a defence spray. It's kind of a pepperspray but it also leaves a red stain on the attacker.  Thanks for the advice.   I feel a bit sorry for the dog to have an owner that seems to be nuts. :/
women,3ao2jy,MET1,1 point,Mon Jun 22 03:48:35 2015 UTC,"Quite frankly, you shouldn't worry about marking your attacker with a red stain. If defense/pepper sprays are used as they are supposed they, they are used for critical self defense, as a last resort to deter an attacker. If someone is actively attacking me, tough stuff if they had to throw away the shirt!! That would be the least of their worries.   Also, if your attacker got away, it might help police locate such a person."

Safety is in numbers and he or even another person would be very helpful in mostly scaring away this offender.   Did you tell him what happened? He should have made sure you were safe. Even as a simple coworker, he should not have left you alone.   If you must be alone then I would ride my bike for speed. Don't wear earbuds on the way home. You want to hear everything. And also pepper spray. I don't know how practical this is, but i read that if you use a wasp bug spray, they are designed to spray from 12 feet away and it is basically poison you could shoot or threaten to shoot if he came near."

women,3ao2jy,DelightfulTexas,7,Mon Jun 22 15:51:52 2015 UTC,"You couldn't've done anything different, really.  I'd definitely document it, in writing with date/time (or, better yet, create a document file on your computer so that it records the date/time for you and shows edits; don't delete this post either as it could potentially be evidence, as well) and, if feasible, set up a webcam that looks out your door, and maybe others that look out any ground-level windows you may have.  If you feel really unsafe (which I know I would!) have an audio record button quickly accessible on your phone, so you can record any potential future interactions with this guy. The only reason I don't recommend video is because if he notices he's being recorded, it may provoke him more. It would be in a public place, and I'm fairly sure you can record anything legally so long as it's in public.  I'm not sure if the police would take it seriously or not yet, which is why I'm not outright telling you to call them right now, but you could try your luck. Either way, document every single time you have an interaction with this man or a sighting of him near your home - he sounds unstable at best, and dangerous at worst. People that aggressive with that little impulse control are often the kind of people to worry about. Also, as often as possible, try to have someone to walk you home.   Documenting it, with date, time, etc. somewhere is important if it does get to the stage where you need to contact the authorities.  It's entirely possible he's stalking you if you live so close to work, and have reasonably regular hours. If that's what your instinct is telling you (which you haven't really mentioned, but seems like it may be the case) - TRUST IT. Always."
women,3ao2jy,DelightfulTexas,5,Mon Jun 22 03:18:27 2015 UTC,At 4am there is good reason to think threatening behavior is police business. Think about it this way - would he do the same at noon? likely not - taking advantage of the lack of witnesses at 4am.
women,3ao2jy,iammadeofawesome,5,Mon Jun 22 04:01:47 2015 UTC,I actually haven't seen him since but I have seen him once before.  I really don't know what to make of this encounter. I really hope it is a one time thing. I might want to take an other route home. It's a bit longer and more secluded but it's more or less perpendicular with the one I'm taking now but on the work building side of the road. Does that make sense?  It was a really creepy encounter and I intend on talking with some of the females I work with that I know walk to and from work.

Japan is increasingly unable to do that and other industrialized countries are not far behind. Population growth also drives economic growth, for better or worse. The only reason the US has positive population growth is immigration."
women,3ajmae,ohtheheavywater,2,Sun Jun 21 13:31:45 2015 UTC,"The article doesn't really go into it much. The issue is that our social and economic systems are dependent on certain demographics. Lacking births lead to more elderly, a smaller workforce and growing minorities since their birth rates tend to be higher in most industrialised countries (to make a broad generalisation).  That doesn't have to be necessarily a bad thing if we reduce welfare systems and give society time to adapt, but the immediacy of the change makes that difficult.   Regarding the ecological concerns: It's not that we have too many people, it's our lifestyle.  One Chinese citizen uses 11 times less resources than one American citizen on average. Statistically speaking , we could have 3 billion people in America use the same amount of resources as we do today, if we'd stick to mean Chinese living standards.

Here on Reddit people give no reasons for wanting to be childfree and I'm not trying to take their choices away from them, but I wish we could acknowledge the economic realities that have changed childbearing from a routine part of life into an expensive hobby. There's a combination of falling incomes, rising housing costs, and an arms race of expenses involved in childrearing that put childbearing out of reach for middle-class people trying to be financially responsible, and that's not OK."

women,3aednu,jungle_rot,6,Fri Jun 19 17:48:20 2015 UTC,This is scary because I grew up reading the warnings like everybody else but recently I read (on Reddit?) that TSS was a thing that happened in the 80's but isn't a problem anymore now that they've changed the sizes or the formula or whatever. I am definitely going to cut down on tampon use.
women,3aednu,ohtheheavywater,31,Fri Jun 19 21:41:20 2015 UTC,"Read the instructions.

Her suit is based on the fact the brand was labeling themselves ""All Natural"" while still using a majority percent of synthetic man made fibers which exponentially raise the risk of TSS in comparison to natural cotton which is a logical assumption with a product labeled ""All Natural"""
women,3aednu,AimForTheHead,4,Sat Jun 20 02:41:23 2015 UTC,I thought natural and organic aren't regulated labels in the US? As in you can slap them on everything without recourse.

Of course that may be an outlier and I apologize if I'm misrepresenting the consensus on the issue. However unless there's enough evidence either way I find it hard to blame the manufacturer since even if it was all natural cotton the risk for toxic shock syndrome is still there.

women,3aednu,cvilla7,3,Fri Jun 19 19:23:52 2015 UTC,"I switched to the cup about six years ago and I've never looked back. Easily the best period-related decision I ever made.

women,3aednu,sunstorm77,3,Sat Jun 20 00:41:52 2015 UTC,"Yup, that's exactly what I do. Take it out, empty it, give it a good wash and pop it back in and I'm done until I'm getting ready to go to bed (or at least until after work on a heavy day). It's awesome."
women,3aednu,sunstorm77,10,Sat Jun 20 04:36:38 2015 UTC,"This is really scary. I wish I had been more informed about this as a young woman, because while tampon usage was pitched to me from both adults in my life and the media as the expected and normal thing to do, the details of the risks associated with it were not made very apparent. I now use a cup, and plan to get some of those Thinx underwear, and am a million times more comfortable with that than tampons. I wish more people had access to those kind of options, both being informed that they exist and having the ability to find and afford them.   I do think it's pretty messed up that the major tampon manufacturers made the switch to synthetic materials knowing about the massively increased risk for TSS and all they had to do was put a warning on the box. The article says that non-synthetic materials would practically erase the risk. The synthetic blends in tampons are the perfect breeding ground for the bacteria that can cause TSS.   Tampon boxes have been required to print these warning labels since the 80s, but Shkolnik argues that the warnings on Lauren's tampon box weren't clear enough, especially about leaving tampons in at night. Here's the language: ""Change your tampon every four to eight hours, including overnight."" The family argues that these instructions are unclear. They plan to argue that ""overnight"" can mean longer than eight hours, especially when it comes to young girls, who can easily sleep nine or ten hours on a weekend. ""[Tampon companies] should be telling you, 'Don't sleep in it. Use a pad,'"" says Shkolnik.  Of course, most women will recall that there is a warning about toxic shock syndrome on all tampon boxes and though they probably don't process it every time they use a tampon, or even purchase a box, they know, however vaguely, that it's there. It reads:   Tampon use has been associated with toxic shock syndrome. TSS is a rare but serious disease that may cause death. Read and save the enclosed information. Use for eight hours maximum.     Shkolnik admits that the existence of this FDA warning label will be the hardest part of the case. ""Part of our job is to show the jury that it's not about the warning on the box—it's about the fact that they've had materials available for 20 years that could make [tampons] safer, and they've chosen not to use them. They call these tampons 'natural,' when in fact it's the man-made materials that make them dangerous. Their marketing makes young women think, 'Oh, these are the natural cotton ones,' but they're not natural, they're not cotton, and if they were, the chance of toxic shock would be down to almost nothing.""  Dr. Philip M. Tierno, a professor of microbiology and pathology at the NYU School of Medicine who has done serious independent research into the link between tampons and toxic shock syndrome, agrees that cotton would be safer. ""Most major tampon manufacturers make tampons with either mixes of viscose rayon and cotton, or pure viscose rayon, and in either case those tampons provide optimal physical-chemical conditions necessary to cause the production of the TSST-1 toxin if a toxigenic strain of Staphylococcus aureus is part of the normal vaginal flora in a woman,"" he says. ""Toxic shock syndrome may result if a woman has no antibody to the toxin or low antibody. Therefore the synthetic ingredients of a tampon are a problem, whereas 100 percent cotton tampons provide the lowest risk, if any risk at all.""    I don't think this woman is trying to profit from the lawsuit. She lost her leg and part of her foot. She doesn't want it to happen to anyone else. I also don't agree with blaming her for this happening. I know if I was feverish and busy while on my period I might not put two and two together either. She was sick and disoriented.  She was vaguely aware of the risk of TSS like most people who use tampons are. However, education about periods is lacking. There are lots of people who don't have good information about this issue or about periods in general. A vaguely worded warning on the box is not going to help them, and they deserve to be informed about this literally recently manufactured risk they have no control over.  I don't understand why these manufacturers shouldn't be required to use cotton or at least offer a non-synthetic option. TSS doesn't even have to be a possible effect of tampon usage, so why is it? I assume they use the synthetic blends because they are cheaper and more absorbent. More absorbent so you can leave them in longer...so you can increase your risk of TSS thanks to the material that causes the risk in the first place? What the fuck.  From what I've read in this article and my own experiences, I think manufacturers should be held accountable. I think there should be an affordable and available name-brand non-synthetic fiber option. I also think other options like menstrual cups should be more available and affordable. In fact, I think all of the above should be free as part of general healthcare for people who menstruate. It's not like you have a choice about whether or not you do it."
women,3aednu,sophisticatedjapes,2,Sat Jun 20 04:59:38 2015 UTC,"You may also want to understand what bleached cotton tampons can do as well(irritation and dryness which can cause microtearing). I could even point out the other chemicals sprayed on growing cotton and in manufacturing rayon, but the FDA tells us there at low enough levels to be safe. All in all tampons are an option that freed and liberated women from their menstrual cycles, but all tampons have risks(sadly).  I am leaning more and more to the cup - although my experience is not great so far - I like the idea of not filling landfills or clogging drains with my menstrual products.  Just always wear the smallest size you can to manage your flow, change it often, try not to sleep with them in (this was always my mother's and Drs advice, and I know aton of my peers ar like ""eww, leakage"") and if you have a fever, always take them out."
women,3aednu,Lostforwords2,1 point,Sat Jun 20 05:38:04 2015 UTC,"Absolutely. That was the main reason for my switch to the cup. It's a shame that most manufacturers don't just use the best materials for our health because it's the right thing to do. Unbleached and/or organic cotton tampons exist but they aren't widely available and tend to cost significantly more. Having things like tampons available at all definitely makes a huge difference in the ability of people with uteri to live their lives, and especially to get an education. That is invaluable, for sure. There are many people who still don't even have access to them at all. I don't think we should have to settle for a harmful product just because not having them at all is a worse alternative. For something that half the population needs for a majority of their lives it really seems like the companies that make them should be held at the very least to a standard that minimizes the risk of harm. In that regard I hope her lawsuit spurs some change along those lines. I also hope access to menstrual products starts getting treated like a fundamental right so that everyone who needs them can live their life to the fullest capacity and not be held back by something they can't control and we have the ability to solve without those solutions causing harm."

She can sue for their marketing not matching their content, but every box has a warning in it to change your tamon and IF you have a fever, take out your tampon."
women,3aednu,Lostforwords2,1 point,Sat Jun 20 11:49:38 2015 UTC,"She was running a fever. I don't think you understand what happens to the human body during a high fever. You become delirious. That the packaging is misleading is exactly what she is suing for, as well as to force companies to start using safer materials that have a lowered risk of TSS, since there are a ton of advances in material science since the 80's when they were last overhauled. You're arguing against a lawsuit that would make tampons safer for you, me, and every other woman in the US that uses them, while taking the piss on a woman who lost her leg while following the instructions on how to avoid TSS. My god, fucking read, and have a bit of empathy man."
women,3aednu,AimForTheHead,2,Sat Jun 20 15:28:22 2015 UTC,"I said what happened was horrible and I am well aware of what happens with a high fever, but tell me again who is at fault?     She went to a party with flu like symptoms, she drove home, and when she got there got undressed and passed out.  She disregarded her symptoms and went to bed for days - long enough to have the police perform a safety check.    These are all facts.      There are companies who use 100% cotton, it is up to the consumer to understand the risks of the product and make their selection. Sure the big brands are cheaper and there material make-up is why. Additionally there are studies that show no difference in cotton to cotton/rayon tampons  causing TSS as well as studies arguing for all cotton(just to play devil's advocate). If we all choose the brands that are 100% cotton, the market will shift.  My fear is that this lawsuit will make an already necessary and expensive product even more expensive.    I have read and reread the article to understand your point of view.  I believe this to be a tragic accident. I feel terrible for this woman that her life was so altered. I feel women, especially young women need to understand what they are putting in their bodies be it tampons, birth control pills or IUD. Read the instructions and the side effects of everything.  They all have risks.  They all have possible side effects.  I do not want to blame the woman, but I can't blame the manufacturer either.  The warning labels and content are all there.  There is no need for a lawsuit as the information is on the box.  And if your concern is about the ""all natural"" statement - its an unregulated statement, so don't sue the manufacturer, insist that the FDA change it so that all products benefit from a definition of what ""all natural"" means.  Your stance is that it is the tampon companies fault.  My stance is that there is inherent risk in using a tampon.  Her story serves as a horrible teaching experience on why you should change your tampons every 4-8 hours and if you feel sick, take our your tampon."

Still, the priorities seem messed up. If consent of minors is such an issue why do we still force genital surgery on kids for the same reason?

women,3admd1,sadatay,14,Fri Jun 19 06:52:20 2015 UTC,"I am kind of glad that Tim Hunt said what he said, because this is a discussion that's been sorely needed.  Science remains one of the few holdouts of sexism, and Hunt's comments aren't an isolated, rare event.  As a woman in a lab, my career has been routinely peppered with this sort of casual gender disparity.  There was the professor who taught our entire class that women genetically could not be as smart as men, complete with molecular genetic ""evidence.""  He knew it was dangerous territory, but he simply believed it to be true.  There was the time when my adviser told me that my project would have been done sooner if he'd hired a man to do it.  Again, no malice intended--just a simple belief that women are naturally less assertive in their problem solving.  In trying to address the lack of women in upper echelons of science, we have investigated trends in elementary school education and what maternity leave does to one's career.  Finally we can shed some light on the real problem.  Hunt's statement is a great example of this sexism.  It's not a hate problem; no one hates women in the lab.  It's an ingrained belief that women are inferior."

I am a female scientist though, and I don't think Tim realized he was poking a dragon that's been laying-in-wait for a reason to cause some havoc. Women in science are struggling. It is a boys club, and every adviser, every boss, and ever interview I've gone to since my undergrad years made this pretty clear to me. Sure, we are making some awesome headway, but it's actually pretty damn hard to be taken seriously.   Tim did us a favor in that poorly delivered joke, let's not burn him at the stake... he's expressed how horrible he feels, he has daughters that are scientists, he has a wife that works(ed) at the same university.  He isn't sexist, just a fan of old school jokes.  He's probably told that one a thousand times and gotten a groan from his wife and a smirked roll of the eyes from his daughters. I know because my dad tells the same jokes, but he is most definitely a feminist."

If donor sperm is used, again, how will they explain that to a child?

I'm on birth control where I don't get my period so i take them randomly just to make sure (sidenote: even if I'm pretty sure I'm not pregnant, it's always terrifying waiting for the result).    The cashier said nothing to me.  But the woman in front of me looked at them and kept asking questions...  Like is the first one to test and the second to make sure?  Are you trying to get pregnant?!  You look so young, I hope you're ok.  So out of line and really none of her business at all.  If she had simply said good luck or something I wouldn't have cared but it was just endless questions that seemed judgemental.  Plus I didn't engage her at all and she kept going."

World's overpopulated, call this my most unpopular opinion if you like, but i don't think ANYONE should be having more than two, maybe three at the most, children. Nineteen kids... I can't get over it. Nineteen?! And they're not being vilified for their irresponsible overbreeding? Sure, historically, people had loads of children and that was fine because the reason they had so many was that the vast majority of children born in past centuries simply did not survive to adulthood... in the 21st century, there's just no excuse...

women,38uu2i,strbx,7,Sun Jun 7 00:43:34 2015 UTC,"This article was hard for me to decide whether or not I agreed with it. On one hand, I am not... uncomfortable...? I don't really know the word. I'm not completely on board with someone who makes a decision so late in the game to become a woman and decide that life is great because now she can wear nail polish and be openly empathetic, but at the same time I find it quite hypocritical that the author rejects trans women's experiences as authentic. I agree that cis women have many shared common experiences, but to suggest that our identities are made of entirely of these shared experiences is the wrong attitude to take.  In a way, maybe I'm jealous of Caitlyn, because she never had to deal with a creepy man staring at her boobs in starbucks when she was fourteen, or someone not believing her when she says she was assaulted, or told that a certain activity wasn't right for her because of her gender, but that doesn't mean that she isn't allowed to be a woman without those experiences.  Unfortunately, I do think the way the media is portraying trans women is setting back women as a whole. Caitlyn Jenner is still the same person that was an Olympian and helped build an empire. She needs to emphasize that. I'm not saying it's wrong to talk about hair and makeup, but I feel like the trans women the media has chosen to glorify has done so in a way that reinforces stereotypes that hold us back. I guess  in summary, life is complex and we're complex and this article is just another example of that."
women,38uu2i,renards,5,Sun Jun 7 18:55:31 2015 UTC,"life is complex and we're complex and this article is just another example of that   Agreed! Also, as a transwoman, I am privileged to not have to deal with some of the sickening things that happened to many cis-women while they were developing.  Of course, I get that now, along with the cat calling, slut shaming, and I've been told certain activities weren't right for me due to my gender (either way I presented).   Oddly enough, I've dealt with something similar to periods (including the occasional random OMG why is there a pool of blood in my office chair...) I also get the looks of disgust as if my very existence is offensive for some people, or accusations that I'm trying to ""trick"" them into being attracted to me.

There was no name calling, there was no disparaging comments, it underlined that the struggle transpeople go through is real, while maintaining that it isn't okay to take away women's spaces, or say that using the word vagina is somehow a threat to a transperson. The only unreasonable opinion I see is your comment."
women,38uu2i,AimForTheHead,6,Sun Jun 7 18:31:00 2015 UTC,"What was most jarring to me was that the author seemed to be shaming other women in order to say that her own gender identity (and the experiences that accompany it) are more legitimate than others.  The point when includes a quote about wishing that Jenner hadn't come out as a ""sex babe"" seemed especially slut shaming.  Why can't trans* and cis both be included in ""woman?""

When the author says that trans* women are ""demanding that women reconceptualize"" themselves, I disagreed. I think that it is trans* women wanting to also be considered women, not tell others that they are not. It is a widening of the definition, not them ""trampling"" on the author's claim to dignity as a woman (which she states clearly).   That is my opinion, what is yours? (assuming you are reading the same article, of course)"
women,38uu2i,WizardofStaz,0,Sun Jun 7 20:26:18 2015 UTC,Widening the definition is perfectly fine. Telling woman with biological vaginas that they can't use that word is excluding cis women from their own bodies. That's not okay.
women,38uu2i,AimForTheHead,1 point,Tue Jun 9 14:10:12 2015 UTC,"I don't believe that trans* women are telling cis women that they can't use the term ""woman"" to express themselves, simply that they shouldn't use the term when a different one is more appropriate.   That's why ""reproductive rights"" is a much more appropriate term for abortion rights than is ""women's rights."" It's just more, well, accurate.   Some women have vaginas. Some men do, too. So I understand why using the term ""vagina"" as synonyms to ""woman"" is just an incorrect generalization."
women,38uu2i,WizardofStaz,2,Tue Jun 9 20:38:26 2015 UTC,"I don't understand how you do not see that telling ""cis"" women that something that have identified with their entire life needs to be stopped (being a woman, no special disclaimers), especially in places where you are already accepted, is exclusionary. You are saying that because you identify with our gender, that we need to change our gender rules to include you, and think of ourselves differently, even though we accept you with open arms. It's ridiculous. In the article it was referencing ""A Night of a Thousand Vaginas"" for an abortion provider. Last time I checked, no matter which gender you identify with, you need a vagina to get an abortion. You may have a vagina and not have the reproductive organs to ever need an abortion, but every person that has ever needed an abortion has a vagina. Do you not see the hypocrisy in pushing people out of the spaces they belong to make space for you? Especially when we've made the space already?"
women,38uu2i,AimForTheHead,0,Tue Jun 9 23:30:09 2015 UTC,"First question:   ""cis"" women   Why did you put cis in quotation marks? Honest question, because cisgendered is an adjective that accompanies women or man. The term ""women"" includes both trans* and cis. That is the point of widening the definition, as you agreed was a good thing to do.   Also, the problem cited with ""Night of the Thousand Vaginas"" was that the term ""vagina"" was deemed problematic for trans* men that didn't want their reproductive organs coded as ""woman."" It was not about trans* women telling cis women that they should not consider themselves women (something I think the author made an effort to avoid mentioning). Now, I personally did not have a problem with this title, but I understand why some other people did. I understand your frustration, definitely. But I think your frustration is coming to the wrong conclusion.  So please provide me with examples of trans* women telling cis women they need to stop identifying as women. Because in that example (as extreme as it is) does not appear to me that trans* women were telling people with vaginas that they cannot be women- just that some people with vaginas are not women.   Also, I think you are making a mistake by assuming that those who took to twitter to admonish the woman who organized ""Night of a Thousand Vaginas"" represent the opinions and ideas of all trans* women. The way I see it, they are angry people on twitter. Do you really think that that is how the entirety of the trans* community wishes to conduct itself?  Also, a final question:   Do you not see the hypocrisy in pushing people out of the spaces they belong to make space for you? Especially when we've made the space already?   Do you think that the trans* women's community has achieved full acceptance in greater society? Because that is what I take your quote of ""especially when we've made the space [for trans* women] already?"" to mean. If that is not what you meant it to mean, then please explain."
women,38uu2i,WizardofStaz,2,Wed Jun 10 00:27:21 2015 UTC,"My frustration is that no one should have a problem with an abortion service provider using the word vagina. It is a word for the genitals of ANYONE who needs an abortion, regardless of their gender identity. A  trans*man, can identify as a man, and still have a vagina, and depending on their sexual preference, still get pregnant and need an abortion provider! There is nothing wrong with that! That is the crux of my frustration.   Your second point of it not being how the entire community wishes to conduct itself, while valid, doesn't change that the extremists in the community are the ones (look at the other poster replying that I am some sort of scum for not agreeing with them wholeheartedly) that yell the loudest and block out the moderate viewpoint.   In greater society, no you have not sadly gained complete acceptance, but in terms of the author of this article, and myself you have gained full acceptance regardless of your gender identity. So I do take umbrage with a group of people (I recognize and have clarified that it is your extremists)  that I personally accept making me feel like I should change the way I view and identify/title my body, when I do not think you should change the way you view and identify yours."

That's less than surprising, in the type of closed fundamentalist religious group that believes that girls/women are supposed to be subservient to males in their lives.  The Duggars and their Quiverfull movement aren't any different than any other extreme fundamentalist religion. Boys will be boys but that's okay because they're God's anointed, and girls are expected to cover themselves up and not 'tempt' men, and if they do, it's their fault and they're the ones who are guilty. You see it in the not quite Mormon polygamist societies, the Amish, the extreme Islamic religions.  It's never the fault of the abusers, and the victims of the abuse almost never speak up except to excuse the abusers.    The Fox interview with Jessa and Jill is painful to watch. They feel that Josh's molestation of them was pretty much okay, and they're just being victimized by the liberal media.  I can't even imagine how much pressure they've had on them for the past few weeks- it must be horrible to try and reconcile a religion that you may believe in, and knowing that your family's future income stream depends on your answers, and trying to deal with your own feelings about something that you may have only recently realized was wrong, and also being exposed to a media that doesn't ""understand"" that what happened to you was pretty typical of everyone that you've known."

Their reasons for enforcing harsh modesty standards were the same. That, for me, was huge.

women,38cp14,arwMommy,2,Wed Jun 3 20:32:28 2015 UTC,"Rabbit test:       The rabbit test, or ""Friedman test"", was an early pregnancy test developed in 1931 by Maurice Harold Friedman and Maxwell Edward Lapham  at the University of Pennsylvania as an improvement on the 1927 test developed by Bernhard Zondek and Selmar Aschheim. The original test actually used mice,  and was based upon the observation that when urine from a woman in the early months of pregnancy is injected into immature female mice, the ovaries of the mice enlarge and show follicular maturation. The test was considered reliable, with an error rate of less than 2%.  The rabbit test consisted of injecting the tested woman's urine into a female rabbit, then examining the rabbit's ovaries a few days later, which would change in response to a hormone only secreted by pregnant women. The hormone, human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), is produced during pregnancy and indicates the presence of a fertilized egg; it can be found in a pregnant woman's urine and blood. The rabbit test became a widely used bioassay (animal-based test) to test for pregnancy. The term ""rabbit test"" was first recorded in 1949 but became a common phrase in the English language.

Many people are kind, caring and accepting of differences. Many are hateful and will hate you and me because we are different in some way from them. We all know that that is a sad but true fact.  I'm an old white guy. 62. Sometimes on Reddit, younger people blast me for just that, perhaps because my opinions don't matter to them or they disagree.   I've been around a wide variety of people. I grew up in the inner city with several races. I hope I learned to be accepting of everyone as individuals or groups and not to judge based on anything other than behavior.  You said you need some support right now. Here it comes.  Right now, I give you a little piece of my heart. My kindness. My caring. I give you my support in whatever tiny way I can, for whatever it's worth to you.   Today, in support of you, I will share some extra kindness to some random person in the hope that the good vibration will drift across to you, wherever you are. Someone today will be given a smile and a handshake intended for you, by me.  I hope that's enough to lift your spirits a bit and make you smile."

I do agree with all of them, but sometimes I wonder if it's true, and all I can do is just hope it is true.  But I will share another side, which is of course just the other side of the internet in general I guess: that the amount of information and bullshit can really change some people's views. It is because of reddit that I discovered the truth about the racism in this country. I am a white woman and have lived my life as a relatively clueless white person, like most of us in the US. Through reddit I started realizing and learning more, I started reading more, and I started understanding more. I've become extremely passionate about ending the ridiculous amount of racism that still exists in American systems and thought. I'm going to law school this year and I want more than anything to somehow be a part of that change. (Idealistic, I know, but, I can try). In the very least, I'm one more white person who is much more sympathetic and understanding, and I do all I can to educate other white people because I realize the large majority of them are just clueless.  So, from the midst of all this bullshit and these terrible people, others are learning more and becoming more understanding. I know I'm only one person posting now, but I'm sure I'm not the only person who has had this kind of experience.   Try to ignore the ignorance (again, easier said than done). I realized that I was getting so angry about things that I was choosing to read. It hurts me when they say this shit, so I've tried to stop reading. I try to get involved in a conversation only when there's a potential to be heard, and reddit is unfortunately not often that place, especially the big subreddits. I've unsubscribed from most of the big subreddits, and many days I'll just read a multi that I created that is pretty much just women-oriented subreddits and /r/blackladies, which I recommend you subscribe to if you don't already.   In sum, I'm sorry on behalf of the stupid fucktards that are the bottomfeeders among white men, and I'm sorry that you have to read their inane ramblings and insults. But know that for every fucked up comment and upvote, there are more people waking up and realizing how fucked up it all is, and more of us taking a stand, and that will bring about change."

I keep coming back because there are so many good parts--communities that I can share my love of Parks&Rec and Orphan Black and hilarious gifs with.  But I often wonder whether there are enough good apples to outweigh the bad ones.  And I have grown so weary of the sound of my own internal screaming.  You see so much of the bad that sometimes it becomes all that you can see, and you become convinced that you must have been sleeping in or searching for a cigarette that moment when all that was good died.  And this is the trick that Reddit plays on you, with a constant drum beat of racist, misogynistic comments and cartoons and glib memes.    But you know what?  Fuck those people.  Fuck their small minds and tiny hearts and complete inability to see the world in all its brilliant shades of color and tone.  You are a strong, formidable woman.

women,37vu28,hyperpearlgirl,10,Sun May 31 02:09:51 2015 UTC,"There are many people that think that men and women should not be treated equally. Usually, this comes from some sort of idea that men and women are fundamentally different, and therefore treating them 'the same' is unfair or disadvantageous to one or the other, or to society at large. Nevermind that equality and sameness are entirely different concepts."
women,37vu28,Inksplotter,4,Sat May 30 23:31:07 2015 UTC,"Your definition is sort of limited, but all definitions are. Just like all women are different, all feminists are different. There's a lot of academic discussion about what feminism is/means/can do.   Part of the problem is that WHAT ""equality among the sexes"" means: it's very complicated and messy at many levels. There are a lot of small social cues that are different for men than they are for women, and standards for ""what it means to be a woman"" and ""what it means to be a man"" are different. At a certain level, it's about trying to erase stereotypes that are pervasive throughout society. This relates to a million little issues (contraceptive access, abortion clinics, equal pay, hiring practices, etc).   Because of this, people can say ""I'm a feminist"" and that means different things. Believing that ""men and women are equal"" means different things to different people because of where they draw the line on equality.

The major difference is that there is no official leader of feminism or official platform.  For example, some people think that feminism is treating women and men exactly the same, but I'd disagree with that and instead say that my idea of feminism is treating men and women as equally valuable and celebrating differences."

OP, while you're doing background research, be sure to look into the movement that preceded second-wave feminism: Women's Liberation. Based in an internationalist, class-based analysis, this is a perspective that simply could not ever be warped into the grotesque caricature that academics made of feminism.

I think what trips people up and causes controversy is the myriad ways individual people go about attempting to achieve this out in the world, along with the broad range of intensity activism they employ (or don't) in doing so.   It's just a philosophy of equality. The implementation is the messy part, and involves a lot of interpretation, disagreement, and stepping on toes and cultural push-back. Opponents of gender equality exploit this by selecting out the most radical or offensive (to them) self described feminists and holding them up as an example of what feminist are/believe ""in their own words"". It's incredibly cynical. Feminists, like everybody else, are individuals with differing views. A lot of people just can't wrap their heads around the fact that feminists themselves can still be feminists without being activists per se (not that there's a thing wrong with that). Most are I'd wager. If you support the notion of political, economic, and social equality among the genders, then you're a feminist, whether you choose to label yourself as such or not, or even choose to do much about it.

If to know women are born equal, we are defining ourselves as feminists. We are actually changing the definition of equality for women. Which in itself makes women unequal. How many times do you hear ""I believe women are equal"" or ""I believe in equality"" ""Oh so you're a feminist"". If to be equal, you've got to be a feminist, then you can't be born equal. Because humans aren't born with ideology. It is a learned idea, just as the unequal treatment of women is a learned idea.  Feminism needs to go IMO, it doesn't help as a definition anymore. Many of the movements, thoughts and actions of people that label themselves feminists are noble and should be done in individual movements. Given that many of these efforts contradict one another anyway, and It is a far more effective stance IMO when you say I support X movement. You're not inviting the entire history and prejudgement that comes along with a giant history filled ideology.   We've created a situation where anything to do with women.

And you have a problem with ""anything to do with women [being] known as feminism, women's rights, women's issues"" and ""not human issues."" lots of reasons why saying that doesn't make sense, but fundamentally there are issues that adversely affect women specifically. and yes, political resistance to those adverse affects is called feminism. not humanism or human issues. women's rights being a subset of human rights and uhhhhh not mutually exclusive. since, you know, women are human."

I pretty much wear pj's to work and come and go when I want as long as I get the painting done in time. She's dumber than a door nail and lives under a rock. I replied with ""that attitude is the exact reason I didn't want anyone here knowing any of my business. I don't want anyone telling me what I can or can't do."" She shut right the hell up.

I'm a waitress/server/captain and many restaurants in my niche (fine dining/notable chefs) up until very recently simply did not hire women for front of house jobs at all. There were no female captains in NYC four star restaurants until the middle of the '00s. Many houses were European or Japanese-dominated and that means men only. I was often the only woman on the floor and the first who was either hired or who stayed past a few months. Suffice to say, I endured endless severe brutal sexual harassment and actionable offenses like actually telling me I wouldn't work out because I was a woman or that I couldn't be hired because I was a woman.  Things are changing a bit now, but I still get very different treatment from my Italian owners than my male coworkers, however ""benign"" they see it. Every once in a while I have to remind them they are now in the US and that if I were a man, they would not/could not speak to me a certain way. Then things are ok for another few months until something happens again. At least I'm not getting physically groped at this job.

Mine prescribed a small dose antibiotic to take for situations when I may be prone to infection, such as post-sexy time or a long day at the beach/pool. Also, for chronic UTI sufferers, it is super important for us to pee after sex and generally be fastidious about cleaning up down there after any type of sexual activity/workout sweat/moisture.  AZO also carries an over the counter cranberry pill that helps urinary tract health, and has a UTI relief pill for when you do get one (it doesn't cure the UTI, just relieves symptoms, so you have to be sure to follow up with a Dr. Appt. or the infection can spread to your kidneys!)

They just told me to go home and drink lots of water to ""flush it out"".   I went home and did a bunch of research and found that D Mannose is a godsend. It has gotten rid of all my UTIs since then and made my bladder stronger, and it's so much better than taking antibiotics all the time. It's just a sugar, same found in cranberries, and you can take it in powder or pill form. I take it after sex every once in awhile to stay preventative or take it more aggressively if something doesn't feel right."

Let's hope some reason prevails in the floor vote.   Nevertheless, Stickland’s aggressive tactics paid off. After the house adjourned for the night and Stickland had been ejected from the floor, the calendars committee reconvened and voted to suspend their regular meeting rules, meeting this time without any Democrats and without two Republicans who had voted against bringing SB 575 up for debate. Tea Party Rep. Debbie Riddle (R-Tomball), who originally voted against SB 575, abruptly changed her mind on the bill and led an 8-0 vote to set the abortion insurance ban up for debate in the house on Tuesday.   Article  Edit - here's an article about the bill.  Apparently it bans insurance coverage for any abortion, even in the case of a non viable fetus.   If the measure passes, Texas will become the 11th state to prohibit all comprehensive insurance plans from covering abortion, and the 16th to prohibit abortion coverage from federal health plans; it will also mean more terribly unsurprising news from the Lone Star state.

women,370zfh,bw128,2,Sat May 23 21:16:37 2015 UTC,"Losing the weight should be the first thing, because it will improve all the other things. I'm in the process of losing weight myself, so I've done a lot of reading on this recently- feel free to bail out of this novella!  Remember: You put it on slowly with small changes that added up over time. And that's how it's going to come off. These changes are intended to be permanent, so it's okay to change habits slowly.  Shoot for one change a week. The first change should be recording what you eat- you need to have an accurate picture of what you are actually doing in order to change it. Because people are really good at having no idea how much they eat. Everyone is bad at this. No judgment for this week, just focus on recording honestly. There are lots of options, everything from myfitnesspal to a regular ol' pen and paper, just make sure you're recording calories. You should also start recording your weight regularly. Once a week is fine, five times a day is too often.  Week two: Incorporate some kind of light exercise. It doesn't matter what it is, (although it is easier to be consistent about something you enjoy) but it should make you huff and puff and/or sweat, and should take more than half an hour. Do this twice a week. (And yes, you do have the time. It may mean less derping on the internet, but one good measure of how important something is is what you are not doing in order to do the other thing. How important is taking care of yourself? Is it more important than 30 minutes worth of cat pictures?)  Week three: Spend some time at the beginning of this week planning and cooking all of either your lunches or dinners for the week. Cooking in bulk is easier, and simple ground beef with sauteed vegetables can taste totally different with easy spicing: sirracha one day, ginger crushed red pepper soy sauce and garlic the next, chipolte lime after that. If you can fry an egg, you can handle this.  Week four: You've been tracking your calories the last three weeks, right? So you have a good picture of your average calorie intake. Time for some math. Calculate your TDEE. How does that compare to what you are actually eating? Figure out what daily calorie intake will get you to your goal weight, losing no more than two pounds a week. Plan your 'pre prep' meals this week with how much you want to shave off of your daily intake in mind.  Week Five: Review. At this point you should be honestly tracking all the food you eat, consuming calories below your TDEE. You should be recording your weight too, so you know if your estimated calorie count is close enough. (If over time you aren't losing weight, it means you're underestimating the calories you're eating, which is very easy to do. Just adjust your daily calorie intake to be about 200 calories less, and continue.) You should be exercising twice a week (doing it at the same time every week does make it easier) and you should be making at least some of your meals in advance, with an eye to hitting that calorie goal. Take this week to brush up on habits are you having trouble with. What can you do to plan ahead to make doing them easier?"
