EDC,3e21wj,MalaclypseTheYunger,4,Tue Jul 21 10:27:25 2015 UTC,"Not giving up my details like field of work etc but vaguely: I did science and now I work on crime.    First time posting an EDC. I've got my old EDC first and then a ""starter set"" of sorts I've put together for myself more recently.  The first image shows my EDC as a postgrad as I went through two MSc programs one after another (one to qualify for grants, one to chance field). The second is my EDC in my current position as a researcher/writer. I work from home mostly now so the needs have changed.  I commuted via bike during this time so carried simple tools for maintenance in my bag at this time. I'd also have things like inner tubes and pump.  -1. Victorinox Climber Swiss Army Knife 1370330 VICCLIMBLACK  http://www.amazon.co.uk/Victorinox-Climber-Swiss-1370330-VICCLIMBLACK/dp/B0001P14WC/ I originally had one in the classic red look but it was stolen. I replaced it with this which covers basically all my common needs. The only thing I regret not having on this is the saw tool. But balancing size with utility this is basically perfect as far as I'm concerned.  -2. Cruzer Fit 16 GB USB 2.0 Flash Drive  http://www.amazon.co.uk/Cruzer-Fit-Flash-Drive-SDCZ33-016G-B35/dp/B005FYNSZA/ This is just big enough to hold a few very important things. Key peices of work. A bootable Linux installation (pre-configured). A portable installation of Firefox and a Zotero (reference manager) directory that pFirefox is pointed at. The Zotero-Firefox combo meant I could take EVERY SINGLE one of my journals/books with me to any work computer AND all my notes on them. I'll be upgrading this to a 3.0 version with  32 or 64gb when 3.0 becomes more common place.  -3. Molskine Sketchbook  http://www.amazon.co.uk/Moleskine-S01151-Sketchbook/dp/8883701151/ I've worked almost completely digitally since around 2000. I don't often take any notes. However, if I need to jot down dates, numbers or important info; I find tablets and phones are still just a little too clumsy and laptops are inconvenient if you don't have them out already. So I always have a notebook and I use it for sparse but important notes. Though I use it almost daily, it's taken me about 3 years to fill this. I'll replace it with the exact same type but soft-cover this time.  -4. Draper Allen Key Set  http://www.amazon.co.uk/Advanced-Draper-XS14128-Imperial-Warranty/dp/B00UQ890F2/ Not sure on the exact model of this because the code has worn off and, though it looks the same, what numbers are left don't match this link. But it's basically the same. Used for the bike. Hard-wearing and good range of sizes.  -5. Rolson 12 in 1 Deluxe Pocket Multi-Tool with Belt Pouch  http://www.amazon.co.uk/Rolson-Deluxe-Pocket-Multi-Tool-Pouch/dp/B00935N5XM Cheap quality. A freebie I was gifted after a friend got it thrown in with another purchase. I use it primarily for the pliers to adjust things like break cables. It's not nice to use or particularly resilient but it does the job and you get what you pay for. It's the thing I use the least and can least justify purchasing a nicer model just for the sake of having something nicer to do the same job so it stays. I'm not sure what the legal status of carrying this is as it doesn't lock but I have seen people mention trouble with multi-tools that close back up over where the blade extends from.   -6. Zebra M-301 0.5mm Stainless Steel Mechanical Pencil  http://www.amazon.co.uk/Zebra-M-301-Stainless-Mechanical-Pencil/dp/B00E8D8H50/ I prefer pencil to pen and metal to wood. This was picked because it was what on offer when I needed one rather than because it's any good. It works. I'm looking at getting one of these instead as they seem highly recommended: http://www.amazon.co.uk/Uni-Roulette-Rotation-Mechanical-Pencil/dp/B004OHNTVC/    The second image contains my current EDC (sort of). Apologies for weird numbering but it keeps the original items numbered the same.  1, 2, 3, and 6 as before. As I'm mostly working from home now the tools are gone, though they're still around, and I'll take them out if I'm out on the bike.  -4. Samsung Galaxy S4 I9505 with Anker 7800mAh Extended Battery  http://www.amazon.co.uk/Samsung-Galaxy-I9505-Black-unlocked/dp/B00I51EZ7A/ http://www.amazon.co.uk/7800mAh-Extended-Battery-Samsung-Aactive/dp/B00LO8T6VQ/ This was my first proper smart phone after getting actual funding/work and it's revolutionised how I organise my time. I still use the notepad and pencil to jot down important stuff but once it's added to a computer/phone/online the phone makes a perfect too for getting it all back out. I had a ZeroLemon 7500 mAh battery before the Anker one but it finally started to lose charge a little faster after almost two years. These do significantly increase the size and weight of the phone (which I actually really like). But it's the difference between 1 day if lucky/half a day of heavy use to 3-4 days of heavy use with everything turned on/up to max. I would never buy a phone in future for which I couldn't use an extended battery.  -5. Wallet  Simple leather wallet, unbranded and received as a gift so no idea where it's from. I enhanced the card behind the window a little so it was readable. Pope Card; should you wish to possess your own: http://i.imgur.com/WUqikTI.gif I also carry a ""survival"" (lol) card in the wallet. Basically one of these: http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B006FTF9BA/ Not hugely useful but if you've got access to nothing else it's better than nothing.  -7. Lansky LKN333  http://www.amazon.co.uk/Lansky-Sharpeners-LKN333-World-Legal/dp/B00IJ93WW2/ To be clear: THIS IS NOT AN EVERYDAY CARRY. Whilst the knife is technically UK legal I suspect that it looks way too aggressive to not be confiscated on sight or worse. If I'm out and about I probably have the Swiss as those are generally acceptable (though I've still received shocked gasps on producing the Swiss for someone to borrow some scissors). If I'm going to the woods for the day/weekend I would take this. Certainly it's by me when I work from home.  -8. PXS-14 Southord 14 Piece Lock Pick Set  http://www.amazon.co.uk/PXS-14-SouthOrd-Piece-Lock-Pick/dp/B00GQ765R8/ I'll detail this below as I think everyone should own one of these even if they don't EDC it.  Some caveats here: you can get in trouble for having one of these if you look a bit shifty and might get charged with ""Going equipped..."" or something to that effect. Some places around the world do restrict ownership. In the UK, so long as you're not operating for money without a locksmith liscence or otherwise causing trouble you should be good. If I have my backpack, there is a good chance these are in a side pocket. The simplest thing to do is to carry some spare locks with it as ""locksport"" is a thing and I frequently play/practice with these without trouble. Far more acceptable than carrying a knife in my experience.  -9. ThruNite T30S V2  http://www.amazon.co.uk/ThruNite®-T30S-V2-Momentay--Multifunctional/dp/B00N8MNIJ2/ My latest addition. If the Amazon page still lists this at £91.89: I paid way less for this. This is just fantastic. Beautiful, high quality, lovely to hold, brilliantly bright, strobe mode, and with a suitable bezel for clocking someone if you had to. I'd far prefer having this in my hand than a knife.     Finally, I also have a paracord bracelet with fire-starter but I tend not to wear because I feel like they look a bit try-hard sometimes."
EDC,3e21wj,wat_waterson,3,Tue Jul 21 10:34:17 2015 UTC,"Why lock picks? For a start, you'll realise how futile most security is to a determined attacker. But they're also very useful. I've picked into my ""security"" cabinet when I forgot to bring my keys to work. Opened doors with lost keys. Gas tanks for my brother's bike. Rescued broken keys. Much of this saves time and money. It's fun and most people can learn to use the basics in a day or less. It took me an afternoon with an hour or so pre-reading. Getting great takes years. Getting competent enough to open most of the locks you're likely to encounter takes no time at all.   Group 1:  L-Rake. C-Rake. Short Hook Pick. These are your bread and butter. For most people, a day of reading and practice is enough to become proficient enough with these three tools that you'll be able to open 95% of the locks a normal person is likely to encounter in under 15 minutes maximum. Most often much quicker.   If you want to develop the skill; the short hook is you primary tool. But as a peice of emergency kit for a novice; the rakes will likely be your first port of call for simplicities sake, falling back onto single pin picking if needed.  Group 2:  W-Rake. Diamond Pick.  Sometimes the L or C-Rake just aren't working and for some reason a particular lock just seems to work faster with this rake. I primarily use the diamond when working in VERY narrow keyways where even the short hook won't fit. Some people prefer these. Personally, I find them too awkward.  Group 3:  Ball Pick. Half Ball Pick. The Wafer unlockers. Wafer locks (the kind used on basically every locker and filing cabinet) are almost always the simplest locks to pick requiring, in many cases, no skill whatsoever. The pins are like little sliding panels. You put the tension wrench in, push them all down till you feel them ""click"" (often in no particular order, unlike normal locks), and that's it. Sometimes these locks do require pressure on the panel at the back of the keyway. Hence, the half ball can become preferable if the keyway is small. But in most cases, either of these two will open a wafer lock with some uncoordinated wiggling.  Group 4:  Long Hook Pick. Key Extractor. I don't believe that I have EVER used the long hook as it's almost always too large for the keyway but you never know when you'll encounter that one situation. I've used the key extractor once. It works exactly like it sounds. If someone breaks their key off in the door: you can reach in and pull it out.  Tension Wrenches:  Used to apply turning pressure on the lock, allowing you to feel which pins to press. Possibly the component that requires the most skill in many situations. For example, old rusty locks can be almost completely unresponsive to these, necessitating more complex attacks. The left two have been modified with short ends to allow tension to be provided without filling the keyway making picking smaller locks easier. The bottom right is also twisted to allow different pressure to be applied.  The double-ended pick; I've never quite understood why it was included. It's just a duplicate of two other tools..."
EDC,3e21wj,wat_waterson,3,Tue Jul 21 10:34:23 2015 UTC,"Glad to see such a detailed descriptions of all your picks on here! A lot of us think the double ended tool is for slim carry, like if you want to carry it around without taking the whole set with you. It's not the best to pick with but will work in a pinch!"
EDC,3e21wj,vehementvelociraptor,3,Tue Jul 21 15:36:51 2015 UTC,A lot of us think the double ended tool is for slim carry   That's what I suspect. But why those picks?! Give me an L-Rake and a Short Hook any day over a pseudo-W-Rake and a Diamond.
EDC,3e21wj,PriceZombie,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:47:57 2015 UTC,I don't know. SouthOrd is known for making some really weird picks that nobody ever finds a use for. I'd rather carry my Bogota set with me than use that.
EDC,3e21wj,esquilax,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:51:05 2015 UTC,I cannot for the life of me get anywhere with a hook.  The diamond is usually my fallback and I can always complete it with that.  I need more practice apparently.

EDC,3dzbc2,FrazzleMazzle,5,Mon Jul 20 21:21:12 2015 UTC,Yeah I looked into it a while back. You can buy like a 'criminal identifier spray' which basically just stains the hypothetical attacker in a red dye which doesn't come off for days. It doesn't actually burn them or anything from what I know but I'm sure it'll surprise the hell out of them. They go for about a tenner on Amazon.

EDC,3dzbc2,BZJGTO,5,Mon Jul 20 21:38:14 2015 UTC,"Honestly, if you aren't more routinely at risk (even if an attack doesn't occur) of needing to defend yourself I don't think it's worth it to carry an actual weapon.  If your not regularly doing skill maintenance in addition to tool maintenance then a knife (assuming the UK) is going to be of little use to you in an emergency situation. At least in the US you could go to the gun range. In the UK, your more reliant on physical prowess/skill even with a weapon. And whilst it might scare off someone less worrisome; you introduce a knife into a situation with one massive crazy dude who doesn't give a fuck or many people who gang up on you: you could end up coming out way worse off.  I'd lean towards something like one of those tactical pens or a solid flashlight. A flashlight in particular, with a good strobe, might be enough to give you opportunity to get running. Worse case scenario; you've still got a heavy weight to clout someone with without needing very much skill to understand how that works."

The one I have is bodyglide, and you rub it on areas that chafe (e.g. inner thighs, ankles etc) and it forms a protective barrier so the skin doesn't rub. I use it so that my thighs don't chafe when I'm wearing skirts and it can be used to prevent blisters and such.  I bought it last year from Camden market, so I'm afraid I can't direct you to a particular shop but the brand is LYDC if that helps.

On a bigger one like this, it gives me something to grab if the knife is in, rather than clipped to my pocket. It also is the way I open and close my knives when I use them near my grandkids.

A little pricier but seems more organized, streamlined and not so overly tacticool. Plus those side pockets seem like they would be big enough to fit a couple 1L bottles nicely."

EDC,3dy1ot,MalaclypseTheYunger,8,Tue Jul 21 09:24:19 2015 UTC,"I think the best advice is to take a swiss army knife if you want a knife/multi-tool.   If it looks like a ""weapon"" the police are liable to confiscate it, potentially fine you or worse, regardless of whether it's ""technically legal"" or not. Unfortunately, even if it's legal, this is still mostly at their discretion.  At least in the case of a swiss army knife it comes with an associated use and bias. You might still get it confiscated if you look a bit shifty but I'd suspect that would be your worst case scenario with a swiss army."

The cutter in this tool is razor sharp and nicely serrated, and you can easily get it under someones clothes without cutting them because of the way it curves.

EDC,3du9cn,Natanael_L,2,Sun Jul 19 21:11:36 2015 UTC,"The law states a ~$150 fine or 7 days in jail for a knife that ""can be opened with one hand"" and/or exceeds ~2.75"" in length. The police itself got caught in that law when it was passed. The Wave is a damn nice tool to carry, but despite being issued a 9mm HK USP it would be illegal for an officer to carry a Wave. They solved that problem by making a multitool an optional part of the officer's individual equipment.  As for the law itself you'd be hard pressed to find anyone who doesn't think it's retarded, but you'd be equally hard pressed to find a politician who'd vote to relax a law that ""keeps weapons off the streets"".  I like my security clearance and the other weapons permits I have, so I play nice and sent my Wave to Leatherman Denmark for (free!) refit when the first part of the law was passed. That gave me a Wave with the same knives but no cutout for one-handed opening - there's a traditional nail-groove instead. When the second part of the law passed a few years later I ground off the tab that locks the knife open, and sawed off part of the blade to keep it short enough to be legal. In short I made my multitool less safe to use because some retarded politicians thought they could score a few points on ""restricting those dangerous weapons people use"".  Luckily there's a general movement to relax the knife laws in general. Especially after ordinary people have been fined for silly things like forgetting to remove a box cutter from their trunk when driving a work-van home, and people are unsure if they can legally take a knife along to cut the cake they brought to work. (You can do that since there an ""approved use"" for the knife and you only transport it to/from the place of use, but it'd be illegal if you stopped for coffee on the way).  tl,dr: Danish knife laws are retarded."

EDC,3dvbgw,rdmfx,4,Sun Jul 19 20:43:36 2015 UTC,"My current EDC for the past couple of weeks. I often work from home, but when I work on site this is what I carry.   In the rectangle is my usual EDC without taking a rucksack.   i phone 5S (i take the charging cable too) French Connection wallet, a gift. Smells like plastic, looking to replace asap. Ray Ban sunglasses, unsure of the model. Victorinox Classic, usually a Minichamp.  Carmex or a lip balm.  Omega Seamaster wristwatch Keys on a long lanyard with a bottle opener in the shape of a foot.   Now things on me with a work bag   zip up pencil wallet with various pencils, a couple of pens and an eraser Spyderco Man-bug or sometimes an UKPK. Because this locks I keep this inside the wallet, for sharpening pencils.  a sketchbook, this one was from Magnoli Clothiers.  USB stick. Used to carry a hard drive too but don't anymore. Faber Castell Propelling pencil Lamy 2000 fountain pen with Pelikan black ink Fenix LD12 torch 2011 15"" Macbook Pro and damaged charger. This is my 3rd charger and I really don't to buy another so this is fixed with Sugru.  Incase backpack. Not the most practical, but less bulky than others I've had.  Wacom tablet. I rarely use this for the current work I've been doing, so I have a very basic model. May upgrade in the future."
EDC,3dvbgw,KaBar42,5,Sun Jul 19 20:44:09 2015 UTC,"Spyderco Man-bug or sometimes an UKPK. Because this locks I keep this inside the wallet, for sharpening pencils.   Are you not worried about police finding it? I was under the impression that the UK police are terrified of any locking knife, even if your pencil's more dangerous then it."
EDC,3dvbgw,MusicalShark,3,Sun Jul 19 21:14:54 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't carry it in my pocket, as it would be out of context. But I have a justifiable work reason for carrying a small locking knife in my bag with pencils so, according to the law, it's legal.   I can't really second guess it beyond that point. If a cop's gonna have a problem with a man-bug, he's gonna have a problem with a Vic Soldier, or the UKPK as well (which looks more aggressive to me, although technically legal to carry without any reason). At the end of everything, I need to carry a pocket knife, it's legal to carry it with reason, and the chances of getting searched to and from my way to work by a London cop who's got a hard on for arresting people with teeny, tiny penknives? I don't lose sleep over it."
EDC,3dvbgw,KaBar42,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:38:11 2015 UTC,What is the cultural reason behind laws like these?
EDC,3dvbgw,mthrow_,2,Sun Jul 19 23:58:12 2015 UTC,"From what I read, a guy was arrested for a sub 3 inch locker.  The prosecution successfully argued that him carrying a locking blade effectively turned it into a fixed.  An appeal judge said the law was never designed to ban locking blades under 3 inches. However, due to a technicality in the way the appeal was filed, the appeal was thrown out and ever since then it's been case law. The only people who are able to overturn this law now is Parliament, But that'll never happen."
EDC,3dvbgw,BananaHamSalad,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:35:55 2015 UTC,"I personally think knives should be more legal, but your reason for having it ""sharpening pencils"", isn't really justified in my opinion, it would be like taking a flamethrower camping because you need to heat some water."
EDC,3dvbgw,BananaHamSalad,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:52:58 2015 UTC,"I think that analogy is a bit stretched for a sub 2 inch blade that is in, my opinion, the ideal tool for sharpening artists pencils. It's also in there frequently with a cutting mat for use on rough watercolour paper that bends and blunts exacto blades too quickly.   I also carried a box cutter to art college every day for a year, a few years ago. Had my bags checked frequently by security staff and put through scanners (the college was near a tourist spot). Never so much as an eyebrow raised.  Context is everything. We all have to make our own decisions, based on our work and usage."

EDC,3dw4df,insepsis,2,Mon Jul 20 14:21:12 2015 UTC,"THIS. It's a knife, it's a tool. I have a feeling most people on here but a $300 knife just to say they have it but never really use it when they could. I still wouldn't buy a gerber (there are plenty of decent label companies that make good knives). And apparently owning a BMW means you have loads of money when you can own a decent condition E39/E46 can be had for about $2-2500"

They are decent knives, and can do most tasks that need to be done, but they may not hold up over the years. I think what most people here are trying to say is, it's better to spend a few extra bucks for something a little bit higher quality that's gonna last me longer rather than constantly replacing a cheaper product."

I usually oil it with coconut oil, but if that isn't available, I just rub my fingers on my forehead to grab some oil off my face and rub that on the blade."

EDC,3dv5p7,ChetSt,2,Mon Jul 20 11:51:14 2015 UTC,"Mine is developing a beautiful patina as well. That's a large part of the reason I got the carbon steel over stainless.  And I'm mostly using it as a steak knife to cut food as I eat it for myself, or for my girlfriend who would happily lick my forehead if I asked her to. If I were to use it as a food prep knife to prepare a meal for a larger group, I would probably wash it with soap and water first.  Because I don't just use forehead oil on it. If I need to wash food off it and I don't have a sink handy, I'll lick my fingers and rub the blade down with my saliva. It's great for dissolving food. Wipe it off on shirt (which I need to be more careful with, that thing is sharp as hell and put holes in a few of my shirts before I noticed), finish of with some forehead oil, and it's ready to go back in my pocket!"
