lifeisstrange,3e3byx,ThreadOfFate,11,Tue Jul 21 17:13:09 2015 UTC,"Legitimately one of my favorite scenes in the entire game.  So well done.  Great writing, great animations (they got what matters), so much character building and development.  This scene is what Life Is Strange is about - there's time travel and missing people and strangeness and assholes, but at the core of the game, it's Max and Chloe.  Their relationship, romantic or not, is what drives the game, and it's such a real, human depiction of two people."
lifeisstrange,3e3byx,snhl,5,Tue Jul 21 17:15:00 2015 UTC,"I've mentioned this elsewhere but I totally agree-- the pool scene caught me off guard with its subtleties, mostly from Chloe. It really reminded me of times when reality seems dreamy.   The morning after was also so perfectly peaceful, kind of poignant."
lifeisstrange,3e3byx,ineedtoremeber,3,Tue Jul 21 18:27:34 2015 UTC,Can I just say that this whole scene really made me squirm as a swimmer. I know that putting on chlorine filled we clothes on chlorine skin is the most awful feeling ever. Blegh when your skin dries out and you start sweating it's actually the worst.
lifeisstrange,3e3byx,Akilice,2,Tue Jul 21 19:57:44 2015 UTC,"What a beautiful artwork for a beautiful scene. I love this artist and love to read their farron sisters comics, so it feels wonderful to see this skilled artist drawing for LiS too :D <3"
lifeisstrange,3e3byx,DinosaurWrangler,2,Tue Jul 21 22:30:32 2015 UTC,Clicked the link and then realized it was already in my favorites. :) This is one of my favorite artists. Their LightningxFang work and FFXIII comics are also beautiful so check them out if you've played that game!

lifeisstrange,3e2mct,octokitty76,12,Tue Jul 21 14:33:15 2015 UTC,"Well.. Dontnod is most definitely finished with EP4 unless they are the laziest developers ever.  They posted this tweet 15th July. It can't take them 6 days to ""apply final touches"" unless they are using ""final touches"" in a very wrong way.  So it's Square Enix we have to stare at now, not Dontnod. They have been applying updates to Episode 5 as shown on their SteamDB page so they are done with EP4.  Please refer to this post if you don't understand the SteamDB stuff.  If any updates to EP4 comes, then it's them applying bug fixes or minor changes as a result from the developers playing EP4 to check for things that can be changed and bugs etc..  So yea, unless that tweet was very misleading and untrue, they are done with EP4."
lifeisstrange,3e2mct,TweetsInCommentsBot,4,Tue Jul 21 14:46:31 2015 UTC,"Well... They just tweeted this...  ""Last bits"" and ""Final touches"" mean basically the same, so yeah it's been one week working on these"
lifeisstrange,3e2mct,TweetsInCommentsBot,5,Tue Jul 21 15:02:54 2015 UTC,"Most likely those ""last bits"" is things they decided to change/stuff they had to fix after ""proof playing"" EP4. I doubt that they are working on the same final touches they mentioned 15th July."

lifeisstrange,3e1ovd,theDrkillshot32,17,Tue Jul 21 07:27:31 2015 UTC,Polarize can also mean dividing something into two opposing camps or choices. Given that much of the game has been about us making choices I think that's the more likely meaning for the episode title because at some point we are going to have to make a choice that leads to one ending or another.
lifeisstrange,3e1ovd,LilianH,9,Tue Jul 21 07:41:42 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I think it implies that there are two complete endings for the game."

lifeisstrange,3e1ovd,stathicus,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:40:12 2015 UTC,"Light wiggles in multiple directions. Generally in vertical and horizontal directions. Polarized filters take unpolarized light, and blocks out the wiggles that are opposite of the filter. If you look close at some 3d glasses from theaters, you'll see little slats like you see with mini blinds.  You can use polarized filters to block certain lighting conditions to get some cool effects. The sky tends to be polarized in one direction, and you can use polarized filters to either allow, or block, that light. You can take pictures of water and reflections that either reflect the sky, or make it so you see no reflection of the sky and see into the water.  I think the title might hint that there is more than one ending, since that's what polarized lighting/filters do, allow for multiple lighting conditions to change the feel of a photo.  By the way, I love playing with polarized filters. I hope I still have some 3d glasses so I can make a new filter for my camera. If you use two perpendicular to each other, one on your flash, the other on your lenses, you can totally eliminate flash reflections. Perfect for night shots of highly reflective surfaces."
lifeisstrange,3e1ovd,m4xwellmurd3r,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:49:08 2015 UTC,"I always thought it by polarized meant by two opposite polls on the earth, which represents the choices. Until I remembered the polarized camera.  For the episode 4 title, it refers to the episode ""processing"" itself to a picture (I like to think the picture as time frames and the current state of the world) so a lot of shit is gonna go down and we will see many more consequences of our choices, to ""segway"" into Episode 5.  And as you said, polarized filters ""darken"" the image, so everything might go bad and very wrong in the last episode 5, maybe a super choice-consequence regret."

lifeisstrange,3e1ovd,grossglockner,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:23:44 2015 UTC,"In the three-video series the developers said something along 'there are no good or bad choices' so every decision you make will of course affect the future but there are advantages for some people and disadvantages for others. I think episode 5 will take this principle to a climax including pretty major decisions and that is why it's called 'Polarized'. It also keeps the dual meaning since it refers to photography, like you described."

Sounds like Episode 4 was met with some serious development problems if it's being released well outside the projected release window.  Don't be complacent with sloppy game development. They should be keeping their audience (who has already paid for the episode) up to date with specific and non-vague information. But they continue to withhold the release date in what I assume is a marketing tactic.  People have a right to be frustrated and annoyed with Dontnod. Whether or not it's helpful is another thing, but don't be so quick to dismiss Dontnod's obvious shortcomings and peoples' anger."
lifeisstrange,3dzwin,ColdBlackCage,2,Tue Jul 21 13:25:50 2015 UTC,"My source is the fact that this is literally how game development works. Once development is finished, a game is out of the Dev's hands. They said a week ago that they were putting the finishing touches on episode 4, that would have been the last few bugfixes before shipping out the finished build to Squeenix.   It's not sloppy development, it's a publisher most likely either trying to get through microsoft and sony's stupid process for the console release or else squeenix are just holding it for a certain time because they have some different ideas about when it should be released."
lifeisstrange,3dzwin,evetscipe,26,Tue Jul 21 16:03:26 2015 UTC,"Here's my headcanon of the story, after reading through the changelogs on SteamDB.  They started crunch-time for EP4 around mid-June.  Things got hectic around July 7. There was no daily build at all for the first time in weeks. They had sticky problems that were solved late at night, and the new build happened on the 8th at 8:30am. Hopefully a good build. They spent the day testing and testing, and it was a good build. Very promising.  Thursday July 9th was the tipping point. In the morning, they submitted the first ""final version"" of the episode for approval by Microsoft & Sony. Unfortunately, they found new difficult issues during the day and spent the entire day and most of the night on them, clocking at 10:30pm (edit: UTC. So actually 12:30am Paris time, my bad). These issues were the straw that broke the planning's back, and they were still there the next day.   At around 7:00pm (edit: UTC -> 9:00pm Paris time) on Friday 10th, someone with a brain probably said: ""Guys, keep calm and rest. Go on long week-end with your families, celebrate Bastille day, come back on Wednesday and finish it. We won't have EP4 out before the Develop Awards ceremony, big deal. We missed our 6-8 weeks guideline, big deal. Take all the time you need, finish the best EP we've ever made, and ship it when it's done.""  And so that's what they're doing. And that's what they're saying, too, like it or not. It's hard to understand when the planning is left up to the Devs: they're the worst at communicating these things, but that's also when they truly shine at what they do best.  I'll let you in on a secret about devspeak: ""Soon"" means ""when it's done, stop bugging me about it, I have work to do"". Yeah, devs are terrible at handling customers, I agree.  With that said, I believe the episode is complete now, so there's that."
lifeisstrange,3dzwin,AwesomeDewey,9,Mon Jul 20 22:54:47 2015 UTC,"I guess I'm kinda confused, uninformed, and not understanding why a game being released this way seems like it's being literally worked on into the last minute. I mean I know major AAA releases are quality tested up until just weeks before the release, but this is a bit different with a smaller company and episodic release schedule. I was aware of life is strange a few months before its release. I guess I was kinda under the assumption that most of the game was pretty much completed upon the release of Episode 1. But apparently that's not how they do it? Why or why not? Is it so they can change things based on the feedback they get from players and tweak the game, mechanics, or story based on that feedback?  It kinda comes off as that they are just making it up as they go. Is that due to the nature of the game? Like most normal games kinda have a set narrative structure, but since this is a game that's (supposedly) changing based on player choice does that mean they've changed things between episodes? And that's what's going on? I don't know. I was kinda surprised to hear a couple weeks ago about how they were JUST now recording voice work for episodes 4 & 5. That seems like something that would have been done a while ago. I would think in the weeks just before a targeted release window they'd be doing final tweaks and testing.   This probably shows an incredible lack of insight on my part into the video game business, when I've always thought I knew a little bit about it."
lifeisstrange,3dzwin,DavidLovato,14,Mon Jul 20 23:53:30 2015 UTC,"I'm not exactly ""in the game business"" per se but I might be able to offer a little insight, or at least some possible answers to your questions (it really depends on the developer, in the end).   not understanding why a game being released this way seems like it's being literally worked on into the last minute.   I kind of think maybe it being worked on up to the last minute is why it's being released this way. I think Dontnod went in with the ability to basically throw together the bare minimum if the episodes didn't sell well, but to expand and push harder if they found success, and that the latter is happening. I really feel like each episode is re-inventing the game I'm playing, rather than just being a new 2-3 hour stretch of the same thing. So I think they're implementing new ideas as they go based on feedback received after / money made from previous episodes.   since this is a game that's (supposedly) changing based on player choice does that mean they've changed things between episodes?   Episode 1 hinted at things that happen in episode 3. I think there's probably a little leeway there, but for the most part the story is written and they're just finding new ways to present it through gameplay. I would also say that changes are happening behind the scenes; usually before a new episode drops, an update for the old ones comes out to make them compatible.   was kinda surprised to hear a couple weeks ago about how they were JUST now recording voice work for episodes 4 & 5.   Voice work is one of the last things you want to do. You don't want to record a scene, go to program it, then find out something broke and you either have to throw out some or all of that scene, or re-hire the actors and bring them back in to say different lines. Normally this is a bigger problem for games with proper lip sync, but even without it can be a big issue. The thing is, developers are always around. Actors aren't. You don't want to do something like record all the lines, find out a story arc doesn't work or something breaks the game, then, say, try to get Ashly Burch to come back in and voice new lines only to find out she can't because she's working on Borderlands DLC or something, then you have to scramble to fix it by working out a new schedule or hiring a different actress and disappointing fans.  I remember when I played the Elder Scrolls Online beta, like 90% of the voices were text-to-speech robots because they hadn't started work on that area yet. Even then, when I played it on PS4 the other day, I'm pretty sure at one point the Prophet was suddenly Jim Cummings instead of Michael Gambon because something apparently goofed up in development. And when Haley Joel Osment did his AMA a while back they asked him about Kingdom Hearts III and he mentioned that voice acting was one of the last things they do in development. Take into account how Dontnod is a French studio, and you have the addition of different time zones and language barriers to deal with, so the less re-hiring they have to do the better, which usually means the later they do voice recording, the better.  You also have to wonder what it means. ""Working on recording for episodes 4 and 5"" might mean they're having random Dontnod employees record lines said by random passersby on the streets of Arcadia Bay. It's entirely possible we're reading too much into that statement.  As far as release windows go, it's a double-edged sword on the development side of things. Something that seems tiny and inconsequential can entirely break your game. There's so much testing and debugging and testing and debugging and re-writing and re-coding, it can be a nightmare, and the truth is you aren't finished until you're finished. So you have fans who want a release window, and it sucks if you try to tell them ""I'll be done in two weeks"" and then thirteen days later something breaks your opening sequence and you have to re-code the whole thing, and then something in that re-working breaks your middle act etc.  So you can try to tell fans a window, but that increases your pressure to meet it, or you can be silent about it and then fans complain of lack of communication. It's kind of a no-win scenario for developers, especially smaller ones. As a fan it sucks to hear ""We're working on it"" but that's probably the truest thing the devs can say; any date they give is going to be a guess at best, or at worst, a date imposed that they have to meet even if it means the quality of the game suffers.  Edit: sorry you're getting downvoted; I thought those were pretty reasonable questions, personally."
lifeisstrange,3dzwin,lislislislislis,4,Tue Jul 21 00:47:28 2015 UTC,IDK about the larger game industry but Dontnod in particular was literally in bankruptcy when they made this game.  They probably would have gone under completely if they had tried to finish all five episodes without selling anything. AFAIK the upfront sales have been funding the later episodes.
lifeisstrange,3dzwin,dynoraptor,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:06:51 2015 UTC,"In software there are 'always' a lot of major bugs from individual developers that are difficult to plan in advance. Different groups work on different pieces. Then when all the pieces are fit together in the end, new bugs arise, making developers work overtime. That's my experience at least. Also in the start of the project there is always high pressure from highest management to shorten the planning."
lifeisstrange,3dzwin,natedoggcata,7,Tue Jul 21 23:13:40 2015 UTC,Keep in mind that it also has to go through both Sony and Microsofts approval process which can take a while. They probably arent giving us a release cause they probably dont know themselves

I understand that simultaneous release would be nice but if Sony/Microsoft is too slow why do they both need to suffer? (Is it in a contract somewhere?)  Maybe if Microsoft was too slow and they release it for Sony's platforms then Microsoft would want to get their approval process faster?
lifeisstrange,3dzwin,natedoggcata,4,Mon Jul 20 23:22:29 2015 UTC,You really want a game like this to have different release dates for different consoles?   Lets say Sony gets it first and Microsoft gets it a week later. You would have to dodge the spoiler minefield for a week if you were on Xbox

I mean the content specifically, rather than technical problems. The games have touched on some rather dark themes before. I can't find an ESRB rating for Episode 4 yet on the ESRB website. I'm not sure when that's supposed to be posted there, but I imagine it should be ahead of the release of the episode."

Isn't it better to enjoy waiting? I read great theories here everyday and things pointed out I totally overlooked. It's all about the learning, discussion & connection that was created.  Once ep4 comes out you will play it in one day and start asking about ep5, and then it's all over. I can hear them now: They have to make season 2, when is it coming?"

It was the poor choice of words that spun everyone into a frenzy. We are only waiting on the announcement of a release date, not the actual game. From whenever that announcement is made we may still have like a week of waiting.   It's not like they didn't know what the ""rumored"" release dates were. They were the ones who said they were on schedule in the first place. They've been 3 for 3 in terms of hitting their 6-8 week window with past releases. So naturally people had expectations that they would do it again.   I get it. Delays happen. Maybe it's out of their hands. Maybe it's just not done yet. Would it have been so hard to just say there is a delay? Honesty goes a long way with people, especially when your fanbase loves you for what you've done so far."

Give yourself a bit of a break from all the falderal, that way when it does hit you'll be nice and refreshed and ready to dive into a brand new episode.  I certainly plan on taking my own advice after posting this…y'all are just driving me a bit nuts with the impatience."

You've paid money for a product that doesn't exist yet, so to expect it to be released when promised is perfectly reasonable."

Maybe a week, two weeks, three weeks, four weeks extra waiting time will turn out to be worth it. Would you rather they put out a glitchy, half baked episode? I wouldn't. I get what you're saying, but I think you should look on the bright side a little bit more."

lifeisstrange,3e0703,ixron64,4,Tue Jul 21 02:36:34 2015 UTC,"It's common in most story based games because ep1 is the character introductions, so it's a lot of story starters and ""this is how X knows Y"" and ""here is a long section about all the different people in X town"".  I find these bits boring but vital for the narrative later on."
lifeisstrange,3e0703,dannyesson,4,Tue Jul 21 07:34:34 2015 UTC,"Personally in the first 10 minutes I was regretting buying the title in the first place.   I kind of took a gamble with this game, as I bought it without having even the slightest clue about what would happen. I enjoyed The Walking Dead and The Wolf Among Us, so why shouldn't I buy a similar game praised for its originality.  At first I was playing as this introverted, mildly boring teenage girl spacing out during a... photography lesson? Interesting. The diary isn't the most exciting I've read. In addition, I already want to punch about 90% of the characters in the face.   Then the bathroom scene happens, and it only gets better from there. Being able to rewind, that's something everyone has fantasized at least once in their lives.  Can't wait for E4."

lifeisstrange,3e055j,sashimi_taco,16,Mon Jul 20 22:56:06 2015 UTC,"I think it's a visual way to bring up a recurring theme around her character:  Everything about her is incredibly plain yet incredibly special at the same time.  The shirt means that she acknowledges that she's an average teenage girl, but come on: anyone who has the sense of humor to wear that shirt has gotta be an awesome chick!  In a way, her main struggle throughout the episodes so far has been to find thecourage to assert that uniqueness of hers. Notice that by episode two, her shirt doesn't have the ""Jane"" anymore, but keeps the doe. And episode 3 could be seen as a regression because Rachel's clothes..."
lifeisstrange,3e055j,Summerfell1,14,Mon Jul 20 23:22:47 2015 UTC,"Chloe says that Max doesn't have a style yet. But I feel like Max does, and that Chloe was just trying to find a Rachel replacement in that moment.   But lots of teen girls ""try on"" other people's identities. To see which one is good. As soon as she put the clothes on, she started being more of an instigator. Almost mean sometimes."
lifeisstrange,3e055j,zzTimTVzz,7,Mon Jul 20 23:32:44 2015 UTC,"Like Dontnod said, the game shows the progression through a teenager's life. Since Max is the main character, it makes complete sense to have the guiding entity be something that symbolizes a blank canvas, something pure that can lead to anywhere... I've been listening to Samuel too much."
lifeisstrange,3e055j,m4xwellmurd3r,5,Mon Jul 20 23:46:09 2015 UTC,"Max is kind of an asshole, to be honest. I think the only reason people overlook this is because she's the main character, and because she's a woman/girl. I had to explain her actions in the context of other male characters in movies for people to understand that she's kind of an asshole."
lifeisstrange,3e055j,goutthescout,7,Mon Jul 20 23:47:42 2015 UTC,"Max sort of isn't an asshole. At all. She's a normal girl thats trying to make sense of this fucked up world and her new found powers.   Also, she's only really an asshole if you made the choices to make her an asshole"
lifeisstrange,3e055j,bleeters,6,Tue Jul 21 02:18:57 2015 UTC,"Just because you relate to her, doesn't make the things she does good.  Did you rewind to make Taylor like you and pretend you knew about her mom, when you really didn't?  Did you touch Dana's pregnancy and then rewind time to make Dana never know you snooped? Then proceed to say ""i'm not the kind of person who snoops don't worry""  Did you spill paint on victoria?  Did you rewind time to make Juliet think you knew her last name, when you actually didn't?  Do you ever use time to get people to tell you things with knowledge that they didn't know you took from them?   The answer is yes. You use a power over another human, who has no defense against it. You took advantage of other people for gain. Be it for ""good"" or ""evil"". You shouldn't play god with other people. They are not toys."
lifeisstrange,3e055j,spongyruler,12,Tue Jul 21 02:26:14 2015 UTC,"Perhaps people becoming more like playthings and less like people will be something that Max starts seeing. We already see it a bit with Frank at the diner. Actions start to have no consequences for her.  Max even acknowledges this in a journal entry where she wanted to smack Nathan's head against the desk, realized she could and then just rewind, then realized that is a slippery slope.   It's easy to lose respect for other people when you can manipulate them to the degree Max can. When she can predict the actions of others based on her input it starts to seem like people don't have free will. It is Max's will which dictates their actions. People become mere puppets in her theater."
lifeisstrange,3e055j,m4xwellmurd3r,6,Tue Jul 21 03:37:30 2015 UTC,Yeah I don't think people realize the extent of Max's powers.

To be fair, I only did that because the game forced me to if I wanted to mention it at all, which felt incredibly bizarre. I don't think there's anything inherently insidious about asking Taylor if she's ok about something she herself brought up moments ago that kinda sounds like it'd be a big deal. Why Max even needs to rewind to bring it up is beyond me."
lifeisstrange,3e055j,zzTimTVzz,2,Tue Jul 21 03:23:31 2015 UTC,"In regards to spilling paint on Victoria, Victoria is an asshole and kind of deserved it. Secondly, is there a way to get her to move without spilling paint on her?"

Didn't need to find out using her powers.  That still doesn't make you an asshole. And I did feel bad about the paint thing. But she asked for it.  And in reality, if Max had better anayzling skills, most of the info she could've found on her own. Her skills make finding out the information ridiculously fast though.  But the game wants us to use her power"
lifeisstrange,3e055j,zzTimTVzz,3,Tue Jul 21 02:29:03 2015 UTC,"You do have to do most of those things. More than half of those examples you have to do to progress the story.   And from what I've read and played of Dontnod's other works, all of max's manipulation of other people is going to blow up in her face. It's a common theme in their works. To use the power of a god on other people, and it causing pain and suffering. Despite having ""good intentions"", because treating others without respect for them is actually a bad thing.   But she asked for it.   She was just sitting there being a shit head. That is not an excuse to throw paint on someone."

lifeisstrange,3e055j,catnipcatnip,2,Tue Jul 21 00:38:37 2015 UTC,"Wait, what do you mean by misleading Warren? Do you mean that she's leading him on? Because I was under the impression that (at least, according to how I've played) Max likes being friends with Warren and spending time with him, and while she isn't completely oblivious to the fact that he likes her, she doesn't really get it. Max didn't agree to watch the movie with him because she wants to lead him on, but because she thinks it'll be cool to watch a movie with a friend."

Just because Max is ""Going Ape"" with Warren to ""watch a movie with a friend"", doesn't mean Warren isn't going there to try and take their relationship to the next level. He likes Max more than she chooses to see. Last time I checked, that's leading someone on..."
lifeisstrange,3e055j,zzTimTVzz,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:15:11 2015 UTC,"It's not leading him on. If anything, Warren is the creep in that situation.

Max flat out says she doesn't like him romantically. I really don't get why people are trying to put Warren as a viable canon romantic option when he isn't.

lifeisstrange,3e055j,Mercyva,6,Tue Jul 21 02:53:05 2015 UTC,"I feel like Max's powers are a metaphor for surveillance. You see david do the same kinds of messed up things as Max. He's seen as an asshole, while Max is not. Why? Because david can't cover his tracks with time travel.  It depends on what privacy you are willing to give up for safety. Some people are okay with the NSA skimming our email and stuff. While others are not willing to give up their privacy for safety.   It's not about your goal. It's about making everyone else give up their sense of control over themselves for the sake of you getting your goal."
lifeisstrange,3e055j,Mercyva,0,Tue Jul 21 04:05:17 2015 UTC,"The difference between David and Max is not just her rewind ability, but the fact that David creates assumptions where there's no reliable evidence (Harassing every student at Blackwell besides Nathan, because of something strange biase he has toward him.). Getting back to the original post, Max's spirit animal symbolizes that she's able to move through life's obstacles with grace. She becomes aware of people's sensitivities and can take that into consideration. If David just talked to students, he would've gained just as much data as Max has. He abuses his abilities as being head of ""Security"", using that position of power for a personal hobby. Max, though she has abused her power/becoming more like David in the sense of surveillance, is doing it for selfless reasons...or, at least, has the choice too."

lifeisstrange,3e2xpc,SkateboardCop,2,Tue Jul 21 15:44:47 2015 UTC,"I think that ""business as usual"" is still pretty far from the LiS font but it is a good replacement :) I think that it won't take long for the LiS community to find one that is exactly alike :D"
lifeisstrange,3e2xpc,SkateboardCop,2,Tue Jul 21 15:48:09 2015 UTC,"Chances are the title card is actually traced or inspired by this ""Whatnot"" font. It doesn't look like a real font since it has multiple colors and isn't super neat.  You can even use that link and see a live preview of the Whatnot font and try typing in ""Life is Strange"" to see the difference."
lifeisstrange,3e2xpc,SkateboardCop,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:48:44 2015 UTC,"Nice. It is a really close font but paying 20 bucks for fannart... yeah... well, if it was exactly alike I would probably end up using it for other stuff :)"

lifeisstrange,3e2xpc,ZeLzStorm,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:44:03 2015 UTC,Ya when I use the buisness as usual font I double it up so its thicker and it looks a bit closer to the actual font. The official font is available but I cant remember what exactly its called. I think it is around $25 though.

lifeisstrange,3e1f27,JForsakenL,5,Tue Jul 21 05:31:28 2015 UTC,I've played through this game three times each with a different mind set and try to stick to my choices.  With other episodic games the choices feel more like illusions than set each play through apart.  Life is strange makes me want to see how each choice changes things through the first three episodes.  So I can wait for my 3 playthroughs of ep 4
lifeisstrange,3e1f27,mikealwy,3,Tue Jul 21 05:37:38 2015 UTC,"I've played through the first three episodes six times, now, and if the wait for EP4 extends much longer, I'll likely go for seven just for the hell of it. Keep your first save file if you choose to replay. Though the first time is always the best, the game always seems to feel as magical to me as it did the first time around. If anything, I feel much closer to the characters now that I've been around them and studied them so much.  But then again, it's all personal. If you feel like replaying would ruin the closeness and originality of your first playthrough, then don't replay. I still intend on using my first playthrough's save file to finish the game, initially."
lifeisstrange,3e1f27,satanslittleghost,2,Tue Jul 21 06:19:02 2015 UTC,"I agree. The developers did an incredible job at making this game retain its magic despite playing multiple times. I never have been able to sit down and play a game over and over without getting bored after a while. I watched many a true nerd play the first couple episodes, but when I started playing it all felt fresh, new. I knew what was going to happen sort of, but there's so much to do, so many choices that actually make a difference, that I could play it multiple times and the timeline will always be different."
lifeisstrange,3e1f27,m4xwellmurd3r,2,Tue Jul 21 06:38:54 2015 UTC,I played through all 3 episodes twice. There were many decisions I didn't fully understand the first time and I ended up regretting some of them so I was very eager to play again! I also rushed through my first playthrough so I took more time to experience and explore the world the second time. I actually feel much closer to the characters and the setting because I understand them a lot more.
lifeisstrange,3e1f27,sleep_hero,2,Tue Jul 21 06:49:29 2015 UTC,"Well i wont play any episode more then once before i have completed the entire game just because of this. And also when i have completed the game i will have the luxary of playing through it all in a ""mini marathon"". Sure there are choices that i didnt wanna make or want to change but that for me is why the game is so good, I dont wanna play through it all because i know i will change so many things because of the information i have so far and things that i have missed. But you should do whatever feels right, waiting for EP4 feels like forever... :("

Take for example getting yourself on the vortex party list - doesn't really matter because it seems everyone will be able to go based on ep4 preview. As for replaying, i'm just replaying now to see dialogue changes but sticking with my first original playthrough."

lifeisstrange,3e1f27,Ara-Player,2,Tue Jul 21 09:06:02 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I can relate to people who play it over and over again but there is still a little voice in the game telling me ""you're making the game less interesting"" when I replay the game just to make different choices. That's why I recently replayed the game just to get all of my normal choices back, since I replayed and changed them so much it wouldn't be fun to see how they interact."
lifeisstrange,3e1f27,estradz21,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:47:09 2015 UTC,"That's what i was thinking.

Maybe i'll give it a try."

lifeisstrange,3e2brp,Matt_West,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:15:14 2015 UTC,I think the Tornado has something to do with Rachel's disappearance and this whole underlying mystery with Kate and the red binders rather than Chloe's death.

It also provides a pet peeve for Max to occasionally exploit, adding depth and insight into their relationship.  We don't have any information on how she texted before the accident, so speculation on that is pointless.  It's a strangely old-fashioned idea for a teen. It was a more common sentiment among people who did a lot of communication through text (e.g. internet denizens) in like, 2005. Not a common sentiment in 2013, by which it has become pretty standard and generally recognized as useful for clarifying tone.  e: that said, emojis have always been a particularly useful tool for getting laid. ""NO EMOJIS"" might be the best argument against Pricefield I've seen yet. It isn't a good one, but have you seen the others? :v"

lifeisstrange,3e0v6k,SomethingSimsy,7,Tue Jul 21 02:26:46 2015 UTC,"Interesting, but tbh it just looks like an oversight."
lifeisstrange,3e0v6k,GreatTornado,3,Tue Jul 21 06:02:30 2015 UTC,"I don't think it was a developer oversight, necessarily. Max's reactions to the Nathan shooting in the first iteration of Chloe's death were different from subsequent iterations.  The first time Max sees Chloe die, she shouts ""No!"" Remember, this is in a tiny bathroom (meaning it's going to sound pretty loud) and Nathan was under the impression that no one else was there. The sound was jarring and caused him to drop the gun sooner. Meanwhile in the next iteration, Max is totally quiet. He drops the gun, but it's slower because it takes him a moment to sink in that he just killed a girl. That shift in Max's reaction is what causes the change."
lifeisstrange,3e0v6k,Sebehr,2,Tue Jul 21 13:45:29 2015 UTC,This could really explain it. However I also think that this is just some oversight the devs had. Nothing more.
lifeisstrange,3e0v6k,portanix2,4,Tue Jul 21 15:58:11 2015 UTC,"Clearly an oversight, as much as the game focuses on detail every single theory like this is far overthinked. The first time it's actually a cutscene we get to watch but the 2nd time it's in the gameplay, so it's an animation error."
lifeisstrange,3e0v6k,Ara-Player,2,Tue Jul 21 09:36:08 2015 UTC,"Good eye, with all the small details they add, you never know if this is deliberate or not"
lifeisstrange,3e0v6k,HelloCringle,2,Tue Jul 21 09:04:18 2015 UTC,I have been saying this and no one cares to take me seriously (except for maybe a few people who have read my theories). These events are not in the same timeline. When Max gets the ability to rewind time that changes everything. In a normal timeline she wouldn't have the ability to rewind time (In the original timeline we would have Chloe shot) but since we can rewind time and we prevent it this changes everything  Of course im tired and this is just more crap Im saying until EP 4
lifeisstrange,3e0v6k,AERXihu,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:29:03 2015 UTC,"I think it's clear that the universe wants Chloe to die, she should have died when she got shot, but for some reason had the power to reverse time.  This is also kind of why the universe keeps trying to kill her. The universe is trying to correct itself. It sort of plays into fate. The universe was denied its death, and sort of via the butterfly effect, the torando is because of max trying to save chloe.   I think ep 4 will choose between chloe living and the town being destroyed, or chloe dead and the town being saved. I'm not sure how crippled chloe will play into this."
lifeisstrange,3e0v6k,Gvaz,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:01:30 2015 UTC,I would give a detailed response but I pretty much forgot a post I made before that responds to this so all i'm gonna say is I agree.
lifeisstrange,3e0v6k,AERXihu,0,Tue Jul 21 21:42:02 2015 UTC,"I pretty much have to agree. Think about chaos theory. Little changes might not have a big impact in the short term, but the changes are there. When she went back, she stole veronicas answer, and did the same with Jefferson. Tiny changes, tiny impact. There also has to be the possibility of a timeline where Chloe gets shot and Max didn't go to the bathroom to hide in the back."

lifeisstrange,3e0v6k,Jack_Markson,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:27:53 2015 UTC,"Yes, technically the timeline Chloe's shot is the original, but that would mean we would need to call everything else in the game alternate timeline, and what would we call the EP3 ending timeline? Alternate alternate timeline? No, it's just confusing so we stick with the timeline in the game being the original since it's the one we are in the most"
lifeisstrange,3e0v6k,Ara-Player,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:37:57 2015 UTC,"That won't make it the original timeline. That would just be the one we are used to. Which is why i refrain from using ""original"" or ""alternate"" timeline much. I simply classify them with numbers. 1st Timeline (The beginning of the game up to Chloe's death.) 2nd Timeline (We save Chloe from death in the bathroom) 3rd Timeline (Alternate Timeline). But honestly now that I think about it every single time we go back would spin off into its own timeline because that shouldn't have happened. So us saving Chloe from death each time creates something else. It honestly isn't really confusing if you pay attention closely.  Also assuming everything I have been saying (including other theories regarding timeline stuff) turns out to be correct that would mean that every rewind is simply us becoming conscious in another timeline and Max remembers nothing of it but doesn't notice a big change. (Someone else stated this in a theory I made but im just posting it because it makes sense to me and I added something at the end.)"

The first was when people kept thinking she looked like Rachel at first glance, and the second there was no Rachel (that we know of).  There definitely is something there w/r/t rachel and max and I think it's more than just a coincidence."

lifeisstrange,3dzcq1,kronj,2,Mon Jul 20 21:20:30 2015 UTC,"Or the whales beach themselves because the tornado is still coming. I feel like if Rachel has powers she's already dead, otherwise it'd be a weird and messed up timeline with even more possible plotholes and paradoxes."
lifeisstrange,3dzcq1,gybali,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:26:12 2015 UTC,"I've been considering Rachel as a fellow time-tinkerer since the beginning.  With Max's power you can go and explore everything and talk to everyone.  In the very start of the game, it seemed like everybody knew Rachel pretty well.  Even for a small school, there wasn't one person who said ""oh, I didn't know her all that well.""  Depending on the kind of person Rachel was, she might have gone back and forth in time, trying to know people and fix their little problems.  But, like how Max's actions have unintended consequences of bird/whale death, Rachel may have unwittingly caused a disaster of her own."
lifeisstrange,3dzcq1,signu1230,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:20:17 2015 UTC,"While your theory is possible, I'll be really disappointed if it's true.  The Rachel = time-traveller theory is a pretty common one, and I Just think it cheapens a lot of the mystery about Max and why she has the powers. Why she's the only time-travelling abomination in the world.  More people with powers, especially time travel, really weakens the impact of a lot of what Max is going through for me.  But I still won't rule anything out. I spent all of Remember Me hoping it'd end differently than it did, too."
lifeisstrange,3dzcq1,MainaC,3,Tue Jul 21 01:48:08 2015 UTC,"I agree, it does weaken it... but for me it's only if she still had the powers. If she had lost them and Max obtained the powers in her stead I would be okay with it.     Honestly though, I wouldn't want her to have powers. I was of the mindset that she might have them for a little while, but now that I've thought on it, I would prefer her to just be... ""normal""."
lifeisstrange,3dzcq1,SelicAltire,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:37:56 2015 UTC,This is pretty much the theory I made a few weeks ago with minor changes. I still think that the original timeline would be before Rachel  changed things with her power. If not then it would be when Chloe dies.

lifeisstrange,3dzqw6,AwesomeDewey,5,Mon Jul 20 21:10:21 2015 UTC,"The themes you have don't really match the achievements completely, sometimes they do and sometimes they don't. I'll do my best to define each term, then I'll talk about the corresponding photo to each achievement, but generally the achievements seem to match their optional photos more than an overall theme.   Macro Eyes: a close up photo of an eye, macro photography basically means making small things look really big  Wide Angles: a wide angle is basically getting a larger horizontal view, usually used in landscapes  Telephotogenic: means somebody or something looks nice in photos  Close-Ups: do y'all really need a definition?  Red Eye: this happens the flash is too close to the lens in low lighting, makes peoples eyes turn red in photos.  Focused: sort of vague but I guess something that is focus, i.e. sharp and defined, not blurry.  Zoomed In: c'mon now  Focal Pointed: this has two meanings, one is a technical one that deals with how a lens works, but more commonly is the most eye grabbing thing in a photo.  Maximum Aperture: this how far open a lens can open, generally the larger the aperture the more light you can get and the less time you need to get a good shot.  Light Leak: you know the red overlay you see on the edges of the screen when you rewind? That's light leak (effect) basically, in older film camera light leak happens when light can inside the case due to a damaged case, if you ever see old photos with red streaks that's why.   Now using your ""composition"" theme the only achievements that would fit are; Wide Angles, Close Ups, Focused, Zoomed In, and Focal Point. Which to your credit is the majority of the achievements for Episode 1, but not all of them.  But each achievement name matches it's photo to some degree. I edited the photo journal page from Episode 1 so we can easily see the photos with their matching achievement name.    Macro Eyes: is a close up of the graffiti on the table, something small made to look large.  Wide Angles: is probably the odd one out since it's actually a close up of a subject (the statue/bird) instead of a large landscape, but it does sort of have that distorted look that you get when you close up wide angle shots (think fisheye lens).  Telephotogenic: skater dude is just begging to be photographed after that.  Close-Ups: it's a uhhh...close up photo of a squirrel.  Red Eye: kind of tongue in cheek, Max's eyes are covered by camera but the flash on her camera would probably result in some red eyes otherwise.  focused: Max's ""craft skills"" are the focus of the shot.  zoomed in: This photo is taken near the bench where Alyssa sits but is obviously ""zoomed in"".  focal pointed: Max's dirt art is the focal point of this photo, and it's in focus (not blurry) not much else to say.  Maximum Aperture: this is a solid shot of a moving bird in low light conditions, so Max must have a lens that opens pretty wide (max aperture) for this photo not to be a blurry mess and not need any flash.  light leak: I don't think there's any actual light leak in this photo, but it has that very ""vintage"" look to it with Chloe basking in the sun.   Now this post is getting long enough already but basically your theme (for episode 1 at least) is sort of right, a lot of these terms/achievement titles are related to composition. And I think it's a good theme for episode 1 because you need good composition to take good photos, it's the foundation for any photography and episode is the foundation for the series.   I don't really have the time or energy to do breakdowns for episode two and three but I can tell you the terms are a mixed bag, not all of them relate to the themes you chose, but without comparing every optional photo to it's achievement I don't want to say much more than that. But if I had to guess I think each optional photo being related to it's achievement name/photography term is a safe bet.  But I like the idea of each episode having an achievement theme, I might have to recheck all the photos some other time and see if I can come up with different categories, and even if I don't get around to that hopefully you learned a little about photography from this massive post."

lifeisstrange,3dylks,totescharmanders,4,Mon Jul 20 21:11:38 2015 UTC,I think it's still telling that she attempted to get both the trucker and Frank to take her away without Chloe.

lifeisstrange,3dylks,eridactylsaurus,8,Mon Jul 20 18:42:52 2015 UTC,"I've always thought Chloe had a bit of a skewed perception of their relationship. Everyone in Arcadia Bay seems to know and love Rachel, it's reasonable that whatever charm she had has worked on Chloe too.  And this - not telling her about Frank, asking multiple people (Chloe included) to get her out of Arcadia Bay... I don't think she's the saint Chloe wants her to be."
lifeisstrange,3dylks,Mankindeg,8,Mon Jul 20 19:41:36 2015 UTC,"Exactly. My image of her is that she is nice to these people for one reason only - to take advantage of them in any way possible. None of her ""friends"" there, seem to be her real friends."

I love Telltale games as well (actually super glad they are getting such serious competition from DONTNOD) and they routinely pull this shit in much worse ways. The Wolf Among Us had a huge horrible unexplained gap at one point that drove me bonkers. Kentucky Route 0 is literally a one episode a year game at this point.  I guess what I'm saying is, give it a few more weeks before you really start flipping tables. Things could be a lot worse."
lifeisstrange,3dxk4h,NintenTim,2,Tue Jul 21 02:27:19 2015 UTC,"I think this is a lot of people's first episodic game, combine that with Dontnod's sort of half promise of 6 to 8 weeks between episodes (which is insane, delivering higher quality content than telltale in less time) and the massive cliff hanger at the end of episode 3 the fan base is a powder keg near open flames. The massive anxiety for episode 4 seemed to become a big issue after July 14th which was the earliest possible date. Now that we're outside of that 8 weeks max that everybody thought people don't know how to handle themselves, combined with tweets saying ""ASAP"" and ""SOON"" and then still getting nothing after five days is driving people mad.  At least with Telltale you come to expect the inconsistent release dates and leaving the fans in the dark, but LiS had been so consistent before episode 2 and 3 that people don't know to how to handle themselves now that they're we're getting the telltale treatment."

The gnome thingy was not a big deal, but the chopper part was disgusting. Almost said I've had it, it was horrible. Not sure if Valve intentionally did this or not, but it was a nightmare. If the game was HL1 or HL2 long, I definitely would not have tried it.  I constantly updated a .txt with my grub score and validated it with a youtube video, I know it is sort of cheating but my best attempt was like killing ~280 out of 333, so no way..  The defense one was quite easy once you understood what to do, even though it definitely sounds impossible for the first time you read it.  Aaand now I join the LiS EP4 hype train."
lifeisstrange,3dwo9n,Kalmah666,74,Mon Jul 20 03:54:07 2015 UTC,"Alright, for the people who have no idea what OP is talking about:  This is the history of the game files that are submitted to Steam by the developer. Games are arranged by application (which game), by package (the commercial offer), by DLC (the dlc) and by Depot (the game files). As a dev, you submit your files to depots through a branch (""release"", ""dev"", ""preview"", ""demo""...), and make sure dlcs and games get the latest working branch of the game files from said depot.  The DLCs here are episode 2, 3, 4 and 5, and in the case of Life is Strange they each have a corresponding Depot, along with the other required files for the install.  Depot ID 329920 is episode 4  Depot ID 329930 is episode 5  Here's how to read the Change history:   Change #1171611 (3 days ago)   This is the id of the change that was made. Every change has a unique id.   Changed Depots  319632/e...s/review/encrypted_gid: BD...120 › 27D33A…979EEC  319632/e...s/review/encrypted_size: C7...FD › 56E42D…C3A3DE   Depot Id 319632 is the Life is Strange Release and Test Depot. These two lines should be read together: ""gid"" and ""size"" refer to the description of an entire encrypted directory. What's important here is the branch name: ""review"".   329930/e...s/review/encrypted_gid: 295A75…6761A7  329930/e...s/review/encrypted_size: 1762B3…780D6F  branches/review/buildid: 690902 › 698733   Same thing, 329930 is the Episode 5 depot, and the changed files are on the review branch. Notice the lack of an ""arrow"" with the cryptic GUID thing? This means it's not a modification, but a creation. They created the Review Branch for Episode 5.This means they are beginning the ""review"" cycle process on Episode 5. It doesn't mean anything about the release of Episode 4, except that they maybe ""stopped postponing EP5"", which means, again, not much :P  Now if we look at the previous change:   Change #1171501 (3 days ago)  Changed Depots  319632/en...s/dontnod01/encrypted_gid: CB...F4 › 1B7AB6…D59DEC  319632/en...s/dontnod01/encrypted_size: 3333D2…CF1CD3 › 207BC7…013DE9  329930/en...s/dontnod01/encrypted_gid: EE3C79…108D6D › 448F80…7ACB85  329930/en...s/dontnod01/encrypted_size: 0D3F49…B37423 › F3DF14…577971  branches/dontnod01/buildid: 698733 › 698959  Changed changenumber – 1171178 › 1171501    All of this happens on the dontnod01 branch, which is the Development branch, and on the depots ""release and test"" and ""episode 5"". This change goes hand in hand with the other. They are pushing a new dev version for episode 5, and creating the Review branch with it. The previous changeset (3 days ago, 1171178) is similar but involves two new depots: Life is Strange Content (which is the base game) and Life is Strange Episode 4. All of these changes on the dontnod01 branch means that the last thing they did is probably to update their game internally, update the dev branch for EP4 with all the bugfixes that were found in crunch time, and update the main menu itself to unlock EP5. Something like that.  If we keep rewinding, we notice a pretty regular series of pushes 9 days ago and each day before. This is probably crunch time. Notice how nothing changed last week? That's Bastille Day in France for you.   Basically they started development on EP5 roughly a month ago, possibly when they began the motion capture. That was the last time any sort of dev job was made. Everything else until the last 3 days has been QA, Review and localization on EP4, as shown by the branch names these changesets were made on: ""qa"", ""locqa"" and ""review"".  So yeah, it looks like it's done, but they weren't sure it was done until last friday.  EDIT: aaaaaand we have a new build in branch ""qa2"", which is the Final Staging QA! This means all the known bugs were fixed, the final build is done, waiting for someone to say GO or NO GO."

So... possible announcement tomorrow, would you think? Or would you expect it to be another few days?"
lifeisstrange,3dwo9n,centerflag982,2,Mon Jul 20 21:02:56 2015 UTC,"TLDR : We'll most likely get solid news tomorrow (possibly late at night for US redditors), that's what my gut feeling says.  As for the release date itself, my best guess is very uneducated since I only know of Steam, XBox and Sony release process by hearsay & casual talks with game dev friends (just be glad it's not Nintendo, these guys have the worst requirements apparently), and I have no idea how any of these work for DLCs.  If it's anything like Apple, then they would be going through an expedited process since they've apparently already been through the acceptance loop once (at least for Steam, but I'm guessing for the others as well) for EP4, so, a day or two at most until the announcement.  There are so many wildcards though that I wouldn't get my hopes up if I were you. Even discounting consoles the final release could be either a week from now, or as soon as tomorrow or wednesday, for marketing reasons, PR or anything else.   The thing is, I can't even interpret the history of the changes around the releases of the previous episodes, around episode 3 things didn't happen quite the same way, as they apparently made a big changes to the security and code organization that they used for episode 2 (there was a private beta for EP2), and those changesets don't make much sense without proper knowledge of what they did.  And lastly, I don't want to be all doom and gloom, but unlike the previous episodes they didn't use the ""playtest"" branch at all. Which means either they've streamlined their process and did the ""play testing"" (is it fun, engaging etc?) at the same time as the ""quality testing"" (does it work? can it be completed etc?), or the episode is still weeks away. How many, I can't tell. The DLC is short, so a few days should be good, but I wouldn't dare say."

lifeisstrange,3dwo9n,GrayManTheory,-8,Mon Jul 20 06:35:45 2015 UTC,"I suspect this is the case.  PC version being delayed because of consoles and Square wants a unified release.  If so, it's absolutely inexcusable."
lifeisstrange,3dwo9n,GenuineID,10,Mon Jul 20 06:45:48 2015 UTC,"well its standard... unless there's some exclusivity deal and there obviously isn't but id say that for a game like LIS, It wouldn't be smart to have the game come out on one platform first, just because of the amount of spoilers and the game being ruined for a lot of people..."
lifeisstrange,3dwo9n,SkateboardCop,12,Mon Jul 20 06:55:14 2015 UTC,"If so, it's absolutely inexcusable.   No, it isn't. You are in no way owed an earlier release than other platforms, the developer/publisher gets the choice. Launching across markets at the same time is desirable in most situations, and in any piece of work, one thing is always going to be ready before the rest. If you must label something absolutely inexcusable, try anything other than a unified release for a story-driven, nay, story-critical game.  I sincerely doubt that you would be saying the same if it was the PC version that was holding things up (which is hardly rare, given hardware variance and how many titles target consoles first). There's no way I'd want an episode to launch on consoles before I could play it."
lifeisstrange,3dwo9n,PaintItPurple,2,Mon Jul 20 11:04:57 2015 UTC,"really, steam already gets the episodes like 16 hours early due to timezones and other timing issues and 16 hours is already forever in spoiler time on the internet. Imagine if PC got episode 4 five days earlier, by the time console players got it they probably would of been spoiled on everything."
lifeisstrange,3dwo9n,centerflag982,2,Mon Jul 20 15:44:33 2015 UTC,"""Inexcusable"" implies a level of entitlement that just isn't there, but it is pretty lame to make PC players wait longer because the consoles can't get their shit together. And I say that as a mostly-console player."

In rare cases they put up things on other days (like Episode 1, I think they're fine with putting up new releases, but this is basically DLC).  Since both Ep2 and Ep3 were on Tuesdays, this will probably be, too. And since that's already tomorrow... we won't get the game if the trailer doesn't hit today, so it'll be the 28th I guess."

lifeisstrange,3dwo9n,AwesomeDewey,4,Mon Jul 20 13:01:02 2015 UTC,This sort of may confirm the suspicions that it's the publisher holding them back for some reason.   It's been 26 days now since Ep.4 files were changed and recently they've modified the Ep.5 files.  This could mean that they're already completely done with Ep.4 and are currently in production of Ep.5 in the meantime.
lifeisstrange,3dwo9n,AwesomeDewey,5,Mon Jul 20 06:25:46 2015 UTC,"well... Publisher... ish maybe, but I think its more along the lines of having to submit for approval from MS and Sony, considering they were still either putting in fixes or changes 3 days ago that might not be 100% done yet (Knowing this as a QA tester)  I think everyone is ready, it just needs the nod from First Party... and they wont have PC come out before the consoles, technically they could release on steam first, but it would be a dumb idea..."

lifeisstrange,3dx9zh,GSoda,5,Mon Jul 20 11:28:10 2015 UTC,Maybe someone at Dontnod took a selfie around the 12-13th and they are going to go back with the knowledge of how to fix all the bugs.

I started by played season one of The Walking Dead, but Life is Strange's decision making feels like it impacts the game more than what Telltale does. Not to say that they're bad, they're just not as good IMO as LiS."
lifeisstrange,3dw81n,NKSCF,10,Mon Jul 20 01:39:46 2015 UTC,"I'm tied for them, to be honest. I highly appreciate another company trying this ""episodic"" medium, though. You can see that Telltale's games VS LiS show two very different approaches to this method of story-telling, and that makes me very happy.  Part of Telltale's limited choice impacts have to do with Telltale not wanting to write a thousand endings, while LiS embraces the multiple endings aspect. Of course, DONTNOD has so much more to work with in LiS because of Max's powers, than Telltale would have with these pre-determined characters and universes."
lifeisstrange,3dw81n,IFE-Antler-Boy,6,Mon Jul 20 01:58:52 2015 UTC,"Borderlands is the best TT game man, you're missing out. Though I would definately wait until it's finished so you won't have to wait two years for the next episode."

There's also some old school text games, even a couple door games and html games, then the plethora of visual novels... or games with some hack 'n' slash or puzzles but still fell into the interactive storytelling, choose your own adventure genres...  albeit most of those aren't too pretty compared to the likes of today.   (I personally blame the success of Myst and its mind numbing silence for killing those genres for a good long while... )  maybe I'll see if I could mod Heather Poe from VTM: Bloodlines into a more fashionable Chloe... that game had a decent soundtrack too.    Therese and Jeanette seems a decent place to create a Victoria and Rachel slash.  Oh, and there was Bladerunner too... it's kind of the unloved stepchild, but it was great version of what could have been...   but yeah, TT games are fun for what they are... but it's less choose your own adventure than jump into the fan universe of your favored series... too many clashes with canon, which is likely why most of the decisions don't seem to matter."

lifeisstrange,3dw35s,PandaJam001,17,Mon Jul 20 07:38:41 2015 UTC,"Easy solution: stop watching let's plays, buy the game. Let's plays don't have nearly the emotional punch as doing it first hand."
lifeisstrange,3dw35s,SkyWest1218,8,Mon Jul 20 01:33:04 2015 UTC,"There are a surprising number of little choices to be made, in addition to the big ones. Like slightly different paths through conversations that show you new facets of characters. Plus exploring the environments and picking up on the subtle things. Not to mention the good atmosphere.  It's a very replayable game. So having seen LPs probably wouldn't ruin it."
lifeisstrange,3dw35s,lislislislislis,8,Mon Jul 20 00:52:57 2015 UTC,"I've noticed a lot of lets-plays don't actually have too much exploration because they want it to just focus on the main story but this game is very fun to just wander around and explore and pick up on all the details. And you can play the last two episodes without knowing anything ;)   like, most lets plays ive seen are only a couple of hours but i spend like 4-5 hours per episode just exploring and reading everything"
lifeisstrange,3dw35s,spookycatlover,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:07:56 2015 UTC,If you want to watch someone play games like life is strange with a lot of exploration then I recommend nukemdukem. Great youtuber.

lifeisstrange,3dw35s,spookycatlover,1 point,Mon Jul 20 06:56:15 2015 UTC,"No problem! I feel like he should be more recognised, I'm constantly amazed at how much effort he goes to for his viewers."
lifeisstrange,3dw35s,hi_im_jesus,1 point,Mon Jul 20 07:21:05 2015 UTC,I'm a bit annoyed at him posting it first on Twitch and after on YouTube though :(
lifeisstrange,3dw35s,kimhyunah0,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:42:55 2015 UTC,You should watch his livestreams! They're great :)
lifeisstrange,3dw35s,hi_im_jesus,6,Mon Jul 20 14:46:30 2015 UTC,"This isn't the type of game fit for let's play videos, honestly. Everyone makes unique choices."
lifeisstrange,3dw35s,Dustla,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:29:42 2015 UTC,"I looove let's plays of Life is Strange. I've probably watched 10 different ones, at least, but only played each EP twice.  The purpose of watching a let's play shouldn't be experiencing the game, although you can somewhat do that with this type of story based point and click. I watch LPs to see other people's reactions to what happens, and to vicariously re-experience seeing it for the first time.   Granted I play each episode before I watch LPs, and I would recommend OP does that for episodes 4 and 5."
lifeisstrange,3dw35s,zqwefty,4,Mon Jul 20 06:35:00 2015 UTC,"I think it depends on how much backstory/world-building things you want to explore. I've watched a couple LPs after completing the episode myself, and it's blatantly obvious every single LPer misses and/or skips things. It takes me about 3 hours to finish an episode because I talk to everyone and explore all my options, but most LPers finish at around the 2 hour mark.  We're also only midway through the series. There are decisions you could make that are different than the LPers you watched that could affect the story differently. For example, EP2 SPOILERS  Personally, I think it's worth it. After I beat an episode, I watch a LP and then watch my friend play through via Skype and see her make her own choices. The LPer I watch pretty much has the opposite story my save file has, but my friend's story line is similar to mine.  At the very least, you'll be free to explore areas the LPer didn't explore, find minor choices the LPer didn't find, etc etc."
lifeisstrange,3dw35s,RasereiHojo,3,Mon Jul 20 07:09:08 2015 UTC,"Yeah there is a fundamental problem with watching LPs of games like LIS. The experience is tied to how you act and what you do, dialogue may be different depending on what you say and do in your playthroughs.   The LPers often take the fast route and misses a lot of things on the side. Compare Geekremix with some of the big LPers and you will see what I mean.   Interactive games deserves some high attention so that you capture the experience but also the 'lore' by your own playthrough."
lifeisstrange,3dw35s,haXona,3,Mon Jul 20 07:54:01 2015 UTC,"I'd highly recommend that you get the game. Playing it yourself is just so much better. You just know and feel that it's your own playthrough even if you make very similar choices to the person you've been watching. Not to mention you get to explore the game world at your own pace!  And you still have 2 more episodes to go that will surely be the most important ones.   Heck, I saw all 3 episodes on YouTube first and while I regretted watching those (mostly for the ep.3 ending spoiler) I still very much enjoyed the game. So go get it tiger!"
lifeisstrange,3dw35s,GymKerry,2,Mon Jul 20 06:36:26 2015 UTC,"Well, you could always choose the other options. Realize that that's possible.  You know.. just sayign this is a choose yoru own adventure-esque game.  The options/decisions the players chose does not necssairly mean you have to take."
lifeisstrange,3dw35s,TheMarshmallowBear,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:52:01 2015 UTC,"LiS really shines when you can go at your own pace.  LPs are great, but they miss a lot of detail sometimes and this game has so much to explore."
lifeisstrange,3dw35s,GenerouslyLachrymose,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:17:27 2015 UTC,"Well, it's not Life is Strange but I watched The Walking Dead in Youtube as a movie, then I went and bought it when it was on sale. I cried like a baby watching it the first time, and cried harder the second time. So yeah, I'd say buy Life is Strange. Stop watching LPs of it too, so you'll get the full episode 4 experience."
lifeisstrange,3dw35s,IFE-Antler-Boy,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:23:09 2015 UTC,This game has mad replay value. I can see myself playing it over 5+ times just to make different choices to see the long term outcomes. Its nuts. Its awesome. I love this game now
lifeisstrange,3dw35s,m4xwellmurd3r,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:59:56 2015 UTC,"its worth it, but buy it after the release of episode 4. this waiting is killing me"
lifeisstrange,3dw35s,GoodLifeGG,1 point,Mon Jul 20 11:32:52 2015 UTC,"You will still have to play it from the beginning if you want your decisions to be taken into account. Alternatively, the game can automatically generate decisions for you for episode 4."
lifeisstrange,3dw35s,Dvindly,1 point,Mon Jul 20 11:42:13 2015 UTC,"Buy it and love it. This isn't a game like Uncharted or Tomb Raider. Their is no straight path.....well I can't say that. In the end our choices might not matter, but how you get there will definitely be different from other people. I've watched a couple of people play after I've beaten the episodes. Everyone plays differently. Max is pretty much chill and down to earth when I play....and occasionally bitchy. Also I watched someone choose  a fucking Bacon Omelette...over a Belgian Waffle...BELGIAN Waffle. If that doesn't highlight the importance of the choices I don't know what will."
lifeisstrange,3dw35s,SIRTreehugger,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:04:43 2015 UTC,It's definitely worth it to buy it. It's nice to make your own decisions and actually experiencing the game yourself. I always find myself starting new saves just to go back and see all the little tidbits and scenes I've missed because the environment of this game is so huge. I just keep finding new reasons to love the game each time I play.
lifeisstrange,3dw35s,HELLASTRANGE,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:33:17 2015 UTC,"I think it's absolutely worth it. You still have two episodes left to play without any background knowledge, and according to twitter, episode 4 is their most ambitious episode yet. Let's plays are great, but it's different from experiencing it yourself."
lifeisstrange,3dwa8k,SomethingSimsy,7,Mon Jul 20 01:44:52 2015 UTC,"God, that's a really good point about Jefferson. I had forgotten that him leaving and his car and him speaking with Victoria occurred in the same day!  I would like to point out that since 1) Blackwell is apparently known to have an amazing photography program and 2) Max mentions in EP3 that there was a place in Blackwell to develop photos, then there ought to be some kind of photo lab in the school - more specifically, a dark room. My theory is that the red binder with Kate's photo in it was assembled by Jefferson. That could have been what he returned to the school to do. But I'm kind of basing that off of theories I've heard around the internet as it is. XD"
lifeisstrange,3dwa8k,darthopera,1 point,Mon Jul 20 09:55:06 2015 UTC,Good connection! I also think Jefferson took photos of Kate in a kind of photo studio while she was dugged. That would explain her describing the bright light which she falsely thought to be the hospital as well as the soft voice.
lifeisstrange,3dwa8k,MrLorenz,10,Mon Jul 20 21:39:03 2015 UTC,"Very interesting. I think adding Frank to this just does not feel right - there is good reason for all the others but Frank would not collaborate with them to do something shady to Rachel (or really for any reason), too me it just seems far too out of character.   As for the rest it would be fitting that when asked to blame someone (for Kates attempted/successful stage dive) that there was actually no wrong answer - just the wrong reasons why you are picking them. Another theory posted just a bit ago detailed why that person thought it was all Jefferson - but this holds more ground in my mind because they all seem guilt ridden in one way or another."
lifeisstrange,3dwa8k,Kleebork,2,Mon Jul 20 02:18:23 2015 UTC,"it was Victoria in the library with the a worn copy of ""leaves of grass"" while David and Nathan finished the job with the incredible true story of two girls in love... or it was Brooke with her drone in the parking lot, taking out the competition, both real and imagined, of anyone that paid her dear, sweet, Warren any kind of attention... that snarky sarcasm has deadly thorns."
lifeisstrange,3dvsvl,Davkilla101,8,Sun Jul 19 23:11:39 2015 UTC,"Most interesting are his first lines in game in classroom something like "" I could anybody from you imagine and frame in dark corner in moment of desperation""... That was kinda creepy... Also after latest Vortex party there was Kate and before there was Rachel...   I really speculating now but as you have pointed out with his little obssesion with Max, maybe Max is his next target...  Or maybe not, maybe he is actually good guy, still that red folders are his work but maybe he is just the one who is investigating it - that would be plot twist. If he is really the bad guy, I so looking forward to know his reasons for this because he seems like wise and smart character."
lifeisstrange,3dvsvl,TAGsvk,2,Sun Jul 19 23:29:44 2015 UTC,"I have another theory that Mr. Jefferson is capturing people with time travel powers, but I can't confirm this as all the proof I have is a comment by mister Jefferson (see evidence #1), and the fact that Dontnod mentioned a possible second season which confirms Max isn't the only one with the rewind ability. The only way to find out whether this theory is true is to try Max's rewind power on Rachel (if we see her alive in EP4). If Rachel can rewind time as well, she wont be affected by the rewind and will likely notice Max's rewinding."
lifeisstrange,3dvsvl,RelaxedCreeper,2,Mon Jul 20 03:06:50 2015 UTC,"About the dark corner thing, you needed the context of what he was talking about.  The photographer he was talking about had pictures of ""sad mothers and children"" (as said by Victoria), so he's just saying how easy it is to replicate that type of photo."
lifeisstrange,3dvsvl,Kleebork,4,Mon Jul 20 04:37:45 2015 UTC,Another note would be how he seemed eager to shut down that interrogation after Kates attempted/accomplished stage dive. After only one or two minutes he gets the principle to let Nathan and Max go. Probably because he wanted to get the unstable Nathan out of the situation before he spills some beans - beans that he may have if this theory is correct.
lifeisstrange,3dvsvl,m4xwellmurd3r,4,Mon Jul 20 00:16:58 2015 UTC,"I'm wondering if he does something like build a portfolio of him bringing these girls into the spotlight, either by favorable, or slanderous means, and chronicles their eventual down fall into oblivion. A portfolio of the rise and fall of girls that he personally creates. Max might be his latest muse after he finishes with Kate. Their downfall doesn't have to be death, but the destruction of their ""life""."
lifeisstrange,3dvsvl,m4xwellmurd3r,5,Mon Jul 20 03:08:57 2015 UTC,"Oh shit, expanding on this, Nathan is a drugged up, mentally unstable creep, but what if Mr. Jefferson initially drugged Kate. Nathan might have honestly wanted to bring her to the ER, but Mr. Jefferson said no (for obvious reasons) and told him instead to bring her to his studio, and that he (Jefferson) would take care of her.  Its a sketchy idea, but as uncaring as Nathan seemed, in the end of ep2 he did have a small look of guilt vs his usual I don't fucking care face."
lifeisstrange,3dvsvl,m4xwellmurd3r,4,Mon Jul 20 03:14:40 2015 UTC,"Further expanding on this, Nathan must look up to Jefferson as a mentor in some ways, as it was shown despite his attitude and personality, he does have a good eye for art. What if he tries to become a copy cat of sorts, and seeing Chloe makes him think ""ah ha, this is my chance"" he slips her some bad shit and tries to pull the same shit as Jefferson did to Kate, but royally fucks up"
lifeisstrange,3dvsvl,DominoNo-,3,Mon Jul 20 03:17:14 2015 UTC,"It's why I refer to him as Mr J, as a reference to what Harley Quinn calls the joker."
lifeisstrange,3dvsvl,BostonTentacleParty,5,Mon Jul 20 10:19:13 2015 UTC,"First Kelly (who's Kelly?), then Rachel, then Kate...  The next target will be Warren, because the real culprit is Chloe, trying to remove all obstacles from Pricefield. >:D  Okay, no. Jefferson makes sense, and is really the only one who makes sense (of the characters we've met so far). The camera always pans through all these different scenes showing the whereabouts of all these characters at the end of each episode: David, Nathan, Principal Wells. Never Jefferson. But then it cuts to the binders.  If it's not Jefferson, my bet is Nathan's dad. Nathan seems resentful and afraid of him, he's got ridiculous power over this town, and from the letter on Wells' desk, he's very insistent on that Vortex Club party happening. Why? What's his stake in his son's club's parties? They happen all the time, what's the difference if this one were cancelled?"
lifeisstrange,3dvsvl,Dieuos,4,Mon Jul 20 03:10:22 2015 UTC,"I believe Ep 1 it cut to Jefferson looking out his window at the snow, Ep. 2 he was driving off in his car after arguing with Wells."
lifeisstrange,3dvsvl,BostonTentacleParty,2,Mon Jul 20 06:54:51 2015 UTC,"... Oh right. Well, dicks. I guess the jury isn't out, as we only definitely get the sense someone in the room with the binders at the end of Ep 3. But still."
lifeisstrange,3dw27u,SomethingSimsy,2,Mon Jul 20 00:33:06 2015 UTC,That moment in EP2 when Warren went to check out Max just next to Nathan without any interaction between them (despite they crapped on Max) was weird. But Warren will have some dark secret for sure. Too much creepy foreshadowing on him is in the game.
lifeisstrange,3dw27u,TAGsvk,10,Mon Jul 20 00:52:28 2015 UTC,"To me he just seems like a filler character. So far I don't see anything that realistically suggest that he will add something big to the game at a later date.  So far, my impressions of Warren is a guy trying to have sex with Max. It was strongly suggested in this interaction we had with Warren."
lifeisstrange,3dw27u,Bodomi,2,Mon Jul 20 00:56:46 2015 UTC,"You just made Wax shippers mad.  Of course he is there just so Max wouldnt look like total outcast from boys and obvious character that will have lesbian romance later cliché.  But he could be also that very clever harmless bad guy plot twist. I am sure that he will take some part in main story for sure even if he will be just way how to indirectly say ""no"" to Chloe and looking at very disturbing outro scene that will show them on drivein or we will learn some dark secret of his - doesnt need to have anything with that conspiracy going on."
lifeisstrange,3dw27u,TAGsvk,3,Mon Jul 20 01:11:25 2015 UTC,"As a plot element, I think Warren will probably take the blame in episode 4 for ""EP3 SPOILERS"""

He's infatuated with Max, and jealous that she's hanging out with this punk chick and stealing Max away from him every chance he has to hang out with her and make a move on her. I doubt he would mention max had any involvement, but blame it all on Chloe. Then when Chloe is gone and locked up, he can swoop in and be her knight in shining armor telling her it'll all be OK cause he's there for her"
lifeisstrange,3dw27u,Elyeis,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:15:49 2015 UTC,Oh god if this happens I'll re-program the game just to add in a possibility of Max finding out to kick Warren in the nuts.

lifeisstrange,3dw0ks,MainaC,10,Mon Jul 20 01:23:43 2015 UTC,I watched an LPer struggle with this for about ten minutes. I noticed two things:   Didn't read the control tips that pop up. Didn't realize that they had to stop fiddling with it once it came into focus/sound started happening. They just kept going. They eventually got it by rapidly going back and forth over the focus point. It was the stupidest thing.

Chloe was on a lawn mower on her way to the city while police were chasing her. Someone, I am assuming Max, was in a tank following her while destroying any cops that got too close to her. Chloe didnt give a fuck what was going on around her, she just wanted to get to the city to cut that grass! Haha cop cars were blowing up around her and she didnt even flinch. Her blue hair just fluttered in the explosion blasts.  It took soooo long to get to the city and once she got there and started cutting grass, the dream ended. I think it was influenced by that gif comic of Chloe wheeling the principals chair down the road and also influenced by GTA5 which I was playing earlier that day. It was weird. Im hoping for a dream set in Arcadia Bay where I just get to hang out and chat with Chloe, Max, Kate, and others."

lifeisstrange,3dtqve,extremely_cool,2,Sun Jul 19 14:33:54 2015 UTC,I had a dream about ep.4 and Rachel being stuck in a literally dark room. She was just going around there and it was dark inside and outside.

lifeisstrange,3dtqve,RonBiggs2017,2,Sun Jul 19 21:24:06 2015 UTC,"Yeah pretty much lol. The whole reason why it's strange is that I've never liked Victoria, and I haven't since I was first introduced to her character."

lifeisstrange,3du6t4,SkateboardCop,13,Sun Jul 19 14:43:27 2015 UTC,"While doing my morning LiS twitter check I found this tweet in their replies. I think it's more interesting than the daily ""real soon"" tweets we've been getting recently because it could mean they're announcing episode 4 this Monday (or even Tuesday) and releasing it immediately after. All speculation obviously.  Also I flaired this as ""news"", let me know if there's a better flair for it.  edit: episode 2 and 3 didn't have preloading either, so there's reason to expect that episode 4 might be arriving sooner because of this tweet."
lifeisstrange,3du6t4,Jessie246,4,Sun Jul 19 14:46:45 2015 UTC,What makes you think it would be released immediately after its announcement? I thought they told us we would know well in advance before its released? It would be nice to have it right away but I dont see how/why it would be.
lifeisstrange,3du6t4,NotMeeh,4,Sun Jul 19 14:56:11 2015 UTC,"Actually I was mistaken, I thought episode 2 and 3 had preloading that started a week before the release. But since there wasn't preloading on episode 2 or 3 it makes sense that episode 4 wouldn't have preloading either.  So that's my bad actually, I'll edit the original post."
lifeisstrange,3du6t4,LISEP4HYPE,4,Sun Jul 19 15:05:41 2015 UTC,It would be cool if they would release it tomorrow or a few days later. But my guess is that we'll have to wait another week.

Though it does make me curious: I've come across leaked story points for all the episodes. I read only the ones I've played through and they were all legit. The 4 and 5 ones, I didn't look at. Does this mean 4 and 5 were already leaked, or that someone at DN just released the story by leak or something?"

But the choices for every episode have been leaked, but fortunately I've never seen those."

I dunno, it just felt like Anthony Burch forcing his world views into the game. Not that I disagree with the statement or anything.

lifeisstrange,3dtu9b,Symirk,6,Sun Jul 19 13:25:03 2015 UTC,It was just a parody if you decide to reject him all the time tho. And Max didn't even gave him that hug :/   But I want them to give us a choice! :)

lifeisstrange,3dtu9b,darthopera,5,Sun Jul 19 13:44:09 2015 UTC,"I think Dontnod set up those choices to hang out with Warren for that reason, to give you a choice between him and Chloe. Where'd you find that in the journal? I haven't been keeping up with the journal entirely but I'm curious to see how much of her thoughts on Warren and Chloe change when you make different decisions (Go Ape, or no ape? Kiss or no kiss?)"
lifeisstrange,3dtu9b,chattypenguin,2,Sun Jul 19 16:27:36 2015 UTC,I replied to another user with screenshots. Go check it out. If you don't kiss Chloe she literally says she would have kissed her if it wasn't a dare and if you do she says Chloe was cute. Whether or not you say no to going ape: she still shows disinterest in Warren romantically.
lifeisstrange,3dtu9b,ScarletRhi,3,Sun Jul 19 16:36:34 2015 UTC,"To be fair it is a game based on the players choices.  I don't see dontnod forcing a relationship with either Chloe or Warren on the player, I do think you will get to go for either of them or none of them."
lifeisstrange,3dtu9b,AcerPhoon,23,Sun Jul 19 21:15:23 2015 UTC,In my game it is going to happen. If Max wants it or not!

lifeisstrange,3dtu9b,Elyeis,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:46:45 2015 UTC,"One of my friends alredy kiss me on the lips during a party just for fun, i don't see what could be wrong in putting your friends pictures as a phone background, and i've alredy seen girls kissing each other and teasing themself just ""for fun"" again. And none off the personn i speak here are homo. It's just what i would call ""life experience"". And for Max and Chloe you can avoid kissing chloe. Maybe i'm wrong and we will see more than a strong friendship in the futur but for now i don't feel there is much information about an eventual Max/Chloe homosexual relation."

lifeisstrange,3dtu9b,Elyeis,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:06:28 2015 UTC,"I was thinking the love realtionship could be more between Rachel and Chloe because of Chloe's overreacting when she learn about Rachel and Frank. Of course there is ambiguity between Max and Chloe but strong friendship, and especially between teenagers, can become ambiguous because at this age you are questionning yourself. Of course they like each other, they probably also love each other that's not the point, i love my familly, my friends, i care about them much without being engage in a romance with them."
lifeisstrange,3dtu9b,1314janira,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:33:16 2015 UTC,"There DEFINITELY are romantic feelings between Chloe and Rachel (or at least, there are on Chloe's side, but I'm starting to think they were one sided), that's not even implied it's clearly stated in text.   Eta because the reply sent before I was done: the thing is you can't blame the ambiguity on teenagers being curious because... That's not ambiguity? If warren and Max would have had the interaction Chloe and Max had NO ONE would question that they're seeding a romantic storyline, looking at it differently just because we're talking about a same sex couple is close minded and, again, completely based on heteronormativity. As a bisexual girl I've had close friendship with different genders and as blurry as the line got sometimes I really don't see the same thing happening between max and Chloe, I definitely see romantic seeding rather than a friendship..."
lifeisstrange,3dtu9b,Elyeis,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:32:46 2015 UTC,"I just don't blame the ambiguity lets be clear here, i don't care if there is an hetero romance or an homosexual romance i would be perfectly fine with both developement seriously. I'm not closing my eyes because i don't want things to happen, i want things to happen in a way or an other i would play the both side if there is. But what i'm saying is i don't see more than close friendship and a little ambiguity between them, at least for now in ep 1,2,3. it's just my opinion and not a judgement and i could easily changed my mind if i get clues, or proof or if the developement in ep4 really start something more intimate between them.

The pool scene ""proves"" (not really, but you get what I mean) that Max thinks about him as BF potential, but at the same time not quite (""Warren? He's ... nice"" - ""Ouch, friendzoned"" - ""No, he's really cool. It was so sweet when he stood up to Nathan""). I guess, depending on our choices so far, we will definitely see a way to open Max's gate for our horny, yet lovely nerd."

I cant quite picture that situation how is even possible from Max in this season to come to Warren and kiss him out of blue with all that friendzoning and his minimal part in story where devs even really doesnt putted more effort to their relationship behind ""geeky boy that have crush on girl"".

I know a lot of people comp;ain that it wasn't open world like assassin's creed or that it doesn't have as cool combat as batman games.  But if someone (like EA or Ubisoft) gave DONTNOD those 200 million USD to make it open world, would they let the main character be half-black woman? Would they let them have it happen in Paris? Would they let them use the cool French scifi aesthetic (like Fifth Element had) instead of ""gears of war with zombies""?  Nah. We would get generic white muscle dude and possibly not memory remix at all. The game wasn't perfect, but it was the best one possible given the constraints of the real world.

lifeisstrange,3drtvb,rrainmaker,3,Sun Jul 19 03:49:31 2015 UTC,This was fantastic! We need Chloe's dad's camera though!
lifeisstrange,3drtvb,rrainmaker,3,Sun Jul 19 03:51:52 2015 UTC,Excellent work throughout this cosplay!
lifeisstrange,3drtvb,KaesoDip,15,Sun Jul 19 05:44:43 2015 UTC,"If I am not mistaken you even wore similiar watch Max is hiding in her drawers! Also, Jefferson Victoria in the background is a nice touch.  Well done, these are amazing."
lifeisstrange,3drtvb,Bradley_The_Tua-ri,12,Sat Jul 18 21:39:40 2015 UTC,"Thanks :) They're just people who were here, but I think it adds some realism to the scene ! I'll have a Jefferson and a Victoria for some photoshoots in the future (can't wait :D)"

lifeisstrange,3drtvb,gheepot,3,Sat Jul 18 21:50:42 2015 UTC,Man some of the cosplay I have seen here is so good
lifeisstrange,3drtvb,lorddaikon,3,Sun Jul 19 10:11:50 2015 UTC,"Small critique, add a bit of eyeliner. While not canon, the eyes look a bit creepy without it."
lifeisstrange,3drtvb,Theroonco,3,Sun Jul 19 10:16:01 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your suggestion :) I put some black khol on the eyelids but I should buy a good eyeliner. I think Max has some kind of black make up on her eyelids, it shows up a bit when she takes the bus and in few other scenes, if I remember well !"
lifeisstrange,3drtvb,levir,3,Sun Jul 19 10:36:35 2015 UTC,"She actually wears subtly different makeup in each episode (although I think the same in 3 as in 2, obviously), which is something that I think is unprecedented for games like this. REALISTIC GIRLNESS?!"

If you're open to suggestions, then I'd say try combing your bangs a little to the side like Max. Either way, your costume is great, keep up the good work."
lifeisstrange,3drtvb,5kyLegend,3,Sun Jul 19 12:41:37 2015 UTC,"Thank you :)   I tried to, but my bang naturally goes to the opposite side of Max's and we did this photoshoot late at night so my hair was all messy again ! (11PM or something, haha!) I'll need some hairspray next time.   The bag is all handmade, I made it in a hurry and it's not perfect technically speaking but I really love it, I use it a lot now :)"

lifeisstrange,3drtvb,beto0795,3,Sun Jul 19 00:26:31 2015 UTC,I was thinking the same thing. The only thing missing is the right camera.
lifeisstrange,3drtvb,creitve,3,Sun Jul 19 00:46:11 2015 UTC,Everyone knows the Spectra is  cooler.
lifeisstrange,3drtvb,howardtheduckdoe,3,Sun Jul 19 08:09:37 2015 UTC,"Haha yeah, it's planned, but I try to find an old polaroid camera that works and isn't too expensive. It takes time but I'm sure I'll find :3"
lifeisstrange,3drtvb,Voorhees_13,3,Sun Jul 19 10:37:53 2015 UTC,Just go to antique sales and garage sales. You can easily find a working one for around $20 (at least speaking of the 600).

I want more of Max and Chloe, those are one of the most impactful and authentic characters the gaming community has ever seen and it is a shame to toss them away after just 5 episodes."
lifeisstrange,3duqxm,JoetotheD,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:09:59 2015 UTC,I would rather only have the 5 episodes of Chloe and Max and get some definite closure rather than some ambiguous ending so they can do a 2nd season with them though.
lifeisstrange,3duqxm,Dvindly,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:01:09 2015 UTC,"There is a probability with the ambiguous ending since they are big fans of Twin Peaks and on the BAFTA show, they said they implemented the episodic element so they could change things on the go and because you can end things with cliffhangers."
lifeisstrange,3duqxm,JoetotheD,3,Mon Jul 20 12:05:58 2015 UTC,"Good point, I know there will be some questions left unanswered obviously but as long as they cover the big issues I'm fine with an ending that can be left open to interpretation so multiple people's theories can be used in one way or another. I just don't want a ep3 type ending for ep5."

lifeisstrange,3duqxm,Julius74,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:28:35 2015 UTC,An Ep3 type cliffhanger would hurt. But unless the girls die (which I seriously hope they have never even considered) I don't see why s2 with them shouldnt work even if the big story arc is finished. And.. at least they wouldn't have to awkwardly let another someone discover their rewind ability which just won't surprise us that much.

No need to get sassy
lifeisstrange,3ds05w,Meet_Dave,2,Sun Jul 19 13:10:58 2015 UTC,"i honestly think you all say that you want that, but that you'd be even more angry if they didn't deliver on a concrete date.   i've been watching people get unnecessarily upset about a loose goal that was set in the beginning get passed up. people are claiming that they were lied to, feel betrayed, or will have to change how they play the game---if not saying that they're giving up on the studio entirely.  we've been conditioned as people to expect instant gratification, now. not long so, packages used to take 6-8 weeks to get to your door. nowadays, that would spark an uproar. people would be pursuing refunds by then claiming that the goods were not received.  now we're expecting a tiny game dev studio to be without fault in sticking with the same time window to deliver hours of solid content with the attention to detail that we've been enjoying so much with the other episodes.  try to see it from their perspective. giving a solid date when you're still unaware of every bug that needs fixed is like putting a noose around your neck and slowly tightening it. especially when you've got a whole community of people already brandishing pitchforks for being late on a release ""date"" that didn't even exist in the first place.  i also don't understand why people are asking for more transparency from them when we would never in a million years get solid details from a aaa game that needed to be delayed.  i am chill. i'm waiting patiently and wishing that everyone would do the same and give these guys a break."
lifeisstrange,3ds05w,Dustla,2,Sun Jul 19 13:36:07 2015 UTC,If you guys want to know why they can't say anything except for vague stuff look up non-disclosure agreement. They already have release dates for either the console versions or the pc version though because they tweeted a while back that they couldn't announce dates until they had all of them. So we won't get anything even if the game is done UNTIL square enix gives them the okay.

After Episode 3, it seems like the last thing the Devs and any of us should be worried about is who is going to end up with who. The apocalyptic tornado is only two days away.   That being said, there's nothing wrong with wanting Max to end up with Warren, or Chloe. But consider all the shit Max has just gotten herself into.

Why do they have to be heterosexual/platonic for it to count?"
lifeisstrange,3dvksb,torymid,3,Mon Jul 20 03:21:10 2015 UTC,"You have to take the number of games with multiple female lead characters into account when making that assumption. They are pretty rare. And within this rare collection of games, lesbian couples are indeed represented a lot more than usual. This might however just be part of the whole thing. Most companies still push guys as the heroes of the story, just like in any other media, so when a dev team puts 2 female characters in the spotlight, you can also assume they are not of the narrow minded kind and would love to consider having LBGT somewhat represented in their games."
lifeisstrange,3dvksb,lixyna,5,Sun Jul 19 22:51:25 2015 UTC,"I feel like Warren wasn't given much screen time in Episode 3 and gave it more to Chloe and Max was to show the audience a bonding moment between them (In the school, at the pool etc.) and because of that, I personally felt the ending of Episode 3 was much more devastating because of seeing Chloe and Max bonding so much just a few moments ago (I won't spoil the ending just in case). Without the episode showing the two bonding, I feel that the ending of the episode wouldn't have had much of an impact if DontNod didn't include the bonding moments, and finally showing that they're becoming best friends again."

lifeisstrange,3dvksb,gybali,2,Sun Jul 19 22:14:48 2015 UTC,"You wouldn't believe me when I tell you that I was so excited to play LiS just because of Chloe. I liked her soooo much, it was unexplainable. Then when I made a particular decision, she made a particular answer which made me angry at her and I hated her for a while. Now I started liking her again. I'm also happy that she sees you as good influence, and devs confirmed this. TL DL: I wish I had Chloe-like friend in my life, you just need a friend like that. I don't the need the blue hair, just the attitude. She is caring, friendly, and perverted enough. As a guy, I like those kind of girls."
lifeisstrange,3dvksb,Dvindly,4,Sun Jul 19 22:43:33 2015 UTC,"I liked her character the whole time. She's acting shitty sometimes with Max and in general too, but i can understand it. Especially that Max never really cared about her (she never called her and she knew that Chloe's father just died). So she was ""abandoned"" over and over again of course she's upset and acts weird sometimes."
lifeisstrange,3dvksb,gybali,2,Sun Jul 19 22:51:49 2015 UTC,"Exactly, that's what I realized after hating her and I understood her. Basically, her and I are on the same ground. We are both struggling with friends. Fortunately, no weed is needed in my house."
lifeisstrange,3dvksb,Dvindly,2,Sun Jul 19 22:59:48 2015 UTC,"Who can possibly hate Chloe, please! I hate games like this because they make you fall for imaginary characters. For me it's Chloe. And now, I'm dying for the new episode. Since... You know... It devastated me."

lifeisstrange,3dvksb,Dvindly,6,Mon Jul 20 10:46:24 2015 UTC,"People don't understand that Max doesn't like Warren. I have nothing against Warren but no matter how much you want them to be together, you can't change Max's feelings. I honestly ship pricefield hardcore but if Max doesn't want to be with Chloe than it's not my choice. Don't get me wrong I'd be slightly dissapointed but I can't change Max's feelings.   You can ship anyone you want, I'm not against it, but I doubt Max will hook up with Warren."
lifeisstrange,3dvksb,ramahlive,3,Mon Jul 20 02:50:53 2015 UTC,Agreed. There's multiple times she says that she's just not into him. I'm pretty sure there are zero dialogue options that lead to any indication that she will like him more than just friends
lifeisstrange,3dvksb,m4xwellmurd3r,4,Mon Jul 20 06:34:52 2015 UTC,"I feel like whether the relationships are romantic or platonic (depending on player choice), Chloe and Max would always have a deeper relationship than Warren and Max. Like,  -- Chloe and Max intense lovers; Warren and Max shallow high school friendship  -- Chloe and Max BFFs; Warren and Max shallow high school relationship  She just has more history with Chloe. She's known Warren for a month."
lifeisstrange,3dvksb,lislislislislis,2,Sun Jul 19 22:29:21 2015 UTC,Given it's an episodic game they can design based on the feedback from the community. I think it's more likely they saw how much people dislike Warren's attitude and reduced his prominence in the story.
lifeisstrange,3dvksb,jessebona,2,Sun Jul 19 22:06:34 2015 UTC,"Hmm, if we were even given a chance to end up with someone, I would like to choose Warren. Chloe turns me off way too much with her attitude.   I just wish all this Max/Warren vs Max/Chloe thing was over with already. Shipping wars never make a fandom better. Just crush on who you like guys! plus honestly i really think that at the end the game will send you back to the beginning so none of this matters anyways"
lifeisstrange,3dvksb,TrekMek,2,Sun Jul 19 22:22:31 2015 UTC,"I'm really glad you said that. I'm a warren fan too, I understand both sides and why people think he's creepy, but I wish people would wait until all the episodes until they fully judge him. It feels like people love to bash him without having all the context, especially since there's really only been 2 warren and max conversations"
lifeisstrange,3dvksb,max_caulfield_,2,Mon Jul 20 01:42:07 2015 UTC,thank you max!
lifeisstrange,3dvksb,TrekMek,0,Mon Jul 20 02:50:17 2015 UTC,"After reading posts I realized that I might have been too easy on Warren when he asked me to the movie. As a guy IRL I was rejected so much it hurts. So I thought of being a little more friendly. EDIT: [SPOILERS] I kissed Chloe(because guy) then rewinded. Seemed to weird, when I take Max's place. But sure, If I had to chose it is indeed Pricefield."

Just like I have a problem with feminism, this problem is caused by the radical feminists who are out for female superiority instead of equality, the word has been bastardized by the likes of, say, Anita Sarkeesian. Thus changing people's opinion toward the subject.  I agree with the original SJW movement, but not the ships flying the flag these days."

I think this game is awesome because its one of those rare games that is sort of a time capsule of the mid 2010's, rather than an attempt at a ""timeless"" setting (pun not intended).

Maybe it's because I'm in her age group (I'm 19) and I'm a lot like her, but most of the stuff regarding the ""memes"" or whatever that people find to be cringe-worthy, I find to be an insight on her character and a realistic portrayal of teens today who are like her.  There is so much of this fandom that doesn't seem to understand what it's like to be our age in this time at all, actually. Like the people saying that ""hella"" is not a word people realistically use. XD I'm basically Max's age, I live in Oregon, I cannot tell you how many people - countless amounts - say ""hella"" in my age group.

A lot of the hate I've seen is from guys who flip a shit when they can't play Whitebread Dudebro 9000 in every fucking game. Also, people who struggle with empathy in general.  Though I'm guessing the meme stuff is about the dialogue. The people who complain about that are either too young or grew up in a region where kids didn't speak like that. My friends and I absolutely talked like that in high school. Which to be fair, was in the early to mid 2000s. But it strikes me as the way artsy kids would talk. I mean kids in general can say some pretty cringey stuff, but when you're young and creative, playing with language can be pretty exciting. So IMO the dialogue is fairly realistic."
lifeisstrange,3dtxa5,TheIngloriousTaco,2,Sun Jul 19 22:38:42 2015 UTC,"i largely agree with this. the kids in this game are like at a particular intersection of overachiever/artsy -- they totally talk like that.  my main issue with the dialogue in this game was ""amazeballs"". that and some of the bitchy stuff Victoria says feels a little too contrived."

I think it's more about how people perceive others playing a game about a hipster girl going through every day teen struggles than playing as an advanced military soldier shooting at everything that move. It's an easy target for criticism because it's different and story-driven; something that's very rare in games these days.   I don't know. That's just me. Then again, I don't pay attention to memes and shit. Never really did, so even if they are trying to say something about a meme, I wouldn't pick up on the reference.

And sometimes when not just to have fun :) Why wouldn't these 18 year-old characters?  For me it's a sign of good writing when characters in a story talk about things they know even if or especially if the audience/reader/player doesn't (yet), e.g. Chloe talking about her stepshit or stepass in her very first scene. Or when they reference things that are part of their world even when it's not important to the story. Makes it all feel real.  I'd also like to know what parts are thought cringey by native speakers (I'm not). Is this really worse than TV series dialogue? :). To me only what Justin says sounds strange."

lifeisstrange,3dqnys,rrainmaker,17,Sat Jul 18 20:49:04 2015 UTC,"I'd assume a follow up tweet like that means that it actually will be announced shortly, I'd assume somewhere around tomorrow."
lifeisstrange,3dqnys,lislislislislis,42,Sat Jul 18 15:09:28 2015 UTC,"I feel like this is the classic scenario where the marketing guys make a lot of promises and then the engineering side is like ""SHIT SHIT SHIT why did you promise that""."
lifeisstrange,3dqnys,BostonTentacleParty,8,Sat Jul 18 15:42:40 2015 UTC,"I am a software engineer, and this sounds accurate to my experiences."
lifeisstrange,3dqnys,RasereiHojo,8,Sat Jul 18 21:26:20 2015 UTC,"Yes, but do you have the same definition of ""shortly"" as they do? Because my definition of the wait being ""nearly over"" was a day or two, and it's gone beyond that. Who's to say that their definition of ""shortly"" isn't three or our more days?  I mean, sure, they might actually announce the release date, but to me it's clear Dontnod is focusing on building the hype rather than passing along valid, accurate information. Which, you know, is how companies work, but..."
lifeisstrange,3dqnys,EpsilonSigma,3,Sat Jul 18 15:12:57 2015 UTC,"Well according to their first tweet, our definition of ""shortly"" differs greatly.  But the fact that they are making a follow up tweet(or.. reply technically) makes me think that they actually might announce the release date shortly.  And yea, wouldn't surprise me a great deal if they are just building up hype, not uncommon among companies indeed but it would disappoint me a lot."
lifeisstrange,3dqnys,masters1777,2,Sat Jul 18 15:15:37 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I feel like they're just trying to save face because they know the community is getting rowdy, especially after they let slip it wouldn't be out for two weeks."
lifeisstrange,3dqnys,A1var3z7,7,Sat Jul 18 21:15:57 2015 UTC,"I think they'll announce on the upcoming Tuesday and then probably release the following Tuesday, that's what I'm thinking."
lifeisstrange,3dqnys,hitch44,6,Sat Jul 18 18:21:59 2015 UTC,"Ok, DontNod and I definitely have different definitions of the word ""shortly""."
lifeisstrange,3dqnys,centerflag982,21,Sun Jul 19 01:38:12 2015 UTC,"If that is that is the release date, it's bullshit because that's 2 whole weeks after the deadline.   Entitled idiots. I want LiS to be a stable, enjoyable experience and with their impression that this ep is their most ambitious, it's especially important that there are no major bugs.  I can read a book, continue job hunting, catch up with my friends and LiS will come when it comes."
lifeisstrange,3dqnys,Khaosbreed,13,Sat Jul 18 17:50:31 2015 UTC,"Besides, what deadline? We were given a rough estimate of a release window, but that's all"
lifeisstrange,3dqnys,TweetPoster,1 point,Sat Jul 18 21:00:52 2015 UTC,"I don't think you mean entitled, perhaps disappointed or sad. I mean, I'm not going to sit around and wait for them to eventually get the next episode out some day in the next few months. That patience thing isn't in my nature. But instead of whining about it, I just stop caring about the game and move on."

lifeisstrange,3dqnys,Doom0,9,Sat Jul 18 15:12:43 2015 UTC,"Except they are. I'm not trying to be negative, and I still really appreciate the company for making a great game, but when people buy an episodic game where the creators have stated the episodes will be released on an 8 week schedule, it's reasonable for people to be upset when they break this schedule.  Some people are definitely overreacting, but it's not wrong to expect them to stick to their word, and be a little annoyed if we don't get any notice otherwise."
lifeisstrange,3dqnys,karlizkool350,6,Sat Jul 18 17:56:55 2015 UTC,"thing is tho, 6-8 weeks was an estimate, not a deadline.  there were no guarantees"
lifeisstrange,3dqnys,Sillywickedwitch,7,Sat Jul 18 18:24:38 2015 UTC,They've not once said that they would release a new episode every 8 weeks. They've said they want to release them around every 8 weeks which to me means 6-10 weeks which they're still within.
lifeisstrange,3dqnys,kingbanjee,4,Sat Jul 18 18:58:00 2015 UTC,"Have the developers actually stated that though? Because I couldn't find where the devs posted their release schedule. The only release schedules I could find were from third parties, such as video game news sites, steam forums, or reddit, etc."
lifeisstrange,3dqnys,Squishumz,3,Sat Jul 18 18:25:04 2015 UTC,They said the goal is 8 weeks. Not that it will be every 8 weeks. People need to be more respectful
lifeisstrange,3dqnys,kingbanjee,2,Sat Jul 18 20:55:40 2015 UTC,"When everyone is expecting 8 weeks, warranted or not, they should have realized people would get uppity around then with no release or set date."
lifeisstrange,3dqnys,AwesomeDewey,2,Sat Jul 18 21:06:22 2015 UTC,Well maybe people shouldn't expect something that was never set in stone.

lifeisstrange,3dqnys,Squishumz,0,Sat Jul 18 22:29:45 2015 UTC,Or what? You guys are gonna fight them? Lol what's in their best interests is not announcing anything unless they're for sure before some of you psychotic fuckers blow off a tit because the day they announce is delayed
lifeisstrange,3dqnys,kingbanjee,0,Sat Jul 18 22:40:26 2015 UTC,Are you forgetting that they're a company? People get pissed and are less likely to buy the game. You've clearly never been in marketing.
lifeisstrange,3dqnys,sheizlegend,0,Sat Jul 18 22:46:34 2015 UTC,"Lmfao, Every single one of you guys are still gonna buy a game. No one that's screaming about wanting it now is gonna not buy it because it's a few weeks after when they thought. They're clearly invested. And yes, I go to school for marketing, this has nothing to do with any of that. They've said countless times that they don't know exactly when but it's near completion. They're avoiding setting a release date in stone just in case. You sound like an impatient baby."

Wether u get hyped or not is totally your descion. If you want good quality it takes time to make games/animation/movies etc. I undrstand it is for ppl's entertainment but having a little undrstanding would be nice. Im sure game devs are working their ass off as we r sitting here bitching about oh mai gawd when i can play this game. I know for a fact that sometimes in major studios people wont go to their homes and stay overnight. The answer to all this is: stop waiting for announcments ,live your life and when it comes out enjoy it. Again sorry for the lang."

It's unhealthy, it doesn't help make the game better, and at the end of the day it's like bad parents giving in when their kid is throwing a tantrum over a popsicle or something.  I don't want to be patronizing either, but I'm with you, really, all these people making up ""promises"" or ""deadlines"" out of their asses just because they're letting primal feelings of greed take over their keyboard and their brain, that too is unhealthy."

lifeisstrange,3drdfr,Cptcutter81,7,Sun Jul 19 09:20:02 2015 UTC,"I've always maintained that the alternate timeline is just the universes way of really obviously and bluntly explaining to max that she can't just go fucking with major events in time, or things go very wrong. I'm amazed she's so surprised at how different things turned out.  Plus, it foreshadows what I'm expecting to be the whole ""Chloe has to die"" finale thing which will piss off about 80% of the player-base."
lifeisstrange,3drdfr,lislislislislis,4,Sun Jul 19 08:07:35 2015 UTC,"someone pointed out that if Max is unconscious in Timeline A, she might get taken to the hospital, which would give you a chance to see Kate when you wake up there.  I think something is going to force Max's hand (like in the actual plot, not just storytelling necessity). I'm hoping they don't imply that being disabled is a fate worse than death.  Maybe it will turn out Joyce is dead. Maybe the world will keep getting increasingly unstable (natural disasters, whatever) and Max will have to undo everything.  The new power seemed to have been implemented as an actual game feature, not just a cut scene, so we might see it again with other photos. But I think the game ends in the original timeline."
lifeisstrange,3drdfr,Infamy7,4,Sat Jul 18 22:22:04 2015 UTC,"I honestly don't know how Dontnod plans to tie this all together, the story can go pretty much anywhere from this point on. I have so many questions.   The thing I'm most curious about is where the hell did Alternative Max go when Original Max popped into the alternative timeline? ALT Max seems like she did similar things like going to Seattle, getting into photography, going to Blackwell, etc. OG Max has no memory her life the past 5 years in the alternative timeline, and has no idea what else has changed.   People seem to think OG Max is either passed out/disappeared in the original timeline. But at what point does that happen? Does it happen while she is observing the past with William, or after she changes it to the alternative?   Can Max even get back? We have seen her lose her powers before with the Kate scenario; and also have health complications the more she rewinds time. This was a pretty big, drastic, change. What if the event that triggers the timetravel abilities in the first place doesn't happen in this timeline?  Tl;dr- going off the deepend waiting for Ep4"
lifeisstrange,3drdfr,Ara-Player,4,Sun Jul 19 01:45:09 2015 UTC,"Throughout the game no matter what we do we will constantly jump between the 2 timelines to gain more and more information like in Groundhog Day. That's how I see it, that's how I've always seen it.  Of course they wont force us to stay there, and it's gonna be dumb if we won't get to do anything in the new timeline at all, cause then it seems that they did that EP3 ending and introduced a new power Max has just for shock value. Like they don't know what to do and then they just do something that will not have relevance to the plot at all."
lifeisstrange,3drdfr,MainaC,4,Sat Jul 18 20:11:23 2015 UTC,"I don't think we'll be doing any investigation. They're too different.  What might be interesting is if Max learns to carry over items or use her ""teleport"" so that things she can access in one universe but not the other can be utilized.  But given that both her location and her ""inventory"" seems to get reset to the time of the photo, I doubt we'll get that, either.  I don't expect inter-universe interplay."
lifeisstrange,3drdfr,Ara-Player,2,Sun Jul 19 01:49:33 2015 UTC,"Photo travel is different than the regular travel. Max doesn't retain objects and clothing with her, everything is completely rewinded."
lifeisstrange,3drdfr,i1ocos,3,Mon Jul 20 11:04:36 2015 UTC,"Timeline that we created isnt for any investigation. Its less-more same world where Max just happened to be shortly friends with Vortex mobs but I dont know how that will help, all this was just to show alternative Chloe and we can go easily back in first few minutes of game. There is no point in switching between these two timelines.  My bet is that Max will assume that going so far into past and changing thigs there will only fuck up things. I think we will use photos that are very old just as flashbacks. But also is possible that all that photos what we have been taking thruout game we will use to change our decisions and see them how they affect present in real time. Maybe that is point of these opinional photos."
lifeisstrange,3drdfr,Infamy7,3,Sat Jul 18 20:25:05 2015 UTC,"Of course they wont force us to stay there, and it's gonna be dumb if we won't get to do anything in the new timeline at all, cause then it seems that they did that EP3 ending and introduced a new power Max has just for shock value.    This is the problem with alternate timeline/universe in stories, more often than not it becomes a logical cluster-fuck. Also, each time you ""jump"" between them, the emotional investment lessens (as character choices get spread all about the place). Look too much into it and it becomes so easy to pick apart the holes.  Suspending your disbelief, trusting the writer and accepting the ""timey wimey stuff"" is probably the best way of enjoying it although it can feel slightly patronizing."
lifeisstrange,3drdfr,TrashhQueen,3,Sat Jul 18 21:04:37 2015 UTC,And the story has to end rather quickly; this is a short game. In the end it's most likely going to come down to a love/hate thing amongst the fans. What a hell of a fucking ride though.
lifeisstrange,3drdfr,Triddy,2,Sun Jul 19 02:05:34 2015 UTC,"Yeah im thinking the same thing. I feel like we are still at the beginning of the game, like theres so much story to unfold and so many unanswered questions. But its hard to believe we are now moving towards the end rather quickly"
lifeisstrange,3drdfr,MainaC,0,Sun Jul 19 12:59:05 2015 UTC,"I don't like this point:   Max. Max do not remember this life. Now imagine if you would come to this point and found yourself living life of different person. She is totally lost in that timeline and there is no way that she would catch up knowledge of all that time without anybody noticing her very weird acting.   Here's my answer to it:   Hi! I just spent the last 5 years in Seattle, so I don't really know what's going on in town. Mind filling me in? So great to see you again!"
lifeisstrange,3dr55v,MrLorenz,8,Sat Jul 18 17:35:53 2015 UTC,EDIT: I forgot to mention that still it's absolutely awesome how much attention to detail was paid whilst the production of this game and that it's great fun to find all these connections between science and what happens in-game.
lifeisstrange,3dr55v,rrainmaker,2,Sat Jul 18 17:59:04 2015 UTC,"Thank you. Even though it is hard to read, it was pretty fun.  OK. I get that you are thinking Arcadia Bay of a closed system. It is true that overall entropy will increase over time through some reactions, evetually when entropy is maximum, storm will come.   I am not an expert, but how have you decided that the storm was spontenaous and bound to happen? I mean ice melts at room temperature but not at 0 degrees celsius. I am not sure how we could model the Arcadia Bay as closed system either."
lifeisstrange,3dr55v,Satile,3,Sat Jul 18 18:13:29 2015 UTC,"The Universe itself is a closed system. Everything in it is subject to entropy. But for Max to be able to put energy in Arcadia Bay would have to be an open system,you're right about that. But if you increase energy inside an open system you will also get an increase in entropy. The storm therefore is a result of Max merging energy into the ""system"" Arcadia Bay."
lifeisstrange,3dr55v,Satile,4,Sat Jul 18 20:58:35 2015 UTC,"Amazeballs. I get more out of this stuff than the random theories. You can start to see where the developers start to get their ideas from.  So, first and foremost, thanks for taking the time to (learn) write all this!  A few questions for your brain:  A) ""So if you'd actually want to make time stop you'd have to ... create an extremely strong gravitational field - just like a supermassive black hole""  Each Episode in the game reveals another facet of Max's powers. What happens if Max can do the opposite of this? Let's say she has the power to stop/reverse time (black holes).  What if she gets the ""power"" of a white hole? Can you think of a practical application for that, in terms of game-play? Does that become fast-forwarding time or would it have another effect?  B) Since I'm a sucker for it, does the 1st Law of Thermodynamics destroy the ""Multiple Max's"" theory?  C) ""Now if you combine these two [sic] one conclusion is that within a closed system entropy can not decrease""  Wouldn't the opposite also be true, i.e. entropy can not increase? If this can be assumed, what does this mean for Arcadia Bay physics for future episodes? Are they just out the window at that point?  D) What does your expensive brain think about Polarization? It's the title for the 5th Episode. I can only assume that it will play a huge part."
lifeisstrange,3dr55v,AwkwardMassEffectFan,6,Sat Jul 18 20:12:09 2015 UTC,"A) Do you mean this in a ""mass reduction"" way? If yes, then reducing mass to almost 0 would make Max able to move at almost the speed of light (though producing a contradiction when actually becoming 0 in mass as you'd have to divide by 0). ""Moving clocks go slower"" (specific relativty theory): This would mean she'd age extremely slowly (fractional in relation to the other people) I see how this could be interesting in terms of gameplay ;)  B) This is a hard one to aswer. It really depends on whether you say there is only one Universe (as the word it self implies unus = one; versus= faced inward) or if you belive in Multiverses,meaning there can be multiple universes existing simultaneously and if you think that they would be coherent in terms of what they contain. To create a connection you'd need to introduce (and more importantly *find) more dimensions. So in a Universe? I'd say no,there can be no two instances of the same person at any given point. In a Multiverse? I'm not sure,but could well be possible. It's a shame the game doesn't come with a sheet stating if it's a Universe or a Multiverse ;) For me though it's a Universe and therefore yes it would destroy this theory.  C) Entropy will always increase unless time itself stops. In a closed system Entropy cannot decrease. In an open system you'd need to apply energy. There also is the possibility of Arcadia Bay being an open System inside the closed system of the universe (wich would be required for Max to have any influence on it).  D) Polrarization is about oscillation (a kind of vibration) of light waves. The Episodes name is quite a catch as unpolarized waves change direction fast and go undirected (disordered). The state of polarization describes the amount of order in this. I guess you already see where they are going with this ;) A polarized wave has order. I think they've chosen this title superbly as it is ambiguous with photographic terminology where a polarization filter is used to filter out light that swings ""with the wrong wavelength"" ;)"
lifeisstrange,3dr55v,Onon6,2,Sat Jul 18 21:36:55 2015 UTC,"Spit-balling some nonsense ideas here. Warning.  A)  Going back to LiS's game-play: So does this mean every time Max rewinds, she's technically a little older?  Example:  Point 1) She decides A over B;   Point 2) She rewinds to change her answer to B;   Point 3) She is now older in ""Point 1"" than she was the first time through. She has already lived, learned, and (ever-so-slightly) grown through the experience. Is this accurate?   (Crazy Theory Time, Multiple Max's) Could this explain how Homeless Max is 50 while Chloe is still 17? Max has rewound time so many times (she's so ""unpolarized"") that she has now visibly aged. As a side note, this must take into account Multiverse, as there is a younger Max (our Max) walking around with Chloe.   C) But doesn't Law 1 state that energy can't be destroyed or created? If entropy increases, isn't it already breaking that Law? I assume I'm missing a puzzle piece here. If I am, I apologize.  D) Seems like Episode 5 is going to be a crazy time-traveling adventure (which kind of leads back to A) and time-traveling physically affecting Max). I bet the last scene will be Max being ""Polarized"". Maybe Rachel was ""Polarized"" too :o"
lifeisstrange,3dr55v,Onon6,2,Sat Jul 18 22:57:39 2015 UTC,"A) Basically yes,tough this would represent a kind of twin paradox. I personally don't think we have more than one Max roaming Arcadia Bay.   C) I think you may have gotten that twisted. Energy can not be created,that's right. It can only be transformed/transferred. One could say energy drives entropy along but they're not the same. I actually just replayed Episode 3 and think I am sure now that it's a Universe with a definite time arrow (direction) as the pictures in the end (the ones with Joyce and David etc.) are destroyed. That implies Max has rather rewritten things than jumped to a different timeline (which would make a Multiverse necessary).  D) As I said polarizing is a way of creating order. I think the episode will finally order the chaos Max (or propably Rachel) has/have created. I am almost sure we'll never meet her though."
lifeisstrange,3dr55v,kronj,4,Sun Jul 19 22:42:26 2015 UTC,"Hey, great read! :) Also made me think of something I saw on a playthrough some weeks ago. I saw the graffiti ""W.A.S.T.E"" a couple of times times and decided to google it and one of the results were a band called ""We All Seek Total Entropy"". Not saying it means anything, this just reminded me of it :)   It was written on Kate's notepad in the start of Ep 1 and on a mailbox behind the small ""hut"" beside the traintracks in Ep2."
lifeisstrange,3dr55v,Onon6,5,Sun Jul 19 10:30:02 2015 UTC,Great find! At the level of detail the devs put into this game I do think this may be the meaning they want to imply. Glad you liked it ;)
lifeisstrange,3dr55v,Fancy-Bear1776,8,Sun Jul 19 12:06:21 2015 UTC,"Really interesting read ! Allthough I do have to mention; Max's visions of the tornado are events that do happen in the future. She even says she ""could feel the electricity in the air"" and blacks out during these 'visions'. This suggests she actually moves forward in time rather than 'dream' about it, making her time-travel into the near future. Even though you mentioned she did not in your article.  All by all, thanks for putting some time together to write this article. Great explanation of entropy also !"
lifeisstrange,3dr55v,Th3HolyMoose,3,Sat Jul 18 18:03:35 2015 UTC,You're right I guess. I was referring to her rewinding and totally forgot about the visions. My bad. This makes the whole thing more porpable though ;)
lifeisstrange,3dr55v,Sorefury,2,Sat Jul 18 18:07:10 2015 UTC,"No problem, it doesn't make your article any less good. Just thought I'd let you know :)"
lifeisstrange,3dr55v,Davkilla101,3,Sat Jul 18 18:10:24 2015 UTC,"The ""visions"" could be the present (that is, the game begins on Friday during the storm) and everything else we're seeing is a rewind/flashback. When you start messing with time travel, it's all relative, really. Different interpretations can be equally valid."
lifeisstrange,3dr55v,Davkilla101,5,Sat Jul 18 18:31:51 2015 UTC,"Yeah I know, I was writing this under the assumption that we are playing in the present because that seemed most logical to me. But your statement is completely valid and I do agree that might be the case. Entropy and time(-travel) are such abstract terms as well so I suppose there are a million ways of looking at it."
lifeisstrange,3dr55v,Davkilla101,2,Sat Jul 18 18:38:05 2015 UTC,"Thank you for not only putting so much effort into this, but for also smoothly providing examples and how these theories come into play with LiS!  Although I have to ask; do you think that certain catastrophes (like what happens with Kate) are simply immune to Max's efforts to alternate the future with her rewind powers simply because Max has not put enough energy in contrast with the entropy or simply because it's bound to happen no matter what?"
lifeisstrange,3dr55v,Davkilla101,3,Sat Jul 18 20:23:49 2015 UTC,"If you'd take Arcadia Bay as an open System which it would have to be for Max to actively influence it's entropy she might be able to delay things. As for Kate, I think it already was quite propable that she'd attempt suicide (given her torment and bullying) wich goes along with the law."

lifeisstrange,3dqp8m,SoundSmith323,2,Sat Jul 18 15:07:17 2015 UTC,"This is my take on the soundtrack for Life is Strange. I guess you could call it a part cover, part original composition, and part remix (sort of?). I don’t really know what to call it, but it sounds pretty neat imo, so that’s cool. I originally wrote this to be posted with the release of Episode 4 this week, but delays and stuff happened, and I’m tired of waiting, so here it is."
lifeisstrange,3dqp8m,Ik4rus,2,Sat Jul 18 15:07:34 2015 UTC,"I like the song, but the guitar sounds kind of off to me. Is it completely computer generated or did you record it?"
lifeisstrange,3dqp8m,Ik4rus,2,Sat Jul 18 18:01:10 2015 UTC,"I don't know why you got downvoted, you're right. The guitar was a patch run through Kontakt. It's a nice patch, but there's not enough variation in the strumming patterns, and it ends up sounding kind of off, like you said.   I would record it live, but the song is in a weird key and I lost my capo (That and I suck at bar chords :P)  Once I get a new one, I'll probably record it live and re-upload."

lifeisstrange,3dr035,ramahlive,13,Sat Jul 18 16:50:37 2015 UTC,"Maybe Max is actually MAX-1000, a terminator with a built in time travel device.  She goes back in time to assassinate Chloe Price, the future leader of the human resistance.    However the resistance sends Rachel Amber, an elite undercover agent, to pose as Chloe's friend and protect her from the robots.  MAX tracks Chloe down but before she has a chance to attack, Rachel fights and defeats MAX.    At this point either Rachel dies from her wounds or has to return to the future (it's unclear so they can leave open the possibility of a sequel).  We then find out that MAX was actually not defeated, but only severely damaged.  The only functional system MAX has left is her hipster-photographer-teen girl cover subroutine.  She also knows Chloe is important, but doesn't know why.    That brings us to the start of the game.  Seeing Chloe again causes some of her programming to be restored. Specifically her time travel device starts working again, but only in a limited fashion.    By the end of the game we will have restored most of MAX's primary systems and will have to make a choice.  Either robots must always obey their programming and MAX has to eliminate Chloe once and for all, or we find that robots can have free will and MAX sides with Chloe to try to save the human species from annihilation by robot (robonihilation?).  And this has been the stupidest thing I've ever written."

Because It's impossible to set up a delay with her camera, and the game completely glosses over that fact. this has been bothering me since episode 1 and no one else really gives a shit. My theory is she took that photo of herself somehow on Friday, as objects she rewinds stick with her. then during the tornado scene in the beginning which is not a flashback but her on friday she rewinds back to Monday before being killed by the falling lighthouse. Then by breaking a photograph in half that hadn't been taken yet she causes the whole butterfly effect over the next 4 episodes. Sorry for the unorganized rant, early and cranky with no ep4 news."

(because that represents her initial presence of where the past and present merged, creating a new timeline.)  and maybe, just maybe.. whether ""Max was here"" or not at the junkyard... creating a connection with Rachel, when and where Chloe might not have been able to... there's quite a few breadcrumbs laying around that might tie the new timeline with the old... but remain purely optional.   it's really quite the question of how they'll handle all that... though, I'd admit, I'm expecting a few plotholes."

lifeisstrange,3dpien,UndeadGimpParade,2,Sat Jul 18 09:02:00 2015 UTC,"she still might be missing in this new timeline...   yet it would make sense if Max replaces Chloe as a connection, but its difficult to figure out what has changed and what has more or less stayed the same... as apparently Max still moved to Seattle or somewhere, only recently returned... anyway.  It's even more difficult to access how Chloe and Rachel still might be connected... there's the potential they still became friends, but the dynamics of that friendship may have been dramatically shifted.   Or there's the possibilities that Chloe wasn't the only victim of the accident... which would be a good move story wise if Chloe is not only dealing with being paralyzed, but potentially living with killing Rachel.. in this timeline -- if we're forced to choose between timelines.   of course, if she did that... then given we've got this scales and balance thing in play, who takes Rachel's place... as that plot still appears to be moving forward in both timelines -- I might need to review that ending video and scan the cast a few more times ...   but then, there's still the question of the junkyard bit, whether or not ""Max was here"" and other options, variables, hints suggested through the game...   Chloe pretty much spelled it out for us how Rachel might have felt about Max, possibly even siding with Max over Chloe...  albeit, Rachel did seem to be a bit of a player, might have genuinely cared about the people around her, but ultimately willing to use them as a tool to get the hell out of Arcadia... hollywood or bust.  if she does exist in this timeline, what version is she...  is it possible that Max took her place... its kind of the suggestion from what we know of her and her group dynamics on the campus...   those questions to the guest list... cleared, didn't clear names... and how that plays out in this timeline...   I don't know...  too many variables, but they all curve towards the same direction...   probably better to work backwards instead of forward from the arcing plots...   kind of think there's several plots, it would be easy to tie the drugging into the mix... but I think it's separate.   then, of course, there's the issues that Arcadia hasn't faced 'weather' like this for a hundred years, the banner from the school spread over the first visit to the storm.. from the early 1900s...  the shift of the vortex club from freaks and geeks to a skull and cross bones sort of cult like frat/sorority... Tobanga and the creative energies running beneath the school...   and the question if Samuel talks with squirrels is still looking through the prism of this fractured multiverse..."
lifeisstrange,3dpien,UndeadGimpParade,2,Sat Jul 18 09:46:09 2015 UTC,"^ namely because max isn't in the photo, so it eliminates time traveler max from the scene.. or at least becomes the horizon event to return to or possibly replay the events as they originally were -- a photo in the past that shouldn't exist, i.e. wasn't destroyed / rewritten like the others were... because it was caught in the bubble.

lifeisstrange,3dpa8v,kemando,14,Sat Jul 18 03:36:06 2015 UTC,"I was in the same boat as you, tbh. After episode 2 I kinda expected Max ""leveled up!"" her time manipulation powers and that there'd be some puzzles down the road that involved stopping time. Then again, the game does make it a point to show how exhausting it was for her to freeze time; so exhausting that she wasn't able to use her time powers at all for awhile after.  I'm feel almost certain, however, that we'll at least see the ""photo jumping"" power again. I still think that'll be Max's best bet at getting back to Timeline A... but, of course, I could totally be wrong.  Honestly? I think the game wouldn't have been hurt by a new time mechanic such as freezing time, so long as they handled it well and didn't make it too complicated or whatever. But I don't think it hurts the game that much with them only using it as a plot device either."
lifeisstrange,3dpa8v,SunDropLover,7,Sat Jul 18 03:46:13 2015 UTC,"As a game mechanic, there's nothing you could do with stopped time that you can't do with rewinding time. And the ""photo jumping"" would have too much flexibility to give the player free reign; it will probably be used as a plot device, but not usable by the player.  However, you're right that max expands her powers towards the end of each episode, so the middle/end of EP4 might unveil an entirely new mechanic. I'd love it if that happened, but I don't really expect it."
lifeisstrange,3dpa8v,zqwefty,3,Sat Jul 18 05:29:15 2015 UTC,My money's on bringing a passenger back with Max via touching or some other way.
lifeisstrange,3dpa8v,spookycatlover,4,Sat Jul 18 05:31:23 2015 UTC,I feel like in episode 5 we are going to see a combination of all her different powers being used in some epic way. Will probably cause a lot of nose bleeding though.   I'm certain though if the situation really calls for it that max can somehow freeze time again. I feel like if it was easy she would do it all the time.
lifeisstrange,3dpa8v,onefinegent,3,Sat Jul 18 06:04:32 2015 UTC,"I don't believe that the power to freeze time is one max would be able to control in the futur episodes. As it had only taken affect after she strained her powers to the limit. It was sort of a cosmic overheat, and she needed a cool down before things could start up again (with slightly more time before she could rewind)"
lifeisstrange,3dpa8v,FlyingEevee,3,Sat Jul 18 04:11:03 2015 UTC,"ie, plot device."
lifeisstrange,3dpa8v,nutcrackr,3,Sat Jul 18 04:21:48 2015 UTC,"I think that the developers added the freeze power because you can basically do it with rewind, and we probably won't like watching Kate jumping off again and again."
lifeisstrange,3dpa8v,lislislislislis,2,Sun Jul 19 02:41:31 2015 UTC,"The freezing time was a cool one, but I think they wanted that section to feel quite different from the others. Specifically that you were struggling to hold time."
lifeisstrange,3dpa8v,Bond4141,2,Sat Jul 18 12:36:57 2015 UTC,"I wrongly assumed that she wasn't actually freezing time. Based on the visual effects it seemed more like ""rewind, stop for a moment, move forward, repeat"" but she was so freaked out she managed to make that happen incredibly fast.  from a practical standpoint i think we'll probably have a situation where we can choose which of several photos to go back to, but actually letting you do that freely and flexibly whenever you want would be too complicated and expensive to develop."

lifeisstrange,3doi3h,jessebona,2,Tue Jul 21 21:27:05 2015 UTC,He helps Max a few times in the episodes already released. The problem is so far he's always tried to leverage something out of it each time. Friendship doesn't mean you do something in exchange for something else and he'll be a better person if he ever figures that out.
lifeisstrange,3doi3h,monky9997891,3,Sat Jul 18 13:07:54 2015 UTC,"That's a bit unfair.  Do you honestly think that Warren wasn't going to ask Max to see that film with him had he not gotten in Nathan's way?  Do you think the only reason he put himself in danger like that was so that he could gain leverage?  I certainly don't.  Warren cares a lot about Max--that much is clear.  People tend to look out for those that they care about.  When Max said, ""I owe you one"" afterwards, that was the perfect opportunity for Warren to transition the subject.  It wasn't a means of leverage, but a means of initiation.  Personally, I said yes--not because I felt obliged to, but because I wanted to.  If I didn't want to, then I'd've said no, and I bet Warren knew that."
lifeisstrange,3doi3h,jessebona,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:25:38 2015 UTC,"Remember when she said ""I owe you one"" and his response was more or less ""yes you do""? That's not what friends do. That exchange shows he expects something out of it. Warren doesn't know that, if you say no he immediately says he's going to ask someone else as if it would make you jealous and never stops bugging you about it all the way through episode 3. He's not some misunderstood good guy."
lifeisstrange,3doi3h,monky9997891,3,Sat Jul 18 22:08:47 2015 UTC,"These two are friends.  They can say things to one another that may seem a little bit out there--I do it all the time to my friends.  And knowing Warren's sense of humor, I wouldn't put it past him to pull on her leg a bit.  As far as I'm concerned, ""Yes you do"" equates to ""I might bring this up again in the future."""
lifeisstrange,3doi3h,jessebona,2,Mon Jul 20 05:16:33 2015 UTC,Right because it sounded like he was joking.
lifeisstrange,3doi3h,jessebona,2,Mon Jul 20 06:49:36 2015 UTC,If that's how most people see him there has to be something to it right? We can't all be imagining Warren is pushy and creepy.
lifeisstrange,3doi3h,monky9997891,2,Sat Jul 18 06:52:29 2015 UTC,"That's 100% how he came off to me, as soon as I saw the like, 12 texts in a row with no responses. I've met people like that, they're creepy. lol, and he's VERY pushy, he brings up the drive in and ""going ape"" every other sentence."
lifeisstrange,3doi3h,KaiG1987,7,Sat Jul 18 06:35:47 2015 UTC,"Are you talking about the 12 texts that were spread out over the course of a couple days?  I've read all of Warren's messages.  None of them came off as creepy.  Regarding the ""going ape"" comment, it just seemed like he was excited about going to the movies with Max.  What's wrong with that?  I get excited about going to the movies with friends.  Besides, when it's the subject of the conversation, I'd expect it get brought up pretty frequently."
lifeisstrange,3doi3h,OneJobToRuleThemAll,2,Sat Jul 18 06:57:47 2015 UTC,"On the one hand, I feel he's trying too hard and is sending too many texts. On the other hand, I feel bad for him that Max didn't bother to answer any of those texts (three separate occasions IIRC)."
lifeisstrange,3doi3h,Bodomi,2,Sat Jul 18 19:55:21 2015 UTC,"That's usually when you get the hint. But we kinda know max can just be a straight up bitch sometimes, like who leaves their friend and just doesn't make any attempt to talk for 5 years, like how did that even happen. I think we need more background here."

lifeisstrange,3doi3h,jessebona,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:25:56 2015 UTC,"I don't really have that big of a problem with Warren, I said yes to going ape but when he said that stuff about ""Oh, well that usually means no sex.""(I can't remember exactly when he said this but he said it in as a response to something Max said), that kinda changed my view on things, that he is basically just trying to have sex with Max."
lifeisstrange,3doi3h,Khaosbreed,7,Sat Jul 18 14:19:26 2015 UTC,"Whoah. Never realized the Warren/Alyssa thing. Now I'm convinced Warren is creepy/a scum hitting on 3 girls at the same time. :S  I thought he was exception to the ""Bad things at Blackwell"" situation, but I guess not."

lifeisstrange,3doqpl,Someone7272,35,Sat Jul 18 00:32:02 2015 UTC,Possible explanation is Max teleporting behind a locked door carrying the components for a bomb. Chloe could of put it together on her own.
lifeisstrange,3doqpl,SkateboardCop,23,Sat Jul 18 01:03:45 2015 UTC,"I think you're overthinking. She might have just assumed, because Max's clothes stay on her when she uses her power, so why wouldn't whatever she's holding stay with her?"
lifeisstrange,3doqpl,spongyruler,16,Sat Jul 18 01:50:47 2015 UTC,I wonder what would happen if she held onto a PERSON

lifeisstrange,3doqpl,kemando,4,Sat Jul 18 03:29:52 2015 UTC,What I want to see is Max taking a picture with alternate history Chloe and go back to regular Chloe time and show her although I don't know if that'll cause a paradox or something
lifeisstrange,3doqpl,9000cody,2,Sat Jul 18 04:21:32 2015 UTC,"Assuming the only way between timelines is via ""picture rewind"" it seems to be clear she doesn't keep items on her person (as witnessed by her clothes changing from Rachel's and her position changing as well, which doesn't happen with her traditional rewind.) It seems taking things between the timelines would be impossible, based on what we know so far."
lifeisstrange,3doqpl,kemando,2,Sat Jul 18 04:23:27 2015 UTC,"Considering it's now in a new timeline, I doubt Max's powers can reach that far back. I have a theory that Max will, early on in episode 4, find the same photo, and then not do anything, to kind of ""fix"" episode 3's ending."
lifeisstrange,3doqpl,mrminun,4,Sat Jul 18 10:16:43 2015 UTC,"My theory is that she could sort of ""carry"" someone back in time with her if they held onto eachother, maybe (physically) connected by something like handcuffs."
lifeisstrange,3doqpl,jacobthehunter,2,Sat Jul 18 02:30:08 2015 UTC,I'm hoping beyond hope that we'll find out in episode 4.

She kind of rattled off a plan off the top of her head, and then faltered at the end, unsure of what she was saying anymore. Then Max stepped in and said ""I got this"". I never got the impression that Chloe's plan was based on any real forethought."

lifeisstrange,3doqpl,Gvaz,5,Sat Jul 18 00:43:50 2015 UTC,Max has teleported behind doors several times in EP3. I think Chloe assumes Max can simply do her magic.
lifeisstrange,3doqpl,DominoNo-,3,Sat Jul 18 12:05:12 2015 UTC,"Well, for one Max warped around with the bomb in the office. And secondly, I'd wager she just took it for granted like that, without considering that nothing would change. cause you know... she's pretty ""LETS JUST DO THIS"""
lifeisstrange,3doqpl,SunbatherValley,2,Sat Jul 18 12:16:28 2015 UTC,"I don't think she has to know that that's possible, just that Max could steal the keys with her power.    We just happened to use the ability to keep items after rewind to get them."

Mainly because of it's mysterious plot, what happened to Rachel, what will happen in the next episode, what happened with Kate, theories upon theories... it's what keeps the subreddit alive anyway. None of that would be possible if it would all be released in one, because of the pacing problem. And it's always fun to review choices and I am more happy and anxious when the time is close to a release of a new episode rather than pissed of. My personal view.  P.S / Edit: The lack of communication is what's pissing most of us off. Not the wait. I agree, they could have said it would come back later DAYS before they did.  P.P.S / Edit Edit: You should be glad it's 2 months because telltale's release dates are much more longer and sporadic, they never tell you when it's going to be released until 2 weeks before... I hope the same doesn't happen with LiS"

On a longer game you can never know how it'll be consumed and it's harder to control the pace.  Yes the delays sometime seem long. What I do is I have 2 saves for the game, I play once on my principal save when the episode comes out and I replay it on my ""opposite choices"" save 4 weeks later.  I'm also pretty patient and prefer to see an episode delayed 2 weeks if it's polished and deliver exactly what dontnod wanted than get my new episode on time with a 1/3 of the content cut or buggy."

Not a solid deadline. How can they delay something if they never had a release date in the first place? They are finishing the episode, making sure there's no bugs, glitches, audio errors etc, so we don't experience any inconveniences when playing.  Also, have you SEEN the episode planner for Life Is Strange? The first episode was incredibly complicated - imagine the chaos that will be episode 4, accounting for ALL the major and minor choices YOU made in the game. This is an incredibly complicated game, and for such a complex story, taking a bit more time than WE want is okay.   We are all dying waiting for episode 4, but anyone complaining about the 'delays' need to remember they can't delay something that never got confirmed in the first place.   Be grateful of the fact that the first episode did well in the first place. They simply could not afford to make a full scale game on the budget they had, and couldn't afford to make more than what the first episode contained ''just in case''. They finish one episode, and immediately start on another. I don't understand how one can complain about the work they are putting in just because it doesn't suit them."

Please remember that I am a huge fan and I truly love their work, as well as I understand that this is a hella complicated story.

Whether or not episodic series or good or not, doesn't change it was the only option available for DONTNOD sadly.   I get you - the wait is torturous. Hell, I'd be in work and would be begging for wi-fi off of someone's hotspot so I can check if there's an announcement yet. It's killing me, but I also can see it from DONTNOD's side.

Once again, the internet demonstrates its utter lack of patience.  You're complaining about three days on a soft release schedule that was never set in stone?  On ""the wait is nearly over""?  Come on, chillax a moment!   ... but for a lot of gamers all over the world these delays are a dissapointment.   Genuine question - what delays?  What makes you think anything has been ""delayed""?  The release schedule has always been described as an approximation - a soft target.  They've never said ""it will be 8 weeks exactly"".  I think the hardest I've ever seen  them state it was something like ""we're still aiming for the 8 week mark"".  And now you're here writing a big diatribe because we're at the 8 weeks and three days mark?  Come on, this is utter absurdity!    When you say ""please address your issues"", can you first provide your reasoning for why you think they are currently facing any issues?  Maybe there have been some development issues?  But maybe this episode is just a bit larger than the others, maybe some of the scenes just require a bit more work than previous episodes?  Maybe it's just a 9 week job instead of an 8 week job?    Seriously, I feel sorry for Dontnod right now.  So many people acting so seemingly irrational within the community.  ""My beloved entertainment product is taking marginally longer to produce than estimated ... unacceptable!""  First world problems. ;-)"
lifeisstrange,3dqe7i,mikealwy,3,Sat Jul 18 15:53:46 2015 UTC,"As /u/keichunyan said, there was never a delay, there hasn't been an official release date or estimate, the ""8 week"" thing was an unofficial estimate. So don't say that anything was delayed.  I am not irritated by the wait. What irritates me is the refusal from Dontnod to say anything about the release time or what's taking so long. July 15'th we got this little hype tweet, and there as been no words since. This makes people, including me, check 24/7 if it's out yet or not, which is very annoying.  I think your decision of not playing Episode 4 is rather childish and you just throwing a fit, Telltale games was 110% worse than this, release time wise and actual game quality wise(in my opinion).  Dontnod has been close to bankruptcy, which is probably why they decided to make Life is Strange an episodic release(among other reasons) to even gain the money needed to fund the game.  If you can't deal with the wait between releases of an episodic game them I recommend you don't buy them. Did you except them to release 1 episode every week? Cmon mate, be realistic. Stop being a child and saying things such as ""people will stop playing episodic games"", you're ridiculous.  Saying that sales will decline because of this is false, saying that people will stop playing episodic games because of the god damned fact that it's episodic is ridiculous, people who purchase these games are aware(well, not you I guess) of the fact that you have to wait for episodes to get released.  Also, without an episodic style release, we wouldn't be here, you can trust me on that. This beautiful and awesome community would've never existed the way it does if this game wasn't released in an episodic format.  Let's hope the success of this game inspires Dontnod to start development on a Season 2 or more games similar to Life is Strange.  It will be sad to see this community slowly decay a bit after Episode 5 is out.  But back to my point, there is no need to throw a fit over Episode 4 not being released and coming up with things such as ""it was delayed"", it wasn't. Just deal with it, the annoying thing is Dontnod's small efforts to communicate with the community, but the fact that Episode 4 isn't out yet shouldn't bother you to this extent.  If any of you think that Episode 4 is not out yet because Dontnod is lazy then you're most utterly wrong and I'd call you childish. They are working on the game, polishing it etc... the more time they spend on it the better. Do you want an unfinished game with bugs or do you want to wait a bit more and receive a complete game that is 100% polished, clean and with more content?  I think the answer to that question is obvious.  The only criticism I have towards this specific case is the lack of communication.  Criticising Life is Strange and Dontnod for the actual episode not being released yet is ridiculous.  EDIT: Well speak of the devil, a release date will be announced shortly according to Life is Strange's Twitter."

lifeisstrange,3dqe7i,rrainmaker,2,Sat Jul 18 13:42:19 2015 UTC,"It's not like you learned that Life is Strange was an episodic game after episode 3. Dontnod talked about an 8 weeks gap between each episode from the beginning. You know you have the choice to wait until all the episodes are released to start playing an episodic game?   come on, this shouldn' happen. It could happen once, but it's the 3rd episode that comes delayed.   So it happened before and you get surprised and more frustrated every time. Fool me once shame on you, fool me twice shame on me, fool me thrice and I'll write a ridiculous rant on reddit?  This time between episode 3 and 4 part of the team was at E3 promoting the game, that was a week with some key team members away from the development in Paris so I get why they are a bit late. They are making the game for at least 5 or 6 platforms at the same time, they have to make each version and get certification for it on consoles. They are on a tight 8 weeks schedule to essentially shipping a new game, if they encounter a single issue on the way it will create a delay.    For the game developers, it's a money jackpot, for gamers - well, they are not so pissed off yet apparently   Why is it jackpot for the developer? You don't have to pay before all the episodes are released. Do you think they go all uncle scrooge with the season pass money instead of building the game. If anything with the sales of Episode 1 and season pass it probably give them an idea of how many games they are going to sell and revise their budget (either increase it and make the game better for us or lower it and avoid bankruptcy).  Now would it be nice if publishers and developers would just finish most of the episodes before they released the first one so people who don't have the patience to wait during long gaps between episodes can be happy and people who have the patience to wait between episodes and are happy with the way current releases work could go fuck themselves? Yes I guess."

Fool me once shame on you, fool me twice shame on me, fool me thrice and I'll write a ridiculous rant on reddit?   As mentioned before, it's not only about DontNod, it's about where this is going in the industry (episodic game series). Again, I love the game and not playing 4th episode in my case is not childish, I just rather want the fullest experience. :)   For the game developers, it's a money jackpot, for gamers - well, they are not so pissed off yet apparently   Games have a certain lifecycles, there are two phases that are important for game developers - pre-release and post-release. Both cycles are very important, in the pre-release it's more about the company itself and post-release it's more about us - gamers/users, look at the hype at the moment: crazy videos, art, cosplay, theories, it all makes sales go higher. If the game would have been released all at once in January, the sales right now would have been not as high as they will be very soon. All those repeating reviews, user-generated content and interesting plot twists will make overall sales much higher.  It's a jackpot from one obvious reason - with every single episode being released the hype train is coming back, the market is more aware of the game, last crazy cliffhanger did a decent job too. For a small company it is a good way of producing games. For me personally - I don't like episodic thing and that's it - if the waiting gap would be 1 month rather than 2 months I would be satisfied. Still love the game and I don't regret buying all 5 episodes in the beginning. Man, I actually even bought it two times, for PS3 and PS4 later on when I bought it. And no, I am not frustrated about waiting or that I already paid for 5 episodes, I am frustrated about not having a full experience and lack of communication, that's it."
lifeisstrange,3dqe7i,elkalb,2,Sat Jul 18 15:22:26 2015 UTC,"I love this game, but people who play this game and have attitudes similar to yours only ruin it for everyone else. There are no dates, no deadlines. We get the episode when it's finished, not when the community ""outrages.""  This game is episodic. It's a great medium for games and game makers. There are no deadlines, it's great content that's only put out when it's finally finished. This has worked phenomenally well with Telltales games, and I'm more than happy to see other companies like DONTNOD picking up this style.  Honestly, I am 200% sick of people posting here with complaints on wait time. Patience is a god damned virtue. You knew this would be an episodic game, if you're upset with wait times you have no one to blame but yourself.   Sure there is no communication, but Telltale gives NO warning until days before the episode is out. At least we've gotten tweets from DONTNOD.  TL;DR- It's you're own damned fault if you're upset with wait times. Grow up, learn how to be patient, wait for the full release, or don't play EPISODIC games."
lifeisstrange,3dqe7i,keichunyan,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:28:33 2015 UTC,There has never been deadlines on LIS episodes only vague estimates. As for episodic releases in the end if you dont want to play it in a episodic manner you can always just wait for the complete edition. Its not new with the Telltale games so its probably going to be the same here too
lifeisstrange,3dqe7i,Not_DEA_trust_me,1 point,Sat Jul 18 13:32:52 2015 UTC,"I don't know anything about game developing but a few weeks late is nothing. There are people who have been waiting or hoping for HL3 to release for years. I know they aren't the same, but it was just to give you an idea. I know it is frustrating, even my hype is almost gone. But the thing is, eventually it will be released and believe me it will worth your time. 2 months may seem long enough but we don't know inside story, maybe they encoutered a major bug that they can't kill it with a shoe:). I don't know about you but Life is Strange worths more than $20 in total, whereas AAA games are at least $40-$50 and almost same length of time."
lifeisstrange,3dqe7i,elkalb,-2,Sat Jul 18 14:10:43 2015 UTC,"As Jessebona said dontNod had no say in this, but I'm too very disappointed about the content/cost ratio of all these teltale-like episodic games.  I just can't understand how such a massive company like Square Enix could release so little content for so much money (and by content I also mean the low production value), we are talking about the people that made the FF series which is the very opposite of LiS, high amount content for low prices.  Even if they just act as publisher square should just send dontnod a sub-division. Enix has a ton of experience in the things dontnod just can't get right like lip-sync in the ur3 engine.  Am I crazy if I say I want at least 30 hours of content for 60 bucks ? I grew up with games like Baldur's Gate 2, where 50 bucks gave you 200+ hours of game play and about 2 times the amount of text the bible has (not even kidding)"

I grew up with games like Baldur's Gate 2, where 50 bucks gave you 200+ hours of game play and about 2 times the amount of text the bible has (not even kidding)   Yes, the value of a video game is not measured by how long it takes you to complete it but the experience of playing it. Longer games usually have a gameplay hook where you repeat doing the same thing to gain experience/loot/etc or makes you backtrack doing fetch quests. If Life is Strange was longer it wouldn't be because there's more story it would be that instead of finding all the ingredients to make a bomb in the school you'd have to go back to Max's room to get some tape then go to Chloe's garden to get the weed poison and finally to get the can you'd have to get some change from the hobo lady behind the dinner, yes it would be longer but also worse and boring.  The season pass for all 5 episodes of Life is Strange is $19.99. Each episode is at least 2hours (if you don't take your time looking through everything and trying to get the optional photos). So that's 10 hours for 20 bucks, that's the same ratio as 30 hours for 60 bucks you say is want people demand."
lifeisstrange,3dqe7i,strangimation,2,Sat Jul 18 13:57:21 2015 UTC,"how such a massive company like Square Enix could release so little content for so much money    You do realize SE has absolutely no place in the production of Life Is Strange? They are merely the publisher, and DONTNOD is a tiny, little indie developer that was on the verge of BANKRUPTCY. They are nowhere big enough to get their own subdivision.   And LiS is like 20 euro, with 4-6 hours of gameplay per episode."

You have many choices, you can buy a season pass for episodes 1-5, buy each one as they come out, buy episode 1 and get a season pass for episodes 2-5 or even wait until they're all out to buy them all at once.  Also the model buy the first episode and get the season pass for episode 2-5 so you can save a bit of money is exactly the same as buying a magazine or newspaper and if you like it you get a subscription for the next X issues and you save a bit of money."
lifeisstrange,3dqe7i,Bodomi,2,Sat Jul 18 15:10:14 2015 UTC,"they are nowhere big enough to get their own subdivision    They have 1 flop game and one game that is unfinished.

lifeisstrange,3dqe7i,haXona,3,Sat Jul 18 13:47:20 2015 UTC,"Additionally, Dontnod seem to be doing just fine with the Life is Strange development so far.  The issues commonly brought up, like lip-synch, are minor issues in the context of the larger game development.  Otherwise, it doesn't seem like Dontnod needs anyone to step in to help.  But seriously.  We're only a few days past the soft, estimated release schedule and people have already started to lose their shit about ""delays""?  And some folks are going as far as to start offering unwarranted (and uninformed) suggestions about how the company/publisher might better restructure?  After only a few days?  For a release schedule that was never set in stone in the first place?  Really??"
lifeisstrange,3dqe7i,Not_DEA_trust_me,4,Sat Jul 18 15:32:01 2015 UTC,"Yeah, people are getting way too overly dramatic, and rather childish. These fan made ''release dates'' were only EVER guesses, and people are getting mad because we are a few days past the made up date? People are crazy. I know we are all anxious waiting, but saying DONTNOD are hurting their sales, are unprepared and don't care about us, even going as far as saying they want a refund or won't play anymore, is what I classify as a borderline psycho. There's more going on than our unfilled need to play a game. We are the star of our own show, but are merely blips in the goings on the universe - getting mad because an episode hasn't been released is rather pathetic."

What I see most interesting is that writers could them easily stopped at BFF level if they wanted to... In EP1 you see them reuniting, in EP2 you see them became BFF again, they could stopped right there and put more screen time to other stuff without any fear that Chloe may left forgotten as some side character, but entire EP3 was about Chloe hinting on Max and at the end Max even basically suggested another kiss to Chloe after what Chloe went daydreaming about kiss next to poster of two lesbian chicks things got hardcore (only if you kissed her).   And that Rachel was banging Frank subplot was like to make it sure that Chloe will not have any dilema with choosing Max over Rachel. Besides Rachel was always replacement for Max. Also Max and Chloe knew each other for much longer, Chloe knew Rachel only about 2 years and how long they were best friends we dont know. Chloe also still keeps that old drawings, pirate towel, photos, and that old oil painting in garden so she never forgot on Max. Chloe was 14 at the time so they werent kids anymore. You can get few commentaries where Chloe directly puts Max above Rachel. Also she replaced Rachel face with Maxs one her phone (if you played pro-Chloe) what is having big symbolic meaning."

Alyssa on the other hand - the only evidence we have that W.

You know, being the nerd kind of guy, he surely isnt all that popular around the cool kidz, so shipping him together with the  (im sorry) ugliest girl around seems like a thing Nathan and his bros would do.

That even doesnt explain your argument that he keeps opinions open... by already agree to go with her instead of Max that did not got even invitation from him at the time ? 0 logic detected. Furthermore it also proves that he is more concerned to get any girlfiend and I dont see Max being on top of his list as big win when you put it in this way.
lifeisstrange,3dnf14,TAGsvk,5,Fri Jul 17 22:00:45 2015 UTC,"He wants Max. Thats why he asks her in the first place. Since the Go-Ape idea originates from Brooke (we can assume since there is evidence for it ingame), Warren ofc. accepts, but then turns the tide and uses this idea for his own advantage. If Max denies, he can still go with Brooke, no biggie. Better than a lonely Friday night. If she accepts however, this changes stuff.   Sure, he kind of is an ass to Brooke in that way (we know Brooke wants Warren, but we can assume Warren doesnt want Brooke because why decline her then?). But then again, Max is just about as much of an ass to Warren with all the ignoring she does (texts from before the game). Its going hand in hand really."

People on other forums have explained it much better than me but Chloe very clearly wants an intimate relationship with Max, not automatically romantic, she seems very to be okay with that idea but that seems to be something she's kinda leaving up to max, while dropping hints like mad that she'd be open to romance.

Just look how Chloe snaps at Max and tries to make her feel bad when she does not do exactly what Chloe wants.

Lovely human being, but it's devastating to watch someone in so much pain all of the time, especially when you can't help them very often.

It's very rare that you'll find a girl with so many positive qualities and very few negative ones. At least in my experience.

lifeisstrange,3dlht8,ColdBlackCage,2,Sat Jul 18 12:10:19 2015 UTC,"Really, though. I'm trans, and I've never been accused of having an unfeminine figure. It's pretty fucked up that you're jumping straight to transsexuals and associating that with unfemininity.  Fact is, plenty of cis girls are not terribly feminine. Plenty of trans girls are. Neither Max nor Chloe have body types that are at all unusual on trans women. And neither of the bodies drawn here are all that unusual in cis women.  But most importantly, their worth isn't derived from the femininity of their bodies.  Seriously, I don't even know why you think it's okay to post shit like this."
lifeisstrange,3dlht8,BostonTentacleParty,0,Sat Jul 18 02:24:25 2015 UTC,"I meant no offense.  Was merely using it as a measure of comparison, as males tend to have masculine features, and female tends to have feminine features. Was just outlining how they appear female, but have a prominent masculine jaw and shoulder span (or appear to) in some of the images.  I couldn't think of a better metaphor to describe this."
lifeisstrange,3dlht8,ColdBlackCage,2,Sat Jul 18 02:54:36 2015 UTC,"So you didn't mean offense, you just didn't know any other way to express this offensive concept than to use offensive stereotypes? Maybe just don't next time."
lifeisstrange,3dlht8,BostonTentacleParty,1 point,Sat Jul 18 04:25:09 2015 UTC,I personally don't see describing a transsexual as masculine as offensive. Neither is describing a transsexual as feminine offensive.  I used it as the point because it's a fairly understandable image - male transsexuals generally look like women with much more masculine features.
lifeisstrange,3dlht8,ColdBlackCage,2,Sat Jul 18 05:35:04 2015 UTC,"I used it as the point because it's a fairly understandable image - male transsexuals generally look like women with much more masculine features.   Confirmation bias, and a fucked up statement regardless. You only notice that women are trans when they have ""masculine features"" you can clock them with. Though honestly I've seen a lot of cis women who have ""masculine features.""  I understand that you didn't intend offense—maybe because you didn't expect any trans people to see your comment. But we're here. I play this game. My girlfriend (also trans) plays this game. I'm certain we're not the only ones. You don't actually get to decide what is and is not offensive to other people; you only get to decide how you respond when you've offended other people.  If you're talking about a trans man, then being called masculine isn't offensive. But when people just say ""transsexual"", they always mean trans woman. And calling a trans woman masculine is offensive.  Butch trans women exist, but the leap from masculine features to trans woman is offensive and plays into offensive stereotypes of trans women as men in dresses and shit. Which maybe doesn't sound like a big deal to you, but when the whole world shouts that message at us constantly it's pretty awful to run into it in fan communities that have nothing to do with it.  Like, fundamentally that whole idea is why some men kill us because they find us attractive, and they find it threatening. It's fundamentally why so many of us kill ourselves at early ages.  I'm not going to argue with you about this any further; if you don't see how it was a fucked up thing to say by now, then you probably never will. The mods don't seem to give a shit, so you won't see any repercussions from them. It's just up to you what you feel like putting into the world.  This action will have consequences."
lifeisstrange,3dlht8,SoniaBowLady,0,Sat Jul 18 13:23:12 2015 UTC,"I was speaking anecdotally from two close trans friends. I'm not sure why you're trying to get mods involved when I'm not intentionally being offensive - I thought it was a fair comparison, that someone has taken offense to. I have apologized but apparently you want more then my conscience.  I also find it quite amusing of your double standard where calling a female masculine isn't offensive - but calling a trans female masculine is offensive. Assigning me to trans-hate stereotypes is such a leap of mental gymnastics that I do not even know where to start - especially considering you seem to have certain spiteful dispositions you accuse me of having.  I was hoping we'd be able to have some rational discourse about the subject, but you seem to be enjoying been offended more then actually wanting to discuss anything - which in that case, so be it."
lifeisstrange,3dlht8,ColdBlackCage,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:44:57 2015 UTC,"Please don't let this person skew your views of the LGBT community.  We, like any other community, have a few people who are rather immature, hot-headed or over defensive.   Just remember that it's a hypersensitive topic for a lot of us, and what you might think as harmless comparison is somewhat insulting to certain identities in our communities. I understand you were just using a description you thought was fair, but it did come across a little condescending; although I take it you didn't really know any better (that's ok! that's why we're discussing this).  I personally don't agree with many of /u/BostonTentacleParty's assertions (comparing you to hate groups is VERY extreme and somewhat diminutive of the issue), but please remember we don't chose to take offense - we just are offended. It's always confronting to have issues like this, raised in communities you assume free from all that shit."

It was late, I thought it conveyed my grievances with the art, but I didn't take into account it would be seen as offensive by some. What we consider as acceptable language where I'm from is evidently not the same elsewhere.  As I said I have two close trans friends, and nothing I've ever said has bothered them (hell I asked them about my assessment here and they didn't say that it was insulting) and I definitely don't have anything against people (although /u/BostonTentacleParty seems to be a expert on diagnosing the exact character and beliefs of someone they've never met across the internet).

lifeisstrange,3dobpn,Nic_Endo,3,Sat Jul 18 01:23:56 2015 UTC,"Exactly! It's been something I was wondering about, because whenever Max got close to something sexual, she did not seem interested at all. Now, I don't expect her to tell all of Blackwell that she really wants some humping, but we literally know her own thoughts, and the closest she came to positively talking about something sexual is when he called a boy cute if I remember correctly. There was absolutely no mention - not even in her diary - of anything romantic or physical interest in Seattle, where she spent five years, though to be fair, she did not mention anyone she misses from there. She's in awe with Jefferson, and it's not a strange phenomenon at all to fall for your idol, especially if he's objectively a quite handsome individual, also, mature, if Max is into that, but no, nothing."

I believe he can be a nice person, he just has some problems, he's fighting with. The pressure through his father and principle and his possible illness/addiction. Also I find it hard to believe he is the ""evil dude"". Would be too obvious.  But what you see of him in the AU he seems to be a chill guy."

lifeisstrange,3dobpn,rrainmaker,4,Fri Jul 17 22:44:48 2015 UTC,"I think is fairly obvious that Pricefield will happen. No game that have x side characters and substories and with that end of the world going on wouldnt spent whole episode about showing us two girls that are teasing each other without reason. As I said, if they just wanted to portrait Chloe as friend of Max that we should care about and dont see her as some generic rebel they could safely left their relationship at level BFF where it was at end of EP2 and make game more set to ehm solving that end of the world stuff... But no, there are going futher with all this Max and Chloe, and it was just way too much of that flirt and teasing and speaking of kisses (that dare and also Chloes daydream after) to dont think that they will just now stop there.  Well there was some pretty hidden talk with Chloe while you got to principals office before you bring her evidence where Chloe suggested to come with Max on Vortex party and before that for sure they will go to junkyard to pay off Frank... Maybe we will see stuff happening already in EP4 (at this rate I woudnt be suprised). I just hope that they wont left us with something cheap like last scene where they will kiss or something like that."

As for the game, both Chloe and Max have an incredible fear of rejection, it just manifests differently. Which is why they're such a great team, they help each other tear down those defense mechanisms. Max is desperately scared to put herself out there for the world to see and take notice of and Chloe gives her the strength to break out of that behavior. Chloe has insane abandonment issues that stop her from expressing her true emotions, bottling in all the sadness and fear, while hiding behind a wall of anger. And Max helps her confront those emotions, even though it has to get worse before it gets better.  They're both on the right track and it's just awesome and inspiring to see how they confront their problems together and learn from each other."

Even if she's really angsty and poser-ish, she wouldn't like Linkin Park, I think. They're massively uncool nowadays and pretty poppy.

But yeah on the web player you can totally make tons of playlists without actually having a membership. it's just when you use the app on your phone when you have to have it on shuffle and it gives you like 6 skips or something.

lifeisstrange,3dlyce,haXona,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:13:48 2015 UTC,"That's sort of ridiculous though. Especially for people posting from mobile platforms where the YouTube share link is easier to get than a full url. And it's not like the youtu.be shortened links are going to lead somewhere nefarious…  I've never had this problem in the past posting here, and it seems I'm not the only one having issues with it now. If this is official policy now due to the additions to the mod staff—as opposed to a setting that needs to be tweaked in the automod settings—mayhaps the mod staff should discuss it a bit further since it would seem they haven't quite considered all the implications of the current policy."
lifeisstrange,3dlyce,Erstwhile_Muse,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:13:48 2015 UTC,Will definitely bring it up :) as I am pretty sure myself that youtu.be links should just lead to the same place.
lifeisstrange,3dlyce,haXona,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:40:08 2015 UTC,"Righto.  A salient point to consider, and why I'm a bit testy about the subject: the short share links allow you to post a link to a specific point within a video as opposed to just the start of the video. This is a very handy feature. I've yet to get the same to work (accurately) by trying to modify the base url, and it requires an extra set of steps to do so, which seems silly when Google has given us a perfectly useful tool right on the page for each video to do so."

Might be Kate wouldnt have been bullied so hard, thus she wouldnt try to kill herself   Doesn't really make sense because Kate is still being bullied at the start of episode 1. Her notebook in class has a drawing of a noose and then there's plently of graffiti around the school showing people don't like Kate.  Like it's possible Kate wouldn't end up on the roof if Chloe had been shot, but the bullying was happening before Chloe got shot and she was suicidal before that as well."
lifeisstrange,3dmng0,SkateboardCop,2,Fri Jul 17 15:05:06 2015 UTC,If Chloe was killed Kate wouldn't have been bullied like that. And even if she was bullied they would have done atleast something to stop it.

lifeisstrange,3dmng0,Will_learn_for_food,3,Fri Jul 17 20:06:00 2015 UTC,Yes she does. But Chloe gets in a crash in the alternate timeline where William was saved by Max. This activated butterfly effect which led to Chloe getting in the crash. It's like she got injured to compensate for William living. But what i mean is that in the main timeline Chloe is saved from being shot by Max but someone still has to die/get seriously injured.
lifeisstrange,3dmng0,Herox01,2,Fri Jul 17 20:19:56 2015 UTC,"I think that someones death is compensated by another one, just like you said, being Chloe's death changed by David's, Frank's or Kate's. But wouldn't that mean that by letting Kate die, then Chloe shouldn't die? Yes,probably, (I just wanted to make a point :P) since, at least in my playthrough, Chloe doesn't have any more chances to die in episode 3. But that's either if you saved or not Kate, so it is up to Episode 4 what happens to Chloe"
lifeisstrange,3dmng0,rrainmaker,3,Fri Jul 17 16:40:11 2015 UTC,"Yeah, thats what i meant"
lifeisstrange,3dmng0,Razraffion,2,Fri Jul 17 19:10:26 2015 UTC,"It's not like universe is trying to balance things out. I think Chloe is handicapped because of butterfly effect. Since his real father did involve in a car accident, she is a careful driver in the initial universe. But in the universe where Max saves William, She didn't learn driving may cause injuries so she became a reckless driver. That's why, she is handicapped.   Your perspective is really deterministic, whereas the game is actually build upon chaos theory and butterfly effect."

lifeisstrange,3dl0n5,Voorhees_13,4,Fri Jul 17 04:02:25 2015 UTC,"It was budget. They could either make passable lip-sync, or make a good story. They chose story."

lifeisstrange,3dl0n5,FilmingMachine,2,Fri Jul 17 13:56:55 2015 UTC,That's not true. They only had enough of a budget to do either French lipsync or English lipsync so they chose French.

lifeisstrange,3dl0n5,rawrower,1 point,Sat Jul 18 11:03:54 2015 UTC,"No worries, I think it's very possible that, being a French studio, the majority of the QA guys were focusing on the subtitles during their testing, and the bad lipsynch fell off the radar for that reason."
lifeisstrange,3dl0n5,AwesomeDewey,4,Sat Jul 18 11:15:33 2015 UTC,They seem to do sort of the best they can with the budget they have and the rigged characters they use
lifeisstrange,3dl0n5,kemando,6,Fri Jul 17 03:28:06 2015 UTC,"Eh, maybe...personally, I suspect it's something more technical. Maybe there was a performance issue that came up, bugs in the code, memory leaks, etc. At this stage in development that's more likely to be the culprit."
lifeisstrange,3dl0n5,SkyWest1218,1 point,Fri Jul 17 04:30:51 2015 UTC,Can't imagine they're having performance issues unless they're doing something crazy. The engine's been in use for 3 episodes already.
lifeisstrange,3dl0n5,Squishumz,3,Fri Jul 17 10:54:19 2015 UTC,Where was it that I saw someone say they might implement it in later episodes? Might be it but not sure if their budget and time would allow it. Theres so much talking.
lifeisstrange,3dl0n5,zeroneraven,6,Fri Jul 17 03:24:47 2015 UTC,https://steamdb.info/app/319630/depots/?branch=lipsync  that's the only real evidence suggesting improved lip sync might happen in the future.
lifeisstrange,3dl0n5,SkateboardCop,1 point,Fri Jul 17 03:27:54 2015 UTC,The branch is active but I think this would be used in a complete season edition where the disc would be updated to the latest version and everyone who had the game would get a final update before the game is essentially final
lifeisstrange,3dl0n5,haXona,3,Fri Jul 17 13:49:43 2015 UTC,I always assumed it wasn't synched so that scenes could say different things depending on your choices without having to completely recreate each image?
lifeisstrange,3dl0n5,KirstyMel,1 point,Fri Jul 17 11:01:19 2015 UTC,"That's what I figured. For some scenarios in the game, that would lead to three or four times the work just for one scene. So I totally understood and am cool with the lack of mouth synchronization. It has the feel of an* indie game with great visuals, and awesome soundtrack, creative mechanics, and an intriguing story, and I want them to focus their time and money on those aspects of the game instead of lip-syncing all the different dialog trees.  *edited for /u/Trodamus"
lifeisstrange,3dl0n5,cmcsalmon,6,Fri Jul 17 12:14:57 2015 UTC,It's not an indie game. They aren't an indie developer. They worked with Square Enix to produce Life is Strange.
lifeisstrange,3dl0n5,Trodamus,2,Fri Jul 17 13:40:09 2015 UTC,"To be fair, it does feels like an indie game."
lifeisstrange,3dl0n5,chattypenguin,3,Fri Jul 17 14:27:25 2015 UTC,"Thanks, /u/chattypenguin. That was my sentiment. It is a game made by a smaller dev team with far from unlimited resources. So while you are correct that it is not technically an indie game in that it is created by a studio, Dontdon Entertainment, and published by Square Enix, /u/Trodamus, it certainly has that feel in many respects."
lifeisstrange,3dl0n5,cmcsalmon,2,Fri Jul 17 14:55:40 2015 UTC,"Let's hope so, but I still put a capable, running, bug-free episode over improved lip syncing. I say that's something that they can definitely focus and improve in future projects or seasons of LiS. I'm not sure how difficult it is to fix lip syncing in an episode, but if it could actually be done without decreasing other episode components' quality, then that'd definitely be icing on the cake."
lifeisstrange,3dl0n5,Gopasson,2,Fri Jul 17 03:46:37 2015 UTC,"Heh.. between making the episode longer and mouth syncing, I'd rather hope for a longer episode with more content compared to the others.  I barely notice the mouth sync problems, you just have to learn to live with that stuff, it's not a major issue."
lifeisstrange,3dl0n5,Bodomi,2,Fri Jul 17 10:35:59 2015 UTC,Spoiler alert I'm pretty sure it isn't lip-syncing. Its really hard to change design things like these so far into development where the budget and development parts has already been set a long time ago.  Its more likely they either wasnt happy enough with something that prolonged the release or you know they just hit the good old buggy Road :P

lifeisstrange,3dl0n5,CaseOfInsanity,1 point,Fri Jul 17 07:27:44 2015 UTC,"Define ""out on time so far"". Because to my knowlegde DONTNOD doesn't have a public schedule for releasing episodes, I even think that they don't know when episodes should release. I like their philosophy 'it's done when it's done', it enables them to put quality time into their creation, which shows in every episode."
lifeisstrange,3dl0n5,Paddo_In_Wonderland,1 point,Fri Jul 17 07:42:02 2015 UTC,Episode 1 came out in January as announced. The next 2 episodes roughly came out in a 8-week interval
lifeisstrange,3dl0n5,CaseOfInsanity,2,Fri Jul 17 08:04:08 2015 UTC,"so, less dancing around the question then, was the 8 week period planned and subsequently announced by dontnod?"
lifeisstrange,3dl0n5,RiskyR,2,Fri Jul 17 08:24:13 2015 UTC,"Apparently that was their target timeframe between each episode, which they did say in Twitter, etc."
lifeisstrange,3dl0n5,CaseOfInsanity,1 point,Fri Jul 17 08:34:09 2015 UTC,A target is not set in stone I see your point but lots of people seems to have missed the fact that they said they wanted to be able to do 6-8 week interval releases but that it would depend on development :)
lifeisstrange,3dl0n5,haXona,1 point,Sat Jul 18 09:11:06 2015 UTC,If I had to guess episode 4 is done at this point and dontnod would love to release it but square enix doesn't want it to come out the same day as telltales GoT episode 5 so they decided to delay it for a week. That's what I got from that square enix tweet a while back saying not to expect it this upcoming week.
lifeisstrange,3dl0n5,JoetotheD,2,Fri Jul 17 11:48:33 2015 UTC,And if you want to be techinal episode 4 isn't late unless it comes out after July. Michel stated in an e3 interview they were going to try and have the next episodes out in a two month period. (Not 8 weeks)

lifeisstrange,3dl0n5,Campusanis,1 point,Fri Jul 17 13:40:07 2015 UTC,That would be nice to have some better lip syncing but it didn't really bother me once I fell in love with the story so I would rather them be spending this time on adding more choices or fleshing out the story. Maybe after the season is over they could release a DLC between seasons that is a 'remaster' of season one episodes.

lifeisstrange,3dmar7,kemando,4,Fri Jul 17 19:28:30 2015 UTC,Why did you ignore her phone call?
lifeisstrange,3dmar7,alexmikli,2,Fri Jul 17 17:42:12 2015 UTC,"I thought that in Max's mind, Chloe was the priority, and that Max felt an obligation to focus on Chloe. They were just rekindling their friendship after Max had avoided contacting Chloe for the time she had been back, and it seemed like if anyone was likely to do something rash, it would have been Chloe, who had a history of living in the danger zone. I also took for granted that something so serious could result from that decision. From what I remember, the only consequences of major decisions you see up to that point are text messages from either one party or another, or a slight change in dialog, so I started to get a little complacent, and I paid dearly for it. And that is one of the reasons I fell even more in love with this game. It came right when I was starting to feel like ""this is another game that promises you that your decisions have consequences, but none of them really have BIG PICTURE consequences."" And then boom. And I never taken anything in the game lightly since, even in subsequent playthroughs."

lifeisstrange,3dhvpt,EsseFen,11,Fri Jul 17 01:20:00 2015 UTC,I'm really happy for them and I think they should celebrate by releasing Episode 4.

lifeisstrange,3dhvpt,Akilice,3,Thu Jul 16 12:53:50 2015 UTC,Hella YEAH!

lifeisstrange,3dhvpt,wizhards,5,Thu Jul 16 20:21:49 2015 UTC,"Call me a cynic, but isn't it weird to give out awards for a game that's not actually finished yet? I get that Episodes 1-3 are good (Really good, in my opinion), but isn't it possible that the last 40% of the game could absolutely tank?  I'm happy for Dontnod, but I still think it's premature to give them any awards for ""Life is Strange"" until Episode 5 is out."
lifeisstrange,3dhvpt,ward0630,3,Thu Jul 16 16:49:54 2015 UTC,"You're not cynic at all, it's a pretty damn good reason not to give them any award."
lifeisstrange,3dhvpt,haXona,2,Thu Jul 16 17:03:51 2015 UTC,Ep1-3 are longer than many indie full games and has more substantial content than a lot of indie games that has gotten awards. I see it as a non-issue but thats just me :P  For example best new IP is not really dependent on a full season more than one episode.
lifeisstrange,3dhvpt,MBMM1,2,Thu Jul 16 22:46:01 2015 UTC,Now let's see what they do next with a bigger budget and a looser development cycle. I'm stoked.
lifeisstrange,3dhvpt,SunbatherValley,2,Thu Jul 16 22:51:40 2015 UTC,Wonderful. Well deserved in my book. LiS is a masterpiece.
lifeisstrange,3dhvpt,Xexanos,2,Fri Jul 17 10:06:06 2015 UTC,I couldn't have decided between LiS and Sunless Sea for the Narrative category tbh.  But congrats Dontnod :)
lifeisstrange,3dhvpt,Neamow,4,Fri Jul 17 10:18:02 2015 UTC,"I'd hate to be the one deciding on the first one. I love Life is Strange, but Cities: Skylines is on another level from all the other nominees in that category in my opinion. LIS absolutely deserves the Narrative award, but I would seriously be on the fence for the first one.  And seriously, I Am Bread?"
lifeisstrange,3dhvpt,Grillarn,11,Thu Jul 16 12:53:08 2015 UTC,"The first category is indeed a scary pick to make. With Cities Skyline and The Escapists, it's pretty hard to make a choice. I'm going for Life is Strange personally, but only because I feel it's the first game to be truly successful at conveying more than entertainment, creativity and challenge for the player.  Cities Skyline is a great first IP, the challenge was insane - dethrone Sim City - and they did it on their first shot! But Life Is Strange managed to be something completely new while dethroning (well, maybe not entirely) Telltale games on their own turf.  Also think about the new pitches, which one sounds more awesome: ""it's like cities skyline, IN SPACE!"", or ""it's like life is strange, IN SPACE!""  Hard to decide, eh :)"

lifeisstrange,3dhvpt,Neamow,3,Thu Jul 16 14:01:25 2015 UTC,"Hey, there was rumor about LIS second season being ""more scifi"" or something. I imagined 30 years old Max waking up from cryosleep in the world of Remember Me or something. That would be pretty cool."
lifeisstrange,3dhvpt,Videoboysayscube,2,Thu Jul 16 14:56:18 2015 UTC,They're also saying they'd be using different characters for season 2
lifeisstrange,3dhvpt,Romanruler,2,Thu Jul 16 20:42:19 2015 UTC,Cities: Skylines in space sounds like the ultimate free time killer for me.
lifeisstrange,3djdd6,Gopasson,39,Thu Jul 16 19:12:32 2015 UTC,If they are doing multiple endings for ep 4 it would be a plausible reason for Dontnod to delay the episode over 8 weeks...  HYPE
lifeisstrange,3djdd6,wHatTheFez,17,Thu Jul 16 19:22:28 2015 UTC,"True, true but we don't know that.   During The Wolf Among Us production they had to rewrite the whole Ep.2 because the guy responsible for the books the game was based on didn't agree with their vision.  So we had a 4 months wait..."
lifeisstrange,3djdd6,GymKerry,7,Thu Jul 16 19:27:56 2015 UTC,Really??? That explains so much... :o
lifeisstrange,3djdd6,GSoda,2,Thu Jul 16 19:46:34 2015 UTC,"OH really? I never knew that, I don't remember much about waiting for that game, I guess I blocked it out."
lifeisstrange,3djdd6,wHatTheFez,2,Thu Jul 16 19:59:13 2015 UTC,Ye when I was looking at TWAU episode release dates I was wondering why the hell the gap between episode 1 and 2 was 4 months where everywhere else 2 months...
lifeisstrange,3djdd6,Ara-Player,17,Fri Jul 17 09:47:11 2015 UTC,"Personally, I'd rather have two or three possible endings in episode 5."
lifeisstrange,3djdd6,LegendPT,15,Thu Jul 16 19:46:03 2015 UTC,One. I prefer quality over quantity.  By forcing us to a single ending they can spend much more time developing it and like you said it makes Ep.5 easier to do. Also devs don't have a large budget so it would definitely harm other aspects of the game too.  As for the whole season it's way better that they have multiple endings planned. :)
lifeisstrange,3djdd6,GymKerry,2,Thu Jul 16 19:25:53 2015 UTC,"Obviously they won't have 5 endings like the TWD season 2, but a at least 3 in my book."
lifeisstrange,3djdd6,Ara-Player,7,Fri Jul 17 09:47:56 2015 UTC,"Mainly just a few more changes here and there, just so they can keep the illusion of choice up a bit more. In my opinion, seeing all the choices I've made so far lead to pretty much the same result, bar a few minor dialogue and cutscene changes, is a bit disappointing to an extent. I'm not really saying to be like Mass Effect to any extent, just not the ending of Mass Effect 3"
lifeisstrange,3djdd6,JayandSilentB0b,11,Thu Jul 16 21:19:57 2015 UTC,"If they went for a Mass Effect 3 style ending then you would get to see a short cut scene where Chloe's hair would be red, blue or green depending on what choices you made.  On the plus side a LiS equivalent of the Citadel DLC would be completely worth it."
lifeisstrange,3djdd6,GenerouslyLachrymose,3,Thu Jul 16 21:32:42 2015 UTC,"Considering that TWD both seasons had this Mass Effect 3 style ending that you described where it only matters what choices you create at the end, I kinda like that more than choices from EP3 changing shit, since they would need more planning and it would be more complicated."
lifeisstrange,3djdd6,Ara-Player,6,Fri Jul 17 09:49:58 2015 UTC,Multiple!  That's why I liked EP2's ending.  There's a real kick in the teeth seeing Kate's memorial and some satisfaction seeing Nathan get expelled.
lifeisstrange,3djdd6,TheNathanNS,4,Thu Jul 16 20:47:41 2015 UTC,Different endings wouldn't carry over in a satisfactory way to EP5 I think.
lifeisstrange,3djdd6,preparingupdate,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:56:40 2015 UTC,Agreed.
lifeisstrange,3djdd6,Ara-Player,6,Fri Jul 17 09:50:24 2015 UTC,"I say stick with same endings. I am fine with more minor differences like Kate being dead or not being dead. But multiple endings would be more special if preserved till the actual end.  That being said, I wouldn't mind it either way I just want to know that ALL choices, pay off in the end. Meaning: saying yes or no to the date with Warren, giving Chloe the gun back, killing the dog etc. All affect the plot somehow in the end.   Plus if there are multiple ending for 4 that means there are multiple starts for 5 which will delay it too lol."
lifeisstrange,3djdd6,Keven-Rus,2,Fri Jul 17 00:20:47 2015 UTC,"Any ending at all..?  Joking, joking, I think as much as I'd love extra endings, I think I trust Dontnod enough to make the right judgement on this decision based on their budget and time. They're smart people, I don't think they'd make something well out of their range, you know?  So yeah, I think honestly it'll just be the one."
lifeisstrange,3djdd6,JT7Music,2,Thu Jul 16 20:17:24 2015 UTC,To be fair that what was said about Bioware as well.
lifeisstrange,3djdd6,rikutoar,2,Fri Jul 17 07:04:25 2015 UTC,"Well I want multiple endings for the last episode in the season, so ep4 doesn't need to have those."
lifeisstrange,3djdd6,Galvano,2,Fri Jul 17 02:42:10 2015 UTC,"In a topic about ""what  would you like to see in season 2?"" I brought up that I think it'd be cool if you could decide your relationships with other characters and it would result in spending more time with whichever character you favored the most, culminating in an episode 4 or 5 that is moderately different for each character choice... Some examples would be like Witcher 2's branched plots, or Tales of Symphonia's different relationship options. ( some of which are very platonic and friendly as opposed to romances.) I think it would be really cool for LiS since so many people love pairing and shipping the different everyone with Max, in this case Max or whoever actually could be with a bunch of different people......  Howeveeeeerrrrr... I don't think it would work for this season of Life Is Strange since so far it has been very singularly focused on Chloe and Max's relationship with her, but I do agree that it would be nice to see all of Max's choices come to a head and have a major impact and differences to Episode 4's ending."
lifeisstrange,3djdd6,JC_Phoenix7,2,Fri Jul 17 03:46:39 2015 UTC,"I don't care what they do with episode 4, as long as they make multiple endings for episode 5 I won't yell."
lifeisstrange,3djdd6,Ara-Player,2,Fri Jul 17 09:45:41 2015 UTC,"Well depends,what if each of the endings happened revolving around the same situation,but had something of it altered based on what happened throughout the episode. And carries over to the beginning of Episode 5,where everything goes down."
lifeisstrange,3djdd6,nicefunfungal,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:41:52 2015 UTC,It would be pretty amazing if they actually split the game and let you choose to stay in the new  timeline or go back.  I can't imagine dontnod has the resources to make two completely different episode 5s though.

lifeisstrange,3dk2ls,JackofScarlets,2,Fri Jul 17 03:43:07 2015 UTC,"The principal is suggested to be under pretty consistent pressure from a lot of the parents of the students (of which Nathans can be assumed to be some of the worst), and David holds no real authority outside of 'catching' people to report to the administration.   And Warren's probably the kind of twat who would have lied about it being a totally equal fight and he got some good shots in. You know, try and make it look like he's not a total puss."

lifeisstrange,3dk2ls,Ara-Player,2,Fri Jul 17 09:52:52 2015 UTC,Depends I suppose.  When we had fights in secondary school they were mostly organised before hand and refereed by a trusted teacher. (they'd monitor and intervene if it looked like real damage could be done)  Random punch ups were dealt with internally but even when caught were no reason to suspend anyone. Suspensions were serious business. The most you'd get would be a week or two being detained in the study hall or some public humiliation. (having to stand in front of the reception office for 4 weeks holding hands ~ fucking cringe)

lifeisstrange,3dhh9y,Smokinacesfan55,3,Thu Jul 16 18:44:23 2015 UTC,"What I find interesting are the pluses and minuses in the end. If you don't hide and take the blame you are going to still satisfy Chloe less than if you hide and then choose to intervene, therefore Chloe shows Max her gun if she does that. Also not hiding and blaming Chloe has a much more negative impact on her than just hiding and staying. That's why Chloe isn't mad at Max if she stays hidden but is if she doesn't hide at all."

lifeisstrange,3dgw2b,Lukiele,20,Thu Jul 16 04:22:32 2015 UTC,"Part of the reason Chloe is still looking for her is because we learn she obviously has serious abandonment issues. We constantly hear her complain about her dad, man and now Rachael leaving her. Which is why she probably hasn't given up.  Given her dad didn't really choose to, but she seems to blame him for his own death. I'm really hoping one of the decisions we can make coming up is to either go back or keep the ending to ep 3. Althought the only thing that would make me keep the ending to ep 3 would be if i still get to help kate."
lifeisstrange,3dgw2b,Manicalmadcap,5,Thu Jul 16 05:47:26 2015 UTC,"There's a chance that in the new timeline, you also bully Kate, though.   Unless, Nathan wearing blue instead of red is symbolism for him being less damaged and ""evil"" in this timeline. Is there a scenario that would make Max willingly sign up for a club that bullies people to their deaths?   Maybe. But I think that the Vortex may be different this time around for some reason."
lifeisstrange,3dgw2b,rubyrose13,5,Thu Jul 16 06:46:52 2015 UTC,"I don't think max would have bullied Kate but things could be way different now.The group seems to think max is high. Which id take to believe that they've seen her high before in this time line. Which (feel free to correct if im wrong its been awhile since I've played) you don't get the option to smoke with Chloe (max is against it?) SO maybe. But yea like you said its possibly she bullied Kate if she did i'll do everything to get out. I don't care about Chloe but Kate must be saved! I failed act 2 on my first play through, broke down for an hour or so and started over.   Nathan probably isn't ""good"" but the max of this time line( you're replacing her) probably didn't see him as bad since she didn't see him with the gun and all the goodness. On that same note Victoria and most the others seem to be more friendly towards Max now as well so maybe they're just nicer in genera like you said so its possible the whole Kate incident may not have even happened. If that's possible Rachael may be around or no one may care. Since Chloe probably didn't meet her? and she was the only one who really seemed to care."
lifeisstrange,3dgw2b,Manicalmadcap,13,Thu Jul 16 07:40:53 2015 UTC,He's too busy eating those beans. Are you fucking insane?!
lifeisstrange,3dgw2b,fraggleroni,4,Thu Jul 16 14:14:00 2015 UTC,I WAS EATING THOSE BEANS!!!!!!!   Hes more fond of the beans than he is of Rachel obviously
lifeisstrange,3dgw2b,ramahlive,10,Fri Jul 17 00:23:48 2015 UTC,"He probably did try looking for her for a bit, but I guess he just gave up and decided to think she just met someone else and ran away with that someone, that'd probably be the most logical conclusion for him to think.  Chloe on the other hand is obsessed with Rachel, she clearly fell in love with her, now remember Chloe isn't exactly an adult yet, she's 18 but she's still pretty much a kid, so dealing with love feelings is probably much harder for her to deal with, so regardless of what happened to Rachel, Chloe would want to know and do whatever it takes.  So like I said, Frank looks almost like 30, he probably thinks Rachel just doesn't want to see him anymore and found someone else, so he just gave up, I mean would you start going around town looking for your 18 year old lover school girl who you think left you for someone else in Frank's place?  That's kinda what I think, seems the most logical."
lifeisstrange,3dgw2b,fima1fim,9,Thu Jul 16 04:47:06 2015 UTC,"Frank being a lot older is a really good point, like at a certain point (and Rachel went ""missing"" six months) you stop looking, like he could check all over town, and talk to her friends, maybe her parents, maybe some of the truckers.   Eventually he just hits a bunch of dead ends and decide that she was either murdered and the body is in the middle of woods where nobody will find it, or she ran off to L.A and ditched him and Chloe and he moves on.  What's more interesting is actually Chloe, at six months ""missing"" putting up flyers is basically pointless. Everybody in town already knew her, and anybody who didn't has seen those flyers. Presumably Chloe checked out everywhere (old hideouts, hangouts, anywhere she might possibly be) and everyone (parents, other students, Frank, the cops for case info)  She's basically putting up flyers so she can convince herself that Rachel just got lost in the woods or is locked up in a basement somewhere because the alternatives are she ran away without Chloe or she's dead. Chances are Chloe knows she can't handle either of those options and so being overly fixated on her Rachel's disappearance is a coping mechanism."
lifeisstrange,3dgw2b,SkateboardCop,2,Thu Jul 16 05:37:05 2015 UTC,"How about Chloe killed Rachel and shes trying... not to hide it but ""looking for her"" is her way to cope with it and what shes done?  since ep.4 is taking its sweet ass time, if we're going far fetched, lets go all the way."
lifeisstrange,3dgw2b,Kalmah666,2,Thu Jul 16 13:50:06 2015 UTC,"Given how upset she became with the revelation that Rachel was seeing Frank, I think that theory is pretty far fetched. Chloe is hot headed and passionate and certainly damaged, but her feelings towards Rachel until that moment are purely positive"
lifeisstrange,3dgw2b,BostonTentacleParty,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:31:30 2015 UTC,"Aye, sounds about right"
lifeisstrange,3dgw2b,fima1fim,3,Thu Jul 16 05:39:33 2015 UTC,"I think something is messing with people about Rachel. EVERYONE seems really dismissive about her disappearance, including her parents. Until Max, only Chloe seemed to be doing anything about it. My theory is that whatever is causing Max's visions may be causing people's weird reactions to Rachel's disappearance."
lifeisstrange,3dgw2b,Mosykins,4,Thu Jul 16 05:32:36 2015 UTC,"Sounds...far fetched?  I don't know, it's more of people just don't care after so long, no one knows what really happened to her and people just carry on with their lives, Chloe is the only one still looking because she refuses to believe Rachel left her or died, so she keeps looking.  Tho I believe now with Max in play, she will either forget about her or finds her thanks to Max  Or something like that, I don't know."
lifeisstrange,3dgw2b,fima1fim,4,Thu Jul 16 05:42:17 2015 UTC,"I realize it does sound far-fetched and I would completely agree if it wasn't for Rachel's parents and the police ""investigation"" mentioned in Rachel's school file. Everyone else around town and school - yes, after six months of no news, it's natural that they would move on.   But her PARENTS?! The fact that they aren't the ones putting up the posters all over town or reaching out to everyone to find out where Rachel is seems weird to me. If my kid went missing, my life would revolve around finding her. I'd talk to EVERYONE in school, pester the people she spent time with, go through her things and probably even hire a PI. But the only mention of Rachel's parents are ""they're in denial"" (or something similar)... Granted, Chloe might be leaving things out, but Chloe's the only one printing flyers and putting them up all over town. That's legitimately WEIRD.   Then there's the cops... In three days, Max has managed to find out about Rachel and Frank, about letters to Chloe, about plans to move to LA, rumors of Rachel and Jefferson, etc... None of these things were hard to find and none of them required specialized forensic equipment to dig up. Just rifling through trash and talking to people. But the cops ""officially"" close the case with no leads?! There are so many leads all over the place and the cops found NONE of them?! Seriously?   If it was one or the other, I might dismiss it as neglectful parenting or incompetent police work. But this game has shown that even the smallest details are something to be noticed (ie. watering/not watering a plant, telling Alyssa to duck, etc). The parents of the missing girl you're looking for and the cops who investigated her disappearance aren't small details. The fact that they've BOTH dropped the ball on this case in a town where supernatural weirdness happens makes me think that there's something supernatural going on to make that ball be dropped."
lifeisstrange,3dgw2b,Mosykins,3,Thu Jul 16 06:05:07 2015 UTC,"Rachel appears to be the kind of person who would just run away if she had the opportunity.  Even Chloe says so...she just says that Rachel wouldn't run away without HER.  It's possible...even likely...that after the police came up empty handed, the parents are going with the belief that she ran away.  Honestly, that might be the PREFERRED belief for the parents, rather than her being taken away by somebody or dead."
lifeisstrange,3dgw2b,PRGuyHere,3,Thu Jul 16 14:02:54 2015 UTC,"I think you might be on to something here.   Maybe this can be linked to another ""mystery"" in Life is Strange: The fact that nobody notices Max' time traveling. The most glaring example of this is that nobody notices us ""teleporting"" (walking around, then rewinding should look like teleporting to an outsider). We're doing this all the time, in public, and nobody seems to mind it. ""Hey Max, spazzing out over the schoolyard again?""  It seems to be a feature of timetravel magic that people just don't seem to notice. It has been a popular theory that Rachel is a timetraveler herself and might have gotten ""lost in time"" through one way or another. The reason why people don't notice Max' teleporting might be the same as for why people don't really care about Rachel's disappeareance."
lifeisstrange,3dgw2b,decapodw,3,Thu Jul 16 11:05:27 2015 UTC,"I think Frank has given up. On everything, I mean. He doesn't look like a happy man. He might have tried looking, but no one would help him, so he'd go back to sullen hatred of life and acceptance that she'd just left him. After all, what's the point?"
lifeisstrange,3dgw2b,JackofScarlets,3,Thu Jul 16 09:15:39 2015 UTC,"I think Frank is just simply selfish and only wrote notes to Rachel because she'd have sex with him (now whether it was out of love for drugs is another story) and all he really cares about atm is getting the money from Chloe and his dog (and maybe those beans which to be fair, didn't look too bad)."
lifeisstrange,3dgw2b,Fancy-Bear1776,2,Thu Jul 16 17:06:07 2015 UTC,"Then why hide those notes in the vents, when he has drugs out in the open?"
lifeisstrange,3dgw2b,BostonTentacleParty,2,Thu Jul 16 19:38:17 2015 UTC,Figured he got scared after Chloe went off on him for wearing her bracelet and wanted to be careful. But considering he hid the notes he more than likely had something to do with her disappearance.
lifeisstrange,3dgw2b,Fancy-Bear1776,3,Thu Jul 16 19:40:56 2015 UTC,Well...he has his dog I guess.
lifeisstrange,3dgw2b,yarfmeister,2,Thu Jul 16 17:41:22 2015 UTC,and them sweet beans.
lifeisstrange,3dgw2b,monsterperson,2,Fri Jul 17 02:24:56 2015 UTC,I think Frank couldn't care less about Rachel and only had sex with Rachel as a trade for giving her drugs or something.
lifeisstrange,3dgw2b,Ara-Player,2,Thu Jul 16 09:38:29 2015 UTC,"I really think Frank knows something about what she was up to and has been sworn to secrecy. This might explain that odd blood oath thing. He's kind of indifferent about her disappearance, as far as I can tell so far. Even though they are supposed to be in love. He has drugs pretty much out in the open, yet he keeps Rachel's letters/pics very well hidden. Everyone (including Chloe, her ""best friend"") thinks she was playing him but we find out that's not the case.  Frank did "" scare her"" at one point, but maybe he was pissed about whatever she was doing being dangerous. Don't forget Rachel also had started a fight with him at one point that she apologized for. Couples/lovers/whatever do argue every once in a while. Maybe he knows she got in too deep with something and just simply took off?"
lifeisstrange,3dgw2b,Infamy7,2,Thu Jul 16 11:39:44 2015 UTC,"Has he even really acknowledged her as ""missing""? It seems as though Rachel just picked up and left and he knows that nothing particularly sinister happened, just that she bounced and didn't tell anybody."
lifeisstrange,3dgw2b,BobMugabe35,2,Thu Jul 16 15:18:37 2015 UTC,i think he just knows something that we dont
lifeisstrange,3dgw2b,Jeffro75,2,Thu Jul 16 19:15:42 2015 UTC,"I just found him fishy, so I just assumed he has something to do with it, and is not just an innocent bystander."

lifeisstrange,3dg32r,haXona,3,Thu Jul 16 15:22:05 2015 UTC,Maybe this could be a minor piece of the story? Like if Max goes snooping in somebody's room she can look at the tablet and see cat pictures. If she read the poster previously she can go and return the tablet to its original owner.

On top of that, Chloe is looking at him as someone who is failing at 'replacing' her actual father, and that bitterness is causing a rift in them.   Something like this would go a long way into helping them patch up their relationship. It might not ever be perfect, but some decent activity that they can both get into might make them understand each other a bit more.

On that note, I'm actually way more concerned about the axe in Samuel's utility shack in... Ep2 I think?  Something about it is incredibly conspicuous, and Max even comments on this fact.  The gun is a huge plot point that's come up multiple times, but the axe is just subtle enough to catch you off guard.  Anyone could walk in and take that thing..."

I always thought that we'd confront and end up shooting the person behind the binders in Episode 4 (whom I personally believe is Jefferson) but this seems like a pretty likely situation. The gun will definitely come into play as it's been a main choice for the past two episodes. Lots of permutations here, too.   And welp, if true, in my save file that would mean...goodbye, David..."
lifeisstrange,3dfi6f,BostonTentacleParty,2,Wed Jul 15 23:55:40 2015 UTC,"Nah. It can't be. We see the binders in those ending shots of each episode.

lifeisstrange,3dfi6f,rrainmaker,2,Thu Jul 16 15:04:39 2015 UTC,The binders might be located at Jefferson's office on the upper floor of the classrooms.

lifeisstrange,3dfi6f,BostonTentacleParty,3,Thu Jul 16 03:51:51 2015 UTC,"I think this is interesting but there are a few things I'm having a hard time wrapping my mind around. 1. What are the consequences for Chloe shooting David? It'd be disruptive to the plot if she went to jail or something for it (because she is 18 and an adult). 2. The gun in the snapshot of the episode preview of the hand holding the gun kind of looks like Nathan's hand and his particular gun, which makes me think that either there's another player in this gun scenario or that this scenario might not work out after all. I'm not saying this is wrong but it's just some stuff to think about. It is a cool theory though."
lifeisstrange,3dfi6f,AceOfCakez,2,Thu Jul 16 06:18:45 2015 UTC,"you are alright. If Chloe shoots someone she will end up in jail. But if Frank has the gun, it might be dangerous, since he takes drugs and might get his rage on."

lifeisstrange,3deh3x,TAGsvk,8,Wed Jul 15 17:13:55 2015 UTC,"This is a good theory - there have been some theories around that suggest Rachel's spirit animal is the blue butterfly, could she have transferred the rewind powers over when Max took the photograph in the bathroom in episode 1?"
lifeisstrange,3deh3x,DoodleBecs,3,Wed Jul 15 18:33:43 2015 UTC,holy
lifeisstrange,3deh3x,AnotherRandomFinn,4,Wed Jul 15 18:45:41 2015 UTC,Sheeyt
lifeisstrange,3deh3x,AdriaaaaaaaaaN,3,Thu Jul 16 10:27:51 2015 UTC,Interesting ... Proably one of the best theories about the source of Max's power
lifeisstrange,3deh3x,NotMeeh,3,Wed Jul 15 18:09:11 2015 UTC,"Something is most definitely ""up"" with Rachel and I haven't been able to come up with anything solid. It's really mind boggling. I think both the Rachel=Time Traveler and Max=Rachel theories have some valid points, but neither completely ""nail it"" for me.   I really think Frank knows something about what she was up to and has been sworn to secrecy. This might explain that odd blood oath thing. He's kind of indifferent about her disappearance, as far as I can tell so far. Even though they are supposed to be in love. He has drugs pretty much out in the open, yet he keeps Rachel's letters/pics very well hidden. Everyone (including Chloe, her ""best friend"") thinks she was playing him but we find out that's not the case."
lifeisstrange,3deh3x,Infamy7,2,Thu Jul 16 02:35:14 2015 UTC,"Assuming that Rachel did/does have powers: what I'm wondering is how Max or Rachel got these powers in the first place?   Ms Grant talked about Native Americans being at the core of Arcadia Bay, and tbh Rachel's feather earrings do remind me of it symbolically speaking. The totem, the spirit animals (there are NA legends about every one of them), the climate/weather anomalies (google ""native american weather"" and you'll also find legends as well as reports of modern-day tribes working alongside climate scientists)... What if Rachel has some ancestry or something? How she hypothetically got her powers and transferred them to Max is a mystery though.  Also amber is considered as the stone of the Sun (eclipse symbolism maybe?), with healing and protecting properties (helping people + preventing harm and danger throughout the game) and we all know those fossils stuck in amber (literally frozen in time inside the resin).   From my researches it seems that amber is a sacred stone for Native Americans; it was also burnt as incense during ancient tribal healers' ceremonies. Rachel has to be linked to the Native American lore one way or another. But I can't figure out how Max fits into this. Clearly, Max seems to be linked to Rachel but... how? Chloe is the obvious answer but there must be something else."
lifeisstrange,3deh3x,ArcadiaFrog,2,Thu Jul 16 00:03:51 2015 UTC,"No offense OP, but ""Rachel is a time traveler"" is an even more arbitrary theory than ""Max is Rachel"", imo.  So a time traveler faking to be two people is ridiculous.  But because someone is popular and has good grades, that means she's a time traveler?  Ugh. I'm just not getting the logic here. Can someone explain better please?"
lifeisstrange,3deh3x,Satile,7,Wed Jul 15 20:15:33 2015 UTC,"I get where the ""Rachel is a time traveler""-theorists are coming from: she is portrayed as the perfect person, popular with everyone, has good grades, is pretty, etc.   A) Everyone loves her (there is no character I know of, that said anything negative about her). We also get people to like us by using the rewind power as Max: we go through a dialogue with someone who doesn't really want to talk to us, they drop a hint, we rewind and -tadaa- we can use this hint to get info/get them to like us a little bit more. We only had a few days to do this, imagine what you could do within a year.  B) Good grades: no need to explain how to use timetravel to get A's.  C) Her sudden disappearence: If we use different timelines to explain the events close to the end of ep.3, it would mean that Max vanished from the blue hair-chloe timeline and jumped into the wheelchair chloe timeline. Same could have happened to Rachel too. She jumps into a different timeline, vanishes from the current one and is stuck (or incredibly happy) in the new timeline.  These are just things from the top of my head, I hope it was somewhat understandable. Thing is: there is no evidence for any of this and if Rachel and Chloe were really as close as they seemed to be, I think that Rachel would have told her (just as we did)."
lifeisstrange,3deh3x,Diptam,6,Wed Jul 15 22:19:35 2015 UTC,"Isn't there a fair bit of graffiti around Arcadia Bay that indicates Rachel might not be as great as other characters (and her school records) indicate? I might be misremembering, so do correct me if I'm wrong, but I think there's stuff about her owing money, stuff referring to sex, and calling her a bitch? I know Kate ended up in the firing line of some pretty unpleasant graffiti, but there's definitely someone at Blackwell who really didn't like Rachel."
lifeisstrange,3deh3x,poho,3,Wed Jul 15 22:31:38 2015 UTC,"You are correct, good reminder. Only thing I could hold against it: people can get very jealous. I could see Victoria as the one behind the graffity. Rachel was basically her greatest/only rival and we've seen how Victoria treats her ""friends"" behind their backs."
lifeisstrange,3deh3x,Diptam,4,Wed Jul 15 22:59:39 2015 UTC,"That's a good point, I'd forgotten about regular high school politics!"
lifeisstrange,3deh3x,poho,4,Thu Jul 16 08:09:29 2015 UTC,"Best counter-argument on this is ""Why did not Rachel tell Chloe about this ?"" Well I think Rachel was maybe more ""selfish"" and played with her powers more perfect game. She simply doesnt wanted to take any risk or simply found that weird. Even Max doesnt tell that to everybody. Only to Chloe and I cant quite picture from her to said it ever to anybody else with all seriousness."
lifeisstrange,3deh3x,Diptam,3,Wed Jul 15 22:41:43 2015 UTC,"yeah, that argument is weak. I'd shut the hell up about my powers if I were in that position, too. Not only because of selfish reasons, but because it's so insane, no one would believe me/think I'm insane."
lifeisstrange,3deh3x,narcolepticnine,2,Wed Jul 15 22:56:30 2015 UTC,Edit: Spoilers
lifeisstrange,3deh3x,Satile,3,Thu Jul 16 18:37:46 2015 UTC,"Victoria hates her guts. You'd think if Rachel was hell-bent on making everyone like her, then she'd at least be able to stop Victoria writing ""Rachel is a slut"" all over the walls.  You haven't brought up anything new. You've just said, ""She's smart and popular = time travel."" There is no evidence presented.  The problem I have is that people are just making ""popular"" and ""smart"" indicators of time travel. When it's not. Valedictorians usually have lots of friends, mostly because they, as people, have their shit together and are well-balanced.  Also, how does being pretty make you a time traveler? Pretty and smart = charismatic; charismatic = friends. Maybe I just played too much D&D in my younger years, but charismatic =/= time traveler.  This is a lot of people speculating based on almost nothing.  Meanwhile, Max = Rachel has a bit more evidence. Rachel and Max exact same size and height. Same taste in food. One shows up months after one leaves ... then years later, one disappears as the other shows back up again. There are two different photos of Rachel that do not match. This theory gets shot down as ridiculous.  Meanwhile, ""smart and popular"" alone work for the ""Rachel is a Time Traveler"" theory.  It's just weird is all. I don't get it."
lifeisstrange,3deh3x,Diptam,2,Wed Jul 15 22:37:12 2015 UTC,"the pretty thing was just an addition. has nothing to do with all of that, just makes being popular a lot easier. should have mentioned it, sorry."
lifeisstrange,3deeih,Grayson754,6,Wed Jul 15 16:55:25 2015 UTC,"The Walking Dead Season 1 and ever since then, I've played all the Telltale games from then (except for Game of Thrones, only played three and have given up on it.) I'm definitely used to delays. Though, I find this the most excruciating! Life is Strange makes it difficult to even care about Telltale anymore as I find it does so much more right than they do, and I am 100% invested in this story over any others I've played before.   I'd have to say despite having loved The Wolf Among Us and suffering through those long waits, and now with Tales from the Borderlands too - Life is Strange takes the reins and wins the trophy for the most awful wait I've ever had for an episodic game!   I'm not gonna survive the Episode 5 wait.  RIP. Me."

lifeisstrange,3deeih,Jiewulf,3,Wed Jul 15 19:14:38 2015 UTC,"Before LiS, my only experience with episodic games were TellTales The Walking Dead, The Wolf Among Us, and also Kentucky Route Zero.   I've liked those games, for sure, but I think LiS is the game I've enjoyed the most. It makes it easier to wait if you don't care as much about the game. TWD was my first and I actually forgot about it at one point. xD But with LiS, I love it so much that the anticipation is killing me."
lifeisstrange,3deeih,Sebehr,3,Wed Jul 15 19:09:21 2015 UTC,"I started with The Walking Dead because of all the fans of it and it was on sale, so I got a few episodes of season 1, but could never get into it, probably because my controller was crap at the time which made it hard to focus. I'd honestly say this is my first episodic series because of that, and the wait for episode 4 is my first experience for waiting for the next sequence of a game."
lifeisstrange,3deeih,crimsonGungnir,3,Wed Jul 15 20:18:31 2015 UTC,"First one was Half-Life 2. Worst wait is also Half-Life 2.

Now I've played most of the Telltale games that are currently out (with the exception of The Wolf Among Us). I got into Life is Strange shortly after finishing TWD Season 2.   There hasn't been another genre of games that has affected me quite as much as episodic games. The stories are amazing, and those FEELS. These are things I wish bigger AAA games were able to grasp as perfectly as episodic does."

lifeisstrange,3deeih,haXona,2,Thu Jul 16 23:38:14 2015 UTC,"The Walking Dead: Season Two COMPLETE This was the first episodic game I played; I loved this freaking game. I loved it so much better than Season One from the twists and turns alone. I could see how Clementine's superhero status could upset people, but I loved it nonetheless. Episode Five was so intense for me to handle. Life Is Strange PLAYING I decided to spend the free PSN credit they give you on the first episode, and it was slow at first, but when I got through it all I actually really grew fond of it. Bought a season pass and am waiting for Episode Four. Tales from the Borderlands PLAYING I've been playing this game since the beginning, and I just love how funny and light-hearted the character development is. Seriously, some of the scenes actually made me laugh out loud which I never do.   I would say the worst wait I've ever experienced was for TWD: S2's Episode Five to come out. And then it came out faster than I thought, and I played it and enjoyed it to no end.  Also, I've been meaning to start Game of Thrones for a while, and plan to start playing it soon before it ends."
lifeisstrange,3deeih,TheGamingGreen,2,Fri Jul 17 03:10:05 2015 UTC,"I've been playing these since Telltale did a Back to the Future game, unless you count their Bone game as episodic."
lifeisstrange,3deeih,Civil_Barbarian,2,Fri Jul 17 04:59:25 2015 UTC,"Like many others here, I've played through both seasons of TWD. I tried Wolf Among Us and just couldn't get into it. Anyway, I've been gaming since way back when Windows 95 was big and have a Super Nintendo, original Playstation, Xbox360, and many subsequent consoles, however, I mostly go with PC these days.   I must say that, when I first heard the term ""episodic game,"" I shook my head and thought it was just another way for a developer to sell you pieces of a game. This was influenced in part by what were once known as ""patches"" (a little before Steam's time) and their subsequent transformation into ""DLC"" which could be sold as additions to games. In the beginning, I equated these ""episodes""  to those DLCs.   Now though, I've come to appreciate what episodic games like TWD and, of course, Life is Strange have become. Though the episodes aren't long, I don't find myself rushing to complete the game, especially when I have to wait for another episode. Another plus is that each episode gives me something new to look forward to.   So, tl;dr, used to think episodic games were a scam/gimmick, now I kind of appreciate them."

lifeisstrange,3deeih,rikutoar,2,Fri Jul 17 07:20:02 2015 UTC,"life is strange will be the last episodic game i ever bought before it is finished, i will absolutely get the sequel of life is strange if they make one, but never a telltale game again, if you think the wait for episode 4 is painfull, you probably didn't bought walking dead season 2 on release and had to wait almost a year for all episodes (dont know anymore if it took really that long, but it shure felt like it did).   this whole concept of episodic games is just wrong and i hope it will disappear soon"

Friend bought me LiS Episodes 1-5 to pay me back, and first 2 things I noticed was:   This game didn't take place in an alternate reality, or during an apacolypse no; it took place in a fairly normal (or so I thought ;D) town. Other thing; your choices actually matter. In TWD S1 at least imo not too much in terms of the weight of your choices (iirc) and charecters really shifted over but LiS even forces you to recall things you've done in the previous episodes."

I don't have a problem with episodic games, who would buy an episodic game if they have a problem with it?  It's just people, including me, getting a bit pissy with the large delay to Episode 4 and no official statements about it(as in release dates or any estimates) but we did get some hype by the Life is Strange Twitter today, so yea."

I can try to help you out if you own a jailbroken iPhone, tho :)  The Cydia tweaks I used were:  LS: LockHTML3 with Hybrid V2 widget (borderless), Jellylock7 with custom Jelly7ock v5 handler  HS: Winterboard, Springtomize 3, 28AA + Gunni-8 icons & UI, Mone.WhiteIconomatic, Moveable, Zeppelin with custom LIS icons  KB: ColorKeyboard for iOS 7 with custom nude theme, Bytafont 2 Tweak mode with Dudu Caliigraphy font  Now Playing: Custom Cover with modified Neue HD theme, Acapella  Messages: Messages Customiser with Saber theme  Winterboard is also used to theme the UI sounds.  I used Photoshop to modify the lockscreen & homescreen wallpapers. I think the original components came from tumblr and deviantart.  I apologize if this list isn't much help for you, but there are great communities/resources in /r/jailbreak and /r/iOSthemes that can help those new to the scene. That's where I learned how to do stuff like this.  If you want, I can drop the custom-made assets in a zip file and put it on dropbox, but bear in mind that this stuff is tailored for a 640 x 960 iPhone 4S screen, so it will look hella wonky on a 5(s), 6, or 6+"

Just do a google search and find high res pictures and load them up onto your phone and see how it looks. If you're wanting to get away from the generic look of touchwiz just use a new launcher like Nova etc. It's easy!

I've been keeping an eye on LiS since it was first announced, and boy, what a crazy ride we've had.  My favorite character is Max, I ship Pricefield to a mildly unhealthy degree, and I enjoy analyzing the gameplay and story integration of games entirely too much.  I'm a contract programmer for a few indie games companies in Louisiana, so when I'm not playing games, I'm making them.  I also created and regularly edit/view the Life Is Strange TV Tropes page and all relevant subpages.  If you haven't checked them out yet, give 'em a looksee, and feel free to contribute as you see fit!  I also like candlelit dinners, long walks on the beach, and getting ready for the mosh pit.

lifeisstrange,3dap7s,nubetoob111,2,Tue Jul 14 20:53:28 2015 UTC,Aloha ke akua!  Lilo and Stitch taught me that ;)
lifeisstrange,3dap7s,SoniaBowLady,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:23:21 2015 UTC,I'm very glad to see you guys on the moderation team!  I wish you all the strength needed to moderate when Episode 4 drops and a lot of fun. c:
lifeisstrange,3dap7s,Leviro2005,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:29:40 2015 UTC,"Ooh, /u/haXona and /u/ThreadOfFate made the team! I figured you guys would get on board. Congratulations~"
lifeisstrange,3dap7s,haXona,1 point,Tue Jul 14 22:57:41 2015 UTC,"Aww thanks again, see this is why this sub is pure love for me :P"
lifeisstrange,3dap7s,Leviro2005,-7,Wed Jul 15 02:33:20 2015 UTC,"Great, that's all we need, more dictatorial assholes to shadow ban people.  Glad we have six moderators for a small community though. 1 moderator for every thousand subscribers seems totally reasonable."
lifeisstrange,3dap7s,haXona,-7,Wed Jul 15 04:31:07 2015 UTC,"Yeah honestly who the fuck cares. All mods are interested in doing is laying out bans and removing comments that disagree with them (especially these handful of chumps which are green as can be, not ever being a moderator before).  If anyone would feel inclined to fuck with them (or most of the users on the subreddit), they should PM the spoilers Episode 4 and 5 leaks."
lifeisstrange,3dap7s,SoniaBowLady,7,Wed Jul 15 04:54:14 2015 UTC,"The new mods can't ban anyone. The only things they're meant to do, according to this, are:    Enforcing the rules by removing rule-breaking submissions and comments Applying link flairs to submissions that are missing them as well as editing incorrect link flairs Updating our Recommended wiki pages with the suggestions from other users   I don't understand why you guys are being negative just because we got some new mods. If there happens to be an abuse of power (which I'm sure won't happen), then /u/DuckOfDuckness would surely do something about it."
lifeisstrange,3dap7s,haXona,-1,Wed Jul 15 07:43:03 2015 UTC,Oh yeah because mods have a great track record of acting in the interest of the community and totally outing one another in the case of one going rogue. Oh wait - no they fucking don't.  The last thing a small community needs is a high user to mod ratio.
lifeisstrange,3dap7s,SoniaBowLady,5,Wed Jul 15 19:16:09 2015 UTC,Im saddened by your view of mods especially ones that will be working with a community we love. Why the hell would I ban or remove comments just because I dont agree with them?  Your previous comment is even more infuriating because of you acting like you already know that we will ban and delete people just for funzies. Its a very narrow minded opinion if I might say :)  I'm just putting out my opinion here plus we wont be banning people so if your reading comprehension was a bit better your comment would be vastly different.
lifeisstrange,3dap7s,Leviro2005,3,Wed Jul 15 21:01:21 2015 UTC,"I mean, you of all people should be banned for using IE...  But I have no idea what problems some people have with mods in general, it just seems like irrational hate to me."
lifeisstrange,3dap7s,SkateboardCop,2,Wed Jul 15 22:31:17 2015 UTC,"Hahah touché but I seriously have my municipal government on my ass on why I need IE(I'm a part time politician), I can't switch that because the special applications only work on IE :/  So yeah I got used to it more and more :P  I would think that people on this would already know who we guys are and why I for one don't think any of us would go rogue. We love the game just as much as you do so why the hell would we go rogue and ruin a complete sub just for funzies?"
lifeisstrange,3dap7s,Leviro2005,1 point,Thu Jul 16 07:42:49 2015 UTC,"Sounds like South Korea and their need to use IE6 or 7. Sucks for them.  I think thats the idea behind the requirement that you are active on the sub before, so that /u/DuckOfDuckness  could see a bit of what you guys are like and weed out people who might be inclined to mess around. Besides, I'm pretty sure he has everything backed up somewhere."

lifeisstrange,3dddeu,marion1984,8,Wed Jul 15 11:40:57 2015 UTC,It's a reference to groundhog day. In the movie the main character is reliving the same day over and over again and the song that plays on his alarm clock radio each morning is that.

Which sucks, because we're dying over here and it really blows they're betraying that 8 week release window, but such it is with Episodic content.

lifeisstrange,3d9vn0,RustyChoy,24,Tue Jul 14 18:06:20 2015 UTC,"Seriously, at this point they could say that it will be out on the 28th, and I'd just be happy to have SOME news."
lifeisstrange,3d9vn0,koraat,6,Tue Jul 14 18:24:15 2015 UTC,"Absolutely. All I want now is to know at least when it would be expected, more or less, to be coming out, if not the exact release date. If they say that it won't be by next week at least I know it will be a bit further, and won't desperate waiting for it like if it was coming right now."
lifeisstrange,3d9vn0,mikealwy,4,Tue Jul 14 20:35:46 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'd rather be told it was severely delayed and given an estimated window of release dates or something than not told anything. Anticipation is only exciting at first, when you keep someone on their toes for weeks at a time it just creates frustration.

lifeisstrange,3d9vn0,other_other_self,6,Tue Jul 14 18:22:53 2015 UTC,"Well, let's be fair. I'm no video games industry expert, but I'm pretty sure the release date and the decision about when to announce it is entirely up to the publisher rather than the developer, unless development itself hit a big snag. Square Enix tends to be very tight-lipped about info. I bet Dontnod wants to tell us a date as much as we want to be told one. For all we know, they might even be holding onto a finished episode, but SE wants to time it around competing releases or something.  Not that that's really going to make anyone feel any better, but at least we should direct our frustration at the right people. ;)"
lifeisstrange,3d9vn0,DenialMC,2,Tue Jul 14 23:28:52 2015 UTC,"You're on the right track. When a game gets delayed, it's often for technical reasons (e.g. to allow time for bugfixing), but it's just as likely that the publisher wants a delay for the sake of scheduling or marketing (e.g. making sure the release doesn't draw attention away from another major title)."

lifeisstrange,3d9vn0,natedoggcata,2,Tue Jul 14 19:01:56 2015 UTC,Fantastic reaction gif
lifeisstrange,3d9vn0,NukaColaV101,5,Tue Jul 14 19:06:19 2015 UTC,"This is BS :( I would be so much more chill if they just communicated with us. If they at least acknowledged the delay   they deleted tweet, but a girl tweeted them saying something like ""the game is late and its almost 8 weeks"" and they responded something like ""we never said 8 weeks, can you show us where you saw this?"" and I distinctly remember this cause the response got FLAMED by a bunch of people but I forgot to take a screenshot so I'm assuming why they deleted that tweet.  I wouldn't be so annoyed. But the fact that they even deny that it is delayed infuriates me! Just be honest with us DONTNOD :("
lifeisstrange,3d9vn0,natedoggcata,3,Tue Jul 14 21:06:04 2015 UTC,I thought this too to be honest. I remember seeing an interview with Dontnod and IGN during E3 where they stated Episodes 4 and 5 were on track for the 6-8 week release period.
lifeisstrange,3d9vn0,NukaColaV101,12,Tue Jul 14 21:58:46 2015 UTC,ARE YOU SERIOUS.  This is honestly making Rockstar Games look fast.  And it took them nearly 2 years to release something that was hyped up.
lifeisstrange,3d9vn0,galacticbrownie,3,Tue Jul 14 17:16:05 2015 UTC,"Man I remember they announced Grand Theft Auto V and we didnt get any info about it until 2 years later. The wait for that was crazy. I wondered why the hell they even bothered announcing the game if it werent going to be released for another 3 years.   Same thing The Witcher devs did with Cyberpunk. It was announced a few years ago and they said it probably wont even be out until 2017 or 2018. Whats the point? That doesnt build hype, thats just annoying"
lifeisstrange,3d9vn0,NukaColaV101,3,Tue Jul 14 18:34:32 2015 UTC,"Seems to be a running theme though for at least a few games that Square Enix has their logo on. Announce something, then delay it or don't share anything until no one gives a shit anymore. See: Final Fantasy XV. Sure, those are completely different development studios, but the point stands.  I feel like Dontnod has sort of ran into a problem in development though and that's what's holding up any announcement, if the episode's even done."
lifeisstrange,3d9vn0,galacticbrownie,4,Tue Jul 14 18:42:01 2015 UTC,Wasnt Final Fantasy XV called something else at first?   and I am guessing that EP 4 has been delayed. Personally it doesnt bother me. Id rather them release it when its ready instead of it being buggy and broken
lifeisstrange,3d9vn0,melitonz,2,Tue Jul 14 18:46:11 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it was originally announced as FF Versus XIII back in 2006."
lifeisstrange,3d9vn0,Ara-Player,2,Tue Jul 14 19:22:08 2015 UTC,2006!? Jeez..I forget it's been that long! Just experienced a minor existential crisis.. o_o
lifeisstrange,3d9vn0,Ara-Player,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:54:21 2015 UTC,"Right? It's scary to think about how 9 years passed since that game was announced. Just another example of a game stuck in development hell, even though technically the version they're releasing is for all intents and purposes a completely different project. Ah, at least it's turning out to be a good game, from what I could tell of the demo that was released back in May."
lifeisstrange,3d9vn0,5kyLegend,2,Tue Jul 14 22:10:50 2015 UTC,"Agreed, it looks great! I mean, it better be, what with a decade-long wait under its belt, right? Now I wonder how long the newly announced FF7 remake will take.. 2035 maybe? On the PS6? lol"

Ep 3 played in the night from tuesday to wednesday. So, the scene, where Max visits Chloe, is WEDNESDAY MORNING :D If ep 4 continues there, what is very likely, it will play on wednesday c:  And, we just think about it, there is no official statement about the weekdays.

lifeisstrange,3d9vn0,HanC0190,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:58:58 2015 UTC,"I'm afraid you're mistaken. Ep 3 starts Tuesday night, but then Max and Chloe go back to Chloe's house and wake up Weenesday morning. Near the end of the episode Chloe drops Max off at school, and then it cuts to her dorm room. After the stuff with the keys and Max is brought back to the present, it's then Wednesday evening, not Wednesday morning.  Not that this is particularly relevant anyway, since they announce the episode release date when they are able to, and there's little sign that there's actually a pattern."

lifeisstrange,3d9vn0,Nuify,3,Tue Jul 14 19:38:23 2015 UTC,"I dont think they would piss of everyone  and delay the episode without giving ANY information at all, just so the 5th ep is closer to Halloween."

lifeisstrange,3dbfdw,RenderedKnave,7,Tue Jul 14 23:39:14 2015 UTC,"Yes... The references are all pretty obvious. lol, especially the Squenix licensed properties (being the new tomb raider, and final fantasy).  Also, in episode 2 Warren G. says a breaking bad reference. There's references everywhere, it's a tool used to make the world more ""real"" and believable."
lifeisstrange,3dbfdw,kemando,1 point,Wed Jul 15 00:39:25 2015 UTC,What reference?
lifeisstrange,3dbfdw,Blittzzo,1 point,Thu Jul 16 04:08:55 2015 UTC,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAMTE6coAFM
lifeisstrange,3dbfdw,kemando,4,Thu Jul 16 06:46:40 2015 UTC,"Here's some notable ones   The bus in the junkyard is numbered 142, same as the bus from Into the Wild Every car license plate in the episode 1 parking lot is TV show reference. The arcadia bay missing person list includes ""Wiston Smith"" the main character from 1984.  There's also ""Elton Kesey"" aka, ""Ken Elton Kesey"" who wrote ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"". There's also a photo of Joyce and him  in the diner (or maybe Joyce's house) Max has the same last name as Holden Caulfield, main character of Catcher in the Rye. Max has a ""The Winger and the Cow"" poster that looks similar to the cover of Catcher in the Rye. I believe the license plates in episode 2 around the diner are references to books, but I (or someone else) would have to double check. Stella's dorm room is 127, her slate has ""REDRUM"" (with a backwards R) which is a Shining reference. David's car in the garage license plate is True Detective, can't remember how they shorten it. The strange symbols on the shed by the lighthouse are taken from La Horde du Contrevent, written by Alain Damasio,co-founder of Dontnod.   That's just off the top of my head and little googling to get details right. But the game is chocked full of references and I keep finding new ones.  edit: oops, TVTropes did it first, and has more stuff. As far as I can tell the only thing not listed there is Ken Kesey missing person."
lifeisstrange,3dbfdw,SkateboardCop,2,Wed Jul 15 06:12:40 2015 UTC,"Yep! Life is Strange is peppered with all kinds of shout outs. I know the Spirits Within is because Square Enix published the game, hah. Also, the parking lot is filled with other shout outs. Every single car with a license plate is a shout out to something. There was a post floating around here documenting it, but I don't have it on hand."
lifeisstrange,3dbfdw,RasereiHojo,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:53:50 2015 UTC,I know The Spirits Within was a movie. What I mean is that the reason this particular shout was included was because Square made the movie and published Life is Strange. It was Dontnod giving Square a nod and a thank you.

Digging out all the references to other games, movies, books, and spending hours in the parking lot reading all the plates.  You might be interested in this TV Tropes page. It's pretty exhaustive so far. (EDIT: Of course this page contains spoilers for episodes 2 and 3 as well.)"
lifeisstrange,3dbfdw,Summerfell1,2,Wed Jul 15 16:09:08 2015 UTC,All of the number plates in the parking lot where we first meet Warren are references to the developer's favourite shows.

lifeisstrange,3dawba,RyteNau,25,Tue Jul 14 21:17:32 2015 UTC,Its confirmed that the budget had to be cut somewhere and the lipsync was one of those parts. It doesn't really take away so much from the experience IMO and I am glad they focused their budget on the right things and then went down from that :)  In the future they said that if they have the resource to do better then that is definitely set
lifeisstrange,3dawba,GymKerry,5,Tue Jul 14 21:28:43 2015 UTC,Exactly. Michel said that most of the budget went into writing a good story (jackpot!) and hiring proper voice actors.  It was a good decision. At first the lipsync was very distracting for me but as of now I focus on other aspects of the game.
lifeisstrange,3dawba,FlaminPenis,3,Tue Jul 14 22:20:50 2015 UTC,"personally, I would pay 5 more units of us currency for each episode if the facial expression (including lipsync) problem is fixed. (also wondering how much more would it cost to fix it?? will we have a LIS lipsyncd edition 10 years later)"
lifeisstrange,3dawba,haXona,3,Wed Jul 15 02:13:07 2015 UTC,Of course we can sit here and count things how we want but really for a company that was almost bankrupt Lipsync is the least of the problems. But I hear you :)  There are several technologies for stellar Lipsync that companies that have money use and invest in. The most apparent one being the motionscan in L.A.Noire (big favourite for me) which had an uncanny vallet feeling all over it for some :P  So the budget for Lipsync can fly through the roof if you dont handle it correctly.  I am guessing Dontnod took the easy road on Lipsync and used the best they could at the time during develop and then kept it open if they would have the budget left. We all know later that the budget wasn't enough for improvements :P
lifeisstrange,3dawba,FlaminPenis,2,Wed Jul 15 02:30:50 2015 UTC,damn. i watch the video (L.A. Noire - Lip Syncing). does it really require all those cameras?? is it possible to get lipsync from audio instead of videos captured from so many cameras at different angles?
lifeisstrange,3dawba,haXona,2,Wed Jul 15 02:46:24 2015 UTC,The motionscan tech was just to show off how if you want something to be authentic it will cost you a fortune. There are other methods of course :P  I am however not so much into Lipsync tech because I haven't had the opportunity to try it out any Lipsync technology yet. I wouldnt be surprised if there was lots of different methods that devs could use that span across several budgets.
lifeisstrange,3dawba,FlaminPenis,2,Wed Jul 15 04:05:17 2015 UTC,i do believe that it would cost the developers a fortune. its just that this game is so close to perfection . wish i had the money to invest this game. it is the second single player game i obtained by purchasing since i was born!!

lifeisstrange,3dawba,SteveJEO,1 point,Fri Jul 17 11:24:56 2015 UTC,"There are other methods yeah but you still have to compromise somewhere.  Mocap isn't actually that hard (and doesn't necessarily need to be expensive) but it feeds back into lots of other developmental jobs.   E.g. You can do good resolution lip synch but does it work with your in game models and do your animators have the time to sort it properly? If they do, will it work with the art style?  You can't just do 'lips' because humans do not perceive faces that way... faces are really bloody complicated and it all has to work together or you screw your budget on something you don't have time to integrate properly and the players will get horrific uncanny valley nightmares etc."

lifeisstrange,3dawba,Grayson754,6,Thu Jul 16 20:43:37 2015 UTC,"At first, the lipsync distracted me quite a bit, but by the middle of Episode 1, I was so hooked by the story that I honestly didn't even care. Everything else in this game is fantastic."
lifeisstrange,3dawba,kemando,5,Tue Jul 14 22:24:25 2015 UTC,"There was an interview that said for their budgets they spent the money on the writing and the acting and less on the art/animation/and modeling. I believe it was said that the character models and how they're rigged are physically incapable of having proper vocal animation for lip syncing.  This doesn't address the issue with timing though, as mouths are open when lines aren't being said and such, I feel like with some tweaking it could be fixed to look much better, but it would take more time. We're definitely never getting Witcher 3 level lip syncing though."
lifeisstrange,3dawba,SkateboardCop,2,Wed Jul 15 00:43:17 2015 UTC,"chances are we'll never get improved lip sync since it's a tech issue (can't remember where this was confirmed but ya it's an issue at the engine level) since at the very least they'd have to redo all the facial animations. Which at very best would just require a shit ton of work because they'd have to rig every bit of talking manually to get a decent sync, and at worst would require doing more mo-cap and possibly re-recording lines.  So the real question is when is somebody going to get a USB drive with the game, rewind, show it to Square Enix and convince them to give Dontnod a bigger budget so they can have proper lip syncing from the start?"
lifeisstrange,3dawba,TheMarshmallowBear,3,Wed Jul 15 01:11:51 2015 UTC,"Bug? This isn't a bug.  They just don't have the proper technology to do it.  I know they wished they did though, but as of right now I don't think it's possible for them."

I'll just wait until they're all released. I bought it with the understanding that there'll be a new one released every 6-8 weeks. That's turned into 10+ weeks now? Maybe they're trying to drum up hype before the last two release but it kind of kills part of the fun putting so much time between episodes and getting our hopes up to keep making us wait longer. Id rather not...It's an awesome game but this waiting and lies of 6-8 weeks sucks. At this rate Episode 5 can be expected in October."
lifeisstrange,3d9yyr,cryssie83,7,Tue Jul 14 18:32:29 2015 UTC,"That's how these episodic games go...there's always delays as they write and produce the games as they go along.  Same issues with Telltale Games (Walking Dead, etc).    They're not intentionally drumming up hype (more like they're disappointing paying customers).  They're working under an extremely tight (self imposed) deadline that isn't always going to be met."
lifeisstrange,3d9yyr,PRGuyHere,4,Tue Jul 14 19:46:27 2015 UTC,Honestly 8 weeks is ridiculously short compared to other episodic games. I'm surprised dontnod is even aiming for such a tight deadline in the first place.
lifeisstrange,3d9yyr,zqwefty,4,Tue Jul 14 21:32:17 2015 UTC,"I was about to say the same thing. I was pretty shocked that they were aiming for 8 weeks, and I believe they were actually going for 6 at first too. That's crazy. TellTale (I love them to death) but their games take FOREVER to come out. Seriously, it took quite some time to get the last few episodes to The Walking Dead Season 2, and not to mention The Wolf Among Us was completely delayed after Episode 1, taking up to 4 months just to get another episode.   Honestly, I'm not complaining. It could be worse. Way worse. I'm patient enough with waiting. I'm probably in the minority, but my hype for this episode has died down while waiting. It happens with every episodic game though, but as soon as they announce a date and release a trailer, I'll be right there counting down the rime to play it. :P"

Because that's how sales are tracked:  http://brokensecrets.com/2010/09/17/the-day-of-the-week-that-new-stuff-comes-out/  You also need to advertise your video game if you expect people to buy it.  Yes, there's a group of us here actively waiting, but we don't represent the majority of players.  You need to announce your release date in advance so that people know when to buy it.    There is no game today, which means there will be no game until next Tuesday at the earliest.  But there's also no announcement/advertisement/twitter post/etc, which means it's not likely to be next Tuesday either.  So people were (foolishly) thinking there'd be some suprise release today and now they're facing the cold hard truth that it's at least two weeks away.  That's why they're going ape."

As far as I know there's no way to buy episode 2-3-4 as standalones, so using the excuse for tracking sales at this point is a red herring. It's simply released when it's done and everything is in place for the launch.   You also need to advertise your video game if you expect people to buy it.   That's 100% true.

But there's also no announcement/advertisement/twitter post/etc, which means it's not likely to be next Tuesday either.   That's true, but it's also a holiday today, and people in France usually also take the week-end and the Monday off when the 14th of July (or any other national holiday) is a Tuesday. There's no one available to talk right now. I personnally expect an official announcement (date, trailer and/or whatnot) tomorrow.

lifeisstrange,3dbb3s,lixyna,2,Tue Jul 14 23:21:36 2015 UTC,"Blackwell is a private school. Even if it were a public institution, schools are wary about allowing people onto campus who don't belong there. If someone wants to be on campus, they need to go to the principal and do some minor paperwork (optional) to get a guest pass.  Universities are different since they're so vast, but high schools have young adults there, most of them underage. So the higher ups want to know who is there and who does/does not belong there to keep the students safe."
lifeisstrange,3dbb3s,RasereiHojo,2,Tue Jul 14 23:24:13 2015 UTC,"It's not necessarily trespassing in the US, but there's so much paranoia of school shootings that in most places now you have to pass some level of security to get past the main lobby (typically it's nothing more than signing in, though some schools now have metal detectors and armed security officers, and most places even require an escort if you want to do anything other than wait in the lobby). In the real world, Chloe would probably be turned away pretty quick, no way could she be there without someone noticing."

Not necessarily true. It's an old prep school, and they tend to operate a bit differently. Security usually isn't so tight. What you're talking about is more common in large public high schools."
lifeisstrange,3dbb3s,BostonTentacleParty,2,Wed Jul 15 06:38:01 2015 UTC,"Most college and university campuses, you're free to move around. These are big campuses with multiple roads going through them and lots of stuff (performance halls, libraries, museums) that outsiders might want to visit.  Big preppy private high schools with college-sized campuses often let people move through as if they are college campuses.  Normal high schools have shockingly tight security. This has only gotten more extreme over the years. Many new American high school buildings are designed by architectural firms that build prisons, using similar principles.  It's hard to say where Blackwell would be. It's private, there's an art exhibit on the front lawn, and students are probably allowed to have friends from the town come and visit. On the other hand, it definitely has the feel of a regular high school building, which would be pretty locked down."

lifeisstrange,3dahgz,GymKerry,12,Tue Jul 14 19:35:53 2015 UTC,"I think it's pretty safe to say that the majority of people would prefer a full game release rather than an episodic format, the fact that it is episodic is just something we have to deal with.  Life is Strange is the best game I've played since 2014, and I own over 1100 games on Steam, it doesn't change the fact that the game is absolutely awesome. But I would strongly prefer a full game release."
lifeisstrange,3dahgz,Bodomi,7,Tue Jul 14 19:47:57 2015 UTC,"About 1/10th of us would be on this sub daily if it was all released at once. We'd all be out playing other games, making fan art at the least. There would be very little discussion 2 months later. There'd be no suspense, theories, etc. And the time between just allows the game to be more beautiful. With the waking dead games, the first episode looks like a piece of shit compared to episode 5. The animations and lip syncing does a complete turn around throughout the series. I can definitely tell LiS is doing the same and is getting more beautiful. It really helps the devs make something great when they get our time and money while already in the middle of the developing process."
lifeisstrange,3dahgz,HeckaFrosty,3,Tue Jul 14 22:58:25 2015 UTC,"It's why most episodic games I've always waited until all episodes were out before buying. Life Is Strange is the first time I purchased/played before it was completely released. I love the game immensely, but this will probably be the last time I purchase/play before the entire season is completed.   Honestly, if it was less of a wait (set release dates one month apart), it'd be more tolerable."

TFTBL took 4 months between episodes! so yeah... i appreciate dontnod commitment for delivering episodes in shorter times, but there comes a time when you play an episodic game, that there is nothing to discuss anymore. and this is where we are now. too much wait can kill it for me, its my personal opinion of course.. but i'm kinda over discussing episode 3 right now. that can change depending on when you played the game, but for me i played it soon as it was announced and i've discussed everything there is.. i hope episode 4 comes sooner and not turn into telltale 4 months of waiting."

lifeisstrange,3dahgz,HeckaFrosty,4,Tue Jul 14 22:07:35 2015 UTC,Everyone complaining about DONTNOD must've played the Telltale games after they were fully released because I'm still recovering from that torture..
lifeisstrange,3dahgz,solas29,2,Tue Jul 14 23:00:00 2015 UTC,"Hahaha, so true :D  Things they pull off with Tales From The Borderlands as of now are just pathetic"
lifeisstrange,3dahgz,solas29,5,Tue Jul 14 23:04:17 2015 UTC,"Episodic format heightens my emotions; I get more excited, have more time for discussion with people as we're all on the same page after playing the latest episode, and the wait just makes me realize how much I love Life Is Strange because i talk about it every day practically all day. I feel like it's easier to view episodic games as stress relievers. Not that full games don't do that for me (they're the only thing that has helped me with my struggles with chronic anxiety), but they're short and rewarding, and the feeling of guilt after playing for too many hours and ignoring responsibilities is a lot harder to get."
lifeisstrange,3dahgz,Sebehr,3,Tue Jul 14 22:58:09 2015 UTC,Thanks for the great response :)

lifeisstrange,3dahgz,haXona,6,Tue Jul 14 23:12:28 2015 UTC,"I have a love/hate relationship with the episodic releases.  On one hand, I hate it. Sometimes the wait is grating. Two months isn't so bad, like with LiS, but there are other episodic games where you're waiting even longer and it gets difficult to wait (Kentucky Route Zero, anyone?).   On the other, I do love it because it gives us a longer experience. If it was a one time release, we'd all play it, maybe discuss it for a few weeks, speculate about what this symbolism or that dialogue means, and then move on. With the episodic schedule, we get to talk, speculate, try to predict what will happen in future installments. It gives us more motivation to really look at the game's symbolism and try to obtain a deeper understanding of the story. And we all band together as a community while we wait for the next segment to be released. I also like that it gives developers a chance to get community feedback so they can create better iterations.  So, yeah. It sucks to wait, but I think it's worth it. I do wish there was some way to have shorter, but more frequent episodes. But I don't really mind it as long as it's not an immense wait."
lifeisstrange,3dahgz,SpaceHorseRider,4,Tue Jul 14 23:11:07 2015 UTC,"I love Life is Strange and I'm glad I purchased it when I did (after ep. 1 released and shortly before ep. 2, so I only have a few days to wait). I've had fun thinking things over, replaying with different choices and checking out the theories and analyses from other gamers - it really added a completely different element to any game I've ever played before.   However, if I had it to do over again, I would probably enjoy the gameplay more if I would have waited until ep. 5 release to start playing. I would have completely missed out on the outside-the-game component, which would have been sad, but for pure immersion/gameplay enjoyment waiting would have been better."
lifeisstrange,3dahgz,kemando,5,Tue Jul 14 21:24:12 2015 UTC,I work part time and study 150% so for me episodic releases are better for me. If I had time though - like now in the summer - then I would probably want the full package :)
lifeisstrange,3dahgz,Jxx,5,Tue Jul 14 21:32:51 2015 UTC,"One of the best gaming experiences I have dates all the way back to 1998. Origin Systems released Wing Commander: Secret Ops episodically and for free on the internet.  In some ways it was a trial run to see if digital delivery was a viable way to distribute and sell games, only it was way ahead of it's time.   Back in 1998 a 125MB download was pretty punishing when you were on dialup and paying for internet time.  On a 56k modem downloading was an all night affair.  While the starter pack was large (smaller if you didn't download the speech pack) the individual episode files were small. Origin basically completed the game and then released it in segments.  To save on bandwidth, they opted to keep a significant amount of the fiction out of the game and on the website.  All the episodes were release one a week over eight weeks.    When you finished an episode you were given a code based on your performance.  several times throughout the week while you waited for the next episode, new fiction was released on the website in the form of emails and messages and between characters. This fiction would change depending on the code you entered.  Anticipating a new gameplay segment much like the next episode of your favorite TV show was a great experience and a memory I cherish.  That all-night download was well worth it.   Episodic games weren't even really talked about much again after that until Valve announced Half-life episodes... and those stretched out almost a year between episodes (or more?). Heck we're still waiting for episode 3, hehe.  (Another early entry in the episodic gaming historical annals would be Sin episodes, which died after the first episode when the developer was sold or went belly up)   What I see happening with Life is strange has echoes of the Half-life episodes to me (No, I don't mean that they won't release ep. 5).  Valve's explanation for going episodic was that they could concentrate on getting out more content faster if they didn't hold on to everything till it was all ready (lol...).  However, while the episodes did end up shorter than their full games, they still ended up pouring tons of time into polishing and testing and getting the games out, and each episode was a pretty meaty chunk of gameplay.   It would seem on paper that working on one episode at at time and releasing them individually when ready makes sense, but in game development, it's also impossible to predict a release schedule since you won't know what technical blockers will come up until they happen.  Resolving animations can be tricky (just ask the Star Citizen FPS guys). With each Half-life episode, the time between increase for each episode (as did perhaps their ambition).  The only way to really control your release schedule is to wait until you're done and plan out your releases of already completed content.   While I'm sure the Life is Strange devs have their game all roadmapped the sheer complexity of tracking all our choices means that (unless episode 3 ending was a ploy to scrap all our decision making..... I sure hope not) then the further you progress through the episodes and making sure everything is tracked right, programming just get more complex.   It's one of the main reasons you don't see truly branching mission/game design much any more.   Even Mass Effect cheated on making you choices really affect the actual endings (they claim ME3 is basically one big long ending... still doesn't keep me from feeling cheated).   From a personal perspective, two month waits between episodes are just long enough to lose interest. Personally,  a one month wait would be more than long enough.  I can easily play through an episode of Life is Strange 3 or 3 times (or more) in a week.   I like to try different angles to see  all the options and outcomes. I'll usually do a middle of the road play through initially, and then a completely good, and completely rotten playthrough.   But as I said, that is easily done in short order.  1 month gives us plenty of time for speculation, and theorizing.   2 months is a real haul. It feels like by the end of the two months everyone has started losing steam.   If there was some kind of smaller fiction releases from Don'tnod between episodes... It would certainly make the wait seem less problematic and heighten anticipation, but that would have had to have been planned from the get go to make the content meaningful depending on your game choices.    Anyway, sorry for the wall of text  TL/DR  I would prefer 1 month waits over 2 month waits, but I feel it's also impossible and unrealistic to expect a game that is still in development to stick to a precise release schedule since that schedule can't possibly predict the problems that might arise."

They're working so hard to release it to us as soon as possible, and definitely won't take 4 months like Telltale. The 8 weeks window was never a firm guarantee - but it is something that they had told to fans, so I do think some proper communication should be done. Who knows though, maybe it was a misunderstanding on SE Europe's part.   I sound pretty calm for someone who has been dead on the inside every day for 2 months. The wait doesn't lessen my hype; if anything, it adds up to it because I'm feeling antsy. Idk, like I trust Dontnod. It'll come soon."
lifeisstrange,3d9y2g,shawnjawn,3,Tue Jul 14 18:16:14 2015 UTC,"I agree so much with the Telltale statement. To be fair though, I believe they were working on 2 or 3 projects at the same time. The end product though of TWD S2 just didn't excite me anywhere near as much as LiS has been so far. I hope they continue to push out a great game in these last two episodes. I don't think I've ever been so excited for a game/episode to come out :)"
lifeisstrange,3d9y2g,solas29,3,Tue Jul 14 23:10:34 2015 UTC,"Oh, definitely agree there. They work on multiple projects so the wait is understandable even if very long.

lifeisstrange,3d9y2g,shawnjawn,5,Wed Jul 15 01:24:12 2015 UTC,"I was curious as well, because I see some posts that say they are done with this game/episodic games in general.   For me, it doesn't really bother me because I have other things to do to keep me occupied. But I understand the frustration of there not being any communication when it will be released. Still, I would rather it be glitch free than a half assed, pushed out attempt.   IMO, The Walking Dead S2 and The Wolf Among Us was much more frustrating because I waited 3 and 4 months respectively for the 2nd episodes to be released.  Overall, I love this sub. I want everyone to be happy to, and the complaints kind of worried me. :("

lifeisstrange,3d9y2g,shawnjawn,2,Tue Jul 14 19:26:36 2015 UTC,"To be honest, TWDS2 seemed a bit rushed because of the initial delay, then quick releases. I know they probably already had them all planned out and was working on the kinks, and they were working on TWAU as well, but I couldn't care less about the majority of the characters in TWDS2 except for the protagonist (not going to spoil in case other people haven't played it yet).   BUT...it was still a good game. I just liked TWAU much better, and I am loving LiS so much.   That being said...at least none of the above took 1 year and 3 months until the second episode was released *cough Broken Age *Cough"

As much as I love the game, I don't mind waiting for its release, as long as I get it soon.  8 weeks for episodes of this length is quite a short amount of time to stick to I think, especially when Telltale episodes are shorter and they take far longer to come out.  The fact that people are holding them to the 8 week thing like it's 8 weeks or bust, is silly."
lifeisstrange,3d9y2g,Bodomi,3,Tue Jul 14 22:17:38 2015 UTC,"Some people seem to forget the fact that they can't just release it, they have to actually finish it before they release it.

lifeisstrange,3d9ieg,FantomLibrarian,5,Tue Jul 14 15:36:19 2015 UTC,"Well.. cool in theory but.. the game is about finding out what is happening and getting to the end of it, it's not about knowing what is going to happen.  The idea might seem good, and would probably please some people but I can't imagine enough people would play that 'mode' for it to be worth by Dontnod to do it. And I would assume that they are working on things, as a result,  starting development on that would delay everything else; not worth it. It's like developers releasing day 1 DLC for games, when they could've used the time they took on creating shitty pre-order DLC on improving the game (Hint hint, I strongly disagree with day 1 DLC)  I would play through that mode over a large period of time, but assuming we will not have to pay for something like that, it wouldn't be worth for Dontnod to do it, because as I said, it would delay everything else they are working on.  Yes, I'm writing this as if they won't do it, because I don't think they will."
lifeisstrange,3d9ieg,Bodomi,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:48:01 2015 UTC,I'm not saying that the game would just loop forever - just that what we perceived to be the end would actually return to episode 1 and unlock additional content hidden until episode 5 is 'beaten'.  That way with episode 5 you've essentially doubled the length and value to the player.  Not to mention the fact that you retain physical items when you rewind...
lifeisstrange,3d9ieg,applepwnz,2,Tue Jul 14 16:39:41 2015 UTC,"I could see that, like a New Game + mode?"
lifeisstrange,3d9ieg,Smokinacesfan55,5,Tue Jul 14 18:27:20 2015 UTC,I'm fully convinced the game will end with you having to let your friend in the bathroom die at the start and move on from there as a stronger character.

lifeisstrange,3d9ieg,FilmingMachine,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:12:24 2015 UTC,It is possible code wise and keep in mind that the last achivement you can achieve on steam is called selfie awareness (might be connected to the beggining of episode 1) but that would kind of ruin (imo) the story of the game..

Watch Hayley Kiyoko in Insidious Part 3, SHES LITERALLY CHLOE all Chloe! WATCH IT and you will understand. Jennifer Aniston looks like Joyce sorry not gonna even make an exception there."
lifeisstrange,3dc15u,Bodomi,3,Wed Jul 15 03:00:38 2015 UTC,"I love them all except for Chloe, Chloe is not of Japanese descent in the game, thus the actor shouldn't be."
lifeisstrange,3dc15u,MentalSewage,-1,Wed Jul 15 09:14:22 2015 UTC,"Watch insidious part 3 , her character is literally Chloe. I've seen several people change her ethnicity or try to make her Kristen Stewart or Ellen Paige . she also played Velma and her ethnicity was never questioned ."

lifeisstrange,3d9eqc,lceCream,6,Tue Jul 14 16:00:09 2015 UTC,Hello. This is the CEO of EA. We would like to hire you and release this is an alternate scene for 60$.
lifeisstrange,3d9eqc,Bodomi,2,Tue Jul 14 15:53:20 2015 UTC,Upvoting for the lolz
lifeisstrange,3d938q,shepvakarian,8,Tue Jul 14 13:36:23 2015 UTC,"I could believe it. The game constantly hints that you shouldn't ""waste"" your power (when hiding in the pool, for example).  I remember Dishonored kept track of how many people you killed to determine good/bad endings. This could be something similar."
lifeisstrange,3d938q,lislislislislis,7,Tue Jul 14 14:35:31 2015 UTC,"if it is, I'm screwed because I like to spam the rewind button just because I like the look and sound of it."
lifeisstrange,3d938q,wHatTheFez,4,Tue Jul 14 17:45:34 2015 UTC,"I thought that too, but it would just be really dumb if they did that without warning. I thought that too during the railtrack scene in EP2 what if the game is easier the less you rewind, since I found it weird that you could actually get Chloe free without rewinding once (you have to be super fast tho)"
lifeisstrange,3d938q,Ara-Player,3,Tue Jul 14 13:48:11 2015 UTC,"This thought has also occurred to me, especially after hearing all these theories about Max`s power causing a tornado. It would be really cool if it somehow affected the ending not in a major way, though, as it indeed would be unfair to many players. For example, the less you rewinded the easier it will be to stop a tornado but you will manage to stop it anyway. But i really doubt that this will be true to any extent"
lifeisstrange,3d938q,Candalistic,3,Tue Jul 14 17:43:13 2015 UTC,"I dont know, but when I was playing EP2 and had to tell Kate to Go to the police or Wait for proof I rewinded 2 times then I couldnt anymore. Told her to wait, then to police, then to wait, then I made my mind and wanted to tell her to go to the police but fuck I couldnt rewind so I let it be.."
lifeisstrange,3d938q,zeroneraven,3,Tue Jul 14 19:24:13 2015 UTC,"I doubt they would have a straight up metric on the number of times a player rewinds, just because that would be a harsh punishment for people who aren't very good at puzzles and needed to rewind a bunch of times to solve it.  But it would be cool if there were repercussions on rewinding ""unnecessarily""; for instance, for trying to warn Alyssa."
lifeisstrange,3d938q,Sebehr,3,Wed Jul 15 01:51:30 2015 UTC,"I like that idea too! If something like this was implemented, I only see something more subtler happening. Like a couple lines of dialogue or something similar to Chloe changing her phone background to Max if you sided with her more."

lifeisstrange,3d9udm,Ozzytudor,2,Tue Jul 14 18:06:04 2015 UTC,"Sure, whatever. She still looks constipated though."
lifeisstrange,3d949s,Ara-Player,3,Tue Jul 14 13:45:30 2015 UTC,"Just a guess, but it sounds like the song that could close Episode 4 maybe?"
lifeisstrange,3d949s,Jonoftherocks,3,Tue Jul 14 19:03:23 2015 UTC,A while back people here said it sounded like  a ending song.
lifeisstrange,3d949s,zeroneraven,2,Tue Jul 14 19:16:46 2015 UTC,"It sound like maybe it's something that might play with the ending of Episode 4. The lyrics are ""Try to try again. hear yourself again, from time to time."" Possibly plays after Episode 4 when we find Rachel, or perhaps figure out what happened to her- or perhaps this plays as one of the ending themes if the game has multiple endings. Somehow the lyrics would reflect on that because it's telling you to ""try again"" almost like there's a better ending, just try again.  I don't know. It's a good song, but does have a very dark theme to it. I can see it being used in a very emotional, climatic way."
lifeisstrange,3d949s,Grayson754,2,Tue Jul 14 22:30:58 2015 UTC,That song sounds really cool. I also like this one I just found on the playlist:  Girls in Hawaii - Found in the Ground
lifeisstrange,3d949s,AlvarezMd90,2,Tue Jul 14 16:26:05 2015 UTC,"This song could definitely be in the OST. I'm excited to see what other music they use for episode 4  Also, that playlist has a few songs in it from LiS. (To all of you and Crosses to name a couple)"

I was imagining that maybe depending on your choices Max gets kicked out of Blackwell and has to go back to Seattle. Or Chloe's family breaks up/moves away. think sad but manageable.

Shit's gone on long enough.  That said, I prefer Pricefield. The friendship between the two of them is my favourite, and if it advances to something more, I'll be happy, but it's not a requirement. So long as Max and Chloe ride off into the sunset together I don't care if it's just as friends."

I definitely don't have a homosexual agenda, but seeing another run of the mill heterosexual relationship in a game is just meh.

And to me, it seems like Chloe has depth, but I'm a sucker for ""bad"" women, so I might be biased."

If Max and Warren get together, it just strikes me as any other teen high school romance. It's boring. Chloe brings a sense of adventure to the relationship, and her rich history with Max makes it much more interesting to me. And while I love queer romance, I would feel that way even if the genders were swapped."
lifeisstrange,3d9eno,Sheparud,4,Tue Jul 14 21:03:49 2015 UTC,"Max doesn't even seem to be into Warren, or am I missing something? She keeps saying ""oh he'd look so good with so and so"" never saying he'd be good for me (well her not me)."
lifeisstrange,3d9eno,BostonTentacleParty,3,Tue Jul 14 21:59:18 2015 UTC,"Yeah, despite how much of a jerk Brooke is, I always make sure to be super self-deprecating in my conversations with her. I want her to stop grouching at Max and just ask Warren out already.  Similarly, I'm staying friendly with Warren while avoiding anything alone or date-like. Friendzoning at full force. Need to get him out of the way of Pricefield."
lifeisstrange,3d9eno,jessebona,4,Tue Jul 14 23:08:02 2015 UTC,I feel like this is a troll or at least very uninformed. Max herself calls Warren clingy so it's a little hypocritical to like Wax when you criticise pricefield for the same reason. On topic: Pricefield all the way.

I'm a very anxious person, so it manifests veeery differently, but I can really relate to her feelings of having been betrayed and abandoned, plus the whole issue of blaming others for her misery because she deep down knows that's the only way for her to be able to handle her pain... that's probably the most personal thing I have in common with any of the cast."

Even her inner thoughts and opinions. Ill think something in my head as im playing then Max goes and says something really similar. She is a bit more 'forward' than me though. I would never go snooping through peoples stuff...... right in front of them. Or walk up to a stranger and talk to them. But I guess if I had the ability to rewind time I wouldnt be so scared of looking like a dork.  My personality type is INFJ so I may be very similar to kate (she is apparently INFJ) but we havent seen enough of her yet and we have only seen her in her depressed state.

lifeisstrange,3d8968,levir,1 point,Tue Jul 14 11:49:49 2015 UTC,I would say Chloe. My life story isn't the same as hers (my dad is thankfully still alive!) but I have experienced things when I was younger that have made me sensitive to people leaving me. And her story actually resonates deeply with me at this current time as I also feel like I am being abandoned and hurt by an extremely close friend. I'm still hurting but I feel as though through the game I am able to see multiple perspectives on my current emotions and see myself almost reflected in Chloe. I love this game lol

lifeisstrange,3d68em,chattypenguin,13,Mon Jul 13 22:45:52 2015 UTC,It's a choose your own path game and has a subromance plot with Warren so I'm sure the relationships develop with your choices and its not just set on one   Sure it's the main ship but others can happen in these kinds of games
lifeisstrange,3d68em,thederpyguide,11,Mon Jul 13 22:51:16 2015 UTC,If you read her diary you can tell she doesn't really like Warren that way. We can't control Max's feelings. I seriously doubt it will happen.

I mean, ok, Chloe is the character who tries to get Max to steal money and sneak into the swimming pool...and sometimes I get the impression that she's trying to turn Max into a mini-Rachel, but she's well worth a shot to me."
lifeisstrange,3d68em,jejeje117,1 point,Tue Jul 14 08:45:44 2015 UTC,"She can help Max as a friend too, not just as a romantic partner.  I can totally see why people ship pricefield, I certainly don't think there's nothing between them (if you have Max reciprocate at least, otherwise I still feel like Chloe is crushing on Max). Chloe's personality just rubs me the wrong way. I don't like how she gets jealous over Max' other friends, at times it feels like she wants to be the only friend in Max' life. As someone who's been fucked over by a friendship like that, I don't appreciate that dynamic."
lifeisstrange,3d68em,caprisa,1 point,Tue Jul 14 09:18:56 2015 UTC,"I'm hoping that alternate-Chloe proves to be more emotionally stable, because she'll still have a ton of issues...but not Rachel Amber/Step-douche issues. I mean, Max somehow has to get back to the original timeline because of the tornado (I think) and because otherwise all the previous decisions people made would be wiped, but that doesn't mean we won't get a chance to see how Chloe changed.  And I'm kind of hoping that Chloe matures a little bit. I mean, Max uses her rewinds for really trivial things, but she has to save the lives of everyone in Arcadia Bay, which is just so much pressure-Chloe already knows this, but hopefully it'll hit home soon and she won't be as focused on her own issues as the BIG, more immediate problem. I mean, Rachel Amber might have something to do with the impending destruction, but she might not.   Anyway, back on point, I think as Max changes so will Chloe, especially as Max's actions change dialogue etc with her.   Also, the other romantic option is Warren...who I really do not like. I understand he's maybe a bit socially awkward, but he reminds me of my ex-who I eventually had to friendzone, then essentially avoid(tothemax) and who still to this day sends me messages on Fb asking to meet up with me.  Basically, I get a creepy vibe from Warren, which is kind of stupid because he's a bunch of pixels on a screen, lol."

The three dead whales and the swarming birds in the sky signaled that.  That said, in the teaser she attends the Vortex Club party in her old clothes, so it's pretty likely that she'll find a way back to her own timeline within about half an episode.   Also, the other romantic option is Warren...who I really do not like. I understand he's maybe a bit socially awkward, but he reminds me of my ex-who I eventually had to friendzone, then essentially avoid(tothemax) and who still to this day sends me messages on Fb asking to meet up with me.   Oh, no. Just end it. No ""let's be friends and I can avoid you forever."" Just ""we're done and that's it."" If he still bugs you, you're free to block him and never worry about it again."

Alternatively, I suppose it could just be unusable as proof because it would photograph events that didn't actually take place if Max intervened instead.  2) A fresh smell would probably be more obvious, but that whole situation is a bit of a contrivance, yeah.  3) She doesn't know how her power works yet and doesn't want to risk screwing anything up. It is overly cautious but I never saw a problem with it.  4) Yeah that one is a bit strange and I've wondered about it myself.  5) This one is interesting, and I think it'll end up fully explained. Max instinctively thinks the lighthouse is safe, and I think part of the reason for that is that she knows (on some level) that Chloe is in or around it. I think the storm isn't a vision, that Max and Chloe are there on Friday, and Max's consciousness is zipping to all sorts of timelines and this is what we've been playing through. Maybe Chloe comes to get Max back from the cliff edge since she seems to be totally out of it.  That's a good summary of stuff, though. The game is very good and mostly very well thought out, but it's not perfect either. :)"
lifeisstrange,3d7w2l,kronj,1 point,Tue Jul 14 05:33:09 2015 UTC,"1) Ehh, if you're failing to help Chloe, the game tells you to grab the hammer then rewind. They had the idea down. Also, unless they could prove the picture wasn't taken before Max ran down to help, then it could be considered proof.   2) More obvious, yes. Although David doesn't even pretend to notice it until seeing the blunt.   3)Ehhh, keep in mind that Max is a bit of a geek. She should be aware that even the slightest change in her actions could change the outcome, hence why she washes her face, tears the photo, then captures the butterfly. She she does know this. However, doesn't know it at the same time.   5) I like the idea that she is actually there, and her actions are changing the outcome on Friday. Hence Chloe not begin there before she was saved, then there after. However, this doesn't explain how Chloe got there. Keep in mind that the entire scene is rather clean (IIRC that is). No transition to influence anything was done. Yet she shows up.   Absolutely love the game. Although I just thought I'd bring to light some issues, hoping for some kind of undeniable response."
lifeisstrange,3d7w2l,ThinkWithMusic,8,Wed Jul 15 01:25:38 2015 UTC,"I have to disagree with some of your points here.  Cloe recognizing the butterfly:  The butterfly doesn't stay in the corner. It flies away from the bucket the moment Nathan steps into the bathroom and sits on the sink for the rest of the scene (a place where Cloe did see it). If you don't want to replay you can see it coming into Nathan's eyesight in the launch trailer for EP1 here. Beside that, Cloe would even be likely to have noticed the butterfly since the game strongly establishes Cloe to love this shade of blue which is evident by her haircolor, the painted furniture in her room (and Max's monolog about it saying that she loved it when they were tweens) and even her house being painted in this blue by William.   David in Cloe's room:  David enters the room thinking Cloe took his gun. This, in my opinion, is a far more severe issue than the weed since , as you said, Cloe has been known to smoke weed in her room before. The weed might be neccessary distraction for David to not press on the missing gun or even find it. What I'm saying is that even if there was a possibility to completely conceal the weed, it might not result in the best outcome for Cloe.  Although this is just me trying to justify the situation. The game doesn't make any effort to suggest Max realizes this.  Max repeating her steps:  This is a teenage artstudent we are talking about here. We have no reason to believe that Max has any idea how all this works or even that she has a logical view of this world. That's what i love about this game. The charakters are not written to make sence or to have everything thought out but to be cringy and awkward, which i hope is intentional (""shaka brah""). Remember Max saying Drones are Weapons? Yeah.  Let me know what you think about my explanations or if I'm completely wrong.  Edit: formating"
lifeisstrange,3d7w2l,Courier-6,1 point,Tue Jul 14 06:46:16 2015 UTC,"Well yes, she may have seen the butterfly, it's hard to think that she would have memorized it after the events that unfolded between her and Nathan. It's hard to believe that she wasn't in shock after the whole event.   Also, it does fly in front of Nathan, yes. But doesn't Chloe come in after Nathan?   The weed might be necessary distraction for David to not press on the missing gun or even find it. What I'm saying is that even if there was a possibility to completely conceal the weed, it might not result in the best outcome for Chloe.   Then have a forced rewind ability at the end of the event. Like in EP3's diner. If it did fuck Chloe over more, let us see that. They even allowed us to interact with it. Just show David come in, not see the weed, then grab Chloe and drag her out talking about going to the police, then fade to paused grey.   Keep in mind when Max went into the bathroom, she then retraced all her steps. Washing her face, ripping the photo, then snapping the photo. So she is aware that the past influences the future. Or is assuming that her actions int he room would make Chloe and Nathan show up. Yet outside the room wouldn't. Really, the inverse of the reality.   Yes, max did think Drones are weapons. But a lot of the general population think drone = this. The interesting thing is that she immediately backtracks and talks about aerial photography using a drone. Either that's because she whipper her phone out and googled, or made it up on the spot. Hell, she may have just thought that a quad copter wasn't a drone. Because it fucking isn't Brooke. A drone needs some level of autonomous working. She had a remote controlled quadcopter but called it a drone to make it sound fancier.   No one is ever wrong. A lot of this is an opinion on impressions the game gives you. Unless a fact is presented."
lifeisstrange,3d7w2l,DuKoninck,5,Wed Jul 15 02:25:27 2015 UTC,"For the weed thing, even if Chloe smoked a bunch there's a huge difference in the smell if she had just smoked. It's way stronger. David would have known anyway."
lifeisstrange,3d7w2l,i-ship-wax,2,Tue Jul 14 06:37:18 2015 UTC,"Know, show, don't tell. My mom doesn't want me to eat in my room, so whenever she finds a plate in my room I tell her I brought the empty plate upstairs after eating it in the kitchen.  Ofcourse she knows better."
lifeisstrange,3d7w2l,Bodomi,1 point,Tue Jul 14 13:00:35 2015 UTC,"That said though, if the sight of the blunt is enough to change the subject from gun to weed, why not immediately after entering the room that is filled with fresh weed smell?"
lifeisstrange,3d7w2l,Ara-Player,4,Wed Jul 15 01:27:20 2015 UTC,"4) Correct me if I'm wrong, but I think that the butterfly in the bathroom flew on one of the sinks later when Max took a photo of it, not on the bucket, and that's how Chloe probably saw it, when she was pinned to the wall. Or it's a plothole. I dont know."
lifeisstrange,3d7w2l,EzioSC5,1 point,Tue Jul 14 07:26:20 2015 UTC,"Yes, Chloe may have seen it, but what's the chance she memorized it? She probably wasn't to keen on her surroundings considering Max went undetected. And that she was only really worried about Nathan."
lifeisstrange,3d7w2l,Ara-Player,6,Wed Jul 15 01:47:10 2015 UTC,"I agree strongly with the Kate and David thing, that irritated me a lot when it happened, that I couldn't use my ability to rewind to do both, and it shouldn't have been done that way.  The second point I don't really... see the problem to be honest. It's just Max wanting to help out and not thinking clearly on the spot ;p.  And your fourth point I agree, but... I guess that's small 'attention to detail' that they messed up a bit.  The rest I have no comments on ;p."
lifeisstrange,3d7w2l,Ara-Player,3,Tue Jul 14 05:28:16 2015 UTC,"What I find in the intervene/take photo scene is that you could also technically take a photo, and hide behind the wall so Kate doesn't see you. I always wondered why you couldn't do that."
lifeisstrange,3d7w2l,ashichuu,2,Tue Jul 14 06:36:04 2015 UTC,Flash photography is kind of hard to be stealthy about.
lifeisstrange,3d7w2l,spookycatlover,3,Tue Jul 14 10:42:38 2015 UTC,"I think the first one will be addressed later, how Max only has photos of what happened because they are LITERALY ""pieces of time"", that explains why she can travel back the photos."
lifeisstrange,3d7w2l,crimsonGungnir,1 point,Tue Jul 14 06:39:35 2015 UTC,"I've seen this idea around a few times, have you used all 3 saves? If not, please conduct a test. Go play Ep1 again, I think the following is all from EP1, but might be EP2. so I'll use a spoiler..   Regardless, she still could reverse until the exact point that David began being a dick, took the photo. Developed the photo, then rewinded again to the exact time the photo was actually taken, then bumrushed David screaming. Essentially, allowing the photo to be taken, and intervene. Which still could have been done anyways. Like, right after the photo. The previous saved like 30 seconds in a 2 minute conversation."

lifeisstrange,3d7jw4,CyanLights,1 point,Tue Jul 14 03:17:56 2015 UTC,I agree totally.
lifeisstrange,3d5763,smackjack,23,Mon Jul 13 16:49:20 2015 UTC,"It would be a good theory but I don't think it's the case. In either ep1 or ep3 (I think 1, but I forget), you can sit on the swing in Chloe's backyard and Max flashes back to a conversation where she tells Chloe she wants to be a photographer when she grows up, which I imagine is well before William dies.  Her being a photographer works well thematically, though. One of the first lines in the game is Jefferson referring to photos as ""little pieces of time,"" and given how this time travel power can be used, it makes perfect sense that it would be given to somebody with a massive wall of photos and a compulsion to take selfies. Max can probably go back to just about any day she could possibly want to. And maybe she'll have to use that ability by the end of the game. It implies there's a purpose to Max, of all people, having this ability."
lifeisstrange,3d5763,kronj,16,Mon Jul 13 17:06:22 2015 UTC,"I think that Max has always been interested in photography, but William's death could be the thing that turns her interest/hobby into an obsession. Addiction is a major theme in Life is Strange, and Max's addiction is ""framing the world only as only she can see it""."
lifeisstrange,3d5763,kronj,2,Mon Jul 13 17:16:59 2015 UTC,"Yeah, you might be right. It's certainly true that the style of photos William took seems to be Max's favorite."
lifeisstrange,3d5763,AERXihu,-2,Mon Jul 13 17:22:46 2015 UTC,Max may be a photo nerd but she isn't obsessed at all. Any picture Max can take is 100% optional besides 3 selfies in the game so far along with when Max takes that picture of something. (I forgot but they show Max holding a camera to something then it flashes to storm or atleast in a trailer i saw idk)
lifeisstrange,3d5763,TAGsvk,2,Mon Jul 13 17:43:33 2015 UTC,"That would be weird if game was forcing you to do these pictures, dont you think ? Also one shot - one free achievement so..."
lifeisstrange,3d5763,AERXihu,-1,Mon Jul 13 18:04:53 2015 UTC,So? I don't really get what you are implying  EDIT:What is with this downvoting on my comments.
lifeisstrange,3d5763,vazod,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:06:10 2015 UTC,not sure what the down voting's for i see what your trying to say but there's no reason to down vote cause they disagree. i always up vote even if they make a valid point
lifeisstrange,3d5763,OneJobToRuleThemAll,5,Tue Jul 14 19:40:36 2015 UTC,"It would be a good theory but I don't think it's the case. In either ep1 or ep3 (I think 1, but I forget), you can sit on the swing in Chloe's backyard and Max flashes back to a conversation where she tells Chloe she wants to be a photographer when she grows up, which I imagine is well before William dies.   Came here to point that out. It's episode 1 for anyone interested.   Her being a photographer works well thematically, though.   That's no coincidence: photography, returning to your hometown, the rekindling of a childhood friendship, the references to old TV shows, the mood lighting and music are supposed to create, the color pallet... All that is supposed to create a feeling of nostalgia, which neatly complements the time travel mechanic (whose end graphical effects are created with images of burning film and lens effects, while the process of reversing time shows an illusion of your past self...) and eases older players into a story about a teenage girl by pulling them back into that time of their life. I also creates a perfect contrast to all the modern technology, which Max then sets itself apart from by using a type of camera that is itself a relic of the past. Chloe is troubled by the loss she experienced in her childhood, Kate clings to tradition, Victorias style is incredibly retro, David is mentally still in a war zone... Arcadia Bay itself can't seem to decide whether it wants to exist in the past or present.   It's quite masterfully assembled, the same thematic threads stretch throughout game mechanics, interface, story, art style... Everything is composed of multiple layers that reinforce the four main themes of nostalgia, adolescence, time travel and photography.   And even those reinforce each other! Time travel was the parting point, player choice gets greatly aided by the time travel mechanic, adolescence increases the meaningfulness of player choice through emotional investment and (like the developers never fail to point out) is the time in our life where this kind of time travel would be most useful, nostalgia is a running theme with time travel and and a necessary component of adolescence for those that have passed their twenties, photography is a metaphorical version of time travel, one of the greatest providers of feelings of nostalgia and a direct link to our own adolescence. And because Max returns to Arcadia bay in her late teens, even younger generations can find a lot of meaning in the nostalgic atmosphere. Like in that swing scene. And we've come full circle. Because everything reinforces everything."
lifeisstrange,3d5763,kronj,2,Tue Jul 14 01:55:13 2015 UTC,"A good post.  You've summed up all the reasons I really like this game. Usually you have to make some allowances for video game stories. Usually the people who write the story aren't writers, usually nobody has put real thought into the motivations of the characters, usually the narrative is at odds with the game mechanics, and so on.  LiS isn't that sort of game. It seems to have none of these problems. It's become more obvious with every episode that talented people, who understand plot, character arcs, mood, and theme, have put a great deal of thought into this game and its story. I don't believe there is a single detail that has been inserted without careful consideration. This game succeeds far better than others in the same genre at making you feel invested in the story and the characters, and I have faith that the final two episodes are going to be great."
lifeisstrange,3d5763,OneJobToRuleThemAll,3,Tue Jul 14 05:15:37 2015 UTC,"usually the narrative is at odds with the game mechanics   One of my favorite game critics calls that ""ludonarrative dissonance"" :D  There are some great examples of games who also achieve this quite brilliantly, but far too many games just get it completely wrong. And it's just so much easier to point out how a game gets it wrong than to get it right."
lifeisstrange,3d5763,TAGsvk,10,Tue Jul 14 07:15:25 2015 UTC,This would make good backstory actually...
lifeisstrange,3d5763,zzTimTVzz,6,Mon Jul 13 17:00:31 2015 UTC,"So, when Chloe gives Max her dad's old camera, that might be the reason the picture Max took of Chloe and her dad, when they were younger, resonated at the end of the episode! Max was meant to have that camera, because it embodies, not only the start of her obsession with photography, but the best and worst day of her life. Or, something supernatural to that effect... Great observation, OP!"
lifeisstrange,3d5763,HelloCringle,4,Mon Jul 13 19:18:16 2015 UTC,"Very nice theory, although i think she had a passion for photography before William died"
lifeisstrange,3d5763,DominoNo-,5,Mon Jul 13 17:31:34 2015 UTC,In Max's journal she said that she knew she wanted to be a photographer ever since she was little.

lifeisstrange,3d5763,Ara-Player,2,Mon Jul 13 19:20:16 2015 UTC,"To me, I think William's death set Max in a cold mood and is the reason why she is so introverted. My theory is since William doesn't die in the new timeline Max transformed into Victoria and hangs with her treating everyone like garbage because she was born in the town."
lifeisstrange,3d5763,DustyCupcakes,2,Mon Jul 13 17:31:24 2015 UTC,"Thats a really good theory, but kronj did bring up a good point"
lifeisstrange,3d5763,JackofScarlets,2,Mon Jul 13 21:57:53 2015 UTC,"That's not a bad idea. I wouldn't say it's the main influence, but she does take photos of... Just stuff. Nice things.

lifeisstrange,3d5763,SomethingSimsy,1 point,Tue Jul 14 11:39:08 2015 UTC,"Could be the case, like Chloe's dad acting as a trigger, but then that makes the alternate timeline situation troubling -- she is still at Blackwell Academy, presumably for photography, whilst William never died. She wouldn't have great motivation then to continue it and get a scholarship."
lifeisstrange,3d5763,vazod,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:49:25 2015 UTC,"i think this makes sense so it would also make sense that in this alternate timeline max never left arcadia to go to the art school in seatle and there's a chance that racheal never disapeard because she most likely spent less, if any, time with chloe meaning she probably never met frank and got as connected to everyone as she did"

lifeisstrange,3d4qst,solas29,2,Mon Jul 13 17:32:18 2015 UTC,Or Tuesday....tomorrow

lifeisstrange,3d4qst,lixyna,3,Mon Jul 13 17:52:34 2015 UTC,"They might have prepared everything beforehand for the episode to go live without anybody doing anything tomorrow. They tweet, Michel favorited one of my tweet this morning: it means they were working today and it might be for a good reason because in France, when there's a non-working day separated by only 1day from the WE, people usually don't work this day either.. unles there's a good reason to do so."

lifeisstrange,3d4qst,extremely_cool,3,Mon Jul 13 20:25:05 2015 UTC,I reckon the new episode won't be released for at least another week. Dontnod would have started building up the hype if it were to come out tomorrow.

lifeisstrange,3d5ohe,darthopera,11,Mon Jul 13 18:50:35 2015 UTC,"I really, really, think this is a pretty big stretch.    Blood smells.  Especially given that we're talking about blood which has been left out to rot for the better part of the day.  Max would be able to smell it instantly upon entering her room.  It's unlikely that she'd not mention the smell - or just gag and vomit - if it was actually blood.  And it's incredibly unlikely that she'd be able to stand the smell and hang out in the room for long periods of time (like shown at the start of EP3).  Further, this seems like a fairly damning action.  She may not be able to prove it was Nathan who did it (though in context it should be a fairly convincing accusation), but she'd certainly get a strong reaction if she went to one of the Blackwell teachers to say ""someone just smeared a threatening message IN BLOOD on my bedroom wall"".  Paint is bad enough, but blood?  Max doesn't even bring it up with anyone (despite having a chance to mention it to the Principal, Madsen, Jefferson, etc), she just kinda casually remarks that Samuel will have to repaint the wall.  Finally, we can check the tag's texture in the game files.  The tag in EP3 is identical to the one in EP2.  So we know, on the face of it, that it being dried blood wasn't the initial intent, nor did the artists take the time to recreate the asset (not that it would have taken any time, just reduce the ""brightness"" and ""saturation"" sliders in Photoshop).  Whatever has caused the text in EP3 to be darker appears to be in-game - the texture may have been set darker by the developers after being placed in the engine, or it may just be some (inconsistent?) effect of the night-time shaders.  I'd be surprised if it was supposed to be anything other than paint.  Plus, fresh paint tends to be more reflective than dried paint, which would be a totally valid justification for why the text may change brightness over time.   Nathan clearly spent some quality time and effort on that collage with the dead goat head.   Did he?  I dunno, it seems like a pretty quick job to me.  He just roughly cut out around a picture of Max's head, then taped it to a picture.  The thoughts about sacrificial goats is interesting though, especially given some of the fan theories about what Nathan might be up to."
lifeisstrange,3d5ohe,strangimation,2,Mon Jul 13 21:45:22 2015 UTC,Really great points you make here. Definitely starting to wonder more about these theories.
lifeisstrange,3d5ohe,Dagegen,5,Tue Jul 14 05:15:36 2015 UTC,"The paint/blood looks like it was sprayed onto the wall. If you look at the photos hanging on the wall, you see that none of them were shifted even a bit, which would be the case if someone used a brush to apply the blood/paint. In theory it would be possible to use some sort of device to spray blood, but that seems unpractical when one can simply use a brush. Therefore I assume that it's common spray-paint (or the devs didn't think about that detail)."
lifeisstrange,3d5ohe,Infamy7,2,Mon Jul 13 19:02:26 2015 UTC,"You know I was thinking about that picture too. Max's head is taped onto it which got me thinking that everything else in it is real. Could this have been taken in the Dark Room? You see the cup in the back round, the plate on the floor. Are they serving Rachel's meals with a goat head on the side to scare her into being complacent?  I wonder if Nathan's family is into some kind of weird Illuminati/Black Magic shit and that's how the family got so powerful in the first place.  The missing person's poster you find in Victoria's room has Rachel's eyes crossed out too, maybe Nathan did that one too. He seems to have a thing for eyes, I think he also drew them in his ""dark room"" drawing."
lifeisstrange,3d5ohe,Ozzytudor,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:29:54 2015 UTC,"Wow, really great points you make. Definitely gonna take some of these into account! I hadn't really thought of the picture being anything more than a collage, but you're right that it could be something sinister and real."
lifeisstrange,3d5ohe,OneJobToRuleThemAll,2,Tue Jul 14 20:19:47 2015 UTC,"No, it's not blood. If it was blood, I'm sure it would've run down the wall. And you'd smell it."
lifeisstrange,3d5ohe,sid3aff3ct,2,Tue Jul 14 00:20:08 2015 UTC,"Blood doesn't oxidize in a day when diluted with water, which you should totally do if you're intending to paint with it. Otherwise, you're going to have a sticky mess as the blood will start to coagulate while your painting.  Don't ask me why I know this..."

lifeisstrange,3d5ohe,Infamy7,2,Wed Jul 15 01:35:44 2015 UTC,You are right or atleast I think so.  A goat or a lamb is always depicted as a sacrificial animal. If that goat was real and Nathan is more distrubed as we think (Unlikely) he used blood from the goat. This could foreshadow Max sacrificing herself in EP5.   (Had to repost due to delete) Also assuming that is blood anyone remember Nathan telling us about Frank and his blood rituals for Rachel?
lifeisstrange,3d5ohe,i1ocos,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:52:24 2015 UTC,Yeah the blood oath thing was weird. It seems like Rachel made him make a serious promise or something.
lifeisstrange,3d5ohe,ArcadiaFrog,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:33:10 2015 UTC,"For me, I think the bigger deal is the fact he scratched out her eyes in the photo. Thats a real serial killer vibe."

lifeisstrange,3d45hf,TimeDimension,24,Mon Jul 13 11:13:18 2015 UTC,"I'm 100% pumped, 10/10.  I am not loosing interests in the game, I don't see how you can ;p.  But the reason I'm... pissy about it not being released yet is the fact that they aren't making any announcements about it, which makes the waiting thing.. a little different, I'm constantly checking to see if Episode 4 has been released etc... which is quite annoying.  If we'd just get a release date or an official estimate from the Devs, that would be much better."
lifeisstrange,3d45hf,Bodomi,6,Mon Jul 13 11:17:02 2015 UTC,The reason my hype went down was because I was always waiting for an announcement that wouldn't come so Im not really expecting much anymore. If they I would be 10/10 again.

lifeisstrange,3d45hf,shawnjawn,6,Mon Jul 13 14:18:01 2015 UTC,"This really reminds me of the ordeal Telltale had after it got popular. People seem to want episodic games, but not want to be patient enough to wait for the episodes to come out.  With Season 1 of ""The Walking Dead Game,"" many people didn't jump onto the bandwagon of playing it until much after the series had finished and the reviews were crazy about it.   Jump forward to when Season Two and their new title ""The Wolf Among Us"" started coming out. Many jumped the gun and bought these games, then complained to Telltale when the episodes weren't out within a month or two of another.  I personally do not mind the wait, especially if the content is of a high quality. Part of this really ties into the gaming industry selling broken games to make deadlines.   Take as much time as you need, you can perfect it all you want. I only want the episode after it's finished, and everything the developers expected it to be.  Honestly, I have to think this is a personal preference of playing games. If you're not a patient person, don't buy or play episodic games, or just wait until they fully release. I'm still 100% hyped for this episode, just as I have been with every episode."
lifeisstrange,3d45hf,creepyunturned,2,Mon Jul 13 13:56:33 2015 UTC,"I agree wholeheartedly. When I played the first season of Walking Dead, everything seemed paced just right. But then the second season came around and it seemed as though we waited longer between episodes that, IMO, seemed a bit rushed. Not to mention that The Wolf Among us came out around this time and they had to work on that game as well. Both had about 3-4 months between the first and second episode. And then I heard they had to work on another game as well, but I don't know if they are each their own entity or what not.  Life is Strange doesn't feel like a long wait between episodes to me. I don't have much time to play games (maybe 3 hours a week), so this is perfect for me. I'd rather them get it right than push it out fast and with a lot of bugs that break the game.   And don't even get me started on how long Broken Age took between the 1st and 2nd acts. I forgot about all of the characters and didn't care about them at all because of the year and three months we had to wait."
lifeisstrange,3d45hf,shawnjawn,2,Mon Jul 13 15:52:14 2015 UTC,"I know TellTale has gotten much better with management. They have the ""Game of Thrones Game"" and ""Tales from the Borderlands"" and they know exactly how to pace and the episodes are phenomenal.   It's funny, I preached season one of TWD to my friends and family, and season two I more or less just played to see how it ended. You could tell they were rushing to finish things, and it just wasn't receiving the attention it needed."
lifeisstrange,3d45hf,creepyunturned,2,Mon Jul 13 16:29:15 2015 UTC,"Having not watched Game of Thrones or played Borderlands, I thought I would be too lost on characters and plot to fully appreciate some of the references and characters. I did watch a Let's Play of Game of Thrones and it looks great though.  I really love these episodic games, and TWD S1 was an amazing introduction! I bought it for one of my friends, but he never played through it. Then in S2, I really didn't care for any of the characters, except for the protagonist, and I would probably not recommend it unless you have played the first one and want to know how the story ends, much like you said. I know some people did just jump into S2 without knowing anything about S1 and didn't care about the characters either.  TWAU was amazing and different. It was just so gorgeous. That being said, I think LiS is tied with TWAU as my favorite (at least, so far)."
lifeisstrange,3d45hf,GymKerry,2,Mon Jul 13 16:44:33 2015 UTC,"This. If I couple upvote a million times I would. I had no idea what fables were, but TWAU had me hooked from the colors and music on the title screen alone. It was just such a different atmosphere, it demanded my full attention and I happily gave it. Now I own several volumes of the comics and TWAU is probably one of my top ten games. I have to say, I still get goosebumps thinking about this fight scene."
lifeisstrange,3d45hf,EsseFen,4,Mon Jul 13 17:38:25 2015 UTC,My hype bubble is about to burst...   10/10 as of now but will drop down to 1/10 if if they don't release the episode this week.
lifeisstrange,3d45hf,BrendonPosas,2,Mon Jul 13 12:07:18 2015 UTC,"Yeah unfortunately mine is about to, too"
lifeisstrange,3d45hf,CinEther,3,Mon Jul 13 12:55:51 2015 UTC,"9/10! I'm really pumped for it, but at the same I'm kinda hesitant about it being released already because that's one step closer to the finale... and I'm not ready for this game to end yet at all."
lifeisstrange,3d45hf,ububen,1 point,Mon Jul 13 11:27:17 2015 UTC,Yeah Im kind of hesitant too. Im kind of worried how the ending(s) will turn out and if the whole community will be enraged.

I don't get why it's so hard to put a date out there, but it's been what feels like forever since the last episode came out. I would have a lot less trouble with waiting if I had a date to look forward to.  So yeah, probably a 2/10."

But being quite busy in general and not being much at my apartment (I rather travel, hang out with friends, get wasted and so on); I don't really care when it comes out since there's always other stuff to do meanwhile. I'd say I'm generally somewhere between 3-6, changes day-to-day really. I used to be a big gamer but that has changed once I turned 16 which is now 7 years ago. Never looked back tbh. The only game that keeps me hooked is Smash Bros Melee. So yeah, I am kind of excited but at the same time I wouldn't really mind waiting another month. That, however, has nothing to do with LIS being a bad game or something"

I'd have more respect and patience if they said, ""Hey we're spending some time polishing the details the game probably won't make the 8 week deadline but don't worry it's coming in a few weeks!"" Then I'd be OK, got more waiting. But when they make me check every morning feeling so hopeful an then disappointed that there is no announcement then I lose interest. I've been looking at other games to play and when I get invested in something else, my hype for Life is Strange goes down for sure. I don't know if anyone plays Dreamfall Chapters but I backed their Kickstarter and even though those episodes come out way longer than Life is Strange (3-5 months between episodes), they keep everyone really up to date on what's going on, if there's delays and why. That's the way things should be done with these type of games."

lifeisstrange,3d5oyl,GymKerry,2,Tue Jul 14 00:40:40 2015 UTC,Turn on Adaptive Vsync in Nvidia Control Panel. No need to strain your graphics card for more FPS than 60 or whatever your monitor's refresh rate is. :)
lifeisstrange,3d5oyl,Blittzzo,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:08:38 2015 UTC,"Vsync causes input lag. Not really important for this game, but for others which require high reaction time it makes a big difference."
lifeisstrange,3d5oyl,GymKerry,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:16:10 2015 UTC,So you tell me that you can notice 0.016s lag? :D  If you're talking about online games your ping is much more important than that. Besides I can't stand the screen tearing.  Also that's why I recommended Adaptive instead of regular one. If his PC cannot reach the required FPS to sync up with his monitor then vsync won't even be turned on.
lifeisstrange,3d5oyl,Blittzzo,2,Mon Jul 13 23:45:01 2015 UTC,.016s is actually a lot of time in a FPS. If you dislike screen tearing cap your framerate. If you really like vsync check out gsync and freesync.
lifeisstrange,3d5oyl,GymKerry,1 point,Tue Jul 14 10:48:12 2015 UTC,"Like you said - ""Not really important for this game""  Besides I don't have a suitable, expensive monitor that supports gsync so for me the only way to get rid of screen tearing completely is through vsync.

Judging by the blue and red blurs in the background of the first picture, I'm assuming that the scene takes place in a hall at Blackwell, probably during the Vortex Club party, because it's so dark. So... Maybe? The jacket throws me off, though, because it looks like it's brown leather, and Max wears her usual gray hoodie in the preview. Can't be Chloe, either, because her nails are blue. So I do still think it's most likely Nathan holding the gun. Could just be the lighting throwing me off, though."

lifeisstrange,3d3skc,EcoleBuissonniere,3,Mon Jul 13 12:02:06 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I doubt that it's during the Vortex Club party, just because anything involving a gun is probably gonna be a major story moment, and the teasers never show major story moments (the teaser for episode two had the train segment and episode three the escape from security at Blackwell; both were major gameplay segments, but relatively minor in terms of story)."
lifeisstrange,3d3skc,JoetotheD,4,Mon Jul 13 16:18:39 2015 UTC,I still think max gets to explore the boys dorms somehow in episode 4 and that would give her the perfect chance to take Nathan's gun from his room.

lifeisstrange,3d2zn2,Satile,2,Mon Jul 13 11:25:51 2015 UTC,http://store.steampowered.com/app/206440/ http://www.gog.com/game/to_the_moon  afaik it's PC-Only - but I would run on pretty much any PC It often goes on sale so if you can wait a bit you could probably grab it for less than 2€ during the next bigger Sale
lifeisstrange,3d2zn2,hannes3120,3,Mon Jul 13 11:34:52 2015 UTC,Personally i'd say Season 2's ending was just as good If not slightly better
lifeisstrange,3d2zn2,raspymorten,1 point,Mon Jul 13 13:34:18 2015 UTC,"I actually liked one ending from TWD S2 more. It's the one where you end up by yourself. The last scene in that game didn't choke me up, but it made me feel more emotions in one thought than anything else previously had"
lifeisstrange,3d2zn2,Maxous,1 point,Mon Jul 13 13:47:28 2015 UTC,"TWD Spoilers!!  I got that ending, too, and like you, I think it was the best one. But, when I got that ending, I could have sworn that Clem died.   My reasoning: she killed Kenny, then decided to go off on her own after what that other dirtbag admitted to her.   So she's a little girl on her own, in the freezing cold snow, during the zombie apocalypse with zero provisions!! ... All of a sudden, she's happy and walking through a lush, green field. I thought, ""Oh yeah... she died. She either starved or froze to death.""  I don't know if I was the only one who thought it, but it just seemed like such a weird transition."
lifeisstrange,3d2zn2,Satile,1 point,Mon Jul 13 21:28:28 2015 UTC,"wow, I never thought of it that way. It's definitely a possibility, although I would prefer it not to be. If TellTale did this though, they would loose a ton of money on a potential season 3. Some people might only buy the game for Clem."
lifeisstrange,3d2zn2,Maxous,1 point,Mon Jul 13 21:39:18 2015 UTC,"My favourite was the one where you kill Jane. When Kenny was literally begging you to leave him...god that made me cry, first time i've cried at a video game."

lifeisstrange,3d2zn2,wHatTheFez,2,Tue Jul 14 18:05:17 2015 UTC,"Yeah, don't worry about it :) I cried a little too.  I can barely contain my anticipation, I actually catch myself uncontrollably grinning occasionally, Can't wait for LIS episode 4"

lifeisstrange,3d2zn2,Deviantyte,13,Mon Jul 13 03:27:42 2015 UTC,Why would it be weird? Only people who buy into stereotypes say men can't cry and women can't punch.

lifeisstrange,3d2zn2,Grayson754,2,Mon Jul 13 03:13:14 2015 UTC,Hella true.
lifeisstrange,3d2zn2,Ara-Player,6,Mon Jul 13 03:28:05 2015 UTC,I actually didn't cry at the ending. I was more shocked and completely baffled by what happened.
lifeisstrange,3d2zn2,Hoonder,2,Mon Jul 13 17:39:23 2015 UTC,I had a brief moment of shock before I understood what had just happened :(  I think not kissing Chloe earlier fudged it for me...

lifeisstrange,3d2zn2,Julius74,2,Mon Jul 13 03:33:39 2015 UTC,I get you I really was expecting horrible shit to happen(huge fan of time-travel mediums) but it still was a total slap in the face 😔

Before I played through episode 3 I had listened to Kids Will Be Skeletons tons of times and I loved it.  Then after finishing episode 3 I listened to it again and I cried like baby...But, that could be because I was still an emotional wreck because of said ending :P. To this day the song makes me feel really sad and tear up at times though."
lifeisstrange,3d2zn2,Julius74,1 point,Mon Jul 13 09:15:39 2015 UTC,"It really is a sad song, kinda depressing to be honest :/"
lifeisstrange,3d2zn2,Julius74,1 point,Mon Jul 13 12:23:49 2015 UTC,"Well if it is then I guess I am weird too! I am so emotionally involved and obsessed with this game! I can just barley manage to hide my addiction from my friends and family. They know I REALLY like it but if they knew to what extent they would probably send me to an insane asylum. I have turned every item I have to something Life is Strange related. Wallpapers, Millions of sketches, my phone text theme and ringtone is Max's, etc. My family is getting suspicious of why I have been drawing this girl smoking all the time. I wish there was someone as obsessed as me irl so I can hang out and obsess with them haha. I guess you guys/girls are real but I mean in person. But you guys are so awesome and have helped me cope so much. Idk what I would do without all of you."

lifeisstrange,3d4b31,FilmingMachine,10,Mon Jul 13 12:19:44 2015 UTC,"simple reason: they didn't want to promote their game with the graphic content of their game, instead they went with some pretty sick concept art, which worked."
lifeisstrange,3d4b31,RiskyR,1 point,Mon Jul 13 12:41:08 2015 UTC,Heh... I kinda agree but the reason me and my 3 friends bought the game was because of the first 20 minutes gameplay on YouTube. I just felt like it doesnt look like max :)
lifeisstrange,3d4b31,RiskyR,4,Mon Jul 13 12:53:42 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I purchasd the game because it looked alot like Walking Dead seas1/2 and I friggin LOVED THOSE GAMES goddamnit.  So yeah, I just had to buy one that looked like it went through a teenagers life, because it's so relevent in some parts."
lifeisstrange,3d4b31,RiskyR,2,Mon Jul 13 13:14:32 2015 UTC,Played both seasons :) Curious here: Compared to LiS do you think TWD is better?
lifeisstrange,3d4b31,HelloCringle,2,Mon Jul 13 13:19:56 2015 UTC,"The reason I liked TWD was because of what it did and how it told the characters.  It wouldn't be right to say that TWD is better or that LiS is better because one has had the chance to finish and the other is still telling its story.  I honestly do like the time travel thing.  It's basically an interesting gimmick which TWD didnt have which allows you to make choices based on the outcomes, and not how you feel.  Then again I really liked the aspect of not knowing what was going to happen, the fact you were always in danger and felt like you had to make these decisions in a matter of moments (some were timed)  so it added some urgency.  Without saying one is better than the other, I can at least let you know that TWD 1 and 2 both had me in tears at the end.  second season more than the first.  We'll just see how LiS plays out :)"
lifeisstrange,3d4b31,DuckOfDuckness,2,Mon Jul 13 15:33:04 2015 UTC,"Well, atleast we can judge by the mechanics of the game, the engine, if it is graphically pleasant, the characters, etc... Even though I believe both games are great, I prefer Life is Strange over any telltales game (even though I love Tales from the Borlderlands)"
lifeisstrange,3d4b31,DuckOfDuckness,5,Mon Jul 13 15:37:01 2015 UTC,"I really like what you did with paint and i agree i do prefer the in game model to the concept art, but it isn't that bad  oh and flair!:)"

lifeisstrange,3d4b31,zeroneraven,3,Mon Jul 13 16:16:18 2015 UTC,"Personally, I love that image. Seriously, I would never want it gone. It does not, however, look at all like Max, which is kinda weird. Still, it's ridiculously cool, so I let it slide."
lifeisstrange,3d4b31,Ozzytudor,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:14:17 2015 UTC,Agree with everything you said sir. Do you think it is a good image to represent the game?
lifeisstrange,3d4b31,BostonTentacleParty,3,Mon Jul 13 16:21:24 2015 UTC,"Honestly, yeah. It prominently shows the main character, it's beautiful artwork, it shows her in the middle of using her powers, and everything from the distortion on her hand to the colours used to the expression on her face really hammers home the sort of mystery that the title ""Life is Strange"" implies to me."
lifeisstrange,3d5x51,macstanislaus,9,Mon Jul 13 19:50:07 2015 UTC,"They also said this for episode 5 ""September 8-15st"" Really? 15st? Seems trustworthy..."

lifeisstrange,3d5x51,RasereiHojo,3,Tue Jul 14 04:31:45 2015 UTC,"That website. Ahahah I remember they did the same with both The Walking Dead and The Wolf Among Us, all they do is write down speculation till they have an official announcement. And with Telltale's... uhm... Unpredictability in release dates, they never got them right. I'd say we wait for notifications on Twitter like they probably are :)"
lifeisstrange,3d2a0j,chattypenguin,44,Sun Jul 12 23:09:56 2015 UTC,"Like someone said before, I think what's really making this wait hard is not having a release date. I don't care if it's delayed a bit, but it's driving me insane not having any idea when it's coming, checking twitter and this sub every day for updates. I can only imagine how bad the episode 5 wait will be..."
lifeisstrange,3d2a0j,max_caulfield_,8,Sun Jul 12 23:30:29 2015 UTC,"Max says it as it is - as always ;)  Even if they said it was out in two weeks, it would be probably be better than waiting another week before it even gets announced.  Please Dontnod, look at how much pain and suffering you're putting us through! Not to mention the pain and suffering I imagine we'll have while playing it!"

lifeisstrange,3d1nxn,HelloCringle,12,Sun Jul 12 20:09:21 2015 UTC,"Great post!  One thing though, Max made that scratch on Nathan's face in Episode One, about 20 seconds after the picture there."
lifeisstrange,3d1nxn,levir,2,Sun Jul 12 20:59:15 2015 UTC,"Ah you're correct can't believe i missed it lol, thanks"
lifeisstrange,3d1nxn,Ilan321,6,Sun Jul 12 21:58:55 2015 UTC,Did anyone notice the doe is invisible on the photo you take of it?
lifeisstrange,3d1nxn,JoetotheD,6,Sun Jul 12 21:50:58 2015 UTC,"That freaked me out when I first went to check it, also if you save the bird in episode 1 and take a picture in Chloe's bathroom in episode 3 the bird doesn't show up in the photo. Which leads me to the question of why Chloe still appears in photos.."
lifeisstrange,3d1nxn,978am,3,Sun Jul 12 22:18:20 2015 UTC,"Now that is interesting. They spelled out the ""spirit animal"" thingy for us, so I guess that's where the interpretation should start. Rachel has that blue feather in her ear... If they doe symbolizes Max and the bird Rachel, that means they're both messing with time...."
lifeisstrange,3d1nxn,Bond4141,2,Sun Jul 12 22:32:07 2015 UTC,"Wait, does that mean not saving the bird kills Rachel?"
lifeisstrange,3d1nxn,spacey_stacy,2,Mon Jul 13 03:59:17 2015 UTC,... And is that why it says you'll have consequences for saving it?
lifeisstrange,3d1nxn,Bond4141,2,Mon Jul 13 04:20:45 2015 UTC,Jesus. Imagine if that small detail is what affects the ending.   It's so fucking stupid but so fucking smart at the same time I don't know if I want to laugh or cry.
lifeisstrange,3d1nxn,spacey_stacy,2,Mon Jul 13 04:22:44 2015 UTC,What if the final decision is having to save Chloe or Rachel?  Or perhaps sacrificing yourself to save Rachel...?  I'm gonna drive myself crazy. Episode 4 needs to hurry up.
lifeisstrange,3d1nxn,Bond4141,3,Mon Jul 13 04:26:46 2015 UTC,"....  I like that idea, but I hate it.   Go pricefield, Chloe may hate you, but you have her.   Kill Chloe, you now have Rachel, more or less a stranger to you.   Kill Max, Chloe will probably regret, and push Rachel away.   Can't we just have a happy ending for once? Like, how many games have happy endings? Seriously..."
lifeisstrange,3d1nxn,Cptcutter81,1 point,Mon Jul 13 04:43:23 2015 UTC,"As someone who could take or leave Chloe, this ending sounds like a really good one personally. They said there are going to be multiple, so I guess there'll be an ending for almost everyone."
lifeisstrange,3d1nxn,rrainmaker,2,Mon Jul 13 11:43:10 2015 UTC,"So do Max and Alyssa I don't think Chloe is relevant, the doe and the bird might be special though."
lifeisstrange,3d1nxn,grossglockner,1 point,Sun Jul 12 23:02:48 2015 UTC,I think it's just an oversight. I guess they only have one pre-rendered picture for each photo you take.
lifeisstrange,3d1nxn,nikola_mihaylov,5,Mon Jul 13 08:08:21 2015 UTC,Thanks for taking your time to post these!
lifeisstrange,3d1nxn,LilianH,4,Sun Jul 12 21:01:49 2015 UTC,"You can also review much of this in game via the journal. It saves copies of notes, letters, posters, etc that you investigate while playing the game."
lifeisstrange,3d1nxn,lislislislislis,6,Sun Jul 12 21:57:54 2015 UTC,It's a nice touch that Warren pretends to buy an extra ticket just for Max even though the tickets are per-car.
lifeisstrange,3d1nxn,poho,3,Sun Jul 12 23:45:47 2015 UTC,"Loads of information here, thanks so much for collating it!"
lifeisstrange,3d1nxn,dreamfall99,3,Sun Jul 12 21:00:21 2015 UTC,I never knew that Max couldn't rewind the Doe. Also - I thought Chloe's parking lot graffiti might have been where someone spray painted over RESERVED to say RETARDED. I thought that would be another foreshadowing of her becoming handicapped.
lifeisstrange,3d1nxn,Romanruler,2,Sun Jul 12 23:23:03 2015 UTC,"i think you might be right, i added it to op"
lifeisstrange,3d1nxn,smackjack,3,Sun Jul 12 23:39:33 2015 UTC,"Is it possible to make out what the end of Rachel's first letter says? The paragraph that she scribbled out? I think I can make out some words like ""it"", ""the"", and ""continuously"" but that's all I can make out."
lifeisstrange,3d1nxn,HoloKK,2,Mon Jul 13 02:07:08 2015 UTC,"In addition to the doe not rewinding or showing up in pictures, the bluejay that you can save in episode 1 shows up in episode 3, but it won't appear in the picture that you can take in the bathroom"
lifeisstrange,3d1nxn,Romanruler,2,Mon Jul 13 00:12:36 2015 UTC,"Thanks. I haven't read this the day I've played since I was in a bit of a hurry and also, I want to play it entirely before starting all over in a new save."
lifeisstrange,3d3ld0,ItsCentri,4,Mon Jul 13 06:29:19 2015 UTC,I think Chloe will be back to normal in Ep 4. They will be resolved fairly quickly (within the first 3rd of Ep 4).
lifeisstrange,3d3ld0,LilianH,3,Mon Jul 13 06:40:49 2015 UTC,"I don't think the title is related to being paralyzed. I think the title just expresses that Max will have to do some serious choices, that could almost be polarities (opposites) to each other.  We don't have too big hints about it, so the choices might be even related to the possibly paralyzed Chloe (she had a pipe for breathing and hands strapped to the wheelchair), but personally I believe we'll return to the original timeline fairly soon."
lifeisstrange,3d3ld0,Darkchef,2,Mon Jul 13 06:44:34 2015 UTC,Maybe it's like in twin peaks where an evil doppelganger gets created that's the polar opposite of Max that brings the destruction to the town.
lifeisstrange,3d3ld0,koyl,2,Mon Jul 13 12:07:37 2015 UTC,"I think it has something to do with + & -. The return to balance between good and evil ? With Chloe becoming less ""rebel"" but more happy and Max becoming bolder, less shy and more sure of here decisions ?  Also, let's not forget Samuel's words about Rachel Amber: ""she's like a battery, both positive & negative"""

lifeisstrange,3d2sff,azarusx,7,Mon Jul 13 01:49:56 2015 UTC,"It's worth noting that DontNod have said that episodes would be released in 6-8 week periods. If they haven't released Ep4 by the 14th we'll no longer have a basis for estimation (at least for Ep4). Maybe they'll do a press release extending the time between releases to 10-12 weeks or 12-14 weeks. Little sad that we might be meeting a delay but as Telltale has shown us, episodic games are incredibly difficult to release in a reliable and consistent amount of time.  I do feel bad for DontNod though. This style of release has to be more stressful than traditional releases."
lifeisstrange,3d2sff,Ciahcfari,3,Mon Jul 13 02:42:26 2015 UTC,"I think Dontnod's had rough releases all around. Remember Me changed publishers (possibly twice?), and by all accounts sounds like a lot of effort went into last minute changes for a product that didn't do very well. :(  I think Dontnod was eventually unable to stay ahead of their workload. Episode 4 was probably somewhere between 15-50% complete back in January. In the nearly six months since then, Dontnod polished off Episode 2 (which was 85% done in January), finished Episode 3, and have probably been rushing to get Episodes 4 and 5 in working condition. They had a head start for the first few episodes that I'm guessing they've lost by now.   Source for progress: interview they gave around the time of Episode 1's release, which I'll look for later."
lifeisstrange,3d2sff,cthulhulegobrick,3,Mon Jul 13 09:08:04 2015 UTC,I just hope they don't try to rush any releases. I'm willing to wait an extra 4 weeks for that much better of a game.
lifeisstrange,3d2sff,Maxous,1 point,Mon Jul 13 21:31:26 2015 UTC,Same here!
lifeisstrange,3d2sff,Modest_Badger,2,Tue Jul 14 00:25:55 2015 UTC,Meanwhile on Kentucky Route Zero :P
lifeisstrange,3d2sff,Ciahcfari,3,Mon Jul 13 09:23:21 2015 UTC,"Stressful for the studio, but more stressful for the players. I've never been a fan of a story this much. I thought this game is a poop at first. But here i am. Can't wait to see the next one! :-) Thanks for the info!"
lifeisstrange,3d2sff,EzioSC5,2,Mon Jul 13 04:16:12 2015 UTC,"No prob. It's mostly just speculation though, DontNod are weirdly vague about exact releases for LiS episodes for some reason so it wouldn't surprise me too much if we see the Ep4 launch trailer on the 14th and the actual episode release on the 15th."
lifeisstrange,3d2sff,wHatTheFez,2,Mon Jul 13 04:32:32 2015 UTC,"Probably not tomorrow, because it's Bastille Day in France, where Dontnod is based. Likely next Tuesday, or possibly later this week, but no one knows right now."

lifeisstrange,3d0vmz,HelloCringle,14,Sun Jul 12 16:14:03 2015 UTC,"The episode must start at alternate Chloe's house, which means we'll presumably get to explore it and note the differences between the timelines. Then we'll have a chat with Chloe and find out her state of mind. Max will probe her for information.   Will Max tell Chloe about her powers and what she did? I don't think it'd be a good idea. In fact, I think the more Max talks to Wiliam and Chloe, the more they become real for Max and the audience, and the harder it'll be for the player to wipe them from existence.   Narratively, there will have to be a deciding factor that comes on the side of returning the status quo. Some examples I can think of include:     Chloe has brain damage, a drastically shortened lifespan, or similar Joyce is dead Max tells William and he decides for her   Then, as you say, we are likely to return to the original timeline for the End of the World party. Before that happens, one thing I'd like is the ability to explore alternate Blackwell, maybe talk to the Vortex Club and find out information to which Max wouldn't normally be privy."
lifeisstrange,3d0vmz,KaiG1987,1 point,Sun Jul 12 16:25:31 2015 UTC,Awh. That would be so heart breaking to see William deciding for Max. He seems like the type of guy to put Chloe over himself.
lifeisstrange,3d0vmz,Ozzytudor,9,Tue Jul 14 18:22:54 2015 UTC,"I think Alternate Chloe will be even more scientifically minded than Original Chloe and will help Max understand what she's done and what she should do next.  Maybe we'll get to play as Chloe for a bit in the original timeline. Not very likely but it could be cool. I suspect for various reasons that Max and Chloe may not be together much this episode, or at least will not resolve their differences immediately.  Either way, I think Max does end up back in her original timeline. And she may have to patch things up, perhaps using her Wednesday morning selfie to do the day over. Orrr Chloe might have just taken off out of town and Max will be dealing with that. Storywise, it will build a lot of tension if their reconciliation has to wait, so I think that may be likely.  The party happens and whatever is meant to happen there. I believe that in playthroughs where Max isn't on the list, she'll still end up gaining access some other way. I think it'll shed a big light on the mystery (someone else gets drugged while Max is there maybe? Or Max herself, as there's some indication she was the next target). Though we really have no idea exactly what will happen there.  Finally, I think we will find Rachel by the end of the episode, but it will not be what people generally expect and will set up the final episode. And, again, it would build tension if Max ""solves"" the mystery of Rachel without Chloe around, particularly if Max uncovers information that Chloe should know."
lifeisstrange,3d0vmz,kronj,3,Sun Jul 12 16:36:27 2015 UTC,I like the idea that Alternate Chloe will help unravel the whole thing...and maybe leave the player/Max with the knowledge that Alternate Chloe's help will potentially erase Alternate Chloe from existence. That'll twist the knife a bit. Oof.
lifeisstrange,3d0vmz,poho,10,Sun Jul 12 20:40:11 2015 UTC,"At the E3 press they said ""The player will be really surprised."" So I cant wait."
lifeisstrange,3d0vmz,zeroneraven,9,Sun Jul 12 21:20:00 2015 UTC,"I'm really, really curious to see what stealing the funds will lead to. I personally took the money because I 100% ship Pricefield and wanted Max's face on Chloe's phone, but I don't really see how else it may contribute to anything else. Maybe it will neutralize Frank if you took the choice to shoot him, or possibly kinda he's on 'your side' if you didn't.   I dunno. I've never been good with theories."
lifeisstrange,3d0vmz,RakishiM,12,Sun Jul 12 17:15:09 2015 UTC,"I personally believe, like the OP, that it's actually a bribe rather than a legitimate handicapped fund. it also serves as foreshadowing for what happens to Chloe.  As for its effect, who knows. I have a vague suspicion that Max's relationship with everyone is being tracked (we know for sure that it is with Chloe) and that it will matter at the end. Perhaps in convincing people to evacuate ahead of the storm? So in that case it really could matter how happy Frank is with you, if you want to save as many people as possible. An ideal playthrough, then, would be one where you balance everyone's desires and keep them all at least somewhat happy with you, but I'm not sure that's possible. Just a random idea."
lifeisstrange,3d0vmz,kronj,3,Sun Jul 12 17:43:09 2015 UTC,whoa you could be right! good idea (:
lifeisstrange,3d0vmz,jarod467,2,Sun Jul 12 18:02:31 2015 UTC,"You know what, that's a great idea. I wouldn't be at all surprised. So far we've had several opportunities to improve Max's relations with people."
lifeisstrange,3d0vmz,KaiG1987,3,Sun Jul 12 20:32:01 2015 UTC,"If $5000 goes missing, it will be noticed. Right now Blackwell's security knows that somebody was breaking curfew and broke into the gym. They don't know that anyone was in the principal's office, but if the door is unlocked and the money is gone, they'd probably connect the dots.  Except somebody pointed out that Max left the pipe bomb materials in the principal's trash can."
lifeisstrange,3d0vmz,lislislislislis,3,Sun Jul 12 23:42:24 2015 UTC,I thought the pipe bomb technically never existed anymore because Max reminded time and appeared inside the principal's office?
lifeisstrange,3d0vmz,RakishiM,4,Mon Jul 13 01:03:46 2015 UTC,"The pipe bomb didn't, but the ingredients do, since Max keeps her inventory through time travel. They're all dumped very obviously in a trash can next to that side table where you find Kate's file."
lifeisstrange,3d0vmz,kronj,5,Mon Jul 13 01:27:22 2015 UTC,"I think Episode 4 has something to do with Mr Jefferson, one of the lines that creeps me out the most was one that I never noticed on the first episode that if you don't take a selfie (which you don't have to it will still progress) he will say ""I could frame any one of you in a dark corner, and capture you in a moment of desperation"" Its not much but its giving me a really big hunch Edit: And you can actually see Pompidou's corpse run over if you choose that option in the far away distance which is really fucked up"
lifeisstrange,3d0vmz,shockwavebomb,3,Sun Jul 12 22:04:24 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I feel like the title ""Dark Room,"" Rachel, and Jefferson are all connected--and not in a good way. So fingers crossed for some kind of payoff by the end of Ep. 4!"
lifeisstrange,3d0vmz,Agent_Alpha,3,Sun Jul 12 22:26:00 2015 UTC,And you can actually see Pompidou's corpse run over if you choose that option in the far away distance which is really fucked up   D:
lifeisstrange,3d0vmz,Bond4141,4,Mon Jul 13 04:16:13 2015 UTC,"I would guess we start at alternate Chloe's house, find out general info about that timeline, figure out how to get back to the other timeline and then meet up with the other Chloe to tell her what happened. After that, deal with frank, the fallout from the ""break ins"" at the school, then vortex party where we learn most of the truth behind Rachel Amber and Kate. I'm also hoping we get a chance to explore the boys dorms, would be interesting to see what warren and Nathan's room have hiding in them."
lifeisstrange,3d0vmz,JoetotheD,3,Sun Jul 12 22:01:54 2015 UTC,"Since the preview pictures for EP4 haven't been mentioned yet:  I'm pretty sure the arm that's holding the gun is Nathan's (same gun as bathroom scene in EP1), so there is a confrontation with him and another character.  There is a picture of the beach with what looks like Chloe's truck parked there, so Max & Chloe end up at the beach for whatever reason. Maybe another heart to heart.  Last, there is a picture of a laptop. We went through a lot of laptops in the game already, so I doubt they would make the teaser pic of one we have gone through before. So Max is snooping on someone new, I'm betting either Nathan or Jefferson."
lifeisstrange,3d0vmz,aaanaab,3,Sun Jul 12 23:32:53 2015 UTC,Yes Nathan's hand. Not Chole's truck. The laptop is David's in the garage.
lifeisstrange,3d0vmz,JordanInHealdsburg,5,Mon Jul 13 04:10:15 2015 UTC,"Did you sign the petition   this actually has been resolved, depending on your choice you can find a letter to David in the principles office saying he's either accepted or declined David's proposal to install cameras.  It might have some further effect in episode 4 or 5, like you a secruirty camera might record something important, or David blames Max for signing the petition, but regardless the choice has had an outcome already."
lifeisstrange,3d0vmz,SkateboardCop,2,Sun Jul 12 23:43:19 2015 UTC,"Sorry yes I'm aware of that, I think there may be something more to it though, like you said, it may miss something important if the cameras aren't there"
lifeisstrange,3d0vmz,SkateboardCop,2,Mon Jul 13 00:34:54 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't be surprised if the cameras come into play, I'm more interested in how seriously they'll feature in future episodes."
lifeisstrange,3d0vmz,Marty36,3,Mon Jul 13 01:43:09 2015 UTC,"Good listing. How will the outcome change if you let Kate die?, or found the way to save her?"
lifeisstrange,3d0vmz,JoetotheD,4,Sun Jul 12 22:02:54 2015 UTC,It would be interesting if they make Kate alive in the alternate timeline if she died in the original and vice versa. So if you let her die you may be able to find out things from her in the alternate timeline she didn't tell you before.
lifeisstrange,3d0vmz,DuKoninck,3,Sun Jul 12 22:06:44 2015 UTC,You will meet Rachel at the Vortex Club party.

lifeisstrange,3d1wbk,imjeans,7,Sun Jul 12 21:19:01 2015 UTC,"I shot, then Max was like ""oh now he's even more dangerous"" then I went back, didn't shoot and he took the gun so I decided to go with shoot because a junkie drug dealer you owe money to with a gun is not good"
lifeisstrange,3d1wbk,WakaIsMyWaifu,6,Sun Jul 12 23:09:09 2015 UTC,"This is the decision that most seems to highlight what a unique mechanic the rewind power is for a game like this. Decisions in choice-driven adventure games are often based on meta-knowledge that the player has. What people tend to forget is that, as a time traveler, Max often has exactly the same meta-knowledge.  When I first saw the choice, my impulse was to not shoot Frank. But I also had the free opportunity to see what would happen if I did, so I chose to shoot first. Once I saw that he came to no harm, and that the other choice resulted in Chloe losing the gun, I chose to stick with attempting to shoot him. In any other game, doing all this would require a couple save-and-reloads.  But LiS does not have such a confining narrative. Max, rather uniquely, is in the same position that I am. She also has the opportunity to see what happens with both possibilities, and she can also use meta-knowledge -- she makes the decision knowing that Frank is unharmed either way, but that one choice results in Chloe losing the gun. So Max ""shooting"" Frank in that situation doesn't actually make her murderous or violent, and I don't see it as inconsistent with her character."
lifeisstrange,3d1wbk,kronj,2,Sun Jul 12 23:25:00 2015 UTC,but you can get ur gun later in his RV..so why shoot Frank anyway?
lifeisstrange,3d1wbk,kronj,6,Mon Jul 13 05:37:10 2015 UTC,Because I measure my success in Chloe hugs.
lifeisstrange,3d1wbk,kronj,3,Mon Jul 13 05:49:03 2015 UTC,i somehow feel that siding with Chloe in every situation seems dangerous. I mean you will make Chloe happy but there will be probably horrible consequences for that
lifeisstrange,3d1wbk,978am,3,Mon Jul 13 05:56:53 2015 UTC,"You're not wrong. The moral ""right"" choices seem to be directly opposed to the choices that make Chloe happy, quite consistently, and I'm sure some sort of karma will come around by the end. But without knowing what the long term consequences are, I decided to just go pro-Chloe and see what happens. And at some point I'll do a Moral Max playthrough and see what happens there too."
lifeisstrange,3d1wbk,ward0630,2,Mon Jul 13 06:06:43 2015 UTC,..and especially we see a preview that sb is gonna be shot in ep4.
lifeisstrange,3d1wbk,SinfulBaggins,4,Mon Jul 13 05:58:33 2015 UTC,"I think they have left us with no clue whatsoever of figuring out the right thing to do here. I couldn't get myself to shoot Frank either, but that's me behind a computer, not the 18 year old girl who feared for her life and the life of her best friend.  Max says she's worried about Chloe with a gun, so that's the only kind of hint I've picked up, and because of that I acted on it and did not return the gun to Chloe. I am still worried about protection if we end up in a really dangerous situation though, which might happen when the stakes are raised. In real life I would not have kept the gun either, but that's because I don't anticipate any kind of threat similar to what Max might worry about now."
lifeisstrange,3d1wbk,rrainmaker,4,Sun Jul 12 22:37:17 2015 UTC,"Yeah, because it's basically consequence-free and you get points with Chloe. Frank's already a pretty whacked out guy, I don't think trying to shoot him will actually make him more angry (tbh he seemed way more pissed when I knocked over his beans)."
lifeisstrange,3d1wbk,KaiG1987,10,Mon Jul 13 01:29:33 2015 UTC,but shooting knowing there's no bullet just makes you look like a badass in front of chloe.
lifeisstrange,3d1wbk,TheBusinessCat,5,Sun Jul 12 21:28:01 2015 UTC,Yeah badass but not the kind of badassary Max would do. That's why I didn't shoot Frank.
lifeisstrange,3d1wbk,ulpisen,6,Sun Jul 12 22:27:03 2015 UTC,"I feel the same, but... I needed Chloe to put Max's picture on her phone, dammit!  Stupid metagaming."

I didn't want to shoot him personally, and I didn't think Max would have done it either. BUT, the dude is obviously not ok in the head. Sure Chloe got a little dramatic but I didn't think the situation required Frank to pull a knife out on her. So I'm thinking that if I don't shoot, he'll either carve up Chloe and Max, or take the gun and shoot them anyway.

lifeisstrange,3d1wbk,vazod,3,Sun Jul 12 23:07:36 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I shot him because it's what Chloe wants me to do. I do practically everything for Chloe. Though I did answer Kate's call... I feel like both options are in character for Max so either choice works. But yeah, the gun will definitely come into play again later on as it's a major choice."
lifeisstrange,3d1wbk,vazod,2,Mon Jul 13 04:22:57 2015 UTC,"Well, considering Max had the knowledge through her rewind powers, she knew there wasn't a bullet in the gun.

Maybe she was interested in how her life would have been, if she had not had her accident and thereby discovered the 'original' timeline. She felt sorry for blue haired Chloe, created Rachel and somehow sent her over. Maybe William even helped her.

Like, aside from her Jax (robot-panda keychain), she never shows any kind of knowledge, or even interest, towards androids, or even robotic technology more generally. Her environment and behavior also shows a more artistic than scientific personality. LiS is absolutely not sci-fi. Rachel wouldn’t have parents (unless Chloe created them too ?!!!!???)

Kate is shown to have lost some aspect of faith, saying she doesn't believe in miracles, and god put her on the roof. David sure didn't help, but he wasn't the one who harassed her to the point of suicide, it was more of a number of factors."

lifeisstrange,3cza8c,bluewolf37,4,Sun Jul 12 05:29:57 2015 UTC,They would have to cast unknowns as the teen characters because all the ones here are mid to late 20's adults. They are beautiful people but there is a big difference between 17-19 year old teens and there is a big difference in looks between those ages. So unless they are doing the characters collage years they would lol out of place in high school. I would also want Max and Chloe to look and sound closer to the game characters.

lifeisstrange,3cza8c,Rynnline,3,Mon Jul 13 04:58:21 2015 UTC,I can't imagine any actress as Max. And Ellen Page? No.
lifeisstrange,3cza8c,eridactylsaurus,2,Sun Jul 12 08:09:51 2015 UTC,"Eh, I'm not big on Ellen Page as Max, or whatsherface as Juliet. Jemima West would make an awesome Juliet.. and maybe Georgie Henley as Max?   Kristen Stewart as Chloe would also not be my first (or second, or third) choice, but I can't think of anyone who could fit the bill, appearance wise."
lifeisstrange,3cza8c,ashrensnow,3,Sun Jul 12 07:21:47 2015 UTC,I'd say this is a perfect cast with the exception of Kristen Stewart.
lifeisstrange,3cza8c,978am,1 point,Sun Jul 12 05:33:25 2015 UTC,"Those are overall very good fits. Except Kristen Stewart, who I don't think looks like Chloe at all. She's a great actress however, so I'm definitely not jumping on any hate train here."

lifeisstrange,3d0fp4,Big_G_Dog,7,Sun Jul 12 16:00:55 2015 UTC,"""NSFW"" is a kinda useless concept anyhow. It would be better to have a more granular tag-based concept, like ""Nudity"", ""Sexual (not graphic)"", ""Porn"", ""Gore"", ""1 square inch of skin that's tagged for no particular reason"".

lifeisstrange,3cxw2s,jpae20,5,Sun Jul 12 01:37:04 2015 UTC,If only I had known before she fell down ;(
lifeisstrange,3cxw2s,acyort,2,Sat Jul 11 23:11:01 2015 UTC,I had her die and changed it back and forth like ten times because I felt guilty about letting her die but also about kinda cheating.....so i just deleted the playthrough and started over.
lifeisstrange,3cxw2s,Ozzytudor,3,Sun Jul 12 01:32:46 2015 UTC,"Damn I kept it as oure as I could, now my main walkthrough involves a death of Kate :("
lifeisstrange,3cxw2s,howardtheduckdoe,19,Sun Jul 12 02:13:01 2015 UTC,I'm so glad I was able to save her. I wonder how many people replayed just to save her after failing
lifeisstrange,3cxw2s,DuckOfDuckness,10,Sat Jul 11 22:04:44 2015 UTC,A lot of people! When I was finished on my run on my PS4 the stats showed 64% couldnt save her that was 14hours. After release when I came back a week later it was 60% that saved her.. goes to show how many that actually failed 😏
lifeisstrange,3cxw2s,Sebehr,7,Sat Jul 11 22:08:11 2015 UTC,"I played Episode 2 the very next minute after the PC release. When I was done (managed to save her out of sheer luck, but besides the point), the stats were like 10% saved 90% dies. By the end of the day it was around 40% saved, and the stat kept climbing.   People were actively replaying the game en masse in order to save her, that much was obvious, and not just from watching the stats evolve, reading comments and reddit posts made it perfectly clear.   It felt good to watch so many people say as one, ""Screw you and your no-rewind rules, this girl lives""."
lifeisstrange,3cxw2s,jessebona,3,Sun Jul 12 01:28:02 2015 UTC,"Haha yeah, I wanted my save to be a pure run based on my mistakes and actions."
lifeisstrange,3cxw2s,_xT1ger_,1 point,Sun Jul 12 02:12:30 2015 UTC,"I believe that it was climbing because the people who save Kate were the ones that explore everything, thus having to make more hours to finish the episode"

lifeisstrange,3cxw2s,dustinquickfire,5,Sun Jul 12 21:56:45 2015 UTC,I was fortunate enough to save her...kinda/ the first play she died but my game froze during the auto save screen immediately after and it never saved. Basically I had a chance to do it again without starting the chapter over lol
lifeisstrange,3cxw2s,kgoleon,1 point,Sun Jul 12 02:35:12 2015 UTC,Most of the reason I saved Kate is because I sided with her nearly all of the time.
lifeisstrange,3cxw2s,Akilice,5,Tue Jul 14 19:16:43 2015 UTC,I know! I was surprised at how many failed. Anyone know the conditions of failure? Was it due to past interactions or simply the conversational choices you chose when trying to save her?
lifeisstrange,3cxw2s,wHatTheFez,5,Sat Jul 11 22:15:59 2015 UTC,"It's purely the roof conversation. Even if you've been a bitch to Kate throughout the game you can still save her by selecting the correct dialogue options.  You are allowed 1 wrong answer, after which Kate takes a step backwards. If you then answer wrongly again she will jump.  Caring about Kate beforehand does make it easier for you know which answers are the right ones, but you can still do it anyway (by luck or looking up the right answers (cheater))."
lifeisstrange,3cxw2s,RasereiHojo,6,Sun Jul 12 08:11:13 2015 UTC,"The conversational choices are the big thing that affect it. However being nice to her (ie picking up her call, telling her to go to the police, etc) are major points in your favor. Every positive action counts in your favor."
lifeisstrange,3cxw2s,AERXihu,3,Sat Jul 11 22:52:56 2015 UTC,In my mind I waa stupid enough to choose her mom even though she was a biatch to her. Do not ask me why

lifeisstrange,3cz9i8,SinfulBaggins,5,Sun Jul 12 03:40:13 2015 UTC,My pet peeve is the Look/touch/see action prompts sometimes being evasive and dependent on camera angle.

lifeisstrange,3cz9i8,RasereiHojo,5,Sun Jul 12 07:00:17 2015 UTC,"I don't know if this is what you mean, but the dialogue in LiS seems to be hit or miss. Like, critical hit or critical miss. Similarly the voice direction doesn't always seem on point; voice actors occasionally put emphasis on words that don't make sense, or say things that would be omitted from a real conversation. Talk to Brooke at the beginning of EP2 for an example."

lifeisstrange,3cz9i8,zqwefty,1 point,Mon Jul 13 01:13:14 2015 UTC,"Eh, I dunno, I feel like the usage of strange slang sort of fits in how the developers have sort of dropped the ball with dialogue here and there, especially with Max. She'll be freaking out about something, and then drop some bit of slang in there that makes the dialogue sound waaaay more casual than it should be."
lifeisstrange,3cz9i8,Ceannairceach,2,Mon Jul 13 01:43:05 2015 UTC,What bugs me the most is that it's episodic so we still have to wait a month or two to find out what happens at the end.
lifeisstrange,3cz9i8,XMenOrangesTangerine,2,Sun Jul 12 13:57:47 2015 UTC,my pet peeve is that occasionally when max is talking to others she doesn't always look at them and she tends to look away just kinda weird to me
lifeisstrange,3cz9i8,vazod,8,Sun Jul 12 17:42:24 2015 UTC,That's not strange at all. That's just how socially awkward people react while talking. And Max is described as socially awkward.

Like looking at titles in the bookcase or a dvd collection, watching posters and stuff. It's like dogs sniffing each other's butt, it's what we human beings do instead.  There's a limit though (you don't open drawers for instance), and at the sniffing game Max is indeed a bit nosey, and everyone knows that."

Beyond the aesthetics, though, I do wish that there were more relational consequences stemming from whether you rewinded after snooping about, and that the rewind mechanic were slightly more precise in its workings (especially in longer cutscenes-- sometimes I wish we could ""scrub"" back through a timeline)."
lifeisstrange,3cz9i8,Rirere,1 point,Sun Jul 12 15:30:10 2015 UTC,That I can't skip dialog until I rewind and would see it again. Not a big deal the first time I played but mildly annoying on my second game and when restarting from a scene.
lifeisstrange,3cz9i8,thatfool,1 point,Sun Jul 12 18:06:21 2015 UTC,"My own theory for no one noticing Max's teleporting is that whatever her power even IS is also correcting everyone's memory so that Max being there suddenly isn't weird. Of course, this has a contradicton, since Chloe noticed that she wan in Principal Wells' office. But maybe since Chloe is aware of her power, Chloe is also aware of her ""teleporting""."

lifeisstrange,3cz9i8,mad0racle,8,Sun Jul 12 10:48:41 2015 UTC,"That's an eminently practical one, though, and basically comes down to the limitations of branched storylines.  The parallel construction they would have had to do to allow Chloe to die up front is nuts."

lifeisstrange,3cyml6,ramahlive,3,Fri Jul 17 00:58:38 2015 UTC,You know we're running out of ideas and topics to talk about when we're talking about going ape and awkward handjobs in the comments.
lifeisstrange,3cyml6,Romanruler,7,Mon Jul 13 01:43:05 2015 UTC,"I wouldnt think about this much since chance to see some romance with him is slim to none. We are on Episode 3 and he just doesnt make any important role in story and even writers put zero efford to make seem their relationship looks any serious behind few dialogues where Max friendzoning him. Not mention that 50% of all his appearance is discussed as creepiness. Well if you compare how much screen time is putted to creating relationship between Max and Chloe compare to Warren its like 1:40. I think you can make Max having some sort of romantic interest in Warren but you wont see it in game since I doubt that EP4 and EP5 will have atleast so much ""Warren"" as Chloe in it. Also drive in is taking place way behind game events. Only possible romance with him may be in epilogue.  He more seems like one of no-straight ways to not start romance with Chloe. Chloe is bringing him always when she flirts with Max but she doesnt joking. When I agreed to go with Warren on that movie while calling with Warren in EP3 she gives Max very jealous angry look that she did not saw when Warren mentios drive in. If you not agreed and Max mentions it that she doesnt wanna go Chloe looks on her with light smile while she calling. I think that there will be some sort choose of directly friendzoning Warren front of Chloe or vice versa. Maybe something like when Max and Chloe will be together, Chloe will be annoyed by Warren's texts convincing Max to go drive-in , if you kissed Chloe in dare contest, she will take Max phone and make selfie kissing Max on cheek and you will have decision to let her sent it or not - actually it was foreshadowed a bit when you kissed Chloe back then ""now I can text Warren that he doesnt stand chance..."".   Thats his main role in story - or he could be that evil mastermind also."

lifeisstrange,3cxrl9,Mercyva,1 point,Sun Jul 12 09:13:47 2015 UTC,"Mountains really sounds like a final ending song to me, but I'd have personally saved Obstacles and used it later in the story, because it's a fecking good song.  I'm just excited to see how they add more songs into the game. Most have been added digetically, and it's really nice and pretty unique to actually not play the game and just stand next to a radio to listen to the song play, as opposed to it being magically played over everything and coming from the sky."

lifeisstrange,3cxmcb,haXona,2,Sat Jul 11 19:28:45 2015 UTC,I bought the season pass thingy after finishing the first episode.
lifeisstrange,3cxmcb,XMenOrangesTangerine,1 point,Sun Jul 12 12:13:22 2015 UTC,"Aww, I just bought it for 20 bucks too :c Not that I regret it."
lifeisstrange,3cxqvn,Gr4b,11,Sat Jul 11 18:51:45 2015 UTC,"I think that end of EP3 was placed in like 4-6PM (dat lighting) wednesday. When Max was holding that picture she still had Rachel clothes and bag on herself suggesting that she just came back from Chloe. We will for sure start game at exact point where we left (looking at disabled Chloe). In meantime in original timeline Max appears to be gone/unconcisious but very likely we will get back before end of wednesday or we will be able to choose to stay longer or shorter. But in alternative timeline time is exacly same so longer she will stayed there, more troube will make in original one."
lifeisstrange,3cxqvn,TAGsvk,4,Sat Jul 11 19:05:40 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah I forgot that it was a private school that didn't have a 'hometime' like normal schools...  But your post made me realise... When Max goes back in time or has visions around Chloe, the way Chloe sees it is that Max just goes unconscious. So what if she doesn't actually travel back in time (because her body is still visible by Chloe in the present), and it's more of a spiritual projection of some sort?"
lifeisstrange,3cxqvn,TAGsvk,2,Sat Jul 11 19:08:37 2015 UTC,"I think that this is making most sense. I would also destoyed dilema about ""killing William"" because we will have to come back no matter what.   It wouldnt be about choosing and game puts all this alternative timeline in way that while Max is in alternative timeline everything in main timeline just runs normal but Max just got missing. That would mean that our Chloe is still normally living and if Max wouldnt come back Max would simply vanished from there so she has to come back. I assume that we will spent only little time there and it will be just exposition that would tell us what if and get us some touchy dialogues from Willam and then we will tell it back to Chloe. Just after she left Rachel be, so can do with her dad and move on with life. I think this is main reason we are in alternative timeline, but maybe we will have choice to stay there/ or come back to Chloe sooner - but I dont think that we will find out anything vital there - that many things did not changed and if then they would have no value in different original timeline."
lifeisstrange,3cxqvn,warm_slurm,6,Sat Jul 11 19:22:03 2015 UTC,"EP3 took place on Tuesday and Wednesday, so no reason why EP4 can't take place over two days, though obviously it will go into Thursday since that's when the Vortex Club party is (I think?)."
lifeisstrange,3cxqvn,warm_slurm,1 point,Sat Jul 11 19:09:21 2015 UTC,"But if I remember correctly, episode 3 only took place on the Wednesday, because it starts with Max waking up shouting 'Kate!' regarding the events of episode 2."

lifeisstrange,3cx6qq,BarelyReal,4,Sat Jul 11 18:10:18 2015 UTC,"I've recently begun questioning whether or not Max is on the spectrum. It could be that she's just very introverted and socially awkward, but it would tie a lot of her personality and behavior together: her deadpan like speech and expressions, the way her speech patterns come across more like mimicry or forced, her obsession with photography equipment.  Edit: And if the theories of Chloe at least being bi are correct then it would also explain Max's complete obliviousness to what many consider ""Xena"" levels of subtlety."

lifeisstrange,3cx6qq,DeathMcGunz,5,Sat Jul 11 18:39:53 2015 UTC,"Her personality seems not simplified to me, nor hidden. We have around 50 pages of text (end of Ep3) from her personal journal. Even more importantly, we have hundreds of spoken bits of info about the things around Max that we click, all of it colored by her own humour and feelings (I could listen to her voice all day :))  The dialogue and choices make part of her personality depend on the player tho. I find it very difficult to choose things that I would not personally choose so for me her personality is quite set even when I replay. Maybe replaying with widely different choices makes it feel less so."
lifeisstrange,3cx6qq,ward0630,4,Sat Jul 11 19:45:37 2015 UTC,"She's a detective at heart. She's very introspective and though she's new to it, she likes the thrill of trying to read people and get close to learn information. She is manipulative, but not in a self serving way, it's more of a ""I need what you know to help someone else and I'll say anything to get it"" kind of way.   She's not very comfortable with herself, her body or her thoughts and she uses photography to look at the world through a lens, so she can try to understand it.   I don't believe she's bi, nor necessarily interesting in romance at all. She's just intrigued by this new thrill she's feeling. I think in the future, if this time travel thing never happened, she would have became a photo journalist. She would travel a lot, seeing the world through her lens.  This is getting into extreme extrapolation, but I feel like she's maybe a bit empty inside. I don't have any proof other than how much Rachel Amber's missing posters seem to strike her. Like she was looking for something to put herself into, something to fill her soul, so to speak.   That's just my two cents."

lifeisstrange,3cwf62,Ara-Player,17,Sat Jul 11 10:11:54 2015 UTC,"I have stood up for him several times but as a person in real life if I was checking out a girl from the window in the morning, if I said some stupid shit when she cant go with me to a movie then you sure as hell lost the benefit of the doubt.   He hasnt totally lost me, I dont think he can harm anyone physically but man you do understand what you are saying and doing in PUBLIC.   Think of it as a worker who sucks at his job but doesnt know it, Warren sucks on talking and handling girls."
lifeisstrange,3cwf62,haXona,10,Sat Jul 11 12:04:25 2015 UTC,"That's all I'm really seeing though. He's sucking at talking to girls and extremely awkward but trying to play cool. Seems like normal teen actions and attitude to me, especially for a pretty geeky, not in the popular drugs and party crowd.   Sure, maybe I'd think it's more sad and creepy and worthy of disdain if they were in their late 20s or 30s, but dude's just a teen in the height of awkward unknowingness. What exactly does everyone expect from him?  Maybe I just recognize it more cuz I'm fairly fresh out of my teens and the memories of witnessing (and being) such awkwardness is still really fresh or something, I dunno."
lifeisstrange,3cwf62,TankLeFlame,2,Sat Jul 11 15:02:53 2015 UTC,Ohh definitely I just think that these two occasions put his innocence down a notch. You shouldn't check out your friend from the window in the morning because it is a bit creepy especially since he doesn't come forward or anything. Also you don't say the kind of things Warren said to a persons face when they say thank you but no thanks in a friendly manner.   Yeah he is a teenager he's got a lot to learn but come on some self control over your jokes has to be in place even if she is your friend.
lifeisstrange,3cwf62,haXona,10,Sat Jul 11 15:07:40 2015 UTC,"I mean, he was looking for Max, so why not go to where she might be? If they were living in the suburbs and he wanted to hang out, he'd probably go over her house and see if she was there first; only difference is they're on a private school with on-campus housing so her ""house"" is the dorm. But that's just what my take on it was.   Second point, I see him as socially awkward, even for a teen, and not knowing these things just yet. He doesn't have the self control yet. I just feel like we're trying to attribute him with knowledge and consciousness of someone a lot older and more mature than he is, and it's just not like that. He hasn't got these lessons just yet.   Quick edit: in reality, I feel like Max wouldn't know these things either, but between being the player character played by more mature people, and being able to rewind and say the right thing to whatever conversation, she's just not as open to having awkward teenage creepiness. Also her crush is a grown man and a teacher instead of a peer...."
lifeisstrange,3cwf62,TankLeFlame,39,Sat Jul 11 15:25:42 2015 UTC,"His line about ""Sensitive usually means 'won't be having sex with you'"" (in episode 1) put me right off him from the get go. It felt weirdly presumptive. I get that he's a teenager and he's learning to navigate flirting/building relationships, but that combined with loitering outside the window....eh. Not keen on Warren at all."
lifeisstrange,3cwf62,poho,11,Sat Jul 11 11:28:04 2015 UTC,"I knew someone in real life who acted just like him, and he turned out to be a massive stalker. So that immediately put me off of him."

lifeisstrange,3cwf62,chattypenguin,8,Sat Jul 11 19:02:11 2015 UTC,We don't know warren was looking at Max outside the window. And what he tells Max is perfectly fine considering that they both like that type of humor and they have been best friends for a decent amount of time.
lifeisstrange,3cwf62,AERXihu,5,Sat Jul 11 19:46:45 2015 UTC,"and they have been best friends for a decent amount of time.   They've known each other for about a month, and Chloe immediately replaces him with her childhood friend."

lifeisstrange,3cwf62,poho,4,Sat Jul 11 20:48:58 2015 UTC,With him loitering outside the window he did kind of get beaten by Prescott the day before and hadn't seen Max yet to get a full explanation.

There's a point where you can call Warren 'sensitive', and that's his response. It's easy to miss and is quite throwaway. One of the great things about the game, I think. Every playthrough is a little different and can really alter your perspective."
lifeisstrange,3cwf62,poho,3,Sun Jul 12 09:55:18 2015 UTC,"Also worth noting that this particular dialogue cannot be rewinded, the ""cutscene"" doesn't end until you enter Chloe's room.  Everything in between has to be reloaded to be replayed, meaning you can't get all the dialogue from Chloe or Warren in that scene. A pretty neat way to give those two conversations more weight, you're perception is only colored by how you act during your first playthrough."
lifeisstrange,3cwf62,OneJobToRuleThemAll,12,Sun Jul 12 11:24:41 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure why there seems to be a ""look what he did for you! that means you owe him dates/romantic interest"" kind of explanation I hear so often.  I like him better with Stella or Brooke than with Max, really. That's what it comes down to in my game, besides some stuff already stated here."
lifeisstrange,3cwf62,koraat,7,Sat Jul 11 15:25:43 2015 UTC,"Even Max says ""Brooke is so perfect for Warren"" or something. I think it's pretty well-established that Max doesn't like Warren that way, but I have a hunch that the player's choices can alter her feelings, I guess we'll have to see about that..."
lifeisstrange,3cwf62,sleep_hero,5,Sat Jul 11 21:39:37 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't be surprised, although Max seems so ambivalent towards Warren. That could change, of course.

lifeisstrange,3cwf62,koraat,-5,Sat Jul 11 22:24:37 2015 UTC,EDIT: Since I forgot to edit this and all these people are giving me there shit and talking about how im a terrible person.  Max doesn't owe Warren anything however it wouldn't hurt for her to repay him with kindness for the things he has done for her. She could If someone did something nice for me a few times I know I would do something in return for them.  NOW STOP GIVING ME SHIT.
lifeisstrange,3cwf62,AERXihu,10,Sat Jul 11 19:57:33 2015 UTC,"Women don't owe dudes anything, lol. Max doesn't owe him for those things. He should be doing those things for genuine reasons, even if he has feelings. If he is doing those things simply because he is expecting her to date him as a result and due to a sense of entitlement, then that's wrong as hell. Hell, I don't even think the actual character thinks this way 100%."
lifeisstrange,3cwf62,solas29,-3,Sun Jul 12 02:43:50 2015 UTC,She doesn't owe him but she could at least pay him back. Did i forget to edit this comment or something? This isn't what I meant at all.
lifeisstrange,3cwf62,AERXihu,5,Sun Jul 12 02:49:00 2015 UTC,I guess he would need to find a place to cash in his kindness coins
lifeisstrange,3cwf62,Trainee1985,8,Sat Jul 11 21:51:00 2015 UTC,"For starters, Max never asked Warren to ""take a beating"". Honestly, he jumped into that one, himself. If he was worried for Max, he could've easily went to get security. As for the consoling and helping Max out...? Really? You consider these gestures meant to be repaid in dates? I'd honestly hate to be your friend."
lifeisstrange,3cwf62,koraat,-6,Sat Jul 11 22:21:59 2015 UTC,Doesn't matter if he did or didn't He did either way. Max could atleast give him a date by going somewhere with him or whatever. And honestly running for security would take to long. We don't know what Nathan would have done. I never said these things need to be repaid in dates. I would hate to be your friend aswell.
lifeisstrange,3cwf62,AERXihu,8,Sun Jul 12 02:49:03 2015 UTC,"You literally had those things included in a list of why Max owes Warren a date. Well, you did before you edited it so you wouldn't look (as) bad, lol.  You need to get over the idea that people owe dates to anyone who acts nice to them or does a ""good deed"". Seriously. At least you're sort of beginning to understand that with your backtracking edits, but then you shove your keyboard in your mouth again in other posts."

lifeisstrange,3cwf62,AERXihu,21,Sun Jul 12 03:12:19 2015 UTC,"I actually think Warren is really cute, but yeah it's really obvious he has a crush on Max. Honestly he's just a quirky teenage nerd, not at all different from a lot of dudes you see every day - maybe a little more nerdy, but that's totally okay. I haven't finished the third episode yet, so I'm not sure how much choice you have regarding Max's LI, but I think it would be cool, if we could chose either Chloe (cuz I think they're heading in that direction) or Warren. I don't mind it not working out with one or both of them, but having the choice of playing an open minded young adult seems kinda awesome."
lifeisstrange,3cwf62,gfatreak,2,Sat Jul 11 12:36:00 2015 UTC,agreed
lifeisstrange,3cwf62,theironlefty,4,Sat Jul 11 12:44:02 2015 UTC,I definitely agree. It is obvious he has a crush on Max and after all the things he has done to help us I'd rather look at that then all these other things to make him out to be a wierdo.
lifeisstrange,3cwf62,AERXihu,18,Sat Jul 11 19:55:36 2015 UTC,There are a lot of reasons people can think Warren is weird. Just as many as there are reasons why Warren is not weird. Its just that people like to polarise to one side way too much.
lifeisstrange,3cwf62,lixyna,13,Sat Jul 11 10:36:10 2015 UTC,"He certainly is a ""nice guy"""
lifeisstrange,3cwf62,TwitOne,11,Sat Jul 11 10:42:21 2015 UTC,Eh i agree  he's the kind of guy who would post this on facebook unironically.
lifeisstrange,3cwf62,Lumenarious,12,Sat Jul 11 11:48:32 2015 UTC,"A bit too insistent with the message spamming would be OK nervous behaviour but EP 2's stalker window watching... well... lets just say he's a bit too clingy and he has previously arranged to go to the drive through with dunno, either brooke or stella (can't remember) then dumps them on the spot if max says yes.  That's 'nice guy' behavioural territory and not the behaviour of a nice guy."
lifeisstrange,3cwf62,SteveJEO,2,Sat Jul 11 12:11:39 2015 UTC,I would dump them on the spot to if I liked Max.
lifeisstrange,3cwf62,AERXihu,6,Sat Jul 11 19:56:20 2015 UTC,"He handles the situation super badly though. He treats Brook as a plan B, not a friend; he doesn't consider her feelings for a moment and she obviously cares."
lifeisstrange,3cwf62,homer858,2,Sun Jul 12 07:03:11 2015 UTC,You are right about that. I wonder if Brooke will tell him about how she feels. Warren is a way better match with Brooke than Max.
lifeisstrange,3cwf62,AERXihu,2,Sun Jul 12 23:55:54 2015 UTC,"He treats Brooke as a friend, and a friend is the plan B when you're looking for a date with your crush. Also, he only asks Brooke if Max rejects his invitation.   It's really quite simple: Brooke has a crush on Warren, but Warren doesn't realize, thinking of her as a friend. Warren has a crush on Max, but Max doesn't realize, thinking of him as a friend. And they're all handling it in the typical way teenagers handle that kind of mess.  You can fault Warren for being a stalker, but not for prioritizing getting a date over hanging out with a friend."
lifeisstrange,3cwf62,OneJobToRuleThemAll,1 point,Sun Jul 12 11:35:26 2015 UTC,"Assuming you played that way, I'm totally crushing on Warren the same way he is crushing on Max, so the flirting and excitement is definitely reciprocated. I never saw him as a ""stalker"" and get excited when he texts me. Wish I could be spending all my time with him rather than with psycho Chloe."
lifeisstrange,3cwf62,Coridan1984,6,Sun Jul 12 13:25:53 2015 UTC,"I think Warren is trying too hard to get Max's attention and doesn't get that she's not into him. If he really wants a date look at Brooke who is as she says ""the only person who can talk back with him"" about his interests like Meteorology and all that jazz.   TheSw1tcher YouTube channel's Matt and Liam called Warren Max's ""Swirlly Glasses"" which is 100% hitting the nail on the head."
lifeisstrange,3cwf62,Otaku3173,2,Sat Jul 11 17:29:46 2015 UTC,he is a lot like umino...
lifeisstrange,3cwf62,alistairtheirin,6,Sat Jul 11 19:03:01 2015 UTC,"He's not a bad dude, but he does creepy things. I get it's part of the whole ""teenager with a massive and hardcore crush"" but, nah. Looking at Max's room from outside her window, having a tracking device on Max (Brooke tells you this), and being extremely persistent and not respecting Max's clear ""no"" are things that really get me rolling my eyes and being creeped out. The girl isn't interested and says no, respect that and chill out bruh. Also, if Max says yes to the date, he goes off to tell Brooke that they can't go anymore. He's kind of just using Brooke there in case his plan didn't work. (If he wasn't, he would've invited both Brooke and Max to hang out)  He's not a Bad Guy, but he's that ""nice guy"" who has some red flags going for him, imo. I'd like him a lot more if he just respected Max's clear lack of interest in him."
lifeisstrange,3cwf62,solas29,5,Sat Jul 11 18:14:47 2015 UTC,that gps thing was a joke from brooke :)
lifeisstrange,3cwf62,theironlefty,5,Sat Jul 11 18:18:37 2015 UTC,"I kinda wouldn't put it past him, tbh. But I'll go along with you, and say that it doesn't eliminate any of the various creepy things that he does aside from that. Dude is just an awkward boy, but he's gotta chill."
lifeisstrange,3cwf62,solas29,3,Sat Jul 11 18:22:13 2015 UTC,"You know I'm not so sure if Brooke was kidding. She didn't really say it like she was joking around. And in the beginning of the game she says ""I'm sure he'll TRACK you down"". And why was he standing right near the dorms. Where he knew you'd walk by. I just think it raises a lot of red flags."
lifeisstrange,3cwf62,chattypenguin,-1,Sat Jul 11 19:36:25 2015 UTC,You must have issues if you don't think she is kidding. She obviously loves Warren and gets mad with Max for being better than her. He was waiting on Max btw. Sure Warren might do creepy things but people need to calm down.
lifeisstrange,3cwf62,AERXihu,6,Sat Jul 11 19:53:11 2015 UTC,"How does that say I have issues? I didn't hear any sarcasm in her voice. Like at all. I don't know if you are a girl, but creepy guys tend to be possessive. I'm not saying he's a murderer but he's done too many things to not label him as a creeper."
lifeisstrange,3cwf62,chattypenguin,-1,Sat Jul 11 19:59:50 2015 UTC,Im actually a boy.  There is obvious jealousy in Brooke's voice. It was a joke and easy to tell at that. Which is why I said that. While he has done lots of things to label him a creeper he has done small things that helps in a big way to label him a nice friend.
lifeisstrange,3cwf62,AERXihu,3,Sat Jul 11 20:03:47 2015 UTC,"I don't detest Warren but he is too creepy. He asks Max out for Ape movies night even though he promised to go with Brooke. You can easily deduce that he would do anything to get together with Max, that's why he is not my favorite.  and I forgot to add he lurks around Max's window which makes him ultra weird even for a teenager."
lifeisstrange,3cwf62,rrainmaker,-2,Sat Jul 11 15:43:56 2015 UTC,Would you rather go with someone you like or someone you don't like? And we don't know he is looking at Max. He could be waiting for her to come out.
lifeisstrange,3cwf62,AERXihu,5,Sat Jul 11 19:51:35 2015 UTC,"I would not treat my friend as a dick. I think he is literally spying on Max, why would he be around girls dormitory then?"
lifeisstrange,3cwf62,rrainmaker,0,Sat Jul 11 20:16:40 2015 UTC,Because he is waiting for Max to come out so he can talk to her about the movie. He was never looking directly at Max's window just at the girls dormitory. And how is Brooke his friend? He hardly acknowledges that she exists. He is crushing on Max.
lifeisstrange,3cwf62,AERXihu,2,Sat Jul 11 20:22:26 2015 UTC,"yeah but correct me If am wrong he hadn't even talked to Max about the movie yet, while he was there. I think he was deliberately trying to see max when she leaves dorm."
lifeisstrange,3cwf62,rrainmaker,0,Sat Jul 11 20:25:15 2015 UTC,He mentioned it before at the beginning of the game but Nathan interrupted Max telling him about her powers and him asking Max. Which is why when he was standing by her dorm he was looking and trying to see if Max was coming out. So once she did come out he brought up the movie.
lifeisstrange,3cwf62,AERXihu,3,Sat Jul 11 20:34:27 2015 UTC,My point is he was trying to spy on Max just see when she is leaving for asking her out while he had already promised to Brooke to go with her. And you don't think this is creepy. http://i.imgur.com/qt7S4WP.jpg also according to my eyes he is staring at Max's window.
lifeisstrange,3cwf62,rrainmaker,-1,Sat Jul 11 20:43:49 2015 UTC,He doesn't know which room is Max which is why it makes more sense that he is just looking at the girls dormitory in that picture. Besides as I said if you were Warren would you go with someone you promised just because they asked you or go with someone that you actually like. People always say they would go with the person they promised but if it actually happened lots of people would go with the one they like
lifeisstrange,3cwf62,AERXihu,3,Sat Jul 11 20:46:44 2015 UTC,"and staring at girls dormitory is normal, how? I would go with the one I promised no matter what. I don't think I want to argue with you anymore, this is my opinion which I still believe true."
lifeisstrange,3cwf62,rrainmaker,-1,Sat Jul 11 20:54:45 2015 UTC,I never said it was normal. All im saying is that Warren as waiting for Max to come out. And this was never an argument. You just didn't pay attention. This is a discussion.
lifeisstrange,3cwf62,AERXihu,4,Sat Jul 11 21:05:17 2015 UTC,"It's just a matter on whether people are willing to validate his actions because of his age/social awkwardness. I don't think the creepy things that Warren has done (particularly him watching Max from her dorm, and his way of handling the whole go-ape situation) are okay just because he's an awkward teenager. That being said-- I quite like Warren regardless. He's a smart kid, adorably nerdy, and he's pulled through a few times for Max (I have to give him credit for taking a beating from Nathan). He's proven a loyal friend, but I'm still wary about him.   There's also just the huge lack of knowing what his character motivations are. It's why I can't entirely trust him. Like-- It honestly baffles me that Warren keeps trying to get Max to go on a date with him after the blatant disinterest on Max's part (Seriously, WHY?). Which is partially from Max's own social weirdness. The communication between them is just AWFUL. It's not helping anyone.   I have to agree on what OP said about the writers-- they've done a nice job of making it hard for the player to label characters in ""good"" and ""bad"" boxes. Hopefully it gets harder as the game goes on!   TL;DR: He's done some odd things that I wouldn't sweep under the rug. But I won't crucify him just yet, he's a cool kid. Lack of character motivation is why people are so polarized on it, tbh."
lifeisstrange,3cwf62,Avenefica,5,Sat Jul 11 18:56:20 2015 UTC,"Which is partially from Max's own social weirdness.   This plays a huge part if you ask me - she never really shuts him down, just kind of evades, so he remains convinced he has a chance."
lifeisstrange,3cwf62,centerflag982,3,Sat Jul 11 22:27:46 2015 UTC,"Exactly. It makes sense, because her character is defined by her insecurity and lack of assertiveness; but still, their communication is terrible.   At first I was really confused as to why Max just couldn't straight up shut him down; from my understanding, she's not very interested in him (I'm basing this off of her journal entries, in which she repeatedly states she doesn't really see Warren that way). Then I realized it's probably the game's way of leaving it up to the player-- a way of leaving the door open if the player decides to change their mind.   That and Max in general is super indecisive. I hope somewhere in further episodes we get an option of turning him down definitely (should the player choose to play their game that way). And just put him out of his misery. I'd be more concerned if after that Warren kept being pushy."
lifeisstrange,3cwf62,Avenefica,3,Sat Jul 11 23:02:19 2015 UTC,"He's just too desperate. You're right, he's just a kid, he's learning to navigate though love and such. But with the way he's acting, waiting outside/looking inside of her window, presuming friendships lead to sex and guilt-tripping Max into going into the movie by saying ""I already bought you a ticket"" and stuff like that, he's becoming someone who will have a very skewed way of seeing women.   If Max or someone does not tell him what he's doing, then soon he'll be like all of those ""forever alone"" people who feels robbed of love and affection when he feels he's giving his all, when he's really just being a good friend."

Not to mention that is no better way to date girl that tell her ""I have also plan B (another girl) if you wont go with me, and if you go I will have to tell her that I am going with you instead of her"" If you not agree - annoying messages, ""I bought extra tickets"" even that poster clearly saying that tickets are peer one car he laugh on Cannibal Holocaust - probably most discussing film ever where actual animals were really killed in process - can be bigger exposition to ""I am creepy character"" that weird stalking in EP2 (speculation) He may be the one who turned Max and Chloe at the pool. I doubt that Blackwell is having 24/7 security with only one stuff member - David. Most likely he was called by somebody and I doubt it was alarm or somebody from neighbrought since Blackwell seems to be isolated from the town. At 1AM there is really not many people awake - but Warren was.

Max and Warren photoshopped selfie (that's not weird at all)  -how do we know is a photoshop? Max just said it was weird not that she never took the picture, and in a video game all the pictures look photoshopped.  -Can't argue with point 3 that's was pretty underhanded of him.  If you not agree - annoying messages, ""I bought extra tickets"" even that poster clearly saying that tickets are peer one car  -Warren knows the following thing by that time, Chloe has a car, Chloe and Max are friends. Extra ticket so Max can bring Chloe?   he laugh on Cannibal Holocaust - probably most discussing film ever where actual animals were really killed in process - can be bigger exposition to ""I am creepy character""  because no teenager has ever said stupid things while trying to impress the opposite sex right?  that weird stalking in EP2  -Max's windows faces the rising sun in the morning Warren is probably looking at the entrance, because without a Bionic Eye and enhanced imaging all he would see is sun glare.   -last one is speculation and we can speculate ever which way but ideally in more fun ways, like Waren is a robot sent from the future to stop Max so the Vortex can achieving sentience. Would also explain how he can see across the court yard through sun glare into Max's window. And is totally cool about discussing the construction of a bomb on a open line 2 years after 9-11!

Objectively, he might be useful to Max than Chloe is (although whether either of them has been a very good friend so far is questionable). Sure, Chloe will help you escape Nathan, but Warren will take a serious beating for you. Yeah, Chloe can steal a key ring, but Warren will help you craft an IED, no questions asked.  Having an unrequited crush on your friend shouldn't diminish all the good he's done for us just in the first three episodes."

lifeisstrange,3cwf62,jessebona,11,Sun Jul 12 04:41:00 2015 UTC,Ehh when he's outside looking around that's where you end up finding him. Do people not look up at their friends dorm rooms or apartment windows or house lights if they're waiting outside it?
lifeisstrange,3cwf62,sleep_hero,2,Sat Jul 11 10:17:21 2015 UTC,That's the start of episode 2.
lifeisstrange,3cwf62,Hassanian,2,Sat Jul 11 13:06:52 2015 UTC,"I don't hate Warren. I actually think he's kind of adorable in an awkward way. Like if I'd known him in high school I would have had a huge crush on him (I also would have had a crush on Chloe though so idk) I accepted a date with him on my first playthrough because I thought he would be a lot more chill about it. Then I felt bad because he went through so much trouble to get tickets and kept texting Max about it, obviously very excited and having very high expectations, and I just kept thinking ""man, I really don't want to hurt this guy, but I'm hella crushing on Chloe right now sooo...""  So I said no to him on my second playthrough, and he said he'd ask Brooke, and I was like YAYY she'll be so happy (and maybe she'll finally stop being so salty to Max). But then Warren keeps texting Max and asking her to the movies over and over again. *sigh* Poor Warren."
lifeisstrange,3cwf62,Dagegen,2,Sat Jul 11 10:20:35 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure the writers are expressing genius here.  I think there's a trend among writers of young characters in general, to misunderstand how they speak and behave.

lifeisstrange,3cwf62,PREPAREyourANGUS,6,Sat Jul 11 21:57:12 2015 UTC,"He obviously has a crush on Max, but does not tell her.

lifeisstrange,3cwf62,JoetotheD,4,Sat Jul 11 21:41:28 2015 UTC,I am definitely with you on Team Warren. I think he's gonna do something in the next couple episodes to really help Max out. He's already got her out of a couple sticky situations - Nathan and getting into the Principal's office. I ahve faith he'll come through for Max again
lifeisstrange,3cwf62,centerflag982,2,Sat Jul 11 18:42:47 2015 UTC,"Because he's a player. In the beginning of episode two before he asks you on the date he mentions he was waiting on a call. Most people glossed over that. If you find the actual drive-in poster for the ape movie marathon in episode 3 you find a sticky note attached that reads ""looking for a lady friend to go with call me"". Could be someone else but I highly doubt it. Plus all of the other little things everyone else already mentioned."

Better than ""hey I've been standing here all morning hoping you'd come by""   Could be someone else but I highly doubt it.   Likely is someone else. It's painfully obvious he's only into (or at least primarily into) Max. Yeah, he has Brooke as a ""backup plan"" for the movie, but that's just a friendly thing - it's made clear several times that he's not romantically interested in her, much to her frustration. It's the entire reason she tends to be short with Max"

lifeisstrange,3cwf62,Areuto,6,Sat Jul 11 22:17:59 2015 UTC,"I'm still fairly certain he bought a car because he wanted/needed a car. Meanwhile, the side effects of a car are that you can do car things now, such as go to a drive-in movie, so why not go?   I never saw why the people here think he spent money on a car just for a single--ungauranteed--date. That's just trying to add more things to make him seem worse because they don't like him."

lifeisstrange,3cwf62,AERXihu,1 point,Sat Jul 11 11:28:43 2015 UTC,"I really, really hope he is genuinely good. He comes off as a ""nice guy"" in that he will be there and do favors for Max with ulterior motives. I would know because I was like that 4 years ago until I realized it was manipulative and not healthy, but I didn't know any better and had been raised to think you have to show love/give gifts to get love. Thank god I broke away from that belief.   But there were things he did that kind of rubbed me as ""You owe me!"" like texting Max after saving her from Nathan, (which I hear an argument for that is that she didn't text him ""Thank you""), or if the player chooses to say ""Yes"" to his movie plans, he says ""I have to tell Brooke I'm going to the movies with you instead"", I just had to rewind. I don't need Brooke hating me anymore than she probably already does, and that was kind of a scummy thing to do. I don't know if I did the right thing to do, because when I played, 79% accepted his invitation. And I noticed the dialogue changed to where he says ""I guess I go ask Brooke if she wants to go"", so in that case, it doesn't seem like he made plans with her yet.  I really hope it doesn't happen where he gets rejected (player's choice I'm guessing), and becomes vindictive or just leaves us. He doesn't seem like he could harm anybody, but I tend to carry the notion to expect the unexpected in games after being betrayed too many times haha.  Yes, I do think Warren is cute. I love his adorable shirts, his goofy pose for the camera, how much he helped us, but I don't know. Maybe in another playthrough I will accept his invitation. I do feel for him though. It's obvious to the player as well as Dana, Brooke, and perhaps Chloe that he likes Max . So I don't know if Max is oblivious to it, in denial, or [like her journal says] only sees Warren as a geeky little brother."
lifeisstrange,3cwf62,Trainee1985,-1,Sat Jul 11 13:32:45 2015 UTC,I feel like people hate on Warren because they have their own problems. They say he is watching Max from the window but he can actually just be looking at the dorms waiting for Max to come out. They say he photo shopped a picture which may seem creepy I understand that. But people ignore he is there for Max. He helps talk to her after she saves Kate from suicide/Fails to save Kate. He takes a beating from Nathan. He helps them create a bomb to get in the principal office. He is a nice friend for Max.  May I also say that Chloe does the same shit and no one says anything? She is highly possesive of Max (like others say Warren is) yet no one doesn't talk about her because of her personal issues.
lifeisstrange,3cwf62,AERXihu,3,Sat Jul 11 13:37:26 2015 UTC,"You seem to believe that Warren is entitled to a date/whatever he wants from Max because he did nice things for her. That's not how a relationship works.   People think Warren's weird because he's a classic creeper who is blatantly using 'friendship' to try and get with Max. Unrequited love is one thing but all the guilt-tripping, 'I WOULD TAKE A BULLET FOR YOU!' nonsense and the way he comes across as so entitled because of it. Grosses me out."
lifeisstrange,3cwf62,Trainee1985,-2,Sat Jul 11 19:34:16 2015 UTC,He isn't entitled to a date but he deserves something from Max. I don't remember if she thanked him though.
lifeisstrange,3cwf62,AERXihu,2,Mon Jul 13 16:21:30 2015 UTC,getting a girlfriend isn't something you 'deserve' for being nice. You should be nice anyway it's not a special badge of honor. Warren is a classic 'nice guy'. /r/niceguys would approve
lifeisstrange,3cxihg,Candalistic,9,Sat Jul 11 17:38:54 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure we will not find out where Rachel Amber went.  It seems like they are going to keep it a mystery, and focus on Max being a ""replacement"" for Chloe. Which is kind of ironic."
lifeisstrange,3cxihg,The-Irish-Potato,9,Sat Jul 11 17:43:37 2015 UTC,"More ironic is that Rachel was always replacement for Max. Chloe never forgot on Max even she dont wanna admit it that much. She still keeps that drawings (also that old painting in garden and pirate towel) and photos that had with Max in her room on what Max made few commentaries. After she wanted to let Max go she probably wanted to make move on Rachel, unaware/blnd that she is having relationship with like everybody but Rachel got missing just then. Then she spent half year in fantasy that she will find Rachel and they will be together (that desperate looking for somebody cant be explained otherwise). Then comes Max again. And after that Chloe found out that Rachel was already banging somebody else. I think only reason for ""Rachel was banging Frank"" subplot is just to make it less looks like Chloe will have to choose between Max and Rachel. Well if you played pro-Chloe that she already get Max face on her phone instead of Rachel what suggesting that she let her finally go. Still I think that if writers are going for romance (what is quite obvious) they will have to put more ""What happened before Max left"" to know them releationship before. They were BFF for sure, but from exposition that we so far got it seems like they were way too close. I mean it was always about ""Max and Chloe"" and no other kids mentioned ever, they seem with their pirate games, forts, drawnings way too close and its very possible that Chloe at age of 14 already developed some feelings outside of friendship on her. That would explain lot of things."

lifeisstrange,3cwclx,Reavens,3,Sat Jul 11 09:26:31 2015 UTC,"I thought the story in Remember Me was surprisingly great, the last ""rescramble memory"" sequence is genuinely fantastic, and I was very interested that Nilin and Edge did come at a cross with eachother occasionally, it set up an interesting dynamic.  Shame though, that the final boss is absolutely ridiculous and the ending really peeters of into nothingness. It felt like the narrative was getting a bit too complex for the writers to really know what they were doing with it, so they just said ""fuck it, giant man-boss, then everything's happy forever."""
lifeisstrange,3cwclx,Gobblignash,2,Sat Jul 11 09:53:55 2015 UTC,"Yeah, can definitely agree with that. The last boss fight was a bit silly but I don't feel my experience with the game is any worse for it. The ending could have been expanded on, but I quite enjoyed the simplicity of it. It felt a little bit like they were building up for a possible sequel though, but it still stands on its own. I believe the story in general was pretty excellent, and I think it has quite a couple of similarities with Life is Strange too, as I mentioned."
lifeisstrange,3cwclx,jessebona,2,Sat Jul 11 09:56:26 2015 UTC,"I rather enjoyed Remember Me even if the remixes frustrated me sometimes. I took the same theme of the game away, that you need the good and bad to be who you are. The ending was rather tragic though, ""remember you soon""."
lifeisstrange,3cwclx,jessebona,1 point,Sat Jul 11 10:51:43 2015 UTC,"Hah. It was a bit difficult spotting those ""memory glitches"" sometimes, or you had to pause it at just the right moment or you wouldn't be able to do it. I felt so bad in the last remix though, when you're changing your father's memories. Felt really wrong.  I have been wondering what he really meant by ""Remember you soon."" I thought it would have been a lot more touching if he had said ""Remember me,"" if perhaps a bit corny. It'd be a nice wrap up and reference to the meaning of the story and the game."
lifeisstrange,3cwclx,jessebona,1 point,Sat Jul 11 11:40:21 2015 UTC,"The last remix wasn't that sad because afterward, him being the creator, realised what you did immediately. ""remember you soon"" is just a future variant of saying goodbye. So it was more like him going ""goodbye sis"" than anything else."
lifeisstrange,3cwclx,jessebona,1 point,Sat Jul 11 11:44:37 2015 UTC,"afterwards it didn't feel that bad, true. Still, I thought the game did sort of try to show you that you didn't really have the right in changing people's memories, as in the case of the person who commits suicide because of what you did. Sort of how Max shouldn't have the right to play God with time itself.  I suppose you're right about it simply being a goodbye. It's sad nonetheless, of course."

lifeisstrange,3cwclx,KaiG1987,1 point,Sat Jul 11 11:52:13 2015 UTC,"It often has consequences you do not anticipate, in my opinion. Life is Strange sort of reflects that aspect. By saving Chloe's father for example, you changed a lot of things for better or worse (and not just about Chloe herself.)  I mean, I suppose I can't speak for the possibility of someone holding such powers in the real world, but I suspect it would be the same. Even with good intentions things don't always end as you want them to."

But damn that connection between Cross and Kate gave me goosebumps. I never really thought about how and why DONTNOD decided to use these song. I thought they just had great taste in music. Isnt there only 3 songs left that have not been used yet? I dont know how they are going to fit that all for 2 more episode.   But anyways, all I know is that, people better start stockpiling on some tissue when this song plays.  .  As for the plot (the big reveal, the purpose, Rachel, settling ships etc) ending song, I agree, it feel like they are going to use the In my mind song for the final scene. It seems like a neutral song that is suppose to be wrapping up the whole story. And can be fit for the multiple (happy, sad, and the whatevathefuck) endings.   However for the series finale scene, I really hope we do not get an ending sequence of different LiS characters like the one we get at the end of each episode.   But instead we get some sort of behind the scene video sequence of DONTNOD team and voice actors working together on the game, as a farewell and thank you for going on a journey with them accompany with an extended credit song Because I will need all of that time to reflect and accept that Life is Strange is finish. ಥ_ಥ"

lifeisstrange,3cv0ta,Herox01,2,Sat Jul 11 03:32:36 2015 UTC,"What first got me interested was the action and conseguences theme, the slow gameplay, which is rarely seen these days in games and ofc the soundtrack and the atmosphere. What made me love it is the incredible courage of Dontnod to tackle topics, which are rarely touched in video games, since they are no easy ones and if touched, most of the times done wrong, but not this time. Also they add layer after layer to the characters, so they become more realistic, and not a single one is just a sexy lady so the boys have something to be happy about without giving them some background on why they are that way, it simply feels like real life, strange real life =)"
lifeisstrange,3cv0ta,etriangel,2,Sat Jul 11 03:38:41 2015 UTC,"The genre is what pulled me in. /r/interactivecinema is a favorite of mine. And that goes back to the launch of Telltale's The Walking Dead.   However, that only got me playing the game.   The game mechanic was great. Both in in IC games, and close-IC games (Dragon age, Mass Effect), you'll say something you didn't mean, but didn't know because of the few words show were shit. So, yeah.   However, the characters are what drew me in to stay.   Remember when Reddit had (Seriously, is it over yet?) the Jennifer Lawrence phase? It's because she is cute, quirky, and 'down to earth'. Jlaw may not actually be like that, but Max... Well.. yeah...."
lifeisstrange,3cv0ta,Bond4141,2,Sat Jul 11 03:52:33 2015 UTC,It would have to be the music in the game for me. The original scores and the songs they use are all equally amazing!
lifeisstrange,3cv0ta,Dr_FunionZ,2,Sat Jul 11 04:36:19 2015 UTC,"I've always thought video games were one of the best ways to tell a story, and this seems to be a prime example of that.   Also I like Max's sardonic humor and personality, among other things."
lifeisstrange,3cv0ta,narcolepticnine,2,Sat Jul 11 06:54:42 2015 UTC,"It's the first game I've played that really captures the youthful indie movie vibe, making it quite unique. The music is chosen well, and the art style is quite beautiful.   What really separates this game from the usual Telltale affair is the exploration. When Max comments and interacts with her surroundings, it isn't just a matter-of-fact observation. The setting is an extension of the characters. Looking through all these objects, photos, posters, often serves to characterize both Max and usually another character. A good example is in Chloe's house, where she reveals a lot of their shared memories, or reveals bits of Chloe's life without Max (as in, with Rachel or her overbearing stepfather). In the walking dead game, these types of interactions are more often simple comments of ""I can't use that"", as your character tries to get from point A to point B. In LiS, even the collectibles help characterize Max's passion for art, and her appreciation for all these small moments in her life, even amongst the drama.  In the end, these characterizations are made meaningful because Max is genuinely likeable. Despite her last name, she is considerate, quirky  and tries to see the best in people, while relatably neglecting herself in that. Her relationship with Chloe is one of an odd balance of two somewhat extreme sides to teenage youth. Max, while thoughtful, is passive and indecisive shown most often in her immediate regret to every major decision. In contrast, Chloe is brash, headstrong, often acting as the driving force behind most of the events of Max's life (often as a ""let's check out ____"").  They both carry a bit of lonely directionlessness without each other, and it's fun to see them grow together. I'm especially interested in seeing how they subvert this dynamic after Ep 3's conclusion."
lifeisstrange,3cv0ta,BoxtopBronson,2,Sat Jul 11 07:51:01 2015 UTC,"I just love games that play out like a movie. So far I've played Fahrenheit, Heavy Rain & Beyond Two Souls.  LiS just fit into what i really liked to play & the story turned out to catch me even more."
lifeisstrange,3cv0ta,Agent_Alpha,2,Sat Jul 11 07:58:26 2015 UTC,"I like the character writing and the different branching consequences from the in-game choices we make. Everything--and everyone--has many facets to explore. Plus, this game is gorgeous! I could get lost in its world for hours if I weren't following the plot."

lifeisstrange,3cv0ta,AlvarezMd90,1 point,Sat Jul 11 09:49:15 2015 UTC,"Hm.. bad taste yup. Like people listening to mainstream music and not expanding their range of genres. I don't care about the fact that none of my friends know about this game. Let them play their games and listen to their favorite music. They'll eventually grow tired of the duplicates and play/listen other genres that are also duplicates of each other. This game however, is too personal for me to share somehow. To me it felt like it included a lot of things directly connected to my interests and personality. With the animals, guitar, Max's character and awkwardness in socializing."
lifeisstrange,3cv0ta,AlvarezMd90,1 point,Sat Jul 11 11:25:44 2015 UTC,"Alright.. so is Mirrors Edge and Beyond Two Souls? If I recall correctly, the majority of people playing this game are male. xD  Yes, it may look a little like a girly high school drama at first, but there's more to it as you play further through this game."
lifeisstrange,3cv0ta,Ara-Player,2,Sat Jul 11 16:50:58 2015 UTC,"1) The choice-consequence episodic feature of the game, I liked TWD  2) Choices actually seem to matter rather in the TWD where it's an illusion.  3) The soundtrack, atmosphere, generally everything that gives a good nice touch is present.  4) Characters act real, there is an actual mystery which provokes theories and pacing is on touch.  5) Most important of all, Lampfield  6) And plantfield."
lifeisstrange,3cv0ta,Julius74,2,Sat Jul 11 20:10:15 2015 UTC,"Max, her beautiful voice telling me all kinds of things about her world and how that makes the world and Max herself not only seen on screen but feel so very real. The perfect integration of lighting and music (and silence also). Usually when I leave a game after 5h I feel like I've done nothing much except kill time. When I leave LiS after an hour or two I feel as if I have spent a whole day in another world."

lifeisstrange,3cv0ta,yarfmeister,1 point,Sat Jul 11 13:06:06 2015 UTC,"The relationship between Max and Chloe is what got me. I'm a sucker for stories that revolve around a bond (of any kind) between two people, and LiS is (in my opinion) one of the best of these stories. Their friendship is touching, cute, often hilarious, and realistic. Max and Chloe feel like real people, and therefore their bond also feels real. I instantly fell in love with both Max and Chloe as a result. It has a nostalgic effect of reminding me of my own childhood best friend."

lifeisstrange,3cv0ta,haXona,1 point,Sat Jul 11 17:20:39 2015 UTC,Mainly because its substantially different than anything else western games wise. Not many likes to take the chance on a game like LIS but Dontnod and SE did and I am happy they did because its been a nice little ride!
lifeisstrange,3cv0ta,crimsonGungnir,1 point,Sat Jul 11 18:48:28 2015 UTC,"The rewind mechanic makes the game feel like Groundhog Day or Edge of Tomorrow but in high school, which is a kind of mechanic I've been wanting to see in games. I also like how there's not really a limit on Max's powers except for you know what part; you can keep rewinding until you're satisfied. The cast is also great, it's very diverse in many ways, such as their motivations, their allegiances, etc. A new game mechanic, deep characters, an end of the world plot with smaller personal plots makes this game the perfect storm for me."

Speaking only for myself, it doesn't ""ruin"" anything to watch a trailer or read a summation of something before experiencing it for myself, it INCREASES my enjoyment.  I have a mild-to-severe anxiety disorder and have always been entirely unable to watch, read, or play things when I don't know the ending - I spend so much time and energy being anxious about ""not knowing"" that I cannot actually enjoy the discovery process.  e.g., I have to wait for an entire season of a TV show to be out before I can watch a single episode, so that I can go on Wikipedia and read the episode summaries; I have to read the Goodreads summary of a book before I read the book itself, or my hands sweat and shake as I try to turn the pages.

lifeisstrange,3cvhai,wHatTheFez,1 point,Sat Jul 11 03:32:37 2015 UTC,Does that mean episode 4 is finished?! :O
lifeisstrange,3cvhai,LilianH,2,Sun Jul 12 02:34:30 2015 UTC,Parts of it are I'm sure. They've already confirmed that the voice acting for Ep 4 and 5 is done (this was in a tweet a while ago). But I'm sure there are still bugs to iron out.
lifeisstrange,3cvhai,wHatTheFez,1 point,Sun Jul 12 03:25:37 2015 UTC,"Yeah, well I hope it's out soon, I can't take much more waiting...  They did say 6 to 8 weeks, it should be any day now, but I don't blame them if it's late, as long as it's still life is strange _^"
lifeisstrange,3cvhai,LilianH,1 point,Sun Jul 12 04:33:20 2015 UTC,They'll announce it on twitter when it's about to be released (https://twitter.com/LifeIsStrange)

lifeisstrange,3cvhai,memeisland,4,Sun Jul 12 17:58:50 2015 UTC,It's probably the developers or QA testing the game.
lifeisstrange,3cvhai,jessebona,3,Sat Jul 11 03:07:21 2015 UTC,"I thought about that, but I don't think they include developers in the metrics? In another game I play, there were issues with an achievement. A developer had tested the achievement in question to make sure it still worked, confirmed it worked, and the number was still 0%."
lifeisstrange,3cvhai,AnotherRandomFinn,4,Sat Jul 11 03:14:09 2015 UTC,"Beta players testing the game. It still counts them in the total even in beta. That's part of the testing process like any other part of the game, making sure the achievements record."
lifeisstrange,3cvhai,FilmingMachine,3,Sat Jul 11 03:14:26 2015 UTC,"There is an program which allows you to unlock achievments from dozens of games in steam. It's called ""Steam Achievement Manager"" (SAM picker.exe) I cant recall seeing LiS option in there, but i will check next time i get on my pc. Or they are just dev accounts.

lifeisstrange,3ctyyr,SomethingSimsy,16,Fri Jul 10 19:27:47 2015 UTC,The fact that they use similar slang is not that special they grew up in the same area. But wow they do have similar personalities and both have father issues.   Hmm makes me wonder who Nathan might have lost in his life.
lifeisstrange,3ctyyr,Uodoo,6,Fri Jul 10 19:43:49 2015 UTC,"I thought the same, but I thought I'd make a point of their similar slang anyway since everyone seems to actually have their own dialect (""hella"", as one example... xD) so it seems quite purposeful.  And I wondered the same! I'm hoping we find out in the next couple of episodes :D"

This is why I cosplayed her too. The thing is, I also cosplayed Nathan. Wanna know why? 'cause he's my second favorite character. The longer I played, the more I feel like if I'd take 50% of each one of them, that'd be me down to a t. So yeah, I'm completely with you with this."

The first time we meet Chloe and Nathan, Chloe is bullying Nathan and making fun of his personality and threatening him with his family i don't care what Nathan did Chloe is being a huge cunt and that scene  Besides, we don't really know Nathan sides of the story all we know for sure is he is a bit off, no prove he drugged Kate, no prove he did anything to Rachel or Chloe."
lifeisstrange,3ctyyr,SkateboardCop,2,Sat Jul 11 01:15:04 2015 UTC,"To be fair, in Chloe's perspective, Nathan drugged her. She got her bearing a bit as he was leering over her with a camera... one could probably conclude what she assumed was going to happen had she not kicked the lamp over and ran out.   Whether Nathan was going to do that or something else will probably be discovered soon enough."
lifeisstrange,3ctyyr,SkateboardCop,2,Sat Jul 11 02:41:12 2015 UTC,Nathan reacts to be calling a spoiled rich kid by shooting someone but Chloe is the cunt?

lifeisstrange,3ctyyr,FilmingMachine,2,Sat Jul 11 13:08:03 2015 UTC,"ok but his reaction is to pull out a gun and shove it into her gut, which absolutely means he intended to shoot her. Like I don't care if he regretted it after the fact, when you start waving around guns you better be ready to deal with the outcome of somebody getting shot."
lifeisstrange,3cuw3p,wizhards,14,Fri Jul 10 23:43:06 2015 UTC,"Its not that we have waited the most, its just that Dontnod has put the most douchiest cliffhanger at the end of Ep3 that anyone has ever made.

I am so anxious, I just spent the last 30 minutes yelling and whining to my boyfriend about how badly I need to play ep4.  actual conversation:  him: ""Just play another game! You haven't even played The Witcher yet!""  me: ""BUT THE WITCHER DOESN'T HAVE CHLOE IN IT"""
lifeisstrange,3cuw3p,sleep_hero,2,Sat Jul 11 06:38:44 2015 UTC,"Thw Witcher is an amazing game though, so you really should get started on that!  Besides, I doubt they will release any more info during the weekend."
lifeisstrange,3cuw3p,Geracir,2,Sat Jul 11 08:15:39 2015 UTC,"Yeah I think the fact that the whole week went by with no news made me upset. But it's really okay, I was just being a baby. Honestly I would rather them release a perfect product later than release something buggy sooner. It's just that I'm a little too invested in the story and it's making me super anxious...but I'm still going to play The Witcher, I loved the second game and from what I've seen the third one looks even better, like a billion times better."
lifeisstrange,3cuw3p,sleep_hero,2,Sat Jul 11 08:48:50 2015 UTC,"I do know the feeling, I also have a habit of getting too invested in stories at times and that wait can be awful. One of the downsides of episodic gaming, but on the other hand, if we didn't have this wait between each episode we probably wouldn't appreciate it so much when we get to play it.  And yes, Witcher 3 is much better than the second one in almost every way. I actually classify it as one of the best games I've ever played."

lifeisstrange,3cubnc,thefifthring,7,Sat Jul 11 02:56:31 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure Max carries the supplies back even though we can't really see it. And perhaps the waters and pipes are made in a certain way that when it's used in multiple succesion water elsewhere is drained; you get what I'm saying.
lifeisstrange,3cugg8,Mercyva,7,Fri Jul 10 21:40:56 2015 UTC,"It's an interesting interpretation, but I have trouble agreeing with all of it. Naturally, it could just be wishful thinking since I don't want either character to die, but it just seems too obvious to me. The first thing anybody thinks with a story like this is ""So who dies in the end?""  But this is a game about life. I mean, it's in the title. Life and the choices you make about how to live it. Max needs to learn to take chances, to try new things and stand up for herself, and not regret past choices. Chloe needs to learn to take responsibility for herself, to not look at friendships and other relationships as some kind of ledger adding up how many times they've fucked her over. Like Max, but for different reasons, she also has to learn not to dwell on the past. And it's also a game about enduring friendship, about how Max and Chloe complement each other and are stronger together.  To me, this is a coming of age story. These two girls are learning who they will be as adults. But all of those lessons seem a little purposeless if they're learned in the few moments before death."
lifeisstrange,3cugg8,kronj,3,Fri Jul 10 22:44:59 2015 UTC,"i know its a coming of age story. i just wanted to tell you that this game have a story. yes, we have a HUGE say on what happen in it, BUT it had a set story to tell. meaning that yes we can save kate or let her die, but we cannot change how certain selfies that max take, we have no say in that. also the tornado visions, PLUS the photo-focus scene. we have no say in that. my point is that yes we have a huge say in what to do, but dont forget that the developers have a story to tell too. we are just making our own story within it! i have no doubt that we will get to choose what ending we want, but i think the developers have their own one too. that we will experience regarding of our choice. say maybe we get to save chloe or let her die OR have a happy ending or whatever, but what if max is already dying? or dreaming? yes we get our own ending. but what if its what max wanted to believe it happened? choices that OUR max wanted to make but couldnt so when her life flashed before her eyes she made sure to make the things she always wanted to make? plus how can you explain her powers? ... i've seen interviews that the dev cried during making of EP4.. while i agree with you that you want a happy ending, but thats a part of ''growing up'' its not a happy sparkle fairy dust kind of world. i think its fitting that way then getting a ''Happy Ending'' ... thats just me. it would be more realistic. yeah, i respect your opinion but i dont think i agree at all :)"
lifeisstrange,3cugg8,kronj,1 point,Fri Jul 10 22:58:03 2015 UTC,"We can agree to disagree. :)  You're completely right that Max is her own character. She's not just a blank slate. And some people have complained about this, particularly about the end of ep3. Changing the past to such a degree is an obviously misguided action that most of us would not take. But equally obviously, it's what Max, left to her own devices, would do in that situation. Max is terrified of rejection, and she just lived out her worst fear with that argument in Chloe's truck. It's perfectly consistent with her character to just try to take it all back and forget the whole thing, even though we, the audience, realize it's not as bad as she thinks. That's the tragedy of it.  Anyway, about the end of the game, I'm just glad they've got Christian Divine on board. He's an actual writer and I'm certain he  knows the difference between pure shock and catharsis. I have faith that the ending will be satisfying, whether it's completely happy or not."
lifeisstrange,3cugg8,GymKerry,1 point,Sat Jul 11 20:20:56 2015 UTC,"could not agree more. and i didnt think max knew better, she saw her friend hurting bad, what could go wrong? just a simple rewind and fix things, but thats not the case. sometimes our heartaches is there simply to guide us to happiness. poor max, nothing she can do to make chloe happy again, and i think chloe will be fine. time heal all wounds, she just need to stay with her and help her through her problems, all you need is a true caring friend!  and yes regarding christian, i have no doubt that they will make a good job with the endings! i hope so.."

Obviously, there are also real-world stories similar to Kate's but the ""leak"" is one that most, if not all of us, know about already.  Just like how people could come across that link in the showers and check it out of pure, morbid curiosity, many did the same with the celebrity ""leaks"". Regardless of whether you went to check it out to get off on the fact that one/a single woman's privacy had been violated so severely or just out of morbid curiosity....... the end result is the same: by looking it up, you create a demand for the content.  I think the website itself isn't meant to be a part of the game. I think part of it was that the domain was taken by the creators so some other company or the like couldn't take it and then put whatever they want up. The creators of the game decided to put that little blog post up, kind of like a looking glass.

lifeisstrange,3cr6pv,superted6,2,Fri Jul 10 12:07:01 2015 UTC,Same experience for me.   Life is Strange is much more interactive imo though. Seems like your decisions are much more impactful than the Tell Tale releases.
lifeisstrange,3cr6pv,Vallavi,2,Fri Jul 10 14:52:37 2015 UTC,"What I find strange it that I never had that feeling with the Walking Dead. Never played The Wolf.

lifeisstrange,3cr6pv,dragsaw,4,Fri Jul 10 10:20:00 2015 UTC,"Waiting like this is making me anxious, like you are standing in line for the toilet, never knowing if it will take the person occupying it 10 seconds or if they're taking a 2 hour shit. Your urge to urinate is pressing on and you have no idea when release will come. It's horrible and you end up wondering if you could ease the pain by peeing yourself a little."

Often when companies set dates and happen to not meet them, one of the two options precipitate:   It's not done? Meh, just put it out anyways. Chapter ends up sucking (or has glitches). Just reschedule the release date. They can wait. A chorus of groans and disappointment emanates from this subreddit ;P   They spend the time necessary to create this wonderful game. Makes it more of an art piece for me."

lifeisstrange,3ctlsh,kronj,5,Fri Jul 10 17:58:11 2015 UTC,"A key part of Max's personality is that she is an introvert and tends to second-guess herself into paralysis. If the writers wish to show that she's grown as a character, then she will have to be assertive and decisive at some point in the game. The rewind power is teaching her the habit of speaking up and taking action, until she finds she doesn't need that crutch anymore. It's her character arc.  Chloe's arc will probably involve the issues of responsibility and sacrifice. So far, she's taken little responsibility and asked Max to make every sacrifice. If she is to grow, she'll have to turn that around and do something selfless for Max. Really, I just want to see her come to Max's rescue for once. And I hope she isn't supposed to die at the end."
lifeisstrange,3ctlsh,JC_Phoenix7,3,Fri Jul 10 21:29:36 2015 UTC,"Yup i agree, Chloe didn't show too much of selfess acts and thoughts towards anything.But when she says in the first episode to Max that she knows that her birthday was last month(after Max leaving without a word for years) and gives her the camera, it's indicates that she really cares for her loved ones, just got other things in her mind, and  she is confused, and probably have no clue how to be off-guard and careless with a friend..........or girlfiriend( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)"
lifeisstrange,3ctlsh,AERXihu,3,Fri Jul 10 22:26:54 2015 UTC,"I wonder if it will be influenced by another wardrobe change, I mean ""Max Amber"" was pretty badass standing up to David, spilling beans/soda, exploiting her time travel abilities to screw with people, and even mouthing off to Chloe. I wonder if ""Vortex Max"" is going to embrace being a bitchy cool kid at any point."
lifeisstrange,3ctlsh,FilmingMachine,3,Sat Jul 11 00:24:54 2015 UTC,"I hope so. Maybe ""Vortex Max"" will show why Victoria is the slave and Max is the master in that timeline."
lifeisstrange,3ctdz2,DakotaTM,13,Fri Jul 10 16:55:25 2015 UTC,"I actually think that theory is completely impossible and sort of ill thought out. Rachel and Max existed on the same timeline, just in different places. While Rachel was with Chloe, Max was in Seattle. And Max didn't discover that  she could rewind time until after she saved Chloe and Rachel had already been gone for six months. Not only that, but Max and Rachel look nothing alike--Rachel has an hourglass body and is blonde with hazel eyes, and Max is less curvy and a brunette with blue eyes. Besides, having two selves exist on the same timeline is a sure-fire way to destroy reality."
lifeisstrange,3ctdz2,satanslittleghost,8,Fri Jul 10 18:54:24 2015 UTC,"Plus they aren't even the same age. Rachel is 19, and Max just turned 18."

lifeisstrange,3ctdz2,FilmingMachine,3,Fri Jul 10 18:40:12 2015 UTC,It makes more sense for Max to be Rachel than the Homeless Woman and Max being the same considering you don't even have to talk to the Homeless Woman (she is optional conversation)
lifeisstrange,3ctdz2,AERXihu,2,Sat Jul 11 01:58:38 2015 UTC,Yeah.. She is just there to had more to the game or theories in general :) I was just mentioning a theory.
lifeisstrange,3ctdz2,FilmingMachine,2,Sat Jul 11 02:57:39 2015 UTC,"It's an idea that's often brought up. It's true that it gives a kind of Hitchcock/ David Lynch plot twist, where several characters are different parts of one single individual...and stuff.  But really, Max is a kind and considerate person, even if a little unaware of her surroundings at times. Rachel is the center of everything, yet she's proven to be selfish, manipulative, and a liar. Rachel is the one who left Chloe after several years at her side. Max is the one who came back to her, ready to make amends for her absence. In the end, I think they are foils to one another, and maybe even foes.  Plus they have different dates of birth, and Chloe actually had sleepovers at Rachel's place and knows her parents. If Rachel is Max, they have some crazy explaining to do..."
lifeisstrange,3ctdz2,Summerfell1,2,Fri Jul 10 17:42:51 2015 UTC,URGHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH THIS AGAIN.  I highly disagree with this theory.

lifeisstrange,3ctdz2,centerflag982,0,Sat Jul 11 02:35:44 2015 UTC,"I had a similar thought I posted a few days ago. Original Comment Thread  I think there is a fair shot at them being the same assuming that Max can have two different versions of her self in the same time line.  I think a lot of the game revolves around her saving Chloe.  So I'm fairly set in the idea that if she came back to act as Rachel and be Chloe's friend in her time of need it was to once again to save Chloe, likely from herself.  Also there are other evidence such as them being both the same size when Max needs some clothes in EP 3. They also look similar barring makeup, hairstyle, clothes, and tan."
lifeisstrange,3ctdz2,narcolepticnine,3,Fri Jul 10 18:14:22 2015 UTC,How do we know Max can have two different versions of herself in the same timeline? Proof please.  Max doesn't wear makeup from what I know. She wore Rachel's clothes (their styles aren't the same) Max has short hair while Rachel has long hair. About the tan i never noticed.
lifeisstrange,3ctdz2,AERXihu,1 point,Sat Jul 11 01:57:17 2015 UTC,"I was pointing out that having 2 Max's is what this scenario requires, not that I had proof.    Max doesn't wear make up.  Rachel does, or seems too. I was contrasting from the other direction. I'm hypothesizing that Rachel is Max after she had fully mastered her time travel abilities and purposefully altered her style and appearance to not look like herself.    Granted about the only thing I could say with over 50% certainty is that if we are going to meet Rachel, it would likely be in EP 4 as I would imagine she would come with massive plot that would be concluded in EP 5.    So hopefully in a week or two we will know."

lifeisstrange,3covut,Larkoz,5,Thu Jul 9 16:57:40 2015 UTC,"oh my GOD. Bastards.  I don't think the release will be on the 14th. The 14th of July is a public holiday here in France, it's the National Day of the country. It will most likely be later in the month."
lifeisstrange,3covut,ryuguy,4,Thu Jul 9 19:47:08 2015 UTC,"They said the development time for each Episode is scheduled between 6 to 8 weeks. Therefore, Bastille Day is technically their last day. (but I guess the 15/16/17th shouldn't be a big deal)"
lifeisstrange,3covut,Summerfell1,3,Thu Jul 9 21:37:37 2015 UTC,"In North America, video games usually release on Tuesdays. Bastille Day is on a Tuesday."
lifeisstrange,3covut,sieglindis,2,Thu Jul 9 22:30:14 2015 UTC,"I don't think they're really gonna hold up the international release of the game for a National Holiday. Seems like a huge commercial oversight. Plus, some people from Square Enix are probably there to back them up on the game's reception.  (Am I a bad french person that I only care about Bastille Day because of the fireworks? And LiS>>>>>>>>Fireworks)"
lifeisstrange,3covut,sashimi_taco,3,Fri Jul 10 02:59:53 2015 UTC,"We'll see. After all the 14th of July is not the official date, it's just speculation. If we were to place bets, i'd place mine on the 17th. Or even on the 21, maybe ! (And don't worry, I'm as bad as you are, the only thing I care about Bastille Day are the fireworks and free clubbing haha)"
lifeisstrange,3covut,AwesomeDewey,3,Fri Jul 10 09:44:15 2015 UTC,Why would a game release not be on a holiday? That seems like the best time to do it.
lifeisstrange,3covut,sashimi_taco,6,Thu Jul 9 21:38:31 2015 UTC,"They need people on deck and ready to handle the massive amount of people suddenly submitting their stats and playthroughs to their servers at the same time, and they need to monitor reactions just in case.  At the end of the day, it's a matter of budget and availability of their team. If they have enough people ready and willing to work overtime on the 14th of July for an episodic release, and if they have the cash for double the wages, and if they feel it's worth the added cost and risk, then yeah. But they're used to releases on working days midweek at noon, and I don't see a convincing reason to change that."
lifeisstrange,3covut,lislislislislis,1 point,Thu Jul 9 22:32:27 2015 UTC,Is that how holidays in France work? I have no idea.
lifeisstrange,3covut,AwesomeDewey,2,Thu Jul 9 23:50:40 2015 UTC,"French labor laws are really strict about this stuff. And culturally, I don't think there's much encouragement to work long hours.  For example, the holiday falls on a Tuesday, and they figure it's silly to have them take the weekend off and then come back for Monday and then take Tuesday off. So most people will get to take Monday off too, just because. It's called ""faire le pont"", literally building a bridge."
lifeisstrange,3covut,sieglindis,4,Fri Jul 10 01:05:18 2015 UTC,"French labor laws are really strict about this stuff. And culturally, I don't think there's much encouragement to work long hours.   Yeah it mostly depends on the industry but the current state of mind is definitely that working should be an all-and-nothing deal; maximize commitment and productivity during working hours, and in return you are practically entitled to say ""fuck you"" to your boss as soon as your shift is done, until the next working day.  It's far healthier than it sounds, as it empowers good management practices.  With regards to long hours, there are some people who are zealous, feel empowered by their job and have a strong emotional tie to their work, or simply need a metric ton of money. These are the ones who ask for overtime.   It's totally fine either way, both behaviours are acceptable. By default though, zealots rarely keep up their productivity throughout their carreer, and are often advised to take it easy, not only for their sake, but for the sake of their non-zealot peers who might be stressed out by their workaholic colleagues.  As an aside, the Telecom sector is especially terrible in that regard in France. The mindset in that industry is that everything is a problem, it's riddled with negativity. You're never ""progressing as planned"", at best you're ""still not done"". You're not a ""problem-solver"", you're a ""former problem-owner"". You're never ""finishing earlier than expected"", but rather ""a bad planner"".   The suicide rate in the Telecom industry in France is sadly off the charts. This shit is fucking dangerous to zealots, and I talk from experience."
lifeisstrange,3covut,sashimi_taco,4,Fri Jul 10 09:25:45 2015 UTC,i came to this subreddit for time travelling ladies and i left with a better understanding of french labor culture and the telecom industry  the internet is a magical place
lifeisstrange,3covut,Sebehr,3,Fri Jul 10 13:35:05 2015 UTC,"Technically, a holiday is a day where you don't work or do anything work-related. I don't know, it makes sense to me. To be honest I'm a bit skeptical over the devs respecting the schedule. If the episode was going to come up next week, the date would have been announced by now right ?"
lifeisstrange,3covut,jessebona,2,Thu Jul 9 22:44:47 2015 UTC,I just want to believe.
lifeisstrange,3covut,raiko39,2,Thu Jul 9 23:50:04 2015 UTC,"If it was a holiday that no one takes off for, sure. But it's kind of like releasing a game on Christmas in the US or something. Everyone who can take off, does, so there would be minimal staff there. Launching a game is a pretty big thing. They need people there to monitor for any technical issues."

lifeisstrange,3covut,GymKerry,3,Fri Jul 10 03:12:42 2015 UTC,"Nine days for episode two, six days for episode three. This would be the closest they've cut it yet if it's coming out next Tuesday. I'm guessing the 21st at this point."
lifeisstrange,3covut,koyl,5,Fri Jul 10 03:27:15 2015 UTC,Releasing on 21st or 22nd breaks their 6 to 8 week promise.
lifeisstrange,3covut,unique616,2,Fri Jul 10 03:55:13 2015 UTC,I think that's a good sign.   Maybe they're confident in the episode and it's pretty much done by now. :)

lifeisstrange,3cs6h9,sugakiwi,1 point,Fri Jul 10 20:11:55 2015 UTC,"I think Max power creates the tornado and if not makes it stronger (throughout the episodes things get worse with random eclipses, random snow, and also dying animals.) This is because Max has the tornado vision before her power. What if that was only a nightmare or something telling Max what will come. Once she gets her powers she starts tampering with fate and everything the universe stands for. The universe strikes back creating a deadly tornado strong enough to wipe out all of Arcadia Bay (including Max) to put an end to her powers.  This is something I doubt and since I have more thoughts about this stuff Ill use this as a backup."

Also the number of easter eggs the developers put in the game makes it so we can have many, many interesting which is a great thing too in my opinion. The game is just perfect, I can't think of any flaws to be honest :D  I want the code more than EP3 SPOILERS"

I've been on YouTube, on the channel of one of my favourite Lets Players, and saw that he started a new Lets Play - Life is Strange. Watched it a bit and came to the conclusion that I NEED this game. 2. Whats your impression of the game so far? From what I've seen on YouTube and reading some spoilers (fuck me, shouldn't have done that, but it just happens when you're around this subreddit), it's awesome, probably one of the best games ever made in my opinion. 3.

I've been around here for a while, but just now thought I would create an account when I saw this post :) This community is just so friendly, helpful and heartfelt, haven't seen much like it, to be honest :)  1: The first reveal trailer, around 6 months back. I was just mesmerized by the setting, atmosphere, art style and the characters! I also love the voice actors, they're really doing an amazing job pouring their heart and soul into these characters! It is just.. such a unique game. Also, I cannot forget to mention; the soundtrack! It is so nostalgic, emotional and never fails to give me a sense of wanderlust, just impeccable. No other game has done this to me, and I have only played Episode 1, fantastic! :)  2: It seems to have delivered on all fronts, a great story, wonderful landscapes filled with realistic three dimensional characters surrounded by great mysteries and just astonishing music.  3: I would say all those combined, but then you also slap in creepy Samuel hunting squirrels and Chloe's longing for Rachel!"

I think first time I heard about it was a bit after the game came out, I was mostly just reading the reviews saying stuff like 'would like this game if it weren't for the DEMONIC FEMINIST LESBIAN PROPAGANDA' which I found hilarious and obviously an over-reaction. After a while my best friend played it and it was awesome to see her relate to so many of the characters. I saw her post about it so much on her twitter/tumblr and sometimes she'd bring it up in conversation with me like ""Oh my god, have you played it yet? It's so good."" I then watched my other friend do a playthrough of it on twitch and thought god damn, this game is perfect for me because i'm always loading saves in games so that I can say everything perfectly to everyone & investigate every single thing in the game, and Life is Strange completely encourages that which is AWESOME.  2. Whats your impression of the game so far?  Pretty damn good, the characters and setting aren't really something you see a lot in games, and art style is just beautiful. I relate a lot to both Max (We're both photography nerds) & Chloe (We're both hella awesome). It's like an interactive angsty teen movie, and i LOVE it.  3. On a scale of Max taking a cute selfie, Chloe being badass, Warren being a geek or Victoria being a bit*h how much do you want the code? :D  All 3 combined plus how much I wanna find out what god damn happened to rachel, and thats a looot.

What was the thing that first made you excited/interested about LIS? I saw some videos of it before it was released. Thought it was a cool way of a game which is near reallife. I bought     season 1 shortly after release to try it out. Wasn't disappointed so I got a seasons pass. Basically the     announcement and the positive reviews made me interested about LIS. And of course the fact it's a tell-tale. 2. Whats your impression of the game so far? I like it, I can't wait for every episode to come out. It wakens up feels and these characters feel realistic and likable.     It's your choice what happens and the game is slowly paced and great if you want to be calm while playing. Also I love the music! 3. On a scale of Max taking a cute selfie, Chloe being badass, Warren being a geek or Victoria being a bit*h how much do you want the code? :D For a friend very much.

The characters are so fleshed out, and there's always some new detail to pick up on your next playthrough. I love books, movies, video games where there's an entire world underneath the surface of it. Like an iceberg underwater.

I absolutely love it, I've played through it 3 times as different ""Maxs'"" if you will, one of them was a normal play-through with lots of various decisions (my first play-through) and the others were as a really kind Max who always thought of other people, and the last was a really mean Max who hated everyone. Ugh, Im rambling lol.  TL;DR: I love the game and the art is really cute :)  I want the code more then Warren wants Max ;)."

lifeisstrange,3cr1lm,BladeMZ,1 point,Fri Jul 10 15:26:21 2015 UTC,"1. As a fan of Telltale's The Walking Dead, it only came natural that I was interested with LIS and its story driven gameplay. During a bland week months before graduation and post secondary, I stumbled upon LIS on Steam. Bored of all the other games I usually play I decided to give it a try as the artwork seemed intriguing. I watched the trailer and that was what caught my eye. I finished the first episode and boy was I hooked! I even replayed it to make sure I didn't miss anything. Just like raw oysters, I tried it and liked it.  2. It's amazing to see how the choices you make in the game can change the outcome of the future. Most of the time I roam around admiring the detail put into the game, making sure I don't miss anything. The soundtracks are nothing less than amazing. The developers have done a great job making sure the music fits the atmosphere and mood. At times LIS had me in tears while at others I was content. I've found the characters to be very lovable as everyone is unique and contrasts adding many different flavours to the game. LIS has made me stop and reflect upon my own life on multiple occasions. The experience is surreal and I'm for the most part impressed.  3. Spoiler That's right I broke the scale!"

With the exception of Warren, we have had the chance to look at every other main male character with a candid but admittedly a limited view.  Broke into the Principle's office and talked to him drunk. Went through David's things in his house. Peaked at Nathan's hidden records and parts of his evaluations. Snuck into Frank's RV, got some background on his relationship with Rachel.  Hopefully we will get a chance to snoop on Jefferson and Warren in EP4, that should confirm or dispel the rumors currently swirling around them."

lifeisstrange,3cqbb7,X4217,35,Fri Jul 10 03:36:21 2015 UTC,"I liked Jefferson up until I heard the entire conversation with Kate in episode 2, and before watching the scene where you do blame Jefferson. And, although I am glad he turned down Victoria's advances, if you blame him in episode 2, he throws a subtle temper tantrum, blaming Max for being removed from the Every Day Hero contest. In contrast, when he was around his boss, he pretended to be mature about the situation, so to me he came off as rather two-faced. He's also quick to throw other people under the bus whenever he gets the chance, like Max if you blame him and David if you tell Jefferson about him before the phone call.  He's still pretty ambiguous, though. It's hard to tell what he's thinking, or to piece together his involvement. I think it's possible that he slept with Rachel, although it's equally possible that he didn't. Rumors are rumors and that's all. And again, while he did reject Victoria, we don't know why he did. Maybe he just isn't interested in her; maybe he's trying to lay low. Again, we don't know for sure."
lifeisstrange,3cqbb7,RasereiHojo,14,Thu Jul 9 22:54:26 2015 UTC,"I didn't have a problem with him in episode one, but he really made me dislike him in episode two. Victim blaming Kate, the whole ""she doth protest too much""... that was just really screwed up. It's bad enough to think that kind of crap and to rebuff an obviously depressed student, but to say what he said to Max, another student? That's not okay.  However... I don't know if he's the 'big bad', so to speak. He feels like a red herring for the binders, but who knows?"
lifeisstrange,3cqbb7,Sebehr,10,Thu Jul 9 23:40:01 2015 UTC,"That shit was why I heavily considered blaming him in the office. I think all three all culpable in their own ways. Nathan for drugging her and possibly date raping her. David for tormenting her since that day. And Mr. Jefferson.... for being a bystander and even blaming her in that conversation, especially to OTHER STUDENTS.   I think that is why we get the option to blame Jefferson. At first it made me do a little double take and I know many people are confused, as well. But when you think about it, isn't watching a crime and doing nothing really bad, as well? Especially when you are in a position of authority- to ignore a girl being sexually bullied is actually really horrific and shitty.   Just think if all of the people who choose to stand by or remain neutral on problems like this chose to actually speak up and out? To defend people like Kate? What would have happened if someone as well respected and adored as Mr. Jefferson had actually made a stand?   With the trio you get to place the blame on, they are all different sides of the crime. The instigator, the helper, and the bystander."
lifeisstrange,3cqbb7,koraat,11,Fri Jul 10 02:41:45 2015 UTC,"Yeah...I almost wish you could blame all of them because they all played a role in putting Kate up on that roof. No one in that room was innocent.  Mr. Jefferson actually really upset me because that's a person under his wing. She was his student and he saw her depressed every day. Then she is literally right there crying for help and, instead of being kind to her, he decides to blame her. That's just cruel.  If a kid is clearly distressed, as a teacher, you stop and you listen to them, and you try to make them feel better. I mean that's a good thing to do as a decent human, but especially as someone who works with young people. But saying ""You just did this for attention"" like...what? How could anyone think that is a good thing to say to a depressed, bullied young woman?"
lifeisstrange,3cqbb7,Sebehr,10,Fri Jul 10 04:27:57 2015 UTC,"He was likable at the start because they portrayed him as the cool teacher. Then we learned more about him and saw his other side and, really, he is a massive douchebag even if he isn't guilty of anything."
lifeisstrange,3cqbb7,jessebona,3,Thu Jul 9 22:56:17 2015 UTC,"I don't understand either, people keep saying because of how he acts in certain conversations but honestly he's just being realistic and cautious, and picks his words carefully.  Sounds like a solid realist."
lifeisstrange,3cqbb7,Zytherious,1 point,Thu Jul 9 23:02:54 2015 UTC,"Okay, but a solid realist doesn't victim blame. A solid realist doesn't tell other students that he thinks someone who is being sexually harassed brought it upon herself. A solid realist doesn't (even allegedly) have sex with students. A solid realist doesn't sit back and watch while staff harass another student. He isn't realistic and cautious, he's a complete victim blaming asshole."
lifeisstrange,3cqbb7,Courier-6,5,Fri Jul 10 22:10:24 2015 UTC,"Jefferson WAS the person I least suspected, which is why I'm suspicious of him."
lifeisstrange,3cqbb7,420fuck,3,Fri Jul 10 01:33:44 2015 UTC,"I kinda like him too, the way how handled Victoria made me feel that he is the good one... But there are too many theories that he is the evil mastermind and they may be true very likely."
lifeisstrange,3cqbb7,TAGsvk,14,Thu Jul 9 23:30:12 2015 UTC,"I think he was actually trying to help Kate and himself but it didn't workout like he planned. So here is my theory on Jefferson.   Lets start with facts   The Prescotts practically owns the school. The teachers give Nathan a very wide berth. The principal is covering for Nathan Jefferson is rich and famous. And he is a Star attraction at Blackwell. Prescotts are very protective about their image.   Next assumptions I am pretty certain about   Kate came to Jefferson about the video and about Nathan dosing her. She never stated it was about Nathan dosing her, but the morning discussion with Max lead to her wondering if Nathan hurt her or helped her. Kate's relationship with Jefferson is good up till that conversation. Otherwise he would not be a teacher that she goto for help. Blackwell needs Jefferson more than Jefferson need Blackwell. He is rich and famous he is not here because he needs the work. Jefferson is probably one of the few people in Arcadia bay that is very resistant if not immune to pressure from the Prescotts. Prescotts primarily apply financial pressure. Jefferson is rich.   Ok, Iffy assumptions now  I agree with with a lot of people  the folders are made by Jefferson, but I think they are for a different purpose.  At the end of the first episode we see the folders ending in Rachel. Then at the end of the second episode after the suicide/attempted suicide we see a new folder about Kate is being put together with a photograph typical of Jefferson's style.  I think Jefferson is actually here to investigate the missing girls either because he knew one of them or maybe one of them is his daughter... Those folder are the evidence he has collected on the Prescotts regarding each girl. He is putting a new one together on Kate after the dosing and viral video incident.  When Kate came to him for help, he discouraged Kate because he knows how ruthless the Prescotts are and wanted to shield her till his investigation is done. He did the same thing to Max for the same reasons.  Am I stretching it a bit in some places? Sure, but is it anymore of a stretch than the theories that he is some kind of an evil master mind I don't think so."
lifeisstrange,3cqbb7,Uodoo,3,Fri Jul 10 00:42:13 2015 UTC,"Very interesting. But still why would Jefferson doing this ? Well we can assume that most of that girls are not from Arcadia so person behind all this is most likely somebody who travel a lot - What is Jefferson. There is website in game that shows all missing people and there are not that many people. But we still dont know what everything are having Kate, Rachel and all that girls in common because if all that girls are from Arcadia well if like 1/4 of Arcadia girls were molested that would draw hella attention. If Jefferson is the ""good one that is made being evil by looking too good and normal"" well that mean that there is somebody else who doing this and I doubt that Prescotts are that influence behind Arcadia borders and Jefferson is the one who is travelling with that other persona. Still I hope that Jefferson wont be that obvious good and so evil guy, too cliché."
lifeisstrange,3cqbb7,TAGsvk,2,Fri Jul 10 00:56:10 2015 UTC,"Yeah that was my point. With so little information on him his motives is completely open to speculation. I just spun it in a completely positive direction because most people seems to be assuming the worst. Considering how the other characters are presented, Jefferson will not be the super spy I portrayed him as or the psychotic killer a lot of people assume him to be. The story might not even have a villain, just conflicting interest and differing goals between people, like life."

Most of ther people I know who play or have played the game have really jumped onto the 'Jefferson is so creepy' Train/BandWagon, They were comparing him to that one fellow from the walking dead, The quiet dude on the bus in...What's it called? 300 days?...Close enough. For some reason If he DID end up being behind one of the unsavory or at least, less than kind, events that have/had gone down, Them feels, that'd really suck Y'know?...cough Plus he's kind of a cute dork, so that would be a bummer."

lifeisstrange,3cqbb7,SteveJEO,1 point,Fri Jul 10 07:35:01 2015 UTC,"Insufficient information.  Initial impressions is that I don't mind him too much but then again I'm a photo nerd and recognised almost everything in that room so i'm starting with an inbuilt bias.  (I'm also wondering where their Digital lab & Dark Room is ~ odd we haven't seen it yet).  His treatment of Kate in EP2 was a bit shitty but may be completely understandable from a teacher's perspective.  (Teacher's in general hear an awful lot of false accusations so being skeptical is no surprise at all ~ remember he doesn't have the same information available to him as max does and you're playing her perspective.  His behaviour in EP3 was entirely in-line with someone who is not a complete dick even if you blamed him for Kate's suicide/attempt.  (In my opinion he shouldn't be going to the exhibition anyway ~ one does not fuck off in the middle of an attempted/achieved suicide investigation involving one of your own students for some half assed competition)  The argument in the car again is understandable given the context... It's easy to see they may have been blaming each others relative inaction. (Jefferson's body language said angry, the head masters said drunk)  All that said though there's obviously something they ~do~ know and sommit twitchy as shit is going on with the school staff.   Someone is assembling portfolios on missing students for some reason. Though it might be a small detail if Kate dies her 'folder' hadn't actually been finished which could imply investigation just as easily as something nefarious."
lifeisstrange,3cqbb7,Badewell,1 point,Fri Jul 10 09:01:13 2015 UTC,"My thing about Jefferson is that he's the king of yellow flags.  He never does anything he'd get in trouble for.  I don't think he sleeps with students, and I don't think he's got Rachel Amber in a sex dungeon/photography lounge.  All of that stuff would get in the way of maintaining his plausible deniability.  Victoria flirts with him every chance he gets.  It's not like he doesn't realize this, he isn't stupid or oblivious.  If he wanted to he could shut it down at any time (as we see in episode 3, I'll get to that).  But he doesn't.  Not because he's trying to sleep with Victoria, he's too smart for that and knows it would end badly for him.  But he loves the idea that he's still attractive enough to have high school girls throwing themselves at him.  That's what turns him on, the feeling of power and authority he gets when Victoria or any other student flirts with him.  He'll never cross the line with Victoria, because then he loses plausible deniability.  If anyone ever called him out on it he'd fall back on ""I never did anything, don't know what you're talking about, she was only flirting with me, how dare you accuse me,"" etc etc and he'd get away with it.  And it's not just to avoid getting into trouble, a huge part of his self-image revolves around not sleeping with students also.  He himself doesn't think he's doing anything wrong since of course he'd never sleep with a student, he's not a monster, he's not responding to Victoria because of his iron-clad control, he never actually did anything so it's okay.  He sees himself as a good guy resisting temptation.  If he has actually ever slept with a student, he probably found an excuse as to why it didn't really count and he's still a good guy.  Consider when he finally shuts Victoria down.  Not when she offers sex, because he likes that and he still barely has plausible deniability.  But when she tries to blackmail him.  Now it's time to be the responsible adult and explicitly reject her, when she's threatening his career and reputation.  Fantasies are fun and all, but she crossed a line and he's forced to end it.  Plenty of other attractive students at Blackwell.  He and Max never talk in episode 3 of course.  But we see that he blames Max for not getting to go to the photo competition when he talks to Victoria.  He has to blame someone, and of course nothing is ever his fault.  But imagine if they had talked.  An actual adult would take responsibility for their actions.  A complete jerk would take petty revenge.  Jefferson wouldn't do either.  He'd go for a passive-aggressive guilt trip, then pat himself on the back for not laying into Max like she deserves while moping about how things are so hard on him.  So yeah, yellow flags everywhere.  Nothing that would ever stick to him, but that's how Jefferson works.  I'm not a fan."

lifeisstrange,3cqcfd,lislislislislis,4,Thu Jul 9 23:25:52 2015 UTC,I don't think they split it into episodes for suspense. They were literally going bankrupt and needed the money from one episode to pay for the next.  Fortunately the game has basically saved the company.
lifeisstrange,3cqcfd,lislislislislis,3,Thu Jul 9 23:40:11 2015 UTC,"It was Dontnod. They were in ""judicial reorganization"" which is the French version of Chapter 11 bankruptcy (a judge is appointed to restructure the company, pay some debts, forgive others, lay people off, but without actually destroying the business).  The sales of this game got them out of it -- I don't know if all their debts are paid, but things are looking good moving forward."

lifeisstrange,3cqcfd,NKSCF,0,Fri Jul 10 09:13:27 2015 UTC,What do you mean? I thought Square Enix did fine. Especially considering how well their games tend to be.
lifeisstrange,3cqcfd,jessebona,3,Fri Jul 10 10:06:01 2015 UTC,Square has a tendency to offset quarterly losses in the Asia market by artificially increasing expected sales figures from western developers then blaming and holding them responsible when those figures cannot reasonably be met.  A good example would be the Tomb Raider fiasco where square blamed crystal dynamics for 'failing to meet expectations' when it sold over 3.4 million units in 2 weeks because they were trying to hide the losses they incurred developing final fantasy.
lifeisstrange,3cqcfd,NKSCF,3,Fri Jul 10 10:24:40 2015 UTC,"I'm so glad I'm not the only one that noticed the lip synching. Seriously, it's the only big flaw I've seen in the game.

lifeisstrange,3crmup,kronj,3,Fri Jul 10 06:40:24 2015 UTC,I think that is probably just because the developers didn't want to record Victoria twice with only slightly altered dialogue.

lifeisstrange,3cqzxu,Lukasstylezz,3,Fri Jul 10 06:28:49 2015 UTC,"I think episode 4 will definitely be the nadir of the game's story. And I have crazy predictions about how! Long post ahead.  First of all, there's all the graffiti that says ""hole to another universe,"" and Max mentions in her research in episode two that alternate timelines can exist simultaneously as multiple parallel worlds (can't remember exactly what it said, but it does reference the idea). We know that Max has gone to an alternate timeline, so what's left of her in the original timeline, if we assume that it still exists? My guess is she's vanished, just like Rachel.  Chloe isn't likely to take this well. Sure, she had a temper tantrum and drove off all bitter, but I'm sure she still wants Max in her life and will realize it as soon as she cools down. And then find Max gone without a trace. How is she going to take her two best friends ever disappearing in one six month span? She's terrified of being abandoned, of not really mattering to the people who matter to her, and now Max is gone too. She's going to assume she pushed away her last friend. What's she going to do then?  Well, the game has given you two opportunities to let her have a gun. We don't know yet why that's important, but the game certainly hasn't shied away from the issue of suicide. And Max has mentioned several times her fear of her power failing when she needs it to save Chloe, or not being there to rewind. Not to mention that ""I'm never leaving you"" foreshadowing.  I won't dwell on that anymore, and I'm likely completely wrong about that detail anyway, but basically, I think Max will come back to the original timeline and find that not all is well. What makes her decide to go back? Perhaps Alternate Chloe will be convinced of her power but then point out that Max is in the wrong place, in clothes that aren't hers surrounded by people she doesn't know, and that the Chloe she knows needs her. Who knows. You may have chosen to draw on the fireplace as proof, or taken a suspiciously well-framed photograph, or at least acted very strangely on an otherwise normal day when dad had to go pick up mom. Alt Chloe might remember that.  And what happens once Max is back, given the disaster of a day she's just experienced? There are not many required photos in the game, but I suspect all of them will be important given Max's latest power. One of them is taken on Wednesday morning in Chloe's room. ""Always remember this moment."" Max has that ticket to relive the day and do everything better than before. Just like in Groundhog Day, which the game references several times.  Yeah, I've given this some thought. Sorry for the long read, but I hope somebody finds it interesting."
lifeisstrange,3cqzxu,FilmingMachine,1 point,Fri Jul 10 07:12:13 2015 UTC,It was an enjoyable read.  I liked how you were more focused on the different chloes than max's part in this.  I'm still torn if I'd like to see a time skip upon max's (hopeful) return to the original time line.  It'd be pretty hard for max to take on knowing that she caused Chloe do something or to someone else while she was trying to help her.
lifeisstrange,3cqzxu,Grayson754,1 point,Fri Jul 10 11:52:17 2015 UTC,"Chloe's (unintentional) part in it has always been the tragedy of it to me. The last thing Max hears from Chloe is basically ""fuck everybody, including you"" in a moment of anger, and Max takes that right to heart, forgetting all about ""I'm never leaving you"" from the night before.  Max may simply lack the confidence to believe that Chloe is truly her friend after that fight, with the result that she simply wipes it all away. She erases punk Chloe and the last three days of getting her best friend back, gives all of that up for the chance of making her a happier person. I know many people are disappointed by the lack of agency in the last part of ep3, but we're not Max, we're just giving her a nudge now and then. And it's definitely what Max would do. It's misguided but believable, which is what makes it an effective story beat.  And I think she will need to be convinced by Alt Chloe before she changes it back again. Need her blessing, basically. Again, I think the catalyst will be realizing that Original Recipe Chloe isn't erased, but rather now just in a world where Rachel AND Max have vanished on her without a trace.  But it's all just wild guesses! I won't be surprised at all if the episode plays totally differently."
lifeisstrange,3cqzxu,DustyCupcakes,1 point,Fri Jul 10 16:48:21 2015 UTC,"If Max disappeared from the original timeline then does that mean there are two Max's in the alternate timeline?

lifeisstrange,3cqzxu,FilmingMachine,1 point,Sat Jul 11 02:30:26 2015 UTC,"There would be alternate versions of everybody, including Max. Alternate Max seems to be friends with Victoria, dresses in more expensive clothes, etc. But original Max seemed to somehow transition to the alternate universe and displace alternate Max's consciousness, taking over another Max's body. Hopefully that other consciousness returns if/when she leaves again. But I don't think there could be two original Maxes, so I'm assuming she vanishes from the original universe as part of the transition.  But of course I'm just making stuff up. It's just a gut feeling. If that's how it works, and if Rachel does have time powers as many people think, it would explain why she appeared to vanish. She messed with time like Max did and ended up somewhere else."

lifeisstrange,3cooez,Big_G_Dog,8,Sat Jul 11 15:27:54 2015 UTC,"I have two, one I think is pretty likely and then a wilder guess.  The entire game takes place during the storm on Friday and everything we've seen, aside from Max's ""visions,"" is flashbacks/rewinds. After all, throughout the game so far, we've seen that Max's time travel only goes backwards, and any appearance of her predicting the future is actually a result of rewinding. The biggest clue for this is at the end of episode one when Chloe touches Max's shoulder.  Every ""villain"" that's been pointed out to us so far is mostly a red herring, though several of them will still not be good people. Instead, the main antagonist will turn out to be Rachel Amber, and Nathan in particular will have reasons for what he's done that are directly related to her. I predict that episode 4 will end with this revelation, right after having finally found Rachel, leaving 5 for a sort of showdown. How much Chloe likes Max over Rachel (which episode three showed is something that's being tracked) will be a large factor.  Crazy but possible!"

It might be that the disappearance of Rachel Amber is about some mysterious spirits, just like Laura Palmer from the series. I think Rachel is likely dead. You saw a lot of ""wanna die"" graffiti in the junk car spot and I think it is written by Rachel. Maybe she just let herself die because she is too tired of living with a doubled life. The spirits haunted her n pulled her to darkness. It is just that the body is not discovered yet.   Nathan is like Bobby from Twin Peaks, which offers Laura drugs (but doesn't really like her). But why Rachel is busted for having drugs? Maybe Rachel did take drugs on regular basis, or maybe Nathan busted her?  Also there is a remark that Frank turns strange at a night that he spent with Rachel and Rachel wrote a letter to Frank that she doesn't like it. Perhaps this also has to do with the spirits."

lifeisstrange,3cooez,spamharrington,1 point,Thu Jul 9 17:49:25 2015 UTC,"Sorry for long post and two theories:  The first, Max's power isn't conventional time travel, but more like astral projection. We see this noticeably in the junkyard when she flashes forward to the vortex destroying Arcadia Bay. It's not like her body travels through time, to Chloe she just seems to go into a daze or pass out while in the future. When rewinding, she simply sends her mind back to her body in the past, but her mind always returns to her present self. The transition can be quite jarring as she is forcing the mind of that time out when she enters. When just rewinding, her mind goes through the normal passage of time, but when she goes longer distances back, the mind is drawn back to her present body. Its like if you stretch a rubber band farther it will snap back with more force/quicker than if you draw it back over a shorter distance. We see this when she goes back to change William's fate, she doesn't pass through the years again, she's instantly back in her present body. Anyways, knowing that she can travel through the photos and she can only send her mind back to change things, her true present self is really in the future at the destruction of Arcadia Bay. Her current timeline is one which she fails to stop the vortex, so she decides to start all over again at the moment she very first got her powers, sitting in Mr. Jefferson's class, taking a selfie. But, the distance isn't far enough for the instant snap back when she's done changing the past so she's stuck going through the past in real time, but just far enough to where her mind is trying to pull her back to the present, which is the flashes she's getting to the vortex. Explaining why she doesn't remember it, we see the pain flashes when she rewinds and her mind simply interpreted this as a really long rewind. The force from travelling back erases her memory. This continues until she can stop the vortex, perhaps looping endlessly. This is like when Chloe gets shot or hit by the train. How many times did she die before you could save her? I don't know if that made any sense, but it all sorta clicks together in my head, like a corkboard with photos and red strings attaching them.  TL;DR Astral Projection and Groundhog Day  Moving on  Theory two is a bit darker/sadder and less complicated, I think. The ending of Life is Strange will be a big plot twist reveal where Max was slowly dying the entire time. She's been shot by the local drug dealer or has retreated into her mind in the hands of a serial abductor. Her mind is slowly trying to piece together the events leading up to this event. The rewinding is simply her mind trying to recall the correct events of the past few days. The vortex is death coming to destroy Arcadia Bay/her subconscious. Her spirit guide,the doe, is trying to ease her passing by guiding her towards the vortex. I'm calling this crazy but possible, cause I really don't want it to happen, but it's not like I haven't seen it done before.  Yeah, I've had a lot of theories floating around in my head since episode one."

We know that Chloe hit up Frank for cash, and she was trying to do the same to Nathan before he shot her. I think Rachel decided to go to the source and hit up Nathan's dad. Maybe she had some sort of knowledge about Nathan/his family that his dad didn't want to get out. Maybe, if she actually did have a relationship with Jefferson, he told her something about how the Prescott's cover up Nathan's file and she had proof. Just something to threaten him with. He got pissed, and if his temper is as unpredictable as Nathan's (which is a huge possibility), he attacked her.   We know Nathan takes pictures. It isn't unlikely that his rich family has their own dark room for the photos. Maybe Nathan's dad panicked, and his Rachel (or her body, if he killed her) in their dark room and Nathan found her. It would explain the weird ass paper where he just wrote ""Rachel in the dark room"" over and over again. It could also explain why he's so shocked when he confuses Max for Rachel in episode 3."

I think Rachel has screwed with the timeline (possibly by saving Chloe first, possibly other things) and Max will need Chloe in order to fix it. Far from trying to kill Chloe, the universe has basically enlisted Max as her bodyguard. Or at least that's my prediction."
lifeisstrange,3covgs,kronj,2,Thu Jul 9 17:24:53 2015 UTC,"It's not the Universe that wants Chloe dead. Chloe wants Chloe dead. She has a knack for finding trouble and, at this point, is not even trying to get out of it. That's why she hangs with people like Frank, plays with guns, walks across an active train-rail.  Ever since the loss of her father she's tried acquire some agency over her life, because she feels helpless. Her smoking out is a way to acquire that agency. Her ""Wake and bake"" is a way of saying: 'I don't control everything, but this is something I can. So I will.'   The great irony is that when you saved her father, she still didn't acquire that agency because now she's immobile and in a wheelchair.  The hard question about it is the choice Max has to make, assuming you are able to go back and intentionally let her father die in an accident. Which Chloe is happier or will be happier as time passes? That's a difficult subject and the worst is that Chloe doesn't have any means of making this choice for herself.."
lifeisstrange,3covgs,DuKoninck,2,Fri Jul 10 18:29:24 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that all makes a lot of sense. I agree completely. And your last paragraph is really the central question going into episode 4. I can understand Max's desire to ""make"" a happier Chloe, but it presumes that original Chloe can never adjust to the death of her father, which doesn't seem to give her much credit.  I think we've already seen the solution in the game, though it might be seen as a bit of a copout. Max's research goes into both wormholes and the idea that Schrodinger's Cat (the famous quantum physics thought experiment) could simultaneously exist both dead and alive in two different ""time zones."" You can find all these clues in her room in ep2, not to mention the ""hole to another universe"" graffiti everywhere.  Sooo in other words, it's all about interpretation. We can interpret Max's actions at the end of ep3 as wiping out everything that came after that day and replacing it with something new. Or alternatively, maybe we should say instead that she's traveled (perhaps via wormhole?) to a different universe where William survived that day.  If that's true, and if you assume Max's consciousness has remained continuous, then in appearing to change the course of events, Max has actually just transitioned herself to an alternate universe, leaving her original universe unchanged... except that she is likely not in it anymore, having vanished perhaps much like Rachel did, and has taken over the body of her alternate self.  This interpretation also explains why Max keeps her inventory when she time travels, though the fact she traveled into her 13-year-old body is hard to explain. Maybe her rewind is a totally different power from transferring her consciousness into an alternate universe body, or maybe they use wormholes in different ways.  But if all that's the case, then two Chloes exist. There is ""her"" Chloe of the blue hair and angst, and then there's the seemingly better-adjusted yet wheelchair-bound Chloe. Changing what happened to William doesn't replace one Chloe with another, it just moves Max from one universe to another.  If we accept that, then the solution is pretty simple. These two Chloes will continue to exist regardless of what Max does. All we know is that she is in the wrong place, and that she has probably vanished from her original universe, leaving ""her"" Chloe alone and abandoned yet again. That makes the right course of action pretty obvious.  Alternatively, I could be completely wrong and spending way too much time thinking about a video game."

The tornado still destroys the whole town cause we saw that vision before saving Chloe so the only difference is that Max has to act alone.  And it would be too obvious. It's a cliché: Donnie Darko, all of the Final Destinations, Steins;Gate, The Time Machine (the new one). This ""Death is inevitable"" thing was used in many timetravel/supernatural movies,anime and so on.

lifeisstrange,3covgs,Uodoo,1 point,Thu Jul 9 16:45:29 2015 UTC,"To design a game about choices and consequences, only to have the plot be some kind of a deterministic loop seem kinda weird. I hope DONTNOD will make an ending that is both awesome and reflective of our choices."

lifeisstrange,3ck47k,DuckOfDuckness,7,Wed Jul 8 22:49:46 2015 UTC,French writing with a majority American commenting audience.  There's going to be interesting mix up's all over the shop.  It's not like France is riddled with puritanical sexual guilt or anything.
lifeisstrange,3ck47k,preparingupdate,2,Wed Jul 8 23:27:47 2015 UTC,But patriarchal values still rule the place here. (I'm french)
lifeisstrange,3ck47k,DuckOfDuckness,13,Thu Jul 9 00:32:50 2015 UTC,"If anything is fan service I'd say it would be the pool bit. The pool itself didn't really add much else but underwear. Max and Chloe could've easily been talking about life elsewhere in the school and get caught there instead.  But I agree that girls kissing isn't really out of the ordinary. It did add something to the story that another action wouldn't have. So there's not much reason to believe it was fan service, and neither is there about the pool bit."
lifeisstrange,3ck47k,dpekkle,26,Wed Jul 8 15:39:27 2015 UTC,I think the pool scene was mainly there so Max could change into Rachel's clothes.
lifeisstrange,3ck47k,DuckOfDuckness,3,Wed Jul 8 18:21:08 2015 UTC,"Hadn't thought of that, good point."
lifeisstrange,3ck47k,AERXihu,21,Wed Jul 8 18:56:57 2015 UTC,It added some sexual tension in my opinion between the two characters. You can see it in chloe's face when max gets changed. http://i.ytimg.com/vi/y_bDOTdT6D4/hqdefault.jpg
lifeisstrange,3ck47k,KaiG1987,1 point,Wed Jul 8 16:10:12 2015 UTC,"I still feel like that could've happened without the pool, but I guess it's one way to add tension."
lifeisstrange,3ck47k,DuckOfDuckness,3,Wed Jul 8 16:39:34 2015 UTC,It could have been shown while Max was changing into Rachel's clothing if we didn't get the pool scene.  But shouldn't wouldn't have a reason to change.
lifeisstrange,3ck47k,levir,22,Wed Jul 8 23:08:58 2015 UTC,"I don't really get this, because I don't think the pool scene was sexy at all. It was tender and sweet, more emotional than erotic."
lifeisstrange,3ck47k,DuckOfDuckness,10,Wed Jul 8 17:06:25 2015 UTC,"I mean fan service as in showing the two female leads in just underwear. Animes have beach day, LIS has pool day I guess."
lifeisstrange,3ck47k,levir,19,Wed Jul 8 17:08:17 2015 UTC,"I don't really agree with you there. The pool scene is not sexualized in any way. There's nothing there to encourage ogling, it's just a natural part of the story. I mean, yes, they probably could have filled that bit of the story in another way - but that's true of most of the locations. And there's something about water that brings out the childish aspects in a character, which I'm not sure we'd have gotten to see otherwise. Like when they're splashing each other, or Chloe is humming the Jaws tune."
lifeisstrange,3ck47k,DuckOfDuckness,6,Wed Jul 8 18:43:52 2015 UTC,"While it's not sexualized, you still see the two female leads in just underwear, which could be regarded as fan service. But as I wrote in my comment:   So there's not much reason to believe it was fan service, and neither is there about the pool bit.   What I meant is that if there is fan service in the game, it's not the kiss, it's the pool scene. But I'm not so sure there actually is (that kind of) fan service in it."
lifeisstrange,3ck47k,yarfmeister,2,Wed Jul 8 18:56:42 2015 UTC,"Ah, I missed that bit. I guess we're mostly in agreement then, there's not really any fan service. Though I appear to have liked the pool scene better."
lifeisstrange,3ck47k,FilmingMachine,2,Wed Jul 8 19:02:13 2015 UTC,Same. I'm actually more happy that I've seen Chloe in swimwear/underwear/whateveritisshewaswearing than I am about Max and Chloe kissing.
lifeisstrange,3ck47k,Summerfell1,2,Wed Jul 8 19:06:13 2015 UTC,"To be honest with you, I didn't think too much of the kiss when it happened. It was only later when I came here and found everyone talking about it that the whole ""fan service"" idea occurred to me. It was just a part of the story to me while I was playing."
lifeisstrange,3ck47k,FilmingMachine,-3,Thu Jul 9 18:20:30 2015 UTC,"I agree with everything you said but that doesn't eliminate the possibility of it still being ""fan service"" or just something to have players talk about like in any other peace of art"
lifeisstrange,3ck47k,Summerfell1,10,Wed Jul 8 15:30:40 2015 UTC,"Fanservice is to catter to the fans. The kiss is a Major Choice, so it was planned long ago, when they wrote the simple script. And thus before they could get any kind of feedback from the fans. If it pleased the masses, so be it, but it can't be thought to be the initial purpose.  If anything it was more of a risk they took: even bigger games like The Last of Us got a lot of ignorant backlash for having that kind of content (regarding the Riley/Ellie kiss). And the Gamergate controversy is never too far."
lifeisstrange,3ck47k,koyl,3,Wed Jul 8 17:51:42 2015 UTC,When you say catter the fans... Doing as the fans ask or doing to please the fans?
lifeisstrange,3ck47k,FilmingMachine,3,Wed Jul 8 19:33:29 2015 UTC,"I guess both could overlap. But, if you really want my opinion (you probably don't :D) ""doing as the fans ask"" and ""pleasing the fans"" are very loose concepts. I mean, which fans? In the Life is Strange fandom, there is an certain number of fans who would like to see Max with Warren. And a huge chunk who like the idea of Max with Victoria of all people. Calling any scene with Max and Chloe fanservice would mean that Dontnod specifically chose to focus their attention on the number of fans who support the Chloe/Max pairing?  No, that would make little sense. All in all, it's like OP said: Chloe and Max's Relationship, and the kiss, is a narrative choice first and foremost."

lifeisstrange,3cl4qd,haircombsnightmare,3,Wed Jul 8 19:44:58 2015 UTC,"Well, I already own the game, but my buddy doesn't! I've been talking to him about the game for a long, long time, and just recently during the Steam Summer Sale I picked it up. He's been pretty excited about the game, but sadly, he's yet to buy it.   Some of the best choice based/story heavy games I've ever played are Mass Effect (the entire trilogy), The Walking Dead (Seasons 1 and 2), The Wolf Among Us, Heavy Rain, Beyond: Two Souls, Indigo Prophecy, etc. I feel like there's a few more, but I can't remember them off the top of my head. Oh yeah, and Knights of the Old Republic. I love me some Bioware. <3  But honestly, I wish everyone the best of luck with the drawing. I hope whoever this game goes to, they enjoy it as much as I have. This game has had a personal connection with me. Rarely do I get emotionally involved with games anymore (the last one being The Last of Us), but this game has made me feel ways I haven't felt since The Last of Us. It's made me think deeply, feel emotional, and immerse myself into this world that Dontnod has created. I truly believe that this game needs to be experienced by each and every gamer out there. Truly is a fantastic experience."
lifeisstrange,3cl4qd,Olddawnfades,2,Wed Jul 8 19:52:43 2015 UTC,You've just listed pretty much all the games I love! I'm also a huge fan of story driven games that play on emotions!  Just wanted to say this :P
lifeisstrange,3cl4qd,FooTew,1 point,Wed Jul 8 20:04:29 2015 UTC,Yes I will enter your name for your friend. I too was emotionally wrecked after The Last of Us. There have been a few other games(most of what you listed) since that I do really enjoy but not as deeply as TLOU and LiS. I wish video games were respected more. My (older)family members and most my 'friends' don't take them seriously at all and just scoff at my excitement and love of games. I'm so glad I have all of you to discuss them with. BTW I forgot to mention the draw date is tomorrow july 9th around 5:00pm Central Time Canada
lifeisstrange,3cl4qd,preparingupdate,0,Wed Jul 8 23:03:57 2015 UTC,"Indigo yeah it started simple about running away from cops, there was basketball and boxing some how along the way your gf dies and some mute girl carries the fate of the world. Near the end it suggests that living near Area 51(don't get me started on the camp sneaking sections that and the bookshelfs with the dates in the bassment or the old Chinese guy finding god knows what) and radiation while you were a baby had something to do with all this. And of course you have sex in a train, I forgot by that point if the black cop partner guy was still in the story"
lifeisstrange,3cl4qd,nikola_mihaylov,3,Thu Jul 9 00:27:13 2015 UTC,"Why havent you got this awesome game yet!?   The main issue I have is it's in dollars, and dollars are worth 9 pesos (my currency) each. I do have the money and I could buy it but I'm a bit scared of what converter Steam uses, since the price always shows up in dollars for me.    How long have you known about LIS? Did you see some of it on youtube?   I've known about it since around march. I found it while browsing cupquake's channel randomly, and I actually started from episode 2 (rebel!). I fell in love with all of it very quickly; storyline, graphics, dialogues.   Also have you tried any other choice based/story heavy games? What were they and how did you like them?   Choice based story, I've watched Beyond: two souls. It was excellent and just as LIS, I think it would have succeeded as a movie too. I found it a very sad and dark game at the same time, though. Definitely not for the sensitive.  I also like playing text-based games of the same style, such as alterego. It's quite simple but very entertaining.  I don't think I deserve you spending money on me and I think there are people who deserve it more, but I wanted to thank you for your generosity. Specially for those who really can't afford it. This is the second time I see it in this sub, and we're a small community. Awesome to know this game brings together people this nice."
lifeisstrange,3cl4qd,nikola_mihaylov,2,Wed Jul 8 23:14:41 2015 UTC,Beyond two souls is good yes! At first I actually watched it chronologically after attempting to watch regular gameplay. It was a little confusing watching it not chronologically the first time but I did go back and play through it normally. It almost was a movie with those beautiful visuals. And I am craving everything choice/story based so I will have to check out alterego. I tried psy high and it was a little different than what I am used to but it was good. It is also a text adventure.
lifeisstrange,3cl4qd,Oxygen25,3,Thu Jul 9 00:44:24 2015 UTC,"I've played the game the last few days and I'm so mindblown and really emotionally attached to every character. Kinda reminds me of the telltale games mixed with Donnie Darko. i also want to join for a friend of mine, who stands my huge monolgues about the game and is now also pretty hyped."
lifeisstrange,3cl4qd,Oxygen25,2,Thu Jul 9 15:08:45 2015 UTC,why haven't I? Because I'm lacking the funds  I've known about it since it's release. I have watched everyone that I'm subscribed to play it and I've even played a bit of it at a friend's  I love choice heavy games. One of the well known ones I've played is telltale's the walking dead
lifeisstrange,3cl4qd,catsrulebob,2,Wed Jul 8 20:19:20 2015 UTC,I love Telltales games too. That's what got me into choice based games. I forgot to mention I will draw on july 9th around 5:00pm Central Time Canada.
lifeisstrange,3cl4qd,CyberX95,2,Wed Jul 8 23:08:53 2015 UTC,"Can I enter for a friend? If not ignore.    Why havent you got this awesome game yet!?   Well, I did! Said friend got me into it. She was going to buy it in the summer sale but couldn't.    How long have you known about LIS? Did you see some of it on youtube?   I've known about it by name since before it came out. I was in no hurry to buy it until said friend told how great it is.    Also have you tried any other choice based/story heavy games? What were they and how did you like them?   Yep. I almost exclusively play story heavy games. So I can't list hem all lol."
lifeisstrange,3cl4qd,SirenX_EUW,1 point,Wed Jul 8 20:48:12 2015 UTC,Of course you can enter for a friend! Everyone needs to experience this awesome game! Also I will draw the name july 9th around 5:00pm Central Time Canada
lifeisstrange,3cl4qd,SirenX_EUW,2,Wed Jul 8 23:10:48 2015 UTC,"I'm just watching gameplay videos. I actually own only the first ep on Steam, but I would really want to buy myself the season pass. Unfortunately, my family is not financially good. I've been following this amazebals game since the first episode. Choice based games that I've played are The Walking Dead, both 1st and 2nd season and The Wolf Among Us. I recently played the XBL demo of Tales From the Borderlands too. Funny thing is, that my friends think that I am way too much into Life is Strange. I need to show them this subreddit..."
lifeisstrange,3cl4qd,SirenX_EUW,2,Wed Jul 8 20:50:02 2015 UTC,I am obsessed with LiS haha. I also love all of Telltales games. Most recent Ive played is TFTBorderlands and I think its great! Its got a lighter mood to it which is a nice change from their usual games. All my 'friends' don't take games seriously so I love that there is a community that is obsessed as I am :) Also draw date is july 9th around 5:00pm Central Time Canada

I simply love the whole concept and how the developers made it and the music choice and UGHH this game is too awesome for me to handle. I have played all of the Walking Dead games, they were great. You're a great person for making this giveaway, and even if I don't get it I want you to know we are all grateful for it."
lifeisstrange,3cl4qd,thetkaeo,2,Wed Jul 8 20:53:51 2015 UTC,"They made the perfect mix of real, genuine characters and cool supernatural powers. Even the environment feels so real.

lifeisstrange,3cl4qd,Ihitmymum,1 point,Wed Jul 8 20:57:56 2015 UTC,"Youtube playthroughs are a great way to test if you are interested in a game but I think its best when you can make your own choices. I forgot to post the draw date, july 9th around 5:00pm Central Time Canada"
lifeisstrange,3cl4qd,LethalityJ,2,Thu Jul 9 00:13:43 2015 UTC,"I haven't bought it because I'm poor :P. And I didn't have enough money during steam summer sales. I learned about LIS during this Christmas holydays. My friend received one copy of the game with the special Square enix christmas box. And next he immediately bought the pass. And started to tell me to buy it. Still I hate spoilers so I didn't watch any gameplay and such on youtube. I've played a lot of games focused on story. Like Mass Effect/ Dragon Age other heavily story focused RPGs. Actually I'm trying to get also the Telltale game ""Tales of the Borderlands"" but it's not really cheap :P. Btw Thanks a lot for the opportunity to try a great game.   I didn't reread the post so if I've had made any mistakes forgive me."
lifeisstrange,3cl4qd,robotboy199,1 point,Wed Jul 8 20:59:29 2015 UTC,I hate spoilers too. I first found The Last of Us on a youtube playthrough and after the first minute of gameplay I knew I had to get it and didn't watch any more of it. Its definitely worth waiting to experience it yourself IMO. I forgot to say the draw date will be tomorrow july 9th around 5:00pm Central Time Canada.
lifeisstrange,3cl4qd,Ihitmymum,2,Wed Jul 8 23:31:54 2015 UTC,Why haven't you got this awesome game yet!? I have it but a friend of mine doesn't. The application is from him posted from my account ( he isn't a redditor ):  My friend always tells me how awesome it is and how much fun it would be. I didn't want him to spoil anything to try out myself. But I don't have enough money left and don't want to wait another month.  How long have you known about LIS? Did you see some of it on youtube? I saw some pre-release trailers and thought it was a new idea. But I never imagined it to get out that positive so I waited. I saw some Let's Plays from episode 1 the begining ( german Youtuber called Gronkh ) but I stopped there to not get spoiled. I like the graphic style and was into it pretty fast. The only thing annoyed me is that he choose some decisions I wouldn't make. So I need it for myself.  Also have you tried any other choice based/story heavy games? What were they and how did you like them? No I sadly didn't but I will in the future. These games look like a lot of fun and the decision thing is probably the best you can do to a video game to make it as individual as possible. I already am thinking of the Borderlands Telltale after LiS.  Thanks for this giveaway very nice of you. It's a great community!
lifeisstrange,3cl4qd,Ihitmymum,2,Wed Jul 8 21:25:46 2015 UTC,"I too don't like watching whole playthroughs on youtube because of the spoilers. I think its best to experience it yourself for the first time especially with choice based games like this.   As for more choice based games, TFTBorderlands is really good. Its a little less serious and more on the playful funny side haha. Telltale has lots of cool choice games, my favorites being The walking dead, the wolf among us, and game of thrones.   Heavy Rain is good too and your choices can even lead to deaths at almost any point in the story. Beyond two souls is sweet too. There are so many but yes I think LiS then TFTBorderlands is a good choice. A really good game I suggest is The Last of Us, its not choice based but the story is soooo good it doesn't matter. It was the first(and only other than LiS) game that seriously effected me.   And I forgot to mention I will draw on july 9th around 5:00pm Central Time Canada"
lifeisstrange,3cl4qd,TLGorilla,1 point,Wed Jul 8 23:45:42 2015 UTC,The Last of Us! Totally forgot it. We both don't have it and that game is probably on our list. Heard great of it and I'm pretty hyped even though it's a bit older now :)

A guy I follow on YouTube upload Episode 1 gameplay and I watched the entire episode at the same day. A few days after that one friend show me the game and let me play every time an episode is released!  Also have you tried any other choice based/story heavy games? What were they and how did you like them?  I played Gone Home and I liked it! I was always afraid someone could appear in one room or found an assassin hidden somewhere. xD I watched/played with my friend Beyond: Two Souls too, another ""must play"" game. :p  Finally, thanks for make this giveaway!! And sorry for my English. >_<"
lifeisstrange,3cl4qd,haXona,1 point,Wed Jul 8 21:36:42 2015 UTC,I love Beyond two souls too :) I had Gone home spoiled for me so i don't know if i would enjoy it as much if I did a playthrough on my own.

lifeisstrange,3cl4qd,FFaUniHan,2,Thu Jul 9 00:02:28 2015 UTC,"I've been wanting to buy this game for a long time but it wasn't on the top of my priority list. Now with the Steam Summer sale finished and buying most of the games I wanted, I did not have enough money to buy this game. Now it's #1 on my list of games to buy.  I've known about Life Is Strange since it was released and I haven't been following much about the game except for the release dates for each episode. I haven't watched any videos of it yet because I don't want to spoil anything.   I've played other games like this such as The Walking Dead Season 1 and 2, Wolf Among Us, all the BioWare games, Heavy Rain, and Beyond: Two Souls. I love games with great story (who doesn't?) and I am 110% sure that I am going to love this game.  Also, thank you OP for doing this. Even if I don't win this giveaway I am still looking forward to buying this game."
lifeisstrange,3cl4qd,keepcomingbackmanila,2,Wed Jul 8 22:27:37 2015 UTC,Ever since The Last of Us I have been craving story heavy games. I then came across Telltales games and that introduced me to choice based games. Now with LiS it is a perfect mix of choice and amazing story. Its something I wish everyone could experience. I will do the draw tomorrow july 9th around 5:00pm Central Time Canada
lifeisstrange,3cl4qd,Rynnline,2,Thu Jul 9 00:05:33 2015 UTC,Why haven't you got this awesome game yet!?   I'm picky with my money when it comes to games xD. I really do want to pick this game up but haven't yet.   How long have you known about LIS? Did you see some of it on youtube?   Since it was announced last year. Been watching a couple of let's plays.   Also have you tried any other choice based/story heavy games? What were they and how did you like them?   Played a bit of The Walking Dead (Both seasons) and The Wolf Among Us. Really enjoyed what I got to play. Both were very intense in their own ways.   Thank you so much for giving us all a chance to check out this game! Really appreciate it :)

lifeisstrange,3cl4qd,Maquatagi,2,Thu Jul 9 00:11:14 2015 UTC,I haven't gotten this game yet because i never really play games on my computer. I'd love to start play on my pc though and even if i don't win i'll probably try and get it on steam soon.   I've known about life is strange since it came out. i saw it on the xbox one marketplace and fell in love. i've watched people on youtube and twitch play it constantly.  Othee story based games i know about are The Walking Dead and The Wolf Among Us. The Walking Dead was a phenomenal game and have a great story. I have not seen the full playthrough of The Wolf Among Us but the storyline so far has been amazing and not to mention the bad ass art style.
lifeisstrange,3cl4qd,NeonDiscovery,2,Wed Jul 8 22:58:39 2015 UTC,"Telltale is great at making games! I loved both of those. Also you should check out Tales From The Borderlands. Its really good, it has a lighter humorous mood which is nice. But LiS and The Last of Us will forever hold a spot of my all time favorite everything. They had a big impact on me and I am so grateful I had the opportunity to experience them."

lifeisstrange,3cl4qd,todaylookslikerain,1 point,Wed Jul 8 23:42:31 2015 UTC,I do understand getting an unofficial copy but I would make sure to get the game from the company as soon as you can afford it if you enjoy it. Its important to support developers like this or there wont be any more amazing games like LiS. Dontnod was having financial troubles and we almost didn't have LiS finished. That would really suck! I admittedly don't buy music. I just listen to it on youtube. I go through so many songs I couldn't afford buying every one. LiS is definitely worth every penny and I'm happy to help someone experience it when I can.
lifeisstrange,3cl4qd,ryeong,0,Thu Jul 9 00:34:28 2015 UTC,"Don't fret all your monies would probably be put by square Enix to hitman(seems like they've given up on story), deus ex, tomb raider(the only good thing they have) along with final fantasy crap and ps4 exclusive RPGs, I mean it not like your money would support a sequel to remember me(sure the story made no sense but still it was original and it was a fun VIDEO GAME)..personally I got it when it was on the front page of kickass and through that site I got ep2 early"

lifeisstrange,3clu82,Hidden_thorns,13,Thu Jul 9 04:49:44 2015 UTC,I gotta say David. He's so much more complicated than just being a stepdouche and I can empathise with his situation and feel sorry for him. The guy is more than a little damaged from being a soldier and clearly not dealing with it. I hope he gets the help he needs eventually.

lifeisstrange,3cl9bl,goutthescout,9,Wed Jul 8 23:25:01 2015 UTC,"You'd think that would be all over the news. We don't really lose track of the moon. Furthermore there was a full moon that very night. So, it totally flipped sides of the Earth in a few hours. Maybe it wasn't the moon eclipsing the sun? Maybe someone else is manipulating time to some severe degree we are not aware of?  Edit: So after some research.... The next solar eclipse that will be visible in the US occurs on August 21st 2017 and would actually be visible in Oregon. Suppose that rewinding time is fairly local and doesn't affect the orbits of the Earth or Moon. If someone was rewinding a lot of time and/or doing so frequently no or little time could pass for the outside observer while the Earth might be jumping months or years ahead from their perspective. Could explain 80 degree weather in October followed by snow, the messed up migration patterns of birds, or an eclipse that shouldn't happen for 4 years.  Still gotta figure people would realize pretty quickly that something was very wrong, but who knows how the scientific community would react when suddenly discovering ""hey, the Earth is not where it should be"". The events of the game might play out before the real societal shockwave of that reaches us."
lifeisstrange,3cl9bl,FFaUniHan,3,Wed Jul 8 20:57:15 2015 UTC,"Maybe, someone is manipulating time in a specific area. Like manipulating earth or just Arcadia Bay to see something that shouldn't happen."
lifeisstrange,3cl9bl,SamuEL_or_Samuel_L,3,Thu Jul 9 14:26:01 2015 UTC,"Yep, the eclipse is easily a much more significant event than the storm.  We're talking about serious global consequences.  And the news report in Episode 3 indicates that the wider world is aware of the eclipse, but just put it down to weird weather.  So ... yeah, looks like it's just a bit of a flub on Dontnod's part?"
lifeisstrange,3cl9bl,SteveJEO,4,Wed Jul 8 22:01:16 2015 UTC,"Yeah, an unscheduled eclipse is so laughably impossible every scientist and astronomer on the planet would flip their shit... and then lots of people would die cos the tides would have just realised they were in the wrong place.  Remember though, you're seeing local events from the perspective of an insular 18 year old art student.  It's not like she's subscribed to /r/worldnews or /r/science.  There's nothing in the game suggesting the various reality cockups are actually confined to Arcadia bay.  All we know is that on friday the town gets flattened but the phenomena could easily be global. ~ and probably would be.  It wouldn't be too surprising to find that while the students are at the appropriately named 'end of the world' party the president is addressing the nation to give them some seriously crappy news."
lifeisstrange,3cl9bl,Gobblignash,3,Thu Jul 9 06:57:21 2015 UTC,"It's not like she's subscribed to /r/worldnews   Quite the shame, it'd an interesting twist if Max turned out to be a xenophobic racist who shitposts the same articles daily about ISIS and Russia."
lifeisstrange,3cl9bl,chronoflect,3,Thu Jul 9 19:01:19 2015 UTC,"The only probable solution I can think of for the eclipse is that it is the result of time slipping. For a short window, everyone saw the moon in a different time in its orbit. Maybe time is weakening or something, and that's also why Max's power suddenly appeared."

lifeisstrange,3cl9bl,Gopasson,1 point,Thu Jul 9 10:42:52 2015 UTC,"Can someone clarify. Could people only inside Arcadia Bay see the eclipse or were people outside the town able to see it also? From what it looks like, all these natural events are exclusive to the town."

lifeisstrange,3cl9bl,GrayManTheory,1 point,Wed Jul 8 21:59:44 2015 UTC,"We assume the object that eclipsed the sun was the moon because that's the only kind of eclipse we've seen.  A better explanation would be a rogue planet that happened to pass through our solar system at just the right time and trajectory - or, at least, that is the likely rationalized explanation in the LiS world.  It's hard to say why they went with an eclipse rather than some other celestial event that could be made equally dramatic, like a comet.  Maybe the eclipse will be the link between seasons and is the cause of all the weirdness.  Maybe there's some other folklore that ties to it.  The only thing I found that kind of relates to LiS is this Choctaw legend about a black squirrel that devours light (and the sun).  It might be a stretch, but I wonder if that's why there was a light out near where Samuel and the squirrels are."
lifeisstrange,3cl9bl,Uodoo,1 point,Wed Jul 8 22:48:06 2015 UTC,"For any kind of celestial object to show up, cause an eclipse, and not be noticed by ESA, NASA, RFSA,  CNSA or even the thousands of amateur astronomers world wide is kinda hard to believe. Make me think that this whole thing might just be in Max's mind.   Although the tidal forces of even a moon sized rogue planet passing between the earth and the moon would cause all sorts of weird/disastrous stuff to happen least of which could be a giant sea tornado. Maybe it came though a wormhole which is also responsible for Max's time travel powers."
lifeisstrange,3cl9bl,SamuEL_or_Samuel_L,1 point,Thu Jul 9 02:30:22 2015 UTC,"A rogue planet would be an even more significant event, and would be impossible to have missed.  Most of the planets are visible to the naked eye, so something of similar size would be easily spotted over the ~months it would take to pass through the inner solar system (think the time it takes comets to make a pass).  Further, we've done all-sky surveys with infrared observatories to effectively rule out any such object near our solar system."

It's been suggested that whales use the magnetism of the Earth to navigate, it has also been suggested that's how homing pigeons always find their way back.

Knowing how much of a scaredy cat she is, she could be trying to convince herself that she isn't into him to avoid starting something that could end bad and ruin their friendship. I've personally seen people be steadfast about not being interested in somebody... right up til the day before they start to date them.  It's all about how the player chooses to interpret Max."

lifeisstrange,3cjvum,Gopasson,3,Wed Jul 8 14:26:10 2015 UTC,"That may be true for a blank slate protagonist, but it doesn't apply to a game like LiS. Max is her own person, with her own backstory, her own personality and her own opinions that are mostly independent of you and the choices you make. You can influence what she does to a certain extent, and you may be able to influence how her personality is expressed, but your choices are limited to what Max could or would conceivably do.  Max could be gay despite you wanting her to be strait, or straight despite you wanting her to be gay."
lifeisstrange,3cjvum,levir,17,Wed Jul 8 18:54:50 2015 UTC,"As everybody is saying - you can make her to what you want. Yes, all that flirt between Chloe and Max can be understand like ""this is just joking"" but at same time as ""serious teasing"". And there are shitload of this and atleast Chloe seems pretty serious about this mainly in EP3. Untill that all this moments were from Max's side very open to interpretation (for oblivious reasons)   But first time when they had that first real ""akward"" moment was when Max bringed up that kiss in RV in case you kissed her. Max basically suggested to Chloe another kiss, Chloe went daydreaming next to the poster of two lesbian girls (what she didnt done if you didnt kissed her) and Max embarrassedly said something to break silence like ""we are on schedule so let's move"" aware of what just said."
lifeisstrange,3cjvum,TAGsvk,4,Wed Jul 8 15:01:18 2015 UTC,Whhaat when did that happen? Well good thing I was about to replay EP3 already. I can't believe I missed that!
lifeisstrange,3cjvum,preparingupdate,2,Wed Jul 8 17:00:43 2015 UTC,https://youtu.be/GmYGAjlpW6o?t=2h13m49s  nothing of that happens if you dont kiss her
lifeisstrange,3cjvum,TAGsvk,3,Wed Jul 8 17:43:28 2015 UTC,"Yes it does. She basically says the exact same thing if you don't kiss her. She just says, ""And you would dare me to kiss you again."""
lifeisstrange,3cjvum,dreamfall99,4,Wed Jul 8 19:10:34 2015 UTC,"""you would dare me to drive it as you dared me to kiss me"" jokingly Max said since she wouldnt never drive it - well ""you will dare me to do another stupid thing"" and ""and you will kiss me"" is pretty different dont you think ? also if you dont kiss her there is no daydreaming from Chloe so is oblivious what she was dreaming of. And whole scene doesnt had that akward vibe."
lifeisstrange,3cjvum,TAGsvk,2,Wed Jul 8 19:21:13 2015 UTC,The whole kiss scene is an awkward vibe. I feel the scence was just added for the damn Pricefield shippers. The whole kiss would have felt way more like a genuine moment in the pool!
lifeisstrange,3cjvum,dreamfall99,5,Wed Jul 8 20:00:23 2015 UTC,"I doubt that. Script and assets for the game were finished way before EP1 was released, what they doing now is just polishing, VA a Motion Capture - for sure they can add or remove some little things but they cant change or add such major event to the game, that doesnt have anything with fanservice.  On other side you saying it would be better in pool. Well that would mean start romance right there and that is too soon since if Chloe would dare to Max there - lol that would be hardcore - being naked in hot pool ilegally during midnight and even kissing."
lifeisstrange,3cjvum,TAGsvk,8,Wed Jul 8 20:31:51 2015 UTC,"At this point, I don't think Max's sexuality needs to be labeled. She's a teenage girl still coming out of her shell, she's still finding her identity. Maybe she's gay, maybe she's not, but I think it's pretty normal to explore those feelings.   Whatever her sexuality, I do hope pricefield is explored more. I think it's a really cute relationship."
lifeisstrange,3cjvum,Sebehr,15,Wed Jul 8 17:20:49 2015 UTC,"Being a gay as hell female, I feel some serious ""more than friends""  flirting between Max and Chloe. I don't really feel the need to put labels on either or any of them, Rachel Amber included. A connection is a connection. That's what seems to drive relationships the most in my opinion."
lifeisstrange,3cjvum,SnobbyLion,11,Wed Jul 8 15:41:54 2015 UTC,"Max mentions that she likes skater boys, but they don't feel the same way about her. While Warren likes her, I always felt that she doesn't see him that way unless you go out of your way to edge her towards him. I believe Max says that she sees Warren as her geeky little brother in her journal.  Max's interactions with Chloe can be interpreted as being more than just friends as I do. Especially some of their banter in Episodes 2-3. Personally, I think she's bi."
lifeisstrange,3cjvum,T_Snake451,5,Wed Jul 8 15:38:23 2015 UTC,"So, what do you think, is Max gay, straight, bi, or fluid?    I think she's 18 and has no real idea herself.  But with me playing her, there can be only one choice:  Chloe  waifu."
lifeisstrange,3cjvum,GrayManTheory,5,Wed Jul 8 17:23:05 2015 UTC,"Truth be told I think the devs knew that people would be imposing their own desires onto her anyway, and as a result deliberately made her a blank slate in terms of her sexual proclivities."
lifeisstrange,3cjvum,BobMugabe35,10,Wed Jul 8 17:55:59 2015 UTC,"People have already said this, but I'll say it again: she is what you make her. Max in my playthrough likes Warren, but did kiss Chloe."
lifeisstrange,3cjvum,fireTwoOneNine,3,Wed Jul 8 15:28:35 2015 UTC,"That's not quite true, because you can only make a choice that the devs give you. So if you never get the option to kiss Warren, then Max will never kiss him (or if she does, it won't be through your choices).  But there can't really be anything in the text to confirm her sexuality, because it's got to be written for both options - if you kiss Chloe, probably nothing will say that she really likes Warren, unless you do both.  (Although Max and Chloe having some sort of romantic history would make sense of her having to move to Seattle)."
lifeisstrange,3cjvum,athorist,9,Wed Jul 8 15:54:51 2015 UTC,"""Although Max and Chloe having some sort of romantic history would make sense of her having to move to Seattle""  It actually makes sense. It also explains why Max never kept in touch in with Chloe even in alternative timeline where Chloe was fine and William was alive, why Max never once questioning in her head that Chloe's general crush on girls and ULTRA oblivious hints that Chloe was in love with Rachel. Its like she knew that since day one. Also, pirates. Thats so big reference to Gone Home. Also it was bringed up too many times these ""pirates"".  I would be also hella plot twist."

They were lot in pirates as kids. Same as Chloe and Max when they were young. You can see that Max and Chloe had ""a fort"" in Arcadia, Chloes towel have pirate logo on it, also there are some photos of Max and Chloe in pirates suits and when you speak with Warren about ""your punk friend"" you can say ""she is just a pirate..."" what is quote from Gone Home too...

I know EP3 SPOILERS, but what they are forgetting is that Max is a person that we jump into and not our personal avatar. There are facets of her that are set in stone and layed out for us. Then there are others which aren't and we're allowed to mold her into 'our Max'.  In the end, with romance, it's left to the player to decide. Whether to have a romance option that fits them such as not having to end up with a guy if the player would prefer to avoid that, or if immature kids go ""hurhur 2 chicks, hot"", etc. having a variety of options can only enhance the player's experience. I just hope there's an option to avoid romance entirely."

Not because I don't like the idea of Pricefield, or because I don't think Max likes girls, but just because it never really occurred to me. I thought that their friendship was truly beautiful. Pricefield only got on my radar after I dove into this subreddit. I'm not opposed to it or anything. I actually like it a lot, and it makes sense to me. I honestly don't know what I'll do when/if the choice arises. But initially I never even thought of Max in terms of her sexuality. Gay, straight, bisexual, fluid, it never really mattered to me. I saw best friends, and that was all that mattered to me.   But of course now that I've been corrupted by this sub, I gotta say none of the above. Max is totally into lamps."

Lisa Diamond didn't exactly say that, to my knowledge, she said that some people have the potential to experience person-based attraction while some other people don't feel it ever.  ""I like to believe our choices can determine whether or not Max ends up with Chloe. It does seem they influence what Max says about boys."" I don't know if that's what DONTNOD wants, but it certainly would be refreshing to see a portrayal of a fluid, dynamic sexuality that doesn't fit into the dominant narrative of a fixed and essential orientation. Not that the latter is bad per se, it would just feel good to have some diversity =)."

She likes Warren- he's cute and a good guy, but ultimately she thinks Brooke is a better match for him. We've kissed Chloe, but I think my Max recognizes that Chloe isn't the healthiest choice in a partner. Max kissed Chloe because Chloe is attractive and kissing her honestly wasn't that big of a deal, it's not like she's monogamous with Warren or really anyone right now.  But some of the things Chloe has done and the things Chloe has suggested she would do make me (and I guess, Max through me) feel like Chloe is a rocky, selfish friend and probably not someone Max would want to involve herself with romantically.  There's also, I think, this pressure Max feels to please Chloe and to ""make things up"" to her, so if the option comes up to be romantically involved with Chloe I may or may not take it depending on how much pressure Chloe puts on Max. While Max might not feel it's the best choice, her desire to make things right with Chloe and her hints of jealousy toward Rachel Amber might cloud her judgement.  Annnnd now it's obvious that I've put way too much thought into my choices, haha."

lifeisstrange,3cjvum,spamharrington,1 point,Fri Jul 10 21:42:17 2015 UTC,"I honestly really don't think there is any basis to support Max being straight except heteronormativity, from the very first entry of her diary she makes sure to drop a line about how shes never been into boys, so if anything there are hints to the opposite. Since the game is choice based, and it looks like there might be a chance you could initiate some degree of romance with Warren, I guess that would put her more towards the middle of the spectrum, but my personal guess would be bisexual with a preference for girls if not straight up lesbian. Either that or asexual, as again she barely mentions being interested in boys so there is no support to the idea of her being straight.  Also the concept of sexuality being fluid isn't a different sexuality by itself, to some people sexuality is fluid which means maybe the identifies as one thing in the past, identify as another now and don't exclude identifying as something else in the future. People who identify as monosexual but don't exclude being attracted to other genders just have a real lot of internalised biphobia/ignorance to deal with (and I'm saying that as someone who used to have friends in that category who ended up just realising they were bisexual -maybe with a preference for a specific gender- all along). That said I fully believe both sexuality and gender are fluid for most people, the question is mostly if those people are open/educated on the matter enough to embrace it."

My biggest issue with selecting a sexuality for Max is that while she gets her own opinions and attitude in the game, I'm still pulling her strings. Without concrete statements in the space between choices, I feel like we can't get a canonical position of Max's sexuality.  I guess my second issue is that During a game like Life is Strange, Max is really just me under some cognitive transvestism. As in, it's me trying to think as though I was a high school girl. The issue is that I like girls, so Max, as long as the option was available, was always going to like girls.  Anyways. My two bits. Sorry if there's typos, this was done on mobile on the bus."

lifeisstrange,3cjvum,FilmingMachine,-1,Wed Jul 8 18:36:27 2015 UTC,"I consider Sexual fluidity as one of a every growing number of fancy ways of saying bisexual. There is no scientific evidence that someone's sexual orientation changes during their lifetime. Yes bisexual men and woman can move from being mainly same-sex attracted to being mainly opposite-sex attracted, but they always remain bisexual. Compulsory heterosexuality and a lack of education and understanding of sexuality can also play a part in how someone identifies.  As for Max, I'm in the camp that she is what we make her to be. In the game she doesn't identify her sexuality in any way so we, the players, are free to guide her in any way we choose. Ultimately I think her sexuality will be revealed via our choices in the game."

Usually hours of pain and bleeding out--unless you're lucky. So I'm not sure about that whole thing....

So it's likely that she was still alive, simply unconscious and bleeding out. I don't think the bullet wound could have plunged her into a coma though--comas mostly occur due to injury directly to the brain, which she didn't have. Paralyzation--whether partial or complete--could have possibly occurred, on the other hand, but I find it unlikely unless the bullet messed up her spinal chord."

So assuming that are unlimited alternative timelines based on the choices that were made by people Rachel chose one of them. But stop here. There are many timelines where Rachel exists or never existed. This wouldn't explain why she simply ""disappeared"". She may only be switching the universe. And be living on in the normal timeline.  For example Max. She exists in several universes but is only controlling ""herself"" in the timeline we played first. Making her switch to an alternative universe, may only switch her point of view. Not her whole body. Because where the other Max would be?  Making her switch the timeline like Max doesn't include to disappear in the normal timeline.

lifeisstrange,3cj5q1,HelloCringle,9,Thu Jul 9 15:19:36 2015 UTC,I just had a thought. What if the only reason Max and Chloe are even friends is because Rachel changed something in the past that made it so. What if Rachel created some kinda paradox that is destroying the world in all timelines?! And what if we're going to all this trouble to find Rachel only to discover she is an antagonist; our real nemisis. Food for thought.

She looks somewhat similar, but without make up, and she is even the ""same size"" when she needs clothes in EP 3.  She also has an artistic eye, and as OP pointed out might very well be able to control time on her own.    If we do meet her, it would hinge on two Max's being able to be in the same timeline at the same time, or she isn't in this timeline anymore because she can't be close to her past self.

I'd like to think that if she went back again and changed back the timeline, she'd return to the original universe at the time she she looked at the photo in alternate universe. Similar to how she arrived in the alternate universe with no recollection of the alternate past, she'd have no memory of x-hours lost from the original timeline, even though she'd have lived in it but didn't experience it.

lifeisstrange,3ch7rn,FilmingMachine,6,Wed Jul 8 12:32:13 2015 UTC,"Just want to say I ran the test and /u/FFaUniHan was right, props to him/her. I did an event at the beginning of the scene (approximately 8:17) and waited until 8:55, then I was able to rewind all the way back. So I guess it's dependent on when the first event happens, and you'll always be able to change it if you want"

lifeisstrange,3ci4pv,TAGsvk,30,Wed Jul 8 02:19:35 2015 UTC,I ship Max and Chloe hard.
lifeisstrange,3ci4pv,Reavens,5,Wed Jul 8 04:30:58 2015 UTC,I think most of us do
lifeisstrange,3ci4pv,raspymorten,15,Wed Jul 8 10:35:57 2015 UTC,So do most. I think the fanbase is basically split between max/chloe and max/Victoria with 2 people shipping max/warren lol
lifeisstrange,3ci4pv,jessebona,14,Wed Jul 8 04:41:38 2015 UTC,"Max/Victoria? The girl who attempts to manipulate people, but isn't smart enough?"
lifeisstrange,3ci4pv,PREPAREyourANGUS,9,Wed Jul 8 06:57:55 2015 UTC,Yeah. It's a thing.
lifeisstrange,3ci4pv,jessebona,3,Wed Jul 8 07:03:34 2015 UTC,"I like Victoria, too. If you check the outro in Episode 2 you can see her crying and I'm assuming she feels terrible for her witchhunt against Kate. I feel like she's a good person at heart and I want to get her to show her nice side more often"
lifeisstrange,3ci4pv,TwitOne,7,Wed Jul 8 10:05:42 2015 UTC,She is happily taking a video while Kate jumps... I think we will see her nice side in episode 4. But it bothers me that the fanbase dismisses her as tsundere when she has driven a girl to suicide.
lifeisstrange,3ci4pv,preparingupdate,2,Wed Jul 8 18:24:12 2015 UTC,fair point.
lifeisstrange,3ci4pv,TwitOne,4,Wed Jul 8 19:13:36 2015 UTC,I got the impression it never occurred to her just how terrible her actions were until Kate tried/succeeded to kill herself. She seems to bounce right back to jerk in episode 3 so it didn't really stick.
lifeisstrange,3ci4pv,jessebona,8,Wed Jul 8 10:26:27 2015 UTC,"I think Victoria suffers under a very different kind of peer pressure. Her whole Crew is one big circlejerk imo. Considering how deep most main characters are in LIS I believe she has more layers beneath her bitch attitude. It's hard to tell right now but I'm rather certain that we will learn a lot about every character in the last 2 episodes and I also feel like we will see that some ""bad"" characters are actually good ones. I have this feeling with david madsen, too, for example, even though I busted him in my blind save file. Actually I feel that Warren, Samuel and especially the principle will show very questionable behaviour towards the finale. But I'm drifting off topic"
lifeisstrange,3ci4pv,TwitOne,3,Wed Jul 8 11:11:36 2015 UTC,"I believe that David will absolutely turn out to be a hero.  Yes, he's a strict stepdad and he engages in some weird behavior, but I believe that's a PTSD issue, not an indication of his actual personality.  David is going to end up saving Max and/or Chloe's life...probably sacrificing himself in the process."
lifeisstrange,3ci4pv,PRGuyHere,2,Wed Jul 8 19:02:39 2015 UTC,"Yes, I totally agree with you! I actually like David and his military tone often gave me some sort of comic relief. I believe every word when he says that he wants to protect the school and its students and I'm sure he will somehow. I blamed him for Chloe's death in my save file because I knew he would not go nuts about it (I felt the danger coming from Nathan in case I busted him would have been much bigger. And Mr Jefferson just felt reeeeaaaaally unrelated to the issue). I feel kinda sorry for him since he is so misunderstood but he will step up for the right thing no matter what imo"
lifeisstrange,3ci4pv,TwitOne,1 point,Wed Jul 8 19:09:25 2015 UTC,"If you sneak in to her room after Kate's death, you can also find an email where she says she feels like shit about bullying Kate."

lifeisstrange,3ci4pv,navipokoy,3,Wed Jul 8 08:12:35 2015 UTC,I doubt that this is Chloe's everyday underwear. Not mention that beach style print.
lifeisstrange,3ci4pv,navipokoy,5,Wed Jul 8 08:27:19 2015 UTC,She probably just does not care what she wears
lifeisstrange,3ci4pv,Swoove,2,Wed Jul 8 08:42:48 2015 UTC,"This game is full of these little details, I dont see point then why devs would bothered with this. Its fairly oblivious that you dont wear underwear for pool on everyday basis because that would be bit strange, so it makes more sense that Chloe just planned that pool trip."
lifeisstrange,3ci4pv,gwaimui,2,Wed Jul 8 09:16:11 2015 UTC,"Eh, I have a few pairs of underwear similar to this that I wear whenever. I wouldn't call it ""pool"" underwear, it's just a fun print."
lifeisstrange,3ci4pv,fatblackcats,2,Wed Jul 8 13:47:50 2015 UTC,"I think they put effort into it BECAUSE you would be seeing it in an animated sequence & they wanted to juxtapose Chloe's graphic underwear against max's plain underwear to stay true to their characters.  For that reason, I think it's just her underwear."
lifeisstrange,3ci4pv,alexhasacamera,6,Thu Jul 9 11:10:40 2015 UTC,Maybe she has styled underwear and bra

We are who we are. Yes there are personality types but hell no, do we need that. I was labeled too. For PDD-Not Otherwise Specified. When I was fuckin' six years old and when my parents divorced. I was going through a difficult time, so who was the one who decided that I had autism? This bothered me at some point in life, because I didn't understand. But suicidal thoughts were definitely on my mind. To me it was like I was going to special schools and wasting my time for no reason. After I stopped caring about it, I did another test.. and you know what? They were wrong all along. I lost that label."

But remember, even if you don't give a thing about what I said earlier.. my story is different from yours.

This month, it is similar, but we know from official sources that the developments of the fourth episode have already been completed. This was in an interview revealed at E3. A similarly interesting information is that Square Enix has confirmed the release cycle of six to eight weeks.  From Episode 1 to 2 7 1/2 weeks have passed. From Episode 2 to 3 roughly 8 weeks have passed. From Episode 3 to 4 there are currently 7 weeks.  We expect that Square Enix will be the release date on Wednesday, 08 July, and to include the 4th episode of Life is Strange next week will be released (14, 15 or 16 July).

lifeisstrange,3chg97,indigoreality,9,Wed Jul 8 06:46:51 2015 UTC,And have to wait for all the games again?
lifeisstrange,3chg97,raspymorten,3,Wed Jul 8 10:41:02 2015 UTC,Good point
lifeisstrange,3chg97,FFaUniHan,10,Wed Jul 8 12:27:38 2015 UTC,"Our glorious leader goes by the name DuckOfDuckness, you miscreant. And I think there’s no way to tell for sure how it will be before we get there. Of course, the hype to get new episodes really keeps people going here a lot, but so does speculation, theories, fanart, fan fiction, etc. I don’t think people will completely stop thinking and creating as soon as it stops, simply because LiS is a great game and people want to stay in touch with it and other people loving it. Also, I think that the ending(s) itself can be very influential to the community. If there is several, maybe we’ll discuss which one is the best, and even if there is only one, it may be unclear and open the interpretation, and so to more discussions.   So, I don’t think the community will be buried the day ep 5 comes out, but there’s no telling how it will actually end up being like :p"

Even if its just to find out which ending will be canon for us. + all those spirit animal, apocalypse prophecy stuff that will most likely not be completely ticked off after the game.  And Season 2 of course."

You got to remember that a lot of people will be playing this further down the road.   People who hesistated on buying it at full-price, people who waited for it to be a full season and maybe people who waited for a possible PS+/XBLG deals.   All those people will count for a lot of traffic :)"

I just leaned back and enjoyed the moment until the song was over.""   This right here is a perfect answer.  The game has three of those moments guitar - morning bed - Chloe's bed and they all had me sitting there for at least 10mins just thinking, evaluating real life like that was the reason Dontnod put these in.   Cheers mate for being featured!"
lifeisstrange,3ceufn,haXona,4,Tue Jul 7 11:10:35 2015 UTC,"Thank you so much. You'd think I'd get enough of lying down IRL, but nope, have to do it in-game as well."
lifeisstrange,3ceufn,DuckOfDuckness,3,Tue Jul 7 11:24:50 2015 UTC,Haha I know the feeling :P
lifeisstrange,3ceufn,haXona,2,Tue Jul 7 12:24:06 2015 UTC,"It also happens with those moments where Max can sit down in the junkyard. So many games, and films, seem to feel the need for every moment to be filled - with action, with dialogue, with something. With Life is Strange there's a lot of moments with some blank space, for reflection, to look at the world around you or just to take a breather. I think other studios should really think of adding this kind of scene in. They don't have to be long, they don't even have to have music (silence is valid too), but they can add a lot to a game in my opinion."
lifeisstrange,3ceufn,kangaesugi,3,Tue Jul 7 14:22:14 2015 UTC,Yeah the silence at the junkyard or the bench outside the dorms is just mesmerising. Listening to the wind and birds priceless

lifeisstrange,3ceufn,ClickingGeek,2,Wed Jul 8 04:51:36 2015 UTC,"This subreddit made me become (somewhat) active in reddit in general because I gotta talk about Life is Strange with others, so massive thanks to /u/DuckOfDuckness. You and everyone here rock."
lifeisstrange,3chxqp,IAmDaWallflower,2,Wed Jul 8 01:21:30 2015 UTC,I think more calm and chilled music fits to Life is Strange. It's mostly music that is sung in a rather sad or emotionless way. I like these songs especially the first but I think it wouldn't fit to the playstyle unless it get faster and more complicated. But nice suggestion.
lifeisstrange,3chxqp,SirenX_EUW,1 point,Wed Jul 8 18:36:31 2015 UTC,"Yeah Modest Mouse is pretty good. I love Dramamine, the first song in the video, defiantly my favorite track from them. I feel it especially fits with LiS because I imagine that everything gets more foggy and complicated for Max the further she explores her powers.   Both the song and the game share a similar ""haze"" that makes playing this game medicated best thing ever."
lifeisstrange,3chzf9,alexhasacamera,9,Wed Jul 8 01:35:27 2015 UTC,"If I lived in the world of LiS I wouldn't watch it. It seems obvious it's something Kate doesn't want people to see, and I don't like malicious gossip. I'd have my disagreements with Kate given her abstinence campaign, but she didn't deserve that.  I don't live there though. As such I would strive to explore all the content the creators produced, and use it in the formation and discussion of theories."
lifeisstrange,3chzf9,levir,15,Wed Jul 8 10:02:57 2015 UTC,"Yes, because my intent would be knowledge, in what exactly happened. Since the video could ultimately be used to help Kate.  But given it's got a traumatic trigger for you, I'm not too surprised to find out you are uncomfortable  But also keep in mind, this isn't real. And in most real life cases things should be handled differently."
lifeisstrange,3chzf9,TheMarshmallowBear,10,Wed Jul 8 01:37:31 2015 UTC,"I went to the site - not to watch the vid, but to see what sort of added game ""flair"" might be there - like if there were any student comments or stuff that might add to the game.  To ease your troubled mind: there is no vid there. To ease your curious mind: there isn't any content there, either.  But no, if I were in the actual world of LiS, I wouldn't watch the video. I didn't look at the celebrity phone hack photos for the same reason: it's none of my business."
lifeisstrange,3chzf9,Mosykins,3,Wed Jul 8 01:40:03 2015 UTC,Probably. Assuming the person was my friend I'd want to know what happened instead of living in ignorance.
lifeisstrange,3chzf9,jessebona,3,Wed Jul 8 01:40:15 2015 UTC,I'd go to the URL but not watch the vid beyond dumping one or two wide angle shot's.  The contents of the video would be none of my business but the site itself and the person who recorded it would be.  I'd be after site and file forensics.
lifeisstrange,3chzf9,SteveJEO,2,Wed Jul 8 10:15:52 2015 UTC,"It's a different situation. In the LiS world, no, I wouldn't watch it. Not unless Kate sat me down in front of it and said I could watch it.  In this real world, I am surprised and impressed that Dontnod went to such lengths to even get that url up as a real thing, so of course I'm going to check it out to see what the page looks like. If the actual video had been there, I might've watched it just to see if we could get more hints about who drugged her. I figured they wouldn't actually put up the video though, specifically because it would give us hints to what happened, and it'd probably contain some very questionable, explicit content, even if it's only video game graphics."
lifeisstrange,3chzf9,valryuu,1 point,Wed Jul 8 16:55:49 2015 UTC,Nah. Not after seeing Kate almost jump.
lifeisstrange,3chzf9,yarfmeister,1 point,Wed Jul 8 09:47:04 2015 UTC,"In real life? No, that's really fucked up to watch a video like that of someone taken without their consent. However if there was a choice in-game...I'd think there is some information in it. I still wouldn't watch it in my main playtrough. But I'd probably look it up later."
lifeisstrange,3chzf9,preparingupdate,1 point,Wed Jul 8 18:32:22 2015 UTC,"I made my answer assuming that I was a part of the LiS universe, not real life.  Probably not. The only circumstances in which I would watch it is if I was helping Kate investigate into what happened to her that night, with clear permission given from her to watch it. There might be valuable clues hidden in the video that we could use as evidence if it came down to that.   Other than that specific situation, I would not watch it. It's Kate's privacy and I wouldn't want to violate that without her consent."
lifeisstrange,3chzf9,SoundSmith323,1 point,Wed Jul 8 18:53:09 2015 UTC,"In the interest of:   Seeing if it was really her, not just a look-alike. Mostly because it's just that out of character for Kate. Seeing if it was apparent in the video whether or not she was under the influence of illicit drugs, for the reason mentioned prior. Also for the reason of needing to know if I have to go beat someone up for dosing my friend.   Once I'd seen enough to try and judge those two facts, I'd probably turn it off. Seeing a friend in that kind of position is not fun and not something I'd garner any enjoyment from."
lifeisstrange,3chzf9,MainaC,1 point,Wed Jul 8 19:07:13 2015 UTC,"I did go there, but only to see if there was anything to learn about what happened that night, not because I wanted to torment Kate, far from it.  There isn't a video there anyway, it's just an easter egg."
lifeisstrange,3chzf9,wHatTheFez,0,Wed Jul 8 19:34:26 2015 UTC,I'd watch it. One ... and a half times. Watching it doesnt really hurt. Its the forwarding that makes everything get out of control imo.
lifeisstrange,3chzf9,lixyna,2,Wed Jul 8 09:40:45 2015 UTC,"No but see, that's the thing. If this were a real life situation, everyone watches it with that mindset. Yes, the forwarding hurts, but the fact is that it does get sent around, and then people inevitably bring it up as a conversation topic. That's the whole point of the term ""viral video."" (Think back to when Gangnam Style was huge. Everyone asked everyone ""have you seen Gangnam Style?"") Even if you don't forward it, human curiosity gets the better of most peoppe, and they search it up anyway.  Additionally, watching it DOES hurt. It ultimately hurts someone like Kate; it was an invasion of her privacy, and it probably would change how you see her, even if only a little bit. Think about it this way: if you had an embarrassing photo or video go up on the internet (doesn't have to be like Kate's alleged video), would you really not mind if a whole bunch of people watched/saw it? What about the rumours that will start? What about what they will think of you?"
lifeisstrange,3chzf9,valryuu,1 point,Wed Jul 8 17:00:38 2015 UTC,"Oh I know it would suck. But then again, the question was "" would you watch it?"" not ""would you watch it, then share it with everyone and make it the topic of the day?"". Im very good at staying silent and keeping secrets."
lifeisstrange,3cgiyg,Duplo65,25,Tue Jul 7 19:02:34 2015 UTC,The 21st? They still have time to make an announcement. Episode 3 was announced 6 days before it's release so let's keep hoping.
lifeisstrange,3cgiyg,Mahro0,21,Tue Jul 7 19:15:32 2015 UTC,"There's still time, yeah. It's 9pm in France so I'd give them another day. It doesn't have to be 7 days notice exactly :)"

lifeisstrange,3cgiyg,wizhards,13,Wed Jul 8 06:01:47 2015 UTC,"Calm down guys. Dontnod said that they would like to keep the 8 week mark. They will release episode 4, when episode 4 is done. I know you are dying to play episode 4, and so am i, but i would just much rather wait longer, and play a good episode, or have the episode right now, and have less content to play.  Please be patient, and give Dontnod the time they need."
lifeisstrange,3cgiyg,HeckaFrosty,4,Tue Jul 7 21:58:55 2015 UTC,"I'm sure it's been fully finished for a week or so now. Just gotta add on a couple weeks so that our suspense can increase, and it gives themselves some extra time in case shit hits the fan. If anything they're probably just polishing some of the bugs."
lifeisstrange,3cgiyg,kingbanjee,6,Wed Jul 8 03:07:57 2015 UTC,"If they're polishing it, it isn't ""fully finished."""
lifeisstrange,3cgiyg,HeckaFrosty,-1,Wed Jul 8 03:57:20 2015 UTC,Yeah but they said if the episode were to come out right now we would have less content. I said they're probably completely finished with adding content. They're probably just fixing bugs and working on episode 5 right now.

lifeisstrange,3cgiyg,kingbanjee,0,Tue Jul 7 21:51:10 2015 UTC,The situation has been different this year. The store updates more frequently on high notice games including LIS which launched on a friday and EU and NA PSNNis more streamlinedntoday thannit was 6 months ago. So they could effectively launchh on friday if they wanted to :)

lifeisstrange,3cl8q2,lixyna,1 point,Thu Jul 9 00:20:16 2015 UTC,I think there are some nice details in the clip - look at what is carved into the desk/table for example. Does it have something to do with the story itself? Not more or less than any other theories and fanart I would say - more a spinoff than anything else.

lifeisstrange,3cgdvf,max_caulfield_,2,Tue Jul 7 21:59:36 2015 UTC,In EP1 on the kitchen shelf the first time you get to chloes house. Thanks!
lifeisstrange,3cgdvf,godziraaa,3,Wed Jul 8 14:45:31 2015 UTC,It totally makes sense that Max would've sent a postcard right after moving to Seattle  That's a cool find :D
lifeisstrange,3cfall,ThreadOfFate,9,Tue Jul 7 13:41:32 2015 UTC,"I think the only time the game rushes you to do something is when Chloe keeps on shooting the bumper by default  . . get your shit together girl  But on topic, I really enjoy all the slow moments that Max can just sit down and just pause time without using her power. The multiple panels and perspective we get of Max and the environment. It is also a plus when she is having her self-reflecting conversation. I would say the best slow moment would be Max playing the guitar at the beginning of episode 2, that scene plus the background music is b-e-a-utiful. Between that and tales from the borderland episode 2 intro, I would say both games have one of the best intro this year, hell even to this date.   Any ways, although I have to finish an objective to progress, it doesn't tell me when i have to finish it. *insert groan here*"
lifeisstrange,3cfall,-Carlos-,5,Tue Jul 7 14:46:10 2015 UTC,"dammit chloe stop ruining everything  my personal favorite is the episode 3 one where you and chloe are just laying in bed, letting whatever track you picked play out.  it's significant in not just the sense i talk about in the post, but also because this is what they used to do.  it's been like five years, and they're right back where they used to be - and how different things have become.  how does max feel?  how does chloe feel?  is there more there?  are they both thinking the same thing?  what's going on between them?  so many questions, so much meaning, all of it conveyed through simple camera angles, music, and the quiet scene of a wednesday morning.  it's beautiful.  it's meaningful.  it says so much, with so little, it's just...ugh.  i won't shut up about this normally so i'm gonna stop here but just UGH THAT SCENE."
lifeisstrange,3cfall,lnrael,5,Tue Jul 7 18:59:20 2015 UTC,"I like this analysis / stream of thoughts. Thanks for the read.   Sure, you're not really rushed, except through texts or other non-gameplay-affecting indicators, but you are not really told ""you can relax now, enjoy the moment, don't worry about finding things out or talking to anyone"".   I just wanted to throw this example out there as well. The opening sequence when Max steps out into the hallway almost has this same feeling of being released from responsibility, but you're absolutely right that the indicators and the ability to move make you want to go towards the next objective. If you stay still long enough in the hallway just chilling like the other students are, Max even comments on what the next objective is. (Takes maybe a minute or two?)  However, of all the places where you can sit or lay down or play the guitar, the hallway in the opening sequence remains my favorite place to chill. The close runner-up is turning on the music in Max's room and having her play along with it."
lifeisstrange,3cfall,centerflag982,3,Tue Jul 7 14:45:12 2015 UTC,"that does feel close, as the main plot hasn't really kicked in yet - we've just seen the tornado, so it's more-or-less a typical school day after the last class is done.  nothing to do, nowhere to be - such a lazy feeling.  i just love the moments where there are no indicators, nowhere to move or look or no one to talk to.  it's such a cool feeling to be told by the game ""all right, take some time.  relax.  cool off, think, breathe.  you can get up when you want, no pressure, but don't worry about it now""  it's like the video game equivalent of a bob ross show  it's also somewhat exemplified by this song: Latest Fail - OC Remix"
lifeisstrange,3cfall,Theroonco,3,Tue Jul 7 19:03:54 2015 UTC,"The opening sequence when Max steps out into the hallway almost has this same feeling of being released from responsibility   That whole hallway scene is the first time I realized I was gonna love this game... from the minute Max starts that song, then just wandering the hallways checking things out... it was just such an awesome atmosphere"
lifeisstrange,3cfall,Theroonco,3,Tue Jul 7 22:15:08 2015 UTC,"Don't remove anything, everything is awesome!  I really like those moments, even if sometimes I get a little impatient. It's not your fault Dontnod! I just don't have much time for gaming.  I love the narration you get most of the time - you're rewarded for relaxing. You come for the little extra bit of character and stay for the peace and quiet (and gentle music)~"
lifeisstrange,3cfall,Theroonco,2,Tue Jul 7 18:31:20 2015 UTC,"heh, thanks!  yeah, they use it as not just a moment of breathing, but a time for max to reflect and voice her own thoughts over what's going on.  it's a great character bit, and i love that they use them so well.  i'm excited to see episode 4's."

lifeisstrange,3ci08r,OBLIVIATER,2,Wed Jul 8 01:42:07 2015 UTC,I did downloaded it from torrents first :D I didn't know if my computer will run this game. So when I checked and it was running well I bought on Steam all 5 episodes :D
lifeisstrange,3ci08r,konrad5558,2,Wed Jul 8 09:31:05 2015 UTC,It's ok. :(  I am very active here too and I also am pirating every episode because we don't have a lot of money.

lifeisstrange,3ci08r,preparingupdate,1 point,Wed Jul 8 18:54:41 2015 UTC,Yeah LPs make pirating these types of games silly. I just did so I could see how the other choice would look.

lifeisstrange,3ci27x,Someone7272,7,Wed Jul 8 01:58:31 2015 UTC,The junction point photo will always still be usable as nothing prior to that is altered. Now if that photo is lost or destroyed in the intervening period you might be shit out of luck but nothing about what Max did showed she was thinking logically.
lifeisstrange,3ci27x,jessebona,4,Wed Jul 8 03:36:47 2015 UTC,"We don't know exactly how Max's Photo Power works yet, or if she gets to keep anything she had on her in the alternative timeline. So basically everything I'm going to say is just pure speculation.   I don't think the photo Max took is going to allow her to go back because she is not in that photo. Some people may have even missed that opportunity altogether. (I can't even remember if she picked it up or left it on the counter.) Thankfully William still takes the original photo that she used to get there. That is probably the one she has to use to go back and not intervene.   I would have definitely NOT have chosen to save William. I was practically yelling at the game and trying to figure out a way to prevent Max from doing it. To go back that far and meddle with other people's timelines, even her own, was just plain...dumb. Her intentions were good, but WTF Max? She should have known better, but I guess it's just in her nature to try to ""fix"" things. Odds are we do go back to the original timeline, but who hell knows?"
lifeisstrange,3ci27x,Infamy7,3,Wed Jul 8 03:11:09 2015 UTC,"I hope we go back to the original storyline.  In real life, funny that a few years ago, my mom asked that if you could go back in time to change something, like a decision, would you?  Naturally, I said yes. She then went on to say, 'that this might not pan out how you hoped it to, it could change other things in the future, most likely negatively, or have other unforeseen consequences which you didn't consider.'  Then this game drops. It's amazing you know.  That's why I'd fully stand by your decision not to tamper with the past."
lifeisstrange,3ci27x,Ara-Player,1 point,Wed Jul 8 03:17:22 2015 UTC,"It would be dumb and weird if you could go back, but be all like ""Oh, I don't want to change anything! I know how it will play out!"" because if you are asking me, I like to play the game from the main characters sake, like I am the main character; Max didn't know at all it could end really badly, so it's ""weird"" to me to go back but not change anything."
lifeisstrange,3ci27x,Infamy7,1 point,Wed Jul 8 10:09:06 2015 UTC,"I'm speaking more in terms of I wouldn't have known the outcome because I would have never made that choice to begin with.   That's my point exactly, she didn't know what would happen good or bad. She could have very easily killed everyone, including herself. What if she was in the car with Chloe and died? What if she dropped out of school and never made it to Blackwell? What if she's lost her power now? What if the Price family stopped keeping a photo album after Chloe's accident? There was just so much risk involved with going back that far. I get why she did it. She just wanted to help and clearly didn't think things through.   But seriously this is what makes this game great. I've been going insane trying to figure what's going to happen now....and I love it."

lifeisstrange,3ci27x,TDurandal,2,Wed Jul 8 10:09:06 2015 UTC,"The optional photo doesn't matter, hence why it's optional. Whether you take it or not doesn't change events, Joyce still calls home, William still owes a dollar for the swear jar, William still dies if you do nothing and Chloe always becomes quadriplegic if you save William. However, optional photos might come into play in Episode 5 if the Primer theory becomes true. But at the minute, they're just little collectibles."
lifeisstrange,3ci27x,EcoleBuissonniere,1 point,Wed Jul 8 15:35:10 2015 UTC,"That photo wasn't just an optional photo, though; it was also listed as one of the minor decisions. It was a minor decision, on the same level as something as small as choosing whether or not to water Lisa or warning the homeless woman, which means that I think OP is dead wrong about it affecting anything, but it probably will alter a few lines of dialogue or something at some point."
lifeisstrange,3ci27x,Ara-Player,1 point,Wed Jul 8 16:27:40 2015 UTC,"That's what I'm thinking too; taking the photo will make it easier for you to traverse back in the original timeline. But if you don't take the photo you can still get back using the MAX/CHLOE photo William took which you used to go back in the first place, but I think you will need to go through some puzzles or something while you can immediately go back if you took the photo since Max still probably has it..."
lifeisstrange,3ci27x,Lukiele,1 point,Wed Jul 8 10:04:10 2015 UTC,"I don't think the photo will have any significance. I just think Max will talk to alternative Chloe for a bit and just go back to the original timeline with the selfie she took with Chloe in her room during EP3.   Additionally, I doubt she will ever go back to the alternative timeline ever again. Maybe that whole sequence was to just introduce her power to us. I'm sure she will use that power to travel places eventually but not to go back that far behind."
lifeisstrange,3ci27x,zqwefty,1 point,Wed Jul 8 17:15:56 2015 UTC,"That photo specifically isn't likely to have an effect on the plot, since it's optional. Going back to the normal timeline will probably use the same photo max got there with in the first place, since it already existed before Max changed everything, and any photos she's taken since then probably couldn't exist.   However, in the normal timeline, max has taken two photos that were required to progress the game: in EP1, the selfie in Jefferson's class, and in EP3, the selfie Chloe. Both of these can (and probably will, IMO) affect the plot without having major branching stories connected to individual optional photos.   Or maybe I'm wrong and optional photos will affect the plot, but if I had to guess I'd say that couldn't happen until episode 5, so that players can't write EP4 out of existence. It'd be pretty crazy if the ending was something like, ""You only have the strength to use your power one last time. Choose a photo you've taken this week as your point in time to intervene and fix everything,"" so each photo unlocked a different ending. But there's almost no way that'd happen, I'm just dreaming now."
lifeisstrange,3ci27x,wHatTheFez,1 point,Wed Jul 8 17:26:27 2015 UTC,"I really hope Dontnod do something with that optional photo, I mean more than just a dialogue change, because it could literally change the entire course of the game, but it would probably extend the release date for the upcoming episodes, which would be hard, but worth it (for me at least)."

lifeisstrange,3cewl9,wizhards,6,Tue Jul 7 12:27:36 2015 UTC,Listening to the music and messing with object models (both pulled from the game files :D )
lifeisstrange,3cewl9,Ara-Player,2,Tue Jul 7 12:54:31 2015 UTC,Object models? Did you manage to pull out environment models or scenery models?
lifeisstrange,3cewl9,chronoflect,6,Tue Jul 7 12:20:17 2015 UTC,"Character models and objects (teddy bear, benches, laptops, etc). There may be other types of stuff, but I haven't looked through everything.  It's a pretty long process and I don't know if the subreddit mods or Dontnod would appreciate me putting instructions publicly. PM me if you want to know how though."
lifeisstrange,3cewl9,Ara-Player,2,Tue Jul 7 12:26:43 2015 UTC,How do you pull out the music? I don't know how to work with those .pck files.
lifeisstrange,3cewl9,chronoflect,2,Tue Jul 7 12:57:32 2015 UTC,"I screwed around a lot trying to figure out how to work with them, before realizing the answer was on the LiS steam community the whole time... https://steamcommunity.com/app/319630/discussions/0/617328415056491865/ (reply #3)"

I'm really, really excited though, i feel like this has been one of the longer waits we've done for an episode.  I know the wait for episode 5 is going to be unbearable."
lifeisstrange,3cewl9,Krabsouille,1 point,Tue Jul 7 16:21:34 2015 UTC,That's why I played EP3 11 days after it's release just so I could wait less :). I think I will do the same with EP4 too.
lifeisstrange,3cewl9,Ara-Player,3,Tue Jul 7 16:16:05 2015 UTC,"That... doesn't make any sense. If you wait 11 days to play ep 3, but then wait another 11 days to play ep 4, you would have waited the same amount of time between them as just playing them as soon as possible."
lifeisstrange,3cewl9,DominoNo-,3,Tue Jul 7 16:29:14 2015 UTC,"But then I would play EP5 instantly, so I overall have waited 11 days less :3"

lifeisstrange,3cewl9,FilmingMachine,1 point,Tue Jul 7 20:02:35 2015 UTC,"I believe in your time, the episode will come out in 7AM or 8AM, since they always release the game at 00:00 pacific american time I believe, and that's around UTC-7"
lifeisstrange,3cewl9,Ara-Player,3,Tue Jul 7 16:31:13 2015 UTC,I'm being crazy elaborating some conspiracy theories about when the episode will come out by studying when the older episodes came out and why they should give us the 4th one on a Wednesday. :(
lifeisstrange,3cewl9,EcoleBuissonniere,4,Tue Jul 7 19:46:07 2015 UTC,Anyone else here waited for a few days after EP3 was released to play EP3 just so we could have less days to wait? I know I did.
lifeisstrange,3cewl9,Ynead,2,Tue Jul 7 14:04:03 2015 UTC,I waited 3 weeks to play EP3 just because I didn't want to finish it. I want it to last forever.
lifeisstrange,3cewl9,haXona,2,Tue Jul 7 11:48:48 2015 UTC,"So what you are saying is that ""you played episode 3 three weeks after its release to not have to wait so much for episode 4"" or ""you played episode 3 in 3 weeks to not have it ending so soon""? :)"
lifeisstrange,3cewl9,wanna_be_gop,2,Tue Jul 7 12:49:29 2015 UTC,"I played it some time later than when it was released so after the cliffhanger I would need to wait less time. :) I played it on the 30th of May I believe, so I need to wait 11 days less than I would normally need to if I played it in the 19th.

lifeisstrange,3cew5e,Gr4b,21,Tue Jul 7 11:07:37 2015 UTC,"I really don't see why every one hates Warren so much. He doesn't do anything worse than any other ordinary teenage guy. Yeah, he tries too hard with Max, but it's not like he's really doing anything other than trying (and failing) to flirt with her."
lifeisstrange,3cew5e,EcoleBuissonniere,16,Tue Jul 7 15:23:36 2015 UTC,"Warren suffers from the fact that he is billed as a major character, but we have very little information about his motivations or meaningful interaction with him. He comes off too strong when he tries to guilt trip Max into going to the movies with him and casually disregarding Brook. But Chloe also guilt trips Max several times, and is pretty quick to shift the blame to Max when they are caught by David, however not much fuss is raised about her.   The main differences are that we as a players knows where Chloe is coming from. We know that Chloe is hurt that Max left her five years ago and is constantly seeking signs that Max is here to stay and stand by her. Furthermore Max the character feels very guilty about leaving Chloe in the first place, and is very sympathetic to Chloe's tantrums, these factors combines to makes us the player see what Chloe does in a much more favorable light.  We have very little information on what make Warren tick, other than he has a major crush on Max and is a science geek with a taste for obscure movies. In the absence of critical info people let there imagination run wild, and perhaps because both Chloe and Kate was drugged and most likely sexually assaulted, people are assuming the worst."
lifeisstrange,3cew5e,Uodoo,2,Tue Jul 7 19:50:33 2015 UTC,Can I hug you for that comment?
lifeisstrange,3cew5e,lixyna,3,Wed Jul 8 00:28:10 2015 UTC,"Right back at ya. Nice points illustrating that Warren's ""weirdness"" is probably because he wants to seem edgier to impress Max as opposed to some creepy predatory agenda targeting vulnerable young women."
lifeisstrange,3cew5e,Uodoo,2,Wed Jul 8 04:09:43 2015 UTC,Such good points!
lifeisstrange,3cew5e,dreamfall99,10,Wed Jul 8 13:28:28 2015 UTC,"I don't think so? It seems like Kate's video is very new and only went viral around the time the game starts, and Warren probably gave Max the flash drive a few days ago to give her time to watch them all.   I get that Warren tries a little too hard and that makes some people uncomfortable, but I feel like some people are projecting their bad experiences with teenage boys onto him."
lifeisstrange,3cew5e,TrekMek,38,Tue Jul 7 15:38:56 2015 UTC,"Yeah I noticed this too, and it's part of a detailed analysis on why Warren is a creep.  At the parking lot in Episode 1, there's an option to call Warren sensitive and he says ""sensitive usually means won't be having sex with you"", which is kinda weird...  There is, in the Science lab, Warren + Alyssa 2013 carved into a desk, and Warren appears to be interested in more than one girl - he invites Max to go to the drive-in, and if you accept he says ""I'll have to tell Brooke I cancelled on her"" which is very rude because he is not telling Brooke the truth and is also concealing elements of the 'truth' of his relationship with other girls.  Regarding the drive-in ""Go Ape"", he says he saved Max a ticket... but upon glancing at a poster, it says 10 dollars per car, so his car could be 1 ticket on itself and would not require him to 'save Max a ticket' which seems like a ploy to get Max to go or something.  Then there's the weird peering into Max's room at the start of Episode 2... (seriously wtf)  In Episode 3, when looking in the boy's locker rooms, there is a photo of Warren and Max, to which Max did not take and she exclaims surprise and states something like he developed it himself, which is creepy because he essentially grafted her into a photo with him (what the hell?)  And yeah he stated he watched the video 1 and a half times and I'm pretty sure that was Kate's video, I think it's really interesting how little details can reveal a lot about a character."
lifeisstrange,3cew5e,starspecked,8,Tue Jul 7 11:23:12 2015 UTC,"Usually ""getting a pictured developed"" doesn't mean it's photoshoped or photo edited in any way. It means printing it out from your film. That's at least how I understood it."
lifeisstrange,3cew5e,TeddyOfTheRoundTable,10,Tue Jul 7 18:10:51 2015 UTC,"To reply to my own comment. Yea I'm pretty sure that's what Max meant. It doesn't look photoshopped at all. Found the Picture! and she says ""Bet he developed that in Jefferson's class... But why?"" so she's being a bit stupid, not realizing Warren has feelings for her."

The dude just has creepy written all over him."
lifeisstrange,3cew5e,lixyna,1 point,Tue Jul 7 20:03:23 2015 UTC,Do we know that there are pictures of Max on it? Couldn't it just be a folder dedicated to things Warren wants Max to watch and listen to????
lifeisstrange,3cew5e,WinExploder,1 point,Wed Jul 8 16:44:52 2015 UTC,"I can't remember if this is accurate or not, but I'm pretty sure Dana mentions something about their being a bunch of pictures of Max on there."
lifeisstrange,3cew5e,preparingupdate,25,Wed Jul 8 17:40:59 2015 UTC,"Lets summarise every single (potentially) bad thing about a character and leave out every single positive aspect to create a 100% unbiased analysis! Great! /s  Now seriously, some counterarguments:  The first one is obviously a joke, poking fun at the ""nice guys finish last"" fedora tippers on 9gag. And I think Max knows that pretty well, considering ""Oh gawd. You need a sensitive woman to kick your ass."" - ""If I was lucky."" is not really a conversation created out of awkwardness, is it?  Is Warren after multiple girls? Possibly. It that a bad thing? Some say yea, some like me say no. Its always good to have options. Warren is pretty sure aware about what Max currently thinks of him.  She likes him, but not in that way. Yet. And Warren wants to change that ""yet"". But since changing ""yets"" is pretty difficult is unlikely, he just gets himself ways out of it. Tunnels with branches are always better than one-way roads that get blocked. Also, dont put to much thought into the Warren+Alyssa 2013. We know how prominent mobbing is at Blackwell, and Warren is not really one of the cool kids, so is Alyssa. Having your name with the only fat and ugly (I am sorry, but thats the teenage world for you) girl around carved into a desk doesnt sound like the most fun thing to have for a nerd kid like Warren.   The Go Ape thing might as well be an oversight. Assuming its actually a sweet little lie, well, sure, thats not the british way of doing things. Would I do it if I was in his place? Absolutely. Everyone becomes an opportunist if the right opportunity rises.  Ep2: He's just checking if Max is still there. He got interupted asking for Going Ape and he wants that question to finally get answered (considering he still has Brooke on his ass, he wants a definite answer asap). The best way to get one is waiting at the exact spot he is waiting in EP2. Nothing special really.   Im on you with the photo tho. I feel like Dontnod put that there just to shut people like me up :D That something no normal person would do, but then again, who the fuck is normal at Blackwell? Its weird, but also... cute. In its own special way.  And lastly about the video. He admits to watching it. Big.Fucking.Deal. Everybody except Max and Kate herself have seen this video at that point, most having it forwarded too. Why Warren has to be the ultimate creepy ass for that is beyond me. Sure, he could stand over it. On the other hand, if I put myself back into the time I was a overly horny teenage like Warren is, I would have loved to see a video of an attractive female classmate doing stuff she will regret later on. Penis > Brain in these kind of situations for almost everyone. And considering we have no idea what actually is on the video...  Now that I have discussed why Warren is NOT a creep, lets just point out the good stuff about out favorite little nerd:  He stands up for Max and fights Nathan head on without question. Pretty heroic, right?  He gives Max emotional support when she needs it the most. He downright gives the perfect answers at Ep2's ending. I couldnt imagine a better shoulder to cry on tbh.  And most importantly. He stops playing WoW to help Max with the pipe bomb. HE STOPS PLAYING WOW GOD DAMNIT. Marry him already you naive girl, this dude is perfect (might be over the top)."

I feel like Dontnod put that there just to shut people like me up :D That something no normal person would do, but then again, who the fuck is normal at Blackwell? Its weird, but also... cute.

lifeisstrange,3cew5e,preparingupdate,5,Tue Jul 7 18:28:07 2015 UTC,Watching it doesn't necessarily makes him the ultimate creep. But having a copy of it on his flash drive sure does...
lifeisstrange,3cew5e,ZellekianThought,7,Tue Jul 7 21:03:37 2015 UTC,"Considering Warren says that Max had it for ""ages"" on Monday, and Kates video was taken this weekend, I doubt Warren had any kind of time to put it on there really."

lifeisstrange,3cew5e,centerflag982,1 point,Tue Jul 7 23:37:42 2015 UTC,"But this is only speculation that the file is indeed Kate's video, so we can't exactly jump to any definite conclusions based on it."
lifeisstrange,3cew5e,lixyna,1 point,Tue Jul 7 23:12:41 2015 UTC,True. I'll doubt we'll get confirmation one way or the other though. And I also doubt they would put that in the game without realizing what it implies.
lifeisstrange,3cew5e,theironlefty,4,Tue Jul 7 23:23:12 2015 UTC,"He stops playing WoW to help Max with the pipe bomb   It took me forever to realize this... it wasn't even till the third time I saw that scene, and turned on subtitles, that I even realized what Max was saying - and even then then I had to look up what it meant :P  I'm glad I did, though - the fact that Max uses the term so casually suggests (to me, anyway) that she's got some experience with the game, which is an aspect of her we haven't really seen before - and it just makes her even cooler :)"
lifeisstrange,3cew5e,Deggyy,6,Tue Jul 7 20:07:17 2015 UTC,I can totally understand why Warren is all over her. Because I would be too. And that bubble hearth just hit the nail in the coffin ^
lifeisstrange,3cew5e,WinExploder,7,Tue Jul 7 20:13:56 2015 UTC,i have a question why you are looking on the warrens bad side? look on the good side! he saved max from nearly getting hurt by idiot nathan
lifeisstrange,3cew5e,Deggyy,2,Tue Jul 7 12:01:20 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but did he do it genuinely for her, or for that old macho fantasy of ""save the girl, get the girl?"""
lifeisstrange,3cew5e,WinExploder,7,Tue Jul 7 16:13:47 2015 UTC,I don't know about you but I always do nothing when my friends are being physically and verbally assaulted right in front of me.

lifeisstrange,3cew5e,starspecked,3,Tue Jul 7 21:44:18 2015 UTC,"Well, he did take a punch for her."
lifeisstrange,3cew5e,1314janira,3,Tue Jul 7 22:12:20 2015 UTC,"I'm probably being too harsh on him, but I would have said something like ""anytime!"" Or ""you don't owe me a thing!"", maybe even ""what else was I supposed to do?"""
lifeisstrange,3cew5e,theironlefty,2,Tue Jul 7 22:15:36 2015 UTC,"Hm well yeah Warren did protect Max but it's just there's evidence to suggest he's not as good as he puts himself off as, just as in the game some people project themselves as bad but are not as bad as they really seem."
lifeisstrange,3cew5e,1314janira,4,Tue Jul 7 12:13:36 2015 UTC,"To be honest, if him being nice comes with an agenda I just... rather not, to be honest. He seriously creeps me out I don't care how useful he might be in some occasions, given the chance I'd drop him in a heartbeat."

lifeisstrange,3cew5e,Rirere,4,Tue Jul 7 14:37:59 2015 UTC,"If your crush agreed to go with you on a date, wouldn't you go with them over someone you don't know very well? I think you're reading too much into his actions. When he first asks Max to go out he doesn't mention having bought tickets at all.  It's just as possible that Alyssa carved that into the table.  And how does Warren look into your room? He's outside near the principal's place.  The photo possibly wasn't about putting himself in a photo with Max but trying out the technique. He just used an image of Max cause he's infatuated with her."
lifeisstrange,3cew5e,TheBusinessCat,4,Tue Jul 7 15:24:30 2015 UTC,"I always thought he was weird af tbh. I always tried to reject him but it didn't work up until now so I just said no to his invitations. But that dude is one clingy ""nice guy"""
lifeisstrange,3cew5e,Galvano,2,Tue Jul 7 12:33:15 2015 UTC,"I don't like Warren.  I really don't.  That said, the ""developing"" line didn't bug me.  I took it to mean it was a film selfie at some point that Warren had the film developed for.  Given how fast and loose Life is Strange plays with photographic terms, I'll overlook the fact that C41 color developing is a royal PITA."
lifeisstrange,3cew5e,TrekMek,2,Tue Jul 7 19:29:03 2015 UTC,Damnit Warren! This is why women think men suck.

lifeisstrange,3cew5e,lislislislislis,-5,Thu Jul 9 03:19:30 2015 UTC,"yeah, he's pretty weird... do you think that if Max goes to 'go ape' with him, he might make a move on her, and if she refused... he would, try to, you know... rape her or something...  Maybe he's not THAT weird, but still, the fact he's desperate for a girl to hang with him, like Max, Alyssa, Brooke... maybe."
lifeisstrange,3cew5e,spongyruler,19,Tue Jul 7 11:37:01 2015 UTC,WOAH. Warren has never shown any sign of being a rapist! Let's not throw that word around here guys.
lifeisstrange,3cew5e,centerflag982,10,Tue Jul 7 15:39:39 2015 UTC,"Well regardless he is manipulative and I don't think that's a healthy trait to have, I guess we'll have to wait to see if we can investigate more into him in Episode 4 because that's supposed to be when everything gets even more intense, maybe he really does have a dark side?  Also he said it's in Newburg, just 60 miles away, is that normal for a drive-in to be that far away?"

Samuel is creepier than Warren by far, and I say this as someone who hates Warren.   Hell, Mr. Jefferson says ""I could corner you in a dark room"", the most Warren does is make a joke about sex once. Just because a guy comes on too strong, does not make him a rapist."

lifeisstrange,3cew5e,Kaigura,7,Tue Jul 7 13:34:29 2015 UTC,"I seriously feel the Warren hate is either from people who are:  too young to have dealt with teen boys with a crush, too old to remember what it was like,  too cool to have had an awkward boy hitting on them or hardcore Pricefield shippers. I've never found Warren creepy. Never. Is he a little too desperate? A little awkward? Yeah definitely. But I have totally dealt with boys like this when I was younger. Often I found them annoying and had to tell them I wasn't interested. No big deal. It's fine if people don't like Warren but attacking him over stuff like the photo of him with Max is ridiculous. Nobody finds it creepy when a teen girl writes 50 million times on her notebook: ""Mrs. So So 4 Ever"". If the roles were reversed and Max was outside Warren's dorm room waiting for her, nobody would say, ""OMG SHE IS SUCH A CREEPY STALKER."" They would just think she's like many boy obsessed teen girls. Ugh. I hate the Warren hate. I seriously hope next episode just confirms that he's a good friend."

Besides, Party Buster wouldn't make sense for the title of Kate's video, given that it was made depressingly clear that the party continued quite swimmingly while Kate was drugged...  Don't get me wrong, I don't like Warren very much either, he just doesn't strike me as the type of person to download a classmate's non-consensual drug-induced makeout video, give the folder in which it's contained a super-provocative title, and then give that flash drive to a girl into whose pants he wants to get."

lifeisstrange,3cfdvt,BarelyReal,23,Tue Jul 7 14:09:27 2015 UTC,"I guarantee a lot of the people probably went to high school together before deciding to take their senior year at Blackwell. Rachel Amber might have disappeared in the summer. Chloe got kicked out, so she might have got kicked out winter semester.   Does Max really get bullied for being the new girl? She is the new girl to the city, technically and I always assumed she was getting bullied because Victoria didn't like her.   Blackwell, again just assuming, has a sports team that probably goes along with the rest of the high school.   The way I see it is that kids go to high school in this town and if they are into the arts they can pay some big money and move into a dorm at Blackwell for their senior year to get some college credit and special training in their field."
lifeisstrange,3cfdvt,DeathMcGunz,14,Tue Jul 7 15:09:15 2015 UTC,"^ This is probably the most logical explanation.   Blackwell Academy is probably an extension of an another main campus school. Probably the main Campus is call Blackwell Academy (grade 6-11th), and the one that Max goes to is call Blackwell Academy of the Arts and Science that is only for graduating seniors.   Which would explain why most of the group knows each other not Max. Because she was never there for middle/high school. And that Logan and Zach are part of the main school football team.   .  That, or it may be just a slight interpretation error by the developers."
lifeisstrange,3cfdvt,-Carlos-,2,Tue Jul 7 15:41:51 2015 UTC,"Blackwell Academy is probably an extension of an another main campus school.    We know a reasonable amount about Blackwell's founding history.  The idea that it's just an extension of a larger school has never come up, the academy seemed to have been founded as its own institute.  Further, it wouldn't really make sense.  Blackwell offers a full curriculum (Max attends classes for english, math, science, PE, etc, as well as her photography/art class); and it has some pretty swanky sporting facilities for a side-campus (the athletics field, swimming pool, etc).     That, or it may be just a slight interpretation error by the developers.   I think this is almost certainly the case.  Or maybe in-canon, it was just a brain fart by Max.  :P"
lifeisstrange,3cfdvt,SamuEL_or_Samuel_L,1 point,Tue Jul 7 21:47:33 2015 UTC,"I guarantee a lot of the people probably went to high school together before deciding to take their senior year at Blackwell.    It just doesn't seem like this is likely.  We know that many of the students, like Victoria, came from other parts of the country specifically to attend Blackwell.  It doesn't make sense for her to have attended an interim high school in the local area before starting at Blackwell in September.  Plus, there'd be no reason for Blackwell to have dorms if it was just a high school servicing the local area; nor does it make sense for such an expensive/prestigious school to be made up mostly of local students from a poor fishing town anyway.    So I think the idea that most of the students were already friends at some previous school is extremely unlikely.  Rather, it's probable that this is just some flub in the understanding of the differences between american and european schooling systems.   Rachel Amber might have disappeared in the summer.   We know the date of her disappearance, it was April 27th.  So it wasn't during a period between school years.  Some of the Blackwell students you talk to say she just randomly stopped showing up to classes, which indicates it was during the middle of term.   Chloe got kicked out, so she might have got kicked out winter semester.   I can't recall if we know what date/season she was expelled, but it was at least following one term at the school.  We know she's a year older than Max, so if it was a final-year-only school she would have started in September 2012, or September 2013 if she had previously been held back a year (could this be where Chloe and Max first met - if Chloe had been held back to Max's year in elementary school?).  For her 2011 expulsion date to make any sense, Blackwell must offer at least two years."

lifeisstrange,3cfdvt,preparingupdate,8,Tue Jul 7 22:56:19 2015 UTC,"Max started the school year normally in September, it's the game that starts in October.  I think she was getting bullied just for being herself. She states that she felt like she was being judged because of how she dressed, plus the fact that she's shy and quiet. Don't forget that she isn't the only one being bullied, Kate and Alissa were as well. Dana and Taylor got targeted by Victoria too.  Since Chloe and Rachel are both 19 at present time, they would have attended Blackwell at 18-a normal age for seniors(this would be one school year before Max starts Blackwell). Chloe got kicked out sometime during the year and Rachel went missing in late April, so if she started in September like normal, that means she attended Blackwell for about 7 months before going missing, she would have graduated in a couple more.   I'm guessing most of the Blackwell students attended some other high school in Arcadia up to 11th grade, which is why they all seem to know Rachel.  As for sports teams, they probably have try outs in the beginning of each year, so a new team every year."

lifeisstrange,3cfdvt,EzioSC5,5,Tue Jul 7 22:44:02 2015 UTC,"A few folks have already answered the gist of it - it's likely the ""senior's only"" line was either a flub, or a misinterpretation of american school systems by the french developers.  Many of the other students have been at Blackwell for more than a year.  We know that Rachel Amber went missing 6 months prior (during the previous school year), but most of Max's classmates knew her personally from the school (Evan, Daniel, Victoria, etc).  We also know that Rachel and Chloe attended Blackwell together (they were both a year apart, according to the files in the principal's office, but I guess it's possible for them to have been in the same school year if Chloe was held back a year), and Chloe was expelled in 2011.  So Rachel was attending Blackwell at least throughout the years 2011-2013.  All this - and more - means Blackwell teaches at least two different year levels.  In many countries, the ""senior years"" refers to the final few years of school, so this is potentially where the confusion derives from.  Some of the other statements in this thread about previous high school arrangements for various students are almost certainly false.  We know that Blackwell is a super prestigious school, and most of the students have probably travelled from across the country to attend.  If everyone was local, there'd be no reason for the school to have dorms.  With this in mind, the suggestion that most of the students had attended a different high school together previously doesn't make sense.  And it doesn't make sense for most of the students at an expensive, prestigious school to be sourced primarily from a local, poor fishing town, so it's unlikely that they all knew each other locally.  Finally, the idea that Blackwell is just some satellite campus for a larger highschool doesn't make much sense.  We've learned quite a lot about the history of the school (we know when and how it was founded, for example), and all information we have indicates that it's a stand-alone school.    So, yeah.  The most obvious answer to all this is simply a translation error about what ""senior"" means between american and european schooling systems."

Max is an outsider to the town, hence why she gets the ""new girl"" bullying.   Rachel and Chloe are both one year older than Max, so they were attending the previous year. I'm guessing that everyone attending Blackwell the current year knows Rachel because, again, a lot of them probably went to school in Arcadia Bay before they went to Blackwell."
lifeisstrange,3cfdvt,EcoleBuissonniere,3,Tue Jul 7 15:30:22 2015 UTC,Blackwell isn't a seniors only school since Chloe was a junior when she was kicked out.  I believe Max means Jefferson's photo class is seniors only or it's just an oversight by the developers.
lifeisstrange,3cfdvt,SkateboardCop,2,Tue Jul 7 16:19:58 2015 UTC,"Max is new to the school, but it's Seniors only and it is October. This means Max came to the school some time in September. Why does she get the ""new girl"" bullying?   I'm guessing it's because of her personality. She's a bit shy and insecure and some people can be assholes when they realize that.   Doesn't the class photo in Ep 1 reveal Max was there on the first week of class?   Well,she should have started her year normally. The game takes place about a month after she started.   Rachel Amber attended, as did Chloe. Wouldn't this mean that they attended the previous year? If so how does anybody there know Rachel? What IS the timeline of Rachel and Chloe attending Blackwell?   I think Chloe and Rachel are 1 year older than Max(she's 19 and Max is 18 atm),so she and Rachel probably visited Blackwell the year before Max came back. Rachel disappeared in April I think,which is about 6 months before the game starts.    And please somebody who has gone to private school explain how Blackwell, a one year school, would work in terms of sports teams.   I have no idea. :P"
lifeisstrange,3cfdvt,Ghost_LeaderBG,2,Tue Jul 7 14:33:47 2015 UTC,Blackwell isn't a one-year school. Chloe was in 11th grade when she attended along with Rachel. The other named students knew Rachel so they must have been there for 11th grade as well.  Max's journal reveals that she started the year on time.
lifeisstrange,3cfdvt,Mahro0,1 point,Tue Jul 7 14:55:22 2015 UTC,"If you look at her journal, she moved in to the academy at the 22nd of August I believe.

As for why they know her, they are in their 2nd year of the academy or greater. Where did you get that it's a 1 year school?"
lifeisstrange,3cfdvt,Ara-Player,2,Tue Jul 7 16:15:29 2015 UTC,"Max's journal says it's seniors only, so people took it to mean it's a one year school.

In that sense, since LiS, at least until now and to me, isnt really worth buying if you have already watched the game on YT (assuming linearity stays the same in ep4 and 5), its just as bad as pirating. Just shows that people have a way to negative prejudice against pirating.   Note that I :    Bought the game Do NOT support pirating EVERYTHING.

Some developers I respect so much I pre-order their games, like I did with Life Is Strange. So for me it's pretty much about respect.  I don't judge people for using pirating as a demo, but if you play the full game, enjoy it and like the developer/publisher, for the love of Lisa give them some money.

And I hate the ""they aren't losing money because they weren't gonna buy it anyway!"" argument so much. It's absolute bullshit. The people cared enough to find a working download because they were interested in the game. They're just too cheap or too much of an asshole to actually pay money for it. It's fucking gross. Stop stealing games. Either buy them, or don't play them. You don't get to steal shit because it suits you. You need to grow the hell up."
lifeisstrange,3cj9yb,ak_brian,0,Sat Jul 11 02:10:35 2015 UTC,"Please just buy the game. If it was some big time publisher's game that has a lot of shitty potential I would probably pirate it (Like Watchdogs or the Sims4 , these guys release games just to get paid!)  But an INDIE game that is wonderful and the devs have spent really HARD work on without any Early Access bs? I find that horrible. Please don't pirate this game. Try EP1 and then save up enough to get the rest! It saves up suspense AND helps out the devs."
lifeisstrange,3cj9yb,alexhasacamera,0,Wed Jul 8 13:35:23 2015 UTC,"I used to be more positive towards pirating, but after following the development of Dreamfall Chapters, and especially after hanging out with the developers of that game and the community, my views have changed. As it stands there are a multitude of different options to get information about a game you're considering. Professional reviews, amateur reviews, blogposts and let's plays. They give you more than enough info to evaluate the game before you buy it. And with Steam's new refund policy it's easy to return a game that won't run on your computer because of technical reasons or whatever. So at this point there's really no excuse left for pirating a game.  No-one deserves to play a game, it's a privilege and not a right. So if you care about a game enough to pirate it, you should buy it instead. And if you don't care about it that much, you just have to abstain. For instance I would have liked to play the GTA 5 game now that it's out on PC, but I can't currently justify that expense. So I'll just have to wait, maybe until it's on sale, or until I have leftovers in the budget."
lifeisstrange,3cj9yb,Courier-6,0,Wed Jul 8 10:45:44 2015 UTC,"I'm not pirating Life Is Strange. Instead, I'm doing the opposite. I'm not buying the season pass, I'm buying each episode at it's full price. But I did pirate the game Outlast, which I regret doing, because Red Barrels made a great horror game. Might buy a copy soon."
lifeisstrange,3cj9yb,wHatTheFez,1 point,Wed Jul 8 11:35:20 2015 UTC,"They are doing just fine because the majority of people bought the game.  You're basically advocating ""It's okay to pirate it because plenty of other people are still buying it.""  Reaping the rewards of other people's work is already a problem.  Don't encourage it."

It's so bad, it's criminal. It should be illegal to have to pay for this kind of service.  I think they're 'hard throttling' us for some stupid reason.  I'd kill for DONTNOD to release a physical copy, to the point that I'd buy the game again. But I got a lot of waiting to do now. Maybe I'll play Tomb Raider again in the meantime."

Also try using the safe mode launch option if you haven't already.  edit2: also apparently installing the latest version of DirectX (get it from microsofts site) can help."

Hah, talk about ""This action will have consequences...""  I'll have it out with my network tomorrow.  The game seems okay now, that cutscene played out fine, and I've just reached the end of EP3. Whoa, what a way to twist the storyline beyond repair.  I hope we can undo this in EP4, I want the badass punk-rock Chloe back!  EP3 SPOILERS"
lifeisstrange,3cf2sl,7thPwnist,5,Tue Jul 7 12:25:30 2015 UTC,That is true but now Max is in the new timeline and doesnt have the picture to go back to the classroom
lifeisstrange,3cf2sl,millerja1,4,Tue Jul 7 12:32:56 2015 UTC,"Why would she not have the picture? Everytime she's moved through time she's kept all objects on her. Granted, I suppose she was in different clothes at the end of EP3."
lifeisstrange,3cf2sl,EcoleBuissonniere,3,Tue Jul 7 12:38:30 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the type of time travel she did at the end of episode three was completely different. She completely altered the timeline. The objects she had in the original timeline aren't there anymore (for example, like you said, she was in different clothes)."
lifeisstrange,3cf2sl,millerja1,6,Tue Jul 7 15:27:47 2015 UTC,Since she changed the entire timeline the objects probably dont exist. The only thing that would be the same is the same picture she used to travel back to the past because that still happened. She will need to let Chloe's dad die to restore the timeline
lifeisstrange,3cf2sl,TiberiCorneli,3,Tue Jul 7 13:18:59 2015 UTC,"She will need to let Chloe's dad die to restore the timeline   It'd be kind of neat if they have us go back and let Chloe's dad die again to try and restore the timeline, only to get back to the present and find we've just created another alternate reality."
lifeisstrange,3cf2sl,L1x3,2,Tue Jul 7 16:58:29 2015 UTC,"This is my little theory: 1.- Max convinces Chloe that she changed her timeline, showing her the draw on the piano (or the wall i don't remember so good) that you can paint while you're hiding the car keys. Then there are 3 options. a) Chloe says his life is worst than his other life (Max explained to her how he is in the other life timeline) b) Chloe prefers her other life c) Chloe don't believe her.  Also i think it can be that Chloe starts time traveling too. I know it sounds a little weird, but, maybe..."

lifeisstrange,3cf2sl,millerja1,2,Fri Jul 10 15:37:43 2015 UTC,"That is probably what is going to happen. Because if you think about it all the things we have done never happened now. Like for explain the handicap fund, why would that affect the future if that never happened now."
lifeisstrange,3cf2sl,Ara-Player,2,Tue Jul 7 17:19:45 2015 UTC,"She is now in a completely new timeline. She did a new way of time traveling; go back to the time the photo was taken, change something and you are catapulted in the new timeline without memory of what happened. It's a new ""universe"", it's not a time travel where she stays in one spot and keeps her items."

lifeisstrange,3cf2sl,Ara-Player,4,Wed Jul 8 18:05:03 2015 UTC,That's a good point. She did only have control over the area of the photograph. I had forgotten about that.

lifeisstrange,3cf2sl,FilmingMachine,4,Tue Jul 7 16:41:34 2015 UTC,"It seems pretty impossible to believe that they'd be named something so weird if it didn't relate to the Vortex that's coming. The fact that the party is called ""End of the World Party"" doesn't seem like a coincidence either. Definitely makes me think the Vortex Club members are behind everything, but that feels a little too obvious, and strange as they all still seem somewhat human/good despite being mostly shitty."

Then I noticed the Overwhelmingly positive, and was aware of the other calibre of games that hold that title on Steam. Just seeing the OverPos rating made my buy it. Played the first episode, next free $20 I got I bought the seasons pass."

She has effectively wiped the original Chloe from existence, stolen David Madsen's marriage from him (which he clearly cherished), and who knows what else.  I think it will be useful to stay in the alternate timeline to gather information that might be unobtainable in the original timeline, though. Perhaps Rachel Amber never went missing in this timeline?"

Giving the player such a big choice would definitely take up way too much resources on the dev's part. I bet we won't make the decision. No chance.  Another matter is we don't even know if her powers are the reason of all that crazy stuff happening. Yes I know that there is a lot of clues to support it but we aren't told by the game directly that it's because of our actions. It's just us of combining coincidences together. Or they want us to believe this?  The devs said that we will be given some closure and an explanation to Max's powers at the end and I believe in them pulling this one off :D"

lifeisstrange,3cf3i8,levir,8,Tue Jul 7 13:20:33 2015 UTC,"I'd return to the original timeline because I'm a selfish bastard who doesn't want to lose the Chloe I know, even if it means William must die.   EDIT: this doesn't have to do with Chloe being handicapped. It has to do with the fact that this Chloe is fundamentally a different person in this timeline. Hell, in this timeline Chloe might not even want to be friends with Max."
lifeisstrange,3cf3i8,MainaC,2,Tue Jul 7 17:37:00 2015 UTC,I bet that you wouldnt even try to save William if you knew the outcome...

lifeisstrange,3cewju,Ara-Player,3,Tue Jul 7 14:13:20 2015 UTC,"I would say maybe Chloe wrote the ""Rachel was here"" message along with the ""Chloe was here"" message after she went missing.  Yet again, it might be multiple different gamemakers with different handwriting writing different things."

lifeisstrange,3ccgfm,SaturnApollo34,24,Mon Jul 6 20:51:35 2015 UTC,I always end up making the same choices.   For some reason I can't force myself to do something different that isn't true to my personality - if that makes sense :P
lifeisstrange,3ccgfm,GymKerry,5,Mon Jul 6 21:04:13 2015 UTC,"I know what you mean. Its hard for me too, to do something i would not do myself. Thats why i create a different Max in my head in each playthrough. One Max is a Badass Mean Person, one is very cautios and one is secretly in love with Chloe and so on."
lifeisstrange,3ccgfm,TwitOne,3,Mon Jul 6 21:14:02 2015 UTC,"Yeah, some decisions feel tough. I'm on my second playthrough right now and am just doing pretty much the opposite of my frist session which includes a lot of Chloe shaming, not being nice to her now etc which feels really wrong ever since she's my favorite character. I also 'have to' be nice to Warren now even though I think he's cringey as fuck most of the time"
lifeisstrange,3ccgfm,zeCrazyEye,2,Mon Jul 6 21:23:00 2015 UTC,Pretty much the same.  If I play giving answers purposefully to obtain a different play through then it feels more like following a script than enjoying the experience.  I rather just keep my play through unique and leave the other play through options unexplored.  Makes it more interesting to hear about them from other people who made different choices than me too.

My main reason to start again, though, was a bit of a disappointment. When Max's EP2 SPOILERS throughout episode 2 onwards, I thought of Heavy Rain and how the investigating officer's choices on taking his meds/using his virtual reality tech for too long or too often HEAVY RAIN SPOILERS  I thought maybe the same principle was in place here, seeing as I back and forthed through time in my first playthrough A LOT before making a decision. So I played Bad Girl Max with the bare minimum rewinds required in the game. But the exact same scenes happen either way, bit of a let down but I'm sure it's for the plot :/"

After I finished Ep2, I switched my first and second playthroughs around (I started episode 3 with my 2nd save because I preferred that being my first run story instead). My original intent was to have enough save files to go through a bunch of different versions at once, but the game only gives three, which makes it harder since the longer the game goes on the more different paths there are to take."

I envy all my friends who have yet to play/plan on playing. I just LOVE experiencing the game from another person's perspective, seeing the different outcomes is irrelevant in that I don't so much care about the results, I care about how people react to the different outcomes, and I don't feel the game is too transparent now, even knowing everything I feel like everything has an impact regardless of how your choice ends up.  I'm out of people to watch at this point, so now, I wait... lol. I've nveer had this with any other game in my life. :|"

Actually Ep.3 ending is what got me into this game, but because of that I pretty much knew about everything that was going to happen (totally saved Lisa) and didn't pick my true choices instead focused on the best possible outcome ones.  I'm still thinking whether I should reset and play the way I'd play it seeing the game for the first time. What do you think?"

Though there is a certain youtuber who in all of choice based games I've seen him play so far made exactly the same choices as me. And I mean to the point where everybody in the comments was going crazy about what he'll do next and I was just chilling because I already had all the answers :P   In all of those cases I've played the game before watching his let's plays, so no cheating! Soul mates?"
lifeisstrange,3cciym,1n9i9c7om,2,Mon Jul 6 22:32:40 2015 UTC,"Aw, let's play videos. That's kind of spoiling the experience, especially if you've already seen the ending/cliffhanger. I thought I watched one on release of the first episode. But the game didn't catch my attention at the time. Then I discovered the game again on the pc and ps4 when episode 2 was just released. So I gave it a shot and only remembered the scene in the storm. So I did play through everything how I'd choose. But the other playthroughs were just for fun and enjoying the alternatives but unnecessary in the end. However I'd still suggest replaying the game, it's fun. And you've got a great chance that ep4 is released by completing all three save slots. xD"

To be honest, after I was done with ep1 is had my ""?'s"" and still wasn't 100% convinced of where this game was going to be heading. It felt like an introduction of some sort. But the game also felt like it was huge in it's own way. (amount of characters) So I was interested enough. And then came ep2 and 3. :D"
lifeisstrange,3cciym,chronoflect,2,Mon Jul 6 21:34:04 2015 UTC,"I played through about 3 times, one time was my original, one was the 'do everything wrong' and the other was just when I was bored and decided to do a playthrough again. I don't think the choices are transparent... well, even if they are, I'm sure you still enjoy playing through, and I'm sure you find things you didn't find before, like I found out more about Frank during an episode 3 playthrough, so it adds to the story."

lifeisstrange,3ccfve,melitonz,3,Tue Jul 7 08:54:37 2015 UTC,"Gameplay wise they are far improved.  Writing wise, well, the overall structure is the plot is much weaker. They're also a lot goofier than the first (the first half of the Citadel DLC felt like I was playing Saint's Row 4 but with worse writing), the characters are much, much better (though to be fair, the only decent character in ME1 was Wrex) and the game is also a lot cleaner in its design, it's a much better cohesive vision, rather than ME1:s jumbled pseudo-cRPG/shooter hybrid.  I would put ME2 and 3 as better than the first, it's not a unaminous thing to do, but not unheard of either. I'd say go for it."

But just wanting to save her so badly and knowing I didn't have a redo, I made all my conversation choices super carefully and she still jumped.  It was pretty devastating.  Episode 3 was just as good, but more in the sense that I want to see what happens next.  There are so many possibilities.  Everything seems to be out the window now.  Can't wait for Episode 4."
lifeisstrange,3ccdoa,cwhammer2,3,Tue Jul 7 03:49:48 2015 UTC,overwhelming majority of players were able to save her   That's actually a bit misleading. Right after the episode came out it was more 50/50. I imagine a lot of people can't deal with Kate dying so they reload ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
lifeisstrange,3ccdoa,DuckOfDuckness,11,Tue Jul 7 09:11:45 2015 UTC,"I don't care what you say, that EP3 ending is crazy."
lifeisstrange,3ccdoa,Ara-Player,5,Mon Jul 6 20:45:54 2015 UTC,"On my 'real' save file (not the one I'm just messing around with to see different dialogues) I failed to save Kate which felt kinda fucked up. Like, I just acted the way I would act in some situations and my own behaviours killed somebody... in a video game, but you get where I'm going. I told Kate to wait instead of telling the police and when she called I didn't answer the phone since this is how I am when I'm busy or about to go somewhere. I also took the picture in Episode 1 instead of intervening and it all summed up to her killing herself eventually which made me kind of sad, but then again I kind of knew that I wasn't making the 'best' decisions regarding her since the dialogues with her showed that the game is going in a certain direction. Even though I don't think it's reasnoable to just stand up for somebody for the sake of standing up for somebody even if you don't know what's going on (Ep1). Neither do I think it's wrong to tell a friend to stay rational. Last but not least, I don't feel like I MUST answer my phone everytime, so I still kind of stand with my decision. Doesn't mean I wanted her dead though..."
lifeisstrange,3ccdoa,TwitOne,3,Mon Jul 6 21:31:46 2015 UTC,"No matter what choices you made prior, you are still able to save her through dialogue. It's just more difficult because you have to answer a few more questions correctly."
lifeisstrange,3ccdoa,KaiG1987,2,Tue Jul 7 09:45:47 2015 UTC,that's actually what I figured when I had to go through a huge amount of dialogue and I did pretty good up until I had to use some bible quote and then she jumped :/
lifeisstrange,3ccdoa,TwitOne,3,Tue Jul 7 09:56:04 2015 UTC,"So it's not your choices that killed her, but it's because you didn't check all the items in her room maybe :/"
lifeisstrange,3ccdoa,Speedself,2,Tue Jul 7 16:00:04 2015 UTC,"yep, thats pretty much what happened. I got the clue that I should remind her of her sister since her dad/mom (cant remember exactly) were really furious about her tape and so on but I missed the final clue :("
lifeisstrange,3ccdoa,TwitOne,1 point,Tue Jul 7 16:08:32 2015 UTC,"Personally, I didn't remember the Bible quote, I was just very lucky, I feel quite ashamed for that x)"
lifeisstrange,3ccdoa,Speedself,4,Wed Jul 8 13:15:35 2015 UTC,"Episode 2 and 3 moved me a lot. Both time, as I succeeded in saving Kate, I felt, felt Max, hugely powerful in the moments that matter most to help those she loves. It's like she discovered her own strength in the darkest moments, with new powers. Stopping time to go talk to Kate and getting all the way back to Chloe’s last moment with her dad was simply awesome. It truly depicts how one can accomplish and better himself when it is least expected. But episode 3 hit harder simply because this moment of overwhelming joy is immediately followed by both confusion and emotionally crushing disappointment. It literally left me stunt, between the fact that we instantly realize that Max is in a place/time she doesn’t belong to and know nothing of, and the state of Chloe, whom we failed to help completely, simply bouncing her from one misfortune to another. I was first like : “YEAH, MAX THE TIME LORD, WE’RE SO GREAT !!!”, and 3 minutes was totally dispirited by such a failure. It was really sudden, even though I guess I should have expected such, after all this is a classic time traveling story trait to bring new disasters when one is fixed. I guess I simply didn’t expect the changes that we would provoke to be so brutal, hence the fact that the ending of the third episode was the one that affected me most."
lifeisstrange,3ccdoa,ThisBeing,3,Mon Jul 6 22:22:18 2015 UTC,How does saving Kate factor in my perception of the ending of episode one? I did not know at the time that she was gonna try and kill herself. Or is this just in the poll to divide it up between players that saved kate and the ones that did not?
lifeisstrange,3ccdoa,SaturnApollo34,2,Mon Jul 6 20:56:15 2015 UTC,"It's just for the latter. I mainly wanted to compare responses between episodes 2 and 3 (depending on whether you saved Kate in episode 2 or not), but I included episode 1 options just in case there were people out there who responded most to episode 1's ending."
lifeisstrange,3ccdoa,SaturnApollo34,2,Mon Jul 6 21:03:58 2015 UTC,Ok thanks because i chose episode one because of the melancholic music and imagery in the end which got me hooked on LiS. Thats why i was wondering why it mattered if i saved kate.
lifeisstrange,3ccdoa,jmnycrkt,2,Mon Jul 6 21:11:05 2015 UTC,"Well, I'm really glad I included episode 1 choices then. I was on the fence about including them."
lifeisstrange,3ccdoa,Lukiele,3,Mon Jul 6 21:15:59 2015 UTC,Episode 3 cause for me its all about the characters I love Chloe hands down if given the choice I would let Acadia burn to save Chloe and although I like Kate and tried to save her I didn't have strong emotions one way or the other and it looks like the story doesn't matter if she dies.  I like Episode one attempted date rape cause it's subject matter that you don't see in games and it set the stage that this game is going to get real.
lifeisstrange,3ccdoa,Jeffro75,3,Mon Jul 6 23:06:01 2015 UTC,"Hard to choose between EP1 and EP3.. It's not that I didn't really like the Kate ending, but I honestly wasn't too concerned about her since it was very hard for me to relate to her..  EP1's ending where Max tells Chloe about her powers and the freak snowfall happening really got me hooked. I played until that point without any reaction to the game and was just ""it's ok I guess"" but that moment where the snowfall happens and showed us all the characters made me think..   I wonder how every character would react to the snowfall? If Max's vision about the tornado was true, I wonder what David will do.. Will I have the powers to save who I want? How will the characters develop? All those questions came through my head and made me want to play it so much more."
lifeisstrange,3ccdoa,kemando,3,Mon Jul 6 23:16:00 2015 UTC,"I didn't save kate, and episode three's ending was so mind blowing that it made me stand up out of my seat and I just stared at the screen for like a full minute with my jaw hanging open. But as far as actually affecting me as a person goes, episode two actually depressed me and made me feel down for a couple days since i knew there was nothing I could do about it. (I'm not about multiple playthroughs)"
lifeisstrange,3ccdoa,Sebehr,3,Tue Jul 7 04:38:19 2015 UTC,"2, even though 3 hit REALLY close to home (my dad passed away a few years ago). Idk, 2 just affected me more for whatever reason, I just cared about Kate soooo much for some reason I just wanted to help her out, and then I fucked up, and there she went, such sad. :|"
lifeisstrange,3ccdoa,TAGsvk,3,Tue Jul 7 06:18:16 2015 UTC,"Hmm...Well, it's hard for me because I actually got the ending of Episode 2 slightly spoiled so it didn't hit me quite as hard. But I still had this intense feeling when on that roof with Kate, it really killed me. But Episode 3...I had no idea what was coming and it just floored me. When Chloe rolled up to the door I just kept going ""NO NO NO"" out loud. So I picked Episode 3, but they both affected me a lot. Like more than 99% of video games I've ever played."

I was doing REALLY well, but then I mixed up her mom and her dad when she asked who would care if she died, so I reminded her of her fucking abusive mom. I actually didn't see exactly what happened when she died. As soon as she stepped off the ledge I threw my headphones across the room and checked out. I've had people I care about come close to committing suicide. What happened on the rooftop is literally one of my worst fears."

lifeisstrange,3cb1jq,TeddyOfTheRoundTable,-2,Mon Jul 6 21:22:48 2015 UTC,"You want it to be less superficial? Alright.  It's always in the storytellers interest when working in a visual medium to make appearance some form of shorthand to understanding the character, or it atleast has to fit. Warren looks like a normal dude, but everyone who knows him calls him a gigantic nerd, and he also pretty socially awkward to such a degree it feels like the game is telling you he's a huge nerd rather than showing you.  He doesn't have to look like a nerf straight out of the 80's, but a little more unique look would certainly be appreciated."
lifeisstrange,3carco,konrad5558,17,Mon Jul 6 13:11:48 2015 UTC,"It's not possible. No matter what happens in episode one, Nathan will always approach you in the carpark just before you tell him.  In episode 2, it's not possible to tell him, nor is it in episode 3."
lifeisstrange,3carco,KyleD1997,3,Mon Jul 6 13:27:31 2015 UTC,Yeah after episode 1 when she goes to tell him she acknowledges telling him would just make him more clingy and changes her mind about it so she won't be telling him in the near future.

lifeisstrange,3c7z4i,zqwefty,8,Sun Jul 5 22:33:33 2015 UTC,"Kate not caring about much of anything doesn't necessarily mean suicidal, but it is a very big sign of depression. Suicide obviously closely linked to depression."
lifeisstrange,3c7z4i,BrettGilpin,3,Mon Jul 6 04:32:39 2015 UTC,"Actually ""I don't remember"" was the part that have it away, to me. Although you're right, it was somewhat of an assumption on my part. In real life I would have concluded that a person possibly had depression if they said that to me, but in the context of fiction it is the perfectly chosen subtle line to convey part of what it feels like to be suicidal, while the ""don't care about anything"" phrase more brazenly points to depression.  Part of that also comes from personal experience... I don't want to get too serious, but it was a pretty familiar thing to hear. That made it ready to read further into the line than the writers might have intended. Honestly I think that it's the most well chosen lines in all of Life is Strange."
lifeisstrange,3c7z4i,zqwefty,3,Mon Jul 6 05:05:10 2015 UTC,"May I ask why ""I don't remember"" in particular points to suicidal tendencies? I've had suicidal thoughts before (never attempted to go through with them, because the particularly worst time I had a friend that talked with me and made me think of things differently) but I don't see see how the ""I don't remember' adds to the likelihood. I'm interested."
lifeisstrange,3c7z4i,BrettGilpin,9,Mon Jul 6 05:09:33 2015 UTC,"TL;DR: it's mostly anecdotal, but I've said ""I don't remember"" in the same way before, so here's what it meant to me.  Alright, I said before I wasn't planning on getting to serious, but... here we go. I actually was going to make a post to this sub about the game's portrayal of depression, so I've already put some thought into this.  Obviously this is all anecdotal, so what I've experienced doesn't apply to everybody who's suffered from depression or been suicidal. I have had both of those things, though, for most of my life, at times untreated or under-treated.   One symptom I had that was rarely discussed was a distortion of time. Memories are strongest when we have emotional connections with them, and as happy things became less happy and I compensated for it by numbing myself to sadness and other emotions, things stopped being memorable. It was hard for me to feel anything other than anger, so unless something really pissed me off, most days became homogenous, and it just felt like going through the motions.  I was generally able to make up for it, especially during something important like class, but where once I could get away with talking in class or reading a book and still getting my work done, I lost the motivation and energy to multitask. I could remember what I learned in class, but not anything other students said to me.   When they came, suicidal thoughts were an inescapable distraction. Not only were they in my head and literally impossible to drown out when I'm supposed to be sitting silently and not disrupting class for other students, but usually I was more interested in contemplating my own death than whatever the teacher was saying. Besides, my GPA wouldn't matter if I was dead, and when my depression was really that bad it was hard to find motivation to fight the thoughts away or try to maintain focus.  I very vividly remember having the exact conversation in this scene several times. People ask how your day is, to be polite, and it's always been one of my least favorite questions to answer. To most people, I'd say ""good."" To some friends, I'd say ""fine,"" and they'd pretty much get what I meant without opening up to further conversation. But to a loved one, when I lacked the energy to lie, I'd admit ""I don't remember,"" and it was such a relief to be able to say that to them.  So when Kate said ""I don't remember,"" I immediately put myself in her shoes. My two big immediate thoughts were ""I've been there"" and ""She trusts Max implicitly."""

lifeisstrange,3c9pe9,creepyunturned,15,Mon Jul 6 04:53:50 2015 UTC,"I honestly doubt it's the most logical or plausible theory so far. If the universe wanted Chloe to die--as the main argument for this theory is--then why would it give Max the powers in the first place? All her actions and choices made after saving Chloe prove completely pointless and nonexistent, and the player is left completely excluded and isolated from the story. Without saving Chloe, there is no Life is Strange at all. To me, it seems that Max didn't set off anything--the storm was, seemingly, going to happen anyway. I think the universe gave Max the powers for her to try and prevent the storm somehow, find Rachel, or save the people in Arkadia Bay--just make some sort of major difference in the ways things would have been if she hadn't been able to change them. But then again, this is just my standpoint. For all I know, that cliche you speak of might prove disappointingly true, and I'll look like an idiot. Let's just hope it doesn't.  Besides, I really like Chloe--a lot of people do. Her dying would cause more of an outrage, than a sad appreciation among the fans, from what I gather."
lifeisstrange,3c9pe9,satanslittleghost,3,Mon Jul 6 05:11:44 2015 UTC,"I like this take, this is definitely something I'm wanting DONTNOD to use, where Max is our ""Everyday Hero"" and she fixes everything.

This doesn't make sense to me though, to be honest. If Max dies, say by Nathan's hand, Chloe would still be punk rock and William would still be dead. If anything, I just think the world would continue with Chloe still being sad -- possibly in a worse state even because of Max's death, while Kate would possibly be dead, since no one would be there to intervene at the roof. If anything, I feel like the ""Max would die"" route would make Arcadia Bay a sadder place to live in."

Maybe there is (for example) an ending in which you manage to save everyone (including Chloe), one where Chloe lives but other people have to kick the bucket for that, and one where Chloe dies."
lifeisstrange,3c9pe9,Gobblignash,1 point,Mon Jul 6 07:31:27 2015 UTC,"I hadn't heard of multiple endings until reading some of these responses, so that's definitely a big relief for me.

lifeisstrange,3c9pe9,jessebona,7,Mon Jul 6 19:19:09 2015 UTC,"As long as it's good I don't really care. The game so far seems to actually be mostly about Chloe, and she seems to have the major character arc (because Max is, let's be honest here, pretty boring) while a ""Chloe dies"" ending, would only be there to fuel Max's character arc. Thing is, she doesn't really have one, so honestly I think the Chloe ending is pretty unlikely.  That said, a superhappy ending where everyone is happy forever and the bad guys are turned into good guys or whatever would honestly not be all that fun as well, now that would be a lazy ending.  The ending doesn't really have to be completly tragic, actually, to have a tragic ending the story must build around it, like for example Silent Hill 2 and Spec Ops: The Line. Life is Strange doesn't really seem to build itself up like that. Personally I'm more wary for an awful ""everyone is happy forever"" ending, so I do hope they atleast have some form of sadness (sadness, not tragedy, there's a slight difference) or make it atleast a tiny wheeny bit melancholic. Otherwise I'mma start puking rainbows again."
lifeisstrange,3c9pe9,DoctorRimJob,12,Mon Jul 6 08:51:19 2015 UTC,"You're not the only one. It's been discussed before and there are quite a few of us around here who feel ""Chloe must die"" would be a lousy copout of an ending."
lifeisstrange,3c9pe9,Grayson754,6,Mon Jul 6 05:04:58 2015 UTC,"I worry more that if you excluded all the endings that people have stated are not acceptable, it becomes impossible for them to have any ending at all. The shippers want a choose your ship menu. The time travel aficionados want something pristine and original, every other person is chasing their own personal ideal ending, and this is because they've had time to think about what they want.   I think that for me in particular, it's been a surprise for me to see people have this sense of ownership over the characters. This character must live. That character must end up with the other character. It's very strange to me. I just want a good story. Wholly original stories are impossible and I'd be happy with an original combination of unoriginal elements, but it seems as though the deep affection that people have for the setting and the characters may cause problems for Dontnod. They literally can't please everyone and whilst I hope that the story was finalised long ago and that they stick to it, I worry that they are going to try and fudge it to keep people happy. Indeed, their future may depend on it.   It could get really ugly though. Which is a shame. I hope people can cut them some slack and just treat the ending on it's own merits. I always prefer the beginnings of stories to the end and I often watch only the start of a film I've seen already, just to enjoy that sense of limitless potential. Potential which dwindles to nothing at the end.   Because of the episodic format, people have had a lot of time to speculate about what they want to happen. Time that they would not have had in other circumstances and this puts a lot of pressure on the developers to deliver something amazing. But many if not most of these things that people have envisaged will not happen and I'd encourage people to understand that and be prepared for it. We've had months and months to build our hopes and expectations to an unreasonable crescendo and I can't see how some people are not going to be disappointed."
lifeisstrange,3c9pe9,Ara-Player,5,Mon Jul 6 09:10:32 2015 UTC,"As long as they avoid the ""You saved the world, everyone lives and nobody remembers a thing"" trope I'll be pretty happy. Even the ""best"" ending should have you face some unpleasant consequences."
lifeisstrange,3c9pe9,Ara-Player,3,Mon Jul 6 11:11:48 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure it's been stated somewhere that the game will have multiple endings, so there's that. I do believe that something happened and Max didn't just suddenly get these powers. I'm sure if Chloe dies, people wouldn't be happy, but then again, why would they? It's supposed to be an emotional game.  Anyways, I don't think it's Chloe that's meant to die. I think it's Max. She was in the bathroom when Nathan arrived, but fortunately the butterfly came to distract Max before he entered, and thus she was able to hide. Because of her actions, she was able to save Chloe the second time around, but I believe if Nathan knew she was in there then things would have gotten very bad, possibly ending with Max dying.   See, I believe that Max has always been a shy, innocent, awkward girl at heart, but throughout the last 3 episodes, we've seen her change into a different girl- we see her open up and make friends, solve mysteries, reunite with her best friend, and perhaps fall in love. She's learning about life, people, and she's losing a bit of her innocence at a time. By the end of it, Max changes into a strong, young girl ready to take on the world- perhaps with her lover (Chloe or Warren), but the twist is that she's the only one who can stop that vortex because she's the one that was meant to die. I could go deeper into it, but right now I'm running out of time. (Irony!)  That's just my little theory, but who knows how it could play out? We're just now on Episode 3, and we still don't have any answers. I believe I'm more worried about Dontnot trying to wrap all of this up in the final episode, ultimately rushing the conclusion. Personally, that'd make me more unhappy than the ""Chloe must die"" ending. Either way, I'm anxiously awaiting Episode 4 and hopefully get some answers as well. This is definitely a game that I'd love to see everyone play, because right now, it's beating the hell out of a lot of this years games."
lifeisstrange,3c9pe9,GrayManTheory,3,Mon Jul 6 08:52:53 2015 UTC,"I SERIOUSLY doubt that they would do that, it might be 1 of the multiple endings since they nearly 100% confirmed it but if it's the only ending.... goshh. I won't like it, they have so many ways to go, I really hope they don't come up with something obvious like that."
lifeisstrange,3c9pe9,kemando,3,Mon Jul 6 10:30:48 2015 UTC,"In fact, it would be cool if in EP4 somewhere in the ending we could  go all the way back and let Chloe die in the bathroom incident, so then we have 3 different timelines and things are getting shaked up even more; but it would seriously suck if they pulled that cliche at EP5"
lifeisstrange,3c9pe9,AlvarezMd90,3,Mon Jul 6 10:33:28 2015 UTC,"I certainly hope they don't pull a time travel reset ending.  But as I've said before, the only other Dontnod ending I've experienced was Remember Me and that was a cliché ""Luke I am your father"" reveal.  Combine that with the fact that they've already provided Max with a direct path to the beginning (well, two - the classroom selfie and the bucket reflection in the butterfly photo) and yeah I'm worried a bit."
lifeisstrange,3c9pe9,StopStopHibariKun,2,Mon Jul 6 18:56:52 2015 UTC,"but we dont know where those pictures went or if they were even taken in the new timeline, or if they were retained.  Since Chloe has now presumably been away from blackwell and everything else because of her accident, she never needed to be saved, perhaps Max was never in the bathroom, never took the class selfie, never took the butterfly photo, etc.  Since it is known that Max isn't affected by her rewind, this could be changed by the new way her rewind was used, where in she wasn't directly rewinding the world around her, but went back into her own young body. We see this change resulting in her wearing completely different clothes, in a completely different part of the school at presumably the same time that she went ""into"" the photo. Max has no memory of her life within the new timeline, so it was basically a different person living her life up until she regained control. This could very well have affected Max and changed everything from before completely, like a complete rewrite. We see evidence of this in her clothes being completely different (not wearing rachel's) and she's in a completely different location (not her room) which has never happened before when using her rewind, she always stood still and retained clothes and personal affects.  We don't even know if ""new"" votrex club Max was even aware she could time travel, or if she even had powers at all, or if they were ""reinstated"" after ""real"" max took back control over her autopilot body.  And to better understand what I'm saying about Max living her life after the William rewind incident on auto pilot, think of basically the movie ""Click"" with Adam Sandler when he fast forwards, he lives his life... But it's not ""him"", he basically zones out between points of time, like blacking out. Or like Kate says to Victoria after being accused in the showers ""That wasn't ME"" meaning she considers her blacked out state a different person entirely. I hope this makes sense :|"
lifeisstrange,3c9pe9,JayBirdCool,2,Tue Jul 7 06:37:42 2015 UTC,I really don't know what to expect from this game's ending. :P  Though I hope it'll be scary and tense.

lifeisstrange,3c85mz,Monsterz,4,Sun Jul 5 20:33:50 2015 UTC,It's what art tries to show in a way.  In a lot of cases most forms of art can't really resonate with us because it's just an abstract or bare visual impression with no relatable emotional context.  The fact that the folk at Dontnod had the guts to bring life for many people up in a game and the game exists is a good thing.

lifeisstrange,3c5mge,redsoxspace,18,Sun Jul 5 04:17:15 2015 UTC,That's what made Rachel's betrayal so devastating for Chloe. She borrowed the money from Frank so she could run away with Rachel and was now being threatened by him to repay it and then she learns that Rachel was sleeping with Frank.

But if you think of it as cash flow for his business, it's a very reasonable amount. If he hadn't loaned it out to Chloe, he wasn't going to spend it, he was going to use it to buy more drugs and then sell them at a profit.  Maybe he saw loan-sharking to Chloe as being easier/more profitable than selling a pound of weed.  Maybe he was manipulated by his secret girlfriend Rachel.  Or maybe he saw it as a way to launder some money -- perhaps Chloe wasn't going to use cash to pay him back."

lifeisstrange,3c21ao,strangimation,6,Sat Jul 4 15:12:27 2015 UTC,"If you're going to go through with this, I'd suggest you start small and try not to work on multiple locations at once.  Especially if you're going to try to recreate all the locations to any reasonable degree of accuracy.  Maybe start off with a smaller location, like Max's room, so you can get a good idea for how much time it takes to reconstruct it all.  You might be surprised at how long it takes.  Here's an album with a few behind-the-scenes of the sets I've recreated for various animations/renders I've made.  Even though I didn't need to accurately recreate any of the scenes, and even though I only needed to properly complete parts of them, they each still took many hours of work.  You need to open numerous models to work out what is what (the names aren't always perfect descriptors, especially when it comes to the architecture items!), sort through the texture files for even longer to work out what goes with what ... and then piece it all together into the one scene.  You'll need to spend a fair bit of time in-game preparing reference images to make sure you know where everything should go as well.  A tip that might help.  See if you can script all the texturing.  I've been doing it all manually as I decide which models I want to use.  But if you're going to use all the models for a given scene, make use of the recorded diffuse/specular/normal maps in the .mat files.  Write a Python script to read the .mat file for each model and assign the textures as recorded (in Blender, or whatever else).  This will save an enormous amount of time.    However, another issue is that it's not always obvious how things should be textured.  The tornado model you posted is a great example - some parts are textured, some parts don't appear to be (just normal maps), etc.  Hard to work out exactly how you should set up all the materials.  Near as I can tell, the material files don't give enough information.  Never tried to slog it out though, maybe it becomes more obvious on further examination.  But my warning is simply that a number of items aren't textured so obviously, so you'll need to spend a bit of time working them out.  One fun aspect of this is seeing if you can find any items that never ended up in their environments.  Why is there a wine bottle associated with Kate's room, for example? ;)  Anyway, good luck, but I think the scope of this project might be a bit larger than you currently realise ... so maybe start small (the front yard of Blackwell?) and build from there.  If it gets too much, you can always stop with one or two completed areas to show! :)"
lifeisstrange,3c21ao,Theroonco,2,Sat Jul 4 18:09:50 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the insite. I love the work you made for the renders :O So awesome!    I've already gotten a few textures to work in Source Engine already and only need the Texture and Normal Mapping for them to work (Which they do now)  As for the size of the project itself, I do not plan to go full on ""Lets make every street and road in Arcadia Bay"", more along the lines of making all the environments seperatley with teleports between each location. E.G. Leaving the girls dorm will fade the players screen to black then reverse it once they have been teleported to the right location.    Furthermore, It is no longer just me working on the project. I have a few modelling friends (also including the guy who uploaded the player models on Gmod Workshop) who are helping convert / rigging the models to be ready for porting. I am currently working on getting the textures for each area. Once complete I have to design the layouts of each area and begin texture / lighting of the map.

Samuel said that he could hear the whispers of the squirrels so maybe he can hear Rachel somehow too."
lifeisstrange,3c2w12,Madlap,2,Sat Jul 4 18:59:49 2015 UTC,Why do you think Rachel can go back throughout time? I've heard people say they think that but there hasn't been a real reason why.
lifeisstrange,3c2w12,lixyna,9,Sat Jul 4 19:06:32 2015 UTC,"I just think she's too perfect. Almost everyone has something good to say about Rachel and she got along with basically everyone. She has a 4.0 GPA, did a bunch of extracurricular activities, partied even more than Nathan, hung out with frank, hung out with Chloe. It seems very suspicious like where would she even get the time to do all of that. Also, when we play as Max we can use the time travel powers to get along with members of the vortex club and make sure we say the right thing, so it makes sense if Rachel had powers and was using them to get along with everyone and for other stuff."
lifeisstrange,3c2w12,Courier-6,2,Sat Jul 4 19:15:43 2015 UTC,Ah ok I see why people think that now. I'm not a personal believer of that theory however but I get it.

lifeisstrange,3c2w12,Courier-6,2,Sun Jul 5 02:09:20 2015 UTC,So you're saying he was hoarding the sunglasses and pics for a pleasant day at the beach?
lifeisstrange,3c2w12,athorist,4,Sun Jul 5 02:11:23 2015 UTC,"No, I think he's going to eat them because he ran out of nuts...   I was thinking more in terms of proof or evidence of some kind. Not necessarily in the legal sense. When I thought the Blackwell mystery was a conventional criminal case, I thought they could be trophies, but then why leave them lying around like that. Samuel seems to know something about what's going on. As it says on the wiki, someone left a hammer under the cleaning trolley. A hammer with which Max broke the fire alarm and saved Chloe. Both are likely to be his responsibility. (tools and cleaning trolleys). It's almost as though he's facilitating something, but without being directly involved or actively intervening."
lifeisstrange,3c2w12,lislislislislis,19,Sun Jul 5 02:46:15 2015 UTC,"Dont expect to many nice views on Warren here. Even tho, on a recent post, it was made clear that after Max, Warren would be the 2nd most popular choice to hang out with (if one could), the amount of loudmouths calling him creepy and evil is enormous. I dont see anything wrong with that dude, he's just a horny teenager trying to get into Max's panties (please for the love of a god of your choosing dont take this literally, I fucking dare you  :D). Just like every other 18 year old male teen, nothing special at all."
lifeisstrange,3c2w12,jessebona,16,Sat Jul 4 11:44:32 2015 UTC,"All of the Warren hate is annoying. I personally don't care about him, but seeing such vocal hate really bothers me. If it was any other character nobody would allow it. It's really gross how everyone acts like it's okay."
lifeisstrange,3c2w12,redsoxspace,12,Sat Jul 4 11:54:47 2015 UTC,"Maybe you're just sensitive? (I know, that sounds bad, etc.)  To be fair, I can see people on reddit liking Warren, because he's basically reddit's spirit animal."
lifeisstrange,3c2w12,jessebona,5,Sat Jul 4 17:38:16 2015 UTC,"Probably haha. I mean, I don't like warren. He reminds me of a friend I had who was creepy and into me. But I just don't like the trend of being so okay with hating a character people like."
lifeisstrange,3c2w12,redsoxspace,3,Sun Jul 5 00:23:39 2015 UTC,"Have you asked him why being sensitive sounds bad? I was pretty much on the fence until I went back and saw that dialogue. And then I rejected him, and it just got worse...  Some characters I think you're meant to hate (death of the author aside). Lots of people like Rorshach from Watchmen, and he's terrible. I've seen a lot of people on the steam forums hating Chloe, I think that's less clear cut. But the game's shown us quite a few reasons to hate Warren, and so far there's not much to excuse it.  (maybe hate is too strong, maybe the story will resolve so that he learns to be better, but that doesn't excuse his actions).  I don't want to stop people from liking Warren, but I have my reasons for not liking him, even if he's not involved with what happened to Rachel Amber."
lifeisstrange,3c2w12,jessebona,7,Sun Jul 5 01:47:12 2015 UTC,"There's so much Warren hate because a lot of people (especially on Reddit) have either been a Warren or had to deal with a Warren. Only a little of the hate is like ""GOD WHAT A DESPICABLE PERSON"", most of it is just the disappointed sigh of recognition.  Like most of the characters in this game, he's a decent person but he can't deal with his emotions and that makes him act badly sometimes."
lifeisstrange,3c2w12,redsoxspace,3,Sat Jul 4 19:02:58 2015 UTC,Who says we have a problem with any other character being hated? I welcome a discussion of the reasoning behind someone's dislike or like of a character.
lifeisstrange,3c2w12,jessebona,3,Sat Jul 4 12:26:06 2015 UTC,"I think the point they're making is if someone disliked Max or Kate and said why, they would get shit on since everyone likes them, but it's totally ok to bash Warren. Even though the worst thing Warren has done is be slightly creepy, which in the context of this game is really pretty harmless but everyone hates him for whatever reason"
lifeisstrange,3c2w12,redsoxspace,2,Sat Jul 4 21:47:44 2015 UTC,"Eh, I suppose some people would do that. I would argue the point with someone who disliked a character, popular or not. That is what a discussion board is for is it not?"
lifeisstrange,3c2w12,whyThisFar,4,Sat Jul 4 22:19:40 2015 UTC,"Yeah it just bothers me (like lixyna) that people are so biased against Warren, cherry-picking all the creepy things he's done and ignoring how he helps max, takes a beating for her, comforts her when she needs it, etc. People are allowed to have their opinions of course, it just seems like some people go overboard with their hatred of Warren, when there are other characters in the game that are much more evil"
lifeisstrange,3c2w12,whyThisFar,3,Sat Jul 4 22:24:09 2015 UTC,"Him taking a beating for her would be noble if he didn't turn around and use it to try and score points almost immediately. That's his problem, he goes about everything the wrong way. He gives the impression he isn't nice because he's nice, but because he wants Max."
lifeisstrange,3c2w12,chattypenguin,2,Sat Jul 4 22:31:25 2015 UTC,"He did that because she didn't bother to even text him ""thanks"" after he got punched in the face for her... I'd be a little miffed too. I guess we can agree to disagree though. We'll see what happens with Warren in the next couple episodes, but I'd be willing to bet he's one of the few characters without anything to hide and in fact he'll do something to save Max or help her out"
lifeisstrange,3c2w12,QueerlyProsaic,3,Sat Jul 4 22:39:16 2015 UTC,"Oh totally, the wait is killing me. I only suspect him because he's so squeaky clean. The guy who seems innocent probably has something to hide in a mystery story."
lifeisstrange,3c2w12,jpae20,3,Sat Jul 4 22:56:00 2015 UTC,"Yeah you could very well be right. After the first few episodes I've learned that anything is possible in this game, and any of the characters (except Kate and Chloe) could be guilty. I'll be super sad if Warren backstabs Max though :("

lifeisstrange,3c2w12,athorist,2,Sat Jul 4 17:22:12 2015 UTC,"I think Warren mentioned some time ago that the movies/cinema would be an hours' drive from this Arcadia Bay town. This particular movie seems to only play at this place and in the way he said that, and his intention to get there in his own car seems creepy to me. EP2 SPOILERS, he mentions the movie again (pretty fast, definitely not blowing it off) and it seems he is damn sure that he will eventually see it, with Max of course.  I don't hate Warren, he might be just awkward, but I can imagine something bad to happen if Max agrees to go to the movies."

There is no indication that he even knows which room/window belongs to Max (especially since you can never actually see through the windows, which might be either game limitations or the windows are made to be one-way, which is not impossible given that this is a well-funded private school). He is also a significant distance away so much so that he wouldn't be able to see much more than maybe the light turning on and some limited movements.   -has a gps on you according to Brooke   This is a joke made by a jealous girl who probably thinks of Max as a rival for Warren's affections. In no way should you ever think of taking this seriously.   -photoshopped a picture of you 2 together    There is nothing in the game that even vaguely gestures at this. It was a completely innocuous photo that he got developed on his own time.    -ditched taylor so he could go with you to the movies    Pretty sure it was Brooke, who he does not have a crush on. Max on the other hand he does have a crush on. I don't know about you, but between going to the movies with a friend versus your crush (whom you get along with pretty well), the crush would be the obvious choice.    -gets pissed off at you if you don't want to go to the movies and then continues to ask you if you want to go to the movies   Yes, this is annoying, he is being way too overbearing and selfish about wanting to go with Max and not Brooke. But that is in no way to any degree as bad as what Chloe tries to manipulate Max into doing and then gets pissed if she doesn't."

That's creepy no question.  You know I thought it was a joke too, but she didn't say it like a joke at all. I think she meant it seriously.   Um when you make plans with someone. Especially with someone who likes you. You don't cancel on them to go with another person. That is so douchey. If you don't like them you shouldn't have gone with them in the first place.

If you talk to him after you turn him down, he says he's going to ask Brooke instead. And keeps trying to get you to go with him. Even if you accept the inconsistency (there's another one if you blame Mr Jefferson, but I think that's just the game believing what you say to him earlier), someone non-creepy wouldn't keep asking you.  I don't necessarily think Warren is involved with Rachel Amber's disappearance/ death, but the people who think his actions are creepy are not wrong."

lifeisstrange,3c1tcw,jasonisconfused,7,Sat Jul 4 05:06:49 2015 UTC,"I love this! Thanks! I like the Myers-Briggs personality profiles. I believe I am INFJ but with my social anxiety I am a little less 'certain of things' and doubt myself. Also not having spent much time with people makes it a bit harder to truly know what others are feeling, or at least not knowing what to say to make them feel better. Thank you for putting the effort into this great post! :) What type are you?"
lifeisstrange,3c1tcw,Jessie246,3,Sat Jul 4 01:37:20 2015 UTC,"Haha, thanks! I know the feeling of not being sure. But Fe can also manifest as simply an interest in how everyone is feeling and wanting everyone to be okay. I love high Fe users. In any case, if you are an INFJ, trust your gut: Ni is that intuition that is probably right right at the first glance, before you start doubting and overthinking it. Someone actually wrote a book about that.  I have a good friend who's totally into this stuff, and typing me has been a fun ongoing conversation. I'm an INFP, same as Max, which is probably why I took to the game so quickly and why I'm the most sure about Max: I know an INFP when I see one  :)"
lifeisstrange,3c1tcw,Jessie246,3,Sat Jul 4 02:17:32 2015 UTC,Ill have to check that book out! Thank you :)
lifeisstrange,3c1tcw,chattypenguin,5,Sat Jul 4 02:51:53 2015 UTC,Does anyone else feel like the types are bullshit? Like they are just telling you exactly what you want to hear?
lifeisstrange,3c1tcw,shawnjawn,6,Sat Jul 4 14:11:25 2015 UTC,"Uh oh. Here come the TJs. Kidding.  Yes, there are a few concepts here that a critical thinker will take into this discussion. The first is confirmation bias, which astrology thrives on: nobody approaches a character reading with a completely blank slate and they will be more inclined to really remember the hits and ignore the misses.   The second concept is the idea of encapsulation: human personalities are very complex, are relative to each other (one extrovert will look and feel like an introvert next to an extreme extrobert), and change as one grows, or is involved in different phases in life, or different environments, etc. We slip and slide between these signposts all the time.  There is a lot of talk about research and accuracy, if you're so inclined to read up about it.  Ultimately, what distinguishes this from astrology for me is that with this you have to type yourself, and, as can be seen in the conversations above, there are right and wrong answers. It's not that every single category will fit. Astrology, however, starts at one answer, from the stars, and you read it and, with confirmation bias, accept it. Still, with the ideas explored above, you shouldn't approach this system as a way to give you infallible answers about people. Don't make any decisions off of this. Businesses should not use MBTI.  Reality and people are wonderful and messy with unlimited interpretations and possibilities. This can't be seen as a way to gain capital-T Truth. I see it as frameworks to try out: lenses with which one can look at the world, one's self, and others.  Everyone wants to be known. From that comes every kind of love. I find this to be a great way of thinking about people, seeing that everyone has good in them, having patience and appreciation.  And it leads to great discussions, it cuts past the small talk."
lifeisstrange,3c1tcw,978am,3,Sat Jul 4 17:19:32 2015 UTC,"Very well stated! A couple of years ago I used to be incredibly into the MBTI, and even frequented the Personality Cafe. I actually went to Career Services at my University to see what occupation best fits me, and came out INFP, and borderline ISFJ as well somehow (the N/S and P/J were in favor of the former by around 5 points). I would make posts such as ""How do you other INFP's show interest or attaction"" or ""what kind of music do you INFP's like?"".  But then I kind of say how vague some aspects of this test could be, as well as confirmation bias, and self-report bias. The last question I asked the forum before I stopped was regarding how I came across a reddit post criticizing that astrology and MBTI were similar and I wanted their opinions on that. Most people were offended and I have never went back to post there again.   I don't know. I think that the MBTI is still somewhat interesting to think about, but there can be more difference within personality types than between, especially when regarding culture, language, and other aspects.   What I do love is reading people analyzing characters and functions. That's always been the trickiest part for me, but I think you did an outstanding job with it. :)"
lifeisstrange,3c1tcw,LemonC4ke,2,Sun Jul 5 18:18:06 2015 UTC,"It is completely unscientific.   However we humans are very eager to categorize everything and put labels on all the messy things in life including the essence of individuals. If we didn't invent MBTI I'm guessing we would have come up with something else that was just as bad, so I don't really get too worked up about it.  That isn't to say that their ""types"" don't match some people, they of course do but so does pretty much any adjectives.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myers%E2%80%93Briggs_Type_Indicator  Although very popular in businesses around the world, the MBTI is widely criticized by academics for its methodological weaknesses, poor statistical validity and low reliability."
lifeisstrange,3c1tcw,imjeans,4,Sat Jul 4 16:53:07 2015 UTC,"I think an argument could be made for Max being an (anxious and highly introverted) INFJ, actually. Honestly, her process of going after solution seems to me more like Ni than Ne. Ni is all about accumulating data until it clicks in an out-of-nowhere insight, while Ne is more likely to throw around possibilities and theories. And while Max intuitively just knows that all the things that are happening are connected, she doesn't know how yet, and is not exactly eager to presume. That seems more Ni than Ne. People seem to have a mistaken idea that Ni just knows things immediately. That's not true. Ni collects information. When it has enough information, it does an intuitive leap to conclusion based on all that information. The leap is usually correct, but it is a leap, therefore hard to explain why you believe it to people.   As for her having Fe, the way I've seen Fe vs Fi (and y'all are free to correct me here, since I don't have Fi), is that Fe is people-oriented while Fi is value-oriented (in the most fundamental way ofc, they are capable of both, but more like in terms of what feeds what). Max seems very much people-oriented to me (albeit anxious). C'mon, she's the biggest snoop around.   As for Ti, well, we didn't have Max do much that would point in the direction of her having either Ti or Te, and that's natural considering the fact that most people over-rely on their dom and aux functions. However, if Max has Se, she actively AVOIDS using it, which makes me think it might be her inferior. Se is all about doing things, getting in the action, living in the moment. Max, before she had superpowers, was reluctant to do anything. Once you do something, it impacts the future. Max is ALWAYS overthinking the future. Notice, whatever choice you make, Max immediately notes the worst case scenario of that choice. Before she reconnected with Chloe, she was literally incapable of living in the moment. Even Jefferson called her out on that.   And honestly? I don't see her as that nostalgic. She's nostalgic when something reminds her of the past, but otherwise, she's pretty much out of sight, out of mind. I could be wrong. If we want to gauge the full extent of her nostalgia, or lack of thereof, we'd have to see her in the five years she was gone, not now, when she has every memory of her past screaming at her from every place. That setting would make anyone nostalgic. But my INFP friend tends to get nostalgic without anything triggering that nostalgia, so that's more what I associate with Si.  As for Chloe, she is a Se dom, definitely, for sure. Why couldn't she be an extrovert? Clearly her issues with people are something that's unrelated to her personality type. But she is a Se dom if I've ever seen one, seriously. She's definitely ESXP, and I tend to lean towards T for her. I honestly don't see how her being emotional about things that are legitimately a cause for anybody getting emotional is a proof of her being a feeler? What's with this stereotype that thinker - cold and stoic, feeler - overemotional mess? Being a feeler is not just about emotional expression, it's also about navigating those emotions for yourself and for others and making sense of them. Upset thinker is actually more likely to get irrationally emotional about upsetting things they can't make sense of happening. Just look at what sorts of explanations Chloe comes up with about why her life sucks. That's her trying to find rationalization in that mess, when there are no logical explanations.   And, aside from all of that, her trying to steal money from Nathan is such an Se-Ti act. No thought of consequences, no moral qualms, just a momentary opportunity. As is her trying to find out uses for Max's power by trial and error. A feeler would probably concentrate on actually using them for the greater good (and Max does think she was given them for a reason), Chloe's first reaction is about how it is a toy. So, yeah, I'd say her thinking is way above her feeling. Her feeling is more about people being in her corner than it is about morality, as well. A tertiary/inferior Fe often manifests in that way. It can manifest in more beneficial ways, but for someone with Chloe's issues, I don't exactly expect it to. That being said, it can also manifest in more damaging way, in using and manipulating people, and despite Chloe having this criticism levelled at her quite often, I don't believe that's the case.   As for her Ni, for an inferior, it's actually not that bad. She actually has plans for the future, y'all! Very vague plans that would run into million complications once there, but that's what her Se is for.  (lol sorry, I'm too lazy to do the rest of them.)"

lifeisstrange,3c162m,jessebona,11,Fri Jul 3 20:58:37 2015 UTC,well lot of people think that was just joking - same as kiss and all that flirty stuff that Chloe to Max and vice versa had in kilotons
lifeisstrange,3c162m,jessebona,21,Fri Jul 3 21:03:08 2015 UTC,She sounded pretty sincere in that scene.
lifeisstrange,3c162m,978am,14,Fri Jul 3 21:40:00 2015 UTC,Yeah. I don't get it. There's nothing jokey about it. Plainly stated along with all the other mentions of how much Rachel meant to her.
lifeisstrange,3c162m,fima1fim,27,Fri Jul 3 21:45:14 2015 UTC,"There's too much that hints that Chloe was in fact in love or at the very least had a crush on Rachel, I mean, didn't everyone notice how pissed off she was when she found out Rachel was sleeping with Huggie the Druggie? you don't get THAT angry at your ""best friend"" for something like that, even if your friend ""lied"" or hasn't told you about it, why should you care? it's their life and their decision to sleep/go out with anyone they want  so why be that angry?  Chloe was into Rachel, it's obvious on so many levels I don't even know how people can say otherwise, like, haven't they payed any attention while playing?  Also the kiss? it was a double dare, samuel jackson teached me that when you double dare, you most certainly ARE NOT messing around."
lifeisstrange,3c162m,Infamy7,7,Fri Jul 3 21:30:11 2015 UTC,"Exactly... Also I saw there reference to Pulp Fiction, actually game mentioning this movie when Warren sends you that movie list so I dont think its coincidence, not mention that its famous line."
lifeisstrange,3c162m,moeru_gumi,11,Fri Jul 3 21:44:50 2015 UTC,"Not only does Chloe say she has crush, but her & Max have an entire conversation about it. (In my game at least.) I'm not sure if Rachel had the same feelings for Chloe or if they actually hooked up.  The only argument that can be made is that the Chloe/Max flirting is just them joking around, maybe testing the water. I think Chloe is going to eventually realize she does have feelings for Max once she stops being so hung up on Rachel. The player is going to decide if Max is into it or not. This way Max's sexuality can be open to interpretation since she is the main character, also giving anyone who may have a problem with it an out."
lifeisstrange,3c162m,Infamy7,10,Sat Jul 4 00:58:54 2015 UTC,"This was my interpretation of it as well. They are childhood friends, and Chloe is very conflicted about how much she still needs Rachel (who has become almost a quest in Chloe's life at this point, and she fears Rachel is dead), and the current reality of the presence of Max, someone she has trusted and liked being around for many years, AND NOW HAS an added bonus feature of superpowers.   I assumed in Ep1 and 2 that Rachel and Chloe were a couple, or at least that Rachel made it seem like they were and Chloe was head over heels.  Chloe was completely unaware of Rachel's involvement in any other relationships (In Ep.1 we hear a rumor that Rachel was involved with Mr. Jefferson), and feels 'betrayed' by it. Chloe thought, or at least wished, that they were in a committed relationship.  Between missing Rachel and also thinking she may be dead, and having Max right there trying to support and help her, it's very possible that she is coming to rely on Max more than she thought, and is developing more adult feelings for her.  I did think that Max wearing Rachel's old clothes was pretty creepy, for several reasons.  Not only is it slightly fulfilling Chloe's wish to have Rachel back, but several other people (Joyce, Frank) react strongly to seeing the clothes on Max and comment about how she reminds them of Rachel. Is Chloe trying to replace her old girlfriend with Max, or just make herself feel better by seeing how different Max really is, even in the same clothes? Is Chloe trying to put Rachel's ghost to rest and move on, or trying to resurrect her into a currently breathing person?  It's verrryyyy complex and of course the ending of Ep3 takes us in a WHOLE new direction. :D"
lifeisstrange,3c162m,Infamy7,6,Sat Jul 4 01:45:05 2015 UTC,"About ""Max vs Rachel"" Rachel was a Max-substitute, and now Max is a Rachel-substitute. Make of that what you will. But I think here will our decisions heavily impact game. Like I wrote here - http://redd.it/3bi7wd In my game when Chloe said to Max at the pool that ""youre like most humble, talented and something person I know"" and Max ""More than Rachel ?"" and she responsed ""I am not her groupie""... Also, that background, she replaced Max face with Rachels, I think that have big simbolic meaning."
lifeisstrange,3c162m,satanslittleghost,1 point,Sat Jul 4 10:18:42 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah, Chloe asks for the kiss after Max puts on Rachel's clothes. It got me thinking was she asking for a kiss from Max or Rachel? I think part of her pulling away was a mix of shock, confusion and realizing that the situation was totally fucking weird.   I just can't tell if Rachel/Chloe were actually a couple or intimate at all yet. (It does seem likely) It's undeniable that Chloe wants a relationship with her. It also seems that Rachel knows, hence the hiding certain things from her.   Chloe just screams insecurity, so maybe she was afraid to admit anything for fear of ruining their friendship. She mentions more than once about how Max could pretty much ""put the moves"" on anyone without consequence. ( i.e Fear of rejection)"
lifeisstrange,3c162m,jasontredecim,2,Sun Jul 5 15:09:00 2015 UTC,"no... I am pretty sure that Max doesnt had Rachel clothes when they kissed... Also after Chloe found out about Rachel any chances that Chloe may left some feelings for her are out of window even if she started valuing Max above Rachel (some commentaries ""Max vs Rachel"", whole pool episode - like she cared more about getting Max to pool rather that getting evidence since she had bikini on herself so she planned that, also that background...)"
lifeisstrange,3c162m,KaiG1987,1 point,Mon Jul 6 17:35:20 2015 UTC,"Ah, you are right about the clothes (noted it above)."
lifeisstrange,3c162m,moeru_gumi,12,Mon Jul 6 22:40:34 2015 UTC,"Chloe directly states that she had a crush on Rachel, when Max asks her about it in Episode 3. Now, I know people like to pass that--as well as the kiss--off as just play. But there's no doubt that Chloe, on the side of showing interest in women in general, definitely was into Rachel."
lifeisstrange,3c162m,moeru_gumi,4,Fri Jul 3 21:51:34 2015 UTC,"To be honest, I was playing LiS with the assumption at this point that Chloe and Rachel were full-blown lovers, which is why Rachel and Frank cut Chloe so deep. I think it went beyond unrequited love jealousy, and the blase way Joyce reacts to ""Rachel"" coming downstairs in the morning also suggested she was used to that."
lifeisstrange,3c162m,moeru_gumi,4,Sat Jul 4 07:30:03 2015 UTC,"I dont think that they were lovers, only that Chloe wanted to be. Best proof to this is that letter. If Chloe and Rachel were really lovers, why that letter ? If Rachel was cheating on Chloe, there would be no point in writting that letter, and also it was not written like ""Sorry but I found somebody else"" but it was simply ""I found somebody""."
lifeisstrange,3c162m,moeru_gumi,0,Sat Jul 4 10:02:57 2015 UTC,I find it weird too because Max never gave thought about this. Like she is either completely blind or she know that all along so there is no point in discussion or even thinking about it.
lifeisstrange,3c162m,Swoove,4,Sat Jul 4 10:57:05 2015 UTC,"What bothers me about this most is why Max never gave second thought about this ? Yea, your best friend front of you just clearly said that ""I have crush on girl"" and Max is like ""hmmm, ok"". Really why doesnt she never made commentary in her mind (as she doing with every pointless thing in game) or write this to diary on this fact or about anything else like telling in truck to Chloe - ""Why you are so angry ? She found a boyfriend, thats all."" and Chloe could straight to Max say ""I was in love with her"".   I starting think its like Max knew about ""Chloe likes girls"" since day one. Its fucking weird when you starting it putting together with why Max never kept in touch with Chloe without reason after they went apart."
lifeisstrange,3c162m,axslayer33,6,Sat Jul 4 11:06:19 2015 UTC,"Max is more aware than she seems. She makes comments to herself like ""I think Chloe sees Rachel in her future"", etc."
lifeisstrange,3c162m,abisiden,5,Fri Jul 3 22:23:03 2015 UTC,"That would assume that Max had some problem with Chloe being gay or bisexual. Obviously Max doesn't care about that, it's not a problem for her. If her best friend said ""Yeah I have a crush on a girl"", and her answer is ""ok"", then she obviously isn't homophobic or threatened by it.  Why does that bother you? Do you think it would be reasonable for Max to be upset to learn that her friend is gay? Why do you think that Max being homophobic is why she didn't keep in touch?  It's much more likely that Max was trying to distance herself from a troubled friend and concentrate on school, as she said in Ep.1, trying to grow up and get away from the memories in Arcadia Bay. Max was very close to Chloe's family and loved Chloe's father and mother as much as Chloe did. The loss of Chloe's dad was also very upsetting for Max.  As we've seen Max doesn't deal well with loss and feeling helpless. She is still mourning over Kate, but also blaming HERSELF for Kate's death, which is very emotional and unreasonable. She doesn't deal well with loss, and deals in a different way than Chloe.  I have seen NOTHING in this game that suggests Max is judgmental or afraid of Chloe's interest in women. It's just a part of who Chloe is and Max accepts it."

lifeisstrange,3c03db,navipokoy,9,Fri Jul 3 15:36:12 2015 UTC,"I have, I really enjoyed unearthing the plot twists and turns. The game mechanics are incredibly basic (it's basically a search engine...and that's kind of it) and will inevitably put some people off, but for others, it will allow them to get into the experience more.   I think it's interesting that depending on your line of thinking and what you search, you can uncover one of the main plot points very early on. It makes the ending particularly interesting.   Hard to talk about it too much without spoiling it, but I thought it was a very thought-provoking game for £3-4. I'm glad I gave it a go."
lifeisstrange,3c03db,poho,4,Fri Jul 3 18:49:50 2015 UTC,"I saw a lets play of it. It looks cool and pretty interesting.

lifeisstrange,3bzoph,AtomicStryker,6,Fri Jul 3 15:05:19 2015 UTC,"These games work with the illusion of choice, and like with Telltale that's true here.   Answering your question, no. You have to go to the alternate universe. It's like previous choices.  No matter what you do, blame Nathan or not in the first episode, he will come after you. You have to hang out with Chloe and have to save her. You have to search after Rachel. You have to blame someone at the end of episode 2 even if you don't want to blame anyone as there is little hard evidence. Kate will get to the position of jumping no matter what, and she will probably become one of those traditional Telltale TWD type of casts -- either dead in game or never seen again. It makes little difference to the overarching plot in the end.  There are of course small choices that make changes in dialogue or additional details. For example, if you rat out Nathan to the principle you'll get some rather delightful photos. However, get them or not, they make no difference to the story's direction.  But as you said this is to be expected. It wouldn't be cost effective to do it any other way. You can't have a story with complete player control because there would be no story at all. But don't let that put you off; it is still a good experience even if your choices don't make much difference in the end.  Actually, speaking of which, there will apparently be multiple endings, so you'll probably get a decision where your final choice matters or they slowly add up towards the end, like in Heavy Rain."
lifeisstrange,3bzoph,SomethingSimsy,11,Fri Jul 3 19:48:16 2015 UTC,"there's a large difference between the quality of world building in Telltale and LiS. In the first season of TWD it's laughable how little anything matters. You can kick somebody to the curb knowing full well they'll most likely die and out of the other five or six people in your group only one person will mention it and nothing else will ever change. You have to choose between two people and decide who lives, if you choose the woman you get a fully fleshed out relationship with the main character, a fair bit of character development. If you choose the guy he shows up like twice and barely says anything, either way they both die later on in the exact same way. Nobody ever seems to remember your conversations or how you talked them, people seem to have no issue with you being completely nice and you being an asshole four seconds later. Everybody in TWD seems to have complete memory loss. And as far as this goes it's gone downhill since TWD.  There is the whole argument that the choices in TWD are important because you're crafting Lee as a person and I believe it's true that TWD is primarily about deciding how you react the basically the worst situation possible instead of somehow making the right choices to avoid bad situations but TWD (and every other Telltale game) is still very lacking in it's world building, nothing ever seems to carry over into the next episode unless it's a ""which character model are we showing you"" or ""what tiny bit of dialogue will we change"".  LiS obviously is limited because it's a voice acted 3D modeled world and that shit is expensive, but at least the world reacts to stuff. If you're nice to somebody they remember it the next episode, if Kate dies the school is just plastered in memorials and remembrances and little notes and comments from people. If you're completely behind Chloe she's nicer, she changes her phone background.   It's obviously not text-adventure-game level where a game can have forty seven endings and ten completely different major timelines but that's because there's a limitation to how much variety you can shove into a game that's more complicated than a multiple choice quiz. And obviously some things have to happen (Kate not being in Episode 3, ending up in the alternative world, Chloe getting shot, etc) But at least LiS is willing spend money and time on making stuff the majority of people most likely never will see so that it'll feel like the game has changed based on your decisions. LiS never feels like it's ignoring your previous decisions so they can move forward with the plot, it feels like you're given an appropiate amount of control within the confines of the story Dontnod has created for the game.   Obviously this might not be true if we get some really awful multiple choice ending that changes nothing, or if they actually do throw three episodes worth of choices out at the start episode 4 (I doubt they will) but barring catastrophic failure on Dontnod's part the game already seems to be more significent with it's choices than TWD or anything else Telltale.  TL;DR: Games can range from Telltale, none of choices matter outside of what your version of the character would do - to - LiS your choices affect both the character and world and have noticable effects - to - Twine/text adventure games complicated since it's rather easy writing a shitload of text compared to doing a shitload of assets and voice acting."

If you're nice to somebody they remember it the next episode, if Kate dies the school is just plastered in memorials and remembrances and little notes and comments from people. If you're completely behind Chloe she's nicer, she changes her phone background   To be fair, this is something Telltale does a lot better now too. Just finished up the last episode of Tales from the Borderlands and you get callbacks from decisions you made in the previous episode (even if they are mainly visual/conversational, not plot affecting).  I believe these games work best when the player forgets this pretty much is a theme park ride and buys in to the Illusion of Choice, and that only happens if the story writing is great.  Im really enjoying the LiS ride at the moment but as somebody who reads a lot of sci-fi I do worry about the time travelling. They tend to get too clever and overly complicated as the writer tries to avoid the usual clichés. For me the strongest part of LiS is the ""normal"" world. Dontnod have made me  (as a much older, british male), care about being a shy american girl, surrounded by the trials and tribulations of teenage drama!"
lifeisstrange,3bzoph,i1ocos,3,Sat Jul 4 02:54:04 2015 UTC,"I might have to give HoT or Tales from the Borderlands a try but my opinion was that their games had declined between TWD S1 The Wolf Within and TED s2.  But I actually find LiS is the only game where I don't find myself annoyed by how transparent these choices are. And maybe that's because of the relatively grounded nature of the game but it just really bothers me when somebody can have their face eaten off by zombies and literally two hours later in game time nobody seems to remember them existing. I'm not going to be mad when LiS doesn't deliver a fully fleshed out ending for every single play through possible, that's just silly to expect, but I'm at least satisfied with people not collectively forgetting who Kate was in like four hours so dontnod could skip making extra content"
lifeisstrange,3bzoph,SkateboardCop,3,Sat Jul 4 04:07:18 2015 UTC,"Telltale has been getting better. While they're still not the best, as you said it's damn near impossible to have all your choices matter. Even more so if you want a sequel. However, TWDS2 did end with what, 5ish different endings? And we most likely will see a third season. However, unless the entire first, or even first two, episodes of TWDS3 are used to show how Clem is driven to the same scenario from all ending points, then we'll see an ending Veto.   Now, maybe I'm looking with a bias, but I feel like LiS can be what defines /r/interactivecinema as a genre. The ending of Ep2 changes like a third of all dialogue in Ep3. Granted, so far the only real changes are with textures (such as the writing on Max's wall) or dialogue. I do feel like we may have choice-specific areas soon. Such as a funeral/hospital visit. And even Warren's movie night. Granted,  we only have 2 episodes left, and with the amount of plot we still need to cover, and the diversity of choices means that we will see some choices get ignored. However, I still feel like LiS will be one of the best IC games this year, if not the best IC game."
lifeisstrange,3bzoph,Bond4141,2,Sat Jul 4 19:12:18 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the well thought out reply, I totally get where you're coming from. Like I said, the game is fantastic so far and I can't wait to see what's coming next so it's not getting to me too much!"
lifeisstrange,3bzoph,IFE-Antler-Boy,3,Sat Jul 4 00:11:26 2015 UTC,"A certain choice in the Tales from the Borderlands episode 2 finale seems to have a very large impact. Honestly, I don't expect either series to have a huge amount of variation. These games have always been about the journey to me, rather than the destination. That being said, Life is Strange has been pretty good about showing a consequence for our actions. And there are supposed to be multiple endings, so hopefully they don't Mass Effect 3 it and just give us different colors."
lifeisstrange,3bzoph,lnrael,3,Fri Jul 3 20:34:29 2015 UTC,"I mean... Whether or not Kate dies is a major story change. You don't see Kate in episode 3 and so to some extent the scope of Kate's death is illusory (as is the impact of your choices), but in the same way, we are the ones imagining the story. The medium only gives us so many details and we create the rest; this is the case for every game: they can only provide an illusion.They'renotreal,jadensmith Another example is that depending on how you play you can be the one suspended at the end of Episode 2. Are these not major effects on the story based on your choices?  The entire flow of the story might not change*, but it's about the journey. The consequences of small choices are felt throughout the game. Imagine if the game ended with episode 2, with Kate jumping. Nobody would be wondering if your choices actually had an impact on the story.** I think if the game can end on something as impactful as season 2 did, that'll be good enough for me to believe in the illusion presented.  * Steins;Gate fans: the world line might not change from the alpha line to the beta line with any one choice.  **Ok, so technically this isn't entirely true since you can do whatever you want as long as you answer Kate's questions exactly right. But you have to know this. Knowing this is like... cheating. You're deliberately breaking through the illusion by knowing this."
lifeisstrange,3bzoph,Uodoo,2,Fri Jul 3 20:10:50 2015 UTC,"Thanks for this thought, I totally agree with what you're saying. When I played and finished Mass Effect 3 after 1 and 2, I was mostly satisfied with the ending given because it fit in with my story. I was able to look past the fact that your choices don't change the ending much because I only played through once and it was a solid enough ending for the story I was playing.  I feel like it will be the same thing here - and totally agree that these games are more about the journey than the ending and the weight of the choices you make as you traverse the story. Funnily enough, one of the hardest choices I had to make was in Episode 3 when you choose between siding with David or siding with Chloe because I really wanted to side with Chloe for Max's sake, but for the greater good I personally wanted to side with David due to each outcome. The outcome of this choice may not have a massive impact on the outcome of the story but because I was so connected to the characters, I cared about what happened there and then. That's the mark of a great story game IMHO."
lifeisstrange,3bzoph,Meckel,3,Sat Jul 4 00:10:22 2015 UTC,"Given the budget and size of the team working on this game, it is unlikely for this game to have big difference in world states at the end. The cost would be prohibitive.   Thankfully this is a game about friendship and relationships between people, and not about Max saving the world. Not that she wont save the world just that I feel saving the world is a given. The state of world at the end of the the game means little. The impact of the choice presented throughout the game would be shown on a personal level.   For example, if you were nice to Kate in all the decision, and not just weaseled your way out by saying just the right things in Ep2. Max and Kate becomes friends and travel to Africa and do non-profit work or something.  Or if you backed Chloe (and there seems to be a flag for this in the form of Chloe's phone background) Max and Chloe escape Arcadia Bay like Chloe planned.  And if you played as loner Max she goes off by herself and becomes a famous photographer.  All these things can happen in a single world state but still take in to account our choices as players. Far cheaper to film a few scene, perhaps with different audio tracks than animated all the change between different timelines.  TL;DR IMO, expect your choices to matter, but on a personal level in regards to Max relationship as opposed to some epic world changing stuff."

As of right now, 18 out of the 50 default subreddits have been made private. Eighteen. That's 36%. These are the subreddits that new users or visitors without accounts would normally see. These are the subreddits that makes the money for reddit.  I believe it was /r/AskReddit that alone has paid for more than 30 years of server time via gold, more than any other subreddit by far. And /r/IAmA is one of the most important subreddits for reddit and its investors, because the celebrity AMAs means publicity, loads of new users as well as more advertisers.

I have to rely on a 3rd party tool (/r/toolbox) to actually moderate properly since the built-in features are so awful.  One of the big general issues is also the lack of communication between the reddit admins and subreddit moderators. I personally haven't attempted to contact the admins regarding a mod issue, so I haven't experienced this lack of communication first-hand, but I have seen it happen to other moderators.

Her chance of surviving would have been higher if Nathan shot her in the lung or even in the face from that angle.  The stomach is one of the worst places to get shot, if not the worst depending on your view. Especially at point-blank range. Organs rupture and gastric fluids mix with blood, effectively poisoning the body. It can kill you in 15 minutes and is excruciating from what I've heard.  Seriously I'd rather lose a lung. Of course, I preferably wouldn't want to get shot at all."

Plus David would be very quick to react and you would think that with his military history he should know some form of first aid. So while it'd be still a push that she would survive but I think there is certainly a possibility.   Plus I was thinking if the game has multiple endings, one would likely be turning back time to ""sacrifice Chloe"" only to find out that she would survive and be in hospital recovering. To me that'd make a sad ending a happy one and it'd leave the door open for max and Chloe to return in season 2 if they choose to."

To hint men are dangerous, possibly mentally disturbed and women need guns to protect themselves from them is a massive sexist generalisation and also misandry. Replicating that with misogyny in the comments isn't fair either of course, just hypocritical, but the first comments that come up just seem to be saying that sexist jabs against men in the media are nothing to threat over -- again, this is sexist."

But you seem to think her opinion of ""i don't trust men with guns that are literally designed to kill people, especially since one of these men just shot me like 4 hours ago"" is some unreasonable stance to have.  But women who feel unsafe around men should preface all of their personal opinions with ""but not all men"" so random men on the internet don't get their feelings hurt by a passing joke in a video game."

There are a lot of important women's issues and inequalities today that feminists still fight for (like unequal play, abortion rights, victim shaming, yada yada yada), and it seems kinda unfair to just say feminists are mostly just man haters, because most of them are just trying to bring about gender equality and stuff, and ignoring all the issues women still face today is kind of a bad idea."

(Although apparently Victoria did this first but I can't really remember. I don't think it's too hard to imagine she pinned the blame on Max when it came back to bite her in the ass.)  Anyway, yes. He probably sees it as being quite an overly bias thing to do as the only evidence at the moment really is word of mouth, Kate saying it happened and Nathan saying it didn't. I suppose he thought Max taking Kate's - a girl's - side (and especially since it's related to sexual assault) was a stereotypical feminazi move. Hence the feminazi tag for her."

lifeisstrange,3bzymr,moeru_gumi,-8,Fri Jul 3 16:25:24 2015 UTC,I purposely let Kate jump because I couldn't stand her.

lifeisstrange,3bzymr,Bond4141,2,Sun Jul 5 01:03:17 2015 UTC,Suicide is no joke mate.
lifeisstrange,3bzymr,moeru_gumi,1 point,Sun Jul 5 01:23:25 2015 UTC,"Of course it's not. But Kate didn't add anything to the story. She wasn't a particular friend of Max and I was not given the choice, as the player, whether to be interested in her situation or not. Max is displayed as someone who is nosy and has a bit of a savior complex-- she also wants to be a peacekeeper in a way that's fittingly juvenile for a teenager. She thinks she can solve everybody's problems whether she should be involved in them or not.   As a player who totally disagreed with getting involved in Kate's life, there was no option for me to get going with the MAIN STORY, which was reconciliation with Chloe and finding out what happened to Rachel. That's what I wanted to focus on, and the entire debacle with Kate was a side distraction.   I didn't appreciate her clinginess and when Max was in the diner with Chloe and the phone rang, the option was clearly ""answer the phone and irritate Chloe even more, who already is having trouble trusting you"" or ""ignore the call and explain to Kate later"".  If Kate can't handle the fact that someone may be driving, in the shower, taking a crap, talking to someone on another line, etc. and is going to kill herself RIGHT NOW UNLESS YOU ANSWER, that's not Max's fault and that's not Max's job. A therapist needs to step in here. Max cannot be held responsible for other people's mental health.  Kate was not something I prioritized so although I tried to help her at first (I took the photo of her and David, thinking that physical PROOF would be more helpful than getting into a fight with a grown-ass man), when I'm with a friend I'm WITH  that friend and don't take calls from people who probably want to talk and vent and cry for an hour and need emotional care.  IRL I have been that person who had to talk someone down from the (proverbial) roof and get him out of the hotel room the night he tried to kill himself. I'm not confused about the seriousness of suicide."
lifeisstrange,3bzymr,Bond4141,2,Sun Jul 5 01:35:09 2015 UTC,"So because Kate doesn't add anything to your view, she can just go kill herself?   Lets not forget that she does add a lot to the story after Ep2. Fuck, damn near a third of the dialogue is changed based on her action. Not to mention the possibility that whatever happened to Rachel is now happening to Kate.   Also, lets consider the idea of Chekhov's gun, a dramatic principle that every element in a narrative be irreplaceable and that anything else be removed.  Kate wouldn't exist in this story if she didn't play a part. Maybe it's to establish that Nathan and Victory are evil asshats driving people to Suicide, maybe it's a Rachel clone. Whatever the case may be, Kate will have some part to play, even if it has already been played.   Hell, because of Kate we know that Nathan drugs, and possibly rapes girls at his parties. There was also a 'white room' IIRC, which could be a precursor to the 'dark room' we keep hearing about.   Cut Kate out of the story, and it no longer makes sense the way it has played out."
lifeisstrange,3bzymr,moeru_gumi,1 point,Sun Jul 5 01:56:42 2015 UTC,"That's true. She added a motivation to Max and an emotional aspect to the story. I think you may have misunderstood what I was trying to say up there.  Of course Kate adds things to the story-world. She is a major plot point. But she is not the MOST vital 'quest' that Max has to go through, and I felt that I was somewhat railroaded (via Max) to care about her, when I (as a player) didn't feel any liking for the character.  But she was a side story, like Dana and her boyfriend, or Victoria's bullying. The CORE of this story is Max's relationship, past and present and future, with Chloe.  Of course Kate adds things to the richness of the story, but I didn't care to prioritize her over Chloe.  Also the writers gave us the option to let (or accidentally let) her die. Are you really saying that it was wrong for me to play the game and make my own choices? That's kind of the point of the game."
lifeisstrange,3bzymr,Bond4141,2,Sun Jul 5 02:06:16 2015 UTC,"Yes, she's not the main story of the game, however life is strange, and leads pop up wherever they can. If you ever needed a first-handed witness, Kate would be a great asset.   I would also like to point out that based on your post, you let her die because you didn't like her. Not because you accidently hit the wrong thing, to see what happens, or even because you were doing a worst-case-scenario run. But because you posted an unliked, and rare opinion on reddit. Should it be this way? Probably not. But it is, and chances are you knew it.   Also, it wasn't really a choice to let Kate fall. But rather the outcome of bad events. In other games, you may have seen a ""Game failed/mission failed/you died"" screen. But, like Beyond Two Souls, LiS continues on. I only say this because there wasn't a ""OK then. jump"" option. Max tried to save Kate, and you failed Max there."
lifeisstrange,3bzymr,moeru_gumi,1 point,Sun Jul 5 02:19:07 2015 UTC,"No, I didn't like Kate as a character.  But I did not know anything about this game before I played it, or read anything about it, or had any idea there were such strong political opinions over characters in the game. I played it on my girlfriend's Steam account while knowing nothing about it at all.   In that chapter, I was irritated by how clingy and weak Kate was, her judgmental religious family, and that trying to take a photo of David made Kate angry that I ""didnt try to stand up for her"". When she got angry at Max for not picking a fight with a security guard, I decided I'd had enough of Kate and made choices to ignore her.  I did NOT know she was going to kill herself. By then it was too late and I had made too many choices 'against' her for her to even listen to Max. I didn't get the option of any helpful dialogue. She just flopped off the roof and that was the end of it.   The outcome of my ignoring her was that she decided to kill herself instead of doing anything else.  In my second play through I made choices to befriend her, just to see what happens as you put it.  But BECAUSE Kate dies, and you do NOT get a Game Over screen, this reinforces my comment that Kate is not the main plot of the game. If you fail a quick-time event, if you piss off Frank instead of getting his keys, everything goes gray and you are forced to rewind. You are not allowed to fail at these junctions because the game/story cannot progress if Max fucks these up.  If you 'fuck up' and don't bother to befriend Kate, the game goes on.  It doesn't end because it's not WRONG to let her die. It's just a choice.   Which, again, is the entire thesis of the game."

lifeisstrange,3bzymr,Ara-Player,3,Wed Jul 15 20:41:31 2015 UTC,"I want to not kiss Chloe now when I thought about it.  DON'T HATE ME HERE, my first reaction to that scene was Kiss Chloe and I chose to do that (for obvious reasons). Now when I think about it, I don't want to consider Max and Chloe to be ""more than friends"". To me the story is Max and Chloe, 2 female friends try to discover the secret with Rachel. I don't want them to go in lesbians in any direction (even though it's hinted at a lot), but it flew over my mind when I got that choice. I immediately kissed her."
lifeisstrange,3bzymr,TAGsvk,2,Fri Jul 3 16:16:52 2015 UTC,I wrote article about that. I really dont think that you can anyhow start romance with her by just that. But is really likely that if you backing her up (and got wallpaper) with combination with this she will make move on you since by kissing her she will get enough belief that she wont get negative response. But for sure you will have chance to say no and for sure she will be angry at you ((as she was when found out that her (in her eyes) future girlfriend was banging with Frank)) since she is having oblivious crush on Max as well.

lifeisstrange,3bxnpt,Rirere,6,Fri Jul 3 00:25:32 2015 UTC,"Honestly, the one thing I don't like with Life is Strange's system is that you can't rewind within a cutscene. Woulda been a real timesaver if I could pick a choice and then, should I realize right away that I wanted to pick the other choice, be able to rewind immediately rather than wait for the whole cutscene to finish.   They let you skip through things, though, so it's not at all a big issue."
lifeisstrange,3bxnpt,EcoleBuissonniere,1 point,Fri Jul 3 00:59:16 2015 UTC,"Life is Strange's time mechanic is a lot more complex. RM's rewind scenes, although rare, were very well made and it was entertaining seeing the different scenarios play out. But ultimately there was only one possible outcome that would advance the game. It would have been very interesting if there was some open-endedness to the storyline based on Nilin's actions in each of the 4 remix scenes."
lifeisstrange,3bxnpt,HelmutVillam,0,Fri Jul 3 13:14:51 2015 UTC,"I think the whole thing with Remember Me is that it WASN'T actually manipulating time, just manipulating a person's perception of time. ie, Remember Me didn't have Nillin changing the past, just changing people's recollection of the past. Still has great consequences, but they're limited to the single person affected. Life is Strange has a much more grand approach, as you're changing actual events, and they change everything that's associated with the incident in any way shape and form.  But I do believe they did a great job in this game, and I love Life is Strange considerably more than RM (which i recall being rather forgettable, but fun), I've openly declared LiS my favorite game of all time (which is anything but small). They are 2 completely different types of games though, and it's an apples to oranges comparison, even in regards to their core ""time"" mechanics."
lifeisstrange,3bxnpt,kemando,1 point,Fri Jul 3 10:05:00 2015 UTC,"Oh, I know. However, both games do essentially require repeatedly scrubbing back and forth through a span of time while attempting to shift an outcome by manipulating events.   Thematically they're similar, not identical, yes. I'm referring more however to the game play feel, which was somewhat irritating in Remember Me because of the precision required, and somewhat annoying in Life is Strange because the jump points available shift between over world and conversation."
lifeisstrange,3bxnpt,kemando,1 point,Fri Jul 3 12:38:53 2015 UTC,"It's really easy to tell when and when you cannot rewind in LiS though, and the game has some mechanics that a lot of people still don't fully understand (I see SO many people just ignore the speech bubble prompt meaning they can rewind for new dialogue options, or they can use the info on someone else, it's infuriating. lol)  Remember Me was very restricted, and the use of the mechanic was incredibly limited, in the background behind the combat. I didn't find it overly difficult or complicated, it was a bit too easy to miss a little thing and have to go back and forth, but it was fine, I think."

I dreamed that the EP4 trailer was out so loaded it; while the video was buffering, I checked the comments. Most of them were really sad, the most recurring one about Chloe losing her battle to depression. Lots of people were saying they cried through the comments, then before I could watch what the trailer was about, I woke up. I do recall the song being ""In My Mind"" by Amanda Palmer though -- at least, that was what was written there."
lifeisstrange,3bz4ax,SteveJEO,2,Fri Jul 3 11:19:33 2015 UTC,"The weird time displacement thing is actually kinda common. The whole trick is remembering the bloody things cos you'll probably have the same dream again.  You might actually like this...   I get what I suppose you could describe as sequential 'reset' type dreams all the time. (like the movie Edge of Tomorrow but a bit more horrible).  Recently i've got kinda stuck in a loop with weird ass vampire zombie things. I dunno what you'd actually call them... fuckers are really really fast (... bastards are actually faster than I am).  Anyway...  1st night: Wake up/come too and there's a bunch of us creeping up the end of a road. We were looking for supplies, food and meds and the little bungalow at the end of the cull de sac was a doctors place so he might have something.   It's dark and drizzling... (fuckers would be active at twilight or dawn and noctilucent like cats ~ it's weird how you know context for some parts and not others ~ I was starving but didn't know why cos I'm fairly obviously not starving)   We sit and wait listening... there was no obvious damage to the house so we'd hoped it was clean. (Ha!) Mike (person I dont know) and Rachel (person I do know) go 'fuck it, nothing here' and take a crow bar to the front door..quietish. We get in and start to rummage a bit and the dude had a personal fridge. (Holy shit! fucking score! bit damp but these are good...they're foil wrapped).  The house was clear yeah... back yard fucking wasn't. 3 of them come in through the rear windows like a grenade going off.  We had no chance at all... I lived long enough to hear the screaming.  2nd night. Reset. Exact same scenario. (me thinks... fuck!) so I went right for the back porch... and now I have a shotgun. Fuck you monster. boom. got 3 of them.  3rd night. Reset.  same scenario. Take precautions and there's nothing there... totally quiet. Everyone loots the place and I'm going WTF... this is all wrong, something is badly wrong... so we go back to our shelter with crappy christmas tree lighting and old car batteries. (a baseball stadium of some kind). and yeah, they waited and followed us. That was really fucking messy.  4th night reset. Yadda yadda. They came over the top and down the pews. Got 2. (not good enough)  5th night. Got back and the lights were cut. I don't really remember too much about that one. Something/one of the things came in through a changing room door and tore a friends face half off. I chucked a belt of grenades in, slammed it shut and dived then the world exploded. I woke up from that saying he was already dead, I didn't kill him. (over and over and over again)  Come to think of it... You probably shouldn't like that. Remembering dreams can really suck."

lifeisstrange,3bwt2b,yarfmeister,5,Thu Jul 2 21:57:47 2015 UTC,"I hate it when that happens.

lifeisstrange,3bwt2b,GenerouslyLachrymose,7,Fri Jul 3 18:16:10 2015 UTC,"Yup, it basically allows us to try every angle (and exploit those angles) deciding what you think should do.

The reason I don't think they would make a prequel around Rachel is simply because the hooks of this game are ""action and consequence"" related, if we play Rachel before Max gets her powers the season stll has to end on a pretty closed spot so season 1 even happens they way it does. For example: you date Frank, don' date Chloe, Rachel goes missing in the end, etc... That would take away a lot of choice in season 2... =)"
lifeisstrange,3bv8bp,vince94_1,2,Thu Jul 2 13:33:34 2015 UTC,"We may not know a lot about Rachael but i believe we have learned enough to say we have a pretty good idea of what happened in the past 5 years.   I agree. A prequel would just be a recap of what we already know and what we will probably learn.  Personally, it would be preferable if they move onto a new caste, IF they make another one. For two main reasons, first, i am unsure of how much more excitement you can add to this caste(let's not make this a Nancy Drew novel series). Second, I do not want this series to drag on, even if i love it. I want to have a satisfying ending and not for the series to abruptly stop much later in development.  I've seen to many series that quit part way through and others that have had 5 finales, i do not wish that for this series."
lifeisstrange,3bv8bp,dubgaming,4,Sat Jul 4 00:38:17 2015 UTC,"It doesn't feel like they're going to pull a ""To Be Continued"" or do a prequel. I think that Max, Chloe, and Rachel's story is going to end with a satisfying, happy ending with all the loose plot threads tied up. (Depending on the in-game decisions, of course...they did say that there'll be multiple endings.)  The rewind mechanic has so much storytelling potential, a brand-new cast and setting would be just as incredible."
lifeisstrange,3bv8bp,Ahesterd,4,Thu Jul 2 17:08:53 2015 UTC,That would be cool. But i would personally prefer playing max. She's so adorable.

lifeisstrange,3bv8bp,McSayerPL,3,Thu Jul 2 15:28:02 2015 UTC,"I doubt it. Mostly because that'd most likely mean there would be only one ending. It's a neat idea though, considering the speculation that Rachel may have also been a time traveler."
lifeisstrange,3bv8bp,chattypenguin,2,Thu Jul 2 22:34:49 2015 UTC,"Only IF Rachel has powers, then the sequel would be good. Because only good idea for prequel IMO would be before she meets Chloe. And Rachel would be around 14 if so. Too young to make an interesting story around."

The basic idea is that Max get's the power to change time and when she saves Chloe things start to go wrong with nature.   To fix everything from going horribly wrong Max will have to go back in time and let Chole die.  The basic idea comes from various movies and comics and stuff. ~ You can't screw with fate and Chloe would (and should) have died... so when Max saves her the universe tries to correct the mistake by getting more and more extreme.  There's another more logical theory though. (that I'm not going to tell you about)
lifeisstrange,3bwkc0,ThisBeing,3,Thu Jul 2 19:37:34 2015 UTC,"What ?! xD You're so mysterious ! :p Tell us about it, even if it's just a bit ! I may already know of it, but I'm curious about what you are refering to :) Is it the theory that, on the contrary, we can avoid the vortex by saving Chloe ?"
lifeisstrange,3bwkc0,SteveJEO,4,Thu Jul 2 22:31:16 2015 UTC,It's probably been mentioned before but potential theory Spoiler

lifeisstrange,3btj8n,FilmingMachine,37,Thu Jul 2 00:55:34 2015 UTC,"I fully agree with you. After the trailer for Episode 2, and then playing the episode, I decided I didn't want to watch any of the trailers before I had played the actual episode.  I played Episode 3 without watching the trailer for it, and I am really, really happy I did that. I watched the trailer afterwards and I did not like just how much it spoiled at all. I'll do the same for Episode 4 and 5, no doubt."
lifeisstrange,3btj8n,DuckOfDuckness,5,Thu Jul 2 01:20:16 2015 UTC,"I watched EP2, and I was pretty much spoiled, since they spoil the train.   Played EP3 without the trailer, and I have to say I was getting my hairs standing on end, and sadness."

lifeisstrange,3btj8n,Audemus77,5,Thu Jul 2 01:12:49 2015 UTC,I really wish I could watch the trailer and not have the important events of the timeline showed :) That is why I like the teaser.

lifeisstrange,3btj8n,yarfmeister,5,Thu Jul 2 22:42:18 2015 UTC,"Yeah I watched episode 3 trailer the day before and that got me thinking the whole ""Max=Rachel"" Theory again because of Frank's quote they used (that theory is still debatable for me). Either than that, Episode 3 trailer wasn't that ""spoilery"", but they did preview some important choices (ex. Throwing the dog bone). Ep3 ending was still a surprised so that's still good.   I think the Episode 2 trailer was way more spoilery. It previewed how Chloe would get off the tracks we saw in the ep.1 ending teaser(at least one way). It also implied way too much (at least to me) that Kate was going to commit suicide (ex. teasing the bathroom scene and the beginning of the suicide scene). I'm really grateful I played the first 2 episodes consecutively to not bother with the EP2 trailer."
lifeisstrange,3btj8n,yarfmeister,3,Thu Jul 2 01:57:33 2015 UTC,Agree with you friend.
lifeisstrange,3btj8n,Rauthian,5,Thu Jul 2 08:45:26 2015 UTC,I don't watch the trailers. I don't even look at the thumbnail! I won't even smell them! The risk of spoilers is too great.

lifeisstrange,3btj8n,xepherian,3,Thu Jul 2 09:47:40 2015 UTC,I don't understand why anyone would watch the trailer for an episodic series. The trailer from the end of episode 3 was enough for me.

I seriously hope Quantum Break kills it -  it looks really good already - because if it does it will certainly boost a AW2 development.

lifeisstrange,3bqrmb,nikola_mihaylov,10,Fri Jul 3 22:51:12 2015 UTC,"14th July is most likely, due to their eight-weeks-between-episodes plan."
lifeisstrange,3bqrmb,Duplo65,12,Wed Jul 1 12:22:30 2015 UTC,"The plan was 6 weeks,but then reality kicked in. Oh god,the waiting is so hard."
lifeisstrange,3bqrmb,Ghost_LeaderBG,18,Wed Jul 1 12:24:09 2015 UTC,Not nearly the worst though. Tales of the Borderlands episode 1 was released November 2014. Episode 3 was only out last week.   I have to hand it to Dontnod for all their quickness.
lifeisstrange,3bqrmb,Bond4141,15,Wed Jul 1 17:26:42 2015 UTC,"Well,if anything Telltale can blame themselves. They're working on Tales of The Borderlands,Game Of Thrones,Minecraft Story Mode,The Walking Dead Michone,Walking Dead Season 3 and god knows what else. Granted,those are probably different teams,but their episode releases would be so much faster if they had 1 or 2 big teams working on 1-2 projects,instead of a bunch of small teams working on multiple projects.   But that's not the point. I just hate waiting and since LiS is sooo good,it makes the wait between episodes almost insufferable."
lifeisstrange,3bqrmb,Ghost_LeaderBG,3,Wed Jul 1 17:34:25 2015 UTC,"IMHO the hardest thing about the games would be the voice acting. And by hardest, i mean the longest. Unless the voice actors are crossed over, then there's really no reason. A lot of the textures are pre-planned, and probably done far before hand. As such, smaller teams probably aren't all that big of a deal."
lifeisstrange,3bqrmb,Bond4141,2,Thu Jul 2 01:35:06 2015 UTC,"I don't think they're working on TWD:S3 yet, considering they said it won't be coming this year. Just because they've confirmed games, doesn't mean they're currently working on them all."

Tales from the Borderlands is a pretty exaggerated case, and I don't really know what's going on there, but right now LiS, GoT and TftB are just incredible, and definetely some of my favourite games, at least of this genre."
lifeisstrange,3bqrmb,MightyGreenPanda,2,Wed Jul 1 21:37:52 2015 UTC,"Yes, but in some recent interview I've read they were talking about 8 weeks, so 14th is my guess."
lifeisstrange,3bqrmb,Duplo65,6,Wed Jul 1 12:41:18 2015 UTC,"I think the plan was always 6 to 8 weeks,but during game development some unexpected stuff can happen(bugs,glitches etc),so they have to push the release date back."

lifeisstrange,3bqrmb,Bond4141,3,Thu Jul 2 01:36:44 2015 UTC,I would imagine playing a third person game in VR would be like watching the story unfold from the perspective of a ghost or something no one can see... just following Max around.

lifeisstrange,3btpnb,CrystalnikSpacebro,23,Thu Jul 2 01:52:52 2015 UTC,Yeah I think so. It's not some hardcore fighter game like Batman. It's a fairly easy going exploration/story based game that you don't really need any dexterity for.
lifeisstrange,3btpnb,jessebona,17,Thu Jul 2 01:54:35 2015 UTC,"Its definitely an accessible game, if my sister could play and she hasn't touched video games in like ages then I think a lot of people can.  For a person outside the gaming world this will be like a really good movie where you as the player chooses outcomes for different things."
lifeisstrange,3btpnb,haXona,10,Thu Jul 2 02:12:31 2015 UTC,"I definitely think so. It's all about story in this game and making choices. There's nothing complicated about the controls or gameplay. You walk around, point, click, explore, and talk. It's all about the story here. So if you're a non-gamer who enjoys a good story, I definitely recommend giving this game a shot."
lifeisstrange,3btpnb,kurosu_49,8,Thu Jul 2 02:13:42 2015 UTC,"I had my father play a bit of the game and it went fine. He had some trouble with the controls (using the mouse to move the camera and how to use WASD) in the beginning, and he didn't really care much about looking at all the details (like the journal or looking at every single picture in the classroom like I've done multiple times). He finished Episode 1 in 2 sessions, and does kind of remember the story still, so success I guess.  I'd say yes, go for it, gamer or non-gamer. It's one of the better games if you want to introduce someone to the world of gaming.  Ps. I'm so happy there's no QTEs in LIS, that would've probably killed it for him."
lifeisstrange,3btpnb,DuckOfDuckness,6,Thu Jul 2 02:23:17 2015 UTC,"I'm trying to get my non-gamer sister to play it, but she is having trouble with motion sickness with the third person view. She also rants to me how the game sounds like a white girl drama and that she'd prefer her K-Dramas, but that's another story."
lifeisstrange,3btpnb,Gopasson,3,Thu Jul 2 02:54:10 2015 UTC,"Some people like LiS some don't, I don't think 'white girl drama' is accurate though considering according to a comment by a Dontnod staff with the results of the survey they did for the shirt a day or two ago about 75% of the people here are male.  I think it takes a short curve until it shows you what it's about though while your sister could get that impression and then you have to wait until the middle of episode one to really get into it IMO."
lifeisstrange,3btpnb,Thulez,3,Thu Jul 2 03:20:12 2015 UTC,"Yeah she's on episode 3 right now and I'm trying to convince her to finish, but she still gets those headaches. Plus I just don't think it's her game really."
lifeisstrange,3btpnb,Gopasson,4,Thu Jul 2 03:58:55 2015 UTC,"Some people have motion sickness with most games.  I would still be surprised if she plays games and doesn't like LiS though, for me it's simply amazing.  I really enjoyed telltale games and the subject matter/movement style etc of LiS is like a big step up for me, waiting till it concludes to say best single player game I've played but I could probably safely say that now."
lifeisstrange,3btpnb,Thulez,0,Thu Jul 2 04:59:30 2015 UTC,But the drama primarily revolves around white girls
lifeisstrange,3btpnb,StabbedAnus,1 point,Fri Jul 3 01:31:58 2015 UTC,My mom has the same problem with motion sickness.  I remember even a long time ago she couldn't even look at something like Doom without getting dizzy.  Maybe she would like watching a good lets play of it?
lifeisstrange,3btpnb,GenerouslyLachrymose,5,Thu Jul 2 20:59:16 2015 UTC,"Depends on how much of a non-gamer they are. If they've grown up playing games but just aren't a ""gamer"", then they'd probably enjoy it. It's fun and doesn't require twitch-reflexes or grinding.  But an older person who has never played games at all would have trouble. Navigating with two sticks or keyboard+mouse would be a big problem. So would understanding video game conventions about fetch quests, talking to everyone, sneaking, snooping in everyone's room, and how important events will wait indefinitely for you."
lifeisstrange,3btpnb,lislislislislis,5,Thu Jul 2 03:31:33 2015 UTC,"The story is something that everyone can enjoy, and while it's a simple game it still does use a lot of video game concepts and mechanics that 0% gamers would have difficulty grasping at first, like how events that would be time sensitive irl don't happen in games until triggered, exploring environments, that the time spent completing an objective rarely matters. I remember reading a post here by someone who got his mom to play the game. She wanted to run to the parking lot immediately to give Warren his flash drive so as not to keep him waiting, and also initially avoided talking to characters because she didn't want to bother them.  Don't underestimate the simplicity of common game controls, I introducing a non-gamer to a game once, and she tried using the arrow keys to move. Had an incredibly hard time navigating with the keyboard and mouse, basic motion, picking up items. Had to lift up her hand to see where the control and shift keys are every time she wanted to crouch or sprint."
lifeisstrange,3btpnb,moonsidian,8,Thu Jul 2 03:46:38 2015 UTC,"I think people under estimate how complicated games are if you've been playing them for five plus years, which is why I really don't like people who think telling people how to move the camera at the beggining of the game is hand holding, the only reason people who play a lot find that annoying is because of how obvious it is.  Case in point, GF loved the game, loved playing it, loved exploring and talking to people but shit like exploring small areas (like the building inside the junkside) is basically impossible for her. Three fourths of it is her jamming the camera into the corner of the floor. And that's just ""basic"" camera controls, the real ""gamey"" shit is even worse. Like find those five bottles, or build a bomb instead of breaking the door down with a fire ax or something. It's just really interesting watching somebody who's basically never played ""real games"" (fuck that term tho) it's pretty interesting seeing how odd video games are, even ones that are not meant to be stupid hardcore games.  That being said, if you want somebody to experience the story let them make choices while you handle controller duty, make sure to point them in the right direction (oh maybe you wanna check Dana's room before we meet Warren? etc) and maybe let them try playing during easier bits. My GF will handle the controller during stuff like the courtyard scenes, or the hallways, but hands it over to me for the lighthouse visions or the pool escape because she can't handle the camera fast enough for those sequences."
lifeisstrange,3btpnb,SkateboardCop,4,Thu Jul 2 06:43:50 2015 UTC,Heck yes. I introduced my 'video games kill brain cells' type of friend to it and she played for over three hours in one sitting.
lifeisstrange,3btpnb,emoninja95,3,Thu Jul 2 13:52:31 2015 UTC,I'll keep it short: YES.
lifeisstrange,3btpnb,SkyWest1218,3,Thu Jul 2 02:59:11 2015 UTC,Yes. My friends like it because of the story and simple controls.
lifeisstrange,3btpnb,alexhasacamera,3,Thu Jul 2 03:02:30 2015 UTC,"I showed it to a friend of mine and she really liked it :D So, I'm guessing it's a yes"
lifeisstrange,3btpnb,Herox01,3,Thu Jul 2 03:55:20 2015 UTC,"I introduced Life is Strange to two aunties who hadn't touched video games since the 80s. One enjoys it a lot, whereas the second wanted to stop playing before you give Warren the flash drive in Ep1, complaining it was ""too slow"" (which surprised me to no end considering she hates action movies for the opposite reason). It does all depend on who the person is, but if they like movies or tv shows of the same style they should like it!"
lifeisstrange,3btpnb,BrickFudgingMaster,3,Thu Jul 2 08:09:43 2015 UTC,"In the scope of video games, I think it has the best possible shot at being enjoyed by non-gamers. It focus on story, decisions are reversible, it looks beautiful, and the barrier of entry on gaming skill is very accessible. It effectively only requires you to move the camera and the character around the environment. There are always reminders about what buttons to press and objects you can interact with are highlighted.  Will a non-gamer definitely enjoy it? Maybe, maybe not. But I think it stands a much stronger chance than most other entries out there."
lifeisstrange,3btpnb,herrnewbenmeister,2,Thu Jul 2 11:31:51 2015 UTC,"Yes. It's not any skill needed first person shooter, it's just experience a life of a teenager with lots and lots of time travel and choice-consequence (which I think the idea of will be very appealing to a non-gamer)."
lifeisstrange,3btpnb,Ara-Player,2,Thu Jul 2 10:48:39 2015 UTC,"I gifted Episode 1 to a friend thanks to the Steam sale. Friend's not particularly into gaming with the exception of Portal but is a fan of many elements found in LiS (Photography, the pop culture references, indie music etc). She liked the trailer for episode 1 so if ever she wants to continue, she can buy the rest via season pass."
lifeisstrange,3btpnb,whitesummerside,2,Thu Jul 2 13:43:59 2015 UTC,I think this kind of game is the ideal game for someone who isn't a gamer. Because it isn't the same format as most games and to me is more like an interactive tv drama. I've got my mum to play and enjoy this game and she is as far from a gamer as you can get.
lifeisstrange,3btpnb,Jamesiejr,2,Fri Jul 3 14:14:57 2015 UTC,"I feel like it would. LiS is an /r/interactivecinema game, as such, it's more or less watching a TV show but you get some control over it. So, yeah. Probably any game of the genre posted above would work for a non-gamer, or casual gamers."
lifeisstrange,3btpnb,Bond4141,1 point,Sat Jul 4 20:13:13 2015 UTC,"Most likely the answer will be yes. The game play is easy to understand and the story is easy to get lost in. Every decision you make has consequences (that happen immediately and down the road) based on your choices, but you do have the option to reverse your choices as you make them. No choice is necessarily a good or correct choice, which makes each play through unique for each person."

lifeisstrange,3bslji,Schlachten,15,Wed Jul 1 20:28:38 2015 UTC,"No. No in main timeline for sure. I am really interested where devs are going with all this Rachel stuff. Now after EP3 they made last person (Chloe) that really wants to find her made change her mind to point where I think if Chloe will give up it (she called her bitch). So far she seemed that she is just exposition that Chloe is having ""problem"" with sticking to one person way too hard, to point where she becaming almost selfish (I dont see this as negative but) and that there is some shit going on Blackwell. Sheself doesnt appear to me very important to the story since she is not only one. Kate was meant to be newest ""red folder"" but its not there before she made/tried suicide, suggesting that Rachel was ""completed"" already and that means dead or keeping alive with all those other girls (pls no). We will maybe get chance to talk to her in alternative timeline but I dont know what to expect. I dont think also that Max=Rachel but there is real chance that we will cosplay her to get some exposition (way too many foreshadowing ""u look like Rachel"")."
lifeisstrange,3bslji,TAGsvk,5,Wed Jul 1 20:50:37 2015 UTC,"Interesting thought. I understand that Chloe did as a matter of fact got her rage on, but I hope she doesn't completely give it up. She does say Rachel ""Saved me"", or Rachel is her ""Angel"". I just hope there's more to their relationship and they'll still be motivated enough to find Rachel as much as they want to end this all.  Like you, I don't really believe in the Max=Rachel thing as well. But I hope we find out more about Rachel since all we know is that Rachel is someone who came into our picture as this person who is perfect in the day, and dark in the night. A sweet person who doesn't cause trouble, but lives a double life where she does cause trouble and ""betrays"" her friends. Or at least that's what I feel."

lifeisstrange,3bslji,lislislislislis,6,Fri Jul 10 15:35:31 2015 UTC,"Rachel Amber is a lot like Laura Palmer from Twin Peaks.  In Twin Peaks we never met Laura, but the actress who played Laura also played her cousin who had a significant part on the show, and was often mistaken for Laura.  I doubt we'll see Rachel's genetically identical cousin, but maybe  she'll show up in some capacity other than just photographs."
lifeisstrange,3bslji,EcoleBuissonniere,2,Thu Jul 2 03:35:01 2015 UTC,"And then we'll get a really weird, incomprehensible, somehow still awesome prequel focused on Rachel Amber's final days, once again directed by Raoul Barbet and Michel Koch?"
lifeisstrange,3bslji,lislislislislis,2,Thu Jul 2 21:21:52 2015 UTC,I could honestly see it as a one-off DLC. (It's there as a menu item with seemingly no purpose right now...)
lifeisstrange,3bslji,EcoleBuissonniere,3,Fri Jul 3 00:53:04 2015 UTC,"That was a little jab at Fire Walk With Me, haha. It was directed by David Lynch, it was all about Laura Palmer's final days, and it was really weird, incomprehensible, and somehow still awesome.  I would totally love a one-off DLC focusing not on Chloe or Max, but still tying into the events of season one. I'm pretty sure the DLC button on the menu is for people without the season pass to buy new episodes as they come out, though."
lifeisstrange,3bslji,Yelya,3,Fri Jul 3 00:56:18 2015 UTC,"Maybe with the new timeline, nothing happened to Rachel. We may see her in the ""new"" reality as her past and her present would be altered"
lifeisstrange,3bslji,Zentopian,4,Thu Jul 2 03:58:55 2015 UTC,"What if we don't ever meet Rachel, but Max travels to a point(s) in time that Rachel was around...maybe not interacting with her directly, as Max wasn't around when she was, but sort of witnessing first-hand some scenarios that Rachel was in, and piecing together or getting direct evidence through Rachel's own mouth as to where she went and why or how, and then being able to relay that info to Chloe for closure."
lifeisstrange,3bslji,FilmingMachine,5,Thu Jul 2 06:55:16 2015 UTC,"I believe we will just see Rachel in the school hallways (in the alternate timeline) just like: ""Sup' Max?""  And we will have no idea how to understand why she run away from the info we will get from the alternate Rachel (that never got to meet Frank because she didn't hang out with Chloe)"
lifeisstrange,3bslji,BobMugabe35,1 point,Thu Jul 2 00:42:33 2015 UTC,"I actually kind of hope not. Or if we do it'll end up being more something you as Max watch as an outsider to the Chloe/Rachel thing. I like to think for the game allowing you to control and manipulate so much of what you interact with, Rachel could be one thing you really can't have much input in. Especially if they go the 'Rachel was magic too!' route people keep theorizing."

lifeisstrange,3brqlj,mogitha,6,Thu Jul 2 23:56:20 2015 UTC,Maybe. 25yo white girl with a birthday in july that can dance about as well as Max?   But moving to oregon from california was a rash (but very great) decision.

lifeisstrange,3bt7ye,Schlachten,9,Wed Jul 1 23:17:38 2015 UTC,"It's just pure speculation. Based on the history of the wikia, it lists this:  It appears on the red binders in-game on episode 2 there is a 'Lynn' and a 'Kelly' and Kate joins them. Showing that Kate's sister is most likely Kelly.  So there is no confirmation, only speculation. It was mentioned once or twice that one of Kate's sisters is named Lynn and there was a Lynn on a binder, but as of now we have no real, solid proof."
lifeisstrange,3bt7ye,RasereiHojo,3,Thu Jul 2 01:03:30 2015 UTC,Why would a game that pays so much attention to detail reuse a name like that? It must mean something.
lifeisstrange,3bt7ye,chattypenguin,3,Thu Jul 2 23:49:00 2015 UTC,"For all we know, it could mean something, but there's no proof that it does. For starters, Lynn and Kelly are both younger than Kate. Why would Kate be the last subject? If we assume the culprit/keeper of the binders is associated with Blackwell, why would Kate's sisters be part of the binders when they don't even attend the school? It seems odd that her youngest sister would be targeted first, then the middle sibling, then Kate herself. Not only that, but Rachel is between Kate and the other two.  For a game that pays so much attention to detail, you would think Dontnod would include some sort of hint that something was up with her sisters, but all we know is Kate and her involvement with the video and presumably Nathan. We knew something was up with Kate from the beginning of episode 1; there were clues starting in episode 1 and it all came to a head in episode 2.  Where are the hints that Kate's sisters are involved? Where are the hints like episode 1's paper ball? The focus has been on Kate, not on the rest of her family."
lifeisstrange,3bt7ye,RasereiHojo,2,Fri Jul 3 00:30:54 2015 UTC,"There is tons of foreshadowing in this game. I'm too lazy to name them all, but here's something https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsfrTcCumw8. You just don't realize it until it gets to that point.  I'm not saying its definitely going to happen. I'm saying those names were there for you to read like everything else visible in the game. There's a reason they showed the name Lynn and also mentioned another person named Lynn in the same town.   No, I am not saying she will be in the game. I'm saying new information might appear in the upcoming episodes that will lead us to inferring something that could be important. This game is like an iceberg. There is so much to pay attention to below the surface. And its why I like it. Its not ridiculous at all to make the connection."
lifeisstrange,3bt7ye,chattypenguin,2,Fri Jul 3 00:47:39 2015 UTC,"But there's a difference between connecting the lines and over-analyzing every little detail. Saying that the Lynn and Kelly on those binders are Kate's sisters (when only Lynn is confirmed in the first place) is like saying every owner of a red binder is suspect to be the culprit. Why is the same red binder being reused all over the place? Is the entire school behind Kate being drugged, including Kate herself?  Again, I think it's possible, just not likely. One of the important rules of theorizing is that making assumptions may get you a theory, but it may not be accurate. You have to take what you know to be true to reach a valid conclusion."
lifeisstrange,3bt7ye,RasereiHojo,3,Fri Jul 3 00:57:54 2015 UTC,"What theory was I making? All I am saying is that I think its more than a coincidence that her name was on that binder, and it might mean something later on."
lifeisstrange,3bt7ye,chattypenguin,2,Fri Jul 3 01:05:21 2015 UTC,It looks for all the world as though you two agree with each other. What are you fighting about exactly? :P

lifeisstrange,3bt7ye,Kei314,2,Fri Jul 3 02:38:22 2015 UTC,"Well, they're all blonde.  Isn't Rachel a blonde, too?"
lifeisstrange,3bt7ye,chattypenguin,2,Thu Jul 2 03:44:58 2015 UTC,They both have hazel eyes as well.
lifeisstrange,3bt7ye,EpsilonSigma,2,Thu Jul 2 23:49:28 2015 UTC,"Lynn seems to have blue eyes, or blue green. If the Lynn on the folder is Kate's sister, then a possible implication is that the connection between the folder ""girls"" is not their appearance.   There's something I've noticed when playing the game now that I think about it. The camera sometimes lingers on a spot as if to highlight something. Off the top of my head I can remember 3 occasions. ""EP3 SPOILERS""  Thought I'd mention it since that last one could represent a connection."
lifeisstrange,3btcre,raspymorten,11,Wed Jul 1 23:58:04 2015 UTC,Don't forget that she only stops time once (and finds herself in a position where she can't do any time traveling). Now we will possibly see in this new episode that... she can go back to the previous timelines ;)
lifeisstrange,3btcre,FilmingMachine,3,Thu Jul 2 00:30:52 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure we'll have to make a very difficult decision while our powers are off during EP5. This could be a way to get really different endings.
lifeisstrange,3btcre,TheBusinessCat,2,Thu Jul 2 11:14:31 2015 UTC,"Probably not in the ending (story telling mechanics) and they have already used that ""trick"" before even though I would like to see that again :)"

lifeisstrange,3btcre,FilmingMachine,2,Thu Jul 2 08:53:25 2015 UTC,I mean the game forced you to use the rewind like 5 times at least AND then stop time. In EP 3 it was 2 times.
lifeisstrange,3btcre,NotMeeh,3,Thu Jul 2 08:58:44 2015 UTC,We dont know what the limit is :(
lifeisstrange,3btcre,FilmingMachine,3,Thu Jul 2 08:59:46 2015 UTC,This is pretty standard in storytelling though (for good reason).
lifeisstrange,3btcre,valryuu,2,Fri Jul 3 00:38:53 2015 UTC,"In episode 4, I'd say she'll develop the ability to go back in time into other people's minds."
lifeisstrange,3btcre,DevTad,2,Fri Jul 3 01:31:25 2015 UTC,I'm hoping she will be able to bounce between alternate universes.

lifeisstrange,3bqmwb,imjeans,6,Wed Jul 1 10:57:07 2015 UTC,"I recreated all the scenes myself using the in-game models/textures, all in Blender (using UModel for extraction).  Plus there are a few other models/textures from various sources here and there.  I'm not sure I feel comfortable sharing my Blender files because I'd essentially be sharing game assets to the wider internet.  However, all the software I used is free, so there is no reason you couldn't recreate some of these yourself. :)"
lifeisstrange,3bqmwb,imjeans,3,Wed Jul 1 11:05:32 2015 UTC,"btw you're awesome! so you make the photo memorial wall and the toilet by yourself? or could i get the model from somewhere else? (have no idea how to extract that) it's seems that there are only character models out there on Deviantart, so i m asking.  sorry to be a noob asking so many questions but here is some fanart i started making because of this game:  https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeisstrange/comments/3blv1x/love_wins/"

lifeisstrange,3bql8h,TheNathanNS,8,Wed Jul 1 11:04:25 2015 UTC,"What if Max holds onto Chloe, travels back to the toilets, let Past-Chloe die to ""save"" Blackwell and travel back to the present, still holding onto Chloe and bam, they get in Chloe's truck and leave town, leaving the Past-Chloe's dead body to change the face of Blackwell forever. It could even be a way for Chloe to leave her ""old self"" behind and embrace a new life elsewhere that doesn't remind her of shitty life in Arcadia Bay.  Would that even work? I'm hella curious now."
lifeisstrange,3bql8h,Adapt_Evolve_Become,6,Wed Jul 1 11:18:42 2015 UTC,"I don't think that'd work cause if the past-Chloe dies, the other Chloe would disappear from the future. So technically, the Chloe that Max brought back in time would fade away right there. I have a feeling that they'll use the butterfly picture that Max took to go back to the bathroom and fix something, though. Hopefully it won't be Max allowing Nathan to shoot Chloe."
lifeisstrange,3bql8h,justmetami,4,Wed Jul 1 15:10:10 2015 UTC,"Ah, bugger. I thought it might turn out like that :( It would be like in how the movie Looper ended with SPOILER!! the character killing himself to erase his future self from existence.  SPOILER END!!  I wonder what would happen if Max didn't take the photo of the butterfly but kept standing in front of the mirrors when Nathan walks in. Would he just simply walk out and take his rambling and his gun with him? Crisis averted unless Chloe stalks him elsewhere?"
lifeisstrange,3bql8h,Adapt_Evolve_Become,2,Wed Jul 1 17:01:36 2015 UTC,"Well, Chloe would find him somewhere else and I'm guessing a similar scenario would happen. Saving her would be harder though cause Max won't have a fire alarm to help, or maybe she won't even be there and Chloe would die. She's destined to die. :c"
lifeisstrange,3bql8h,justmetami,2,Wed Jul 1 20:16:46 2015 UTC,"It's not really required for spoilers from other things than LIS, but if you want you can still use our spoiler tag to hide them: [Looper SPOILER](#s ""Insert Looper spoiler here"")  It would look like this: Looper SPOILER"
lifeisstrange,3bql8h,DuckOfDuckness,1 point,Wed Jul 1 21:46:44 2015 UTC,"It could work, depending on whether you subscribe to the closed-loop hypothesis of temporal mechanics: closed-loop meaning that everything that happens in the past affects the future, and will by extension affect things or people from the future who have travelled to the past. In this case, Chloe dying in the past would actually cause the future Chloe brought back in time to die as well, because she cannot exist independently of her past counterpart.   Conversely, the multiverse hypothesis of temporal mechanics suggests that you can alter the past completely independent of the future, because doing so would actually merely create an alternate timeline/universe (actually, create isn't the right term since you wouldn't actually make a new universe, you'd merely be determining which universe you exist in, instantaneously shifting between them depending on what events unfold. In actuality, both universes exist prior to and after an event, and converge only at that single point in time), so in this case it would be possible for past-Chloe to die and present-Chloe to be unaffected.  Of course, it's all speculation as temporal mechanics is purely hypothetical at this point."
lifeisstrange,3bql8h,SkyWest1218,1 point,Thu Jul 2 01:01:10 2015 UTC,"But we did see how it's not possible to have two versions of the character at the same place, like when Max went back in time to save William or when she went to the alternate universe. If she was able to go to the scene where she was taking a picture of the butterfly, she'd be in her body, and IF she actually managed to take Chloe with her, then Chloe should be in her body as well. No two Chloes. We also saw that if you change the past, the future would get affected. I'm not even sure if holding Chloe's hand would be enough for her to travel back in time with Max, but if it was, the chances of the whole thing to not be a closed-loop are so low since it wouldn't make much sense. It sounds too good to be true tbh"
lifeisstrange,3bql8h,justmetami,3,Thu Jul 2 04:05:10 2015 UTC,"It sounds hella cool, sista!"

""Let's Kill Hitler"" paradox: if you go back in time and successfully kill Hitler, once you return to the present you would never have a reason to go back in time and kill Hitler, non of the things that made you go back in time to kill Hitler would've happened, so you would've never done it."

Sarah, the first main character reminds me of Chloe a bit. There are many characters that are hard not to fall in love with. Not spoiling too much, its about a punk orphan girl, Sarah, witnessing another girl that looks just like her(like exactly like her) commit suicide. Sarah wants to know who this person is, maybe a lost relative? Also this is a good chance to steal her identity and claim the riches but its gonna be a lot hard than she thought. Now commence the crazy, hilarious, madness with a good dose of feels. Welcome to the trip man."
lifeisstrange,3brrb3,Jessie246,5,Wed Jul 1 17:52:43 2015 UTC,Orphan black just wrapped what is for me top 3 show of the season for me - it seriously is just awesome! And the main actress Tatiana is a wonderful actress
lifeisstrange,3brrb3,haXona,3,Wed Jul 1 21:56:19 2015 UTC,I came here to suggest OB as well - it's fantastic.
lifeisstrange,3brrb3,ThaBenMan,3,Wed Jul 1 22:30:20 2015 UTC,Have you finished season 3? I'm still crying over the end of it. But it is definitely one of the best shows I've watched.
lifeisstrange,3brrb3,eatashrimp,3,Thu Jul 2 04:20:14 2015 UTC,Yes I did. I watched every episode as it aired. I love it sooo much! Cant wait till next season. Its hard to pick a favorite character but who do you relate to most? Cosima is my (more outgoing)spirit animal.
lifeisstrange,3brrb3,Jessie246,3,Thu Jul 2 04:28:40 2015 UTC,Cosima all the way! ...and I would definitely enjoy making crazy science with her ;D
lifeisstrange,3brrb3,eatashrimp,3,Thu Jul 2 05:05:27 2015 UTC,"Thanks! I'll definitely check it out, BBC is one of my favorites tv channels (I forget to mention that I'm a Whovian, too)."
lifeisstrange,3brrb3,Dagegen,3,Wed Jul 1 18:06:37 2015 UTC,"Fringe - a few years old, but it reminds me of LiS.    The show is about Olivia, a female FBI agent, who has to team up with an institutionalized scientist in order solve a series of strange events.  The show starts a bit slow, but the characters are really cool (especially John Noble playing Walter is awesome).  Trailer that kinda highlights the similarities between the show and LiS. It's a bit spoilery though. Think of it as watching the E3 trailer before playing episode 1.    Trailer"
lifeisstrange,3brrb3,978am,2,Wed Jul 1 19:42:56 2015 UTC,"Fringe, so much. I can't recommend this enough. For anyone who enjoys the themes in LiS; the what ifs, the time travel, the alternate universes, and also deep and rich characters.... Fringe is a perfect match. Also, it has quirky humor. And strong female characters."
lifeisstrange,3brrb3,derpdepp,2,Wed Jul 1 21:51:37 2015 UTC,"Currently watching Mr. Robot & True Detective.   Waiting for Leftovers S2. Planning to check out Sense8.  ofc: Breaking Bad, Walking Dead, Game of Thrones. And Twin Peaks.  edit: And i liked Homeland, House of Cards, and Dexter in the beginning... but those shows went downhill over time, especially Dexter."
lifeisstrange,3brrb3,stevenlyontbot,2,Wed Jul 1 18:29:49 2015 UTC,"Isn't LiS based a lot off of Twin Peaks? I've never seen the show, but I think I remember reading that somewhere. But my personal favourites are the usual GoT, Breaking Bad, TWD, Fargo, House of Cards and OITNB."
lifeisstrange,3brrb3,EcoleBuissonniere,1 point,Thu Jul 2 15:58:24 2015 UTC,"Yeah. Super popular girl disappears/dies, somebody investigates their disappearance/death (along the way finding out that said popular girl wasn't quite as perfect as she appeared), investigator runs into supernatural goings-on that somehow both are and are not the main focus of the show/game, all in a small town setting with the primary focus being not only on the mystery but also on a large cast of memorable characters... Life is Strange is basically a modern Twin Peaks with time travel and (more) high school."
lifeisstrange,3brrb3,yarfmeister,1 point,Thu Jul 2 21:13:22 2015 UTC,"I don't watch many shows. I'm stuck with The Walking Dead because that show will never fucking end, and emotional investment is a bitch.   But you can never go wrong with reruns of Seinfeld. (now on Hulu)"
lifeisstrange,3brrb3,DominoNo-,1 point,Wed Jul 1 20:13:03 2015 UTC,Veronica Mars and iZombie remind me a bit of LiS.
lifeisstrange,3brtmb,Gopasson,16,Wed Jul 1 17:10:02 2015 UTC,"Sorry but I see 0% chance there.    Its not that important to story after EP2, even if you saved her they just put her into hospital so she will be seen minimal in future. I dont really think that Max is lesbian. And I telling this as hardcore Max and Chloe shipper. She is really not like ""Hey, cute girl I want date you because I find you atractive"". Shes 18, dont have clean with this stuff in head, she may see that her friendship with Chloe is going to state where line between friendship and romantic releationship is ultra thin, and she is aware of that. But is that type of love ""fall in love with BFF"", not ""lets date"" with in mind that you expect romance since day one."
lifeisstrange,3brtmb,TAGsvk,11,Wed Jul 1 18:31:28 2015 UTC,Honestly its too hard to see it. We dont even really know much about Kate and we havent spent much time with her. I see them more as friends or Max as a 'big sister' to kate.
lifeisstrange,3brtmb,Jessie246,4,Wed Jul 1 17:39:50 2015 UTC,"I doubt it. But who am I to deny your dreams? Marshfield can coexist with Pricefield. Multiple realities, amirite?"
lifeisstrange,3brtmb,yarfmeister,3,Wed Jul 1 20:04:49 2015 UTC,"I see little to no possibility of anything happening there. Despite my strong belief that both Max and Chloe are bi, I just don't see Kate as a romantic option. Not only do we know the minimum about her, but she and Max haven't spent nearly enough time together to get there, and she seems like more of a sisterly figure than a romance, to me."
lifeisstrange,3brtmb,satanslittleghost,3,Wed Jul 1 20:35:50 2015 UTC,"It's just fan fluff, it doesn't hold up much in the story and I doubt anything will come of it. So is Pricefield to be honest."
lifeisstrange,3brtmb,HelmutVillam,3,Thu Jul 2 00:37:36 2015 UTC,they're just friends. I'd prefer to see Max with Warren. Chloe is pretty bad with Max sometimes.
lifeisstrange,3brtmb,lawraWeltreich,3,Thu Jul 2 07:58:09 2015 UTC,Shes pancake in my playthrough. A realtionship with lisa would be the only possibility.  Im sorry kate
lifeisstrange,3brtmb,macstanislaus,2,Thu Jul 2 12:55:53 2015 UTC,"I could believe that one Max out of the many, many possible alternative realities might go for that, but the Max we play as in LiS? 0% chance.  Pricefield at least has a very slim chance of happening...and even that might be a stretch (though I really hope for it)."
lifeisstrange,3brtmb,GSoda,2,Wed Jul 1 22:34:14 2015 UTC,slim ? There is interview where they basically proven that this will happen. Not mention that there is way too much evidence that we will get this if we will want by decisions. http://redd.it/3bi7wd
lifeisstrange,3brtmb,TAGsvk,2,Wed Jul 1 22:46:05 2015 UTC,"If you are revering to the interview that I am thinking you are, than all they said was that the player has some agency in that regard...but they were far from actually confirming anything.  I'm simply afraid we will just end up with heavy subtext stuff with no real confirmation. I hate ""maybe-maybe not"" romances/endings :-/."
lifeisstrange,3brtmb,GSoda,2,Thu Jul 2 19:39:13 2015 UTC,I might if we see more of her character. Max is obviously important to Kate. We'll see.
lifeisstrange,3brtmb,chattypenguin,1 point,Wed Jul 1 22:38:53 2015 UTC,Don't think max is into necrophilia
lifeisstrange,3brtmb,Jamie_2905,1 point,Thu Jul 2 15:17:12 2015 UTC,"I had to do a double take, because I grew up near a city called Marshfield...    Anyway, I think it could be possible, but not likely.  Kate could be great friends with Max, but I think her religion may be too much of a barrier given how much her family didn't like that she had the video of her taken."
lifeisstrange,3bst9o,TomWish,4,Wed Jul 1 21:25:28 2015 UTC,"This has been theorized before, yeah. I also doubt that Max will use a photo to go back to the original timeline--it is not only unlikely, but pretty much impossible, considering most of the photos from the original timeline don't even exist anymore (in her current alternate timeline).  If we do see a new power, I'm anxious to see what it'll be and how it'll work."
lifeisstrange,3bst9o,satanslittleghost,6,Wed Jul 1 21:33:18 2015 UTC,Although the picture of Max and Chloe still does. Probably.
lifeisstrange,3bst9o,qlmaX5,3,Wed Jul 1 22:03:18 2015 UTC,"Notice I said ""most"".  But yeah, the picture of Max and Chloe from before William died--or in this case, before Max saved him--is still supposed to exist. It seems to be the one constant thing throughout all the timelines."
lifeisstrange,3bst9o,satanslittleghost,4,Wed Jul 1 22:13:00 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's basically the hinge on which the two (known) timelines are centered. My point is more one of 'we'd probably use that photo again instead of jumping through a photo from the first timeline', assuming there isn't some new way to jump between the two. If there are two."

lifeisstrange,3bqql0,Gr4b,10,Wed Jul 1 11:33:54 2015 UTC,"This is basically what happens in real life. Sometimes, life just isn't fair, bad things happen to good people. It's just something we have to live with.      I think the developers addressed this well. Even the purest of souls can be dragged down to an inescapable nightmare, but if someone cares enough, they can help them, they won't be able to change how life works, but it helps them persevere, and move forward. Things don't always go the way you want them, but hey, that's life, and Life is Strange."

lifeisstrange,3bqql0,safelywittyname,4,Wed Jul 1 11:43:12 2015 UTC,"I think I know how you feel, but this is game is about adversities in life, you can't expect everything to have a happy ending.

lifeisstrange,3bqql0,haXona,2,Wed Jul 1 12:05:27 2015 UTC,I think her death/or if you save her plays a big role in making this game a lot more emotional and it really worked. I was heartbroken by her death and people who saved her thanked whatever holy spirit they believe in.  Its a really good narrative mover in the sense that the game has a lot of dialogues and sentiments that are different depending on the fact if she dies or lives.

Still as somebody who took that money I am really interested how this will play out since David gets message from police that Chloes car was found at Blackwell at the time of burglary. You can delete that message but if police find out that also money got missing, they will surely check Chloe."
lifeisstrange,3bopjn,TAGsvk,3,Wed Jul 1 08:57:44 2015 UTC,"Jeez. So many possible consequences.  But right now, we're in another timeline and nothing of that will ever affect us, right? ... Right?   Still, it's gonna be hella interesting to see how this plays out. Mari from geekremix also noted that some small details point to the possibility that Max and Chloe weren't the first ones to enter Blackwell Academy that night."
lifeisstrange,3bopjn,Cloudshaped,2,Wed Jul 1 10:03:38 2015 UTC,"Hmmm... What details ? That could be interesting...  I assume that we wont spent much time in alternative timeline. Lot of stuff is veeery different and thus not many informations will help Max in main timeline. Surely we will some some exposition about Chloe, some touchy things that will William say because I have feeling that we will be able to tell him truth and then when we come back game will let us decide to not to tell or tell everything to Chloe. Shiiet that will be hard. Also Rachel, but I think that she is gone also there, at the time when she come to her senses in that timeline there was like all Blackwell but she wasnt anywhere near at that time. Maybe we will meet her and find out that everyting is fine here or we will after all see plot twist that Max = Rachel. That vortex party scene was from main timeline so we will be for sure back."
lifeisstrange,3bopjn,TAGsvk,2,Wed Jul 1 10:15:58 2015 UTC,"Some small tidbits including the cigarettes in Jefferson's class, the lone cigarette in the skeleton's mouth in science class (which probably weren't there during classes because someone would get scolded for it), beer and pizza leftovers on the campus and the full cup of coffee at the pool's office.  Yeah, I also think the new timeline only serves to show that Max can't continue to alter time to that extent and that we'll return to hella punk Chloe. I don't know about Rachel. It's possible that Chloe never even knew her in the alternate timeline and that's why there are no missing posters, or Rachel never went missing, OR Rachel doesn't even exist in that timeline!  Well, the only clue that points to the Vortex Party scene being in the main timeline is Max' choice of clothes, right? I'm not 100% convinced, but we'll see. dontnod EP4 right nao pls"
lifeisstrange,3bopjn,Cloudshaped,2,Wed Jul 1 10:29:28 2015 UTC,"If that Vortex party is from main timeline...  I think you can sing up there in EP2 and at the pool in EP3 you can mess up with guests list - in both cases ""this action will have hella concequences"" will appear. About Max clothes. Here I have 2 theories.  1. Max that lived in alternative timeline is not that different. Willams death changed things only around him. Max still left Chloe, had normal exactly same life in Seattle then came back as same shy geek. Only last week since she doesnt met up with Chloe was different. Maybe since Rachel is less relevant in this timeline and Victoria pretty hates her, same sort of ""butterfly effect releations"" stuff caused that Victiora and Max somewhat ended up together. One of her bossy friends even said that she havent even let her in their group suggesting that they are friends only for short time but since after all they all are together only for few weeks on Blackwell its not that imposible that they just bring her to them. Other changes can be easily explained by Williams death - David never met Joyce - never had reason to keep his ""call of duty"" (lol) or higher salary. Warren-freak now saw Max out of his league thus she came along with Brooke (I think ?). In this case Max is still for most part ""Max"" and she still have her classic clothes - and maybe then its really from alternative timeline. 2. Max is different. As she stole her younger yourself part of her ""Max Amber"" new non-shy version was left in young Max making her be different person. In this case I doubt that there are any ""Jane Doe"" clothes to be found close to Arcadia thus I expect that we will come back. Also if this is true, Max life was so different that she wouldnt have even chance to think about staying there since everything is different in her life that makes her lost there."
lifeisstrange,3bopjn,TAGsvk,3,Wed Jul 1 11:23:39 2015 UTC,"To 1.   Yeah, my guess is that rather the Vortex Club has changed, not Max per se. Seeing as Chloe probably didn't get involved with Rachel and Frank's drug dealing business, Nathan wouldn't have to get pissed at Chloe (and almost shooting her), Max wouldn't have to accuse Nathan (and thus screwing her chances with the Vortex Club) and the overall atmosphere on the campus would be much friendlier.  Really strange how William's death (or rather, what Chloe makes out of it) changes a lot!  To 2.  Ah, I don't really buy into the whole Max = Rachel shenanigans. I think Max' change in personality (if it actually has changed) comes from the fact that she wouldn't have to feel bad about leaving Chloe when she went to Seattle, as she wouldn't have to cope with the loss of her father and need a close friend.  Max could then be more open about friendship because she wouldn't have her conscience bite her in the rear.  Yeah, it's highly unlikely that Max will stay in Maxine's timeline - for Max, the whole world has probably changed for worse, even though it's probably the 'ideal' timeline for Maxine (save for the tornado threating to wipe out Arcadia Bay, buuut that's hella irrelevant, right?)."
lifeisstrange,3bopjn,Cloudshaped,3,Wed Jul 1 12:02:08 2015 UTC,"""Maxine""  I forgot about this one in Point Number 2. Why the heck would that same Max let herself be called Maxine. That's best proof that Max had changed more and theory 2 is more possible."

Unless you let Chloe take the money, of course - that's sure as hell gonna be noticed. Which is why I think it's an incredibly dumb idea (though generally that seems to be Chloe's specialty)"
lifeisstrange,3bopjn,centerflag982,1 point,Thu Jul 2 09:31:23 2015 UTC,"I let Chloe take the money because at this point, Max is already on a watchlist. She's already about an inch away from being kicked out of school and people (Nathan, Wells and David) are already out for her blood.   But the main story, the main quest, is finding Rachel. The whole reason Max is with Chloe right now is to find out what happened to Rachel and whether she's alive or dead. That $5000 will buy a lot of information and gas to get them further toward that goal. While it's stupid and it's highly illegal and it's very very risky, that $5000 could find out what Frank knows, pay him off, get evidence of where Rachel has been. Max could just drop out of school and drive off with Chloe (as she is later tempted to do in Frank's RV).   My decision came down to the fact that at this point Max is no longer in good standing at the school and if Nathan is blamed, it wouldn't be unreasonable. If Max is blamed, she has very little to lose at this point and a lot to gain."

lifeisstrange,3boygq,RasereiHojo,15,Wed Jul 1 03:29:13 2015 UTC,"It is never explicitly mentioned that only Jefferson's students can enter the contest (I believe, dont hit me please) . So I think, since Vic and Nathan are obviously bff/bae, Nathan might have picked up some interest in going there, but from what we know from EP 2, he is not part of the course.  Also, Nathan is Jeffersons decoy theory stuff, but that is even less official."
lifeisstrange,3boygq,lixyna,9,Tue Jun 30 23:59:35 2015 UTC,"Could be taking a different photography class with Mr Jefferson, and he is asking all of his students to enter."
lifeisstrange,3boygq,fraggleroni,5,Tue Jun 30 23:57:58 2015 UTC,Might have already taken the class.
lifeisstrange,3boygq,DeathMcGunz,3,Wed Jul 1 01:57:54 2015 UTC,"In addition to the contest entry you mentioned, during the snow montage at the end of EP1 Nathan is shown sitting in front of Blackwell holding a camera, and in Chloe's recollection of being dosed by Nathan she talks about him using a camera.  That gives us 3 separate instances of Nathan being involved with photography, so although I don't think he's in the class, there's definitely something important going on with Nathan and photography as a theme.  I don't know that this is the place for theorycrafting, but I'm doing it anyway since you brought it up. Nathan is intentionally left mysterious, so I'm sure the writers have some mind-blowing reveal planned for episode 4 or 5, either about him being right and on top of things, or being way more evil than Max already believes.   Episode 3 reveals that Max's powers can be magnified by photography. Nathan expresses interest in photography, but isn't in the class. Perhaps he wasn't interested until he witness some of the supernatural things going on in Arcadia, and he knows that photography has some kind of influence about what's going on."
lifeisstrange,3boygq,zqwefty,2,Wed Jul 1 08:05:38 2015 UTC,"Nathan also has his camera sitting on the table in front of him when we see him at the Two Whales in Ep.3.

Everyone who likes LiS should at least check it out, as I think that a big deal of inspiration was taken from it.

There are two sequels to The Magicians, so that should keep you entertained for a few weeks. I don't really know how to sell it to you, but this saga is the best I've read so far, and it will make you laugh and cry countless times."

But then i remembered she did jump before Max got up there and Max prevented it. This does add to the theory that someone is leaving these messages for Max.  But you know Blackwell, probably just some asshole"

lifeisstrange,3bnr13,HelloCringle,5,Tue Jun 30 22:18:23 2015 UTC,"The Kate one changes depending on if she jumps, I believe if she jumps it says something like ""Max killed Kate on that roof"" or something similar."
lifeisstrange,3bnr13,SkateboardCop,3,Tue Jun 30 22:03:28 2015 UTC,"The 'Rachel abides' is a reference to The Big Lebowski, if you didn't knew already. And I think it captures her attitude, and not so much her telling anyone anything."
lifeisstrange,3bnr13,Paddo_In_Wonderland,5,Wed Jul 1 12:51:52 2015 UTC,That would be really awesome if Rachel sent those messages... If it's true then Kate surviving could add to the tornado.. or at least something a bit minor.
lifeisstrange,3bnr13,Sanguine137x,2,Tue Jun 30 22:04:22 2015 UTC,"I think the one in the Two Whales bathroom (that changes depending on whether or not Kate jumps), and the one in the Boys Locker Room at the pool - 69 reasons to bang Rachel - are by the same person. They both look like they are almost stenciled on and the writing style is a good match too.  My guess for the author of these 2 peices of graffitti is Nathan.   He is the only other person from school in the Two Whales that morning (ep.3) that would know any real details about Kate's situation besides Max herself. Add to that, the same type of Graffitti in the Locker Room, where we know Nathan has spent time as well, and i think it's plausible at least these 2 examples are his.  Something is up with that camera he carts around with him (but never uses?) I almost wonder if (based on the changing Kate graffiti) Nathan can SEE different outcomes than everyone else, or has had his own vision of how things were meant to go before Max started fucking with time. And now he's confused and agitated more than usual?"

He's a little apathetic, sure, but he really seems like a guy teaching what he loves doing. If you don't blame him in Episode 2, he is obviously opposed to Victoria's flirting at the beginning of Episode 3, and it does seem like he believes Victoria is trying to coerce him into getting her ahead in the Everyday Heroes contest, so I don't think he's an outright slimy guy, or even a secretly slimy guy. His classroom is also the only one that doesn't have ANY red binders, and I don't think he has an office elsewhere. Of course, like everything else so far, we could be thrown a serious curveball.   I'm also quick to point out that in this timeline, Kate may not have gone through her episode, and Rachel may not have disappeared. In fact, for all we know, Rachel still met Chloe and they have the same kind of relationship in this 'timeline', but this time she's stuck around.  Max is cool now, and Victoria is SERIOUSLY different from how we've known her for the last three episodes, and with all this difference, what's there saying that anything we've learned before is true here?   Personally, I'm keeping the ""believe nothing until I see it"" mentality. Theories are fun and all, but for my own sanity I've got to keep them as just that. For all we know, Episode Four will start with Max waking up like the beginning of every episode, back in her own time. And I'm not sure if that's the dumbest theory I've had about this game, but it's certainly the most classic way to wrap up this debacle. Call me old-fashioned :P"

lifeisstrange,3blxsd,mahiro,5,Tue Jun 30 09:01:52 2015 UTC,awesome! My guess also is Chloe has to die. Max will use the picture of the blue butterfly to go back to that moment to let Chloe die & bust Nathan.   But I am excited to see how it ties in with the apocalypse theme of the game. Is Max's power setting that off as well? Will the destruction of the town also be stopped by letting Chloe die  and never getting the powers in the first place?   I don't know because Max has her first vision about the tornado BEFORE she ever got her power.
lifeisstrange,3blxsd,momothesheep,4,Tue Jun 30 16:31:29 2015 UTC,"The confusing part about Chloe being a sacrifice is that Chloe was going to die that day, with or without max. So if Chloe's death is the answer to stop the tornado, why bother giving max the power to change time in the first place? Every time she changes something big, a weird event happens, like unexpected snow, or unscheduled eclipses. So she knows she can't change the timeline, so what's the point? Why must max have powers if when she uses them, things go wrong in the long run. Does that make sense, because it did in my head.."

lifeisstrange,3blxsd,momothesheep,2,Tue Jun 30 20:00:28 2015 UTC,"Yes but that only holds up assuming some higher power /""they"" decided to gift max with powers.  What if it was just triggered by the strong emotional reaction to seeing someone (almost) shot? That 'oh shit I wish I could turn back time' feeling becoming so strong it actually happens?   In that case going back to the beginning to let Chloe die would be a 'lesson' along the lines of: time is not a toy, you throw life out of balance when you manipulate it (apocalypse theme).  But then again: as I said max has visions of the towns destruction before receiving / developing her power."

lifeisstrange,3blxsd,PeskyCanadian,1 point,Wed Jul 1 07:39:45 2015 UTC,"It seems all of her powers are triggered by strong emotions. She turns back time when she sees a girl being shot, she stops time to save her friend Kate after seeing her jump off a roof, she travels back to the past to save her friend Chloe after seeing her have an absolute melt down.   None of it happens intentional really for the first time, it's the reflex of a hand moving to do something."
lifeisstrange,3blxsd,momothesheep,2,Wed Jul 1 18:08:59 2015 UTC,"I don't think they are visions at all. In those ""visions"", she is still able to control time. I think she can move forward in time also or she can only reverse. However, the latter option brings an obvious dilemma.  Maybe we are in the past in all three episodes and the tornado is the present. That does leave a massive hole, what happened in between the classroom scene and the tornado coming 4 days later. What happened to her memories?   So probably unlikely but just some speculation. I also had to keep my mind off the idea of Chloe dying, that will tear me up Q.Q"
lifeisstrange,3blxsd,Vel0Xx,3,Wed Jul 1 03:46:36 2015 UTC,"Good point! If the lighthouse scenes are just dreams or visions, why can max use her power in it at the end of episode 1?  But if it's true that the destruction is present and all episodes are past - why walk up to the lighthouse twice?   Max had two visions that differ in the beginning (no powers & no threats; powers & threats) but both end with the same event: boat hitting the lighthouse.  So I do think it's a dream or a vision. The first time she has it she has no powers yet, so they don't feature in the dream. The second time she does have powers, so possibly a subconscious thing to include that.  Also, the first time the lighthouse drops on max, waking her up. That's very normal for a dream. The second time max can avoid getting killed using her powers. I think those dreams were a means to tie episode 1 together, especially bc they haven't featured since.  The apocalypse theme is now carried by the freak weather, dying animals and hints  like  the tornado shaped ant colony.   It is of course possible that max came time hopping from the future like she did in episode 3 to rescue Chloe's dad. But - when we were time hopping with max there was a) no memory loss and b) you would travel to a specific point in time to change the one event that made things go to shit. Not just go back a week and dick around.  Also the photo time hopping has restrictions - she can only move within the space the picture was taken in. So even if max from the future travelled back to the selfie taken in Jeffersons class, we would not be able to leave the art room.   So if max came from the future she came on a different way & lost all her memories. I personally think it's a vision tho."
lifeisstrange,3blxsd,momothesheep,2,Wed Jul 1 10:20:57 2015 UTC,"I have the idea about a theory for the beginning of the game... So how you said - Max tried to get back to Jeffersons class to let Chloe die but she lost her memories, because she was hit by the lighthouse or smth... So the story repeats and repeats - she wants to let Chloe die but she loses her memory every time :)"
lifeisstrange,3blxsd,Vel0Xx,2,Wed Jul 1 12:44:23 2015 UTC,"Interesting, but I don't think so:   If Max wants to let Chloe die, she would use the butterfly picture to go right to the bathroom - from what we know you can only move within the room the picture was taken in!   Okay, let's say the butterfly picture is not available to Max as she wants to go back (it is in Chloe's house) and she uses her selfie - she should not be able to move outside of the art room, where it was taken.   I doubt that we will end up getting stuck in a loop - unless max somehow gets the ability to rewind so far back. Feels like a time span this long would kill her - but maybe that's what accounts for the memory loss.   God.. that game.   //edit:   omg - what if you end getting stuck in a loop unless you make exactly the right decisions?   \O/"

It's sometimes hard to remember that the game's supposed to take place in a FIVE day time span.  I forget sometimes because of the wait between episodes and the whole time manipulation thing really skews your perception on it.

lifeisstrange,3blqxh,Meet_Dave,7,Tue Jun 30 23:05:19 2015 UTC,"You're two days away from the entire town being destroyed, I suspect something like going to the movies isn't a high priority."
lifeisstrange,3blqxh,Lukasstylezz,3,Tue Jun 30 07:50:43 2015 UTC,"Fair point, though you could make that argument for damn near everything."
lifeisstrange,3blqxh,Arya_Stupid,7,Tue Jun 30 07:52:20 2015 UTC,I agree. The whole plot seems weird to me. If I had a vision of my town getting destroyed I wouldn't be hanging around investigating a seemingly unrelated disappearance. I'd tell anyone who would listen then get the hell out of dodge.
lifeisstrange,3blqxh,TomWish,2,Tue Jun 30 08:01:54 2015 UTC,"I mean, I get where you're coming from, but let's be real, not many people are going to believe you if you go up to them and say ""hey man a tornado is going to destroy the town in three days and I know this because I saw it in a vision, so you'd better pack all your things and evacuate the town""."
lifeisstrange,3blqxh,bookloaf,1 point,Tue Jun 30 22:31:40 2015 UTC,"But you have to try. As crazy as the whole thing sounds I would have to at least warn people and if it didn't happen then good, that's the best possible thing that could have happened."
lifeisstrange,3blqxh,mybro4sale,5,Tue Jun 30 23:08:02 2015 UTC,"I'm certain at least the majority of those will happen. Number 1, 3, 4, 7, 8 will surely happen. All of the others just depend, i can't see us going to the cinema which makes me think something will happen to Warren or something? I'd love to visit Kate and just become bff's with her <3"
lifeisstrange,3blqxh,AERXihu,5,Tue Jun 30 11:28:10 2015 UTC,"I don't think Max is a lesbian. And i think Nathan really wanted to help Kate. I don't hate David, so i blamed Mr.Jefferson >:)"
lifeisstrange,3blqxh,JC_Phoenix7,2,Tue Jun 30 14:05:20 2015 UTC,"There's also a football game on friday, and the other party that Dana invited Max to.  Also on my list, the weird footprints and various other oddities at the lighthouse (Wind Glyphs anyone?)  WTF is up with Mr. jefferson? He skeeves me out, and he hasn't really done anything yet. But, he is on our 'list of important people' in our journal, so my guess is he's more involved than it seems right now."
lifeisstrange,3blqxh,CMCyantist,2,Tue Jun 30 22:40:04 2015 UTC,"I'm afraid this game may turn into a Deadman Wonderland  It's an anime, and the creators just sticked everything into the last few episodes just so that it was finished. I'm afraid this may happen to LiS"
lifeisstrange,3blqxh,Ccrasus,2,Tue Jun 30 15:29:04 2015 UTC,The drive in with Warren is super important to me. I really hope we get to do it in Ep. 4. I honestly don't see why the Max x Warren ship gets so much hate.
lifeisstrange,3blqxh,VerdeLocs,0,Tue Jun 30 16:23:15 2015 UTC,"DUDE, WHAT'S IN THE SAFE?!"
lifeisstrange,3blqxh,bookloaf,1 point,Tue Jun 30 17:27:24 2015 UTC,Some of these things are gonna be skipped over and only brought up as additional dialogue or text messages:  Go to the drive in with Warren. Visit Kate in hospital/funeral.  Things that will happen are  Vortex Club party (It is in the teaser so we should already know it is happening) Find Rachel Amber/killer (or atleast something of the sort) Stop the Apocolypse Find out the folder stuff Escape alternate reality (not sure about resolving the hatred though)  That is pretty much it.
lifeisstrange,3blqxh,AERXihu,1 point,Tue Jun 30 23:08:00 2015 UTC,"Personally I'm not expecting Chloe to survive this season, so I'm guessing they'll skip out on the resolving the hatred issue to save time."
lifeisstrange,3bltju,satanslittleghost,10,Tue Jun 30 06:57:54 2015 UTC,"With the whole ""Let William Die"" thing, I believe after the way Chloe reacts in her car at the end of EP 3.  We will see William give Max a note and gift of some kind to give back to Chloe (If Max does indeed go back to the original timeline)  This will be a little gesture from him to Chloe to apologize for what happened to him."
lifeisstrange,3bltju,ZeLzStorm,2,Tue Jun 30 10:04:22 2015 UTC,This ^
lifeisstrange,3bltju,Meet_Dave,8,Tue Jun 30 11:29:32 2015 UTC,Gotta go full Batman on this one
lifeisstrange,3bltju,ZeLzStorm,2,Tue Jun 30 11:38:27 2015 UTC,haha :D
lifeisstrange,3bltju,Meet_Dave,0,Tue Jun 30 11:40:38 2015 UTC,"While yes, I think she'll go back and let Chloe die, I don't think she'll use that photo. Because that photo was taken in a corner of the bathroom, and Chloe gets shot in front of the door. That leaves max trapped in the corner with Nathan, a dead body and a gun. And going to the principal saying Nathan shot her and you saw it won't do you any favours as Nathan's families so tied in to the school, accusing the son of murder just won't work out in the schools favour in the principals mind. It'll be like if you tell the principal about the gun in EP 1, he'll think you're crazy. I think she'll use mr Jeffersons class photo, especially since then, if she times it right, she can get the principal to enter/see Nathan with the gun. I don't know, both photos feel so significant to me, surely they wouldn't make you take a selfie in class just to steal Victorias answer and make her laugh at you?"
lifeisstrange,3bltju,PMmysteriousPictures,7,Tue Jun 30 07:33:57 2015 UTC,"Also, sorry essay length answers here. But I reckon you get a choice. There are 2 selfies in the game that you must take in order to advance, the one in Jeffersons class, and the one in Chloe's room after the pool. I think this is the choice. Either you go back to before anything happened, let Chloe die and 'save the world'. Or you go back to Chloe's room, let Chloe live, and let Arcadia 'turn to glass'. It just feels like they wouldn't make you take a photo without it having some impact, since you have the optional photos, serving only as achievements and a bit of extra play, so why make me take photos? Particularly photos of Max. This was my immediate thought the second she jumped in the photo, retained everything she knew about her power and everyone but was in a different time period."
lifeisstrange,3bltju,PMmysteriousPictures,3,Tue Jun 30 07:39:07 2015 UTC,"Maybe you'll be able to choose which photo you'd like to go through? I mean, that'd take a lot of work for the developers, but I think it'd be pretty cool :D"
lifeisstrange,3bltju,noblesse2225,1 point,Tue Jun 30 14:02:30 2015 UTC,"I'm hoping we get at least some timeline divergence. I mean come on, how hard is it really? It's not like this is some advanced video game technology that hasn't been invented yet, it just means they have to do certain scenes twice.  I have faith that Dontnod will come up with some way to make it work."
lifeisstrange,3bltju,Dear_Occupant,3,Tue Jun 30 20:29:43 2015 UTC,"And going to the principal saying Nathan shot her and you saw it won't do you any favours as Nathan's families so tied in to the school, accusing the son of murder just won't work out in the schools favour in the principals mind.   You're forgetting something here: David Madsen is literally right outside the door. He's going to hear that gunshot, he knows Nathan has problems, and he will absolutely wreck anyone who hurts Joyce's daughter. He'll know exactly what went down. If anything, that dude is a little too eager to do his job. Max might have to rewind time to save Nathan's ass at that point."
lifeisstrange,3bltju,Dear_Occupant,3,Tue Jun 30 20:24:23 2015 UTC,"True. David cares a lot more than people like to admit. He's highly protective of Joyce and Chloe, too, he's just bad at showing it in appropriate ways. He's attempting to be a good guy--he's just not doing it quite right.  I think that whole thing would be really cool, honestly--Max having to save Nathan despite all the shitty things he's done, I mean. It's ironic, in a sense, and it'd be cool to see the way Nathan might react and/or change his behavior in response.  I don't know if this outcome is likely, though. I think the developers are going to be aiming for something a bit bigger, and more deeply emotional. Something that they can weave into Ep 5, if Max manages to fix things before the end of Ep 4."
lifeisstrange,3bltju,Dear_Occupant,3,Tue Jun 30 20:34:26 2015 UTC,"Well, I will just say that in that Ep2 scene when Max sees David and Nathan talking... if you look at their body language it looks like David is dressing down Nathan. Like he's talking to him the same way he'd talk to Chloe. Contrary to what Max assumed at the time, I always had the impression that David is trying to help Nathan in a fatherly way because he sort of understands what he's going through."

lifeisstrange,3bk1pu,six619,38,Mon Jun 29 21:23:43 2015 UTC,"Sometimes it just...drifts apart.  A very good friend of mine left when I was about Max's age, and I never wrote to her.  Never called, never did anything to get in contact with her until years later when I found her randomly on Facebook.  I don't know why I never talked to her until years later.  I just...didn't.  She was kinda gone from my life, so I didn't try keeping in touch.  Maybe Max didn't know what to say.  Maybe she was anxious about it.  Maybe she thought Chloe didn't want to hear from her.  Maybe there's some deeper reason.  Whatever it is, it doesn't really bother me that we don't know, I guess because I've had that experience.  As for waiting to call after she got back, she had to move in, start school, get to know the area, and in general experience a large level of culture shock.  She also didn't know if Chloe was still there.  Maybe she didn't even have her number anymore, or an email, or anything like that.  She also might have been really anxious about calling Chloe and saying hey, sorry I never said anything in five years!  And thus was going to push it off as long as humanly possible."
lifeisstrange,3bk1pu,ThreadOfFate,15,Mon Jun 29 22:27:03 2015 UTC,So what you're saying is... life is strange?
lifeisstrange,3bk1pu,Illidan1943,9,Tue Jun 30 07:35:56 2015 UTC,"She also might have been really anxious about calling Chloe and saying hey, sorry I never said anything in five years! And thus was going to push it off as long as humanly possible.   I got that impression very strongly from her journal... it sounded like she's really been wanting to get in touch, but just isn't sure how to approach it"
lifeisstrange,3bk1pu,centerflag982,26,Tue Jun 30 07:50:37 2015 UTC,"I know from experience that it can be exceedingly difficult to keep contact with friends who've moved.  And with my social anxiety, I keep putting it off until the point comes when I'm afraid to contact them because it's been so long, therefore making the problem worse and worse until it becomes seemingly impossible to even think of contacting them after all this time.  It doesn't make sense, but it does."
lifeisstrange,3bk1pu,KaesoDip,4,Mon Jun 29 22:36:35 2015 UTC,"I keep putting it off until the point comes when I'm afraid to contact them because it's been so long, therefore making the problem worse and worse until it becomes seemingly impossible to even think of contacting them after all this time.   So true. I come off as a pretty outgoing and confident person to most people, but this form of anxiety is such a frequent problem in my life that I'm wondering if I don't need to maybe get it checked out. Then again, I'm almost 40, I've gone so long without seeing a therapist about it, and they'll wonder why I waited this long to try to fix it..."
lifeisstrange,3bk1pu,Dear_Occupant,5,Tue Jun 30 20:34:51 2015 UTC,"There is more into it for sure. Strange is that with shitload of exposition that we getting from Max via jurnal, internal dialogues etc. she never once mentioned real reason behind this. Its like there is some big revelation coming up."
lifeisstrange,3bk1pu,TAGsvk,6,Mon Jun 29 22:12:21 2015 UTC,Not really. I moved too and pretty much havnt talked to any of my.close friends in years..i miss them. But it juat so akward to suddenly out of nowhere try and talk with them like you are still close.. Idk i guess u have to exprience it to undrstand why .
lifeisstrange,3bk1pu,MowchiBear,5,Tue Jun 30 00:15:39 2015 UTC,"Well things happen   Some months ago directly after Ep.2 I got to see my best friend that I hadn't seen in 7 years.   We were besties since birth separated by one month only, we really were like a brother and sister to each other our parents were best friends. In 2007 however my parents decided that we should move because some issues regarding financial problems and betrayal from a good family friend happened - I was only 13 at the time so almost like Max. We practically moved so that we were an 8 hour drive away and I really couldnt affect my parents decision because it was the right one to make.  The first week we used MSN every damn day but slowly it just faded away and in no time we lost all contact to each other. Our bond had been defeated and it just felt wrong to contact her after that because I felt ashamed for forgetting her and geerally awkward if had popped out from nowhere and started talking with her.   So imagine the complete surprise when my mom told me that she was getting engaged and that I should surprise visit her and congratulate her.   So when I went there a couple of months ago or so and finally saw her for the first time since that cold night in October I really felt chocked(kinda like Max when Chloe appears in the car out of nowhere).  So here I was standing there feeling really awkward about how I had totally forgotten our friendship for 7 years and it really made me sad and nervous.  Either way we went on to have a wonderful day and we shared some old memories together and it really was just great.  So tie this to Max and I can totally see how it makes sense that you wouldnt call or msg even your best friend if you moved away while in the phase of growing as a person. We have to remember that it is in the teenage time that we almost define our future and friends. So to lose a friend right before that time ir at the start really is something that is forgotten fast.  This became a wall of text here but I hope you get the point that even best friends can lose their contact because of personal things or general development."
lifeisstrange,3bk1pu,haXona,4,Tue Jun 30 02:28:28 2015 UTC,"In Chloe's character entry in Max's journal, she says 'I feel bad because I wonder if I was happy to move away just to avoid the grief…'. To me, this makes it pretty clear she decided not to contact Chloe just because she wasn't sure she could handle supporting her. Still, I hope the game goes into this a bit more."
lifeisstrange,3bk1pu,Westerlyn,3,Tue Jun 30 07:59:44 2015 UTC,"I don't think Max had much of a choice about leaving, she was only 14. Her parents decided to move, it just happened to be shortly after William's accident. I think maybe she felt guilty about having to leave Chloe at such a difficult time, and at the same time didn't know how to deal with the grief. It sucks to see people you know and love going through a tragedy. Then as time went on it became more embarrassing to call, so she kept putting it off.  Oddly enough I went through in similar thing with a friend in highschool. We weren't as close as Max/Chloe but we spent a ton of time together. Her brother died tragically in a car accident. The whole school was in an absolute wreck over this, they were a popular family. I went to the wake/funeral and just seeing the family and all the friends so upset was really hard to deal with. After that, it's like we just drifted apart while the family was grieving. During the time we didn't speak I was very selfishly relieved that I didn't have to watch the family go through that any more. I also thought I was doing the right thing by giving her space and figured she'd reach out to me if she wanted to. I didn't see her for a couple of years after that, even though we both remained in the same town AND school.   So to me Max's behavior isn't that odd."
lifeisstrange,3bk1pu,Infamy7,3,Tue Jun 30 00:00:19 2015 UTC,"I had a somewhat similar experience, friend with a tragic loss, sudden move. Basically at first I didn't know what to say. Then I had been out of contact for long enough it was awkward calling or writing. Then the longer I waited the more awkward it became. It's a nasty cycle that you justify at first with, ""I'll know what to do later"" and then as it goes on it becomes, ""I'll probably never see her again anyway."""
lifeisstrange,3bk1pu,herrnewbenmeister,3,Tue Jun 30 03:06:02 2015 UTC,"If Chloe called/texted Max multiple times and Max just ignored it all, then I would understand why Chloe was so pissed off. But if she didn't make any effort to contact Max either, she really shouldn't put all the blame on her since it's both of their faults.  I think that Chloe was so withdrawn after her fathers death that she and Max already drifted apart before Max moved or that she lashed out on Max when she found out about her moving. In either situation Max wouldn't know how to contact Chloe again, so she just never did."
lifeisstrange,3bk1pu,aaanaab,2,Tue Jun 30 03:55:56 2015 UTC,"maybe a part of max was not accepting williams death too. maybe she couldn't check in with chloe because she dont want to accept his death.. maybe she was running away. again, this may not be true. i cant think of anything that could justify max not calling chloe. unless t has something to do with william. maybe i am wrong, but thats how i feel"
lifeisstrange,3bk1pu,Mercyva,1 point,Mon Jun 29 21:44:08 2015 UTC,"One way I saw it was that maybe Max moved about 5 and a half or few so months ago (not exactly 5 years). She maybe then remained in contact till that ""5 year mark"" when it all dropped as it happens when people drift apart.  I've had this ""drifting away"" experience with countless friends and it has happened again recently (I'm great at keeping friends ._.). After awhile apart the inner monologue becomes like ""Would it still be appropriate to talk to him/her now? What if he/she gets pissed off or has moved on with life and doesn't like me anymore? He/she's probably found better people. Nevermind."" Insecurities come into play for me, perhaps so for Max as well.  For me though, the silence is almost always mutual between the two parties which seems not to be the case with Chloe seeing as how pissed she is about the whole thing. If you pick ""give me a break"" when Chloe has a go at you in the car, Max gets angry and says ""Gimme a break. I was going through changes too."" Then Chloe says ""Bullshit, you thought you'd hook up with the art pricks in Seattle. Didn't happen tho."""
lifeisstrange,3bk1pu,Gonarhxus,1 point,Tue Jun 30 00:48:35 2015 UTC,Maybe someone in Max's family had something to do with William's car accident?
lifeisstrange,3bk1pu,junglefoot,1 point,Tue Jun 30 00:54:29 2015 UTC,"I dont think she really had a choice about leaving. If you're 14 and your parents move, you move with them. The silence between them feels normal to me, I've had that happend in my life too many times. After changing school, after graduating, etc. Time passes by and suddenly you realize its been a whole year since you last talked, its just too late now so you keep pushing it a little more and more, and they probably have some better friends anyway. I agree it would be nice having Max say/write something about it though."
lifeisstrange,3bk1pu,yakle,1 point,Tue Jun 30 01:43:08 2015 UTC,"I want to know if Chloe made any effort to contact Max as well. It shouldn't be on one person to make contact, if she wanted to reach out then she should have reached out.   I'm not saying Max ISN'T in the wrong, it is pretty shitty cutting someone who was so close off completely for... Well seemingly no other reason than distance.  It was a failure on both ends of the friendship, I think. But perhaps nobody's in the wrong and life just got in the way, or how Max would put it:  ""It's just life, shit happens, it's nobody's fault ""blah blah blah"" as Mr. Jefferson would say."""
lifeisstrange,3bk1pu,kemando,1 point,Tue Jun 30 07:33:17 2015 UTC,"I moved pretty much all my life and I truly understand what Max did.   I had great friends on a lot of the places I moved to, but I never kept in touch with the majority of them. It's not that I didn't want to.. Time just simply passed by and the more it passed by, I felt guilty and I didn't know if that friend of mine is still that same person I enjoyed. So I kept making up excuses in my head and just blocked it out.  I'm sure Max was anxious just like I was and did not know what to say. Then the guilt built up since she knew Chloe needed her, but she left."
lifeisstrange,3bk1pu,Schlachten,0,Tue Jun 30 18:18:34 2015 UTC,I don't believe so. This part of the story has been dealt with as far as I can tell. It's simply the setup that they needed to introduce us to Arcadia Bay while Max is also (re)discovering it and giving us exposition. There's so much else to research and reveal that I can't imagine we will go into this in more detail. Some surprise revelation here would be out of the blue and less satisfying than resolving the tons of relevant questions we have about the main storyline.
lifeisstrange,3bk1pu,978am,0,Tue Jun 30 15:29:15 2015 UTC,"I moved at one point when I was younger. It's not up to a kid when their parent's decide to move. And when you move far enough away, even within the same state or just out of state or across the country, you don't really get to keep in touch. You've got your own shit going on and as much as you miss your friends, what can you do really?  Moving really does change things."

Plays games and hangs out with the few friends I have. Struggles with being depressed and pessimistic about life but can manage to be 'carefree' and optimistic most of the time. I'm a 'goody two shoes' and never late for class. Also INFJ personality type.  3 People I'd hang out with : Kate, Alyssa, Max. And wish I could hang out with Chloe.  Honestly I used to avoid 'people like Chloe' thinking they are just troublemakers and bad people in general but after this game Ive seriously realized how wrong I was. There is so much more to it. I just want to give Chloe a big hug and apologize for ignoring her and dismissing her as a lesser person when in reality she is a really strong, great person I admire. I know it sounds cheesy but this game has seriously had a huge impact on my views and look on life. Its also helps me whenever I get in my depressed state I just come to this sub and game and it really pulls me out of that feeling. Thank you so much TheWolfSpy, Dontnod, and this whole awesome community! Everyone is so nice here. I really would be a completely different person without all of you.

lifeisstrange,3bhw3b,Yelya,2,Tue Jun 30 09:34:05 2015 UTC,"Age: 18   Gender: Female  Clothing: green hoodie (matches eyes), hair in pony tail, video game tshirt, sneakers, dark blond hair, kind of boyish.   Personality: Awkward but sweet kid who is always willing to fight people if necessary. Kind of a dork but everyone loves her because she will make you laugh. Clumsy and hopeful. Wants to talk to all kinds of people and learn everything there is to learn. She has a lot of luck.  3 people I'd hang out with: Kate (my name is Kate too!) I would crack really stupid jokes and talk to her too much to make sure she was okay, Chloe: we would get into so much trouble together because we both have no common sense, and Juliet because she's smart, sassy and a good dresser!   I have a problem with staying with games, I've only finished like 3 of them. But there's something about this game that kinda touched my heart in the best and worst ways possible. It can make you cry and laugh and stop you dead in your tracks. For the past 2 weeks it's the one thing that has been constantly on my mind. I think when it's finished I'm going to feel very empty, but lets not think about that!! Thank you for holding this contest, and thank you for helping dontnod during your internship. A little thing you might have done night have made the game as big as it is now. (Butterfly effect?)"

lifeisstrange,3bj8lk,TheMarshmallowBear,7,Mon Jun 29 17:55:02 2015 UTC,Calling it now.  William Price = Uncle BEN
lifeisstrange,3bj8lk,-Carlos-,5,Mon Jun 29 20:51:35 2015 UTC,I like the idea because I think Chloe is unable to let go because she never got any closure from her father. Never got a goodbye and all that. But this is probably wishful thinking that Max will reveal her spooky magic powers and supposedly convince William about it. But.. She can still make him write a letter in some way without telling him. Or something.
lifeisstrange,3bj8lk,Reavens,3,Mon Jun 29 21:48:05 2015 UTC,"I feel like no matter what happens, Chloe will never be able to accept William's death. Still a VERY interesting theory which still might happen."
lifeisstrange,3bj8lk,Ara-Player,4,Mon Jun 29 21:00:14 2015 UTC,"I think that this is possible, but I dont really like the idea.    Originally Williams death was an accident, it just happened, but now it was acctually William's active decision and Max was the one making that decision possible. Furthermore in some weird twisted logic Chloe could even seek the resposibility for what happened in her own actions - if she had not had that accident in the alternate timeline, then William would not have to make the decision to get killed in order to keep her healthy. And on top of that all those decisions were made without Chloe's consent. Someone made those choices for her.    If I were in Chloe's position and someone told me what you described, I would probably just give up, grab the gun and shoot me right on the spot. Of course that's only my opinion, but holy shit, the idea that someone fiddled with life in such a drastic way, decided who and what I am and then had the guts to tell me that this way is the best, would be to much. Max changing the past in order to save William was an honest mistake, but everything after is pure hybris imho. In my eyes nobody should have this level of power over other peoples lives."
lifeisstrange,3bj8lk,Dagegen,3,Mon Jun 29 20:48:35 2015 UTC,"The way you described it is the BEST reason for it to happen, because it would give an amazing storyline with Chloe realizing how much Max meddled, which could see Chloe go one way or the other."
lifeisstrange,3bj8lk,EsseFen,2,Mon Jun 29 21:08:27 2015 UTC,"which could see Chloe go one way or the other.   So if your theory happens, I guess we'll be seeing more of the significance of the picture swapping on her phone and so."
lifeisstrange,3bj8lk,windmillerz,2,Mon Jun 29 22:13:15 2015 UTC,"You got an excellent point, this can-change-other-people's lives-power is way too overwhelming, even if William sent a letter from alt timeline, it would a problem whether Chloe will accept or not, for someone made a decision of her father's death for her.  What I'm thinking is, what if Chloe left herself a message, about making peace and start a new life and all,,,,,,  I don't know, ,,,This speculation is very possible."
lifeisstrange,3bj8lk,benadoceo,0,Tue Jun 30 03:56:35 2015 UTC,"It would be really awkward if they went with this idea though, just imagine:  ""Hey William, I'm from the future, and I know how to fix Chloe's spine!""  ""...how?""  ""Ram your car into a tree.""  ""...""  ""no seriously, like, for reals"""
lifeisstrange,3bj8lk,PMmysteriousPictures,2,Tue Jun 30 13:03:42 2015 UTC,"Oh I like this theory! I find it hard to get mad at Chloe for her outbursts, especially if you look at it from her perspective. She was just enjoying a fun day with her lovely father and her best friend, they were drawing, playing, just being kids. Then that same day, her dad is killed. She's incredibly close to her dad, this hits her like a tonne of bricks. Then her mum married someone who hates Chloe, making her feel like an outcast in her own home. Then her best friend leaves her, but it's okay, she makes a new one, Rachael, they get on like a house on fire, until she leaves unexpectedly one day with no explanation. In Chloe's eyes, ever since that faithful day of the accident, her life just went tumbling down hill, she's understandably rebellious. I think a letter from William would give her the push she needs, to show her that yes, her life sucks right now, she's probably doing a lot better than she would've done if he hadn't died, Chloe's wheelchair bound, and going by the permanent ramp they've installed, she will be for life, what I noticed what she didn't say anything during the scene, can she still speak? Her hands and body were strapped down, is she completely paralysed? Does she really want all this, just to keep her dad alive, knowing she'll never get to fully experience life with him like it was before the accident. Sorry for the essay I just really like Chloe and fan theories surrounding her!"
lifeisstrange,3bj8lk,EsseFen,4,Mon Jun 29 20:02:32 2015 UTC,"Though I'm not much of a David Madsen fan (as his behavior sorta turns me off), I don't think he really hates Chloe, just really frustrated, judging from the card in the garage and his dialogue."

lifeisstrange,3bizj3,ububen,3,Mon Jun 29 17:08:54 2015 UTC,Or longer. They're working on another game between now and season 2 (assuming they do indeed move forward with it).

lifeisstrange,3bizj3,DuckOfDuckness,4,Mon Jun 29 17:37:29 2015 UTC,"As /u/ububen said, it's most likely going to be released on a Tuesday and I also think it will be either the 7th or 14th. Dontnod seem to have decided on ""8 weeks between each episode"". That would mean July 14th, but I'll still keep the hope that they release it earlier.  This is also what the ""~Early-mid July 2015"" estimate in the sidebar is based on, I just didn't want to give an actual date because then people would think an official release date had been announced.  As to why the first episode wasn't released on a Tuesday... ¯\_(ツ)_/¯"
lifeisstrange,3bizj3,AwesomeDewey,5,Mon Jun 29 17:41:37 2015 UTC,"It won't be on July 14th, because it's a National Holiday here in France. In France, you don't release on a Monday nor on a Friday nor during the week-end, unless you're playing with fire.  The most reasonable release dates in my opinion would be between July 7th and 9th, or on July 16th, or on July 21st."
lifeisstrange,3bizj3,DuckOfDuckness,3,Mon Jun 29 18:44:24 2015 UTC,"It's more than likely Square Enix (HQ in Tokyo) who gets to decide on the actual release date, and even then the various platforms have specific days for this kind of release. Steam, PlayStation, Xbox etc won't move their schedule just because some country in Europe has a holiday."
lifeisstrange,3bizj3,AwesomeDewey,4,Mon Jun 29 18:49:55 2015 UTC,"I doubt that Dontnod would let them choose the 14th.  You want your crew on the deck, especially for games with network functionalities (the stats at the end), ready and willing to fix/adjust all the things in real time, and to properly monitor the launch and reactions. This is not a 3 years dev cycle with tons of marketing, it's a bimonthly episodic game, and not even the finale. There's no planned release date, the episode is out as soon as it's done, so I guess Dontnod has final say on the planning.  I wouldn't be surprised if that was main reason why Dontnod released all their episodes in the late morning and in the middle of the week."
lifeisstrange,3bizj3,evetscipe,3,Mon Jun 29 19:05:30 2015 UTC,"I see where you're coming from, but I don't see them releasing on a non-Tuesday. As I said in my first comment, I think it'll be either July 7th or 14th. If they won't release on the 14th because of a national holiday, the obvious would be the 7th. That would be 7 weeks after Episode 3."
lifeisstrange,3bizj3,Psychout40,1 point,Mon Jun 29 19:09:25 2015 UTC,"I think it's slightly more realistic to expect a release on the 21st, then. After E3 (the convention, not the episode), all the kids finals, school festivals and holidays, the heatwave these last few weeks in Paris, I  expect productivity to take a hit rather than a boost compared to EP2 and EP3, unfortunately (for us).  Then again, public transports haven't been on strike yet this year, so your bet is as good as mine :)"
lifeisstrange,3bizj3,Herox01,4,Tue Jun 30 06:26:38 2015 UTC,"My guess has been July 14th for a while cause that goes in line with the whole 8 week release schedule and also the whole ""Games Mostly come out on tuesdays and thursdays"" thing that tends to happen a lot."
lifeisstrange,3bizj3,Herox01,3,Mon Jun 29 17:46:02 2015 UTC,I think that week is likely but I doubt the 12th because most people avoid updating on the weekend.

lifeisstrange,3bikho,ububen,7,Mon Jun 29 14:54:15 2015 UTC,"This is something that has been discussed a lot in the past, and it's really not clear what the intended answer is.  Here's some stuff I wrote about it in a previous thread:   On the face of it, Max should retain the photograph when she rewinds. It's just another physical object, so as long as she's in direct contact, she should retain it. The typical argument for the loss of the photograph is that the ""moment in time"" it captured no longer exists upon rewind, so the contents of the photograph can't be retained.  However, the food examples indicate that this argument shouldn't hold. When Max eats food, she's physically changing its state/arrangement - she's chewing it up, mixing it with the fluids in her stomach, it's starting to digest, etc. When the player rewinds in these scenes, the food stays eaten, and evidently none of it reforms back into perfect pancakes/bacon/etc within her stomach (that would be an uncomfortable sight to behold!). So, like you say, we know that Max can retain changes to the physical state/arrangement of objects when she rewinds.  The photograph itself - the paper, plastic, ink - all physically existed before and after the rewind. The only difference is that some of the constituent components have been altered/rearranged when exposed to light. So in light of the food example, there's no reason the David Madsen/Kate photograph shouldn't be retained if Max decides to rewind and select the ""intervene"" option. It still might not make sense for Max to bring it up as evidence in the principal's office (because you'd be showing a photograph of something David literally didn't do in that timeline), but the photograph itself should still exist.  An alternative is that the game may treat the ""moments in time"" interpretation of photography as a more supernatural element (which would work well with events of Episode 3). So maybe they're just a special case?  Regardless, I'd like to see Dontnod's thoughts on all this. Is there an internal consistency that we're just missing, or are the rewind ""rules"" being thought more as ""guidelines""?"
lifeisstrange,3bikho,SamuEL_or_Samuel_L,5,Mon Jun 29 16:49:44 2015 UTC,"I think it's in episode 1 when you talk to some guys skateboarding and they offer to do a trick for you. You choose from two options. One option will cause the guy to fall and you can take an optional picture of him on the ground. If you rewind and ask to see the other trick you still have the picture from the first one.   I guess the optional photos could be treated differently from a game/mechanics standpoint, but that doesn't really make sense in the story since it's still Max taking and keeping the photos."
lifeisstrange,3bikho,kellyev2006,1 point,Tue Jun 30 04:44:13 2015 UTC,"Yep.  There are a number of other examples like this too, all before the Kate/Madsen incident (therefore passively teaching the player that photographs are retained on rewind).  Messing up Victoria's photowall for a photo is one, and letting the football smash the window is another."
lifeisstrange,3bikho,SamuEL_or_Samuel_L,2,Tue Jun 30 07:49:40 2015 UTC,This is all too freaking confusing! xD
lifeisstrange,3bikho,TAGsvk,7,Mon Jun 29 16:54:12 2015 UTC,Because that photo doesnt exist yet then. Frank's key yes.
lifeisstrange,3bikho,goutthescout,1 point,Mon Jun 29 15:20:30 2015 UTC,"This seems the most reasonable explanation to me, even if the most likely explanation is an oversight on the part of the devs. The film sheet itself still exists, the exposure on it does not. Maybe light is affected differently by your rewind powers? I seem to recall at least one other later case where a photo you took needed to be retaken after rewinding."

lifeisstrange,3bi7wd,BobMugabe35,4,Mon Jun 29 14:29:25 2015 UTC,"More interesting is that she replaces that background with one where is Rachel.

That made me think that if that happened she will get  through her meltdown much easier since she already made her mind with feelings to Max and wont be like ""I have nobody left"".

I feel like these (as are my suggested above) are two completely different games, and that the recommendation of Gone Home and the fact that they advertised the game as being a 'Gone Home meets The Walking Dead' was awful.   The connection is extremely tenuous to the point where the only real connection is that Sam stole from her parents in order to pawn off stuff, and so did Chloe? And that Chloe is probably lesbian/bi?  I think Telltale games would be a much better recommendation, although I am so far liking the consequences/differences LiS is doing over Telltale's 'what you did, didn't matter in the end woooo'."

lifeisstrange,3bgwvm,EonOmega,5,Mon Jun 29 10:16:02 2015 UTC,"basically you choose between 3 different people dying or not, you can have 1 of any of them live, 2, or all 3.  as well as where your character ends up in the next season, a possibility of 3 locations i believe."
lifeisstrange,3bgwvm,OldGregg546,1 point,Mon Jun 29 10:23:53 2015 UTC,"The connection is extremely tenuous to the point where the only real connection is that Sam stole from her parents in order to pawn off stuff, and so did Chloe? And that Chloe is probably lesbian/bi?   They're both heavy on 'nostalgia' and the west coast hipster atmosphere that appeals to a lot of people, and both are considered by some to be ""non-traditional"" games. They both focus quite a bit on digging around and finding clues and tidbits about the characters through shit you find in their rooms, for example. But yeah I thought the comparisons between the two were a bit overdone too."
lifeisstrange,3bgwvm,BobMugabe35,7,Mon Jun 29 13:45:55 2015 UTC,I was massively disappointed by this game. Not because it was bad (it isn't) but because it was nowhere near as good as the massive hype the gaming media gave it.   The game was launched in the midst of GamerGate and I couldn't help but feel that it was lauded so heavily due to the game catering to the self-proclaimed open-minded media.
lifeisstrange,3bgwvm,WithFullForce,6,Mon Jun 29 13:12:10 2015 UTC,"The game was launched in the midst of GamerGate   Nah, a good year or so before. That debatably helped kickstart it later down the line, though."

lifeisstrange,3bgwvm,countmontecristo,2,Tue Jun 30 04:57:55 2015 UTC,"Well, I think there are a lot of similarities in the way they approach the idea of putting yourself in the shoes of a troubled teenager.

But I still don't get it why should we kill the dog.  And about that sexuality, I don't truly agree. The decision of choosing Girls' or Boys' don't have any warning (This action will have consequences). Still, the kiss Chloe option is indeed a major choice. So, I don't know...."
lifeisstrange,3bh0vi,FFaUniHan,4,Mon Jun 29 04:09:12 2015 UTC,"Its just some flirt from Chloe... like other 50% of EP3 is (lol)... Actual decision doesnt matter, (why even would ?) and if you choose boys you can see Warren's ""selfie montage"" with Max so... Still you can access both girls and boys or even get to the one of them, then rewind and suprise Chloe :D"
lifeisstrange,3bh0vi,TAGsvk,9,Mon Jun 29 08:09:01 2015 UTC,"The only reason I can think of is ""future proofing"", if there's another scene with Frank or sneaking around the dog could cause some trouble or something. Kind of like the gun in the episode 2, you don't need to shoot Frank, but attempting to will let Chloe keep her gun meaning she might need it in the future.  But still, it's an awful choice and I don't why you would choose it. But, I do know a lot of people don't rewind, they make a choice and stick with it. Or they don't replay and change the choice, or they might not of noticed the dog getting hit, that's probably explains the percentage split, rather than a whole bunch of people just really don't like dogs."
lifeisstrange,3bh0vi,SkateboardCop,3,Mon Jun 29 04:33:27 2015 UTC,"Well.. even if you don't shoot him, you can still retrieve the gun when you are in his RV... might lead to new dialogue so that is nice :D"
lifeisstrange,3bh0vi,FilmingMachine,4,Mon Jun 29 13:11:47 2015 UTC,"In my opinion Chloe having that gun is the worst possible option. Especially with how we left things with her. She is majorly losing her shit.  I swear she is going to kill herself (maybe that 'I want to die' note was hers?) or someone else. And i just don't trust her with it.

The only person in the diner i left with the memory of me speaking to them was the Cop. He seemed like a nice dude, and good to have in your corner."
lifeisstrange,3bh0vi,Arya_Stupid,4,Tue Jun 30 23:01:51 2015 UTC,"hopefully he will just think he lost his keys somewhere.   And that his dog just teleported out of his RV into the street? And the vent cover that his notebook was hidden behind just suddenly fell off the wall? And just where is that notebook?  No matter how careful you are in the diner, there's gonna be clear evidence of a break-in. And for plot-driving purposes, Frank's going to realize who broke in either way - there's almost certain to be another confrontation with him if you leave the dog alive and he sees you, and I can't see DN just cutting out an entire (likely significant) scene if you killed it. So, they'll have him put the pieces together regardless."
lifeisstrange,3bh0vi,centerflag982,2,Tue Jun 30 23:17:01 2015 UTC,"Well if he lost his keys, he wouldn't have locked the door, right?  I guess i'm operating on the assumption that peoples minds will correct itself with assumptions when an anomoly occurs. Like how Max appears to teleport when she rewinds, but no one notices because the mind fills in the most plausible scenario. - 'of course people don't teleport, i must have blinked really long while she walked really fast.' ( not a great example, but i hope you catch my meaning.)  So, i guess i figure that Frank will assume that he left the trailer door unlocked because he lost his keys, the dog managed to get the door open (not impossible, i've seen real life dogs do stranger shit), and his notebook will be sitting on his table, right where i left it. The vent is closed again, so maybe he will just think that he took it out earlier and left it there himself.  Look, i know this is alot of assumptions and maybes and whatnot, but it could possibly work out the way i hope it will. But if not, at least i didn't piss him off any more than i already had. :)"

lifeisstrange,3bh0vi,FilmingMachine,2,Mon Jun 29 13:12:29 2015 UTC,"I rewound myself right out of Franks memory before i left, so that he would never even know that i wanted to speak to him about anything.   This is one of my favorite things about the rewind mechanic. You get to decide what everyone you speak to remembers about the conversation, while still getting the opportunity to learn everything you can and follow all the lines of thought through to the end / or not, as you choose.   Like how you can dig into all the Rachel options with Samuel, but then he kind of starts to get offended, so then you rewind and he once more thinks you are a trustworthy young student who wouldn't ever think of snooping.   I never want to leave anyone with the impression that i'm digging into their business, or looking into Rachel's dissapearance. Or give Nathan the impression that i'm asking around about him either. My Max is a sneaky bitch! ;)"

lifeisstrange,3bh0vi,FilmingMachine,5,Mon Jun 29 13:13:29 2015 UTC,"Despite this decision being relatively unimportant, I can understand why they made it so. Earlier in conversation with officer Anderson Berry, he explicitly states the dog posing as a danger, being a bodyguard for Frank Bowers. It is implied that in taking his gun away (after going in his RV) and killing the dog, heartless as it sounds, Frank (who obviously has a connection between Rachael Amber-and seems more than capable of endangering characters) no longer poses as a threat in possible upcoming episodes, which is why I made the decision to kill the dog.  However in Max's remorse over the dog (repeated multiple times in RV), I re-winded my decision and chose not to kill the dog as it doesn't suit her personality, so I guess I'm not as much of a  hopeless bastard as I make myself to be :3"
lifeisstrange,3bh0vi,AdriaaaaaaaaaN,2,Mon Jun 29 08:45:57 2015 UTC,Great answer. I don't know either how I should feel about in this point and click games like telltale... I don't know why but I always act like the character would and without being a total dick even though that is not what I would pick if that was me... Is there a proper way to play these games? Should we pick as if we were the main character or as the existent personality in the character (if that makes any sense). In games like fallout because we have no idea what kind of person the guy we are playing as is we pick (at least me) as we would... I donno man.. What do you think?
lifeisstrange,3bh0vi,FilmingMachine,8,Mon Jun 29 13:22:14 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I think that's what makes these games great - they free us to make the ""personal"" choice rather than playing the metagame. There's no right or wrong choices and thus you're free to play it in whatever way seems most appropriate. Personally, I like to become the character - especially in LiS, as I really relate to Max - and act as I believe the would. Early on I tried to just be a good person, but as Max is fleshed out I got to get a feeling for how she would act... and I got to get a feel for how she was growing as a person, as well, and make decisions to guide that growth.   However, others prefer to play as themselves and impose their decisions on the main character, which is absolutely 100% valid. It's all a choice."

lifeisstrange,3bh0vi,CMCyantist,1 point,Mon Jun 29 07:32:42 2015 UTC,Well if you throw it in the parking lot you don't kill him and at the end of the scene as Max and Chloe drive off his dog barks at them and Frank notices them.  It doesn't happen if you kill it.

I thought if it lived it could attack us as we were leaving the RV or it could alert Frank. Also people say its a really aggressive dog so it will eventually hurt someone. Although I decided to keep the dog alive because I don't think those risks are enough reason to kill him. That was just my thought process during that part of the game. There are other reasons for killing the dog too but you only see them if you do it, like Frank wont see Max and Chloe leaving the diner but he will if the dog lives."

lifeisstrange,3bgrx5,GingerWoolfe,7,Mon Jun 29 02:17:50 2015 UTC,'Siding with David' is really just 'Chloe calm down he might not be entirely crazy...'. Which seemed legit to me.
lifeisstrange,3bgrx5,BobMugabe35,6,Mon Jun 29 15:54:03 2015 UTC,"Chloe gets pissed off at you, and David and Joyce tell Max that they're grateful for sticking up for him."
lifeisstrange,3bgrx5,T_Snake451,5,Mon Jun 29 03:07:36 2015 UTC,"If you side with David, Chloe will then ask Max to take a dump together. Funniest moment in the episode :)"
lifeisstrange,3bgrx5,aripermantap,3,Mon Jun 29 12:25:16 2015 UTC,"Chloe gets mad, the family is not broken."
lifeisstrange,3bgrx5,Tyranniac,6,Mon Jun 29 07:28:28 2015 UTC,"Which, I don't like. David is truly an ass for spying on everyone. He earned this by himself. Get a hobby, dude!"
lifeisstrange,3bgrx5,FFaUniHan,4,Mon Jun 29 04:14:37 2015 UTC,I didn't even bother giving the option a go and rewinding.  Fuck that guy.
lifeisstrange,3bgrx5,CMCyantist,2,Mon Jun 29 07:40:39 2015 UTC,Actually you settle everything down if you side with David and nothing hurtful to their marriage happens.
lifeisstrange,3bgrx5,Ara-Player,2,Mon Jun 29 21:28:26 2015 UTC,"He spies on his family, that marriage can't end fast enough."
lifeisstrange,3bgrx5,The-Irish-Potato,2,Mon Jun 29 22:37:48 2015 UTC,"Basically it's Max starting a fight with David, Chloe backs her up and then you're like ""oh sorry Chloe sucks to be you, don't worry David i got your back""."
lifeisstrange,3bgrx5,gybali,2,Mon Jun 29 10:19:47 2015 UTC,Siding with David is not tearing into Chloe like you tear into David if you side with Chloe. You settle the argument down and the marriage doesn't get split. That's why me and 20% of other people sided with David.
lifeisstrange,3bgrx5,Ara-Player,2,Mon Jun 29 21:28:00 2015 UTC,"Its established by their bills that Chloe's family can't meet their financial obligations. Getting David kicked out of the house, I imagined, wouldn't help their situation. As much as it'd be fun to see David get his, keeping their family together was more important to me.  Chloe is also an unreasonable character although not to the same extent as David. This is one of the few opportunities so far that you can tell her to calm down.   David wrote up a birthday card that was never delivered for Chloe's 18th birthday thanking her for welcoming him into the family. Chloe never did that and as poor of a father figure as David is, Chloe is an equally poor daughter figure."
lifeisstrange,3bgrx5,Galentine,2,Mon Jun 29 21:43:50 2015 UTC,"I was conflicted on this one. I ended up siding with Chloe, because so far David is squarely in the, ""characters I feel like I shouldn't completely hate but are still complete douchebags"" category, but I feel like we're going to find out there's more to him than we know. Like he might be trying to do something good we don't know about, and just going about it the wrong, WRONG way."
lifeisstrange,3bgrx5,Game_Professor,5,Mon Jun 29 22:24:38 2015 UTC,"I just couldn't bring myself to stick up for him, no matter how many playthroughs I do. On most games, I usually try playing through multiple routes, even if the choices are hard, but this.. No. I just can't do it.   David is such a step-fucker. Seriously. He brought this upon himself, and not only that, but some of the shit he says to you after you save Kate, or even when you hide from him in Chloe's room. Screw that guy. He's hella crazy."

The ""Luke, I am your father"" ending of Remember Me doesn't inspire confidence though.  Loved the game,  but it deserved better."
lifeisstrange,3bgbih,GrayManTheory,4,Mon Jun 29 01:30:38 2015 UTC,"Yeah I agree. I cannot picture Max and Chloe together being in the state Chloe is in (wheelchair bound). Max will feel remorse for Chloe after which she will go back in time [via the photograph she took in episode one-either the selfie in class or the one of the butterfly and the bucket-and thus possibly letting Chloe die as it is implied she symbolizes the impending chaos of the disasters happening (with symbology of the totems, repeating uses of bluejays)]. There is a common theme of not messing with time even if given the capabilities of doing so as seen in such time travel based movies and games (i.e. Years Walk, The Girl who leapt through time-main message:Don't fuck with time). So yeah in this way I agree that Max will go back to episode one and just let Chloe die, out of better judgement and lesson learnt not to mess with time, against one's wills. OR perhaps this could happen and she lets her live and thus Max is living in a closed room and is stuck in time-which Max fears (Similarly as implied in Rachael-Nathan writes that she's stuck in the dark room)."
lifeisstrange,3bgbih,AdriaaaaaaaaaN,2,Mon Jun 29 09:00:24 2015 UTC,"I hope they do something smarter than that. I mean come on, our choices would mean nothing if that happens."
lifeisstrange,3bgbih,EpicSalmon,1 point,Tue Jun 30 02:39:37 2015 UTC,People keep saying this on the ending of episode 3. Everyone must take DONTNOD for idiots. What kind of person would do that?   Anyway if they are doing that and make a season 2 with the same characters (they won't) they will use the choices we made and Max will repeat them but this time she will stop the tornado instead of the endless loop then the new plot begins.
lifeisstrange,3bgbih,AERXihu,1 point,Tue Jun 30 07:33:18 2015 UTC,"Could you take a picture for me? I'm not in my PC right now. Of EP4 if you could too, I'd be happy. But why not? I think she will want to go back, everyone wants. Since you talked about the EP1 ripped photo... so we could say she will go back to that and...? Play the whole game again? Or she will get back in time, and don't let the butterfly beat the wings then don't have the hurricane?"
lifeisstrange,3bgbih,Frajolex,1 point,Mon Jun 29 00:11:31 2015 UTC,"Yeah, something like that  But now that you mentioned it... I forgot that photo was from the very start of EP 1, so if she really goes back to the very start, that is going to suck  And here's a direct link to the picture, if that's what you need: http://i.imgur.com/zD64qJk.jpg"
lifeisstrange,3bgbih,Frajolex,2,Mon Jun 29 00:22:04 2015 UTC,"This could be she looking at the ""new"" pictures there. Or trying to find one to go back in time again?

I tried research but nothing big, just a thought of ""She will re-do everything again"" I think she will try get those archives (the second photo) to know how is each person as well.. Dude I'm hyped"
lifeisstrange,3bgbih,Frajolex,1 point,Mon Jun 29 00:29:38 2015 UTC,"That makes sense, she could be trying to find a photo to go back in time again. Thank you for adding stuff to this theory lol"
lifeisstrange,3bgbih,netnem,1 point,Mon Jun 29 00:33:32 2015 UTC,"and tbh I think the EP4 will be pretty rad. I think they could use atoms theory there. Like Schrodinger Cat. It will be dark, until you see many stuff could happen And Polarized. The EP1 were Chrysalys and were about the thing a butterfly is between larva and butterfly transition. Out of time is about Chloe in the trains, and Caos Theory.. well. We could agree that saving someone's life isn't something ""small"" is it? But still, something ""small"" made a big catasthrophy (sorry for the bad english eee) Then Dark room as I said before, could be the atoms theory, if you don't see they are doing more than one thing at same time. And Polarized. Max uses a polaroid, and it could be something as ""locked in a polaroid photo""? As like that Rachel infinite loop? Or my fav she take pictures and use that power from EP3 and jump into different lines. Different alternatives. So she can get information and go to the original one and fix everything!!! god this game is so nice"
lifeisstrange,3bgbih,Frajolex,2,Mon Jun 29 00:50:46 2015 UTC,"What I think each title means:  Chrysalis - The chrysalis is where the caterpillar turn into a butterfly, right? So I guess that means Max discovering her power. She transformed from just another person to someone with an amazing power, just like a caterpillar turning into a butterfly  Out Of Time - Not sure, but maybe it is how Max ""ran out"" of her power, so she had to save Kate by herself? Showing her that she can't rely on her power and that she needs to be able to do the bigger stuff by herself (and also about almost running out of time to save Chloe, so Max had to keep rewinding)  Chaos Thoery - You are right about this one. Small things (not so small, but still) make a big difference  Dark Room - The darkroom is the place where pictures from the camera are made into the paper (not sure how to explain that), so maybe things will be revealed in EP 4, just like seeing a photo for the first time in a darkroom?  Polarized - No idea what polarized means. It's something else besides Polaroid though. I think it have something to do with physics"
lifeisstrange,3bgbih,Frajolex,3,Mon Jun 29 01:03:07 2015 UTC,"Polarized also a term used in photography.  For example a ""polarized lens filter"" (CPL). Also in sunglasses and whatnot.  In photography polarized lens can be used to ""see through"" reflections, by removing polarized light.  Another side effect is more colorful (deeper) blue skies and foliage on trees (again by removing the reflections on leaves, etc), so it could be a reference to seeing things in a much deeper sense or could be a reference of ""cutting through"" something (perhaps seeing people's true colors).  In regards to physics, it's usually referred to having the positive and negative things separated."

One the rewind, it's rewinding short periods of time without ""any"" consequences.  The other one is the photo-staring one. She can travel back longer periods 5 years for example, but she can't move completely free only inside the photographic boundaries.  It's possible that she rewound 4-5 days when she was almost crushed by the lighthouse and it would probably have more consequences like forgetting the whole time period she was traveling back, that would include her powers too, cause she traveled back before she got them (if she knew about it at all)."
lifeisstrange,3bgjuz,gybali,3,Mon Jun 29 10:33:25 2015 UTC,"I get what you say. To me the original timeline is with chloe dying by the shot of Nathan, and going on. No ""going back and changing the future"". But... oh. Sometimes I think Max has much on her head (much information) and she couldn't handle that much if keep time traveling. Then could somehow erase it and she doesn't get mad... Or I don't know, to me, Rachel needs to appear to make more stuff clear."
lifeisstrange,3bgjuz,Frajolex,2,Mon Jun 29 01:22:49 2015 UTC,"Yeah, there's a lot of stuff that needs to actually happen to clear up all of it, finding Rachel/what happened to her is actually a major point obviously"

lifeisstrange,3bf4ta,Alpaca10,11,Sun Jun 28 17:43:51 2015 UTC,"Wait, Max can get suspended? Wtf? How? Now I have a new goal in this game"
lifeisstrange,3bf4ta,Mxpxrocks2,8,Sun Jun 28 21:12:13 2015 UTC,"If you choose not to tell the principal in the beginning then blame Nathan, then you get suspended."
lifeisstrange,3bf4ta,Ilan321,7,Sun Jun 28 21:46:43 2015 UTC,It depends on if you took the blame for the weed or not as well. If you didn't tell the principal and blamed Nathan but didn't take the blame for the weed you wouldn't get suspended. If you took the blame you would get suspended (under those circumstances).
lifeisstrange,3bf4ta,AtlasCat,3,Mon Jun 29 04:22:13 2015 UTC,"Basically, if you do everything possible to make Chloe happy, you get suspended."
lifeisstrange,3bf4ta,Dear_Occupant,1 point,Tue Jun 30 21:46:02 2015 UTC,Haha yeah :')
lifeisstrange,3bf4ta,AtlasCat,4,Sun Jul 5 00:56:01 2015 UTC,"Here's a helpful flowchart. It explains the choices necessary for a character to be suspended, although it doesn't include Jefferson because the result is always the same for him (as of now)."
lifeisstrange,3bf4ta,RasereiHojo,1 point,Mon Jun 29 06:10:45 2015 UTC,(as of now)   What do you mean? :)
lifeisstrange,3bf4ta,FilmingMachine,1 point,Mon Jun 29 13:44:51 2015 UTC,"Only that for now, the only consequence we know is that Jefferson is removed from the Everyday Hero Contest, but there could be other implications down the road that we don't know yet."
lifeisstrange,3bf4ta,RasereiHojo,1 point,Mon Jun 29 15:49:23 2015 UTC,Oh.. Ty.
lifeisstrange,3bf4ta,FilmingMachine,3,Mon Jun 29 16:10:50 2015 UTC,"And I think if you let Kate die.  At least all the ""Max Suspended"" endings I saw had the following choices:   Don't tell Pr Wells about gun Let Kate die Blame Nathan   He'll think Max is lying and suspend her."
lifeisstrange,3bf4ta,TheNathanNS,2,Sun Jun 28 22:02:15 2015 UTC,Kate can't die :(
lifeisstrange,3bf4ta,Ilan321,1 point,Mon Jun 29 07:37:18 2015 UTC,"Oh, she died so many times on my watch... I guess I am not that good of a person for not being able to save her so many times."
lifeisstrange,3bf4ta,FilmingMachine,1 point,Mon Jun 29 13:42:34 2015 UTC,I've never let Kate die and I've gotten Max suspended. You also have to take the blame for the weed. Then Madsen pipes up and you get tossed.
lifeisstrange,3bf4ta,Dear_Occupant,3,Tue Jun 30 21:47:08 2015 UTC,"I am not sure if it changes too much, but Chloe seems to think you're pretty cool for having been suspended."
lifeisstrange,3bf4ta,Reavens,3,Sun Jun 28 21:52:07 2015 UTC,She also think it's cool to steal handicap funds. Karma is a bitch.

lifeisstrange,3bf4ta,FilmingMachine,2,Mon Jun 29 13:45:49 2015 UTC,Here's a helpful tree of choices.
lifeisstrange,3bf4ta,RasereiHojo,-2,Mon Jun 29 01:36:51 2015 UTC,"I think you got it wrong.  1) If Max blame David, didn't take the photo, and she takes the blame for Chloe ==> David will bring in joint into the discussion. So, Max get suspended  2) If you hide the truth, and blame Nathan, you got suspended  Poor Mr. Jefferson. He's the black sheep in this game if you don't want to be suspended, but you can't blame Nathan or David."
lifeisstrange,3bf4ta,FFaUniHan,1 point,Mon Jun 29 04:16:10 2015 UTC,"For reference, I didn't make the flowchart, but:  1) Yes, that's true but it depends on whether or not you tell the principal about Nathan in episode 1. There are two branches obviously, depending on whether or not you tell the principal:  Blame Nathan -> Intervene -> Take blame for Chloe -> Blame David -> Max suspended.  Hide Truth -> Intervene -> Take blame for Chloe -> Blame David -> No action against anyone  2) Again, that's not necessarily true. That depends on whether or not you take the blame for Chloe or took the photo. There are four branches for this path, so it would be either:  Hide truth -> Take photo -> Take blame for Chloe -> Blame Nathan -> Max suspended  Hide truth -> Take photo -> Don't take blame for Chloe -> Blame Nathan -> Nathan suspended  Hide truth -> Intervene -> Take blame for Chloe -> Blame Nathan -> Max suspended  Hide truth -> Intervene -> Don't take blame for Chloe -> Nathan suspended  There are only 3 ways to get suspended out of 24 ways, since Jefferson isn't included in the flowchart (as blaming him always results in the same outcome, at least for now)."
lifeisstrange,3bf4ta,RasereiHojo,1 point,Mon Jun 29 06:06:22 2015 UTC,"I had that option too, but rewound and chose something different. But now I'm curious, how does Max being suspended work out in Episode 3, when Max goes to class?"
lifeisstrange,3bf4ta,plurbine,1 point,Sun Jun 28 18:32:37 2015 UTC,She never goes to class in ep3 lol. Have you played it?
lifeisstrange,3bf4ta,Ara-Player,1 point,Sun Jun 28 19:04:31 2015 UTC,Hah! Nvm. I was still thinking about Episode 2.
lifeisstrange,3befxy,WanderIntoWonder,8,Sun Jun 28 13:39:22 2015 UTC,Max! Never Maxine!
lifeisstrange,3befxy,Jessie246,9,Sun Jun 28 18:08:58 2015 UTC,"I dont like this, they will give us just new character that will discover that he have these powers but we all already saw this, our character will be like ""wow what is meaning of this"" but we all know because we played LiS 1 and been there with Max. And that will really disconect you from main protagonist. Also 50% of success generated by this game is by Max and Chloe, without them... I dont know... I hope they will change mind or rather do something new. Rather no LiS 2 than same thing but with somebody else."
lifeisstrange,3befxy,TAGsvk,8,Sun Jun 28 14:16:10 2015 UTC,"How about this: scrap the whole time-traveling power altogether.  You can still have the same art style, music, and themes, but it could take place in a totally different universe (to preserve continuity), and give a new character a new power."
lifeisstrange,3befxy,phraps,1 point,Sun Jun 28 19:46:46 2015 UTC,Why does it have to involve time traveling?
lifeisstrange,3befxy,Jonoftherocks,1 point,Sun Jun 28 21:01:32 2015 UTC,"Season 2 doesn't have to be about time travel. If anything, it'll be about something supernatural.  Also, the devs are fom France, hopefully they'll change the location to Europe for S2."
lifeisstrange,3befxy,keepcomingbackmanila,1 point,Sun Jul 5 15:29:00 2015 UTC,"IDK I thought the time-travel worked really well as a storytelling mechanic. It took some of the stress and frustration out of adventure gaming, where you have to constantly agonize over whether your dialogue choice will go in a bad direction.  You also learn a lot about a character by seeing how they react differently to different choices. I.E. Victoria comfort vs. take a picture.  I can't think of a new power that would actually help tell the story in the same way."
lifeisstrange,3befxy,lislislislislis,-2,Mon Jun 29 01:24:19 2015 UTC,I know right! Like fuck just set it Seattle with Max and Chloe if you want a new cast members that bad.
lifeisstrange,3befxy,dragsaw,3,Sun Jun 28 16:27:16 2015 UTC,I'm a bit skeptical as well. Not that I don't want more... I LOVE what we have so far and I'm sad that it will end soon. But if its the same mechanic with different people... it will be hard to be as successful since the novelty is gone.
lifeisstrange,3befxy,978am,2,Sun Jun 28 15:22:29 2015 UTC,A quick thought I had on reading that: What if we focus on Rachel in the second season? I guess technically she wouldn't be a 'new' character but she's not there with the main characters right now and all we know about her is what Max has been told by people who knew her. If the second season focused on her and she'd left of her own accord then that would give us reason for a whole new cast of characters plus seeing some old ones near the end.
lifeisstrange,3befxy,theknightinthetardis,2,Sun Jun 28 15:10:22 2015 UTC,"I don't know, I think it could work. It obviously wouldn't have the same drive behind it because as others have said, the novelty wouldn't be there, but it could be neat. A teen somewhere else discovers they can read minds, hears a threat and has to stop it, or something to that effect (cliche, but just an example). Maybe word gets out about Arcadia Bay and we can still get cameos from one or both (possibly depending on how Max and Chloe's story ends) if a new character were to go try to get answers about a story they heard?  Although I admit, a part of me wants a spin off with one of the other characters in Arcadia Bay.  Namely, I want Kate to get badass powers, but unless she's alive in a new timeline and it's made canon, there could be some continuity issues there."
lifeisstrange,3befxy,eridactylsaurus,1 point,Sun Jun 28 17:11:52 2015 UTC,"I second playable Kate. Though might be risky because she's so in to Christianity.  Also fuck the choices, she can canonically be alive. Although, playable Victoria could be interesting as well."
lifeisstrange,3befxy,BrookieTF,2,Mon Jun 29 05:18:11 2015 UTC,If it's gonna be entirely new story and setting then I'd rather if they just make a new IP.

lifeisstrange,3befxy,BabyLettuce,1 point,Sun Jun 28 13:45:06 2015 UTC,It'd be better if they stuck with Max and Chloe and they just helped other people. maybe someone else gets the rewind power and fucks themselves up and Max has to help? Or maybe Max and Chloe help find missing people/solve murders/anything as long as it involves Max and Chloe
lifeisstrange,3befxy,wolfmarelalala,1 point,Mon Jun 29 02:52:31 2015 UTC,"Actually I think the Remember Me universe and Nillin has more potential to dig.I like LIS better,but it seems Max and Chloe's story can be quite completed within one season.Without these familiar characters,I kinda doubt how much charm they can give to this ""not that mysterious anymore"" universe."
lifeisstrange,3befxy,FFaUniHan,1 point,Mon Jun 29 03:03:14 2015 UTC,What if they just make a prequel of it? I guess that'll complete the story.  Or a sequel? It's like time-travelling power wouldn't cause any second disaster... Ideas?

lifeisstrange,3be214,SkateboardCop,1 point,Sun Jun 28 15:38:27 2015 UTC,"But you rewind time, so that it will be uneaten. Eeww what a bad mental image.   Wouldn't Joyce notice that the food is gone?"
lifeisstrange,3be214,alexhasacamera,1 point,Sun Jun 28 15:42:14 2015 UTC,"When you pick something else up it doesn't reappear when you rewind since it now travels with Max in her little time proof bubble.

lifeisstrange,3be214,alexhasacamera,2,Sun Jun 28 15:58:41 2015 UTC,"Not that one, but I had a floating crowbar in the next scene once. There are a lot of bugs in the game that show up occasionally and force you to restart a scene, but in my 30ish or so hours playing the game I've only ever had to do that twice so far."

lifeisstrange,3be214,Fallen_Legends,1 point,Sun Jun 28 10:47:49 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I also didn't encounter that one, but a few others. I guess these type of bugs occur when you only partially rewind an event.   In EP1 I managed to get stuck in Chloe's closet after rewinding the confrontation with David. When the rest of the scene played out, the game treated Max as if she didn't hide at all. At the end of EP1 when Max is in the tornado sequence and you have to rewind so the top of the lighthouse doesn't roll over you, I managed to get hit by it and reach the last checkpoint simultaneously. During the final few cutscenes with Chloe, Max' voiceclips when she can't rewind any further were playing every few seconds. And the bug encountered by /u/Fallen_Legends in EP2   After those bugs I decided to not manually rewind anymore and just press Ctrl to rewind my last action."
lifeisstrange,3be214,Cloudshaped,1 point,Sun Jun 28 12:01:00 2015 UTC,"The bottle stayed smashed for me too on my first play through there. I have also had a few glitches where it won't stop rewinding when I tell it to, so I end up in a slow moving, distorted world, and I can't rewind or fast forward. I usually have to reload the game."
lifeisstrange,3be214,eridactylsaurus,1 point,Sun Jun 28 16:58:49 2015 UTC,"Those bugs are funny. Sometimes after rewinding major choices, the whole universe freezes like time has stopped."

Just kinda levitating like it dropped but didn't break, and there's no action icon on top of the refrigerator to take it, so basically you can't move on.   It's a major bug, reloading the checkpoint is a temporary fix, but not a permanent one."

Personally, I hope they delve more into why she apparently didn't keep up contact with Chloe at all, and maybe have an ending where she goes back and somehow sets up a way that'll guarantee they keep in touch. Even a long-distance friendship would've probably saved Chloe from the worst of her downward spiral."

Because you fear that it will never be same, you would slowly starting to ""dont know"" each other and friendship would start fadding away. Rather stop in that best moments. But still as I said there is probably more into this because there is big potencial for writters for some ""revelations"""
lifeisstrange,3bctb0,Agent_Alpha,1 point,Sun Jun 28 00:53:21 2015 UTC,it was her decision remember?
lifeisstrange,3bctb0,yarfmeister,3,Sun Jun 28 02:50:08 2015 UTC,It sounds like it a straightforward way for EP4 and 5 to go. But we know that Dontnod have surprised us before. coughEP3endingcough
lifeisstrange,3bctb0,978am,1 point,Sun Jun 28 16:26:06 2015 UTC,"I'd rather see more of what Max's life was like in Seattle and explore her reasons (or the actual cause, in any case) for not calling Chloe."
lifeisstrange,3bctb0,eridactylsaurus,1 point,Sun Jun 28 08:51:17 2015 UTC,"It would be an interesting twist if Max can't go back to the ""original"" timeline and instead had to keep going back. As far as we know, she can only rewind time, not go forward. If that does happen, I wouldn't be surprised if she goes further back and attempts to stay in Arcadia Bay from the start."
lifeisstrange,3bctb0,Yorien,1 point,Sun Jun 28 13:48:12 2015 UTC,"I hope for a resolution within the timeline we've grown to know, even if the consequences are dire. That will still feel more satisfying than a reset, which is a trope that really annoys me in stories/shows/books/movies I've invested myself in."
lifeisstrange,3bb9vk,sardonictaunts,15,Sat Jun 27 15:55:31 2015 UTC,Can't agree more. Dontnod are BY FAR my favourite developers.  They have proved they can make a truly perfect game.
lifeisstrange,3bb9vk,HelloCringle,9,Sat Jun 27 16:33:54 2015 UTC,"Even Remember Me, which was far from perfect, was brimming with love, and passion.  I'm hella jazzed for Vampyr. I hope they make hella cash on it."
lifeisstrange,3bb9vk,transfo47,6,Sat Jun 27 16:45:50 2015 UTC,Hella right.
lifeisstrange,3bb9vk,samhocevar,13,Sat Jun 27 17:25:27 2015 UTC,<3
lifeisstrange,3bb9vk,yarfmeister,11,Sat Jun 27 20:50:50 2015 UTC,"I love LiS, but I really can't say that they're one of my favorite developers. LiS is the only game I've played by them. I missed Remember Me, and I have yet to look up Vampyr and see what all the fuss is about. I'm hopeful though. They've proven that they actually care about their games."
lifeisstrange,3bb9vk,Mound0,2,Sat Jun 27 22:45:49 2015 UTC,Try Remember Me! At the very least you'll have fun looking at things and listening to the fantastic soundtrack.
lifeisstrange,3bb9vk,IFE-Antler-Boy,5,Mon Jun 29 04:27:21 2015 UTC,Agreed. Obsidian make great games. <3
lifeisstrange,3bb9vk,NotMeeh,4,Sat Jun 27 17:41:52 2015 UTC,"Obsidian rocks my socks. If Knights of the Old Republic II got the time it deserved, it would probably be my favorite game ever. The same could be said of all their games tbh"
lifeisstrange,3bb9vk,fireTwoOneNine,4,Sat Jun 27 19:01:26 2015 UTC,For me Squad (KerbalSpaceProgram) is just a tiny bit higher than Dontnod. I think both studios (and games) have somthing in common but I can't tell what is it exactly.   Maybe because people on both subreddits are lovely
lifeisstrange,3bb9vk,haXona,2,Sun Jun 28 01:56:06 2015 UTC,Both are (relatively) small dev teams who really seem to care about the communities around their games. Both are also just awesome in general.
lifeisstrange,3bb9vk,elmerion,8,Sat Jun 27 21:07:34 2015 UTC,I cant wait to see what they do with Vampyr  Just a taste to let you know how they can evolve and actually apply their skills to different genres/games then just look at their logos!  Logos tell a lot about a company so to see this is pretty great
lifeisstrange,3bb9vk,IFE-Antler-Boy,3,Sun Jun 28 16:28:15 2015 UTC,"I used to be very much agains't making cinematic experience out of videogames but holy fuck life strange does it in such a smooth way that it makes the experience absolutely enjoyable. I feel like i could play this game a thousand times and learn a different thing everytime, relating to all the characters in a different way, constantly reading and overall exploring Arcadia  I just started playing Remember Me and thus far im getting the same feeling (the combat is mediocre though)"
lifeisstrange,3bb9vk,mahiro,3,Sat Jun 27 18:25:15 2015 UTC,"I'm partial to Bethesda and Kojima Productions meself. Fallout 3 and the Metal Gear Solid remake for the GameCube were the games that really got me into gaming. So nostaliga, I guess haha."
lifeisstrange,3bb9vk,EcoleBuissonniere,3,Sun Jun 28 00:44:28 2015 UTC,"I do have a slight gripe with Naughty Dog for not buying back rights/making more of Crash Bandicoot, damn I miss the original marsupial"
lifeisstrange,3bb9vk,elmerion,5,Sun Jun 28 01:58:16 2015 UTC,"Remember Me was flawed, but it was brimming with great ideas, a lot of inventiveness and a real unique charm. I loved it. Life is Strange is my second favourite game of all time. Yeah, I love Dontnod. They're right up there with Telltale and Obsidian for me."
lifeisstrange,3bb9vk,Desillusio,4,Sun Jun 28 02:51:08 2015 UTC,"The problem with Remember Me is that the combat and plataforming sequences feel liek shit you do to keep going with the story, they don't feel challenging, or fun in anyway. The memory editing is were the game shines, and just walking aroudn the city listening to people and checking the walls to see what little things Dontnod hid is just an enjoyable experience"
lifeisstrange,3bccnb,Alpaca10,6,Sat Jun 27 21:42:16 2015 UTC,Had that happen to me while I was enjoying the bedroom scene in episode 3... :(
lifeisstrange,3bccnb,Snodog627,19,Sat Jun 27 22:09:11 2015 UTC,"The exact same thing happened to me. I was all like, ""WE'RE HAVING A MOMENT, GAME."""
lifeisstrange,3bccnb,yarfmeister,6,Sat Jun 27 22:50:08 2015 UTC,"I loved that scene, I didn't even realize I could skip it! I was just enjoying chloe's company, and the music..completely immersed in this beautiful world."
lifeisstrange,3bccnb,EpicSalmon,2,Sun Jun 28 11:32:20 2015 UTC,I've replayed the game maybe 5 times and never get up before the song is through. Perfection.
lifeisstrange,3bccnb,SnobbyLion,5,Tue Jun 30 19:50:02 2015 UTC,Is it on PC? Because never happened to me.
lifeisstrange,3bccnb,alexhasacamera,4,Sun Jun 28 02:31:37 2015 UTC,"Wait woot, i listened to the guitar segment for around 10mins while makinga sandwich in the kitchen the first time I played EP.1"
lifeisstrange,3bccnb,haXona,3,Sat Jun 27 23:21:37 2015 UTC,"If you're playing on a console, it could be because you have your controller set to turn off after a certain amount of time with no input. Lots of games do that."
lifeisstrange,3bc3b5,Sabrewylf,10,Sat Jun 27 20:16:28 2015 UTC,"totally different game with similar rewind mechanic at particular points throughout the story. good for batman arkham style fighting, linear maps, and action scenes. definitely not the same, but i for one enjoyed Remember Me, even when reviews didn't."
lifeisstrange,3bc3b5,theartemisfowl,7,Sat Jun 27 20:29:13 2015 UTC,"Remember Me is a third person brawler, (think like the recent Batman Arkham games) set in a futuristic Paris. You build combos (out of three styles, strong attacks, regain special ability, and restore health) and the levels are linear but just drop dead gorgeous, almost the entire game is screenshot worthy (especially if you play on PC with supersampling). The most interesting mechanic is the ""memory remixing"" which you can tell is the inspiration for Life is Strange. Basically you have to modify peoples memories and trick them into thinking something else has happened.  If you can find it cheap or get it free from PS Plus or something it's worth it."
lifeisstrange,3bc3b5,SkateboardCop,3,Sat Jun 27 20:38:19 2015 UTC,"THIS!  Also the game is drop dead the most beautiful game design-wise that I have played on PC(Max everything with Super sampling makes this game look like a masterpiece)  Here is an example(current background)  I really think its worth more than just a 10 bucks, I got around 30$ worth of entertainment from it and if we are gonna compare to usual standards of todays 60$ game(Destiny, Cod etc) this is totally worth 60 bucks for me"
lifeisstrange,3bc3b5,haXona,4,Sun Jun 28 02:04:05 2015 UTC,"Beautiful game i bought it a month or so ago when it was on sale on Steam.  I thought it was fun. Also bought the ""art of remember me"" book because it was so gorgeous i couldnt help it.  EDIT: to be clear, if i had to pay full price for it i would. its worth it imho"
lifeisstrange,3bc3b5,GenHawke,3,Sun Jun 28 05:46:05 2015 UTC,"One of my favourite games of all time. The art, setting, and soundtrack are all beautiful. Gameplay is a mix of combat, puzzles, and platforming, with a lot of simply walking around and admiring the eye candy too. Really shows that Dontnod are not your average developer churning out yet another run-of-the-mill mediocre shooter game or somesuch. Whatever the ""reviewers"" say, you can't deny that RM is completely original and full of fantastic new ideas."
lifeisstrange,3bc3b5,HelmutVillam,2,Sun Jun 28 01:53:46 2015 UTC,"Beautifully detailed Neo-Parisian world, good graphics, semi-boring protagonist, good yet repetitive combat. Voice acting is great in parts and questionable in others. Definitely worth the £8/$9 pre-owned PS3 or XBOX 360 copy from Game(UK) and and Gamestop(US) but if you're thinking of getting it on PC then I'd wait for the Steam Winter Sale at the end of the year for the 75 - 80% discount cause it's not worth the price on there. This is coming from someone who played it the day it came out :) If you can get it for £10/$15 or less then I'd definitely get it just for the setting if nothing else"
lifeisstrange,3bc3b5,BabyLettuce,1 point,Sat Jun 27 22:25:04 2015 UTC,"Different,but they do share some same good points.Great art design and music,interesting setting and story，charming female protagonist，rich environment(especially graffiti) messages etc  They are of totally different styles and types，both gameplay and story.But they do focus on the same fields"
lifeisstrange,3bc3b5,wolfmarelalala,1 point,Mon Jun 29 03:19:54 2015 UTC,"Great art design, so-so game. It's fairly short (completed in <10h) so it can be fun in a rainy week when there's a steam sale I guess."

lifeisstrange,3barak,978am,8,Sat Jun 27 15:41:29 2015 UTC,It wouldn't surprise me. Chloe literally says how she wants to destroy Arcadia
lifeisstrange,3barak,NotMeeh,5,Sat Jun 27 18:21:58 2015 UTC,"But doesn't she later say that she didn't mean it? I can't remember the exact words but she does back down on that statement IIRC.   Edit: Found it, its when they lie in bed in EP3."
lifeisstrange,3barak,vince94_1,6,Sun Jun 28 12:16:42 2015 UTC,I like this theory but Rachel could be the one causing trouble in Arcadia Bay. She maybe found out what is happening in Blackwell (those creepy photo albums) and ran away wanting to destroy Arcadia Bay.  But I also like the idea of Chloe having powers and just not knowing it. And accidently using them.
lifeisstrange,3barak,Sabrewylf,8,Sat Jun 27 20:50:37 2015 UTC,"I think that the weird weather is caused by Max making things better with her power, and the universe having to balance things out."

lifeisstrange,3barak,sdrawkcaBrad,4,Sat Jun 27 19:01:54 2015 UTC,"I also had a thought about it being a Final Destination type thing, where a certain number of people/animals are supposed to die, and Max is over there messing up the numbers. So it gets more extreme.  I mean, key points of the story are saving Chloe twice, whether Kate lives, if you kill your plant, if you let the bird die, if you hurt dogs, and warn homeless people, and more recently you save Chloe's dad. Max influences a lot of deaths."
lifeisstrange,3barak,Jessie246,5,Sat Jun 27 18:47:34 2015 UTC,What's this about birds and homeless people?
lifeisstrange,3barak,Nytra,4,Sat Jun 27 19:01:03 2015 UTC,"There's a bird you can save in chapter one, and a homeless lady you can warn about the coming storm in chapter three."
lifeisstrange,3barak,indighoul,4,Sat Jun 27 19:02:42 2015 UTC,"Great theory.  My thoughts are that the storm might be in the next episode, you know, in the saved dad universe."

lifeisstrange,3bazvk,chattypenguin,1 point,Sun Jun 28 01:56:23 2015 UTC,"No, but there's the theorie that something or someone either takes possesion of or imitates people. People see this as an explanation why EP3 SPOILERS The root of this idea comes from Twin Peaks, where the killer was indeed a spirit, that possessed and controlled other people. Why the theorie actually speaks of skinwalkers, I have no idea. I used to think that skinwalkers were humans, that can take the form of animals, not other humans..."
lifeisstrange,3bazvk,Big_G_Dog,1 point,Sun Jun 28 11:09:28 2015 UTC,That pic of Rachel also had that mouth breathing facial expression thing only Max does. Where her teeth are sticking out. If the skin walker theory is right then that pic of Kate might actually be Max covering up her face.
lifeisstrange,3bazvk,AwkwardMassEffectFan,6,Sun Jun 28 17:47:14 2015 UTC,"I think the second photo looked pretty suspicious, looks like she is taking some pill, anyone else think this?"

lifeisstrange,3bazvk,Big_G_Dog,6,Sat Jun 27 18:24:37 2015 UTC,"Oh wow, I never even thought about that. That makes sense since pills are the Vortex Club's drug of choice. But poor Kate could be taking ibuprofen, who knows"

lifeisstrange,3bazvk,chattypenguin,6,Sat Jun 27 14:54:05 2015 UTC,I wish we could break into Kate's room and really look around...so nosy
lifeisstrange,3bazvk,SkateboardCop,3,Sat Jun 27 15:04:43 2015 UTC,I love kate and I doubt she would do this but if she is taking a pill in that picture she might have sold her golden rings/rosary to buy the drugs. Or it was taken from her during the night of the video.
lifeisstrange,3bazvk,haXona,2,Sat Jun 27 15:24:21 2015 UTC,Kate has her rosary on during the roof scene.  this is most likely an oversight or continuity goof. or Kate just wasn't wearing it during the pictures since we have no idea when David took them.

Although while wasting time, I found that Victoria's room number and Kate's room number are the same. 221. Then if the numbers were in order Kate would have room 222 and Juliet would have room 223, but Juliet's door doesn't have a number on it. The room after her has 224. Does this mean anything?

The wait between episodes helps build up the emotion, tension, and just the pure excitement of there being another episode...

Waiting for episode 4 is annoying but I'm used to it after playing the Walking Dead lol.  I'll definitely play through the game again some time after the last episode is out and make different choices. But it also depends on how many endings we'll get."
lifeisstrange,3bacfz,978am,2,Sat Jun 27 13:57:38 2015 UTC,"After playing a lot of TellTale's games, I'm pretty used to waiting- The Walking Dead S1/S2 and The Wolf Among Us being a few I can remember.  I'm actually playing through again. I want to see how different the scenes are compared to what I've already done. Surprisingly, it's pretty cool how many little details I missed the first time around, and how many things I've noticed this second time in. I'm hoping for alternate endings as well."
lifeisstrange,3bacfz,tehh0j0,2,Sat Jun 27 14:09:42 2015 UTC,"I enjoy episodic games. My reasoning is that it, well, it prolongs the game for you. Every episode we wind up talking about it and remembering it, and it just has a lot bigger effect on us than it would have if they just released the entire game in one go. So for me it is not a matter of patience or anything, I am quite happy with how they made this game. I doubt this subreddit would exist if it wasn't episodic to be honest."
lifeisstrange,3bacfz,T_Snake451,2,Sat Jun 27 21:47:19 2015 UTC,"Yeah, i also think that everyone who waits to play all episodes at once, never get the same feeling about the game like us who played the game in the way the developers intended. The time between the episodes is an integral part of the whole experience, especially for a game like Life is Strange, where so much theorizing is going on. All the speculations, fan theories and discussions between the episodes are part of the game. Also the impact of the cliffhangers looses their wheight, because you just can go on. It is like with a good tv show. They never would work in the same way, if the people doesn't had a week time in between to discuss what was happening.  So i strongly recomend to everyone not to wait, it will destroy important parts of the experience."

lifeisstrange,3b8e1i,StarChow,36,Fri Jun 26 20:15:08 2015 UTC,I actually like it this way. For some games (mainly TWD and GoT) I don't mind as much. But for Life Is Strange and TWAU I really enjoyed the in-between of all the episodes. Makes you check out subreddits like these and think about this game when not playing it.

lifeisstrange,3b8e1i,Gaelenmyr,3,Sat Jun 27 16:39:14 2015 UTC,"I have just played half of BL2 and I am already into all the lore and stuff. TFTB really is almost a standalone part of the franchise, you only need to know the basics about BL and you know what they are talking about. So you are okay if you decide to play it.   Ep.3 that just were probably was TT's best writing since TWAU in my opinion, so freaking good!"

People like marathoning it, but the episodes were broadcast whole weeks apart from each other! I love watching a little and then waiting for a while, so I don't get bored or overwhelmed.

lifeisstrange,3b8e1i,vince94_1,13,Sat Jun 27 02:30:15 2015 UTC,"I generally have that stance for episodic games, but playing it as it releases is THE way to enjoy the game, in my opinion. It allows the building of suspense and feels over a long period of time and allows you to get involved with the community. As opposed to just banging out the entire game in one night, with the only suspense being ""wonder what's going to happen next!?"" finds out 5 minutes later."
lifeisstrange,3b8e1i,kemando,3,Fri Jun 26 22:34:36 2015 UTC,Pacing yourself and playing the game over the course of 5 or so weeks also works. But who has the patience to do that?

All their games (they only have made 2 but plan on releasing Remember Me 2, Life Is Strange 2, and Vampyr) are pretty good. And even if you find bad things within them you ignore it because the game is just that good."
lifeisstrange,3b8e1i,AERXihu,3,Fri Jun 26 22:29:48 2015 UTC,"The person whose recommendation on /r/GameDeals got me to buy the game during the Summer Sale described Remember Me as a ""flawed masterpiece"", akin to games like Beyond: Two Souls. I think that's a really good description of it. It has a great deal of problems, but it's so unique and inventive and just plain enjoyable that I can excuse all those problems.  And then, of course, there's Life is Strange, which is already my second-favourite game of all time (just behind The Walking Dead). I'm becoming more and more of a huge fan of DONTNOD."
lifeisstrange,3b8e1i,EcoleBuissonniere,2,Sat Jun 27 00:26:09 2015 UTC,"Yeah accurate description of the wonders of Remember me. A slightly unpolished diamond  LIS ties TWAU for me with TFTB right after them, makes me so hopeful about Vampyr.

It just makes me feel something I haven't felt in a long, long time with a video game. The last few I can think of are Mass Effect 3, The Last of Us, and The Walking Dead S1.  It's a beautiful game. It really is. The thing I love most about it is how I can relate to Max. Being a guy, that may come off as strange, but I absolutely adore her personality. I'm super shy and quiet, and I've been struggling with depression for as long as I can remember.   This game helps me, because I feel like I'm not alone. I don't really have many friends, to be honest, I only really have one, but I barely ever get to hangout with them. Everyone I've ever cared about has left me or used me, and it hurts like hell.   I love story driven games because I love being apart of these universes, and this is definitely one I'd never want to miss out on. The last time I felt like this was honestly when I watched Donnie Darko, and now that feeling is coming back.  Thank you DontNod for such an amazing experience."

lifeisstrange,3b78dy,centerflag982,5,Fri Jun 26 21:47:15 2015 UTC,"The latter. No one without some sort of legitimate mental issues is going to bet their life on a complete stranger's unwillingness to pull a trigger. Like I said, it's pure Hollywood. IRL, you make that bet and you're more than likely going to end up with a bullet in you - as Frank would have, if there were in fact bullets available.   Frank is dumb/stoned enough 24/7 to not realize, ""fuck, that's a gun.""   He seems pretty clear-headed in that scene - he's just trying to act tough in the most idiotic way possible"

lifeisstrange,3b78dy,elmerion,5,Fri Jun 26 21:24:41 2015 UTC,"I think it should be an option if you decide to rewind after shooting, try to shoot frank, realize the gun has no bullets, go back in time don't shoot, tell Chloe you already tried and the gun had no bullets"

lifeisstrange,3b78dy,zeCrazyEye,4,Fri Jun 26 22:06:12 2015 UTC,Considering you can rewind to before Frank even shows up I don't know why you can't tell Chloe they need to run because Frank is coming.

lifeisstrange,3ba8rn,AlvarezMd90,21,Sat Jun 27 07:10:14 2015 UTC,"They are pre-rendered, yes. I assume Dontnod opted for pre-rendered endings because of the fact that most of the time, the endings go to multiple locations one after another, and to save time and processing power loading all of those areas into memory at once, they just shot different parts of the endings and strung them together in editing to make it a nice smooth cutscene with no loading required."
lifeisstrange,3ba8rn,TDurandal,1 point,Sat Jun 27 08:57:19 2015 UTC,"Meh, I figured. But still. It's a pretty big shame to me. If I were them, I would've at least backed-up the original scenes. And what about Resident Evil 4? How did they managed to keep them dynamic 3D without too much loading times? They could have cut off parts of the scene outside the view to save a little memory. Telltale pulled it off too. (Though I know they have more people working on the game.) :P"
lifeisstrange,3ba8rn,14mm,13,Sat Jun 27 09:02:15 2015 UTC,"But... who actually cares?  Why is it a shame for them to get the exact same effect with less computing requirement?  Developers have been gaming their engines for decades to squeeze out the best experience at the least cost.  The only time pre-rendered content ever bothers me is when they show that shit on-stage at a gaming convention and claim it is ""in-engine"".  Make all of my cinematics pre-rendered please."
lifeisstrange,3ba8rn,14mm,-4,Sat Jun 27 15:38:45 2015 UTC,"You haven't seen what I've seen. I care. And it's not for graphics' sake. I just don't like inconsistency's and especially not pre-rendered cut scenes.  To explain myself here, I've hated them since the bad Re4 Biohazard pc port in 2007. What about running the game on a higher resolution in future? It's not going higher than 1080p I guess. It would all look smudged compared to the real time gameplay."
lifeisstrange,3ba8rn,GenuineID,1 point,Sat Jun 27 23:07:43 2015 UTC,"Aside from ""inconsistencies"" that wasn't much of an explanation.  Pre-rendered cutscenes are not limited to specific resolutions, either.  Thus far, the cut-scenes, if anything, have more particle and lighting effects than normal.  There've been a few times where I thought they got a little carried away with it.  Generally, it's not any different from all of the other pre-rendered scenes throughout the game.  I can't say whether I've ""seen what you've seen"", but that's a ridiculous preface to the idea that pre-rendered content sucks simply just because.  It sounds like nothing more than purist elitism."
lifeisstrange,3ba8rn,14mm,2,Sun Jun 28 01:11:36 2015 UTC,"I can't speak to OP's concerns beyond graphics, but I will say that in practice, resolution absolutely is an issue with pre-rendering. Yes, developers could render cutscenes at 16K or whatever the game engine's theoretical maximum is, but I can't say that I've ever seen this actually happen.  Life is Strange supports at least up to 4K natively on PC, and could conceivably be modded further. But we won't be able to magically enhance the cutscenes, which are a blurry 1080p."
lifeisstrange,3ba8rn,GenuineID,2,Sun Jun 28 12:23:20 2015 UTC,"The culprit in the image you linked has nothing to do with resolution.  Dontnod has employed an annoying soft light effect in every single sunset ending thus far.  The assets themselves are still sharp at 1080p in moments when the light isn't drowning out the shot.  Notably, the scene with Warren and Max in the courtyard during the eclipse, you can see the difference when seeing them from behind, when the soft light is most prevalent, and then from the side/front perspective, when showing some of the assets are still crisp.  Their artistic choice in visual effects =/= resolution issues.  Strip away that stupid golden haze and things would look a hundred times better."
lifeisstrange,3ba8rn,14mm,1 point,Mon Jun 29 01:49:48 2015 UTC,"You missed the point. I have a 1440p monitor, the cutscenes are blurry and aliased because they are pre-rendered at 1080p."
lifeisstrange,3ba8rn,14mm,1 point,Wed Jul 1 22:18:23 2015 UTC,"I didn't miss the point.  I also have a 1440p monitor.  1080p is not blurry on my monitor and it is not blurry on your monitor either.  It's a visual effect, end of story.  Either that or you need to change your settings around.  If anything, pre-rendered would do the exact opposite of create aliasing."
lifeisstrange,3ba8rn,GenuineID,1 point,Thu Jul 2 05:04:58 2015 UTC,Yes you most certainly can. Are you telling me that every single 1080p video you have ever watched on your 1440p monitor is blurry?  BLURRY?  Because that transition should not be and is not night and day.  That's a huge exaggeration.  Go back and watch the episode two ending and keep my original post in mind and you'll see where their visual effects are causing the brunt of the trouble with the sharpness of the image.  Upscaling doesn't suddenly make everything covered in fuzz.  That's absolutely ridiculous.  Pre-rendered video being upscaled would NOT cause aliasing. That's a complete contradiction to your claim of blurriness.  You are confusing a visual effect with an issue of quality.
lifeisstrange,3ba8rn,vince94_1,1 point,Thu Jul 2 12:30:42 2015 UTC,"Okay, so:   You don't understand that different scaling methods exist. You apparently have a vision impairment that you don't wish to acknowledge because the difference between 1440p and 1080p on a reasonably sized desktop monitor is night and day. You can't tell when the game switches over to pre-rendered, because it's not during the courtyard scene and is clearly noticeable."
lifeisstrange,3ba8rn,theironlefty,1 point,Thu Jul 2 12:39:07 2015 UTC,"""Aside from ""inconsistencies"" that wasn't much of an explanation.""  Simply, because you might haven't played both the port of re4 and the new 2015 port. If you need explanation for my hating on pre-rendered you should look it up on the internet. It was awful, believe me. And these renderings, when I saw the thin bar at the bottom somehow reminded me (a little) of that. xD  .  ""Pre-rendered cutscenes are not limited to specific resolutions, either. Thus far, the cut-scenes, if anything, have more particle and lighting effects than normal.""  Yes, that's obvious and true. But what I'm saying is that I don't think that the .bik's resolution is rendered beyond 1080p. I might have a look at it with rad video tools sometime to check out. But if that's the case, this means, that in the future, if someone with a bigger res than 1920x1080, plays the game, the video will stretch to the monitor's size and look blurred.  .  ""Generally, it's not any different from all of the other pre-rendered scenes throughout the game.""  I do think I noticed it too at the start of each episode. These are pre-rendered too. But the rest is pure eye-candy-ish 3D.  .  ""I can't say whether I've ""seen what you've seen"", but that's a ridiculous preface to the idea that pre-rendered content sucks simply just because. It sounds like nothing more than purist elitism.""  Sure, it is partly pure elitism from me. I'm not going to deny that. My main concern and reason is inconsistency's in how the game looks and feels. I just can see it straight away, the difference between dynamic 3D and pre-rendered."
lifeisstrange,3ba8rn,vince94_1,4,Sun Jun 28 08:08:03 2015 UTC,"On my setup (MacBook Pro dual-booting Windows 8), the pre-rendered cutscenes have background music, but NONE of the voice clips play. Thank goodness for subtitles..."

lifeisstrange,3b8dr4,haXona,18,Sat Jun 27 00:52:04 2015 UTC,"The whole selfie thing is probably to illustrate how Max is discovering who she is or something like that. I don't think her selfies are actually meant to be incredible works of photography. At a stretch, you could say that Jefferson realizes the significance of Max's selfies in her search for her identity. But that's really reaching.  Also the optional photographs you can take of the world around you are quite pretty. Max will actually position herself properly and get a good angle on the subject for those. She also seems to find some pretty interesting, out-of-the-ordinary things that make great pictures from almost any angle. Like the butterfly in the bathroom; that's just freaking cool."
lifeisstrange,3b8dr4,yarfmeister,13,Fri Jun 26 22:13:46 2015 UTC,"I also don't think Jefferson is calling Max's selfies revolutionary, I believe Jefferson sees talent and ability in more ""official"" photos, most likely her homework or her portfolio, if she has one. Chances are the photos that are earning Max such high praise are also photos we'll never see in detail.  But we can see her Journal photos (aka the optional photos throughout each episode) and those are pretty good actually, the one of Chloe playing with the gun, the diner sign, are perfectly fine photos. Especially consider they're photos taken by a teenager who's mostly just fucking around, most of them seem to be about something cool or unusual and not about actually framing an amazing photo. But I would like to see the stuff Max turns in as homework to Jefferson.  But more importantly, when you go through Jefferson's desk in Episode 3 why is Max so impressed by Victoria's photo when it doesn't look like anything special. I'm fairly sure it's just a picture of somebody in a chair. Nathan's creepy graveyard photo seemed cooler than it."

lifeisstrange,3b8pdn,poppyuppy33,6,Fri Jun 26 23:50:38 2015 UTC,"""Maybe that's why Chloe was so drawn to Rachel after Max and her family moved out of town. Though their personalities differed, Chloe felt the same connection to Rachel as she did with Max, suggesting that they both possibly share the same type of energy (or vibe, or whatever)."" this sounds pretty interesting,some people really have the same presence and role and something in them, but completely different personalities.Like how dictators are different persons, but they attract the masses the same way and seemingly fulfill the same role.The game has a lot going on about spirit animals, but if Rachel is a doe, than someone has to be the squirrel and the bluejay and there is no indication about that.Love this game, raises up so many interesting questions."
lifeisstrange,3b8pdn,yarfmeister,9,Fri Jun 26 22:08:04 2015 UTC,"I think the bluejay is William. Probably not, but think about it."

lifeisstrange,3b8pdn,yarfmeister,2,Fri Jun 26 22:20:51 2015 UTC,"It does make sense... like a guardian angel/spirit for Chloe. Since William is passed on and the bird isn't a Ghost Bluejay, maybe this means that Rachel is alive somewhere and just projecting the Ghost Doe!"
lifeisstrange,3b8pdn,poppyuppy33,2,Sat Jun 27 00:02:56 2015 UTC,I didn't save the bird. Is that the one you're talking about with the bluejay?
lifeisstrange,3b8pdn,vince94_1,2,Sat Jun 27 11:22:52 2015 UTC,Indeed.
lifeisstrange,3b8pdn,EcoleBuissonniere,3,Sat Jun 27 11:32:24 2015 UTC,Samuel is the squirrel.
lifeisstrange,3b8pdn,85_squats,2,Fri Jun 26 22:19:39 2015 UTC,"Yeah seams like that Samuel's spirit animal is the squirrel, but it has no indication that it is a manifestation of someone's will.And if the doe is the manifestation of Rachel, or Rachels will in some form or expression, than it makes the concept of a spirit animal a personal projection, rater than a natural occurance or connection to something mayor or unknown or just nature itself.I dunno, maybe different people share the same spirit animals like how they share the same astrology signs, but there are millions of people sharing the same signs, so a spirit animal could be the will of millions of people.The only thing that's certain that we are all way too overthinking everything:DBut it's superfun to do so:D"
lifeisstrange,3b8pdn,entropyfu,2,Fri Jun 26 22:43:32 2015 UTC,"The Ghost Doe specifically is the doe I'm talking about.   The Ghost Doe shows up in the tornado vision (ep 1) and in the junkyard (ep 2) - and I hate to admit this, but I don't remember if the Ghost Doe shows up in  ep 3 or not. But this doe is transparent, immune to Max's rewind power, and doesn't show up in photos.   This is the doe that I'm suggesting is Rachel Amber (her spirit, her will, her ghost... not sure the specifics) and is connecting her to Max.  There aren't any Ghost Squirrels in the game (at least not that I've encountered), but if there were, I would definitely start worrying for/about Samuel."
lifeisstrange,3b8pdn,Relaxed_Rage,4,Sat Jun 27 00:01:02 2015 UTC,"Rachel was ""too cool"" for even the Vortex Club, and Max seems to be in a similar position in the new timeline. Hmm..."
lifeisstrange,3b8pdn,kemando,3,Sat Jun 27 02:23:42 2015 UTC,"Well, we know for a solid fact that that fucking deer isn't normal, what with not being affected by the rewind and not showing up in the photo. I could easily see it having some connection to Rachel. I wouldn't go so far as to say that she is the doe, but I can see the connection.  Of course, the Twin Peaks fan in me wants to believe that Dark Room = Black Lodge, and the doe is LiS's version of the owls, except (maybe?) benevolent."
lifeisstrange,3b8pdn,kemando,3,Sat Jun 27 00:50:12 2015 UTC,"I always expected Dark Room to be the photography term, where you develop photos."

lifeisstrange,3b8zxa,sdrawkcaBrad,5,Sat Jun 27 16:48:23 2015 UTC,I went back and fixed it. I figured if Max can use her power to rewind time to help people so can I.
lifeisstrange,3b8zxa,jessebona,3,Sat Jun 27 00:14:25 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't replay it on that save file. Maybe do another playthrough on a different file and save her there, but in a purely story-based, decision-heavy game like this I'd say living with your choices is the best way to go. I remember how wracked with guilt I was after minor Heavy Rain spoilers in Heavy Rain, but I feel like not reloading a save helped me enjoy the game a lot. There's something a lot cooler about games like this when you decide for yourself that every decision you make is going to be permanent (at least on that one save file)."
lifeisstrange,3b8zxa,EcoleBuissonniere,3,Sat Jun 27 00:44:09 2015 UTC,"Well to be fair, that part was important because if you investigated Kate's room, you'd have found a postcard/letter from her father. Max then starts some commentary about how much her father cares about her. Then you find a letter from her other family which basically shame Kate and tells her they regret sending her to Blackwell. Max says that Kate's father clearly cares a lot about her.  But um, I don't know how that decision turns out. Because the last 2 episodes are not out yet. I would say, try to save her anyway. Make 2 saves for it. Can't hurt."
lifeisstrange,3b8zxa,85_squats,2,Sat Jun 27 03:30:02 2015 UTC,"I would continue without to replay ep2. Then after your game is finished (ep1-5), replay with saving her."

lifeisstrange,3b64rq,DionLord,15,Fri Jun 26 08:59:58 2015 UTC,"Weird that they're only just now doing the voice work for episode 4, when presumably the episode is coming out in 2-3 weeks. I've never followed/played a game like this in episodic format, so it seems strange to me that they're still constantly working on it as episodes are out and people are playing through the game. You'd think they'd be months ahead as far as production goes and just polishing stuff up and doing QA stuff in the weeks before."
lifeisstrange,3b64rq,sexandliquor,23,Fri Jun 26 09:46:58 2015 UTC,"Weird that they're only just now doing the voice work for episode 4,   Pretty sure she's working on ep 5.  She only said she's excited for the soon-to-be released ep 4 and I think that's causing confusion.  Episode 4 was well into production at least 3 months ago according to the  Instagram of one of the motion capture models.  I'm guessing the brunette is the model for Max and the blonde for Chloe given their heights.  I knew Max's motion capture model had to be a real model when I saw her strut Rachel's clothes."
lifeisstrange,3b64rq,GrayManTheory,6,Fri Jun 26 10:49:21 2015 UTC,Using actual models for their motion capture models.
lifeisstrange,3b64rq,BrettGilpin,3,Fri Jun 26 15:30:06 2015 UTC,"She kinda indirectly confirmed in the comments that it was Ep.4  But its vague  When asked if she had seen Ep.4 yet she said ""I actually havent seen it yet. Just recorded the lines for Max"" which is open for interpretation of the word ""just"" :P"
lifeisstrange,3b64rq,GrayManTheory,8,Fri Jun 26 10:54:00 2015 UTC,It's very possible they are doing last minute edits too.  I'm wondering if they changed anything because of the early leaks.  Someone posted a picture of Max's journal from an early version of the game and  the one from episode 3 was from a location no where in episode 3.  So long as we get our episode 4 in 3 weeks I'll be happy.
lifeisstrange,3b64rq,BrettGilpin,5,Fri Jun 26 11:29:16 2015 UTC,"Hmm might be it, either way its soon to be done. You know it feels likte its been months since EP.3 lool to think that I know need to look forward to tftb EP.4 too is gonna kill me."
lifeisstrange,3b64rq,BrettGilpin,4,Fri Jun 26 11:34:38 2015 UTC,"There were leaks?  Also, when is episode 4 supposed to come out?"
lifeisstrange,3b64rq,kingbanjee,9,Fri Jun 26 15:29:00 2015 UTC,"In short: Yes.  In a mix of data mining of the current game files and actual leaks, information about unreleased episodes has been a problem since the release of Episode 1.  Personally I would recommend you stay away from leaks, and as a mod I would like to remind everyone that posting leaked information on this subreddit is not allowed."
lifeisstrange,3b64rq,centerflag982,3,Fri Jun 26 15:32:41 2015 UTC,"That's cool. I don't usually go looking for leaks anyways. I just hadn't heard about it, so I was a little surprised. Also probably haven't heard about it because I only just found the game like 2 weeks ago."
lifeisstrange,3b64rq,Bissje,4,Fri Jun 26 15:36:31 2015 UTC,"Welcome to the sub then :)  Regarding your ep4 question: So far there is no set release date. The best estimate is early-mid July, this information is also available in the sidebar. Some websites may claim to know the exact release date, but don't believe them. The only reliable source is Dontnod Entertainment and Square Enix themselves."
lifeisstrange,3b64rq,TruthAlone,4,Fri Jun 26 15:55:20 2015 UTC,"That means that she hasn't seen episode four, she only recorded Max's lines. Just used in the sense of ""only"" not like ""Just did"""
lifeisstrange,3b64rq,85_squats,2,Fri Jun 26 19:06:16 2015 UTC,"Yeah, in that context I'd say ""just"" is probably meant like ""only,"" not ""recently"""
lifeisstrange,3b64rq,jessebona,7,Sun Jun 28 06:20:51 2015 UTC,"The way most games work is that the developers record a stand-in dialogue during production so they can start animating and timing everything.

lifeisstrange,3b8jj9,poppyuppy33,2,Fri Jun 26 21:23:28 2015 UTC,"But your theory sounds interesting, the only problem is that we only have two episodes left, so i doubt that we have enough time to spend in the alternate timeline.Maybe i just dont want to, and want to get back to the blue haired punk Chloe as soon as possible:D"

It doesn't make sense to me that the universe will kill every single person in Arcadia Bay because of Chloe. I believe that when Max rewinds time she is messing with the universe laws and all that stuff. Chaos Theory is basically telling Max ""Stop fucking up with time before I have to destroy you bitch!"""
lifeisstrange,3b8jj9,AERXihu,2,Sat Jun 27 22:19:29 2015 UTC,"I was thinking the same thing. I don't think we'll stick around in that alternate timeline for too long. It's basically just there to teach Max a huge lesson about messing with things she shouldn't. I also think it's going to scare her a little bit, meaning she'll start to regret using her powers so much, and perhaps Episode 4 and 5 are her coming to terms with the power she has, and whether she's willing to make sacrifices or continue to use her powers for the better."
lifeisstrange,3b8jj9,Grayson754,1 point,Sat Jun 27 14:12:18 2015 UTC,That is a great theory and I think is most likely what is going to happen. I just finished Episode 3 and was shocked to see what happened to Chloe!

lifeisstrange,3b8jj9,Meet_Dave,3,Fri Jun 26 20:59:43 2015 UTC,I doubt it.  In that timeline she is disabled thus its harder to find new friends/ keep old ones. Also main reason why she became so close friends with Rachel was that there wasnt nobody else at that time for her.
lifeisstrange,3b8jj9,TAGsvk,1 point,Fri Jun 26 21:08:34 2015 UTC,"It should be interesting for sure. If everything is different, particularly that Max doesn't need to save Chloe in the bathroom, then Rachel could be conspicuous by her absence. If she's there, we might be able to disregard one of the more persistent theories.  I say might because the influence of strange attractors (chaos theory) could bring us to the same result albeit by a different route. It depends on whether we get a good look at her or not."

An influence in Chloe like she was in the timeline we know or someone we'll just ever know as a Rachel with her own different story... OR Rachel can time travel and made the same choice as Max to ""stop"" Chloe's sufferings by saving William (somehow) though I highly doubt this since Rachel had no way to get back to the moment William died... OR she is a time traveller that hated Chloe that went back in time to kill William and make Chloe's life impossible... Yeah, that last one is weird as F***"

lifeisstrange,3b832x,Enverex,3,Sat Jun 27 17:00:55 2015 UTC,"It's possible I was wrong to say that Max had ""severe"" anxiety... but I do think she does have at least some form of social anxiety issues. Prior to her powers, her defining characteristic to EVERYONE at Blackwell was ""cripplingly shy."" Everyone thought this about her.  Prior to her powers, we have evidence that she really only spoke to Warren and Kate. Until the tornado day where she discovers her powers, she didn't really speak to anyone and she's really only speaking to people now in order to get information out of them.   More than that, she's terrified of submitting to the everyday heroes contest, even ripping up the picture she was thinking about submitting after Mr. Jefferson encouraged her to submit one because he believed she has ""a gift."" Though WE are creeped out by him, he is her hero that she looks up to, so the fact that she STILL doubts herself and her ability after he compliments her is significant.   So, I take back the ""severe"" part. However, I still stand that Max before her powers WAS severely shy and riddled with social anxiety. Max AFTER her powers manifested is gaining more confidence and assertiveness."
lifeisstrange,3b832x,JC_Phoenix7,4,Fri Jun 26 21:57:47 2015 UTC,"As someone with severe social anxiety I personally see Max through a certain ""wish fulfillment"" filter. Like Max is me, if I JUST had the power to rewind time! lol  At the very beginning of the game all Max does is mumble, stutter, trip over her words, act like a nervous wreck, and drown out the world with music. It's only after she has the power to rewind time and be ""perfect"" that she slowly starts becoming confident enough to talk to people in a normal way. You could say that she has Chloe, Warren, Kate, and others... But Chloe was a childhood friend, and didn't Max know Warren before she left? Even if she didn't Warren has been pining for her for at least a month so far and when someone follows you around being overly nice to you for that long you get comfortable with them. As for Kate and the others I think it's pretty clear that she's just acquaintances with them which explains why everyone including Kate is so dismissive and rude towards Max in episode 1, it's so weird and out of character for this nosy loner to talk to them face to face.  As for the comment about being far away from parents in some dorm all alone I have some experience with this. I went to Job Corps for over a year, and really it's pretty easy to just zone things out, hide away in your room, drown out people with music or pretending to be on your phone, etc. Also lot's of people with social anxiety go to college and focus on academic pursuits, instead of social ones... I've even noticed a trend of socially anxious people trying to become teachers."

There is quite a bit of inaccurate speculation here.  It's good that you're aware of people who have mental disorders, but you shouldn't try to suggest and label anyone as having such unless you really know. Other than Kate having severe depression to the point of suicide, none of the characters seem to have any of those mental disorders that you listed to the point of diagnosis. This is coming from a psychology undergrad that has taken a psychopathology course, so I am not an expert either, but I hope I can provide some knowledge and education to clear up some misconceptions  Mental disorder diagnoses are not given out very easily. Many people exhibit signs of certain disorders (anxiety being a prominent one). But unless it is extremely debilliating and distressing, and interferes with their daily life function, it cannot be diagnosed as a disorder. Think of it this way: a cough can mean you either have the common cold or pneumonia. There are certain criteria that have to be met for each before we can call it pneumonia.  As I was typing this, I realized how long the post was getting. So I divided them up and posted them to my tumblr blog. Please give them a read.  In response to:  Chloe on having depression and Borderline Personality Disorder.  Nathan having schizophrenia.  Nathan having psychopathy.  Bipolar disorder in general.  I will probably eventually make more posts later, and I can link them to you if you're interested. I hope that I was able to make my point that many of these characters would not be diagnosed with those illnesses."

I know personally I've seen at least one possible episode four spoiler which was posted untagged in episode 3 discussion (which I reported and someone summarily deleted) so I imagine you see a lot, probably as much as somebody who is looking for spoilers."

More to your point though, it's heavily hinted (including pill bottles in his locker) that Nathan has some actual emotional problems that are effecting his bizarre moodswings. Also remember how he goes into your room, destroys it, writes morbid shit on your walls... and then a few days later has a routine (if anger filled) conversation with you in the diner and tells you how to get drugs."

Which  as far as I remember, all happens without rewinding the conversation, very much at least. There's no carefully manipulated tricks like with other people in the game, for the most part he's incredibly upfront with her."
lifeisstrange,3b6mn3,BobMugabe35,4,Sat Jun 27 01:08:30 2015 UTC,"I think there is an unrevealed connection between Kate and Nathan.  Maybe both are supposed to die and their drawings are visions of death creeping up on them.  We all assume that Chloe was destined to die in that bathroom.  But maybe Chloe was shot because of something Max had done first, and originally Chloe had pulled her gun on Nathan first.  Has it ever been explicitly stated when Chloe stole the gun?"
lifeisstrange,3b6mn3,GrayManTheory,2,Fri Jun 26 13:30:26 2015 UTC,Chloe already explained why he was there and she was there. There's already a connection between Kate/Nathan. The party. But there could be more to it. Some people think Nathan might replace Kate in the alt universe if Kate isn't dead.

lifeisstrange,3b6mn3,chattypenguin,1 point,Fri Jun 26 14:51:42 2015 UTC,"I think at some point Chloe mentions she had the gun before the bathroom scene but had left it in the truck, so that's why she didn't pistol whip Nathan in the bathroom.   But it has to be sometime before episode 1 because I doubt Chloe went to Blackwell, almost got shot, met Max, drove home and stole the gun while hanging out with Max. And she obviously has the gun at the end of episode 1.   So the best answer for when the gun was stolen is probably Sunday, maybe Saturday. But at most a few days before the game starts since I imagine David checks his guns regularly and would notice pretty quickly."

lifeisstrange,3b6mn3,DeathMcGunz,1 point,Sat Jun 27 05:13:17 2015 UTC,"I'd say this will play out further in later episodes. The Vortex Club party will probably flesh out Nathan a bit more, but so far it doesn't take much to see he is a troubled character. He needs help as much as Kate did, he is from a powerful, influential family and has the eyes of the town on him. He is unstable and his situation has made him teeter into dangerous territory. He no doubt has had many dark thoughts before, leading up to the events of the game and seeing Kate attempt suicide no doubt did things and Victoria being a member of Blackwell's high society is no doubt one of the few he would confide in."

Life Is Strange seems to be leading to a conclusion that doesn't warrant a sequel and getting one would cheapen the first story in my opinion.

lifeisstrange,3b5t0d,AERXihu,1 point,Fri Jun 26 05:11:27 2015 UTC,"I still don't get the multiple timeline theory what so ever. I feel like everybody just assumed there are multiple timelines because...reasons???  As far as I'm concerned there's a single timeline for the entire game. Max's powers initially let her rewind 5-10 minutes at a time. Then she can stop time, then she can jump to any point in her own history using personal mementos. I believe saving William doesn't create a second (or third, or whatever) timeline and instead just changes five years worth of stuff. Max's memory rewinding power sends back to the point she rewound from once the memory she ""visits"" ends. So when William leaves the house that memory ends she is catapulted back to 2013 to find out that she's a Vortex member. This is explains why Max doesn't know anything about the modified timeline. Her different powers can also work simultaneously, this is why Max can still rewind a few minutes when she jumped back five years.   Unless somebody has evidence more significant than post-episode 3 save files listing the location as ""alternate campus"" since this can be explained by the game considering them two different areas, the courtyard in episode 4 will be different than episode 1-3 so they can't reuse the location name. It also let's the player know they're after the end of the episode, not before it. So I don't see any reason to assume that there are multiple timelines."
lifeisstrange,3b5t0d,SkateboardCop,3,Fri Jun 26 06:29:58 2015 UTC,"The reason to assume that there are multiple timelines is, well... the definition. The realm of possibilities. There's no actual evidence that ""every possible universe exists but we don't have acces to it"", but it does not matter. By rewinding and changing something you unleash a wave that changes stuff after it. Even without rewinding - at the moment of decision between A and B both of these timelines exist in the realm of possibility, but you enter only one at a time."
lifeisstrange,3b5t0d,CheessieStew,1 point,Fri Jun 26 14:16:36 2015 UTC,"The multiple timeline theory that I used in that post was due to the  choices in the game. Every time Max goes back in time and changes one small thing she changes another. If Max had not changed it nothing would happen. This is why I say multiple timelines due to Max and each change she makes. This game is based on time travel.  Not every theory needs to have hardcore proof left and right. Definition of theory is: ""a supposition or a system of ideas intended to explain something, especially one based on general principles independent of the thing to be explained.""   ALSO If there is one timeline there is another due to Max changing one small detail by rewinding. We already have 3 timelines in the game (Chloe dying, Max saving Chloe, and Max saving William)"
lifeisstrange,3b5t0d,SkateboardCop,1 point,Fri Jun 26 17:46:36 2015 UTC,"Sorry if that read as standoff-ish, I obviously not demanding theories be backed up by perfect evidence, I meant more like ""everything I can think of points toward a singular timeline, not multiple, so I gotta disagree"" and not ""UR THERY SUCKS BCUZ UR DUM AND U DONT HAVE ENUGH EVIDENCE""  But if we're considering a timeline for every change then isn't every single rewind, no matter how minor, a new timeline? But what I'm wondering how you think these timelines work? Is a ""timeline"" just shorthand for ""any possible choice that could of happened"" so William dying is a timeline, but William not dying is also a timeline, but only one exists at a time depending on what choice Max makes? Or do the William dies/doesn't die timelines both exist at the same time? If they do are they physically separate?   Does each timeline have it's own Max/Chloe/William/etc? Or did Max disappear from ""william is dead"" timeline and now only exists in ""william is alive"" timeline?  For me these are a lot of unanswered questions and it personally makes more sense to consider a single timeline that can be ""rewritten"". So Max can be mean to somebody, rewind and be nice. But as far as the timeline/world is concerned Max was only ever nice since her rewinding destroyed any trace of her being mean and replaced it with her being nice. So when Max went back five years she erased five years worth of history, saved William and then jumped back to the time where she rewound. So the end of episode 3 isn't a new and separate timeline but instead a ""heavily modified"" timeline.   I'm interested in the multiple timeline theory being true but I just can't make sense of it in my head and since the majority of people and theories just assume it's true I've yet to seen anybody else think through it as much and try to figure out exactly how it would work so I'm interested in what you think, especially since your theory extends to Max basically being a cosmic god. But at this point I should probably just do a longer write up and make a new post for people to discuss."
lifeisstrange,3b5t0d,yarfmeister,1 point,Sat Jun 27 04:39:45 2015 UTC,Its alright I just took it that way. Plus it was late at night and I have problems sleeping.  My theories I make are usually just crap from my head but since you have asked on my opinion. I believe that a timeline is a reality where time flows. But due to Max reversing time there are multiple timelines (So basically if Max changes one thing she creates another timeline or reality where things are different. Basically because of Max changing one thing there becomes another reality based on what she changes like a what if. For example when Max stops William from death she creates a timeline based on that. When she stops him from death there is a timeline that goes on with him alive changing everything.)  There is one timeline (my theory is based on there being one timeline but due to Max rewinding time she creates multiple timelines based on the changes she makes so you can't tell the original one from just a one she is in. So Max has a timeline before she gets her power and when she first rewinds time she makes another timeline and is thrown in that one because in the original timeline Max shouldn't have powers in the first place.) So there is a    William is dead timeline but also another timeline that runs at the same time that is the alternate version of that (alternate timeline) when Max changes something. So episode 3 can be a separate timeline created by Max due to her changing the original timeline.  If this doesn't make sense don't worry I just woke up so I might edit everything.
lifeisstrange,3b5t0d,DeathMcGunz,1 point,Sat Jun 27 20:53:33 2015 UTC,"I think the overall idea of multiple timelines is that you can't actually change history, that you're just opening the door to an alternate reality. There are infinite realities, and having the ability to rewind time just lets you hop between them."
lifeisstrange,3b5t0d,SkateboardCop,1 point,Fri Jun 26 22:27:39 2015 UTC,"I agree with you. Multiple timelines never really seemed to make any sense. Just because you change something doesn't create an alternate universe. And even if it did, there's no reason for it unless you can travel between the two."
lifeisstrange,3b5t0d,miniketo,1 point,Sat Jun 27 05:18:39 2015 UTC,"I forgot to mention that, sure every minor rewind or choice could be an alternate timeline but what's the importance if Max only ever lives in her (i.e. the one we play through) timeline? Unless we get a Bioshock Infinite situation where multiple versions of the same person get to meet each other then it might as well be a single timeline. Like maybe there's a billion centillion versions of my life based on an infinitely complicated decision tree but that means jack shit for me until they invent the bubble universe hopping machine."
lifeisstrange,3b5t0d,SkateboardCop,1 point,Sat Jun 27 05:22:49 2015 UTC,"Well, it does seem like universe hopping is an option with the mechanics of Max's power. She keeps anything she has on her while time-traveling.   If she can hop through any picture, period, I could see either episode 4 or 5 being split between universes, since we've been given the option to take pictures at huge, impactful moments in the first version of events.   Probably not going to happen but it feels like it'd be an oversight if they didn't address her at least trying to jump between worlds via pictures."
lifeisstrange,3b5t0d,miniketo,1 point,Mon Jun 29 16:49:24 2015 UTC,"Except why are pictures separate worlds? The photo hopping still makes sense just as ""extended time travel"" meaning Max can explore different ""worlds"" by changing a single timeline through photo hopping and seeing what changes"
lifeisstrange,3b5t0d,SkateboardCop,1 point,Mon Jun 29 20:01:35 2015 UTC,"If the photos changed with the timeline, they wouldn't be. But I'm guessing that if you were to go and open your journal in Ep. 4/5, you could see all the old pictures you took: Chloe holding a gun, the Skeleton with the Cigarette when you're trespassing. Though if they wipe the journal clean, then there's no way my last comment would even be applicable.  Still, if they're viewable in the next ep, those things wouldn't happen without Blue Chloe.   Say Max in Timeline A (Ep. 1-midway through 3) takes pictures of things as we experienced them while playing, but retains those pictures -- unchanged -- when she changes to Timeline B, she still has access to those old memories and pictures. If she could travel through to those events, it would be world hopping. If she doesn't even try it's an oversight by the devs/writers.  However, Blue Chloe could totally be replaced with Rachel Amber, Victoria, or Kate in this version of events. So Max would still be able to travel via photo, but it would just be time traveling. At this point we don't actually know for certain if there are multiple universes existing simultaneously in LiS, or just one.   We'll see if they bring it up in the next episode."
lifeisstrange,3b5t0d,AztechXYZ,1 point,Mon Jun 29 21:09:54 2015 UTC,"Didn't consider that, for some reason I was only considering the photo of Max and Chloe when they're 13, since that photo would exist in both ""timelines"" (i.e. William is/is not dead variations, regardless if it's one or multiple timelines)  So multiple worlds makes sense if we retain our inventory (including the journal) in episode 4 since I can't think of a way to rewind to an event that hasn't happened (basically anything involving Chloe episode 1-3) if Max's power work linearly. Which is what I was thinking earlier, I assumed the photo hopping was actually just long-range rewinding with a ""return mechanism"", which explains why Max is plopped back as a Vortex Club member but didn't know she was in the club.  But I thought of a third explanation for the photo power. Every important photo to Max (I'm guessing any photo with an important emotional attachment, so a photo of a squirrel probably wouldn't work) is basically a save state of the universe.   When she hops into a photo the world she hopped from (so like episode 1-3ish) is basically destroyed, her single memory of the photo time/location is created and her mind and powers are inserted into her old body (so like 13 yr/old max) and then once she reaches the end of the memory (William leaving the house) she's booted out of the memory. The universe or her power or whatever  then crunches the numbers and figures out the butterfly effects from the changes Max made and creates a new universe (or modifies the old one, doesn't really matter actually) and drops Max back into the present day (so the equivalent time/location of her dorm room with the photo) Max retains her memories and her inventory but has no memories of the ""new"" world since she never lived in the modified/newly created portion.  That's the only explanation I think of that that covers both a single timeline theory and how photo hopping would work without multiple concurrent worlds/timelines/universes/whatever we're calling them.   But this theory could also explain explain multiple worlds/timelines, just instead of the timeline being erased/rewritten her power just creates a new world that can be hopped in and out of.  But I really like this theory, it solves the majority of my questions (like why every rewind isn't it's own timeline) and makes the most sense to me IMO. Now I'm really hyped for episode 4 to see how this plays out."

At that point, the admonition to ""just install Windows""—assuming, again, that such is a possible option—would have been a contextually appropriate recommendation. As is, I was merely making an offhand comment as a conversation starter for talking about this particular L4D2 mod, not engaging in a detailed discussion of the pros and cons of running Steam games under Wine."
lifeisstrange,3b2dbj,TheNathanNS,2,Thu Jun 25 18:43:04 2015 UTC,"Bloody hell, you are rude.   Like god damn, at least most people have the deceny to say ""Thanks, but this isn't what I'm asking for"".  All I try and fucking do is be nice and kind to people to try and feel better about myself and all I get is rudeness of dicks like you.  Why are you being like this?  Like really. I've done nothing wrong.   Fucking pretentious bastards make me wonder why I try and help and be nice to random people.  I don't have to be nice and try and help people, but I choose too, because I'm not a dick.   You don't have to be a dick either. Really, a simple ""thanks, but not related"" would have done just fine, but no, you choose to go the ole' argumentative way like I insulted your family."

lifeisstrange,3b48zw,CahueteAvenger,4,Thu Jun 25 21:41:30 2015 UTC,"Doesn't work that way. She cannot switch between different universes, the most plausible theory is that qhe goes back in time, changes something, and that change creates a whole new universe.

lifeisstrange,3b2pyl,Enverex,6,Thu Jun 25 14:31:08 2015 UTC,"The only times this isn't true is when you take a picture of Victoria to make fun of her and when you take a picture of David for evidence.   This really confused me because the game outright stated anything you have, you keep when you turn back time. So I took the photo of David being an ass to Kate, rewound and intervened, but then Max kept saying about how she didn't have a picture as evidence.  Why does the core rule of the game not apply in that specific situation?"
lifeisstrange,3b2pyl,Falshane,3,Thu Jun 25 17:08:12 2015 UTC,Probably because storytelling constraints and possibly getting written before the mechanics were ironed out.
lifeisstrange,3b2pyl,phordant,5,Thu Jun 25 21:29:14 2015 UTC,"Any story that involves time travel inherently comes with a handful of ""Why wouldn't 'person' just do this instead and live like a king with little to no recourse?"" Life is Strange is no different. They just take the approach that Max is too good of a person to do that sort of thing, or just too preoccupied."
lifeisstrange,3b2pyl,Erstwhile_Muse,6,Thu Jun 25 21:58:54 2015 UTC,"I'd say it definitely isn't something she'd do, but who knows? I'd say she's definitely changing as a person as the week goes on. The shy girl that was scared to get called on in class we started with on Monday attempts to use a gun on Tuesday and breaks into a pool Wednesday."
lifeisstrange,3b2pyl,AwesomeDewey,2,Thu Jun 25 16:52:28 2015 UTC,"It pains me to say this, but, Max seems pretty average for an 18-year old. She hasn't clued in to the physics defying issues and questions her ability raises, so she probably hasn't considered the ""exploits"" open to her. If she has, she may well have dismissed them out of hand for fear of supernatural consequences."
lifeisstrange,3b2pyl,MaxMOrz,4,Thu Jun 25 17:30:58 2015 UTC,"Well, let's be honest, it's been a hectic three days. Even the night of her ""all-nighter"" rewinding and reading binge she likely had other things on her mind than how to abuse her powers for profit."
lifeisstrange,3b2pyl,hozhenhao123,2,Thu Jun 25 17:59:29 2015 UTC,"Let's face it once and for all, there's one domain where this power would be a total gamechanger, and that's sex.  It weirds me off to think about the possibilities and ethics of sex and time travel. You could easily develop an entire new kink based on some magic-like kind of domination (through mind reading), but the time traveller is alone; sure, Max could groundhog the perfect night for her partner, but she would probably feel weird in the process, a special kind of egoism, and probably a bit rapey with the trials and errors.  With perfect control down to the millisecond, Max could achieve some things using teleportation-style travel; kissing two place at the same time for instance, at T=0ms, kiss cheek, kiss shoulder, rewing to T=1ms while still kissing shoulder, kiss cheek back, rewind to T=2ms while still kissing cheek etc... she could generate a very quick cycle of sensations for her partner that would be undistinguishable from being kissed on both cheek and shoulder at the same time.  With even more control things could get crazy real fast for her partner, though it might be a lot of work for Max. Maybe a good one-of trick to do to her special person once in a while.  I need to think about it."
lifeisstrange,3b2pyl,FilmingMachine,3,Thu Jun 25 19:56:22 2015 UTC,Yes. Yesssss. Let the kink flow through you.   All I can say is Max is in for one hell of a lifetime and Chloe better learn some gratitude to her future overlady.
lifeisstrange,3b3fz0,Gopasson,19,Thu Jun 25 17:32:47 2015 UTC,"I'm finding it hard to picture a different protagonist other than Max.  She is absolutely perfect for Life Is Strange, the way she looks, acts, personality, even if they do go down the route of new characters, I'm very interested in what ideas Dontnod has planned  I know Dontnod could easily prove me wrong, but I don't feel as if a Male protagonist, or another female with a different personality could pull off the overall feeling LIS gives. But it also wouldn't be the same with another character with a similar personality to Max.  Guess I'm just not ready to let go of Max, but to me it's her personality that makes up LIS"
lifeisstrange,3b3fz0,HelloCringle,5,Thu Jun 25 18:49:47 2015 UTC,"I also think it would be kind of hard to believe another person has the power Max has (assuming the new character would have that, seeing how it's a central part of the story). I personally think it would be cool to see a brand new game. As much as I love LIS, I think it needs to end when Max and Chloe's story ends."
lifeisstrange,3b3fz0,Glitcher9,4,Thu Jun 25 20:24:30 2015 UTC,"The thought of LiS ending has made me cry multiple times in the past, but I really wouldn't like a season 2 if it was with new characters tbh. There's such a focus on Max- and Max/Chloe's relationship - in comparison to just about every character put together that it just wouldn't feel right, especially since we've gotten to know this world through Max's direct thoughts and feelings - not as some omniscient or uninvolved observer. I feel like I'm on the minority on this but ah well. I don't want Life is Strange to end but I also don't like the idea of playing as someone other than Max/getting to know a completely new cast. ;-; Too attached."
lifeisstrange,3b3fz0,solas29,2,Thu Jun 25 20:39:16 2015 UTC,I completely agree with you.
lifeisstrange,3b3fz0,EcoleBuissonniere,2,Thu Jun 25 21:19:24 2015 UTC,"Probably a contrast to Max, someone who is a bit agressive, and angsty due to bad stuff that happened (kinda like Chloe), who has a very black and white picture of the world, maybe becomes a bit anti hero in the first episodes, until he figures out, that even the bad persons have got their cross to carry, and he then tries to make things better..."
lifeisstrange,3b3fz0,etriangel,5,Thu Jun 25 19:24:39 2015 UTC,"Someone with a personality opposite of Max will, trust me, NOT be able to be the main protagonist in a game like LiS.  The main thing about the game is choices and how hard it is to make them. Someone shy like Max is a perfect main character in a game that's so heavily choice based because a shy and cautious personality is perfect for the main protagonist and he/she will NEVER be able to decide what to do. Think about it. A ""histerical"" rock full of action character will always choose the more action-lively choice (shoot Frank, steal the money etc.), basically do anything what Chloe would want Max to do. That lively personality will make the game EXTREMELY one sided and boring. A cautious personality will always think stuff through and give the game the spirit it needs; not sure what to do, always second-guessing yourself."
lifeisstrange,3b3fz0,Ara-Player,2,Thu Jun 25 19:35:28 2015 UTC,"IMHO, the charakter is not that important for a choice based game, it is more the setting that the charakter is in, when you are completly honest even the charakter of max gives the player limitations to the choice the player can make, for example the people who are creeped out by Warren don't have the option to tell him to stay the hell away from you.  The choices with such a chracter would just need a different setting, but it would be possible, just because the character is more impulsive it does not mean there are no choices the charakter can make.. =)"
lifeisstrange,3b3fz0,etriangel,0,Fri Jun 26 00:09:19 2015 UTC,"So you are saying impulsive people are one sided, 1 dimensional characters? Okay."
lifeisstrange,3b3fz0,chattypenguin,1 point,Thu Jun 25 20:01:15 2015 UTC,"No. You got me completely wrong. I'm saying cautious people will think more and are more suitable to be ""torn between 2 choices"" rather than impulsive people."
lifeisstrange,3b3fz0,Ara-Player,1 point,Fri Jun 26 15:24:02 2015 UTC,"How would you know that? Impulsive people just make quick choices, so you'd have less time to make the choice. If anything it would be more challenging."
lifeisstrange,3b3fz0,chattypenguin,2,Fri Jun 26 16:53:13 2015 UTC,"That's basically how The Legend of Korra was written, to contrast with its predecessor Avatar: The Last Airbender.

I believe the generally female items he's got in his storehouse are there for a reason as part of the game.  They change at some point, meaning he's actively involving himself in them. Why, I'm not sure.  I just feel like he is not included in theories nearly enough and I'd like to know what reddit thinks. I've even thought perhaps he is the guy Rachel is afraid to tell Chloe about because she'll think it's gross. but maybe that's too wack for LiS.  If so though,  it speaks volumes of the relation between Twin Peaks and LiS"

They're just two people stuck in a story, a story that was written with a beginning and an end. It's completed on Dontnod's end, it just needs to be made into the game. To feature Max and Chloe in a season 2 of Life is Strange would be kind of silly (in my opinion). It ruins the whole point of the game and takes away the satisfaction of getting to the bottom of it.   This isn't the type of game to have a continuation. This is a one-shot. Instead of comparing Life is Strange to a video game, compare it to a novel. There are tons of novels that use a different cast of characters in each book of it's series. They're more of a chronicle that tells the tales of different people but all have a common theme."

Ever. (Except Lazlow, who's a radio host), prior to this, GTA protags had cameos, such as Claude in GTA SA and Toni Cipriani in GTA 3.    Call of Duty: Black Ops 2: Zombies (for the most part)   At the end of Black Ops 1 zombies, we're left with a huge cliff hanger as the main characters are stuck on the Moon as Richtofen became ""leader"" of the zombies.   In Black Ops 2 zombies, there is NO mention of them at all. Except Richtofen, because he's the announcer.   But, in every single map no mention of the original characters from WaW and BO1. Except for the final DLC map, where it's not even them. Completely different personalities and NO explanation as to what happened to them, as the map they feature in is set in 1918!   Spyro The Dragon   A bit complex, but the PS1 era Spyro games had a very memorable cast.  In 2006 with the release of ""The Legend of Spyro: A New Beginning"", EVERY recurring character in the Spyro series, except Spyro and Sparx were abolished.   It took until ""Dawn Of the Dragon"" for one of the ""main"" cast members to return, but he was completely different. He wasn't the fun-bumbling idiot from the PS1 games. He was smart and wise.

lifeisstrange,3azs6k,EcoleBuissonniere,22,Wed Jun 24 23:17:36 2015 UTC,"This makes the most sense. Having a second season be a direct continuation would limit the number of possibilities for the ending of Season 1. And that's something we see with almost every game series in which in-game choices carry over from one game of the series to the next.  And while I'll hate to say goodbye to Max and Chloe, I hate the idea of the ending being shaped due to a second season. Even if there would still be multiple endings, they would still have to be similar enough that Season 2 could follow any of them."
lifeisstrange,3azs6k,crawlywhat,11,Wed Jun 24 23:41:28 2015 UTC,"Lots of ""but noooo, I want more Max and Chloe!"" here. I won't say it's not understandable, everybody wants more of something they love, but it's the worst kind of thinking to fall into. What you really want is more quality storytelling. How you were made to love these characters to begin, that's the magic you want more of. And if a creator is ballsy enough to recognize that and oblige, then good on them. Lord knows we have enough stale properties in gaming as it is.  Making more of the same is boring, safe, and stifling, and, think about for a moment -- if they only did ""more of the same"", we never would have gotten Max and Chloe to begin with. Wherever the story is, that's where they should go. If that's with Max and Chloe, awesome. If it's not, then so be it, and hopefully the next project is just as successful and beloved."
lifeisstrange,3azs6k,EcoleBuissonniere,1 point,Thu Jun 25 00:07:41 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I think what they're saying is they'd be happy to make another game like this one, rather than immediately moving on from Vampyr to something entirely new. I think new characters is great news because a) it means the story is going to wrap up, surely awesomely and b) more female characters especially would be great!"
lifeisstrange,3azs6k,BobMugabe35,12,Thu Jun 25 00:22:55 2015 UTC,I know it makes sense and it's a good idea but I hate the idea of losing Max and Chloe.
lifeisstrange,3azs6k,SnobbyLion,6,Wed Jun 24 21:23:04 2015 UTC,"I think it depends on how well these new characters are formed. No re-hashes of the previous ones, or at the very least, a main character with a very different personality than Max's to make the story feel different enough. The overall original mood of the game still has to be there though.   Also, Cameos and continued storylines from Season 1 would be awesome. This means that while your character might not have been there during the choices in Season 1, the effects of them are still seen in Season 2."
lifeisstrange,3azs6k,crawlywhat,4,Wed Jun 24 22:13:40 2015 UTC,"I feel sad about this, but it makes sense. The story feels like a complete whole and when the final credits roll, the fundamental justification for it will cease to exist imo. There will be no reason to continue with the same characters except to turn it into something else entirely.  Something that lacks the intricately crafted detail and interconnectedness that makes it all so mesmerising.   Something like a soap. It's not a soap. It's much much more ambitious than that, and to try and spin it out in that way would be a fairly ignominious end for these characters. (even if I would personally buy it in a heartbeat)  The only other alternative would have been to try and stretch it out. I would have been happy with that too, but again, it's not really the right thing to do by people who have invested in the game and expect a meaningful resolution in 5 episodes.   I'm not going to pretend to know exactly how it's going to end, but I'm pretty sure that when the credits roll down the screen like the tears down your face, it will be fairly obvious why there can be no season 2 continuation. Not without making a mockery of what it was.  It's a credit to Dontnod that they haven't tried to cash in here."
lifeisstrange,3azs6k,zeCrazyEye,25,Thu Jun 25 03:54:04 2015 UTC,"I really don't like that, to be honest. What makes this game so great for me is its characters, Max and Chloe especially. To lose them would be to lose the real heart of the game."

I think trying to find new stories for old characters hinders the story and the characters end up suffering for it.  I see it in comics a lot.. compare the well defined stories with fresh characters and no continuity baggage in the current Image comics like Saga, versus the pointless storytelling and mangled characterizations in Marvel/DC as heroes get reused over and over.  Max and Chloe are great characters because they are characters written for this story and this story is written for these characters."

It means that they have thought this story through from beginning to end, and that it'll reach a (hopefully) satisfying conclusion.

lifeisstrange,3azs6k,poppyuppy33,3,Wed Jun 24 22:10:39 2015 UTC,"I think the time-rewinding mechanic is really great from a storytelling perspective. Being able to see multiple paths through the dialogue tree is fun. And, showing how characters react differently to different options can give characterization in a way that linear conversations can't.  I think it would probably improve most adventure games for me -- except it wouldn't make sense with most plots and settings. I hope the new season builds the same mechanic into a different setting."
lifeisstrange,3azs6k,SkateboardCop,3,Thu Jun 25 00:19:58 2015 UTC,"Though this news made me really sad, as I am one of those people who clamor for a direct continuation of Max and Chloe's story, if this is what DONTNOD believes is for the best, then I'll respect their decision. I wonder if it would be too much to ask for a DLC or two though? Something that's still about them, hopefully like what someone else said before me: the pair's adventure in Portland and maybe even stuff about what happened to the rest of the students that go to Blackwell?  Oh goodness, this is heartbreak for me right now. If they end up doing a direct continuation though, meaning them not going with their ""likely"" statement, my jaw would have to be picked up from the floor because of glee, relief, and shock, taking all the stuff in because of the heartache I went through due to this article xD."

One thing that always happens when show's change casts every season (or every two seasons, like with Skins) is that you grow to love one cast/season a LOT and then nothing really ever feels as good in comparison -- and you ALWAYS end up comparing them, which leads to people fighting in fandom, and Idk, it's just not a good time in general."
lifeisstrange,3azs6k,ward0630,2,Wed Jun 24 22:33:07 2015 UTC,Welp. There's always fanart and fanfiction to fill the empty void in my heart when it comes...

lifeisstrange,3b1ayw,Deggyy,3,Thu Jun 25 04:08:51 2015 UTC,"Currently playing it. Bought on steam summer sale for $5.  Graphics are much more refined, but I guess a cyberpunk action game needs sharp HD graphics and an Oregonian high school drama wanted an acrylic paint style.  Gameplay is like arkham asylum in terms of combat. Platforming is a linear assassin's creed.  It's enjoyable so far, but it feels like a completely different game."
lifeisstrange,3b1ayw,Lichtsprecher,2,Thu Jun 25 08:42:03 2015 UTC,"Well, it is a completely different game. I just felt like the things Dontnod cares about, good story, rich characters, and a touch of moral ambiguity shine through in both games."
lifeisstrange,3b1ayw,Jxx,3,Thu Jun 25 12:42:49 2015 UTC,"i got it during the Steam Sale. also, does anyone notice that Olga Sedova looks alot like Victoria?"
lifeisstrange,3b1ayw,AERXihu,1 point,Thu Jun 25 12:17:43 2015 UTC,Yes! I thought Olga looked like Victoria all grown up (and with some cool piercings).
lifeisstrange,3b1ayw,Forrester96,2,Thu Jun 25 12:41:19 2015 UTC,This is what im trying to say yet no one believes me. She looks exactly like her.  Go away Victoria there is no Max in the future!
lifeisstrange,3b1ayw,AlmightyKerfuffle,2,Fri Jun 26 19:49:05 2015 UTC,"Remember Me is definitely an underrated cyberpunk game. For me, this game is really unique and different from most cyberpunk games. It introduced Memory Remix, a creatively unique game mechanic that allow you to tweak certain people's memory. This is where the basis of time rewind mechanic for Life is Strange is created.   The plot is pretty good and it contains some plot twist during the third act of the plot and it holds up to its title. The character development is quite okay as it revealed to us more during the gameplay.  The problem is, I felt that this game is only worth a single playthrough. But, it was enjoyable as it has a puzzle level, a nifty combat mechanic and some pretty darn good enemies NPC.   Go buy it, worth your 5 bucks on Steam summer sale right now. :)"
lifeisstrange,3b1ayw,Krra_,2,Thu Jun 25 13:17:26 2015 UTC,"I remember playing the game and loving the memory remix mechanic, wishing it had a more major role. And with Life is Strange, they made an entire game around that mechanic."
lifeisstrange,3b1ayw,kemando,2,Thu Jun 25 14:48:46 2015 UTC,I played this just after it can out. I was absolutely in love with it. The story and how Nilin uses mindbending to manipulate the future is amazing. Both Remember Me and LiS have an amazing way of creating their own unique piece of art. Both games are part of my top 10 games list.  I absolutely recommend trying Remember Me to LiS fans.
lifeisstrange,3b1ayw,jessebona,3,Sat Jun 27 02:07:12 2015 UTC,"It was okay, I enjoyed it enough for what I paid (but I bought it last summer on Steam sale, I think it was like 8 dollars). I got frustrated at times, but it was an alright game.  I definitely didn't enjoy it half as much as Life is Strange though, I also found most of the characters forgettable and bland, even our main heroine Nillin. The game was also really short, took me 9 hours on I think medium or hard."
lifeisstrange,3b1ayw,Ruddy_Congo,1 point,Thu Jun 25 05:35:10 2015 UTC,I've just gotten past the opening and while I don't particularly enjoy the combat it doesn't seem too bad so far.
lifeisstrange,3b1ayw,ward0630,1 point,Thu Jun 25 12:55:39 2015 UTC,The lastname Wells is featured in both games which might mean something.
lifeisstrange,3b1ayw,HelmutVillam,1 point,Fri Jun 26 09:20:37 2015 UTC,"I bought this way back when it first came out, mainly because the memory changing mechanic sounded so good. Unfortunately, there's only 4 such sequences in the entire game, and the rest of it is a fairly weak story and average gameplay mechanics.  You can definitely see the foundations of Life is Strange in there, though. Also it might be more enjoyable if you only shell out $10 for it."
lifeisstrange,3b1ayw,Geracir,1 point,Thu Jun 25 06:20:13 2015 UTC,"Not everything had to be open world... The level design in the game was fantastic and clearly a lot of effort was put in to make the player see all this detail as they went through... open world would destroy that, just like it would in life us strange if they let us walk around the entire Arcadia Bay from the outset."
lifeisstrange,3b1ayw,Falshane,1 point,Thu Jun 25 08:41:06 2015 UTC,"I agree, and I've heard this was the fault of Capcom, who didn't give Dontnod the finding they needed for a larger project. But, that's unsubstantiated."
lifeisstrange,3b1ayw,Enverex,1 point,Thu Jun 25 10:47:29 2015 UTC,"I think the custom combos made it very not-button-mashy. I'd use different combos depending on what I needed. I had one power combo, a healing combo, and a cool down combo. Using them together, I'd constantly have to switch between them and dodging. A lot of dodging."
lifeisstrange,3b1ayw,Falshane,0,Thu Jun 25 12:43:41 2015 UTC,"Played it at release. Some incredible ideas in it and a story that was really interesting and thought-provoking. Gameplay prevented it from being an excellent game, but it's one of those games where if you like it, you really like it despite its faults. Much of what I enjoy with Life is strange can be seen in Remember me when it comes to desgin philosophy. I agree that it is worth trying out, but be prepared for some clunky combat elements."
lifeisstrange,3b1ayw,AERXihu,0,Thu Jun 25 14:18:00 2015 UTC,The main character also looks exactly like a slightly older Max. Because originality is hard.
lifeisstrange,3b1ayw,Falshane,1 point,Thu Jun 25 14:20:04 2015 UTC,I wouldn't go that far. Very different facial structure and hair. Although Nilin does appear to have some light freckling.

lifeisstrange,3b1qgk,TheNathanNS,2,Thu Jun 25 09:55:53 2015 UTC,"Yeah, much like mysterious toilet paper throwing girl—of whom much was made in weeks past—they are most likely just crowd filler models of no particular importance to Max's story."
lifeisstrange,3b1qgk,Erstwhile_Muse,7,Thu Jun 25 18:49:31 2015 UTC,I think they are just filler characters.

lifeisstrange,3az9jl,NotMeeh,26,Wed Jun 24 18:18:50 2015 UTC,"We sure will have to talk to the ""new"" Chloe. The problem is... I don't want to. This isn't the Chloe I know, the one I talked to (and kissed) in the last three episodes... I'll probably end up tearing up while talking to her, but that's probably all we're going to do in the first ten/twenty minutes. I honestly would just rewind as soon as possible and undo this timeline tho :("
lifeisstrange,3az9jl,5kyLegend,6,Wed Jun 24 20:24:57 2015 UTC,"Can she still talk? there was something in her throat. Man, this episode is so full of feels, I was so fucking happy when I saw all the photos change to happier ones, but then shit started going downhill. Friends with the assholes, Warren with someone else, then Chloe...."
lifeisstrange,3az9jl,EpicSalmon,5,Thu Jun 25 14:23:46 2015 UTC,"I honestly hope she can't talk. Not to be mean to Chloe (cause I love her <3) but because I don't want to know this version of her. She exists just because of our actions, I don't want to get to know someone who... Shouldn't exist. I can't explain this very well, hopefully you get what I'm trying to say"
lifeisstrange,3az9jl,5kyLegend,2,Thu Jun 25 19:36:34 2015 UTC,"yeah that makes sense, it probably start in her living room or something"
lifeisstrange,3az9jl,hozhenhao123,28,Thu Jun 25 02:08:40 2015 UTC,Maybe some exploration of alternate timeline and after it we will back to original timeline.
lifeisstrange,3az9jl,konrad5558,15,Wed Jun 24 19:05:48 2015 UTC,I hope so ...
lifeisstrange,3az9jl,LovelyMagickUnicorn,11,Wed Jun 24 20:33:30 2015 UTC,"Assuming that Max still has the old photo of her and Chloe as teens, I'm guessing that Max will try and fail to use it to go back change things to how they were. Possibly her powers a blocked, if only slightly, due to her feelings.  The fact that she in fact saved William, at the cost of Chloe's ability to walk and several other consequences, makes it so that Max's heart isn't fully into trying to change things back.  Or maybe she doesn't even try to initially change things back because it's one thing to let William die, but to let him die knowing full well that you can save him... that's another thing entirely."
lifeisstrange,3az9jl,poompt,3,Wed Jun 24 18:42:58 2015 UTC,"I really hope that we get to choose, even if it's at the very end (so we get to see how our choices so far pan out in the meantime)"
lifeisstrange,3az9jl,Ara-Player,2,Thu Jun 25 02:06:59 2015 UTC,"It would be sorta interesting if in EP4 we would get a choice like [go back, let William die] or [explore around], assuming Max will be given only ONE chance to go back."
lifeisstrange,3az9jl,nso09,1 point,Thu Jun 25 09:49:37 2015 UTC,"The first scenario is what I want to happen... I assume it has to do with the photo I took in the past. I just can't help knowing Chloe is disabled. BUT the fact that she has a smile on her face kinda sets me on the edge. She's disabled, BUT she's happy. On the other hand, she's functional, normal, healthy(probably not in the respiratory and digestive system) BUT she's detested in the world and how people ""let her down"" all the time. It's mad complicated but my heart wants to return things back to where they were."
lifeisstrange,3az9jl,hyukifu,10,Thu Jun 25 05:40:33 2015 UTC,I think she is going to find more answers in the new timeline
lifeisstrange,3az9jl,ububen,16,Wed Jun 24 19:27:50 2015 UTC,"I feel like It will start off in Chloe's house in the new dimension, you have a conversation with her (if she can speak) and William. Maybe find out about the accident and whether Joyce is Alive/Dead. Then I think Max will go to the bathroom and maybe take a selfie. This will be a route back to the new dimension if she ever needs to go back. Max might change between the dimensions throughout the last 2 episodes."
lifeisstrange,3az9jl,85_squats,4,Wed Jun 24 19:09:44 2015 UTC,"I like that theory, I'm going to keep this one in mind... but it doesnt make much sense to me because she can't move past the photograph's boundaries, so she'd be stuck in the bathroom."
lifeisstrange,3az9jl,ububen,2,Wed Jun 24 21:54:25 2015 UTC,"Yeah, good point. However, There arent any photgraphic Boundaries in this timeline if she can go from the school to Chloe's house."
lifeisstrange,3az9jl,asofter,1 point,Thu Jun 25 05:42:54 2015 UTC,But she didn't get to this universe by going through the photo. She returned to a changed universe because of the actions she made in the photo.
lifeisstrange,3az9jl,Ara-Player,1 point,Thu Jun 25 17:53:52 2015 UTC,"As 85_squats said, you would be stuck in the bathroom if you did that. In fact, I believe if you took the photo of Chloe and Will (second to last minor choice in EP3) you could in the future go back AGAIN and now make Will die if you mess something up."
lifeisstrange,3az9jl,wHatTheFez,1 point,Thu Jun 25 09:52:23 2015 UTC,"That's what makes the optional photo in the alternate timeline (where william is alive) so interesting to me, because that would split everyone's playthroughs in half, but because of the episodic model, I doubt they would end up doing two separate story-lines, too much work for dontnod, If they did, the episode would take twice as much time to come out, which I wouldn't be able to deal with."
lifeisstrange,3az9jl,TDurandal,6,Fri Jun 26 04:29:18 2015 UTC,"Maybe it starts on the beach in the alt timeline to begin with and alt-Frank is a nice dude and we play beach games with him, his alt-dog and alt-Chloe and her hella badass wheelchair complete with beach volleyball playing power! Or Yknow, super serious stuff like finding a way to get back and find Rachel and stuff..."
lifeisstrange,3az9jl,Ara-Player,2,Thu Jun 25 07:57:16 2015 UTC,THAT'S a cool theory. I will keep that in mind at the back of my head.
lifeisstrange,3az9jl,Ara-Player,3,Thu Jun 25 09:53:50 2015 UTC,While the opening music plays (which I think is going to be Mountains by Message to bears) William will invite Max in the house(and not explain anything about Chloe like Max already knows about her) and Max will explore around it until she talks to Chloe.
lifeisstrange,3az9jl,SilverEyepatch,2,Thu Jun 25 09:46:37 2015 UTC,"I think the first few minutes are going to be dedicated to returing to the original timeline with some possible consequences. Also, since we've seen the Vortex party in the preview then maybe it's possible that Max is going to return to a point in the original timeline using her newly found power to go back to a different scene. This power might also work on things like videos as well as photos meaning Max would be able to travel back to when Kate was at the vortex party and find out what really happened with Nathan/Kate etc."
lifeisstrange,3az9jl,Dedexy,2,Thu Jun 25 12:57:04 2015 UTC,I guess she won't want to go back and make Max's dad dying immediatly. But she will at some point and then investigate at the Vortex Club party.  I think it's pretty safe to say that. But then I don't know. It could go in many differents directions.

lifeisstrange,3az9jl,Spider-Vice,1 point,Thu Jun 25 12:07:38 2015 UTC,"Yeah I think it will definitely start in Chloe's house. Max then has to find a way to take a picture in case she ever wants to go back to the alt-dimension, OR use the drawing in the fireplace (if you made it) to go back and let William die (could be a new mechanic, and maybe the Holes To Another Universe could be used as well)."

I highly doubt this. I actually think we will spend time in the alternate timeline and then go into the timeline we know of. (Im not saying original timeline because there can be multiple timelines we don't even know about due to Max rewinding time, in which case we wouldn't know what is the original timeline considering the ""original timeline"" is just an alternate timeline created due to a different action Max made. For example her rewinding time to save Chloe is a total alternate timeline. Letting Chloe die is the original timeline.)"
lifeisstrange,3az9jl,renMilestone,0,Fri Jun 26 04:12:24 2015 UTC,Pretty sure the alternate timeline is going to be the one with the hurricane. So I think she will stay in this timeline and probably immediately explain to !Chloe that she has the power and then stay there for the next 2 episodes before going back to her main timeline when she took the selfie.

lifeisstrange,3ax3r8,HelpIsPrecious,14,Wed Jun 24 05:08:05 2015 UTC,"I think mental illnesses and people suffering from them often go unnoticed. Sometimes, we may even have a sense of invulnerability. ""Psh it would never happen to me or the people around me.""   Having stories like Life is Strange, like you said, tells a narrative, one that can open the eyes of both parties. Of the person who is depressed, for example, and the people around them and who care about them.   It can be hard to understand how depression or anxiety or other mental illnesses feel unless you have experienced them first hand because of how different individuals think and how different each person's reality can be.   People think it is trivial to put so much weight into stories and characters in a game, movie or TV show. But our perception of the world is built around the media we consume. I think this way we all know that mental illnesses can happen to anyone and it is as debilitating as any other illness.  People understand more about what they are going through and people around them understand more about what their loved ones are going through. Another step in removing the stigma of mental illnesses and seeking treatment for mental illnesses.   More knowledge, more understanding, more care therefore higher recovery rates and profit???  TL;DR Narratives are hella important. And thank you for sharing, OP!"
lifeisstrange,3ax3r8,safelywittyname,7,Wed Jun 24 05:51:25 2015 UTC,"I know exactly how you feel.  One of the main reasons Kate is my favorite character is because she's so relatable and real.   So many people are going through the same thing as Kate. Be it a video, a picture or other. People out there need help and friends. But people choose to harass them and make fun of them rather than leaving them alone.   That actually reminds me of a Youtube comment I saw on the EP2 ending. ""People care more for you when you're dead and gone, rather than alive and struggling.""  And also it shows how people ""don't care"".  No one in the game even tries to help Kate. Only Max does.  Maybe Madsen was being a bit ""tough"" as he only know Kate via the video. Which would explain why he thinks she's a druggie.    Jefferson point blank refused to help her when she needed it the most.   Nathan and the rest of the Vortex Club were the ones who ""ruined her"".   Even Kate's family (except for her father) ""disown"" her rather than try to help her through hell.   In the ""Save Kate"" ending, she ends up in the hospital with 3 balloons saying ""Get well"" on them. Presumably from her father.   In the ""Kate dies"" ending, everyone at Blackwell Academy seems to write ""We'll miss you Kate!"" and make posts on her (presumably) Facebook wall.   As Max says ""so much hypocrite"" when you look at Kate's slate in EP3. Even Victoria, the one who bullied her, writes ""we'll miss you"".   Just like IRL, they're probably only writing that so they don't look like a complete jerk."
lifeisstrange,3ax3r8,TheNathanNS,2,Wed Jun 24 10:22:50 2015 UTC,"Thanks for reading.  To be fair, though they might not miss her, they would definitely feel a huge impact, especially Victoria. She probably realized that her bullying was a major contribution that drove Kate to suicide, and we can see hints of this in the aftermath, when she's holding her head in her room. A suicide affects a lot of people, if only for the implications of it. That's why you hear so many people saying ""I didn't know she was that screwed up"" in the aftermath. People like Taylor and Victoria realized what they contributed to, and people like Dana started feeling like they could have spoke up and said something.  I don't feel like everyone who wrote something as a memorial/in support of Kate were just doing it to not to look like a jerk. It just seems like the easiest way to channel the emotions from dealing with the implications in a common and collective way."
lifeisstrange,3ax3r8,White000,7,Wed Jun 24 15:12:50 2015 UTC,"Amazing read. This is something I always think about writing when I see a moment like that in gaming or just in media in general. But I never do, because I don't want to sound ""whiny"" (as you've said) or pretentious. Yet it is all true. What you've said is completely true and people might not understand it, but it is real.   I am really impressed how well this game deals with heavy subjects. Some people might say that it forces the player into those situation, that they don't care, but those exact situations happen in the real world too. The difference is that in the real world you saying that you don't care will hurt the people around you.   I was actually really surprised how many people didn't manage to save Kate. It's a thought that I come back to every once in a while. Since I've been there too (as Kate), seeing the percentage on that choice scares me. It honestly does. I've heard a lot of things that, in the game, would lead to Kate's suicide. I've heard them from ""friends"", ""family"", teachers, doctors, even psychiatrists. I think we should talk about situations like this. Show them a lot more. Teach people how to deal with them. How to act. How to prevent things like that. How to care. Life is Strange is a step in the right direction. And I love DONTNOD for that.   And of course, good luck and best wishes to you, OP. A huge virtual hug too!"
lifeisstrange,3ax3r8,White000,1 point,Wed Jun 24 07:48:43 2015 UTC,"Thanks for reading.  In terms of avoiding the ""whiny"" perspective, I find that it's best to keep the post going back to the topic at hand, so in this case, the game itself, and how to deal with mental illnesses. Anything I say about my problems should be an anecdote to support that. (Somehow, I had flashbacks to high school essay writing as I typed that xD)   You're right; I've watched a few Let's Plays, and it's extremely frustrating for me to watch some people giving the wrong responses, especially if they thought that it made sense. For the people who couldn't manage to save her on their first try, and especially those who thought it made sense, I feel like it would be very helpful to them to truly try to empathize and understand what someone like Kate is going through. Hopefully, this game has helped someone through that."

I really love reading posts like yours, it brightens my day just seeing that people find the same comfort as I do in this game. Or any game for that matter and any fictional or non-fictional character people can relate to.    For the people who couldn't manage to save her on their first try, and especially those who thought it made sense, I feel like it would be very helpful to them to truly try to empathize and understand what someone like Kate is going through.

lifeisstrange,3ax3r8,td260,3,Wed Jun 24 15:13:09 2015 UTC,"I love that I am not alone in feeling all this.  I too just like you have a had rought times these 2-3 years, I lost a really good friend who committed suicide, we have had financial problems at home and I have had a really depressed time.  It only once came close to suicidal thoughts and I am glad for one of my cousins who really helped me through that instantly before thoughts became reality. Finally when I saw her in NYC this Holiday when we timed our trips(we live in two different continents 😜) she was so freaking happy that I was feeling good again. There is a sebse of satisfaction of knowing that you pulled through and rethought about what you are doing and I think that helped me a lot.  So I totally understand your feelings about the game and about the Kate situation because I've been on both sides - the one trying to help and the one who was in need of help.  I was gutted for a week after that I failed Kate and my friends in my study group was getting really worried about how I was doing. I'm generally one of the happiest guys you can find around me so its pretty noticeable when I'm feeling down.  Either way I'm happy you shared your experience because I think LIS has meant a lot personally for me. There is something about a lot if the occurances in the game that I can apply to my own life that makes the game feel so genuine and not pretentious or fake.  Cant wait to see your EP.3 reaction because damn did that bring up feels with me.  As said previously if you want to PM about anything I'm pretty sure a lot of people in this sub including me would have a chat"

lifeisstrange,3ax3r8,FFaUniHan,2,Wed Jun 24 09:04:46 2015 UTC,"Totally true. Perhaps I could share the brief summary of my story?  I never got to that point of depression before. But, I know the feels.  ""No! You don't understand anything!!!""  Yes, I don't understand everything until I feel it myself. At least I showed my sympathies. Though none of this event had happened in around me yet, I simply become so emotionally involved (and rage at the Vortex Club, Mr. Madsen, and Mr. Jefferson) to the point that I sought to take bullying very seriously and pay close attention to any small signs of depression.  But, I need a little advice here as well, to make it perfect. If I'm a geek like Max and they perceived me as ""zoned out"" from the community, how could I help those who are top tier people? I don't want to receive any answer of ""trying and fail"""
lifeisstrange,3ax3r8,Anonymouso12,3,Wed Jun 24 10:31:33 2015 UTC,"Thanks for reading.  Like I said, the best thing you can do is, observe, empathize, and sympathize. Not only for Kate, but Max did so for people like Juliet, Taylor, and Dana. Of course, she had her rewind to her advantage, but you get to see their reactions when Max knows what's going on in their life. ""Wow Max, I didn't think you cared."" They showed vulnerability in these moments, and it's backed up by their voice actors.   The more you observe, the more you know and can later show that you care. You get good with observation, and you'll also be able to detect when might be a good time to ask.  Empathy is not the same as sympathy. Empathy means to be able to understand another persons feels by somehow feeling it yourself. Sympathy involves action to comfort someone. Both can be mutually exclusive, as a person can empathize but do nothing, or they can comfort someone yet not truly understand or feel what the other person is feeling. Some people are much better and more natural at these, but it can be a built up skill. The ability to effectively empathize helps you understand how the other person is interpreting what's happening or said to them. The ability to sympathize allows you to take action, even in the most subtle ways, and this can be a great relief to those who are hurting.  It's a combination of all of these that helps you save Kate (without a guide or an additional playthrough). You observe her room and learn about the things that are hurting her and the things that she likes. You empathize by realizing that she is hurting, and put her on priority (taking her call), and understanding how much the bullying and the video has affected her in the present (not giving the responses ""there are billions of videos"" or ""people will forget""). You sympathize by performing all those actions -  by talking with her, by believing her, by erasing the link and her slate, by saying all the things you know from observing and empathizing.  There's no real formula for how to deal with someone who needs help. I hope this was able to shed some light for you, though."

lifeisstrange,3aximu,BrickFudgingMaster,2,Thu Jun 25 07:01:13 2015 UTC,"I'm along your line of thinking. One of the first things that comes out of Chloe's mouth when Max tells her she can rewind time is  ""I see you're a geek with a great imagination but this isn't an anime or a video game"". Her first reaction is thinking that Max is being geeky and fantasizing about being a video game character (which is sooo silly, right?). I don't be too much of a stretch for anyone else would think the same thing."

lifeisstrange,3aximu,kemando,2,Wed Jun 24 17:43:22 2015 UTC,"The journal's written in such a way that it looks like she WANTS someone else to read it, it reads more like a narrative than a simple collection of thoughts, perhaps that's just her style, or for player convenience, but just a thought."
lifeisstrange,3aximu,Falshane,1 point,Thu Jun 25 05:41:05 2015 UTC,"Honestly, anyone who reads it would probably think it was some sci-fi story she was writing.

lifeisstrange,3awdhl,ditybear,6,Wed Jun 24 03:31:48 2015 UTC,"Yeah, me neither. I mean, it's certainly possible that Dontnod will expand the rules of time travel/manipulation in future episodes, but given what what we know now, the way time travel works is that Max has VHS controls for the world around her (Max being insulated from the manipulation of time herself), and her photo abilities could be interpreted as her rewinding really far back. If Rachel is a time traveler, and got lost somewhere in time, there would be a lot of questions that would have to be answered regarding conflicts between two people having control over the flow of time, rather than just traveling within it.  I'm not saying it's impossible, it could be a Highlander type deal, Max could concurrently be able to manipulate her current timeline and also travel to separate ones, or it could all just be handwaved given the fact that time travel in this game is nowhere near being a scientific phenomenon, but it wouldn't fit elegantly with the current established ""rules"" and would require some explanation."
lifeisstrange,3awdhl,pushingpacksnow,9,Wed Jun 24 17:46:08 2015 UTC,"Good job on the graph but I'm wondering what evidence is there that there are multiple timelines? Is this all speculation?

Do you think the tornado is caused by saving Chloe in the bathroom?"
lifeisstrange,3awdhl,SkateboardCop,3,Wed Jun 24 01:24:46 2015 UTC,"Yup, I'm pretty sure that so far multiple timelines are only a speculation. And yes, I believe the tornado is caused by Chloe not dying, hence Episode 3's title; Chaos Theory."

lifeisstrange,3awdhl,Ara-Player,1 point,Wed Jun 24 02:48:13 2015 UTC,Could be. There are so many possibilities and it's great to speculate. I hope Dontnod comes up with something crazy that'll blow our minds.

lifeisstrange,3awdhl,gybali,3,Wed Jun 24 07:25:15 2015 UTC,"There is actually some speculation that the tornado is caused because of Chloe. 2 reasons: 1) Max sees the tornado BEFORE the bathroom scene even happens. She time traveled to the future and then back, but lost her memories when she time traveled to the future. She is given the power before Chloe ""dies"". 2) Even if you don't warn Alyssa in EP1, she will still get hit by the toilet paper roll in EP2 and get wet in EP3. If the ""universe tries to correct itself"" theory is true then if you didn't help Alyssa in EP1 she wouldn't get hit by the toilet roll nor get wet."
