asianamerican,3e28gh,treskro,27,Tue Jul 21 11:53:32 2015 UTC,"This article seems to start off placing the onus of segregation on insecure Whites who are ""white flighting"" away from competitive Asian students. But then, the second half starts to talk about racist Asian AP Calc kids and how comfortable it was for Asians to self-segregate, which makes it seem as though it's the Asian students' fault.  It needed some kind of conclusion, even if it was a cop-outy ""It's both our faults.""  This line stood out to me:   ""White kids played football, smoked weed, and hooked up on the weekends. Asians studied and took Instagram photos at McDonald’s.""   Doesn't the the author think there's a reason for this divide? For all the complaining that White people do about affirmative action, they're not the ones hit hardest by it. That weed-smoking White kid who hooks up on the weekends, if all else were equal, still has a better shot than an Asian kid in college admissions. That White kid may also have a parent who's an alum or may play some niche, predominantly White sport that'll provide an inside path.  For Asian kids with immigrant parents, their grades and ECs are all they've got.  In other words, if one group is having all the fun and doing all the cool stuff, and the other group is not, which group do you think is more responsible for enforcing the exclusionary environment that results in ""self-segregation?"""
asianamerican,3e28gh,asiantemp,7,Tue Jul 21 12:59:05 2015 UTC,"For all the complaining that White people do about affirmative action, they're not the ones hit hardest by it.    White people are not affected by affirmative action at all. It's just Asians fighting Asians for the quota spots. While Jews get like 20% of admissions but no one ever says we need less Jewish diversity at Harvard (seriously, they make up like 2% of the pop and get like 20+% admissions, NO ONE ever says anything about it, WHY DO YOU THINK THAT IS?).   For Asian kids with immigrant parents, their grades and ECs are all they've got.   Exactly. That's the only thing that can be objectively measured between whites and Asians. What else is there? Holistic admissions based on ""leadership skills"" ""enthusiasm"" and everything else with a white tint so that the weed smoking white kid would get above hard working Asians.  There was a recent article on CNN from the leader of the 60+ Asian groups that sued Harvard. He used how like 45% of tech start ups are started by Asians to counter the Asians are ""not creative"" myth. You know what the comments were? A combination of ""Harvard should white"" and ""go back to china if you don't like it"".  In the end, there's plenty of AAs that are against affirmative actions, but only people like Jeff Yang and this dude gets to write for CNN or Slate magazine. Sure, the dude is Asian, but the dude that tells him what to write is white. It's an ""opinion piece"". Funny how all the AAs in mainstream media seem to blame AAs for everything.  It's the same shit over and over again. Blah blah, blame Asians, blah blah blah, lazy white kids deserve better.  Diversity, diversity, diversity. Asian Americans willing to step on their own kind for the sake of ""diversity"" when they don't even know what the fuck diversity is."

The quotas used to be applied to Jews, but now they're influential enough (and white passing) that they suffer no penalty in admissions.  The same stereotypes applied to Jews back in the day are now applied to us in an organized effort to racially discriminate against Asian students."

The point is that, while I agree that elite college admissions are structurally discriminatory against Asian Americans, the idea that we are uniquely discriminated against in a way that no one ever has been is not true and is a little scary."
asianamerican,3e28gh,allhailkodos,5,Tue Jul 21 23:51:49 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure what the conclusion of the article is.  Asian kids go to school dominated by asians and that's a problem because   ???  The author is focusing on the asian kids who do well in school exclusively,  almost to the point where he is trying to perpetuate the asian student stereotype to the white readers but what about the ones that don't?  Even if your school is dominated by asians, unless you're in a specialized school for advanced placement students,    i assure you most of them are not in advance placement classes.  How did they fit in?   I just don't get this article."
asianamerican,3e28gh,one80to1,8,Tue Jul 21 23:49:38 2015 UTC,"This is  a complete divergence of what we pre-Silicon Valley Boom Asians experienced from those of the more recently arrived Asians, completely not suggesting one is better than the other. I grew up on the Peninsula in the '80s (right when the Chinese wave from Taiwan and Hong Kong were arriving, and when Japanese corporations were sending executives and their families to the U.S.), where Asians in general were a much smaller proportion of the population, so most of my friends growing up were White, and it wasn't until I went to high school that I started making Asian (mostly Chinese) friends, which I thought was absolutely great. We did well academically (most of us in AP classes and at the upper 10 percent of the classes in terms of G.P.A.), weren't completely absent from school sports (I did track and gymnastics while one Asian friend was on the football team, and a bunch of us would go on the student organized ski trips), and we socialized pretty freely with everyone else (I worked at a local liquor store, owned by my Chinese friend's mom, so pretty much made the party rounds). But, at least for me, there was something of a gulf as it pertained to dating, in which I felt a lot more constrained about which girls I'd realistically be able to elicit interest and date; this turned out to be a lot more inflated in my mind, but it was still there and not imagined. We Asian guys pretty much took as a given that we'd have to put in extra effort in order to achieve broad acceptance (which really worked out for the older brother of one of my Asian friends who was voted Homecoming King). There wasn't overt racial denigration so much as implied lower rungs on the pecking order. The Asian girl - White guy phenomenon was just hitting it's full stride. Nowadays, the same neighborhood in which I grew up has a huge Chinese population such that the majority of restaurants and shops in the downtown area are Asian-oriented. Again, not saying either experience is better, just that the two are very different.  Edit - I wonder how much the major ""waves"" phenomenon is unique to Asian Americans (1st wave - Asians already here since the 1800s and prior to the 1965 Immigration Act, 2nd wave - Asians arriving immediately following the passage of that act as well as the Vietnamese ""Boat People"" who arrived here as refugees, and the current 3rd wave - Chinese arriving from the Mainland and Indians arriving as a result of the tech boom via H1B visas), my thinking being that Latinos have been pretty much coming to the U.S. steadily all along (or, that's just my perception), the majority of the Black population have been here since slavery and there doesn't seem to be a huge influx of Blacks from Africa arriving en masse, and Whites from the various European countries have been coming here in a steady stream; I don't have much of an idea regarding Pacific Islanders. I also don't have a clear idea about Filipinos, so anyone should feel free to school me on that."
asianamerican,3e28gh,argyle47,3,Tue Jul 21 18:47:53 2015 UTC,"It's a vicious cycle. The tiger-parenting and the excessive focus on academic achievements comes from both sources - (1) the sources within traditional Asian cultures which place primary personal worth on money/power alone and also (2) the model-myth minority propagated by the white community, which ""respects"" Asians because they are ""good ol' hardworking Americans who pay their taxes"".   It is myopic to exclusively point out one factor and ignoring the presence of the other. Let's face it.   A lot of traditional parents think of personal growth as a zero-sum game in which pursuit of non-academic talent is seen as eating into the time which could be spent on academic achievements. This contributes to a general low self-esteem and we end up dependent on validation by other people, often confused, trying to catch up, and unable to stand ground. I visited my parents recently after moving out for many years, and by god, every single conversation revolved around how much I earned, which car I drove, and whether my hobbies could be put on my resume.  But other part is true too. The only modicum of respect Asians are granted by even the most racist white-supremacist right-winger translates to financial advantage. The only Asian culture remotely respected at a deeper level in America in Japan (and recently Korea), which, once again is correlated to military and techonological development (electronics, cars, robotics, software etc.). Nobody truly appreciates a culture for its own sake. A culture and race are appreciated primarily because of their money-status.   It also needs mention that the way a culture is presented and consumed also depends on money-status, example, French cuisine being 4-star restaurants while Chinese cuisine being cheap takeouts. Before the whole Islamic terrorism became a thing, the culture of Arabs was actually respected and positively depicted in Western media. An Arab dude bathing in gold Jewellery, driving a Lamborgini with a chaffeur and having a harem of women was actually considered a cool frat-bro. Nothing wrong with them at all. Go figure !!!"

Zack Zheng was a hero who died during 9/11 saving lives.  http://www.nychinatown.org/articles/xinhua040912.html  They honoured him by renaming a street after him in Chinatown, thus ensuring that only the Chinese would know about him and what he had done.

Humans   In regards to Beauty & The Beast, I remember reading an article years ago about Kristen Kreuk that really turned me sour on her. She basically stated that it's not important to identify racially, that she doesn't really see herself as being half-Chinese. She just sees herself as being Canadian. I don't know if she's changed her tune since then but I don't support any work she's in."

asianamerican,3dwp3m,HeyItsMau,3,Mon Jul 20 06:27:16 2015 UTC,"I'm on my last year of an MBA doing that. Not surprisingly, it's no cake-walk and it seems like it never ends. I probably have it a lot easier than others too because I can just walk to school right after work.  The biggest surprise was how exponential the time commitment felt. Here's an example of a normal semester for me, and this is with 6 credits, sometimes I do 7.5 which means three days of classes a week instead of two.  Anyways, schedule classes to fall on only two days a week, let's say Monday and Wednesdays. I'm out of the house from 8AM - 10PM so those days are shot. Tuesdays I schedule time with the SO/other socializing (I do trivia nights). Sure it's fun and all...but it's still in some ways, work...it's certainly not ""me time"". Thursdays are dedicated completely to catching up on housework - cleaning and laundry. Fridays finally have the chance for one evening a week to decompress - usually too tired to do anything but get Seamless and watch Netflix. Saturdays are social obligations and catching up on HW. Sundays, more HW and then I usually spend a good 4-5 hours preparing food for the rest of the week. Somehow I still eat like shit because I get bored of the one-pot dish I made.  The flip side of this is when during the few weeks a year there are no classes, I feel like I have more time on my hands than I know what to do with.   I wouldn't recommend taking more than 7.5 credits (about two and a half classes). Try to make sure you schedule during summer and winter sessions to make it go by faster. Group projects are an insane pain in the ass because most other people work full-time and there's little room to coordinate in person."

It also pays pretty well for me as a single and has zero stress.   But if you work the same job for a long time and all of a sudden you want to make more or do something else, you're not on the best position to do that.
