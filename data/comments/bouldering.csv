bouldering,3dxs9c,ohmaniatethewholebag,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:54:03 2015 UTC,"Thank you. Only problem is, that the organic climbing stuff is not available in an european shop. I can only order from NA and that would nearly double the price."
bouldering,3dxs9c,ohmaniatethewholebag,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:17:27 2015 UTC,"I can understand why you don't want to go that route then. Try making your own - it isn't too sophisticated. About 1"" of dense foam padding covered with basically auto-carpet upholstery and 1"" webbing handles sewn on the corners.   Edit- Also I bought a starter pad after buying pads and sharing pads with friends. It's a good addition because it free's up a pad to be used elsewhere. I say go for it regardless of whether or not you go alone."
bouldering,3dxs9c,crimpers,2,Tue Jul 21 14:50:00 2015 UTC,"Couple of thoughts, I've found that starter pads are only really worth it if you climb lots on your own and what the crags near you are like.  If you normally climb with other people moving the pads you have is, in my opinion, a better option due to the complications caused by the differance in thickness between the started pad and the main ones (I know more than one person who has seriously damaged an ankle because of this - it doesn't take much height).  I also mentioned the terrian because I find them very useful at crags such as magic wood, where there is lots of steep boulders and often very uneven ground/general bad landings. However near me the climbs are often more vert and the landings smoother so even the people who own these pads tend not to bring them.  While I definetely don't want to put you off buying one (they do have other uses too, covering the side of rocks you might go into etc.) I would make sure that you have considered all these factors before you do.  Unfortunately as somebody who doesn't own one I can't really recommend any as such, however the one alpkit does seems to be quite popular and may be worth looking into?"
bouldering,3dxs9c,AFunnyName,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:35:46 2015 UTC,Thanks a lot! I'm mostly climbing with friends and will therefore not buy a pad now. ;)
bouldering,3dxs9c,swoleasaur,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:19:39 2015 UTC,I only ever end up using sit start pads to cover the side of rocks that are in the fall zone. They work really well for that purpose.

bouldering,3drclp,rahherr,10,Sat Jul 18 18:39:41 2015 UTC,"Climbing shoes should be a little tighter than your normal day to day shoes. Also, try on shoes during the afternoon since throughout the day, gravity causes your feet to swell because they get engorged with blood."
bouldering,3drclp,FapEnergy,5,Sat Jul 18 20:37:06 2015 UTC,"They should be tight and uncomfortable but not painful. Your toes should curl up in the toe box but only slightly. It sounds like your shoes fit well but I would size down since cowdura stretches about a half a size to a full size up.   I'd suggest taking them to your gym and climb in them a bit and ask yourself ""Is this how I want my shoes to fit? Is it painful? Is my foot moving around inside my shoe?"" If it fits perfectly and that's how you want them to be forever, then I'd suggest returning them and sizing down to an 8.5 or maybe an 8 since it'll stretch. If its too tight then go up half a size. If your foot moves then go down maybe a full size. I own a pair of these and they're amazing, you just have to fiddle around to get the right size.   Idk what amazon's return/exchange policy is during the sale but if you can exchange them try on as many shoes as possible until you get the right one."
bouldering,3drclp,jyding,3,Sat Jul 18 21:05:21 2015 UTC,So the shoes do actually stretch half a size? Most of the reviews I saw said otherwise.
bouldering,3drclp,jamez_eh,5,Sun Jul 19 01:33:06 2015 UTC,"I mainly sport climb, but I still size down as much as possible. Your shoes will stretch a little bit (even if they are synthetic) and if anything you will wish you bought them a little smaller.   I wouldn't worry too much if I were you. At first, the shoes that get you climbing most are the best shoes."
bouldering,3drclp,jyding,0,Sun Jul 19 01:37:06 2015 UTC,"Yeah they stretch quite a lot for cowdura. I mean its synthetic so it'll only go up half a size at most I think, so it's nothing crazy like leather where it can stretch up to a full two sizes sometimes.   The first pairs of shoes I got were the 5.10 Rogues and they stretched to be about a half size too large and my shoe can turn a full 180 around my foot, but those are still some of my favorite shoes and I wear them every time I go to the gym cuz it helps me to work on getting really solid footwork. So even if your shoes stretch then you can use them to train your toe strength and footwork which helps a lot in climbing.   But no matter what people say, climbing shoes always stretch as you break them in. Some more than others. So the rule I always go by is size them down to where they're perfect like thats how you want them to be forever. Then go down half a size to a full size depending on shoe material.   But as /u/jamez_eh said don't fret man. It's all about how much you use them. The more you use them the more you'll find the advantages and disadvantages of your shoes and that'll make you a better climber/wiser shopper the next time you're looking for another pair of shoes. Just don't get an addiction like I do. I have like 3 or 4 pairs of shoes and that's not even close to the number of pairs that some of the climbers in my gym have. It's all a learning experience. A very expensive and arduous learning experience."
bouldering,3drclp,nicene,2,Sun Jul 19 04:13:14 2015 UTC,You sound exactly like me a couple months ago.  I wear a street size 10 so that's what size I bought on a pair of evolv defys. Right away I felt that the right shoe was too small and wished I bought a half size bigger.  The staff at the gym all said that they were probably sized right and to climb in them.  After climbing 3 times my big toe was just in a lot of pain days later.  I decided to move up a half size and it was definitely the right decision.  They feel infinitely better.  Just pay attention to what your feet are telling you. They should be snug but not causing pain days after climbing.

Is there a local bouldering gym? I suggest starting there to get some help and find some people that can help you get started.
bouldering,3dri3z,ihad4biscuits,4,Sat Jul 18 19:52:50 2015 UTC,"Definitely go with some other climbers if you intend to climb outside. They'll likely already have things you need for outdoor bouldering like crash pads and guide books. A nearby gym is a great place to find other climbers, and you can train up at the gym too."
bouldering,3dri3z,moody31415,4,Sun Jul 19 03:46:39 2015 UTC,"If you want to climb outside, definitely do your research before going. Find a local guide book and/or look up your local spot on mountain project. This will give you a good sense of what to do and where to go, but more importantly you need to find out if the place you mentioned is actually climbable. It maybe forbidden or unsafe to climb. Also for your first time, definitely don't go alone. Bring someone that preferable who is an experienced climber. If you're very new or never climbed before, I highly recommend going to a climbing gym a hand full of times before you head outdoors. Outdoor climbing has a steep learning curve (can be very hard and scary) and the gym allows you to develop your technique so you can ease yourself into it. Gyms may also have classes or group outings where they go out to the local crag and teach you how to outdoor climb. I highly suggest you take this approach."

It's okay (but not great) at first, but as I pull up on my hands, I allow my heel to rotate so that my toes are pointing vertically -- meaning that my heel is no longer ""squeezing.""

Ive found it's great because usually I'm most sore in my forearms and hands from climbing, and biking is sometimes painful the same day I climb, (or the day after) so swimming was a nice relief, plus it stretches the body and works out the core a bit.  I've got extra weight too and I've found a downside for me is that I really have to control my appetite after I get back from swimming for some reason."
bouldering,3dj86g,hoogian,5,Thu Jul 16 22:38:05 2015 UTC,"Two downsides to swimming:  1) It works a lot of the same muscles as climbing, leaving you weakened and risking overuse injuries.  2) Unless you're wearing gloves your skin will get very soft and tear much more easily on real rock.  Lifting weights is not a bad thing to do on off days, burns a ton of calories, and boosts your metabolism."
bouldering,3dj86g,straightCrimpin,7,Thu Jul 16 22:56:28 2015 UTC,"Swimming is a great workout for your triceps, deltoids, rhomboids, pectorals and obviously your abdominal muscles. Climbing, in general, is far more intensive on your tendons, and there is definitely some overlap in the tendons that go through the elbow...  But I've never had a problem with soft flesh as a result of swimming. Also you want to do your cardio after your heavy lifting, or climbing, as it were. Do your climb, then jump in the pool and burn 385ish kcal/mi (front crawl).  Cross training the same muscle groups is definitely not a bad thing."
bouldering,3dj86g,Blood_farts,2,Fri Jul 17 03:01:20 2015 UTC,"Swimming works nearly every muscle in the body. But the overuse danger comes in the shoulders, the ""reach and pull"" movement which is used in climbing is used as well in swimming, as well as elbows. The intensity doesn't have to be high to develop overuse injuries, and in fact you may feel totally fine one day, and get injured the next.  It's obviously going to be an individual choice though. If as you've said you've never had to worry about your skin, and you don't get overuse injuries than you're fine. Not everyone will respond the same way.  Just for the sake of curiosity I wonder what type of stone and what grades your climbing on real rock? In my experience the skin issue isn't a big deal on grades below V6 or V7 for rock types like limestone or sandstone, though depending on the type of granite it may be an issue at any grade."

I've always heard that if you're wanting to gain muscle mass that cardio is a bad idea; but if you really want to do cardio, then do it after your lifts so that your muscles are fresh and you're less likely to lift improperly or injured yourself.  There's so much bad science and new science surrounding physical fitness that I hesitate to say anything for sure. /r/fitness could answer your question better than me.  I just swim, and bike, boulder, lift a little on the side, a little yoga, and generally try to keep active. It works for me but I'm not trying to get ripped. There's no plan, just whatever sounds like fun for the day."

bouldering,3dj86g,lightning_balls,3,Fri Jul 17 17:55:31 2015 UTC,I'm imagining the relatively weightlessness in the water is a nice dichotomy to carrying your weight up a problem

bouldering,3dj86g,kennethsime,1 point,Sat Jul 18 13:44:56 2015 UTC,No idea! I used to swim laps; I feel like some of the other commenters might have brought up some fair concerns over using it as a complimentary exercise.
bouldering,3dj86g,strewman,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:14:56 2015 UTC,"Swimming is just like running in the sense that the workouts are in sets with varying strokes and intervals based on whether you're going for sprints (for cardio and building muscle) or distance (for breathing control and endurance).  If you're interested in starting swimming, you can google ""swim workouts for beginners"" and you'll find a ton of great workouts that have a lot of variation so they don't get boring. I highly recommend it too! I swam competitively for around 8 years and even though it's been about 2 years since I quit, the muscles I gained from it [and more or less kept due to various forms of exercise] helped a HUGE amount when I started climbing seriously a couple months ago (the lats especially, lol)."

Its a VERY intense full body workout that feels like it works different upper body muscles than purely climbing does.   I only wakeboard a handful of times a year so its not reliable for training for me, but after ONE 10~ minute run on the wakeboard I tend to feel as sore as after a full day of climbing, sometimes even more sore."

bouldering,3dj86g,klsilcox,1 point,Fri Jul 17 10:30:09 2015 UTC,"What do you mean by, ""I'm a terrible runner?"" If by it you mean you don't like to run, that's one thing. But if by it you mean that you lack skill, well that's something that can be worked on. The simple fact is that unless you do something like muay thai, running is one of the best ways to maximize your calorie burn per minute of exercise i.e. you get the most bang for your buck with running so long as - as with all physical activity - you change the intensity or frequency every 4-6 weeks once your body adapts to a given level. But to be honest, the majority of your weight loss is going to come from diet, not from exercise. The only reason to exercise more than climbing for weight loss is so that you can have a caloric deficit of at least 500 calories per day (if you want to lose 1 pound of body fat per week) without falling below your basal metabolic rate (falling below this for prolonged periods of time will lower your metabolism and when you return to 'normal eating' - what ought to be a proper calorie intake for your height, weight and muscle vs fat composition, you'll gain weight).   All this said, if you really enjoy swimming and it works for you in the weight loss department, go for it! You're more likely to stick with an exercise that you like and that works for your personal schedule than with one that doesn't."

Started the same, stringing moves together, including the top out, but there was one movement I couldnt make while on a real burn. I could make the move no problem when I skipped the intro, but the problem was so powerhouse (for me) at the time that I wasn't able to obtain the successful go. This was about 6 months ago when I first started getting into heavier cave climbing. Incline was that of about 35/20 on a ridiculous V8  4 weeks of burns and not one finish. Still haunts me.

My problem is grade 10 (out of 1-15 gym grade, definitely no resemblance to actual V-scale), about 10 moves long and right at my limit with no rests.

The more I freeflow and just relax every step of the way, the easier it is to flash dynos, or put in burns on a project that I know I'll never complete.   If climbing was a competition with myself I might ask them too, but it just feels like a ""Fish that got away"" ..

I drop to floor about 5-6 feet below my feet like I've done many times before, but this time:  rolled ankle.  Incredible pain instantly.  Ballooned.  Couldn't walk for 3 days.

Just start start talking to people at the gym and ask ""what climbing outside is like compared to indoor"" and you are bound to get invited to climb. Thats what I did and now I invite people outside all the time.  Beware that grading outside tends to be harder than the gym but It is exponentially more fun (for me personally..

bouldering,3d2q24,quantumraiders,1 point,Mon Jul 13 05:27:11 2015 UTC,"The first step is to meet and make friends at the gym. Then you find a group to invite you on an outdoor climbing trip or ask to join a trip. Just a little pro tip. Most climbers don't care how hard anyone climbs all we care about is whether or not you are fun to be around. If you are psyched on climbing, willing to try hard, and fun to climb with you will have no problem getting on a trip. The one thing I hate when I take new people climbing is their unwillingness to actually climb due to fear of ""failing"" or looking ""weak"" compared to the rest of the crew. Don't worry, climbing is stupid fucking hard and we all suck at it no matter how hard we climb so just have fun! Also, for me, if I invite someone new on a trip it's cause I already think you are cool. Tramway and black mountain are most popular right now. Have fun and good luck."

bouldering,3d2q24,Jesuswashomeless,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:06:11 2015 UTC,what gym do you climb at? all of the Orange County gyms i've been too have pretty active communities - it should be pretty easy to find people to go outside with.   I was climbing in the gym for about 2 years before finally going outdoors for the first time about a month ago (black mountain) - it totally changed everything how i feel about climbing. I got completely shut down and actually spent most of the trip just trying to mentally psyche myself up to send something but it was a fucking blast.   I'd absolutely recommend talking to people at your gym and going out with them!

bouldering,3d0dr7,jcarlson08,2,Thu Jul 16 14:56:45 2015 UTC,"There are hangboards out there with edges as small as 5mm. I think the BAM board gets smaller than that and they list the difficulty of their smallest possible edge as 5.impossible, though I think this includes a fully tilted board, not just smallest edge.  With perfect friction it ought to be possible to dead hang off of 3-4mm holds, although in practice holds this small rarely appear on anything other than slabs. The difficulty of most hard climbs comes from increasing steepness, sustained difficulty, and big moves between holds. Not just from holds getting smaller and smaller."
bouldering,3d0dr7,straightCrimpin,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:58:42 2015 UTC,"At my gym there's a Transgression hangboard. I did a few training sessions on it, consisting of 6 8-second hangs with three minute rests in between. The idea was to find an edge size that would allow you to hang for the intended duration with a 4-second margin before failure. On a good day I could use the 9mm edge, but I had to vigorously brush it after each hang. On a bad day (warm / humid) I had to use the 10mm edge. It was hard to believe the difference that 1mm made to me."

For warm up, I climb up and down on V0s and V1s, do a traverse, then I tackle one or two trickier V2s or V3s.  Then I take a break and study the projects I'm working on. If the gym's not busy, I just keep hammering away at the same problem until I need a break. I'm making little bits of progress here and there, getting one or two moves further into a problem each visit, so the routine seems to be working.  I cool down with a couple fun V2s I know I can send, to keep my confidence up after all the hard work on the V4s, then if I have the energy I do a slow, easy traverse."
bouldering,3d0hwt,straightCrimpin,1 point,Mon Jul 13 14:34:41 2015 UTC,"There is no one routine, and there ought not to be. Routines change based on how long one has been climbing, what one's goals are, how old one is. An older person is going to need a much more regimented and much longer warmup than a 16 year old. A 16 year old who has been climbing for a decade will warmup very differently than a 16 year old who is in his first year.  The most important thing is to make sure that you warm up properly so you don't injure yourself. The second most important thing is to make sure you're trying things that are hard enough that you continue to improve. What that means for everyone is different. I'm 25, been climbing since I was 19. I can't warm up like I did when I was 20 or 21. I used to warm up by climbing on some 0's and 1's and then hitting the projects when I felt good. I can't go based off feeling anymore.  Now I climb 2 of every grade up to flash level, which is V5 or V6 or V7 depending on how strong the setters are feeling that week. After that I follow whatever my program indicates I should be doing for this session. That could be focusing on 1-2 moves of maximum difficulty, it could be 4x4's and linked bouldering circuits, it could be stamina based competition practice. Could be just trying the new projects and hanging out with friends. It all depends."

Then I do v3-4 problems for another 15 minutes, and then I hit my v5-6 problems for about 2.5 to 3 hours. In between I eat either a banana or a kind bar. It helps me get through the last hour. Finally I cool down with v4's and v0's with shorter rests than usual. Cooling down takes about 20-30 minutes. I finish the day by doing ab/core workouts and push ups, then I shower quickly and have a fruit juice and protein bar on the way out."

I usually have time to go climbing once a week, and it's between 2.5-3.5 hours, depending on my friends who are there.  My usual routine is to stretch out and warm up, hang a little on our hanging rings to stretch out the arms and core, and climb 1 or 2 easier routes that I know are more about technique than brute strength (anywhere from v1-v2 in my gym's wonky rating system).  After that I work my way up to the harder routes, and usually have a couple that I'm working on that I haven't sent yet.  I usually have a couple routes that work different skillsets that I'm working on at a time.  I spent four months working on this one v4 overhang with slopers and a huge reach until I finally sent it a week before the reset.  I usually alternate between strong, reachy, grippy problems and technical, slabby, balance-driven problems until my grip is too tired to do anything meaningful.  I also tend to rest between climbs for a while in order to extend my climb time and conserve my strength.  I climb with a bunch of people, usually, and am a volunteer staff person at the wall, so I also spend the rest time talking about the problems with my buddies and giving advice to people who want it, maybe testing out a route someone is setting, or waiting my turn on a new route."

They have a good mixture of overhang and straight wall, I try to follow the following in both gyms but the south location is a different style and slightly wildcard for me to climb. I usually climb all of the E- to warm up, move to a handful of Easy's and a few E+. I work on movement and down climb all of them them to get my motions correct. Then I move to the M- routes, I try to clear most of the ones that are set, if I find something that is challenging I work on it till I send it. If the M- are flashes I work on M reg and +. Its rare I flash these but it happens occasionally. Depending on the day and how I feel, I climb for 1-2 hours pretty solid. If I start getting won out on the M area I go back to easy climbs.

Bay Area Rock by Jim Thornburg is the best imo, but Chris Summit's Bay Area Bouldering is worth getting too. Then, once you've climbed all that stuff, get the Rakkup app and download the Castle Rock guide. It has a few new spots that have just been developed. There's more out there to be found too. I have a friend developing some boulders in the Oakland hills, and another who's found a fair amount on Mt. Tam."

It looks like had you matched feet beneath you and let your left foot flag down, you could have statically reached up and grabbed the sloper."
bouldering,3cd31e,itstoearly,1 point,Tue Jul 7 00:02:09 2015 UTC,"Thanks, that's a great point! I just basically stopped thinking about beta and efficiency. It makes sense, then, that I fell there. Appreciate it!"
bouldering,3cd31e,straightCrimpin,1 point,Tue Jul 7 00:55:20 2015 UTC,"I was thinking the same thing. Keep feet down low and to the left, bump to the sloper. The high right foot forced the awkward left hand sidepull pinch thing which in turn forced either a 1 arm lockoff on the left or a severe chicken wing, which in turn pumped him out and contributed  to the fall."
bouldering,3cd31e,TormentedDoss,5,Tue Jul 7 16:02:14 2015 UTC,Possibly work on glue hands.  Every time you hit a hold you readjust your hands a split second later.  If you hit it correct the first time you won't waste that extra split second each move.
bouldering,3cd31e,gumbykid,2,Tue Jul 7 13:36:20 2015 UTC,"Man, watching again, that's a really good point. On literally every hold I make minute adjustments. Would be great to hit and stick and not have to shift around."
bouldering,3cd31e,tunnelblanket,4,Tue Jul 7 14:14:00 2015 UTC,"Fairly controlled, especially for being towards the end of the day. There are a couple points where you could get closer to the wall, which would help overall in being more controlled and requiring less energy. You have enough strength to power through some things so that's to be an expected habit.  I could be wrong, because analyzing videos is hard, but at both 16s and 30s you could crank harder drop knees to get your left hip closer to the wall. At 32s you might've been able to heel hook the closer hold, but if you feel controlled in the far foot then that's great as well. That's about it, it was fairly clean."
bouldering,3cd31e,joshvillen,1 point,Tue Jul 7 00:35:43 2015 UTC,"Thanks, that's actually helpful - I can often power through certain things, but I want to be able to climb them statically and with as little energy as possible for sure. I think keeping myself in towards the wall and making sure I'm utilizing the absolute most-optimal beta is something I need to work on."
bouldering,3cd31e,AlphaAgain,1 point,Tue Jul 7 00:54:46 2015 UTC,"What I found that really helped me start climbing more statically was to start on easier problems. During my warmups, I would focus on making very deliberate moves to each hold, which helped me work on locking off and slowly standing up to the next hold. Practicing this helped me understand when moves could be done static, which also helped me rely on my power less."

By the time you get to V7, V8, V9, problems outside become so radically different in terms of what's required. I see plenty of strong, light dudes who have only been climbing in the gym for 6 months who could get up some classic sloper problems like ""Choir Boys Light"" V7 at Hueco Tanks, but that doesn't mean they'll have any chance of doing a problem like the incredibly crimpy V7 ""Babyface"" also at Hueco Tanks. And then you have those slab problems which require technique and a very unique kind of strength in which case almost no one does a V7 of that style outside with less than a year's experience."

Maybe if new management comes in and they get holds/T-nuts/mats/AC/ATCs/ropes/etc this place can be taken seriously again. Focus Is I believe located in Mesa and is also near downtown and ASU. If you're into bouldering this gym should be perfect for you. Contains the tallest walls Phoenix for bouldering, holds are basically new and good quality.

After 30 minutes to an hour I warm down on a few V4s and always end my day in the cave. Usually burning out two V2+V1+V0s until my arms give. Rest for 5 minutes and slowly campus my way up another V0 in the cave, working on my 1 arm pull ups and core technique. End with hanging campus and doing 2 finger pulls with my legs in front of me. 3 Mile bike ride home, all downhill ~WHOOSH!  I make sure to listen to my body even if I had a plan that day, so if I wanted to work on a hard V6 with tons of 2finger crimps on a day my left elbow is acting finnicky, then I don't that, maybe heelhook cave routes instead. I never strain myself for the sake of completing a problem. I know all too many who wind up with injuries that way.  **All routes include climbing back down, unless projects.. Who jumps??

Then I start climbing progressively harder till my fingers feel warm. For warming down I just climb progressively easier stuff until I am no longer warm. I spend most of my time projecting and that's what gets me ready, the warming down comes naturally because I get to tired to project so I go do old problems."

Climb every V2 and V3 on the new set (probably 5 problems); rest. Climb most V4s on the new set (one I had to project, one I couldn't do, probably 5 problems total); rest.  At this point, my friends were working on a V8 so I gave a couple goes on the first move but didn't make much progress past that; at this point it was safe to say I'd warmed up.  Warm-down?

For warming down, I'll send one problem that I know I can complete, but that's on the tougher end of my skill level - generally a tricky V2 or an easier V3 - then maybe a fun V1, then another long, lazy traverse.

bouldering,3bo53y,tannhauser85,13,Tue Jun 30 19:56:32 2015 UTC,"Looking at this second clip, most of your dynos are because you're barn dooring a lot. This happens when you have two points of support (hand+foot) on the same side of the body. Think about maintaining cross-body tension instead: If your right hand is weighted, get your weight on your left foot and vice versa.  For example, on the very first move in the clip you could have started with your right foot on the small black foothold, instead of your left. (Probably wrap your left foot around the arete.) This would eliminate the barn door on that first move when you reach up with the right hand.  Soon it will become instinctive to aim for cross-body tension. Watch really good boulderers and keep an eye for how they maintain it nearly at all times."

bouldering,3bo53y,offbelayknife,4,Mon Jul 6 10:49:23 2015 UTC,"I don't think there is anything wrong with being highly dynamic when you are projecting up to the highest V level you climb. Most likely you're able to climb V1-V2 very smoothly and as you get better the higher grades will be smoother also. Its hard to tell how tall you are but most shorter climbers have no choice but to do a lot of ""dyno"" moves. I'm constantly having to dyno on moves that my taller friends can just reach. Great job on those problems!"
bouldering,3bo53y,jalme,6,Tue Jun 30 20:20:17 2015 UTC,"Try climbing in ""slow motion"" and only do one move at a time.   I have accustomed myself to do my warmups on lower grades like this, climbing very slowly with precise and deliberate movements. I statically rest in one position for about one second after every move i make, even if it is just flagging my foot or turning my body.   This practise helped me becoming a way more efficient climber and pushed my maximum level by a lot, since I dont have a lot of power and rely mostly and technique and my ability to figure out the easiest beta. It also helps with analyzing your mistakes, since you can exactly pinpoint which move made you fall if you only make one move at a time.  Hope this helps you, keep it up!"
bouldering,3bo53y,3rd_attempt,1 point,Tue Jun 30 20:17:22 2015 UTC,"Ok, I will try to go for V3/V4 I know I can do without problems and do them as slow as possible, and try to slow down on new boulders.

bouldering,3bo53y,boulderingshitlord,1 point,Tue Jun 30 21:36:25 2015 UTC,"Another exercise you can do (or even imagine doing) is to attach a pendulum to yourself and try to minimize its lateral movement. So the example I saw on YouTube (also where I got this idea) was to wear a harness and attach a hanging (like 2+ feet) chalk bag to the rear. Then try to climb without causing the bag to swing around.  This exercise just reinforces what other people have been giving you for specific feedback on the problem you identified -- your movement is uncontrolled and bumpy (or as you said, not as smooth as your peers). Good job so far!"
bouldering,3bo53y,smashueatu,19,Thu Jul 2 06:56:09 2015 UTC,You have a weak core and poor balance.
bouldering,3bo53y,amazingsil,8,Tue Jun 30 20:21:46 2015 UTC,"I don't know why everyone is downvoting you; you're spot on. You may have been a bit blunt about it, but he does have very weak core and poor balance. As mentioned above he barn doors a lot, which can be fixed with better footwork. It's also much easier to make strenuous moves with a strong core that keeps you locked into the wall so you don't burn strength as much."
bouldering,3bo53y,bewkid,9,Tue Jun 30 22:53:50 2015 UTC,"Maybe the downvotes were because his comment isn't very helpful.  OP's core may not be weak at all, he just needs to learn how to keep it engaged to maintain body tension.  It's not like you need Pilates-hardened abs to keep your hips into the wall on a mostly vertical problem like this.  He just needs to focus on it.  As far as balance goes, you're right, it's a footwork issue.  Pointing out that someone's footwork is causing them to lose their balance is much more helpful than just saying they have poor balance."
bouldering,3bo53y,rubberduckythe1,2,Wed Jul 1 17:43:56 2015 UTC,"Agreed. This is evident when his feet cut and he needs to swing to get his foot up to the next volume, as well as in the the uncontrolled 'plop' of his foot on that volume."

bouldering,3bo53y,jbcsn1,3,Thu Jul 2 14:15:25 2015 UTC,"I think most of it has been covered by everyone, but this is my personal opinion from the things you posted has been something that I commonly see on climbers in the v4/v5 range who aren't quite sure how to bump it up to the next level.  Footwork, slow it down a lot, be precise. You said you see good climbers looking smooth, try to mimic that on easier climbs. Also do it on a project you've completed, master a project where you feel like you could improve your footwork by working slower and more precisely.   Core strength, this again will help you look a lot smoother, you again said you feel kinda ""dyno-y"" good footwork and core strength will allow you to climb a lot more static because you'll have way better body tension.   Lock off strength. Practice lock offs in the gym, climb below your limit and lock off every single move in an exaggerated lock off. I think Sean McColl's training video also shows how to practice lock offs a bit, it's pretty simple.  Also I'm not sure what kind of shoes you are wearing, but if you are looking to take your footwork to the next level, I would advise a pair of bouldering shoes and preferably a pair with thin rubber. It will be more expensive (for both the shoe and how often you need to repair or buy new ones) BUT the extra sensitivity will make you think about your feet a lot more (plus personally I can't boulder without a down-turned shoe anymore, helps a lot).   As for hangboarding, start really easy and just improve your pullup strength and general grip strength, do not go too hard or your tendons will most likely pay for it. Practice slow and precise pullups on decent holds and edges. I would highly suggest trying frenchies.   I guess that ended up being kinda long, but hopefully you can get something out of it!"
bouldering,3bo53y,Badnapp420,1 point,Thu Jul 2 01:27:19 2015 UTC,"The climbing looks desperate, some moves look sloppy or like you will fall.  The reason you are stuck is probably because you aren't super strong on them yet.  Make each move perfect when you climb. Also be projecting harder problems.  You cant send v10 if you don't try it at some point."
bouldering,3bo53y,elcheapo,1 point,Wed Jul 1 06:41:35 2015 UTC,Is that really the best way to climb that route? I can't imagine the ideal beta is to cut feet and then swing your feet up..   Edit: also that move in the middle where you swing both feet again? The reason I bring it up is because cutting both feet is wildly inefficient and usually done on overhanging routes. But hey I don't know the route
bouldering,3bo53y,jcarlson08,2,Thu Jul 2 05:24:14 2015 UTC,"The clips are not perfect, neither is the phone that filmed them, but both routes are tilted.  That being said, there is most certainly a more efficient way to do them and you're not the only one to point that out !  The first swing is something I tried to avoid when working on this route, sometime my right foot would just pop off as it does on the clip, but I agree that the best way to do this move is probably to put left foot and statically put right foot up. That's not what was caught on camera but as it reflects my climbing ability and as I'm seeking for advice it doesn't matter much!"

bouldering,3bo53y,slinkysuki,1 point,Fri Jul 3 15:17:10 2015 UTC,"Core strength + technique practice = bouldering smoothness. Do v0 and v1 routes slowly and as intentionally as possible, using as few holds as possible (that's important). Make the moves bigger, like those in your 2nd video. Only in this case, the holds will be bigger so you can focus on using your balance, technique, etc."
bouldering,3bo53y,straightCrimpin,1 point,Fri Jul 3 15:59:42 2015 UTC,"As everybody else pointed out, it's mostly your footwork bro. That and don't full crimp stuff, relax your hands, you'll still be able to hold the wall.  You've probably just never experienced a tendon injury - and if you can throw to a hold and latch it, you will. Over time you'll probably barndoor hard a couple of times, latch a crimp to stay on, and tweak your tendon(s). Then you'll slow it down :) Not much to do but practice. Campus rungs are the shortcut to power, but there's no shortcut to technique.   Here's a video illustrating proper footwork, http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Usee0F_Ya98.   When you're climbing at your limit and get stuck on a move just ask yourself a few questions, ""Can I backflag? Can I flag? Can I dropknee? Can I kneebar?"" Usually you'll figure something out eventually. If the wall is inclined, never have your hips facing it.  Finally, in regards to that specific problem, I would: - Start right foot instead of left - Halfway through, you set your legs apart and do a dramatic deadpoint to snipe that hold with your left hand. You could have instead a) backflagged with your left leg like you did 10 seconds earlier or b) switched your right foot for your left and flat your right leg towards the yellow volume. Then you could gently crank your torso in for the smooth finish.  Pro Tip Invest in new, darker climbing pants. You have a big soggy butt sweat stain ;)   We are climbing to get laid, right?"
bouldering,3bo53y,tannhauser85,1 point,Tue Jul 7 13:53:50 2015 UTC,"What do you do besides bouldering? How long have you been at it?  There is a point at which you need strength training in order to improve. In particular, you want to improve finger strength and lock-off/reach. For finger strength a hangboard is useful for edges and crimps but it doesn't help so much with pinches and maybe slopers. At some point I improved my pinch strength significantly by doing a repeatable routine with pinch holds on a system wall.  For reach / lock-offs, campusing really helps (but also must be done very carefully). I have a few reachy outdoor problems that I go back to once in a while, and my campusing level at the time is a good indicator of whether I'll be able to repeat them or not."

The key to getting stacked is in the kitchen, not the gym.  What and how much you eat defines how big and how lean you are.  Strength is 90% exercise, 10% diet.  But appearance is 90% diet, 10% exercise.   Eat more, and more protein, exercise lots and give it time."
bouldering,3bozzr,slainthorny,5,Wed Jul 1 00:01:25 2015 UTC,"You have to be pretty gifted (genetically) to get huge bouldering. I know only one guy that I would call ""jacked"" who only climbs. He's been bouldering outside, occasionally crushing up to v14, for the last decade and a half.  Myself, I am skinnier than I have ever been and I weigh 205lbs at 6'3"". Most would call me a pretty stacked dude. The thing is... I'm 15lbs lighter than when I started bouldering. And most of that loss was muscle.  But yeah, I got big because I used to hit the weights gym a lot, and work heavy construction. Way too many years lifting heavy things. My wakeup call was walking home from the gym, and realizing I couldn't scratch my own shoulder with the same hand. Bicep was in the way. No more curls after that.  Boulderers can get pretty big by just climbing stuff, but the guys that strike you as HUGE (and probably aren't the best climbers in the gym) are the guys that have taken a bodybuilding frame and bolted some bouldering muscles on top of that.   Sooner or later, they will realize they don't need all that muscle to boulder freaking hard. Just some of it. :)"

I've long been a skinny one-bouldering relatively hard but holding around 150 pounds at 6'. Recently started doing other stuff and putting on a bit of mass, but nothing massive. As has been mentioned, diet is important as well as how you work out."
bouldering,3bozzr,thecrookedspine,4,Fri Jul 3 16:32:56 2015 UTC,"Remember that people in the gym may appear 50% more muscular than when they laying down at the beach. Ok, that 50% is made up, but in the gym your muscles are engorged from working out, and look more defined when they are actively flexing or being engaged.   I don't take my shirt off in the gym because I don't support that kind of behavior-- and shit, I'm training and all that shirt drag is gonna help me with at least one, maybe two grades outside!   That said, I wear a tank top to stay cool, and I've gotten comments from my buddies about how big my muscles look... except I probably have the smallest muscles in the group-- I just happen to have very low body fat and a lower overall weight. So I appear bigger than I am, particularly when bouldering.  Yes, just bouldering (and other sports) has gotten me significantly bigger, but just not bulky and nobody would confuse me with even the newbiest of body builders. Every week or two I see actual body builders come to give bouldering a chance... it is clear they are fish out of water and have a totally different physique. They tend to have huge, thick chests and necks and thighs. That's a dead giveaway.  I'm guessing you're referring to people like me, and others I see who are bigger. I suspect you are seeing gymnastic type bodies, but much smaller overall. Low weight, good muscular definition, moderately big upper body, back, and core (under developed chest, legs, in many cases triceps and traps)-- all looking about 50% more muscular than we are because we've just been limit bouldering for a hour and everything is pumped.   I know I have good genetics (not for huge muscle mass, but for very lean body with well defined lean body mass/muscle), a long history of active sports my whole life, but other than push-ups and some chest stuff very infrequently... I don't do any lifting anymore. I did lift for about 8 months after abdominal surgery in order to generally get stronger and heal, but we are talking such meager weights (started with unweighted Dumbbells and added like a pound a week) to avoid re-injury that it never made me big, only healthy-- and when I was able to start bouldering I stopped lifting and everything but my legs and chest and neck got bigger. I try to ride my road bike with friends at a slow pace for about 30-80 miles at least once a week, with beer stops; I definitely notice that this keeps me lean, which makes me look more defined even if I'm overall not as big.  TL;DR Lean bodies, strong muscles, pumped = muscles in gym may appear much bigger than reality. Also... Few actual body builders, or still current gymnasts, in the bouldering hall for you to compare against. Maybe some super skinny route climbers though!"
bouldering,3bozzr,justcrimp,2,Wed Jul 1 07:05:49 2015 UTC,"Most people don't get huge mass from climbing/bouldering itself.  Decent gains are to expected in the back, forearms, and core, little gains in the biceps, triceps, and shoulders, and barely any gains in the chest and legs. A normal climber looks fairly fit/strong in some areas and adequate/a little weak in others.  Most serious climbers weight lift/train along with climbing. [Usually] Nearly a third of the training is working antagonist muscles (chest, legs, shoulders, etc), another third with general fitness (think deadlifts, pull ups, etc), and the last third climbing-specific training.  Backs get ripped, man tits are adequate, must always have a 6 pack. That's generally what you'll see."
bouldering,3bozzr,gumbykid,1 point,Wed Jul 1 07:12:21 2015 UTC,"Definitely not. At 6'1"" and 175lbs I'm a decently sized, pretty muscular guy, but none of it came from climbing. When I was younger I was on a competition bouldering team, and was skinny as shit at 130lbs. But after I stopped climbing competitively, my competitive sports became skiing and wrestling, so the muscle went on until I weighed about 190. Now that I've stopped skiing and wrestling, and I'm back to just climbing, although not competitively, I've come back down to 175, probably 165 by the fall.   I would definitely agree with what was said above, that you have to be genetically gifted to get big from bouldering alone, and also that diet effects appearance more than anything else."
bouldering,3bozzr,32venakara,1 point,Wed Jul 1 15:07:36 2015 UTC,"I'm a girl. I've got some serious definition and have definitely ""grown"" from bouldering. I eat pretty well. I do a decent amount of antagonistic training but nothing crazy. I think it is just genetics. I have seen girls who are definitely stronger than me who don't look as jacked."
bouldering,3bozzr,as7,1 point,Thu Jul 2 00:18:12 2015 UTC,Strong climbers tend to be wiry. Anybody who looks like they lift weights probably lifts weights. If they have a chest then they definitely spend time benching.

bouldering,3bnt1n,Chillibby,2,Tue Jun 30 18:31:41 2015 UTC,"That's a complicated question. You want a better pad but you want to pay less, you also want it for highballs which are really more about the number and placement of pads, not about the quality of a specific one. For highballs, I usually climb with other people and pool pads. I don't know of anything I'd call a highball that I'd feel safe climbing with two different (and possibly uneven) pads. What exactly are you thinking of climbing?"
bouldering,3bnt1n,elcheapo,1 point,Tue Jun 30 21:37:25 2015 UTC,"I'm not afraid to pay less than what I did for my organic, I was looking for a cheaper big pad relative to the rest of the big pads out there. It just needs to be larger, and a little thicker. I don't care so much about quality as I'll rarely be using it so it does not need to last crazy long."
bouldering,3bnt1n,elcheapo,1 point,Tue Jun 30 23:01:55 2015 UTC,"I have an Organic Big Pad and it's great but obviously not cheap. Years ago I had a Metolius Triple Pad (I believe it's called Magnum now). It's pretty big (6x4) but relatively thin. I wasn't happy with the quality of the build, although the foam is fine. You might find it relatively cheap online or used."
bouldering,3bnt1n,kennethsime,1 point,Wed Jul 1 02:19:37 2015 UTC,"Okay thanks man, I'll look into the magnum. I'd love an organic big pad, but frankly I'm only going to use this a handful of sessions a year and don't really want to drop heavy bills :P."
bouldering,3bnt1n,kennethsime,0,Wed Jul 1 17:15:32 2015 UTC,I don't think you're going to find cheaper pads that are thicker; maybe go find some used mattresses on craigslist.
bouldering,3bnt1n,quiksnap,1 point,Wed Jul 1 20:38:41 2015 UTC,"I don't know why you're looking to highball but also looking to go cheap on pads; this is inverse of what pretty much anyone with any sense would do.  My cheap metolius pad at a year old is fine for anything where my feet aren't more than 6 feet off the ground, but after that I feel the impact significantly more. I've fallen from 20 feet onto Organic Big pads and felt just like a gym; I'd always rather fall on the Organic, but I'd pretty much never fall on my old metolius pad from that height.  People also speak highly of the large Asana pads, particularly if you select their highball foam layering option."
bouldering,3bnt1n,slainthorny,1 point,Wed Jul 1 20:36:33 2015 UTC,"I'm looking for quality, just the cheapest brand which is deemed ""acceptable"" for highballing.

bouldering,3bnt1n,quiksnap,1 point,Thu Jul 2 03:57:02 2015 UTC,"Why not invest in two harnesses and some rope? Just set up the line on top and do some top roping. It might seem silly on a 20 foot problem but id rather do that then land on rocks. I guess it seems for me, all the high balls I know have tons of rock under the fall. I know its not strictly bouldering but there comes a time in every boulderers life that he/she wants to climb slightly higher stuff."
bouldering,3bnt1n,lil_SLUGGA,2,Tue Jun 30 22:29:18 2015 UTC,"Why climb kinda sketchy trad? or semi-runout sport climbs?  At some point, scary things start to look really appealing.  I like adding in some mental challenge to go with physical difficulty."

I was cleaning a boulder and noticed the whole top-out seemed a bit loose. A few kicks later, I dislodged 500 pounds worth of rock. If I had tried to climb it first, I likely would have died. I've also pulled a microwave sized block out of some shitty conglomerate beach rock. Be careful, especially on undeveloped boulders!!"

Which is the set up for me to say something horrible:  Am I the only one who finds her blog posts a little wishy-washy and depressing? I enjoy the aspect of seeing the view through the eyes of a competitor, or route setter-- but her posts feel too self-focused, almost narcissistic-but-unhappy. And they generally end with the tone of: I'm working hard to come to terms with XYZ, yet I haven't really come to terms with XYZ. I get the feeling that instead of being satisfied that she climbs super hard... she is essentially always disappointed and left empty by the struggle of not being right at the top. And to me, that's totally anathema to climbing in general. If it doesn't make you high 95% of the time, why do it, or why do it the way you're currently doing it? Why compete?"

I think I messed up my Achilles tendon going full on Tuesday after hitting it pretty hard Saturday.   Remember to stretch or you'll be out for at least a week! That's my advice anyway. I also agree about getting to go about 3 times per week if you really want to progress without beating yourself up too much."
bouldering,3b9m9v,stephennnnnnn,3,Sat Jun 27 06:08:56 2015 UTC,I think the thing the be mindful of is tendon injuries.  It creeps up on a lot of new climbers because your tendons (like finger pulleys) take much much longer to heal than muscles.  I've seen it happen a few times where someone starts making progress really fast and then pops a tendon.
bouldering,3b9m9v,FogInTheDog,2,Sat Jun 27 17:40:43 2015 UTC,"Second the advice to pay attention to your body and be aware of your tendons/pulleys. ""Just one more problem"" at the end of an exhausting session is a great way to injure yourself.  At one point I started making great progress and started to train harder and harder, until I partially tore a pulley and was out for four months.  Excruciating wait and I'm still behind where I was."
bouldering,3b9m9v,jbcsn1,2,Sat Jun 27 22:47:34 2015 UTC,"I would try to spread out your bouldering to one day off, one day on, one day off, one day on, and so on. Don't let it get in the way of your work, but I strongly advise against bulk bouldering (bouldering days in a row). Things like climber's elbow and chronic joint pains can develop, even with long rest periods between two-three days of climbing in a row.   One solid day of climbing requires a solid day of rest/recovery. If you don't give that to your body, the second day of climbing right after the first might contribute to damaging your body."
bouldering,3b9m9v,hurtinyofeelins,1 point,Mon Jun 29 18:02:33 2015 UTC,"Advice I always give is to listen to your body.  Your joints aren't just going to spontaneously explode if you boulder too much, but if you're consistently sore it would be a good idea to scale it back a bit."
bouldering,3b9m9v,Frostiestone,3,Sat Jun 27 06:27:54 2015 UTC,"His joints might not but his pulleys very well could, depending on technique and other factors.

I've just noticed that my progress is very slow but noticeable at the V4 to V5 range, I was able to get to V3 very quickly but since then it's been much slower. Just me getting to the next move on a project is a big deal for me at this point. I just hope it doesn't take years for me to get to the next few levels.

bouldering,3b89nv,solo220,9,Fri Jun 26 19:41:25 2015 UTC,"The only advice I have is if it's not steep, it's not worth building. 90% of the home walls I see are 8 feet of vertical climbing. What exactly are you training with that? If all you can manage is a tiny-ass vertical wall, then just go to the gym ffs."

That's pretty much half the abominations on facebook's home climbing wall group page.  You lose all ability to have flow and end up bored with the same basic moves forced by the terrain.    A clean, overhanging wall is so much sexier and allows for way more variety, even if that's counter intuitive."

bouldering,3b89nv,McSwaggotron,1 point,Fri Jun 26 19:56:56 2015 UTC,"80% of building the wall is planning and collecting the materials.   once you have everything with a helper  you can assemble in an afternoon or two.   it's actually pretty fun, and you'll get a huge feeling of accomplishment out of it - if you can spare a weekend I say do it yourself!"
bouldering,3b89nv,McSwaggotron,1 point,Sat Jun 27 05:31:26 2015 UTC,"Hey man, I built something basically exactly like what you are saying. I use it a lot and it has gotten me way stronger, I bloody love it. My board is 50 degrees overhanging, mainly because a moon board would be too high to have outdoors (neighbours might object etc), and because 50 degrees makes you very strong. I got a handyman to do it because I didn't want to build something substandard then get crushed by it, if it fell. Here is a picture  http://i.imgur.com/ha1e6Eq.jpg  It cost a fair bit to pay for the carpenter, but living in Australia had a lot to do with that. I also made almost all my holds out of wood, and they have turned out super well. I guess you could get that guy's wall he is selling, but you will get way stronger on a 50 degree wall than on a 35. If you are stretched for money though you might have to get the 35. If you have any more questions fire away, I am obsessed with my woody."
bouldering,3b89nv,freddiecrave,1 point,Sat Jun 27 00:53:15 2015 UTC,"That looks awesome, did you just find any regular carpenter? did he build walls before? or did you had to describe what you want? Do you have any issues with rain damage"
bouldering,3b89nv,McSwaggotron,2,Sat Jun 27 05:19:06 2015 UTC,"I just used a regular carpenter and made a really detailed design with him that I explained and discussed. Two months of planning went into this bad boy on my side, then I showed it to the carpenter and we had it built in a week. The only problem we had was that he made the frame 40 degrees overhanging at first instead of 50, I didn't explain it properly, but we fixed it easily enough. He hadn't built walls before, but really it isn't too complex for a proper carpenter to figure out. I don't have any issues with rain damage since we used high quality AA marine plywood, and I have a metal roof on top of it that the carpenter put on. I also have a large tarpaulin that I have nailed on top that I lay out when it rains, covering my mattresses and allowing me to train. That is what I am doing at this minute actually. I would highly recommend a 50 degree board by the way, it got me from projecting v3 to sending outdoors v7 in 6 weeks. 35 degree boards really don't make you as strong, as Malcolm Smith, Ben Moon, John Gaskins, Alex Puccio etc - all masters of the steep board."
bouldering,3b89nv,DobbyChief,1 point,Sat Jun 27 05:58:53 2015 UTC,You should definitely add some volumes to that wall. I have a very similar wall (size and angle) and the quality of problems and variety of moves increased enormously when I added a few different shaped volumes.
bouldering,3b89nv,McSwaggotron,2,Sat Jun 27 07:41:59 2015 UTC,"In my opinion volumes simply make moves easier, and since the purpose of the board is to get stronger, don't want volumes. I do occasionally climb at a gym in the city, and volumes can be fun. I get what you mean though."
bouldering,3b89nv,kepleronlyknows,2,Sat Jun 27 07:52:30 2015 UTC,The only use I can see for volumes is at the very sides to get some shoulder moves in.

You're right, apart from that I really don't think volumes are necessary. If you look at all the best training facilities, CATS where Daniel Woods trains, Malcolm Smith's home board, and the Schoolroom, none of those places had volumes, and for good reason."
bouldering,3b89nv,McSwaggotron,2,Sat Jun 27 11:45:24 2015 UTC,"It all comes down to what people want out of their wall.  I enjoy setting as much or more than training, so I like volumes."

bouldering,3b89nv,McSwaggotron,1 point,Sat Jun 27 16:16:25 2015 UTC,"Like, about 1500 dollars. It could have been much cheaper if the carpenter didn't have to spend more time there because we accidentally made the frame 40 degrees instead of 50, to make the holds etc. My carpenter was $45/hr, I am sure you could find a cheaper one, and if you made the process more streamlined I am sure you could cut the cost of paying the carpenter down to under $1000. Materials cost about $500, most of which came from the 3 high quality plywood pieces which I got from Bunnings. I got a separate set of holds later that cost $150 since I got it shipped from overseas, but really you don't need to buy holds, and if you had limited carpentry experience, a planer and an electric saw you could make all your holds out of scrap wood for free. If you want I could post some pictures of my holds and how I made them. I got the wood for free from a wood dealer, wood was very high quality and is very kind on the skin."

I also regularly strength trained in the gym, low reps with heavy weights on overhead press/squats/deadlifts etc. So I had pretty strong upper body when I began. Earlier than these I also rollerbladed and skateboarded for many years when I was younger. In my early 20's I also practiced Tai Chi for many years.  I think all these sports coming together give me a good mix of strength, balance and proprioception, that has helped me with climbing.

Climbing/playing outside, our parkour if your a grown up, can easily be equal to some V2-3 problems. If you're strong bodyweight-wise, flexible etc. things are a lot easier.  At one point I could muster 30+ one-arm pushups/17 pull-ups. So only a bit of technique and fingerstrength and you can see V5 is not so far away. If you're passionate about the sport and have all the free time in the world, as I did back then, I would say it's strange to not reach V5 in a year given those conditions.  Ofcourse some people don't need any of that. They're just naturals and get to V10+ in 2 years, which is on a whole different level... Actually, anything above V6-7 within two years is really good."
bouldering,3b3utk,YES_ITS_CORRUPT,3,Thu Jul 2 12:16:00 2015 UTC,"Some people are just naturals. They instinctively understand movement better than most, they are aware of their balance and position in space better than most, and they are aware of how to move vertically while using as little energy as possible better than most. A person like that with a background in gymnastics or power lifting or something else where they would have a strong musculature and strong ligaments in the shoulders, elbows, and wrists really only needs a modest amount of climbing specific technique and basic finger strength to climb some V5's. If they are a naturally thin person on top of that it's even easier. Remember though that not all boulder problems are created equal. Just because someone can do a few V5's doesn't mean they are solid at that level. I'd say very few people will be able to do V5 anywhere in the world with less than a year of training.  For what it's worth I struggled with this issue for a while as well when I'd see people with more strength than me but less technique and less experience get up something I'd gotten shut down on. But then I usually remember that because I have more experience I'm a more well rounded climber, I may not be able to do all the most powerful problems, but I'd rather be consistent. I'd rather be able to send V5 on slab, vertical, overhanging, roof, limestone, sandstone, granite, gneiss, and syenite and not be able to send V6 than be able to send V9 but only on one particular overhanging granite dyno problem."

And i've done a couple v5's.  For me, I've played tennis all my life, which has been an extreme help, pretty skinny dude, but with a good deal of upper body strength. It is mostly that last fact that as been able to help me. Although now as i'm nearing the v5 level i'm realzing that I really need to start focusing on form. I have the strength, but my form is so lacking I look like i'm a fish out of water as a climb, flopping all over the place ... I send the route, but it aint pretty!"

bouldering,3b3utk,Ontop1,2,Fri Jun 26 12:20:18 2015 UTC,"I started climbing last year and was at V5 in about 6 months with climbing on average once a week. I was held back by my fear of heights for a long time and it was a restricting factor for me, which I think ended up being good because it made sure I wasn't pushing too far.  I'd say this is because of a few factors.  I have friends who got me into sport and coach me routes whenever I climb with them. Remembering routes takes some time and when someone is telling you the moves it allows you to top them faster and in a way climb above what your mental game is. So getting to know someone more experienced and getting advice and climbing with them.  I was quite informed on how I wanted to start building muscle for the sport. Again friends gave a lot of help but some was just from weight lifting experience applied to climbing. I think it helps especially in the beginning to be able to do muscle work when you are recovering from burning your fore arms to the end.  I got informed of how not tear my finger tendons early on. From friends again and internet, this subreddit actually. A friend of mine who started at the same time has had a ton of tendon injuries in his fingers which probably has held him back a little, I'm pretty sure he knows but he's just that kind of an personality who stubbornly pushes on. Though that same friend probably climbs a grade higher because he pushes too far stubbornly.  I think the biggest factor is someone mentoring you while climbing the route.  The biggest mistake I made was trying to up my grade on 4/5 times I was climbing. This is because my competitive nature, I don't like climbing a grade lower than my friends. I think it's sort of silly to think of climbing in this way but I can't help it. Often times I didn't really enjoy the session that much because I was just going after the grade. I'd suggest having about 3 climbing sessions after a grade up where you try to enjoy climbing and do routes that you can top during a session."

Had been hitting a bad plateau at 6c (5.11b) for a few months before that, though. My main problem was endurance. Technically, I was pretty good, and always found betas suited to my body type.  Then I moved to someplace where I didn't know any climbers, so I picked up bouldering. Endurance is not the main concern in bouldering, so I managed to send V3 on my first day, V4 after a week, V5 after a month or so, and now there are a few V6 I can send. I have been bouldering 2 to 3 times a week for 3 months now.  I usually elude the question when I can, because people always seem impressed when I tell them how long I've been climbing and what I'm capable of. I think it's a very personal thing, some people will have it easier than others. I guess I was just given the right cards for the right sport, I'm very small (169cm), very light (54 kg) and I have a lot of balance.

I've crushed a 5 outside after like 15 minutes that took the guy that showed me the problem over a year. It just depends on the person man. Some people are just good at climbing. I entered my first comp at like 2 months in and got like 4th out of over 30 climbers climbing v3s. At about 6 months I got 2nd climbing 5s and 6s. I don't know what else to tell you besides some people just get good fast."

bouldering,3b3utk,stefanswagman,0,Thu Jun 25 20:12:38 2015 UTC,I think that it really depends on how you approach the sport. I am 14 years old and just started climbing 2 months ago. I sent my first V7 a few days ago and am super siked. I understand that the rating was my gym rating but I am still pretty proud of myself. I feel like if I would go outdoors i would fail miserabely. If you think that the sport is something that you want to be doing at a competitive level like your goal is to go to the world championships then you will get far. Of course you need to train hard to get there. I am just saying this out of things that other people said to me. I am young and have only been climbing for 2 mohts lol I have no idea what I am talking about in the end. Just wanted to put it out there. Idk is V7 good for only 2 months??

OP asked for insight on how you climbed V5 after a year. What you posted was a statement that can easily be read as you boasting about your achievement. That's probably why you got down voted.  OP: I think everyone else has stated everything I have to say on the topic. I am also one of those people I climbed my first 5 and my first 6 outside a little short of year.   I think it wasn't a result of anything special my part with the exception of being absolutely obsessive about climbing. It also didn't hurt that I started out with a pretty good base level of fitness. The other thing is that the two problems I found really suited my style. I could bang out really crimpy overhanging problems all day, but V3-4 sloper rigs would shut me down.   The last thing I'll say is that for me it was mental. When I stopped looking at it in terms of ""I'm going to climb this grade"" and looked at it as ""I'm gonna try hard as fuck on every problem I get on"" I blew through the mental cage that numbers had on me for the first 6 months."

From the youtube comments: It is illegal to crimp boltholes on the walls and on volumes, but not on holds...but Jorg didn't crimp a hole, he used the rounded head of the bolt that keeps the wooden panels attached to the structure (which has to be the worst hold to crimp ever: rounded, metallic and polished)."
bouldering,3b2bp3,Eternlgladiator,1 point,Thu Jun 25 15:20:42 2015 UTC,"I assumed that was a slab route and while I agree that a round, polished, metal bolt would be the worst hold ever, on a slab it was clearly the difference.

bouldering,3b1l5k,gumbykid,19,Thu Jun 25 05:56:09 2015 UTC,"depends on the gym!  not much space, maybe a bouldering section of a roped gym? it's kind of a waste of space setting ladder problems. Beginners can go do laps on the 5.6 auto belay.  bouldering gym? definitely needs to be accessible. i don't think v0 needs to be the easiest grade, VB should be ladders, V0 a little harder -- but they should all teach you something. even if it's just two holds angled in such a way that makes you bump to the next hold with the same hand, or feet that make you flag on the wall.  always make a problem teach somebody something"
bouldering,3b1l5k,TundraWolf_,8,Thu Jun 25 06:05:45 2015 UTC,"Around here a V0 is far more difficult that a ""ladder"". Hell, the very few VB named problems we have are far harder than any ladder. For me a V0 requires thoughtful application of good climbing technique. V0 around here is defiantly NOT new climber friendly and would be well beyond most new climbers. But that's outdoors.  Indoors a gym needs to cater to their users and beginners require something to climb. Call it pink tape, call it a V0.. who cares."
bouldering,3b1l5k,jimcdiver,5,Thu Jun 25 11:34:02 2015 UTC,"The V-system originated in Hueco Tanks, and around here, THIS is V0. Granted it was originally graded as a 5.9 toprope before people decided not to bring ropes to Hueco anymore, but still.   Originally, anything that was easier than about 5.11 was considered V0, and that includes ""ladders"". The current Hueco guidebooks usually throw in a + for those problems right on the cusp of V1 and a - for anything easier than about 5.9. Some places use VB for really easy stuff, but it varies.  Long story short, easy, ""ladder"" problems are V0 in the traditional sense, but so are problems with moves you'd find on a 5.10c, including technical movements like heel hooks, drop knees, gastons, rock overs, etc. If your gym doesn't divide V0 into V0-, V0, V0+, or add VB to the beginning of the scale, that's fine, but expect a lot of variation within V0."
bouldering,3b1l5k,jcarlson08,1 point,Thu Jun 25 15:04:37 2015 UTC,"Good answer, I just wish my gym understood it. If a V0 has anything but jugs they automatically make it a V1. Heel hooks are frowned upon until V2s.  So although there are technical moves in much lower grades, did the 'traditional' grading bump up the grades if the route required moves with more strength/power? Even at the hardest gyms I've been to, I've rarely seen a crimpy V0 even if it was a ladder."
bouldering,3b1l5k,jcarlson08,4,Thu Jun 25 18:03:57 2015 UTC,"From my experience climbing at Hueco, there are holds of all types on the V0s there, from relatively tiny crimps to two to three finger pockets to huge gaping bucket jugs. The angle of the climb has a lot to do with it; As far as I know there are no horizontal roofs at Hueco under V2 no matter how good the holds are (Nobody Gets Out of Here Alive has jugs the whole way), but there are some classic V0s which are on vertical to slightly-less-than-vertical rock with very small (for V0) crimps and pretty delicate movement (Memento comes to mind).   At the upper end of V0, power and/or technical ability can be very much required, at least outside. There are V0s with moves that, while easy for seasoned boulderers, would certainly be considered powerful and/or technical by beginners who struggle up 5.9.   Keep in mind this is all outside, and gyms have clients to cater to. The rock caters to no one. Bouldering outside began as a way for people who were already strong by the standards of the day to get stronger for ""real"" climbing. They didn't need to bother with the easy stuff. Today, when beginners go to the gym often the first thing they are exposed to is the bouldering wall, because the wall is shorter and they don't have to belay anyone. Lots of gyms realize that many true beginners aren't going to go from what amounts to climbing 5.6 to climbing 5.11 in a month, but realize that if those clients don't feel like they are making progress, especially in the first few visits, they'll get frustrated and leave. So they will fudge the numbers especially on the lower end so that people can say ""I went from V0 to doing my first V1 in a month! I'm going to keep coming!"". In reality they still made progress, but if the grades were a reflection of outdoor grades the progress would have been from doing easy V0s to harder V0s. Because of the way bouldering began, beginners see 16 grades on the V-scale and get frustrated not even being able to do the lowest one, not realizing the lowest grade encompasses by far the largest spectrum of difficulty.   At the end of the day, the problems in the gym aren't real; they'll be gone and replaced by new ones in a month or two. If your gym grades soft it's no big deal, because there are only two real grades: what you can do and what you can't. Just remember that when you move outdoors and don't get down on yourself when you can't do the Iron Man Traverse in Bishop even though you've done every V5 in your gym.   Images for reference:  Some dude on ""Memento"" V0 negotiating through the small flake crimps  ""Bawl and Chain"" V0 has a tough start and small edges  This is ""Dark Angel"" V0, a nice hand crack problem  ""The Melon Patch"" V0 has a powerful first move plus tricky footwork near the top"
bouldering,3b1l5k,Squidraider,3,Thu Jun 25 19:38:07 2015 UTC,"My understanding is that the V-scale is similar to the Ewbank scale starting from grade 20 (~5.10c), so V1 is roughly equivalent to a grade 21 (~5.10d-5.11a) climb."
bouldering,3b1l5k,straightCrimpin,1 point,Thu Jun 25 06:01:25 2015 UTC,"Similar to what I've learned. ""A V0- starts at ~5.10"". The problem is many people don't agree with the grade conversion.  Edit: A 5.10 is obviously going to be harder than a 0-. The idea is that a 5.10 has V0- movements, not holds/length."
bouldering,3b1l5k,greenlemon23,0,Thu Jun 25 06:07:22 2015 UTC,"Generally the idea is that the V-grade to YDS conversion is about crux difficulty. So a 10d is obviously harder than V0, but the crux on 10d should be no harder than V0. It can also set a minimum difficulty. So you can have a 20 foot 5.12a that is just a V4 boulder problem or a 100 foot 12a that is just a V4 boulder problem with a bunch of 5.9 climbing before and after and they both get the same grade."
bouldering,3b1l5k,straightCrimpin,1 point,Thu Jun 25 17:30:59 2015 UTC,"That doesn't make any sense at all. The crux on a 30 foot route will most likely be harder than the crux on a 60ft route, so you can't say that two 5.10- routes of those lengths would both have a V0 crux.   I think of it as V0 can be has hard to climb as a 5.10- and that V0- or VB is easier than that."
bouldering,3b1l5k,easywormfood,1 point,Thu Jun 25 21:45:32 2015 UTC,"The crux on a 30 foot route will most likely be harder than the crux on a 60ft route   This is usually, but not always true. Like I said in my example, if you have to do a V4 boulder problem then climbing 5.9 before and after shouldn't affect the grade whatsoever. The reason being is that 5.9 is piss easy compared to V4.  So 100 feet of 5.9 followed by a V4 would not get a harder YDS grade than 5 feet of 5.9 followed by a V4. In either case the climbing leading up to the V4 is so much easier than the crux that no matter what quantity of that climbing exists it doesn't contribute to the difficulty of the grade in any meaningful way.  This is less true at easier grades of course because you're less likely to see climbing of such ease that it doesn't tire you at all, followed by a boulder problem that is hard, in 5.10 or even 5.11 grades. In order for that to be the case and a route to still get 5.10 you'd have to have something like '80 feet of 5.5 followed by a V0', which should get around 10c or 10d. Comparatively a route that has 5 feet of 5.5 directly into a V0 should still get 10c or 10d, but routes with these characteristics aren't so common at the lower grades. Hopefully that helped explain things a bit."

bouldering,3b1l5k,smattiuz,2,Thu Jun 25 15:01:12 2015 UTC,Ideally gym grading scales should correspond roughly with the local outdoor climbing grades. This is incredibly difficult in practice but under this philosophy V0 should actually be quite difficult. A beginner should be able to do it but it might take a few tries. V0- or Vb would then be the 'anyone off the street can do it' grade.

Started chatting with the Italian setter, he tells me most things are easy for beginners. Shows me a couple of the easiest routes he set, there's heel hooking involved. Hell now, how the hell does a beginner even think about heel hooking on something? Where's the ""ladder"" one? But to him, that's no climbing and he told me that I suck because I didn't climb with him. Back in the UK gym and there's loads of ladder problems for real beginners, they are ""ungraded"", next ones are V0 and basically ""challenging ladders"" (not too challenging though, still good for a beginner).  I don't understand grades, I understand ""this is a ladder"" and ""this requires a bit more thinking"" and ""this requires you to be fucking good"" and so on. Grades are stupid."
bouldering,3b1l5k,jertakam,2,Thu Jun 25 09:53:26 2015 UTC,"Well grades assume that you know the beta.  So assuming the beginner knew that a heel hook was needed, and was told what a heel hook was, it depends on how challenging the move is.  I hopped on an untaped route at a local gym and was talking to the head setter about it. I thought the route was a V4 due to crimps and a mantle. He said it was a V1. Some people really try to match outdoor grades, while others try to make people feel good. That's why grades are stupid."

We've come across groups all the time that are climbing nothing but easy classics so I really don't think anybody would look down on you, and if so fuck em.   It's an awesome place, but that said, it is definitely a pain in the ass to make reservations. You can't make them more than 3 months in advance, you have to call to make them, and you can't make reservations for more than 3 days at a time. If you don't go over Thanksgiving or a long holiday it shouldn't be as bad, but you definitely want to be on the phone at 8am (mountain time!) making your reservation at that 3 month mark as they fill up so fast. Ideally, you would have reservations to climb, and then camp elsewhere. The Rock Ranch opens up late October but, if you are going before, last time I was there I camped at the metal building just down the road. It was cheap and worked for what we needed. The on-site camping is nice but they have a really strict 5:30 or 6pm curfew and you wouldn't really be able to go eat without sneaking out. We got caught sneaking out once and they threatened to kick us out.   Like the other poster said, -definitely- try and get a guide to take you out to East or West. It snowed the day we were supposed to out but there are some amazing lower-grade classics that I'm dying to climb.  Let me know if you have any questions if you decide to go! Oh and Hueco is -definitely- graded harder than most, so don't be shocked if some V3's kick your ass. Just embrace the easy classics and you'll have a blast!"
bouldering,3auekt,renco,1 point,Tue Jun 23 23:07:48 2015 UTC,"Thanks very much for the thorough rundown. Nice to hear the perspective of someone who climbs around our level.   Also, great to know about the reservation game that needs to be played -- sounds like I should set some calendar reminders or something to remember to do that.  Will look into guides as well."
bouldering,3auekt,jcarlson08,2,Wed Jun 24 16:27:28 2015 UTC,"Hueco Local and volunteer guide here,  There are lots of classics V4 and below at Hueco that you will enjoy, both on North Mountain and the backcountry. If you are going to try and find problems on North by yourself, I'd recommend a guidebook, or running around with someone who knows where stuff is at. Obviously in the backcountry, where a guide is required, you won't have that problem.   It is NOT difficult to get into Hueco if you know when you are coming and you plan ahead. North Mountain is open to 70 people at a time, with 60 of those spots available for reservations each day. You can start making reservations 3 months in advance, and obviously, the earlier the better. To make North Mountain reservations, you call the TPWD hotline in Austin at  (512) 389-8911. If you make North Mountain reservations for a certain day, show up before 10:00am OR call the park in the morning and ask them to hold your reservation. At 10 any no-show reservations are canceled and offered to people waiting for entrance on a first-come, first-serve basis. Entrance to the park is $7 per day per person, or someone with a TPWD Park Pass can get a whole car-load in for free. Park passes are $70 so if you will all be carpooling into the park and are staying long enough, it may be worth it to split a pass among you.   There are two ways to get access to the backcountry: Volunteer and Commercial Guided tours. Commercial tours are contracted through an approved guide agency. Currently there are 3, the Climbers of Hueco Tanks Coalition, Wagon Wheel Co-opt , and Sessions Climbing. With a commercial tour you can request that the tour be private (if you just want it to be you and your friends), and you don't have to worry about a guide being available. The downside is it will cost more: expect $20 minimum per person and up to $60+ if you want the tour to be private and only have a few friends.  Volunteer tours are cheaper: $7 park entrance fee (waived if you have a TPWD Parks Pass) + $2 tour fee, per person. To request a volunteer tour, call the park front office at (915) 849-6684, up to 3 months in advance. The park will schedule up to 4 volunteer tours per day. If you don't have enough people to fill up the tour (max for both commercial and volunteer tours is 10+guide), the park WILL open the remaining spots to others in an attempt to fill up the tour. If you show up on the day of your tour and you don't have all the people you said you would, they will open the spots to people waiting at the gate or the office for entrance and they WILL take them. Don't expect to have a volunteer tour that's not full unless it's the offseason. Another issue is that guides are assigned to tours on a first-come first-served basis per day. If you are the fourth group to request a guided volunteer tour on a certain date, but only 2 guides have called and said they can volunteer that day, you're SOL. Even if you make your reservation 3 months in advance, don't expect guides to confirm until about the week prior, sometimes up to a day or two prior. The park does it's best to find guides to take out tours, but it doesn't always happen. Feel free to call the office during the week prior and they will be happy to let you know if your tour has a guide yet.        Anyway, if you decide to come to Hueco, I hope this information was useful! Don't shy away because of the access restrictions, just plan ahead and you'll be fine! October and November aren't terribly busy yet anyway, the real crowds show up from late December to March!"

bouldering,3auekt,AFunnyName,1 point,Fri Jul 3 03:44:54 2015 UTC,"I think every boulderer should make a pilgrimage to Hueco at one point or another, but doing so while climbing at ~V4 won't allow you take full advantage of all that Hueco has to offer. Don't get me wrong Hueco has a ton of classics to offer in those grades, but it is my opinion that most of the mega-classics are pushing V7. If you were within a day of Hueco I'd totally recommend you go regardless of your grade, but if you're traveling a large distance I'd be much more hesitant.   However if your heart is set on Hueco, you're gonna have a fucking blast. My only recommendation is that you do at least half your trip with a guide. It's $20 a day and you get access to so many more classics. North mountain has a lot to offer, but you could spend your entire life on west, east, and the spur."
bouldering,3auekt,andylibrande,1 point,Tue Jun 23 21:07:32 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the info. Out of curiosity, do you have another place in mind that would be good for our grade?  Appreciate the tip about the guide as well."

Will be sure to let you all know where we end up deciding to go.  Also, I think that we're going to stay away from the Southeast just b/c that's where I'm from and will save that for a shorter roadtrip as opposed to one where we need to fly someone and take off a bunch of work.  Let us know if there are any other spots that we should consider!"
bouldering,3auekt,mattles54,0,Wed Jun 24 16:29:21 2015 UTC,"Bishop, CA is also another great option and may be a lot more accessible for you then Joe's Valley since you have to fly to get there, figure out pads, transportation, etc. The Happy/Sad Boulders have more then enough to keep you occupied plus many other areas.   Also grades outside tend to be a lot different then grades inside so make sure there is plenty several grades below what you climb inside."
bouldering,3auekt,gwaybz,1 point,Wed Jun 24 17:55:35 2015 UTC,There's too much hassle at Hueco. And crowds...though that's mostly at the entrance and classics (saying this with no personal experience just the impression I've got over the years).  I would say Joe's Valley like the other guy. Its stupid beautiful (especially with a bit of snow up on the mesas). I didn't have the best trip there only because I could only spend 1 day there and its very spread out. But if you're spending a week there its perfect. Camping access is stupid easy and the Food Barn (or whatever its called) is like 5 mins away with all the supplies you'd need and really really good food. And...a toilet!

bouldering,3apqlg,Eternlgladiator,10,Mon Jun 22 14:36:35 2015 UTC,"A v1 on a vertical wall should be approximately the same difficulty as a v1 on an overhang. This means bigger, more positive holds, closer together with more plentiful and good feet. The v1 on the overhang will use a different skillset to climb so if you are not used to it, it may feel significantly harder.  If you took a v1 set on vertical wall, and set the same holds on the overhang it would no longer be a v1."

bouldering,3aqi93,elcheapo,2,Mon Jun 22 18:09:34 2015 UTC,"RMNP is probably the last place you'd want to go.  Very few flat landings (it's almost all in a big talus field), and one of the longest, least stroller friendly approaches in Colorado (roughly an hour if you're not used to hiking at high altitude). Plus the weather can turn to shit really quickly, not ideal for infants.  I'm trying to think of some suggestions but I'm kinda blanking right now.  How hard do y'all boulder roughly?"

There are plenty of easy hikes in the area with lots of boulders to go on. Most are pretty easy hikes but not really stroller friendly. areas around the Flatirons, and Flagstaff including the satellites might be worth looking in to. Also might be worth taking a day indoors at The Spot and asking around. The staff is friendly and they have tons of books and guides for the local area."

Recently, I've been making much more consistent progress with my ability to quickly climb V3, but I've also found myself deadpointing and bumping between holds more frequently. For some reason, I feel almost like this is 'cheating' as I've heard that static movement often means better technique.  My question is, will my more frequent use of deadpointing/bumping hamper my progression? On the one hand, I used to not be able to even get up a route through any means, but on the other I don't want to be using poor technique. Should I go back and do all the 'easier' routes with static movement, or just climb harder routes until deadpointing/bumping is no longer enough?"
bouldering,3apjg4,mh18_95,3,Mon Jun 22 16:56:39 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't necessarily say it's better technique overall, I myself am a quite dynamic climber and wouldn't climb anywhere near what I do if I had to do every move statically.   Not every move is even possible to do statically, and vice versa as not every move can be done dynamically. You need to be able to determine whether a move will require more energy if done dynamically or statically which requires a lot of knowledge (gained from climbing a lot of stuff) and technique.   I always find the best approach to take is to do every move that can be done static, static. In the lower grades this is the vast majority of moves generally excluding dynos and other types of moves that require the momentum or very quick moves. Ultimately by climbing statically you will improve your technique as the moves require more strength to move more slowly. Though you may find that you will always climb better dynamically as your body may be more suited to it. Your goal is to make every climb feel as easy as possible to yourself no matter what that takes.  I'd say continue to climb as hard as you can however you can whilst doing all the problems below your limit as statically as you can. Use static movements as you increase your strength and improve your technique and do the move that feels easiest. Eventually as you progress you will likely be forced to use more static movement to even complete the problem."
bouldering,3apjg4,hurtinyofeelins,3,Mon Jun 22 17:48:28 2015 UTC,"The biggest issue I have with beginners and overly dynamic movement is that it often encourages focus onto the arms and upper body.   Slow, static movement is especially important as a beginner because it helps to dial in awareness of the feet and legs.  I see far too many people at my gym (especially tall people) who can ""climb v6"" and their footwork is an absolute travesty."
bouldering,3apjg4,thejoaq,3,Mon Jun 22 21:23:51 2015 UTC,"It's not that any one method is 'cheating' it's that climbing with only one style can hamper your progression. When climbing problems that are not near your limit, climbing in ways that are uncomfortable/unfamiliar for you (statically if you are naturally dynamic, focusing on back-stepping if you usually keep your hips square, etc) will help round out your skill set. This will give you more tools when climbing near your limit and should help you progress."

Both gyms I go at only use color-based systems (basically : easy, medium, hard, very hard, insane). I can do every ""hard"" boulders with 2 to 8 try (except overhangs >=35°). Technique-wise I'm familiar with toe-hook, heel hooks etc. Drop knee and so on. My biggests flaws are probably mental (big long dynamics moves), finger strenght and ARC.    Right now I just go to the gym, warm-up on easy/medium boulders. Then, I re-do the ""hard"" boulders I already done then try the overhanging ones. Sometimes I finish with 3 sets of 8 pull-ups and 3 frenchies. I can climb 4 times a week for the 2 months to come, then I don't know (hangboard maybe?).   Thanks"
bouldering,3apjg4,rhirhirhi_,5,Mon Jun 22 14:48:33 2015 UTC,"I think you need to try more overhanging stuff- not necessarily the set problems, but try making up problems on the 35° board that take you a few sessions to do.  One of the possible reasons you could be struggling on overhangs is your body tension- try doing leg raises on a bar, sit ups, things which will strengthen your core and make it easier to keep your feet on. This will make it easier to apply the techniques you already use (toe hook, drop knee, heel hooks) on a steeper piece of the wall."

bouldering,3apjg4,hurtinyofeelins,2,Mon Jun 22 19:34:41 2015 UTC,The most difficult thing to get used to on steep overhangs is actively using your feet. Really grind your toes into the holds so they don't slip out. This takes a lot of core strength sometimes.

bouldering,3apjg4,IcedchickenKing,1 point,Thu Jun 25 17:02:16 2015 UTC,"Climbing for a few months and had my first finger scare. At hour two, I felt a little stretch in the outermost joint of my pointer finger  while working a problem. I stopped and it doesn't hurt to be squished/manipulated any more (35-40 hours later). Should I be worried / taking a break? Or am I good to go on climbing so long as I keep it stretched and loose? I just don't wana make a costly mistake with my ligaments early on and wreck my summer..   Thanks!"
bouldering,3apjg4,Chillibby,1 point,Tue Jun 23 20:26:50 2015 UTC,"I've been bouldering for about a year now and am having two issues at my current skill level. In my fav gym (wilkes-barre rock gym) I consistently climb v5, and in the gyms near my home (hudson valley gyms, theres a couple) I consistently climb v6-v7, but the setting is either a little soft/different.   My issues are 1) how to develop better power endurance without jumping into sport climbing. I currently have short campus sessions with other pull-up exercises mixed in, but I've only been doing this for about a month. Should I just continue doing this or is there something better? I already work my core seperately when I'm doing cardio, my issue is that over the course of a session I only get like 10 attempts on problems that require overhanging lock-offs without it becoming to tough. I generally perform best on roofs/steep overhangs, so this power endurance is something I'd like to continue building on.  2) How to translate gym technique outside. I boulder at the Gunks very often at anything from v2-v4 level (v4 is recent, finally got Andrews roof, The Lorax, and The Fin over the past week). What I've noticed is that when I'm in a gym I climb very methodically, static when needed and dynamic when needed. I'll put weight on my feet and keep straight arms unless choking up on a hold is needed. What I've noticed climbing outdoors is that the holds are just never as good, and I choke up on them even when I don't need to. I feel like this is mostly due to a lack of confidence in my footwork outdoors. I get scared to throw hard drop knees, and really pull in on the tiny footholds in order to get the hips close to the wall. Well maybe not scared, but I just don't crank into those feet nearly as hard as I do in a gym. Any tips on approaching this mental/technique block?  Any help would be greatly appreciated!"

I've even been able to start from the extension which adds five more moves and still get shutdown on the last move. At one point I think it was power endurance but it now is 100% mental. If it happens again for another month I'm going to change my middle name to punter.
bouldering,3am91d,Hip-pie,4,Sun Jun 21 16:55:18 2015 UTC,"mental is a big factor yeah, i should have done it on my 1st go that day but didnt (not 100% there) and im just not strong enough to do it on later attempts :(  2 weeks break to get my fingers resting and it will be taken down by then :("
bouldering,3am91d,BluntTruthGentleman,2,Sun Jun 21 17:02:43 2015 UTC,"Looks like a good route! You may want to consider:  -resting mid climb between the volumes  -dropping a knee or even flagging on the last move  -twisting into the top out.

bouldering,3am91d,solo220,8,Sun Jun 21 21:02:56 2015 UTC,"No.  You aren't twisting, at all, and don't need to explode here.  Some people I climb with have very little in the way of muscular output but more than make up for it with good form, and can do routes that I can't.    If you are Jan Hojer, yes, muslce right up that.  But my mentality is why needlessly waste energy if you can get up a different way much simpler?  You posted here asking for help/advice, and I'm giving you my two cents.  Try twisting more to extend your reach instead of pulling your entire body.  It may surprise you in terms of efficient movement!"
bouldering,3am91d,fehler404,-3,Sun Jun 21 22:23:00 2015 UTC,"im not. the thing is the last move IS a deadpoint (i cannot do it in another way), also needing explosiveness. jeah i should twist more (i didnt because my left heel was still under the hold which isnt the right beta, since i should toehook with the left foot which gives me some extrareach), but i tryed to do that despite using the wrong beta in the case (also i did not try to reach up with both hands if you watch the vid closely, i was just matching on the hold before to save energy)"

To me it looks like your feet are popping off before executing the move. It often helps me to concentrate extra hard on using my legs when dealing with this kind of problem.   You are also campusing up to the very last hold and then use your right foot to advance with your left hand and then your left foot for bicycling the hold. It looks to me as if the left part of the hold would be better suited for standing on. I don't know how bad the last hold is but could there be any chance that you could lean to the right and change the feet so you could push up with your left foot standing on the left edge of the hold you are currently using or even get it up on the second-to-last hold? Hm. I think that could be too awkward of a position if you're not very flexible.  Where did you get those yoga pants?"
bouldering,3am91d,indigent3,0,Sun Jun 21 17:08:25 2015 UTC,"thanks, the beta is to press the hold for the feet with the left toe and then deadpoint to the top, my left foot stopped that with the heel (dunno why i set it that way, prob tired) because the left foot should pop off while the right foot stays on the hold for some extramomentum.  borrowed them from friend, they are comfortable as fuck!"
bouldering,3am91d,milyoo,3,Sun Jun 21 17:58:56 2015 UTC,"*Isolate individual moves and make them more efficient. This will improve your technique and you'll be a lot less tired.  *Breathe more   Relax a little, speed is important but if you're applying too much force on every move it's a terrible waste   Also right when you came out of the cave it looked like a nice spot to rest."
bouldering,3am91d,straightCrimpin,0,Sun Jun 21 23:18:42 2015 UTC,"that was actually the most efficient attempt. i've done some before and because i relaxed a little i came off the wall at some point or did mistakes using too much energy in return. was the 5th go of the day on this monster which imo resulted in a very controlled and efficient attempt, but at a little tired state."
bouldering,3am91d,milyoo,3,Sun Jun 21 23:26:47 2015 UTC,"So, just my 2 cents.  Could you work on getting a high left heel hook, and kind of static the mantle type move.  Sweet problem, props to the setter and the climber, smooth."
bouldering,3am91d,Krakatoas,0,Mon Jun 22 05:44:34 2015 UTC,"not really, the heel would be too close to the hands and the handhold is so small and slippery any sideforce would pull my hands straight off."

bouldering,3aoeu3,MyBitchCassiopeia,5,Mon Jun 22 06:18:16 2015 UTC,"Dense closed cell foam is what breaks your fall when you land on a crash pad. Usually crashpad manufacturers use a sandwich of 1/2"" closed cell on the bottom, 2-4"" open cell in the middle, and then an inch of closed cell on the top. The closed cell breaks you fall and dissipates the energy over a greater area, which is then absorbed by the middle open cell.   A sofa cushion doesn't have any closed cell, therefore when you land on one the force from your landing is not dissipated over a larger area, just straight down into the soft open cell foam."
bouldering,3aoeu3,soupyhands,1 point,Mon Jun 22 15:10:30 2015 UTC,ELI5 version: if its all soft and open cell you're going to feel the ground through it when you fall on it.

I cut it, and sewed a hinged backpackable outer sleeve/case for it out of discount fabric. Then I slid thick cardboard inside (which I'd swap out when it got broken down), which was always on top. Worked pretty well, actually.  But couch cushions are way, way too soft. They'd do basically nothing..."

bouldering,3aoeu3,gumbykid,0,Mon Jun 22 23:52:19 2015 UTC,"1) You need soft and dense foam for a safe crash pad. Sofa/mattress is soft.  2) The $150 range contains a lot of quality, medium-sized crash pads.  3) You can build your own crash pad. Normally it ends up costing the same, but if you can salvage foam from junk then it can only cost around $100. It's a lot of work though."

bouldering,3aod7y,heidavey,1 point,Mon Jun 22 07:57:53 2015 UTC,"Looks slabby with big holds. In which case, you might not have the difficulty to break into true bouldering unless you contrive the lines i.e. designate and eliminate holds. For frame of reference, a Heuco V0 is a line or set of holds with an average difficulty of YDS 5.9, Hueco V5 is a solid 5.12. This looks like maaayybe a 5.7, at best.  Best way to establish and grade problems is to compare the climb difficulty to others in the area. If there are no comparisons, place the climb within your own skill level and ask others to climb and grade it."
bouldering,3aod7y,BillytheClinton,1 point,Mon Jun 22 11:57:23 2015 UTC,"The rules are sloppy. When ""establishing"" a route, you can choose a starting area or starting hold.

bouldering,3an0m4,AssEffectIII,8,Sun Jun 21 20:44:36 2015 UTC,"You have found the solution, but its not a one time thing. Go back and climb 10 routes V0-V1, and any one the V2's you have gotten. Then climb them again and focus on going slow, like you are moving through water slow.   Try and do each move in a way that you are using your whole body. Feel the connection from your toes, up through your legs, and into your shoulders and arms. Most easy routes are set to flow very smoothly, while putting the least amount of body weight on the arms as possible. Work on placing your feet in places that give you great leverage to get to the next hold.  As easy routes will have larger holds, once you have finished climbing all the routes, work on them again, but try skipping holds. Try and keep the same type of leverage on these bigger moves. Unless a route absolutely forces a push off from a lower foot, try keeping three points of contact onto the wall for every move. You should be able to keep your body completely still, or have only a slight push from a bent leg to reach the next hold.   I don't know the quality of the easy routes at your gym, but all of the gyms I have been to have V0-V1's that can be turned into V2/3's by cutting out a few holds. These routes tend to have larger holds that you will be least likely to injure yourself on before your tendon strength catches up with your muscles.   As a last note, remember that there are no rules. If you are just messing around not working on a project and a move on a route doesn't feel right, just use any footholds. The goal is to find a balance in your whole body and discover what gravity does to it, and how you can beat it."

Towards the end he gets a super gnarly heel hook with his solution foot, I can almost guarantee his teams wouldn't do that. Perhaps he prefers teams so he is still wearing one and just using the solution for the heel hook, or perhaps the team is also necessary for some of those feet.  OR if he's like me the teams are almost new and the solutions have holes in the feet so I only use them for hard heel hooks. Like yesterday on a V11 I was working on."
bouldering,3akiua,smattiuz,1 point,Sun Jun 21 16:48:44 2015 UTC,"I wasn't joking tbh, I've seen many achieving the same with the same pair of shoes. Also, I've witnessed people at various bouldering comps (amateur to world cups) doing that, failing and then realising that their beta was wrong in the first place.  Also, I've always wondered: if that difficult toe hook (for example) happens on your left and on your right, what do you do? swap shoes mid ascend?  I'm slightly taking the piss here, I know, but also curious."

bouldering,3akiua,gumbykid,2,Sun Jun 28 16:31:02 2015 UTC,"You are correct in that it isn't purely V11 moves. If I remember correctly, this route is combined of 3 other challenging routes, two of them in reverse. The routes are something like V6, V8, and V10 when they aren't reversed. The length helps bump up the grade.  Hard routes can be juggy if they have challenging positions, like this one. In addition, many of these holds are actually quite slopey and the rock is quite slick. I can't really confirm the grade, but there's reasoning behind it."

bouldering,3ala2z,karlyeurl,1 point,Mon Jun 22 16:08:10 2015 UTC,"The video is based on the stream, not on the actual recorded file. So however bad the stream was, that's how bad the youtube video is. I hope IFSC will upload the better version soon.  What happened is that the first climber topped the route, but made a wrong start (right foot was off the start hold before the left hand was on the start hold). A referee saw it, but another referee had confirmed the top, so there was an appeal, and a video check.  The video check confirmed that the appeal was correct, and invalidated the top, so Tsukuru Hori had to redo the climb (whithin whatever time remained when he first topped)."

bouldering,3aeb1a,ADB315,4,Fri Jun 19 12:40:33 2015 UTC,WVU student here. Coopers is what your looking for in the area. The area is beautiful to camp and has a wide variety of difficulties. There is a guide book out there that does a pretty good job detailing main problems. If you have any questions about the area shoot me a PM. I will be in Morgantown at the beginning of July if you want someone to climb with.
bouldering,3aeb1a,wile-ecoyote,3,Fri Jun 19 12:52:09 2015 UTC,"All of this. In regard to camping: across the highway from the State Park are a few campgrounds w really reasonable rates. There's a few spots to camp in the Park itself but I've heard they sell out super quick at the beginning of the season.   The climbing throughout the Park is definitely the best in the area. Tons of bouldering problems all over and some really good top rope routes as well.   Trails are abundant through the entire park and look really suitable for mountain biking, I ride a road bike so unfortunately I can't speak to the quality.   EDIT: you can find the guidebook on Amazon, it's worth it for sure (will save TONS of time looking for climbing areas & problems): Coopers Rock Bouldering Guide (Bouldering Series) https://www.amazon.com/dp/076274281X/ref=cm_sw_r_awd_DybHvb8YHGYVT"

Maybe each layer should have 2 gradients giving you 8 holds rather than 4.  lastly, they look good. best of luck."
bouldering,3a98kd,Done2me,6,Thu Jun 18 09:14:42 2015 UTC,"Not gonna lie, these actually look pretty cool. My only question is, what accounts for the difference in prices? $55 vs. $25 for similar looking boards... does the change in woods change the quality of how it works/holds up?"
bouldering,3a98kd,Highpothetically,4,Thu Jun 18 07:00:15 2015 UTC,I guess the wood. I mean zebrawood vs poplar/oak is a big difference (Over here massive zebrano goes for € 4.8k per m3 and oak around € 3.8k per m3)
bouldering,3a98kd,Mithdir,4,Thu Jun 18 08:48:33 2015 UTC,"Exactly. The price varies based on the cost of each wood. Each functions exactly the same, but each wood does have a different density, and therefore vary in strength That being said, all can withstand a reasonable standard of load on each rail."
bouldering,3a98kd,Sherlocked_,6,Thu Jun 18 13:31:27 2015 UTC,"Why have different strengths wood? If the cheapest can hold up to like 300lbs, then why not just use that wood for everything? And if it doesn't support 300lbs, it probably shouldn't be sold at all. Looking at these they all look exactly the same, so if I were to get one I would just buy the cheapest. And If I buy the cheapest and it breaks, I would complain and leave a bad review. It would make inventory much more simple to just have one and use color, different grips, different sizes, etc as your differential."
bouldering,3a98kd,deathe_breeply,3,Thu Jun 18 15:13:02 2015 UTC,"You're totally missing the point of why they are making these in different woods. This is meant to look good on your wall, probably sacrificing a bit of function, and act as a display piece. If you want some splatter paint looking molded hangboard that morbidly obese people can work on without breaking, go buy one of those for $75. I personally think the purpleheart one looks awesome, and would pay a few more dollars for it."
bouldering,3a98kd,Sherlocked_,2,Thu Jun 18 23:25:51 2015 UTC,"Exactly. Honestly, we are fairly new climbers and we feel that will be a big part of our customer base. We aren't sending V15s and we don't feel we needed a $180 hangboard. We put our heads together and made something we think is functional, looks nice, and doesn't empty your pockets.

bouldering,3a98kd,Hip-pie,3,Thu Jun 18 11:54:30 2015 UTC,"Rock Prodigy is not a very good board.   The dual texture transition on the small crimps is a skin blender.   Once I was able to get the finish into a skin-friendly state I was left with a texture-less 8mm edge.  The pinches are pretty useful but you really don't need them on a board.   Same thing with the tapered thickness on the medium edges.   It's a novel space-saving feature but wholly unnecessary.   The only real innovation is the split design.   I have lots of respect for their training methodology (for route specific programming), but this board is a case study in over-engineering.   I own one and rarely use it.  In fact, I get more mileage out of the 3/4"" and 1/4"" edges I bought at Lowe's for 4 bucks.   All this (plus polyurethane!) for 100 dollars more than the OPs board.    Edit: Downvote away.   I've owned all but a few boards produced since 1999, and this one is NOT very useful despite the (totally unrelated) success of their book."

On vertical walls gravity keeps you on foot holds but on overhangs you need to help out."
bouldering,3a8jpo,sheepweevil,1 point,Thu Jun 18 20:31:06 2015 UTC,"Sit ups and crunches. If you've got a pull-up bar, hang on it and raise your hips/legs like you would if you were trying to keep your feet on overhang holds."
bouldering,3a8jpo,figmaxwell,2,Thu Jun 18 02:30:24 2015 UTC,Beta beta beta. Make sure you have all your beta locked down before hand to avoid wasting time. You can get away with figuring the beta out on most climbs but roof climbing is a timed event and if your beta sucks you're just wasting your time.  Engaging your core at moments that matter is ver important. Your core doesn't have to be 110% engaged every moment and you'll waste energy if it is. Only engage it hard when you feel the move can't be made without it.   Keep your feet on as much as possible. You will run into situations where it is easier to cut your feet then trying to hold a move at full reach. But for the most part try to keep your feet on since it will help take strain off of your arms.   Rest when you can. The great part about most roof climbs is you can find at least one rest spot even on V13's. Find a spot you can shake out on and slow down your breathing. Try to lower your heart rate and chalk up if the roof is long enough and you feel you need it.   Climbing roofs takes time and patience. It won't come easy maintaining since it is a rare type of climbing and most people don't get enough time try roofs. As you climb roofs you'll organically develop TONS of core strength. I would recommend running 4x4s on easier roof problems or even on a 45 just to build the core to help you on harder problems.
bouldering,3a8jpo,Hip-pie,1 point,Thu Jun 18 21:20:45 2015 UTC,"To add onto the importance of beta: assuming you're not on a tight deadline (like the wall is going to be reset tomorrow), I think it's worth trying to work out the problem in pieces. I just finally finished a roof problem where getting to the crux move was easy but I got stuck after that...so I figured out the body position I need to be in after that move to finish the route, and then spent a while just jumping on in the middle and trying to work out the crux. By that point I was too tired to finish the whole climb, but since I had the moves worked out it was easy to finish it first thing on the next gym session."
bouldering,3a8jpo,draqza,2,Mon Jun 22 23:08:36 2015 UTC,"Do it a lot. Press on with your feet like crazy. Everything you learned about technique before still applies, it's just way more important now."
bouldering,3a8jpo,kennethsime,2,Fri Jun 19 04:24:59 2015 UTC,"I agree with this loads, I found it helped my over hang climbing loads. There's a tendency to just think about the hands and not your feet, so when you move, your feet come swinging off the wall. Before you take your hand off to move, make sure your foot is firmly locked in."

bouldering,3a72zi,BlazeBroker,2,Wed Jun 17 19:09:18 2015 UTC,"Sounds most like a flexor tendon tear, (see here) It's a pretty serious injury. I would highly recommend seeing a sports medicine specialist, or a doctor with experience with hand injuries."
bouldering,3a72zi,Parties_naked,1 point,Thu Jun 18 00:23:27 2015 UTC,"Would love to see a Dr, but I don't have the money right now. My reading is leading me to believe you are right in it being the flexor tendon. I don't think it is fully ruptured or torn, maybe just pulled. I am going to ice it and take ibuprofen and assess it over the coming days. Would be happy if it was a pulled tendon as my understanding is they heal much faster than ruptured pullies.     Thanks for the feedback. If you have any other info on treatment, In would be very interested."
bouldering,3a72zi,Frostiestone,4,Thu Jun 18 00:31:52 2015 UTC,"I have strained my flexor tendon. Both of them, each ring finger. It fucking sucks. Never had a pulley injury, just this. It's not enjoyable. Luckily I'm pretty good friends with a very knowledgeable climber (pro, in fact). 6 weeks off of climbing. End of discussion. No climby climb. It's hard, I know. Doing PT to prevent it from happening again is the key, and this can be done in the time you'd be spending climbing. That, and core work, or some cardio to take its place, and you'll almost be glad to give your body a rest. Look up Rice Bucket for good injury prevention, it's an awesome tool and I love using it, it's pretty fun.   Now, once you do get back to climbing...   Tape your ring finger to your pinky. The flexor tendons in these fingers are connected. You'll probably notice that if you curl your pinky down and put pressure on your ring finger, it hurts like hell. Well we often don't notice when we drop our pinkies while climbing. After this injury, you certainly fucking will, mate. It'll hurt. Save yourself the pain and tape those bad guys up. Get in the habit of trying to never drop your pinkies. There's a actually a really strong tendon in there that we seldom work out as much as the others, and it causes imbalance, etc... Anyways. 6 weeks. I recommend taping them together now. Hot therapy. Rice bucket therapy. Core work. Cardio. Easy return to climbing, never drop pinkies....  And after all this, you've learned a hell of a lot about those precious hands. Best of luck man. You can do it. If you don't take my advice that's fine, but it's the most good natured advice I can give."
bouldering,3a72zi,Frostiestone,1 point,Thu Jun 18 02:20:20 2015 UTC,"THanks! I sure have been learning a lot about hands. I do rice bucket exercises already to exercise the extensors(?) in my forearms that don't normally get used in climbing. I assume you mean that I should do grip exercises with the bucket when my hand is able, yeah?     I tried the pinky thing, and . . . Wow. No kidding. You see to have called it. I am glad you mentioned tape because I'm sure I would have been in a world of hurt in the future without it. I'm delighted to hear that 6 weeks is a reasonable recovery time, I have spent the day trying to wrap my head around 6 months for a pulley injury and felt shattered. This gives me hope.     I want to thank you and all the others who took the time to read and respond to my post. Your advice and feedback has been invaluable, especially since I can't afford a doctor at this time. I have really come to love climbing and the community here has only reaffirmed that joy.     I will post updates in the coming weeks as I make progress. You guys rock!"

At the time, when climbing, I didn't even notice anything. It was only when I woke the next day that the pain started. If I so much as touched anything with my ring finger I was getting extreme pain down the finger into my mid forearm.  I took 7 days out, and now when I climb I don't get much pain. That is unless I 3 finger crimp something, leaving out the pinky. The pain that causes is unreal. Does this sound like a flexor tendon strain, or something else? Should I be climbing? I'm taking care to avoid crimps, but don't want to risk making this any worse..."

bouldering,39znll,B0ulderer,4,Tue Jun 16 02:11:07 2015 UTC,"Welcome to the wonderful world of bouldering! Little might you know, but you answered part of your question right in your post! ;)  First things first: technique. Feet don't blow off by magic; it's always some literal imbalance in the way you're holding your weight to the rock. Focus on your feet. Focus on your body position. Try and ""feel"" how much friction you have on the rock, and learn to correlate it to how little weight you actually need to stay on. These are all skills that you'll need to master to avoid having your feet blow, which is one of the most common precursors to injury.  Beyond that, part of being a good athlete is more than being strong, or even about having good technique, it's about knowing when to stop. As Wolfgang Gullich said, ""getting strong is easy, getting strong without getting injured is hard"". Knowing your limits is a skill in and of itself. It has taken me a good 3 years to understand when my fingers need to stop, and they have been a really difficult 3 years, with constant multi-month set backs as my fingers would get fried as soon as I'd be touching the v8 range.  Learn to listen to your body, practice your footwork, and see if you can find a mentor to speed up the path to better technique. I was injured constantly in my first 2 years, and can happily say it injuries are far and few between . . . but they still happen, as it is just the nature of the beast.  EDIT: If you want to get really serious about injury prevention, pick up Dave Macleod's book on climbing injuries. This thing is incredible, and goes into the science in a very approachable way. Also, listen to /u/gumbykid."

bouldering,39znll,gumbykid,1 point,Tue Jun 16 17:18:07 2015 UTC,"Then rest may not be as big of an issue. My next bet would be muscular imbalances.  To prevent shoulder injuries, you should work out your chest. To prevent wrist injuries, you should work out your forearm extensors. Ankle injuries are likely due to poor footwork and landing."
bouldering,39znll,hafilax,2,Tue Jun 16 17:30:49 2015 UTC,"I think you might be suffering from too much too fast. Your body wasn't up for the sudden plunge into serious bouldering. My guess is you injured something, tried to keep going by avoiding that injury and overworked something else.  Any time I've had an injury that wasn't getting better I took some serious time off. The longest was 6 months and 2 weeks is the minimum. When you come back you take it really easy. Don't ""test"" the injuries.  My current routine is going to the gym twice a week and one or two days outside on the weekend. My gym time I limit to sessions of about an hour. The moment I feel like I'm starting to struggle I pull the plug and leave. I'm pushing 40 so recovery is getting longer these days so I'm very injury conscious.  My advice would see a physio who knows about climbing injuries and get on a path to a clean slate. They should evaluate joint health and muscle imbalances. This could mean something like 6 weeks without climbing doing physio exercises then slowly increasing intensity back to start climbing."
bouldering,39znll,tworksheets,1 point,Tue Jun 16 20:37:50 2015 UTC,"I've re-habbed a lot of climbing related injuries over the last couple years, and so I'll share some things I've learned along the way. Ime most climbers hit a phase like you've described at some point. It's usually caused by a slow build up of bad climbing habits/gaps in technique, muscular imbalances, and/or poor flexibility or motor patterns.   Use this as an opportunity to step back an examine things objectively:   Frequent foot slips could indicated poor footwork. Learn to weight your feet better, pull with your toes where possible, drop your heel on smears to maximize surface contact etc. Upper body injuries (shoulders, wrists, forearms, elbows) could indicate muscular imbalances or poor learned motor patterns. Time to start cross-training, add some regular antagonistic training into the mix, and develop a rehab/prehab program to correct imbalances/motor patterns that you've neglected for too long. Bouldering for too long could indicate that you need to develop a more systematic approach to climbing sessions. Form suffers when you're tired which can lead to injuries. Most training programs I've read suggest that it is better to do short, intense sessions more frequently as opposed to long, infrequent sessions. This is especially true in bouldering since it's so strength/power focused.   As mentioned, Dave MacLeod's websites and books are incredible resources for climbers. I also like Steve Bechtel's (climbstrong.com) and Kris Hampton's (powercompanyclimbing.com) sites for general training advice"
