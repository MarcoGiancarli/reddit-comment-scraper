Roadcam,3e1e2b,Dishevel,3,Tue Jul 21 15:22:36 2015 UTC,Thats unfortunate seeing as the front brake has much more stopping power than the rear
Roadcam,3e1e2b,Antinode_,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:20:27 2015 UTC,"I have no love for the Harley crowd. They know everything. You can not teach them. The guys who run around in large groups on crotch rockets shutting things down so they can do their tricks are just as bad. Only hope we have is that they meet up and take each other out. Real riders know their machines, armor up, and respect other riders and cagers alike."
Roadcam,3e1e2b,Dishevel,7,Tue Jul 21 17:52:26 2015 UTC,Why hasn't anyone put  gyro-controlled ABS brakes on a motorcycle? Hit the brakes and when the gyro senses the bike tipping forwards it modulates the brake to keep you on the ground. No reason why it can't also help with the rear brakes when you skid.
Roadcam,3e1e2b,WhipTheLlama,3,Tue Jul 21 13:29:16 2015 UTC,"As I understand it, there are bikes with both ABS and CBS that will distribute braking across both wheels to generally prevent that kind of stuff. (My next bike will absolutely have ABS)"
Roadcam,3e1e2b,Irrumatus,6,Tue Jul 21 13:57:10 2015 UTC,"I knew about ABS, but CBS is pretty cool as well. Either way, based on the low cost and simplicity of programming you'd think that an actual gyro-based system would be available. It would be trivial to hook one into an ABS system to avoid the rear wheel coming up during front wheel braking. Even an aftermarket system would be easy as long as the ABS system isn't locked down somehow."
Roadcam,3e1e2b,WhipTheLlama,3,Tue Jul 21 14:13:29 2015 UTC,"That exists already. Tons of bikes have wheelie and stopie control. They have accelerometers and tilt sensors and work to keep the wheels on the ground.  My Daytona for instance has 3 modes with abs, on (no rear lift or movement), circuit (allows some rear lift and movement), and off.   Regardless anyone that uses more rear brake than front brake doesn't understand the physics behind a motorcycle. Always use your front brake, in fact I rarely use my rear brake unless I'm below 10 mph.  Also look at the 2015 R1 and 2015 s1000RR if you want to see a few bikes with really cool tech in them. Harley's are a terrible example of what we can do with today's tech."
Roadcam,3e1e2b,tottenham12712,4,Tue Jul 21 15:11:29 2015 UTC,I always attempted to use both brakes at all times. Knowing your brakes is life.
Roadcam,3e1e2b,Dishevel,-1,Tue Jul 21 15:36:08 2015 UTC,"Your rear brake wont do anything when your rear tire is about to come off the ground. Even when you use your rear brake the weight gets shifted to the front tire.   At some point you are applying so little rear brake force that it doesn't make sense to use it. Or you apply to much and now your rear is locked up and making the bike even harder to control under heavy braking.   Learn to use the front brake, its more important."
Roadcam,3e1e2b,tottenham12712,6,Tue Jul 21 15:58:06 2015 UTC,Thank you for pointing this out. I use both brakes. Bu using them both all the time once I have ridden a particular bike for a while easing off the back brake to keep it from locking up under heavy braking becomes natural. Do not depend on the front or the rear. Use both. Get good.
Roadcam,3e1e2b,Dishevel,-3,Tue Jul 21 17:49:34 2015 UTC,"I would recommend a track day, your views on braking will change very quickly. Rear brake is great for control maneuvers (slow turns, slow speeds in traffic, getting the rear to squat a bit our of the corner, slowing down to a traffic light, .etc) but at high rates of speed your focus should be on the front at all times, especially on a supersport or superbike."
Roadcam,3e1e2b,tottenham12712,2,Tue Jul 21 18:26:01 2015 UTC,"Again. If you are not using both brakes almost all the time, when you need it you do not know what you are doing. Rear brake can do real work in the first second of braking hard. Every foot counts. If you are only using your rear coming out of a corner you are not intimately familiar with it. You can skip it. If you want. I on the other hand have always used both in almost all situations. Under very hard braking the rear is smacked and let off to a light touch almost immediately. I have no idea how many inches I save myself in the end. I do know this though. My rear does not lock up unexpectedly. I know what my front and rear brakes are capable of. In the end, crash avoidance may turn to ""Put metal between me and what I am going to hit."" When that happens I can lock that rear instantly and lay my bike down. My toes are already on that brake and it is almost locked up anyway."
Roadcam,3e1e2b,Dishevel,-1,Tue Jul 21 18:48:02 2015 UTC,"""Harley's are a terrible example of what we can do with today's tech.""  Used to be the case, not anymore.  With the Rushmore models they have awesome technology.  That is what brought me over to Harley's, the braking systems on the Rushmore models is amazing."
Roadcam,3e1e2b,FUSE_33,5,Tue Jul 21 15:30:24 2015 UTC,"Still the case. Look at the front brakes on a super sport or a standard and than look at the brakes on the new Harley's. They are tiny in comparison, and HDs weigh 2 times more in some cases.   Ill quote /u/Stridercal on this one:    You'll be on a bike with nearly double the weight and a good foot or more of wheelbase with lazy geometry. The bike won't turn without filling out forms in triplicate to request a direction change.    Now look at the price.... Its a bit ridiculous if you really start to think about it. Honestly, its a really good step for HD but they are FAR off from anything modern."
Roadcam,3e1e2b,tottenham12712,-4,Tue Jul 21 15:53:47 2015 UTC,"It's obvious you have not either researched or ridden the new Rushmore models.  The new Relex braking system with ABS is amazing.  At 25mph I can stop my StreetGlide in ~8 feet.  That is right in line with most modern bikes out there.  Compare this technology with all other brands out there of the same types of bikes and they are right in line now.  I don't think it's fair to compare a cruiser/tourer to a Super Sport.  Two totally different bikes for two totally different applications.  On a Harley you are not going to be stopping over and over again from 160mph to 40mph as hard as you can.    Now standards, the brakes are about the same.  For turning, I can turn much tighter than almost any Super Sport out there.  The length doesn't always equate to turning radius.  This video shows just how well a HD can turn.    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_rQ6pKpFxY&list=PL639B3056A65BA0F0&index=3"

Wait for the braking tests to come out. Every competitor to that bike will out brake it. HD has a lot of work to do.  Than compare that bike to the Ducati Diavel, Triumph Thunderbird Commander, or the Honda Valkyrie. It doesnt make any sense. On the street you need to stop hard once, and those brakes are under powered for that bikes weight."
Roadcam,3e1e2b,tottenham12712,12,Tue Jul 21 16:22:07 2015 UTC,"Absolutely not true, you don't know what your talking about.  I won't outbrake a sport bike, most all other types I'll either be on par or outbrake.  I don't need to wait for the tests to come out, for one the Rushmore models have been out for a couple years now, and two, I've owned one since Feb. 14 leaving a decade of riding the GL1800.  No comparison between the braking."
Roadcam,3e1e2b,FUSE_33,4,Tue Jul 21 16:28:15 2015 UTC,"Stop fanboying for one second:  Yes, the Rushmore braking system is now about as good as anything on the market (feel still sucks, though, with very artificial linking response).  But nearly everything else on the new Rushmore lineup is a joke. The new fork, for example, only serves to screw up the front-to-rear chassis balance. The navigation system is shiny, but responds too damn slow to use while riding. The new saddles and luggage ain't bad, but if you're buying a bike based on new levers to lock down side cases, you've lost the plot a LONGGGGGG time ago.  I've ridden and tested the entire range of Rushmore bikes (no CVOs, though). I will gladly say they are the best Harleys i've ever ridden.  They are still mediocre bikes, at best, however."
Roadcam,3e1e2b,Stridercal,20,Tue Jul 21 16:09:14 2015 UTC,"LOL, you need to get off the HD hate wagon.  It has it's flaws like every bike out there.  I'm not saying by any means they are perfect, they are though, NOT a terrible example of technology.    I absolutely love all bikes, in my 33 years of riding, many years of teaching I've owned and ridden all types of bikes and brands.  Until the Rushmore models I would have agreed with your statement and I actually never considered a HD because of the yesteryears technology.  Now that they are on par with the other brands, I love em' just like I love Honda, BMW, Ducati (dream bike just not practical for me), ect...    I'll take my StreetGlide over a Goldwing any day now.  Mediocre is just not true, at least not the Rushmore models.  I'll agree with the other HD models though...  lol"
Roadcam,3e1e2b,FUSE_33,5,Tue Jul 21 16:23:43 2015 UTC,My Harley had this (12 Vrod) and I loved it. When I went to take the test for getting my motorcycle license I kept stopping short on the brake test due to having good brakes. They didn't know how to score me.
Roadcam,3e1e2b,MouSe05,5,Tue Jul 21 15:06:21 2015 UTC,I know nothing about bikes but I plan on learning to ride at some point- why is it even required by law to have 2 separate brakes?  I can imagine that a badly set up system would be dangerous but for the last 20+ years the technology's been there to safely apply the front brake as well as the back one surely.
Roadcam,3e1e2b,bearjuani,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:56:01 2015 UTC,"The rear brake is rarely used on motorcycles for actual stopping power, when you're on the limit of braking power on a motorcycle usually that means the rear wheel is coming off the ground or only has a few KG of pressure on the tarmac, perfect braking leaves the back tyres hovering instead the rear brake is usually used for stuff like speed adjustment mid corner, anti-wheelie on the straights, low speed maneuvering, ripping sick skids. etc.   There have been bikes with combined braking going back to 1997 with the cbr1100xx blackbird though."
Roadcam,3e1e2b,tekkentool,3,Tue Jul 21 17:26:37 2015 UTC,"Awesome, that makes sense.   Those are some ridiculously grippy tyres in the video btw, if you have that much traction I guess applying the brakes too hard would cause pretty serious problems."

Roadcam,3e1e2b,zAnonymousz,3,Tue Jul 21 06:13:53 2015 UTC,Yes. This rider should not be on the roads with a motorcycle. Slamming on the rear brake will cause you to skid and every rider gets taught this in the motorcycle safety course.
Roadcam,3e1e2b,texanwacko,3,Tue Jul 21 06:29:09 2015 UTC,"Excellent analysis. He over applies the rear brake, and when the skid begins, he panics and drops his feet giving him no rear brake control at all. The brake light appears to stay on, indicating that he's applying the front brake. How much, I don't know because it doesn't seem to slow the bike at all."
Roadcam,3e1e2b,SeymourCorn,2,Tue Jul 21 07:53:58 2015 UTC,My six year old does that when he's going down steep hills on his bicycle.  He's crashed twice that way.  I would hope an adult with a motorcycle license would've figured this out by now.
Roadcam,3e1e2b,MountainDrew42,-6,Tue Jul 21 14:54:02 2015 UTC,"I think it was releasing the rear brake. The biker seemed fine when she was skidding, but when she released the rear brake she lost control."

Roadcam,3e1e2b,FUSE_33,10,Tue Jul 21 15:35:48 2015 UTC,If you release the rear brake while the whiles aren't lined up causes the bike to throw you off. I believe if u lock up the rear like this you need to ride it out (I think)
Roadcam,3e1e2b,PitBullTherapy,-5,Tue Jul 21 13:55:44 2015 UTC,"That's the old way it was taught, lock the rear and keep it locked till your stopped.  Now that's taught as strictly a beginning rider skill.  Once you're no longer a beginner it follows what you said first.  As long as the wheels are in line with each other it's safe to release the rear brake and then reapply correctly, even on surfaces with good traction.

Roadcam,3e1e2b,ottrocity,2,Tue Jul 21 15:25:56 2015 UTC,"""Harleys which can't turn and can't stop""  LOL!!!  Well that is just not true.  In class I would have people say stuff like this.  It's funny, I'll have students in class on the range trying to do the box (2 u-turns within a rectangular box) and would say it's extremely hard or impossible.  Since they were on small Honda Rebels they would say yeah, on this little bike but a normal bike can't do it, blah blah blah.  Then I do the exercise on my HD Streetglide and perform it flawlessly.   Usually it's the rider, not the bike.  Same with stopping, at 25mph I can stop in ~8 feet on the StreetGlide.  The braking system on the newer HD bikes is amazing."
Roadcam,3e1e2b,FUSE_33,2,Tue Jul 21 15:45:00 2015 UTC,Do you only ride your bike at 25mph?  Actual speeds. Road speeds. My car stops from 60mph in 112 feet. The Harley Davidson Electra Glide stops from 60mph in 150 feet. And that's in a straight line. Imagine if you have to brake in an emergency situation around a corner!  I looked for about 10 minutes and couldn't find a single bit of information on a Harley's skid pad or slalom numbers. I did find that  a Harley weighs upwards of 800lbs.
Roadcam,3e1e2b,ottrocity,-1,Tue Jul 21 16:44:07 2015 UTC,"Of course I don't ride at only 25mph.  That's just figure I can give that's a fact from my own experience since the range has the exercise on the ground where I can measure accurately from.  Just an FYI - That link you gave is old, from 2012.  Rushmore bikes came out in 2014, totally different braking technology and they stop much, much faster and safer than before."
Roadcam,3e1e2b,FUSE_33,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:59:17 2015 UTC,"My bad. I meant to link to the 2014 report..  I'm drawing on my own experience with Harley riders, and those exclusively. I've seen a man dump a Harley going around a bend at less than 30mph. I've nearly been rear-ended by a group of 4 Harley riders because a wheel came off a semi and I had to stop hard. I'm also drawing on my knowledge of physics. An 800+lb hunk of metal is not going to stop or be controllable by a single contact patch the size of the palm of my hand. Sure they might be maneuverable at low speeds, but at 45mph? 50? What about a panic stop at 70mph on the freeway? In those situations, I always hear about how it's ""safer"" to just dump the bike and flop down the road, creating an unguided 800+lb chunk of metal traveling at 70mph."
Roadcam,3e1e2b,ottrocity,0,Tue Jul 21 17:58:45 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the link, awesome info in there.  Sounds like you're not a rider.  Drives me nuts those riders that say it's safer to dump it rather than ride it till the end.  Never understood the mentality of purposely crashing the bike to avoid a crash.  If I'm gonna crash, I'm gonna brake as much as I can and scrub off as much speed as possible.  I'm much rather crash into something at 30 while on the bike -vs- 45 sliding on the ground.  A bike above 17-18 mph can maneuver around an obstacle faster than it can brake.  Just to put it on the record, there are shitty riders on every brand of bike.  No type or brand has a drastically different amount of skill over another."

Contrast that to my wife, who got her test in MA, USA in the 80s, and she says she had to set off, do 4 right turns, and pull in again.  Done.

Additional hours might be required if the instructor decides that you're still not good enough to drive on your own. These will include parallel parking, reversing, starting to move in a manual when the car is facing uphill, etc.  First aid, basic car maintenance and some other things are included in the training.  We have that 2-year probation period too. You can't drive faster than 70 km/h on normal roads and 90 km/h on highways. Also, blood alcohol content is 0, you can't have any.   Larger fuck-ups (like serious speeding) will require you to go back to driving school, pay a lot of money, then go to re-take the tests.  And yet we still get plenty of idiots on the roads.

By doing that you're not only passing on the right illegally in some places, but you're eliminating any braking-space or line-of-sight the innocent car on the right had - especially in a big car or truck. Moreover, it sucks when someone ""cuts you off"" and merges in front of you, not to mention it's unsafe when they don't leave enough distance. When someone merges in front of you because there's just ""enough space,"" they are forcing you to become a tailgater and putting you in a potentially dangerous position. As hard as it may be to wait a few more moments to see if they'll move over once there's a safe distance between the lane-hogger and the right-lane car, please try.  That being said, if you're not tailgating them, there's at least 2 seconds of space between the lane-hogger and the right-lane car, and you've waited a few moments for them to move over but they have not, then by all means pass on the right safely."

Roadcam,3dz7sj,Astarlyne,4,Mon Jul 20 18:58:34 2015 UTC,"But his brakes locked up. ABS doesn't make you stop faster, it helps you keeping your car under control when you are applying full brakes."
Roadcam,3dz7sj,kipz0r,-3,Mon Jul 20 20:53:48 2015 UTC,"His brakes didn't lock up, abs doesn't prevent skidding or skid marks. Abs pumps the brakes for you to shorten the distance by incrementally releasing the tires extremely quickly so instead of an uncontrolled slide you maintain direction and keep applying fresh grip."
Roadcam,3dz7sj,TheCastro,6,Mon Jul 20 22:24:45 2015 UTC,"Wrong for the most part, ABS doesn't shorten the stopping distance, at least that's not it's intended purpose, the whole point is to prevent the wheels from locking up so you can keep control of the car, in some cases, braking distance is increased by ABS like on snow.  Source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQdtayz525A"
Roadcam,3dz7sj,NorthernSpectre,-6,Tue Jul 21 01:08:05 2015 UTC,"No I'm right, Myth: ABS may allow you to stop with more control, but it will take you longer to come to a stop.   This myth is generally based on the assumption that a locked-up wheel provides the most traction possible. This isn’t true. A skidding tire has less traction than a tire that is not skidding.   Here’s how ABS works. Speed sensors measure the rotational speed of each wheel. If a wheel risks locking due to intense braking or slick conditions, the ABS unit modulates hydraulic pressure in the braking system. Not only does the system maintain the “sweet spot” of maximum stopping force that occurs before lockup, but by avoiding lock-up, the inertial effect of the spinning wheel is maintained, stabilizing the motorcycle.    http://www.americanmotorcyclist.com/Features/RideReports/AntiLockBraking.aspx    Same principal for cars"

At higher speeds ABS typically reduces stopping distance marginally on dry pavement and significantly on wet pavement.  At low speeds ABS increases stopping distance.  ABS also increases stopping distance significantly on gravel (and also snow in my experience).  Also, it really depends on how well the vehicle implements ABS."

Roadcam,3dz7sj,NorthernSpectre,2,Tue Jul 21 05:49:47 2015 UTC,"Yes they did temporarily, but if you look closely the skid marks end. I highly doubt that person was modulating the brake pedal whatsoever. That's ABS, at least I think so. I could definitely be wrong! Maybe they just regained traction and got lucky. I also figured that ABS was standard on a newer Malibu like that.  Also, ABS does improve stopping distance. It keeps traction and allows the maximum amount of braking power to be applied to each before locking up. When you're skidding your stopping distance is a lot longer. So yes, under normal braking it doesn't make a difference, but it does under emergency braking or low traction conditions. At least that's how I understand it."
Roadcam,3dz7sj,Astarlyne,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:09:32 2015 UTC,"In this case ABS likely would reduce stopping distance.

Roadcam,3dwvo8,davidverner,6,Mon Jul 20 09:34:50 2015 UTC,You even see it in rally driving. I think it's more a result of the impact than panic.
Roadcam,3dwvo8,Dysalot,2,Mon Jul 20 10:57:23 2015 UTC,Hazard lights too. We see a lot of it on this subreddit.
Roadcam,3dwvo8,ign1fy,6,Mon Jul 20 11:16:35 2015 UTC,Hazards are usually programed to come on with newer cars. Wipers is more a result of hands/force hitting the wiper stalk.
Roadcam,3dwvo8,chocalotstarfish,3,Mon Jul 20 12:02:29 2015 UTC,"It's because the wipers in many cars requires the stalk to be pushed up or down, along the natural motion of the wheel. If you make a big,unexpected correction with the steering wheel, and your hands aren't 100% on the wheel correctly, you could hit the stalk turning the wipers on. We see it ALL the time in autocross."

Just yesterday there was a video where someone drove into oncoming traffic and then attempted to lane change to correct their mistake, and ended up hitting the cammer because he/she braked when they realized what was happening.

Roadcam,3duim9,mikeash,3,Sun Jul 19 19:21:36 2015 UTC,I think they expected the other car to try to come across their front instead of further back toward where the cammer actually was.
Roadcam,3duim9,______ayy_lmao______,-6,Sun Jul 19 21:47:40 2015 UTC,I thought the same thing but on second look I think they would have still been hit.  They would have had yo gun it to get past in time which would have added more energy to the still very likely collision.  I think they were expecting the blue car to pill ahead of them and not just ram into their side.  The could have recognized the situation and braked sooner but blue could have still clipped their front.  There's no good way out of this one.  Edit: Maybe if they'd been more decisive in choosing to brake or accelerate?
Roadcam,3duim9,Itchy_plebs,9,Sun Jul 19 22:00:18 2015 UTC,I think her mistake was actually slamming the brakes when the car came back. Had she continued accelerating she wouldn't have been hit.
Roadcam,3duim9,thesavagemonk,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:57:46 2015 UTC,We don't really know where they hit on her car and she had to decelerate anyway for the traffic ahead of her. If they hit the front quarter panel they would have hit her either way.
Roadcam,3duim9,CourseHeroRyan,4,Sun Jul 19 18:24:03 2015 UTC,Yeah I really don't understand why people do that. I see it all the time in parking lots too. Someone is backing out and doesn't see a car driving behind them. The car behind them stops and starts honking. Why not drive fucking past them (while honking) to give yourself the best chance of avoiding the situation?
Roadcam,3duim9,honda27,-1,Sun Jul 19 18:18:31 2015 UTC,Why not stop for someone that's backing out? Its not like they can see through the sides and backs of the cars next to them in order to know if a car is coming.   That's a genuine question.
Roadcam,3duim9,______ayy_lmao______,-16,Sun Jul 19 21:48:55 2015 UTC,"That's obviously fine if there's room for them to back out without hitting you. What I'm talking about is when you're driving through the lot and someone starts backing out when you're directly behind them (ie- there's no way for them to back out without hitting you). Often people will panic I guess, and stop their car directly in the path of that person while honking, thereby increasing the risk of being backed into. Whereas if they had just continued driving past them they would probably make it by before the person ever had a chance to hit them."
Roadcam,3duim9,honda27,17,Sun Jul 19 21:59:21 2015 UTC,That too. Never just slam on your brakes if you think you're going to be hit by something. It's almost like she was asking for it.

I don't know that it actually does anything to stock mass produced consumer engines. :)  The only place I really hear _serious_ talk along these lines of thought is in high performance automotive and motorcycle racing engines.  What difference it makes in soccer mom's new SUV, I haven't a clue. But I'm pretty sure it has less to do with RPM's than it has to do with loading the engine (which occurs throughout the RPM range.)"
Roadcam,3dvdzk,equiraptor,5,Mon Jul 20 07:48:18 2015 UTC,"Loading the engine, both on acceleration and deceleration. And it shouldn't involve bouncing off the rev limiter. You do want to run it through the range, but stay a bit under redline and let it slow by coming off the throttle and staying in gear, instead of braking.  The motors I've had built haven't needed much of this. The rest of the break-in procedure on a street vehicle is basically, ""Vary the revs for the first thousand miles or so"" - so on long freeway drives, change gears regularly so the revs will change."
Roadcam,3dvdzk,MonacoE92,4,Mon Jul 20 15:37:29 2015 UTC,"Look in your car's manual, usually under maintenance there is an area that says how long you should break the engine in and what RPM not to go over ad to vary your RPMs, never let them sit at say 2k RPMs for a 20 min trip on the highway.  Here is my car's break-in, your car might be slightly different but should be similar.  http://i.imgur.com/WKhMkvm.png"
Roadcam,3dvdzk,Meanest_Phlebotomist,-1,Mon Jul 20 08:50:13 2015 UTC,"Nah. Generally speaking, break-in is unimportant for anything except very high performance cars."
Roadcam,3dvdzk,MonacoE92,1 point,Mon Jul 20 11:28:02 2015 UTC,"It's a dude who works on motorcycles that claims (based one one friggin photo of some clean pistons with supposedly tons of miles which can easily be new pistons for all anyone knows) that it is better to drive hard when you buy a new car. Give me a tried and proven laboratory test or at least a side by side comparison of the same engines (one with easy break-in by varying RPMS and keeping it under a certain RPM) and one that is just floored everywhere, and then and ONLY THEN will I consider it a ""well-founded"" school of thought.   Until then, just take the advice of your manual and your manufacturer's engineers and break the car in as it says you should.  Also want to throw it out there that I broke in my engine from 3 miles on the ODO until 1,200 miles and I varied RPMS constantly (no sitting at 2k RPMs while going down the highway) and I have had WAY less oil usage than everyone else that has my model car and drove the car hard. So my own experience is that the pistons seat better when you keep it under a certain RPM and vary them for a certain period (usually around 1200-1500 miles).  Edit: Here is an example of a engineer recommended break-in: http://i.imgur.com/WKhMkvm.png"

After the light changed he got in my lane behind me and continued to record with his cell phone in his hand.  Although he had NJ plates this was in CA where we also have a hands-free law.

Roadcam,3dsms6,BitteGehmaSaufn,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:20:02 2015 UTC,"It's that going a few over doesn't pose much of a hazard, especially on your typical US highway with multiple lanes in each direction. In fact, speed limits are sometimes set extremely low, to the point where traffic is flowing at 20mph faster (e.g. Boston). Going a few over doesn't really inconvenience anyone.  On the other hand, sitting in the left lane is rather rude, because now you're telling the person behind you (who might be in a hurry for a good reason) that they aren't allowed to determine their speed and instead should just suck it up and let you inconvenience them.   90% of the time they probably just don't like the speed limit, but in other cases they may have a loved one in the hospital or be late to an interview or one of various cases of any degree of importance. When you hog the left lane, not only are you creating a more unsafe situation than speeding (unless they're going really fucking fast), but you're also getting in the way of people who have more important things to be worried about than going a few over."
Roadcam,3dsms6,commandar,3,Sun Jul 19 23:22:09 2015 UTC,"Failing to keep to the right is very arguably more dangerous than someone going 10 over. It disrupts the normal flow of traffic, increasing the chance of an accident. Slower traffic is supposed to keep to the right -- regardless of speed limit -- because otherwise faster traffic is forced to constantly change speed or undertake, which increases danger not just to the speeder but everyone else on the road as well."
Roadcam,3dsms6,Not_the_brightest,-5,Sun Jul 19 15:34:46 2015 UTC,"But if everyone was going the speed limit and obeying the law, there would be no need for the fast lane. Is is not the people choosing to break the speed limit who are the cause of the entire issue?"

Roadcam,3dsms6,ItWasntEvenClose,3,Sun Jul 19 17:00:18 2015 UTC,Someone else breaking the law doesn't mitigate you breaking the law. People speed. That's reality.   Riding in the left lane slower than the flow of traffic -- regardless of the speed limit -- is intentionally creating a danger to yourself and other users of the road. The fact that they're breaking the law doesn't make what you're doing any less dangerous for other people. That's also a reality and why it's a dick move.
Roadcam,3dsms6,RBeck,-3,Sun Jul 19 15:49:49 2015 UTC,"Why 9is speeding an accepted reality, and driving in the left lane not?  I'm seriously curious, because I see people hound it when others are in the left lane, citing the law, without a care in the world that they are also breaking a law.  I'm not saying one mitigates the other, I'm just asking why all the ire goes to one side of the argument."
Roadcam,3dsms6,ubernostrum,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:56:54 2015 UTC,"They're both accepted realities and, because of that, riding the left lane is the significantly more dangerous of the two.   It's really not that difficult.  EDIT:  I've driven several thousand miles in the past two weeks. If someone passes me on the left at 10MPH over, no big deal. If some idiot is riding the left lane, they're preventing me from passing legally on the left and I'm having to deal with other cars coming up on me rapidly from behind and/or blowing by me on the right and traffic in general behaves far more erratically than it does normally.   It's dangerous and far more stressful for me through no fault of my own, which is why it catches far more of my ire."
Roadcam,3dsms6,Not_the_brightest,4,Sun Jul 19 16:16:47 2015 UTC,"Not necessarily. For example, some area have different speed limits for semis and cars, e.g. semis are limited to 65 and cars can go 70. Semis could block all lanes of travel with the excuse of ""going the speed limit;"" that's also why some states have failure to yield or impeding traffic laws.  In short, it's not whether or not someone is breaking the speed limit. It's their difference in speeds."
Roadcam,3dsms6,phoenix7782,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:51:26 2015 UTC,"The video is a perfect example.  The officer is allowed to exceed the speed limit in the course of his job, but if he has to pass people on the right like this, it's more dangerous."
Roadcam,3dsms6,Dubzophrenia,-2,Sun Jul 19 18:30:47 2015 UTC,"Your argument is, literally, ""two wrongs make a right"" -- some other person is breaking the speed limit, so you think you should be allowed to break the passing-lane rule. That's not how this works. That's not how any of this works."
Roadcam,3dsms6,specktech,2,Sun Jul 19 23:51:05 2015 UTC,"That is far from my argument.  My argument is, don't call someone out for breaking a law, going so far as to cite the law, when you are also breaking the law.  Not once have I said riding the left lane is okay. I simply asked a question."

Roadcam,3dsms6,Dubzophrenia,15,Sun Jul 19 04:38:07 2015 UTC,"Police cars today come equipped with technology that automatically runs EVERYBODY'S plates.    My brother is an officer.  He drives one of the new Explorers as his patrol car and he took me on a ride-along one day.  His Explorer reads every plate it goes past.  And I mean, EVERY plate.  He took me on the highway, and it read all the plates on his side, and it read all of the plates on the other side, which has a 40 feet grass median between them.    That being said, it doesn't display an entire driver's history, because like you said, probable cause.  I'm in New York, so his car just makes sure that the cars are registered and insured because it's illegal to drive an unregistered and uninsured vehicle.    I got pulled over 2 1/2 months ago because of this.  I bought a new car 3 months ago.  When my father did the insurance information for the new car, someone at the insurance agency screwed up.  I was told I had insurance, but in actuality, I had NO insurance.  Cop ran by me and saw that, and pulled me over.    He was supposed to impound my car and write me a ticket, and the only reason I got away was because I had my insurance card for what the insurance was SUPPOSED to be, and we fixed that immediately."

I'm fine with it just checking registration, but I have seen some articles about them keeping details about where and when they scan plates, thus building a record of your habits and such.. Not sure how true that is.  I'd guess the justification behind checking the registration, is that it would do the exact same thing an officer would. He sees an expired tag, then runs the plate. This just does it automatically."

Roadcam,3dsms6,khaeen,1 point,Sun Jul 19 07:04:25 2015 UTC,"What does ""pc"" mean? Anyway I saw a video of a cop car driving through a parking lot and it ran every plate it drove by to see if it was stolen or whatever. I dunno if that falls into anything."
Roadcam,3dsms6,phoenix7782,2,Sun Jul 19 04:40:31 2015 UTC,"It's an ALPR scanning system.  All cops cars today have them now.    How much information can be taken from them varies by state though.  Here in NY, it scans for expired registration, expired insurance, whether the car was reported in an amber alert, whether the vehicle is stolen, and that it could contain a ""person of interest"".  Some states have it paired with the DMV database, so it can also detect if the driver has a warrant for their arrest, a suspended driver's license, or outstanding taxes or fines.  These ones are iffy though, because that person may not necessarily be operating the vehicle all the time.    This system has some errors though.  It can be totally wrong and you can get wrongfully pulled over based on a computer error.  If it cannot detect a letter in your license plate because it came out blurry or it's distorted, the system scans for the other letters in that combo and the same vehicle description and just makes a guess, which may or may not be your vehicle."

Roadcam,3dsms6,phoenix7782,2,Sun Jul 19 04:43:47 2015 UTC,"No, you don't need probable cause to run license plates. Cops can and do run plates all day long. There's even equipment that does this automatically to every car that drives past which has started to become common."
Roadcam,3dsms6,CourseHeroRyan,1 point,Sun Jul 19 04:51:06 2015 UTC,Driving is not a right. You don't need probable cause for anything short of an arrest when you are on the road. Even a vehicle search doesn't need probable cause since vehicles are considered highly mobile and so the only risk of suspects leaving jurisdiction outweighs any rights.
Roadcam,3dsms6,immoralatheist,-1,Sun Jul 19 14:06:17 2015 UTC,"That's definitely not right... Police need probable cause or your consent before they search your car. Cars are special though, in that police don't need a warrant from the court.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motor_vehicle_exception"
Roadcam,3dsms6,JohnApples1988,1 point,Sun Jul 19 14:18:36 2015 UTC,"Criminal justice is one of my areas of study, probable cause is far from what is actually needed if a cop wants to search your car. All a cop has to do is state that he had reason to suspect a weapon in the car and you would be pulled out while he looked through for a weapon. Anything found in that search is admissible evidence by plain view doctrine. Reasonable suspicion is all that's needed for a detainment and a search for weapons is completely allowable due to the need to secure officer safety."

Not a big deal for me, but I would have been pretty annoyed if my GF was driving my car and she got pulled over for that.

There's some fuckstick in the left lane who decided to match the traffic speed then click their cruise control up to 3 kph over the prevailing speed in order to execute a pass over the course of about 20 km.

When it came to insurance, their insurance agent met with me and got my account and got a copy of the police report and them figured out the fault (which was 100% mine in actuality) and then settled with the other party.  That was my only experience with the police and insurance claims but i'm assuming that typically police are the ones who assign the fault and then let the insurance companies fight it out as far as who compensates who.

The thing that causes the most wrecks is the lack of visibility. So many cars kicking up a fine mist, that even in a moderate rain storm, you can't see 200 ft. ahead of you.  P.S.A. Your headlights aren't just so you can see, THEY LET YOU BE SEEN BETTER AS WELL. Please turn on your lights in a storm it helps everybody."
Roadcam,3dsi9h,Lutheus13,4,Sun Jul 19 11:22:10 2015 UTC,"Plus, roads that don't receive regular rainfall accumulate more dried oil and rubber. Once it finally rains the roads become very slick until it's washed off."

I would assume, though, that they would be a lot different taking into account the differences in weather.   I know in Nor Cal, the dots and reflectors are not placed directly on top of the road, and I am sure they aren't anywhere that receives snow. They are placed in divots so they don't get scraped up by snowplows.   You have poor weather all the time so of course you learn.   Is parallel parking still a part of your current driving test? It was taken out of the driving portion in California years ago. I think it is way too easy to get a driver's license.   It isn't that people don't learn, it is that they are never taught or even required to know in the first place.  I would like a licensing process closer to Finland's. Not quite as demanding though.  I like to ask my younger relatives this simple question, ""Can you be pulled over by the police for speeding while going the posted speed limit?""

Roadcam,3drqt4,wheresmyhouse,7,Sun Jul 19 00:02:10 2015 UTC,Before getting your licence you have to drive with a certified instructor in a specially prepared car (like the one seen here). They are normal cars but with an additional set of pedals and some extra mirrors. After you've finished that and got some theory lessons you can try to pass the exam. After you've passed you get a full licence with no special restrictions (except that for a year or so you are punished harsher for offences).
Roadcam,3drqt4,gollito,4,Sun Jul 19 00:05:05 2015 UTC,"The L cars are only used by driving schools. They have an extra brake and clutch on the instructor's side, along with 2 or 3 extra mirrors for the instructor. You can't drive alone in them as a student driver."

Had my permit for 6 months, and then scheduled my road test to get my license.    Day came around, I took that test in my own vehicle as well, and passed.    I have only ever driven my own vehicles, never had training.  Just my dad drilling everything into my head as I went.  This is in New York however, so other states may be different.

Roadcam,3driuf,Mitch_from_Boston,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:56:22 2015 UTC,You are so right. I can even picture it now. Song cuts in and video starts showing random snips of traffic with the music playing in the background before slowly zooming into the vehicle the star of the movie is in.
