Trophies,3e4vwz,tetrishero,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:49:53 2015 UTC,"Just got this one, too. Exceptionally easy plat if you have a Vita to boost with."
Trophies,3e50lf,Micho86,2,Wed Jul 22 00:27:56 2015 UTC,"FYI ""Far, Far Away..."" unlocked after 44 Km for me."
Trophies,3e3oed,wuvius,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:37:23 2015 UTC,How hard is the plat?
Trophies,3e3oed,LouisvilleXV,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:01:26 2015 UTC,"The single player is very easy, takes 2 playthroughs though. Multiplayer is only quick if you boost it, otherwise it might add another 15-20 hours onto your play time"
Trophies,3e3oed,BrownKiidd,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:23:57 2015 UTC,Have the game but not platnum yet.  It's not hard at all. The only trophy that's going to take a while is menz in the hood.  This requires you to get a cumulative kill count of 20 with a Mac 10 and 20 kills with a double barrel shotgun. The reason this trophy is annoying is because there's a lot of stuff you have to complete to unlock both of these guns for online.  Other than that the rest are campaign trophies. There's also 2 other online trophies but those are easy
Trophies,3e3oed,Teves3D,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:24:49 2015 UTC,Medium. (7/10 difficulty)   Majority of the difficulty is the multiplayer trophies.
Trophies,3e3oed,EliteGamers27,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:53:30 2015 UTC,Nice! And yeah I feel bad for the completionists that bought this game not knowing what was ahead of them x)
Trophies,3e3oed,hardangelfan,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:35:08 2015 UTC,"Fuck those DLC trophies. Last I heard devs were going to change that, but too little to late. I'm not wasting 49.99 on premium. They screwed up."
Trophies,3e3m1c,Mattskie,2,Tue Jul 21 18:21:04 2015 UTC,"Well done. I recently got the plat for Arkham knight and it's put me in the mood to take a crack at the rest of the series, however I remember those challenge maps being crazy difficult and I honestly don't think I'll be able to get all those damn medals."
Trophies,3e3m1c,VagMangler,2,Tue Jul 21 19:30:38 2015 UTC,"Learn to abuse the system, if you can beat Shock and Awe (Extreme) you're golden.  That single challenge made me almost break a controller."
Trophies,3e4rns,GerahX,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:15:27 2015 UTC,"Nice, I'm so close to getting the platinum for this but the raiding party trophy won't activate for me."
Trophies,3e4rns,Grimaldus,1 point,Wed Jul 22 04:08:52 2015 UTC,Isn't it raiding clan?
Trophies,3e2ttl,StaticzAvenger,2,Tue Jul 21 15:04:35 2015 UTC,One of my favorite games! Congrats
Trophies,3e2ttl,wuvius,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:34:44 2015 UTC,Not bad! Again in October on ps4? :p
Trophies,3e2ttl,tvpro,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:43:49 2015 UTC,Hopefully! The hardest trophy to get were the two online trophies lol. Took me 4 hours to find a co-op game online.
Trophies,3e2ttl,tvpro,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:28:25 2015 UTC,"Back then I stopped trying to get this platinum, I couldn't finish the boss in crushing iirc, and I don't like online trophies, so I gave up. But I'm going to try again on ps4. :)"
Trophies,3e338c,ZACK-O,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:13:07 2015 UTC,"Congrats!    I'm on the hate side right now.  Played for probably 5 hours, have only beaten the Cleric Beast."
Trophies,3e338c,silverblackgold,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:05:37 2015 UTC,"I'd say there's bound to be a sequel, or at the very least a successor. Maybe From will do the same thing it did last gen and release a mechanically identical spiritual successor (possibly called Stillborne) but on Xbox One and PC as well this time."
Trophies,3e3vhj,Danimaltanimal,3,Tue Jul 21 19:25:34 2015 UTC,"Hahaha hilarious, well done"
Trophies,3e3vhj,wuvius,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:31:26 2015 UTC,I'm not allowed near power tools anymore :/  Guess i'll just have to do it the old fashioned way.
Trophies,3e2eho,KarmaKhamelion,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:54:34 2015 UTC,Driving. How long?
Trophies,3e2eho,Domenicoh,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:53:20 2015 UTC,"72km, stuck with OEM wheels from the start"
Trophies,3e2eho,Domenicoh,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:54:10 2015 UTC,"Dang. I think I used sweet tooths wheels, that's why I ain't getting any progress on it. Shit."
Trophies,3e2eho,Domenicoh,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:07:29 2015 UTC,You could always rubber band the controller
Trophies,3e2eho,Domenicoh,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:47:51 2015 UTC,"I tried for a bit. I'm up to 33km on one set of wheels but have not seen the ""Domi-Origato has drove 100km!"" notification yet. So I think I might not be glitched :/"
Trophies,3e1iyu,iSuperfusionzx,2,Tue Jul 21 06:15:19 2015 UTC,"Nice, working on this one myself."
Trophies,3e1iyu,Gecoma,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:39:30 2015 UTC,"It's a nice little game although it was quite frustrating for me because there were a few missable trophies that i missed completely and had to reload twice from the beginning of the game and once from the beginning of year 2 and the tank controls were also a pain in the butt :P i think if i replayed it focusing more on playing the game and less on trophies, without tank controls, i would probably enjoy it a little more."
Trophies,3e1iyu,user0verkiller,3,Tue Jul 21 07:49:25 2015 UTC,"I found the tank controls better than the camera-oriented one since I could push foward without having the camera spazzing back & forth.  On the other hand, I found some of the trophies very difficult, i.e. Oh, Rusty Anchor, & ME! ME! ME! Still I love this game, I played it on the Vita first & then on the PS4 on different accounts."
Trophies,3e1iyu,HowieGaming,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:03:28 2015 UTC,"Wow, the platinum can't be hard when over 30% has the throphy."
Trophies,3e0sev,ZACK-O,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:03:59 2015 UTC,"9TH?? GoW 1, 2, 3, Ascension, CoO, GoS, 3 HD... Do Vita versions have separate trophy lists? If so, I gotta get my hands on a Vita."
Trophies,3e0sev,bajster,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:19:32 2015 UTC,"they do have separate lists, but they are the exact same as GOW 1 & 2 on PS3."
Trophies,3e0sev,Pnut41,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:33:34 2015 UTC,"also... if you have a PS TV, you can play with a dualshock controller. more comfortable than the vita in my opinion."
Trophies,3e0sev,Pnut41,2,Tue Jul 21 13:34:29 2015 UTC,"I've been waiting for PS TV to drop to a reasonable price and its finally at $40. I might dive on this soon, unless I can find a decently priced Vita. I've just been on the fence about Sony's handheld because I was a day one buyer with the PSP and the 3DS, and both of those had shit lineups for the longest time early in their timeline. The Vita has a solid handful of games I'd love to play, but I still can't justify that $150-200 price tag I see everywhere."
Trophies,3e0sev,bajster,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:19:47 2015 UTC,Yes the Vita versions have separate trophy lists. They were a little buggy though. I had to do the challenge of the gods twice because the trophy didn't pop. You should pick up a vita! Great system.
Trophies,3e0sev,theblackfool,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:10:11 2015 UTC,"Nice! I'm only at 4. I have the original 1, 2, and 3, and Chains. Got a little burnt out, but all I'm missing is the challenges for 1 and 2 on the Vita. This is quite the dedication to the series though!"
Trophies,3e0sev,HowieGaming,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:39:13 2015 UTC,Nice! I've only got 1 from God of War. And that's 3. On the PS3
Trophies,3e0wdn,EllieFromTheLastOfUs,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:36:56 2015 UTC,Any tips? I am currently working through this as Salvadoor seeing as he has the most annoying of the character specific trophies.
Trophies,3e0wdn,Mattskie,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:43:11 2015 UTC,"The Challenge-accepted trophy glitched on me, so it's good to get that one early."
Trophies,3e0wdn,InappropriateHandle,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:16:50 2015 UTC,Well... Crap. Guess I should stop and grind out the shotgun kills.
Trophies,3e0wdn,InappropriateHandle,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:42:13 2015 UTC,"Third playthrough is when they glitch, I don't know where you are but you might have some time."
Trophies,3e0wdn,InappropriateHandle,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:06:58 2015 UTC,Oh. Yeah. No. I'm trying to get the platinum well before then... I'm only going as far into TVHM as I need to get to 50.
Trophies,3dyxu8,Courier_7,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:45:57 2015 UTC,Congrats! That Knights trophy is no fun huh?
Trophies,3dyxu8,SoManyCookies,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:55:11 2015 UTC,Yeah the fact that they didn't differentiate the basic and cursed versions of Artorias's sword made it so much better. Forced me to delete my save and wait 24 hrs for the cloud to redownload it
Trophies,3dyhlj,FUCKINGoctopi,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:52:24 2015 UTC,I look forward to working on this one after I'm done with BF Hardline and Rocket League!  How did you like it? Played the other ones?
Trophies,3dyhlj,wuvius,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:56:44 2015 UTC,"I had a Xbox 360 before getting the PS4 so I didn't get a chance to play the other Infamous games. When First Light was free for ps+ plus I got interested in the series and decided to get Second Son. Pretty fun game, although it was rather short. It only took me ~15 hours to get the plat."
