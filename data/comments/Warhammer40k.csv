Warhammer40k,3e37lm,MooseRoom,15,Tue Jul 21 16:43:52 2015 UTC,"You've got to read the first 3 atleast just to get the full Luna Wolves trilogy out of the way, imo. My top 3 Black Library authors are Abnett, McNeill, and Aaron Dembski-Bowden. I think Abnett writes the best combat, McNeill the best grimdark and ADB, a nice mix of both despite being one of the newer writers."
Warhammer40k,3e37lm,Corpsemprah,3,Tue Jul 21 17:39:05 2015 UTC,"Abnett has a way of writing good atmosphere. Geno 5-2 chilead, gaunts ghosts, wolves prospero burns - all of it awesome stuff.  McNeill's Magnus is very tragic and interesting too. He made the thousand sons the deepest chapter, IMO."
Warhammer40k,3e37lm,FunInStalingrad,6,Tue Jul 21 20:19:17 2015 UTC,"I think you should seriously consider reading the next two books. Graham makes up one of the corners of the holy trinity of Black Library writers together with Abnett and Sandy Mitchell. So yes, keep on reading!"
Warhammer40k,3e37lm,Brokensharted,5,Tue Jul 21 17:36:30 2015 UTC,"Aaron Dembski-Bowden is by far my most favorite autor. Check out the NightLords Trilogy if you are interested in Chaos Space Marines and you know whats good writing.  edit: ofc everyone of the horus heresy books i kinda ""high quality"" and i liked alot of them .. only ""Mechanicus"" wasnt really my thing."
Warhammer40k,3e37lm,Bananenbaum,4,Tue Jul 21 20:39:00 2015 UTC,Graham McNeill is the other author for the series that I put on the same level as Abnett.  The other writers vary and are mostly in the ok to good range.  You should absolutely read the first 3 books together and in order. After that order matters a little less but I would still recommend reading the series in order as it is relatively chronological.
Warhammer40k,3e37lm,Waylander0719,2,Tue Jul 21 18:01:15 2015 UTC,"Yeah, after Flight of the Eisenstein, it seems to jump around a fair bit. Like, The First Heretic is the fourteenth in the series, but is arguably the first chronologically speaking"
Warhammer40k,3e37lm,Anghellik,3,Tue Jul 21 21:22:18 2015 UTC,"The HH novels up to Fulgrim are great.  Then they become hit or miss till you get to Lorgar's story.  First Heretic, and the other one (name escapes me) are excellent."

Warhammer40k,3e37lm,BrooksConrad,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:07:07 2015 UTC,That's it. Ty.
Warhammer40k,3e37lm,Failedmysanityroll,3,Tue Jul 21 21:12:20 2015 UTC,"Like everyone else said, read the first trilogy, then if you're interested go right on to Flight of the Eisenstein and Fulgrim. After that, order gets kind of messy, but there are sort of ""mini-series"" of books sprinkled throughout the list that follow a fairly consistent plot-line.  Thousand Sons and Prospero Burns are companion novels   First heretic, Know No Fear, Betrayer, Fear to Tread, Vulkan Lives, and Unremembered Empire should be read in that order.  Angel Exterminatus is a sort of sequel to Fulgrim but you don't have to read it immediately after Fulgrim  Some other stand-alone novels are Legion (also by Dan Abnett), Mechanicum, Deliverance Lost, Scars, and Outcast Dead. These can be read anywhere in between the others I listed above."
Warhammer40k,3e37lm,NuclearChickadee,2,Tue Jul 21 20:23:18 2015 UTC,"It's been years since I've read it, but yes keep reading! The initial trilogy is excellent."
Warhammer40k,3e37lm,Dollburger,2,Tue Jul 21 17:34:27 2015 UTC,"Abnett tops the charts over any other writer BL has.  McNeill/Counter are both good too, just not as polished IMO.  There's a reason Dan is so prolific with books/comics/games/movies.    Best book(s) in the entire 40K library, the Eisenhorn omnibus by Dan Abnett.  Find it if you can."
Warhammer40k,3e37lm,forcemarine,2,Tue Jul 21 19:39:38 2015 UTC,I think that Ravenor is a little better than Eisenhorn. Abnett is pretty amazing.
Warhammer40k,3e37lm,mors_videt,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:20:51 2015 UTC,"I loved Ravenor too, probably count it in Dan's top 5.  I think he was going for two different things with their respective books.  Both were pretty detectivey-style novels but I got more of high-adventure feel from Eisenhorn versus dirty cyberpunk from Ravenor.    I probably like E better since he trained Ravenor in the first place.  Gonna have to reread them yet again!"
Warhammer40k,3e37lm,forcemarine,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:53:01 2015 UTC,"The whole series is rather good, and provides a lot of background.  Of course, some of the novels aren't as good as others, but that is just the way of life."
Warhammer40k,3e37lm,maniclurker,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:20:16 2015 UTC,"The first trilogy is amazing. For science fiction, especially 40k the quality of the writing and the progression of the story blew me away. You know the inevitable outcome of the books, Horus falling and the Legions being purged, but you turn each page desperately hoping for salvation. The climax of the trilogy is great; well worth reading though the books for."
Warhammer40k,3e37lm,sgtpepper_spray,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:45:23 2015 UTC,"Yeah like everyone else has been saying, The opening 3 books to the Horus Heresy are outstanding."
Warhammer40k,3e37lm,Squantz,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:16:25 2015 UTC,"Well, McNeill wrote my favourite book in the series that I've read so far (A Thousand Sons) It made me love the story of the Thousand Sons and also made me really hate the Space Wolves, even though I thought they were pretty cool before. So I'd say he's quite good."

Warhammer40k,3e37lm,CobaltBartimaeus,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:11:09 2015 UTC,"The first 5 books are must-reads, if you ask me. Horus Rising, False Gods, Galaxy in Flames, Flight Of The Eisenstein, and Fulgrim. My copy of Eisenstein has pages falling out of it, I've re-read it so much.  The 5 together make up probably the definitive chronicle of the Istvaan V Betrayal and the Dropsite Massacre, outlining the key players and how they got to the blasted sands of Istvaan in the first place.  Characters you've met, like the Mournival (Oho, the Mournival. Dude.), Saul Tarvitz, Euphrati Keeler, and of course the Primarchs, get some magnificent development over the course of the first five books, and new characters like Nathaniel Garro and Solomon Demeter make their presence felt; I'd go so far as to say that some of the Marines who feature in Galaxy and Eisenstein are among the absolute best of the best, the ultimate in Astartes ideals and devotion. They're everything the Great Crusade stood for. The closing scenes in Galaxy get me all emotional.  I'd highly recommend reading at least to the end of Fulgrim and seeing what you think after that. The later books in the series have some great moments, and some very sketchy bits too - A few of the more recent ones have actually been a bit disappointing, unfortunately, but they have their places. I'd recommend more of Abnett's and McNeil's entries in the series - Prospero Burns and A Thousand Sons are fantastic, in particular.  Happy reading to you!"

Felt like they need to stand out from the grey hunters / Bloodclaws so i went with the sternguard models and gave them SW heads and backpacks. Some of the iconography doesnt really fit the SW theme but i still think they look better than the normal wolf pack models.  Did not spend the same amount of time i did on Krom, but i guess its still on a decent level. Also thanks to /u/Retrorevival for the tip to mix PVA glue with the snow powder. Really made it look way better! The point with the first picture was to show that he is magnetized but i didnt have any other hands to equip so kinda defeats the purpose.

Warhammer40k,3e3xjq,poopshark2,3,Tue Jul 21 19:39:08 2015 UTC,Yes. You can attach IC's to any unit and an unattached IC is a unit by itself.
Warhammer40k,3e3xjq,Ze_German_Guy,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:45:19 2015 UTC,"It's actually worded ""a unit"" in the rulebook, so you could join an enemy unit. This is obviously silly and not intended, but it's funny because nobody could prove you couldn't."

Warhammer40k,3e45yo,nicegirl_13,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:37:33 2015 UTC,"So you can have an allied detachment, following the allied detachment in the rule book.  It doesn't, however, have to be an allied detachment.  It can be any type of formation (Skyhammer, Firebase Cadre, RW Attack Squadron, etc) and it can be included with your main detachment.  The way that they interact is dictated by the allies matrix in the BRB.    Any of those formations is still ""battleforged"", but you won't have the bonuses from CAD; you will have the bonuses from the Formations instead.  You can't, though, include the same unit in two separate formations.  A troop choice, for example, can only be a part of your CAD or your formation; it cannot be a part of both.  On that note, it's a bit difficult keeping track of ""who is in what"" if everyone is painted with the same colors and have the same load outs.  So keep that in mind from a modeling perspective when mixing and matching formations / detachments."
Warhammer40k,3e45yo,_hei,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:53:33 2015 UTC,"When you are making a battle forged army you need to have at least one detachment. Formations are a type of detachment so your army could be just a single formation if you'd like.   When can you have more then one detachment? All the time and any time so long as you meet all the requirements for each detachment and don't go over your points limit and no model is being used in more then one detachment.  Your main force, or in game terms primary detachment, is the one your warlord is in. If you want the Harlequins to be your main force pick a Harlequins character to be your warlord. If you wan to use them as an attachment then pick any other character to be your warlord."
Warhammer40k,3e45yo,DJGietzen,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:10:42 2015 UTC,"If you are running an unbound list taking allies is extremely easy: Simply take whatever units form whatever codex you want.   Battleforged is only marginally more difficult: Everything needs to be in detachments (duh) and each detachment can have units from only one codex. That is really the only restriction in place from the BRB (tournaments tend to restrict it more, ask a TO) Note that you do not need to use the Allied Detachment found in the BRB, you can use any combination of detachments you want (unless otherwise noted in the rules)  Once the game starts there are some limitations you need to be aware off that tell you how the models interact. Check the BRB allies matrix for those."

Warhammer40k,3e2n7q,Semajal,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:16:44 2015 UTC,The only problem I encountered is that the washers cannot fit into slottabases because slottabases have a protrusion running through the middle where the slot is for the miniature's feet.   I carved out the slot base slot for some of mine when I did this.   I also get magnets at the office supply store that have a sticker on one side and stick them to a plastic bin to create a magnetic carrying system. It works very nicely since the washers hold on very tightly.

If you don't want to go through that, I imagine using some kind of filler like cheapish modelling putty would be effective, too.

Warhammer40k,3e2xjs,IVIilitarus,2,Tue Jul 21 16:34:26 2015 UTC,"Here is what I did for my figs.  I bought some cheap plastic bins and some refrigerator magnets that had a sticky side. These were meant for people to print up business card like things on a magnet to hand out. Instead I stuck them on the plastic bins.   the magnets I bought are these:   http://www.officedepot.com/a/products/673670/ProMAG-Adhesive-Business-Card-Magnets-Pack/;jsessionid=0000td5IwoRk8WTo4ZBF2DqIBz5:17h4h7ado  Then instead of gluing the magnets to the bases of the models, I glued (using super glue, not model glue!!!!) inexpensive washers to the base.   For bases that have stuff on bottom, like slots, or round pegs, I had to carve those out.   The metal washers are great for balancing the figures and will hold most figures to the magnets pretty securely. A good shake will loosen some of them from the magnet, but short of that you can secure them pretty nicely."
Warhammer40k,3e2xjs,Historyguy81,3,Tue Jul 21 16:53:38 2015 UTC,"Posted this before, will post again: https://i.imgur.com/wFCXulj.jpg  The magnets are 1/3 x 1/16 rare earth magnets (iirc). Each of those boxes is a $20 metal toolbox that I found online (it's thin so the boxes aren't heavy at all). My infantry models and my oval base MCs all have 1 or more rare earth magnets superglued to the bottom. My circle base MCs are on magnet bases I bought from GF9. Carnifex and Flyrant arms are magnetized and I stick the arms to the top of the appropriate box. The gaunts also stick to the ceiling (I usually bring 30 of each type so I can run lists with either). The magnets are strong so absolutely nothing shifts around even when I'm driving.  Anything that doesn't fit in those boxes (my Hive Crone and flyer base) goes in my Tyrannofex box which I put in a bag with the rest of my stuff."

I was actually under the impression that daemons and nids also don't have that restriction, but never had a reason to look it up myself. In any case, while I can see the RAI argument, RAW looks pretty clear that you can use it the turn they arrive since it doesn't say you can't.   ""No abilities/special rules that must be used at the start of the turn"" doesn't factor into it since homing beacons work at all times, not just the start of the turn (though most commonly used for deepstriking at the start of the movement phase they would also work for deepstriking via allied psykers)"

Warhammer40k,3e4g6h,Mcshade,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:57:53 2015 UTC,The way I modded one of mine is by having the side of the gun (which is pretty flat) on the side of the backpack. It does fit pretty well. If you're using a carbine and not a pulse rifle put it on the small of his back (or the backpack side thing as above). Does that help?

Warhammer40k,3e4dai,b43rCh1,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:36:35 2015 UTC,"I'd say Be'lakor and a KoS is way too much to spend on HQ in such a small point game.  As someone else suggested you can get some Heralds for much cheaper and they are pretty durable if you stick them in a big squad of Daemonettes.   Also for a Soul Grinder giving it the Baleful Torrent or Phlegm Bombardment would give you some much needed shooting output.  As you get to higher points an allied detachment of CSM with Noise Marines and a Heldrake would be sweet.  You can just stick Be'lakor with them to take the HQ slot.  You'll just need a squad of cultists for the troop tax, and they can be useful to hide or and cap objectives."

Grey Knights slaying daemons.     For the more helpful bit: Grey Knights are restricted by the fact that they are very expensive. An 1850 list can have ~20 guys in it. Additionally, they are still Space Marines. AP 3 will kill the teleporting troops, while AP 2 will wreck everything else. You can circumvent their Force weapons by running lots of 1 wound models. Some combination of these tips should balance it out.   But you'll still be at a huge disadvantage, seeing as GK all have rerolls vs daemons, powers that negatively affect daemons, and daemonbane on most of their weapons."

You would take a force from the Chaos Space Marine Codex (Marines, Daemon-Engines), and a force from either the Skitarri or Cult Mechanicus books (or both). Your Chaos force would probably be a CAD, meaning minimum one Lord/Sorcerer and 2 squads of Chaos Marines, plus a formation from one or both of the Mechanicus books (I don't own them so I can't say what they entail).  Or you could field an Unbound force, which means you can field anything you want from any of the 3 codices, but don't get any bonuses from it."

Warhammer40k,3e3dgz,Knallogfall,2,Tue Jul 21 17:40:18 2015 UTC,"The described army is fully possible within the limitations of Codex: Chaos Space Marines. You could bring something like a Warpsmith, whose backstory could involve a connection to the Dark Mechanicus, and a couple mixed squads of Chaos Space Marines. You could fill out the rest with things like Helbrutes, Heldrakes, Forgefiends/Maulerfiends, and even a Defiler if you'd feel so inclined.  It would be a mediocre army at best, especially without transport vehicles for the Chaos Space Marines, but it would still be playable and have a reasonable amount of tough units.  Also, food for thought, but it's easier to gather Cultists than gain favors from the Dark Mechanicus. Additionally, having mighty hellforged machines stomping about is a good way to 'inspire' a few disgruntled citizens to join your cause. Finally, slaves are a currency as well, both to work factories or as frontline fodder. There's nothing wrong with having a block of desperate madmen to give you more cheap feet on the ground, especially when your Chaos Space Marines are limited in number (due to cost) and mobility (lack of vehicles)."

There are rumors that the next forgeworld book with be a mechanicus book (both light and dark) to bring the HH stuff into 40k.  In the meantime, you can play ""counts as"" with the current Ad Mech books or my recommendation would be get yourself an Imperial Armour 13.

Warhammer40k,3e3dgz,Daevram,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:45:10 2015 UTC,If you want a cheap start you can go on eBay and usually find the chaos half of the Dark Vengeance set for about $40.  That will give you your chaos base and extra bits to bash with your mechanicum to make them more twisted.  You'll still have to lay out a bit of dough for those but you'll still have a cheap Seed.  If you go full out and buy the whole DV set you can turn the DA side into standard chaos and gain some terminators and chaos bikes as well to use or bash with mechanicum later on.
Warhammer40k,3e3dgz,DJGietzen,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:08:49 2015 UTC,"What you've described is possible, but not straight forward. The game is currently based on factions. Any and all factions can be put in the same army and will interact with other factions in the army in 1 or 4 ways. These can range from battle brothers (BB) to come the apocalypse(CtA). Battle brother is what you want. When two factions treat each other a s BB the fact that they are different factions is almost meaningless. CtA however can makes things a chore to play.   As you can imagine, the space marines and the the rest of the imperium get all just great together, they are all BB but they are all CtA with anything related to chaos.  There are two adapatus mechanicus factions (Cult and Skitarii) out right now, but zero dark mechanicum factions.  So here are your options.  1) Play with the Chaos Space Marine Faction and the Skitarri and/or Cult factions with out any house rules. This is legal and possible but the Come the Apocalypse relationship might ruin your fun.  2) Play with the Chaos Space Marine Faction and the Skitarri and/or Cult factions with house rule for the Skitarri and/or Cult factions to use the same relationship interactions as choas marines. This is the ideal solution, and outside of a tournament you should not see much resistance from players but talk to your potential opponents before you commit.   3) Use the space marines, or blood angels, or dark angels, or space wolves codex to provide rules for your ""chaos marine units"" (I actually think the space wolves codex will have the best fit). What I mean by this is technically you will be playing an imperial army but you can make it look as chaos like as you want. This makes sense with the lore you've chosen as the chaos gods have essentially abandoned them but you will have to be creative to have daemon engines.

It's a sorry state of affairs when the followers of Chaos start to defend the weakling Imperium from each other!""  ""Um, Lord... the Flesh Tearers are a loyalist chapter.""  ""They are? With a name like that! Are you sure they're not one of ours?""  ""Positive, My Lord.""  ""Have you been able to call for any assistance?""  ""The Astropaths have contacted other forces nearby. Unfortunately this has also alerted other loyalist forces in the sector and they are also headed our way.""  ""Bugger. So who gets here first then?""  ""The Alpha Legion, sire.""

You sure they aren't one of ours?""  ""Quite sure. Then there's the Blood Drinkers and the Flesh Tearers - both of which are Loyalist second founding of the Blood Angels.""

""They used to be missionaries sire""  ""We you'd think that once they switched to our side they'd change their name to something a little more in keeping with being evil mad men. I mean come on 'The Word Bearers'? It's a silly name.""  ""Yes my Lord""  ""You know, I think the forces of Chaos should have proper Chaos names. There's no room for mistakes when you're called something like 'The World Eaters' or 'The Death Guard'...""  ""Actually Lord, both those chapters had those names when they were loyalists.""

They probably have some successor chapters with different colour schemes, so it isn't a huge problem.  The benefit of having IWND on vehicles/walkers is pretty big, it puts pressure on the opponent to focus each one down hard.  Alternatively, throw a few dreds in drop pods with flamers and meltas as you've got yourself a scary salamanders list.  Drednaughts got buffed in the most recent codex, increasing base attacks. Since the blood angels have a separate codex they did not get these buffs, they do have a few cool dreds though; the librarian and furiosa."

Warhammer40k,3e1gaa,hunterkj60,7,Tue Jul 21 05:44:43 2015 UTC,"Good job, mate. Just some simple fixes to get it to table-top quality in no time :)  First off, you've used quite a pinky-coloured red for the boltgun casing, eyes, and other insignia. Is this intentional? If so, cool. If otherwise, I would recommend using some kind of strong red like Mephiston Red instead.  Next get back in there and carefully neaten up any overlap. Where the eyes meet to helmet you've got a bit of pink on where the green should be. Same goes for the right shoulder pauldron and the tactical insignia - just use some green and carefully go over where the pink has encroached onto the green.  Thirdly, try out some highlighting. Take whatever base colour you've used (green for example) and add a tiny bit of white to it. Just a smidge. We're talking 1 part white and 10 parts base colour. Use this lighter colour to very carefully go over the edges and raised areas of the model. This will help give it some variety :)  Lastly, do you have access to any washes? If so, a simply wash with Nuln oil will soak into the recesses of the model and give it some depth, making your previous highlight standout more."
Warhammer40k,3e1gaa,HeadStar,2,Tue Jul 21 07:38:36 2015 UTC,"I love this colour scheme, apart from I'm a true stickler for metallic / black guns.   Lastly, do you have access to any washes? If so, a simply wash with Nuln oil will soak into the recesses of the model and give it some depth, making your previous highlight standout more.   this I think is the best piece of advice,  would cover a multitude of sins and add a bit of depth the break up the flat green palette."

Warhammer40k,3e13ns,Xivai,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:06:53 2015 UTC,Pathfinders suck. Your going to want either a few Skyray's or some ML drones with a commander. Or forgeworld skimmers that have them.   Really anything BUT Pathfinders. Which you will find your opponent will target first and wipe out in the first turn leaving you with no ML support.
Warhammer40k,3e13ns,Wootster10,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:59:24 2015 UTC,They're dirt cheap and one of the most crucial parts of a Tau army. Using a commander on a drone squad is a waste of points on a commander. You rarely need more than 2 markerlights on a target either way.
Warhammer40k,3e13ns,DTG_Mods_Blow,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:25:52 2015 UTC,Using a commander on a drone squad is a waste of points on a commander.   The JSJ ability of command-marker is far from a waste of points.
Warhammer40k,3e13ns,Wootster10,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:59:42 2015 UTC,"You will only need 4 markerlights on a target at the most, and usually only 2. A standard Commander is 85 points plus another 5 to give them a drone controller for BS5 drones. For those points you could have paid for 2x4 pathfinder squads. You'll get the same amount of ML on your targets with more flexibility and another target for your opponents to have to shoot at giving more redundancy. Plus your using a Commander which is far better with regular Crisis squad using C&CN or a MSSS"
Warhammer40k,3e13ns,DTG_Mods_Blow,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:06:46 2015 UTC,"If you think 2 to 4 markerlights is all you need on a target you haven't been playing against Necrons much.  As for ""more flexibility"" your pathfinder squads are trying to markerlight at BS1 if they have moved at all.  Which means a command-marker can hide completely out of sight during the enemy's turn so there is no markerlight target for your opponent to shoot at."
Warhammer40k,3e13ns,Wootster10,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:23:43 2015 UTC,"I've played plenty vs necrons. Most of the time your firewarriors only need two markerlights to make them BS5. With a Cadre Fireblade they pump out enough rounds to bring them down. Otherwise I'm removing the cover save for an Str8 AP2/3 large blast from a Riptide or Hammerhead. The fact that Pathfinders have scout and markerlights have a 36"" range. I can have 3 squads of them for just 1 of a drone squad with a commander. And by turn 3/4 I've never really needed my markerlights as I've done enough damage to the enemy to no longer need them. Couple them with a Battlesuit army and playing Maelstrom missions never been an issue"

I found a pretty sweet deal on ebay that was like 1/5 of the MSRP so i bought it even though there was tons of stuff i didn't want. I have the same logic as you though, i wanted to pick the models that look the coolest, and thankfully they are also pretty much the best.  Riptides are great, get 3, never look back.  Broadsides and crisis suits are also very good and the pinnacle of cool (i wish the crisis suits weren't so blocky, but whatever).  Lots of fire warriors is good and some pathfinders for sweet ass marker lights. Hammerheads are also solid, as well as devilfishes. As far as i'm concerned, nothing else in the codex really interests me, visually or for playability.  Play what you think is cool and you'll do fine i bet, tau rules."

He's crazy versatile and very effective on the table.  Otherwise your list looks pretty good.  I'd say from there the first thing to expand to is a devilfish or two so you can move your fire warriors to objectives a little easier.
Warhammer40k,3e0r9j,PipeDope131,3,Tue Jul 21 01:54:57 2015 UTC,This is what unbound is made for.  To keep the rules from getting in the way of your army.  In a strict tournament legal sense you would need at least one troop choice from the chaos demons codex to make an allies detachment.

That means he'd be taking:  Chaos Marines: CAD detachment (with a marine HQ, probably a Sorceror with Tzeentch to get his TSons as troops, then his TSons as his troops)  Chaos Daemons: Allied Detachment (Fateweaver HQ, Horrors Troops).   Otherwise you can play with the Fateweacer as an unbound detachment of Chaos Daemons just by himself. The only restriction is, if you made him your warlord, he would not get a trait I believe."

Races like Eldar and Dark Eldar, Space Marines and Chaos Marines have more differences than squats did. You have to bear in mind that Guard only became a thing with 2nd edition, which would have seen 3 Imperial armies (SM, IG & Squats), which all would be sharing a whole bunch of rules, so would have felt very samey.

Warhammer40k,3e1mob,Paladin327,3,Tue Jul 21 13:10:02 2015 UTC,"Well yeah. But that all falls under the purview of ""transported Wraithguard.""  I also count WWP Wraithguard the same way. That may even be the worst."
Warhammer40k,3e1mob,mrsc0tty,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:06:47 2015 UTC,As someome with these things and many more: have more than one list. And magnetize units that have weapon options. Like I magnetized all my wraith guard to also be wraithblades to pair with my harlequins when I want an all melee army. Talk with your friends about what is okay. Honestly if your opponent is running a tuned list they should have counters for it. Sm grav weapons in a drop pod? That wraithknight bloops into nothingness quick for example.
Warhammer40k,3e1mob,foreverataglance,3,Tue Jul 21 13:19:50 2015 UTC,"Yes, if your opponent is running a tournament quality list they can destroy a tournament quality list. But if your opponent is, say, Orks, Dark Eldar, or Sisters of Battle, no efficient counters to a Wraithknight exist for them to ""tune"" into their list.   So for a new player, having options that invalidate whole other codexes is not as good an idea. Magnetize your bikes/Wraithguard? Great. But there's not really a way to field a WK that doesn't just shit all over codexes that haven't ""got theirs"" with regards to the post-Necron power creep.   A wraithknight is a 300 point model that's worth easily 450. There's not really getting around it. I have yet to meet an Eldar player who doesn't feel personally victimized when I say I'm not interested in facing a list that fields 2-3, because yeah, I get it, they look cool and it's fun watching them stomp through three times their points value. But once you've seen it once or twice on the receiving end, it becomes a lot easier to just say ""no thanks"" than it is to remodel your entire collection to this month's competitively viable build."
Warhammer40k,3e1mob,mrsc0tty,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:05:28 2015 UTC,Our group we dont bring knights/super heavies/forge world big models unless everyone is. It really comes down to discussing with your opponents what they are okay with. Sure..i do love my bikes wraiths psykers. Etc. Its no fun though if the other side isnt on the same level with. Honestly more than 2 is just the player kinda being a troll. Few lists can do something about all that. I own 1 because I love the way it looks. It can sit on the shelf for all I care as a collector piece till my friends wanna play against it. Sm sky hammer with grav weapons though...your wraiths do fall damn fast to that though(good friend of mine runs sm hence the references.)
Warhammer40k,3e1mob,foreverataglance,2,Tue Jul 21 14:12:14 2015 UTC,"Yeah. But a new player isn't gonna want to buy shit that he's only gonna be able to play if his opponent gives him the okay.   Instead, you have the choice of:  -Literally all the aspects and non-Windrider guardians  -Every vehicle in the codex  -Every HQ in the codex  -Both flyers  -Any number of allied Harlequins  And nobody will have any reason to whine/refuse a game. The OP wanted to know ""what's the list to avoid losing out on games"" and that's the three units I listed. Those three in those configurations (or any in the case of the WK) you may have to not play against certain opponents using less than purely competitive lists."
Warhammer40k,3e1mob,mrsc0tty,0,Tue Jul 21 14:26:55 2015 UTC,Maybes its just my local group...but I've never seen someone whine or groan out of a game. Different strokes for different folks.
Warhammer40k,3e1mob,foreverataglance,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:44:45 2015 UTC,"With us it tends to be more like, someone who posts up with a super strong list tends to only get a few takers so they end up naturally playing each other more and more/occasionally sitting out. It's usually more on the internet you hear about ""I will never play against X Y or Z and will always refuse games rabble rabble!"" Personally I've only refused a game once against a guy who was really heavily misinterpreting the rules of his models, and didn't have the rules for them on hand.   But I also know I've got an uncommonly big/diverse club. I know there are different, smaller gaming groups in the area one which is only top-tier competitive and one that is much more picky/choosey."

Warhammer40k,3e1mob,foreverataglance,0,Tue Jul 21 16:07:10 2015 UTC,My suggestion with Wraithguard is to ask your opponent if you can use the 6th edition rules. They cost the same now as they did in the old book and were powerful but still very fair. The models are too awesome looking to avoid taking.
Warhammer40k,3dzjxq,Spiderpenny,8,Mon Jul 20 20:22:03 2015 UTC,"I suggest building, painting and playing what you have already, then work your way up. You have about 500pts right now which is like the perfect beginner amount. then when you've painted everything, buy another model and repeat. try for 1000, 1500 and then work up to 2000. If you like tanks, maybe buy some wyverns (theyre pretty great on the table), and at least 3 more russes, that way you can run knight commander pask in a punisher with escort tank, two russes as heavy support and a squad of wyverns for 3 heavy support slots. Thats 4 russes and 3 wyverns, then support it with two squads of vets with 3 meltas or flamers in a chimera. Maybe throw in some valkyries or vendettas and a super heavy and boom you got a solid mech list!"
Warhammer40k,3dzjxq,mutinygriz,3,Mon Jul 20 21:14:13 2015 UTC,"I am also a fan of mech lists, with the cadian defense force as a start you will be buying a decent amount of things to get it up to 2k pts. This would be stuff like buying more LRs, chimeras, vendettas, and troops.   IMO start small and build up, its daunting when you are sitting on 3 tons of plastic (trust me I'm doing this now!). As a new player I would suggest starting at 500 pts (which is about what the Cadian Defense Force is) to get the feel of the army, then build what you like from there. Also if you are unsure what to look for try googling ""2000 pt astra militarum mech list""   Here's one I was looking at the other day, although I prefer artillery to tons of vets: http://www.dakkadakka.com/dakkaforum/posts/list/617018.page"

Make sure you paint up and practice with what you have right now.  You'll be hating your self if you let the unpainted minis pile up."
Warhammer40k,3dzjxq,ANakedBear,2,Mon Jul 20 21:56:29 2015 UTC,"If you want a 2000 Point force, buy at least two or three more Cadian Defence Forces. And a couple of flyers. And some more infantry.  The Cadian Defence Force contains something like 450-600 points worth of stuff, depending on how you load it out. Generally, new players to the hobby start small or relatively small and build their way up. The Cadian Defence Force (if paired with some more infantry, maybe another transport or tank) is quite a good start that you can build from. It contains a lot of Guard essentials like Leman Russ, Chimera, infantry, etc, but it isn't a very strong list on its own.  Build and paint your Defence Force, acquire a Codex and maybe play some small games, then expand from there. With guard, the two main styles are Mechanised (all infantry mounted in transports, emphasis on tanks, aircraft and artillery) or Blob (massive numbers of foot infantry, heavy weapons backed up by artillery, tanks and aircraft). You can also play mixed lists and there are lots of options for allying with other factions or building completely non-standard lists (EVERYBODY IN VALKYRIES. IT'S RAINING MEN). The core types are mainly Blob and Mech based, though. It's good to examine both, watch battle reports, read up on tactics and lean toward one you prefer.  An example Mechanised List at 2000 points might be something like half a dozen Leman Russes with Tank Commander HQ, 4 squads of Veterans in Chimeras, some artillery like Wyverns and a flyer or two.  An example Blob List at 2000 Points might be two Company Command Squads for orders, a blob of 40 conscripts led by a priest/commissar to consume the enemy. Then enough infantry platoons to cover 85% of the surface area of your deployment zone. The remaining 15% you use for artillery and Leman Russes.   In my opinion, guard are a fairly solid, good looking army. They're fairly decent on their own, but if you pair them up with strong ally combinations like certain Space Marine chapters or the Inquisition, they can be deadly."

Painting is far more manageable when you can actually finish projects If you like Mech, the cornerstone of the force is Tank Commander Pask. Put him in a Punisher or Executioner (with plasma sponsons).    The other core of the Mech list is the Steel Host formation. Gives the formation in range of the tank commander Preferred Enemy.    You still need troops. Veterans in Chimeras with 3 meltaguns or 3 flamers is standard. Doctrines option but Demolitions is best    You'll need adequate AA as most flyers take on tanks. Hydras and Vendettas are the cornerstone of that level.    An Aegis Defence Line and/or Void Shield Generator are great for the backfield shooting tanks    Consider an allied Imperial Knight.

Warhammer40k,3e1j2v,jreilly89,2,Tue Jul 21 06:16:51 2015 UTC,"I guess nobody really ""knows"" why they did it, outside of GW themselves, but my best guess is this: They wanted to cange the bases of Fantasy from square to round. The best reason for this would be that their best selling game (40k) uses round bases and it's economically favourable to order more of something in bulk than order less of something in two bulks. A simple calculation would be: Order 100,000 round 25mm bases and save 3 cents on each or order 50,000 round 25mm and 50,000 square bases and save 1 cent on each (as opposed to buying them single. I guess everybody knows how bulk buying works basically). If it'd work out like this in reality, they'd save 100,000 x 2 cent = $2,000 just by using the same bases for all their miniatures. This would of course scale up rapidly with bigger numbers.    But then they would have to exclude the older, square based Fantasy models OR force everybody to re-base. So now they have to come up with a ruleset that allows both round AND square bases. The only real fair way to do this is: make the bases irrelevant. Having a ""counts as in base"" would still be a reason to argue about rules and as I see it, they wanted to make AoS as much about communicating and compromising as possible. So having a set rule (whatever it would have been) was unfavourable in comparison to ""it doesn't matter at all"". You can still house rule it, of course.   I don't know if it really ""hurts"" the models when you pile bases... as long as you don't smash them together they'll be fine, even if the bases are decorated.

Warhammer40k,3dx80s,Yayzeus,29,Tue Jul 21 10:07:19 2015 UTC,"My theory has been for quite some time that it revolves around the death and release of the Emperor's spirit.  Basic story, Cypher knows this, is an agent for good and is working ever closer to Terra to kill the Emperor. (Basically he'll present himself and the Lion sword before the Emperor, ask for forgiveness for all the Dark Angels and then stab him in the gut. Saying something like ""The last shall be first, and the first shall be last."")  Once the Emperor is killed he can be reborn.  Now, in my mind, he'll be born on a human world that has been conquered by the Tau. Here he will learn that not all Xenos are bad, and at some point he has a revelation and awakening as to what he is/was.  Working with the Tau he attempts to unify the forces of the universe again. So there become some Tau that hate this human usurpers, others who like him. Marines and Imperials who embrace him, and Marines and Imperials who reject him.  The Adeptus Mechanicus would reject him outright - as I'd like to see the Dragon awake as the machine god, losing Terra in the process.  So a big part of the new crusade would be an advance on Earth, to take it back from the Dragon.  That's my general story idea."

Naturally requiring the ultimate sacrifice on the part of the host. This would require a supremely powerful psyker (Magnus level at bear minimum) to manage.  If the Illuminati (possessed psykers who have been saved) are right, then the Emperor can be revived by sacrificing every single one of his blood relatives (all powerful psykers in their own right) the moment the Emperor's will fails and he dies.  A subfaction of the Illuminati wants to subjugate all of humanity to a warp entity known as the Hydra, which would psychically link every human in the Galaxy and rob everyone of individuality and free will. This would render the influence the Chaos Gods have on humanity negligible and virtually eliminate them as threats.  Anyway, in the first three cases, humanity will be crippled, as when the Emperor dies the Imperium will lose the Astromonicon and their ability to coordinate warp travel effectively over long distances. It will open the Imperium up to sweeping conquest and permit the rapid expansion of Chaos forces throughout Imperial space.  In the time frame it takes him to be reborn (who knows how long that could take), the Imperium may very well fail.   If he ascends, there's a chance that humanity could prevail, as the Imperium would then have direct influence over the warp. Possibly reducing or eliminating the need for the Astronomicon.

The version of the Tau I prefer is the socialist paradise, where some are more equal than others, and dissidents are disappeared and verboten.   Though that brings up something I've been wondering. Presumably at least some gue'la are allowed to breed, and that means a certain number of psykers. Do they allow the Black Ships into their space to pick up the trash, so to speak? It seems like they'd be aware of what happens otherwise, and don't have the infrastructure to support the processing, training, and disposal of the warp-warp-tainted."

Also iirc the tau have little to no understanding of psykers or chaos, so they'd see the black ships as just another imperial invasion.

Warhammer40k,3dx80s,phuckyeahsharks,10,Mon Jul 20 17:27:08 2015 UTC,"Depends how far forward you go.  I understand the theory behind the emperor being reborn, but it doesn't really fit with the grimdark setting of 40k, with the imperium desperately trying to stave off the darkness. I also think people posting are seriously underestimating how bad it would be for the Imperium if the emperor kicked it and the astronomican went out. With that gone, long range travel is impossible and the imperium ceases to function as a galaxy spanning power. The imperium is highly reliant on mobility to allow specialisation of its worlds. It would no longer be able to ship materials to a forgeworld and goods out of one, or food to hive world. The imperium would basically be limited to intra system travel, like moving between the planets of the solar system. Some systems like Ultramar would hold it together, most would be in a terrible state. Remember most worlds have PDF for defence, the imperial guard is really a mobile reserve, the great strength of the imperium is the ability to shift around its military resources to where they we needed most, without that many systems would be basically defenceless.  Abbadon would never reach Terra. Massing all your forces and just going for it sounds like a good idea, but even the most ardent chaos fanboy would have to admit that the Imperium simply has many more soldiers and space marine chapters it would mobilise to fight them. Engaging the Imperium in a war of attrition as chaos is a terrible idea because it's a war the Imperium will ALWAYS win. The real threat of chaos, and how it would progress would be a large system of world effectively being corrupted and turning traitor, which will cause more problems for the Imperium than throwing your fleet against Cadia for the umpteenth time.   I think its unlikely the Imperium would be in a position to use Exterminatus on a major Tau world. The Imperium simply lacks the free military forces on the Eastern Fringe to launch a major incursion into a tau space, sacrificing half your worlds to tyranids and orks to punch a hole in the tau empire is self defeating. The Imperium will probably continue a defensive war against the Tau, offensive actions being limited to counter attacking recently conquered worlds. The Tau themselves will probably slow their expansions, as outside the Damocles Gulf habitable planets are much less common, and their (relatively) slow warp travel will be a serious hindrance for them at this stage  Theres no reason more Tyranids can't arrive into the galaxy, however a more likely advancement is giving the war in Octavian system some sort of conclusion, with the imperium having to face an invigorated and stronger hive fleet Leviathan , which would pose a massive threat.  Necrons will continue to rise but in the short term theyll lack the numbers to do much more than conquer their traditional homeworlds and carve out mini empires for themselves. Considering how disparate the tomb world revivals are, it will be a long time until sufficient necrons awake to take over the galaxy.  A lot will be similar, Eldar will continue to dwindle, Dark Eldar will to raid, and Orks will continue to be Orks"

As the Mechanicus marshals its strength to repel the invaders Astartes Chapters from across the Imperium converge on the red planet to offer their support, the Iron Hands at the fore.  As battle becomes truly joined on the Martian sands Abbadon takes advantage of the Chaos to move against Terra. Suddenly Imperial forces entering the Sol system are forced to choose their loyalties, with some upholding oaths to Mars, others to the Emperor and deploying to one planet or the other as appropriate.  On Marsthe battle becomes desperate as the Necrons push into the Martian canyons, ignoring most of the planet's population centers in favour of pushing into the cursed lands between. The Fabricator General and a few of his most senior advisers suspect their actual goal based on heretical documents from the time of the first Martian Schism and direct their forces to press the battle even more strongly.  During the battle the Iron Hands are pressed back by the shifting tides of battle and take shelter in a secluded bunker deep in the Martian wilderness. Desperate calls from the Martian administration order them to leave the bunker's sacred ground, but the Hands have nowhere to go and, being Astartes, are far more practical than most, seeing long term victory as superior to temporary desecration. As the explore the bunker and prepare its defenses however they find something disturbing. Before they can report it their signals are jammed and a spearhead of Martian forces punch through the Necron lines before attack the Iron Hands within the bunker themselves.  The doubly besieged Marines manage to get a single message through the interference, it is badly garbled but it is clear that the Mechanicus has turned on them and that the contents of the bunker are proof that the Mechanicus' betrayal of the Sons of Mannus has been going on for centuries.   Shocked by this news more Iron Hand forces, along with forces from several of their successor chapters, push through to reinforce the bunker in a battle fought in almost absolute radio silence, the strength of the Martian jamming having increased by an order of magnitude after that first message squeaked through.  After nearly a fortnight of three way battle between the Astartes, the Mechanicus, and the Necrons, the contents of the bunker makes itself known. Within the ancient structure the Iron Hands had discovered a long sealed laboratory with two objects within it.   One was an ornate Dreadnought chassis, unique though more similar to the Contemptor pattern than most modern dreadoughts. Its systems were the most finely crafted any of the Iron Fathers present had ever seen, and seemed to even exceed the God-Machines of the Adeptus Titanicus in its craftsmanship. It had been nearly fully prepared to receive an occupant, with only the most basic of medical systems needing to still be connected, the few pieces of technology within the understanding of the assembled techmarines, as they remained common even to modern dreadnoughts.  The other was kept in a stasis field with heavy and sacred wards. Nearly the entirely of the battle for this bunker was to secure the techmarines and Iron Fathers of the chapters the time they needed to decipher the arcane devices and disable the stasis field. The logs and journals stored in the laboratory did not spell out the objects nature, though they did show that the object had been recovered from the sands of Istvaan V, and brought back to Mars at the Emperor's command. It was His order that the dreadnought chassis be constructed to receive the recovered item, and it had taken loyal tech priests, secluded in this lab, nearly the entirety of the Horus Heresy to construct the Chassis for it. But with the Emperor's death at the climax of the conflict the Fabricator General had decided completing the project was too risky, they could not accurately predict the outcome, and so the project was halted.  A few techmarines had been preparing the Dreadnought to receive whatever was within in the field if their suspicions proved correct, and indeed, as the last wards came down they were. The dreadnought had been prepared to receive nothing less than the head of Ferrus Manus. Though the transition was awkward for their progenitor the Iron Fathers succeeded in explaining what had transpired and what the situation was and, lead by the resurrected progenitor, the Iron Hands stormed out of the bunker, slaughtering their way through the Necrons and the forces of the Mechanicus. The delay had been too great, however, and even as the Iron Hands drove their enemies, new and old, back there was a fantastically powerful explosion over the horizon.  Deep in the canyons of Mars the Necrons had reached their objective, and with the fury of an unleashed God the Dragon's prison was shattered and it arose, determined to reap a terrible tally from those who had exploited it for so many millennia.  Meanwhile, on Terra, with Imperial forces divided between that world and the Red Planet the forces lead by Abbadon had had a relatively easy time of it. No decade long sieges were in the offing this time, and within a month the forces of Chaos had pushed the defenders back through the myriad halls of the Emperor's Palace. At the very doors of the Throne room Abbadon's chosen did battle with the Custodes as their master pushed past them and stormed into the Emperor's chambers themselves.  There, at the foot of the Golden Throne, stood three of the Imperium's greatest champions: Marneus Calgar, Chapter Master of the Ultramarines; Constatin Valdor, commander of the Custodes; and Kaldor Draigo; supreme grand master of the Grey Knights.  Without a word battle was joined, and despite being empowered by the Dark Gods Abbadon washad pressed to overcome these heroes. And over time they struck wounds which began to tell on the dark champion. Mortally injured, barely able to stand Abbadon was able to push past them with one final burst of strength and, reaching out with the Talon taken from the corpse of his long dead Primarch, ripped out a great bundle of wires and piping attached to the Golden Throne.  For the first time in ten thousand years the Emperor Spoke, a weakly wailed ""Noooo"" issuing from long dead lips as the machinery of the Golden Throne sputtered and ground to a halt. At the read of the room the great golden gates, long held shut by nothing more than the Emperor's unbreakable will, begin to crack open and the raw stuff of the immaterium spills into the throne room. Abbadon's laughter fills the room and shadowy shapes of creatures beyond the imagining of mortal man can be seen flitting about beyond the rapidly widening gap. The champions steel themselves to face these new forces, bolstered by the few surviving Custodes from the melee in the antechamber, but as they watch Abaddon's laughter begins to be join by others. The first quiet childlike giggles were joined by hearty belly laughs, silly sounding guffaws, the cackle of the maniac and the bellow of the truly entertained. The cacophony of laughter grew in volume as the gap widened, and the champions came to be aware of other shapes amongst those of the daemons in the riling madness beyond it. Both the darkly stoic shape of Astartes, licked by flame as they assault the chaotic forces, and the darting form of the Xenos Eldar dancing amongst the Daemons and reaping a bloody toll.  As the gate neared it full width open a final form appeared, on a lithe jet bike accented with wicked blades the form powered towards the portal. Driving the nose of the craft through one of the larger beasts it's occupant flung himself towards the gap sailing through the air, approaching the threshold even as the gap opened fully.  At that moment there was a blindingly bright flash, dazzling even the eyes of the enhanced Custodes, and the laughter ceased suddenly. Standing now in near silence the assembled warriors looked up. Where once a gateway to madness had stood there there was no little more than a roughly hewn stone face, kneeling before it was a figure wearing rags and carrying a crude blade. As he stood the Custodes fell to a knee, leaving Draigo and Calgar standing confused amidst them. The man was of giant stature, even to the Astartes, and bore a regal presence even in his modest trappings. Abbadon, still dying slowly on the ground before the Throne spit towards the man in disgust and anger as he was approached by the figure. ""Khan."" He said, the words dripping with venom.  Jaghatai Kahn looked down at the dying champion of the dark gods with a mixture of anger, disgust, and pity. Finally he sneered at the dying man. ""Traitor."" he replied and brought his blade down on Abbadon's neck.   With only a moment's pause he rushed to the foot of the Golden Throne, kneeling himself before the skeletal figure there with his head bowed. ""Father,"" he said, ""I'm sorry, I was too late."" The figure of the Emperor did not speak again, but all assembled felt a mixture of joy and sadness fill the room and a single tear rolled down the Emperor's cheek before his body started to disintegrate, blowing away as dust on the gentle air currents of the room.  Across the Imperium madness took hold for a moment. The Astronomicon flickered and died, every bell in every church the breadth of the glaxay began to peel of its own accord, candles in shrines flickered and died, and a great despair took hold of humanity for a moment.  (Continued below, also, never knew there was a character limit on Reddit comments before :P)"
Warhammer40k,3dx80s,Tletl,11,Tue Jul 21 13:12:09 2015 UTC,"But only for a moment.  For the next the Astronomicon flared back into life, brighter and more vibrant that it had ever been. Psykers on Terra were struck physically blind by its brilliance, and even in distant corners of the galaxy those attuned to the warp felt the light's warmth on their skin in its first moments. Entire Tyranid swarms fell into anarchy as their shadow in the warp was blasted away for a moment, their synaptic links severed by the sheer energy spreading through the cosmos. Orks paused in whatever violence they were participating in, their blood lust subsiding as the Emperor's light drowned out the calls for bloodshed from their warring Gods. The Eye of Terror, the Maelstrom, and many other warp storms besides warped and distorted as they were buffeted by the psychic shockwave, many of the smaller rifts simply blowing out of existence.  On Maccragge the stasis systems keeping the body of Robute Guilliman preserved sparked and died and the man within shot upright, grabbing at the fresh scar on his throat. On Nocture a great shooting star strikes the igneous landscape, and when Salamander forces arrive to investigate they find Forgefather Vulkan He'stan emerging from an ancient stormbird, the Primarch Vulkan following in his wake. Ancient vessels emerge from the warp above Fenris and Deliverance bearing back those world's rightful rulers after millennia long quests. And in the depths of the Rock great gates unopened since the sundering of the planet rumble open as a long slumbering figure begins to stir.  On Mars the Dragon, who had been killing all before him for several hours at this point, and the Necrons who unleashed him are also struck by this shock wave. That close to Terra raw warp stuff manifests spontaneously across the planet and even the Dragon shrivels at its touch. Realizing tit's vengeance can't be had amidst the maelstrom of warp energies the Necrons and the C'tan fall back to their vessels and flee the world. Many of the adepts of the Mechanicus realized that this was the Machine God they had worshiped for so long and followed them, declaring their loyalty to the being whose power they had benefited from since nearly the dawn of mankind. With the Necron threat neutralized the Iron Hands and the remaining forces of the Mechanicus settle into an uneasy truce as they wait to see what happens next.  Back on Terra the forces of Chaos are in full retreat knowing, in no uncertain terms, that they have been defeated yet again. Jaghatai emerges onto the Ramparts of the palace, holding Abbadon's head aloft as the loyal forces chase down the fleeing traitors.  While a new warp storm begins to form around Terra the will of the newly ascended Emperor snuffs it out quickly. And soon only rare breeches of reality flicker across the war ravaged landscape of humanity's home world. Across the Galaxy humanity's defenders prepare themselves for a new age.  In the far East of the Galaxy, independent of the events happening on Terra Commander Farsight of the Tau has finished analyzing the abilities of the Ethereals, and has found that they are, in fact, warp based. It is a low level power which even the Ethereals themselves do not realize comes from the immaterium, but can be blocked with suitable wards. Building on the talismen his forces recovered on Arthas Moloch the scientists working under his guidance have successfully discovered ways to block the Ethereal's influence.   Girded with this new ability Farsight leads his forces back into the Empire, striking swiftly against many worlds. They strike swiftly, isolating Ethereals and binding them with the new technology, freeing those worlds of the Ethereal's unnatural influence.  Faced by this unexpected lightning assault Shadowsun recalls all Ethereals to T'au where they can be most easily protected. With this in place Farsight's forces begin to bypass worlds where the recall has completed, pressing on instead to the heart of the Empire.  Emerging in the T'au system Farsight identified Shadowsun's flagship, in orbit of the home world and launches and immediate boarding action. After battling through the halls of the vessel he reaches the bridge where Shadowsun stands with a few of her personal Ethereals behind a powerful forcefield. There he appeals to his former comrade to see the path of servitude the Ethereals have lead the Tau people down and to join him in bringing the Empire true freedom.  Shadowsun agrees with him, but not for his reasons. Years before on the planet of Agrellan Shadowsun had been beset by a malignant presence, one which had slowly twisted her ways of thinking, while also helping her understand for herself the Ethereal's abilities and other secrets of what lies beyond the veil. Armed with this knowledge she explains to Farsight that his actions played right into her hands, accelerating schemes she had believed would take years more to bring to fruition. She explains that his advance and the targeting of Ethereals had been the ideal excuse for her to bring all the leaders of the Tau to a single place, directly below their cruiser. As the Ethereals with her, each long since having sworn fealty to the Dark Gods, chant to their patrons Shadowsun issues the commands to open fire on the building in which the Ethereals are being “guarded”. With the roar of orbital fire nearly the entire Ethereals cast is destroyed in a matter of moments, their souls offered to the Dark Gods in tribute.  To Farsight's horror he watches as the woman's form begins to twist and distort. Dark energies flow through her as she discards her mortal form for that of the immaterium. Faced with this new threat Farsight's bodyguard moves to defend him and a dozen of them are struck down in as many seconds, their weapons all but useless against the newly birthed Daemon Princess. Farsight himself then confronts her, and as battle rages around them between their followers Farsight finds that his blade can, in fact, do damage to his old rival. The conflict is fierce but in the end Farsight is victorious, the ancient  weapon seeming to act almost of its own accord when faced with Shadowsun's new form, striking her to maximum effect and blocking the majority of her return blows. As he raises his weapon to deliver the death stroke Shadowsun tells him that he can no longer kill her, only banish her for a time, and that she would return eventually to ensure their people see the glory of Chaos and revel in its destruction and excess.  With a promise to stand against her no matter how many times he returns Farsight strikes her down, her material form dissipating as his blade bites into her flesh. Shadowsun's followers retreat, fleeing to escape pods and shuttles. But messages soon come in revealing that the cancer of Shadowsun's beliefs has been gnawing at the heart of Tau society for some time, and the death of the Ethereals went out as a beacon across the Empire leading to uprisings and conflict as the followers of the Dark Gods turned on those still dedicated to the Greater Good. Horrified and beset Farsight sends a message to anyone able to receive it. A message of reassurance that whatever darkness was besetting them now would be overcome. The Greater Good would prevail and soon new leaders would be chosen to do so.  As the fighting dies down there is no question amongst anyone who this new leader should be, and though he attempts to refuse the honour Farsight himself is proclaimed the new ruler of the Tau, a role he accept with a heavy heart as he begins to prepare his countrymen for the return of their newly corrupted kin."

Warhammer40k,3dx80s,NerdyDjinn,10,Mon Jul 20 13:28:14 2015 UTC,"IMO, the best way to proceed is basically kill the Emprah.  That throws the cat amongst the pigeons for the loyalists, and makes Imperium fleets hard to move, basically isolating each conquered system.  Abaddon isn't going to make it to Terra while the Imperium still has mobility, so there's that too.  I don't know shit about Xeno races, other than the 'nids should be buttfucking far more than they are, so really any further incursion into Imperial space from them should lead to more widespread ""Holyshitbugs"".  The Mechanicum need their dick taking out of their hands, and re-focusing on development rather than hunting down old STC's (And then I could believe the centurion thing..), which might provide some meaningful way to combat the slight bug problem - Maybe even provide a slightly safer way through the warp.  I thought Tau were considered ""alright"" by Emprahman, but I guess with the Imperium eating paste in the corner and not able to move fleets around the Tau should be able to conquer Imperial space near them. Are they similar to the Imperium, or is their interstellar travel less unpredictable/retarded? Maybe the Tau do some ass kicking and ruin the 'Nids day because you know, technology.  Throw into that the return of some Primarchs on both sides - Maybe just some of the key ones on each? Rowboat Girlytits, Lionel Richie, Lemon Ruth? I dunno who's still alive on the heretic side, though, so maybe Angry Ron, Perturabo and Lorgar? I dunno, I'm not a heretic scientist.  Should be pretty unsettled and provide a backdrop for a national scale campaign a-la 3rd War for Armageddon, if anyone remembers how awesome that was."

They also lack navigators so they really can't perform long range jumps. They would have to adopt a system hopping tactic and heavily reinforce their supply lines to prevent sweeping advances from long range warp capable factions unhampered by the lack of the Astronomicon (Chaos, Necrons).  Of course there's always a chance the Tau could locate a Webway gate and capture it, in which case they could show up anywhere assuming they come to some kind of agreement with the Eldar."

So he takes himself a wander downstairs to politely beat the everloving shit out of Luther and eventually tears his head off. He then calls back the ENTIRE FUCKING LEGION to the rock to have a great council with all of the Chapter Masters of all the successors and obviously our best budsy Azrael[Sic? Idek] along with other assorted important folks (Belial, Sammael, fuck these names etc.).  The Lion tells everyone that the Emperor is actually the great evil, not chaos, and basically explodes the heads of anyone who says otherwise with his fists. He then takes his newly reformed legion and decides it's time for a parade through Terra all the way to the foot of the golden throne. Obviously some inquisitorial eyebrows are raised, but are you going to fuck with a primarch? Nope. The Lion walks into the Emprah's throne room and curb-stomps the corpse on the throne, leading to the webway opening and all hell breaking loose in the throne room. Emps's dying words which echo through the minds of most of humanity as well as much of the eldar are ""Why my son?"" Meant not as really a question, but as a mindfuck BECAUSE MOAR DADDY ISSUES.   Naturally Khan, Russ, and the ENTIRETY of the spacewolves that followed him (Minus all of them but like 5 with plot armor so thick Thrall of world of warcraft jizzes in his pants) and engage all of the Dark Angels plus all the daemons that were in the webway in FISTICUFFS and wipe out three quarters of the legion. Naturally the Lion waits for an opening after Russ eviscerates poor Belial and stabs him right in his puppydog face. The other 5 dogs run out along with all the custodes who shat a collective brick (of gold probably) and didn't really want to fight all that shit. Khan makes it out. Somehow. They all hop on a space ship and peace the fuck out to Mcragge where Row Boat Girly-Moose has just awoken and rallied the Ultramarines and her successors because Rau Boot knew of the Lions intentions all along (Cause Smurfs.) (Of course he masturbates to the Codex Astartes first).  With the holy Astronomicon now exploded the whole of the Imperium is freaking the fuck out because they can't do more than tiny little jumps through the warp. Attempts to get into the Eldar webway are tried and fail catastrophically. Abbadon springs out of the Eye at this newfound weakness and easily crushes Cadia as it has little to no support from off-world and the space marine legions, who at this point have thrown the codex out the window and reformed their old legions and begun fortifying their homeworlds (except the Imperial fists who probably move to like pluto or something, idek) because they are freaking the fuck out.  The Tyranids, now without the giant bugzapper to guide them, end up slowing down and following basically the same path at a MUCH slower rate, just consuming, consolidating their power and generally eating whatever they see, basically becoming the Reavers from Firefly. Don't go to the edge of the galaxy.  Ghazghkull Finally stands triumphant over the Octarian War. The nearly century long conflict comes to a close with the greatest warboss ever known crashing an ENTIRE FUCKING PLANET into much of the hivefleet Leviathan. The Hive Mind, realizing it has lost this battle, retreats to lick its wounds. The greatest warboss ever known now has a nearly unstoppable Waaagh!!! behind him which he directs back towards Armageddon, which he steamrolls and starts Trolling about throughout the galaxy becoming the plauge of Mankind and maybe an Eldar craftworld or two.  The Eldar cry, try to manipulate things, and end up going full Lizardmen and peacing out to a different universe.  I think my /tg/ is showing.  EDIT: Also ALL the Necrons wake up, they're grumpy, everyone dies, the world blows up AND NOW WE HAVE SOME SHITTY GAME SYSTEM WHERE THE EMPEROR IS ALIVE, HIS FACTION IS EVEN MORE OVERPOWERED, THE BALANCE IS BROKEN, AND WHY DO I HAVE TO TALK TO THIS FUCKING MODEL ALL THE FUCKING TIME?"

Warhammer40k,3dx80s,LostBaconSandwich,3,Mon Jul 20 15:21:43 2015 UTC,"The most logical major event to move the plot along is the death of the Emperor, and likely his ascent to full godhood in the warp or his re-birth as an incredibly powerful warrior like he was during the crusade.   Naturally, this would result in the Terra webway spilling over, so Terra, Mars, and such would be assaulted by daemons on all fronts. The Mechanicum and the Grey Knights would hold out for a while but suffer staggering losses.   Since he's the motherfucking Emperor, he makes a warp portal and takes himself and the Custodes to Cadia and kicks Abbadon out, making Cadia the temporary ""homeworld"" for Humanity as he leads the Great Crusade Mk. II to take back Terra and re-unite the imperial worlds that now have no way to connect to one another since the Astronomican got destroyed.  Leman Russ, Corvus Corax, Jagathai Khan, Lion El'Jonson, Roboute Guilliman, Vulkan, etc. come back one by one through various means. Meanwhile, Abbadon and the traitor primarchs get together and plan a big assault against the weakened Imperium.   With the astronomican gone, the rest of the Imperial worlds become prime targets for other threats. As the Emperor leads his force slowly outwards, he runs into Ghaznkull's bigger-than-ever WAAAAAAGH! that finally captured Armageddon, more Tyranid hive fleets, the Tau (I imagine that many desperate, isolated Imperial worlds would happily join the Greater Good in this scenario), etc.   The Gate of Khaine in Commoragh finally bursts open and the Dark Eldar start to get stomped by Daemons, maybe they have to evacuate and work with the regular Eldar to do something. I'd personally like to see the Black Library actually run into Commoragh, as they're both in the webway. The Harlequins guarding it would help quash the daemonic invasion to keep the webway secure. (Does the webway even work like this? Is it possible for the Black Library to reach Commoragh?)"

Warhammer40k,3dx80s,Yarkias,2,Mon Jul 20 15:19:14 2015 UTC,"The Tau finally find a way to travel at speeds comparable or even faster than Imperium warp travel.   A number of setbacks befall them at every turn. Farsight creating a schism in the ranks before redeeming himself.   Etherals control mechanism revealed and the consequences.   Ultimately no matter how much foes and chaos assail the Tau though the Greater Good has been by now instilled in them in spirit. Giving them the last piece of resistance they need against Chaos. It turns out the Greater Good was an experiment by an unknown species to create an anti-warp belief system. However that system has its downsides. Namely devotion to such a belief and whoever is perceived to uphold that belief.   The Tau lose on some fronts due to Orks/Nids. However their expansion towards the Imperium is at a break neck speed as almost no one can resist them as they are all dealing with much worse stuff than the Tau. So the Empire grows and shifts towards the Imperium and into the realms of Ultramar. Starting and ending a long and bloody battle with the Ultramrines that see them ousted from their realm and hungry for vengeance when the time is right.   Now on the galactic scale the Tau's Empire has grown too quickly for them to police in these dark times and they struggle to defend and hold all the worlds seeking to join their cause. To stem the tides of manpower shortage they activate their H.A.I.L project (Heightened Artificial Intelligence Lifeforms), an advanced sapient droids that are loyal to the Tau. This solves their manpower problems for now. Still many in the Empire and Enclaves are worried at the droids self adapting networked intelligence. For now though they do their jobs admirably and uphold the Greater Good and swiftly help bring some measure of order back to Tau worlds. Still this is not enough as the TE expands and soon they begin to deny captured worlds to their foes rather than protect them, many of them are simply destroyed and hurt the perception of the Tau. They can only police and protect so much human worlds with all the chaos infesting them.   At long last the Farsight discovers who created the Etherals and why. They and the greater good were created to be an anti-warp influence. As the Eldar were created by the Old Ones as one of their last hopes the Eldar created their last hope the Tau. It is rather ironic then that the Tau had no choice but to attack Eldar ships being unable to determine if they are DE/Eldar/Civil War.   The Etherals are killed off by chaos and Tzeetch before they can become too powerful, Tzeetch wants to shatter this powerful force before its a problem and bring the downfall of yet another Empire. However there is only one thing he couldn't count on. Farsight who started the Tau civil war seeking redemption for his actions. He now sees that despite all the power his freedom has brought to himself and his enclaves it has also weakened the TE.   The Tau people can only look to one person who could possibly lead them in these dire times now that Farsight stops Tzeetch and the chaos gods form destroying the Tau from the top down.   He has now inherited the Tau Empire larger than it has ever been and roiling with pskyers. He only has his experience with the warp to draw on and he knows what he has to do. He begins the troublesome task of cleansing the worlds who turned to him for help. Many humans and aliens die and yet he begins to bring stability to the over expanded Empire and finally solve its issues.   It will be a long road to recovery as the Tau look to their new God Emperor seemingly immortal man who seeks to unleash his crusades on the galaxy to conquer all in the name of the Greater Good and the Tau. It is with great reluctance he accepts his people calling him this. He knows its not true but he could never convince them otherwise. The H.A.I.L program works exceptionally well and for now its stability and loyalty are not in doubt, but now Tzeetch and the powers of chaos see a chance. It would take a long time, but perhaps the H.A.I.L droids could be influenced by the warp. Tzeetch smiles as he tugs on his endless strings.   Deep down Farsight knows nothing ever ends, and his heart grows weary with worry and regret that something worse is about to begin as he watches his forces launch wave after wave of expansion fleets to expand the Empire. Legions of H.A.I.L droids in tow."

The loyalist primarchs come back, and each perceives the others to have fallen to chaos, based upon what they see of the chapters sectors of space, and each declares a crusade on all/some of the other primarchs. I just think it would be awesome, as it would give GW a fluffy reason to bring back the primarchs without making the SM super OP.  My vision is of the emperor dying, terra being overrun with demons, and his death plunges the imperium into anarchy. This causes the primarchs to come back, and, looking at the imperiums state, each decides it has fallen to chaos. They then go on an a massive spree of murder and destruction, each primarch carving himself a mini-imperium.  And as the emperor is a perpetual, this wouldn't even neccesarily have to be the endgame. He could come back and maybe embark on a second great crusade, to once again reunite the imperium.. Of course, on his own, with maybe the grey knights and inquisition backing him up, he has no chance, an so we have nice little grimdark mess of carnage around the ruins of the imperium."

Warhammer40k,3dx80s,Mirthless56,1 point,Mon Jul 20 11:24:45 2015 UTC,"first thing that would happen is what most people have said, the Emp ether dies or get's reborn in some way. This is because as of the last recorded moment of the 40k timeline (books included) the throne had just shut down without warning. This means the only thing keeping the Emp from doing his thing has be released and he brings about a big change. This big change kinda kills Terra as without his power stopping the rift from opening the entire Sol system gets eaten (or atleast out to jumpier as I'm sure the GK would survive on titan) With the heart of the imperium gone the rest of the imperium collapses and as hard as the minitorum and the administratum try each sector starts to fall apart and break away cultures form once the news hits. With Terra gone most interstellar travel stops in all sectors that don't have navigational aids (for this have a read of the thramas crusade that sector has lots of little astonomicons in the heresy days and more than likely still does) Whole planets will start to starve and Billions upon Billions will die. The emp then shows himself to his sons and brings them back one at a time (girlyman first as ultras have the most forces at their disposal, Vulkan, Corax, Jaghatai, Dorn then the Lion since he's moving around a lot without the need for the astronomicon) As he does this he is gathering and consolidating all the loyal forces he can must and utterly destorying any xenos life they come across. The mechanicus also reels from the loss of Holy Mars and the destruction of the Void Dragon (though it is likely it survived and woke up to escape in time and returned to what used to be the necrons central empire) and will fragment into civil war as the reminants of the Mars cult try to restore their stock of STCs."

Warhammer40k,3dz2zb,jreilly89,2,Mon Jul 20 18:28:07 2015 UTC,"well they are salvo 2/3, so they get a minimum of 2 shots, 3 if you didn't move(plasma is 1 shot at full range, 2 at half range).  they wound high toughness things on 3s (or 2s) regardless of toughness, where as plasma wounds less (4s against T7 nurgle things for example).  plasma has Gets Hot!  they can immobilize/glance super heavies, plasma can at best, glance AV 13.  edit: on bikes, you don't need something to kill 5+ save guys with a low T, you have your bolthuns, so plasma is kinda pointless for them.   TL;DR: Grav does what plasma is used for, but better."
Warhammer40k,3dz2zb,ReaperOfCaliban,2,Mon Jul 20 18:27:15 2015 UTC,"The Grav Pistol and Cannon have the same range as their plasma counterparts, so the only direct comparison that you seem to want to make is between the guns. Plasma Guns are 24"", S 7, AP 2, Rapid Fire, Gets Hot. Grav Guns are 18"", S - , AP 2, Salvo 2/3, Graviton, Concussive. Plasma Guns roll to hit and wound as normal, rolling to hit twice at 12"", and treating ones to hit as wounds against the user, against which saves can be taken (vehicles suffer a glancing hit saveable on a 4+, I think). Grav Guns roll 3 to hit if the user hasn't moved and isn't relentless or equivalent, and 2 to hit at half range if the user has moved and isn't relentless or equivalent. Rolls to wound are successful on a result equal to or greater than the targets armour save, and rolls to wound of 6's inflict the Immobilized effect on vehicles (subsequent immobilizations remove additional hull-points as they do when rolling on the penetrating damage table). The Grav-Gun is also concussive against multi-wound targets. So yeah, against Marines and Terminators or equivalent, they're about equally effective, but the Grav-Gun is a little more multi-purpose at the expense of shorter range, whereas the Plasma Gun is very pure in it's purpose, and has greater range to compensate for it's slightly less tactical application."
Warhammer40k,3dz2zb,PacSam,2,Mon Jul 20 18:41:20 2015 UTC,So should I include both in my armies?
Warhammer40k,3dz2zb,PacSam,3,Mon Jul 20 19:00:39 2015 UTC,"Depends on what you're up against. Against MEQ and TEQ, Grav is the way to go, and now that Dark Angels have it, I'll be taking it instead of my usual Plasma Guns. 18"" is a comfortable range for me, so I'm not bothered by losing 6"" compared to Plasma Guns.   Plasma outperforms Grav against armies which are majority light infantry in transports (IG, for instance; Plasma would be better at breaking a Chimera and killing what's inside, whereas a Grav weapon would only glance and Immobilize on 6's, and would probably only wound the occupants on a 5 or 6). For all else (Marines, Necrons, and the like), Grav is the more reliable option."
Warhammer40k,3dz2zb,PacSam,2,Mon Jul 20 19:14:53 2015 UTC,I play DA as well! I'm thinking of running more ravenwing so I guess I should invest in some grav bikers as well as plasma? Also what do you think of grav cannons vs plasma cannons for devs?
Warhammer40k,3dz2zb,PacSam,2,Mon Jul 20 19:24:40 2015 UTC,"When I take Devs, I take a squad of 10 with three Grav-Cannons, a Missile Launcher w/ Flakk (Missile Launchers w/ Flakk Missiles are the most versatile heavy weapon in the game, I swear), and an Armourium Cherub. I Combat-Squad them before deployment, with two Grav-Cannons in one squad and the Missile Launcher w/ Grav-Cannon and Cherub in the other. I love Plasma Cannons, but you can't snap-fire them, which is problematic on non-relentless platforms, and you risk getting hot (and I swear to the Emperor, I've killed more of my marines with Gets Hot than I have killed enemy marines with the weapon itself). Then, of course, there's always the fact that any opponent with experience will space their models 2"" from one-another, so at most, a small blast will only hit one at a time. Furthermore, the Grav-Cannons come with Grav-Amps, I believe, and that means that you can re-roll your To-Wound results. If there's ever a turn where I really need something dead, I use the Armourium Cherub, so I can re-roll all To-Hits with my Grav-Cannon, and then subsequently re-roll all To-Wounds with it. Most of the time, that's 5/5 hits and 5/5 wounds resolved at AP 2 from 36"" away. I don't see that kind of killing potential on many other things, except maybe Super-Heavies or Tau gunboats, which I think is saying a lot.  Also, Grav Bikes are great, especially Ravenwing. You're relentless, so you always fire the full salvo, you can Scout before Turn 1 for a free 12"" movement, and then move 12"" naturally during your movement phase. If you're not within 18"" of something important at that point, your opponent either deployed very creatively, or you're doing something wrong. I like taking a dedicated Armour-Busting Ravenwing formation and then another support formation to kill whatever elite kill-squad was inside the transport. Five Bikes (two of which acting as meat shields, effectively) w/ two Melta Guns, a Combi-Melta, and a Land Speeder w/ two Multi-Meltas can easily wreck a Land Raider in one shooting phase, especially if the Speeder shoots and hits first, granting the bikes BS 5. Shooting the occupants with a follow-up squad of three bikes with two Grav-Guns and a Combi-Grav, and a Land Speeder w/ two Heavy Bolters should at least force a Morale check if it doesn't utterly cripple whatever's inside."
Warhammer40k,3dz2zb,PacSam,2,Mon Jul 20 19:49:32 2015 UTC,Would snap shooting or being relentless even matter if my devs just camp on an objective and support my other units?  EDIT: Is one flakk missile launcher enough?
Warhammer40k,3dz2zb,mrsc0tty,2,Mon Jul 20 19:57:21 2015 UTC,"It matters, but perhaps not all that much. I usually have one or two movement phases before my Devastators end up on the objectives that I'd like them to stay on, and I like being able to at least try to shoot at something on the way there. The real selling points for me are that I don't have to worry about Gets Hot!, and even if my opponent is highly conscious of their model spacing, a Grav-Cannon still has the opportunity to hit five times, whereas a Plasma Cannon might only be able to hit one model without scattering, and as many as four if it scatters perfectly. If you're really concerned about missing out on the blast template, you can always take two Plasma Cannons and two Grav-Cannons, and combat squad them however you want.   In response to the usefulness of a single Flakk Missile Launcher, I run a lot of Scouts w/ Flakk Missile Launchers, so it's almost never my only one. Most flyers have only two or three hull-points and fairly low armour values on all sides, so even if you only had one missile launcher, it can potentially bring a flyer down in two turns, or even one if you roll a lucky penetrating hit. I also like that you can use them to ""krak"" (huehuehue) light vehicles, or even just shoot them at a squad of MEQ for the AP 3. I don't use frag all that often unless I'm up against a lot of cultists or light guardsmen, or the like, but generally speaking, I get a ton of mileage out of Flakk Missile Launchers."
Warhammer40k,3dz2zb,SammyBecker,2,Mon Jul 20 20:03:41 2015 UTC,"2 grav cannons is a lot of points. I'm trying to go for the Lion's Blade detachment (battle Demi-company + Ravenwing support squadron) and a ravenwing strike force. It's do-able for 1500 points (what I usually play) but I feel like the extra grav cannons would take away important upgrades for ravenwing. Also I'm stuck with all plasma special weapons atm (sold some of my old units that I painted like shit), so what can I use my plasma cannons and guns for in the meantime while I try to get some grav guns?  Edit: the only person I have to play with currently has more than 1500 points so I might be able to get him to play larger games in the future"
Warhammer40k,3dz2zb,Quickjager,3,Mon Jul 20 20:16:09 2015 UTC,"Plasma Cannons are still great weapons, don't get me wrong, so in the absence of Grav Cannons, you can certainly use Plasma Cannons very effectively. I'd put the Plasma Guns in Tactical Squads, and leave the Ravenwing Squads as dedicated armour-breakers. I've drafted up a sample list of what a Lion's Blade Detachment could look like under these configurations which I've posted here. It clocks in at well below 1500 points (if I did the addition correctly), so there's a lot of room to add upgrades or additional models in some of the squads. The Demi-Company also allows for a squad of Dreadnoughts, which I absolutely love, especially now that they've been buffed, so you might consider throwing in a squad for a multi-purpose unit. Dreadnoughts shoot pretty well, have access to pretty nice weapons, and it's often forgotten that they get five S 10 AP 2 attacks at full initiative plus Hammer of Wrath at S 6 on the charge. They do good work."

Or maybe think of Eldar and Dark Eldar as Cold-War era USA and USSR, but then the Earth is attacked by aliens. They may not always get along, but they prefer each other to everyone else.  There are plenty of other cases where the ally table is a bit wishy-washy. For instance, the Space Wolves and Dark Angels both dislike the Inquisition, but they are still battle brothers.

Warhammer40k,3dxuz3,mit45,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:50:04 2015 UTC,"This would be what I would do. Even though it's crap, giving the HT a norn crown could be a pretty big boon in this particular case. If you fail IB just twice in one turn (your dice can and will turn against you) , the two shooty units will be almost 1000 points sitting useless on the table. I understand where you're coming from when building a theme list, but the current way IB stands really pigeon holes us."

Warhammer40k,3dydo6,DikBagel,3,Mon Jul 20 15:23:41 2015 UTC,"Well then if space marines are off the table I'd probably go necron on this one. Necrons have a strong codex with good unit selection and in general lots of easy inroads to making a good army.  Imperial guard, orks, and tyranids require lots of time painting and buying. You need lots of models to even just make basic army lists because units are either so cheap or so expensive that you need to take lots of cheap things to make your army somewhat manageable logistically or you simply need that many just to make the numbers add up.  Eldar is probably the most technical of the remaining options dark eldar as well. Lots of special rules and clauses within rules to remember and lots of raw math involved in making an army.  The sisters and imperial Knights have a big initial buy in price for entry but if you have the wallet they aren't bad.  Admech is my dark horse pick for you. Both the skitarii and the cult mechanicus are good armies in their own right but the work best paired with an army that can get them more mobile like marines. They are however decent on their own if you are into lots of unit diversity."
Warhammer40k,3dydo6,aura_enchanted,3,Mon Jul 20 15:34:19 2015 UTC,"Not looking to play space marines though as they seem too plain   Alright, I'm going to try to convince you otherwise, because imo Marine Equivalents (MEQs) are among the best armies to play and play against.  The entire game is balanced around the stats of the Space Marine, with the Space Marine being the metric all other armies are measured against.  As GW's poster child for 40k, Space Marines have the largest diversity for being a ""single"" race, with a very large selection of models, rule sets, and play styles.  ""Generic"" Marines  The usual concern with MEQs being generic is the misconception that there is only one type of Space Marine.  When you look at GW's site, everyone is painted blue with a big white ""U"", nothing that is particularly ornate, and a monotonous color scheme.  The thing with the Adeptus Astartes is that there are two aspects to building an MEQ force: picking the Codex and picking the play style from that Codex.    The main Space Marine Codex (C:SM) contains seven (7) different Chapter Tactics.  Each Chapter Tactic is a set of special rules that alters the play style of armies selected from that Chapter.  It can affect the optimization of weapon load outs, unit selection, how you deploy before turn 1, and how you close the game on turn 6.  White Scars, for example, would look for an aggressive setup with fast hitting troops while Iron Hands would look for a more defensive posture with an abundance of armored support.  Not only do these two Chapters differ in color, but they also have very unique builds that are usually very recognizable on the table top.  There are other Space Marine Chapters that are not ""Codex Compliant"", getting their own hyperlinks on the GW sidebar.  These Chapters include the Dark Angels (C:DA), the Space Wolves (C:SW), the Grey Knights (C:GK), and the Blood Angels (C:BA).  These Chapters differ from C:SM in such drastic ways that they have earned their own codex, model selection, and special rules.  For comparison, just look at the Terminators from each of the respective armies.  C:DA has the Deathwing Knights; C:SW has the Wolf Guard; C:GK has so many Terminators that they are troops; C:BA just got a new kit for their Terminators.  While these are all ""Terminators"", they all have individual styles, rules, and function on the table top.  While they are all similar to C:SM Terminators, their niche is different.  For example, Deathwing Knights are better in close combat than most units in the game, while C:GK has force weapons on all of their units making them far better at killing Monstrous Creatures.   Variety Within the Codex  Even within the selection of a Codex (and possibly Chapter Tactics), there is still a large variety within a MEQ force.  Take the White Scars from C:SM.  While it is possible to take them as an entirely mounted force, riding Space Marine Bikes into battle, they can also be fielded as a mechanized force (much like the Iron Hands).  However, the White Scars are still a fast and mobile force, one that looks to get in close combat, Hit&Running away from combats that get stale so they can start new fights afresh.    C:DA has two specialized companies that are vastly different from C:SM, although it does share similarities.  The Deathwing (from which the Deathwing Knights hail from) is composed entirely of Terminators.  Taking the fight to the enemy, the entire Deathwing force will teleport into battle simultaneously to shoot and then charge the enemy.  The Ravenwing is composed entirely of fast units, ranging from bikes to hover crafts to atmospheric fighters.  Being the hunters, they hit fast and hit hard.  Being C:DA, they have special formations, units, and weapons that are not available to C:SM.  C:SW gave up on the idea of bikes all together, and these viking-esk MEQs ride Thunderwolves into battle while C:GK uses personal teleporters to shunt the massive Dreadknight into the fray.  For the Beginner  Because of the toughness and armor of MEQs, they are one of the more forgiving armies.  The reason that so many people enjoy playing against MEQs is because of that fact.  When the dice go south, the game does not end in a slaughter, as MEQs can always fight even when outnumbered and out gunned.  Being T4 with a 3+ armor save allows you to make mistakes, but not lose the game.  It allows for risky plays that other armies cannot attempt for fear of losing.  With a MEQ, the basic Marine can usually take on elites with a fair chance of winning (not that they would want to), a feat that other troops have no hope of doing.  Because of how ubiquitous MEQs are, collecting them is very easy, with collections being sold on eBay constantly.  Between 2nd buys online and people at your LGS, you can usually find MEQ armies for fairly cheap.  However, MEQs are very easy to paint if you buy your minis new.  For some, that still means a terrible paint job, but it doesn't always have to be the case.    Check them out, and don't be too quick to dismiss the possibilities.  They may seem ""boring and monotonous"" at first, but Space Marines are the most customizable force that GW offers in terms of models, colors, and play styles.  TL;DR: Space Marines are pretty cool, I think."
Warhammer40k,3dydo6,_hei,2,Mon Jul 20 16:44:29 2015 UTC,"Hei,  Thanks for the reply!  I was talking about the blue space marines as that is pretty much all I have seem from quick glances.  I honestly think the blood angels look pretty rad as do both the dark angels and wolf guard.  Do you have any advice on army builds/size?  Like I said in my beginning post budget will not be a big issue thus I would like to buy a decent sized army that I would be able to get into games easily.  I am kinda looking forward to painting them.  They are gonna look atrocious but I figure the first army I ever own I should do all the leg work"
Warhammer40k,3dydo6,_hei,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:48:09 2015 UTC,"What are you looking for?  Guns?  Tanks?  Charging into the melee?  The current rule set favors shooting and multiple small units.

I like the bike units for the ravenwing, the terminators also look pretty rad and that ship you linked looked pretty cool.  All of the units looks pretty cool so I'm open to pretty much reading and seeing anything as a build"
Warhammer40k,3dydo6,_hei,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:27:22 2015 UTC,"I'm just starting my first army as Space Marines. I'm going for the Imperial Fists tactics, which makes all my troops wonderfully shoot-y. I'm making a 1000 point list with a Librarian and Tactical Squads in a CAD, with an accompanying Skyhammer Anihilation Force, which is a fantastic way of ferrying your Assault Marines into melee combat and giving them a huge hit in the first round of combat. This should give you a mix of heavy shooting and heavy hitting, if you'd like."
Warhammer40k,3dydo6,Waylander0719,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:17:59 2015 UTC,"Well list construction is not quite the same as team composition in League.  There are some difficulties creating a ""League of Legends style"" list, where you have separate roles that accomplish separate tasks.  Since you are spending points to buy each unit and upgrade, units that synergize with other units increases the effective value of your army.  Instead of having a Support or Tank or ADC, you would bring a unit that can kill tanks and another that can kill infantry; to make sure you don't have all your eggs in one basket, you may also bring a 2nd or 3rd unit that does those things, just in case you lose them early on.  On that note, Ravenwing and Deathwing synergize together extremely well, with each filling gaps in the other while giving bonuses to each other.  However, it is very difficult to build a gun line and having melee elements.  Since you are not allowed to shoot into melees, your gun elements are actually hindered by your melee elements.  Meanwhile, melee elements working outside of a melee list generally lacks the numbers and resources to effectively attack a gun line before they are shot off the table.  Therefore for most armies that have assault elements, you either have singularly strong units (like the Eldar Wraithknight or the Imperial Knight Titan) or they are lists that are designed to bring so many models that enough will make it to the assault (like the Ork hoard).  Mixing and matching generally has less than favorable results."
Warhammer40k,3dydo6,_hei,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:32:43 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply.  Since you say the Ravenwing and Deathwing synergize well together could you help me with a build focusing on shooting?  Also from browsing the store they have a couple ""big bundles"".  Are those a good place to start or would building from the ground up be better?"
Warhammer40k,3dydo6,TheMightyGabriel,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:00:49 2015 UTC,"The bundles tend to be a pretty good deal.  If you are looking to get into the game fresh and are interested in Dark Angels, I would recommend you get the starter kit called Dark Vengeance:  http://www.games-workshop.com/en-US/Dark-Vengeance-EN  It comes with 2 armies, Dark Angels and Chaos Space Marines. You can either keep the 2nd army as a backup/something for a friend to play. Or you can trade it away for more stuff you want.  Most importantly the set comes with a copy of the basic rule book, templates, and dice. All of those are things you would need to buy anyway.  All of the units you get in the set for dark angels are good units/models that you will use. A squad of terminators (usually around $50) a squad of bikes (around $30) a tactical squad (around $40) and 2 HQ (around $20-$30 each)  The rule book it self is worth about $50 and the templates are around $10.  This makes the dark angels part alone worth around $200 for only $110 and you get all the chaos stuff on top of it to trade/use.  You will also want to pickup a Dark Angels codex separately and download an app called BattleScribe to your phone (amazing for list building and free!)"
Warhammer40k,3dydo6,Paladin327,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:46:54 2015 UTC,"At 1850pts, a DW-centric build would probably involve involve ~20 Terminators, a Dreadnought, and 2 RW Attack Squadrons (6 Bikes, 1 Attack Bike, 1 Land Speeder per squadron).  A RW-centric build would probably involve ~18 Bikes, 3 Attack Bikes, 3 Land Speeders, 1-2 Dark Shrouds, 5-6 RW Black Knights, and ~10 DW Terminators.    But hold on just a minute.  Instead of buying anything right now, you should torrent C:DA and look it over.  If you could get the other ones while you're at it, that would probably be for the better.  When you see some units that you like, something that inspires you, you can start building a list around that.    But not with models.  Take some cereal boxes and cut out circles / rounded rectangles, write things like ""RW Black Knight"" or ""DW Terminator w/ Assault Cannon"" on it, and play a few games.  Of course, this is much easier with a friend, but trust me.  It is so much easier on your wallet.  You need to know exactly what you want before you drop a single dollar, because it is impossible to get refunds in this hobby.  Which upgrades, which unit combinations, which play styles? You will need to be sure you can answer all of those questions with certainty or you may end up regretting your purchases.   I could just give you my lists and say ""buy these"", but what if you actually like another codex more?  You cannot take that risk.  I know I spent a lot of time talking about how cool MEQs are, but this game is extremely diverse.  I think you should explore how they play on the table before committing.  A good points value to start at is 500-750pts, but even then that is well over $250USD for the models, and another $58 for the codex.  Check out some battle reports to get some more exposure to the game if you can't / don't want to get to your LGS."
Warhammer40k,3dydo6,jlosowski,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:06:31 2015 UTC,"The Space Marines are indeed very customizable. For my part, I paint my guys Troll Slayer Orange with a bit of Black and Yellow, and play them as Blood Angels. They are a Fast moving Space Marine codex with hard hitting melee units. I baptized them ""Phoenix Wings"", yet my friend calls them the ""Magma soldiers"" or ""Halloween marines"" because of the color scheme ^ I just wanted to do my own thing, and even though I'm not the best painter (you see some cray cray shiet in this subreddit!), they look good and unique when together on the board!  All in all, Space Marines leave you a lot of choices and are a lot of fun to play. They are versatile, reliable, solid and pretty cool looking. My heart goes with Blood Angels because of the Fast + Melee component, but I advise you to check out the Space Marine vanilla codex, as well as Space Wolves/Dark Angels in order to get a good grasp of the different playstyles regarding Space Marines!"

Warhammer40k,3dxtft,CptGurrash,6,Mon Jul 20 12:32:26 2015 UTC,"I think Tyranids will have some issues if they want to play a big bugs list, since all of their MC's have more than 3W I believe.  If someone wants to play Nids because of the MC's, I don't think they will have a great time.   My local shop hosted a narrative campaign without restrictions once.  Some of armies got pretty cheesy with fliers and such, but it wasn't terrible for most.  At the moment, I feel like anything short of a super heavy / lord of war is pretty balanced and casual.  But that's just my opinion.   I think your game might be scaling too quickly.  For newer players, even 200pts can feel like a lot of models.  Think of a game like chess, where you start with 16.  For most people, that's a large number of things to keep track of, and now they have 20 or 30 models?  All with different rules?  I feel like games over 1500 might be overwhelming just by the sheer number of different units.  Another narrative campaign my LGS did involved 500pts battle forged armies at the start, then grew by 250pts every two weeks.  It felt pretty good IMO, and had no restrictions.  You take what you want and build what you want, and most people built and played what they thought was really cool.  Terminators, Thunderwolves, you name it.  If it looks awesome, someone had a unit of it by the end."
Warhammer40k,3dxtft,_hei,3,Mon Jul 20 12:56:12 2015 UTC,"Hey man, thanks for the quick reply!  The nids concern me most, especially as the player in one of the newest.  We have relaxed the wounds rule for this force as it seemed overly punitive for them.  Honestly hadn't thought about scaling up to much, part of the 250 to 500 to 750 was to allow people to start fielding their bigger units, ie tanks, big monstrous creatures and the like."
Warhammer40k,3dxtft,_hei,3,Mon Jul 20 13:06:10 2015 UTC,"So who exactly is this group comprised of?  A squad of veteran players mixed in with a lot of newbies?  If you're concerned about the Vets creating really cheesy lists to stomp the newbies, you could do a list review system, where lists must be approved by some admin (like yourself) before it can be used in the league.  If you see someone bringing 3 Riptides at 750pts, you can give him a slap on the wrist and make him rewrite.  Anyone that can write and play a competitive list should be able to write and play a casual one.  Meanwhile if you're concerned about newbies creating cheesy lists, I don't think that would be too big of an issue.  With the same list review idea, you could see that one guy is bringing MC's or another is bringing AV14, so you can let everyone else in the group know that they should be able to handle MC's or AV14.  That way, you can let the newbies play whatever it is that their hearts desire without having match ups where the opponent has no answers and gets stomped.  On a side note, I don't think fliers fit here as a unit type that needs to be countered or banned.  From my experience, fliers are irritating, but not something that most lists (even at 1850) can effectively deal with without fielding their own.  So unless someone is spamming Heldrakes or bringing the Stormwing formation, I think fliers should be fair game.  I'm not sure how you plan on scaling up.  If you don't want units to be more than 200pts, what do you do with the leftover 50pts (assuming +250pts per upscale)?  Would you be expecting the newbies to be buying these models and building them throughout the campaign?  I started this game in 2012, and it wasn't until last year did I have a fully assembled and painted 1850 force.  Since I'm a student at university, I couldn't (and still can't) afford to be buying 1-2 sets every few weeks.  I'm sure people just getting into the hobby would probably feel the same way."
Warhammer40k,3dxtft,_hei,2,Mon Jul 20 13:54:04 2015 UTC,"Pretty much, a few of us are older players with 3 newbies to wargaming in general.  The cost is a concern, the group however comprises of people with enough disposable income to cover it, the idea would be the points would increase each month or so.  From talking to people planning their armies that are looking at using the upgrades as a change to play the restricted units, bringing in tanks etc.  One of the main reasons for the restrictions was to not penalise players for not thinking of a counter, or for planning to counter something then it not showing up.  For example someone talking AA weapons and then no fliers being present, therefore wasting their points effectively.  If that makes sense?"
Warhammer40k,3dxtft,RyzinUp,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:57:41 2015 UTC,"I see.  You could try a lot of different things to try to keep it fair without removing the things that people want to play.  For example, you could implement a limited force org chart that everyone has to use.  500pts: 1HQ, 2Troops.   That will keep people from taking minimal squads of troops to take something cheesy.  750pts: Add 1Elite, 1 Fast Attack, and 1 Heavy, but you can only take one.  This will keep the lists troop-centric, and allow for players to explore any of their available unit selections.  Tactically, Tau would want to field Crisis Suits due to their (statistically) higher damage output than a Riptide; but if someone really wants to field a Riptide, they still can.  But they can only field one, without Markerlight support, and without additional support from the likes of a Broadside team.  Other options may be to give out some special rules based upon objectives (like the mysterious objectives).  All relics and the Emperor's Will objectives can have the Skyfire Nexus type, for example, so it won't have an effect on most games, but prevents flier spam (assuming you have some sort of heavy weapon).    I think as long as the veteran players are not building anything too min-max or cheesy, it should be ok.  It is possible for you to waste points (even at 1850) on contingencies that weren't needed.  However, I would argue that this is a part of the list building process, and something that makes better list builders and players.  It would probably be beneficial for the newbies if you talked to them about their lists before they committed to anything; talk about what they want, and you can talk about how impactful you think it will be, and help them cover the important bases (anti MEQ, TEQ, GEQ, tank, MCs, psyker, flier).  To this day, I do not field any anti-air, because I believe fliers to be a negligible part of the game.  Through the flier spam of 6e, I have come to the opinion that fliers cost too much for what they bring (especially after the ""no charge after swooping"" nerf on FMCs).  Therefore, I intentionally do not cover the ""fliers"" base so I can take the points and put more emphasis on MEQs, tanks, superheavies, MCs, and GMC (the meta at my LGS)."
Warhammer40k,3dxtft,pertante,4,Tue Jul 21 16:53:42 2015 UTC,"Some of the restrictions seem OK for 500 points but absolutely stupid for 2000 points. No 2+ armour saves so no terminators. No wolf lords on thunderwolves, no iron priests, no Njal Stormcaller, no Bjorn the Fell handed, no Arjac, no thunderwolf cavalry (try keeping those under 200 points lmao) etc etc etc. That doesnt hamper necrons eldar skitarii or tyrannids one bit. Skitarii can still spam 100 point vanguard troops that fire 30 shots at BS 7, but if the tau player wants to bring a riptide to a 2000 point game tough luck buddy? Even as an intro army thunder hammer stormshield terminators are a staple of any space wolf army!  As a skitarii player if you go though this cool, you have a 2000 point skitarii army at the end which is all useable in the future with decent units. Same for necrons eldar and Daemonkin. As a space wolves player you are forced to buy 2000 points of wierd models you probably wouldnt want to use later on."

At 750 we are lifting all rules except ban on flyers At the next  round after that no restrictions will be in force  As we are expanding our armies it will limit our abilities to just go out and redo the entire force in one go, in effect our armies will expand while retaining the same units and playstyle from the first rounds (plus it allows us to somewhat predict/control what gets added.)"
Warhammer40k,3dxtft,pertante,3,Tue Jul 21 05:50:45 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure why you'd want any of the special restrictions about armor saves/wounds/av/fliers, especially above 750 or so. Really banning or restricting superheavies is probably enough but even they certainly have a place in 2000pts. For the most part these things work best if you just provide a general theme to the games to be played. If you're concerned about ""that guy"" kind of lists, just tell people to be newbie friendly, fun casual lists."

We just scaled up from 500 to 750 and we're going 1000, 1250, 1500, 1750, 2k. This is probably a little slow, I'd go 500-1000-1500-1850-2000, to give a little more time to the 1500-2000 level where most games are played.  I think the tyranid army should be pretty competitive, the power dynamic changes at lower point levels, and armies with cheaper units are surprisingly effective. Probably the toughest opponent in our local at this level is an ork player, just because he can bring so much stuff.  We are also playing on smaller boards at the lower levels, 4x4 boards up until we get over 1000."

Warhammer40k,3dyuxj,zekapitalist,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:55:40 2015 UTC,I use vellagio airbrush sealer. I think anything is fine as long as is matte and not gloss. Be weary about using too much as frosting can occur (also if there's high humidity on the day). Ive always found that it doesn't require very much at all to form a good sleal.  Always test a new product on one (hopefully disposable) model to ensure that your not going to get frosting in your climate before moving on to the rest of the squad.
Warhammer40k,3dxpn5,greystuff,7,Mon Jul 20 11:56:32 2015 UTC,"Markerlights are a must have. Either through Pathfinders or Drone squadrons. Because of this, you won't really have the room for much else in Fast Attack, so you'll avoid the ""worse"" units because they're also all Fast Attack. (I don't think they're all that bad of units, its just that Markerlights are so necessary.)

If you're up against an assault-based army (orks, nids, daemons, some space marines) and they make it into assault with you, you're going to die. Supporting Fire helps make that not happen as easily, but it can still happen. Uhm. Because your weakest gun is still strength 5 you can take out monstrous creatures up to T8 and vehicles up to AV11 using only Fire Warriors / Burst Cannons, and its a glorious feeling, although its going to take a lot of fire power. Otherwise, you have the strength to take out most anything, but you're on the fragile side. Yeah, you have a lot of 2+ armor on the larger suits, but the game is full of AP2."

Their biggest downfall is that they don't have the most durable infantry, and they're not very good in the assault phase either.

This of course doesn't help you till at minimum turn 2 after your guys are airborne  Helldrake's vector strike is super tasty as well, but again earliest your gonna get it is turn 2.   Another option is Aegis line with Quad gun, throw a Demon prince on the Quad for lulz.  If you run a horde type setup such as cultist spam and block yourself in correctly, you can deny them deepstrike into your unprotected zones.   Another option is to keep as much as possible in reserve then spread out the remainder across the board in such a way that it cannot all be killed in a single alpha strike. This allows you to deliver a serious counter punch on your turn, but if your reserves don't show your in trouble, and even if they do the lack of assault from DS is gonna suck.  Another option is to run a summon heavy list and spam a bunch of free trash troops to eat up the initial punch in the face"

Warhammer40k,3dwpyh,DarkApostle0_o,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:51:24 2015 UTC,ABSOLUTELY you can play with just a small group of friends at home. we generally recommend 3 players so you can have a few different factions.   This is all about bringing gamers from across the world together sorry if the title came off a sales pitchy lol. im just really excited to have so many players before the launch of this years campaign.  we have a special narrative detachment for combat patrol which isnt exactly kill teams but its meant for small games. You could always report the results of your kill team game as a standard game if that is all the models you have.
Warhammer40k,3dwpyh,DarkApostle0_o,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:53:07 2015 UTC,Awesome! I'm glad you guys are making this open to everyone. We will definitely be joining!

Warhammer40k,3dwpyh,DarkApostle0_o,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:45:12 2015 UTC,As a chaos player you have a couple of factions available to you.   Cult of the Old Ones - trying to enact a dark ritual to resurrect a long dead chaos god.  Rouges & Corsairs - Pirates that have arrived to plunder the worlds while everyone is to busy fighting each other to stop them.
Warhammer40k,3dwpyh,nechoha,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:54:08 2015 UTC,Well if course cult of the old ones. I'd there a war master yet for chaos? I briefly read the rules so if I'm wrong correct me
Warhammer40k,3dwpyh,nechoha,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:17:14 2015 UTC,The Warmaster for the Cult of the Old Ones is another chaos player.  when you register you'll be sent invites to a general campaign FB page and a Faction specific FB Page that way you can organize with the rest of your Faction.

On top of having a 5+ invuln and t3 makes them likely to get shot off the board.   Granted, I like the Sicarians from Skitarii who are terribley priced for what they do and how much punishment they can take is similary to priests. The Priests are much like the Sicarians in that one form of them can shoot and charge, while the others can just do melee, but can do some serious damage in melee.

Warhammer40k,3dw78t,TheMightyGabriel,4,Mon Jul 20 01:18:34 2015 UTC,"1 - Units can only disembark off a vehicle if it has moved 6"" or less. That also counts for fast vehicles? My Blood Angels Tactical Squad aren't allowed to disembark after my Fast Rhino has moved 12"" (not moving flat out)?    Correct   2 - What does a ""dedicated transport"" actually mean? Does it mean that the vehicle does not count as a Fast attack/Heavy Support choice as it is attached to a squad?   a dedecated transport is a transport taken by a unit and takes up no force org slot, and changes its battlefield role to whatever bought the transport for. I. E. A rhino taken by a tactical squad counts as troops. Only the unit that bought the transport can start the game in the transport (independant characters attached to the unit can ride too)   3 - Can I move 6"" with a squad, embark (within 6"" of the vehicle) move my Fast vehicle 12"", and make my Rapidfire plasma gun shoot? Or can only one between the squad and the vehicle move?   Both units are seperate and can act seperately and embarking does not prevent a vehicle from moving it's full distance. After 6 inches of movement, anyone firing out of a transport can only fire snapshots   How many weapons with normal BS can my Fast Predator fire if he has moved 3""? 6""? 12""?   2 in all situations, will look it up when i get a glance at my brb   5 - How does disembarking work for a flying zooming unit? Do I have to start hovering, move up to 6"", then disembark? Can I do that all on the same turn?   Unless the flyer has a special rule allowing you to do so, you cant disembark from a zooming flyer, so you change flight modes to hover, move up to 6"" and disembark   6 - If my squad loses one too many man during assault phase, and ultimately is out of range to charge because of that newly lost man - is the charge cancelled   If you lose models to overwatch are that causes you to be out of range, yes, you cannot charge"

Warhammer40k,3dw78t,Ze_German_Guy,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:08:47 2015 UTC,"That is correct, if the vehicle moves more than 6"" passengers can only fire snap shots. Being fast does not change that.   Note that for question 5 you can also disembark first and then move the flyer up to 12"" since the 6"" restriction only applies if you disembark after moving. The flyer would still be in hover mode though so no disembarking and moving 36"".   IMO the best advice for new players is to never think of the rules in terms of what makes sense/works in real life/works in the fluff.   Just two examples:     It would make sense that a fast transport vehicle, moving stable enough to shoot two guns at full BS itself, would allow passengers to shoot at full BS or at least only counting as having moved. However, the rules do not permit that.   It doesn't make sense that a jinking skimmer that moved up to 6"" only makes the passengers shoot as if they have moved since the vehicle is literally bouncing around enough to throw of enemy targeting computers and can't even get accurate shots of itself. However, the rules do allow that."

Warhammer40k,3dwyn0,elxox,2,Mon Jul 20 05:42:43 2015 UTC,"You re-primed them? Did you strip off the paint first?  Theres no such thing as an easy color scheme that looks really good. The most basic paintjob will look terrible if you don't follow some fundamentals. Once you got those nailed down you can decide on the complexity of the paintjob, I.e. how many steps with what level of detail do you want to paint.   Before you do anything sit down and watch like 5 painting guides on the GW YouTube channel. The models really don't matter but make sure you watch at least 2 where they paint something big. These videos really cover 95% of the fundamentals that you need to literally paint to box art standard. There is no magic, no secret stuff, just some really easy to follow steps.  When you feel comfortable on those steps have a look at the dark eldar codex and \ or the very good dark eldar painting guide. This should give you an idea of how an army could look like.  There are two basic approaches to Dark Eldar:  The first is to basecoat them in a color of your choice and add multiple ""edge highlights"" to give them definition. Example: http://m.imgur.com/a/7yO9T This method is quite work intensive but is in the end just as easy or difficult as any other paint job   The second is to basecoat them silver and then wash them with a shade of your choice (green, purple or blue looks good). Then you finish them off with only a single edge highlight of bright silver. Example:http://m.imgur.com/a/2kTIV This method takes less time but isn't any easier. You'll have to draw straight lines just the same. In the end it also doesn't look as impressive as a model with 3 edge highlight layers.  But again, before you do anything you should sit on your ass for at least 1 hour and watch those GW videos."

I didnt strip the paint, it was really thinned though, so i hope it wont be too bad, doesnt seem to have lost detail. I think my main trouble is more that i dont have a good colour scheme that im really happy with at the moment and until i do, probably wont get what im after. thanks for the response, ill do this process and see how i go! :)"
Warhammer40k,3dwyn0,LostBaconSandwich,1 point,Mon Jul 20 07:02:39 2015 UTC,"I started by painting everything metallic blue, then I added some silver on things like thrusters and things I wanted gold in the future. I added some gold. then I started working on flesh... it's simple and looks good. worry about the big stuff first. save the detail work for when you learn to paint."
Warhammer40k,3dtj5a,Muu83,8,Sun Jul 19 08:46:34 2015 UTC,"I think another problem might be that the functional eye is a bit too open, if that makes sense.   You can maybe try give the scarred eye a light grey pupil, give it a blind effect."

Warhammer40k,3dtj5a,ripinpeppers,5,Sun Jul 19 17:31:16 2015 UTC,"I dont. I never paint eyes on infantry sized models; I just paint the skin of the face and eyebrows, so when you're looking at something on the table you can't tell that the eyes aren't painted like so. If I do paint the eyes, its something like Grimgor where they don't have pupils.   For people that have the steady hand to paint pupils, the trick is to not have the black of the pupil surrounded by white. That is what gives it the googlie-eyed look. If you look at the 'Eavy Metal Marneus Calgar, its a line of white with a dot of black in the middle, but no white on the top or bottom of the pupil to give it the Steve Buscemi treatment"
Warhammer40k,3dtj5a,ripinpeppers,2,Sun Jul 19 17:55:41 2015 UTC,Thanks for the reply. So a thinner eye with a line of black for the pupil rather than a dot. Am I getting that right?

Warhammer40k,3dtj5a,bobbothegobbo,3,Sun Jul 19 09:20:43 2015 UTC,A fine line of purplish red. Then a finer line down the middle of that with a lighter shade of the previous colour.

Instead, I paint the skin a flesh tone either go over it with a light brown wash or shade, then go over just the eyes with a black wash or shade."

Warhammer40k,3dswqy,Keeweegle,4,Sun Jul 19 16:47:06 2015 UTC,Can you do a step by step of how you did that? I would love to try it out as I think it looks great
Warhammer40k,3dswqy,Keeweegle,1 point,Sun Jul 19 08:47:56 2015 UTC,"Sure, I can do a quick synopsis for right now at least:  In this case the oxidization was basically the last step, other than eyes and touching up the chest emblem.  Before I added any of the turquoise, I painted the mini like normal: a base coat, with copper on larger body pieces, and iron/steel in the joints and ""connector"" type sections.  Then just a thin, dark wash to add a bit of depth/shading quickly.  I actually did very selectively dry brush on a brighter copper and steel after the wash. I'm not certain how much of this would even be detectable after adding the oxide, or how much was completely lost. I'll probably end up still doing this on other models, since the oxide layer is more or less a very thinned down turquoise. I think it probably shows through at least a little bit.  For the oxide layer, I used the Citadel Nihilakh Oxide paint straight from the bottle, but I imagine it would be fairly easy to mix up something of your own. You may want to get a pre-mixed turquoise(as for whatever reason, turquoise seems to be very difficult to color-mix...), and possibly add just a touch of green until you get the shade you want. Then you'd just want to add water until you get a very runny consistency, and possibly even a drop or two of alcohol--this can help ""liven"" it up a bit, and sometimes help with it collecting in crevices, where it would naturally gather. You'd want to test that out first though. :P  To test it out, something cheap and easy with lots of texture might be just wood chips, like the type that seem to be in lots of kids' playgrounds nowadays? Anything that has lots of little crevices to see how the paint acts. Just prime up a few pieces and give 'em a go.  Anyway, as far as how I applied it to the model, I used a pretty small detail brush, but that's not really necessary. I did go one section at a time, with some little paper towel scraps nearby. I'd paint up a section, make sure it's totally covered, and in all the crevices, and if there was too much in a crevice just use a paper towel scrap to soak a little up. I usually blotted the larger flat surfaces a little as well, so the underlying color could show through.  After the oxide layer, just little touch ups where necessary, the eyes, the chest emblem, and then on the gun a bit as well, where the oxide ran on to the black surfaces a bit.  It would be possible to go over with some light dry brushing on ridges/wherever to brighten things up a bit at this point, if you wanted to, but I didn't in this case. Just depends on what type of look you're going for.  ...That was a bit longer than I intended, but oh well! Hope that helps, I'm by no means an expert, this is literally the first model I've painted, but if you have any questions on how I got it to look like that, let me know!"
Warhammer40k,3dswqy,m15wallis,3,Sun Jul 19 16:16:20 2015 UTC,"I'm not sold on how I ended up doing the purple tube, and the photo seemed to make it look like there was way more oxidization than there is in reality, but I'm still pretty happy with it overall.

Warhammer40k,3dswqy,EyeBrowseSickStuff,3,Sun Jul 19 03:36:32 2015 UTC,depending on the size of the tubes you should have a few options

Warhammer40k,3dswqy,Daevram,3,Sun Jul 19 15:26:04 2015 UTC,Gotta agree with the rest. Love the oxidization look but the purple just doesn't really fit to me. I'm wondering if you could do the blaster with a red tube but continue the oxidization along the tube ends where it connects to the gun?
Warhammer40k,3dswqy,DJLobo76,2,Sun Jul 19 04:00:56 2015 UTC,Thanks for the feedback! Do you mean to have the oxidization run on to the transparent acrylic type tube?

Warhammer40k,3due53,WizardsMyName,2,Sun Jul 19 16:04:23 2015 UTC,I agree.  The deal with submunitions (imo) is that Tau has access to Ion large blasts which are much better S and AP relative to the the Railgun submunition.
Warhammer40k,3due53,_hei,2,Sun Jul 19 17:37:28 2015 UTC,"...unless you're facing off against guard, in which case S6 AP4 is more than good enough and why risk gets hot! and give up the railgun etc.  Should be fairly obvious which to take and when IMO."
Warhammer40k,3due53,WizardsMyName,2,Sun Jul 19 20:17:21 2015 UTC,"Well, yea.  But I was thinking of it more as a theory-based ""better"" build, where you're not tailoring a list based upon who you play.  If you want large blasts, you should prefer Ion over Rail because it can cover more bases; if you are not building for large blasts, then you can go for Rail and take submunitions if you have the points because it would be nice to have.  IMO Railheads are pretty ineffective for their points cost anyways, since they either have a lackluster S6 AP4 large blast that doesn't ignore cover or a single S10 AP1 shot that still only hits on 3's and pens AV14 on 5's.  So besides the fact that I think they look dope (like Railsides), I don't think they really bring much to the army."
Warhammer40k,3due53,_hei,2,Sun Jul 19 20:53:50 2015 UTC,It doesn't have ignores cover however that's why you have markerlights. And if you upgrade to have Longstrike you reap through enemy tanks. I usually use the Ion Cannon however when I do use the Rail gun it's to eliminate enemy transports quickly. Add into the fact that it can jink and then use markerlights to bring it back to 3+ or even 2+ to hit with AV13 and a 3+ cover save it's a pain for your opponents to take out

Warhammer40k,3due53,_hei,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:09:50 2015 UTC,Unless using Longstrike yes I fully agree Ion Cannons are far more useful as it covers plenty of bases. Especially with a Riptide to take care of TEQs. Pie plates FTW
Warhammer40k,3due53,Wootster10,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:11:37 2015 UTC,"I'd agree with you, which is why we have a couple of house rules affecting the railhead and some of the other big anti-tank guns. Decided that the Vanquisher, Railgun, and Bastion-breacher shells in a Medusa all remove an extra hull point when a penetrating hit is scored. Mostly because those were the ones we have about, and we felt that tanks get a shitty deal in 40k with all the melta, StrD etc"
Warhammer40k,3due53,WizardsMyName,3,Sun Jul 19 21:12:12 2015 UTC,"It certainly is worth taking, but sometimes you really do need those 5pts."
Warhammer40k,3due53,Anggul,3,Sun Jul 19 17:57:49 2015 UTC,"If yes, why would you ever NOT take submunition rounds, seeing how they are so cheap?   The same reason I don't stick teleport homers, melta bombs, and auspexes on every single guy I can or extra armour on all vehicles; each one is relatively cheap but the overall cost adds up quickly."
Warhammer40k,3due53,Ze_German_Guy,2,Sun Jul 19 18:10:50 2015 UTC,"IMHO, it's so that you'll take the railgun (the tau's signature weapon) instead of the ion cannon.   See, the ion cannon has two different weapon profiles, one for 3 heavy shots, the other for a large blast.   If the railgun didn't have similar versatility, you'd probably always take the ion cannon."
Warhammer40k,3due53,sloth788,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:09:23 2015 UTC,"I do not buy submunitions because I am strange and I play in strange ways.  My Railhead is actually run as something I like to call the 'Trollhead'  It will jink every turn with a disruption pod for a 3+ save, it will move 12 inches through walls like a crack head Kool-aid man because of sensor spines.  So it will always snap shot, and you can't use a blast when snapping shots.  But, it will hit on 2+ because I run a crap fuck ton of marker lights (something like 20-40 depending on the list).  I have found it to be an excellent distraction carnifex.  Also, I never target heavy armor with a Railhead unless I have nothing better to shoot at.  I use Railheads to target transports.  Since transports cap out at armor 12, (minus super heavies, land raiders and the supressor) Rail heads tend to be very good at forcing your opponent to foot slog from turn 1.  Armor 13 and up is for the stealth suit fusion blasters."

However, GW does make insane decisions quite often:S For me personally, I hope the messy anarchy of 7th edition continues for at least 2 more years.

Warhammer40k,3duvxo,da_main_man,5,Sun Jul 19 18:32:18 2015 UTC,"Okay. I play chaos marines, daemons, and khorne. love all three armies. if you too, love the ruinous powers then you need to start with an army list. you have four options   chaos space marines chaos daemons renegades and heretics (from imperial armor 13) khorne daemonkin.   the stuff from dark vengeance is enough to play either a khorne or csm army. if you're thinking of playing chaos for fun- there is arguably no codex more enjoyable than khorne daemonkin. the way it works is you kill things. as you kill units, win/lose challenges, and lose units, you get bonuses- a blessing from the blood god. this could be anything from army-wide rage and furious charge to a free bloodthirster! so if you already have the marines and you want khorne daemonkin- then you should go buy some daemons that you can use as the bonuses. this includes:   bloodletters flesh hounds bloodcrushers skull cannon daemon prince bloodthirster   my personal recommendation is the skull cannon because none of your units can charge on the turn it arrives. so your free unit always has to stand around for a turn before it decides to do anything. the skull cannon can at least shoot something.  if you are not a fan of blood and gore but still want to use your chaos marines, then fear not! chaos space marines is available. the problem is that this army suffers from being outdated and overpriced for what it can do. however! in my experience, there are two viable chaos marine builds. the first is the helbrute star. you'll need five of these badboys to make the helfist murderpack formation from the helbrute dataslate. then add bel'akor. have the helbrutes walk forward while belakor casts invisibility and put on your troll face as the opponent is unable to kill helbrutes- an otherwise lackluster model. the other build I've seen centers around a brass scorpion. this lord of war puts out a terrifying amount of firepower. just bring your favorite marines along for the ride and try to cover the brass scorpion so it can kill everything in its path.  if you like cheese, then chaos daemons are where its at. currently ranked as a top five army on www.torrentoffire.com, they excel at the psychic and assault phases. wish you had more points? just have your psyker of choice summon virtually any unit for free! want a hard-to-kill unit? have a daemon prince take the grimoire of true names and follow kairos fateweaver around so that he can have a 2++ re-rollable save! do you like fast-moving units? screamers and plague drones are the kings of getting to objectives and scoring points. do you like air support? a daemon CAD can have up to five flying monstrous creatures. do you like beam attacks? slaanesh psyckers have a powerful beam attack as a primaris and kairos fateweaver always knows one too!  finally, the renegade army. ive never actually played with or against one of these, but its basically all the astra militarum units with chaos upgrades. your cultists can be proxied as command squads and infantry squads so you already have the troop and hq slots filled.  im glad to see another player consider chaos! i've played several other codexes but these armies are all my favorites. my current go-to army is khorne daemonkin. if im playing in a tournament, i bring daemon allies for that extra bit of oompf. however, i guarantee that you will have a good time with any of these codexes  good luck heretic!"

Best advice I can give is to ditch the chosen as fast as possible, or proxy them as regular marines. Also you should decide you want an army dedicated to a specific god or want a bit of everything. That has an impact on how you should proceed with your list building."

I usually always run a nurgle list, cause thats how everyone is painted and i think its the sweetest.  Nurgle lord to unlock plague marines as troops, and then to follow up plague marines as troops obviously.  Usually in rhinos, 7-8 strong, with meltas normally cause my meta is lots of tanks.  Then as many obliterators as my list can fit, usually 9 if i can.  They are always the allstars of the game, i really couldn't imagine playing without them.  Heldrakes are also lots of fun, they used to be insane, now they are just plain good models to have.  Cultists are good to have for objective based games, or sitting them on a quad gun behind an ADL.  Havoks are sweet behind an ADL aswell with the champion using the quad gun, it's pretty sweet.  Chaos bikes can also be fun, if you have room for them.  T6 on a bike is pretty tough to deal with.  Some models that i don't often run but are also good are straight up marines.  They are cheap and versatile.  Noise marines are also really great but don't fit into my playstyle at all."

I did post him on my local gaming groups facebook page though and people seemed to love it. It even got a discussion going whether it would be cooler as some kind of terminator armoured captain or as someone in artificer armour. If you keep your model WYSIWYG and on the correct base only the neckbeardiest of neckbeards will complain (and trust me, you wouldnt want to play that guy anyway)  Dont be lazy with the conversion though. Add a space marine helmet, greenstuff a cloak for him if he is a terminator or give him a backpack if he is in artificer armour, file off the sigmar hammer from his shield, add some purity seals, give him some space marine weapons etc etc. Takes some work but people will really appreciate it :)"

Warhammer40k,3dubsv,_hei,3,Sun Jul 19 15:40:09 2015 UTC,"Typically, yes. Look out sir rolls can be made on a 2+ for independant characters (IE Draigo) and 4+ on characters (IE Sergeants) so that another model in close proximity to the character takes the hit. If no model is in proximity no LOS rolls can be made (obviously)."
Warhammer40k,3dubsv,HiddenRed,3,Sun Jul 19 15:41:00 2015 UTC,Thanks everyone. So I'm wondering if sticking your 3++ save characters in front to shield everyone could be a beneficial tactic.
Warhammer40k,3dubsv,Ackoogin,4,Sun Jul 19 15:55:32 2015 UTC,That is a legit/normal use for Draigo. Look out sir the non ap2 wounds to other guys as appropriate.
Warhammer40k,3dubsv,Space_Plans,2,Sun Jul 19 16:22:43 2015 UTC,yep. Draigo is a tank! This is also due to having eternal warrior. He can't get doubled out by one krak missile and removed. So he can just absorb lots of fire for whatever squad he's with.
Warhammer40k,3dubsv,mrsc0tty,3,Sun Jul 19 17:19:48 2015 UTC,"Yeah- but remember that hits go against majority toughness of the unit. So if Draigo was, I dunno, T6 joining a unit of T4 marines you would wound against T4. (Disclaimer, I have no clue what his stats are)"

I've seen DE do some cool stuff, but they're a harder army to pick up and learn.  Space Marines have a lot of cool toys (C:SM and C:DA, the two newest ones), so if you're into Space Marines that wouldn't be a bad way to go.  But I cannot stress enough that you shouldn't play this game to win.  The strength of armies fluctuate over the years and you're going to be spending so much time and money, you need to like the way your models look and the way your army plays.  I spent the last 3 years playing the most underpowered army in the 'verse, and now it is considered to be highly competitive.  You don't think it'll happen to you, but it will.  So if you like the way DE looks and plays, go for it.  No one should be able to stop you.  However, Space Marines are also extremely solid right now, and much easier to learn, paint, and collect.

They offer a bunch of different playstyles which is great too. Plus their models are probably some of the best looking in the entire 40k range.  If you want a solid DE force a good place to start is grab a single 10 point Lhamean as your HQ and stick him in a venom. Then for your troops get a bunch of kabalite warriors and stick them in raiders and venoms. This will roughly form the core of your army.  After that theres tons of stuff you can take. Razorwing jetfighters, scourges with haywire, several haemonculus covens formations (corpsethief claw, dark artisan, etc), reaver jetbikes, ...  Dark Eldar are not an easy to learn faceroll army but can do very well in the current game as they are really good at grabbing objectives with their amazing mobility. You can go full glass cannon and spam billions of poison shots with weaker units, or you can go with the supplement and be surprisingly tough to remove from the table. Expect to lose a bit at first as your army requires more tactical thinking than lets say space marines but once you start learning you will start kicking some butt :)"

Just regular people with regular equipment holding the line against a galaxy that pulls no punches in hurting you as brutally as possible. That humanity also allows for more interesting characters too, I think.

Warhammer40k,3dt9k8,sakasama_bridge,5,Sun Jul 19 08:46:56 2015 UTC,"Agree with the others on the human dimension. Some of the most memorable moments for me have been when the puny human beats the odds - my favourite from recent times was a solitary sergeant with the standard laspistol and chainsword knocking the final wound off a trygon in close combat.  Another factor that appeals to me, and I'm sure applies to a lot of other IG players, is that they tie in with a mix of pop culture and historical characters or armies. The idea of having rules for a miniature version of Rambo in 40k taps into my love of the movies (well, tapped - still mad that Marbo got dropped from the latest edition of the codex), and I love Praetorians because what fan of Zulu wouldn't love the idea of fielding the 24th of Foot in the 41st Millenium? Especially with Victoria Miniatures' Captain Caine sculpt at the forefront. If not that, then how about recreating this scene from Admiral with a bunch of Valhallans?  Besides that, there are plenty of military history buffs that like recreating real-life units and regiments. For some people, I guess that 40k is the next step from building models of WW2 tanks.  To sum up: if you love war movies and/or military history, IG will likely be up your street."

And also, as others have said; Guard are the major underdogs; having some of the most basic troops and weakest equipment for said troops in the game; but it's the sheer amount they can field, almost following the Ork philosophy of ""MOAR DAKKA"" to beat their enemies into a pulp, that just really makes me love them :D"

Also having an army of normal humans facing off against homicidal murder cultists, reality-altering demons, foul aliens, and planet-eating space bugs with little more than a red flashlight, cardboard box flak armor, and faith in the EMPRA is quite bad ass.

From what you're telling us, here is the first thing you're doing wrong: MEGA/NOBZ. There's no way to give (those already expensive) units the support they need at 500 points. You can't do it. Luckily, Daddy Ultiamate knows just what you do need. Throw those nobs in the trash. Burnas too. Completely and utterly useless. GET BOYZ BOYZ AND MORE BOYZ. Throw in a couple boss nobs with power klaws and you're all set. If you wanna take another unit, get 5 lootas. Then just charge. A lot of boys will die and that'll be fine. Your lootas might provide some suppressive fire for them, OR they'll absorb a turns worth of tau volley themselves. That's also fine. Just charge the boyz."

They can't carry the game in larger point games with their mob rule and trukks getting blown up by a weak fart. Ork boyz are awesome in small point games though which it looks like you're doing. Just be aware that orks, and 40k in general peaks at around the 1500-2000pts lvl, its hard to make judgement on an army in 500 pt games.

Warhammer40k,3dtvsw,Iceman0624,2,Sun Jul 19 15:33:01 2015 UTC,I play Orks and Tau as my 2 main armies and I have to say Blitz Brigade is nearly unstoppable for the Tau to reliably do anything about. That much AV14 is a nightmare to shoot through and the best vehicle killers for Tau are Hammerheads (unreliable to one shot a battle wagon) and Fusion Blasters (deep strikes in or gets shot to death turn 1 if deployed on the table). Even losing 2 of the 5 on turn 1 is more than enough boys charging in turn 2 to over run the Tau lines. Mobile Tau lists can't out maneuver scouting battle wagons and even the most dense Tau overwatch fortress can't punch through a wall of boys with a lucky stikk warboss eating all the pulse weapon fire with his 2+ rerollable. Manz missiles are also quite good at soaking up overwatch while killkannons love to blow up clumped Tau. Take advantage of multi charge to grab multiple units into CC. Firewarriors in particular have defense grenades which nullify your extra attack and furious charge plus you consider supporting fire has everyone nearby over watching while Tau is TERRIBLE in CC makes multi charge have almost no down side to it.

Warhammer40k,3dtibw,RedPresident,2,Sun Jul 19 08:32:04 2015 UTC,"I've yet to get some games in with the new codex, but with the re-rolls on jink for Ravenwing, I'm thinking the bikes have survivability now.

You drop in a ton of power armor and two open topped AV12 vehicles in an 1850 game? 1500 game?  Any half thought out list will pop both pods no problem, and kill most of the marines (if not all) with ease.   Why don't you just take Ravenwing?  Unless you are taking the Redemption force, you do not auto arrive from reserves.  However with the Strike force, you can choose for units to arrive on a unit by unit basis as long as you include an offensive Ravenwing detachment.  At T5 4+ rerolling Jink, they are far more survivable than T4 marines, and Summon the Deathwing special rule for Ravenwing Attack squadrons give you 12"" locator beacons for models with the Deathwing special rule.  The Ravenwing were literally designed for the purpose you are talking about.   That's not to say that you can't use the Skyhammer, but theoretically it's a way to table armies quickly with relentless Grav shots and assaults turn 1, not a crutch for another detachment."
Warhammer40k,3dtibw,_hei,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:17:10 2015 UTC,"If you maximize squad size (at least the devastators) so that 30-40 marines are deploying, yeah you are good. I would run 1 unit of devs all gravs, the other with MMeltas. Obviously combat squad them, send the heavies after high priorities, let the marine groups pot shot infantry for shits and giggles. I would optimize devastators for AT work, since deathwing are notoriously bad at AT...Land Raiders aren't scary for you anymore!  Forcing mandatory pinning checks at 3d6 is just wtf levels of awesome. Just be aware of who you are playing against, as fearless or things that are flat out immune to pinning can be pretty common in the right builds.   Chapter tactics are also an area you gotta look at. Ultras looks like the clear cut winners with all their fun doctrines. White Scars might be interesting just for hit and run. Ifists are kinda pointless, cause Ultras cover your 1s in shooting when you doctrine. Iron Hands increases your survivability with army wide +1 FNP rolls, Black  Templars might be an interesting choice and force you to charge at someone not pinned (must get that sweet rage bonus), and if using FW tactics Raptors would be pretty cool as well (Rending Heavy 1 Bolters...that now induce pinning checks. Herp)  But to then field this properly, and also bring a sizeable group of deathwing, we are talking what a 1500 pt game or so? Risky but very entertaining."
Warhammer40k,3drhjo,fuzzypurplesocks,4,Sat Jul 18 19:21:45 2015 UTC,You're gonna want to mix some thinner up with those paints. I love the scheme but it'll look a whole lot smoother once you ditch that brushstroke texture.

You've kept to the ""grain"" of the model instinctively to reduce the effect but you can still see the fine lines of the bristles. You can eliminate that all together with a good thin coat-it also makes painting much faster."

She just layered nuln oil over it and built up successive layers to the front. You can't really thin nuln oil any further but it happens to settle in the tiny grain slightly more and brings out lines"

But overall I really like where your headed with the colors. One last thing I'd recommended is when your trying to highlight the edges is to use the side of your brush with little paint, unless your going for the bigger/thicker lines especially with such a contrast on the dark blue to ice blue.

Warhammer40k,3dsy1c,bigsaks5,4,Sun Jul 19 03:49:08 2015 UTC,"Not the best list for anything besides casual games- Grey Knights are historically weak against massed units, AP 2/1, FMC's, and anti-psykers (Culexus especially), while NDK's can't really handle alpha-strike melta squads... and all of the above things are in the meta right now.  So what have you brought to counter any/all of the above? 27 models, and something like 37 wounds. That ain't enough, especially when entire units of your meagre 27 models can simply be removed via S8 Ap2 weaponry, of which every self-respecting 1850 army nowadays has 5-10 of. Don't take my word for it though, watch what happens to a list similar to yours in today's environment: link.  But hey, you sound like you're all about having fun. And at the end, that's what this game is about- going out there and having a great time, win or lose. Just don't expect to do to well in tournament play with your current list- it needs quite a bit of refinement."
Warhammer40k,3dsy1c,DustToAsh,1 point,Sun Jul 19 07:16:14 2015 UTC,How would you refine it? And yeah I definitely am not trying to run a cheesy 3+ Dreadknight list.
Warhammer40k,3dsy1c,DustToAsh,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:58:44 2015 UTC,"No cheese necessary- just some work.   1st suggestion: I don't really like interceptors- you pay 20 extra points to get a better version of deep strike when compared to a Strike Squad (shunt)- but you lose ObSec... Which is amazing with the NSF Run + Shooting perk for deep strikers on turn one. I'd suggest switching the interceptors out to strike squads and save 40 points. Of course, you now have to roll reserves... but you can't be alpha struck off of the table. This one is player preference.  2nd suggestion: A unit of 5 purifiers (2incinds, hammer) with Coteaz- [245] pts overall, is amazing at dropping deep strikers- Wall of flame + storm bolter overwatch at full BS vs anything, and everything that suddenly appears within 12"" will prevent the NDK's from R.I.P'ing to alpha strikes first turn, thus allowing them to do their job . Hell, you could even throw the squad in a chimera for (55) points more, whilst still using Coteaz as a bubble of protection, and gaining the ability to fire 5/6 of the troops out of the top hatch. This [300] point overall cost would replace the [322] point cost of a termie squad and the secondary Ordo Malleus Inquisitor.  On that note, while the Termie Malleus Inquisitor looks awesome, he's a glass hammer who gets instadeath'd by S6 weaponry- all it takes is a single melta-gun/broadside missile/plasma weapon to one-shot a [119] point model. And you already have hammers- you're playing the most elite fighting force in the game. What you need is utility. Towards this end, I would recommend replacing him with an:  Ordo Hereticus Inquisitor (25) with 3 skulls (9), psyocculum (25), Liber Heresius (15), Grimoire of True Names (5), power armor (8), and power sword (10)  = [97]. Basically, you lose a wrecking ball- but gain one hell of a Swiss army knife. Whatever unit you attach this guy to will become gods among men when facing psykers (BS 10+ Split fire), weak morale (fear), assaulters (counter-attack), trying to alpha strike (scouts), when assaulting (hatred), or when challenging daemons (-5 to their WS,I, & L). For 97 points, you basically get the effects of a Culexus assassin and an unrivaled daemon hunter (attach to terminators with psilencers and use force for even more fun!).  I'd also probably cut a Libby, and instead throw a dreadnought + an ObSec (b/c Coteaz) squad of acolytes and crusaders into the stormraven. The henchmen are a cheap-yet-tough linebreaker/objective unit (4+/3++ for 15 points apiece is awesome), the dreadnought is a semi-disposable meat shield that you assault shooty/melta squads with (and it allows you to get the most awesome out of your Stormraven as possible)."

(so many different options, its really whatever you want to use)  As far as suggestions with what you have..  Death Company w/ 1 of the Dread on that Stormraven.. (I call mine the magic school bus from hell) Lemartes w/ the DC is awesome. So is astorath.  get pods for tacticals.. or rhinos to make them mobile pillboxes  If Sternguard vets (you didnt clarify) put em in a pod, with combi weapons (I prefer melta) for a hardy, shooty squad that can pop something heavy, and be good enough to shoot their way out of a messy situation.. Tycho is one of my fave HQs of all time, I usually throw him in with some Sterns in a pod to claw theyre way out of the enemy backfield..  use everything else as intended.. you got a solid core."

And I'm not offended. I play Black Templars way more than I play my Blood Angels. I was just chiming in because I do play them from time to time :P   I don't take Tycho to win games, I take Tycho cuz I like the character, and he's a shooty HQ.. His CC weapon is fists, at base strength.. but has digital weapons, and mastercrafted. Nothing at all to brag about lol."
Warhammer40k,3dsrfv,_hei,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:45:31 2015 UTC,"Well, I can't tell you how to play your BA, but I can explain what this edition has been like recently and the direction GW is moving with 40k.   Ever since the Necron release, formations have been the focus of the codex.  If you take X, Y, and Z, you get so-and-so bonuses.  For Necrons, it's a 4+ reanimation protocol, move through cover, and relentless.  For Space Marines, it's access to Tactical Doctrines (the ultramarine's chapter tactics of 6e).  For Dark Angels, it's overwatch at full ballistic still.  Both C:SM and C:DA also have Battle Companies (1 captain, 1 chaplain, 6 tactical squads, 2 assault, 2 devastators minimum) to unlock the same bonuses as well as free transports (rhinos, Razorbacks, or drop pods) for the battle company.  Pretty sweet, right?  So all of these new codexes have a lot of ""bonus power"", power that used to be reserved for upgrades that cost a decent number of points.  The idea is that these formations have units that people don't usually use (like Assault Marines in the DA dex) that are weak and count as a ""tax"" for the bonuses that the formations unlock.  It is bringing in a lot of fluffy armies that are also amazingly competitive, but it leaves older codexes in the dust.  In a way, most of 7e has become this formation-abusing game of lots of MSUs and lots of special rules, and you end up having a good points advantage from the get go.    Since most people don't have that many transports, battle companies are not too common in casual play.  The game (IMO) is pretty close to how it was in early 6e.  Lots of shooting, lots of killing happening turns 1-3, and a lot of tabling by turn 4.  The game is still super killy, with some solid meta game.  My local LGS are Knights (imperial and wraith), lots of fliers for Nids and BA, and TWC Space Wolves / Bike assault armies for White Scars and Ravenwing.  Lots of alpha strike turn 1-2, lots of super killy / hard to deathstars."
Warhammer40k,3dsrfv,_hei,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:51:45 2015 UTC,i had seen the new formations with bonus' kind of cool.  based on my models and particular combinations that will flow well under the new rules? should i get another 5 death company?
Warhammer40k,3dsrfv,bobbothegobbo,1 point,Sun Jul 19 04:32:21 2015 UTC,"I honestly can't tell you.  It will depend a lot on your meta, since each store tends to have a slightly different meta game.  If you think a certain unit would be good because of the rules, their looks, or their fluff, I'd say go for it.  This game is about playing what you like, but there are things that you may want to consider of you want to win.   Generally, I think BA are pretty good when it comes to alpha strikes, taking advantage of drop pods and fast vehicles.  But if your LGS favors drawn out games or super tough MC's/walkers, dropping in half your army might just lead to a quick defeat."

Anyway ebay's buyer protection policies are extremely generous.  Also, you don't understand how auctions work. They start low and are bid up until nobody is willing to pay more than the highest bid. You could start it at the price you want to sell at, but you're much less likely to get more than one bid, thereby getting people emotionally invested in the auction and bidding irrationally like they do when it starts low."
Warhammer40k,3ds80a,ozymandias359,6,Sat Jul 18 23:38:52 2015 UTC,"They're definitely ok.  These are old models and assembled, so their value is not the same as a brand new customizable set.

Warhammer40k,3ds80a,_hei,5,Sat Jul 18 23:27:28 2015 UTC,"Legit. Painted models, assembled or mass produced (Dark Vengeance units for example) go for fairly low price, even new.

Warhammer40k,3ds80a,Ankhanu,3,Sat Jul 18 23:27:20 2015 UTC,"I've bought from AA-Wargames a couple times, A+ seller.  Wargaming is pretty much the only thing they do, and they're efficient about it.  The models they're selling are the ones pictured in the specific auction, and there are multiple pictures so you know exactly what you're getting.  You're getting them cheap because they're used, and often have paint on them, which you'll probably have to strip.  It's a fair bit of work, but that's why they're inexpensive :P  If you're unfamiliar with how eBay works, a seller will post an item up for auction, usually at a fairly low price.  Prospective buyers then bid on the item through the bidding period until someone wins out at the end of that time.  Generally, bidders will bring the price up to a normal, competitive level (don't forget to factor in shipping when making your bids!).  In short, these tac squads are not going to sell for a couple euros, they'll probably go home with someone for 10 or so, plus shipping."

It can pressure back lines with its 2 shot battle cannon while holding the front lines with its StrD and stomp attacks.  It will draw fire away from the rest of your army and dish out a lot of hurt if your opponent isn't careful.    This also happens to be the most common variant that I have played against, since the Errant lost its popularity after the vehicle hype died down at my LGS.  I have not played against the new variants, so I cannot speak for their effectiveness (or lack thereof)."
Warhammer40k,3dqm73,_hei,2,Sat Jul 18 16:05:24 2015 UTC,"Hey Tobias, Logistically, the Knight is the easy choice.  One big model vs. another whole army to paint.  Something to consider is if you could add anything to your list to fulfil the role youd have the SMs do.  If its holding objectives or stacking up on your Russes- a cheap infantry platoon works (theres nothing ten space marines can do that 25 guardsmen cant haha.) Or add a Scion Platoon for more durable dakka on the ground. Once thats covered just pick the variant of knight you like.  Having never played with or against a knight i cant speak to their effectiveness. On the otjer hand, ive been playing guard for a while and and im sure you know, sometimes i just want a squad of troops to be able to survive an enemy shooting phase and retain some measure of combat effectiveness.  That said, i just started a SM army as an allied detatchment for my Guard so, let you know how it goes haha."

Warhammer40k,3dr7jr,Nickers77,3,Sat Jul 18 17:57:15 2015 UTC,"Ebay is a good place to start.  For common armies like Space Marines, you can usually find pretty good deals.  You could also ask around your LGS to see if anyone there has models that they wouldn't mind parting with.  Other retailers sell at discounts (anywhere from 20-25% off) while recasters sell at steeper ones (~50% off).  But if he just wants to play, you can proxy an army using anything from cardboard cutouts to other types of minis (like Starwars minis or heroclix).  Or, of course, you could use your minis and play smaller games (since he's just starting).  Get him into it a small bit at a time.  I know the cost is quite high to get into this hobby, but it's really not as bad as people make it out to be.  Because it is a one time upfront fee for the models, the costs can be amortized over the years of play.  I paid $120 for some RW bikes 3 years ago, but I haven't had to pay more for them since.  Since armies generally cost ~$500-600 and can provide 5-10 years of enjoyment at hundreds of hours, it's much cheaper than going to the movies or eating out."

Warhammer40k,3dr7jr,SnippyTheDeliveryFox,2,Sun Jul 19 20:37:46 2015 UTC,"Recasts, discount retailers, special deals with local shops.  Recasts are really hit and miss. The good stuff is near flawless, the bad stuff is pretty much battlefield scrap. Takes a ton of time to get the products (shipping from China), price saving is somewhere between 25-75% and most recasters speak broken english so some things get lost in translation. GW has been cracking down on them, so its hard to find some of the smaller cheaper sellers, but they are there. Also of note, everything is resin, and its not exactly great for your health to inhale it. Tons of clean up work involved too, and miscasting and warping are common. Took me 4 + hours to fit a stormtalon together, with most of the time being spent dry fitting, filing and bending pieces back into proper shape. Saving 40% on a stormtalon, but then spending 4 hours of refitting time isn't worth it.   Discount retailers  are e-mail order catalogues/websites. In Canada one of the bigger ones is  GC minis. 25% off everything, but after tax and shipping, you really have to order over $100 to get some sort of savings. Discount Games Store was one I used to use that was pretty big in the states. Haven't used them in about a decade, but they used to run some pretty sweet auctions on ebay. Remember getting 2 for 1 rhinos at one point. With GW's semi new policy on web sales, most of the bigger sites have now resorted to being e-mail or phone ordering.  Local shops Some local area stores might put a flat discount on products, and depending on your bartering skills might even be willing to put more of a discount on if you commit to spending like $400 or something. Store near my house does flat 5%...I haven't asked though if I could beef that discount up if I commit to spending a large sum, mainly cause I am back logged in painting and space so I can't really cram in $400 worth of stuff."

Using guardsmen as a textbook example you can't get storm troopers/karsakin/tempestus for anything less than the gw price and drop pods for marines are about even as well.  Another problem is that rare or low volume products are often scalped. Using a prime example the land raider exclusior/rhino primaris kit sells for scalpers prices.

Warhammer40k,3dqapa,boozooki,1 point,Sat Jul 18 14:02:34 2015 UTC,"Well my thought process was that I could use the spore mines as a distraction for my enemies to use them as shooting targets while my other units advance, or on the other hand if they ignore them, they'll just run in and explode on their asses.

EDIT: Just realized +1 on D table means the lowest you can roll is a 2, D wep bounces off guardsman....NEVER AGAIN!  one of the nicest things we got was the 'daemon' rule.

Warhammer40k,3dlx2l,ReaperOfCaliban,3,Fri Jul 17 16:48:24 2015 UTC,And the +1 to the ion shield facing is awesome.

Warhammer40k,3dlx2l,ReaperOfCaliban,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:58:23 2015 UTC,If it gets the 5++ from being a daemon wouldn't that improve its 5++ on the ion shield to a 4++?

Warhammer40k,3dnclh,stawk,2,Fri Jul 17 17:52:41 2015 UTC,The Soviet model is slightly smaller then a normal guardsmen and has more realistic proportions. So I cant do an easy arm swap and am not totally happy with size of the lasgun. I am considering using the normal WW2 rifle they come with and doing something to it.  The main goal here is to pay less the $30 for 10 guys in static poses. The bolt action guys are 40 for $38 so im pretty dead set on using them as the base.
Warhammer40k,3dnclh,torealis,3,Fri Jul 17 17:52:58 2015 UTC,"You've highlighted the main issue, which is the gun.   The other issue will be their size when playing against others. The bolt action stuff is nice, but just kinda runty compared with 40k.   For me, the extra outlay on the valhallans is worth it. Yes they're single pose, but if you're willing to hack away, you can get some really good conversions out of them. My valhallan army has enough variety among the 105 models to keep me happy, and scale well with the rest of the imperial force they're part of.   Alternatively, check out some great coat models around the net. I think Victoria Miniatures do a good set."

Warhammer40k,3dp022,skijumpersc,2,Sat Jul 18 01:58:15 2015 UTC,"Gotta have atleast one Infantry Platoon to get more boots out there and to organize those heavy weapons teams into units.  Consider what you want your troops to do (mob up, camp on objectives, etc.) and distribute the hvy weapons accordingly.  The options are endless and loads of fun.  I like to run a platoon of 30 guardsmen, flamers and grenade launchers on them; with a PCS for some good Orders and a Heavy Weapon Squad stacked with mortars behind them. Scion command squad in a Taurox Prime would supplent your 7 existing perfectly and make a badass Scion Platoon. Could put the rough riders to decent use if they outflank with your sentinel (provided you run it as a Scout Sent. and get a couple lucky reserve rolls) and bolster the rearguard attack with whoever you have jumping out of that Valkyrie...looking at you, stormtrooper with a meltagun.  Edited: looking at the codex: RR cant outflank. Forgot they cant do anything.  And reference the Chain of Command Special Rule- a commisar may only be your warlord if you have no Senior Officer in your army"
Warhammer40k,3dp022,FirstCaptainTarr,2,Sat Jul 18 02:49:25 2015 UTC,Warlord trait can give them outflank. If you have creed you have a 4/6 chance of getting it
Warhammer40k,3dp022,thegeneralbo,2,Sat Jul 18 03:17:27 2015 UTC,So should I do a ccs and use that for my warlord then have yarrick on his own buffing infantry? Does he lose any usefulness if he's not my warlord?
Warhammer40k,3dp022,Rhilgefort,2,Sat Jul 18 05:04:19 2015 UTC,"Master of ordinance only really works if your command squad never moves. That kind of clashes with the regimental standard. And i would suggest an astropath. Telepathy is really good. And as Tarr mentioned, Yarrick can't be your warlord if you have a CCS due to that being a lord commissar special rule. And nork is an upgrade to a CCS, so he can't really interact with Yarrick either. And sadly Macharius is out all together. No rules for him. Although it would be a really cool model for your senior officer. It sounds like you want to run a bit more infantry heavy, so i would suggest more transports. Chimeras and tauroxes. Chimeras are usually reasonably (at least compared to most stuff) used. Tauroxes are newer, so they will be harder to get a deal on. And i would suggest for the vets, carapace armor and plasma weapons. I made carapace armor guys myself by putting cadian heads and lasgun arms on space marine scouts, and i thought that worked pretty well. That plus 3 plasma guns and a plasma pistol costs 135 points. A very good deal in my opinion. Throwing a commissar on them is not a bad idea either."

Warhammer40k,3dp022,Rhilgefort,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:26:32 2015 UTC,I think a psyker would be very helpful as well. The astropath is a really good value. And the primaris is good for fire support with biomancy or pyromancy or making things shoot really well with divination

There are different lists of psychic powers in the rulebook, and a psyker will have a list of which tables they can use, as well as mastery level which, among other things, determines how many powers they get. For example, that astropath i kept mentioning is mastery level one and has access to the telepathy and daemonology tables. So you would choose which table you like, and get one power from it. It is random, but there is always a generic power you can take if you dont like your random one."

You'll probably think the tank looks good when you're finished with it. But once finished guardsman #258 and tank #23 you're gonna look back at that Baneblade and wonder why you did it first.   I'd say centerpieces are to be done last (or probably somewhere in the middle) simply because you'll be improving your techniques with every model assembled and painted. Centerpieces should be exactly that: centerpieces. They should be the best assembled and painted models in your collection, they are the models that should draw the most praise and also the hardest scrutiny.

Warhammer40k,3do6pb,sizzlebutt666,2,Fri Jul 17 21:40:36 2015 UTC,"The knight will likely make your list stronger. It's unlikely that an enemy will be packing enough anti-armour to kill 2 land raiders and a knight quickly.  4 assassins is hard to utilise efficiently, so knights is the simpler option too."
Warhammer40k,3do6pb,gayezrealisgay,2,Fri Jul 17 22:23:54 2015 UTC,"I'm going to go the other way and say Assassins. I ran the set of 4 in my last game to amazing effect. Culexus took out the psyker buffing a basilisk squadron, eversor wiped out the majority of a command squad, forcing them to run. Calliduswiped out some heavy weapons teams, and the vindicare shot  some hullpoints off of a knight..  Everyones mileage will be different, but I think the assassins are fun, though I want a knight at some point too."
Warhammer40k,3do6pb,bobbothegobbo,2,Sat Jul 18 12:06:55 2015 UTC,"See that's what I'm thinking. While a Knight is delicious and OP, the Assassins can honestly wipe out the cumulative effects of a lot of special abilities. All five would probably equal the points cost and/or succeed in finishing off a Kaldor Draigo Death Star team.   Let me put it another way, which is better against the Necrons? I'd guess knight since Culexus has nothing psychic to throttle."
Warhammer40k,3do6pb,bobbothegobbo,1 point,Sat Jul 18 14:25:27 2015 UTC,"Only 4 Assassins. And I think its roughly 550 for the 4 of em (books upstairs atm) Callidus hurts necrons gooooood. Start 1"" away from a block of warriors, and neural shredder them... zip away into cover, come back out and cut the remainder or another unit to shreds... I always loved the Eversor, but its an insane offensive juggernaut now. They're all awesome in their own right. No secret there.. that culexus I used more to piss people off (we play doubles games usually.. so the last game was Guard and Tyranids) flyrants zipping around not being mindful ending up in the void zone made for funny shit."

I mean sure I'll be missing out on Stomp or D-Weapons, but 2 Land Raiders sure isn't anything to sneeze at when you're fighting the 4 infiltrating Assassins.   Honestly I've thought about just letting an Eversor hitch a ride in one of the Land Raiders and swapping a random Henchman with an accompanying Chimera. That way he can pop out of a Land Raider and let the rest of my unit and transport continue to other units or an Objective."

Warhammer40k,3dmt8l,Book_of_the_dead,4,Fri Jul 17 15:26:28 2015 UTC,I go skyhammer  cause I like thing to remain relatively cheap and I like the idea of the Stormtalon being infantry support based. Screaming in and wrecking opposing  heavy infantry.
Warhammer40k,3dmt8l,Blood_ForTheBloodGod,3,Fri Jul 17 16:28:57 2015 UTC,"Skyhammer; it's cheap, wants similar targets to the assaultcannon, good against infantry, light vehicles, and flyers.   Especially the first point shouldn't be undersold since you are working with a chassis that is only marginally more durable than a landspeeder and that mostly thanks to being a flyer."
Warhammer40k,3dmt8l,Ze_German_Guy,3,Fri Jul 17 21:12:50 2015 UTC,"I like my three S7 60"" range shots. And it's cheap."
Warhammer40k,3dmt8l,Amayasu,3,Fri Jul 17 16:05:28 2015 UTC,"Typhoon if you have the points.  You can go hover on an objective if you're out of range of the enemy and still get two shots off and you'll always have a good target for the missiles.  It's only five points more than the lascannon.  If you can't fit it in, go skyhammer."
Warhammer40k,3dmt8l,Werxes,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:58:58 2015 UTC,"I think typhoon is best. It shares the versatility of the assault cannon, they're both good against a very wide range of targets. It is the most expensive option though, so if you just need anti-air and want to save points you can go for lascannons."

Warhammer40k,3dng4m,Spiraticus,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:20:03 2015 UTC,"Depends on how you want to play. Do you want to just swarm the enemy? Do you want to engage in close combat?(which is unfavored currently, but possible) Do you want to blast them from the other side of the board? Do you want a low model count so you have to play purely on tactics with minimal but still present risk?(Trust me on this one, I play Grey Knights and I manage to botch 2+'s like no other.) Those are the types of questions you need to ask yourself before buying into an army."
Warhammer40k,3dng4m,Asx32,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:43:46 2015 UTC,I don't really have a preference over swarming the opponent or having a small elite force. I would prefer a faster moving force though.
Warhammer40k,3dng4m,ANakedBear,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:22:13 2015 UTC,I do want an army that is more than competent in close combat.
Warhammer40k,3dng4m,ANakedBear,2,Fri Jul 17 19:25:04 2015 UTC,Then Tau is not for you...  Maybe Space Marines with focus on Assault Marines and Bikes?  Or Eldar - they are very mobile and has some good melee options...
Warhammer40k,3dng4m,Asx32,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:49:43 2015 UTC,What aspects about each army do you enjoy?    Do you know the rules enough to have a play style that you find interesting?
Warhammer40k,3dng4m,DarkrootKnight,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:59:10 2015 UTC,"I like Tyranids because of the badass models with plenty of close combat. Space Wolves, I dont know much about but think they are aesthetically appealing. Eldar just seem all around powerful and elite. Tau seem to be a good army but possibly too tactical for me to handle. Daemons seem pretty awesome and have lots of CC."
Warhammer40k,3dng4m,DarkrootKnight,3,Fri Jul 17 19:24:41 2015 UTC,"From your posts it sounds like you like the Tyranids the most.  I strongly recommend you do not pick an army because you think it will be ""good"".  You'll lose interest much faster then if you pick an army you find interesting fluff and ascetics wise.    I am going to go off of you deciding Tyranids, though to be honest, all the armies you listed are good choices for beginners (save Daemons maybe).    Tyranids are a harder army to play, but that is because most people don't recognize that Tyranids are won or lost based on your army list and deployment.  Your lists need to ""do"" something.  They need to have an over all theme to how you attack your opponent in the same way that Space Marines do.    The good news is that even for a beginner there are some common units that are almost always useful.    Start with this kit.  You can't go wrong with any of those models (exempt maybe the Warriors depending on who you ask).  It gives you all the models you need to get started and keeps you at only a few hundred bucks when you add the rule book.  Even better is that two of them is a solid force that gets you close to 1000pts of models, but I digress.    The main draw to Tyranids in my opinion is the fact that your army works off of making you opponents make mistakes.  You send a squad of Guants and a squad of Carnifexes to his lines.  The Carnifexes can actually hurt him, but if he kills the carnifexes, the guants will tie him up in close combat for he rest of the game.    Same for Close combat.  All Monstrous Creatures are Anti anything they can charge, so while that Exocrine is your main fire support, any enemy that gets with in charge range is going to really be sorry when the Exocrine shoots they then charges them.    Their biggest down side is long range shooting, or armies that can kill units and avoid your counter attacks.  This can be mitigated with their Pods, but still is a weakness.    Ok, I'll cover the other armies a bit also.    Eldar are slippery and get a lot of their power by attacking then running away to avoid retaliation.  They crumble to an opponent that can catch them.    Space Marines win by quickly killing the big threats of your opponent then just not dying and sitting on the objectives.  They don't last long though against an army that can over come their strong defense or has more targets then the marines can easily eliminate.    Tau use superior fire power to kill your opponent before he gets to your side of the board or eliminate things that can hurt you then mop up what can't.  Anything that can get around that punishing fire power like drop pods or hyper fast units will reek havoc in their lines.    Space Wolves are basically like Space Marines exempt they use less dudes to do the job (their basic guys are probably the most powerful basic troops in the game) and some times ride wolves when they want to make their Primarch cry with shame.  Same Weaknesses.    Daemons are tricky.  You really need to know the mechanics to use them well as some times you start the game with less then 10 models!  The good lists I have seen start with a few High Powered Daemons (ether Princes, or Fast moving Heralds) and summon extra units if they need a few more bodies.  Any one who can deal with them bending seemingly all the rules in their favor will find they can table them by turn 3.    This is a lot all at once but hopefully it helps you find an army you find cool and interesting to use.    Please post more questions and I will answer them the best I can."
Warhammer40k,3dng4m,abramthrust,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:48:48 2015 UTC,How about Khorne Daemonkin? They are CC-oriented and don't care if they get killed before reaching their enemies...
Warhammer40k,3dng4m,Situis,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:51:43 2015 UTC,This has all been quite helpful. I think Space Wolves are off my list just because they are quite expensive. Tau are cool but also off my list for multiple reason. I will most likely play Tyranids because of the awesome models and good close combat (and my game store has a lot of cheap used models).

Warhammer40k,3dmycd,AverageSizedPenis,3,Fri Jul 17 16:05:52 2015 UTC,"Alright IMO you have too much plasma.  Some plasma is nice; plasma is super fun and super killy.  However having that many plasma guns and combi-plasmas might be overkill.  I'll give you what I think of each of your entries and your list overall.  --HQ--  At 1000pts, the lvl2 Libby is a great choice.  Personally, I like them cheap.  Take the lvl2 upgrade and that's it.  He comes with a force weapon free (and a bolt pistol), so he's not a total slouch in melee.  His job isn't to shoot, but to support and bring in some psychic power.  Roll on the table of your choice based upon what you're playing against.  --Troops--  These guys are pretty good.  Missile Launchers are ok, but they (like all single shot weapons) are quite disappointing when they miss.  I don't usually take Tactical Marines, but I have found Plasma Cannons to be the most impactful; it does better vs MEQs/TEQs, almost as good vs Vehicles, and the Blast profile at such a high S and low AP is fantastic.  Plasma guns and Combi-plasmas are good.  --Elites--  I haven't seen Sternguard ran this way, since you spend a lot of points to have them sit inside of a transport and not shooting.  Running Combi-meltas are definitely the meta (along with a drop pod), since it is almost guaranteed First Blood.  It looks like the Librarian will be here, which might be ok, but now you have over a third of your force sitting inside of a Razorback doing nothing.  If you do decide to go for the pod, you will have to find another place to put the Libby.  You wouldn't want to drop your warlord in like that...  --Heavy--  I'm not sure I like the loadout on the 2nd Pred.  The Heavy Bolters do nothing against most vehicles while the Lascannon does very little vs infantry targets.  I would go for Autocannon + Lacannon Sponsons, which is a pretty good budget light-medium vehicle buster / MC killer.  Tri-las has its place, but I think it's a bit too expensive.  --Overall--  It looks like you have a lot of short-ranged shooting (12"" double tap for your plasmas) and would definitely win some short-mid ranged firefights.  However, I feel like you would struggle against dug in armies (Tau / IG gun lines), armies that have alternate saves (Jink, Reanimation Protocol, Invul), and melee-centric armies (Thunderwolf Calvary, Orks, Nids, Chaos).  Against the first two, you will have issues killing them because you have a lot of very expensive plasma whose value is lost when the AP value doesn't ignore all of their saves.  Against bike and melee armies, you will only have one round of full strength shooting before you are charged.  If they build to include a ton of Invul saves or cover saves, that one round of shooting you got in won't do too much either.  You've built a strong back line with the Preds, but I feel like you need to somehow pressure dug-in enemies.  But then with your strong back line, you will also have to find a way to protect them from fast moving threats.  I just don't see any of these units and think ""damn, that is going to do a lot of killing"".  They can either be targeted and brought down (like the Preds) or ignored (like all the Power Armored dudes).  They don't bring the same threat level as a centurion squad or a bike squad or an Imperial Knight that makes me think ""I have to deal with that quickly, or I will lose""."
Warhammer40k,3dmycd,_hei,2,Fri Jul 17 21:26:30 2015 UTC,"Haha, one of things I've heard as a new SM player was that you cant have too much plasma.   Wow thanks for the very detailed response. The plasma cannon is a great idea and I plan on replacing the MLs with them. The reason I dont want to use drop pods, is because im trying to make a fluffy list, of an entirely mechanized force. Any suggestions for a replacement for the sterngaurd in the RB? I guess the Librarian is a bit pointless in this list then.  About the lack of cover killing, would replacing the dakka pred with a whirlwind be a good idea?"
Warhammer40k,3dmycd,_hei,2,Sat Jul 18 03:00:31 2015 UTC,"Yea, that's pretty true.  However with the addition of Grav, I think Grav is the gun to spam.  Bolters handle light infantry, Grav handles everything else.  MEQs, TEQs, MC's, GMC's, vehicles, you name it.  Anything with armor save better than 4+ or an AV value higher than 12 gets destroyed by Grav.  But the Grav vs Plasma is a different discussion.  So we talking fluffy list huh?  LET'S GO.  Mechanized can take two types of transports: Rhinos and Razorbacks.  I would suggest the latter.  Rhinos are cool, but they don't have guns.  You can get a lot more shots out of Razorbacks with 5-man Tac Squads.  Give the Tacs a heavy, sit them ~10-12"" from your table edge, and shoot.  After they take a lot of casualties, hop into the Razorback (if it's still alive) and camp objectives.  You spend less points on troops and more points on the killy stuff.  BUT if you ever want to go Demi / Battle company, you already have a good number of troops and transports.  For replacing the Sternguard, I feel like Land Raiders would fit your theme as well as begin planning for larger forces.  You could take any of the variations and look to fill them with Assault Terminators, Grav Centurions, or something else of your choosing.  Problem being, it's 250pts which is hard to bring to a 1000pts game (you don't have a lot of points left for other stuff).  Vindicators are killy and pretty cool, but they are bullet magnets and die quickly.  So instead, why not take more Tacs with a heavy and a Razorback?  You end up with a lot of small units with good firepower.  You could take 3 squads of tacs, 1 squad of Devastators, all in Razorbacks; with 5 Heavy Weapons, Lascannons on the Razorbacks, and a lvl2 Libby in power armor, you still have 250pts to play with.  With some Preds, you have a TON of 36-48"" shooting.  Still struggles against dug in armies though.  Sooo Whirlwinds are cool.  Super cheap, very good at killing light infantry.  I think they're very solid.  My alternative against cover saves has always been the Assault phase, and it has been pretty effective.  If you're lucky, you could get Perfect Timing on the Divination table.  Or you could look to find some kind of fast moving Templates or fast moving assault.  Drop Podding Ironclads with heavy flamers or bike squads with flamers would work pretty well.  Dunno how you feel about those though."
Warhammer40k,3dmycd,_hei,1 point,Sat Jul 18 05:01:13 2015 UTC,"The land raider/ assault termies sounds great, but theyre worth over 400 points, and since i probably have to put my libby with them that puts over half of my points in one metal box. That seems risky and not as great.  So your saying keep plasma on sterngaurd but give the special/ sergent weapons all grav guns? Ive never used them before so Ill try them out.  If i substitute in 2 razorbacks that will greatly diminish the amount of troops i have  and that worries me, less scoring and if the enemy has a lot of Anti Armor, im effectivly boned.  Lastly I dont want droppods just to keep fluffy, I guess assault marines could work, but for their base cost i can get a whirlwind or a Vindicator. A 5 man assault squad sounds like it will die before it can engage, so that makes a whirlwind the most appealing choice, do you agree?"
Warhammer40k,3dmycd,_hei,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:08:39 2015 UTC,"Yep, the Land Raider is a HUGE investment, that most players would agree is not worth it.  But I was thinking more of a fluff stand point.  Not having a Land Raider in a mechanized list is a bit weird.  From an effective list building stand point, I wouldn't take it.  Don't worry too much about not having 10-man squads.  For the most part, 1 is just as good as 10 when capping objectives.  If someone really wants that objective, 10 will die just as fast as 5.  From my experience, this game favors smaller units over larger ones because of the ""one unit attacks one unit"" game system.  100 guys in one unit can still only attack one unit, be it 5 guys or 10.  So here's a list that I think would be pretty good in casual games and will be very good once you expand to the 1850pts bracket (to run the Battle Company).  --HQ--  Librarian Mastery lvl2  --Troops--  5-man Tacs, Plasma Cannon, Razorback (Heavy Bolter)  5-man Tacs, Plasma Cannon, Razorback (Heavy Bolter)  5-man Tacs, Plasma Cannon, Razorback (Heavy Bolter)  --Heavy Support--  5-man Devastators, 2x Gravcannon, Razorback (Heavy Bolter)  Predator Squadron, 2 Tanks, Autocannons and Lascannon Sponsons  Whirlwind  --Total--  1000pts  So you could change the Devs into more Tacs and play around with the points a bit, split up the Preds, add dozer blades if you want to, etc.  This list brings a LOT of units, making it hard for your opponent to target them.  You could lose 2 units a turn, and you will still have units on the table at the end of Turn 5.  It packs a lot of 36-48"" firepower, which is great against most armies.  Vs armies that want to shoot back, you'll have to get creative with cover, sniping their long ranged Anti-tank, and protecting your own.  This list does have a LOT of static elements, which you can also change if you feel the need to.  You would basically camp out Turns 1-3 while firing away with your heavy weapons.  Come turn 4, you load up and roll out to mid-field.  You should've taken care of most threats, so the Razorbacks will be pretty safe now.  Turn 5, you should be in your opponent's deployment zone to cap his objectives and getting Line Breaker.  That is, of course, assuming everything goes according to plan.  Which ... usually doesn't happen.  But that's what makes this game fun!"
Warhammer40k,3dmycd,Ze_German_Guy,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:30:10 2015 UTC,"This seems like an interesting list. However it seems a bit low on Anti tank, maybe Having a dev squad with 2 or 3 lascannons will help with that? Right now i would not even be able to glance AV14 armor. But the huge anti infantry fire seems amazing"
Warhammer40k,3dmycd,Ze_German_Guy,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:30:18 2015 UTC,"Against AV10-12, the Predators will make short work of them.  For AV13-14, you have the Grav Centurions.  You have 4 Lascannons already with the Predators, and the only real efficient way to take out AV13-14 is with melta and Grav.  But since you are against using drop pods, bikes, and assault marines, the short ranged melta and Grav weapons won't be an option here.  You will basically have to hope that the AV13-14 tank moves within 24"" of your Grav Devastators."
Warhammer40k,3dmycd,Werxes,2,Mon Jul 20 18:27:05 2015 UTC,"Don't bother with heavy bolter sponsons for predators, especially not if you upgrade to a twin linked lascannon turret. If you want sponsons always go with lascannons, in your example I'd go with one tank autocannon/las and one just las turret. (You also accidentally wrote assault cannon predator, that variant is unique to blood angels)  Give combi-meltas to the sternguard and put them in a drop pod, that's your anti tank. You already get special ammo that is plasma-light. It also gives you another 40 points to play around with.   If you think you'll be facing flyers I'd replace the las turret pred with a stormtalon.   EDIT: Just realized that the librarian has no place other than with the sternguard, if you aren't ultramarines roll on divination to get re-rolls in the shooting phase and hope for 4++ save.   EDIT2: Also consider cutting out 5 tacticals with a missile launcher and replacing them with a bike squad with grav."
Warhammer40k,3dmycd,jljfuego,2,Fri Jul 17 20:59:24 2015 UTC,"Removing the Hb of the las pred sounds like a good idea, but what would be the role of a Autocannon/lascanon pred? The added versatility looks expensive on paper.   I dont want to use drop pods, because i want to make a fluffy list. Would substituting a combat squad for a land speeder with a MM for anti tank be a decent substitution?"
Warhammer40k,3dmycd,jljfuego,1 point,Sat Jul 18 03:05:27 2015 UTC,"It's a light vehicle/MC hunter. You save 25 points but still get almost the same tank killing power as a tri-las.   Landspeeders are glass cannons. If you can find the points I'd rather go for a bike squad with attack bike. Then again, with that many light armour transports already on the table a landspeeder does add to target saturation."

It's such a stupid concept, the models are really poor. And the fluff is goddamn terrible.  The idea is that terminator armor is ancient and hard to build, exceptionally hard. Maybe Rysa can make it. So the space marines/admech created their own design as a stopgap. This is massive tech heresy. There is no STC pattern, it is cheap and inferior and an affront to the HOLY pattern of terminator armor.   Space marines furthermore are religious about their armor and equipment. Not a single space marine would accept some new fangled ad-hoc stopgap half rate terminator suit. I'm pretty sure it also violates the codex astartes because tactics for that suit didn't exist.  All in all its poor and sloppy writing, a shitty ugly model, completely op rules. The only positive thing is that it is a MC killer, which because of that power creep is required.... But that's a whole other discussion."

Yeah my shitty paint doesn't show it,  I've made the streets central and tried with the toxic waterways to have them terminate in the same place on the board so the match up and it can be somewhat modular.  the questions I have, considering I have not played much WH40K is are there a specific set of rules about how much cover / elevation / LoS etc. a board should have (before adding in terrain pieces)  and secondly if there are any improvements I might want to make to make it more interesting to play upon."

Warhammer40k,3dk4xs,FirstCaptainTarr,2,Fri Jul 17 16:47:45 2015 UTC,"This is comparatively very good for a first model. The paint appears to be appropriately thinned (which is the mistake most of us make in tge beginning). Your use of a wash for the flesh was the right choice. The blood on the sything talons looks very nice.  In terms of improvement:   I would highlight the carapace. A lighter blue highlight would make the carapace pop in the same way that the flesh does.  I would wash and highlight the devouror. It looks very flat compared to rmthe rest of the model. You could consider some subtle layering of the flesh to clean up the effect created by the wash. If you look at the first arm (ie the one with the sything talon) image #1, the wash has worked very well and created some nice light to dark gradients.  But if you compare to the second arm (holding the devouror) its abit more patcy. A thin layer effect with the paint that you used to basecoat applied to the raised areas of the flesh will tidy it up. The blood effect on the face is a little over the top. I wouldn't change it, but I also wouldn't do that to the other models in the army.   If you paint the rest of the army to this standard, plus taking into account my first two points, its going to be a very nice army.  Edit: I made some ""pointz"" in the above text,  but since dis wernt an orky fred I deshided ta make it ""points"" insted."

Think of it how like basketball teams have their courts all decked out in their team colors and logo to match their uniform. Got the home field advantage when your army is matching your board ;). Would also look awesome when if army's all standing in unison with their matching snow bases on somebody's grass field board, could be like WINTER IS COMING BITCH."
Warhammer40k,3dmn09,Al_Cinnah,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:46:32 2015 UTC,As always bases look wierd when playing on other boards. I would advice maybe going for a gray stone with only hints of snow on the bases as that would easier blend into more boards if that is a concern.
Warhammer40k,3dmn09,fauh,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:59:50 2015 UTC,"Yes they will look strange, but that'll happen on any bases.    The main thing to keep in mind is a good rule of thumb (for me anyway) is to make sure your model and it's base has contrast.  So if you have a light colored model have a dark colored base, and vice versa.  So if you are going white for base, maybe make them a darker color.  You can even dry brush your models with a HINT of white to give it a frosted type look.  That's what I did on my Space Wolves.  I'd honestly use whatever you use for your snow on your board.  That's what I did with my grass.  I used a shit load of grass flock on my board, then used what was left to base my models."

There's also tons of variety in their units and pretty much every unit in the army is useful in some way. For harlequins, you can absolutely crossover their units with eldar because they are battle brothers. Finally, to answer your last question, yes that is a great set of models to start with. There's a ton of variety in the units there so you can learn about the many different ways certain units play into an army."

Warhammer40k,3dljnh,SocksOfDeath,2,Fri Jul 17 07:17:39 2015 UTC,"It's the highest level of alliance.   Battle Brothers Units from the same army that are Battle Brothers treat each other as ‘friendly units’ for all rules purposes. This means, for example, that units:  • Can benefit from the Warlord Trait of a Warlord that is a Battle Brother.  • Can be joined by an Independent Character that is a Battle Brother.  • Are counted as being friendly units for the targeting of Battle Brothers’ psychic powers, abilities and so on.  • Can use special abilities to repair Hull Points, Immobilised or Weapon Destroyed results on Battle Brothers’ vehicles.  • Can use modifiers and re-rolls that apply to Reserve Rolls that are granted by a Battle Brother’s model.  • Can embark on each other’s Transport vehicles."
Warhammer40k,3dm50q,MasterAsia6,2,Fri Jul 17 11:36:20 2015 UTC,Honestly while painted ok it looks like a toy. Doesn't match the CSM deamon or really any of the citadel design. That and it strikes me as the lolz bewbs that really doesn't fit the EC which fall more under the hellrazer / ultra excess / sadist  thing rather then the hedonism that the deamon  side has. I apologize for being harsh as you said its one of your first conversions but you asked for C+C and the model hits a lot of my pet peeves.
Warhammer40k,3dm50q,soupcat42,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:08:24 2015 UTC,"Well it's not finished painting just yet.

Warhammer40k,3dm50q,Lokistale,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:33:22 2015 UTC,I think the red is too bright. Take the color down with a dark wash and i think it will look great. Also work on neatening the paintjob up a bit. Cleaning up the lines will help the paintjob a lot since the model is very clean and defined

Warhammer40k,3diwfb,BloodBride,3,Thu Jul 16 18:15:17 2015 UTC,"While none of these games were top tier in their day, every fan should enjoy all three. I highly recommend them.  Shadow of the Horned Rat, if I recall correctly, is best played through once until you choke. You will learn the controls, and how some of the basic units move and react. Then go back and play it with an eye to win. Don't ruin it by reading guides. One tip I will give, is magic items can be found during battles. I think a sword is behind a building on the first mission.  Final Lib is classic epic 40k. The cut scenes are corny and still fun to watch. Sometimes the AI isn't a challenge, so on later replays you might need to tone down how you play to enjoy it.  Chaos Gate is like the old X-Com games. You can move 2 spaces, chuck a grenade, then move a space, go on overwatch. One battle will be an easy slaughter, the next your whole force will die. This is probably the best game of the three."

Warhammer40k,3do3y5,williegumdrops,2,Fri Jul 17 21:48:13 2015 UTC,"I'm afraid that really doesn't look like urban camouflage. That appears to be a Fire Warrior painted black, with minor accents.  Urban camouflage is designed to blend into city environments, so its normally done in shades of grey and blue, and varies depending on the colours of the local structures.  Constructive Criticism: The red accent on the rifle appears thick and imprecise. When doing freehand work, it's imperative that you do it in small amounts, with smaller, reasonably thin paint. Thin paint brushes on cleanly and does not leave a raised surface and working gradually in small amounts ensures precision.  The same goes for the other red accents.  Beyond that, the model appears to be painted entirely black and lacks definition. Urban camouflage is normally composed of white, greys and blues in various disruptive patterns."

Warhammer40k,3dlmtk,Anggul,6,Sat Jul 18 13:57:32 2015 UTC,Twin-linked avenger catapults on Exarchs aren't worth it. Shimmershield can be a good call so you don't need to worry about cover and things like heavy flamers won't just clear you out.  You don't have much decent anti-air.

But what really takes the cake is the fact you can get 150% out of your fire warriors every shooting phase.  Keep him inside a devilfish, and now every 2 squads of fire warriors has (effectively) the same fire power as 3 in double tap range.  But since they're still 2 squads, you save on marker light effectiveness as well.   And all that for 50pts.  What?!  That is crazy value.    You might lose the game by 1VP if he dies, but if you can force shots at a Jinking devilfish to get that single extra VP, you have a larger window for the rest of your army."

The main thing with 40k balance is also how your list stacks up with an opponent, a super competitive list from an older/less powerful army will be able to beat a non competitive list from a ""top"" army. Dark eldar are a VERY difficult army to run, but when played correctly can be devastatingly good. They are very squishy with very bad armor saves and toughness, but they have a ton of mobility and, cover, and invul saves to make up for it. They also have fantastic DPS output and with poisoned have no trouble hurting even the tougher models. Power from pain is a fun rule that makes the get better every turn. Others have mentioned on this, and I am not a great painter either. Technique and use of the right colors/layers/washes/highlights can make a HUGE difference. Also keep in mind alot of the armies you will see on the internet are show pieces and things people are showing off because they are well above average quality. Most people paint for ""tabletop quality"" which means, does it look good at arms length. Don't worry to much about it :) Next up would be a rule book and codex. Once you have those, plan out your army by looking at what you think is cool/good. watch some battle reports and see what they use and what works and doesn't. Your first purchase should be what you need to fill out a CAD, so you will need 1 HQ choice and 2 Troop choices. From there it is up to you."
Warhammer40k,3dj94z,Waylander0719,2,Thu Jul 16 19:16:27 2015 UTC,"Very good, balance is the best it has been (kind of).  The only oddity, is that there was a whole slew of books released at the same time.  They were all on the same power level and very well balanced, but the books changed half way through and a new power level was defined.  So now half the books are balanced with each other on one power level and the other half are on a deference power level but still balanced with one another.  However, over all, it is probably the best it has been for as long as I can remember.    Lower half of the power split.  Odd to use in the current meta since Heavy Infantry are in right now, but still have some nasty combos especially if you pair them with their Craftworld brothers.    Technique.  I also have a bit of shake when I paint fine detail but can still put out models that get complements because I play to the strengths I have.  Darker base colors with a few bright accent colors then carefully pick out the details i need to get them to work.  Less is more here and you are focusing on the impression instead of getting each part painted to their logical colors.  Inking, shading and dry brushing will work wonders and is little more then blobbing paint on in the right way.    From what I near, Warriors in ether Venoms or Raiders is a strong choice for troops.  Ravagers, and Scourges are the heavy hitters I know of, but Dark Eldar really excel when they are small and taking objectives form your opponents.  I would look for a more experienced Dark Eldar Player for more advice."

The formation allows you to field all three together as one unit-which is just great as you may imagine!   DE are no powerhouses but they have their tricks. Dark Artisan and Scalpel Squad from the Haemonculus Covens formations make sweet units, and Kabalites in Raiders, Razorwing Jetfighters, and Scourges are still very high quality units.

Maybe also a really shooty IG list. Especially because as DEldar, you don't have anything else for the anti-tank to shoot at. But that would be a tough nut to crack. Assuming no markerlights, a unit of missilesides only puts a bit under 1.5 wounds on it in a turn of shooting. Plasma crisis gives a wound at rapid fire range. Riptide is .5 wounds, and fusion crisis is .667 wounds. How many wounds do the pain engines have each? 3 or 4? Markerlights brings it up to 2 1.7 .85 and 1.7 again, respectively. That's 6 wounds on average, but I'm putting a lot of fire into them. Reminds me of those indestructible thunder wolf cavalry, giant cc beat stick and fire magnet. Terrifying, and saves the rest of your army from getting shot that turn, but they won't make it into combat with a good Tau player, or if they do it'll just be a turn of munching on kroot or fire warriors.

I personally share your opinion that I like that my models reflect what they are using so i just used the high yield missile rifle approach. just cut the barrel of the railgun and magnetize that. its relatively easy and looks pretty badass

The rules only mention what changes from normal and normally passengers shoot at full BS (unless you go cruising speed, but that's a change from normal and therefore specifically mentioned in the rules)  As for why; The rules make no sense in real world physics or even in the canon fluff physics, that's why."
Warhammer40k,3djzlk,Ze_German_Guy,2,Fri Jul 17 00:59:20 2015 UTC,"Yes that is correct.  Jinking forces the unit that jinked to snap fire (be it transports or bikes).

Warhammer40k,3dkpy2,caster,5,Fri Jul 17 01:35:01 2015 UTC,"The problem with homebrew is that balance is impossible. It takes hundreds and hundreds of man-hours to balance two armies with a new set of rules, and even then it's tough. But when you're talking about 15 armies (or whatever we're up to now), it's completely impossible. That's the one and only reason that 40k is so unbalanced. It's easy to say Eldar are op, or CSM suck (we do), but even the most minor changes throw off the meta so much that it's pointless to try to correct those in real time.   Keep in mind that games that do a better job of balance like infinity and warmahordes are 3-5 armies, and the armies themselves are way smaller.  People are drawn to 40k because of the massive expanse of the universe. The ability to put 500 models on the table and have a somewhat competitive game. To play 6 games in a row that are completely unique experiences. To ALWAYS have new models to buy, a new army to start, new things to try. Have you ever seen a $10,000 dropzone commander collection? Granted, it hasn't been out that long, but that's sorta the point.  Designing a TTG is a big sliding scale between:  -expansive  -fun and flavourful  -balanced  -efficient  GW occupies a position mostly toward the first two, while warmahordes prioritizes the last two. Every set of homebrew rules I've seen are VERY heavily geared towards #2. Age of sigmar has completely thrown out #3, but nailed the other three. Maybe someday a company will nail all four, but until then you have to decide which points are most important to you and pick a game accordingly."
Warhammer40k,3dkpy2,Colemonstaa,0,Fri Jul 17 02:51:54 2015 UTC,"Isn't this ultimately just a complexity problem? It's not fundamentally impossible, it will just require a significant amount of planning as well as trial and error to experiment and adjust.  Wargames are also very well suited to out-and-out asymmetric games, so I think the ""balanced"" requirement is really a self-imposed constraint to have the option for a ""perfect"" match like Chess. But since this is largely impossible, why not concede that the game is just going to be asymmetric?  Another point- 40K's insistence on IGOUGO and initial deployment leads to the majority of the ""efficiency"" problems.  A unit-by-unit activation system will fix a lot of 40K's imbalance and efficiency issues; a side ""going first"" is not really that big an advantage if that first move is only one unit rather than the entire army.  Second, piecemeal deployment, such as beginning the game with an empty board and adding units over the course of the match, will help with strategic choice and efficiency. This also has a huge effect on balance since early in a match there will be relatively few units on the field. Deploying units should consume some type of resource in order for this system to work well, likely depending on the unit's points cost.  Third, ""balance"" is very difficult in a system of arbitrary costs. A planned, systematic approach to computing points costs could potentially simplify the game and simultaneously provide a powerful foundation to balance it, allowing tweaks where necessary."
Warhammer40k,3dkpy2,Colemonstaa,4,Fri Jul 17 03:21:08 2015 UTC,"I have no idea what IGUOGO means.  However, piecemeal deployment? Resource based deployment? Activation system? In the kind of 40k I play, as in 1850 points, keeping track of this crap would make the game absurdly more complicated and cumbersome. You complain the game is inefficient, but want to add layers of complexity to every part of it.  40k as is, at its core, very simplistic. Everyone moves (only two options for distance). Everyone uses powers. Everyone shoots. Everyone fights. This is what allows you to play huge games without a month and a supercomputer. Any kind of alternating system would invariably break down once you start getting into wildly varying unit counts and big games. Does the squad of paladins move once for every time one of the ten squads of orks moves? Because that would be absurdly unfair. Or is it paladins, orks, orks, orks, etc., because that's just overcomplicating the current system. And what if you have two squads of paladins?   This is what I'm talking about on the slider. Of course they could add mechanics to make it more balanced or tactical, but the games take absurdly long as it is. You can't have all four.  Again, it seems like you want 40k to be warmahordes. It can't, because you can't have giant epic battles of warmahordes, and those are so central to 40k. You're absolutely right that a game of warmahordes is all around better, more fair, and more efficient than a 500pt game of 40k, but people don't play 40k for 500, they play for 1500+."
Warhammer40k,3dkpy2,Ze_German_Guy,1 point,Fri Jul 17 03:57:56 2015 UTC,"Very good post, I agree completely.   IGOUGO is a (stupidly inefficient) abbreviation of I-go-you-go. I know it mostly from hex and counter wargaming where it's used to distinguished between games where one side activates all units (like 40k) and other systems, like chit pull where you randomly draw which unit activates next."

Warhammer40k,3dkpy2,Colemonstaa,1 point,Fri Jul 17 05:17:39 2015 UTC,"IGOUGO (I agree it's a dumb name) refers to the mechanic of having one side move all their units and then the other side takes their turn and moves all their units.  It's a terrible system because the player who goes first has a huge advantage that gets bigger as the scale of the game increases.  However, more importantly, it also means that one player basically does nothing while the other player gets to take their turn. Allowing one player to move a unit, then the other player, then the first player again, and so on until everyone has moved, is a much more fun system.  A random selection system is one way to do it (pulling dice from a bag). This is ""fair"" in that everyone will always get to go, and if one player got to go a few times consecutively then it is more likely the other player will get to go next. This also means deploying more units makes you more likely to be able to go, which may or may not be desirable.  As for actually deploying units rather than starting the game with everything on the table- what exactly is the problem with that? You still end up with a big battle with everything on the table. In fact you could even have armies of ""unlimited"" size by having reinforcements when units are wiped out. A squad of Guardsmen gets wiped, no problem, bring in a fresh one.  I don't want 40K to be Warmachine, but the fact of the matter is there is no reason why 40K needs to consume so much time in mechanics, and be so deterministic by unit stats and chance."

Wraithknight aside, they do a damn good job of costing most of their 500ish different units, and thousands of upgrades. Any failures there are mostly due to the time gap between codeces. Or Phil Kelly's refusal to make reasonably priced MEQs.  People want 40k to be balanced. You can always take a balanced game and make it asymmetric for the sake of fun, but you can't do the opposite. Like I said, maybe someday a company will come along and make a perfectly balanced game of this size, but for now GW is the best we've got.   I've heard the job of balancing 40k compared to levelling a lake with a butter knife.

Warhammer40k,3dgjis,KinglyWeevil,3,Thu Jul 16 17:52:35 2015 UTC,Looks good. Certainly nothing I could say would make it better ;)

Warhammer40k,3dgjis,Tsumugi123,3,Thu Jul 16 02:53:09 2015 UTC,Thats actually very cool- almost looks emerald or a sort of jade. I really like it.
Warhammer40k,3dgjis,Pownzerx,2,Thu Jul 16 05:08:28 2015 UTC,I would paint the steps on the side doors silver and edge highlight them white. Like so: http://imgur.com/GjwFlBc  My only other comment is: Keep up The Emperors work!
Warhammer40k,3dgjis,UltimateUltamate,2,Thu Jul 16 10:53:59 2015 UTC,"Thanks! I like your tank, can see some ideas from your one."
Warhammer40k,3dgjis,michaelzelen,2,Thu Jul 16 11:15:13 2015 UTC,"looks nice, what did you use to highlight and get that green to pop so nice? also how did you do the symbol?"
Warhammer40k,3dgjis,KKillroyV2,1 point,Thu Jul 16 11:03:18 2015 UTC,"Thanks. I just used various shades of green, mainly just edge highlighting. Though I also used a couple of layers of spray matt varnish at the end to keep it protected, which may make it pop? or maybe it's just the lighting?  For the symbol, I got a picture and printed it, cut it out, painted inside the hole roughly, then cleaned up the lines afterwards."
Warhammer40k,3dgjis,SnippyTheDeliveryFox,2,Thu Jul 16 11:21:30 2015 UTC,Looks really nice (for a filthy human) I'd love to see some dirt/dust added on the tracks etc but that's just my opinion
Warhammer40k,3dgjis,SnippyTheDeliveryFox,2,Thu Jul 16 11:15:23 2015 UTC,I assume the splotches of silver are meant to be places where the paint was stripped away?
Warhammer40k,3dgjis,bloodstainer,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:02:21 2015 UTC,"Yeah, something like that. Does it look unconvincing or bad?"

If you want to keep the look nice and clean like that I would leave it as is, but I personally like to do a light drybrushing of metal color over sharp edges to make it look like the paint has been worn down a bit."
Warhammer40k,3dgjis,bloodstainer,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:11:29 2015 UTC,"Look great, but did you prime the model black? I find that doing that really helps make the dark angel models look really good, it looks good but somewhat light, not sure what it is though"

Warhammer40k,3dj9ze,DeskRaven,2,Thu Jul 16 18:48:03 2015 UTC,Wolf scouts are elites not troops.  Long fangs in a rhino isn't a good idea. Only two can shoot and if they move or disembark they can only snap shoot. What are those stormbolter wolfguard doing?  What is the wolf lord doing?  Bloodclaws in drop-pods is a bit silly because they can't charge after deepstriking.  The grey hunters should take priority with transports. All drop pods and rhinos.   Leave bloodclaws out entirely. Make one more bike squad to fill the third claw slot.  Tbh the great company formation is average at best unless you have the right transports. I'd just run a CAD detachment.
Warhammer40k,3dj9ze,DaveO1337,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:43:11 2015 UTC,"Thanks! In response:   Changed I assumed I could move them into range, and snap fire first term, then fire normally whilst the rhino moved onwards Wolf Guard were mandatory, and I was planning on joining them with the wolf lord and footslogging forwards as I don't think he can take transports Oh - I'll swap them out for bikers then As rhinos can carry 10 hunters, I was planning to carry two squads per rhino to keep costs down *What should I do with spare points?"
Warhammer40k,3dj9ze,DaveO1337,2,Thu Jul 16 20:54:26 2015 UTC,"The best use for those wolf guard would be to stick them in a drop pod and give them Combi weapons.   Transports can only hold one squad at a time so only one unit of grey hunters is allowed unfortunately.   The wolf lord is will die footslogging so he'll need to go in a transport. The best thing for that is taking a stormwolf flyer for the wolf standard grey hunters, or some bloodclaws, and sticking the lord with them.   That's why the great company formation is iffy. It needs to be almost perfect to be worth taking. You'd be better off running a standard CAD. That way all your troops get objective secured."

Warhammer40k,3degyf,minipump,10,Wed Jul 15 21:43:22 2015 UTC,"Out of curiosity did you love it for gameplay reasons, or just because it was a 40k shooter? I have a tendency to boost my opinions of 40k themed games just because they're 40k, even if the gameplay isn't all that great.   I enjoyed Space Marine all the way through, but if I wasn't a big 40k fan I don't think it would have kept my attention. Older Killzone games had far better graphics and a better Imperial feel than SM. The combat didn't seem all that exciting after a while either, and a lot of the later missions seemed to be filled with lots of walking between fight areas.   All I want is a game that is truly polished, and holds up against the production values of non 40k games!"
Warhammer40k,3degyf,Dollburger,14,Wed Jul 15 21:59:42 2015 UTC,"IMO, it's pointless to try and separate the mechanics from the lore and imagery. I loved Space Marines, but I would have loved it a lot less if it wasn't 40K."

Warhammer40k,3degyf,Hedonistic_Ent,5,Wed Jul 15 22:09:18 2015 UTC,"The combat was a mixed bag. On one hand it was meaty and felt appropriate to Space Marines - I particularly liked the seamless switch from chainsword to bolter for example. But what i didnt like were having to rely on execution attacks (usually in packs) to get health back - that became a pain in the ass.  And in the latter half of the game, the combat did feel repetitious as it was really quite simple.   Was a case of Warhammer 40k coloured glasses that improved the experience. I enjoyed it and wished there was a sequel also. The multiplayer was definitely underrated. Just a shame it didnt have dedicated servers, i was matched with Americans almost 100% of the time - felt horrible with such latency."
Warhammer40k,3degyf,Deepjay,1 point,Thu Jul 16 02:38:27 2015 UTC,"In the context of combat, I felt that they could have done something to show the supposed agility and toughness of space marines.   Borrowing some ideas from God of War would have helped."

Warhammer40k,3degyf,Deepjay,1 point,Thu Jul 16 05:17:34 2015 UTC,"Most certainly, I don't mean to say that space marines should be flipping out like ninjas either, just that they could use more nimble moves."
Warhammer40k,3degyf,Frostea,1 point,Thu Jul 16 05:24:24 2015 UTC,Both. I bought it because it was 40k and liked it because I thought it was genuinely good - albeit short.

The teaser trailer doesn't tell us much, except that whoever made it is decent at CGI and that the character shown in it (who may or may not be the player character) is not a very subtle man. I mean, those tattoos? Undercover work must be hard for him.  I'd be up for a Mass Effect 2 - style game about the Inquisition. Specters in that universe are more or less the equivalent of that after all."

Warhammer40k,3degyf,rabidsi,3,Thu Jul 16 00:46:23 2015 UTC,The fact that you've never heard of them does not make them a no-name studio.  Which they aren't.  They're solid devs with a history of well received games and post-release support and expansion.

You are allowed to name any detachment as your primary, meaning that your Warlord is chosen from it, as long as it doesn't have a restriction (like the Allied Detachment).

Warhammer40k,3dina9,The_Power_of_Tacos,2,Thu Jul 16 17:19:23 2015 UTC,"There are a ton of ways to get into the lore from different angels.  The most obvious is to read books set in the world. Most book stores will have a section in SciFi for series like 40k/warhammer/forgotten realms. From there you can grab the books that interest you. If I was going to reccomend authors that write for 40k look for books from Dan Abnett or Graham Mcneill. Those are my 2 favorites though I have enjoyed books in the 40k world from other authors.  Next you could check out different sites with lore. There are a couple good ones.  http://wh40k.lexicanum.com/wiki/Main_Page warhammer40k.wikia.com/ 1d4chan.org/wiki/Warhammer_40,000 (not as serious but still fun)    There are a number of 40k Based video games (Dawn of War 1/2, Space Marine, etc). These can give you some good lore.  Lastly you can buy the Rule book set for the 40k game and/or a codex for the armies you like. This has the dual benefit of giving you great lore and pictures as well as being able to be used for the game if you decide to get into it down the line. It can be expensive but remember you can get into it slowly instead of buying all in at once. A $30-$50 purchase once ever 3-6 months isn't that bad and it gives you time to assemble and paint between purchases.   Check at your local game store and see if they have a night/club for 40k and just head over. Most people are more then happy to show a new guy the ropes and talk about 40k till they are blue in the face ;)."

Warhammer40k,3ddzrm,Candida_Albicans,2,Wed Jul 15 19:21:42 2015 UTC,I spray it on with an air brush for lighter chipping and paint it on for heavy. Let it dry fully. This is the most important part. It has to have time to create that layer of space. I usually play it safe and go a couple hours to dry. Then I use hot water and a rough brush and just strip away. I usually brush the direction I want the scratches to be. I also use a plastic bristle brush to create the dotted areas that look like what I imagine stubber fire to look like. If you look at the left side of the turret. That's how I got that effect.

I think the Ad Mech would work pretty cool with them possibly. Maybe they are working with them to get closer to that contemptor dreadnaught suit. Although I can't think of a reason for the Hoplites to need the Ad Mech. They seem to have all the resources they need. Perhaps they want them to help learn about the Watcher so they could repair it if anything ever went wrong.
Warhammer40k,3ddyqi,garrettcolas,1 point,Thu Jul 16 02:33:22 2015 UTC,"Hi thanks for taking the time to do that :) my guys are generally preeeeetty apprehensive about working with the Admech due to being suspicious that they're going to try to tinker and reverse engineer the watcher and leave the Hoplites stranded in the halo stars once more, as well as impede on other technologies that the people of the Persephocles Empire have access to from the dark age of technology. There is a sect of the Ad Mech who work very closely with us, but are extremely decentralised from Mars."

Black Library:  Daemonifuge - the adventures of a Sister of Battle - Definately one of the best I've read,but be warned that this series is currently incomplete, and leaving readers with a huge cliffhanger.  Titan - Follows the story of a Warlord Titan crew  Bloodquest - Classic Blood Angels adventuring in the Eye of Terror  Unofficial Webcomics: - That I really enjoy (mostly for the art)  Unofficial Space Wolve / Sister of Battle Webcomic  Unofficial Imperial Guard RolePlay vs. Tau Webcomic  There is also a recent one called Macragge's Honour, which takes place in the 30k during the Horus Heresy.

I've got a full codex review up that starts here (it's in 9 parts) that will touch on some of this: http://variancehammer.com/2015/05/05/eldar-codex-review-part-1-fluff-and-aesthetics/  I'll tell you from experience that playing a Wave Serpent heavy army is still a blast, if not quite as dominant as it once was. Dire Avengers are great with some of the new Formations, Fire Dragons are still their badass tank killing suicidal selves, etc.  You'll be far from disadvantaged. A MechDar list doesn't break out a lot of the toys that make Eldar really nasty these days, but unless you're doing tons of tournament play, this just means less opponents complaining about OP jetbikes."

Warhammer40k,3dhag5,mrsc0tty,1 point,Thu Jul 16 11:29:56 2015 UTC,"There are really 2 ways of going about it.  First one is fire line squads.  Get a shit load of fire warriors and park them on open area objectives and just shoot the shit out of anything that comes at you.  Simple and effective as long as the other list is also rather simple.  I run against Tau a lot and easily crush this list concept because fire warriors are relatively easy to scare and all I have to do is take MSU (multiple small units) to make the mass number of shots less effective.  So it's fun but very limited if your opponent knows what he/she's doing.  The list I think works the best is a suit based list with some riptides (if you have them).  Crisis suits, Broadsides, stealth suits, etc.  This list is very mobile and can easily get objectives and get out when needed and still have the packed power of the Tau.  Obviously you'll still need some fire warriors, but you throw them in some devilfish to secure the easy objectives that will give them plenty of space to shoot and use the suits to probe the enemy while staying completely out of charge range with suit charge moves.  If you give us an idea of what you have to work with we can provide a bit more guidance."

Warhammer40k,3dhag5,Rx52,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:55:01 2015 UTC,"If you want good (or competitive) games you'll want some mobility for scoring. Farsight enclaves is good for that with mono 23pt crisis suits who can deep strike onto objectives with objective secured.   Devilfish with disruption pods are fairly good.  Riptides should be the anchors of your line- mobile, cheapish, killy and very durable  You want to take some markerlights - I'd recommend a mark'o with marker drones, or skyrays or tetras rather than pathfinders because of durability and mobility.   Lastly broadsides are amazing for rate of fire and you will want some of these as a staple. Imo fire warriors just don't cut it in comparison to some other choices you have such as 5 man units of piranhas (yay free 10 man squad of gun drones) or sniper drones with an ethereal (yay 3 shots within 24"").

Warhammer40k,3dd4ql,CommodoreHaunterV,3,Wed Jul 15 11:16:36 2015 UTC,Haha! Probably not far off the truth...
Warhammer40k,3dd4ql,Tony223,9,Wed Jul 15 11:24:31 2015 UTC,"From the comments section here about the flesh bits:   ""I used vallejo model air flat tan, then model air skin tone sprayed downwards, reikland fleshshade followed by gw reikland fleshshade.

I really want to emulate this simple black and white Tyranid scheme when I finally get around to doing nidzilla... does anyone have any suggestions on how to achieve this awesome white (greyish) chitin tone?
Warhammer40k,3dd4ql,DAMbustn22,4,Wed Jul 15 09:46:14 2015 UTC,"It's actually a husband and wife team, she does the assembling and a lot of the base work, the husband does the bulk of the painting, but stays away from the camera."

Warhammer40k,3dd4ql,AetherGauntlet,1 point,Wed Jul 15 14:07:26 2015 UTC,"Is there meant to be any sort of shading/highlights on the armour? its just glossy black paint, like an undercoat. Are you sure this is  a finished model?"
Warhammer40k,3dd4ql,AetherGauntlet,3,Wed Jul 15 09:49:59 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's it - it's in her gallery here.  I'm aware it's just a glossy black finish on the carapace, owing somewhat I think to Giger's Alien - I like it; are you not keen?  I was asking about the chitinous layer though - the off-white / grey areas."
Warhammer40k,3dd4ql,Hellbreaker,3,Wed Jul 15 10:03:51 2015 UTC,"Yeah, not a fan, to me it just loses so much of the models detail. The black armour sections have so much detail that is almost completely hidden by not having any highlights/shading. I can appreciate the black on white and the cool blood/flesh tones around the mouth area but the painter hasn't spent much time or effort bringing out the details of the model. Its basically spray the model black, spray the chitin white, dab a light brown on the joints and paint the flesh bits with a flesh tone.   Seems like a really rushed model, the eyes aren't done, some of the flesh tones leaked onto the chitin and haven't been cleaned up, the base seems half painted, the list goes on. But to each his own, if you like it, roll with it, though i would advise trying to highlight/shade the armour somewhat as plain black often tends to look unfinished (as in you just undercoated and never got around to actually detailing the model)."
Warhammer40k,3dd4ql,GoldDragon28,3,Wed Jul 15 11:25:51 2015 UTC,"Cool - really appreciate your input. I see what you mean about picking out detail on the armour; I would definitely look at adding some highlights.  I think what I really like about her style is how effective the use of chiaroscuro is. Even though it's technically simple, it's dramatically effective. I agree some extra detailing would add more though."

I got advice from a friend that what I should do for that is put the colors (yellow, orange, red, white) on the mini and swirl them while still wet rather than layering them ... thoughts on that?"
Warhammer40k,3dex0g,just_some_Fred,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:05:09 2015 UTC,"Wet blending can be used to give you a nice gradual color transition, swirling it likr this just makes it look a little messy. Most glowing swords have a transition from dark to light outside in, so the edges and close to the hilt are darker, and the ridge (or groove in this case) being the 'hottest' part. Take a look at youtube tutorials for painting power swords for guidelines, you would just be swapping palette from the normal blue glow."

Warhammer40k,3dgiz5,PinkPezGod,6,Thu Jul 16 02:24:22 2015 UTC,Don't mix weapons on a unit. 1 purgation squad with psycannons the other with psilencers or else you just water down what each unit can do.
Warhammer40k,3dgiz5,SammyBecker,0,Thu Jul 16 02:42:49 2015 UTC,"If I do this, I feel like I should free the points to make each squad 3 psycannons and 1 psilencer"
Warhammer40k,3dgiz5,SammyBecker,4,Thu Jul 16 03:02:20 2015 UTC,"No, don't mix. If you shoot vehicles you have a pointless psilencer and if you want to down big monsters with force shooting 1 psilencer in each unit isnt gonna work."
Warhammer40k,3dgiz5,_hei,5,Thu Jul 16 06:35:40 2015 UTC,"Hey, I like it.  Just be careful though.  You have a ton of 2+ or 3+, all T4, and most of them will have no transports / will not be in transports for very long.  Because of that, you are going to be facing down a lot of lists that can deal with all of these things well and (even in casual games) cause some problems.  First off, you only have one big threat on the table after deployment: the Land Raider.  Everyone will target it first.  Grav, Melta, Lascannons, you name it; it's going to be shot at that Raider until it explodes, wrecks, or immobilizes.  After that, the Rhinos will be mince meat.  Secondly, you have a lot of exposed Deep Strikers.  They drop down, shoot some stuff, and then (like the Land Raider) will have each and every gun pointed in their general direction until they start to lose their footing on the table.  Not a huge problem, but from my experience with Deathwing, not one that helps with winning.  It's definitely fun though.  And lastly, you've got some mobility issues later on (also kind of like Deathwing), where you Deep Strike and you are left walking around.  Not a huge deal, but it can hurt you if you're not already near objectives / the objectives are spread out.    But honestly, it looks pretty cool and fun, and definitely not what you usually see for GK.  Good for you.  You may want to check out some Deathwing Battle Reports (there are a good few on Miniwargaming's YouTube), since they have Land Raiders and lots of Terminators, just so you can get a feel for how an army like this plays.  But also realize: Deathwing cost way more than your guys (44pts a model).  Deathwing automatically arrives on Turn 1 for those battle reports.  You will have to roll for reserves.  Deathwing also get TL weapons on the turn they arrive, you do not.  So keep that in mind if you do watch those battle reports."
Warhammer40k,3dgiz5,_hei,2,Thu Jul 16 02:45:18 2015 UTC,"Very insightful! Thank you! I will watch some of their videos and maybe make some tweaks. Whatever happens though, I have a feeling this is going to be fun to play"
Warhammer40k,3dghor,FortressTortoise,3,Thu Jul 16 02:13:34 2015 UTC,"Head to your flgs(friendly local game store). Read the rule book, pick an army, get some models, put them together, pick a fight."
Warhammer40k,3dghor,Aemtyheaded,3,Thu Jul 16 03:47:56 2015 UTC,"As a relatively new player (Compare to people who have played this for over 10+ Years), I have experienced multiple times where I quit and then get back to 40k throughout the past 6 years.    For short answer, just buy Dark Vengeance starter set and be done with it. However, not everybody like Space Marine or Chaos, and it may look like a waste of money. EXCEPT it is not. For about ~120 bucks, you get a handy rulebook, 3 templates and a handful of dice. Even if you don't expect to play Space Marine or Chaos in the future, this set is still a good deal for starters to begin.        I have a few suggestions for players to pick up the game now, it will save you a lot of effort and money, but still have fun in this game.       Tips - Buy a Codex before you buy miniatures. - If you have a friend, buy Dark Vengeance starter set, it has everything you need to start playing the game. - Simply search Warhammer on google map, it should help you to locate your nearest store. - If you like an Army, read about their tactica on Internetz, it should give you a general sense on current meta. - Plan your list before purchasing, and post on forums for veterans to examine and give you some advice. - Go to your local store, observe some games. - Take your time on building models. - Talk to your opponents after the game, most players are nice and would love to point out mistakes for you.       Hope this helps, and good luck on your journey to endless pit of money dumping hobby Warhammer 40K"
Warhammer40k,3dghor,Tsumugi123,1 point,Thu Jul 16 04:43:59 2015 UTC,"Buy a Codex before you buy miniatures.   Nothing worse than putting a tactical squad together with all the special weapons and then reading the codex and finding that's illegal.   If you like an Army, read about their tactica on Internetz, it should give you a general sense on current meta.   Definitely do this; it will stop you from buying a bunch of cool looking Dark Eldar before realising they're rather fragile and difficult to use, especially for a beginner. It will also allow you to find an army that has a style of play you want and save money over buying something that you don't like the play-style of."

Warhammer40k,3dghor,Asx32,2,Thu Jul 16 05:37:38 2015 UTC,About two years ago I hadn't played a game in so long. Then a Games Workshop store opened up locally and it's a brilliant place to go do some hobby and meet other players.

I own a Hookah bar in my home town and noticed that 50% of the people who walked through my front door were coming to take part in some nerd hobby or another.  I grew up playing TCGs and tabletop RPGs so I knew my way around the scene.  Then Warhammer started taking off in town and I quickly started to get into that.   I decided to branch out and put a game store in the front of my business.  Games Workshop was by far the easiest company I've ever worked with.  I called them up and told them what I wanted to do and in response they sent me a Dark Vengeance set, a how to paint book, basic paint set, some copies of WD and Visions, and some sweet display swag gratis.  Now I'm doing special orders while getting people into the hobby by letting them paint and play the house set.    The basic display setup costs only about 2.5k and after that BOOM, you're a hobby store."

Warhammer40k,3dghor,Amayasu,1 point,Thu Jul 16 10:40:51 2015 UTC,"from a lore standpoint i had always read that starting with the inquisitor series is best because its hard to really grasp the magnitude of what happened during the heresy if you aren't familiar with the universe.  With that said, i didn't start reading the books until well after i was into the game and i started with the HH books and loved them.  As far as picking an army, go with the ones you like the look of the best.  Despite what you may read on the internet, every army can be fun so don't worry too much about picking a 'good' army vs a 'bad' one."
Warhammer40k,3dd68y,Kerokai,3,Wed Jul 15 10:03:04 2015 UTC,Fill those seams and smooth those model lines.  That is a good clean clean base paint job.  Get that army base painted and then come back unit by unit and finish them off with shading and detail work.

They're thin paints that pool in recesses to add depth to your model.  Your brush work is quite neat, and white is hard so you've done well, but try and grab some Nuln Oil for those metal tones, for example."

Warhammer40k,3dg4m5,DiscoHippo,3,Thu Jul 16 03:50:09 2015 UTC,Necrons Decurion has to go. Same with Eldar power levels. Also Tau overwatch sucks hard.   Basically make CC armies not suck.

I dont think Ive won any games with them with the new codex.   Im disapointed with how many armies have become ""streamlined"". Basically taking away a lot of unique rules and items that made several armies more interesting to play. It makes each army easier to get into, but also makes them bland and uninteresting. I see this a lot with Dark Eldar and Orks and its a bit underwhelming when you see someone take a piece of wargear or a vehicle that was once near impossible to hit then it falls apart like paper in a hurricane."

Warhammer40k,3dg4m5,Darth_Nitsua,2,Thu Jul 16 03:58:39 2015 UTC,Have you had much problems with full BS overwatch?  I've only had the chance to play one game so far and that was against eldar so I only got charged by banshees who ignored the overwatch anyways.  I'm excited to see how it goes against something like space wolves but if it's blatantly overpowered I think the regular BS 2 buff to units with grim resolve would be the balanced version.
Warhammer40k,3dg4m5,Lokistale,1 point,Thu Jul 16 05:12:08 2015 UTC,"Well you charge into a tactical squad or a Dev squad. They suddenly get all their shots at full BS with bolters or any specialist weapons they may have in there. In this case, he brought a plasma gun and a combi-plasma. Knowing he got full BS on over watch and can absolutely wreck his target on a charge. I was playing him with my Ultramarines, because of the over watch shots being at full BS. Those 4 plasma hits along with his 18 rapid fire bolter shots reduced to him to 1 wound on charge. The only reason he didn't die was because I got really lucky with my armour saves."

I think it's offset by the fact that assault marines are absolute trash and a big tax to take even one squad. It's an interesting rule that basically made me more cognizant about how I positioned models.  In the end, if you're assaulting with multiple units, you're typically sacrificing one unit anyway to absorb the overwatch. This just changed it from ""one hormagaunt gets in"" to ""okay they're dead but they did their job.""  Dark Angels are still pretty poor at assault against assault armies, though. They need that full BS and Ravenwing multioverwatch to keep you at bay."

Daemons pay 40 points per shot of these damn powers, and CSM pay more like 80. Plus the models that get them are useless in CC. They should not be six goddamn heavy bolter shots or a frag missile that makes the target stronger. And they should DEFINITELY not all have 24"" range.

Depending on what you want to do and how competitive you want to be, you can shuffle it around, but this seems like a fun list. Personally I'd run either the 3 avengers in their shrine formation, or 2 of the avenger squads and the dragons in an aspect host. The aspect warriors would also probably make better use of the transports, but again, that's up to you and what you want to achieve with this list.

Warhammer40k,3dgqo4,Naladari,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:19:58 2015 UTC,I would for sure put the fire dragons in a wave serpent they are most effective of they are mobile. You get a lot of utility from the platform which can move 6 inches per turn and still fire.  If you are running the atarch solo. Give him warp jump  generators or a bike over swooping hawk wings. I run mine with my warp spiders personally getting that jump on fire keeps him safe and insures my +1/-1 on reserve rolls
Warhammer40k,3dgqo4,ANakedBear,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:48:32 2015 UTC,"The Guardians should walk and the Avengers should be in the serpents.  Also, the Fire Dragons should be in one of the serpents as well.  Group two of the avenger squads together or divi it up to make a squad of 7 and a squad of 8.  The Altarch having the wings but no one to hang out with leaves him a juicy target.  keep him with a squad and have him break off if he needs to.    Personal preference is to have the cannon upgrade to the under-slung gun on the vehicles.  Also, you would get a lot of mileage from some Warlocks with the defenders and a Farseer."
Warhammer40k,3dgqo4,droober86,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:05:22 2015 UTC,1) I'd take a banshee mask over mandiblasters on the autarch.  No overwatch is pretty important for low T average armor save models.  Also why does the autarch have the wings?  running her solo is a huge risk (she will be instant deathed by something).  running her with any of your other units is a waste of the wings.  2) get those fire dragons in a transport.  They will do approximately nothing just left to slog towards a target.
Warhammer40k,3dgqo4,intraspeculator,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:35:16 2015 UTC,"With Eldar you can take just about anything and have a fun game.

This gets you close to a warhost. Drop 2 Vypers and get a War Walker and a Support Battery. Now you get your heavy weapons platforms for free. Take the EML for sky fire and versatility. Put the Fire Dragons in a Wave Serpent and drop the spare squad of Dire Avengers. Give each squad an Exarch and you have an Aspect Shrine. Give your Wraithlord 2 Bright Lances and keep him at the back as heavy support and use him to defend against any backfield threats.  Of course you don't have to do any of this. Your list was fine, but you had very little anti tank. The Fire Dragons and at a push the Avatar were all you had. Eldar have tons of Anti Infantry with all their blade storming. My list has tons of AT as well."
Warhammer40k,3depw7,TheLastShadow,2,Wed Jul 15 18:14:42 2015 UTC,"This is a pretty good base for an infantry-blob style army. You can aim for a final army that looks something like this (I don't have my book handy so I'm not sure exactly how many points this will be, but probably around 1500):   Company Command Squad with Mortar and Astropath Platoon Command Squad with 4 special weapons, melta or plasma (these guys will ride in your Valkyrie) 3-4 Infantry Squads with special weapons in each and a single Priest or Commissar to lead the whole group Another infantry platoon like the one above 1 or 2 anti-tank heavy weapon squads, with weapons based on what kinds of armies are popular in your local meta but probably autocannons or lascannons 2 Leman Russes as heavy support 2 veteran squads in Chimeras. Hold these guys in reserve or out of LOS to use as a counter-attacking element when big enemies show up that your infantry blobs can't deal with.   That army is almost entirely based around what you have, and doesn't have any glaring weaknesses. In terms of what to get next, I'd say play a few games and try to figure out what your weak spots are. Picking up a Wyvern or two never goes amiss however."

Running two large infantry platoons backed up by vets acting as armored fist squads will give you a rock solid force that will be hard to move and give you a lot of room to pick you fights carefully with the Hammer part of your army.  With out knowing how the other models are equipped your tanks can do a lot of work on thinning heavy infantry.  The only problems over all that I see is heavy tanks or flyers.

Warhammer40k,3den60,_hei,4,Wed Jul 15 17:56:04 2015 UTC,MSU can mess with units like that.  Feed them small or medium sized fearless units and tie them up in combat.  They hit hardest on the first round but fall off in subsequent rounds.  If they get tied up they won't do much.

Warhammer40k,3den60,ReaperOfCaliban,3,Wed Jul 15 19:50:00 2015 UTC,"Combat squad so they can't kill whole squads of big guns.   Like others have said, multiple small units are better because they can only kill at most 1 per turn, which makes you survive a lot longer.  Also if you are DA, try using the flying vindicator, it can sometimes become  a S:D vortex. Even if it doesn't, the S10 large blast will cause quite a few wounds."

Warhammer40k,3den60,Wine3,3,Wed Jul 15 21:42:55 2015 UTC,"Bubble wrap your expensive units if possible. Even when charging he has to stay 1"" away from your models that he isn't in close combat with so you can block the path to the expensive unit with a cheap unit or a transport.   Disordered charges can get around that, but RAW includes some very specific instructions as to how you charge which can make it impossible to charge a further back unit as well as the one screening it."
Warhammer40k,3den60,mutten006,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:20:00 2015 UTC,"Combat squad everything, so if they charge they can only charge a really small unit."
Warhammer40k,3den60,mutten006,4,Wed Jul 15 20:39:05 2015 UTC,"Just play for objectives.  Like others have said MSU (multiple small units) is a great tool against something like this.  Force them to go after one at a time by spreading them out and take objectives.  If he wants to kill units make him take a shit load of shots and overwatch to do it and you may get lucky, you may not.  If not you still have a far better shot at getting objectives AND he is quite unlikely to defeat so many units during a whole game.    So unless you are doing a kill points game then you are set, and if you are then set yourself up to put them in killzones after they charge.  A unit may die but make them pay for the movement.  It's all about punishing actions.  What kind of list do you have, maybe a model list can help us help you with building something to cover some more bases."
Warhammer40k,3den60,satanic_pony,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:08:07 2015 UTC,"Yea that makes good sense.  I guess it's just hard watching your models die hoping you can win by objectives.   I generally run a RW list (4-6 squads of 3 bikes, 2-3 individual attack bikes, and 2-3 land speeder typhoons) with a small DW contingency force (2 squads with 2x TH/SS and assault cannon).  The list has very little long ranged shooting, so it has been difficult to find a way to keep throwing shots down range without getting charged.  The list does have the advantage with MSUs, but due to the close range and large model size of bikes, clumps them if they try to shoot at the same target."
Warhammer40k,3den60,satanic_pony,6,Wed Jul 15 20:18:17 2015 UTC,"Yea you may have to expand a bit to beat the TWC build.  You're running something that is inherently kind of weak to what he's running haha.  Have to swap some things up imo.  I'd likely do a couple TAQ squads in rhinos to hold objectives since that gives you a cheap way to stall.  Stall some drop pods or something later on to plant in behind him forcing him to run back and forth to cover the ground he needs to track you down.  If you are desperate simply move around and take objectives he isn't at and preserve the ones you can get.  Remember that if you are using a turn not shooting to ensure that he doesn't charge, that's a shit load of points of his army just running around doing nothing, while you're grabbing other objectives.  Sadly the nature of the game to beat something like this is either bring in a shit load of longer ranged high damage weaponry or deal with your units dying but savoring the overall victory lol."

Orks & daemons cant really do lots of str 5+, but they like assault enough that it doesn't matter.   I know it's counterintuitive to not think about AP value, but you gotta forget about it to kill thunderwolves. A meltagun is less half as good as an autocannon in that case.  And remember that those units are so expensive that you can bring 3-4 squads worth of artillery to kill them without getting behind in points.

One just doesn't cut it y'kno? he rarely uses enough dice to make use of the warp 1  charge spells effectively, with 2 you can have a lot more fun and customization for not a large chunk of points or cash.  ONto the spells Divination seems best bet perhaps? You have Prescience for to hit rerolls as your primaris, you have foreboding to make his charges hurt him ALOT, forewarning can help tarpits become even more annoying, perfect timing probably wouldn't do much here...but ignore cover always has a use. Misfortune is amazing for when you are pouring tons of fire onto one unit. Scriers Gaze..is what it is.  For non divination you get to look at  Biomancy - You have Enfeeble / Endurance / Haemorrhage and smite is pretty nice if all else fails  Telepathy - Psyhic Shriek is sexy when good rolls happen, and yeah you are aiming for Invis on this...the Psyhic shriek is ""well i didn't get invis, lets hope this works!""

Warhammer40k,3den60,Sawyer_Zavy,1 point,Thu Jul 16 10:02:35 2015 UTC,They don't argue it because they don't read the whole codex.   I wouldn't call it an interpretation. The rule for the thunderwolf mount itself specifically states that the bonuses are already included in the TWC profile. That makes them no different to a wolf lord who has purchased a TWM.   It's basically TWC marines that have been upgraded with TWM to make them TWC. It's like marines on bikes. The toughness 5 is included in their profile but their base toughness is still 4.
Warhammer40k,3den60,DaveO1337,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:10:25 2015 UTC,Characteristics are taken from the data slate like always. The explanation of thunderwolf is incidental. This is my opinion of course.
Warhammer40k,3den60,spacebird_matingcall,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:20:07 2015 UTC,That's fine but its always going to fall back to TWM being wargear that is providing a statline increase and must comply with multiple modifiers. I don't see how core rules can be bypassed.
Warhammer40k,3den60,DaveO1337,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:30:27 2015 UTC,"They way I see it is that a core rule/basic rule is not being ignored, its a non starter. The explaination given in the codex is poorly written, but incidental.   The datasheet shows clearly the S value for thunderwolves and other mounted characters. This is why hammer of wrath is resolves at S5.  The codex explanation is irrelevant when the appropriate information is given through the convention channel."
Warhammer40k,3den60,spacebird_matingcall,2,Thu Jul 16 21:35:51 2015 UTC,I agree that the wording is atrocious. But it's GeeDubs so nobody is surprised.   And the HoW thing is just as poorly done in the rules. I'd agree that HoW is at S5 seeing as they wouldn't have the rule without being on the wolf in the first place. But for guys like death company it's definitely S4 as HoW ignores furious charge.   They may reword it clearly for the next codex but I have to stick to my guns on the multiple modifiers rule for 7E.
Warhammer40k,3den60,DaveO1337,2,Thu Jul 16 21:44:38 2015 UTC,Cool man. good chat though.
Warhammer40k,3den60,Sawyer_Zavy,0,Thu Jul 16 21:47:39 2015 UTC,They're S4 base that's modified to S5. They follow the rules for multiple modifiers which is (Sx2)+1. The mount is a piece of wargear so has to obey that rule.   A lot of people just assume it's S10 but if you actually read the codex and rulebook it's clearly S9.
Warhammer40k,3den60,DaveO1337,2,Thu Jul 16 02:06:34 2015 UTC,Good call man.  I don't think that's going to make a huge difference though lol.

Warhammer40k,3de0k7,Cl1ckBa1t,7,Wed Jul 15 16:02:12 2015 UTC,To be fair with the 2015 releases having turned up the power to 11. A riptide or two isn't that big of a deal. As always the power of the units you bring should reflect the opponent your facing.

Really, it's not a huge deal though. There is still a danger of teleporting onto an enemy unit or where you otherwise can't deploy, so deep striking is not risk free. I'd just not worry about it."

Warhammer40k,3dedd8,Al_Cinnah,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:02:12 2015 UTC,A cheap & easy way to make a play table that is compact and portable (out of the wife's way) is to look for an old door that's close to the right dimensions and lay it across some sawhorses.  Of you really want to go all out you can terrain and texture it.  This is what we use at my store for all our games.  Different tables can even be put together for larger games or for smaller you can elect to use only half.  All the doors we used I pulled out of a dumpster behind an apartment building that was being renovated.

Over all, you need some more ranged bite to the list.  I feel you'll have problems against an army that is as mobile or more mobile then you.  Double if they are mechanized and stay in their tanks.

Warhammer40k,3deul4,ANakedBear,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:59:08 2015 UTC,"The question on the typo was you mixing the weapons.  Why not have one squad with a gravgun and combi grav and the other with meltagun and combi melta.    A Lascannon Predator should do the trick, and the Lascannons on the Razorbacks will be a great addition.    I don't remember the rules for the Damocles Rhino.  I get what you are going for with the Orbital Bombardments, but even in a friendly game, it feels like a waste.  In a larger game it should be quite useful.    The extra lascannons should help you crack the nuts to get the soft bits that your bikes will eat up."

I can see this being really tricky to balance though. The -2 to armour saves disease is a bit rediculous; terminators have a hard enough time being viable as it is. Eldar currently have a randomly generated power WC 2 that gives a -1, and even that's pretty powerful. -2 as a passive effect is obscene, and grey knight players would punch you for suggesting it.  And while I admit daemon princes need a bit of a powering up, the statline you've given yours should put him at ~350 points before upgrades. You may want to scale that back or increase the cost, unless everything else is scaled forward appropriately in your game"

The point of the game, as far as GW is concerned, is that you should be playing balanced take-all-comers lists, not death stars or spam heavy lists. The psychic phase is as much a part of this plan as Superheavies, fortifications and formations are. If you don't prepare for all possibilities in your list, you risk getting hosed. Your friends have the points and the ability to use allies to balance any of their weaknesses. It's their choice whether or not to leave a gaping hole in their list. Folks who complain that one aspect of this balance ruins their idea of a list are folks who want to run a very specific kind of list and want it to do well, game design be damned. If this were 5th edition, in which there were no such things as allies, their concerns would be valid. But it ain't. They can bring titanic walkers, librarian conclaves, 3+ cover save bunkers, or minmaxed mixes of various races to generate whatever effect on the game they want.  It's like complaining that a baneblade forces them to take melta, when they want to run heavy bolters. Tell them to man up and adjust their lists. But do so politely.  You might also suggest they run an allied Farsight Enclaves list with the talisman of Arthas Moloch as a giant middle finger to anything you do."

Also many armies don't have effective means to manage psykers so it feels a bit narrow sighted to say ""come prepared for everything"" when you don't have any options outside some lame use of allies ( . I get your message but it reads as ""Learn 2 Play"".  Psychic powers in general are fine but things like blessings are incredibly difficult to deny compared to witch fires which are fairly lack luster. Many blessings aren't game breaking (prescience is a commonly picked but not over the top) but some (like invisibility) are stupidly strong and happens to be the hardest type of power to stop. Also psykers tend to result in a feast or famine situation where armies with lots of psykers can cast lots of powers and it's difficult to stop (which is fine) but a lone psyker vs GK, Eldar, or daemons will almost never get a power off because they get bullied by volume of dice (which is problematic for low psyker armies). It makes sense but it just becomes a case of why bother bringing 1 psyker when the enemy has 6 as your better off not taking any. Again it's not an ideal situation but in itself it's not game breaking.  OP's friends shouldn't really complain about psykers as they aren't horribly broken unless it's a case of OP running some gimmic Death Star using invisibility."

And beyond that, I just finished painting my own pskyer to try to nullify the threat. At least slightly. 40k is an arms race, they gotta get with the program. And you gotta look at the whole picture. I bet you wish you could drop thunderfire rounds on your opponents but you can't.   Opposingly, they HAVE access to pskyers so I couldn't see how they would complain.

It takes a very large investment to make it do what you want, it's kind of clunky with all the rolls and counter rolls, and it can usually be defeated with good old fashion bolt guns.  I don't know what kind of shenanigans happen during your games, but if I were your opponents I'd be glad I was facing psychers rather than some real bullshit like super heavies and air forces."

For example, the Ork player, whom rarely actually loses games, complains all the time that his army moves backwards.

Warhammer40k,3dd0tq,Anggul,1 point,Wed Jul 15 12:58:11 2015 UTC,"Personally, as a Grey Knights player, I dislike the Psychic phase intently.  People who play against me (and aren't Eldar) feel that I can shut down most of their powers unless they throw in more than just one or two token Psykers, and won't be able to shut my powers down without a similarly large investment.  From my side of the board, I would like to be able to semi-rely on the fact I can get +2 strength, or that my force weapons will work, so in times like those, I throw three dice at it, but three dice is still far more unreliable than attempting to roll a 10 or less on 2d6.  The limitations compared to before actually mean that trying to get Hammerhand off on every single unit in a large army is almost impossible, and knowing that I'll be able to throw around two dice into each unit to guarantee they work means that I'll rarely be able to use my Librarian to his fullest when my army is in melee combat.  Overall I understand why they've done it, but as an army with so much revolving around the Psychic phase, I really wish that powers were more reliable. I don't mind throwing six dice at a Warp Charge 3 power, but to still only hit 50% success rate and deplete almost all of my psychic pool for that turn really hurts.  When playing Imperial Guard (my other army), I rarely if ever notice any of these complaints."

You might also take a look at Retributor Armor and Liberator Gold in place of Gehenna's and Auric Armor respectively. I don't have any personal experience with them as they just came out during the Age of Sigmar stuff, but it looks like Retributor might be a bit more brown where Gehenna is redder, and Liberator seems to have a bit more silver in it than Auric. (EDIT: Actually, looking at it in the video, I'd say to still use Auric as the layer, and use Liberator as the first edge highlight and Runefang as a thinner highlight over that.) You can see them being used in this video.  However, if you can get Vallejo Model Air Gold I highly recommend that. It's said to be the best gold out there, and even though it's an airbrush paint it goes on perfectly fine with a brush."

Warhammer40k,3d9crv,xKingNothingx,2,Tue Jul 14 20:20:37 2015 UTC,Do our vehicles still have IWND?
Warhammer40k,3d9crv,Blood_ForTheBloodGod,2,Tue Jul 14 15:50:25 2015 UTC,"They do. However, a strict RAW reading will find that only vehicles with Chapter Tactics have it, which is to say only dreadnoughts. I'm assuming that it's an oversight on GW's part, and have been giving IWND to all vehicles as normal on those occasions when I play IH."
Warhammer40k,3d9crv,Grubnar,3,Tue Jul 14 15:54:52 2015 UTC,That's exactly what I'm saying! I've called GW and they give you the exact answer you expect: talk about it with your mates. But they also said that in a tournament setting you're free to claim all your vehicles under the rule.  I think the reason the dreads have chapter tactics is so they can benefit from the tactical doctrines they gain from being part of the Gladius strike force (hence their inclusion in the Demi-company) and I really think I'm right.
Warhammer40k,3d9crv,covonia,3,Tue Jul 14 16:12:04 2015 UTC,"I would agree, though there are other benefits as well. Salamander rerolls on flamers and mastercrafted meltas are excellent with dreads, especially in drop pods. They were probably given CT because dreadnoughts, being walkers, are closer to being infantry than vehicles."

I'm not saying this from the position of GW getting the feel of the army wrong or this cool old school list (is one eye even in the new dex) not being fluffy, but just because I am butt hurt over having to paint more than twice this amount of models to get 1000pts game."
Warhammer40k,3dbibr,Jacers,3,Wed Jul 15 00:08:01 2015 UTC,"Not any better now, all you need is flyrants. :P"
Warhammer40k,3dbibr,kirk0007,1 point,Wed Jul 15 00:37:08 2015 UTC,The upgrades on gaunts (adrenal glands and devourer guns) really cut into the numbers. Could double then number if I didn't upgrade. Plus each genestealer is like three gaunts. I've never had a strong army because I like upgrades and never build a clean efficient list.

Warhammer40k,3dbibr,j0nosaurus,3,Wed Jul 15 03:08:34 2015 UTC,"I miss that carnifex design. The new one is cool, but that one is one of the first models I saw that got me into the hobby."
Warhammer40k,3dbibr,Galifrae,3,Wed Jul 15 03:08:49 2015 UTC,I like what GW have done in that the newer models are less humanoid and more alien. Still love that guy though! I think I prefer the newer hive tyrants and tyranid guard.

Warhammer40k,3dakpg,Blood_ForTheBloodGod,5,Tue Jul 14 23:33:53 2015 UTC,Yes there is a Forge World and it is key to the system its called Prandium Majoris.  Take a look at our site and feel free to sign up and be sure to get your friends to sign up the more the merrier.  i can promise you the GMs wont have any more influence then any other player to determine the final result out side of re-balancing rules if needed.

If you get a local shop or game group involved youll have more then enough players.  If the last few years have taught us anything is when you give players a reason the play even people that have not played in years will come out of the wood works to get involved.

Warhammer40k,3de4yv,Al_Cinnah,0,Wed Jul 15 15:46:09 2015 UTC,I don't think you will see rules for these specific models from GW. GW only makes rules if GW takes them in their line. Regarding your planeticket it would be much cheaper to let them ship them to you?
Warhammer40k,3de4yv,BertMacklinsdawg,2,Wed Jul 15 16:10:47 2015 UTC,A) He wants FW to post the rules. So I think he's aware GW won't be posting them.  B) I don't think they ship things from their physical store.
Warhammer40k,3de4yv,ReaperOfCaliban,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:13:05 2015 UTC,I didn't actually check FW for these rules just assumed they had since he said they did. You can order online and let them ship them to you...  Just checked FW If it hasnt released yet I wouldn't expect the rules to come closer to the release date.
Warhammer40k,3de4yv,BertMacklinsdawg,2,Wed Jul 15 16:21:01 2015 UTC,Anyone have an idea of when the Chaos Knight rules will be formally available   they aren't available yet. Although they were show at the FW open day.   Also on a side note WTF forgeworld sell the conversion kit on your website    It's not online. Which is why he would have to fly to their physical store to pick it up.
Warhammer40k,3de4yv,ReaperOfCaliban,2,Wed Jul 15 16:25:38 2015 UTC,They go online when they release I think OP needs to be more patient ;)
Warhammer40k,3de4yv,BertMacklinsdawg,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:28:08 2015 UTC,Yes. I don't think he realizes they were only a preview. Much like the DA upgrades.

Warhammer40k,3dbx8q,uncleanone,4,Wed Jul 15 02:29:58 2015 UTC,We figured it meant that but just wanted to get clarification. Thanks!
Warhammer40k,3dbx8q,Anggul,2,Wed Jul 15 03:15:27 2015 UTC,Yes but only if you roll a one on the mishap. It would be brutal if you just auto-died when scattering off the table.
Warhammer40k,3d98tj,Rustyeh,5,Tue Jul 14 14:22:55 2015 UTC,The gaunt coming out of that sac is fucking COOL. How do you make it look all gooey like that?
Warhammer40k,3d98tj,Savandor,2,Tue Jul 14 15:37:25 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the compliment! :) I first painted it like I would normally paint my gaunts. Also making some details with Screamer Pink. Then made a mix of Wazdakka red paint, bloodletter glaze and some water so that its running. Then splashed it all over the gaunt and the hole. Then I let it dry off and just pretty much dunked the whole thing in 'Ardcoat."
Warhammer40k,3d98tj,Walkemb,2,Tue Jul 14 21:08:13 2015 UTC,No thanks. I'll just stay here in the 21st century. That is way too spooki scary.  That new born look on the gaunt is astonishingly good.

Warhammer40k,3dc8gk,Darth_Nitsua,1 point,Thu Jul 16 05:23:38 2015 UTC,I just kind of winged it. I looked at other terrain types for ideas then raided the recyclable bin at my work and a few bucks at the dollar store and hobby shop.

Warhammer40k,3d92qu,PandaMango,3,Tue Jul 14 13:32:14 2015 UTC,"Hey guys,  Just need your thoughts on this conversion. In my fluff Humans who are militarily brilliant way into adulthood (far beyond the age where the transformation into a space marine would be possible) are pumped filled with steroids and genetically altered to become massive lumbering giants who excel at close combat. Lacking all the augmentations of a space marine, these guys become more like Ogryns in power.  To have the augmentations is considered a great honour, but it puts such a strain on the human body that a lifespan of no more than 15-20 years can be expected once undertaken, often seeing them thrown into the fiercest battles, their tales to become enshrined in the Hall of Legends deep within the fortresses of Hoplites territory.  The model is just for show and would have no rules In 40k, let me know your thoughts :)"

Warhammer40k,3dbsw2,Werxes,4,Wed Jul 15 01:24:10 2015 UTC,Pretty easy to make out of... pretty much anything you have lying around.  I think the best thing to do is go to your local hardware store and have a piece of plexiglass cut to size.  Should cost you a couple dollars.

Warhammer40k,3dcsec,mistersunshin,2,Wed Jul 15 06:52:38 2015 UTC,Shoota boyz are actually better at mathhammer.
Warhammer40k,3dcsec,hells_gullet,1 point,Wed Jul 15 08:11:37 2015 UTC,Better how? I don't understand how one extra BS2 attack beats out one extra WS4 attack. What am I missing?
Warhammer40k,3dcsec,rh8938,1 point,Wed Jul 15 09:19:00 2015 UTC,"Range, Overwatch, you kill them before they reach you."
Warhammer40k,3dcsec,mannotron,1 point,Wed Jul 15 09:59:05 2015 UTC,"When you're rolling 40-60 dice (depending on the size of your mobs), you tend to find that at 5+ to hit, quantity has a quality all of its own.    The general math consensus is that while Slugga/Choppa boyz are among the best CC unit in the game for the points, they tend to get horribly shot up by the time they can actually get to charge, reducing the actual amount of attacks they might get to roll.  And they need to charge to do well.  Meanwhile, Shoota boyz roll a ridiculous amount of dice and, as they should ideally be camping objectives or supporting fire, don't take the same amount of casualties before being forced into CC.  And with Overwatch, even with a 6+ to hit, they're going to be removing models from the attacking unit and ideally giving them a fairly significant numerical advantage in CC.  Somebody over at /r/warhammer did the math:  https://www.reddit.com/r/Warhammer/comments/2ovgwd/shootas_vs_sluggas_part_ii_da_bigga_pikcha/"
Warhammer40k,3dcsec,mannotron,1 point,Wed Jul 15 11:10:35 2015 UTC,"So its really more of a flexibility issue then.  Slugga boys seem like they're genuinely terrible unless they get into charge range. Once they do, well, hulk smash. Shootas are still better than most non-dedicated melee units in close combat for the points if they get the charge, but are at least competent ranged units to boot?"
Warhammer40k,3dcsec,mannotron,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:36:36 2015 UTC,"Shootas are actually much better if they receive the charge, as they get to overwatch/snapshot.  Then they're actually pretty solid in CC because, you know, Orks.  But otherwise, you've got the idea.    In a general, overall sense Shootas are better, but Sluggas have their role.  Use your shoota boyz to take and hold objectives and provide supporting fire while your sluggas tear upfield towards whatever unit you need dead or tarpitted.  Orks are capable of closing that gap with terrifying speed."
Warhammer40k,3dcsec,hells_gullet,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:07:34 2015 UTC,"Shootas are actually much better if they receive the charge, as they get to overwatch/snapshot.   I feel like I'm missing something here. You don't get snapshots/overwatch with pistols?  Oh, I think I was misreading the overwatch rules. It said a unit can only use overwatch fire once per turn and I thought it meant each model only gets one overwatch shot per turn. When you choose to make overwatch fire, a slugga should be geting one shot, a shoota two, a big shoota three, etc. Is that right?"
Warhammer40k,3dcsec,mrsc0tty,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:33:47 2015 UTC,"That's correct, in my understanding.  The overwatch rules in the BRB don't say anything about limiting the number of shots a weapon has, just that overwatch can only be used once per turn per unit, and they count as snap shots (6+).  Which in the case of BS2 Orks isn't much of a change.  Chances are you'll still roll a decent amount of 6s with a full unit of shoota boyz."
Warhammer40k,3dcsec,Sawyer_Zavy,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:33:02 2015 UTC,Overwatch and I2.  Every enemy you don't kill in the shooting phase is an enemy that gets two chances to kill you first (usually).
Warhammer40k,3dcsec,Vankraken,1 point,Thu Jul 16 00:58:13 2015 UTC,"Generally it goes like this:  Trukk Squad: Shoota boyz (might as well use that powerful open-topped rule to your advantage and drive-by people).   Foot Squad: Ard boy Choppas.   Green Tide: T-shirt Choppas.   Battlewagon Mob: T-shirt, pick either.   The real reason for shootas over Choppas is just how overkill Choppas tend to be in melee against most stuff. Anything a choppa boy would have trouble charging, shooting it isn't a bad idea.   Orks are actually not bad at shooting-if you like the shooting choices they've got available. You like S7-8? Awesome. You like S4-S5? They can offer that too. Want something else? Much trickier. Statistically, they shoot around the same points value as a Space Marine army, which is not shabby (2 shoota boyz = 1 SM in points and S4 hits). And our vehicles being open topped means everyone gets to unload."
Warhammer40k,3dcsec,notmuch_23,1 point,Wed Jul 15 11:56:01 2015 UTC,"Both versions of boyz are about equal, dont let people tell you one type is better. Honestly boyz in general just aren't what they used to be, they run away or kill themselves and its not usually worth it to field a lot of them unless it's with the greentide. I use a combination of both but typically more sluggas than shootas. Why? Because they are cheaper, more suited to the trukk assault that I like, they don't shoot themselves out of charge distance, and they take advantage of the new waaagh while shootas don't whatsoever. Again it totally depends on the list. Before the new codex came out I had huge success with 5+ trukk boy units but those days are gone. Take boyz to fill your troop requirement then look to the other great options orks have to fill in the rest of your army. Tankbustas, lootas, mek gunz, bikes, dakkajets, all good stuff. Also don't make that nob unit too expensive, eavy armour and a couple PKs is all you need. Any more expensive and your better off with MANZ."
Warhammer40k,3dcsec,notmuch_23,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:43:30 2015 UTC,"This is a copy paste of a post I made on dakka dakka about someone wanting to start an Ork army that could be somewhat competitive. I'm too lazy to re type this on my phone but the general advice is the same. About shoota boyz, they are good in that they shoot a large volume of fire into the enemy and then can charge in to deal even more damage in CC. They are better in battlewagon or 30 boy foot slogging squads while slugga boyz are better in trukks and in the green tide ( don't want to shoot 200 shots into a unit, kill it, and have nothing left to charge.)  ""Staying competitive with Orks means you need a structured game plan for your green boyz. Orks are rather weak when you just throw whatever on the table so they need a proper game plan to survive the trek across the table and getting into the enemy's face. The general Ork strategies are   Green Tide: 100+ boyz with a warboss made into a giant mob of foot slogging terror. Its a formation so you also take a small CAD to get a painboy to give everyone FNP. Its hard to pull this off in smaller games below 1250 as you won't have any anti air or ranged AV. Trukk spam: Lots of trukks with lots of boyz, tankbustas, meganobz, burna boyz, etc. Trukks are super fragile but they are cheap and get the boyz up field quickly into shooting/charging range. You spam lots of trukks to overwhelm the enemy so they can't kill all your trukks. Biker Gangs: Lots of warbikers riding around shooting and occasionally charging into the enemy. Warbikers are one of the most cost effective units in the Ork codex and they have a good mix of mobility, durability, shooting, and CC capability. Taking the forgeworld character Zhadsnark (its basically a warboss on a bike) lets you have warbikers as troops so you can flood the board with multiple smaller units of bikers (with objective secured if using a cad). Blitz Brigade: Using battlewagons to transport your Orks down field. The actual Blitz Brigade formation is 5 battlewagons but in low point games you would just take battlewagons in the heavy support slots. Being AV14 in the front they are incredibly hard to kill at range and each can hold 20 boyz. 2-3 battlewagons in a 1k point game is beyond the ability of any army (outside of list tailoring) to kill your wagons before they get close enough to unload your orky payload into close combat.   -Shooty Orks: This isn't really tournament capable but its an interesting way to play Orks. Lots of Mek guns, Lootas, Tankbustas, Flash Gitz, or other units that favor shooting over getting into CC. There is a formation that is 3 big meks, a weirdboy, and a warboss which lets you spam Shokk Attack Gun Big Meks which are incredibly powerful (if random) weapons. Basically you turn your army into a green..er version of the imperial guard.  -Dread Mob: All walkers all day. Ork walkers are rather lackluster in low numbers but they can do work well when they reach a critical mass. There is a Forge World detachment for them (you can get the rules for Free of the website) and a formation with the same name (not very good as it requires two gorka/morkanauts which are overcosted). The forge world rules are good as you can take killa kanz in the fast attack slot, deffdreads in the troop slots and in formations of 3 if so desired. Basically you bring so many walkers that they can't kill them fast enough and then the walkers can close the game and bring the hurt.  As if it wasn't made clear Orks are all about redundancy. If you want something done you throw a lot of orks at the problem until its dead. 1 ork is always bad but 20 are extremely deadly. Orks can't reliably hit anything with 1 shot so they tend to throw buckets of dice at the problem. When you want to survive getting across the battlefield you want as many of a similar thing to be going at the enemy. You can't rely on any one single unit (other than the mighty green tide) to make it across the field without being killed (its not hard to focus down a single ork unit) but when you have mass redundancy then it doesn't matter if you lose a unit or two because you have 5 more to finish the job."""

This allows you to have 1 hq and two elites as your compulsory as opposed to troops, allowing you a full dread only army. Bjorn and two standard dreads would fit in a 500 point list nicely, with some room for upgrades, or two venerable with a single drop pod. These three dreads (with the venerable upgrade) can also be taken as a formation from the book called the Brethren of the fell handed, this gives re rolls in close combat, a 5+ invun save and 5+ deny the witch"
Warhammer40k,3d9qu5,DTJ20,3,Tue Jul 14 18:36:56 2015 UTC,Yep this is the way to do it. 3 venerable's with 5++ should be scary to infantry heavy 500p lists.

As long as you go into it looking for a good time and maybe not to win, it'll be great!  Are you looking for a bound or unbound army?

Warhammer40k,3d9qu5,trippdawg1123,4,Tue Jul 14 17:49:31 2015 UTC,"Ah ok. I'll explain:  In Warhammer 40,000, armies come in 2 varieties: bound and unbound. Bound is also called ""battle forged"". In the rule book and codexes, there are things called formations and detachments, with detachments generally being lists of things you can bring in an army, and formations being a group of specific units. A detachment might say something like ""you must bring 1 HQ and 2 troops choices, and you may bring an additional 3 fast attacks, 3 heavy support, 3 troops and 2 HQ choices, and everything you bring in this detachment gets these benefits"". A formation might say ""you must bring an iron priest, a wolf priest, a rune priest and a wolf guard battle leader, and all of these units get these benefits"".   Bound lists are the generally accepted way to play except for purely fun games with friends, as they prevent a player from just bringing as many of the strongest unit as he can. Bound lists can contain as many formations and detachments as you want, as long as the units in the detachments and formations are below the set point value for the game.   Do you have the basic rule book or Codex: Space Wolves?"

Warhammer40k,3dban0,KeimaKatsuragi,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:06:55 2015 UTC,"Oh I was mostly making a joke... Since most, but not all, Crusades are usually requested to the High Marshal which then says ""Ye"" or ""Nah, don't wanna/I don't like you"". Basically all the Crusades happening need to at least be approved by the High Marshal, which makes sense since unlike Chapters with proper Librarians(or just.. normal ones?) he's the one responsible to know everything that's going on/as much of the Chapter's history as possible. I know the Inquisition doesn't like them. And of course the Templars wouldn't like the Inquisition. Unless the Inquisition needs to witches dead. I don't know the extent of what is known, as even the fluff says 'nobody really knows', but just like history and Crusades, the duty of knowing pretty much all that goes on (Ongoing Crusades and recruits becoming full Initiates, I would namely imagine) falls upon the High Marshal. He's technically supposed to keep track, at least in the job description. Whether he does or not is another story. The more lore you go through the less this role seems like a combatant and the more it seems like a father/guiding figure. Which makes perfect sense for a commander, and even more for the commander of a force this size, scattered light years about in every direction. A commander's primary role is to see the biggest picture and move accordingly, normally. While brave, it's dumb to send your Head right onto the frontline when unnecessary. Even the Zealous Templars know that.  I never noticed in previous Codexes, but I think it was in the new 10th Company formation's if not Scouts' entry (Just officially got the last book yesterday from the store so I didn't pay attention to everything) said that the Codex Astartes does not put ""a fixed limit"" on the number of men a Chapter's 10th Company can count. So one could read it as having an infinite number of would-be marines in training being completely legal. Templars don't have.. well.. the whole Ultramarines' company system, but technically their Neophytes are Scouts. So despite notoriously disregarding the Codex's ""Do Not's"", the Templars could maybe get away with it with a smaller number of full fledged Initiates and a great number of Neophytes. Who knows. It's not like they'd really try and get away with it to begin with... ""Yes. So what?"" would rather be the probable answer to the question.  Anyways I've fell in the bad habit of rambling again, please don't hold it against me :( Here's a really cute abhuman admiral to help you forgive me. I was going to upvote you already simply for the way you summed up the relationship between the Inquies and the Templies."

Warhammer40k,3dbpqr,CokeZeroPepsiOne,1 point,Wed Jul 15 00:59:36 2015 UTC,"1360 pts of deathwing isn't going to win you a table flank...not even close. Terminators arent that great... they are slow, they are big, they are expensive. I'd rather field an ENTIRE BATTLE COMPANY instead of fielding this deathwing formation.   Looking at your deathwing portion, you are repping about 500pts of models that wont be doing jack shit till turn 3 (Knights, master, chaplain). The rest of your guys are shooty yes, but frankly at 800 pts, you expect the shooting ability to guarantee squads are getting wiped off the table cough Fellblade Cough. Combine that with how awesome wave serpents are, and battlefocus, you probably aren't ever making it into close combat. That or a nice bunch of wraithguard, seer council, or just stupid psuedo rending shuriken guns are going to massacre your terminators. Sure TL shooting is nice, and deep strike no scatter is cool too, but it isn't as good as scouting ~ 60 marines, and letting loose 100+ bolter shots, with re rolls...and free ded transpos.   Also why are you running 3 HQs in the deathwing formation (this is the big question you should ask yourself if you want to optimize your list)? HQs are good yes, but you dont need 6 throughout your army. You are better off dropping the int chap, and hte term captain and grabbing a second landraider, or a pair of vindicators instead if you have the models. You need some better long range AT support. 2 lascannons are doing fuck all. 1 TL lascannon isn't doing much either.   Why are you not running a super heavy? (Not having one is a legit answer, cause money is moneys) but at 4k pts, you need, want and have the room for some big bad mother(s) to break things.   I would also look into grav weapons on bikes. by far the best weapon to choose, and actually make you very very scary against vehicles, and his wraithguard/knight. Grav bikes make Wraithguard their bitches...kind of. Wounding on 3's and firing like 6 shots at AP2 will make them question getting into 18"" of them.   If you want your command squad to get into combat, you have to throw them in the raider. Razorback charge is a turn 3 at best...which means a turn in the open to get shot at...I'm not sure about you, but I can fail 3+/3++ saves like no tomorrow.   Your combat squad tactic is not that great...there is nothing threatening to an eldar player or even another marine player about a ground pounding 5 man tac squad with a plasma pistol and special, especially when they are still 2ft or so away...its an obvious choice to shoot the rhino or shoot the bikes. If your opponent has even some remote sense of calm, this won't panic him.  Gotta be more devious...if you had a scouting rhino though then ok, now we are talking.  Have you considered vanilla marine allies? They honestly make up for a lot of the fallings of Dark Angels. Like Grav cents, more flexible and abusive chapter tactics, Stormwing formation and the fucking skyhammer annihalation force.   If you are really afraid of psychic powers, run the librarious conclave. Its relatively cheap, grants you a ton of powers, and some really epic casting abilities. Interomancy is a stupidly good doctrine. I would consider running it just for the 24"" mind worm. That wraithknight isn't so scary anymore."
Warhammer40k,3dbpqr,jimtheclowned,1 point,Wed Jul 15 02:47:18 2015 UTC,This list is pretty much my entire model collection so that's why they're are an unreasonable amount of HQs thrown in for some point saturation.   I've found the Knights to always do well and I've recently beaten a sky hammer formation so that was pretty cool. The formation only works when you've got the models to fill out those assault squads because 5 marines are only going to do so much. The real reason people bring the sky hammer is for the relentless grav cannons which are insane but I was able to weather the storm.   The terminators are in a weird position right now I think with losing DWA on turn 1. The added bonus of the two assault squadrons means I can clump those terminators together or spread them out across where the marines are coming. I keep the chaplain with the Knights because of the zealot bonus on the charge for extra damage on smite. If anything is cut the company master and add in more tactical squads with the CAD.   Truth be told I've only got the grav pistol from the assault kit. Dark Angels vet kit comes with absolutely nothing! I wish I could purchase grav weaponry easier to be honest I'm really thinking about getting the new Devastator kit for some grav cannons.   Say I cut out the termie command squad and the company master I could probably fit in a Knight Crusader but I'd have to buy the damn thing. But I think that would give me a really reliable back line fire platform while the terminators eat punches.
Warhammer40k,3dbpqr,jimtheclowned,1 point,Wed Jul 15 03:13:28 2015 UTC,"recasters or bits sellers on ebay for grav guns. I know one recaster had 3 for like $2 or so.  Skyhammer is more than just relentless grav guns, if you know what you are doing. Pod grav centurions with a libby is in all ways better, albeit slightly more expensive pts wise..although its kinda useless to use against dark angels and even more useless against deathwing. Forcing pinning checks at 3d6 is just lol.  Dark Angels vets were out before the most recent tac squad if memory serves, I think they are even older than the space wolves kits I remember thinking they were so awesome cause they had a power armoured storm bolter and robes...now the kit is blown completely out of the water by the sternguard set.   Shame that you need to use HQs to fill out the points. Maybe look into apocolypse formations and bonuses then? like Herculean feats or whatever they are called. Most of them can epically change the way a game is played...like Lysander gets a friggin vortex grenade...  Terminators did get better, but honestly I don't think they are game breaking levels of good. There are just way too many things you can get for 200pts that can be more flexible and give you a better outcome than 5 termies.  Have you also looked into scouts? with their new stat boost as well as same costs, running a butt load of scouts is a funny way to screw with opponents. 50 BS 4 bolters starting 12 inches away from you is a bit intimidating."

Warhammer40k,3dbibt,FrigginPandas,3,Wed Jul 15 00:01:52 2015 UTC,"DE rely heavily on their mobility in battle and with only 2 raiders this will be a challenge.  You can either go your way and wwp with wyches behind enemy lines, hopefully in some ruins or other terrain. Remember that the archon has haywire and plasma nades or the phantasm nade launcher. In the roster below you wwp him with 5 wyches that can either Look out Sir! for him or do the fighting as well. Just make sure you choose your opponents carefully as those wyches only have t-shirt saves. Kabalites in Raiders are always fun especially with splinter racks that make their splinter rifles twin linked. Get them within 12 inches of the enemy and rapid fire the shit out of them. You might as well put the wyches in a raider (to have that fast movement and a 3 shot desintegrator cannon which is sweet, heavy AP2 S8 gun) and get them swiftly to the enemy and wwp the archon with the kabalites and rapid fire anything you land by. 3 reavers won""t do too much damage but if you are playing maelstorm objectives then just keep them in cover, jink like crazy (if I remember correctly eldar bikes jink on 3+) and hop those crazy distances between markers to secure them. Find out what your opponents play and if they use tanks and other heavy stuff because this list is anti-infantry. If they have mechanized stuff, drop two kabalites or a wych and get lances on raiders. Even if you do not win, you'll put up a good fight :D Oh, and raiders can deepstrike too so if zou start with the reavers on your turn and wait until turn 2 you could actually deepstrike with an archon and with the 2 raiders as well. Just make sure the reavers do not die horribly in the first turn :D with a bit of luck avoiding too much scattering off the table edge 3 units spawning in your opponents starting zone turn 2 migh cause some chaos :D  ++ Dark Eldar: Codex (2014) (Combined Arms Detachment) (498pts) ++   HQ (100pts) +   Archon (100pts) [Close Combat Weapon, Haywire Grenades, Kabalite Armour, Plasma Grenades, Splinter Pistol, Webway portal]   Troops (350pts) +   Kabalite Warriors (150pts) [Kabalite Armour] 10x Kabalite Warrior [10x Close Combat Weapon, 10x Splinter Rifle] Raider [Disintegrator cannon, Splinter Racks]  Kabalite Warriors (150pts) [Kabalite Armour] 10x Kabalite Warrior [10x Close Combat Weapon, 10x Splinter Rifle] Raider [Disintegrator cannon, Splinter Racks]  Wyches (50pts) [Wychsuit] 5x Wych [5x Plasma Grenades, 5x Splinter Pistol and Close Combat Weapon]   Fast Attack (48pts) +   Reavers (48pts) [Wychsuit] 3x Reaver [3x Bladevanes, 3x Close combat weapon, 3x Splinter pistol] 3x Reaver jetbike [3x Splinter Rifle]"

It also offers new formations which are interesting and fun to play, however you are limited to wracks, talos, cronos and venoms and raiders + up to 6 HQ consisting solely of haemons and Urien.  Dark Artisan is amazing for tanking with haemon, talos and cronos. cronos gives boosts to FnP, haemonculus gets FnP 3+ and Talos and Cronos get +1 WS and rerolls of FnP 1. Fit them out with WWP and liquifiers + Cronos with the spirit probe which is also a flamer and you can deepstrike behind enemy lines and watch them shit their pants with two monstrous creatures.  The second one I enjoy is the ""whateverthey'recalled"" which consists of 2 wrcacks units in two venoms which must deepstrike turn 1. If you get 1st blood with them you get D3 Vicotry Points which is fun as well.  Grotesquary is a wonderformation as well with the new power from pain.

But because his own legion views him as Chaos and the knowledge he holds is too precious to be wasted by having him locked up in a vault. He is prepping the way for the Lion to return in his own ways. Plus the cabal have had influence on the chapter and store the Lion. Maybe he views the Dark Angels as they stand, to be the fallen and he is making an army to free his lord and destroy the watchers in the dark. He has had too much success to be doing this alone. There is even a story out there somewhere where he was attempting the access a web-way gate and was being blocked, then the Harlequin saved him.  Edited: Additional thoughts"

Warhammer40k,3da2in,NerdyDjinn,3,Tue Jul 14 17:55:24 2015 UTC,"I think you could do a gunslinger build, but it would be Plasma/Bolt or Inferno/Bolt. I think the wording, a model can replace one weapon with one of the following, precludes you from picking up a second Plasma or Inferno Pistol, though I can definitely see the argument that it just means a one for one swap. But I think if you could take multiple options it would be worded, a model can replace any weapon with one of the following."
Warhammer40k,3da2in,Tzelanit,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:14:04 2015 UTC,"I am hung up on the wording too. Sisters get no love from GW, so I doubt this will be FAQed, and your first interpretation seems like the more solid RAW and possibly even RAI. Mixed pistols isn't the worst, but I like having the symmetry. From what I can read, Sister Superiors can also be mixed Gunslingers.  Fluff-wise it seems possible that a Canoness or Celestian assigned to her Command Squad could have spent time as a Seraphim and retained a fondness for the Gunslinging style."
Warhammer40k,3da2in,Equinox90,2,Tue Jul 14 22:34:39 2015 UTC,"As far as I can tell, you can do this. I now like the idea of doing a canoness and her command squad with a total of 10 Plasma Pistols and FnP in a drop pod. Dropping next to a squad of terminators or a tank squad and deleting it."

Blood tanks are clear red resin with embedded floating skulls also lit from above with red LEDs. Resin was poured into a similar shaped/sized plastic cup and finished hardened cast was glued in place to look like the blood tanks had windows.  Base coat is VMA fiery red over black and white primer with some burnt umber shade and orange and yellow highlights.

Warhammer40k,3da4jw,Rincewind1405,3,Tue Jul 14 18:08:59 2015 UTC,"So it sounds like you are describing Necrons, other than the psyker thing. Very durable, very shooty, with some nice cc punch thrown in with wraiths and sword&board lychguard, and their vehicles, while very good, aren't necessary. Look at the decurion in the new codex, and see if you like how that army would play. Ghost arks and night scythes are really good though, so don't throw them out from the get-go. An alternate option, Farsight Enclave Tau. You said you liked battlesuits, how about an army of all battlesuits with drone support? 2 riptides, a shit ton of crisis suits, and a couple units of missile broadsides? Low model count, very shooty and reasonably durable, highly mobile, with lots of fun tricks. There aren't a ton of characters worth taking, unless you want to field part of the 1500 point Farsight and his 7 bros as an hq choice. (Seriously, one hq choice that costs 1500 points. Sure, it's a riptide, a broadside, and 6 crisis commanders, but still.)"
Warhammer40k,3da4jw,jljfuego,2,Wed Jul 15 18:26:07 2015 UTC,"Blood Angels and Space Wolves are mostly meant for close combat as well, so I guess you can cross those off the list   Edit: I think your best choice might be some kind of Space Marines with Dreadnoughts, Centurions, and lots of guys on foot."

Since they're Armies of Imperium, ally in Space Marines for special characterpalooza. Heck, if you like psykers, use the new Librarius Conclave formations-that would be absolute dynamite with Cult Mech."
Warhammer40k,3da4jw,mrsc0tty,2,Tue Jul 14 18:56:45 2015 UTC,Thanks for you input I love the Skitarii asthetics i do quite like the cult  as a returning player I'm not too hot on allies and formations so I'll have to aquire the rulebook and some codexs and look into it.
Warhammer40k,3da4jw,_hei,2,Tue Jul 14 19:17:57 2015 UTC,"Allies are really quite simple. Just get two detachments and field them together, since the Cult is imperial just throw in some Iron Hands or something."
Warhammer40k,3da4jw,jljfuego,2,Tue Jul 14 21:36:15 2015 UTC,"Necrons are probably your best bet.  They only have a few vehicles, and you're not obligated to use them.  They have named HQs, and they don't attack fast.  They slowly walk at you until you die because they sure as hell aren't dying any time soon.   The new space marines gain a lot of strength through formations, one of which gives free transports.  If you hate tanks, then...probably not the best plan.  One of the best space marine lists right now is Battlecompany White Scars.   Dark Angels have variations, but that's Ravenwing and Deathwing.  The first is centered around fast attack, and the second is not viable even in most casual games.  Greenwing is ok, but has the same general builds as C:SM.   Sisters and GK are ok, but also not the strongest.  Both usually take at least a few transports as well.  GK (while not fast attack) want to attack fast.  If they don't knock you off the table soon, they don't have the models to stay through mid-game.   Tau isn't vehicle based, but their vehicles are very very good.  You will be pretty disadvantaged by not taking them.  AV12 jinking skimmers with a bunch of S5 shots is phenomenal.   Tyranids are still melee (unless you're going flier spam.  Don't do that).    CSM are both vehicle based and melee based, so that's unfortunate.  You need your tanks to get into the melee.  There are shooty variations, but they are pretty bad in the current edition of the codex.  So that may change with their 7e release.   Skitarii and cult mechanicus are, well, the mechanicus.  They are really one codex that was released as two.  They don't have the conventional tanks, so you could look into them.  They're mostly relentless infantry that press forward with really good guns.  So these guys ought to be your best bet out of the imperial forces.  But they're new, so their unit choice is limited making it difficult for them to deal with certain units.  They also have no named HQs, which makes sense for their fluff."
Warhammer40k,3da4jw,RyGuy997,2,Tue Jul 14 19:00:10 2015 UTC,Wow thanks for the info certainly a lot to think about.  I'm thinking of eliminating marines (all chapters) as i really find them a bit cookie cutter and want to play something a little different.  I was eyeing up 'crons I heard about something called the royal court which sounds right up my street. They seem like a overall good fit my only reservation would be I hear they fall over in melee.  Tthe Skitarii look nice (love the models they are gorgeous) I'll have to look into formations and allies as suggested by mrsc0tty as i might be able to fill the gaps with the cult mechanicus and Space marine named HQ's.

Warhammer40k,3daemk,wolfsark,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:30:08 2015 UTC,You can use GW guilliman blue glaze in the shadowy sides of the blades to give it a more realistic steel look.  Just make sure you thin it with lots of water and only paint a small section or it will just look like a blue sword.
Warhammer40k,3d7ngw,omigalos92,3,Tue Jul 14 03:48:10 2015 UTC,"A little bit of Badab Black or Agrax Earthshade wash would do wonders for that armour. Don't go crazy with it tho - just use a smaller detail brush and carefully apply it to the recesses (about the 8:50 mark) in the armour.  You can use washes for a quick finish on a lot of details such as weapons, tabards, pelts etc. Just pick an appropriate darker wash and carefully apply it to recesses."

If you are like me and need to win at least now and again there are a couple of commonly accepted lists to build towards.   Ork Horde Formation: Found in the Ghazkull supplement. You get to take 100 boys as 1 squad. Add the warboss (Big Bosspole to make the mob fearless) and painboy and a wierdboy (demonology for hammerhand) if you can.  Take da finkin cap and roll 2x on the Strategic table to try and get the infiltrate ability for the whole tide.  Learn how to multi-charge.  Supplement the Tide with backfield objective holders (like your grots) and traktor cannons or tankbustas or both. Blitz Brigade formation: 5 battlewagons with scout... oh yes please.  Convert toy trucks with orky bits to save the wallet. Biker army. Big $$$ but also big fun. farthest from your current holdings though. Dread mob. This might be the easiest for you to go for but I have no personal experience with it.  The idea is to run more than 10 dreadnoughts and kans and just overwhelm your opponent's ability to deal with them all.

Warhammer40k,3d7uv2,WcFree,8,Tue Jul 14 04:54:49 2015 UTC,"If you're going to do this, you're better off playing against you as an automaton than you as a player. Doing this makes it more like playing Starcraft vs AI: play one army so they have specific rules they have to follow.  I'd suggest starting off with a really simple army. For example, if it were me, the 'AI' army would be Typhus, 90 plague zombies and a forgefiend. Typhus would be in the middle of the zombie blob. Then, each turn the zombies have to move towards the nearest unit they can kill, Typhus does the same, casting a power if he's in range, and the forgefiend moves towards cover then fires. It makes it more like you're playing with one army vs AI, and makes tactics easier.  As you progress you can have more diverse AI."

Warhammer40k,3d90wk,Communist_Danceparty,2,Tue Jul 14 13:15:31 2015 UTC,"All Tau tanks are skimmers, therefore are able to jink once per turn for dat cover save.  Crisis suits have the jump pack (I don't remember the exact name of the rule. Thrust?) So in the assault phase they can roll 2d6 for extra movement.  Markerlights are huge. They can negate an enemy's cover save, bring up a units ballistic skill, or auto hit a seeker missile. Best used as a drone attached to your commander with a drone controller for dat bs5 goodness."

If it hits, they're lit up and you can subsequently abuse it on other units (Units can't use their own markerlights though). Jinking; Most tau vehicles can make the call to jink before your opponent rolls to hit. You get a cover save but you're forced to take snap shots with that unit.  JSJ; you get to use use jetpack movement during your assault phase. Roll dice, that's your max distance. Drones; marklerlights are one shots. Use em or don't; they go away between turns. It depends on strategy; I put them in front to soak shots."

Warhammer40k,3d90wk,Cl1ckBa1t,1 point,Wed Jul 15 12:53:43 2015 UTC,Yeah. I don't remember the Tau stuff very well.
Warhammer40k,3d90wk,Wine3,1 point,Wed Jul 15 13:04:45 2015 UTC,"So a markerlight is a heavy 1 weapon, you roll to hit, and if you hit there is a marker token on that unit you just hit. Another of your units shooting at the marked unit can trade marker tokens for certain shooting benefits, like negating cover saves, +bs, or launching seeker missiles. A unit of pathfinders or marker drones can light up high priority targets so that your other units are almost guaranteed to hit, and ignore cover. Devilfish are skimmers. They have a burst cannon, which is ok but not really important to be shooting with cuz there's tons of other s5 in the army, so if they ever get shot at they should be jinking. They can take dis pods to get a bonus to the cover save, and sensor spines to move through cover, so as long as you jink they are tough to kill. The drones can also shoot at full bs even when the tank jinks, so  For Piranhas and Hammerheads/Skyrays, you probably would rather keep them from getting shot until they get to shoot, so the question of jinking is a bit more situational. If there's serious anti-tank coming in, it's better to jink and snap-fire and survive, but if it's small arms, maybe chance a glance in order to shoot the big guns. Remember, markerlights let you improve snap-firing bs too, so even when you jink, you can spend enough marker tokens that your tanks still shoot well. JSJ is exactly what it seems, you move 6"" in movement, shoot in shooting, and you get to move again in assault phase, 2d6"". It's the only thing you'll ever voluntarily do in any assault phase, so take advantage of it. Jump back and forth over LoS blocking terrain, bounce back and forth to shoot in your turn and stay out of your opponent's range in his turn. Drones are cheaper and expendable wounds that sometimes do something nice. Park them in front of the suits they are attached to so they can eat wounds for your expensive suits. Don't attach them to fire warriors, or give fire warriors any upgrades except a fish and maybe emp grenades if you're facing an all vehicle list. Riptides shouldn't take drones either, cuz that's an easy way to run your 250 point model off your own table edge after one drone goes down. Really, only crisis or broadsides should have drones, beyond the two that come with Devilfish and Piranhas. Tau are really straightforward, at least vanilla Tau. Castle up, mark ugly things, pay attention to target priority, and shoot them to death. Stay out of assault range as much as possible. Disorganized charges are awful, as you will still lose combat, so arrange your troops where each assault enemy can only charge one unit while you still get to gang overwatch when possible. The only tricky things are knowing what's the most important targets to kill, and getting to objectives. Fire warriors in Devilfish make objectives easier, as do deep striking crisis suits."
Warhammer40k,3d90wk,jljfuego,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:05:17 2015 UTC,"Ill address in order.  Every hit from a markerlight sticks to that unit and creates a pool of tokens.   Now when something else shoot at that unit you can spend tokens to improve the shooting.  This is good for bypassing cover saves and/or maximizing hits.  Jump shoot jump (JSJ) works in the different offensive phases of the game.   Move, then shoot, then in the assault phase theye roll 2d6 and move anywhere they can reach with that roll.    So hide in a building, jump out for clear line of sight, then jump back to deny shots or gain cover.  Drones are just like any other model they can move, shoot, charge just like anything else,  Most people will use them in the front of the more valuable models so that they get hit, and die first.   Bear in mind that these count towards the size of the unit so morale checks can come sooner this way.  Sniper drones are tricky to use but take advantage as they also have access to JSJ.  There is lots of ways to play Tau.  You can hang back and let everything crash against your wall of superior range and armor piercing or drop in from the skies and attack rear and side flanks.  Also Tau are rumored to be getting a new book in months so they may boost or nerf certain unit combinations.  Tau are a Swiss army knife.   Know where to use the knife,  and where a spoon will work better"
Warhammer40k,3d90wk,mechabeast,0,Tue Jul 14 14:43:43 2015 UTC,"Get a Codex - it will explain you a lot.  Crisis suits are Jetpack infantry - they do a Thrust Move in Assault Phase (see: Rulebook)  Get Marker Drones - they are awesome. Missle Drones might be good, Shield Drones are sometimes useful.  And stay away from close combat as much as you can.  Necrons are way easier than Tau."

Funny moments are my Chimera shooting at the same squad of marines for like 4 turns and never killing any.

I would start with focusing on the basics of movement, then shooting, and finally assault. Then layer on leadership, unit types, special weapons, and the rest.

Warhammer40k,3d7g87,jljfuego,2,Tue Jul 14 09:52:22 2015 UTC,"Shoot them. That simple.  Pulse Rifles are a DEldar's worst nightmare. 30"" will take out a bunch of things before they get into Splinter-Rifle or combat range, chuck a Fireblade in the unit and they get an extra shot a turn if they don't move. Strength 5 will glance most DE armour on a 5 and pen on a 6. AP 5 will strip saves off everything but Scourges, Incubi and Talos.  Use Crisis suits. Give them flamers and missile pods to either pop transports or cook the troops inside, with multi-trackers, you can do both. Keep them mobile to drop stuff as quickly as possible before Power from Pain gives them too much of a buff.  Take some broadsides with the skyfire upgrade to take down any flyers.   Assuming you're taking a Riptide (if you're going to play Tau it's a matter of when, not if) I'd take the Heavy Burst Cannon, 8 S6 AP4 shots is going to wreck a bunch of stuff. Don't worry too much about poison because that 2+ save will help (trust me, it took me quite a few turns to put enough poison into a pre-OP wraith knight to take it down)."
Warhammer40k,3d7g87,supahmonkey,2,Tue Jul 14 11:06:40 2015 UTC,"I have to advise against taking a missile pod and a flamer, Tau crisis suits should always just double up on whatever gun that unit is using. Maybe take a flamer in addition to the 2 missile pods, for raider roasting and overwatch shenanigans, but the objective is to stay outside flamer range, and kill them before they get close. Multi-trackers are standard issue now, don't take up a slot anymore. Basically in my experience Tau are a hard counter to DEldar thanks to the high strength long ranged shooting and multitude of special rules to negate all DEldar's advantages. I'd feel awful playing against a newer DEldar player, they have such a steep learning curve anyways, and trying to fight the turtleiest force with the most glass cannon force is a difficult proposition even for experienced Archons."
Warhammer40k,3d7g87,jljfuego,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:39:29 2015 UTC,I meant for it to be two missile pods and a flamer per suit; probably should have made that clearer.

If you want to start the hobby, it's important to start small. Some troops, an HQ, a vehicle. Small things. As for codices, with the rumours of a major Tzeentch update, you might want to hold off buying for a bit, but it's your choice."
Warhammer40k,3d5qbz,IVIilitarus,3,Mon Jul 13 20:11:10 2015 UTC,"Thanks to all for the replies so far. Exciting stuff regarding the potential update! Do you think its worth getting some of the basics still though? In reply to Grubnar as well as yourself, I hoping to begin with a few sorcerers along with some rubic marines and perhaps some tanks as well.  Whilst your reply would be pure speculation, do you think changes would include these troops/HQs significantly?"
Warhammer40k,3d5qbz,cenotoph,3,Mon Jul 13 20:15:02 2015 UTC,"Probably not for the most part,If its anything like Daemonkin of Khorne update you will still be using basic marines/Thousands suns/Sorcerer lords + whatever affiliated daemons,so feel free to buy the stuff you're interested in. Everyones steering you in the right direction,Buy some squads of marines (the thousand sons upgrade sprews if necessary) and a Rhino to go with them + an HQ and you'll be off to a great start."
Warhammer40k,3d5qbz,IVIilitarus,3,Mon Jul 13 20:26:52 2015 UTC,"You can't possibly go wrong with simple Rubric Marines and possibly a sorceror or two. The Khorne Daemonkin codex did include the iconic Khorne units like Berzerkers and Bloodletters, so its safe to assume a Tzeentch Codex would do the same."
Warhammer40k,3d5qbz,Pale_Horse_forward,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:38:24 2015 UTC,"Amazing, thanks. Any suggestions in terms of paint colours to use? Excluding shades etc and reading around a little people seem to suggest using Kanton blue for the base coat however I cant find much mention to particular paints for both the gold trimmings and also the loin cloth/kilt areas.   Also previously I've used Chaos black for the undercoat of miniatures but I was wondering whether a white might be better for the Thousand Sons (marines at the very least)?"
Warhammer40k,3d5qbz,CuriousBlueAbra,3,Mon Jul 13 20:51:07 2015 UTC,"Before you buy paints, google a bit for things like ""Thousand Sons paint scheme"" or ""Thousand sons paint tutorial"". You should get quite a few options and the chance to see what some of the best painters in the hobby did to get their results.  As for the base spray, I started with black but eventually moved to white. I occasionally switch it up depending on the model but if you spray the model white and then give it a nice thin wash of black, details will stand out and you can use the first shade coat as a template for the rest of the model. That's all really advanced stuff that I am sure you'll pick up in time. Right now it's just about having fun.  Quick note: Brushes. You will need a detail, a fine detail, and a decent wash brush. Something with a bit more bristles than your standard detail brush and a fine point. A drybrush will be helpful, something round and flat-tipped for blending. Keep them clean and they will last you quite a while."
Warhammer40k,3d5qbz,P-sychotic,1 point,Mon Jul 13 21:36:50 2015 UTC,Oh Tzeentch update. Hopefully Thousand Sons are included in that.
Warhammer40k,3d5qbz,jreilly89,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:43:37 2015 UTC,"Of course they will, if it's like the Khorne Daemonkin army, anything that can take the Mark of Tzeentch upgrade will be included.  For some reason this didn't include Kharn for the Khorne Daemonkin codex, so whether or not a Tzeentch based codex will feature Ahriman who knows. But Ahriman has his own Apocalypse formation which is cool at least."
Warhammer40k,3d5qbz,zekapitalist,6,Wed Jul 15 10:44:31 2015 UTC,"Start small with some CSM troops. Also, eBay is great for used models. Start with cheap acrylics, a basic flat primer and some basic flat black/grey/white primer and basic paintbrushes. Practice, work on your skill then build up from there.  Too many people buy too much and get overwhelmed, so starting small is a good step.  As for rules, buy the codex and a cheap 7th edition rulebook, both are cheaper on eBay, get 2 boxes of CSM Marines and an HQ like a Lord or Sorceror. That will let you play Kill Team. Then find a local store or group."
Warhammer40k,3d5qbz,Charlie-Green-Rug,2,Mon Jul 13 19:28:38 2015 UTC,"I agree with much of what you say,  although I'd like to provide an alternative opinion re: painting.   I see a lot of people come to the hobby and get frustrated when thier painted models dont come close to looking as good as the ones printed on the box.  This is the number one reason we see so many unpainted armies around the place.  My advice is to look at your models like an investment in hobby hours.  $100 could get you a small squad and decent quality (ie GW or competitors) paints and brushes, or it could get you two small squads that you can paint with dollar store paints and will look atrocious after the thrill of using them on the table top wears off.  Tldr; dont cheap out on paints and brushes. Dont use acrylics under any circumstances.  Your spending big money on plastic models because they're finely detailed.  If you go and clog that detail with several mm layers of thick paint you might as well have bought something much cheaper.   Also lool up the Duncan Rhodes videos on YouTube.  They are indispensable for learning to paint to a good standard quickly."
Warhammer40k,3d5qbz,jreilly89,3,Tue Jul 14 02:51:22 2015 UTC,Dont use acrylics under any circumstances.   Eh? All the best painters use acrylics.
Warhammer40k,3d5qbz,TheOtherNick,2,Tue Jul 14 10:01:32 2015 UTC,"Eh I suppose, but I don't see the point in giving a begginer an original Les Paul guitar. If you're a bad artist, expensive paint won't fix that. Plus paint, specially acrylics, are pretty easy to strip with just isopropyl alcohol or acetone free nail polish remover. Besides by only spending a little bit of money on paints and brushes, he can spend more money on models if he wants to.  I can see both sides of the argument, but with this hobby already having a high price tag, paints and brushes shouldn't be another point to drive people away."
Warhammer40k,3d5qbz,mhacdebhandia,1 point,Tue Jul 14 03:06:02 2015 UTC,"Have to agree - don't cheap out on paint and brushes. Brushwise, all you need to start is one base, one detail-layer and maybe a drybrush. For paints, you need a spray primer and a few colour pots.  There's no point covering your expensive plastic in cheap, unsuitable paint via crappy brushes. As the guy above says, your tools are an investment, and not a particularly large one at that.  Hope you enjoy it buddy!"

Warhammer40k,3d5qbz,mrsc0tty,3,Mon Jul 13 20:43:20 2015 UTC,"Well ... what kind of Thousand Sons are you talking about?  A small cabal of sorcerers with a few units of (rubic) marines and some tanks?  A force of Tzeentchian deamons, led by a Thousan Sons commander that has been elevated to become a deamon prince?  A force of (normal) marines with a few that have been cursed/blessed by the flesh change? Maybe supported by some deamon engines?  Or do you perhaps want to collect a legion force since the time of the Great Crusade and the Horus Heresy, when the legion was still whole? Forge World has been slowly publishing books for the space marine legions, and the next book is rumored to be either Blood Angels vs Deamons (teh Battle of Sigmus Prime, or Thousand Sons vs Space Wolves (the burning of Prospero).  There are many options, and some are more difficult than others."

Warhammer40k,3d5qbz,Colemonstaa,2,Mon Jul 13 22:19:39 2015 UTC,"Well, there's a couple of things that are important as a beginner:  1 - Choose models you like the look of, not just the ones that are the most powerful. A units rules will change from edition to edition, and they will rise and fall in terms of relative power with each new codex released. But cool models always look cool.  2 - Take your time assembling your models. Clean the mold lines, use some 800+ grit sandpaper to clean up any rough areas. Practice with super glue, and plastic glue. They both do different things and sometimes it's good to know the differences and what they're good for. Try and work with a common theme when you're assembling your models so that your guys look... consistent for lack of a better word.  3 - Take your time with painting. Thin your paints. Use a spray undercoat. Buy good paints. Honestly, I'd recommend Vallejo paints over GW ones as the dropper bottles are much more user friendly (YMMV) and they have a really good airbrush range. Youtube videos are the best form of tutorial bar in-person instruction, so have a look for some. This is one thing GW has done well, producing a good range of tutorial videos that are easy to follow and are free. Also, start off small. Just paint up a dude or two, from start to finish. A model that isn't over-loaded with detail, but has a couple of different textures (armour, cloth, flesh etc) to work on is ideal. Then when you've got more of a feel for it you can start experimenting with batch painting and characters or vehicles.  4 - I found an airbrush and compressor to be incredibly useful. You can get an airbrush for cheap on eBay (I use a 0.2mm model that I got for about $15) although the compressor is a bit more. Don't buy an expensive airbrush to start with because you WILL do something silly with it like bend the needle or forget to clean it or drop a part down the sink while you're washing it. For a long time, YOU will be the factor limiting your ability to airbrush well. When your skills improve and you start to feel like your brush is holding you back, then it's time to upgrade. Even if you only use it for base coating, an airbrush is super useful."

You hear stories about kids in cub scouts where they have to make the pinewood derby car and their dad doesn't let them do anything, but my dad understood that the finished product didn't matter, what mattered was that it was yours, and watching yourself improve. He busted out a couple tools and his old miniature paints and while I sawed and sanded he made a test track.   After the years of pinewood derby I had my own shelf with my four cars on it next to all his old miniatures. My friends picked up 40k in middle school and I told him I wanted to, and I started out the first few games using his old army then I started my own, and it was the first real ""artsy"" thing I'd ever done.  I didn't appreciate what his knowledge about how important it was that projects be yours did for me as a kid until I grew up and compared stories.  ""I took piano lessons and hated it for 10 years and I don't remember any of it"" ""My mom always took over my school projects and I really started to hate projects at school"", I heard from all my adult friends.   My dad is a dork. He understands that it's not important what you do, it's important that you want to do it and you're proud of it. My Pinewood derby cars, warhammer armies, state championship football trophy, last place FIRST competition robot, giant hydraulic plant costume from Little Shop of Horrors, Biomechanical engineering degree and as of a week ago my first job are all things I did by myself for myself, and I'll always have my dad to thank for that."

They are for all intent and purposes worth an Initiate (regular Space Marine) on the offensive, though have a weaker armor save. Depending on the situation, if I was going for a shooty Crusader squad (sometimes I have one or two, when my Zeal lacks) I might actually but the Neophytes somewhere in the middle, since the Initiate has more chances of surviving. For shooting, the Neophyte with a bolter is worth the same as an initiate with a bolter. So it isn't an automatic sacrifice anymore, though the Initiate does cost more points to put on the table.

But yeah people ask if they're emperor's children occasionally, I've worked it into their fluff a little bit.  Short version, they're a fleet based chapter who got lost in the warp for an unknown amount of time. In the process, the Chapter Master was slain, along with many of our Librarians. An unknown amount of time has passed since this event, and what's left of the chapter is a confused group of marines with lost and inconsistent history, meaning they aren't sure who they're successors of. They seem to have a Melanchromic organ defect, causing their skin to be pale so many think they come from the Raven Guard, yet there are Dreadnoughts who insist we belong to other chapters. Captain Jaden Telarius has taken the reigns as leader, and insists that they must not focus on the past, but instead study the teachings of all the most successful chapters and how to fight like them. The Tactical Marines are learning from the Ultramarines, the Assault Squads from the Raven Guard and Blood Angels, the Devastators from the Imperial Fists, etc.  The confusion and mystery behind them has caused many conflicts with other Imperial forces, many assuming that we are heretics from the warp, since they remind many of the Emperor's Children. The Chaplains have been vigilant in ensuring that no corruption from the warp remains in our chapter and are usually in the front lines of most of our battles.  Since they are in a state of rebuilding, they harvest any gene seed organs they can find, an idea the apothecaries learned from the Raven Guard. They are currently on a voyage to Terra, helping Imperial planets on the way, in order to prove their loyalty to the emperor, while many men still wish to learn their past once they arrive."

Warhammer40k,3d2vrv,El_Capitano_MC,3,Mon Jul 13 02:34:01 2015 UTC,Thanks! The purple was inspired from the idea the purple was royal in roman times. Some of the gold placement was inspired by the Hammers of Dorn in the previous codex. And the idea that no two suits of armor look exactly the same color pattern-wise came from medieval knights and the variety there would be. It has some similarities to Emperor's Children but I honestly had started coming up with the color scheme before noticing that. Although that similarity has inspired some of their fluff.
Warhammer40k,3d2vrv,Blood_ForTheBloodGod,1 point,Mon Jul 13 03:03:13 2015 UTC,I was thinking along the lines of Emperors Children but I was sure there had to be other reasons for it as well

The bomb auto-hitting is neat, but not game changing; 2D6 initiative test is neat, but they're already testing on -3I; D3 VPs for Warlord is neat, but most warlords have high toughness / good armor and Look Out Sir! to make that very unlikely.  If you're having issues with Drakes, DA have a lot of tools.  DW have their armor, GW have transports, and RW have Hit&Run.  The first doesn't care about Drakes, the second hides in transports, and the third can avoid shooting all together by charging into CSM or other not super-killy assault units.  You can also craft an alpha strike list.  With 2-3 Drakes in reserve, you have the points advantage (and a pretty big one at that) for at least one turn, 2 if you go first.  In that time, you should be able to cripple his ground forces and get your forces into a position where they can be safe from the Baleflamer.  If it's really that big of a problem, you could even try to get the Warlord Trait that allows for -1 to their reserve rolls.  At any rate, it's hard to tell what you ""should"" be doing since we know nothing about your list or your friends.  But 100% don't take the Silence Squadron.  It's just GW trying to sell the models that practically didn't sell for an entire codex rotation."

Warhammer40k,3d502v,_hei,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:15:58 2015 UTC,"Sounds like you need to get you some Deathwing.  You can either go for the Thunderhammer / Storm Shield with a heavy and Chainfist kind, or the Knights kind.  Either one works here, but I prefer the TH/SS because they can take a heavy weapon, making them useful outside of combat too.  Combat Squad, Scout move, and grav / melta the walkers, ending your movement near his deployment zone.  Some of your guys will get charged by the princes, but that is fine (the walkers should be immobilized or destroyed, and the ones that are not should be too far away to charge).  By combat squading to min squads of 3 plus independent Attack Bikes, your losses should be minimal.  You can screen the special weapons with min squads without any specials, and hope that they survive to Hit&Run away.  Regardless, they did their job.    On turn 2, you should be able to bring in your DW buddies right there, ready to punch face.  Now your opponent has two choices: 1) Run away or 2) stay and fight.  If he runs, your job is done.  The princes do nothing in shooting and you can continue to mop up the remaining ground forces in his deployment zone.  Due to the restrictive movement of fliers, this is where you want to keep all of your RW forces for the rest of the game.  If he stays, then you will get a free charge on his very expensive princes after they charge another squad of min bikes.  In one round of combat, one squad of DW should take out one Daemon prince, so position them to be between the RW and the princes that want to punch their faces in.    In the mean time, more walkers should be dying horrible deaths to Grav/Melta, and his troop choices (which I'm guessing he would reserve) will be coming on to meet swift death as your entire army sits in his deployment zone.  In terms of list writing, I would take a RW Strike force and a DW Strike force.  If your opponent allows it, I would take a Libby on a Bike as well as a Libby in Terminator Armor for the two HQ choices.  Roll Interromancy, and go from there.  Mind Worm (S6 AP2 Ignores cover) was designed to kill MC's.  Righteous Repugnance (gives Rage) will help your DW (or RW Black Knights) wonderfully on the charge, to make sure whatever you're charging dies.  Aversion (only snap shots) will neuter his walkers if they have any shooting, and you can just zoom away from them on your bikes; moreover, it will prevent Heldrakes from firing the Baleflamer.  Trephination is useful if you got off the Mind Worm earlier, and it is also designed to kill MCs.  Then for the RW Strike force I would take squads of 6 with Grav + Multimelta Attack Bike (anywhere from 3-5 squads), and 2 squads of DW with 2x TH/SS, Assault Cannon, and Chainfist.  The DW Strike force comes in at 610pts, so the RW list will have to accommodate that."

While I'd really like to play it since in my opinion it has a cool theme to it I fear it's just not worth it if you remember that it's gonna be about a third of your army in most games. In a friendly game there's nothing wrong with playing it, but if you're up against a stronger list it's not exactly ideal.  Yes the Dark Talon got a nice buff to a point that people might actually use it from time to time, though I still think it's too unreliable for the points. If you get that vortex off in a good location it defenitely has the potential to be a big middlefinger for your opponent. the bomb however I see more of a gimmick. Sure drop it on something you're about to attack and it's awesome but having it in the riht place at the right time can be kinda tricky. also having it scatter onto your own guys who wantet to attack is not so great :)  As for the nepilims Even with the buff it got I still dont think the pointcost is anywhere near justifiable. For a designated interceptor the weapons are just too weak. The rockets are fine now(s8 like the other sm aircraft missiles would be nice, but s7 at least brings them in line with flakk missiles) but a S6 main gun? and I still don't ave an idea what the reasoning for that random heavy bolter is.  As is however it' basicly doing the same as a storm talon for 1.5 times the cost. The Storm Talon has a hollpoint less but when you can take the StormTalon instead of two Nephlims that doesn't matter :) If you want to compare it directly, look at a Vendetta. it's the same cost but does litterally everything better. So no, i probably wouldn't take the formation because i can't justify the nephlim's cost. I think you're better off to take a single darktalon via cad or allied detachment and if you need it take some AA via allies as well, because let's face it AA is defenitly not a strength of the DA :)"

Warhammer40k,3d7vy9,GrayKnight666,6,Tue Jul 14 05:05:40 2015 UTC,"I.. Err.. What the? ok, so, firstly, in a single post you have pretty much personified the image that most people have of the tau player... good job... i really wish you guys would stop doing this... Now... I'm going to pretend like this is a legitimate (and well structured, spelt and worded) question and you just struggle with either the English language or expressing yourself in a normal social setting. The Tau army has access to a couple of effective ways of dealing with deepstriking CC units, as 80% of the posts here have already pointed out, interceptor is a thing and your fist line of defense. Be it mounted on a squad of HYMP Broadside battle suits or on a riptide with an ion accelerator, or heck, if your feeling lucky or don't have very much faith in your opponent, a squad of crisis suits armed with TL plasma rifles or TL burstcannon, its an upgrade that you can afford to just throw spare hard-points just because you had the spare points left over and couldn't work out what else to do with it. with that said, there are 3 ways deepstriking of a heavy hitting CC unit generally go. - 1. you opponent is an idiot and lands a squad of assault terminators smack bang in front of your guns in the middle of a rosey field, this being the case, you just blow the living fuck out of them with every fucking gun at your disposal, generally starting with an over-charged ion-accelerator considering the aforementioned squad will be very tightly packed. Congratulations you just got yourself a free killpoint and maybe even a warlord kill, have a cookie... Remember, you cant assault out of a deepstrike - 2. they actually have half a mind, have landed around a corner somewhere out of line of sight of most of your guns, but actually in range to be of some trouble next turn. Well, this is actually where you worry, but only a little, Broadside battlesuites come stock with Smart Missiles, they dont require line of sight and have a 30"" range, lob some potshots off at him, hope you kill a few, and spend the next movement phase re-positioning some heavy guns to hit him with something, failing that, you move your forces in such a way that if he actually gets an assault off you will overwatch him to hell, hopefully stop the charge and then blow the living fuck outa him in the following shooting phase. Congratulations you just got yourself a free killpoint and maybe even a warlord kill, have a cookie... Remember, Tau are not a static force, you can build a gunline, but staying completely still will kill you, learn to move with your opponents actions, go around them. a stationary firewarrior is a dead one. - 3. this guy is smart, he has scoped out your army, worked out where your interceptor units are and dropped a nasty CC unit behind all possible line of sight and out of range of your interceptor weapons, in such a way that he will still hit your lines next turn, on your flank and be able to roll he way right up your left hand side... ok, step 1 DONT PANIC Step 2 assess what he has dropped, is it a massively killy unit? of course it is, your tau, I've seen a squad of grots sweeping advance a squad of firewarriors before, everything is fucking killy in CC. Turn your line slightly, move an expendable unit forward to tempt him, let it die in his assault phase and blow the ever living fuck outa him in your shooting phase. Step 3 Congratulations you just got yourself a free killpoint and maybe even a warlord kill, have a cookie... Remember, the greater good is a thing, the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few, feed an expendable unit to a CC monster and then shoot it when he has killed you and is standing in the open with his ass in the wind."

Warhammer40k,3d7vy9,bearseamen,6,Tue Jul 14 05:36:56 2015 UTC,"It's spelled 'dudes'. Also drop pods deep strike from reserves so you can execute them as they come out. They also cannot assault the turn they arrive  so you get a close range assrape with the most brutal army to do this with.   Quit complaining/worrying; you are sitting on one of the most easy-to-use, powerful armies in the game."
Warhammer40k,3d7vy9,cann3dasparagus,3,Tue Jul 14 05:59:15 2015 UTC,"In addition to interceptor (on a Riptide!) you get supporting fire so make sure you keep your units close, also Longstrike in a Hammerhead makes opponents cringe at charging anything within his supporting fire range  A bigger issue is opponents deep striking close and then just shooting you (i.e. melta veterans but Wraithguard with scythes allied with a DE Archon with Webway portal really hurts)"

Warhammer40k,3d4p6b,mrsc0tty,2,Mon Jul 13 16:09:52 2015 UTC,"Build 2 armies, and only take CAD's if you have to. 6th edition was a shooting game with some assaulting and army building elements, 7th edition is an army building game with some shooting and some assaulting elements.   Formations and non-CAD detachments will be your best friends.  I don't play admech, so for me personally I'd put them aside until I could afford to build a War Convocation, which is the formation consisting of an admech battle congregation, an oathsworn Knight, and a Skitarii Battle Mantiple. Otherwise you could always slap together a bunch of smaller Admech Formations, a couple skitarii ones, and a knight formation down the road.  As for dark eldar, I repeat my previous statement about CAD's. Right now you have a nice little MC bomb, and a source for alpha strike, you can either add on more melee a la something like a grotesquerie, or add more ranged fire power with a Realspace Raider Detachment (RRD) or a Kabalite Raiding Party formation (KRP) out of our main codex.  The RRD will give you 3 elite slots  and 6 fast attack slots with a 1 HQ/2 troop  tax. Technically 1 of your 6 FA's is also required. If you take this approach don't worry about the elite slots, load up on fast attacks, and take a Lhamaen as your HQ in their own venom. Take 2 units of 5 kabalites as your troops each in a venom, and grab 6 minimum count units of some combination of Reavers and Scourges. Give Scourges Heat lances, or Haywire blasters; Give Reavers Cluster caltrops and either special weapon option.  Venoms should always have 2 Splinter cannon  I say that here because the other option is the KRP and every unit that can take a transport needs a transport in that formation, and you probably want venoms. The beautiful thing is it can technically be taken without any troops. The downside is you do need 6 units of Kabalite warriors, all of these may be taken as their elite version, Kabalite Trueborn, instead. Total formation is 1 archon, 1 unit court of the archon(take 1 or 2 lhamaens and have them share their venom with the archon if you don't get a WWP.), 1 unit of hellions, 1 unit of scourges, 1 unit of incubi, and 6 units of Kabalite warriors/Trueborn.   Fully kitted out this gets expensive fast. but if you just take the troop version of the warriors, in venoms with just 2 splinter cannons, it can be done for just south of 1200 points and gives you 8 venoms to deepstrike in later. This can be downright terrifying if you null deploy, and go second.  Both of these armies will benefit greatly from the inclusion of either a CAD or Allied Detachment of Craftworld Eldar with an Autarch as HQ since they will grant reserve roll manipulation. Troop choices should either be windrider jetbikes, or Rangers. IF taken as a CAD Obsec rangers are great for holding backfield items, and if not then the jetbikes make great mobile sources of cover."

Warhammer40k,3d4p6b,elxox,2,Tue Jul 14 01:12:56 2015 UTC,"Competitive Dark Eldar Player here: I would not bother with them right now. The new codex has way too many issues taking down way too many meta units to be useful at the highest level. If you play casually though, they are fine. But everything is fine at a casual level so...  I would invest on the mech. They have very fun rules and you can get very creative with them without sacrificing competitiveness."
Warhammer40k,3d30jh,Tsumugi123,2,Mon Jul 13 03:00:44 2015 UTC,"I cringe every time I see dev squads like that.

If you do want them in transports consider rhinos with only two heavy weapons. They still have to remain stationary to fire properly, but at least they can fire while inside. Just deploying them in cover and ideally never moving is still ideal IMO though."
Warhammer40k,3d30jh,Ze_German_Guy,2,Tue Jul 14 03:13:04 2015 UTC,"Yeah, putting them in cover is my original intention, wasn't going to put them in transport in the first place, was just using them to get the extra metal box.   However, if I interpret rules correctly, you can't take a dedicated transport that can't fit your capacity, regardless whether they are in or out of the vehicle.   So yeah, if I want to take more than 6 models per squad, I will have to take Rhino instead."

Some units like assault squads will give conditions on when dedicated transports can be selected, but devastatos aren't one of them IIRC. I can't find any general rule that a dedicated transport has to be able to actually fit the selected unit otherwise."

Warhammer40k,3d13n9,Magnified,2,Mon Jul 13 19:37:27 2015 UTC,"It's only called ""Decurion"" in the Necron codex.   It was the first one so people just call them Decurions. If you see ""a guy playing decurion"" and no army, it's gonna be Necrons."
Warhammer40k,3d2zwr,bloodangelx12,7,Mon Jul 13 02:55:19 2015 UTC,"As someone who plays both Tyranids and Necrons, my advice is as follows:  Podding gaunts isn't going to get you anywhere. Any kind of alpha strike isn't going to get you anywhere. You have to play the attrition game. Fortunately, Tyranids have several tools you can utilize against the robot menace.  First, you'll want to field a Living Artillery Node (or at least a unit of biovores) if he's going to be running any substantial number of footslogging warriors. S4 AP4 large blast barrage can seriously cut down on their numbers. Castle up in a ruin with a thrope for 2+ cover to help extend your lifespan, and shell him from range. Nids outgun Necrons pretty easily. You have better range on your biovores, plasma blasts from Exocrines, and a high number of S6 shots from your Flyrants and Dakkafexes. They have gauss bolters, and more gauss bolters (unless they bring Destroyer cult). The key is to use that firepower to decimate the warrior units as they slog up the board. Necrons cannot gunline. It just doesn't work. They have to play the mid-range attrition war/assault game.  A Hive Crone is also very good in this matchup: their Vector Strikes and missiles can bring down Night Scythes, and their Drool Cannon can deal good damage to warriors even if they're hiding inside Ghost Arks.  The big issue is the Wraiths. The key to fighting them is to realize that they can be tarpitted. Run a HUGE unit (we're talking like 20+) of Gargoyles into them and forget about them for the rest of the game. The gargoyles won't run away as long as you maintain synapse, you're jump so you can position to deny him the charge, and you have blind so with his Initiative 2 (whip coils do NOT buff the blind test) you'll have him hitting on 5s most of the time. If wraiths don't get the charge then they have a hard time cutting their way out of huge units like that. Then you take the rest of your army and win. This same tactic works on other assault threats, like CCBs and Triarch Praetorians. You can also use Paroxysm to accomplish the same thing.  Avoid committing your Flyrants too early. Skirt around the edges and take potshots. As long as there's the potential for you to fly behind a Ghost Arks, he's gonna hang back. That gives you more time to shell him with biovores.  If he's running destroyer cult it's a whole different ball game. You'll need to use cover to avoid the AP3 eating your MCs, and your Flyrants will have to hunt down the squads as they're the only thing that can really kill them except your Exocrine.  If you want to fight him in assault, bring a Toxicrene or Dimachaeron. The high initiative, high strength, and AP2 will help you get the combat results needed to sweep squads. Just keep them away from Wraiths. Everything else you can take on.  Oh, and minor tip: if you want an easy first blood gun down his Scarabs with a Flyrant. S6 will ID them, he'll need to make 5+ RPs to not lose an entire base. If he's running the min squad then a single Flyrant can waste them all no problem if he isn't careful with his positioning."

Necrons are king in the 24"" range.  If you have further range than that, utilize it as best as you can.  Necron warriors suck at close combat, so fling anything into them to make them all worthless.  Wraiths are awesome against marine equivalents and below, so take them on with something really big, or commit a large unit so it's tarpitted on either side."

Warhammer40k,3d2zwr,UristMcLawyer,6,Tue Jul 14 04:24:46 2015 UTC,"Win close combats. If they run you have a really good chance of sweeping advance and denying them the chance to save wounds with armor and RP.  The strength of the Decurion is that it enhances the durability of the Necrons, so if you can find ways to get around that strength you'll fare better. Just beware that thanks to their durability it can be tough to win combat hard enough to force their morale to break.  Also, you will completely own the psychic phase."
Warhammer40k,3d2zwr,mutten006,3,Mon Jul 13 04:39:45 2015 UTC,"Spirit Leech really hurts on Crons, in particular; although they do still have a save, it's one of the ways to get a high volume of wounds on high value targets like the Spider or Praetorians and such and not allow them to have 2 saves instead of 1."
Warhammer40k,3d2zwr,C4lvy,2,Mon Jul 13 05:14:07 2015 UTC,"I play Tyranids and my roommate plays Necrons and I've learned something about the matchup.  Tyranids need to play much smarter to win than Necrons and it really depends on the type of winning condition you have.  If you are running a Maelstrom of War game you are in the best spot you can be because Decurion doesn't have objective secured and we can run tons of cheap units that do.  One example was he was camping an objective with some immortals and all I had to do was charge him with 10 horms and for the rest of the game neither unit could kill the other, but I held the objective.  Also we can throw dakka at them in great numbers, and use lots of cover advantage.  As a user said earlier using ruins and venomthropes to hide a living artillery node is one of our best tools against shooting armies.  The hits will do damage, and the misses will cause some problems as well.  After the first time I spawned 3 spore mines and crashed them into a unit of his, he learned to ignore a cluster of those at his own risk.  The best part about that is it costs them a shooting phase to do anything about them!  It's quite fantastic really.  The other things I'd suggest is a basic Tyranid rule anyway and that's not to play on a board without a shit load of cover.  You need to move from cover to cover because we have shitty armor saves and almost everything will pen against gaunts.  However you find some ruins to stick them in and it'll be a struggle for almost any non-tau army to kill a group of even 10 of them.  You can run MCs since Necrons don't seem to have many ID weapons, however keep in mind that even though they have no ID, 20+ shots from a ghost arch will likely drop your MC or at least put him quite low."

Warhammer40k,3d2zwr,jljfuego,3,Mon Jul 13 14:43:20 2015 UTC,"well no, in 7th everything has the ability to hold objectives by sitting on them, but if your opponent has his/her HQ unit or Troops unit on the same objective, and they have a CAD, they have OS, so they get the points."
Warhammer40k,3d2zwr,mutten006,1 point,Mon Jul 13 14:54:55 2015 UTC,"No. In 7e anything can hold an objective uncontested. But if an enemy unit contests, neither unit holds it. Obsec, which troops get in CADs and some other formations, let the troops hold objectives even if a non-obsec enemy tries to contest. Two obsec units trying to contest an objective ends up the same as two non obsec, no one holds it. So in the decurion, you give up obsec, where your opponent's troops can take objectives from all your units, in exchange for the decurion formation bonuses."

If he's playing any kind of competitive list, you likely don't have a heretic's chance on Titan.  Try as many flyrants as possible, and units that will tie up his units quickly. MSU might keep casualties down long enough to get to combat, if the deployment is right. So stuff like lictors and mawlocs will be handy to disrupt gunlines, and hopefully the flyrants can crack tanks to allow assault. The devilgaunts are a good call.  The three newest codexes are just so far out of balance with the rest of the game that being competitve is not really an option. If you can get him to tone it down in the interest of fun, great, if not, you'd pretty much have to run a BS spammy unbound list like 4 flyrants and a wraithknight if you want to have a shot."

Warhammer40k,3d2zwr,Asx32,0,Mon Jul 13 05:45:00 2015 UTC,"to be honest, the only way nids will be able to really challange a solid necron decurion detachment will be if either 1) you bring about double his points or b) we'll get a strong new codex in like a year or two (hint: option 2 is probably not gonna happen).  Also bringing a Decurion detachment against a new tyranid player is in my opinion a total dick move, so if i knew that guy i would probably want to punch him. Hard.(please don't do this). Normal Necrons are hard enough to deal with for tyranids with limited resources, so maybe aks him if he would tone down the list a bit for the sake of it not being a one-sided stomp fest (unless he wants that, in which case I would want to punch him again).  if your playing maelstrom of war missions you might have a shot at winning a war of attrition id you can score enough early. With the etearnal war missions maybe not so much. since they only score at the end of the game usually the stronger list just wins because it hase about 4-5 turns of shooting you to bits before needing to actually claim objectives(wich is why i prefer maelstrom of war)   i'd probably try a list with 2 flyrants and A LOT of gaunts maybe even 1 or 2 troop tervigons. The flyrants are basicly just a nuisance to annoy and distract him, since they're probably not gonna deal much damage (with necron decurion youre basicly playing against a bunch of dirt cheap terminators or worse) while the gaunts are just there to tie up as much of his shooting units as possible while still being able to claim objectives. /u/ClutterEater's post is alot more detailed though so take a look at that for tactic advice  I mean don't understand me wrong. Tyranids are really fun if you're playing atleast somewhat balanced opponents, but there are some people/lists where thats not gonna happen unless you're a veteran and know 100% what you have to do in wich circumstance and why."

If you are the Scars, Wolves, either type of angel, or the 1k sons, you don't have rules yet)  The Word Bearers have the most in-depth level of stuff, with the most characters and units. It's explicitly the Word Bearers (at least during/before/after the Horus Heresy) as opposed to the generic Chaos Space Marine book.  A HH WB force might be led by Kor Phaeron, Erebus, or Lorgar himself, leading squads of the Blessed Sons, the Gal Vorbak (possessed that are actually very good!), and so on. It's notably more expensive in $ though, and the Space Marine Legions as armies don't work well at lower point levels. (sub 1500, they struggle) On the other hand, the rules represent WB better, you can still have daemon/cultist allies, and the models look AMAZING."

I also thought about changing the guns on the Tomb Blades, but I thought Gauss might be better against Light transports, then again the Particle weapons are S6. I can probably free up some points.  About Tesla... Are gauss blisters the way to go? I saw math hammer showing that they out perform tesla at short range, and are better against a lot of things over 12"" as well. Is it the Snapfire change that killed them?"
Warhammer40k,3d25uv,Silentone89,1 point,Mon Jul 13 01:48:36 2015 UTC,I tend to use deathmarks as the assassination unit.

Rhythm is after all an intrinsic part in sapient creatures. Even the Ecclesiarchy has giant organs in their churches.  Aside from the humans I am sure that the Eldar have musical instruments as well. Which will produce the most refined sound in the galaxy and be the epitome of musical greatness. If you can also  hear the infra and ultrasounds that is.

Warhammer40k,3d06h3,ssugamer90,3,Sun Jul 12 11:11:33 2015 UTC,"Tigurius and the grav cents are a big investment in a low point game. They are slow, have no invuln, and if your opponent is smart he will either melt them with AP2 or lock them in combat asap, where they get a whopping 3 S5 attacks per turn.   I feel like you would be better off taking a vindicator and lascannon predator for ap2 and anti vehicle duties.    The thunderfire, storm talon and tacs are all pretty good, but you might wanna put the tacs in rhinos to give them some maneuverability, or consider taking scouts instead. I have been having a lot of fun with scouts in land speeders since they got buffed. I give the sergeants meltabombs, and have good general purpose troops. With infiltrate, scout move, and an 18"" flat out you have great mobility, you can be up in their grill on the first turn with a flamer or melta shot, you can jink if they take fire and still shoot the scouts bolters or assault a vehicle (speeders are open topped, so you can assault out of them, though not in the turn you infiltrate/scout) to blow it away with krak grenades and meltabombs. Plus you can annoy your opponent with blind from the cerberus launchers (don't do this every game if you have a friend that plays orks, or they will flip the table)."
Warhammer40k,3d06h3,Uncivil_,2,Sun Jul 12 12:27:45 2015 UTC,"I agree with what you're saying, but I would still like to try to keep OP's list as close to what it is in its current iteration.  Maybe he really likes GravCents?  Space Marines (as a race) suffers from pretty restrictive lists at <1250pts, so I don't think you can avoid ""big investments"" all together.  Starting with the HQ, I would 100% drop Tigurius for a normal Librarian in Power Armor.  He is a supporting HQ (with either the GravCents or a Tac Squad), so he will be as cheap as possible.  Take Lvl2 Mastery to make it easier to cast WC2 spells, but imo that is all he needs.  Being super cheap, he should be clocking in at less than 100pts.  For the Tac Squads, you can now (with the HQ change) take both a heavy and a special.  IMO the best heavy weapon is the Plasma Cannon, and the best special is the Meltagun; this is up for debate though, and you can take whatever you want.  Regardless, I would probably drop the Drop Pods (ha.) for Rhinos or Razorbacks (with Dozer Blades).  The idea is that you want your Tacs to be alive at the end of the game, and if they're inside of a tank, they can't get shot / charged.  Being forced to disembark from a Drop Pod is one of their biggest disadvantages; you arrive, you shoot, and you get killed right away.  I think you can drop one of the GravCents (add him back in at higher point games), and take an additional threat squad.  Currently, you are at a 1 threat comp (the GravCents), making it very easy for your opponents to target and focus down.  I would take a squad of bikes with Gravguns (and/or and Attack Bike squad with Multimeltas).  They do everything GravCents do, but they are more mobile.  With these, you could also drop the Pod for the Cents and just walk them up the field.  When you're ready, you could look into getting a Chaplin / Captain (on bikes), split the 20 Tacs into 3 Squads, and BOOM.  You have a Demi-company!  You won't be able to run the Thunderfire / Stormtalon, but it will be really easy for you to move to higher point games later on."
Warhammer40k,3d06h3,_hei,2,Sun Jul 12 16:12:41 2015 UTC,"Foot slogging grav cents up the table is a good way to spend ~250 points (the minimum squad size is 3) denying an 18"" bubble around them while they get sniped by lascannon/vindicator fire, or charged by a tar pit unit, remember they can't run, so getting them anywhere takes forever, and they can't fire overwatch, so if something gets in assault range you can't even snap shot them with your 15 grav shots.  I do find them fairly fun to play in that they often smash face if you can get them near a viable target, however to do that you need a drop pod to get them into a good firing position, which means taking an allied detachment (you can't give them a drop pod as a dedicated transport in space marines, so you have to take one as a fast attack choice from space wolves or blood angels, which means taking another hq and 2 troop), and in lower point games there are likely to be less land raiders/monoliths/wraith knights around for them to justify their cost.  That being said you're right that if he likes them he should take them, even if just for shits and giggles. He does say he's just playing for fun after all."
Warhammer40k,3d06h3,Uncivil_,2,Mon Jul 13 00:27:30 2015 UTC,"You're right.  I had thought they were 1-3 (like Attack Bikes or Land Speeders).  With Slow&Purposeful, you can walk 6"" and shoot 24"" with the full salvo, so they're not entirely useless.  Turn 1: Walk up, shoot at the nearest thing.  Regardless, it is very difficult to keep them safe unless there is another target that is worth shooting (which was why I suggested taking Bikes with Gravguns).  They are tough, and can control the center of the table fairly well, but not alone.   While I doubt there would be too much AP2 at 1000pts, I definitely think that a list should have at least 2 threats, if not more.  Thinking over it some more, I think cutting down the Tac Squads to 5-man could potentially open up enough points to make that happen.  In such a small game, every model needs to be useful, and I don't see 10 Tactical Marines pulling the same weight as a more specialized unit worth the same points."
Warhammer40k,3d06h3,_hei,2,Mon Jul 13 00:46:29 2015 UTC,"Oh you're right, cannons are 24"", dunno why I thought they were 18"". Yeah 5 man tac squads in rhinos are great for capping and holding points."
Warhammer40k,3d06h3,Uncivil_,1 point,Mon Jul 13 01:46:25 2015 UTC,Thanks for all the replies. I like the 10 man tacs because this will allow me to have a heavy weapon and special weapon (to drop pod next to a tank/serpent/etc)... I just tried this list on my friends eldar and won on turn 1 XD

My only issue with the rhinos is that they basically are killed instantly since I play Eldar most of the time. The drop pods allow me to do disrupt them on turn one. Since we play at such low points the win condition usually ends up being who isnt completely wiped out :P  I think scouts would be a good add though!"

Warhammer40k,3cxw2w,Reyvaan,7,Sat Jul 11 20:02:16 2015 UTC,"Go into a local Games-Workshop and ask them to take you through an intro game. They'll try to force a purchase but you can say you're going to go away and think about which army you want to get. Then go research the armies available, look at the wikias and the images of armies/units.   If you decide to go with Space Marines or Chaos Space Marines then the Dark Vengeance set is probably a good idea, otherwise, see if you can get something you're interested in second hand or if from a independent stockist is selling any relevant products on the cheap."

Dawn of War, Dawn of War II and Space Marine stand out as the best 40k games, generally.  The hobby itself is a bigger investment than either playing the game or just reading up on lore, so its best to set that a little at the back and immerse yourself in the universe first. Once that's done, there's lots and lots of information on communities and the internet about the hobby and getting started."

If you want to get started you will need a rulebook, a tau codex ( not sure if you should rush out to buy this as rumours say a new tau codex might come out in a few months). You will also want to either buy a tau battleforce box or 2 troops and an hq unit. For an HQ I would say the XV8 battlesuit commander, and you have an option of kroot carnivore squad or fire warrior teams for your troop choices. Also be sure that there is actually a place within a reasonable distance to play the game with others."

It is incredibly hard to trade less than 300 points for a wraithknight, as they are worth as much or more than a 400+ point IK.   It's true, it could be a worse matchup with all the wraith stuff on foot, but taking an army like that against any pre-decurion power spike is kind of a jerk move."

He knew I'd bring DE and loaded up on~~ phantoms~~ wraiths?, which is a terrible choice. It was a shooting gallery for me. Neither did he load up on scatter lasers. He tailored a list that I could very well beat which I must applaud him for.  My objective cards were utterly terrible which denied a win, but I could care less. It was a good game.  The phantom knight left a sour taste in my mouth though. One the one hand he needed it to have any chance on winning, and if this were a pre-new eldar game he would have lost utterly.   On the other hand I have no idea what I would be supposed to do if he'd bring a list with the goal of crushing OR if had played anything different.   I don't think I would have gotten a single point with my Blood Angels I.e.  Gargantuan wraith knights are so stupid its beyond me. At home I did the math and figured that I would need something like 40-54 lance shots (depending on cover) to kill a knight, or roughly 2000 points in ravagers (cheapest source of lances).  The ability to get foot-in-ruin 4+ saves plus FnP and IWND makes this unit pretty much invincible to anything that doesn't wield a force weapon with instant death, on initiative.   The difference in survivability of an imperial knight and a wraith knight is ridiculous, even though they cost pretty much the same.   While an imperial knight is something that I could deal with by firepower alone, a wraith knight would require an impossible amount of shooting."

How many victory points did it earn/deny by scaring things away from an objective? Even it's super scary 2 destroyer shots are unlikely to accomplish much if anything smaller than land raiders or tooled up characters aren't targets.  Wraithknights are there to tank. They do it well. Wraithknights are similar to riptides in that they should usually be ignored. Even though poison only affects gargantuan creatures on sixes, DE should be able to bring more than enough poison to bear to reduce dark lances/ blasters required to destroy the wraithknight to manageable levels. Wraithknights are vulnerable to psychic powers, which knights usually aren't.  Get your blood angels some assault cannons, grav guns, bring your unneeded anti-vehicle firepower to bear if the wraithknight is a priority for some reason or the other. Furious charge is FAR from ideal. Blood Angels are a bit weaker against Monstrous or Gargantuan creatures than codex space marines, while Dark Angels with their plasma spam, relic blades and knights are a bit better (except that everyone else now has access to grav centurions....)."
Warhammer40k,3cwaw8,Involution88,2,Sat Jul 11 19:19:57 2015 UTC,"Ignoring a wraith knight can be a very bad idea, if it is played aggresively. Several D-strength guns firing at separate targets, as well as a D-Str close combat weapon that on average will gib a vehicle  a turn. It cant be tarpitted, as Gargantuan Creatures cant be locked in combat, it moves very quickly, and can get into place to knock out core strategic targets without too much issue.   I've got an Iyanden player in my group who uses his Wraithknights very aggressively, and as a deldar player it always feels there isnt much I can do to them. Poison wounds on 6, and he gets a 2 up plus FNP against it. There is no feasible way for poison to even touch them, and anti-tank weapons can only do so much, especially when the Wraith Knight takes out 2-3 of the boats firing them per turn, depending on if he gets a charge off or not.   It's true they are vulnerable to psychic powers, but Deldar don't have any psyskers, unless we ally in Eldar or Harlequins."
Warhammer40k,3cwaw8,GunnedMonk,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:34:13 2015 UTC,"D. Eldar can always take an allied wraithkinght. Yay battlebrothers! :P For some reason Dark Eldar players don't so. Because Wraithknights don't have enough DAKKA and their toughness is a waste since they'll die in 2 turns anyhow...  Since when do Wraithknights get a 2+?  Archon with a blaster, agoniser,  shadowfield (optional but very nice and expensive), armor of misery and properly equipped HARELQUIN allies are all but guaranteed to take out a wraithknight which isn't bubble wrapped (lol Eldar blob hording like IG or Orks... HOW!) on the turn that they arrive. Why don't more people do it? Because it's an ultra specialised selection and using other means of dealing with a wraithknight usually weakens a dark eldar player less under most circumstances and there are usually squishier targets with moar dakka.  Almost any other thing from Dark Eldar can forget about killing a wraithknight in a single turn.  Stomp is pretty nasty, especially against small, elite units like dark eldar have. I don't know of any other reason why gargantuan creatures can't be tarpitted or locked in combat.  With AV 10 open topped vehicles being standard for dark eldar, they need to worry about almost everything. From bolters to lascannons. STR D is hopelessly expensive overkill, with a 1 in 6 chance of simply not doing anything, against paper kites. I do not get why Dark Eldar players, out of the entire player base, get so absurdly worked up about strength D. They are low toughness with swarms of cheap, light vehicles. Their highest AV is AV 11 FFS. Most things are virtually as lethal against them as STR D weapons. Their just jelly cause there's something which is resistant to their lance/poison game. Oh no. There is something which Dark Eldar cannot wipe out on sight... Whatever shall they do.  Taking out 2-3 boats per turn is, or at least should be, unusual without investing in a lot of additional weapons for the wraithknight and targets ripe for plucking. How do you outfit your boats? 3+ jink save raiders are ridiculous against low volume of fire high strength weapons like wraithknights have. More survivable than land raiders against D weapons... Dark eldar vehicles should be more than capable of kiting a wraithknight for at least 2 turns. Wraithknights move very quickly, but so do Dark Eldar."

Warhammer40k,3cyqhx,Coddzills,3,Sun Jul 12 00:11:10 2015 UTC,"If you want to play only Khorne then check out the latest Chaos book called ""Codex: Khorne Daemonkin"" which is a mix of Chaos Space Marines and Daemons all dedicated to Khorne.  They have some cool formations in the book, and you get rewarded when you kill stuff or your stuff dies.  For models probably a good place to start is some Bloodletters and a Chaos Lord on a Juggernaut.  You could also do a Herald of Khorne, or just go crazy and get a Bloodthirster/Daemon Prince.  There's lots of options, but I'd pick up the book first.  Also make sure to look at the 7th edition rulebook, you can get a small version from the Dark Vengeance sets for like 20 bucks on Ebay."
Warhammer40k,3cyqhx,uncleanone,1 point,Sun Jul 12 01:55:11 2015 UTC,"Look no further than the Khorne Daemonkin Codex. Its a combo of Chaos Space Marines and Daemons. Really fun to build up Blood Tithe points to spend on things like army-wide feel no pain or furious charge and rage or even summoning extra daemons to bolster your force mid battle. You get BT points for destroying enemy units, slaying enemy characters in close combat challenges or having your units destroyed. The blood god cares not from whence the blood flows! Certain formations give you bonus BT points to spend but I wouldnt necessarily worry about making formations if you're just starting an army. Blood Tithe points are just a biproduct of the carnage of war and come fairly easily anyway. I would start with a Chaos Lord as they are super customizable and can be made very strong to lead your army. Bloodletters are a good choice for troops as they are cheap and very strong in combat. Their AP3 hellblades make pretty short work of Space Marine equivalents. A popular option for fast attack and probably one of the better units in the codex are the Flesh Hounds. Keep in mind that this is a fairly fast and assault based army and that there aren't as many anti armor options as other armies, especially in with their basic troop options. Bring a Helbrute or Maulerfiend to deal with enemy vehicles."
Warhammer40k,3cyqhx,Cronus41,1 point,Sun Jul 12 01:57:40 2015 UTC,"500 point list i've been running that has worked out alright so far:  herald with loci of wrath -80 pts  5 possessed (pair with herald to always have hatred+fearless) -150 pts  2 squads of 8 bloodletters, each with a bloodreaper -170 pts  helbrute with powerfist+multimelta - 100 pts  the whole thing is a blood host detatchment so you generate extra blood tithe points. everything is in the slaughtercult except the helbrute is the auxiliary choice. basically let your bloodletters soak up fire and generate blood tithe, hopefully get into combat, while you focus on getting the herald+possessed into combat, they do most of the damage in this list.  more often i run the 600 point version which is the same plus a rhino for the possessed/herald and 2 spawn. i find the 600 point list way more effective because the spawn generate a lot of threat during the shooting phase so you can get your rhino through easier to deliver the goods.  hope this helps."

The blue is just caledor sky, then a wash of 80/20 lahmian medium/runefang steel. and the blue metal is just runefang steel that is drenched in guilliman glaze. The effect is that they kind of sparkle, which is pretty sweet.  But yeah no highlights at all, not even dry brushing. The wash seems to negate them so there wasn't much point doing them.

Warhammer40k,3cxoiz,TheSweetJaysus,8,Sat Jul 11 18:31:17 2015 UTC,"The entire army is relentless, so they can always move and shoot. They usually have slightly above average mobility but less than ideal special deployment options. They wont get anywhere fast, but they'll get there without having to sacrifice firepower to do so.  Skitarii do not have any transports or fast vehicles. Their melee units, striders and dragoons are about 50 - 75% faster than other armies walkers. They are imperial, so it's easy for them to get transports from somewhere else, like say an inquisitor. The shoemakers children have no shoes. :P  Skitarii do not have deep strike available to them. They can get drop pods from inquisitors or space marine allies.  Properly upgraded Skitarii Onagers are premier anti-air ground units.  Skitarii do not have any psychic phase. They are vulnerable to psychic powers. They are imperial so could get psykers from elsewhere.  Skitarii have lots of rad and haywire weapons so they have an easier time against low toughness armies and armies with lots of vehicles.  Skitarii and adeptus mechanicus compliment each other well.  Skitarii are above average against: Low tougness infantry (hordes), air units, vehicles. There are options to shore up their weaknesses.  Cult mechanicus are above average against: Monstrous creatures, vehicles, tough infantry (marines, wraithguard, bikers and terminators). There are options, like torrent weapons on Kastelans or electro priests to shore up their weaknesses.  Both Skitarii and Cult mechanicus have poor alpha strike potential. Both have poor artillery and indirect fire. Both lack psykers of any kind. Both lack transport vehicles. Both struggle to use their melee units offensively or as anything other than counter charge units. Both lack air units of any kind.  Skitarii and Cult mechanicus can plug holes in virtually any imperial army."
Warhammer40k,3cxoiz,Involution88,3,Sat Jul 11 21:36:34 2015 UTC,"Skitarii are awesome at shooting. They can put out some serious firepower and have decent mobility for a footslogging army due to Move through Cover, scout, and relentless.   Their melee units are okay, but suffer from the main weakness of the army which I will list in a moment.   They have great armor. Dunecrawlers are fantastic. They are easy to pop but can have fantastic guns and 4++ save if you run 3 in a squad.   The biggest weakness of the Skitarii is: t3, 4+ save. They NEED cover to survive. They are fairly expensive per body and their FnP is worthless because it's a 6 up and most things ignore it anyways.   To get past these weaknesses you can bring in the Cult Mechanicus which have obvious synergies. While still bad in melee, you can run beefy robots. Shooty Servitors with far too many grav shots, and a pretty solid HQ unit.   Together they make a very competitve army. On their own, they are weak. Skitarii are frail and lack enough anti tank (imo) but make up for it with great guns and amazing skyfire coverage. And Mechanicus are expensive models but beefy."

I primed the model black and did the panel lining, but it looked very monochrome.  This is what I've done since:   Prime the model black Panel line with a thinned down base color Clean up the lines with a brush and black paint.  Focus on keeping the lines straight and uniform, while also not too thick Go over this with a thinned down layer color that is lighter, but focus on keeping the line thin Take a thinned down highlight color and focus on the corners/angles   I was much happier with the way that this turned out.

Tyranid Primes are great ""handicap"" units that might make some fun stuff happen if he's not shot off the board; they're not very competitive but are good ""point sinks.""

Warhammer40k,3cvdmf,bset222,9,Sat Jul 11 15:37:36 2015 UTC,"I'd make one change to Legion of the Damned squads: All shooting and melee attacks made by Legion of the Damned units are resolved at +1 AP.  That might sound a little bonkers, but hear me out. LotD fluff repeatedly mentions about how their shots just tear through armour like it's nothing and yet the special rule that relates to that very fluff (Flaming Projectiles) confers Ignores Cover to all shooting attacks, which I feel is a little bit incongruous.  By giving LotD +1 to their AP you get S4 AP4 bolters, SUser AP6 melee, AP3 Krak grenades, plus the regular LotD 3++, Slow and Purposeful and the requirement to deep strike for 25 points a model as standard. LotD squads also get a single Special Weapon, a single Heavy Weapon and the Sergeant gets a Ranged Weapon & Power Weapon choice. Here's how that breaks down with +1 AP:  On the Sergeant, a Power Sword becomes AP2 at initiative, a Power Maul becomes S+2 AP3 at initiative and a Power Lance becomes S+1 AP2 on the turn it charges and SUser AP3 otherwise (so Power Lances would actually be viable for once). Power Fists and Power Axes are functionally the same, but at AP1 they could potentially be better light vehicle busters. Keep in mind, a Legionnaire Sergeant is still only W1 since it's got a Tactical Marine statline. The ranged weapon choices for a Sergeant are pretty straight forward too, a Storm Bolter is AP 4, and Combi-weapons follow their equivalent regular guns like below.  For the Special Weapon choice, the Flamer becomes AP4, and the Plasma Gun becomes AP1. The Meltagun doesn't change, since it's AP1 already.  For the Heavy Weapon, the Heavy Bolter and Flamer both become AP3, Plasma Cannons and Lascannons become AP1 and the Missile Launcher is anywhere between AP5 and AP2 depending on the missile type.  I just feel that a +1 to AP on LotD would suit fluff better and make them a more durable unit since the Sergeant would hit harder in combat and Bolters would be more likely to counter medium and light infantry."

Wracks.  I'm ok with them having a terrible armor save but they need something really small to make them useful.  If they had 2 base attacks or initiative 5 instead of 4 they could be more than just walking target dummies.    Wyches.  They are troops so I'm not asking for them to be amazing.  It would be nice if the Wych cult weapons were better or if you could just get more of them.  Right now you need 5 models to get 1 weapon and 10 models to get 3.  If they changed that to require 9 models then you could have 3 wych weapons and a character in a squad in a transport.  Alternatively, if they could use their 4+ invulnerable save against overwatch it would be nice.  Mandrakes.  They are intended to be infiltrators that ambush units hiding in cover.  They have stealth and shrouded but no actual armor save, this makes them totally garbage in close combat.  Right now, in the rare case they appear, they are used to shoot at things with their 18"" range shitty gun with soulblaze.  Give them a +5 invulnerable or something in close combat to account for them being shadowy and illusive.  Also, I like the idea from the 3rd edition codex where you would secretly deploy them at the beginning of the game.  It would be cool if you could select one piece of terrain and when an enemy moved near it or shot their guns near it, the mandrakes would appear via deep strike within a certain number of inches from the selected terrain.  They don't have to be amazing in close combat, just strong enough to kill a few weak backfield units like snipers or something.    The voidraven bomber needs to be reworked.  Even if it was just armor 11 instead of 10 it would make a big difference without making it too strong.  I also like the idea of something like a formation with 1 bomber and 2 razorwing jetfighters.

These guys are gonna struggle to be useful regardless, as our FA is usually dominated by pathfinders or drones for markerlights, so the fact that they are terrible and expensive right now makes them useless. This way they are effective marine killers, but we have a ton of that already. Alternately, shift them to cc threats. Leave the guns and price as is, make them jump infantry with move through cover, and give them ws4, rending ap5 cc weapons, and an extra attack. Jump, fleet, move through cover, rending, and hit&run lets them be ""legit"" cc threats in an army whose only other cc capable units are two unique hq characters, Farsight and Aun'Shi.  Kroot: raise the range on Kroot rifles with sniper rounds to 36"", drop the shaper upgrade price by 7 points, let the hounds leave and rejoin the unit during movement or assault phase (kind of a release the hounds deal, let them separate and charge on their own if the regular Kroot wouldn't be able to keep up, and allow them to rejoin during any phase they return into unit coherency, not just movement phase), raise s of Kroot and hounds to 4, bring back the ""rifle also counts as 2 cc weapons"" rule while keeping ap5 or give regular Kroot an extra attack base, let all Kroot count as beasts for all movement and charges while in forests. These changes are mostly fluffy cool stuff, but allow Kroot to reliably beat guardsmen and grots in cc, and hold their own against regular ork boyz, Eldar guardians, and DEldar warriors. A 14 point shaper would possibly be useful, while a 21 point model with t3 6+ is totally unusable if the best attack it has is a 24"" sniper rifle.  Sunshark: remove the ""bomb generator might break"" rule, give it multiple bomb profiles, you get pulse for free and can add another for 5 points, pulse bomb as is, emp bomb with s1 ap- large blast haywire, ion bomb with s8 ap4 small blast gets hot.   Razorshark and Sunshark: allow you to take a wing of flyers, up to 3 total of either one, as a single unit.

Warhammer40k,3cx348,Jataai,2,Sat Jul 11 15:20:28 2015 UTC,"My advice would be to torrent the codices you are interested in and proxy some armies (750-1250pts) using cereal box cutouts.  That way, you can ""sample"" all of the units and play styles without committing the time and money it would take to model and paint.  When you find the codex / units you want to field, you can move to the next step.    Look on eBay for similar armies to what you had in mind.  For Space Marines, that is usually pretty easy.  Most of the time you can find models on eBay for 50-70% off of MSRP.   If that doesn't work, you can look to alternative recasters and retailers who usually give pretty steep discounts on new miniatures, ranging from the 20-50% off of MSRP.  Of course you should still support your LGS, so smaller items like paints, independent characters,  and other hobby tools should still be purchased there.   If you're looking for the cheapest army, it would be Dark Angels.  They have the current starter set which includes 10 Tacticals, 5 Terminators, 3 Bikes, 1 Librarian, and 1 Company Master.  The set also includes some chaos stuff, but all together it is $110 USD, which is pretty good considering it comes with a small rule book (big rule book is $85).  If you wanted to expand, you can also buy individual DV squads off of eBay for $10-15 / squad, making it very easy to create 1500pt armies.    DA have two very elite forces, the Ravenwing and the Deathwing.  The RW (2nd company) are a fast moving force composed entirely of bikes and land speeders.  The DW (1st company) are the hard hitting veterans composed entirely of terminators.  You can field 2000pt armies where you have fewer than 40 models on the table when you combine the RW and the DW into a single cohesive force.  The only codex that you will ever outnumber are the Grey Knights.    But, I still think (and most people agree) that the new Space Marines codex is very good.  They have a lot of options (such as Strike Force Alpha, IIRC) that allow for elite armies as well.  You should definitely look into the base codex and explore what it has to offer.  The doctrines that were introduced last edition are very strong, and Space Marines are one of the top tier armies.  Even so, no one is going to complain about playing against you (unlike Eldar) because everyone plays Space Marines!  I would definitely check out the C:SM first before trying out other codices, but if you get a chance, I highly recommend trying out C:DA."
Warhammer40k,3cx348,_hei,1 point,Sat Jul 11 16:12:30 2015 UTC,"when I first dabbled in 40k I used to think that dark angels were for sure one of the best looking armies in the game. However I don't think I'd play space marines again, especially as I sold my old space marines about half a year ago, and to have to buy the same models I sold would be rather painful.  I'll admit I did torrent the Eldar codex, I'd absolutely buy one if I decided to go Eldar but I didn't fancy spending ~£30 just to get a chance to look at the units. I did notice that I can save a bit of money by using ebay, and I probably will do so."
Warhammer40k,3cx348,_hei,1 point,Sat Jul 11 16:51:55 2015 UTC,"Well, a Dark Angels force wouldn't really be like the Black Templar force that you sold (unless you owned ~20 bikes or ~10 terminators...as Templars).  I forgot to address the hit&run play style.  Both RW and White Scars (in C:SM) have Hit&Run to boot, so while you're not using Eldar Jetbikes, you get Space Marine bikes with Hit&Run, Imperial Knights that you can ally with, and Darktalons / Stormtalons in the skies.    Bikes are (imo) the best ""elite"" force, since they can take Gravguns (wound on armor save instead of toughness), are T5, move 12"", and have Jink saves for when it gets hairy.  RW and White Scars bikes also have Scout and Hit&Run, making them hit harder earlier as well as not getting bogged down by blobs.  Eldar bikes (currently) are much shootier than Space Marine bikes, but I don't think they're terribly fun to play as or against.  The ""issue"" with the Eldar jetbikes is that every bike can take a scatter laser.  With the bikes being so cheap, you can effectively get ~40 S6 AP4 shots for ~200pts.  On such a mobile platform that has the statline of a Space Marine, they become very irritating to deal with and can table most elite armies in a few turns.  The armies that I have been talking about are not the Troop heavy armies of 5th ed, where you take Tactical Marines and Rhinos.  The new Detachments either allow for a ton of Tactical Marines with buffs or no Tactical Marines at all.  A RW or White Scars forces can consist of only Bikers; a DW force can consist of only Terminators."

They are crazy powerful right now, to the point where some people won't play against them. Not saying you can't play them, but be aware.  However, have you looked at dark eldar? They are fast, hard hitters, and very much ""elite"" units. They are the most tactically challenging and rewarding codex in the game. By that I mean that a good general who plays smart can absolutely shred most armies, but get caught out of position and your unit dissolves like tissue paper in a hurricane. Plus they are battle brothers with eldar, so you ca  bring in some eldar fan favourites to support. However, PLEASE don't pull webway-deepstriking-wraithguard crap. It's just not good 40k.

Warhammer40k,3cvf3t,simpleymyself,12,Sat Jul 11 02:36:22 2015 UTC,"The answer to all of your questions is: It depends.  It depends on what army you are playing. It depends on what type of mission you're playing. Some of it even depends on your opponent and what he's playing.  The question is too open, and in all honesty, you're better sitting down with the rulebook, reading it, because it will lay out the basics better than we can, and then coming back with specific questions on things you don't understand.  But I try to be helpful, so here goes: 1) An army is comprised of a number of units organized by Detachments and Formations to an agreed upon point value. Except for the times when this is not true.  2) This question doesn't make sense in relation to the one following it. An army is organized by a number of Formations/Detachments that contain units of one or more models. Beyond army creation and establishing special rules, the Formations/Detachments don't play much part once the actual game begins.  3) A squad/unit will contain one or more models. The starting and max size of each unit is established by its Codex entry.  4) Old models are almost 100% of the time not an issue and will be able to be used.  5) Yes.  6) Points are a method of trying to maintain a balance between the two armies being used, so that neither player has an advantage over the other at the beginning of the game."

Warhammer40k,3cvf3t,nattydreadlox,3,Sat Jul 11 11:49:52 2015 UTC,"What makes an army?  A leader or two with a handful of units. How many units go into a squad?  There is no such thing as the generic term ""squad"" in 40k, but the term ""unit"" means something specific and is referred to in rule books.  For example, a UNIT of tactical space marines contains 5-10 MODELS and functions on the tabletop as a single entity.  Can you use your old models?  Yes.  Does weapon choice matter?  Yes, each unit has rules as to what type and how many of each type of weapon it can/must take.  That info can be found in army codexes.  For example, my space marine tactical squad can take 1 special weapon or 1 heavy weapon in a 5 model unit, or 1 special AND 1 heavy in a 10 model unit, additionally the sergeant has his own options for upgrades.  What the hell do points mean?   Each model and wargear upgrade has an associated points cost.  Usually you agree with your opponent, before the game, on a points level (commonly 1500, 1850, 2000) for the game, then you each construct army lists by SPENDING points to BUY units and upgrades for their points cost.  For example, my space marine tactical squad costs 70 points and comes with 4 space marines and 1 space marine sergeant all armed with bolt guns.  For 10 additional points i can replace one space marine's bolt gun with a meltagun.  Each model has stats that determine it's effectiveness in battle.  ALL outcomes of ALL shooting and combat (and other contextual things) are determined by rolling dice. A model's stats and the situation determines what rolls of the dice mean success and what rolls mean failure.  for example, my space marine wants to shoot some one with his 10 point meltagun.  He must make sure he is in range, then roll one die for each shot (in this case, one die), and due to his ballistic skill of 4, he requires a roll of 3 or higher on the die to HIT his target.  i hope this helps"

Warhammer40k,3cvf3t,SmashFucker,2,Sat Jul 11 14:51:23 2015 UTC,"It depends on the army. You never swap stuff out ""during a game"" but add in upgrades when creating your army.

Warhammer40k,3cvf3t,PowerrangerJedi,1 point,Sat Jul 11 22:44:34 2015 UTC,"normally you would physically swap to the correct models before the game.  BUUUUUT, if your play group is cool with it, you can maybe have your heavy bolter COUNT AS a plasma cannon.  this requires you and your opponent to remember what counts as what, and is typically not allowed in a tournament setting."

Warhammer40k,3cygjn,CarnifexBestFex,8,Sat Jul 11 22:37:56 2015 UTC,"Matt has a conversation with people offscreen about rules. He never just says, ""This is how it is and you can't say otherwise."" He will dispute it with the person but they always resolve it by going to the rules. It's hardly cheating to interpret the rules differently than someone else as long as both parties agree in the end. Because of the editing, it looks like he cheats because he mentions the rule and then bam, it happens after a cut."
Warhammer40k,3cygjn,Equinox90,9,Sun Jul 12 00:00:25 2015 UTC,I really don't think that.  I know quite a few people think like you (see Youbube comments...) but I believe it's more because he's really picky with the rules and won't let slip mistakes if he see them and it can looks like he's just being jerk but I think he's as hard on himself.  Anyway I've been watching MWG for a little while now and I think all of them have been more or less accused of cheating in comments so...
Warhammer40k,3cygjn,Payhell,-3,Sat Jul 11 22:50:01 2015 UTC,"Suppose, it's just like he has said he is a ""Rules as Intended"" player, which confuses me. I was watching a Bat Rep the other day and he was shooting a Grav Cannon at a Hammerhead behind cover. Matt then said the Hammerhead doesn't get cover cause it's not a glance or pen, it just causes an immobilized result, which just seemed dumb to think like that. He's probably not thinking properly or as I said, maybe cheating."
Warhammer40k,3cygjn,Magnified,4,Sat Jul 11 22:54:47 2015 UTC,There are plenty of arguments on forums as to whether or not you get a cover save from grav weapons when they don't inflict a glance/pen. Interpreting the rules differently to you doesn't constitute cheating.  Remember that we are not seeing an unedited game and interpretation and discussion can happen off-camera.
Warhammer40k,3cygjn,Magnified,-3,Sat Jul 11 23:03:20 2015 UTC,I suppose
Warhammer40k,3cygjn,Vankraken,9,Sat Jul 11 23:08:16 2015 UTC,Calling out a guy for cheating really should come with a bit more evidence in my opinion.   They make a lot of mistakes at MWG in terms of rules but IMO Matt knows the rules pretty well and wouldn't be stupid enough to purposefully cheat. There's no benefit and so so much to lose.
Warhammer40k,3cygjn,zimmn,1 point,Sat Jul 11 23:17:46 2015 UTC,"Reading the BRB it directly addresses that an obscured vehicle must take a cover save it takes a glance, pen, or otherwise hit by a damaging hit (such as the graviton special rule). I don't think Matt cheats but he got the rule wrong 100%."
Warhammer40k,3cygjn,OnceAmongTheFence,4,Sun Jul 12 18:13:27 2015 UTC,house rules are not cheating as long as both players agree?
Warhammer40k,3cygjn,scrotilicus132,4,Sun Jul 12 00:22:33 2015 UTC,He has his house rules sure. I've seen him fuck himself plenty of times over these things. Also have you never seen him dice roll with his opponent to decide rules that were obviously debated off camera?
Warhammer40k,3cygjn,Magnified,-3,Sun Jul 12 03:47:03 2015 UTC,"Never seen that, I noticed some comments last night on a few videos bringing the loaded dice thing and just him editing rules to benefit himself as well."
Warhammer40k,3cygjn,OnceAmongTheFence,4,Sun Jul 12 09:35:34 2015 UTC,Almost all of the videos they post both players are using the same dice. So loading the dice would do nothing. Also what would be gained by him cheating? He has an entire business to lose if he got caught so why on earth would he do it?
Warhammer40k,3cygjn,Chrytonx,-5,Sun Jul 12 11:39:12 2015 UTC,"He doesn't like to lose. I just think it seems he is. Every Bat Rep that I've seen him roll badly and his opponent roll well, he's always really passive aggressive with them and just moans a bit when he starts to lose with all armies(apart from nids). I don't entirely think he does, it just seems that he always rolls above average and after a certain amount of time it seems like hes loading them to keep rolling that well"
Warhammer40k,3cygjn,Chrytonx,3,Sun Jul 12 11:47:57 2015 UTC,Are you suggesting when he starts to lose he suddenly decides to take out a new set of dice?  Plus how can he roll badly sometimes but also always roll above average?   I've never noticed Matt getting funny/aggressive with opponents when he's losing although he can sometimes come off a bit insensitive when winning. But again this is partly caused by the fact that he is narrating and it is an edited show. Thus it appears as if he just talks over his opponent all the time.   I mean I'm sure that you wouldn't be here making claims without specific instances and links/time stamps of videos right?
Warhammer40k,3cygjn,TheMuscleShark,-1,Sun Jul 12 14:18:23 2015 UTC,"Right, I take back the loaded dice thing for realized both players use the same dice and not two different pools of dice. I'll try find the time stamp for the video where he sounded like he was getting really annoyed at losing."
Warhammer40k,3cygjn,jreilly89,2,Sun Jul 12 14:45:37 2015 UTC,"So one time he gets a bit frustrated with losing, potentially for reasons we cant see because a lot of editing is done, and you call cheats and loaded dice? The only thing you've cited is youtube comments, and that is hardly a proper source.   He makes hundreds of videos, maybe he was having a shitty day, maybe he just rolled really bad and a unit of his didnt do what he thought it would do? many reasons for frustration in 40k that isnt 'i cheated and still lost'"

Free tip for her getting started - full unit of kabalite warriors in a raider with splinter racks will ruin the day of many an infantry unit."
Warhammer40k,3cvl31,wolfsark,1 point,Sat Jul 11 12:46:12 2015 UTC,"2 choices   The succubus.  This model is really awesome.  Full detail and she is a badass chick with enough attitude and character to make a really impressive model.  Nice dynamic pose.  You can't go wrong with this.  Plus its pretty decent in the game.  The succubus will lose challenges to super powerful melee HQs that have 3 or more wounds and weapons that have strength 6 or higher.  However, she will annihilate almost everything else and will win all challenges against any squad sergeants or buff banner HQs like ethereals and necron lords. Scourges.  This is the best option.  The models are very aesthetically pleasing even if you know nothing about them or warhammer.  I've shown my painted scourges to females before and they are often very impressed.  They also have dynamic poses and most importantly, wings.  You can get really creative with how you paint the wings and you can demonstrate to her simple techniques like drybrushing and edge highlighting.  They also look great with lots of color.  Let her go nuts and pick the colors then show her how to apply them properly.  The kit is cheap ($23 and plastic) and comes with lots of extra bits that are mostly interchangeable with Kabalite warriors and Wychs.  They are really good in the game.  They can deep strike behind enemy lines and shoot their haywire blasters at tanks and transports.  It will really make your opponent nervous when you drop these guys near their predators/leman rus/imperial knights.   Sit down with her and talk about which color scheme she wants.  If you can get your hands on the painting poster that came with the White Dwarf issue 66 (the imperial knight warden one) it will be helpful to choose colors and plan your purchases.  If you cant get that specific white dwarf, google image search might help you."

There is no sci-fi TTWG that comes close to having what 40k offers - whereas Fantasy has a number of rivals with equally complex rulesets. What AoS does is offers a beginners set of rules for Fantasy themed play, which is definitely what the landscape needed.  But to answer your question - the way they released Warscrolls is great. Having free codexes is a great thing, and is helping me choose which minis I want to buy from the Fantasy line. The gearing toward releasing campaign books regularly would also be a great touch. And frankly, I love that the models have their dice rolls on their statline rather than a number requiring you to do unnecessary math - which is what trips up most beginners. BS 4 is ALWAYS a 3+, unless there's a modifier. But that modifier can easily be +1 to dice rolls instead of +1 to BS.  But I'm a 7th fan, so I would most likely become an oldhammer player if this happened."

Warhammer40k,3cuunk,Stanucz,2,Sat Jul 11 00:32:42 2015 UTC,"40k cost of entry is not high at all. If you look money wise compared to fantasy, 1 box of tactical marines is your entire squad, going out at 140 points base(but will likely get to around 160-175), whereas in fantasy, 1 box of units is only 1/4 of a unit tray and comes to be only around 100 points for the same price as tactical marines. Not to mention there are so many bundle kits that shave a few bucks off, or the DV,DS, and whatever the spacewolf-ork one is so there is a lot of variance of races to buy into starter sets."
Warhammer40k,3cuunk,Rhino_Starcraft,4,Sat Jul 11 08:13:36 2015 UTC,"Plus rulebook and codex (one per player) - both of which you have to not only buy, but read and understand. Barrier to entry isn't just about cost; it's about time and effort.   With AoS you can buy a box or two of minis each, download four pages of rules and the warscrolls for those units and learn as you play through your first game. Then you can buy more minis and learn their rules.   The beauty of the four page rulebook is that complexity grows alongside your collection. It's worked for loads of games (X-wing being a great example) and I'm stoked to see it here."

Cmon, I could get any hardcover book the exact same size and pages for half that much. At the end of the day, it really is just a book.  Lowering the cost a bit would help stop piracy as well. I know I wouldn't download every book I could if it was even $10 cheaper.   Not to mention the models. I get part of their cost comes from how powerful or elite they are, but 32 bucks for a single dark eldar HQ choice is insane. Its half the cost of their sharstorm box, but for one model.

Warhammer40k,3cuunk,Mojito465,2,Sat Jul 11 00:21:48 2015 UTC,"Well, the industry or market for tabletop wargames has changed a lot. I hate to say it, but if they weren't making money something had to be done. I agree 40k is the real money maker for GW, but I'm not sure that correlates to GW doing well financially overall.  There's a lot of competition for disposable income without even considering other tabletop wargames. AOS is a bold move. But, it's not the only bold move, it's one of many--the furious pace of 40k releases, ever expanding IP applications, and completely revamping a flagship game.  I love 40k, and I hope this isn't a sign of things to come, but if AOS fails...  On the other hand, if it succeeds, it could breathe some life into the game. Units and armies often shift in the power balance. Maybe it is time to take a radically different view of how to balance things. My guess is that having a battle both sides can enjoy is best for the hobby. It's a strange hobby in that people enjoy varied aspects of it without necessarily engaging other parts--like painting and not playing. I think tournaments are good to a point, but competition can go too far. In a way what you or I bring to the table may often be more determinative of a positive gaming experience than the actual army played (though the type of army you play is probably a reflection of yourself anyway).  In the end I applaud the move to make things better, but I'll cautiously wait to see how things develop. It might still be too early to tell."

The Age of Sigmar idea of just figuring out the plot of the battle and working with that seems more fun than just ""bring 2000 points."""
Warhammer40k,3cuunk,LEFUNN,2,Sat Jul 11 12:06:23 2015 UTC,"If they age of sigmar'd 40k, they would go under. Plain and simple. Many people only get into 40k because there is a game behind it. If they tried to make a 4 page rulebook for 40k it wouldnt be pretty. That said i would like leadership (bravery) to play a larger part than it currently does in 40k, like in AOS. I think there is alittle too much fearless and LD 10 currently."
Warhammer40k,3cuunk,gwarsh41,1 point,Sat Jul 11 09:20:37 2015 UTC,"I'm not certain they'd go under, but they'd probably have a rough adjustment period.  I got into 40k because I loved the models and the fluff. It was a cool secondary benefit that there was a fun game to back it up.  Also, totally agree about the Leadership thing."
Warhammer40k,3cuunk,amorrowlyday,1 point,Sat Jul 11 12:02:07 2015 UTC,"Eh,Id play whatever version prior to it. Im not freaking out about aos but I like the structured elements to the games, to 40k. I dont play fantasy so its been east to ignore. Even if the balance in 40k is a little broken its still better than bringing whateever  I dont think that just removing restrictures equalls a better game for me or the peopleI play with. Those restrictures, being point or whatever get people creative - How do I field the units and army I want in the limits I have?  I hope fantasy swings backaround that you get to have both, and AoS serves as a revitalisation period. But I hope 40k doesnt suffer the same fate. Just take HoR KT and make it official ffs, that would create a easy entry for some people.   ps - drunk as fuck, sorry for spellying."

Warhammer40k,3cuys1,Blood_ForTheBloodGod,6,Sat Jul 11 04:13:30 2015 UTC,"No. it triggers on a 6 on the ""armour penetration"" roll, it doesn't need to be a penetrating hit"" already otherwise it would have no use."

One of Orks strengths is how varied Ork lists are and hard it is to predict what they will field."
Warhammer40k,3cuvfw,Vankraken,1 point,Sat Jul 11 00:34:50 2015 UTC,"OP, don't go with Orks unless you seriously want to play Orks. The shit is expensive and you're going to be painting somewhere in the 3 digits worth of models. Trust me, pick something else."

Blood Angels are what i've been playing for many years. They are surprisingly tough, not necron tough mind you, but surprisingly durable all the same. It's often a fun army to play as games come down to the final turns even if outmatched.  Given your criteria I wouldn't play IG/AM as it's a very different experience. Generally with guard i send at least three squads to do what a space marine squad is supposed to do (and they all usually still die horrible brutal deaths)."
Warhammer40k,3cuvfw,NearBrew,3,Sat Jul 11 00:33:35 2015 UTC,"If you want something different from Necrons but still slow-but-relentless, Minotaurs might be an interesting and unusual choice.  However, it requires buying into Forge World to build your best units.  Otherwise, if you want to psyker your enemies to death while drinking their tears, daemons are a viable option."
Warhammer40k,3cuvfw,manatrance,3,Fri Jul 10 23:45:28 2015 UTC,"Well, Khorne Daemonkin are allies of convenience with Necrons. With the added benefit of building them pretty much however you like after you pay the possessed tax.  Your hq can be a csm lord, daemon prince or bloodthirster. I like to think of this as light medium and heavy.  Your troops are cultists, bloodletters, berzerkers or csm. Again light, medium and heavy.   After that you get to pick up to 8 auxiliary formations and the option of a command formation. Just like the decurion. So the force organization will be familiar and flexible.  They also get lots of cool extra goodies in the form of special items, and the ability to add buffs or summon extra guys with the blood tithe table."

Warhammer40k,3cs2if,Mianthadore,3,Fri Jul 10 11:43:20 2015 UTC,"Thanks! If you are going to try do it with brushes like I did be wary.   If you water your paints too much they seep through the tape, if you don't water them enough they form little ridges against the tape as they dry. Might be better to thin your paints with medium instead of water, but I'm just guessing there, never tried it.   Next time I try this I'm going to spray some waterproofing stuff on the tape and be a lot more careful and patient with the painting to avoid the splotching and ridges I had to contend with on this one."
Warhammer40k,3cs2if,Mianthadore,2,Fri Jul 10 11:48:15 2015 UTC,"Hmmm, I actually have some waterproof painting tape in my toolbox. I might see if it'll be up to the task. Thanks for the tip!"
Warhammer40k,3cs2if,TheKoop,2,Fri Jul 10 12:03:16 2015 UTC,"If you have trouble with ridges, try Green Frog tape. It's a particular brand that is super absorbent and will actually actively reduce buildup and spill under."
Warhammer40k,3cs2if,A_Lictor_BLOR,3,Fri Jul 10 13:09:20 2015 UTC,"I like what you've done here. I always thought that Tau should have a combination of camo and dazzle style paints. Since they are alien, and quite possibly see in different spectral ranges, adding high contrast, 'neon' colors to the paint scheme was also very appealing. Good job!"
Warhammer40k,3cs2if,sizzlebutt666,3,Fri Jul 10 13:04:07 2015 UTC,Do these things actually only come with a Burst canon and pair of drones??? Kinda weak eh?
Warhammer40k,3cs2if,Vankraken,2,Fri Jul 10 13:05:25 2015 UTC,"To be honest with you, they are pretty underwhelming. You can swap the burst cannon for a fusion blaster, but at BS3 they are pretty much useless without markerlight support. They are fast skimmers though, so kinda handy for claiming uncontested objectives.   They might be more viable if they were cheaper or had twin-linked."
Warhammer40k,3cs2if,Candida_Albicans,1 point,Fri Jul 10 13:18:49 2015 UTC,"They are dirt cheap as is when you factor in the drones they come with are worth 24 points. Drop off the drones and you have a dirt cheap fast skimmer with a burst cannon that can grab objectives, jink, and draw gun fire away from more valuable units. They operate under the same principle as a Deffkopta of being a distraction. The unloaded drones can act as a speed bump or provide minor fire support to other units.  They aren't flashy or heavy lifters but they provide mobile scoring that are easily disposable and are unattractive for the enemy to waste shooting on. If they get in the back field then they can be a real thorn in the enemy's plans when you have a loose fusion blaster or burst cannon shooting at backfield infantry or hitting the rear armor of the enemy vehicles."
Warhammer40k,3cs2if,sizzlebutt666,1 point,Fri Jul 10 23:13:53 2015 UTC,"Not sure how they play with the new codex and editions, but in the past they were primarily useful as a speed bump/ movement blocker."
Warhammer40k,3cs2if,Candida_Albicans,1 point,Fri Jul 10 19:48:44 2015 UTC,I'd argue that's pretty useful with the low AP and high range of Tau arsenal
Warhammer40k,3cs2if,GhostdadUC,1 point,Fri Jul 10 20:56:23 2015 UTC,"They can definitely be useful in the right hands. They are also pretty cheap. When you factor in the cost of the gun drones (also useful as a movement blocker), you're paying something like 20pts for the actual piranha."
Warhammer40k,3cs2if,TheKoop,1 point,Fri Jul 10 21:17:52 2015 UTC,They are extremely underwelming and cost 40 points for that burst cannon and 2 gun drones.  Possibly one of the worst models in the game.
Warhammer40k,3cs2if,Mahrt,3,Fri Jul 10 13:47:52 2015 UTC,Loving it. I always imagined Tau vehicles having a tiger stripe pattern... it just seems to fit.

Warhammer40k,3cujkc,mrsc0tty,3,Sat Jul 11 02:27:26 2015 UTC,"Depends what you want them to do. Necrons care very little about leadership, and rarely want to be in close combat (some normal reasons for wanting large squads) but the Necrons do have access to a lot of ""force multipliers"" like the Resurrection Orb. That's the other reason for big squads-if you have a thing that gives a bonus to ""the unit"" you want the unit as big as you can make it."
Warhammer40k,3cujkc,mrsc0tty,1 point,Fri Jul 10 22:23:43 2015 UTC,If you're playing maelstrom then go with the smaller groups. More objectives can be held that way.

The Imperial Guard, on the other hand, have the combined squads rule, allowing you to combine your infantry platoon squads together to maximize their melee power and buff-reception or keep them apart to give you more flexibility in shooting and maneuver."
Warhammer40k,3cujkc,locolarue,1 point,Sat Jul 11 01:52:18 2015 UTC,"Morale is important here, if you have a squad of 3 then one death will mean the squad has to take a leadership test, but your opponent can only kill a maximum of 3 men for each of his shooting units. My advice would be to have enough troop units to capture control points, so 3 squads of 10 would be good, I might go with 4 squads of 8,8,7,7 to hold 3 objectives and annoy the enemy, or hold 4 and win if you end up with 6 objectives on the board.

Warhammer40k,3cq1kn,feor1300,4,Fri Jul 10 01:58:28 2015 UTC,"Here's a bit on Lexicanum about them.  The primary references are the short story ""The Lightning Tower"" by Dan Abnett, where Rogal Dorn muses about their missing statues and what it means, and the novel The First Heretic by Aaron Dembski-Bowden, where Lorgar mentions the Emperor ordered that they be forgotten - and there's also a suggestion in that book that the Ultramarines' ranks were increased by absorbing whatever remnant of the II and XI Legions survived their erasure from the record.  Abnett's novel Prospero Burns also hints that the punishment of Magnus and the Thousand Sons might not be the first time Leman Russ and the Space Wolves were used to punish a Primarch and his Legion for disobeying the Emperor."
Warhammer40k,3cq1kn,feor1300,1 point,Fri Jul 10 02:43:52 2015 UTC,"The last printing of Visions of Heresy had the regular Space Marine legion chart, with one of the two legions listed as ""lost"" and the other listed as ""expunged"" (or things to that affect). Which suggests to me that one of the Legions turned away from the Emperor, and the other was destroyed fighting them. (with the Ultras picking up the survivors of the destroyed legion)"
Warhammer40k,3cq1kn,mithiasis,1 point,Sun Jul 12 03:17:19 2015 UTC,"That's an interesting distinction. It's a shame that it's not consistently presented that way.  The problem I have always had with the second and eleventh Legions is that I can't easily imagine what could have gone wrong with them that was worse than the nine Legions that turned Traitor. Like, what's worse than turning half the Imperium against the Master of Mankind?  The only thing I could come up with was maybe one Legion's Primarch was never located (or was found dead) and so they were ""cancelled"" as a project and folded in with the Ultramarines, or wiped out in combat before their Primarch could be found (although that doesn't explain why they weren't recreated if and when the Primarch was found).  Perhaps the other's Primarch immediately rejected the Emperor more vehemently than Mortarion or Angron did, or even died trying to kill him, so his Legion was expunged from the record as unsuitable.  Even with the line about the Ultramarines' ranks swelling, it's possible that their influx of new recruits was from absorbing the human recruits already earmarked to join the missing Legions, so it still works with a narrative where a Legion was wiped out.  I guess in general it makes sense to me that the Emperor might have wiped away all records of a failed Legion project, which is distinct from the notion of the otherwise successful Legions turning traitor.  Or it could be as simple as the Emperor being all but dead at the end of the wars of the Heresy, and no longer able to issue the orders that would see the traitor Legions erased from the record."

I'd probably want some screamers in your fast attack instead of all khornedogs, the dogs are good, but they work fine in squads of 10, some screamers would give you jetbike mobility for snagging different objectives. Plague drones are also good, with death's heads they can shoot and scoot, and move around too.   More daemon princes are always good too, and if you get Be'Lakor you can run some invisibility shenanigans, invisible seekers of slaanesh are stupidly good, especially if you get them the move through cover locus.   also how do you have your prince aligned?"
Warhammer40k,3cu0nd,just_some_Fred,2,Sat Jul 11 03:26:27 2015 UTC,"Also have 6 Flamers and 4 Beasts of Nurgle, 10 PB, a Herald of Nurgle and 10 Blood letters. DP has a Staff of Change and the Mark of Tzeentch on him."
Warhammer40k,3cu0nd,Mojito465,2,Sat Jul 11 03:56:57 2015 UTC,"So the list I would make with these models would be :   Daemon prince tzeentch, lesser, exalted, wings, armor, ML3 Herald of khorne on juggernaut, exalted locus, lesser reward Herald of Nurgle, greater locus Pink horrors x10 Plaguebearers x18 Flesh hounds x20 Soul grinder, Slaanesh, torrent Soul grinder, Slaanesh, torrent   CAD2   Bloodthirster with greater Beast of Nurgle x2 Beast of Nurgle x2 Nurglings x3 Nurglings x3   so basically the idea is to camp your troops on objectives in cover and send everything else to try and tarpit the necrons until the game ends. Cover is pretty much everything here, any kind of ruins you can get on the table will give your nurgle stuff a 2+ save, which will make them really hard to shift.   A lot of strategy will go into placing objectives here, so make sure you can get them into terrain as much as possible. If you can make them spread out it would also help you, keep those nurglings for deep striking on out of the way objectives."

Warhammer40k,3cu081,Colemonstaa,1 point,Fri Jul 10 20:15:37 2015 UTC,"The SR could have shot 3 of his four missiles at full BS in addition to the other weapons.   usually terrain can work to keep opponents away, but with skimmers that's more difficult. Nonetheless you should try to keep your expensive units away from his D weapons, just like you should try to keep your tanks out of heavy weapon's LOS."
Warhammer40k,3cu081,Colemonstaa,2,Fri Jul 10 22:30:42 2015 UTC,"Look up the Sicaran Tank. Literally designed to down serpents, and the eldar have a REALLY tough time dealing with AV13 at long range. Once the serpents go down, then the wraith are neutered. Gun them down from a nice safe distance while they plod menacingly.   But yeah, in general, this list is a jerk. Msu tankhunters can help, but its hard to keep them cheap enough to make killing one serpent worth the price.   It's also just really frustrating that you can't bring any fun models. Land raiders and termies, footslogging greater daemons, monoliths, carnifexes, any beastly assault unit, even wraithknights are all useless against a wraithwing army. It sucks a lot of the fun out of the game when you can't bring your centerpiece models. I play against this list a lot, and I have won, but pretty much only with msu cultist, spawn, and lesser daemon spam, which is so boring I don't even enjoy the win. As far as I'm aware, only tau have a shot without tailoring a list to counter."

Breachers can be ""okay"" but they're so massively overshadowed by other options it's like, why bother. The Ballistari has more of a niche than the breachers and that's saying something.   -The Dominus. I keep him minimal with the Vehicle Scyer thing relic. I love that relic, it's just so god damn good. I put him in the back of the guard blob and repair my Onagers with him.   -Destructors, I run Grav because at this point it's just flatly better than plasma any time you can take it. Plus, I have other ways to slap down light infantry and vehicles that would care about the S7 of the plasma.   -the best the skiitari have is min-sized squads with 2x weapons in a chimera/on foot, or Onagers with neutron lasers or Icarus arrays.

CM on it's own is also a bit overfocused on anti-tank power (only the grav weapon on the Kataphrons has more than two shots, and the models are 50 points a piece, so it's not like you have tons of them. Kastelans can get nine shots, but that forgoes them having any CC ability, and it's only 18 shots out of a 300 point unit.  Adding in some Rangers or Vanguard would definitely help, and maybe Onagers with Eradication beamers to put out some large blasts."

Warhammer40k,3cs9g7,Traveledfarwestward,1 point,Fri Jul 10 10:39:45 2015 UTC,"Games Workshops eBook prices are heresy.  I don't mind, when i'm buying a physical copy, but for something that has zero production costs for them, it'd be nice to have the prices properly reflect that."
Warhammer40k,3cs9g7,Buinovsky,4,Fri Jul 10 12:37:08 2015 UTC,"zero production costs for them   Writers, editors, server and hosting costs. (possibly tech support? I dunno if they run their own servers)  Sure it's still probably cheaper than a physical copy, but not by as much as you might think."
Warhammer40k,3cs9g7,ReaperOfCaliban,2,Fri Jul 10 13:16:21 2015 UTC,"It seems unreasonable to me that they charge prices like these, when Amazon sells digital copies of books at a literal fraction of the cost (often 70%+ cheaper) comparative to physical.  This to me implies that the cost of distributing files that are maybe all of 2 MB takes near no toll for them to distribute."
Warhammer40k,3cs9g7,Buinovsky,2,Fri Jul 10 13:28:03 2015 UTC,"Amazon is also a beast in size compared to GW (at least in terms of books) so they can dissipate the server costs and stuff across millions of books, GW doesn't have millions of books. Also GW books probably don't sell as well either, so they keep prices up to prevent loses. Also they're greedy as shit.  The sheer volume of digital books Amazon sells, allows them to keep prices down. Not sure how many GW sells compared to physical."
Warhammer40k,3cs9g7,ReaperOfCaliban,2,Fri Jul 10 13:30:35 2015 UTC,I'd love to know why GW don't distribute through Amazon.  It's prevented me from buying their books so many times. I feel ripped off if i pay over $10 for a digital book.
Warhammer40k,3cs9g7,Buinovsky,3,Fri Jul 10 13:34:42 2015 UTC,Probably because Amazon would take a cut.
Warhammer40k,3cs9g7,ReaperOfCaliban,2,Fri Jul 10 13:37:06 2015 UTC,"GW seem rather short sighted sometimes.  Their products reach would amplify by a massive amount, even if there was a loss from each sale, i firmly believe that not only would they sell more books over all, it would get others interested in the hobby, which could lead to more people interested in the hobby side of things."
Warhammer40k,3cs9g7,Buinovsky,1 point,Fri Jul 10 13:39:30 2015 UTC,"I think you are over estimating the amount of people who will consider reading GW books. Not to mention even if many more people read them, the main issue with people starting this hobby is the cost of it. Reading a book doesn't make the models cheaper.  Sure it will definitely get more people in the hobby, but enough to make up for the loss of money on their books... ehhhhhhh not necessarily.  edit: Business is complicated. And as much as people hate on GeeDubs, they've been at it for a while now, they have some idea of what they are doing."

Warhammer40k,3cs2tn,Tsumugi123,6,Fri Jul 10 09:03:26 2015 UTC,"If you can swing it, save 200 points and buy the storm wing instead of the AA force. A good start, imo, is taking kor'sarro khan instead of smashfucker, to give everything you have SCOUT. Drop to 5x dev each for another ~60 points, and you only need another 50 points. Drop 4 bikers (should give you room for an upgrade or two on the flyers).  That's my suggestion, the AA force is a gigantic points sink if the enemy doesn't bring flyers, while the storm wing will always be useful (unless it gets lost until T4...)  Regarding smashy, you don't have a CC unit to support him, so Khan's tactical flexibility will be more valuable, imo. You want your bike units to spend most of their time out of combat, not in, and with scout allowing you to park 15 bikes, 8 razorbacks, and 30 tacs with 6 meltas in their deployment zone on turn 1, that should go pretty well for you."
Warhammer40k,3cs2tn,likethesearchengine,2,Fri Jul 10 12:37:32 2015 UTC,"Nail on the head right here.  Unless you get a command squad with Apoth to go with smashfucker Khan is a much better choice.  I do think D weapons take away FnP right?  If that's so then really a lot of the best parts that make smashfucker so tanky is straight up ignored :/.  Still alright, just not as efficient as Khan would be like what was said above."
Warhammer40k,3cs2tn,mutten006,0,Fri Jul 10 19:20:01 2015 UTC,Not only that but Khan gives you hit and run to keep your units in and out of combat when you want.
Warhammer40k,3cs2tn,Pied_Piper_11,5,Fri Jul 10 15:30:38 2015 UTC,Hit&Run is from the White Scars chapter tactics (along with improved Jink)
Warhammer40k,3cs2tn,_hei,2,Fri Jul 10 16:31:49 2015 UTC,Use a CAD for white scars.  Most of your units on this formation won't benefit much from their chapter tactics.
Warhammer40k,3cs2tn,Werxes,3,Fri Jul 10 19:45:05 2015 UTC,"Depends on if you take kor'sarro khan. Scout makes this formation pretty brutal. All bikes and transports can move 12""after deployment,  6"" during movement,  and unload 6""  that's right,  all your bikes and tacs are in the enemy deployment zone on turn 1. Not to mention 8 TL hb sorting 6"" outside their deployment. Anything at T4 should be absolutely clobbered, especially with tactical doctrines."
Warhammer40k,3cs2tn,likethesearchengine,2,Fri Jul 10 20:22:20 2015 UTC,"So I want to play Scars w/ Khan in a really Tanky Command Squad. I've put them on bikes (obviously), give 3/5 of them Gravs/P.Swords/SS, make one a Champion and the other an Apothecary.   I've used a lighter version of this at 1000pts, and it was able to stand up to some Thunderwolves for a few turns of combat. (H&R of course.)"
Warhammer40k,3cs2tn,greypiper1,1 point,Sat Jul 11 20:58:11 2015 UTC,"H&R?  Anyway, just do 4 shields and an apothecary, and spend the 50 or 60 points, plus a few from elsewhere, to grab a chaplain or stormseer on a bike."

Warhammer40k,3cs2tn,3point141592653,5,Fri Jul 10 13:54:55 2015 UTC,"Take solace in the fact that a razorback isn't worth 55 points. That said, it is definitely BS.   Any of the big 7E codices (necrons, eldar, SM) are pretty BS with their restrictive formations. Necrons get free points via bonuses to RP. Eldar get free platforms, but most of their bonus comes in unit power imo (WK and WG buffs, for example). Marines get the most 'retail' free points, definitely, though."
Warhammer40k,3cs2tn,likethesearchengine,2,Fri Jul 10 14:26:26 2015 UTC,Daemonkin get a free bloodtithe...  Yeah the daemonkin one doesn't really compare...

If means a lot less flex ability. But these formations do seem to be a money grab by GW, I mean who has 8 or 9 rhinos or Razorbacks already and painted for one army?"

Warhammer40k,3cor28,opticle,6,Thu Jul 9 16:40:40 2015 UTC,"Prime white while on sprue  Assemble and touch up white  Wash whole model with light coat of seraphim sepia, pooling it a little in the crevices.   Paint carapace nargaroth night purple, wash with nuln oil, edge with genestealer purple, drybrush white on edges.    Paint claws and spikes black, put a thin layer of Khorne red, then more mephiston red toward the tips, then touch up the tips and edges with evil Suns red.  This creates the fade from bright to dark.    Wash mouth/tongue, fleshy bits with Crimson wash.    Paint eyes Calaban green, highlight with light green and thin touch of white for glow.    Use a combination of Crimson wash, waywatcher green glaze, and Nurgles rot to make the dripping, acidic, gross bits.   Apply 'Ardcoat and Blood for the Blood God paint for gloss and grossness for flavor.    Base is Strickland mud, nuln oiled and highlighted, with two tones of flock glued on."

Warhammer40k,3cor28,Muu83,1 point,Thu Jul 9 23:15:51 2015 UTC,Love the purple armour plates and the shading/blending on them. How did you do that?
Warhammer40k,3cor28,ShootyFex,2,Thu Jul 9 16:59:31 2015 UTC,Gave full description in other comment. :-)
Warhammer40k,3cpyj4,jeffe_el_jefe,6,Thu Jul 9 20:58:56 2015 UTC,"How about a base? If this is a blown up dread, then there must be mor epieces of it around. Some might have been blown further, but some would have stayed close by. That, and a base would let you cover the edges in sand/dirt effectively and have it blend into the ""ground"", as well as glue some of those other bits of the dread around. Maybe it's in a crater. Having a base though makes the piece of terrain look well, more like a piece of terrain, and gives more design flexibility  Also, depending on how long it's been destroyed, either carbon scoring or rust would be good as well."
Warhammer40k,3cpyj4,notmuch_23,1 point,Fri Jul 10 00:17:52 2015 UTC,"If the pictures were a hig enough resolution, you would be able to see my faile attempts at rust lol.  As for the base, I have no spare bases and nothing to make one with, except some amazingly detailed craters that I feel would go to ware a small peice of terrain like this. Any ideas?"
Warhammer40k,3cpyj4,notmuch_23,1 point,Fri Jul 10 21:49:42 2015 UTC,"HDF/hardboard/masonite is a good choice if you have a jigsaw, otherwise matboard is an option as well but is more succeptible to warping. Sheet styrene doesn't warp, but is more expensive."
Warhammer40k,3cpyj4,jimtheclowned,3,Sat Jul 11 17:33:03 2015 UTC,"Bullet holes and weathering/ scratches.   For bullet holes, using a hand drill or modelling knife, you can manually make holes. Just be sure to group them together so it seems like a concentrated burst. Also add some minor cracks after the holes are done...of course practice this on spare sprue first to get a hang of it. You can use a small file to then smooth out some of the impact craters if you wish, or round out the holes.  Weathering/ scratches. Easiest way in my opinion is to just dry brush a small amount of some metallic silver colour over the plate armour, focusing on edges and areas which would come under heavy contact. There is no physical way something as tough and big as a dread will get blown to bits, but still have pristine armour and paint job."
Warhammer40k,3cpyj4,mutten006,1 point,Thu Jul 9 22:33:52 2015 UTC,Came here to say this one.  It looks just a little too clean to be ruined.  If you face a primarily Tyranid army one cool thing would be to glue a broken scything talon onto it.  That'd be pretty awesome if you ask me haha.
Warhammer40k,3cpyj4,DaPino,2,Fri Jul 10 13:37:12 2015 UTC,"I actually have some spare talons, so Il definitely do that!"
Warhammer40k,3cpyj4,F_Dingo,2,Fri Jul 10 21:50:44 2015 UTC,"What would make it a bit better, in my opinion, is some dirt.   Mix some PVA glue with sand, it's really good for getting some textured dirt on models and particularly for things like this, making it look like it's sunk a bit into the ground from the weight if applied around the edges.  Paint job however, nice job. It's aesthetically pleasant to have things like this laying around."
Warhammer40k,3cpyj4,The_Pastmaster,1 point,Thu Jul 9 21:34:29 2015 UTC,"thanks!  I tried some dirt, but the sand I bought was too thick il try or again, and thanks for the PVA idea.
