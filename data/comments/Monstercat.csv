Monstercat,3e32yx,MieVai,-1,Tue Jul 21 16:13:52 2015 UTC,"Eh... I mean it does look better, but I feel that it ruins the whole consistency idea of the new template. I kinda wish a variation of this was the main template though.  Also I like borders on album arts (like on the old alternate art layout)"
Monstercat,3e32yx,Bloq,4,Tue Jul 21 17:31:33 2015 UTC,I feel that LP's need something special as they are so rare. Thin borders would look good tho
Monstercat,3e32yx,Li3ra,4,Tue Jul 21 18:23:42 2015 UTC,odd no clash of clans jokes yet...
Monstercat,3e32yx,Chingyl,7,Tue Jul 21 16:59:56 2015 UTC,because stating its name is a joke itself
Monstercat,3e32yx,mattrchambers,3,Tue Jul 21 17:05:27 2015 UTC,the game itself is also a joke  feel sad for me i was addicted to it for 1.5 years

Monstercat,3e32yx,curiousparallax,2,Tue Jul 21 16:43:36 2015 UTC,I like it. I like it alot. This album is going to be great.

Monstercat,3e32yx,MieVai,2,Tue Jul 21 16:15:46 2015 UTC,Is it good? What is tempo?
Monstercat,3e32yx,curiousparallax,2,Tue Jul 21 16:18:18 2015 UTC,it's like a deep future housy vibe
Monstercat,3e32yx,mastalukedjhero,2,Tue Jul 21 16:44:06 2015 UTC,Varien said he had a future house song on the album so this is probably it

Monstercat,3e26z2,WusabiiHead,11,Tue Jul 21 11:35:14 2015 UTC,"IDM. Try Mr. Bill and Aphex Twin  Also try shadient's stuff. It's experimental I guess. He labels it Poison on Soundcloud but says he doesn't think that should actually be the name of the genre. I've also heard it be called Noise (in a non derogatory way) but he seemed to take offense to that. Anyways, it's really dark stuff. And the most bass heavy stuff I've ever heard. I was playing Neurofunk and stuff in my mom's car one day when his Fellow Feeling Remix came on. Her speakers and subwoofer haven't been the same since."
Monstercat,3e26z2,ZephyruSOfficial,3,Tue Jul 21 12:57:56 2015 UTC,Was about to suggest IDM and noise. Good on you for getting to that first!
Monstercat,3e26z2,Benguy12,3,Tue Jul 21 13:40:27 2015 UTC,Holy shit the combo of the music and the video is absolutely terrifying. 10/10
Monstercat,3e26z2,Mabbubupu,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:47:22 2015 UTC,Yeah Aphex Twin is insane
Monstercat,3e26z2,ZephyruSOfficial,2,Tue Jul 21 15:33:34 2015 UTC,I was actually referring to shadient's remix of Fellow Feeling
Monstercat,3e26z2,Mabbubupu,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:36:13 2015 UTC,Oh there's a video?

Monstercat,3e26z2,FlakeyBear,3,Tue Jul 21 12:44:47 2015 UTC,"IDM Breakcore (chopped Amen break madness) Drill and Bass (if you want to get hit by snares) Gabber (like hardstyle around 180 BPM) Techno (+ ambient, house, Detroit and minimal styles) Microhouse Breakbeat Vaporwave, sometimes it's more than slowing down music. Footwork/Juke Baltimore/Jersey Club"
Monstercat,3e26z2,Mevdik,2,Tue Jul 21 15:31:48 2015 UTC,"Witch House is one of my fav genres, so I'll recomend you Crystal Castles (Not In Love, Suffocation and Doe Deer are pretty good).  I made a track inspired by their style a few weeks ago: Mevdik - Broken Things"
Monstercat,3e26z2,dinoslapshot,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:35:28 2015 UTC,Other than the new Rootkit release there hasn't been much Bass House on Monstercat. I'd recommend the new JVST SAY YES EP on Disciple Recordings as well as Oliver Heldens' debut under the alias HI-LO.
Monstercat,3e26z2,Princ3w,2,Tue Jul 21 15:13:33 2015 UTC,um.. makes some weird ass trap that'll never be on Monstercat.
Monstercat,3e26z2,skjefool,5,Tue Jul 21 12:02:30 2015 UTC,you mean something like this?

Monstercat,3e26z2,Rovvan-a-boat,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:48:24 2015 UTC,"Listen to some Daktyl, his songs are huge. I'd classify most of this as experimental trap.  Another good artist is Slow Magic, it's a little more mainstream, but has a cool and unique sound. This is some weird dancy stuff.  Saturn Gives out some killer vibes and he's only seventeen! His music is rad. Probably mostly considered future bass, but it's got a different sound.  Another young guy creating amazing music is Grynpyret. Still future, but in a different way from what we've been hearing in monstercat.  Tennyson is always worth sharing for their cool, jazzy sound that they incorporate into all their music.   Anyway, I figure I could put a dozen more but nobody would want to look through all that crap so I'm ending it here. Thanks for listening!"

Monstercat,3e26z2,thealexkimmy,2,Tue Jul 21 16:07:30 2015 UTC,Here:  * flumestep  * festival trap  * big room (that spinnin records shit) * chillstep   I highly recommend Flume.  Edit: I wouldn't recommend VINAI for big room; a lot of their songs sound similar.
Monstercat,3e26z2,caseif,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:59:23 2015 UTC,Monstercat has released an enormous amount of big-room.
