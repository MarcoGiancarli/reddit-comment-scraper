You've got to see this behavior for what it is -- a woman using or attempting to use her status as woman to get a pass through life.  It's about how you see things --- if you see this as a black chick thing then you are totally NOT going to see it when your lily white wife or girlfriend tries the same move on you ----- we can then read about your woe in r/pussypass.  This isn't about social justice fool - it's about understanding the dynamics of how the pussy pass works so you can see it coming.

We are no longer dating because of his infidelity. On October 23, 2010 I had found out that he had been cheating on me and I was done with the relationship. That day, Joseph was coaching a game of flag football and my son was on the team. I sent him a text message and asked him to bring our son home to me. He text back that he would not do that. So I called him. He picked up his phone and called me a bitch. He also told me that I was not getting my child back. Joseph then threatened me and said if I come to the park there would be people waiting for me and hung up the phone.  I went to the park with a friend to pick up my son. I took my son off of the field and brought him to the car. Jospeh followed me and started getting in my face. He was screaming at me so hard that his spit was landing on my face. He then pushed me against my friends car. He grabbed my shirt and arms while threatening to hit me. I was pushed up against the car, and reached inside to grab a bat. I tried to hit him in self defense and in the process his window was broken. I had no choice but to protect myself. Joseph was charged with domestic violence in 2006 and I know what he's capable of.  Joseph is a deadbeat who doesn't even care to see his children. I have full custody of them and this is his way of trying to get revenge.

And that's the point - she's not expected to push a car, but still does it and I think it's fair to use that in an argument.

I've seen it in every video I've ever seen from India.  I've never seen any other multi-lingual culture do this.  I even spent a year in South Africa where there are 11 official languages and even most young children are multi-lingual, but I've never seen people swap mid-sentence back and forth between languages.  Why do Indians do this?"
pussypassdenied,3dqmbe,khanweezy1,11,Sat Jul 18 21:33:46 2015 UTC,"In Pakistan (which used to be part of India) it's kind of used as a way of showing off. In general, the higher your level of education and status, the more fluent you will be in English.

And the dude that calls her out uses English to throw it in her face that class don't mean shit if you gonna act like that."

If you can come up with some better insults, that would be absolutely fantastic but a pre-pubescent moron spamming ""xD"" over and over, that doesn't quite constitute as an ""insult"" in my book, maybe that's why you're going to be stuck working at McDonalds while the rest of us actually have a career.  Have fun in school, little buddy. <3   Edit: I did a quick search for a ""A wild knight appears"" and no memes seem to be appearing on the Internet, maybe you should do your research or maybe actually have a common understanding of what the word ""meme"" actually means.

pussypassdenied,3dn6ow,trap_clap,12,Sat Jul 18 00:29:55 2015 UTC,BTW signing a ticket does not mean that you are consenting to pay for the ticket. It just means that you agree that you received a ticket and the process and your options were explained to you.
pussypassdenied,3dn6ow,_no_fap,3,Sat Jul 18 00:45:05 2015 UTC,Signing the ticket you're being issued.  Not sure why

pussypassdenied,3dn6ow,DesertFox1986,5,Sat Jul 18 02:11:23 2015 UTC,"It's a promise to take care of the citation by either paying the fine or appearing in court, at a later date for the charges.  If you refuse to sign depending on the state the officer can seize your operators license in lieu of a bond as a promise to appear.  At that point you would have to show up to court or the courthouse to provide a monetary bond as a promise to appear to have your license returned to you."
pussypassdenied,3dn6ow,1Riot1Ranger,4,Sat Jul 18 02:04:29 2015 UTC,"They have the choice of writing that you refused to sign, or arresting you."

pussypassdenied,3dix2o,horrorinpureform,18,Thu Jul 16 20:29:59 2015 UTC,"She was ""giving away"" some things from her house and told the guy next to her (son? friend? I don't remember) to tell the defendant that he can take it. The guy miscommunicated with the defendant and told him he can take anything he wants from the house since they were moving (the plaintiff was away at the time so she couldn't correct the mistake). The defendant took the futon and the microwave and some TV. It turns out that he simply never knew he wasn't supposed to take those extra things (apparently the dude next to the plaintiff was only supposed to give the defendant permission to take things from the basement only, except he failed to do it). The defendant didn't really do much wrong, if anything.   Basically, the whole thing was the fault of the dude next to the plaintiff since he was not successful as acting as a proper agent for the plaintiff to accurately express her permission."
pussypassdenied,3dix2o,Shia_LaBoof,1 point,Fri Jul 17 05:18:43 2015 UTC,Ahh okay thank you.  Was their something about him accidentally breaking fine china while moving the futon out of the house?
pussypassdenied,3dix2o,horrorinpureform,4,Fri Jul 17 12:39:35 2015 UTC,"She claimed so, but no one else really knew what she was talking about, I think she was just pissed about him taking all that extra stuff so she made that part up. Even if it broke, it's her fault for leaving this precious ""grandma's china"" on the floor."
pussypassdenied,3dix2o,Polaris2246,21,Fri Jul 17 12:40:42 2015 UTC,"Sounds like he bought a futon from her and maybe took the couch instead thinking it was the futon and in the process broke some china.  If that is the case, he should have to pay to replace it at retail value, not sentimental value."

By the way nice use of strawman logic, you'd fit in way better with SJW's than me, I'm not an SJW at all."

That's not true, you're being downvoted because you're calling us all misogynists with only the voting system as proof. you're being downvoted by the people who come here to see pussy passes get denied, then see you're bullshit arguments about subscribers wanting to see women get beaten up without just cause.

They're just cunts being dicks (pardon the pun) but they are not asking for special treatment.

The threat she (handcuffed behind her back) posed to his safety didn't warrant his response. He could have easily done serious permanent damage to that woman.   Police need to understand they're not always dealing with rational individuals. Individuals in police custody are not always taking proper account of their situation. Violence like this should only be used when it's absolutely necessary to mitigate an actual threat, not simply to prove the point that you're in charge. She's already guilty of assaulting a police officer, and is likely be in serious trouble without the body slam. Being charged with felony assault isn't enough punishment for a kick while seated from that tiny woman?   All these ""do the crime, do the time"" arguments from officers would fall flat on their face if one of their family members was in this situation. If your mother went of her meds, went bat shit crazy, and intentionally or unintentionally struck a police officer, wouldn't you want them to show a little restraint in subduing her?"

She was already handcuffed (plus he is twice her size), so she wasn't much of a threat to begin with. The first thing that happens in the video, is that he puts his hand on the lower part of her stomach and pushes her into the chair. Ok, he could have put his hands on her shoulders and pushed her down, but fine. Not that big of a deal. At this point, she was where he wanted her... in the chair. He should of removed his hand then. Instead, he lets the hand linger for a bit  (about as close to her crotch as you could get from a sitting position) and only removed his hand to cover his genitals when she kicked at him. I'm not white-knighting here, but it's possible that she may have felt uncomfortable (I would probably would have) and that is why she kicked him. I might even agree that that was the wrong thing for her to do at that moment. You make a good point in that we don't know what happened before the video. We (at least I) don't even know what they were saying to each other during the video. His reaction, especially as a ""public servant"" should not be to violently throw her to the ground, face first!

How can know know he beats his wife/children with a 15 sec vid?   I don't know. I said probably. There is a difference. One could infer that he beats his wife/kids based on his very quick decision to get overly aggressive and violent with someone who is basically a female child (she was 18). He didn't think twice (probably not even once) about violently assaulting her. Someone who was not a threat, regardless of what ""some persons"" are capable of and who could not defend herself at the time (or could she even if she wasn't in cuffs). The guy is a fucking bully. I seriously doubt that this is the one and only time he has ever done something like this. This was not self-defense, this was assault. This looked very easy for him to do. He also (if you watch beyond 15 seconds) shows zero concern for her after he face-fucks her with the floor. Besides, no one ever said being a cop was easy and safe. This is the kind of shit you sign up for when you want to be a cop. Danger goes with power. Nothing comes for free."

pussypassdenied,3dasmz,NewW0rld,3,Thu Jul 16 21:06:27 2015 UTC,He is off the team and will lose his scholarship. No other school is going to pick him up. His athletic and educational career is over. Also I hear a lot of people saying how he has yet to be convicted. Who the fuck are you people kidding? He is a black man who punched a white woman in a mostly white city. No way if this goes to trial is he going to get off. This is in the South the home of both white racism and a culture that thinks its not ok to hit a woman for any reason.
pussypassdenied,3dasmz,Statecensor,3,Mon Jul 20 16:19:03 2015 UTC,Well he was suspended and kicked off the FSU football team he was a quarterback on.

An article said he was suspended because ""violation of athletic department policy"". But I think he would've been suspended for any other act that caused as much negative media attention, because what I think they're trying to avoid is bad publicity to the team and the university, brought on by the impending trial so I disagree that it's a pussy pass.

The only one in the wrong here is the one who got kicked out of school and charged."

She beat him to the spot to order a drink, he tried to barge in and access the service well, he should have just waited his turn.    Also raising a fist isn't hitting someone.  She raised her fist, he grabbed her arm and pushed it into her face, she swings and he clocks her.  You can argue she shouldn't have raised her arm, which did escalate the situation, but you can't go around knocking out anyone who bumps into you in a bar.  Also this douche is now trying to justify this by saying she called him a racial slur.  That probably also deserves its own sub-reddit, because apparently if you're black getting called the n word is now justification for violent assaults."

In a crowded bar it's usual to rub shoulder to shoulder just to get a drink.  But the woman became combative, then the guy put his hand on her arm.  This was probably done to try to calm her down.  As many know this usually don't help and does the opposite.  She gets more combative and throws a punch, then gets what she deserves for doing so.    In the end nobody was right in that case since a simple ""excuse me"" would've solved the issue.  If both shared the space it would've been no harm no foul."

pussypassdenied,3dasmz,Crobb,12,Tue Jul 14 22:01:49 2015 UTC,"To my knowledge, the woman never made the claim that he groped her from behind (did she?). And you can clearly see his right hand/arm reach past her and grab the underside of the bar. The probability seems low that he would be pulling some kind of reach-around with his left to grope her... Anywho, it looks like this is a crowded bar, he's trying to get to the bar and has his back to the woman in question. He seems to get encroached upon by the other group in front of him, which causes him to crowd the woman behind him (clearly not in an aggressive manner, but rather in an 'I'm trying to get a drink and getting pushed around' kinda manner). The woman in question seems to get aggravated by him, idk what you'd call it, brushing up against him (because you can clearly see he didn't bump into her with any tremendous force or anything). And she raised her fist like she was going to hit him...   And at this point, I believe, if the man felt he was in danger, he had every right to defend himself. Is that gentlemanly? No... But at least he attempted to warn her by grabbing the fist before it was thrown.  Ironically, and I'm just speculating, I think if he had done the ""gentleman"" thing at that point (when she raised the fist) and turned to walk away, he likely would have taken a swipe to the back of the head, got spit on, or had a drink thrown on him. The woman in question just seemed to be aggravated and looking for trouble. IMHO."

I might feel bad for her if prison really was the hell its made out to be. It just isnt. Someone who is sent to a prison is sent to a world separate from our own. A world full of people who make irrational decisions that harm others. Whether it be directly or indirectly. Its not the end of their life. They socialize with eachother and find their own ways of keeping busy. Who cares if she can never update her twitter or hang with her besties at the mall? If she didnt want to go to prison, she shouldve considered the circumstances. She broke our worlds rules, so we sent her to a world with others who have a similar disregard for other human beings. Its hardly inhumane.  I will say, however, that I find our system of determining guilt to be unjust. Too many people going to jail over something they didnt do. With that, Im also going to say this: I have no opinion of whether or not this girl is guilty. I wasnt there. I dont know her. Im not in the courtroom. I hope she gets what she DESERVES.

The only excuse you can use to defend yourself is if you yourself are mentally unstable.  The girl is a murderer.

Being charged with murder and committing murder aren't even the same thing, especially in this case. The definition of murder is the premeditated act of killing someone. If she killed the cop then tell me what weapon she used. Was it with her bare hands? Was it with pepper spray? The only reason she even received a murder charge is because of a loophole in an antiquated and unconstitutional law that allows a prosecutor to charge an accomplice with all crimes committed by all parties. The girl commited plenty of crimes on her own and should be punished accordingly, but there are no facts based on reality that would lead a reasonable person to believe that she murdered that cop."

As such, she took part in that crime, and so she has the same degree of guilt.  Can you explain exactly how this law is ""unconstitutional"" by the way? I fail to see what you're getting at there."
pussypassdenied,3d5j7l,Takuya-san,-3,Tue Jul 14 08:43:50 2015 UTC,"I am very familiar with the accomplice law, it was my original comment that you replied to. This is the first time you have called her an accomplice and not a murderer. And you did not make it clear that you weren't being literal. To quote you from your first reply, ""That makes her a murderer.""  I said the accomplice law 'should' be unconstitutional, not is. Just like the NSA bulk data collection 'should' be unconstitutional, but isn't. The reason I believe the accomplice law should be declared unconstitutional is because you can potentially be charged with a crime you didn't commit. The 8th amendment also guarantees you no cruel and unusual punishment. Keep in mind this is Utah state law and not federal law. The law is also vague and says an accomplice can be considered equally responsible for 'any' crime that happens, not just murder.   Here's a hypothetical: What if you had an 18 year old son who went drinking with his friends. All but the DD are under 21 so they are drinking illegally. They have a 21 year old designated driver but he had too much to drink. Also his license in suspended because he has already had a DUI. The DD then crashes into another car and kills someone. Everyone in the DD's car is fine. Would you be ok with your son and everyone else in the car being charged with Negligent Homicide? They all were breaking the law together, and the accomplice law allows all of them to be charged."

pussypassdenied,3d5j7l,the_jackson_9,0,Wed Jul 15 15:38:40 2015 UTC,"Yep, unless the DD hid the suspension of license, and if there's no reason to believe the DD hid his drunkenness from the kids, then they're just as guilty.   The accomplice law isn't complex. If you willingly help someone commit a crime with knowledge of what will happen, then you took part in the crime. I fail to see how either of your constitutional points would apply here."

Let me give you the TL;DR   Most people think peoples' lives shouldn't be ruined for consensual sex with 16+ year olds.  People still want the law enforced equally between the sexes while the law exists.    There. She got the punishment a man would have gotten; the punishment is still unjust.
pussypassdenied,3d2sjh,Dontblameme1,48,Mon Jul 13 02:51:14 2015 UTC,Fucking hell. I could not have said it so perfectly.
pussypassdenied,3d2sjh,Creature_73L,5,Mon Jul 13 03:36:51 2015 UTC,"I am on board with you 100%.  I think the problem people have is not the hard facts of what happened, but the feels that followed.  If a man was in her shoes, everyone would undoubtedly convict him and call him a creep immediately with very little investigation and even if said investigation came up in his favor, the accusation alone is enough to ruin his life.  When a female is in this scenario, we all of the sudden need a discussion and everyone starts doubting the situation, talking about age of consent and being like ""where the fuck were these teachers when I was in school???"".     I think that the way women are treated in these situations is the correct thing, and we do not need to be rallying for them to be treated like the men in these situations, but we need to be rallying so that the men are treated the same as the women.  In my opinion, a 17 year old girl slut that hits on the teacher for extra credit is not going to be corrupted by the act just as a 17 year old boy happy to bang his teacher is not going to be traumatized.  I think in the situations above 16 (or whatever the age of consent is) should definitely get the teachers fired, but no criminal charges should be placed until the ""victim"" actually files real rape charges."

pussypassdenied,3d2sjh,TA_2985_A6E1_9FC3,-13,Mon Jul 13 15:02:39 2015 UTC,"That's the point of ""consent"". You're not abusing a position of power when the consent overrides the authority. Consent is very applicable with older teenagers, especially towards teachers.  Edit: I should of specified by consent I mean a young adult who is not being manipulated. Like a teenager who comes onto a teacher and hounds them for sex. It doesn't mean that the authority figure was justified sleeping with them, it just completely invalidated any ""abuse"" of power by the fact that there was clear conset."
pussypassdenied,3d2sjh,silad,9,Mon Jul 13 16:11:30 2015 UTC,What are you even talking about?
pussypassdenied,3d2sjh,Teller8,6,Mon Jul 13 16:53:44 2015 UTC,"Then I assume you're okay with cops having ""consensual"" sex with minors while on the job?  When you are in a position of authority over people, especially children, even if it's consensual it's an abuse of power."
pussypassdenied,3d2sjh,mginatl,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:26:12 2015 UTC,This is absolutely the best point made here. Good call. I was mostly on the other side until I read this.
pussypassdenied,3d2sjh,liberated-cheese,-2,Mon Jul 13 21:25:18 2015 UTC,"Well cops have a much different authority over people than teachers of course, a cop can intimidate you in MANY more ways than I need to explain, nevermind their legal immunity. I mentioned the authority between a teacher and an older teenager is different; I believe in the manner of consequence. In the scenario that an older teenager consents to sex with a teacher, I don't find it morally apprehensive. If a teacher were to manipulate a child into sex it would of course be an abuse of power, but that doesn't mean all sex between teachers and minors is a power game. (This is a fact. Sorry, but a 22 year old teacher and a 17 year old student does not always mean a sick power game.) Now, the laws made to protect children are very legitimate of course, so we're speaking older teenagers. If a teacher blackmails a child with sex, that is a very very easy situation for a 16 year old child to react to. ""What are you gonna do, give me detention?"" and they proceed to alert the authorities. Now it would be much different with a police officer, obviously.  So I cannot see how laws regarding consensual sex between a teacher and a minor have any correlation. If it is consensual it is an abuse of power IF you are taking advantage of the legitimacy of their consent.  If a young child tries to come onto you, obviously you do the responsible thing and stop them. You tell someone to get them help, whether or not you have ""urges"" for children or would otherwise be willing. There is no excuse for that. An older teenager is significantly more capable of sexual awareness and consent, especially being sexually active prior. I can confidently say that a 16 year old is more capable of understanding consent and sexual consequences."
pussypassdenied,3d2sjh,silad,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:26:28 2015 UTC,"It's not even about age or gender here. It's about how both a cop and a teacher are in a position of power (a cop more so, obviously) and therefor should not have sex, even consensual, with people they have worked with, especially minors.  Now, I'm not saying that the women in question abused her power, but it's a possibility. Who knows if she used her power or not? She could have threatened to give them a bad grade on purpose for all we know, or blackmail them in other ways.  (Also, the difference between a 16 year old and a 10 year old is very different, it's entirely possibly that the sex was consensual, that doesn't change the fact that she had a position of power, and may have been abusing it.)"
pussypassdenied,3d2sjh,mginatl,-1,Mon Jul 13 22:41:01 2015 UTC,"I understand completely where you're coming from and I share that concern for the abuse of power so I completely understand why the law is defended so heavily. I honestly think that the age does matter, gender doesn't of course, but age does. An 18 year old is no more ""aware"" than a 17 year old by definition so I don't mean to beat a dead horse but age does matter. I just need to stand by the defense of the fact that some students make dumbass decisions with teachers, and often the teachers are young and dumb too, without any abuse of power occuring. I've of course known teachers my own age, who are around 20-22 and a substitute at a HS. It would be wrong for them to sleep with the students, but that doesn't nullify the fact that it wouldn't be an abuse of power that harmed a child. It would be wrong for them to be prosecuted in my opinion because that doesn't benefit anyone, or the system. It is unnecessary harm and damage. It is very hard to find a clear line between whats preventable in this case, so I think each should be dissecting heavily and there should be some consideration for defense on the teachers part. Of course lock away all the scum that prey on students or abuse their authority, I didn't mean to give away the idea I was defending that or anything of course."
pussypassdenied,3d2sjh,silad,3,Mon Jul 13 22:56:43 2015 UTC,"Age does play a part, that is for certain in these types of cases. But this isn't some young 22 year old who just started teaching. She was older, by a significant number.   18 being the age of consent is just a number they picked because it's hard to draw the line. An 18 year old isn't much more mature than a 17 year old, who in turn isn't much more mature than a 16 year old.  Whether or not abuse of power comes into play or not, I still find it wrong for a teacher to have sex with her students, as even if she doesn't necessarily abuse the power itself, she would be using the natural trust between student and teacher.  If the teacher is the one who initiates it, they are in the wrong, but in the case that the student initiates, and they are both old enough to legally consent, it's different."

As a defendant, you can not go to trial facing a rape charge if there's evidence of any contact, even consensual contact.

Instead of trying to be wrong with both, how about we try to be right with both?  Every case is different, how the victims are treated is different. The courts can only go by the evidence provided by the prosecutors. One of the main reasons these men seem to be treated worse is because female victims are coerced into making statements against their male offenders, i.e. you were preyed upon, he groomed you, he took your innocence etc.  Male victims are allowed to say what actually happened. Presented in court, those statements make the male offenders out to be rapists, and the female offenders simply made a bad decision.

'Our bus drivers therefore need the support of the public to keep bus stops clear for customers particularly those with mobility difficulties.  'We ask our drivers to remain professional at all times and we will be speaking with our driver to review how this was handled. However, this incident does highlight the difficulties inconsiderate parking causes for all road users alike.'   Essentially, they're telling the two idiots they're idiots for parking there.   ""We will be speaking with our driver to review how this was handled.""   There's always room for improvement, sure.  I hope the driver doesn't get anything permanent on his record.

pussypassdenied,3clzmo,fireglare,6,Wed Jul 8 23:12:22 2015 UTC,"I believe I could have avoided the whole thing if I talked to one of the guys outside.   Genuine curiosity: what would have been the difference in your experience? Wouldn't it still be a case of he said, she said?"
pussypassdenied,3clzmo,FWMadCat,12,Thu Jul 9 10:48:36 2015 UTC,"I could have talked to him without the other ones listening. This way, I could've said:  ""Hey bro, the ladies at your table apparently doesn't like you sitting there. Now I don't personally like these kind of judgemental women, so I would have left the table and found me another place to sit. If you absolutley MUST sit at that table, I can't deny you.""   So he MIGHT decide to move or stay. But the whole idea is that the ladies are not listening to our conversation and their responses, so they could not intervene.   She started pushing him after he refused to move from the table and denied her accusations. She would never had the chance to do so if we talk outside.   Now the guy may aswell go and cause trouble with the lady after we've talked, but I'll tell him:  ""Okay, you don't want to move? That's okey. Go back and sit down and enjoy your evening. I'll talk to the ladies.""  Then, I can talk to the ladies outside without the men intervening. I'll say:  ""I can't tell people to move from tables because someone at the table wants them too. It's wrong and it is against my policy as a doorman. If you don't like them, I can show you to another table. I'll bring chips to you aswell if you want some.""   THIS could fix everything. Now both parts understand that I'm not taking sides and is giving them my best advice to solve the conflict. If they still want to go back to that table, they'd just have to deal with it.  Worst case, same thing happens. 4 people leaves the bar. But if I do what is said above, it's far more likley that 2 people leaves the bar instead of 4.   This was a weird scenario. It actually led to a fight later that evening with totally different people. While I was discussing with the black haired lady outside, a random dude came and pushed me. I called another doorman and he threw him out while I talked to the lady. I just held him off, hahah. He was high as fuck tho.   He later came back and tried to punch and kick the doorman in the door while I was inside patroling. The night ended at the police station for him."

pussypassdenied,3clzmo,empenny10,2,Thu Jul 9 18:14:58 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the explanation.  If I were the dude at the table being accused I know I wouldn't appreciate being called outside to talk to you about something that I didn't do, that would only piss me off to be accused and detract from my good times in your establishment for having to waste time to field a conversation started by some unfounded accusation.  In the sense that she got her complaint heard, and the dude talked to, and with no real findings I think you handled it fine and that this type of female seems of the type that would've been a problem either way.    If you had talked to him outside and he chooses to not cater to her 'needs' of choosing another table a whole other but similar situation would've arose between the two.  And if he chooses to move why is it that he has to accommodate for some stranger's feelings.  Either way a lose for the dude."

I also could have just told the blond woman in the beginning:  ""Sorry, not my problem! If you don't like them, move.""

pussypassdenied,3cjqpt,flaxeater,1 point,Wed Jul 15 02:15:44 2015 UTC,"Here's a very unpopular opinion from a LEO guy. When it comes time to crunch the numbers, many inquiries into the incidence of false reports of rape are huge. Ask any police officer how many rape cases he gets that are bullshit. Ask a lawyer. They'll tell you ""30, 40 all the way up to 90%"". Generally the most consistent answer I hear is 50%. It's far from scientific, because whenever those kinds of numbers are put out into public, the Feminists shit a kitten because it's against their narrative. They also typically attempt to redact information of female rapists, but thats a different ball of wax.  Knew a Provost Marshal in the military who reported that 50% of the rape allegations he had looked into were false. He was immediately stripped of his position, but when investigators looked at his casework it turned out, yes, 50% of the cases he had (more or less) were provably, verifiably false.  I knew a FEMALE CID agent who admitted the problem was rampant in the military.  (It's also worthwhile to note that the Army's alleged problems with sexual assault and rape trace their roots back to the military's policy on fraternizations. You'll see couples wandering around the FOB, but as soon as some wandering Sergeant Major catches the two of them fucking in a bunker for indirect fire, suddenly she was raped. Funny how that happens).  So yeah. Even when rigorous studies are attempted, feminists do their best to threaten and intimidate the scholars to continue pushing their nonsense."

pussypassdenied,3cf08d,Energy-Dragon,72,Tue Jul 7 18:21:10 2015 UTC,"I think this whole ""legal age of sexual consent"" topic is being overcomplicated. For example in many European countries the age of consent is around 14 - 16. Of course this does not mean that young teens are continually seduced by older people, but many of them are sexually active above this age (mainly with their peers of same age course):  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ages_of_consent_in_Europe  By the way I am a male, and I prefer girls in my own age bracket (around 25-35), so it does not really affect me. But I think so that many cases are pretty much overblown. Teens become sexually active at a point, like it or not.    *edit: Formatting. And I would like to add, that once people are sexually active (over some rational legal age of course), then they should be able to choose the partner freely. Below are some interesting examples of couples with a big age difference. Sure, they are all above 18, and these are ""gossip"" sites, but still: in many of these examples the age difference is 10 / 20 / 30 years, and they are still working (due to various reasons of course, like love, money, friendship, sex, power, fame, whatever).  http://www.hollywood.com/celebrities/hollywood-marriages-with-the-biggest-age-gaps-60200756/#/ms-20675/2  http://www.ranker.com/list/famous-couples-with-greatest-age-difference/celebrity-lists  http://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2014/04/13-celebrity-couples-with-massive-age-gaps/  http://www.angelfire.com/stars4/lists/couples-age-differences2.html"

I don't think sex with a consenting 15 year old is rape unless you can prove they were emotionally manipulated. Even that can be dicey because you know the parents/prosecutors will bully/manipulate the young person into testifying as such.   Edit: The major criminals don't even see prison most the time. Oh, you did some sort of financial crime to earn X amount of dollars and screw people out of their retirement savings? Well....I guess we can fine you 1% of what you earned. That's fair, right?

pussypassdenied,3cf08d,wtfuggShane,14,Tue Jul 7 15:18:12 2015 UTC,"And yet ""teens"" is apparently by far the most common search term in porn. Clearly, whether we want to admit it or not, modern society has a sexual fixation on the idea of sex with young people.   It's not like boys and girls magically become attractive men and women at the age of eighteen; some will mature physically faster, some slower. The fact is, our bodies are designed to sexually mature throughout our teenage years into a form that is attractive to others. It's not somehow wrong for an adult to find a 14 year old physically attractive; it is only wrong in modern society if that adult acts on that attraction, exploiting the young person.  And, speaking from experience, I have never known and doubt that there has existed in the history of mankind a straight, adult male that has not, at some point, found himself attracted to a teenage girl under the age of 18. More than once, I've found myself admiring a girl's very mature figure from behind, only for her very immature face to reveal just how young she is, causing me to mentally ""nope"" all the thoughts I had just been having right out of my head.   It's only natural to be attracted to sexually mature members of the opposite sex and, biologically speaking, most humans are sexually mature by the age of 13. Now, obviously, Western culture has developed with values differing from our biology, one in which mental maturity and your contribution to society is more valuable than your sexuality. And I think we can all agree that is a good thing. But it doesn't mean attraction to teenagers makes you a ""sick fuck,"" despite media often portraying it in such a way. Now, if you want to talk about a lack of impulse control and risk assessment among adults who have sex with teens, I'll agree with you all day. That's where you start getting into ""sick fuck"" territory."

pussypassdenied,3ch0d5,hodaughter,6,Wed Jul 8 06:47:29 2015 UTC,So in her mind she was thinking I can take this mofo or he can't retaliate because I'm a woman?  I'm guessing it was the latter and she got denied.
pussypassdenied,3ch0d5,Zeropoint88,-10,Wed Jul 8 19:36:48 2015 UTC,Zero evidence of her mindset or her using her gender to her advantage.  Just two bitches fighting cuz one pushed up to the bar rudely and the other overreacted.  At no point did she whip out the PP.
pussypassdenied,3ch0d5,hodaughter,4,Wed Jul 8 21:36:31 2015 UTC,What do you mean zero evidence. Her behavior is at least indicative of the fact that she thought she could get away with assaulting this man with little to no consequences. She acted just like every typical female I've ever seen who thought she could assault a man with no retaliation because she's a woman.  The only alternative is that she's retarded or she legitimately thought she could whoop his ass. I'd believe the former but not the latter.
pussypassdenied,3ch0d5,Zeropoint88,-2,Thu Jul 9 02:54:40 2015 UTC,"Nothing on the video that would seem out of place on a guy.  I can picture the same level of overreaction by some dude.  There's no audio, so we don't know what she said, so we don't know that she said anything about her gender protecting her.  We can't read her mind, so we don't know that she was thinking her gender would protect her.  This is all wishful thinking by those who just like to see women get hit versus those of us who only like to see a true PP denial.  There is nothing but speculation and speculation is NOT evidence.  There is zero evidence."

pussypassdenied,3ch0d5,SellingSomeShit,-2,Thu Jul 9 06:12:41 2015 UTC,"I've worked behind the bar for years and experience tells me nothing about this says PPD.  Her size has no bearing.  I've seen little guys who were ready to fight at the drop of a hat.  Tequila makes you 10-feet tall and bulletproof.  Just because she's smaller doesn't mean we can assume she's thinking her gender will protect her.  At her level of inebriation, she's doubtful thinking at all.  The fact that she doesn't fight like Ronda Rousey also doesn't imply anything.  Lots of hotheaded drunken boys fight like bitches as well.  Especially if they're fighting with their off hand.  Even Larry Holmes doesn't jab like Larry Holmes when he's drunk.  All we have here is one drunken hot head balling up a fist as a threat but doesn't actually punch, the other drunk grabs the wrist, hot head, mad now that there's actual physical contact, punches a glancing blow with the off hand, which often means a weak, inaccurate shot because people don't sit at home throwing out weak hand jabs at the mirror, other drunk, with the benefit of years of physical training and having his strong hand free, delivers a decent shot to hot head.  This scenario has nothing to do with gender, unless you count the QB who hit as hard as he could yet failed to do more than stun hot head.  If there's a PP to be found in this video, it's his."
pussypassdenied,3ch0d5,hodaughter,5,Thu Jul 9 16:48:54 2015 UTC,"Your bias is obvious.  You defend her behavior by assuming she's too drunk to be accountable but you don't give the guy the same assumption  You refer to grown men as 'boys'  Then you go into a long-winded, horribly punctuated tirade where you try to subtly insult the guy ""He had years of training and punched her as hard as he could and he only stunned her LOL!"" for not doing more damage to the girl that's apparently too drunk to be ""thinking at all"" but not too drunk to feel the full impact of what was absolutely fucking not the hardest punch he could throw  So to summarize, you say the girl's gender has nothing to do with what happened here but on an unrelated note the guy is a bitch for hitting her."
pussypassdenied,3ch0d5,SellingSomeShit,0,Thu Jul 9 17:10:46 2015 UTC,"The guy is a bitch for his overreaction to her as she was for her overreaction to him.  They're both bitches.  The problem is this sub is for those who use the female gender as an excuse to get away with being a bitch and there's no evidence of that here.    It'd be the same if someone said he was playing the race card in some way.  Somewhere, some redeneck would view this video and assume he's acting that way because he feels his race entitles him to.  There's no evidence of that, but the inference could be made with the same amount of assumption that's being made here about her motives.  Neither pussy pass nor race card was presented here to anyone's actual knowledge.... including yours.  To assume otherwise shows your obvious bias."

pussypassdenied,3ch0d5,Zeropoint88,4,Wed Jul 8 05:41:47 2015 UTC,"The woman was standing at the bar long before he walked up. You can just see the top of her head in the video. She sees him heading for the bar and tries to prevent him getting in front of her. It appears she was waiting in line for the guys in front of her to order and seeing this guy push his way to the bar pissed her off. However she did instigate the whole confrontation by first trying to physically maneuver herself so that he couldn't reach the bar. Then she puts her left hand on his chest and raises the other hand in a threatening manner. All the guy did was grab her to prevent her from hitting him. A reasonable human being would say, ""hey I'm not trying to hit you I was just pointing at the guy over my shoulder whom I was next in line after. Please take your hands off of me"". Instead we get invincible female attitude because you know she's thinking that he can't hit a female in public and escalates the situation by hitting the man in his face. Not to mention she's suffering from pack mentality when her girlfriend joins the struggle. The only appropriate response is self defense. Otherwise you perpetuate this problem of people, not just women, thinking they can do whatever they want with no consequences.   It's really quite sad that this young man has lost his entire future for simply defending himself.   It's real simple. Don't put hands on someone else or make them fear for their safety and you won't have hands put on you.  Every time I see a situation like this I imagine the man is a female police officer and then I ask myself if the response was appropriate. You should show the same respect to other human beings as you would a police officer in regards to putting hands on someone. Unless you want to get beat down."

Here's the ruling of the appeal: http://law.justia.com/cases/california/court-of-appeal/4th/50/842.html  I see what the court is thinking. I think it sheds more light on injustice between genders and poor handling of statutory rape than it does on anything else.   This line: ""...overrides the State's competing interest in protecting juveniles from improvident acts..."" They refer to the 15 year old as having consensual sex, and then call it ""improvident"" which to me makes it sound less like they consider statutory rape a significant crime against a victim and more like they consider it a crime against oneself like with marijuana usage. Maybe I'm reading it wrong."

However, I would have lost my teaching credentials and never been allowed to teach again, because even though it isn't illegal, it IS a violation of state-mandated ""professional standards.""  It doesn't matter if the girl I slept with lived on the other side of the state from me; if she is a student in any school system within the state, that would be the end of my teaching career.    To the best of my knowledge, this is the case in most places.  You wouldn't go to jail for sleeping with a ""legal"" student, but you would get your career unceremoniously flushed."

I had two of them tell me about it and were like ""what the fuck is wrong with the captain?"" Nobody liked him.

There is no such thing as a charge for having sex with a student, since student and teacher are ambiguous terms that having nothing to do with age.   Even if a kid was 18 in high school it is still a felony in most states.   Source?  5 quick minutes on google suggest that it's completely legal for an 18 year old to have sex with their teacher.  The teacher may lose their job for acting inappropriately, but what crime has been committed?  From where in the Constitution does the law emanate that says two consenting adults can't have sex because of their job?  Edit: 5 more minutes on Google finds the opposite, from the wiki  [Alabama] 13A-6-81 : A person commits the crime of a school employee engaging in a sex act or deviant sexual intercourse with a student under the age of 19 years if: (a) He or she is a school employee and engages in a sex act or deviant sexual intercourse with a student, regardless of whether the student is male or female. Consent is not a defense to a charge under this section.  So, my blanket assertion that nowhere is there a law that specifies a teacher/student relationship is wrong.  It's a dumb law, but it exists.  In fact about half of all states specifically have laws about teacher/student relationships, while the other half don't.  I think someone could launch a pretty successful attack on laws worded like this, if there were ever a deep-pocketed teacher convicted of such a crime.  That also led to this awesome passage:  (b) As used in this section, sex act means sexual intercourse with any penetration, however slight; emission is not required.  (c) As used in this section, deviant sexual intercourse means any act of sexual gratification between persons not married to each other involving the sex organs of one person and the mouth or anus of another."

pussypassdenied,3c41gg,Slaphappydap,8,Sat Jul 4 18:32:28 2015 UTC,"Psychologically, it's implied. It's called ""grooming"" and that is a crime in many areas.   Think of the child that feels they have to do what the predator wants in order to ""please"" her/him lest they receive an ""unspoken punishment"". It's about power, and if someone has implicit power over you (work, school, home), it's a crime to use that for sexual gratification."
pussypassdenied,3c41gg,sacriliciously,6,Sat Jul 4 20:47:05 2015 UTC,"It's called ""grooming"" and that is a crime in many areas.   That's true in some areas, though in many areas it's not.  For example, a Texas appellate court ruled that a teacher could legally have sex with an 18-year-old student, because that student is not a minor.  At 18 years old we agree that a person is old enough to have a representative vote during an election, can serve in the armed forces, can enter into contracts, can get married and raise children, be tried for crimes as an adult, etc.  We agree that an 18-year-old can make informed decisions about their lives despite the many subtle pressures they face.  The commenter I replied to said it's not an issue of age, but of the inappropriate nature of their relationship.  Yet if the students were in college and slept with a professor or TA, that educator may lose their job but it wouldn't necessarily be criminal.  You can sleep with your boss, you can sleep with your psychologist.  You can be an 18 year old girl and sleep with your 55 year old business manager or agent, a person in position to wield extraordinary influence over their lives and careers.  So, it's entirely about age.  Kids are 18, she loses her job, kids are 17, she goes to jail for 22 years (less parole).  I don't think anyone is arguing that the teacher in this case is a hero, but 22 years is absurd.  She needs counselling and rehabilitation, she needs to get better and make better choices, she should have her conviction stapled to every job application she makes, but she doesn't need to spend the next two decades in prison.     Think of the child that feels they have to do what the predator wants in order to ""please"" her/him   Without knowing the victims in this case, I'd argue that it's just as likely that they are the emotional and mental equivalent of an 18 year old (an arbitrary age after which we have agreed they can make their own reasoned and informed decisions) than they are a 'child' being attacked by a predator.    There should be room for context in matters like this.  If the victims can honestly and compellingly tell the court that they felt pressured and blackmailed to perform sexual acts on this older woman, that they didn't reasonably feel like they could refuse her advances and decline her invitations to go back to her apartment, then that should be addressed by the court system.  But if their attitude was, like mine was with my boss, that 'I like when women touch my cock, tits are yummy, sex felt great so I did it as many times as she would let me', that's the same attitude I had when I was both 17 and 18.   It's about power, and if someone has implicit power over you (work, school, home), it's a crime to use that for sexual gratification.   One could also argue that the students were old enough to understand that her leverage of withholding grades for sex (maybe loosely implied but never stipulated or proven) is much weaker than their leverage of 'give me good grades or I'll have you sent to jail for 22 years'.  By that reasoning it may have been criminal for them to have sex with her, knowing that she could potentially face criminal charges, and continue to have sex with her knowing it compounded her exposure.  If anything, it could be argued they wielded far more power in that relationship than she did.  In any case, I can't help but feel she is going to be imprisoned for a huge part of her life on what amounts to a technicality.  She was wrong, she needs help, I don't think this is a proportionate or effective remedy."

Often it's that the younger may not be younger than 14 and the age difference may not surpass 3 years.  Florida has an age of consent of 18 and a Romeo and Juliet law that allows sexual consent between people under 24 and people 16 or 17 years of age. This is a really shitty law, because a couple could be 16 and 23 and fuck furiously but the following year when they are 17 and 24 it's a second degree felony.

If this isn't exactly what I said it was I just don't know what you want.  Over the age of consent everything is allowed, I never said anything else. Romeo and Juliet laws are for cases where at least one of the sexual partners is below the age of consent.  Edit: Also, to be explicit about the case at hand: They guys were 17 so the were below the age of consent which is 18 in Florida. The teacher was 24 or older so the Romeo and Juliet section doesn't apply anyway. Even if she was 23 it would still have been statuatory rape because her position will make Florida 794.011 section (8) applicable, because teachers have been found to be in a position of custodial authority in Florida  (8) Without regard to the willingness or consent of the victim, which is not a defense to prosecution under this subsection, a person who is in a position of familial or custodial authority to a person less than 18 years of age and who: (a) Solicits that person to engage in any act which would constitute sexual battery under paragraph (1)(h) commits a felony of the third degree, punishable as provided in s. 775.082, s. 775.083, or s. 775.084.

This is a really shitty law, because a couple could be 16 and 23 and fuck furiously but the following year when they are 17 and 24 it's a second degree felony.  Quite a stupid oversight.

pussypassdenied,3c41gg,rollcyclones,1 point,Sun Jul 5 02:41:43 2015 UTC,"As far as I know he's never had a girlfriend. Now I'm really not trying to be a complete asshole, this is me putting this bluntly, but he's truly just the weirdest person I've ever met. He is extremely awkward, even with the people he's friends with, like my brother. Like he thinks descriptively telling how he'd brutally kill his mom with a shotgun is hilarious, while everyone else is literally in stunned silence. Or if there's a conversation going, and I turn to look his direction when he goes to speak, he'll instantly stop talking. Maybe cause I'm the oldest(?), I have no idea, but his social skills are just... Extremely poor.    With his looks, I seriously wouldn't say it can just boil down to targeting. Alright, he's awkward and all, easy catch I guess. But also, there were 2 other guys as well... Throw on top his very thin hair, he's very skinny and small, frail even, and during this time he has a habit of sucking in his bottom lip to show off his far protruding snaggletooth, and anytime he does so he whips his head backwards while his eyes roll back and makes gulping noises like he's trying to swallow his freaking lip. (Not a tick, it's just what he did. You can't be in the same room for 5mins without noticing, it was violent and a big part of his behaviour. He quit once the braces made a noticeable difference. Purely him... being him..) I mean, it's not like she's doing anybody any favours. Out of the entire class (Granted this school actually is known to house more ""social misfits"" by all other students in the city.) he's picked, and out of 3 guys he is the one she spends the overwhelming majority of the time with?... I'm already dogging the kid... For my family, we know who he is, so there's this inescapable sense of shock and overall dumbfoundedness. I guess the thing I can say for sure that contributed to that, is that he had a truck and was available at any moment.    I had thought that maybe they were just around each other enough and somehow this came about, but his awkwardness would've been a massive hurdle. But here's the deal, that^ is sorta how he put it to my brother whenever all this first came out. All while he's constantly lacking in details, which I think is purposeful on his part. I don't even hang out with him and even I noticed a difference in his personality while this was going on (which, of course, no one knew why) and he turned into a cocky shit talker. Obviously he was getting plenty out of it, but he can't let that show to his mom. Which brings us to him giving the very basics of things asked and he sorta lets everyone come to their own conclusions. (You know, like if you didn't know what the best thing is to say so you just give very little information and hope the other person builds off of it so you don't put yourself into a hole.) So really, no one in my family really knows how it got started, and honestly I don't think he's given anyone all of the story.  Maybe my brother has better info now that it's been a while since it first came out. I'll edit this and let you know if he does."

Compare this with a case where the boss says: ""suck my dick or you're fired"". Do you see these 2 cases identical? Because I don't. One is a case of: 2 people are horny, so they do what normal people do when they are horny (i.e. have sex), and one is abuse of power (which should, and is, punishable).  That's like saying: sure you're allowed to legally own a gun, but every time you fire it, even at the range, you go to jail for murder because some people fire guns in order to murder other people and we, the law, cannot be bothered to determine whether this was the case so, just in case, go to jail."

pussypassdenied,3c7439,Funcuz,0,Tue Jul 7 08:43:33 2015 UTC,"Well, think about it : What's the first thing she does after he slaps her ? ""And you not gonna say anything Aliyah ?"" So, as usual, a woman writes a check with her mouth that she expects somebody else to cash with their ass. My guess is that Aliyah is female and was astute enough to figure out that the usual ""sass"" wasn't going to work on this guy because he wouldn't be having any of it.   How many times have you seen women do that ? ""You don't know me ! I will fuck you up ! I'm a mean bitch..."" yada, yada, yada.  Know why they say that ? Because unlike men it's very rare for a man to say ""Oh ? Okay, let's find out."" Women always mouth off to men because they either expect that they won't be hit or they expect some White Knight Mangina to come along to take the beating for them.   I'm glad we're reluctant to hit women. That doesn't mean women deserve a pass no matter what they do."

For example, here in The U.K, the Liberals/SJWs have been the most vocal on social media and just media in general.

pussypassdenied,3bvduq,TardisTechnologist,3,Thu Jul 2 18:47:54 2015 UTC,"Thought I would post this update for you.  I was listed in the comments on the youtube channel.  ""UPDATE TO UNBELIEVABLE STORY ABOUT WOMEN WHO WERE CAUGHT ON VIDEO STEALING BEACH GEAR ON JULY 4TH (via Gawker.com): I reached out to the man—who asked that we refer to him only by his first name, Rich—through a mutual friend, and he gave some additional background on the encounter, including what happened after the video cut out; it involves one of the women screaming at Rich, ""I'll grab your dick!"": We were enjoying a great family day at the beach. My sons needed a nap. We were staying a block from the beach and decided to walk them home, and leave our chairs and canopy set up. I've been to New Smyrna Beach a thousand times and felt it was safe enough to do so. We were gone for about an hour and a half. My dad is a local and mentioned that Beach Patrol may pick up items that are left alone. I was skeptical but volunteered to check. My sister, Lib, offered to join as I was walking out the door but I told her I'd take care of it. From the boardwalk I was dismayed that I didn't see my canopy set up. Then I spotted our chairs loaded up in our beach cart with two women (attempting) to break down the canopy. I ran down the ramp to the beach and pulled out my iPhone to share what I was seeing with my wife and sister back at the house. If I were to judge a book by its cover, theft would not have been my first thought. I honestly thought they were being neighborly because NSB is Mayberry on the beach. I was surprised when they said it was theirs and stuck with the story. They were grasping for straws by saying my oldest son's beach toy belonged to them. I offered to let them move along but the one woman ""was not making it slide."" Her partner aka Tankini threatened to ""take that camera and put it in the grass."" There wasn't a blade of grass in sight so you know she meant business. She slapped at my phone, scratching the screen with a ring. I thought it was hilarious that this lady that was clearly in the wrong was actually coming at me. I did not intentionally stop the recording. What followed was pure gold. I continued to back up as we went around the canopy frame. In the most bizarre moment she gnashed her teeth, lunging at me with an open palm and said, ""I'll grab your dick!"" I appreciated the offer but didn't feel the chemistry was there. The two then said they needed to call ""Pat"", which may or may not have been the androgynous SNL character. He or she was going to apparently clarify what they were doing with my stuff. Lady in Red said, ""We need to get a phone, but not his. His phone is tainted."" They then scurried off towards the parking lot. I couldn't believe what just happened. I messaged the vid to my wife and sister back at the beach house, just the video without a message. The way the video ends I can now understand their concern. They told me they got in the car immediately and called the police right away. My wife, sister, and niece arrived a few minutes later, Beach Patrol a few minutes after that. I explained that nothing was taken and the ""assault"" didn't warrant filing a police report or pressing charges. The Beach Patrol Officer explained that this never happens in New Smyrna Beach, which I agree with wholeheartedly. The 4th of July holiday brought out large crowds of beachgoers and a few bad apples had less than the best intentions. We've definitely learned that you shouldn't leave your belongings unattended, even in Mayberry."""

It's just an awkward situation for some parents that could be easily avoided if the whore would just not flaunt the fact that she is a whore. Some people just have a hard time talking to their kids about this kind of stuff.  There isn't a way to justify how she was behaving. It's just hilarious cause you and everyone else trying to defend her would want to put a man (if a man was doing this) in jail. Public indecency is crude no matter the gender.

This effect reflects an emotional bias toward women as a general case. The phrase was coined by Eagly & Mladinic (1994) after finding that both men and women participants tend to assign exceptionally positive traits to women (men are also viewed positively, though not quite as positively), with woman participants showing a far more pronounced bias. The authors supposed that the positive general evaluation of women might derive from the association between women and nurturing characteristics.

You have to be so careful to not hurt them even though they are clearly the aggressor.  A proper society would have allowed these guys to use aggressive force to get her off their property.  I don't think it's productive to reward passive aggression and penalize open aggression.  They should be treated as equally bad.

pussypassdenied,3bj6tk,Sokonomi,19,Tue Jun 30 14:58:31 2015 UTC,"What?    Obstruction of justice   No police are involved at the point the video was made so there was nothing to obstruct.    Tampering with evidence   How was evidence tampered with?   Defamation of character   This is a civil issue, not a criminal issue and possibly the only thing you mentioned that might apply. However it almost always requires that the defamation was heard by a large audience which this wasn't. The video was, but the video does not defame.    lying under oath   Where is the witness box in this video? Where was the judge? When was she sworn in?   I think what this woman did was unacceptable and should be criminal, but you're just listing unrelated crimes that don't apply to the situation at all.   Had she reported a rape to the police they would be able to charge her with filing a false complaint and the victim could likely bring a civil suit against her for defamation. But that didn't happen."
pussypassdenied,3bj6tk,dangerousopinions,-16,Tue Jun 30 19:01:26 2015 UTC,"Obstruction of justice gets pinned on you when you call cops for no good reason. Though I suppose technically shed have to be the one calling the police.  Evidence is the video, I think she grabbed at the phone at one point, this is tampering with evidence.  Defamation of character. Trying to pin rape on someone with an albeit small audience is still defamation.  If she refuses to back down and is taken to court (you know, lawsuit), she would infact me lying under oath.  A good lawyer can make atleast one of these stick, which is good enough. Just call the cops yourself with a civil unrest and try to get her to keep up the ""I was being raped"" act infront of an officer. If shes smart shell shut the fuck up, but if shes dumb enough to push it, she'll be ready to take on some fire."
pussypassdenied,3bj6tk,Sokonomi,5,Tue Jun 30 21:12:15 2015 UTC,"That's not what obstruction is. What she did was not a crime. It would have been a crime had she filed a false complaint with the police, but then she would have been guilty of filing a false complaint, which is a crime, not obstructing.    Generally, obstruction charges are laid when it is discovered that a person questioned in an investigation, other than a suspect, has lied to the investigating officers.    .   Evidence is the video, I think she grabbed at the phone at one point, this is tampering with evidence.   That's not tampering with evidence either. If you murdered someone and destroyed the murder weapon you wouldn't be charged with tampering. This applies to investigations, not to the crime itself. ""Tampering with evidence, or evidence tampering, is an act in which a person alters, conceals, falsifies, or destroys evidence with the intent to interfere with an investigation (usually) by a law-enforcement, governmental, or regulatory authority.""    Defamation of character. Trying to pin rape on someone with an albeit small audience is still defamation.   Not legally it's not. Feel free to look that up. Defamation applies when an allegation or claim is made in public, with a large audience. There was recently a landmark case where the audience was small, and the reason it was successful was because it happened in an audience of people that were crucial to the claimants career success. Unless this woman made the false rape accusation public or it became public as a result of actions out of the victims control, there would be no chance of winning a defamation case.    If she refuses to back down and is taken to court (you know, lawsuit), she would infact me lying under oath.   If she gets on the stand and lies, yes, she would be lying under oath, but none of that happened so it's immaterial at this point.    A good lawyer can make atleast one of these stick, which is good enough. Just call the cops yourself with a civil unrest and try to get her to keep up the ""I was being raped"" act infront of an officer. If shes smart shell shut the fuck up, but if shes dumb enough to push it, she'll be ready to take on some fire.   This happened years ago, so it's moot. Had she brought the false complaint to the police or made the complaint publicly the victim would have some recourse. There is nothing he can do as a result of what actually happened though, other than what he already did. He would be wasting his money with a defamation case he would probably lose because it was not a public allegation and she didn't commit a crime since she never reported any crime falsely or otherwise."

I know most women aren't like that but since I was little I have heard girls throw around the phrase ""I'll just say he raped me"" sometimes joking sometimes threatening but luckily never really escalated to anything. Still my friend was accused of rape when we were hanging out with a girl one summer morning when we were young teens getting drunk. She got wasted, tried to get with my friend and was rejected in a very polite way. She went away for a little while and then came back with a knife screaming rape. We called her brother told him what happened and got the fuck out of there. Later that night my friend got jumped by the girl's uncle and his friends, kidnapped to their house where they punched him around. People say I'm paranoid but all it takes is one irrational crazy bitch to ruin my life completely."

pussypassdenied,3bj6tk,amedeus,13,Tue Jun 30 02:09:09 2015 UTC,"Sorry to disappoint but no. We were very young around 15 and we were drinking. It gets worse though, this girl convinced quite a few of her friends that my friend did actually attempt to rape her and that I recorded the whole thing on my cell so a few white knights ended up jumping him. I got punished too. I went to a small house party a couple years later and I didn't know the bitch was there. This cute girl started talking to me and told me to come with her. We walked into a bedroom and as soon as I walked in the bitch (The one who cried rape) slapped me in the face as hard as she could. It honestly hurt. like a motherfucker. The upside is that during that summer I saw the cute girl again and she apologized to me saying she had no idea that bitch was such a notorious liar. Apparently my friend wasn't the only victim, from what we know she pulled that shit at least two more times and all her friends turned on her. Idk how she stayed in HS for four years after that with everyone hating her and nobody trusting her. She went from being quite popular to having no friends and being picked on. She still tried her best to convince people that she was the victim but there was too much proof. Why we didn't go to the cops? Idk about the rest of the people but me and my buddy are just happy to have our names cleared and that it's all behind us. Besides we did not want to risk anything. As for her family idk. Her brother was the only one who believed us and tried his best to inform everyone. He no longer lives with them and says he only visits for major events but hates being there."

pussypassdenied,3biit2,skekze,15,Thu Jul 16 23:06:54 2015 UTC,"I dated a woman back 2006 for about 4 months until she broke it off. I wanted to keep seeing her so I would show up at events where I knew she would be. I did this for about a year or two off and on until I eventually got a certified letter from her saying that she wanted no contact. I was confused because although I showed up at these events because I knew she might be there, the communications between us was always cordial, mutually engaging and often times flirtatious on her part (one time she wanted me to stay after a party had ended giving me a smoochy face.) In spite of all of the confusion, I respected her wishes (once I knew for certain what they were,) and did not have any contact for at least three and a half years. In 2013 I started taking a bus from my home to downtown where I both worked and went to school (finishing my undergrad,) and saw her sitting on the same bus. I thought to myself (not a great thing to do,) that since it had been a few years, that there was probably no more bad blood between us, so I sat next to her and started conversation. We talked on three separate occasions in a six month time span, the conversations were cordial, mutually engaging and lasted for the whole 40 minutes to our mutual stop. The conversations we had sometimes involved personal experiences that had been happening in our lives the last few years, it almost seemed that we were given a chance to heal our own pasts with each other, (since our dads were good friends,) it seemed right. At this point I wanted absolutely nothing from her in any fashion except that we can remain cordial to each other in the event that we were cast into the same arena (which was likely.) then it happened. I got served with a stalking provision order AT MY WORK. I had to get an attorney, In court she cried and made a fool of herself because everyone could tell that it was fake (I honestly believe this woman is a sociopath, or at the very least  narcissist.) The FEMALE judge did not even hear my case (and it was very strong, I am a paralegal and I know what a strong case looks like,) she dismissed it, but not before scolding us both (me for coming into contact with this woman.) In the process I had found out that at the time that I received the certified letter from her, she had tried back then to get a restraining order but the judge told her that she did not have anything in which to base it on. Twice she tried to stick it to me. On the outside she is smart, successful and genuinely a fun person to be around, but inside she is so fucking damaged it is not even funny. It really is not funny, it is sad. She will always be the victim in her head, and will never allow herself the opportunity to heal or grow up. She is incapable of this. This is why I always pray on the side of the psychopaths and sociopaths. Having been in contact with one this personally has made me feel extremely empathetic towards them, if for nothing else than their inability to experience the same for others.   TL;dR   Man dates crazy woman, years later thinks it is safe to talk to on the bus, finds out in court just how crazy she is."

There would be times when she would do stuff, like grab me, or wink at me, text me and tell me she is wearing her shiny lip gloss, tell me to come over. I think she has a broken door knob (in that she does not know how to tell someone no,) but you are right, I was a creep, and I have done a lot of work around this since then.

You picked yourself up by your bootstraps when you were 14 and living in an impoverished single-parent household to work full-time after school to provide for your family? Is it because you became a successful entrepreneur by working 60+ hours a week and going to school on the side in order to further your marketable value in the workplace?  It is because he made an unreasonable request?  Oh, it's because you're an entitled bitch who has never had someone tell her, ""No""? Got it."

We discussed who would give her away at the wedding, and I voiced my opinion that her Uncle should (as the groom here should have).  She took the path of least resistance and opted to skip that formality because she knew it would be heartbreaking to her Uncle to see her dad give her away, and that her dad would make a scene if he wasn't chosen.

I remember crying on the phone talking to my grandpa and telling him I didn't know what to do. Because somewhere deep inside of me is still a little girl who doesn't want to hurt her daddy.

Just like they've already internalized the fact that women can hit men but men can't hit women, even in self-defense."
pussypassdenied,3bbb5r,Jah_Ith_Ber,50,Sun Jun 28 00:31:20 2015 UTC,"They've internalised that a man ""can't hit women"", even in self defense of another woman. Whoopie Goldberg said it best, which interestingly gets applause which I'm pretty sure wouldn't happen if a man had said that..   Men usually know you don't provoke a fight unless you are prepared to fight or prepared to risk a fight. We also expect that if a smaller weaker man starts a fight with a stronger man it's still his responsibility. If a bigger boy is being bullied by a smaller boy in school and he finally smacks the shit out of his bully we cheer.. Being smaller than someone or even weaker over all is never considered relevant unless we're talking about a man and a woman. That's why we don't see people say ""never hit someone smaller/weaker than you"", we see them say ""never hit women/girls"". What I find interesting is that so many women not only seem to think they can provoke a fight with a man and not get hit no matter what size or strong the man is, but think they are immune from getting hit even when they do so with someone who is obviously stronger and possibly dangerous.  Here's an example. I saw a video of a CCTV camera showing a street late at night with what looks like people coming out of bars and clubs. A couple of girls walk past this guy standing on the path who apparently said something to them as they walk by (someone in the comments said he spat at them but I'm not sure you could make that out). Now to me, as a man, I'd immediately know that going back and confronting him is very likely going to result in a fight of some kind. I immediately ask myself if I am prepared to fight the guy, if I'm not I know I just keep walking. The women went back and started to presumably shout at him for whatever he said or did and then he attacks them. I'm sure men might well have confronted him as well, but the women probably had this idea that he wasn't going to attack them because they're just ""weak women"" or something.   And the likelihood is women are still usually treated better by their attackers in these cases than a man would be. It also seems like doublethink for so many to say there's a big problem of violence against women but act surprised if a woman gets attacked, hit or beaten if they attack or provoke a man. I mean seriously, in all these videos I've seen they're always shocked they got hit.   I just wish they would be honest and say they think women should be given special treatment because they're women rather than argue there's some reasonable, non-sexist reason. It's like when my mum always tells me I should do all these chivalrous things for women, like open doors, pull their seats out when you're eating at a restaurant, give up your seat if they need it, pay for dinner, etc etc. I tried to talk about it to her once, she said it was ""just being polite"", except she also said that she only thinks men should do it. Her doublethink was so great that she couldn't accept that it can't be about politeness if it's only an expectation of men, or she would have to be saying women shouldn't need to be polite. But that's where we are now, where traditionalism and feminism has people holding such mutually exclusive ideas in their head at the same time. It's like they know they can't admit they want women to have special treatment while saying they want true equality, yet they can't give up the position either. The mental gymnastics that you bear witness to when you see someone trying to justify this thinking is really kind of interesting, you can practicably see the wheels and cogs turning."

pussypassdenied,3bbb5r,nogoodliar,37,Sat Jun 27 19:32:43 2015 UTC,"Gonna go out on a limb here for a second and give my 'interpretive' play-by-play from what I see in the video.  The video opens with two girls fighting, and two girls trying to break it up (tall one in black shirt and girl in green shirt).   In the beginning it looks like the father is watching his daughter (in white) fight the other girl, because he casually strolls into the fight to help break it up when she starts losing. Only that's when the other girls start trying to pull him off, and he begins pushing them out of the fight they're trying to break up.  At that point the tall girl in black confronts him, and appears to be saying something like ""Don't you touch me"" (she had been trying to break up the fight but he pushed her out), so he clocked her across the face. Then he clocks people that hit him, and then those who keep going after his daughter (though she appears to instigate half of it).  The whole melee starts when he waded into it, not when his daughter is fighting. That appeared to be a 1-on-1 in the middle of a group.  So, the tl;dr would be: father watches daughter fight, she starts losing, so he tries to break it up. He hits girl that gets in his face, and that triggers melee where he goes all Kimbo Slice on their asses."

Reddit   People from all walks of life, from all over the world, a multitude of experiences blended together in such a way, one may be able to say that almost every taste, like, dislike etc.. can be represented here in some fashion, great or small. All of these people entirely anonymous if they choose to be.. and somehow, all of the people interested in one particular thing in this example (naked women/read: attractiveness), lobbied to only upvote in shape/fit/worldly-attractive women in a very popular subreddit /r/gonewild.   The lack of upvotes for fat women, chubby women, or worldly-unattractive women rang so loudly, that those females who fit the unfit description, had to create a second subreddit for just them.  Then something beautiful happened in the new subreddit. Curvy women kicked the fatter ones out even further. The curvy (stringent use) women received upvotes and the fat ones had to go find somewhere else to go and be lauded.   So that begot even more subreddits, eventually ending in the horrorshow that is /r/immobile  (dont go there.. I'm warning you).  The takeaway is that anonymous people from the furthest reaches of the planet all banded together to say ""yeah, no fatties""."

My ex with really bad bipolar issues once found my new address, showed up, begged me to talk while drinking whiskey straight from the bottle. I told her I was gonna call her mom to come get her, she attacked me. I tried to hold her down for about forty minutes until my roommates got back. She was absolutely relentless. She would get an arm free and just start ripping up my face with her nails, punching me, etc.   When my fantastic roommates came home, they assumed that I was beating the hell out of her and pulled me off. She grabbed my shotgun, couldn't figure out how to load it, and just hit me with it.. a lot. My roommate finally was able to call her mom, but the neighbor had already called up the cops. They came (actually a female cop) right as she was smashing my windshield with a grill cover in the parking lot. I told the cops that I didn't want to press any charges when they asked, but they put her in cuffs anyway and said that the state was.  Through the scuffle, almost my home got destroyed, I lost a lot of stuff, and I looked a lot like ol' dude up there in the picture. Meanwhile, the only marks she had on her body were on her hands. Worst part, I had to go to domestic violence court and sit on the victim side of the courtroom with a lot of battered women giving me death stares. The court put up pictures they took of me that night on a big screen for everyone to see. Fun stuff. Funny story now cause, hey, I survived. She got a whole lot of state mandated counseling and whatnot because I just didn't speak in court and kept telling them I already refused to press charges. Pussy pass: Denied."

Normal people sometimes are guilty of projection, for example, feeling that other people are angry at us when we don't want to admit we're angry at them, or feeling other people are biased when we ourselves are. But our empathy for others and sense of personal responsibility keeps this in check.  But abusers take this to a whole different level of absurdity. Because they can't empathize and can't process personal responsibility.  For example, Donald Rumsfeld accusing the Iraqis of having secret weapons of mass destruction (not that he would know anything about secret weapons, as secretary of defense.....)    Whenever an abusive person, out of the blue accuses you of doing something for no reason, it's a sure bet they've done it themselves. Abusers aren't the most creative or imaginative people on the planet.  Abuser believe that other people secretly think and act like they do."

If somebody beat me up and broke my collarbone and gave me several other injuries, and ran as soon as I got a gun, what's to say they're not running for their vehicle that has guns in it? What's to say they're not going to come back later? What's to say they're not just running for cover so they can fire back with whatever drop-gun they have?  Just because you run away from somebody, does not mean you are not a threat. It simply means you have put distance between the person you threatened."

pussypassdenied,3b09r6,Random_Link_Roulette,-3,Thu Jun 25 15:47:24 2015 UTC,Alright...I'm not typing this to say the people who disagree with me are wrong. It's your life and your family and your home. You defend it how you like that is your right and I will stand and fight for your right to do so how ever I can but hear me out. I have been in this position before on BOTH sides of it. When I was younger I was stupid. If my life was ended when I was at my worst I wouldn't be here today Perusing my social work degree and trying to help people not get into these situations. And if I shot the man who broke into my house id be taking away the same chance I had and I hope he finds. I'm not telling you that you are wrong to defend your own. Because you are not. But I hope maybe you will read this and understand that it is not so cut and dry as kill or be killed. I won't take your life for such a matter not because I lack the balls to do so. I've been to prison and I've lived the hard life. I won't take your life because I honestly believe more often then not these situations can be solved without the loss of life. To each his own. But I value your life weather you are stealing from me or you just punched me in the face. Sure I'll kick ur ass but I wouldn't end it.   I've been involved in dozens of break and enters. And I've had someone break into my house twice while I was home. None of them ended with a loss of life. That's a pretty good ratio. And most of them had a chance to end with the loss of life.

You've already shown no regard for me, my family, or my house when you broke the law by kicking in my door or breaking my window. You may be a dumb teenager, you may be a crackhead looking to score something to sell, or you may be a murderer. I'm not taking any chances for you when you decided put my family in danger."

I too was a thief (spent six years on the streets) and all I wanted was to take something ( a bike, something to cover me at night, food, clothes) not hurt anyone and I'm so lucky I never got shot for my sins. I was a mixed up, young, drunk wanderer and though several times I legally could have been blown away, I thank God I wasn't. Today I'm sober, sane, honorable, married with a wonderful boy and my own business. Though I could have paid the ultimate sacrifice for my sins, I'm glad I didn't and so is my boy."

If I attempt to kill you, for example, I don't have that right. You may kill me defending yourself. You understand this, surely.  Now that wasn't the exact situation here, but the whole area of criminal rights is gray for the same reason. You have the right not to be kidnapped, correct? Until you Ron someone. Then suddenly the police may kidnap you. Your rights changed.  It's largely a problem of information. We are always acting on limited facts and when someone is killed, we only get to hear from one side. But this is why the killer was investigated and he would have been charged if it was deemed that he had violated her rights.  He wasn't charged. The justice system was involved, and it cleared him."

However, in my opinion ""fairness"" goes out the window if someone breaks into my home and assaults me.  In this situation the laws of nature and of our U.S. Legal system both favor self defense and punishing of the intruder.  It is dangerous precedence to rule in favor of the criminal.

I'm all for self-defense, but an armed person shooting an unarmed person in the back is not self-defense. It's this that's the dangerous precedent, because how can anyone be 100% sure about what happened, and what exactly was justified, when it's a homeowner's word against that of a dead person?  Whatever way you look at it it's basically a legal defense to murder, just like those stupid 'stand your ground' laws, and surely you can see it's hideously open to abuse.  From another angle, let's say that instead of the homeowner it was a policeman that chased the suspect down. Would they have the right to do what the homeowner did? I doubt it.  I don't believe that any sober justice system should allow for legalised vengeance or retribution, which is what this is."
pussypassdenied,3b09r6,wjw75,4,Thu Jun 25 12:41:59 2015 UTC,"Actually the police can shoot a fleeing felon in the back if they have proven that they have the intent to cause death or serious bodily injury to the public.

What we are discussing is the level of defense warranted.  What is reasonable?  To me it is reasonable to chase intruders who've shown malicious intent, off my property and the immediate area.  How far?  Until I felt safe they wouldn't return to finish what they started.  I agree that, on its face, shooting someone in the back is tough to argue as acting in self defense.  But, this is akin to saying ""why punish your toddler, if after their misbehaving they beg and plead"".  We all know why punishment is warranted, because a wrong is to be righted.  If not, then you are conditioning misbehaving people to simply plead, or in this case, run away from their law breaking.  Do you think they would think twice before committing his crime again?"

It's not even the lack of empathy, it is the way some of you seem to revel in this outcome of death for a human being. With comments like:   scum is dead, and the home owner is in the clear.  That's pretty much the most hardcore pass-denial I've seen here.  Sounds like a great neighbor.   Let's cover some of the things we know here.  I am going to reference the original article, and another article that was more recently updated on the latimes.   Thomas Greer's home was burglarized twice in the past. Andrea Miller, before being killed, claimed she was pregnant. There was an accomplice named Gus Adams, and possibly his mother Ruby Adams who may have served as a look-out. There is a strong implication that they were not armed as Greer was the only one to fire a gun.   The break down:   Ruby Adams allegedly keeps look out as her son Gus Adams and Andrea Miller broke into Thomas Greer's home on July 22nd. Greer gets home around 9PM to find Miller and Adams attempting to break into his safe. In this confrontation, Miller and Adams break Greer's collar bone. Somehow Greer gets to his bedroom, where he grabs his gun. Miller and Adams flee, but as they are fleeing, Miller is shot and falls once by the garage, and again in a nearby alley way. Greer drags Miller's body into the garage in the hopes of luring Adams back. Adam's comes back, steals Greer's gun and phone and flees with his mother in a vehicle.   My take on the situation:  Greer is an old man who has been robbed twice before, think of Clint Eastwood in Grand Torino. He has pent up anger regarding the repeated violations of his personal space, which is understandable by all.  However, where things get tricky is when you think, ""There you go, there is the justification! He has valid reason to think his life was in danger; therefore, he has the legal and moral right to kill."" It gets tricky because for one he has lived through two previous burglaries, and furthermore, according to Bureau of Justice Statistics', out of the 3.7 million burglaries that occur each year, only 7% include violence, and even less result in deaths.  In states like Texas, if you know a burglar is unarmed you cannot legally kill them unless there is some other imminent threat to your life.  Here is what I think, I think Greer was pissed off and this event pushed him over the edge. He wanted someone to pay for the wrongs done to him in the past, whoever he could reach would pay, and that person was Andrea Miller. Supported by his own words, ""The lady didn't run as fast as the man, so I shot her in the back twice, she's dead ... but he got away."" I'm not saying Andrea Miller was a saint, but I'm saying there is a reason Greer was so intent on killing these perpetrators, to the degree that he would risk further bodily harm to himself in the hopes of luring back, and killing, Gus Adams. That speaks volumes about his state of mind.  Lastly, what if she was in fact telling the truth? Would you be so quick to revel in the sense of justice? Would you just chalk it up to the mother's fault, and the unborn baby as collateral damage?   I have always found that mercy bears richer fruits than strict justice. - Abraham Lincoln   Random story, there is a man Patrick Ferguson who refused to shoot an officer of the union in the back, later to be believed none other than George Washington. It is very possible, even in war and imminent death, to show mercy and to live by some sense of honor.  I'm not defending the actions of the perpetrators, I'm just saying, let's not be overly joyed in the death of a human being. We don't know the circumstances in her life which pushed her to commit such crimes. Nobody is born wanting to be a drug addict, thief, or murderer. At the very least, we can all understand that sometimes, shit happens in life. We should all be grateful to be in circumstances better than her's.  Author and neuroscientist Sam Harris has a video where he discusses the case of Charles Whitman.  Mr. Whitman started his killing spree by killing his wife and mother, and had no clear idea why he was doing it. He went up on a clock tower and killed a dozen or so more people. Before being killed, he wrote a note recommending scientist examine his brain.  Upon examining his brain, it was found he had a brain tumor pressing on his amygdala. The amygdala plays a primary role in decision making.  Sam suggests, ""retribution is actually an artifact of our not seeing the causes, the true causes, of human behavior."" He continues, ""A brain tumor is just a special case of physical events giving rise to events and actions. If we could perfectly understand the brain of one murder, no matter how evil, that understanding of the neurophysiology would be as exculpatory as a tumor... The basis of placing blame would disappear.""  So through this case, we can see that even events which seem so black and white, are often not so clear when you really examine them. If we can come to some level of understanding with Whitman, who committed a heinous crime, then can we at least put a little thought into the case of the human being Andrea Miller, and possibly examine the motives that drove Thomas Greer to seek out death with such fervor?"

I've been to prison and I've lived the hard life. I won't take your life because I honestly believe more often then not these situations can be solved without the loss of life. To each his own. But I value your life weather you are stealing from me or you just punched me in the face. Sure I'll kick ur ass but I wouldn't end it.   I've been involved in dozens of break and enters.

If you've ever been in a situation like that then you would understand the only thing in your head is protection of your stuff, family, and yourself. Once someone enters your home it's an immediate threat upon you and your family. Yelling at a robber to get on their knees with their hands above their head like some sort of super-solder you think you are doesn't work. Don't be a fucking retard and quite waiting our times here, I have pussypasses I need to watch be denied."

But the focus isn't the robbery or death  See that could've flown by as ""Female robber gets shot and dies"" and bam there's nothing about it  But instead it's a celebration that someone, who is a woman, died.  That's the reason this is really sick, you guys are trying to justify ""she robbed, she died"" and conveniently ignore how thrilled you all are about it.  I have no idea what happened in your life for you to have such malice towards woman to paint a death of one as simple as good or bad  But you need to consider how redpill this all sounds."

pussypassdenied,3b1xpc,Kibaoftheleaves,2,Sat Jul 18 22:52:47 2015 UTC,"I shadowed some surgeons for a while. As soon as the patient is out, their demeanor totally changes,  ""What the fuck is this thing? Is this even a human?""  I think it's a power play and a coping mechanism, you have to turn off an empathy switch to some degree to deal.  Now I'm absolutely not condoning it, though it's part of a ""culture"" that goes unchecked and can get out of hand. It's not malpractice if the surgeon calls you a retard while you're under anesthesia but still accomplishes everything he/she needs to. It is malpractice when you falsify notes and diagnoses, having a recording of you calling the patient a retard while they were under will only help the jury to seal the nails in your coffin.  The doctor here is getting most of her notoriety from the abusive things she said. This is common ground in operating room procedures, seriously. The average person, obviously, just doesn't know that, so it's a huge shocker to think that a doctor would make fun of you while sedated, surprise, doctors are assholes too! It's the malpractice (falsifying records and diagnoses) in addition to this crass name calling that accounted for this rather large settlement.  We place our absolute trust in doctors. That means they don't use that power and make up shit and tell us we have ailments that we don't have. If you do that while being an asshole? Well kiss your license goodbye."
pussypassdenied,3b1xpc,crappysurfer,5,Fri Jun 26 15:23:35 2015 UTC,"Actually just to give the other side of the coin for a second - I'm an anaesthetist in the UK so, of course things may be different over here.   I've never once been in a situation where somebody has anyone slagged off a patient when they've been asleep. Sometimes we comment on silly tattoos, question how on earth they've managed to get into an operating theatre without having a bath since admission or guess how many piercings they have but certainly no where near to the extent that this case says.  Even when our patients are asleep  and naked we do our best to preserve dignity by covering up genitalia and breasts as soon as possible so they're not completely exposed even though they'll have no knowledge of it.  The only possible exception to this is when someone comes in with something stuck up their arse after a sex game goes wrong. Even then it's normally taking the piss out of what they've actually stuck up there and the incredible story they made up whilst trying to retain some dignity (LPT: nobody is going to believe you got that shower gel stuck because you slipped getting out of the bath).    Sometimes things get a bit close to the cuff during CPR or hyperacute resuscitations but that's more black humour trying not to confront what we're actually dealing with by making a joke out of it.   Either there is a completely different culture in theatres in the US, or this guy was such a complete and total wanker that he managed to wind absolutely everyone up. I'm leaning towards the latter just by the fact he secretly recorded what was going on. No ""normal"" person brings there phones with them, let alone presses record and hides it under the trolley."
pussypassdenied,3b1xpc,FentPropTrac,3,Sun Jun 28 00:19:38 2015 UTC,"I'm truly starting to believe that by the time people become doctors, they aren't doing it to actually help people and make a difference like when they first told themselves when they entered Med school. After long years in school and thousands in loans, they get burnt out and become doctors for the money and the high esteemed position in society. They just try to convince themselves they are still doing it to help people and not for the money, when really they are."
pussypassdenied,3b1xpc,eyeboogi,1 point,Sun Jul 5 05:09:23 2015 UTC,"That's an interesting comment, and one I've had to reflect on.  I'm not in it for the money - the UK doesn't pay nearly as well as the US does and if I were chasing coin I'd probably move to the states. I earn around $100k (although this is heavily taxed) whereas in the US the median salary is around $430k with lower rates of tax.   I'm not sure I've burned out, however I'm definitely not the naive young thing I was when I entered med school and here's why:  Modern medicine can't actually ""cure"" that many things. Unless you've got an infection that can be treated with antibiotics, or you require some sort of surgery, the chances of you walking out of a hospital with a ""cure"" are slim to none. We do reasonably well at medicating patients to allow them to live a reasonable life with (some) chronic conditions but we have no ability to completely rid people of them. Those that are medicated have to cope with side effects of the drugs, sometimes those side effects are worse than the original condition, however because they prolong life people take them.   When you've dedicated the best years of your life to the exclusion of almost everything else, only to pop out the other side and realise that all that sacrifice hasn't put you in a position to remove people of their disease burden it makes you....cynical.   One also has to take into account that in order to make people better we often have to inflict pain and suffering upon them then see them day after day living with the pain that you've inflicted until they're well enough to go somewhere else if they're lucky.  If they're not you'll inflict that pain on them, then they'll die. I had a patient on Friday who went in for a bypass. I struggled to get his neck line in due to some very strange anatomy. I know that he was uncomfortable but there was little I could do at the time. Then I put him to sleep and he died after the operation having never woken up. Did I help him? No I didn't. Would he be dead if he hand't had the bypass - no he probably wouldn't. Were his last experiences on earth being hurt and claustrophobic as I put a neck line in? Yes they were.  Tomorrow morning I have to go in and do another bypass and convince myself that I'm going to help, and try and push the memories of the difficult conversation with Friday's widow in the back of my mind.   What motivates me? Partly it's the technical and intellectual challenge - controlling abnormal physiology, trying to anticipate how not to fuck up, the puzzle solving and having the ability to see instant results from my interventions. Do I ""care"" about patients? I'm invested in their outcome certainly, I want them to do well and I want to do the best by them, but if I cared in the literal sense of the word I just wouldn't be able to function as a doctor."

Wow, that really got me. ""The best years of your life."" That really made me think about the time I too wanted to become a doctor when I was doing Pre-med studies. After long thought, I think the one thing I remember when I was changing my career was indeed about dedicating my best years (The twenties) for so long when my other peers would have been easily settled in by time I got the hang of the ropes.  Yeah, I can understand how in the medical field doctors are encouraged not to get too close to their patients as it can affect their mental and emotional state should anything happen to them. That really puts a good perspective for me."

All evidence entered into court has to have a chain of authenticity with it,to prove that it hasn't been tampered with.  Because court records are public information, you can actually go into court and hear them explain how they collected the evidence and what has hapenned to it.  If you go down to the court-house, you'll regularly see reporters hanging around in the public observation galleries, keeping an ear out for exactly this sort of disposable headline.  They just listen out for the interesting cases and evidence, and write up a story about it.  The police don't want to tell criminals how to avoid being caught, the newspapers want curious people to see semething new."
pussypassdenied,3ay28b,Zidanet,2,Thu Jun 25 06:21:42 2015 UTC,"To be fair, this is also how groups figure out when police have fabricated evidence in order to get someone falsely convicted. Transparency is a double-edged blade."

The top comment on the page linked said it best, ""if she can fit in a car, she can fit in a jail cell."" But, I have another view. It's really fucked up, but it's possible this disgusting murderer may wind up have a longer, better quality, life.  The pussy pass is I think that, while many of us found her disgusting even before she killed a man, there's still going to be some kind of lingering sympathy there for her which wouldn't be there for a man of her size.  This defense really pisses me off. As someone who deals with certain mental/emotional issues, no way could I commit vehicular homicide, then attempt to stay out of prison by claiming I'm not strong enough, emotionally, to handle a prison sentence. That's just bullshit.  If her sentence is 30 months, let's say she serves 22 months of it. Potentially, while serving her sentence, she could lose a fuck ton of weight. The way she looks now, she probably wouldn't be around very long. Maybe she wouldn't even live past the duration of her sentence. It's also possible she would encounter major health problems but remain alive  because of modern science. The money to pay for all her doctor and hospital visits, medicine, equipment, etc., would come from Joe and Jan Tax Payer.  If, and this is an If as big as her, she were to somehow lose weight and come out of jail with a better mindset, one that makes her appreciate life, there's a chance a lot of people end up winning. Well, everyone but the man who was killed and his family."

For far too long men have been subjected to false rape claims and only for them to be dismissed or withdrawn and the claimant receiving nothing more than a don't do it again.    Too many times the spokespeople for rape victims come out and say that, sure, it's not very helpful when this type of thing happens, but they shouldn't be punished because it will discourage real rape victims from coming out because they feel like they won't be believed and maybe will be punished for it.  How about throwing the book at these false rape accusers until they get the message that it won't be tolerated and we can get to the business of dealing with real rape victims without having to wonder if they are lying or not and just help them.  But I fear this will not happen."

People lose jobs, get divorced, lose custody of their children over false rape charges. And certain women do not hesitate to use rape accusations as a weapon when the consequences can destroy people's lives in addition to trivializing real rape cases. Why not? They have everything to gain (revenge against the person that scorned her) and nothing to lose.  I'd dare say the aftermath can be even worse than real rape cases, but then people will say I am a misogynist. Rape victims can find the strength to recover and move on with their lives.

She's lied at literally every stage, and there's much evidence there's been vote manipulation, shadowbans, and other bullshit social engineering along the way on Reddit.  Meanwhile she then tried to sue the company for her court fees, stating that she's owed the money that would have gone to a lawyer, as she represented herself.

pussypassdenied,3aev6k,ArsenioHallAndOates,8,Fri Jun 19 22:20:19 2015 UTC,"That's all any corporate management is nowadays. A blank, easily manipulated and controlled mannequin."
pussypassdenied,3aev6k,i_naked,23,Fri Jun 19 22:46:51 2015 UTC,"She was an early investor, and is AZN, so she's friends with Wong the dong."
pussypassdenied,3aev6k,FrogBlast,10,Fri Jun 19 20:31:33 2015 UTC,"Her employer offered to drop counter charges if she drops the case and she declined.   No, her employer offered to leave her off the hook for the legal fees if she dropped her appeal, but she refused unless Kleiner Perkins paid her $2.7m"
pussypassdenied,3aev6k,Trust_Me_Im_a_Panda,5,Fri Jun 19 22:59:54 2015 UTC,So on top of her husband's amount owed they stacked on nearly $300k?
pussypassdenied,3aev6k,Pms9691,3,Fri Jun 19 22:57:26 2015 UTC,"Her husband's ponzi scheme is a totally separate situation. But of course, being legally married, it is a shared problem for them both."
pussypassdenied,3aev6k,Trust_Me_Im_a_Panda,42,Sat Jun 20 03:51:46 2015 UTC,"It's a fun little tidbit of civil legal procedure. If someone makes you a reasonable settlement offer, and you then reject it, and the verdict that is returned is LESS than what you were offered, you have to pay the opposing party's legal fees from the time the offer was rejected through the end of the trial.   This has nothing to do with pussy passes, or Ellen Pao hate, or thinking she's a cunt, or that she was wrong. It's just civil procedure, and applies to everyone equally."
pussypassdenied,3aev6k,testbug0,9,Fri Jun 19 18:55:49 2015 UTC,Not legal fees. Only costs and related expenses incurred in connection with defending the case from that point forward. You don't get attorney's fees shifted under this rule (although there are other fee-shifting statutes that apply to attorney's fees and of course parties are free to contract for this type of fee-shifting).
pussypassdenied,3aev6k,Trust_Me_Im_a_Panda,3,Fri Jun 19 23:12:24 2015 UTC,"You are correct. I should have been more specific and said ""court costs"" and not ""legal fees."" My fault."

pussypassdenied,3aev6k,Griever114,88,Fri Jun 19 16:45:31 2015 UTC,At least she didn't successfully blackmail for the exact amount to cover the legal fees for her husband's ponzi scheme like she wanted to.
pussypassdenied,3aev6k,Webonics,152,Fri Jun 19 17:34:49 2015 UTC,That and im sure this years bonus will be close to $276k.

pussypassdenied,3aev6k,TuesdayRB,4,Fri Jun 19 23:49:16 2015 UTC,The denial already happened in her losing the case which was totally PPD. This is just follow up leading to her second dinial when she loses on appeal.
pussypassdenied,3aev6k,showershitters,2,Fri Jun 19 17:35:18 2015 UTC,Exactly. They offered her 1.5 mil I thought?  And she didn't accept. That was the real denial lmao. Amazing.

If it's a repost to you, just downvote and move on. If it's new, upvote and read it. If it makes it to the front page, it's because people upvoted it. No reason to get all shitty about already having seen it."
pussypassdenied,3aev6k,JosephND,28,Sat Jun 20 05:53:48 2015 UTC,Certain mods in certain subs have removed these Ellen Pao stories. For various reasons but usually the 'witch hunt' excuse. So they blow up then are removed quickly. So many people agree with the recent censorship ideals of Pao.

Ask him what you getting arrested for. If you feel unfairly treated make a complaint after the arrest, and if you feel your rights been violated get a lawyer and proceed from there.    Dear Bystander   Feel free to record the incident, but stay a safe distance from the officer so he can do his job. If you related/Friends with the person begin detained, call their Family member/Lawyer. Try ask the officer information relating to where the person arrested can be reached by his family/lawyer   Why is this so damn difficult? Its just damn horrible seeing people getting tazed or shoot for a situation when all that could be avoided."

Edit: Im a realtor and landlord, in south Florida, many landlords wont rent to you if you have any arrests on your background screening. Some will even try to raise rent or try to evict you if you get arrested while renting from them, and many places will fire you too. Yes, I know you can get them removed, and that SOME people with records have fulfilling careers, but most of the time from the date of arrest to the date you get it removed from your record is a huge inconvenience and can be expensive if you have to hire an attorney.

pussypassdenied,3aamck,jorisx3,33,Fri Jun 19 11:08:07 2015 UTC,"That's not strange at all. Precious resources are known to attract thieves and criminal behaviors.  I've noticed that many cultures that are oppressing women have another side where they glorify them.   It's basically like a father being overprotective of his daughter, like locking their women in golden cages to ""protect"" them.  In many Muslim countries the women actually have a huge power, but only in very limited spaces, they are covered with gold and jewels by their husbands, they are seen as semi holy by the society...and that's exactly why they are oppressing them in remaining ""pure and holy"".   You wouldn't believe the amount of shit a husband that's not fullfiling his side of the contract can receive by his wife, his family, his wive's family or the whole village: he'll be shuned and mocked and you can even see scenes where the husband is actually flogged by a group of angry village women . Not trying to say that the husband is the real victim here, just saying that oppressive societies are oppressive to everybody, only in different degrees and situations."

pussypassdenied,3aamck,ghastlyactions,1 point,Fri Jun 19 21:27:06 2015 UTC,"Thanks. Looking at the data, I think there is an error in the collection of the data.

It may be that there is more respect for women in India than in the UK. Or perhaps the amount of rapes in India dropped off a ton between 2007 and 2011. Or, as I said, there was an error the data collection, which I find more likely."

You don't teach people lessons, or pass your judgement. You uphold the law, outside of that you are wrong. You use only the amount of force necessary to control the situation. If you can't take the high road everyday then don't be a police officer. She is not a professional, she is a drunk and what she did is expected behavior.

Your message, while being very similar in the actual message, was much longer and more detailed. While some people may appreciate that amount of detail, others will not, and would prefer shorter messages. The ratio of the response to the first message was approximately 5:1, which of course is makes the original message about 20% as long as the response. If the response comment was 1 dollar in length, the original was around two dimes, or 4 nickels, but /u/SkoobyDoo is saying they have approximately the same value.

Instead of arming them to the teeth, we should be giving them more PTO, helping them deal with the stress, and providing them with top notch training. Since they rarely get any of those, I can see why this sort of thing happens.  That being said, I guess the officer on this incident had a history of aggressive behavior and probably shouldn't have been put on duty."

It was unreasonable for her to make an aggressive action against a cop when she had no way to defend herself.  The only reason I dislike this is because he is a cop and needs to keep a cool head as much as possible since he is the professional here. Other then that she deserved what she got."

pussypassdenied,3a7see,SellingSomeShit,6,Thu Jun 18 04:29:17 2015 UTC,White knighting is when guys 'protect' girls that are the instigators of a conflict. A girl might slap some guy around for three straight minutes or throw a tantrum where she's trashing someone's property and the white knight will stand by doing nothing to stop her. Then the moment someone retaliates the white knight swoops in to her defense because he's just that pussy-whipped that he'll stick up for an asshole if the asshole has a vagina
pussypassdenied,3a7see,Funcuz,58,Thu Jun 18 05:57:40 2015 UTC,"I was born back in the Jurassic where if you kicked a cop you knew a beatdown was in the mail and really just waiting for you to sign for it.   Police brutality ? Well...sort of. I mean, yeah, technically. On the other hand cops aren't robots and still have human reactions. What about dumb-criminal-brutality ? Whatever happened to that ? Back when I was born it was just sort of common sense but today apparently we've de-educated people to the point that they actually think they're allowed to provoke cops and even strike them.  I'm not defending a cop kicking a handcuffed individual. I still think he was right by all natural justice."
pussypassdenied,3a7see,3randy3lue,8,Thu Jun 18 01:22:40 2015 UTC,"I disagree. She kicked at his legs with her bare feet from a sitting position while handcuffed, which clearly did not hurt him.

This guy turned from lawful to unlawful and thus, is a criminal and should be treated as one. The police is protected from legal consequences when they have to use force to do their job in some situations, but only if the force used meets the danger they were facing. A cuffed person, sitting on the ground barefoot, no matter if male or female, that tries to kick you, is a danger, but none that you need to subdue with a kick to the head. A simple step back would have been enough. Retaliation is not a cops job. Retaliation is not the laws purpose. And he needs to uphold the law while on the job and wearing uniform, what he does in his free time is completely different."
pussypassdenied,3a7see,TerryAndYourWife,1 point,Thu Jun 18 11:16:32 2015 UTC,"There is no context to this gif. Meaning anything could've happened prior. She may have fought, kicked, punched etc. being arrested. But then again the cop could have been overly forceful and arrest her for a shitty reason, causing her to kick out. But from what we see, it's a person handcuffed while an officer is writing out a report of the situation. He doesn't provoke her to kick him. When anyone, even an officer is being hit, they are allowed to retaliate in equal action, meaning if he were to pull out a taser or bat and start beating the shit out of her, it would definitely be police brutality. She kicked him, he kicked her back. I wouldn't expect anything less or anything more than exactly what happened."
pussypassdenied,3a7see,ThrowArtAtGoats,1 point,Thu Jun 18 22:51:21 2015 UTC,"In my country, resisting arrest (without harming anyone) and prison break (again, not harming other people) are not illegal. The legal argument behind it is, that the will to be free is so strong, any human will fight to keep their freedom.  An intoxicated person will probably lash out, and as a police officer, you need to be prepared for an arrested person to fight for their freedom. What you are allowed to do, legally and morally, is to use just enough force to regain control over the situation and prevent any harm being done to you or any other person involved, but no more than that. In this situation, stepping back or putting her in a car would have sufficed. Off the job, whatever you do is your thing, but as a police officer acting in the function of a police officer, you do not get to act unlawful. No matter what happened, retaliation is not a cops job, and it is not the laws purpose. Laws are made to prevent harm being done to the rest of society, nothing more, nothing less.   And even if he retaliated, a kick in the shin does not equal a kick in the head. One hurts, gives you a bruise for a few days and is annoying, the other knocks you unconscious, gives you a concussion and is possibly (and not unlikely) life threatening. If he pushed her away with his foot while making sue she is not going to hit her head, fine. But he kicked her in the head, which can have really (really really really really) severe consequences. This is excessive force, and the guy is on a power trip. It is disgusting, and he should never be able to ever work in a position where he has that much responsibility, because clearly, he doesn't honor it."
pussypassdenied,3a7see,TerryAndYourWife,1 point,Fri Jun 19 00:24:07 2015 UTC,"In my country, and most, resisting arrest is illegal and you will be punished for it. As is an attempted prison break. And I agree completely with both rules. I for one respect police officers and would never in my right mind even think about kicking one. I think this woman is very lucky the cop DIDN'T use excessive force to apprehend her such as a taser, which is more than likely what a male would have got in that situation.   I don't agree with police brutality, I'm totally against it. This however is justified. Nobody has the right to assault an officer, and no officer should go to work scared to use necessary force to protect themselves."
pussypassdenied,3a7see,ThrowArtAtGoats,1 point,Fri Jun 19 08:56:24 2015 UTC,"Police officers need to honor human life. Their sole purpose is to protect society and uphold the law. Society includes criminals. Society includes a lashing out cunt that got shitfaced and peed her own pants. They are there to protect everyone. They do not get to retaliate, they do not get to throw a temper tantrum, they do not EVER get to break any law. Necessary force, by definition, means just enough to regain control and prevent harm. This was excessive. This is never justifiable, neither morally nor legally, no matter if the person cuffed is male or female. This police officer risked KILLING this person in his custody, that he was responsible for at that time. He risked KILLING someone that has been arrested for being drunk. Not a child molester, a shop lifter, a burglar, a robber. This was a drunk. Not a danger to society that needs to be eliminated. He had many other choices of how to control the situation. This, what he did, should have been a last resort, but instead, he made it his first response. Retaliation is childish, immature and solves nothing. You don't get to hurt people cause they hurt you. And you don't get to kick anyone in the head with steel toed boots and not face the consequences."

Thing is I've noticed that in these very rare instances of this subreddit, people automatically go on auto pilot and blame the woman for being in the wrong and using her PP. This article clearly shows it's not the case, and it's just a matter of a police overreacting over a drunk PERSON (not male, not female, person, cause it's fucking irrelevant). The thing I fear right now is that a tendency to auto-blame the woman without actually understanding what's going on is spreading slowly through some people in this subreddit. Some people, not all. Do you know what that tendency reminds me of? Feminists. Yes, that's right, some of you are becoming fucking hypocrits and becoming the movement you despise."
pussypassdenied,3a7see,depakoitvs,2,Thu Jun 18 04:15:06 2015 UTC,"Kind of agree. But if it was a man he would probably get beaten or worse. You don't just kick a cop, or anyone, to be honest. Jumping to conclusions: I bet she was used to do that to other men, like boyfriend or whatnot, but she didn't realise that not every person on earth is there to stand for that crap. In other words: you don't just kick strangers."

All he has to do, is step back a few feet and ignore her. Instead he kicks her in the head, seemingly knocking her out. For all we know, she might have died. What then?   This subreddit is supposed to be about justice and justice is blind. Facts are that a sitting cuffed person is kicking at an officers legs. The officer retaliates with a kick to the head.   I don't think you could get that of as self defense. It's just two pissed off people kicking at each others, where one kicks the other with a potentially fatal blow to the head."

pussypassdenied,3a7see,MahSelectah,2,Thu Jun 18 02:51:59 2015 UTC,"So, if she kicks him in the balls or kicks his knee and he tears a ligament, it's ok? You should never kick someone when you are down.  I'm not sure if I agree or disagree with what the officer did. No story link, so maybe she killed someone, like another police officer. Maybe she was resisting arrest which make everyone, even trained personnel like police, more hostile and the clear assault on an officer was just more than that individual was willing to put up with from her.  What would you have done if you had maybe worked doubles for the last 6 months to make ends meet, you respond to a call, struggle to subdue the perpetrator of some crime, and she kicks at your balls? At what point would you break? We all have breaking points, we all only put up with so much until we have had enough. Maybe this officer just hit his. When would you have hit yours in this situation?   Also, story link anyone?"
pussypassdenied,3a7see,Fallen_Angle,-5,Thu Jun 18 03:08:58 2015 UTC,"No. She is obviously in trouble and decides to kick a COP. She got what she deserved. And it breaks down like this. Had she NOT kicked the cop, she would not have been kicked in the head. No sympathy for a shitty idea. Fuck her."

pussypassdenied,3a7see,MahSelectah,2,Thu Jun 18 02:42:16 2015 UTC,Even between two citizens the one kicking a freely standing person in most jurisdictions commits lesser offence than the one retaliating by kicking a restrained person instead of stepping away (and calling the police if he wants to press charges for kicking him in a leg likely with no actual harm).

While it seems like the same thing that happened with Digg/Reddit, the big difference imo is that Voat is copy/pasting reddit almost to a T, where reddit at least tried doing something a little different than Digg.

pussypassdenied,3a5svz,GrizzWintoSupreme,-3,Fri Jun 19 03:19:57 2015 UTC,"Ding ding ding. And also think about this:  On the off chance this new site takes off, and Reddit 2 or Voat or whatever gets popular, what do people think is going to happen when that site starts making money?  Spoiler alert: FPH gets banned from there too. Why? Because they are going to nuke them so they dont harass the many more folks there that are normal, decent people. AKA a bigger part of their future cash flow. Bigger than FPH anyway.  Welcome to websites that turn profit. The undesirables get weeded out to maximize cash flow, which starts with them not letting people (FPH) push a large user-base (overweight people who own a computer) from their site by harassing them. This means that they will ban FPH there to cater as well.  And for good reason. It's not just a win that nets money for Voat when they ban FPH like Reddit, it's a win because they get rid of shitty people as well. It's probably true that the only reason they are accepting of them now is because it looks like Voats best chance to get the ball rolling with their site. Come to think, could Reddit sue them for intellectual property theft? Because Voat looks IDENTICAL to Reddit."

If exceptions are open in cases such as this, suddenly you'll have actual rapists saying that what they did was consensual and that their victims are lying when they say otherwise. How would you be able to ascertain who's right or wrong without either hard coded evidence or mindreading? Protip: You can't.  The adult age is a standard, a consensus, based both on average physical and mental growth. We have a whole life on this Earth.

And I think any 15 year old girl wpuld have sex with Johnny depp (or whatever male they idolize). I think it is a complicated issue though because sometimes it is entirely consensual (they want to have sex with each other) but sometimes the younger party can't make a good decision foe themself. Imagine a teen girl having sex with a older gang member because she ""loved him""  once she got older she would realize she was too young to make the right choice for herself. The statutory rape law is to prevent minors in those sorts of situations but as a consequence it can prevent a minor and a older person from having consensual sex even if they are both physically and mentally mature enough for it."
pussypassdenied,3a4oiv,sw1ff,-2,Wed Jun 17 18:21:52 2015 UTC,Yes I agree but at 15 I would have been able to make the proper decision and said I would love to bang this milf.

pussypassdenied,3a4oiv,sockmess,2,Wed Jun 17 18:28:17 2015 UTC,The law can have an extremely hard time determining if someone is mentally able to make a decision. What if the boy were 13? 10? 5? 2? When would you say he couldn't make a good decision for himself? Where do we draw the line? The line for the law depends on state but is usually 17 or 18 because we assume that almost everyone can make their own decisions by that point.

Someone is ""sick"" if they want to fuck a 17 year old, but suddenly she is ""prime meat"" when she turns 18? Give me a fucking break.

How do gender roles contribute to whether a child would get ""messed up"" by it or not? The psychological effects of sex on children are independent of their gender and only a function of their age and some less significant circumstantial factors. If you think circumstances (not including their gender roles but maybe their gender) such as their maturity are something that have to be considered then just say that but don't claim all this stuff about feeling the same if the genders were reversed.

""Hes lucky"", ""What is he gay?"", ""What a poor kid it must have been such a horrific experience!"" Honestly would you think the same if this was a 50 year old pedophile going to some girls house he met on the internet and having sex with a 15 year old? What if it was your daughter? What if it was your son?  A 15 year old is still in cognitive development and will have trouble determining right from wrong. They may enjoy throwing rocks at cars but is it morally right or wrong? Its obviously wrong but they do it anyway because they have trouble differentiating between the two. This is why in the laws of the eye a child under the age of 18 ( in the united states) may not give legal consent to sex even if they want to it is considered statuary rape for a reason because you are deemed as taking advantage of a child.  As an adult you are given more responsibilities, not fucking children is one of them. You are an adult you know better than a child you know whats wrong and what is right, children are still growing up and learning. It is your responsibility to allow a child to grow up in an environment that won't corrupt them. As an adult you know that you are not suppose to be having sex with children. You know you are breaking the law, so why shouldn't you be held accountable? Because you are a woman? Because you are only slightly older than that person?  Yes different people develop faster than others but people can also develop slower than others. You are in no place to decide if a child can give consent or not. You do not decide that the law does and it does for a good reason.  Looking at these comments makes me depressed, I just hope all of you people who trivialize rape know you are the reason why rape victims aren't taken more seriously.  Edit: I'd just like to say this is the reason why sex can be considered rape as well while drunk/on drugs since you're judgement is impaired you cannot legally give consent. Just like a person who is not mentally fit. Think of children like drunk adults on shrooms. They may seem like they know what they're doing but they haven't gotten the slightest idea in reality. This isn't some sort of fairy tale. You people honestly make me fucking sick to my stomach. Is this ignorance or just plane and fucking simple arrogance? I'll try to stay off my high horse but some of you really need to get your head out of the clouds and re-evaluate your life.

pussypassdenied,3a0s5e,TheFrenchNinja,59,Wed Jul 1 13:58:53 2015 UTC,"That's not what happened here, though. She received 30 days in jail as a result of something called ""criminal contempt of court,"" which was proportionate to the offense she made to the court.  However, there's more to the story that this video doesn't talk about.  In short:    A young adult was arrested for drug charges. That young adult ended up getting herself in more trouble by showing up to a hearing under the influence of alcohol and xanax (which is why her attitude was so flippant) That judge held her in contempt and, upon her coming down off the xanax/alcohol and realizing the extent of her predicament, apologized for her conduct The judge, within his discretion, accepted her apology under the circumstances and vacated her 30 day sentence.   Most importantly, as part of the larger package here, the girl was put into a drug rehabilitation program, which she successfully finished, maintained sobriety, and got a job.  In other words, what you see here is a reasonable judge attempting to rehabilitate a youth in a way that, as it would turn out, was appropriate and best not only for the individual in question, but for society as a whole.   It's fantastic that this judge was willing to bring the hammer down on such disrespectful conduct... but it is also as valuable to have a judge that can see the big picture."

pussypassdenied,39yki8,sandmann68,33,Mon Jun 15 23:21:49 2015 UTC,"I think thats one of the biggest issues here. More so than simply ""man stronger than woman"". For the most part boys learn early, through fighting or rough housing, that there is always someone stronger than you out there. It helps most guys with the the decision making process when it comes to physical altercations.   Sure, im pissed. Yeah that guy said something that offended me. Im really upset about it. He's big. Much bigger than me. I probably should let this one go and just cool off.   There's always gonna be a situation where a smaller guy might have to defend himself against a bigger guy and thats okay. But this girl literally didn't understand what could happen to her if she took it beyond yelling in his face because shes never actually been manhandled before. Its a hard lesson to learn but she learned it this day."
pussypassdenied,39yki8,whotookmysammich,20,Mon Jun 15 21:26:19 2015 UTC,"Or, she's just been told by society that men shouldn't hit women, so she felt like she could slap a guy and yell ""Hit me!"" without any consequences."
pussypassdenied,39yki8,wibblywobblychilango,18,Mon Jun 15 21:46:13 2015 UTC,"I think its an unhealthy mix of both. She's probably the ""baddest"" among her group of girlfriends too so she has an elevated adolescent invincibility complex to start with. I take the risk and assume that by her obvious over-confidence and loud/aggressive demeanor throughout the altercation (even in the presence of the ""authority"" of the teacher). Being on the losing end of a good old fashion ass-kicking is a really sobering experience, that if you're lucky enough, you learn early and not too painfully. She looked like she had absolutely no concept of the consequences of being out-classed by such a large margin. The look on her face for the quick half second when she's getting up off the floor said it all. She just had the foundation of her entire world shook, I hope she carries that with her. Sadly though, I strongly doubt that it'll stay for very long in this modern culture of excuses and cop-outs, unless of course she maybe get's a few more wake-up calls. Serious props to the guy though for keeping it together and for all intents and purposes finishing the fight without (what looks to be) inflicting serious injury to her. That's a very mature thing on his part to recognize that he could literally tear her apart and then to choose a move that still shocks her and humbles her bravado."

Of course I'm not going to harass anyone for their lifestyle decisions, however nowadays society expects more from me, they expect me to actively be happy and say well done, and say stuff like ""i'm proud of her"" etc. Which I was stating that I'm not okay with, the same way I wouldn't say to Michael Jackson or Pamela anderson, ""well done, i'm so proud of you"", but i wouldn't harass her either for him or her for their personal actions.

I was initially a bit confused, and a little taken back that some random person wanted to give me something so precious.   Being the ignorant American that I am, I attempted to try and understand his broken English and maintain a level of kindness until, out of nowhere, comes by brother. He basically smacks the ring out of my hands and points his finger in the gypsy's face and screams ""NO, NO!""  After leading me away he explains to me that he read (on reddit) that this is a typical gypsy practice to try and swindle shit from tourists. I'm glad he educated me right there as I spent the rest of my time in Paris with my hands in my pocket, secretly hoping some little gypsy kid would try me so I could practice my round house kicks.   TL;DR: My brother learned how to avoid gypsy bullshit and prevented a potential swindling. That's what also got me to join reddit."

Women are (unconsciously) looking for someone who can look after their children. This is because, in the past, women who chose such people had more healthy offspring who carried the ""look for guy with lots of stuff"" gene. More-or-less.  Money being a ""social construct"" (whatever that means) is irrelevant; it's what it represents that matters.  While I'm at it, ""attractiveness"" itself is pretty arbitrary; after all, it tends to be only members of one's own species that we're attracted to.

After she bit his arm they should have maced or tazered her and that would have been the end of it. In america they probably would have just lit the car up."
pussypassdenied,39ovke,GloriousGardener,2,Sun Jun 14 21:03:22 2015 UTC,"Youre so knowledgeable, you should join your local police force and teach them use of force. Clearly these trained and experienced officers are worse at their job than you."
pussypassdenied,39ovke,ItsOnlyTheTruth,-9,Thu Jun 18 02:22:42 2015 UTC,"Good point. I guess that's why I already did that. And they are trained to use force properly, they just fail to do so in this situation, likely out of fear of being fired or disciplined for political reasons when the video goes viral due to the hundreds of people filming. Although reasonable from their personal perspectives, this lack of force actually puts themselves and others at risk. As per any use of force training you might have done/will do, you should know that delaying use of force (especially something non lethal) can cause a situation to escalate, possibly resulting in injury or death to the officers, the bystanders, or the aggressor/s themselves. Any time you leave a suspect to actively resist is time they can use to arm themselves or maneuver themselves into a position to do harm. In this situation, she could have produced a knife or other weapon and used that against the officers, or simply used a second key to start the car and drive through 74 people. In the latter case, the police would be slammed (and likely fired) for their lack of force and failure to prevent the situation when they very easily could have. Which is exactly why they are trained not fuck around in this situation, and harshly disable/restrain the suspect/s as soon as possible. Its a risk assessment policy formed by people who look at the overall statistics and principals involved, and although tasing her off the bat might seem harsh, in the long run its certainly the right thing to do in these sorts of cases. Yes, some people might be tazered or pepper sprayed who didn't absolutely need to be, but over 100 cases, 97 people being potentially needlessly pepper sprayed who are resisting arrest is a lot better then 6 officers shot or 20 people run over. Is that all?   E: I appreciate the downvotes absent commenting. Thank you for informing me as to my errors in logic."
pussypassdenied,39ovke,GloriousGardener,1 point,Thu Jun 18 02:39:03 2015 UTC,"Ignoring the fact that there were other people in the car who would of been wrongfully sprayed. Pepper spray stays in the air, so spraying it in a car that you are actively trying to get someone out of means you have to be subjected to the effects of pepper spray, so no go there.   Using a taser on someone you can't currently get to is an even bigger gamble. If that person goes into shock and you can't get them help because they're locked inside, game over man. On top of that if you taser them and can't get to them they'll eventually come to and it really won't matter.   If the person doesn't show an immediate threat to the officer or others you can't just taser them. That's why we have passive resistant and active resistant on the use of force spectrum."

This lady was just sitting in a car seat with no keys, so she doesn't meet the criteria for escalation of use of force. You said they should taser her because she could pull a knife. Anyone in the whole fucking world could pull a knife at any time, but we don't taser everyone we see."

The ""pussy pass"" doesn't imply that a woman has to say ""I have a vagina, so you need to give me a pass."" There are actions that people do as a result of their assumed right to do so.   If you have a problem with a post or reply, send us a message and if warranted, we will gladly take care of it. Well, at least I will. The creator of this sub, /u/Mustaka is a pile of shit and probably would downvote you. I'll make up for it though and at least even things out.  Edit: after watching the vid, I don't feel that removing it will do anything worthwhile since it has been up for 6 days already and toes the line of 'women feeling like because they're women they can do what they want to' which is my personal interpretation of PPD, so it will remain. If you have issues with posts in the future please send us mods a message and we will take a look it."

Most of the time this is the subtext of her actions. When a woman punches a man who is much larger and/or stronger than her, she typically expects to not get hit back because she is a woman.

It sounds like it's very much her word against her sister and nephew's still. Court case was dismissed because (allegedly) sister and nephew wouldn't make themselves available for court ordered interview by the defense. Granted, she was intoxicated at the time and she's clearly an entitled twat (telling the officer her necklace is worth more than his yearly salary) so things don't look good for her side. Still though, did I miss something? Is it typical to suspend an athlete in cases like these, where they've clearly been part of a domestic abuse situation, but fault has not been laid at either party's feet?"

He gets free reign for the most part and get's away with it. I swear he's got to have dirt on the President of Disney sometimes.

But what she did, if a man did to a woman, would be considered assault. And she was always like that. If it wasn't with me it would be with the nearest guy around. Always.

pussypassdenied,399glp,NomChecksOut,4,Wed Jun 10 12:55:08 2015 UTC,"Let's be honest here, when this movement started women were absolutely lower than men, with men really having no need for a movement campaigning for their rights as they had them all anyway. The group started with good intentions and was appropriately named Feminism as it consisted mostly of women and campaigning for the equality of women to men, as women were definitely the second class. Nowadays, as women have pretty much every right across the board same as men, the movement has changed to try and remove gender roles, stereotypes and to put an end to societal views on gender. This means that it is harder to pinpoint a common goal in the movement. Before, they had rules, rights and laws written down and could easily see equality needed. Now there are no written laws for gender stereotypes or roles, they just sort of happen. This causes a bit of a problem pinpointing what exactly is to be done and what exactly the goal is, causing misinterpretation of what feminism is amongst many of its followers."

Now it's all ""I don't eat gluten, it made me feel fat and lazy and tired when I ate it and now I don't eat it any more I feel energized"". It's always the same thing. They don't research what they get into besides what diet some famous person is on, and it's like a doctor giving you a pill and saying ""this will cure what you have"". You take it, thinking it's the cure for your disease, but in reality it's a fucking sugar pill and your doctor just placebo-d you.  It's just a fad diet that's new and hip and in and everybody ""feels  better"" while they're on it, because they believe bullshit the media espouses.  I'm just some bitter 22 year old dude though.

It sounds silly to me that simple human nature would be labeled as 'rape culture'.  What would happen if every chick on the street suddenly goes around walking shirtless?

If someone physically forces you to remove your clothes and allow them to sexually touch you, that's rape.   If they drug you and do things to you, that's a rape.  If you have a beer and consent to sex it's not rape.  If you don't report the rape to police that's your own fault, it's not a rape culture conspiracy.

However, Reddit banning a sub because people specifically go there to say mean things violates a lot of people's expectations of Reddit's values and regard for self-moderation (within the law) on subs. A lot of us have enjoyed the idea that there is always somewhere on Reddit a place to say or discuss ANYTHING. But, for me, if the subs are going to start being nerfed to better fit Conde Nast's image of a PC tomorrow it kind of kills the magic of Reddit. It also raises really legitimate concerns about what it means to try to ban an opinion. At what point will actual conversation on any controversial issue become impossible for fear of ""outing"" oneself as having a banned opinion and being booted?  Reddit is still a great and useful site. Just no longer the old friend I knew.  TL;DR- OBESITY IS KILLING AMERICA"

pussypassdenied,396s8r,KirbyMew,19,Tue Jun 9 22:01:46 2015 UTC,"Well, nobody touches them with a ten foot stick. They are massively vocal about everyone being a racist and they have good representation in the form of ombudsmen and countless human right movements and have quite a few won highest court cases on their side. If you dare to speak up against them, you are branded a racist pig for life, it can pretty much end your political career, not to mention your career as a policeman. All in all they are basically untouchable, because they tend to send their underage children to do the most of the stealing (which are basically un-prosecutable), they operate in family gangs (a regular gypsy family is about 4 times the size the normal) - so they really stick together and even if the police finds out one of them did something, they would have a very hard time finding him (no permanent residence) or extraditing him (a hundred roma would be there to help their buddy within seconds). The only way they could possibly do something about them is to catch them right then and there doing it, and even then - considering the gypsies only really deal with petty crime 99% of the time (even if they do massive amounts of it in total), they would face no real trouble.  From our standpoint it just seems mind boggling too, but there's really not much anyone can do. I certainly don't sympathise with neo-nazis, which are about the only group that's publicly opposing them. I don't see this as a racial problem, it's just that I live in Prague and out of the thousands of Roma I have seen, I only ever saw about 5 of them working. Most of them just spend their days going around the town drinking, stealing and scamming people. On top of that, they breed like no tomorrow to get money out of the state (They have a mind-boggling ability to fill out social benefits forms, even though a lot of them are illiterate). I welcome any of them working like everyone else, but that simply doesn't really happen. You can imagine this like a very closed religious society. The families (which Roma put much more significance on than usual it seems), would rather beat you to death / throw you on the street than let you become part of the society. It's like leaving a Mormon church, only the people you're leaving are fucking sociopaths. Even if you were a kid born to this shit and really wanted to get out, they would do their best to pull you back in.  Really, I think there's simply no chance of them ever getting along with the rest of the population anymore. Since the fall of communism around here they have had some 25 years to do so. The Asians get along just fine, the African / African-Americans cause no trouble, the Russians and Ukrainians have more of a tendency to get drunk and are in general a bit more violent, but most of them work and I know a bunch of them who are nice. The Roma are an absolute clusterfuck and need their own planet."
pussypassdenied,396s8r,Rauma,2,Tue Jun 9 22:57:55 2015 UTC,"very interesting, thanks for the reply.  Sounds like a no win at the moment, amazing how the Roma seem to work the scam angle and the benefit at the same time..."
pussypassdenied,396s8r,cobra136,3,Tue Jun 9 23:06:17 2015 UTC,"Yup, right now there's a huge case where someone instructed a real estate office leasing their flat not to consider Roma tenants given their tendency to completely destroy their own homes (They are generally capable of building a fire in the middle of the room and shitting in a bucket in the corner to save on water, so it's very likely every other tenant would hate the guy leasing the flat to them). Well, the declined woman turned to the new Czech Ombudswoman and as far as I can tell right now it looks like both the office and the owner are going to get a massive fine. Yay for free society...  I don't really get how they do it too. I think ~90% of them are illegal immigrants, yet they still get the benefits. They have whole organisations helping them get the most out of the state. Meanwhile, the rest of the country, me included, feels bad to even try to sign up for social security even when we're perfectly eligible to do so (like loosing a job). I'd have to be fucking starving to try that.  It's really not a small problem too, you basically can't walk through the city tourist centre without them trying to scam you at least once, really doesn't give us a good name (even though tourists still seem to love Prague for some reason). Thievery is not THAT common, but I have had about 5 attempted pickpockets in the last 20 years, so it's really not insignificant either. Most of my friends got straight up mugged with a knife at some point in their lives, usually lost a phone or something. Thankfully, the only time one of them managed to steal something from me, it was an empty packet of cigarettes and she spent about half an hour on the tram ride trying to pickpocket it. I let her do it - at least she wasn't stealing anything valuable from someone else. Her expression when she got out and looked inside was priceless and she ended up, I kid you not, running after the tram and screaming at me for it being empty.  Edit: Oh and I somehow managed to leave 5000 CZK ~ 200 USD in a fairly little frequented ATM once. You can bet there were about 6 Roma when I got back 1 minute later and the note was gone. I don't know how they turned up so fast, because they're not that common in my part of town."

pussypassdenied,396s8r,ThisIsWhyIFold,5,Wed Jun 10 02:00:53 2015 UTC,"I don't give them money, ever. There's no reason to be homeless in the UK with the number of charities offering help and the laws surrounding non-voluntary homelessness compelling councils to house people who turn up. Those who have made themselves homeless have routes out of it, so I'll give them food or a hot drink if they want, but cash? Nope.    I remember about 15 years ago sitting fixing a PC (worked in IT support at the time) when two housing officers were discussing a family who had moved into the area that day, they'd turned up and literally demanded social housing, upon checking with the previous council the family lived in it turned out the family had wrecked the house and fled when police turned up, the council they moved to STILL gave them a house.    This wasn't a gypsy family, my point is many groups are doing this, gypsys are typically just the most obvious."

Even from people I would otherwise consider ""good"" in regards to racism, I see them talk about gypsies. Is it really that overwhelming, with respect to how many of them pickpocket/scam/thieve?"
pussypassdenied,396s8r,movings,10,Tue Jun 9 23:04:01 2015 UTC,"European here. It's considered ok because unlike so many other racist stereotypes, the gypsies really are as horrible as you hear. So much so that even the more socially liberal continentals can't stand it."
pussypassdenied,396s8r,PokeChopSandwiches,21,Tue Jun 9 23:47:57 2015 UTC,"It depends, we have two types of gypsies here, Irish/British traveller gypsies who are con artists and scum, inbreed (only marry their cousins) and have bare knuckle fights.   Racism against these types are sorta not welcomed because some can be decent but the accent is easy to spot, it's not quite Irish and it's not quite British, just pikey.  Roma gypos are all thieving scum, they steal the food from your table and just are not trustworthy in every aspect.  Pure scum. Again reason they are hated is because they just come here to Britain and claim taxpayers money as soon as they arrive and send it all home. They beg when they're living very comfortably here and still pickpocket and cheat.   The main reason this is accepted is because it's an actual concern, even the most liberal of person has probably had their pockets picked in the tube and can't defend them"

Over here, even a lot of racist people will say ""No, I only hate niggers, not black people"" or something along those lines. But the racism towards Roma Gypsies, that I've seen at least, is always absolute. I'm not doubting you or questioning your claims."

They are a group that actively lives outside the law and everyone else. They don't socialize in any capacity with outsiders. It's an entire closed society meant to do one thing. Steal and rob from everyone who is not part of the clan.   Would you want to live next to a house full of MS-13 gangsters? Fuck no. Would you avoid interaction with them in the street? Of course.

pussypassdenied,396s8r,walking_the_burbs,1 point,Fri Jun 19 09:49:41 2015 UTC,"Romani people:       The Romani (also spelled Romany; /ˈroʊməni/, /ˈrɒ-/), or Roma, Hindi: रोमानी, are a traditionally itinerant ethnicity living mostly in Europe and the Americas,   and ultimately of Northern Indian (and present-day Pakistan) origin. The Romani are widely known among English-speaking people by the exonym ""Gypsies"" (or Gipsies). Other exonyms are Ashkali and Balkan Egyptians and Sinti.  Romani are dispersed, with their concentrated populations in Europe—especially Central and Eastern Europe and Turkey, Spain and Southern France. They originated in India and arrived in Mid-West Asia, then Europe, around 1,000 years ago,  either separating from the Dom people or, at least, having a similar history;  the ancestors of both the Romani and the Dom left North India sometime between the sixth and eleventh century.   Since the nineteenth century, some Romani have also migrated to the Americas. There are an estimated one million Roma in the United States;  and 800,000 in Brazil, most of whose ancestors emigrated in the nineteenth century from eastern Europe. Brazil also includes some Romani descended from people deported by the government of Portugal during the Inquisition in the colonial era.  In migrations since the late nineteenth century, Romani have also moved to other countries in South America and to Canada.   The Romani language is divided into several dialects, which add up to an estimated number of speakers larger than two million.  The total number of Romani people is at least twice as large (several times as large according to high estimates). Many Romani are native speakers of the language current in their country of residence, or of mixed languages combining the two; those varieties are sometimes called Para-Romani.

Gets out of the car safe and sound at home, and mutters ""thanks"" while looking at the fuckin ground.  Almost this exact scenario happened again a few months later.

pussypassdenied,38y5l9,ryuut,1 point,Sat Jun 20 14:11:15 2015 UTC,"We've had a similar case here in Brazil that I'm pretty sure went nowhere. The woman had cut a biker, putting his life in danger, he got pissed and went to talk to her (I think he was a little heated), not sure what she said but she probably wasn't even considering it to be her fault. So he kicked her car or something like that, or her mirror since she doesn't know how to use it. Then she just proceeds to run over him with her car(??) She couldn't ran away and he wasn't really injured, so he went to her and grabbed her car keys through the car window... and then she activated the pussy pass. ""huuu I was scared!!! And then he came over and tried to get the keys off ignition and... I was scared!!!!!""  Found the video. I'm not sure what was the outcome, but I'm pretty sure nothing happened to her. I do not recommend that you translate the comments on the video. People are just stupid. Oh, the outcome was the pussypass. They decided that it was ""legitimate defense"". The video didn't record it all, the guy started recording after."
pussypassdenied,38y5l9,depakoitvs,-9,Mon Jun 8 18:44:00 2015 UTC,He put his own life in danger by kicking her car. You can't just threaten someone like that and not expect them to react.
pussypassdenied,38y5l9,hashbown,3,Mon Jun 8 19:47:29 2015 UTC,"Nope. A kick in a car is far away from being ran over. Besides, she had cut him off before (before the video started, if you understand portuguese you can find this out). So his life was put in danger BEFORE. And a kick in a car doesn't justify a murder attempt. You are just blind if you don't see it. Damage to property (although that kick clearly didn't do shit to the car) is nothing compared to damage to life/his physical health. If he followed your logic he should've just beaten the crap out of her, since by cutting him off  she was putting his life at risk, thus putting her own life at risk because apparently he would have gained the right to try to kill her. God, she even drove about 15~20m with him on the car. That's just ridiculous."
pussypassdenied,38y5l9,depakoitvs,-6,Mon Jun 8 20:41:40 2015 UTC,"There's ways to deal with driving mistakes than violence and aggression. Kicking a car is not the way to deal with a driving mistake.

pussypassdenied,38y5l9,hashbown,3,Mon Jun 8 21:00:55 2015 UTC,"Do you even see the irony of your comment? He kicked her car. She tried to run over him. Do you see the difference? ""She made a mistake, he made a violent threat"". Did you watch the same video I posted? That driving mistake could've killed him. He was upset, then she tries to RUN OVER him NOT BY MISTAKE. The only life threat in the video was she trying to run over a person, hitting him and other cars and then carrying him over for a little more than 10m. Not a fucking kick on a car. Geez, what a threat."
pussypassdenied,38y5l9,depakoitvs,-5,Mon Jun 8 21:03:59 2015 UTC,Okay so from now on anytime someone makes a driving mistake it's okay to get out of your car and stomp on there's. Great idea buddy

She never hit the brakes to avoid hitting that motorcycle had the direction been locked up. She was driving, she wasn't drunk or high and she ran someone which she knew was there, broad day light, right in front of her.  Heck she even threatened someone else about doing so. That in itself isn't proof in this case but it sure shows having thought of using a car to do bodily harm.  Some people should not be driving.  Lock her up, toss the keys."

She could basically blame any motorcyclist for it, there is no proof.  And the fact, like you mentioned, that she already threatened someone that she'd do the same exact thing... how really retarded can she be to think it wouldn't come out!  But to me, what's the worst, is the lawyer statement. I hate those lawyers: My client is not guilty of anything except being a too good human person. Wtf.

Also the fact that everyone declares her a victim, that she's a good human person and not the cold blooded murdered she really is is in itself a pussy pass. Do you know of a single instance where a man clearly killed someone else and they said: Oh no it must have been an accident, it's such a good person! There is witness... but they just saw wrong, it's impossible for that man to be like that! No that's something reserved to woman, therefore pussy pass. Even his lawyer is outright lying:   Jackson’s lawyer Stephen Cline said the young mother accidentally hit Mr Buob as she tried to get his licence plate number and appealing for him to pull over after he struck her car.   As a lawyer he should know he's not allowed to give a verdict. If it was a man I could guarantee you it would had been ''no comment''. But the lawyer is using the pussy pass to tend to the emotional slack we give to woman. Heck even her mother says how she wasn't given a chance to explain herself: Bitch that's why she's in court and not in jail! She IS given a chance right the fuck now.    This screams pussy pass so bad...  (Edit: No to do like the lawyer, I'm not saying she voluntarily killed the man but she DID kill him. Whether it's an accident or voluntarily doesn't change much to the fact she did kill someone and it's just normal for it to be treated like it should: As a potential murder)"

pussypassdenied,38y5l9,lookingoverthefence,21,Sun Jun 7 21:21:05 2015 UTC,"Attorney here. Murder in the U.S., as well as California, is defined as the unlawful killing of a human being with malice aforethought. Murder is reduced to voluntary manslaughter if it wasn't committed with intent to kill, intent to inflict great bodily injury, reckless indifference to an unjustifiably high risk to human life. Intentional use of a deadly weapon authorizes a permissive inference of intent to kill. While it may be reduced to manslaughter at trial, as it's the job of the fact finder (jury) to determine if she has intent, she was properly charged with murder.   Edit: grammar"
pussypassdenied,38y5l9,TheLastHonestMan,6,Sun Jun 7 21:49:26 2015 UTC,As a layperson I gotta say: thanks for chiming in. Can character records be used to imply a trend that the intent would most likely have been to intimidate?
pussypassdenied,38y5l9,lookingoverthefence,10,Sun Jun 7 21:58:04 2015 UTC,"Absolutely. Her bail being set at $1M probably reflects, at least to a degree, her character stemming from her prior legal troubles. But at trial the prosecution will certainly attack her character in ways that the evidence code allows. Such as propensity evidence."
pussypassdenied,38y5l9,HRzNightmare,13,Sun Jun 7 22:01:05 2015 UTC,"I'd say that it's generally murder when you chase someone with your car with intention of running then over,  however usually the folks who kill with their car get off much lighter. Shoot someone and get 30 years to life. Intentionally run them over,  and bakcking over them to make sure it's done? 6 years."
pussypassdenied,38y5l9,TheLastHonestMan,-6,Sun Jun 7 21:33:07 2015 UTC,I don't know the whole story but accidentally killing somebody when your intent is to terrorize (and it seems to me that with her this is a pattern) does not fit the definition of murder so neatly. So it's not worth a lot but my gut says manslaughter.
pussypassdenied,38y5l9,Pavl_,5,Sun Jun 7 21:37:33 2015 UTC,"Terrorizing someone is not hitting them with your car. Terrorizing them would be threatening them and chasing them along the road, acting as if you were going to hit them with your car, swerving etc."
pussypassdenied,38y5l9,asaasa1983,2,Mon Jun 8 00:15:35 2015 UTC,"But your gut forgot she already threatened someone else with running them over. This WILL be used as a proof she already knew she could easily kill someone with her car. It's a proof she knew she was using a lethal weapon and it's not just a freak accident.  On top of all the other reasons, future repercussions for your actions, is another good reason to never make death threats to people!"
pussypassdenied,38y5l9,TheLastHonestMan,1 point,Mon Jun 8 11:07:45 2015 UTC,"No, I'm saying her habit of intimidating people with lethal threats reinforces the notion that it may more likely have been an accident (manslaughter, not murder) After all, you can't run around scaring people to get what you want or inflate your ego if you're in prison for murder. Do you know if she has anything on her record indicating any actual physical crimes? Remember crazy bitches deserve proper justice also (and maybe some court-ordered therapy)"

pussypassdenied,38y5l9,Decyde,2,Mon Jun 8 02:12:51 2015 UTC,"True, it does depend on the state.  I know Zimmerman was on trial for murder and manslaughter and the jury found him not guilty."
pussypassdenied,38y5l9,lookingoverthefence,2,Mon Jun 8 02:19:14 2015 UTC,"Yes you are correct. Defendants are often charged with the larger crime, as in this case murder, if the prosecution has a chance of obtaining a conviction on the charge. The facts here may be able to get a conviction for murder or a conviction for manslaughter could eventually be the charge they find her guilty for. If she was only charged with the lesser crime, there's always the chance that she wouldn't be convicted at all and would be immune from further prosecution on the case due to double jeopardy. That's why it's often seen in this country that a larger crime is first charged."

He's fighting a termination of parental rights because he got in a huge car accident two years ago, had a TBI, had to go through extensive therapy, etc. Before that time, they just had an agreement of ""come see your son whenever you want"", and were civil, but right after the accident, she took off and didn't give her any of his contact info. Disappeared.  A few months ago he found her and she said ""Oh yeah, let's meet at X and I'll let you spend time with him."" Never showed up, never called, completely ignored all attempts to be contacted. Soon after, he got the notice of intention to terminate his parental rights because he's been ""completely absent, both physically and financially, for over two years"". She got a temporary order that he can't see his son until this is all over (somehow), and is trying literally everything she can to keep his kid from him.  This guy is seriously one of the best people I've ever met. Even though he and I disagree on a lot of fundamental issues, he's still one of the most respectful, helpful, and selfless people I know. He deserves to see his kid.   But so far, the judge seems to be on her side. She makes 3x as much as he does, so she can afford a high end lawyer, while he was representing himself.  This whole situation has just pissed me off so bad. My dad walked into court during custody hearing and said ""give them to her, I don't fucking care"", and I haven't seen him since that day 16 years ago, so to have someone fighting for their kids and the mom trying to keep them away, I'm just disgusted."

pussypassdenied,38r54z,nauree,33,Sat Jun 6 08:23:23 2015 UTC,"All right. These kinds of cases always fascinate me, because the age of consent in Denmark, where I'm from, is 15. There is - however - a stipulation stating that the age of consent is 18 if the elder is a teacher or some other authoritative figure, so she would probably still be convicted in Denmark. Calling her a sexual offender just seems so ... subjective, to me."

We all know that men and women are going through a confusing time in their teens. They don't understand appropriate boundaries, and people abuse this to exploit them for sex.  That's why we have no problem with two 15 year olds fucking. They can have sex all they like. Those laws get weird when people are 19 dating someone only 4 years younger than they are, and I admit can be a tad overzealous.  But a 35 year old woman? No, that's rape."

Setting aside the fact that she was in a position of trust and authority over him for a second, she is also 20 years older than he is. The difference in maturity levels between the two creates an inherent power imbalance in her favour. He isn't even classified as an adult yet, so she has that perceived authority over him as well.   While a 15 year old is physically capable of engaging is sexual activity, they simply do not have the emotional maturity to appreciate the consequences of their actions in a way even remotely similar to that of an adult.   In all honesty, if I had a teacher like that when I was 15, I would have jumped on that ass too. I was a horny teenager full of raging hormones. That said, I recognize now as an adult, that doing so would have been a horrible mistake and I am infinitely grateful that my first sexual encounter was with a person my own age or close enough to it not to matter."

It's so insane to me that they have to be in a public register for the rest of their lives. What's the point of a prison system if its only purpose is punishment and not rehabilitation? One of the guys in the park had chatted with an undercover police officer claiming to be a 30-year old woman, who said she would have sex with him if he would also have sex with her 14-year old daughter. He said yes, and for that he got a year in prison and has to be a registered sex offender for the rest of his life."

Never mind the fact that most of these chats are intended for adults and prohibit the presence of minors on them, logic be damned. Combine that with the lack of mercy juries often show to people facing these charges (If they're male though. I would say that female offenders have a lower conviction rate, but to be frank after 30 minutes of searching I couldn't find any inquiries into the issue, meaning that simply people aren't bothering to make statistics out of this, therefore I do not have any evidence to back up these claims) and you'll get with a higher than average conviction rate of these crimes compared with offences that carry similar jail terms."

And all of a sudden it's ""rape?"" As if the kid is unable to speak, and his thoughts don't matter? It's not like she scoped out a park, found an 8 year old who just scraped his knee or something, and manipulated/groomed him into having sex. Gross? Yes, as he should be ""doing the sex thing"" with a girl his age, and awkwardly figuring it out himself. Rape? If consent was given, by definition it isn't."

Maybe she thought she could get away with it because of her pussy, but maybe she thought she could get away with it because she's white, or because she thought her community would also be racist enough to get away with her.

In contrast, transmission of hepatitis B virus through saliva has been well documented(...)  Source: http://infectiousdiseases.about.com/od/respiratoryinfections/a/kissing.htm  Influenza and common cold are also mostly transmitted from saliva.   Also for assault you need to cause injury (or show there is a high enough risk of injury/harm) not permanent injury! Oh I stabbed him 25 times but he has fully healed since then, this is not assault, the injuries are not permanent you see."

pussypassdenied,38n0fp,RogerShakenbak,0,Fri Jun 5 12:16:35 2015 UTC,You're the exception because you just had surgery. People marry people with HIV and can successfully avoid ever getting it.

pussypassdenied,38n0fp,sethboy66,1 point,Fri Jun 5 13:50:40 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't say exception, more condition. It's a conditional factor in the equation. If blood exists in saliva, then saliva is able to carry the blood and its contents.  You don't have to have just had wisdom teeth out for your mouth to bleed. There are plenty of conditional variables that would produce the same result that mine has.  The fact remains that HIV can be transmitted through blood, and saliva can carry blood, so when the conditions exist for HIV contaminated blood to be carried by saliva, party A can spit on party B, and risk infecting them if they have an open wound or other immediate avenue to party B's blood."

The other 2 were soped perfectly sideways at the beginning of an onramp at almost 1am, on black bikes, with their headlights facing away from me.  They passed the mall entrance to get to the hooters and were waiting for their 2 buddies to go over the curb.  Had the just driven another 50 yards they would have been able to take another entrance into the mall.

Take that amount, divide it in half (because the father would have paid half), and that's what her four years is worth. Number A.  Now, add up all the mortgage costs, car costs, child costs, food costs, insurance costs, etc., and cut that figure in half. That's the wife's responsibility. Number B.  Now, add up all the money the wife has spent on herself in the last four years. Number C.  Add up numbers B and C, and subtract it from Number A. The large negative amount you are left with is the actual monetary burden the wife has bestowed on her husband. That is how much money he would have been able to spend on himself or save, had she not made the selfish choice of not working (in essence taking a multi-year paid vacation so she can be with her children).  ""But wait"", someone says, ""what about the $600,000 she would have made? She lost that money!"" No, she gave it up. She knew what it would cost to hire someone to take care of her kids. In essence, she gave up her job as a (whatever she was doing that made her $150K per year after tax) to become a housekeeper and nanny.

You can't lose money you didn't earn yet or save money you couldn't spend.    It isn't even a ""sacrifice"".  A sacrifice is giving up one need for another.  It sounds like they are swimming in money compared to most people, so to say she gave up potential money is a stretch.  Also, just because someone has the potential to earn money at a certain rate, does not mean they are worth that for every task."

pussypassdenied,38fj91,Vinterblad,33,Thu Jun 4 09:47:54 2015 UTC,"It really is the go to fallacy for feminists these days.  I love pointing it out when they use it.    I read a comment a while back from a redditor that was extremely on point that went something like:  ""If as a feminist you ever find yourself having to constantly differentiate yourself from all the nazi feminists maybe its time to find a group that isn't so flooded with nazis."""
pussypassdenied,38fj91,bizzybone78,-38,Thu Jun 4 00:21:11 2015 UTC,"Not really. There's an offshoot of feminism now referred to as neofeminism, and it differs greatly from the egalitarian Feminist movement of the 60’s and earlier.  It's more about pushing a female agenda, and has nothing really to do about equality for women.  Edit: there seems to be some confusion, perhaps due to the unusually weak wiki article. Neofeminism does not share the same goals of Feminism.  Neofeminism is focused on female empowerment regardless of anything else, and frequently at the expense of others, especially men. Neofeminists are, likewise, often also misandrists, and proudly so. It continues on in this direction..."
pussypassdenied,38fj91,kingofdon,50,Thu Jun 4 04:44:14 2015 UTC,"The Feminist movement of the 60s succeeded in all its goals. There exists no legal right that men have which women do not. On the contrary, women have more. Please, educate me on the current goals of the feminism to which you subscribe. To my eyes, it appears to be a sexist movement with the primary goal of gaining the (state-mandated) upper hand in all areas of life, as a sort of restitution for perceived past slights."

If you want to change the title of a movement you have to make the members of that movement change it. Until then they have the same right to define what feminism is as you have.

""I made my husband's dreams possible. His ability to ""have it all"" is built on the back of my sacrifice.""   Really ? YOU made his dreams possible ? You sure you BOTH didn't AGREE on what the benefits and liabilities would be for both of you, you know, like a discussion that ends with agreed terms ?  Where's the part you were oppressed and forced into forsaking your career ?   ""We chose to have a family, a decision that ended up impeding my ability to find a job. We chose these things together, but they did not come without a cost... one that was paid mostly by me.""   Bullshit, you agreed he would be the financial earner and you would keep house and raise kids, only you didn't have even do that much because you had child carers! All the while enjoying financial independence, holidays, and more.  Of course having a child means at least one of you can't have a full-on career, you think you can do 60-hour work weeks and be a 24hr parent ? That's the deal you made, one of you earns, the other parents. You regret your decision, that's not his problem to solve just because you made a mistake.   ""Before anyone passes me a tissue or lights a torch in my honor, I want to point out that I am NOT a martyr.""   You're kidding right? you think you deserve applause because you're a parent, and even one with paid child carers ?   ""I got to live abroad, which had always been a dream of my own. I took advantage of the luxury of financial stability and very affordable childcare to explore some smaller dreams -- running my own business (without needing to make a profit), getting to know my children, creating my blog and writing for fun. None of these things would have been possible had I stayed on my 60 hour-a-week, fast-tracked career path I'd been on before we settled down.""   So let's get this straight, you had: - Holidays abroad - Affordable child care - Chance to run your own business without need to make a profit. - Had more time with your children than if you worked full-time - Had fun with your writing  ...and you think you're mother-of-the-year who deserves a special financial award ? Sounds like you had your cake and you still want to have it after.   ""But as much as I can play around with imaginary numbers and try and put a price tag on my experience as a sacrificing spouse, the actual losses from four years of virtually no salary cannot be overlooked. ""   They're not ""losses"", that is the agreement you made, the balance of risk/reward you intelligently made and AGREED to.   You don't get to absolve yourself of responsibility for your own choices simply because you made mistakes and don't want to accept the reality of your actions. You're a parent now, not an irresponsible teenager, so grow up.   ""Over half a million dollars in earnings -- not potential earnings, but the real, total of four years of paychecks at my pre-baby salary -- this is the true cost to me (and to our family) for putting my husband's career dreams at the top of our list.""   You're ""family"" didn't lose out on anything, it got one parent working and one at home, which was going to happen either way. You're the only one regretting anything.  That was what you signed-up for, and now you regret it. Who's problem is that ? You made a gamble on something you thought was agreeable, and now you want renege on your own terms? Sorry, gambling doesn't work like that.   You made your bed, now lie in it, which from the sounds of it you've already had a good time already so it's difficult to even sympathise with you complaining about ""missing out"" on anything.   ""Four years of bonus checks I would have otherwise received and stocked away in my bank account to spend however I wanted.""   Four years your husband could have still had a deeper relationship with his wife, a healthy sex life, nights out and a team player, a partner in love and commerce had you both not agreed to start a family.   But you DID agree to have children, and that's what it takes, the ability to intelligently choose what you believe will lead you both to happiness. If that means one of you stays home, then that's what you both agree is the best options, and you don't regret what you can't have, because you can't have it all. You have to choose, and you obviously chose poorly.   ""Now I would never call my husband my boss (not even while under an anesthetic), but I would absolutely agree with her that I earned some chunk of my husband's bonus check.""   You agreed to give up your career, so you don't get to take his when you had a comfortable life compared to other parents who are struggling : ""I took advantage of the luxury of financial stability and very affordable childcare "". yea, such a sacrifice and a martyr. It's not enough you had a luxurious lifestyle completely free of financial obligation, now you want ""pocket-money"" like a spoiled child ? Grow up   ""Splitting the household chores and child-related responsibilities are all part of the day-to-day task we opt into when we get married and have kids. But big sacrifices like the ones I made -- giving up a career and a fat paycheck of my own -- well, those deserve a little extra recognition.""    Unbelievable, you really think what's yours is yours and what's his is also yours. You agree to forsake your own career, but not to forsake any claim to his hard-earned salary? You are a self-centered, narcissistic, gold-digging hypocrite.   ""Calling it a bonus and making it clear that it is mine further underscores my right to spend it as I see fit.""   Not helping the ""gold-digger"" stereotype at all. the way you feel entitled to another person's assets when you agreed to forfeit your own is disgusting.   ""How much money I got in a bonus and how I spent it is nobody's business but my own. And if you don't think that my sacrifices earned me that money, you can STFU. I made my husband's dreams come true, and that is worth some money.""   Amazing, you really can't stand the fact you agreed to forfeit your own career while he enjoys the fruits of his own labour. Meanwhile you can't tolerate the idea you completely failed in your choice to swap your own career for parenthood. So clearly someone else should pay for your mistakes right ?"

I think we can all admit that in some parts of our society (however grotesque they might be), these things do count, and in that case, the extra work that the woman is doing to support the overall career progress of the man should STILL be recognized.

pussypassdenied,38c84v,bobjoeman,1 point,Wed Jun 3 19:35:23 2015 UTC,"My understanding is that you can either post the whole bail and get it all back if and when you show up to trial, or you can pay a bail bondsman about 10% of that, the bail bondsman posts the full bail, but keeps the 10% if you show up and goes and captures you if you don't show up.  In the latter case, your having fled will play hell in court as it did with Scott Peterson.  So if my above understanding is correct, her family can hand over $1 million refundable or $100K non-refundable, or she can sit her ass in jail and start serving the time she is almost certain to be given at sentencing after conviction.  And yes, I am assuming a conviction here.  Rear-ending anyone is already pretty much instant at-fault to begin with.  But her previous issues with the law, especially where uncontrolled rage played a part, the witness and video evidence, and if it proves true she did drag the guy 300 feet, will all do major damage to her defense.  If she has skid marks starting right at the point of impact, this may help her to get manslaughter, but if she waited even 1/2 second to hit the brakes as hard as she could, she's fucked.  I'm not sure if anti-lock brakes would leave any tell-tale sign, but the video is going to fuck her hard I imagine."

I know because I have a very similar mother. While they may believe that they have their childs' best interests at heart and that is absolutely a commendable sentiment, more often than not it seems to be moreso a contol problem on their part.

Some things happened I'd rather not discuss, but he was PISSED, and I remember it like it was yesterday, he said ""when you're ready to come back call me."" He hung up the phone. He didn't try to see me/call me until I was about 21. Now I can't stand him. What parent fails to keep a relationship with their only blood child?

It's not sexual harassment that's for sure, like the officer said; animals can't be held responsible for breaking our laws (the owners of the animal can in some instance...) but there is more to our law than getting turned on by the action.

And by interesting I meant it makes no sense whatsoever but that's what the judge decided. If we would only go by what's written in a strict way, half (and probably more) of the cases that actually go trough right now wouldn't. The law usually is pretty clear but some people will twist anything in weird ways and you know it: sometimes it works!   So yes I know it's written. I also know it's written that you can't drink and drive yet countless people have gotten off easy even when clearly guilty..."

You also a sound like you doubt our justice system? Honestly there is no perfect system but 95% of the time ours works out for the betterment of those involved and society. If a judge were to break the rules just because they think someone is guilty even though they don't actually have enough evidence to convict them, then innocent people would get convicted way more often and personally I would rather let a criminal go then watch a potentially innocent person get thrown under the bus.

The Supreme Court has recognized that although you have a First Amendment right to free speech, there are certain words which are more like a punch than actual speech or ideas. These are called ""fighting words.""  Law enforcement may argue that you were inciting or challenging an officer to fight with your insults, and they may legally arrest you. Then again, the Supreme Court also noted that it wasn't fighting words for to picket a military funeral with a sign saying ""Thank God for Dead Soldiers,"" so what actually qualifies as ""fighting words"" is unclear.  Even if it is legal to insult cops, hurling insults at officers may draw their ire and attention to other suspicious activity. So try to be nice."

pussypassdenied,37tl5l,jessemoforice,0,Sat May 30 10:05:09 2015 UTC,"Actually, yes it is illegal. For example, it could be assault. The reason people assume assault involves violence is due to popular lore. The truth is that assault, legally, is basically a threat plus probable imminent action. So, basically, if you say ""pig"" and the cop thinks you're going to proceed to spit on him, that's assault. That's why we say ""assault and battery"". The former is the threat while the latter is the action. The usual reason cops don't bother charging people with simple assault is because it's usually not worth the trouble coupled with the fact that it's not easy to prove in court.   In this case the charge probably wasn't assault. Rather I'm guessing it was something like harassment. In any case, I'm sure that if properly motivated, the cops can find something to charge you with. And let's face it, most judges are going to side with the cops on something like this."

Case in point for the dress code: In any tropical tourist destination, some restaurants have dress codes. They allow open shoes and knee-lenght clothes for woman while not tolerating shorts or sandals for man. The same thing sometimes happen in ''industrialised countries''. A lot of places also forces man to not show their toes and seriously, sandals with socks.... ugly! So for man it's closed shoes and socks even when it's +30 (Celsius). The same places usually has no problem with woman showing their toes. In fact, I'm sure that if they had a rules against it it would had been labeled sexist and misoginy since long. But it seems like toes are a man sexual regions...

pussypassdenied,37qxru,0xeb,2,Thu Jun 4 23:56:21 2015 UTC,"In another canadian province, there is a code that says that all clothes need to not be more than (I think it's) 2 inch higher than the knee. Be it dress, skirts, shorts, etc.  Well students are now fighting the policy because it's unfair for woman. So by their crusade, they want woman treated differently than man and they claim this on equality. So shorts would still be 2 inch higher than the knee but dress and skirts not anymore.   They also said they wanted a more uniform code so schools couldn't  put arbitrary rules. But now the code they ask for is for the teachers (and a student) to determine if the dress is too short or not. I think a gloabal 2 inch policy is way less arbitrary than a teachers decision that can be ''contested'' by the student commity.   What's sad is how the news presented this as a sign of how students are now taking an active role in politics and take a stand for their rights which is a good sign for their critical thinking skills."

Not everyone is born into money or financial stability(may i remind kids dont pick their parents)....some people are really poor or have problems in their life that do not allow them to spend money in things like clothes. Clothes vs medicine or food which would you pick?. I am only referring to public schools here. As this a normal practice at private schools. In a recent study:   Educational psychologist and TODAY contributor Michele Borba proved uniforms are a beneficial because they create “emotional safety at a school, which is pivotal to learning.”  Having kids wear uniforms will reduce bullying because kids won’t pick on each other for how they’re dressed, she said, and in urban settings, gang affiliation through dress will go down as well. The uniforms also reduce distractions, Borba said.  “It gets down to, ‘Let’s focus on the thing we’re supposed to be doing, called learning,’” she said.  Source:http://www.today.com/parents/are-school-uniforms-helping-or-hindering-6C10945768  For some extrange reason private schools already have uniforms....want to know why.....because its a positve way of having kids focus on learning, etc, etc....it works there is plenty of studies on the matter, go educate yourself. Think before you talk. Kids go to school to learn not to be a fashion or gang related statement or whatever else....  To close....kids will not loose their identity they can wear what they like after school or at social events. Im sorry your point is not very relevant. Bigger picture you should try sometime.   There is an old saying that goes kinda like this....Think it doesnt hurt!!!

pussypassdenied,37qxru,ginjamane1,0,Sat May 30 04:12:49 2015 UTC,"By having an opinion I am not thinking? You could have made your point without the petty insults thrown in.  I think you are over thinking it too much. Sorry I think that kids shouldn't be forced to dress in a uniform starting at age 3 and think they should be able to wear what they actually want to, I'm not sure why that makes me an idiot or an asshole, it is just a difference in opinion. I could easily find and bring up studies which show that uniforms have detrimental effects on a child. While some children have less money to spend on clothing, I don't think it is an issue which should be solved by forcing children to wear a polo and khakis. Life is about more than just structure and discipline, but I think the uniform policy prioritizes that too heavily and takes away from part of what it is to be a child, the ability to experiment and dress however you want. Education isn't strictly training for a job and meant to train youth in what it is to be a well disciplined american citizen. It is about learning about life, the world, and yourself, and I believe part of that should be the freedom to dress in what is comfortable for you. Allowing children to dress as they want literally takes nothing away from poor families, contrary to your point, and many affluent parents do not buy their kids any outfit they want either. It's just a matter of letting kids be kids and not forcing them into a more rigid, adult-like system of requiring a uniform."

She is dressing that way for one reason only: To advertise her sexual availability to men she deems to be desirable. Typically these are jocks, bad-boys, genetic lottery winners, and the wealthy.   But at the same time she doesn't want to deal with the attention of beta males or the shaming of society. This is where her flimsy accusations of 'misogyny' and 'objectification' come in.   This is nothing more than a cynical power-play. A great example of unfettered female sexual strategy in action. She is attempting to have her cake and eat it too."

pussypassdenied,37qxru,lechale,8,Sat May 30 03:23:41 2015 UTC,"As a father i see a problem in this. Due to the fact this are the years teens are in formation in several aspects. She does not see the repercution this can have in her life or other girls at her school or anyone that sees the video. This can be easily misinterpreted by less confident males or females that are looking for attention, etc. A simple mistake like this can lead into many unfortunate events, like name calling, etc, etc. The big issue here is not what she is wearing is the age that she is wearing it at. Kids need to have a solid fundation with respect for themselfs others, etc. Teens are easy to influence at this age and some might do it for wrong reasons which can have very complicated results. Being a guy from a feminist point of i can see why someone would support this...just not at this age. If she was out of highschool. I would not comment on this."

If you dress in something that seems really absurd then there's a social backlash within the school and people will make fun of you. I don't see why them wearing something is supposed to bother me, unless they are representing me in some way."

pussypassdenied,37qxru,lechale,2,Sat May 30 04:03:44 2015 UTC,Also to your point. What we want to avoid here is people having social backlash...this things can lead into fights abuse and other events.

pussypassdenied,37on4z,DX115FALCON,-1,Fri May 29 20:14:45 2015 UTC,"2917.01 Inciting to violence. (A) No person shall knowingly engage in conduct designed to urge or incite another to commit any offense of violence, when either of the following apply:  (1) The conduct takes place under circumstances that create a clear and present danger that any offense of violence will be committed;  (2) The conduct proximately results in the commission of any offense of violence.  (B) Whoever violates this section is guilty of inciting to violence. If the offense of violence that the other person is being urged or incited to commit is a misdemeanor, inciting to violence is a misdemeanor of the first degree. If the offense of violence that the other person is being urged or incited to commit is a felony, inciting to violence is a felony of the third degree.  Effective Date: 07-01-1996  It was not under circumstances where a clear and present danger is present, nor was it misconstrued and all white men killed. This was done for the effect and was undoubtedly to any reasonable person a hyperbole. It is stupid SJW bull shit and she should, without a doubt, lose her job but she in no way should be held criminally liable. Trying to get people prosecuted for saying shit you dont like will backfire in a heartbeat once precedent is set. I repeat, youre a fucking idiot if you think she should be prosecuted for this."

pussypassdenied,37m4vj,neotekz,2,Thu May 28 20:59:56 2015 UTC,"People seem to have this weird idea that if you call someone on their misbehavior, or the misbehavior of their peers, that suddenly it invalidates their position. In debate, this is called ""The Fallacy Fallacy"".   We saw this in the Mike Brown case where, because the Ferguson Police allegedly was (and was confirmed to be following a DoJ review) very racist, that it somehow changed the timeline of the shooting. Mike Brown was suddenly innocent and not at all responsible for anything that happened to him, not because Ofc. Wilson acted improperly, but because THE POLICE WERE RACIST.   I think it comes from Law and Order where we perceive one flaw being enough to get an entire case thrown out (which does happen sometimes, but not nearly to the extent is portrayed on TV), but even if every other cop were corrupt. Hell, even if this cop had been doing lines of coke stolen from Evidence moments before responding to this call, it doesn't change the fact that she committed a crime and has to get arrested. It's not a game, ""Oh you got me there! Now I have to let her go!""  Fucking imbeciles, the lot of them."

Having children is a life changing. Don't expect other people to deal with your problems. This not only applied to movie theater. Restaurants and other public areas. Some parents just let their kids making noise and running around the restaurant as if they at a playground. That really annoys me. Some people who have kids got a babysitter and trying to have a nice quiet dinner but instead have to deal with your bratty kids. Parents need to remember that if you can't control your child in public DON'T take them out. Stay home!!

pussypassdenied,37lt3v,TheJLNC,6,Thu May 28 18:15:33 2015 UTC,I suspect her story just fell apart from repeat questioning. What I'm wondering is why she did it in the first place.

Another guy did it 2012 and raped a girl in Miller county.  Another guy was apparently trying to kidnap kids last summer while impersonating a cop.  Or this guy who impersonated a cop and raped/sexually assaulted women he met at a bar:  http://adc.arkansas.gov/inmate_info/search.php?dcnum=142426&RACE=W&RUN=129  My sister actually met that guy one time when she went out with some friends here in Little Rock.  He was there with his girlfriend, who was a friend of my sister's coworkers.  My sister said was creepy as fuck and kept awkwardly staring her and other girls up and down blatantly while his girlfriend seemed to ignore it.  I'm curious as to how they determined this girl's story was a lie, because shit like that happens too often for comfort."

pussypassdenied,37fncg,shrekter,0,Thu May 28 00:17:08 2015 UTC,"Hate speech is legal according to the first amendment, from what I understand.  As long as they're not making actual threats of inciting violence or disturbing the peace can they get in trouble.  At least, that's how I understand the law.   FTFY  To clarify: A direct threat isn't unprotected, it's calling on a mob to enact violence on a person or people they could reasonably assault at the time, and pretty much requires that the violence actually happens or is attempted.  The other unprotected speech is yelling fire or bomb in order to create panic unnecessarily (disturbing the peace).  These kinds of speech directly cause violence and/or physically endanger real present people."
pussypassdenied,37fncg,Quteness,5,Thu May 28 00:26:20 2015 UTC,"Since when is hate speech illegal?  See R.A.V. v. City of St. Paul.  The basic outcome was that the Supreme Court struck down a law that prohibited ""hate speech"" containing political messages. This set precedence for the future that speech containing political messages are legal under the First Amendment to the Bill of Rights  Justice Scalia wrote:   A State may choose to prohibit only that obscenity which is the most patently offensive in its prurience — i.e., that which involves the most lascivious displays of sexual activity. But it may not prohibit, for example, only that obscenity which includes offensive political messages.   This was held up under Snyder v. Phelps which involved the Westboro Baptist Church"

Everyone knows there is no way they generate as much money as they supposedly do, but no one can do dick about it.  To keep up the appearance of a religious movement they have groups on sidewalks saying outrageous shit to people in more mixed areas of cities in the NE. The groups are generally led by someone in on the act, and who is very good at riling up the tourists that don't know the deal. Around the leader are usually stupid half-witted street kids who are looking for an identity and actually believe this shit.

Priapus is marked by his oversized, permanent erection, which gave rise to the medical term priapism. He became a popular figure in Roman erotic art and Latin literature, and is the subject of the often humorously obscene collection of verse called the Priapeia.

The problem here is, after watching the video a couple times, she spits right when he shoves the phone in her face aggressively, which could make her spitting an act of self defense itself.   The rule of thumb re: self-defense is you can only play it if you don't instigate and/or escalate a situation. So if he had stayed where he was... Then the spitting from the woman would be battery. But by rushing in like he did with his hand/phone (possibly body), he has ""unclean hands"" in this altercation."

Being a proud warrior, Sigurd challenged one of his enemies, Mael Brigte the Tusk (nicknamed so because of his buckteeth), to a pitched battle in which each man would bring forty men only. Sigurd cheated and brought eighty men, and because of this numerical advantage his men won the battle very quickly. In an act of triumphant arrogance, Sigurd strapped the severed head of Mael Brigte to his horse. Amazingly, while riding away from the battle, Mael Brigte’s famous buckteeth scratched Sigurd’s leg, causing a gangrenous infection which eventually claimed his life. Legend has it that Mael’s ghost returned to temporarily embody his severed head to commit a final act of revenge upon Sigurd, for his treachery at the battle."

Racist terms are shitty, and I prefer never to hear them, but they're all equally mean by nature. You just don't see anyone else lose their shit over racist terms."
pussypassdenied,37aj45,TerrinUK,4,Tue May 26 15:38:08 2015 UTC,They get offended when it is used in a derogatory way. It's going back to a time and the person saying it believing they are above a whole race of people.

I just kind of feel like it's time to get over it. There are going to be people that say shitty ignorant things, and it has nothing to do with slave owning, whipping people, stealing culture, etc. It's just ignorant people living in a world of preconceived prejudices, which is shitty but it isn't the same as slavery. Again it's appropriate shame this mentality, not assault."

It just gets old being the white male because everything is ""our fault"", and we need to ""check our privilege"", etc... There are a lot of assumptions in that. I was raised in an orphanage, nobody gave me any kind of hand up. I was a HS dropout, and went to college in my late 20's after a long time living hand to mouth. Now I make good money, and life is comfortable, and it just gets old that I should have to carry this guilt / shame for shit I had nothing to do with. Honestly if anyone has beef, it's me. When I was a kid in a children's home, I got bullied and fucked with constantly for being white. Anyway, I digress. Your point is fair, but I got over my oppression and it didn't happen 100 years ago."

You don't have the energy to scream by the time you're on the floor, you feel like falling asleep would be the best feeling ever and then all you hear and see is static until you get tunnel vision and then you black out. At the most, with people working to keep you awake, you can whisper and stay half awake, but you can't really control what you say. I think last time I just kept repeating ""I just want to sleep"" as I had my eyes closed and I was laid on my back and everyone was around me watching as they had ice cubes around my lips for some reason.

pussypassdenied,376hpt,glock112983,10,Mon May 25 15:04:31 2015 UTC,"Immediately outside the doors is fine. In fact most retail require loss prevention to wait until after you're through the doors as then you've actually stolen something. If they stop you before leaving you've only concealed the items and can deny that you ever intended to steal them. You can't prove intent in court, so must get them for the actual theft. Bs I know but that's the legal requirement. Most LPs have ""jurisdiction"" anywhere in the stores parking lot.  Source: former LP for the big blue store"
pussypassdenied,376hpt,nicodiumus,3,Mon May 25 14:28:42 2015 UTC,"That makes sense, thanks dude"
pussypassdenied,376hpt,glock112983,2,Mon May 25 15:13:16 2015 UTC,"Intent and proof are the key words. In the same way, many laws are designed to protect customers from LP detaining a person based on assumption. In my home state, they can't legally force a customer to provide them a receipt after purchase when asked, unless you pass through those security bars and it sets off the alarm. This comes back to the idea that once a customer makes a legitimate purchase, a retailer cannot ask to search a person or their property without legitimate proof of theft. i.e. A person is displaying the behavior of a shoplifter but LP does not witness this, there is no recording of the event and the security bars do not go off, they can't be forced to show a receipt or be detained. It is actually designed to protect retailers from a civil suit and possible criminal charges. The last thing a retailer needs is some gunho employee tackling a customer in  the parking lot, because they assumed that person was a shoplifter."
pussypassdenied,376hpt,nicodiumus,2,Mon May 25 15:43:24 2015 UTC,"I know over the years I had to let a lot of people walk out that I felt sure had been stealing but I wasn't 100%. We were always told is better to let a few get away than make a false accusation. I always knew exactly what the person had, where on their person it was hidden, and when there was packaging that had been removed, I usually had that in hand when making the stop.   If you can't get all of that, don't do it. I never made a bad stop. The thing at that point is deterrence. Make your presence known and make them aware they're being observed.  Not a crazy stare down though. To a legit customer, that's just as bad as actually stopping them with an accusation, but a shoplifter will get the hint and usually they ditch the goods and leave."
pussypassdenied,376hpt,TooManyKooks,1 point,Mon May 25 22:51:55 2015 UTC,"I agree with you 100%. Deterrence is key. Large retail chains do make financial allotments for loss through theft or damage. It does not cut into their bottom line what so ever. In fact, the write most of this loss off on their corporate tax filings."
pussypassdenied,376hpt,RodneyRuxinAMA,1 point,Mon May 25 23:22:24 2015 UTC,"Everyone in asset protection knows you can't catch everyone. The majority of shoplifters are normal people, maybe just hard up for cash that day or doing it for the thrill. They're inexperienced, and they're the ones you usually catch. The ones to worry about are the pros. The organized shoplifting rings that are tied to other organized crime. They can steal millions of dollars worth of merchandise from various stores in a few weeks. Having the right systems in place makes your store a hard target, rather than soft, but honestly, that's all you can do against those types. There are too many easy ways to steal so much stuff or really expensive items and you can't close every hole. Be vigilant and deter what you can. It still amazes me what some of these really smart criminals can come up with."
pussypassdenied,376hpt,ywkwpwnw,3,Mon May 25 23:27:14 2015 UTC,"That reminds me of something I witnessed last year. It was 11:50pm at a local grocery store. They close at 12:00. Besides the stock boys and the lone cashier, I was the only person there. Some young guy around 16-19 walks in. I am chatting with the cashier as I check out. This kid catches the corner of my eye because he just starts to walk out in a hurry. He is probably about 30 feet away from me and 10 feet away from the door. I yell ""Are you going to pay for that beer?"" He drops the 18 pack and makes a b-line for the door where his buddy was waiting in a car. They hauled ass out of there while I stood and laughed. I laughed not only because he bolted like a scared cat, but because he was trying to steal a 18 pack of natural light."

It basically comes down to two different forms of shallowness coming together.  They think they look better in heels, and they worry about how their boyfriend looks as an accessory.  I guarantee, unless you are so short that it causes you other problems like needing a specially equipped car or building special cabinets and counter-tops at your house, anyone who has a problem dating you based on that alone has enough problems of their own that they are never going to be happy with anyone, and no one is really going to be happy with them either."

So, a pinch of sugar can be absolutely perfect for one kind of Pizza, while another cook would use carrots and salt.   In the end... it just gives us a delicious variety of amazing pizza to enjoy.   Also, this may just be the fact that I live in NY... I hate this state, but fucking hell the pizza is good here."

A cis molecule has a double bond and two ""arms"" (of some length) in the same directions, like \=/   (imagine that the ends of the lines are connected to the middle of the = sign)  a trans molecule has a double bond and two ""arms"" in different directions, like \=\  This can affect the molecules properties, despite having the same atomical building blocks.   Fun fact: Our eyes are totally dependent on cis-trans molecules. Photons hit special cis-molecules in our eyes and makes them go to their trans state. This reaction is what's makes the signals to our brains telling us ""hey, there's light!"", and millions of these signals makes us see.   Now, just because you said you don't want to know I won't tell you what it means in the sexual context, and will let you research that on your own. Just note that ""trans"" and ""cis"" are not a made up words by SJW to shame people."

The CIS is a loose association of states. Although the CIS has few supranational powers, it is aimed at being more than a purely symbolic organisation, nominally possessing coordinating powers in the realm of trade, finance, lawmaking, and security. It has also promoted cooperation on cross-border crime prevention. However, eight of the nine CIS members states form the CIS Free Trade Area, and five of these form the Eurasian Economic Union, a customs union and common market of over 180 million people. In addition, six member states participate in a mutual defence alliance: the Collective Security Treaty Organization.

pussypassdenied,371tx9,Blaphtome,5,Mon May 25 10:51:55 2015 UTC,"It is the usual university hat trick where you try to define things from the fringe.  Cisgender has no meaning.  Transgender people, who have every right to exist and express themselves as I do, and who I will defend, are the fringe.  'Cisgender' is an attempt to re-define 'gender' which is already re-defined to support people.  As always, policitally correct support turned into hatespeech turned into widespread resentment and no real social change.  So, in effect, it is either a joke or a grievous offensive form of hate-speech.  I'm choosing joke and to laugh at anyone that says it.  Otherwise we have to go down that road where people using it need to modify their hate-speech and perhaps be sanctioned in civil proceedings."

Just because straight is the overwhelming majority doesn't mean there can't be a word describing the condition of being not gay, aka straight. Its true, nearly all people are cis. That's the norm. Creating the word cisgender doesn't change that, it just describes the condition of not being trans. There is no redefinition of gender, and I don't understand how describing not trans people as cis is hate speech. I don't understand how it's remotely offensive. Are you also offended by the word straight?"
pussypassdenied,371tx9,TheRedThrowAwayPill,2,Mon May 25 13:12:27 2015 UTC,"Please stop defining me with your hate-speech.  I am not a CIS, I am just a human being.  My worldview is unduly burdened by your need to define yourself by labeling me.  That is an offensive form of hate-speech.  If you need to label people, you can do it on your own time on your own private webpage.  But you shouldn't be doing it on a public forum like reddit, and certainly not using such terms on college campuses using public money, in the workplace because that's an attempt to define discrimination from your perceived norm, or in the decent common media like Slate or Salon or the WSJ.  Doing so is a terrible offense and an attempt to sideline my individuality based on your narrow definitions."

If not, your straight and that's cool too.  Its the same thing as the word straight. I really am failing to understand where any level of hate is being introduced. Its an non-derogatory adjective.   All cis means is not trans. The only thing you can't be is cis and trans at the same time, which isn't restricting because cis is literally defined as being not trans, therefore it's impossible to be both."

It was funny, but it was a derailment that came from nowhere.   ""Yeah, the countries that you say are better than us are full of white people! Checkmate!"" ... it doesn't counter her point at all.

You can't say a country with a tiny black minority is doing as great a job integrating them as a country where nearly 1 out of every 6 people is black.

Hell most will probably do all 3 in that order. So yeah props for not freaking out when all of your beliefs are being challenged.  EDIT: Grammar"
pussypassdenied,36u9c2,Malcolm1276,-4,Fri May 22 14:00:56 2015 UTC,You are right. But still. Praising her for staying calm - which should be a minimum standard - is like you're looking for something nice you can say.
pussypassdenied,36u9c2,darngooddogs,11,Fri May 22 15:03:01 2015 UTC,"In an ideal world, yes remaining calm would be the minimum a rational person should do in a debate, but we don't live in an ideal world and as I just said the vast majority of people faced with this situation would not react anywhere near as well as she did. I'm not trying to find things to compliment her on, I'm just expressing my genuine awe at her ability to keep a level head in this situation.  EDIT:Grammar again, sigh"
pussypassdenied,36u9c2,Malcolm1276,8,Fri May 22 15:19:25 2015 UTC,"She DOES hold it together very well. I expected her to flip shit any second. But it means something that, whenever I see a women get into some heat in a debate, I expect - and usually get - either a tantrum or a waterfall. But, granted, THIS woman kept her cool."
pussypassdenied,36u9c2,MatzedieFratze,2,Fri May 22 16:43:48 2015 UTC,You don't win arguments with someone yelling over you and thinking they by yelling louder they are right... I would rather tell someone they are wrong and would LOVE for them to actually sit there and hear my point rather than start getting pissy and yelling about.
pussypassdenied,36u9c2,Malcolm1276,-6,Fri May 22 18:47:48 2015 UTC,Rational adults don't freak out when they're shown they're wrong.   0% of your assumption applies to 90% of anyone.  I too like to make up statistics out of thin air.
pussypassdenied,36u9c2,riotguards,4,Fri May 22 15:25:03 2015 UTC,Fine no statisics I'll just state basic truths.   Truths:  People don't like having their beliefs challenged  People don't like being told their wrong  People especially don't like these things when they're being yelled  People ordinarily react poorly when subjected to things they don't like for long periods of time.  Opinion:  A person keeping a level head in a situation where all of the above are true is commendable.
pussypassdenied,36u9c2,kmillz1,-7,Fri May 22 15:35:12 2015 UTC,"Alright let's do this then.   Fine no statistics I'll just imply what I consider basic truths about every person on the planet.   FTFY   People don't like having their beliefs challenged  People don't like being told their wrong   Granted, but to imply that a person should be commended for not throwing a temper tantrum is silly. Implying that temper tantrums are the norm for behavior when brought in to discuss a sensitive topic is also absurd.   I will agree that there are ""some"" individuals who become heated very easily in discussions. Even with that being the case, where that gives you free reign to paint everyone with that broad brush?     People especially don't like these things when they're being yelled   And since we're discussing a particular video, in which I don't see yelling, this point is useless and off topic.   People ordinarily react poorly when subjected to things they don't like for long periods of time.   In the end, I should just throw this under the pointless and off topic banner as well. I just want to note that this interview was not under duress, she chose to go on and have a discussion. One would presume that when a person agrees to an interview on something they feel strongly about, that they're going to be an adult about it. No one deserves praise for not acting irrationally when it's expected in the first place. This isn't some random street corner interview. She came in knowing what the topic would be, why should adult behavior not be expected? Its almost as if you're implying that all interviews should be expected to be conducted like a FOX interview, complete with all the  ""I can talk louder"" moments you can fit in.   Opinion: A person keeping a level head in a situation where all of the above are true is commendable.   And I am of the opinion that people who act irrationally should be admonished, rather than viewing irrational behavior as par for the course."

You'd need to have a good few previous convictions to get a custody sentence especially as a minor. For example there was a convicted of raping a 13yo the other day and he was given 8 years and he'll most likely be out in 5.  This was GBH which means he had to have something broken, probably his nose. In order of seriousness GBH is one below attempted murder and just above ABH (which could be just knocking someone out or requiring stitches).  An 8 month sentence means you'll do 4 months by law, anything under 2 years (I think, it could be longer) and you only have to do half the time for it, I think if it's over two years you need to do the rest of your time on license, which is essentially bail conditions.

Besides, when bad parenting fucks somebody up does that mean that they shouldn't be punished when they do wrong? She will be rehabilitated."

Yes she did deserve it, look up what GBH is. GBH is extremely serious, it's causing ""grievous bodily harm"" on someone else, just because the video doesn't seem that bad doesn't mean that guy wasn't very seriously injured because he obviously was if she was charged with GBH. GBH means he was definitely injured seriously otherwise  she'd of been charged with ABH and the prosecutors would have decided that the injuries were serious enough for a GBH charge.  As for an adult getting the same, yes an adult would get 4+ for GBH easily. I can't see an adult getting less than 4 years for GBH. Again because the vid doesn't look bad, doesn't mean he wasn't getting his face reconstructed afterwards or spent a while in hospital.   Where I come from if you put someone in the hospital you'll get 8 months in the slammer. She punched a kid twice who could've walked away at any time.    Even though she was sentenced to 8months she will do 4 months regardless of behaviour, it's law. I don't know why they just don't someone 4 months but that's the way it works. It'll be in a juvenile centre which means it's basically nothing and it'll be a female Juvenile centre, she's not getting sent to a male borstal.  Where are you from?

I remember hearing a few girls just start SCREAMING bloody fucking murder, so I ran out and looked over the rail... sure enough these 2 bitches, probably 16, were getting cuffed for getting caught stealing from said Guess. I watched these two rich entitled white girls (about the only kind of person where I used to live) just scream and cry and plead for the next 5 minutes, making a giant audience appear around them. The entire mall gathered to see these girls get hauled off. There was applause once they were out! It was kind of amazing."

AlsoI bet they don't want to cause a scene by locking someone at the gates so they call the cops and let them find the shoplifter on the streets.

A point that is so good that nobody could call you an idiot for bringing it up?   Then you're a Sealion. Feminists keep making up words to describe an action that is absolutely normal and not aggressive and try to rebrand it to something bad so they have a weapon against something that they could not fight against otherwise.

You don't believe that argument or you think it is not true and you ask them to explain what they mean.  THAT is sealioning. They consider it a tactic of harassment to ask them for an explanation because they claim that your politeness is only a mask and you use the politeness to bring them down.  It's fucked up and it's just them trying to not have to answer questions. Therefor they try to shame something that is completely normal.  Sounds insane? It is.  An Example: I'm your dad now! Just for this little thought-experiment. I ask you if you have finally have gotten a job. You're one lazy ass and you don't like me asking this perfectly reasonable question. But what do? It's reasonable, you can't blame me for asking the question.  Now you have an Idea: You call the process of asking you if you have finally gotten a job ""Hitlering"" You take the whole thing and brand it with some word. Now you are able, with one word, to shame this whole process of asking you if you finally got a fucking job. This is ""Hitlering"" now. You can also add some assumptions. ""Hitlering"" is not only to ask you if you have gotten a job, but it's also opression because by asking to get a job I stop you from living your dream to become a Pro in Women Studies 101.

pussypassdenied,36mns1,denmaur,1 point,Thu May 21 15:12:39 2015 UTC,"Philistine? I definitely wouldn't say that at all. If they're not practicing radical feminism then they're not a radical feminist. Similar, a politician calls them self Democrat, but acts in a manner that is consistent of a Republican politican, than are they really a Democrat? The answer would be no. I actually think we might be arguing two separate things. Radical feminism is a sect of feminism that calls for a restructuring of society that eliminates male supremacy. Radical feminism seperates the male from the patriarchy itself, thus understanding that males are not the enemy. If they think otherwise, they are not a radical feminist. What you're describing are ""feminists"" who are excessive, fanatical, extreme, and/or violent. Any feminist who advocates for females to be superior to male biologically or socially is not a feminist."

If they're not practicing radical feminism then they're not a radical feminist.   No True Scotsman fallacy.   than are they really a Democrat?    Since there are two parties than one could claim that they're a more conservative/moderate Democrat as opposed to liberal Democrat. This doesn't really work to prove your point as radical feminists are known as a particular party whereas a political party like the Democrats have a diverse makeup. Look at the Republicans. There's Neo-Con, Tea Party, Libertarian, Religious Right, Moderate etc.   I actually think we might be arguing two separate things. Radical feminism is a sect of feminism that calls for a restructuring of society that eliminates male supremacy.   Again, this is where the Philistine comment comes from. Actually, I know the Bible says do not be like the hypocrites. Was that Philistine or was it the Pharassies? I think it was the Pharassies. The high priests that Jesus was talking about. Probably my fault, heard people say Philistine when using that. But my point still stands, this is what they say they do, but their actions prove different.   Any feminist who advocates for females to be superior to male biologically or socially is not a feminist.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbK1xeWJsOw"

Instead she pretty much says ""I won't explain it to you because you won't understand (because of your gender and race) and could not possibly understand. I don't need to reason my points but you should accept them because I am oppressed.""   Bullshit.   No doubt, I have met some white dudes from 'privilege' who can't understand why people are poor, struggling and angry (but once they leave home and see the world 'get it'). That is not a reason to not explain yourself or not back up your assertions with facts. But even then I have met some white dudes who have shitty upbringings and difficult lives too.

The owner of the team said he didn't get the big deal and started a charity for Native American's called the Washington Redskins charity or something like that. He was calling the Native charity 'Redskin charity.' Something to that effect.  Stephen Colbert, in an attempt to make fun of this, had a segment where he was starting his own charity called ""the ching chong ding dong charity for Orientals or Whatever"" and the logo was a slanty-eyed smiley face wearing one of those rice-paddy hats.  The joke was completely over this woman's head and she started a Twitter campaign called 'CancelColbert' which sort of started getting some attention.

Some government officials do this as well.  That's why the US is never just concerned or troubled, etc., but is always either ""deeply"" or ""profoundly"" one of these things.

Her other sister, her mother and myself will also talk with her about this and try to actually reach her as a family. Her plans for college and becoming a doctor is pretty solid and she's finally committed to something in her life and doing surprisingly well. As you can guess, she's always been a troubled kid and who knows, maybe with a bit more work I can help her with this as well.

They're most common (only ever really) at universities, because you sadly get a lot of these SJW type people around that age. And when you have someone crying about the terrible conditions for this and that ethnicity and minority, it's difficult for a university board to argue against them. Not because of their sound reasoning, but because of the difficulty in arguing against someone who will at every opportunity turn around and call you racist, sexist and base their argument around the idea that you are simply uninformed.  So the universities appoint these people. Usually into some position with a title, an office and thankfully usually absolutely zero ability to influence anything. Not that they ever have any actual ideas beyond complaining.  In the end it's just the SJW and a band of their friends essentially circlejerking about how terrible literally everyone else is and trying to invent a minority group that they can say they belong to. E.g. this whiter than white girls ""ethnic minority"". 'Idiot' is not an ethnic minority. It's basically a position given to the loudest SJW to shut them up for a bit."

When I first read about this story I hoped she just made a bad call and once someone pointed it out to her that she was in fact not in charge of a support group, and she wasn't hosting this as a private person she'd see how dumb her decision was. So much for hoping.  Her response to the backlash only proves that she is too dumb to understand rudimentary logic, basic English and public relations. Had I been her employer I'd like to fire her for being so fucking awful at her job and for being too retarded to understand the concepts of something that is supposed to be her field of expertise.

Under this definition, this ethinic minority woman is of the discriminated group rather than the discriminating one and claims she is not acting in a racist or sexist manner since the greater discrimination is inherently against those in her group.  I don't define racism or sexism in this way. Neither would any number of enlightened others.

She intentionally hastagged ""kill all men"" and used racist slurs on her official messages, banned people from an official event on the basis of their race and gender, then when called on her egregious behavior argued that what she had done was perfectly acceptable.  She did what she did intentionally.  She refuses to acknowledge that what she did was wrong.  She shows absolutely no remorse.  There shouldn't need to be any petitions or votes.

You'd have asked me for evidence that feminism, as a whole, fails to meet this standard of reason. You'd have then at least attempted, but failed, to provide evidence that whatever organization you hate because you're irrational also meets this standard of un-reason.   But you didn't. You're just a moron, and thus: a feminist. Only morons become feminists, and since you're stupid enough to become a feminist i'll also say: not all morons become feminists. Even saying that i'm sure you don't understand, and if you respond it'll be with something so remarkably retarded i'll probably consider you a troll. I've never spoken to a feminist who wasn't, at best, borderline retarded."

Shaking hands after a fight is unheard of in the animal kingdom (mainly because animals have paws but whatever!) yet there is some instance of it in the human world.  Even warfare now has rules to obey. Sure not everyone is going to follow them but morally, humans are seeing attacking and killing others as a last resort option. I'm pretty sure two (name animal) don't care much about that when fighting for a female. There is also not many fight to the death in human society compared to animal ones.  We're not perfect, far from it, but we're slowly improving upon our nature. Why do people need to see everything as black or white?

There is a data set that does support this notion,  however,  as you said,  it cannot be extrapolated to the world at large.  That is my point.

The only way a statement can be racist is it it states that one race is above another = not equal.  So saying africans all hunt isnt racist, its ignorant and generalising BUT saying that they all hunt BECAUSE they are naturally worse than whites etc is racist. Do you see the difference? Blanket statements arent racist unless they imply on race is below another."

pussypassdenied,3631ph,Dark_Ronald_McDonald,-14,Fri May 15 18:55:10 2015 UTC,There is something called proportinal response.   Granted if something is harsh enough the response you dilver doesnt have to be proportinal but there is still a limit. Someone slaps you? Killing them would not be an acceptable response. Punching them would be.  Someone hits you with a soft object that causes no more pain than a poke then laying them out would be but pushing them would be.  Now if the witnesses are correct in that she punched with object in hand rather than hit with soft object then fine.  Touching someone doesnt warrant such a violent reaction.

I don't agree that the officers actions were correct, but lord this woman was just the picture of antagonism instead of problem-solving. Also, the whole taser-torture thing was purely dramatics. The gauge on the taser needles is 18, not some huge dagger, and the shock only runs for 5 seconds, not the good 15-20 seconds she screams like she's being flayed alive. It's not bad, I've been tased several times and I've never once heard anyone react in this manner.

pussypassdenied,35ya92,ArousedPony,3,Sun May 17 04:19:41 2015 UTC,"What rights of hers were violated? Well, you cannot be forced to wait for a K9 unit during a stop without a warrant or probable cause according to Rodriquez v the United States. 'Looking Nervous' is subjective but can be used as reasonable suspicion in some cases. You can hear the story play out on the video. The female officer says she has a pretty dog and apparently that made the female officer think she was nervous. The officer never asked her any follow up questions about being nervous, which is required if they are going to use that as reasonable suspicion unless they catch her in a lie(they didn't). The male officer said she looked nervous but that was after the K9 units had already been called. If you rewatch the video you can hear the victim ask who the male officer is and he says he is the supervisor. Well how can he say she looked nervous enough to call K9 units when that was the first time he met her and they had already been called? There is a serious plot hole in both of the officer's stories as witnessed by the video.   Now we are going to move onto lawful commands from an LEO. Since it is illegal to force someone to wait for a K9 unit without warrant or probable cause(there is no legal probable cause), then you can agree that she was being detained illegally. She now has the legal right to get in her car and drive away. You can hear the male officer telling her she is not leaving with her car. This is an UNLAWFUL command by an LEO. If she attempts to leave, The officer could then spike her tires, arrest her, tase her and bash her head if she attempts to drive away, but he would be violating her constitutional rights under the color of law.   When the officer walked into her personal space and told her to move this was also an UNLAWFUL command because she was being illegally detained. He then tased and arrested her. In the Mattos v Agarano case filed in Dec 2010, The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit declared that, Unless in a setting where an officer's safety is at risk, the officer must give warning before each application, and that the suspect must be capable of compliance, with enough time to consider a warning, and to recover from the extreme pain of any prior application of the Taser. In this similar case, the courts determined that the officers had used excessive force. The officer in the video did not give warning of tasing her, and his safety was not at risk. Now even if the officer had used a LAWFUL command when he told her to move, using a taser still would have been excessive force. This was an UNLAWFUL command so this may even constitute assault and battery on the woman when it inevitably goes to court.   Now any lawyer will tell you to obey an officer's commands, even if unlawful, and deal with the litigation afterwards to determine if your rights are violated. This is only for the safety of the victim, not because cops deserve to be responded to with 'Yes sir' and 'No sir.' The victim in the video is also a law student who knows her rights and was not afraid to use them. Even if it got her tased, bruised and arrested. You also have to understand that not everything an officer tells you during a routine traffic stop is considered a command. This is a tactic they use during an attempt to get your consent. If an officer 'asks' you to step out of your car is it a command or a request? Sometimes the way you answer a question can mean the difference between consent and non-consent. Did you know that once you are out of your car, if an officer asks you for your keys and you give them to him thinking it is a command, it is a form of consenting to a search. I think this is why the victim in the video said she will not give the male officer her keys. I think this may have also been why she didn't move once the officer told her to. The language of law may have considered that a request and not a command. It was clear once the officer got in her personal space that it was a command and not a request, but it was still unlawful.   What rights of hers were violated? Many! I think this will be an easily won mult-million dollar lawsuit assuming she doesn't settle outside of court. IMO, the female officer should be suspended and retrained, and the supervisor should be fired and charged with multiple felonies.

pussypassdenied,35ya92,autowikibot,3,Fri May 15 09:29:33 2015 UTC,"Taser:       A Taser or conducted electrical weapon (CEW)  is an electroshock weapon sold by Taser International. It fires two small dart-like electrodes, which stay connected to the main unit by conductors, to deliver electrical current to disrupt voluntary control of muscles causing ""neuromuscular incapacitation"".   Someone struck by a Taser experiences stimulation of his or her sensory nerves and motor nerves, resulting in strong involuntary muscle contractions. Tasers do not rely only on pain compliance, except when used in 'drive stun' mode, and are thus preferred by some law enforcement over non-Taser stun guns and other electronic control weapons.

pussypassdenied,35ya92,Mahlegos,5,Fri May 15 09:29:45 2015 UTC,"So there seems to be quite a bit of misunderstanding here. Your argument is based on an incomplete/flawed premise.  First, the ruling by SCOTUS being cited is in regards to police officers. Border Patrol are not the police. They are held to different standards and are a federal agency not a state agency. Therefore the SCOTUS ruling doesn't apply here as they are specifically talking about state/municipal police agencies making traffic stops and then calling in k9s, not border patrol searches at designated areas.    This leads into my second point. One of the different standards is something you mention, probable cause and the claim that she was illegally detained. The fact is that BP has been given the power to stop and search anyone with no probable cause or reasonable suspicion at the border or a functional equivalent which includes checkpoints like the one seen in the video. Whether or not they should be allowed to circumvent the fourth amendment is another conversation, but the fact is they are. That contradicts your claims of his unlawful orders. They had the right legally to stop her and search her vehicle. She didn't like that they were able to do this. But they were acting lawfully and she continued to escalate the situation with her actions. Which brings me to my final point.   The woman herself admits to physically resisting the officer. She posted on Facebook something to the effect of ""they're trying to charge me with felony assault on an officer but I only did that because he put his hands on me first"", which immediately makes her into a culpable party in getting tazed. If she ignores a lawful order and then resisted the officer, that escalates her from passively resistant to physically resistant and makes the use of reasonable force an option. Should they have used that option? I'm not sure. We can't see what actually physically transpires in the video. But her actions beforehand and statements afterward seem to suggest the arguement can be made and by no means is it the clear police brutality you claim.   I am by no means a police appologist. I fully agree this could have been handled in a much better way by everyone involved including the Border Patrol officers.  I'm entirely for knowing and protecting your civil rights, and there is absolutely no denying the abhorrent abuses that are becoming more and more common and that we're in desperate need of reforms. But, in this situation the woman was in the wrong and escalated the situation and it isn't the slam dunk case for her you and others seem to believe it is. Even if she won some kind of monetary judgement which is unlikely, it wouldn't be coming from the person you perceive to be in the wrong here. It would be coming from the tax payers and I don't really see that as justice. All that being said, I don't really think it belongs on PPD as she never tried to use her gender to justify her actions.   Edit: source on the ability to stop and search without probable cause. http://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/when-can-officials-stop-question-search-travelers-the-us-border.html  And the quote from her Facebook.  ""Now they are trying to put charges on me federally for assaulting an officer when I did it in self defense after he pushed me!!!!!"" I don't have the direct link unfortunately and I'm not going to go creeping on Facebook to find one, it was stated in the comments of the original post.   /u/Theblueedition and /u/bathrobehero I figured I'd mention you in this post since you both were involved in the conversation as well. None of her right were violated and she was the main instigator that escalated the situation to the outcome we saw."

pussypassdenied,35ya92,dangerousopinions,1 point,Sat May 16 07:12:56 2015 UTC,"The problem here is that these are U.S border and customs agents at an interior border checkpoint. The constitutionality of which has been affirmed by the supreme court in The United States v. Martinez-Fuerte but only for the purposes of establishing the legality of an individual's presence in the U.S. I could be wrong here as I'm not a legal scholar, but the supreme court did not affirm the constitutionality of unwarranted search and seizures at said checkpoints.   The fact that these are customs and border agents at an interior border checkpoint and not law enforcement potentially makes a big difference in terms of constitutionality. They don't have the same powers they have when people are entering from outside the country. These people are already inside the country and they can't exercise the same powers they do at an actual border crossing. The law treats those two locations very differently for obvious reasons. I don't know that they even have the power to search for anything but humans at an interior checkpoint, at least as far as the supreme court ruling and constitution are concerned.   I personally think the whole idea of interior checkpoints is unacceptable and more than a little bit fascist. I think this kind of search and seizure is exactly the kind that the constitution is intended to prevent. And I think this woman was right to challenge the authority of border guards inside the borders of the U.S trying to carry out a search of her vehicle.

This obviously isn't necessary when people are still technically outside of the country in which case border guards have almost absolute power. Since the ruling, so far as I know, doesn't affirm the legality of anything more than checking identity and ensuring ones legal presence within the U.S, doing searches within the borders is probably something that could be challenged in court."
pussypassdenied,35ya92,Mahlegos,1 point,Thu May 21 00:35:00 2015 UTC,"The checkpoint can be ruled a functional equivalent to the border, in which case the exception to the fourth amendment that has been granted to the border patrol and upheld by the courts would allow them to stop and search vehicles without probable cause. This is outlined in the link I provided which it appears you didn't read. Also, the purpose of the checkpoints isn't only to check identity, it's also to make sure there is no contraband being brought through hence the ability to conduct searches. You clearly don't have a firm grasp of the facts here, so please stop trying to argue as if you do."
pussypassdenied,35ya92,dangerousopinions,1 point,Thu May 21 00:57:02 2015 UTC,"The checkpoint can be ruled a functional equivalent to the border   But it can't, that's obvious. It's within the borders of the United States where people have their charter rights. They do not have said rights at an actual border which is why it's never been an issue to strip a car to it's frame and leave it like that but it is at an interior checkpoint. Similarly, a challenge of the kind I referenced wouldn't have been possible if the incident had occurred at an actual border and the ruling wouldn't have stated that an individual subject to the checkpoint need not do anything at all, including respond to the border guard. The ruling specifically stated that the only power a border guard has at the checkpoint is to confirm the identity of those that pass through it.    This is outlined in the link I provided which it appears you didn't read. Also, the purpose of the checkpoints isn't only to check identity, it's also to make sure there is no contraband being brought through hence the ability to conduct searches.   Yes, but not according to the supreme court ruling on the issue which only upholds the existence of checkpoints and guards ability to confirm the legal presence in the U.S of individuals that pass through said checkpoint. No other function of these checkpoints has been upheld as constitutional so far.   I get where you're coming from in that under the law the guards at an interior checkpoint have search powers. But the law to which you refer hasn't been challenged. The constitutionality of the checkpoint itself has, and it's been upheld with limits. There is still a question as to whether the law that empowers guards to search is constitutional. That has yet to be brought to the supreme court. Since there is a clear difference between and internal border and external border, there is a good chance that if challenged, searches at interior border checkpoints would be ruled unconstitutional. I think random searches on the highway without so much as reasonable cause, carried out by border guards (this part is important), is the very definition of unreasonable search and seizure.   .....therefor, it's completely possible that these guards are infringing on this woman's constitutional protection against unreasonable search and seizure. She should challenge this in court. I hope there is a lawyer out there with the will and resources to assist her in this, and I hope she wins or the supreme court limits the power of guards at interior checkpoints the same way they did in the first challenge when the plaintiff claimed confirming identity was a 4th amendment violation."
pussypassdenied,35ya92,Mahlegos,1 point,Thu May 21 12:26:56 2015 UTC,"Ok, just because you repeat something doesn't make it any more true. Interior checkpoints can be ruled functional equivalents to the border. This is not debatable. They aren't always viewed as such, but they unquestionably can be. And if it is, then the same powers and exceptions apply. You say the law I referenced hasn't been challenged. That means it's currently still valid, which is why they are using it to justify the searches. The rest of your argument is based almost entirely on supposition and therefore I'm not going to debate any further with you. If the woman takes them to court and challenges their search (which should have been her initial responce to the situation instead of escalating it then and there), I wish her the best of luck as I don't support the disregard of our rights, but she would be fighting an uphill battle. Thank you for the conversation. Good day."

pussypassdenied,35ya92,winthrow,-2,Mon May 18 05:18:41 2015 UTC,Here.  Let me just show you the law that trumps this law by design and intent.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privileges_and_Immunities_Clause  http://constitution.findlaw.com/amendment14/annotation33.html
pussypassdenied,35ya92,bathrobehero,5,Mon May 18 06:35:29 2015 UTC,"Here. Let me tell you why you're wrong. Border patrol is a federal agency, not a state agency which the law you posted specifically pertains to. The law you're citing solely prevents States from imposing laws on motorists from other States unfairly and has no relevance to the Federal agency or situation in question. An example of something it would protect you from is being issued a ticket for not having a front license plate in a state that requires them when you're in a vehicle registered in a state that doesn't. Again, it has no bearing on the Border Patrols exception to the Fourth Amendment or the situation in question. The exception from the Fourth Amendment I mentioned has been upheld for some time now by various courts. That's why they still routinely search vehicles without probable cause at the border and at checkpoints like they did in the video. Because they are expressly allowed to. It's this kind of egregious misunderstanding of the law that leads to the ""freeman of the land"" type people, who erroneously cite this one in particular regularly in an attempt to of speeding tickets and other lawful situations, getting themselves into more serious trouble. Same goes for the woman in the video. I understand wanting to protect your rights. But, the best course of action in a situation like this is to document the presumed violations and seek justice in a more effective manner. If you go the route the woman did (even if you are right, which she wasn't) you risk escalating the situation and getting yourself hit with more charges that wouldn't have happened or stuck otherwise.  Please, do not attempt to cite a law and/or debate a topic that you don't have cogent understanding of.   edit: spelling and words"

I have a quick little cheat-sheet flow-chart I run through in my head.  it goes like this.     Am I with anyone who would be adversely affected by my standing up for my rights at this moment in time, and if so, would their adversity have a negative impact on my life or socio-economic well-being?   Am I likely to be severely injured or killed by these particular individuals?  Do I have the time to deal with these individuals, including being incarcerated for the weekend, next few days, until I can see a judge, whatever the case may be?  Am I feeling particularly RIGHT on this topic at this moment in time? As my mother says, ""Is THIS the hill I want to die on in this fight?""   That said, I have stood up for my rights, and I have had many conversations with LEO's about such situations.  I happen to have no problems with LEO's, so long as they hold themselves to the standards by which they hold others.  I don't think most of them are bad apples.  I think there's a lot of unfortunate training going on right now, misinformation being fed to them about what is legal, what their rights are, what our rights are, literally, how to get over on us and trample our rights through intimidation and insinuation rather than force.  These methods are wrong-headed.  They are not how you treat people in a free and equal society, and they are not respectful of the people you are supposed to be, above all else, protecting.   p.s. a little note.

Do what they say, record what they do, and after you're done dealing with the angry man with the gun and tazer, file a formal complaint to either their CO or IA and post it to facebook and youtube and staple it to telephone poles.  But the bottom line is, ""When a cop pulls you over and you get out and start arguing with them, if that cop tells you to get back in your car, you get back in your car.""

First off, nervousness is not probable cause for being detained in this situation. Second, where she was standing was lawfully out of the way of the checkpoint. Third, these checkpoints have been a hot-spot for normal citizens to assert their rights to drive peacefully and without being unlawfully searched or detained. Yes, the women was being antagonistic. I'd be, as well, with my rights being so blatantly violated. Here is a great example of what this women's likely intention was - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4zYizaMmDo And here is a great (staged) video from reason tv on the subject - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BB_l6sLxNj4  Most people do comply in these situations, but it is a fundamental principle of this country that you may not be unlawfully searched, questioned, or detained, while simply traveling on a road somewhat near a border. Unfortunately, the ""Constitution-free zone"" complicates things. See https://www.aclu.org/know-your-rights-governments-100-mile-border-zone-map  On a separate note, the Supreme Court recently ruled that it is against the law to hold a motorist for longer than 10 minutes while awaiting a K9 unit. The hour this woman was handcuffed was absolutely illegal. This is about holding our law enforcement, especially federal law enforcement such as border patrol, to a very high standard, such that the rights of all are maintained.   Know your rights and always hold law enforcement accountable."

pussypassdenied,35oakc,mymetallicsonatas,9,Tue May 12 06:51:50 2015 UTC,I agree with you but she may have thought that settling the phone bill would get the woman to leave him alone and since it comes out of production costs anyway it makes no big difference to the guy. Depending on the setup of the show either the costs will come out of his appearance fee or possibly just be paid by the production company completely without him losing out at all.
pussypassdenied,35oakc,cgimusic,4,Tue May 12 10:21:30 2015 UTC,I know you're looking for a more legal response and I'm not that but as I gathered the judge perceived the cell phone bill as him taking advantage of her so she held him to it. She could make no statement about the car loan because it wasn't due yet otherwise she prob would've stuck him with that as well.

So by the fact a women has even charged is a general PPD maybe not directly against her but against women in general.  Again like when she made a rape claim in the video no action was taken and that is something that had the potential to ruin that guys life, I doubt she'd of made that claim if she was a man or even attempted to get sympathy from it.

That's something that's going to stick even if it's untrue. It can have a detrimental effect on one's social life and career. Whether it's reported to the cops or not is irrelevant IMO. Slander/Libel is more about the damages done to the victim than the outlet of how they accused.

Then you have to drop your case in the real courts and agree to arbitration by these 'judges'.  If he was going to sue her for it, he'd have to file for it separately or amend his suit which arbitration shows like this probably don't allow if for no reason other than the sake of time.    I agree what she's done is beyond fucked and she SHOULD pay for it because it's clear she's one of those people that feels she can do whatever she wants when she's mad at someone.  She was hurt that he didn't want her and therefore she tried to ruin his life, and was to a degree successful (not that he's without any blame, not paying his debt for the phone, primarily) in that at a minimum she caused him trouble and he lost overnight visitation with his daughter.  I hope he's able to get that back now that he has proof she's a lying, manipulative twat.  But my point is that even if he DID bring this up and try to push it, which he may have, they'd likely cut it from the final show because there's nothing more this judge can do about that."

Lesser jihad is protecting your property/ name of islam. Lesser jihad is what these terrorists hold on to and try to hide behind to justify their terrorism. Just like most people in power, they twist the meaning of words to justify what they're doing and to gain support, and it's fucked up that these type of people give all muslims a bad name, since a majority of muslims are just as appalled, if not more so, as everyone else at the acts of terrorism that they do.

These ruling whether real or fake aren't actually decided by a judge rather than agree upon by the plaintiff and defendant through the course of mediation. Then the saga is acted out in a ""trial"", where both parties are likely paid for their appearance. I will say that whatever is decided in mediation and signed by both parties is legally binding and is a contractual agreement.

But the second someone calls them fat we all have to stop the fucking presses because how dare someone say something about them that's ""out of their control"". People like that make me sick, are a drag on society, and are the reason aliens won't talk to us. On another note, there was a study that found short people tend to live longer than tall people. Those performing the study believe the correlation between height and longetivy lies with the lungs. In short people, the lungs function more efficiently. While in tall people, the lungs struggle to meet the respiratory demand a taller body requires. That's why environmental factors such as oxygen availability affects the size to which things grow. Ever notice how people born and raised in high altitudes tend to be shorter than people born and raised in lower altitudes? Oxygen availability."

pussypassdenied,35k94b,Wargame4life,17,Thu May 14 10:57:07 2015 UTC,"Warning shots are considered illegal in many states in america. For one, because they can harm innocent bystanders, as the velocity of the bullet even when falling from the sky can still penetrate skin and bone.  Fire one into the ground, it could ricochet.  I'm pretty sure a universal ""I have a gun, back the fuck off"" is more than enough to get any reasonable person to back off. I'm not going to attempt to assault somebody with a gun, and if I did, i'd expect to get shot."
pussypassdenied,35k94b,noogai131,7,Thu May 14 23:20:26 2015 UTC,"That's a good question, and honestly I don't know the answer, but personally I think it'd be a bad idea to shoot in the air.   The round could land elsewhere and hurt somebody innocent. The warning shot might just piss them off, and now you're down by a round. The act of firing a warning shot suggests that you're not in mortal danger yet, so the only time that gun should go off is when you're about to neutralize a threat.   I think I would have ran away more if possible, but if they were going to outrun me I would have done the same and given the same verbal warnings. At that point, once you've clearly announced that you're fearful for your safety and that you have a gun, they are completely in control of what happens next.  If you (assailant) continue running, you're liable to get shot. If you stop running, you can avoid getting shot.  If I were said assailant I'm fairly sure I would have little trouble deciding which choice to go with."
pussypassdenied,35k94b,GeneralPickle,4,Fri May 15 00:50:41 2015 UTC,"The law as it is in Texas....  Warning shots, or shots to intentional wound are considered not to be within your rights.   You are expected to either draw your gun and shoot to stop the threat(most of the time that ends with someone dead)....OR draw your gun and de-escalate the situation(where someone would either run away or comply).  If this would have happened in Texas,  This woman who rushed the camera could have been easily shot and killed.  The mere act that there is a disparity of force(multiple aggressors) in this situation nullifies the proverbial ""don't shoot; pussy pass/I'm a woman"" issue."

In my dealings with cops they don't leave anything to chance. When you get pulled over for any traffic infraction they ask you to prove you are properly licensed, registered, and insured as a motorist.  So if you are in public and someone sees you with a gun and gets nervous and calls the police the least you can do is let them prove that you are legit.   I do not believe in open carry because I believe open carry makes you a target but also the presence of guns all over the place can be annoying. You wouldn't want to go to a cafe in a junk yard right? But would you go to one in a nice car dealership? Same goes for guns. I don't want to sit in a cafe with people's guns all over the damn counter.  Florida is not an open carry state but has really ""fun"" gun friendly laws.

Late to this party but if you are open carrying in NH you have done nothing wrong, no infraction. A better comparison would be if someone called the police because they saw you driving a car at the speed limit and coming to a complete stop at a stop sign and that made them nervous. Do you think it's reasonable for the police to stop you and check your paperwork?  If someone sees me walking my dog and gets nervous and calls the police because they have an irrational fear of dogs or ignorance of the law, do you think I have to prove that I'm not using my dog in a crime just because someone is unreasonably afraid? When they call and report something that's completely legal don't you think the police should just tell them it's legal and to stop wasting their time?"

pussypassdenied,35k94b,TiredPaedo,4,Sat Jun 6 08:14:21 2015 UTC,top tip if ever you need to stop filming to view the footage tell the time at which you are stopping footage (i.e its 02.48pm stopping filming) and then mention the time when filming is resumed.  then it makes it much harder for anyone to falsify anything that happens off camera.

Then you can just use an encrypted partition in the same stick for anything you want to save between boots and have a pocket portable system that leaves nothing on any host into which it is plugged.  It's better defense against both online and offline attacks since anything that isn't read-only is either wiped or encrypted at all times.  Re-roll the live image with the memory encryption kernel modules/patches and it isn't nearly as vulnerable to memory dumps either.

But from what I've seen, this guy was just filming his walk around, wasn't going to let people boss him around when they had no legal rights to, and defended himself justly and with very calm and sound reasoning. He didn't even have to shoot anybody either, and in fact he went out of his way to make sure he didn't have to shoot somebody. In any other state, all you need is that video of them charging at you, the audio of you saying ""get back I have a gun"" and to comply with police and that is a justifiable self defense shooting.

I didn't realize how much I could save eating at home and finding cheap rent.  I also didn't realize how she was spending the money on clothes, hair, etc.  Didn't track spending.  More and more credit card debt every month.  After I got divorced, I went over my spending with my accountant.  He was shocked.  He said, ""Wow, you don't spend any money.""

My mom, for instance, used my dad's retirement funds (a good 20,000) while he was off at basic to pay for whatever instead of the money she was making at her job to help raise me (and my brother when he was born). I don't know how she did it, but she did it. He thought his money was safe so he didn't know until it was too late.  It's not the first time she's done things like this. One time she sold my dad's new used car that he bought a month prior (while he was deployed) so that she could buy a brand new car (despite already having two functioning vehicles) and they only just recently paid off.   Now she complains about dad spending money on a case of beer once a month, or when he hangs out with his friends on the weekend (which only happens once or twice a month). Meanwhileshe was spending $400-500 a month on cigarettes (she quit off and on) alone, not to mention on things she doesn't need.  I think she just loves to spend money on things like that and she doesn't care who she hurts to do it."

Anyway she wound up pregnant while I was in the Army and decided to marry her so we could raise our child as a family unit. I also realize this too was stupid thinking.

pussypassdenied,35dyi6,taidana,5,Sun May 10 16:43:31 2015 UTC,Why is the system in place?  I honestly cannot think of an example that isn't ridiculous.
pussypassdenied,35dyi6,shaunsanders,19,Sun May 10 16:51:16 2015 UTC,"If you're genuinely curious, risking downvotes, I'll explain:  Spousal support recognizes opportunity costs that often occur in a marriage between partners. If you have two people out in the work force who are married, they are both generating marketable skills, connections, raises, etc. Etc. But when one of them then leaves the workforce to stay home in a relationship, or reduces their work load, then they lose the economic inertia they once had.   So while people often bash the idea as a former spouse ""leaching off their ex,"" society views it as, ""you two entered into a marriage agreement, which substantially reduced the market value of one partner for the benefit of _______ (fill in the blank... Family stability? Household support? Other?) and now that you don't want to be in a marriage anymore, your spouse has been disadvantaged to the point that they will require help to make up for the time lost... Rather than rely on taxpayers to provide that help, the spouse who benefited most from the marriage should offset the losses incurred.""  Like any system, it is abused... But the system itself is intended to prevent an ex-spouse from being punished for essentially going ""all-in"" with a marriage. The lesson to be learned for people:    Marriage is serious, and should be taken seriously.  When your spouse becomes dependent on you, that dependence doesn't stop once you stop loving them... And that is a part of your responsibility to your spouse and your society that recognized your marriage, so you will be held accountable.    It would be unfair to allow someone all the benefit of a spouse and career inertia without acknowledging the value that the spouse contributes to the marriage.  Tl;dr: marriage is not dating. Those who believe alimony is without any value are under a false assumption that both parties leave the marriage with as much opportunity as they came in with. This is often not the case. For example, a stay at home mom contributes greatly to the marriage, but once divorced, that value is hardly marketable or a capital benefit."
pussypassdenied,35dyi6,PM-ME-SMILES-PLZ,6,Sat May 9 22:41:51 2015 UTC,"Good explanation. The idea on it's own merit is a good one, but the rampant and persistent abuse makes everyone hate the way it operates."

pussypassdenied,35dyi6,StrikingEarth,1 point,Sun May 10 06:10:47 2015 UTC,"No, alimony is calculated based on each spouse's income and expenses. If children are involved then child support is used as well. Alimony is strictly (in my state at least) support for the spouse.   There are few but growing numbers of male recipients of alimony. However, alimony was designed for women, so the vast majority of recipients are women."
pussypassdenied,35dyi6,Deadonstick,9,Sun May 10 20:50:55 2015 UTC,"I never understood the concept of alimony. Way back in the day it was something introduced to prevent women being fully dependant on a man for income after having children.  In return for free shelter and money and such the woman would have to do a different type of labour. She'd take care of the kids, emotionally support the husband, do the housekeeping, groceries, cooking, etc.  How come when this agreement is considered voided (a divorce) the man is still required to provide his end of the bargain (money) but the woman is somehow free from all obligations she had with the man.  Unless ofcourse you're saying that the woman's responsibilities were insignificant. Because that would mean the man lost a lot less in the divorce than the woman, which would be unfair. But personally I think being a good housewife is just as important as being a good financial provider."
pussypassdenied,35dyi6,Trumps,4,Fri May 29 02:47:47 2015 UTC,"Being out of work force for so long has a detrimental effect on your ability to get a job and your skills for said job. When they decide that she should be an at home mom, and him support her and the family, I certainly think you should provide alimony for a while (up to a year) until she can get an adequate job"
pussypassdenied,35dyi6,Deadonstick,6,Sat May 9 23:28:33 2015 UTC,"Then again being out of the dating game for so long has a detrimental effect on your ability to get another wife. I mean in the 50s (the era I'm more or less on about when alimony was really a thing to protect women) the man at this point would be dependant on the woman for a clean house, clean clothes, food and emotional support. He probably never lived on his own without a wife and works a physically demanding job making cleaning more than just ""a chore"".  But like I said, the moment that agreement ends, the man is expected to keep his side of the bargain until the woman finds a job (and normally longer) but the woman isn't required to continue doing housework until the man has another wife.  Nor is the man allowed to give the wife half his income minus all the money is costs to hire the nessecary people (babysitter, cook and housekeeper) to perform the former wife's duties."

Just because you have nice tits and suck a good dick doesn't mean you are entitled to fortunes of someone's hard work. My Uncle spent eight years of his life at Ivy League schools and countless more building a practice and some bitch that got a boob job and left him took all his money and married an even richer guy from the country club they lived in. Is it his fault for marrying a hot bitch that had no brains and a lot of cleavage...? Maybe, but that doesn't mean that she is entitled to millions she didn't earn.

What alimony should not be is a get out of work free for life card. It should not be in the millions Or even hundreds of thousands. It should not last year's and years. It should not be adjusted in the future when the one getting paid falls into more financial trouble.  It should not force the one paying it to go back to work or find a second job when the one getting paid isn't working at all."

The working spouse has seen a lasting benefit from the other spouse agreeing to stay home.

Your reasoning is completely valid, and is basically the same as my post, which I see now will get downvoted into oblivion because how dare anyone suggest that there's a difference of opinion.  Better get rid of it, based on emotional knee-jerk reactions rather than discuss it and examine it logically.  Fucking hypocrites."
pussypassdenied,35dyi6,bartallen4790,16,Sat May 9 20:19:43 2015 UTC,"If you read the whole article he's changing the alimony law to make it so that after 10 years of marriage there will be a 20% alimony for 5 years until they get back on their feet, that is plenty of time and no one should argue that it will take longer than 5 years to build a new career for yourself. A lot of men don't collect alimony also, only 3% of people on alimony right now are men. That is not a lot."
pussypassdenied,35dyi6,automirage04,-11,Sat May 9 13:18:24 2015 UTC,"I actually misread that part, but I still don't like the numbers, honestly. Granted, its better than complete abolition across the board, but 10 is a bit too long, imo. You can still miss a lot of opportunities in 9.5 years.  3% of a big number is still a big number. Lets not get bogged down in semantics. My point was that this subreddit is for situations where women are trying to get away with shit that they would not expect men to get away with. The fact that alimony can and does get awarded to men sort of disqualifies the topic, in my opinion. Now if you want to post a video of Judge Judy smacking down a bitch asking for alimony when she doesn't need it, that belongs in r/pussypassdenied."

While it's true that it's extremely difficult to be a perfect mom and homemaker, the fact is you can be a shitty mom and half-ass your way through domestic duties and still get exactly the same legal benefits. In a real job, doing so would get you fired. There is no objective way to separate the good ones from the bad ones, so there's no real incentive for them to put effort into it. There's no reason why people can't set aside an alimony ""agreement"" without it being legally mandatory. This way, the breadwinner has a boss, and the homemaker has a boss, and they're now both accountable for their shitty work. Don't like it? Double breadwinner."

The concept behind the petition is simple and equal to both sexes. Feminists want equality then they should face the facts of what equality is. Having a child does not mean you can sit on your ass for the rest of your life and have a man pay for it. get up of your ass and work.
pussypassdenied,35dyi6,automirage04,2,Sat May 9 14:37:42 2015 UTC,"Both my parents worked, and still do. My wife and I both work. But that doesn't mean what's right for my family, or your family, is right for every family. Taking alimony off the table as a possibility discourages a completely valid choice for families to make.   Granted, there are a lot of dumb bitches who abuse the tradition, but the idea behind alimony is about making sure one spouse can't take unfair advantage of the other. Poor implementation is a separate issue that should be dealt with separately.   Saying alimony should be done away with because some women collect it and don't really need it is like saying we should do away with social security, because some seniors collect it and don't need it. If you want to add a few more precautions to prevent abuse, that's one thing. I'd rather give it to a few people who don't need it, than take it away from everyone who genuinely deserves it and needs it."

If I could share in roughly 50% of somebody's money and property/life, be the main spender for the household (this is what happens with the homemaker, they spend the majority of the money that goes into the household), and have a nice house to sleep in, and all I had to do was look after kids and clean the house, i'd consider it a fucking bargain. I'm great with kids and know how to set up shit for them to have fun with, while doing my own stuff and at the same time still keep an eye on them, and cleaning can be relegated to small jobs each day.  I'd prefer to work, but being able to sit on my ass for around 60% of the day and still have the shit I want would be pretty damn good."

pussypassdenied,35dyi6,bryanrobh,-5,Sat May 9 14:50:56 2015 UTC,Well a couple of couples I know have that exact setup.  The woman would have the kid and stay home to raise the kid from birth. And the kids is still under 10 years old. So you aren't able to leave them alone  Edit: there is definitely merit to having the mother stay home to raise the kid as opposed to a stranger who could molest or beat the kid

pussypassdenied,35dyi6,bryanrobh,0,Sat May 9 19:16:51 2015 UTC,That's fine we can use stats from 10 years ago.   Neglect 62.8% Physical abuse  16.6% Sexual abuse    9.3% Emotional/psychological abuse   7.1% Medical neglect 2.0% Other   14.3%  Is how they define maltreatment. Neglect is what not paying attention to the kid? Ok. When I say abuse I mean beating at molesting as I said previously.    Also most of these cases of parents maltreatment of kids comes from homes where the parenting are alcoholics or drug abusers. According to your 10 year old stats. So there goes the caring parent idea out of the window.

If feminism is wrong because it prefers the female then relishing in watching a video of a female being detained and assaulted for asserting her rights is baffling to me. It reminds me of the video I watched on this same sub of a women being arrested for being intoxicated in a restaurant (ihop I think?) And her shitlord white knight trying to rally the denizens of that restaurant to her defense. She was a shit person and broke laws and expected preferential treatment because of her xx chromosomes. This lady said nothing of the sort. She defended her rights that are supposed to be unalienable for all humans and did it without the use or mention of anything regarding her sexuality. There isnt a shred of PPD to be found here in my mind.

PPD is when a woman is acting entitled - either by behaving erratically or hitting someone or throwing a tantrum etc. - because she thinks the the very nature of her being a female makes her immune from punishment or entitled to certain privileges. It's pretty obvious why she was upset. She was being detained and she was not being told why. THAT is why she was upset. It appears as though they were in violation of her 4th Amendment right under the Constitution. She wasn't upset because she thought she deserved to be treated differently as a woman.

I was unaware of any law allowing for that.  She really should have walked away the moment the officer said she could and immediately called 911 rather than threatening to call in 20 minutes. Hopefully a legitimate supervisor would know the constitution and recognize that they had no right to detain her vehicle.  Even better, had they found drugs or something, the evidence would be inadmissible in court. In Rodriguez v.

Border patrol is specifically trained to watch for behaviours that may betray an illegal act and have the authority to detain and search property based upon those suspicions.   As with most encounters like this, law enforcement has a responsibility to maintain control of a situation. That is why they have the authority to issue orders. The orders he gave to her were lawful, even if she didn't like being told what to do. In refusing to obey the order she was given she escalated the situation. She moved from ""cooperative"" to ""passive resistant"". The officer then responded with soft open hand guidance and she then escalated again to active resistance, which is then responded to with control tactics and intermediate compliance tools.

Would you say ""oh you know I guess it was just a stroke of bad luck that I got tackled and tazed,"" or ""had my property stolen.""  I grew up in the south. I witnessed firsthand what corruption in a police force can look like. Look up the investigations on the auburn Alabama police force and their sudden increase of issuance of bullshit tickets to increase revenue. I was there at the city hall meetings when townspeople were trying to put a stop to it. I was there with my friend who was south american and got stopped and frisked. He was searched while the three white people he was with were not. The officer would not answer our questions as to why except to say he looked ""unstable on his feet.""   In my young age I should have stood up for him but my friends and I sat there dumbfounded and he grimaced and accepted what happened but just kept saying ""what are you searching me for?!""  I wish I had the courage that this woman had and all others who look at our laws and expect our law enforcement to obey those very laws.   But please explain your position. I honestly want to know why you think this officer was in the right?  If you can explain it to me with any real evidence or convincing argument I will gladly agree with you. I'm not above being persuaded in the presence of logic or fact.   My premise is that it was wrong of them to detain her without reasonable suspicion of having committed a crime and then following that with assaulting her; both of which are against the law. What is your position in defense of these actions?"

Border Partrol are not held to the same standards with regards to the fourth amendment as other LEO's. They do not require probable cause or reasonable suspicion to stop and search a vehicle and they didn't detain her person intiially as evidenced in the video. http://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/when-can-officials-stop-question-search-travelers-the-us-border.html  Now, I can't claim to know if they were right to taze her as we can't actually see what happened and how she physically reacted in the video but he gave her a lawful order ""step over there out of the way"" and she refused which escalated the situation from a simple stop and search into something more confrontational. At that point it becomes a discussion of discretion and you nor I are qualified to say they were wrong or right to use force against her because we simply do not know what actually happened. I do not expect you to agree with me, but this case is not nearly a clear cut case of police abusing their power as you and others seem to believe."

Sure, she's being a jerk, but these officers are detaining this woman against her will because they are waiting to use a dog as a horrible legal loophole into violating this woman's 4th Amendment rights. Somehow in our twisted legal system, this became ok. I'd be as pissed as she was. Once she starts making ultimatums, yeah, then she's being stupid because there's a good chance an American officer is going to respond with nonlethal force. Then there's all the extra charges she's going to face like resisting arrest and threatening an officer, blah blah blah. There was no probable cause for the officers to search her car so they detain her until the officers can get a tool that will look inside her car to see if the car contains the items they did not have the probable cause to search in the first place. Moral of the story- even if you've got nothing to hide, don't let your government illegally detain you to use a bullshit method of control. Also, don't be an asshole. Also also, don't ask the officer if ""he's fucking retarded?"" It will never help your case."
pussypassdenied,35gxzz,Mahlegos,-1,Mon May 11 00:05:40 2015 UTC,"They didn't detain her.  She kept trying to argue that they had no right to detain her, but the male agent told her she could leave at any time.  Only her car was going to stay, and that was because they had reasonable suspicion, due to her nervous behavior more than one agent witnessed, that she had something prohibited in the vehicle.  Then, once she realized she could not bait an argument with them on the subject of their right to detain her (a right they may not have had but at any rate did not attempt to exercise) she changed tactics to try and make an argument about where she was allowed to stand.  I wish I had been there when this happened.  I would have shouted in triumph when she got tazed, the annoying asshole.  The 4th Amendment does not go nearly as far with regard to vehicles as it does to homes.  She behaved suspiciously at a border control checkpoint, and that is justification enough for them to hold her car for a drug dog."

Writing on behalf of the court, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg declared that the constitutional protections against unreasonable search and seizure prevent police from extending an otherwise completed traffic stop to allow for a drug-sniffing dog to arrive.  “We hold that a police stop exceeding the time needed to handle the matter for which the stop was made violates the Constitution’s shield against unreasonable seizures,” she ruled.  The case, Rodriguez v. United States, was brought by a man who was pulled over for driving on the shoulder of a Nebraska highway. After the police pulled him over, checked his license and issued a warning for his erratic driving, the officer asked whether he could walk his drug-sniffing dog around the vehicle. The driver, Dennys Rodriguez, refused. However, the officer nonetheless detained him for “seven or eight minutes” until a backup officer arrived with a dog of his own.  After sniffing around the car, the dog detected drugs, and Rodriguez was indicted for possessing methamphetamine. In all, the stop lasted less than 30 minutes.  According to the Supreme Court, though, that search of Rodriguez’s car was illegal, and the evidence gathered in it should not be used at trial. While officers may use a dog to sniff around a car during the course of a routine traffic stop, they cannot extend the length of the stop in order to carry it out....  Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito and Anthony Kennedy disagreed with the ruling, arguing that police can reasonably detain people to investigate other possible violations of the law."

Still a fucked up turn of how our 4th Amendment has been interpreted.      If I had been there, I would have wept to see, once again, my constitutional rights get trampled while some yokel is cheering on some power trip asshole cop. You're right- the 4th Amendment doesn't go nearly as far with regard to vehicles as it does to homes. That's not a good thing... The protections these Amendments created were designed to secure the personal citizens' rights, and that's no longer the case. That's what I have issue with, and what ALL Americans should be concerned with. Yes, she did everything wrong when it came to interacting with this officer- doesn't mean she was wrong though.      NERVOUS BEHAVIOR IS NOT PROBABLE CAUSE! You realize that is the threshold that was created by our constitution, right? Not a cop who is suspicious. That's the whole issue I have with this scene.

I was in a situation when I was pulled over by a police officer about a month ago. He asked for my ID and I just gave it to him. Looked at it for about 5 seconds and said ""You're not the person I'm looking for, have a nice day"". Simple as that. Took me 3 minutes.   Did I feel violated? Fuck no! He's doing his job and people who resist simple checks waste their time, the officers time and other people's time.

However, I only feel that way since in Australia, there are very strict laws concerning guns they seem to work well but in the US, they do not.   Back to the video, I'll leave it at this. Citizens have all these rights and whatnot yet they use them to stand up against the police, which is a force designed to keep society orderly and functional.

That made me just assume that the paperwork for a report was worthless anyway. I did get a protection order though and that's all I cared about. See what makes me realize this woman is lying is that she not only didn't follow up but she went through with getting someone arrested. All she needed to do if she felt her safety was really in danger was to get a temporary protection order and then if the man violated it she could have him arrested for her protection. But it seems what she was doing was beyond survival. It was retaliatory. It was designed to punish him. Sigh. . . I'm just glad I got away and now am living in a safe place."

pussypassdenied,359q1h,WatchOutRadioactiveM,9,Fri May 8 17:57:14 2015 UTC,"Hey I read your links. I just want to ask, why did you write your comments like that? Were you trying to stir people up instead of educating them? I mean you have a valid point if we are talking from a ethnicity neutral perspective but your wording suggests otherwise. From your sources, MAO-A is the only thing that supports a possible  difference in aggression originating from which race they were born to. And I don't think 25% is huge, just relevant enough to support a point.  I know that genetics plays a role in behavior, and people with certain mutations will behave differently, but for the majority of people (those of us without irregular mutations) I think the difference is negligible when compared to environmental effects. I'll just use the sources you provided as context.  1. The whole thing is directly relevant, but here are two important snippets.   59% of Black men, 54% of Chinese men, 56% of Maori men, and 34% of Caucasian men carry the 3R allele.      A connection between a version of the monoamine oxidase A gene (3R) and several types of antisocial behavior has been found. MAO-A had no statistically significant main effect on antisocial behavior. Maltreated children with genes causing high levels of MAO-A were less likely to develop antisocial behavior.[28] Low MAO-A activity in combination with abuse experienced during childhood results in an increased risk of aggressive behaviour as an adult.[29] High testosterone, maternal tobacco smoking during pregnancy, poor material living standards, dropping out of school, and low IQ can also trigger violent behavior in men with the low-activity alleles (which are overwhelmingly the 3R allele).   That article literally states that the gene variant has no significant effect unless coupled with a bad environment. Black people are just 25% more likely to have the gene than white people.  2. The farthest this got to supporting a race issue was Spearman's hypothesis, speculating that the parts of IQ tests with the highest g-load would have the greatest difference between race. There was so much stuff in that article arguing that race was not the core issue of intelligence that you should just read it for yourself.  3. Speaking of Spearman haha... hey maybe you guys would have gotten along (not being facetious or insulting). I see why you brought the g factor into this, and it is commonly cited in these types of debates. I feel like it be can be used misguidedly though, where it's original point was to convey that generally, people show a correlation between how good they are at one the thing to how good they are at another. My rebuttal would simply be that generally, black people are in worse socio-economic environments, leading to a generally worse IQ. There is not a single thing in that article stating that it is a repercussion of genetics other than the fact that the g-factor is inherited. What I mean is that you cannot interpret the test as black people being naturally less intelligent unless you compare a large sample of blacks and whites that all came from the same socio-economic environments.  4. I am kind of confused why you cited this one. In regards to race, this article only mentions it in the last section. There it says the Flynn Effect is used in arguments regarding Spearman's hypothesis and that it could be related to a diminishing racial IQ gap.  Like I said, you have valid points, but not rooted in race, just genetics. So why write it like you want to piss people off?"

pussypassdenied,359q1h,breauxstradamus,-10,Fri May 8 22:32:04 2015 UTC,"Median Public School teacher pay - $55,360. A married couple of teachers makes more than double the median household income in the United States. Please don't spout ignorant bullshit, no matter how often you hear it.  Keep in mind they do not work a full year. I have worked in restaurants over the summer with tons of teachers who pocket another $X dollars while crying about being underpaid.  Also try to bear in mind that education majors are among the least academically successful college majors. Their degree has no real-world value outside of their union's coercive power. They cry about being underpaid, but they are simply not competitive with their skills.  Education is not useless, but teachers are useless at providing it. Ironically, all the good teachers (the ones you want to pretend care about performing their job well) are teaching at private schools for pay cuts. These glorified babysitters deserve a flat $15 per hour with bonuses for the academic successes of their students. Even better, give the ones who 'teach' in more dangerous schools a higher salary and higher incentives. That way there are no crocodile tears from the lazy sacks of shit that I had as an upper-middle class white kid. I dropped out in 10th grade, educated myself, and lied my way into college. No teacher did any of that shit for me."
pussypassdenied,359q1h,CivilityBeDamned,5,Sat May 9 04:03:01 2015 UTC,"Is that average income nation-wide, across all schools? I think we need to look at the specific districts that have this type of behavior/teaching occur. They are usually the lower level education systems with the funding to match. Just syphoning money differently isn't that easy as you seem to think it is.   That way there are no crocodile tears from the lazy sacks of shit that I had as an upper-middle class white kid. I dropped out in 10th grade, educated myself, and lied my way into college. No teacher did any of that shit for me.   You seem to have a grudge on the education system as a whole."
pussypassdenied,359q1h,ambermonkey,-12,Mon May 11 00:25:19 2015 UTC,"You seem to have a grudge on the education system as a whole.   Yes. My experience was that they are lazy and don't care. They have no financial incentives to care, and they've sold themselves on a narrative of complacency and accepted failure. I mean, unless you can explain away the rapidly declining quality of a public education which correlates with continual raises over the same time?  At 16, I was far more capable and motivated to educate myself using the library and Internet than any teacher was. At my public school there were no teachers capable of educating me on legal issues beyond where I'd educated myself to, ditto for coding and I can't program for shit.  I won't even comment on the teachers that were fucking students and buying drugs from them, which was not super rare."

And like what the others are saying, they don't all make 53k a year. Just because the average pay for a small business owner can be pretty high doesn't mean that they all make good money. Usually the higher numbers off set the average a lot more than the smaller numbers.  All it takes is one dude making some 90k a year to pull the average up a little. And considering the highest paid ones make close to 85k a year in the public school system, and they are from California or New York, it makes sense.  If most of those teachers in two of the most populated States are earning a lot of money, then that will offset the average pretty hard.   And it sounds like you're pulling that ""Fucking students and buying drugs from them"" story straight out of your ass.  And just because a teacher taught you morals (you know, not teaching you how to lie) doesn't make them a bad teacher. It means you didn't grasp the concepts and probably didn't look for help either.  It's not hard to find help to learn in public schools."

At my public school there were no teachers capable of educating me on legal issues beyond where I'd educated myself to, ditto for coding and I can't program for shit.   A lot of people aren't as brilliant as you seem to think you are and need structure, and the schools need money to build that structure. This has become a biography on your education.

pussypassdenied,353c4a,cmmoore307,13,Thu May 7 03:45:51 2015 UTC,"""It was the worst decision of my life,"" Richards said through tears.  ""I followed a lot of people with hate in their hearts... and I'm sorry for the actions I didn't take to save Mr. Anderson's life.""   ""I didn't take""  See how this is a subtle attempt at passing the blame? Graves and her attorneys set this up intentionally.  They follow this up with :   I was a teenager who partied too much and wanted to fit in with the crowd...  He pointed out where Graves had told investigators that her mother used to tell her and her brother they were ""living like n-----s"" when their rooms were not clean. Harvey told the judge that she did not remember saying that.  ""I would have said negroes, not n-----s,"" she said. ""I just meant that their rooms were nasty, like a pigsty.""  Wingate asked her what she considered that slur to mean, and she said, ""an ignorant, nasty person.""  ""I was taught in school that a n----- was a nasty person, and a negro was a black person,"" she said.   Listen to this clip from Alan Watts regarding determinism. He perfectly describes what is happening here. Pass the blame, pass the blame, and to what end?   God, in the story of Genesis, asks Eve, ""Did thou eat the fruit of thy tree that thou has told thee not to eat?""  Eve says, ""Oh, but the serpent tempted me...""  And the serpent didn't make an excuse, he probably winked, because the serpent being an angel knew where the present begins.   The point of this being, accountability starts with you, right now.  But as far as sympathizing with the defendants, this clip from Sam Harris' talk on free will is relevant. He discusses the murderer Charles Whitman.  Mr. Whitman started his killing spree by killing his wife and mother, and had no clear idea why he was doing it. He went up on a clock tower and killed a dozen or so more people. Before being killed he wrote on a suicide note that scientist should examine his brain.  Upon examining his brain, it was found he had a brain tumor pressing on his amygdala. The amygdala plays a primary role in decision making.  Sam suggests, ""retribution is actually an artifact of our not seeing the causes, the true causes, of human behavior."" He continues, ""A brain tumor is just a special case of physical events giving rise to events and actions. If we could perfectly understand the brain of one murder, no matter how evil, that understanding of the neurophysiology would be as exculpatory as a tumor... The basis of placing blame would disappear.""  One of the concepts he discusses is the idea that if I were to replace every atom of my body with the defendants, including her brain, and I had all her life experiences, I would choose to act just the way she did. Although blame cannot be passed, it is also true that there are causal circumstances that played a role in shaping her life that were beyond her control. She did not choose her parents, her genes, or the place she was born.  She must, and will, be reprimanded for her actions, but there is no reason we cannot also sympathize with her circumstance, while simultaneously mourning the death of an innocent man."
pussypassdenied,353c4a,mrmooocow4,2,Wed May 6 23:50:46 2015 UTC,"...if I were to replace every atom of my body with the defendants, including her brain...   Then you would literally be that person, no?"
pussypassdenied,353c4a,metalmartyr,7,Wed May 6 21:18:53 2015 UTC,"Yes, you could argue that, that is a tautology. Saying if I were her, I'd be her could be interpreted as nonsensical.  In that Sam Harris video, he uses another analogy of a bear.   If you were taking a nap in the park, you hear an unfamiliar sound, and you awake to the sight of a grizzly bear charging at you from across the lawn.  It'll be perfectly easy for you to understand you have a problem, without any imagining of free will, there is an immediate threat to your life.  The situation changes in some very interesting ways if you swap the bear with a man with an axe, but the introduction of free will into your attacker, is not one of them.  Now, imagine you survive your ordeal, and it's a real trauma, and imagine you are really injured. Let's say you lose a hand. You have lasting physical injury, and you've narrowly escaped with your life.  Imagine the difference in your experience. Your subsequent experience is liable to depend, far too much, in my view on the species of your attacker.  So, imagine what it would be like to see your human attacker, the person who almost killed you with an axe, on the witness stand on trial.  Your hand, and hatred of this person, may be so intense at that moment that it may cause further trauma. You may spend years of your life fantasizing about this person's death.  How long would you spend hating the bear? It seems to me you might even want to visit the bear in the zoo with your friends. You'd say, ""that is the big one, that is the one that got me,"" you may be pointing with this hand, however.  It is a completely different perception. Which state of mind would you rather have?  So, the bear was clearly just being a bear. What else is a bear going to do if it finds you sleeping in the park. But the psychopath was just being a psychopath.  But this illusion that the man was endowed with free will and could and should have done otherwise, I think accounts for the stark difference in subsequent psychological suffering.  Many people worry that this illusion of free will is necessary for getting what we want in life.  But the truth is, the difference between happiness and suffering is just as stark as it ever was. I no more want to be killed by a bear than I want to be killed by a man with an axe.  And we can avoid them, and we can encourage people to be as good and reasonable as they can be, without confusing ourselves on the origin of human behavior.   The point of this being, when you read about the mother saying things like, ""I would have said negroes, not n-----s,"" in response to her racial slurs, well you can see plain as day that the defendant had a shitty mother, who, in turn, was taught by other shitty people.  And the important thing to note here, is that I am referencing Sam Harris as a means to sympathize with her on the basis of the circumstances in her life that she did not choose.  However, all the excuses in the world will not change the fact that she was involved in an event that resulted in the death of an innocent man. Therefore, she must face the consequences of her actions, and hopefully through this she can learn to change for the better, because what is often forgotten is that the purpose of jails and prisons are to rehabilitate citizens, and not as a means of retribution.  Cheers."

pussypassdenied,353c4a,metalmartyr,-2,Thu May 7 13:59:34 2015 UTC,"Do a little reading on solipsism and why your type of argument isn't a valid one.  If you start saying things like ""every action they made is a product of things that happened to them, leading up to the event, and thus is not the fault of their own"" then where do you draw the line?  At what point can you say ""this is an intelligent life form. He/she can make rational decisions. He/she knows what is right and wrong, and he/she must decide whether or not to commit murder"".  I'm sorry but your argument just falls flat. She deserves to be punished as a murderer, not as a murderer that had her hand forced because of events in her life leading up to that point.  That's like saying the SS were brainwashed by Hitler to devalue Jews during the second world war. Do the SS members deserve to be let off the hook too?  In layman's terms: she's a fucking adult. She can make her own decisions and she needs to face the consequences of those decisions; not be given special treatment because she's a special snowflake."
pussypassdenied,353c4a,Rispetto,7,Thu May 7 14:28:02 2015 UTC,"The entire first half of my comment is establishing just that, that the defendant is to be held accountable for all actions.  Did you miss the whole Watts, God, and serpent quote?  And also, I'm not so much arguing as I am making a case for being able to sympathize with a person's unfortunate circumstance, while at the same time holding them accountable.  I even said:   The point of this being, accountability starts with you, right now.   And started the next idea with:   But as far as sympathizing...   As far as solipsism, this is one of the earliest concepts in many philosophical discussions.  I tend to agree with the premise that in a pragmatic sense, yes, my own consciousness can only ever be conveyed in analogy.  But to truly believe that you are the only solipsist can surely be viewed as an absurd claim. Obviously solipsism is difficult to refute, the very nature of its definition makes it intrinsically so, but to suggest my comments are somehow wrong on the basis of solipsism, is a bit of a stretch.  The last line even says:   She must, and will, be reprimanded for her actions, but..   Nobody is letting anyone off the hook, nor is anyone suggesting that.  Cheers."

Dominick pleaded guilty to conspiracy in 2013 and faces five years in prison. Montgomery, who pleaded guilty in 2012, faces life in prison on a hate crime charge and five years on conspiracy. Gaskamp, who wasn't present the night Anderson died, pleaded guilty in 2012. He faces five years in prison for conspiracy and 10 years on a hate crime charge.   It appears the conspiracy to commit a hate crime is 5 years, which is what the one got. But in the other case it can be up to 10 years.

Ten white teens have been charged in Anderson's death, and six have been sentenced so far in the crime.  Both Graves and Richards have pleaded guilty to conspiring to violate the federal hate crime law.  Young told them they could have saved her brother, rather than encouraging the situation that led to his death.  Both women have admitted to riding in the truck with Dedmon when Anderson was killed.

pussypassdenied,350bug,sarafromj,15,Tue May 19 19:58:39 2015 UTC,"That is a tough call. When I had my first kid I looked into this quite a bit. The general consensus it seems in most the west is to have them sleep alone. However, studies have shown improvements in many aspects from co-sleeping.   Stress hormones are lower in mothers and babies who co-sleep, specifically the balance of the stress hormone cortisol, the control of which is essential for a baby's healthy growth.[19][20][21] In studies with animals, infants who stayed close to their mothers had higher levels of growth hormones and enzymes necessary for brain and heart growth.[22][23] Also, the physiology of co-sleeping babies is more stable, including more stable temperatures, more regular heart rhythms, and fewer long pauses in breathing than babies who sleep alone.[24][25]  Besides physical developmental advantages, co-sleeping may also promote long-term emotional health. In long-term follow-up studies of infants who slept with their parents and those who slept alone, the children who co-slept were happier, less anxious, had higher self-esteem, were less likely to be afraid of sleep, had fewer behavioral problems, tended to be more comfortable with intimacy, and were generally more independent as adults.[26][27][28][29] Co-sleeping from birth or soon afterwards is the norm except in some Western cultures.

I've been working on a pedi floor for a while and the young (teenage) or unprepared mom's don't really take much heed of how much danger they place their child in.  I went in one room to do vitals actually last week and the girl was snoring and elbowed her 2 week old baby in the face and didn't even wake up while the child started screaming.

I've seen that before too, I was literally shaking the woman's should and she just flopped around, I thought there was something wrong with her until I saw her bottle next to the pull-out bed.

My mom volunteers for a group that helps victims find resources after an assault or suicide, and things like that. One of her calls was for a parent that rolled over onto their baby and smothered it in their sleep.  Everyone always says ""yeah, but I would never do that"". That's exactly what the people who do it thought, too.  Should also look into parents that leave their kids in the car accidentally and the child dies. Again, parents on the outside always say they would never do it, but so did the parents that did it. And they're not all single mothers that don't know who the father is, and clearly aren't responsible in the first place. There are lawyers, doctors, nurses, teachers, everything under the sun. There was a really interesting article I read about it in the past. It just takes one mistake in your brain, and that can happen to anyone."

pussypassdenied,34niwt,_DasDingo_,2,Wed May 6 16:51:17 2015 UTC,So we should just jail everyone who has been accused of a violent crime before proving that they are actually the culprit?   This is not an uncommon practice. The judge has to decide how likely the accused is to do something untoward.

If you do lock him up, you're taking away an untried person's freedom, although there is bail for a reason.

But the wikipedia article above is from a case where a woman murdered a man, was allowed to walk free before the trial, and killed her child in a murder-suicide. Like you said, murder and rape are different crimes, but 13 girls is a very significant number."

Turner drugged the infant and jumped into the Atlantic Ocean.  At the time, Turner had been released on bail and awarded custody of the infant even though she was in the process of being extradited to the United States to stand trial for the murder of Zachary's father, Andrew David Bagby.

No, you wouldn't, because no one in their right mind would.  He was held for a year.  Sucks, but that's how it goes.  You have no point."

pussypassdenied,34niwt,TheDyyd,3,Sun May 3 03:41:33 2015 UTC,"Sorry, that's not the way it works. You can only be held for 48 hours without charges, once you get charged the state must bring the defendant to trial within a some period of time, it's 90 days or less in most places (right to a speedy trial). At that point the defense will almost always ask for a continuance and it is always given. The prosecution can also ask for continuances, but their reasoning has to be more sound than what the defense gives in general. After this point there will be a number of continuance trails until both sides have the 'real' trial and show evidence or a plea is reached.  The man could have had his trial a long time ago. His lawyer told him not to unless he wanted to sit in jail for the rest of his life. End of story."
pussypassdenied,34niwt,imapeacockdangit,6,Sun May 3 03:47:53 2015 UTC,Yes but what is likely is the defendants lawyers would have asked him to request a slow trial so they had time to prepare and the trial was less of a witchhunt. Also to give the girls plenty of time to think about what they did and maybe change their mind. (Obviously unlikely due to the cunts being selfish and cowardly.)

So it was like 2-3 years after the damage occurred that one of the kids got popped for something else and squealed on everyone for a better deal.  Those kids who were all 12-15 at the time were charged criminally and forced to pay back restitution of over $60K divided 7 ways, so nearly $10,000 a kid.

You pretty much have to just use your noggin and come to a conclusion based off of what the testimonies had said.

pussypassdenied,34ldok,fckredditt,-32,Tue May 5 04:03:09 2015 UTC,"Yep, just finished jury duty on a case where the guy claims the victim (who was high on meth) started acting extremely sexual and made advances on him. They had sex once, but he was unable to penetrate. Later they tried again, but she was in much worse shape, stumbling, slurred speech, and incoherent thoughts. We found him guilty of sexual assault on the second try. It's a felony charge.  Edit: see below for clarification.  Edit 2: Since this seems to have ruffled some feathers, here is the rough story -  A homeless woman goes on a three day meth bender by injecting. She starts trying to come down off it, so she goes to a friends house, drinks half a bottle of whiskey through the afternoon, and then pops an ambien before sleeping for hours. She wakes up and gets aggressive as meth addicts are know for erratic behavior when coming down. Friend doesn't want none of that and threatens to have her committed to detox so she bolts.   The defendant is on his way to go fishing (at midnight), sees the woman, and stops to see if she's OK. She's days she's alright just high and can't sleep. He asks her if she needs a ride, she says she has no where to go, he offers to let her come with him until she figures out what to do. She gets in, they go to the lake and so far both stories match up, most importantly that she's awake.   She voices that she starting to feel weird, and asks to leave, he says sure. She says she lost track of time, but remembers them getting cozy in the car. Sex is attempted, but not achieved. He asks for a BJ instead, but she says no. He comes on her stomach. They both remember this. She says she wants to leave now, then passes out.   At this point she asked to leave, then this happened...  When she wakes up, she can't move presumably from the mixture of drugs in her system. She is being fingered roughly, there are mountains. She blocks out.  In his own statement, the defendant states that on the second attempt at sex he has to pull her from the car and assist her over to the grass. She is stumbling, walking cross legged, and isn't speaking any sense. He penetrates her this time but does not ejaculate. She is so gone now he can't get her back to the car. He walked away to figure out what to do only to come back and find witnesses taking pictures of his license plates. He gets in gets car and leaves.  Expert testimony proved there was sperm on her cervix. She was penetrated. She had scratches, escoriations, and abrasions on her vulva and labia.   I think they were both idiots. But later in an interview, the detective asked the defendant ""do you think she was able to consent (the second time)"" and he replied rather quickly with a no. 12 men and women ruled not guilty on the first count, guilty on the second."
pussypassdenied,34ldok,Burnt_P0Pcorn,5,Sat May 2 11:39:06 2015 UTC,"I just can't reconcile this. I agree that someone can't give consent when they are drugged out of their mind and he shouldn't have agreed to have sex with her. But he AGREED to it. As in she proposed it and he merely conceded. Again, I acknowledge that he shouldn't have, but to be convicted of sexual assault, be registered as a sex offender, an have the rest of his life ruined for it? I don't see how that's justified."
pussypassdenied,34ldok,Logan117,0,Sat May 2 16:14:13 2015 UTC,"I would have given him the benefit of the doubt except there was a recorded interview with a detective where the officer asks point blank ""do you think she could consent"" and he answer with ""no"". That was admission of guilt that he knew better the second time. The first count we found him not guilty because she was awake then, but he without a doubt had sex after she passed out. He admitted it."
pussypassdenied,34ldok,Burnt_P0Pcorn,2,Sat May 2 16:24:46 2015 UTC,"Hmm. So what if drugs weren't in the equation. What if she was sober, she initiated sex, then fell asleep during the act (it happens and not always due to fatigue). Would the man continuing to have sex with her equate to rape?"
pussypassdenied,34ldok,Logan117,0,Sat May 2 17:56:34 2015 UTC,"That why we ruled not guilty on the first count (the first sexual encounter), but then she asked to leave. It is after this request that she passes out and wakes up with him on top her. She is incapacitated. It is the fact that she asked to leave in conjunction with his admission later on to the detective that convinced us to render a guilty on the second count (second sexual encounter)."
pussypassdenied,34ldok,Burnt_P0Pcorn,2,Sat May 2 18:33:38 2015 UTC,"Ooooooh. Ok, so she asked to leave, passed out, and he had sex with her again. That's different. She removed consent. So just as he would have had to stop, even if she told him in the act she didn't want to anymore, as soon as she removed her consent, anything he does after that is sexual assault. Rape, actually.   You probably should include the in future telling a. The way you said it made it sound like they tried to have sex, she passed out, and he had sex with her while unconscious. The fact that she actually asked to leave is a very important distinguishing factor."

pussypassdenied,34ldok,doob-was-here,9,Sat May 2 12:53:50 2015 UTC,Not at all. I didn't sleep well for the two days it was going on. But the guy had sex with a woman who was nearly passed out coming down on meth. I was just reinforcing the dangers of having sex with people under the influence. Its a grey area.
pussypassdenied,34ldok,Burnt_P0Pcorn,13,Sat May 2 13:59:08 2015 UTC,"I don't understand.  She made advances on him and he's going to jail for it?  If I drive drunk, am I the victim of the car?  After all, I was under the influence -- even though I made the decision to drive.  The car merely went along with it.  Wait.  Is that why they put my car in impound?"
pussypassdenied,34ldok,gensyms,8,Sat May 2 16:06:04 2015 UTC,The car gets put into a foster garage by the automotive protection services
pussypassdenied,34ldok,kturt133,0,Sat May 2 16:59:11 2015 UTC,"This is absolutely a strawman.   I can consent to sex during one time, and not consent later. That's my choice. Just because the beginning of the encounter had her consenting, does not mean the rest did as well. At the point where she turns down a BJ, says she'd like to leave, and then passes the fuck out? You can surely assume she's not consenting to sex. No idea how that's unreasonable.   So yes, if you molest someone that's asleep, after they've denied your sexual advances, chances are you may go to jail, even if at one point they were into you. This is how stalkers are made."
pussypassdenied,34ldok,Sodiepawp,0,Sat May 2 22:34:13 2015 UTC,The person initiating is by definition also consenting.  It's not really all that complicated.
pussypassdenied,34ldok,gensyms,1 point,Sat May 2 23:24:01 2015 UTC,"Again, you can give consent, then deny it later. Refusing a sexual advance and falling asleep is a reasonable denial of consent. Again; refusing a sexual advance does not imply consent.  No means no. It's really not all that complicated."
pussypassdenied,34ldok,Sodiepawp,0,Sat May 2 23:32:14 2015 UTC,"Correct.  No means no.  Maybe I misunderstood the situation we're talking about.  I was under the impression the woman never withdrew consent -- but later regretted decisions she had willingly and enthusiastically made while high on meth.  And that having been high was used as a ""she couldn't have given consent"".  And to that, it is my opinion that if I'm to be held responsible for my decisions for example to drive while drunk -- she should also be responsible for the decisions she made while high on meth.  But if she did in fact withdraw consent, that changes everything."
pussypassdenied,34ldok,gensyms,2,Sun May 3 00:44:17 2015 UTC,"The comment was edited, you may not have seen this bit;    He asks for a BJ instead, but she says no. He comes on her stomach. They both remember this. She says she wants to leave now, then passes out.    I agree with you on changing your mind after the fact. You drunk with a drunk boy? Both agree on getting into it? Regret it afterwards? Too fucking bad. Consent is something that does not get to be revoked after the fact, it is either given or it isn't.   That said, it's her testimony that I quoted, so far as I know. I'd imagine there was supporting evidence to this. Also, the OP was posting it more as a cautionary tale for those who decide to do things with people in altered mindstates; be very careful."

Anyways please quote me on what I said that made you feel that I fucked her. I did wrestling for five years and I am pretty sure I know how it works where I wrestled, so why don't you get off your high horse, change your tampon, and go do some real research. Google is not the end all be all for research and you do not know what you are talking about and you are just making yourself look stupid. I already said I had a girlfriend who was wrestling at the time so why would I fuck another girl, and why would you think a girl who is 140 pounds is fat automatically?

pussypassdenied,34ixir,youdonotnome,1 point,Fri May 1 20:27:21 2015 UTC,"No.  Because my point is that when something is illegal, and you knowingly break that law, again, KNOWINGLY...you get punished.  For example, should weed be legal?  I think yes entirely.  It's a dumb law that's nothing but senseless and has no reason and has created so many more problems in the world than it's fixed I think.  But if I carry/smoke weed, knowing the laws, and get caught, I can't bitch and moan because I 100% understood what I did and knew what would happen.  I didn't have to do it."

Yes, but you can also break the law and if you get caught accept your punishment and still not agree with the law is what I was saying.  Bitching and moaning is just stupid, so we concur on that.  Also on the weed by the way, but that is a separate issue."

Fuck that judge.   Since he let her off in the end, you could say it was a good lesson, but if you enjoy the idea of that woman getting double the fine and a month in jail, you don't want to see pussy passes denied, you just want to see women stomped on."

Yeah this girl is dumb as a sack of rocks and she has shit manners, but this judge should not be able to charge her 5000 dollars for saying ""Adios"" which is litterally exactly what the judge said but in spanish.   The same goes for flipping him off, yes it's rude and incredibly offensive and incredibly stupid to do such a thing but honestly he just gave her some serious bull shit and he probably deserved worse.  There is no justice here, no pussy pass denied, just a judge on a power trip over a ditzy chick."

I was being arrested for some weed a while back and knew I really had nothing to say that would help me so I shut my mouth. They came up with a few charges, possession, drug abuse, obstruction of justice (they asked if I had ever been to jail, I said I had no answer, they took that as me saying no, which would have been a lie... I was an asshole from 18-21) and criminal mischief. Then, after hearing my rights they come up to the police window and ask me where I got it from, saying they don't have to charge me with everything if I help them.   Kept my mouth shut some more and the lawyer thanked me for it. It's a shame police can play judge by exaggerating what happened. They are providing a service. Go ahead and arrest me for what I was doing. Don't play detective and abuse your powers like that."

pussypassdenied,34ixir,Kilamonjaro,8,Fri May 22 17:46:59 2015 UTC,"She got a 5000 dollar fine for saying good bye in spanish. How the fuck is that reasonable? Flipping off a judge is not a smart response but i'd say its sort of substantiated given the context...  It's like you didn't even read what I said... white knighting.... yeah ok...  Sorry I don't think somebody should be taxed for being an idiot/ignorant, I mean she doesnt even have a lawyer to guide her."
pussypassdenied,34ixir,DoctorsHateHim,-9,Sat May 2 04:19:47 2015 UTC,Again what part of stupid are you? What context? Is it because the person has a pussy? And the judge is male?   How the fuck is that reasonable?   You brake the law you get punished. If you mock the law once caught shits and giggles happen.

This PERSON is getting a 5000 dollar charge for posessing a drug, that is bull shit, this PERSON is getting a 5000 dollar extra charge for saying good-bye in spanish, that is extortion, this PERSON is getting fucking jail time for expressing disdain, that's practically unconstituional.  She wasn't belligerent, she wasn't violent, and she certainly didn't try to use her gender to her advantage in any way shape or form. She was simply dumb which I would primarily attribute to drug abuse (she reminds me of a lot of friends who abuse drugs too much and become ditzy even when sober, most of them male) and she was unprofessional which I would attribute to a poor upraising and I honestly feel bad for her on both accounts. I would say the same if either characters in this play were of different gender.

pussypassdenied,34ixir,DiscreetMooseX,0,Sat May 2 06:56:17 2015 UTC,"I was with you until the part where you tried to excuse her flipping the judge off.  There is NO SITUATION where you can flip a judge in session off. NO SITUATION. She completely deserved the 30 days for contempt. If you are in a court, you respect the judge, flipping him off is insanely idiotic. Obviously the court cannot let that fly without losing its authority.  Apart from that I didn't see any reason for the judge to arbitrarily double the bond from 5k to 10k for simply saying adios, as I said, I am with you on this, that was completely arbitrary, but flipping off a judge is the stupidest response anyone can give to this."
pussypassdenied,34ixir,DiscreetMooseX,-6,Sat May 2 07:02:03 2015 UTC,"stop calling everybody who disagrees with you a ""whiteknight""   100% will do when you stop using as an argument the term autistic as an insult.    She was simply dumb   I 100% agree that she was a fucking idiot. But because her gender was female does not excuse that.  And once again what part of stupid are you? You bring drugs into this discourse.    She was simply dumb which I would primarily attribute to drug abuse   So that makes it okay?  One last time. What part of stupid are you?"
pussypassdenied,34ixir,Mustaka,-7,Tue May 12 08:33:48 2015 UTC,"I disagree, anyone who wants to act like this in a court setting should be taught a lesson... do you want ignorant people making a mockery of the united states court system?"
pussypassdenied,34ixir,gianlucarossi150,6,Sat May 2 07:15:46 2015 UTC,"do you want ignorant people making a mockery of the united states court system   Well the court system doesn't need help making a mockery of itself 90% of the time but I digress.  Do you really think it's right to punish people for being ignorant?  Maybe instead of getting angry at this person you could try sympathizing with her. She was unprofessional but I think thats more of an issue of how she was raised and I feel bad that her parents never taught her better. Also typically when you're in the kind of situation where saying one bad thing can cost you 5k+ you have somebody advising you on what to say aka a lawyer or public defender of some sort and she has none.  Now look at the situation she is in, she's getting charged 5k bail for fucking posession of a drug, that in itself is fucking rediculous. Then the part where she's getting questioned about how much her jewlery is worth, she could have easily just said ""I don't know how much it's worth"" and the effect would have been the same, she just didn't really get why he was asking, she seems a little drug addled. The point where the judge decides he needs to take a stand is when she fucking says ""Adios"" to his ""Bye-Bye"" and he fucking fines her 5k for that 5 thousand dollars. She said a formal way of good bye but in spanish to his childish ""bye-bye"" and somehow this fucking lunatic thinks its ok to charge her 5000 more dollars, I'd call that extortion.  If that shit happened to me I'd be outraged. I mean if saying farewell is cause for a 5000 dollar charge, what the fuck is she supposed to say? I obviously would never show such a public expression like that but that doesn't mean that he should be able to punish her simply for being stupid/ignorant. She wasn't violent, she wasn't unruly, and she didn't try to get off by being a girl, she just publicly showed disdain and that should be her right."
pussypassdenied,34ixir,zamwut,-7,Sat May 2 00:02:45 2015 UTC,"LOL you wrote an entire essay trying to defend your comment and you literally failed to provide a valid argument the entire time. The judge was simply disciplining her because he (and anyone with eyes) could obviously see that she wasn't taking anything seriously... nobody should sympathize for a spoiled brat.. at no point did she show ""disdain."" You should do some soul searching and understand the real reason why you are upset.. maybe because he was being culturally insensitive and you are sensitive to that because you are of spanish decent.. or you are a ghetto hood rat that listened in English class.

That's why she was booked with contempt of court. It's not because the judge was personally offended - the judge isn't just a guy sitting there, he represents the court and disrespecting him in most instances is disrespecting the court.

Saying adios shouldn't be contempt of court, but I guess you're one of those weird people who get easily offended :/. Not only was the judge wasting time, but abusing his power as well.

pussypassdenied,34ixir,boibig57,6,Sat May 2 00:01:16 2015 UTC,"The bit where the judge unprofessionally provoked her by being a xenophobic asshole and doubled her sentence which offended her and disenfranchised her against the legal system. ...especially the part where people are allowed to stand their ground under american law, regardless of who antagonizes them and the setting in which they are antagonized.  The judge had no right to act in such an unprofessional manner, Spanish is a major language in the united states and she has a constitutional right to express herself in an manner she likes. She could have said it in fucking nahuatl and it would have made no difference, she has that constitutional right.   There is nothing inherently offensive about answering goodbye with adios, as it means goodbye.  $5000 is wholly disproportionate as a response and completely shocking, in fact, the reasonable people who were witnessing this occur were audibly shocked that this had occurred, which indicates that this judge was just being unprofessional and his response of ""adios"" only confirms that he was being xenophobic    One might be inclined to become displeased with her cutsy manner and her actions, but it is clear that, on some level, she believed that doing such things would increase the chances of getting a lesser sentence and she has every right to appear in a manner that would help her case, after all, many defendants appear in court wearing formal attire to get juries to have a better impression of them and every little helps. So the judge cannot use her ditz act against her because that strategy might be a part of her defense and she has the right to defend herself in any way she can, just like anybody else can.  Plus: There is no law against being a ditz.    In summary, his actions were contemptible, he deserved the contempt she gave him and he abused his authority because he clearly looks down upon Spanish people."

The moment she threw that tea at him it's an assault. What he did wasn't self defense because she was backing off so that's an assault too making the whole incident mutual combat. Unfortunately the whole ""you don't hit girls thing"" plus the fact that she got fucked up worse probably landed this boy in a lot of trouble.   Edit: whether it was mutual combat or self defense my comment was meant to address the double standard in the courts and with law enforcement when a man is attacked by a woman."

Reading comprehension isn't your strong suit eh?   Well it's not, really.  Sure, they can be beaten up in videos like these but they don't HAVE to be.  The public humiliation and denial of what she wanted seems like it wasn't a pass.  Also no need for insults either man, just because we have different thoughts doesn't mean you have to be hostile like you are now.    where women are not allowed to use their gender as a handicap or an excuse to act like assholes.   She used her gender to escape a beatdown. The pass was not denied. I can't even imagine a man attempting this because he would know he'd get the shit kicked out of him.   You don't know the bouncer, maybe he doesn't want to start a fight with anyone of any gender.  Just because you're a bouncer doesn't mean you have to be starting a fight with everyone.  It's less trouble.  Either way you and I both don't know if the bouncer would've fought a guy or done the same thing and shoo'd him away.  You can't assume things you don't know because you aren't the bouncer."

pussypassdenied,34ebwe,Kazumara,3,Thu Apr 30 16:17:45 2015 UTC,I'm interested in the legal argument. She was very agressive no doubt but would she be considered enough of a threat that knocking her out would be deemed reasonable?  Edit: Now that the parent comment was deleted I need to provide some context. He was saying they would have even been within their legal right to knock her out. I'm just wondering about that. There is no doubt that they were within their legal right to defend themselves as they did in the video.
pussypassdenied,34ebwe,ImOP_need_nerf,8,Thu Apr 30 20:23:11 2015 UTC,"You have the right to defend yourself from attack. I'm not sure why you're drawing some distinction between knocking out or not. Self defense is not defined as having to subdue or restrain the other person. She could have gotten shot in some states and it would still count, almost certainly if she was a man. When you decide to assault and batter someone you should probably keep in mind that a concussion isn't the only thing on the menu of retaliation, you could lose an eye, break your neck, ribs, lose teeth, have a scar due to a cut on your face, etc. My advice is to avoid starting fights in general, never mind with much stronger and better trained individuals!"
pussypassdenied,34ebwe,Kazumara,2,Thu Apr 30 21:50:08 2015 UTC,why you're drawing some distinction   Well I'm asking if there is a distinction legally or if the right to defend themselfes includes the right to knock her out and is therefore not distinct.   She could have gotten shot in some states and it would still count   Are you kidding me? Is this true!?  Anyway is there no restriction concerning reasonableness of your reaction?
pussypassdenied,34ebwe,ImOP_need_nerf,1 point,Fri May 1 15:45:24 2015 UTC,"There are distinctions for lethal force in some cases, which punching people is not, but it's your right to defend yourself with any means necessary. Not everyone is strong, imagine if the situation was reversed - the big man was trying to overpower the small woman somewhere. Even in CA shooting him would most likely be justified. It gets more complicated when there is an expectation that you could have ran away in states like CA, and if you happen to be male versus a female or larger than your assailant you may have a harder time proving that you felt threatened. This varies by state but it's unreasonable to limit how someone should defend themselves from a physical attack out of consideration for the assailant."
pussypassdenied,34ebwe,Billistixx,3,Thu May 21 21:34:27 2015 UTC,What knock out? She was pushed on her ass.

pussypassdenied,34cz1c,JackYaos,13,Thu Apr 30 10:32:36 2015 UTC,"Strange. I personally work at a catholic school doing IT here in Australia, and the usual way to deal with students acting like this is to threaten to call their parents/have them suspend. This normally diffuses the situation, and if it becomes any worse then the principal is called down or an assistant principal.   Sure, the student was being an extremely rude bitch, but the fact that the teacher continued to berate her really shows how poorly he handled this situation. I also think the argument that he was acting in self defense is poor too, any teacher that is competent at their job wouldn't have reacted that way after a book is thrown at them.I feel as though he will lose his job after this video gains traction."

We have a database on these students so obtaining their parents number isn't hard for situations like this, and it's usually someone with higher authority in that school to make the call either way.

pussypassdenied,34cz1c,americnleprchaun,4,Thu Apr 30 15:23:14 2015 UTC,"This is a sticky situation for teachers in America. There are normally two issues that get in the way when a teacher needs to discipline a student like her in an area like that. The first and worst is that the parents just don't care. It's the reason she acts like that in the first place. No discipline in the home leads to no respect of any adult. The second problem is that if they suspend her she will more than likely just get in real trouble outside of class. Most teachers in these areas know what they are basically sending the student to prison or youth childbearing if they kick her out of class. The only way to help this girl is to keep her in class.   The worst part is that this girl only knows the one path. All her friends are having kids young or going to prison. It's the norm, so it doesn't register as a bad way to go through life."

What. The. Fuck.   I can only recall one instance of a student attacking a teacher at my old high school ( which is relatively big for the area, 2000+ students ) and he got expelled and even got arrested and went to our country's version of juvie. But in this case i'd be suprised if the teacher get's to keep his job. Because how dare he fight a woman whispers, in self defence   The lesson i learned is that if i have problems with a female i should hire a black trans woman to beat her up because a trans poc scores way higher on the opression chart than an upper clas white bitch so whatever shaquiranna does to her she is always the victim. and that white cis scum should be thankful, because now she know what it's like to be a trans poc and she should check her privelege."

Katz, a Washington, D.C., lawyer who specializes in gender discrimination suits, said Kleiner sounded a little punitive.  “If Kleiner wanted to look classy, it could have said, ‘This was hard fought and we obviously disagree with your view, but it’s in the interest of all parties to walk away. In the meantime, there have been lessons learned and we are going to fund organizations that focus on glass ceiling issues,’ ” Ms. Katz said.   As an attorney, accusing a company of a lack of ""class"" for protecting its own interests is the type of ridiculousness that only gets brought up because a woman like Pao can play the ""poor me, I'm being bullied"" card.  The fact that she's even getting the option of walking away and avoiding the countersuit is already partially due to the fact that she's a woman.  All too often, you'll see companies just call it a day and walk away because even the mention of a countersuit for legal fees can be trumped up into more bad PR."
pussypassdenied,33xdtq,Vlad_the_Imp,15,Mon Apr 27 02:53:06 2015 UTC,"Ms. Katz sounds like a twat. Ellen Pao costs them $1M, and they're supposed to just sit there and take it to look classy?"
pussypassdenied,33xdtq,AngryPurpleTeddyBear,25,Mon Apr 27 05:13:10 2015 UTC,"Ms. Katz is one of a generation of female lawyers who have made their name pretty much solely representing women in gender discrimination cases.  Every public comment they make is tailored to appeal to their bread and butter.  FFS, this is literally the first line of her bio on her firm's website:   My father says that I was born arguing about fairness and social justice issues, and that attending law school was just a formality."

Kleiner offered Ellen Pao a million-dollar settlement before the case began in earnest.  Lawyers like Katz often work on contingency, so they'll snag between 30-40% of that settlement if their client takes it - a $3-400K payday without a trial ain't bad.  EDIT: Interestingly enough, in the last decade, there's been a rise in ""men's issues"" attorneys - lawyers who specialize in representing men in divorce cases, custody battles, basically anywhere where gender can play a major role in the outcome of the case.  This is absolutely a direct response to lawyers like Katz."

Buy any toys or a house and it evaporates even faster.  You'd need to start accumulating assets that were tax efficient, earned decent returns, and increase in value.

pussypassdenied,33vfwt,Call_Me_Craig,6,Sun Apr 26 19:43:34 2015 UTC,"Is this sub really that far gone from reality that the only comment saying how a police office shouldn't hit someone holding a baby is downvoted to oblivion..   It's not a pussypass to not strike a woman hitting you who has a baby in her arms.  Just as if it were a guy he shouldn't be hititng someone with a baby in their arms.  I'm sure they have a procedure in place.   If the baby gets dropped and suffers brain damage then I guess it's fine because the mom was a bitch, totally the baby's fault."
pussypassdenied,33vfwt,ice_nine459,6,Tue Apr 28 14:01:54 2015 UTC,"I totally agree with you. If she wasn't holding the baby that would be different, but the cop didn't need to endanger the baby.  Just to clarify, I think the lady is a cunt and put her baby in danger, but the police officer didn't handle that amazingly."
pussypassdenied,33vfwt,treadcareful,5,Tue Apr 28 23:56:31 2015 UTC,"As a parent, it is your responsability to take care of your child and to make sure to not put him/her in a dangerous situation.   Either you don't have kids or you just don't want to understand but it's entirely the woman's fault for putting her child in that position and she should (and would) be responsaible for any danger happening to the baby.  As a parent of a 10month old, I would never EVER start shit with my baby around, let alone in my arms! What did you expect: Oh she has a baby fine slap me oh she's pulling out a knife: fine, stab me, you have a baby! No it's the other way around period, there is no grey zone here, she wilfully put her baby at risk and should lose the legal custody of her child because of it."
pussypassdenied,33vfwt,asaasa1983,1 point,Wed Apr 29 13:46:32 2015 UTC,"No, I agree she is at fault.  But you can't seriously argue that a woman holding a baby slapping you is the same as a woman holding a baby welding a knife?  Just because the woman is an ass hole, does that mean the police officer no longer has to worry about the baby's safety?   You can't pretend his life was seriously in danger by a slap from someone with one arm.  Again, just to clarify, I still think the mother is completely at fault - just saying, perhaps slapping her whilst she is holding a baby is not the BEST way to handle the situation."
pussypassdenied,33vfwt,treadcareful,3,Wed Apr 29 13:54:34 2015 UTC,"It's hard to say, a slap in the face can be hurtful and the situation can escalate fast. Seriously I would like to see the video continue instead of stopping when it did.  For all we know, he might have went to grab the baby to handcuff the lady. He didn't either exactly jump on her and pinned her to the ground.   And yes it's different than a knife weilding person but who knows if she had a weapon on her? Don't tell me that under the treath of violence (and god know what happened before and what she told him), you wouldn't react to it. We all say we wouldn't do this, we would be cold-headed enough to realise this or that but the reality is that when it happens, it all goes too fast for us to really grasp what is happening and the consequence to our actions."
pussypassdenied,33vfwt,asaasa1983,0,Wed Apr 29 14:05:05 2015 UTC,"Yeah, you make a good point. We can't really extrapolate too much information from such a small video."

pussypassdenied,33vfwt,dovidiela,2,Mon Apr 27 04:31:32 2015 UTC,"I would say it's even worst: the baby has no way of even TRYING to get out of the way. He can't do jack shit, he can't even voice his opposition (altough some human shields have little recourse in some situations).   The main reason why I say it's worst is because the parents are the ones supposed to help that little one to grow up and be safe while he learns about life and in this case she has ne problem putting him/her in a situation which could result in the death of the baby."

The secret service was using hollow point, which causes an explosive wound, as the third shot (to JFKs head) did. Couple that with the trajectory found by examining JFKs autopsy records and the reports that witnesses smelled gunpowder at ground level (something that could only happen if a shot was fired from ground level), and the case is solid."

pussypassdenied,33qxpi,3legged,5,Sat Apr 25 07:44:21 2015 UTC,"Hicks worked his way up from nothing, as a groundbreaking, progressive, counter culture, activist comedian, in the south. Battled, and beat drug addiction, major depressive disorder, and had to deal with these heinous people in dive bars and shit kicker holes in the walls. Throughout the bulk of his career he had to deal with shit like this on a daily basis, and the entire mechanics of a live, standup performance can be completely butt-fucked by a heckler. The slightest shift in tone, or alteration in timing will completely ruin a bit. His entire profession depended solely on his mood, and dynamic with the audience. What she did essentially sabotaged his entire routine, because she lacked the common decency, and tact to keep her cunting mouth shut. This is that mans paycheck, it takes a colossal amount of courage, and self confidence to do what he did, especially in the time he was doing it. I fully understand his reaction to that. You really should as well."

If you do have a man and women who are the same size the man will almost always be stronger   Depends on how you want to use the word size.   men have a greater muscle to fat ration   Yes. I admit I was mostly thinking of lean body weight/volume when I said size before.   and have testosterone.   So does women, albeit at lower amounts. Fun thinking exercise, can women take steroids?   Not to mention it's just genetics and evolution that that guy will be far stronger than a women the same size.   Assuming their lean body mass were the same, the differences in strength would stem from their skeletal structures and the leverages they give. The average man would have an advantage over the average woman were they the same height and lean body mass because of his wider shoulders. But again, depends on how you want to use the word size."

It doesn't account for aggression or speed and many other factors like maybe being able to take a punch. So it's not that easy.  Look at Mike Tyson, small 5'10"" no doubt he was skilled but his aggression and explosiveness made him dominate in the ring, he had a shorter reach than most of the people he fought. I have no doubt there was guys better skilled and more knowledgeable than him but he just dominated out of pure aggro."

I disagree with all parts in that statement. A lean girl has about the same size butt as men do, especially at that weight. Also the glutes are the major movers of the hip. If you don't think you use the hips when fighting you are sorely mistaken.   Nothing you say makes logical sense. You are just saying ""because of pussypass"" and it doesn't make sense.

And the reason dying females are demoralizing to men is the same as children, they aren't worthy warriors and because of this there is no reason to kill them, since they aren't a threat.   I would speculate that it is demoralizing because of our bias towards women as more innocent, loving and good.

Men are bigger on average, therefore stronger on average. But a woman is equally as strong as a man with the same cross section area of muscle as the woman (within a small margin of error).   Yes men on average are bigger   and therefore on average stronger.

Besides they do differ a lot within the sexes, because it is both highly individual on a genetic level, but also from an environmental/dietary influences. I had a girl in my class in seventh to ninth grade that was a fucking hulk, beefier than half the guys in the class.

The only thing they don't deserve is to live any of the remainder of their life outside of prison.  I'm undecided about whether there should be a death penalty. But if we're gonna have it, these are the kinds of things it should be used for.  From an article I found on them.....   By the time paramedics reached Serenity, she was already dead but had been placed on ice and exposed to bleach in desperate attempts to revive her. Assistant Solicitor Elizabeth Gordon said the girl's injuries reflected weeks of torture -- a duration that matched the amount of time the child had spent with Butts and Cunningham.  ""There was not a plane of her body that was spared, save the soles of her feet,"" Gordon said.  Circuit Judge Deadra Jefferson said the photos of Serenity's injuries showed a child ""systematically beaten to death.""  ""I've never had anything affect me as profoundly as the pictures I've viewed of this child,"" Jefferson said. She noted that the women could have stopped, could have saved Serenity.  Jefferson also suggested that perhaps the women frightened the potty-trained child into urinating uncontrollably. The prosecutor noted that one pelvic injury likely caused Serenity to lose bladder control.    Yeah,...fuck them."

pussypassdenied,333rfp,jamesd33n,-4,Tue Apr 21 02:43:06 2015 UTC,"I wanna weigh in here with a certain aspect I think deserves to be a key variable: relationship to the man.  In OP's scenarios, I'm picturing some stranger, a woman I don't know (like subway heel girl) behaving belligerently/aggressively and hitting a complete stranger. That calls for self-defense and putting a stop to it. Which is funny because the only force that may even be needed could be a slight shove and yelling ""Please don't touch me."" They're women, not bears. (Good luck convincing anyone to not hear ""haymaker"" when you say ""reasonable force."")  But as the poster above described, it's another story when your girlfriend slaps you for saying something out of line (was that the actual reason for getting slapped?). That doesn't call for getting slapped back, imo. I'd be pissed off for sure, but I'd more than likely walk away and just say ""I apologize for what I said but that wasn't cool, I'm leaving.""  There's a graduated scale here that slides pretty slowly towards the ""hitting"" zone with someone familiar to you and much quicker with someone you don't know.  I also think I know where the OP from the Yik-Yak conversation was mentally as well: in his head, he never ends up having an abusive relationship or a shitty run-in with an aggressive stranger and therefore can't put the image in his head of being cornered by unnecessary violence. He only sees butterflies. But there may come a time when he'll feel extremely slighted by the actions a woman has towards him and him having refused to act. Realistically, he has probably never had a relationship except in his fantasy land.  It's pretty fucking grey territory discussing this because as a member of the camp that does allow a man to hit a woman, I'd also be thrown in a box without the other person thinking about how many variables would have to come into play perfectly to create the storm wherein I'll defend myself using the minimal level of my strength needed. Hell, I'd probably only go as far as to grab her wrists and tell her she needs to act like a lady and use her words, not act like a man.  Sorry, OP, it's tough waters to navigate these days. Luckily, with people like Whoopie telling the world they're fucked up and wrong, we may be able to see a change in the future where women get back to acting like ladies and men understand the difference between ""protecting yourself by using only the force necessary to put a stop to it"" and ""throwing a haymaker.""  edit: ninja'd a few words"

While I would most likely retaliate against someone who hit me regardless of gender, proportional response would be a moot point if it were a male stranger that hit me.  It would be all out warfare.  If it were a friend, partner, or female stranger that hit me it would be a response proportional to the attack.

If you stoop to that level, you have to be ready for retaliation.  The slap is not some sort of a brilliant strategic move that leaves you immune to future physical contact.  There are of course plenty of exceptions to the above: If it's a child doing the slapping, someone doing it playfully, a mentally handicapped person, a senior, an awfully weak person..  I'm not just going to deck a kid across the face..  but if an able adult does it with the intention to cause pain and/or harm, then my gentleman gloves come off.

I pick the bottle up give it to him again and he once again drops it onto the ground. So I decide that I'm not going to give it to him again because I don't want to be picking bottles up for the next hour and ,more importantly, I don't think its cute or funny.  So there I am with the bottle at my side, my son going crazy trying to get to it so he can throw it again and this woman (who I've never seen) comes up to me and starts telling me to give my son the bottle. I politely explain the situation and she's getting more and more angry ""You don't withhold food from children as punishment!"" was repeated by her more then once. My son is still going for the bottle so I decide that its easier to show the yelling woman whats going on then keep arguing. I give my kid the bottle he stops crying, throws the bottle on the floor and starts crying again.  I thought that this was the end of it as I walked away, but the woman kept following me letting me know that I'm abusing my son that she will have him taken away from me etc... I ignore her because I'm almost done with shopping and I felt that if I kept talking to her then I'd lose my cool.  She's still following me and lecturing me and I continue to ignore her. I'm near the end of my shopping list I bend over to pick up something on the bottom shelf and this woman decided that she is going to take my son from me. From the corner of my eye I she her reaching for the buckle and I just freaked out in panic and hit her square in the chest as hard as I could (I'm 6'4 and 270 at that point). She goes flying into a display stand everything falls over, and I'm just absolutely full of fury and rage. I yell at the top of my lungs to never try and touch my child again. And I walk down the rest of the isle out of sight of this woman when some store employees let me know that the cops have been called.  Cops came people gave statements and all was good.  They were more upset with the woman reaching for my son then me hitting her.  Edit: Thank you for the gold anonymous stranger!"

pussypassdenied,333rfp,bryanrobh,76,Sun Apr 19 14:31:31 2015 UTC,"I think this type of behavior bothers me the most when it comes to women and/or children. Being a man does not make you any less qualified to care for a child nor does it make you incapable of speaking to children. She made 0 effort to use her brain and just went 100% ""Men are shit at parenting, therefore he can't possibly know anything"" and nothing else. Men have this stigma with children because of the hysteria caused by a wrongly held belief that all men are pedos and woman beaters.   An example, my girlfriend will goes to this little park some days when she's waiting for me to get off work and talks with a bunch of neighborhood children and lets them play with her pet rats. It has a sign posted no one over the age of 12 is allowed and cops drive by every so often. One of the little girls told her the other day she shouldn't be there but it was ok because she was a woman. It's ok just because of that. Cops go by and don't do anything. She's clearly not a child.   Me on the other hand, I would get dirty looks being friendly to children at previous jobs and I see too many stories where fathers go through similar things you have and it's so sad. Children have often approached me and are usually very friendly and respectful and I try to treat them as their own persons because, they are, only to be verbally chastised or the child being told not to go near me. You're a man, you can't care for children and you're only an abuser. I don't remember the numbers but I know I read a study that showed women abuse children more often than men do. You only ever hear about the men in the news though. The women almost always have excuses made for them or blame pushed to a 3rd party.  On the bright side, I do see stories like yours more and more where common sense does prevail and the person acting crazy doesn't get a pass. So maybe it's changing. Change is always slow though."

Being a single dad of 2 this was one of the things that used to bother me a lot.  When I kicked the ex out and I went to tell the school of the new arrangement they had some difficulties believing that the kids were going to be staying with me.  The secretary took about 10 minutes to figure out that yes the primary residence is still my home and I am still the primary contact but their mom has moved and is secondary.     With the school its now kind of funny to me because they have noticed that the incidents of  missing school work, lunches, winter clothing all coincide with the times that the kids are with their mom.  Not only that but there is now a large note in both my kids files that says no matter what the issue is call the dad first."

To my surprise a number of individuals supported my stance.  Their (WKs) reaction was to hit me with insults, that I wasn't a real man, that I was raised in a bad family, that I'm a psychopath (typical femenist tactics). That I couldn't get dates or lived in the basement of my mum's house.  Yet they couldn't square the hole that not hitting back is NOT equality and essentially said they would beat up any man they saw acting aggressively towards a woman even if it was her fault entirely and she had hit the man in question many times or was even using a weapon."

It was pretty obvious what was going on and she was very uncomfortable. I told him to knock it off and leave her alone blah blah blah. He ignored me so I pushed him into the wall so she could get away. He ended up putting me in a choke hold and the other girl ran to get a teacher.   There was not one point where I didn't know what I was getting into, and a choke hold was not as bad as what I was expecting to happen.

The point I was making was that it makes absolutely no difference whether she is male or female with regards to her take on the subject matter. Stop and think about that for just a minute.   Completely remove gender from the equation. So someone hits someone, right? The person hit has every right to defend themselves. Correct? I think that's where we all land. We share common ground. Fantastic.  Take this one step further by looking at how someone's gender plays into which side of the argument they land on. The fact that she is female should add no weight to her stance. What difference does it make? What is the significance of her stating ""I'm a woman""? I'll tell you... It's a tactic used for 1 of 2 things:   To draw attention to herself and garner your admiration simply because she is a female operating in a male space. A pussy pass. She knows you'll agree with her for 1 of 2 reasons:   If you're female you agree with her because you're both females (teehee, GIRL POWER!!!) If you're male you agree with her because vagina and mammary glands    Stating ""as a female"" in arguments is nothing more than trying to stack the deck. It's cheap and used far too often.

pussypassdenied,333rfp,Totsean,15,Sun Apr 19 23:48:34 2015 UTC,"I was taught growing up that men did not hit women.  That being said, women today have evolved to the point where they act like men.  They talk like men, act like men and have the ego's of men, all-the-while expecting that they should fall into the category 'hands off' due to being a woman.   Just last month I saw an altercation in a parking lot where a girl got out of the passenger seat of a car to berate a guy for some unknown slight.  They guy was looking at her confused at the start but I could see the confusion change to anger due to the verbal assault.  When she pushed him, he broke and he gave her a right cross to the jaw.  I put him in a choke hold until the cops came and then went to his defence with the cops telling them that her verbal and physical assault is what perpetuated his reaction.  As the situation diffused, I went over to her and said next time, if you want to act tough, maybe you should actually be tough.    She gave me the finger...."
pussypassdenied,333rfp,Long-Schlong-Silvers,7,Mon Apr 20 00:12:07 2015 UTC,"Now Im not hating, but why exactly did you put the guy in a chokehold when he responded to his aggressor? I would get it if he continued hitting after she was incapacitated, but otherwise it sounds like you could have made the situation a whole lot worse for everyone. I know if another person tried to chokehold me directly after a separate physical altercation, I would get scared and most likely pull a ccw."

As with many things I appreciate that my experience is very limited.    I feel like if there was an immediate threat to myself or someone I care about I would use reasonable force in defence, but I don't necessarily think hitting someone back is much of an answer in most cases, and I try to live as much of my life as I can by Dr. King's words:  Returning violence for violence multiplies violence,  adding deeper darkness to a night already devoid of stars.  If you're in a position where a woman has hit you and you can genuinely see no alternative but to fight in your own defence, then no one can really argue with you.  If you're hitting someone back to prove a point about equality, I think that message will be lost for lack of a better medium."

I cannot find any links that show this to be required for the health of a herd or any purpose of wilderness conservation. These big game hunts are normally established for financial gain. A country's game sanctuaries could argue that value of revenue vs. the life of 1 animal. But, there is no sport in hunting a giraffe. I am glad she was called out for the bullshit she spewed.

He was surely going to die soon regardless. She fed the people in a village near by and they used every part of it's body.  She didn't 'cold heartedly murder' that giraffe. She helped people.

Kind of odd that people charge others to kill animals just so they can save many more but I get the logic behind it.  If you charge people to hunt in an area and only let them kill specific animals then you can control population growth and use the money to hire mercenaries/security to protect the habitat.

pussypassdenied,332upa,LambKyle,-1,Sun Apr 19 06:14:01 2015 UTC,I'm an American. British comedy is a complete different genre from traditional comedy in the states. Very dry humor.

pussypassdenied,332upa,Surf_Or_Die,0,Tue Apr 21 05:23:19 2015 UTC,Every comedian doesn't go after women publicly because they hunt either.
pussypassdenied,332upa,Junoh315,3,Tue Apr 21 11:20:49 2015 UTC,Only valid if you hunt cave man style with a spear. If you bring a gun you're a pussy.
pussypassdenied,332upa,one_comment_only,5,Tue Apr 21 16:45:35 2015 UTC,A spear isn't necessary.  Hunting with a bow and arrow would be more interesting.  Especially if you have to make the bow and arrows yourself while you're hunting.
pussypassdenied,332upa,upinyabax,1 point,Tue Apr 21 17:12:07 2015 UTC,Only valid if you hunt cave man style with a spear. If you bring a gun you're a pussy.

pussypassdenied,332upa,bikersquid,3,Tue Apr 21 18:44:17 2015 UTC,What weapon can you hunt with that you don't have to be accurate with it? Dynamite?

pussypassdenied,332upa,Surf_Or_Die,1 point,Sun Apr 19 07:07:05 2015 UTC,Its illegal in most states to hunt game animals with primitive weapons. States have minimum artillery laws for the benefit of the animals. Hit a deer with a spear and its gonna run off and bleed out in pain for hours possibly days before dying. Hit it with a .270 and its going to have a quick humane death. Quit spewing your garbage opinions.
pussypassdenied,332upa,DrengRedBeard,1 point,Sun Apr 19 09:46:04 2015 UTC,Who said anything about deer? I wanna see you hunt a bear with a spear.
pussypassdenied,332upa,Surf_Or_Die,1 point,Sun Apr 19 07:49:14 2015 UTC,"The rules apply to bear as well. Bear is a game animal with specific hunting seasons. The fact is, most states will not allow you to even attempt to hunt any animal with ""spears"". These laws are for the benefit of the animals. So your logic is backwards. You'd rather people maim animals with spears and leave them suffering than cleanly killing them with rifles and harvesting the meat... Doesn't make any sense."
pussypassdenied,332upa,DrengRedBeard,0,Sun Apr 19 12:58:14 2015 UTC,It makes perfect sense. Hunting with a gun is like fishing with a nuclear bomb. It can't e in be considered a sport. There's no aspect of competition. Just because a law exists it doesn't make it right. I dgaf about what the laws are. This is a theoretical discussion.
pussypassdenied,332upa,DrengRedBeard,2,Sun Apr 19 10:56:02 2015 UTC,So there should be no laws about minimum weaponry when taking animals. Just stab them with sticks. And you think this is better for game?

Hunting and killing an endangered animal is pretty shitty, but some places will let you do it to help fund the sanctuaries they have built.

This company has a horrible reputation, like most tow companies. We have one in our town that's the same way. They aren't there to service the lots they get contracts with. They are there to take any car they can, many times illegally. They bully the drivers into accepting the fact that if they don't pay, they will keep the clock running and run up their bill as high as they can, while pointing out that no one will help them.

Yeah, she wanted her phone back, asked, he didn't comply. Should he have given the phone back to begin with? Absolutely, it would've avoided everthing.   But this isn't about who's in the right. PPD isn't about using gender to get something. It's about using gender as a protection. This bitch's gender did not protect her from his retaliation."

If you saw some guy steal a womans purse and start running off with it would you try and talk him into giving it back? No you tackle him and take it back.   If someone took something of yours from you in front of you would you really not try and forcibly take it back?

pussypassdenied,32wsey,Blitzdrive,4,Fri Apr 17 21:14:58 2015 UTC,"Absolutely false.  She would most likely face assault and battery charges regardless of the phone.    In this case, we don't even know that it was her phone.  Could have easily been his phone that he let her use and she now thinks it belongs to her.  Don't know.

pussypassdenied,32wsey,Buzz_Killington_III,-3,Fri Apr 17 21:33:49 2015 UTC,"By that logic we could say ""we don't even know if she cheated on him"". So you're pulling at needless strings to assume things outside of the context of the video. What we can fairly assume is that is her phone and that she did cheat on him and that's it.    Your statement is absolutely silly, you can absolutely fight a burglar/thief without legal repercussion.  The legal repercussion would come with if you killed them without proper cause like protecting yourself or others.   I've known many people who've beaten up thieves who were later caught, you know how many got charged with assault? None cause that's fucking retarded.   By your logic a woman in a mall has a man come and try and pull her purse away, she tries hitting him to make her let go, he smashes across the face and breaks her jaw but she had it coming because she swung first. Ya that's some good logic right there."

All of the other example are useless and describe completely different examples regarding strangers and homes that aren't applicable.  This is about what happened in the video, which would most likely be considered a domestic dispute with domestic violence.  Even if not, he's not a stranger.  She knows his name, where he lives, and probably everything else about him.  If we're going to use an unrelated example, it would be most like your friend stealing your bike and taking it home.  The next day you find out who it is, and the right course of action is to call the police.  If you go over to his house and knock him out to bring your bike back, it's still an assault and battery charge."

His response even made her care less about her phone.  She started a fight that she expected to end with the starting punch.

Yeah... no  If she had acted surprised that he would do that because she is a woman then it would have been ppd (To be fair the video was kind of short but we shouldn't make baseless assumptions)  But in this case all that really happened was a fight between two people which would have gone the same way if it was two blokes fighting"
pussypassdenied,32wsey,hithisismark,3,Fri Apr 17 13:14:00 2015 UTC,"That's exactly how it works. Women expect to not get hit by men because that is what society has said for decades. When people started banning wife-beating (which I am NOT condoning), it flipped the table completely,  and now there's this stigma about how if you and your girl get into it, and she beats the shit out of you, but you hit her once in retaliation, and oh my God, you're a horrible abusive wife beater, and you probably get put on some kind of list. Tell me it's not true. You can't.  Oh and believe me, she was surprised. She instantly stood down and backed away. If she was ready for it, she would've jumped back in, and we'd have had a full on brawl going."

And if you don't think a man can take a punch, you're all kinds of fucked up. There is an entire sport dedicated to throwing and taking punches."
pussypassdenied,32wsey,Cyntheon,3,Fri Apr 17 14:26:07 2015 UTC,"No, the act of her hitting him and thinking that she will suffer no repercussions for her actions is a pussypass, which is not indicated at all in the video  Are you being sarcastic with your last comment? Women box too you know, though that's still a moot point seeing as just because people box doesn't mean that all people can take punches like a pro boxer. That's a pretty stupid argument lol"
pussypassdenied,32wsey,emotionalboys2001,0,Fri Apr 17 14:39:10 2015 UTC,"Come on now, do you really think she thought he might hit back? In this day and age. Women do. Not. Expect. To be hit. God, she could probably file a police report saying he beat her, regardless of the fact that she hit him first, and if she gets the right judge, he'll get prison or whatever. I'm not saying it's right, I'm saying that's how it is.   Because women are fragile creatures. /s  What I'm saying is that most men would hit back. We're proud creatures. If you hit me, you best believe I'm coming back at you. Whether or not you hit me hard. I'm not going down until I'm out. That's how we are.

pussypassdenied,331gfr,Cybugger,2,Tue May 5 10:00:38 2015 UTC,"I think we should be able to draw whatever the hell we want. ""Being offended"" is a crap excuse. Freedom of speech trumps not wanting to step on any toes. It's a fundamental human law in western democracies that we are allowed to poke fun at, make satire of anything we desire. Obviously, freedom of speech is not just boiled down to that, but in the context of your question, it is the most pertinent aspect of freedom of speech.  People make satirical cartoons of Christianity, Judaism, political parties, celebrities, corportations, media outlets, etc... There is absolutely no reason that Islam should be above being satirised. None whatsoever."
pussypassdenied,331gfr,Murtank,2,Tue May 5 10:06:38 2015 UTC,"Cool , and agreed  Was just wondering because i have seen way too many hypocrites who want the right to burn a flag but refuse anyone elses right to offend a minority"
pussypassdenied,331gfr,Cybugger,2,Tue May 5 10:11:21 2015 UTC,"Well, I don't think that one should aim to offend a minority, if that's your goal. Offense for the sake of offense is pretty pointless in my opinion. However, that's just me.   And also, I would never attempt to take away someone's right to offend. If someone gets a law passed stating that we're no longer allowed to poke fun at Muhammed, or Allah, well... then we can't critisize the Christian faith, and poke fun at catholic priests molesting children.... Or Judaism for mutlilating penises for no reason other than tradition... Or the Republican party for allying with the Tea Party, and thus having representatives who have the IQ of a cucumber... Or the Democratic party for being a bunch of spineless corporate shills... Or anything really."

The sharks have agreed for so long not to use their teeth, that the fuckin tuna think they can just run shit.  Guy's like Bill Burr and Patrice O'neil (RIP) joke about the shit, but I would genuinely prefer a world where women didn't feel quite so secure in shitting on or disrespecting others right to their faces.   Don't get me wrong; fuck those people, I love America and there are better ways to work toward the changes they want.  BUT, I would never for a second think that I could walk into the middle of a group of black dudes and just take their shit.  Not just because it's their fuckin right in this country, but because they also might just beat my ass.  I understand this potential consequence: this cunt acts like it's an impossibility and no one should get to act that way.  We should all have to treat each other with an ""I could get punched in the face"" level of respect.

It was a criminal accusation to try and get some victim publicity.  Amazing how she downplays this, while saying it's ok in the most twisted way ever, AND tries to just say ""don't use this as a counter argument to a female rights issue"" or something. Fuck you Sarah Silverman.  Unrelated by don't forget Ellen Pao is criminal who stole money from Fireman's pensions and tried to get 12 women fired to build her case for sexism at her last company - Let me tell you a story reddit, about your current interim CEO who is trying to keep the job:  Read 1: Ellen Pao (reddit interim CEO) COURT DOCS, they are funny and strange  OR READ THIS LOLSOME 7 COMMENT CHRONOLOGICAL BREAKDOWN OF THE COURT DOCS:  Read 2: Seven comment breakdown of COURT DOCS, cross referenced by year with lots of lulz  le story:  The current (before she is in prison) reddit joke CEO is Ellen Pao, as of a few weeks ago when Yishan Wong, (who personally hired her and put her forward for the CEO position, and has totally not had sex with her either, honest, he's married, she wouldn't do that) stepped down instantly without warning... and she was instated within the week. Unheard of.  Ellen Pao, a psychotic and entitled monster who is being investigated by the SEC and FBI along with her hubby for their role in a ponzi scheme ripping people off. Ellen Pao is fraudulently suing their previous employer to get some go-money as she is:   Bankrupt Illiquid In massive debt Any other synonyms for fucked?   But, guess what? Order now and we'll throw in a pre-trial injunction that forbids the discussion of Ellen Pao's financial situation. Right. Because the fact that she has negative net worth and zero liquidity despite her charity position at reddit has no bearing on a $16M hail mary. (those gilds on this comment are literally paying for her lawyers' coffees... I le sigh).  While doing so she is taking every chance to shit on every woman who has truly suffered discrimination at their job.  Ellen Pao is trying to characterize a relationship she had while at the company as ""almost"" rape, saying she ""succumbed to advances""... and ""while it wasn't rape, it was consensual... not rape... did I say rape enough yet?"":    She invited the guy out for dinner she said he was her hero and his mind was amazing she bought him chocolates she admitted she loved him   wanted to marry him wanted to have kids with him  FYI: She never said this was rape, in fact she has MANY MANY TIMES, said ""it was not rape"". You know. Like a suspicious number of times. Which is weird. She usually says it like ""it was entirely consensual dot dot dot"", or ""it wasn't rape at all dot dot dot"". Like, I don't know, there's something sinister and almost rapey about her having sex with someone if he didn't leave his wife for her afterwards. Or she just wants the words ""not rape"" and ""wasn't non-consensual"" on the jury's mind.   But, wait for it. They had sex... and you know what that means in her mind. Entitlement.  So it turns out HE DECIDED NOT TO LEAVE HIS WIFE FOR HER. Ellen Pao seduced (sorry, succumbed to the advances of, and clearly someone who cannot make their own sober decisions about which dick to suck, needs to be a CEO. I know many (many) women who are capable of saying no to sucking dick (someone hold me...)) and screwed a married guy at work, then got antsy when he didn't leave his wife.  Wait... but that can't be true, I just said she didn't have sex with Yishan Wong, because he's married and... wait. Just to be clear *moves mic closer* Yishan Wong did not have sexual relations with Ellen Pao. Allegedly. I mean.  The current Reddit CEO Ellen Pao totally did not have sex with the last Reddit CEO Yishan Wong, just making that clear in case anyone else reads between the lines and gets the wrong idea, ALSO Ellen Pao DID NOT RAPE Yishan Wong. I know I probably shouldn't even bring it up, but I just want to be clear on that.  She didn't rape him, but you see the effect first hand now. Seriously though guys, this rumor should not get out of hand. It's probably salubrious and prophylactic just to casually mention that Ellen Pao did not rape Yishan Wong to get the CEO position. I mean, let's nip this rumor in the bud, before it spreads. Let's get ahead of it.  Edit: I've heard rumors that huffingtonpost is going to run the rape allegation story, that seems a bit unfair, we really shouldn't let this get out of hand.  She also did not promise him a cut of her ""winnings"" of $16,000,000 if he stepped down his reddit position (poorly paid one at that) and vie for ten years salary payment from her instead, by making her a ""CEO"", although a joke title here at le reddits, it looks good for her case.  oooooh snap! *Maury-I am not the father dance*  So when he decided not to leave his wife for her after a brief fling, she is on record showing she spent FIVE YEARS deliberately trying to stir shit up, how much shit? Literally 200,000 pieces of paper. She's trying to win the old hail-mary sue my company by a sheer volume of attack, combined with five years of only keeping emails and parts of reply chains that gave a context to her being ""shunned"". She goads people and tries her damnedest to cause conflict to get it on record. AND FAILS!  So she thinks that she has 200,000 throws of the dice to win this case. It doesn't work that way.   She was paid MORE than her male colleagues Given the best mentorship, guidance and coaching from the most reknown and expensive coaches She had hundreds of complaints filed against her from WOMEN in the organization, that she MASSIVELY discriminated against filing poor reviews and criticisms and complaints against almost all women she worked with. She has emails showing her taking advice from lawyers back in 2008, then one friend of hers saying ""delete all emails except those you can use to try and sway your case"". So she did that. For five years. Her complains amount to: I was made to sit at the back and take notes. Despite only doing that on ONE occasion and actually spending the first days in the front row, people not letting me in to their deals... after people complaining she was always trying to get into deals after the research and diligence was done, instead of coming up with her own ideas. That's it, literally it. She was offered her dream job, the job she wrote she wanted, when she was found to have failed EVERY SINGLE employee assessment for five years running, and missing EVERY TARGET. She refused, knowing it would hurt her CASE she had been building if she accepted. She starts suing them while working there, being extremely abrasive, basically like Westboro Baptist abrasive, while trying to goad someone to make a move that would help her case. Nobody did. As SOON as she complained they hired an investigator for her, literally within a minute, to help her. She refused to speak to the investigator they hired to HELP HER, while she was preparing her case, and finally did ONLY WITH HER OWN LAWYER PRESENT lol.   So she wanted to paint a picture of her being oppressed. What a sad fuck. Pissing in the face of every hard working person and shitting on the progress so many amazingly talented women have made.  Ellen Pao also lied and sabotaged 12 women's promising careers just to make sure they weren't promoted as this would have damaged her case - she had a lawyer on retainer since 2008, and spent 5-7 years trying to frame a company for things they didn't do.  That's right Ellen Pao, shit into the mouths of all those professional women who would never stoop to such dirty fraud to get ahead.   #2girls1CEO  Ellen Pao wants someone to gild her $16,000,000-$150,000,000 because she fucked a married guy, they talked about him leaving his wife and marrying her and having kids, he didn't... somehow that entitles her to $150,000,000, and it's totally not a hail-mary because she's going to prison. When the SEC / FBI get through untangling the ponzi scheme in the Caymans.  $150,000,000 is also the amount that Buddy Fletcher and her have stolen from Firefighters pension funds. Pensions, for people who risk their lives to save people in a fire. People who actually are the only service people who have a mandate to save human life (police don't).

This times article has a bunch of sources in the section about the wage gap.  Personally, just about every organization tries to use false and exaggerated data. Its pretty much human nature. I think feminism can get away with it because criticizing their statistics is considered the same as criticizing their goals, which when taken at face value are entirely noble.   Is one in three or four women raped? No. Are women $.77 what men are? No. Is it sexist to argue against using the BS stats? It seems most of them will say yes. I've actually seen a few come outright and say it on posts about the stat manipulating, that it doesn't matter if the data is wrong because you are still trying to discredit stats that bring changes to help women, and therefore you are doing something immoral."

As someone who has been doing concert production for a long time, this fucking cunt has no right to have kids. The kid being crushed issue aside, she has a little baby in a facility that can severely damage a babies ear drums. I wouldn't be surprised if that childs hearing is already fucked and that child will have to live with the results of that dumb cunts ignorance for the rest of her life. I don't even work shows without hearing protection anymore because I know what it can do and I already have to live with tinnitus.  Fuck parents who don't care."

I skimmed in the video, he explains the venue owner wants her to SIT, not be in the dancing crowd, or leave, I think a refund is a bit much too, but they'd save it in the time it takes to reply to her emails / deal with the other cows on social media."

Just because it didn't happen before, doesn't mean it can't happen now or in the future. Fucking dumbass."

pussypassdenied,32rlbw,DonaldBlake,-31,Sat May 23 20:04:45 2015 UTC,"Everything is fine up until she tries to find out the name of the DA and their badge numbers. Then they ""threaten"" her with a CPS investigation. That is just wrong. If they were going to let her go without involving CPS before, her reasonable request for their badge numbers and the name of the DA should not change that. She is being antagonistic, but the cops should be above petty things like revenge, especially when involving CPS can really screw up someone's life. I should be able to walk up to any cop anywhere and ask for their badge number no matter what they are doing without fear of reprisal. The fact that they started to threaten her with CPS after she asked for the name of the DA tells me that maybe they didn't run it by the DA in the middle of the night before approaching her for removal and they didn't want to end up caught in that lie. So, yeah, she is mildly wrong for exposing the baby the concert, though I can't say she was putting it in danger since the baby was in no obvious distress and considering how sensitive baby ears are, they will let you know if something is too loud for them. But the cops should have behaved better towards the end as well. Sadly, two wrongs don't make a right."
pussypassdenied,32rlbw,ntsp00,16,Thu Apr 16 07:42:28 2015 UTC,"It's like this.  If you want to be an asshole when I'm doing nothing more than looking out for the best interest in your child, then yes, I can be an asshole too.  I completely understand her being upset with having to leave since she doesn't feel like shes harming her baby, which she's doing with the loud music alone.  They could have taken those steps initially but chose to handle it professionally.   I don't agree with having her name/dob on the internet like it is, spelled out.  Our DA had an on call attorney on every night of the week so it's not far fetched that they would call to make sure that they had the legal authority to remove her.    I will go on to say that since he told her he would give her his badge number and name, he should follow through with it anyway."
pussypassdenied,32rlbw,DonaldBlake,-19,Thu Apr 16 15:40:40 2015 UTC,"If the baby was in distress from the loud music, it would likely be crying and probably not sleeping comfortably. If I could easily hear the conversation going on between the cop and woman, the music wasn't all that loud. But if the people in charge of the concert wanted her removed for their own liability reasons, that is fine. But when she asks the cops for their badge numbers and the DA who told them to do this, that is her legal right and they shouldn't use intimidation to keep her from exercising that right. And if they did talk to the DA why should they care if the woman knows the name of the DA? The whole thing at the end smells fishy. It's kind of like telling a cop you don't want to talk to them, which is your right, so they threaten to get the local tax office to audit you. Sure, you might not have anything to be afraid of but being audited is still a hassle and not anywhere near getting CPS involved.  Or you get caught in a traffic trap and he is about to let you go but because you are being rude he ""smells"" marijuana which gives him probable cause to search your car and delay you and mess up your day.  I don't know why people think this type of intimidation is acceptable just because you don't think she is a nice person. Do you think cops only behave this way towards the people you think deserve it? The whole reason there are so many laws is so a cop always has leverage to use against someone when their initial confrontation fails the legal test. A guy wrote a book a few years ago about how everyone in the country is committing at least 3 felonies every day without realizing it and this is how they maintain leverage. A person should be able to be as rude as they want to a cop without fear of revenge. Not that people should be rude, but they shouldn't be punished by the police, the people we allow to carry guns and give exceptional leeway in the use of force, just for being jerks."
