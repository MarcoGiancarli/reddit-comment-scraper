Bushcraft,3e0xbr,buckironfox,2,Tue Jul 21 02:44:59 2015 UTC,Where did you get this? And if you made it where did you get materials?  Edit: spelling
Bushcraft,3e0xbr,narddawgs,2,Tue Jul 21 02:52:17 2015 UTC,There are a couple people on etsy that can make them. Essentially you just need a piece of carbon steel that's heat treated properly. You have it shaped or etched however you want and punch a hole for your cord of choice. And voila. You have a striker that can spark off any piece of Quartz or other hard rock. Always handy in case you need it. You can also open a beer bottle with it :) if the edges are close to 90 degrees (like mine) you can use it to scrape also. You can also sharpen an edge on a good abrasive river Rock if you needed to  and you can wear it on a plane.
Bushcraft,3e0xbr,Fragninja,1 point,Wed Jul 22 03:00:28 2015 UTC,"Not OP, but my guess to make one of these:  *Materials: *  Some paracord or leather strips for the necklace band  A drill for the hole  A small peice of steel, like an uncut dog tag, the striker from a light my fire rod pulled out of the handle, cut out from a saw blade (hacksaw/bowsaw, or if you thinned out a piece of a table saw blade)  A file  Get your striker, pull it out of the handle or cut it our of the blade, or whatever. File down burrs and such. Perhaps give it a section of edge (a cut out from a table saw blade would be good, it can have a nice 90* angle all around it) using the file.  Drill a hole. File burrs. Attach string.   Best of luck!"

Or they're poor quality. Lately, I haven't worked with them enough to sort that out. One thing I have learned that might be applicable is that cheap ones are harder, they get bumpy. The good ones will spark easier and seem to come out of a camping trip much smoother."
Bushcraft,3e1c9v,psmwrxguy,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:24:50 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I have a cheap Coghlans ferro rod. It works great, aside from the bumps."
Bushcraft,3e1c9v,Fragninja,2,Tue Jul 21 15:22:40 2015 UTC,I have one from firesteel.com (considered some of the best) and it got bumps because I was striking along the entire length (6 inches) and the pressure was uneven at the end. The bumps get worse and worse in my opinion. I sanded mine down and now only strike the end. Hate the bumps.

Bushcraft,3dywqy,Bradguydude,3,Mon Jul 20 17:43:48 2015 UTC,"If you wanna stay cheap, you could consider buying a tarpaulin (like this: http://www.binnenvaartwinkel.nl/data/cms_uploads/binnenvaartwinkel/webshop/org/articles/27000_27200/afdekzeil0.jpg) instead of a real outdoor tarp. At least here in Holland the differences in prices are huge (let's say 8 fold: 10 euro vs 80 euro). They may be a bit bigger and heavier, but they are very strong and the rings in the tarpaulin are very useful for tensioning it up. You could use your saved money to buy a folding saw as well maybe, although I would just use the hatchet instead."

Starting a fire with a firesteel is a skill you should have, which of course requires a firesteel. Learn how to gather tinder, learn how to make feathersticks. Building a fire is also a skill you need, being able to make a reverse fire for a longer burning fire for example.   Making knots is something everyone should be able to do, and with a few basics you can complete most tasks. I would recommend you learn and master these knots: Bowline, midshipman's hitch, double fisherman's knot, reef knot, clove hitch, overhand knot, figure eight knot, Canadian jam knot and any variation of the truckers hitch. (I probably missed a bunch of basic knots in this list). Long story short, a handbook about knots is pretty helpful.  A medkit is a must, and it should contain gauze and band aids, medical tape is also very useful for small cuts on the hands.  I would also recommend you learn which plants are edible in your area, It's a skill I think most people will appreciate, being able to brew some tea with ingredients you picked yourself is very satisfying. I would recommend you look into getting a book about the flora in your country, even though you can look it up at home it always better to have the book with you, at least until you know most plants by heart.   Edit: Learn how to use your tools safely, learn how to swing an axe and how to whittle safely with a knife."
Bushcraft,3dr1pj,svennesvan,2,Sat Jul 18 18:56:47 2015 UTC,"Dave Canterbury's ten Cs are a good basic list.  Cut- get a good knife, then get a GREAT knife. This should be one of the more expensive parts of your kit, but if you find a good cheap one, doesn't have to be. Other cutting tools you could get are folding saws and axes.  Cord- carry some cord. It is extremely useful.  Contain- a water bottle that nests in a cup, maybe even with a fire stand. You should be able to boil water in the cup, maybe even the water bottle (read:they should be made of stainless steel or aluminum), and with a fire stand you can create a tiny fire underneath instead of burying it in coals. A wire bail handle is also recommended, ala alfieaesthetics on YouTube.  Cover- a tarp that can cover you and those you are guiding in case of rain or as a quick shelter. The Mountain Equiptment Co-op guide's tarp is a good example of this. My guide on a trip last year had one, and it was invaluable in keeping up dry when it rained half the trip.  Combust- Dave has a three piece fire kit, bic (instant fire), Ferro rod ( to make lots of fires, and he has many backups), and a magnifying glass (this relies only on the sun, not sacrificing any part of itself to create an ember) that seems too make sense, and you should have at least one way of making fire on you in the bush. Take note that guides from the arctic circle to Malaysia to the rainforest to the sahara all have two items of kit in common. An SAK and a bic.  That's the first five Cs, the real basics. The second five are still invaluable, but are, well, secondary to the first.  I believe two are candling device (flashlight/HEADLAMP), cotton bandana (to make char cloth+ be a bandana). But the first five are the real essentials, in addition to a good source."

Bushcraft,3dg7im,JGolden32,6,Thu Jul 16 00:48:51 2015 UTC,Mineral oil or coconut oil.  Untreated mineral oil is a group 1 carcinogen.  It's safe as it's used in a wide variety of products (including baby oil).  Maybe look for food grade mineral oil if you're concerned.  Coconut oil is also an acceptable oil for carbon steel blades used for butchering/food prep.  You can also use food grade mineral oil on your wood handles.
Bushcraft,3dg7im,sheepdogzero,2,Thu Jul 16 01:42:26 2015 UTC,"Perfect recommendations. I like coconut oil because it doesn't go rancid as quickly as most plant oils, and if you warm it up it becomes thin and gets into all the small spaces to really protect against moisture. Mineral oil is the best for long-term storage, though, because eventually even coconut oil will get rancid."
Bushcraft,3dg7im,Eclectix,5,Thu Jul 16 06:23:21 2015 UTC,"I love coconut oil. Keeps off rust, keeps leather supple, keeps wood from cracking, keeps hands from cracking, keeps pivots smooth and it works as more ""romantic"" lubricant. It's really a brilliant kinda grease"

If you get very little powder but a lot of smoke add more pressure, you can also try and scrape off the surface on the drill.   The tinder should be very small and fibrouses. You should scrape of the birch bark so you get the very thinn pieces. You can use dead grass but make sure you rub the grass so it will break and open up the fibres. The best way is to use the grass as a birds nest and make a hole in the middle off the grass and put the birch bark inside, then gently fold it and blow straight into it. Keep the bundle over you head when you blow at it."

Bushcraft,3dcbug,Emberoonie,2,Wed Jul 15 15:24:14 2015 UTC,"You do it because the ""wind"" Will help get more oxygen in the nest and under 1 meter there is a higher humidity that will make it harder for the tinder to ignite.

Bushcraft,3dcbug,Rusty_Haight,2,Wed Jul 15 16:40:53 2015 UTC,"In my limited experience with successful use of a bow-drill, type of wood has been a HUGE factor. When using softwoods I found most pines, firs, spruces and hemlocks are still too resinous even when dead to give a good powder and coal. Cedar is really the only coniferous wood that I've had luck with. As for hardwoods (which dominate where I live), most are too, well, hard. In total there are probably more species of hardwood that work than soft but you need to experiment. Very dry branches from tulip poplar, which isn't a tough wood, can do well but forget oak or maple. These hard woods make that dark powder but it isn't fluffy enough to grown an ember. So for wood choices its a weird sweet-spot of a hard, dry softwood or a soft hardwood if that makes any sense."

Bushcraft,3d2xwl,spiderholmes,2,Mon Jul 13 13:41:25 2015 UTC,"That is a well known form of campfire lay that was promoted by George Washington Sears (Nessmuk) in he's book ""Woodcraft and Camping"" in 1910. The logs work to reflect the heat as well as feeding the fire.  http://www.zianet.com/jgray/nessmuk/woodcraft/images/07-campfire.gif  http://www.gutenberg.org/files/34607/34607-h/34607-h.htm#Page_33   And this is how we did it: We first felled a thrifty butternut tree ten inches in diameter, cut off three lengths at five feet each, and carried them to camp. These were the back logs. Two stout stakes were driven at the back of the fire, and the logs, on top of each other, were laid firmly against the stakes. The latter were slanted a little back, and the largest log placed at bottom, the smallest on top, to prevent tipping forward. A couple of short, thick sticks were laid with the ends against the bottom log by way of fire dogs; a fore stick, five feet long and five inches in diameter; a well built pyramid of bark, knots and small logs completed the camp-fire, which sent a pleasant glow of warmth and heat to the furthest corner of the shanty. For ""night-wood,"" we cut a dozen birch and ash poles from four to six inches across, trimmed them to the tips, and dragged them to camp. Then we denuded a dry hemlock of its bark; and, by the aid of ten-foot poles, flattened at one end, and packed the bark to camp. We had a bright, cheery fire from the early evening until morning, and four tired hunters never slept more soundly.  We stayed in that camp a week; and, though the weather was rough and cold, the little pocket-axes kept us well in firewood. We selected butternut for backlogs, because, when green, it burns very slowly and lasts a long time. And we dragged our smaller wood to camp in lengths of twenty to thirty feet, because it was easier to lay them on the fire and burn them in two than to cut them shorter with light hatchets. With a heavy axe, we should have cut them to lengths of five or six feet.

If you're near wheeler, you aren't too far from Bankhead National Forest. Lots of well marked trails. Some short. Some longer. The shorter trails tend to have a little more traffic but still aren't too crowded.  The nice thing about this being a national forest is you can set up and camp wherever and whenever you want. Several free parking areas and free access. There's at least one pay to park (like $2 a day with a drop box and windshield tags) with a bathroom along the sipsey river.

Making a ""fully enclosed shelter"" (tents/etc.) is prohibited, however setting up a ""open shelter"" (tarp/hammock)  and sleeping in the woods is ok. Fishing and hunting require insane expensive/complicated licenses. Knifes are allowed just up to 11.5cm blade length. Foraging and deadwood use is mostly ok, chopping living wood ist mostly prohibited.  TL;DR We arn't allowed to do pretty much anything in germany. :/"

I am unsure if you need one if it is on property you own though you will want to look that up. http://wdfw.wa.gov/hunting/huntered/classes/trapping.php  Of course normal trespassing laws are still in place so stay on property you have permission to be on. If you are going on public property most places will have a website with a set of rules to follow.

Bushcraft,3chqs7,zoobox,1 point,Wed Jul 8 20:52:28 2015 UTC,"Ash will work as a handle. It's what the Europeans used because they didn't have access to hickory. Because of this, their axe heads were much larger than American axe heads.  As I understand it, hickory has a unique springy property that allows a person to exert much less force on the swing which is why North American axe heads could be so much smaller.   If I recall correctly, once the Europeans gained access to hickory through trade with North America, everything changed.   There's a fantastic Ted talk by...I can't remember his name. He had a woodworking show where he used period tools to make things.  He explains all of this in a really beautiful way."
Bushcraft,3chqs7,despalicious,1 point,Thu Jul 9 17:07:48 2015 UTC,"So what I'm gathering from this is that likely hickory would have been used on the axe, despite the lack of local access to it?

Bushcraft,3cfpsq,ImTheGuru,3,Tue Jul 7 15:41:31 2015 UTC,"""dispersed camping"" is what we used to do if all the official sites were full. So we'd use old gravel pits, logging roads, the edge of natural clearings. I think you need to decide what experience you want and then scout locations that will serve you well. (shelter, water nearby, fishing, wild edibles, etc.) Also, perhaps consider this as a primative camping option:   http://bwcawild.com/WhatArePMAs.html"

Bushcraft,3cfpsq,MyWorkThrowawayShhhh,2,Tue Jul 7 16:23:02 2015 UTC,"State Forest is fine; if you have any questions, call the Rangers and ask. Make sure to ask about burn bans. Bring tools to make fire how you see fit, but bring a lighter, too. Fire is your NUMBER ONE safety concern. Don't fuck around; you have no idea how fast a forest fire can spread. If one does break out, you are responsible for all financial damages including loss of life. So definitely make sure you know how to practice safe fire methods. Bring as little or as much food as you like. If I'm just going for an overnight, I'll usually just bring some PB and some snacks. Dehydrated foods are easy. Bring twice as much water as you think you'll need. I'd say at least 4L per person/ per day. You're going to need some to put out the fire, too.    Leave a note on your car saying how many are in your party and your expected return. Let someone know where you're going and when to call the authorities (usually 12hrs or so after expected return w/ no contact). Turn your phone off to save battery. Just spitballing at this point so sorry about the formatting. ONLY TAKE DEADFALL. Do NOT cut down green trees for fire or shelter, especially in a park. In the majority of places, deadfall will be plenty enough. If you do decide to build a shelter, make sure you tear it down and spread it around. Leave no trace means make it look like you weren't even there. That's all I can think of off the top of my head.    EDIT: Since this sounds like one of your first outings, bring more than you think you'll need. You can always narrow down what you actually need as you get more experienced."

Bushcraft,3c5k8z,XELBRUJOX,2,Sun Jul 5 00:36:15 2015 UTC,"No experience, but Google images was flooded with some badass looking blades. I'm not sure at this point if kiridashi is a brand or a style, but some models did look like they'd be useful in the bush for general knife tasks. For instance this necker looks pretty slick Others though did seem to have a bit more of a mall ninja appeal."
Bushcraft,3c5k8z,tomcatHoly,1 point,Sun Jul 5 01:04:16 2015 UTC,"From what I understand, kiridashi are traditional Japanese crafting, carving, whittling knife — I'm thinking that they're sort of used like a simplified Carving Jack or Flexcut.  I couldn't agree more about the mall ninja comment. I think they were appropriated by the tacticool crowd, just like other popular utility blades (machete, kukri, karambit) which is unfortunate.  The kind I'm looking at are the traditional style where the blade is only on the angled end, sort of like a chisel. I like the idea of planing and gouging, plus having that narrow corner for detail work. It just seems like a nice supplement to a big beastly knife."
Bushcraft,3c5k8z,tomcatHoly,2,Sun Jul 5 02:34:39 2015 UTC,"Okay so if I've got this correct, kiridashi is more of a style then. Shorter blade, steep angle adjacent to handle. Like its all tanto, or maybe even the origin of it?  I agree about your style taste. I also lean towards the handcrafted and utilitarian kind of looks, as these seem almost ornamental for me. The tacticool looking stuff is less appealing to me, though I have to say that one was a hard example to choose because that steel.  I imagine a lot of bushcraft people would have to re-learn their fine knife work like festhersticking, with the blade at such a steep angle. I'm sure it'd come easy enough though. Going back to your point about chiseling with it, I just don't see that working out well. This one here, with the extended tang for hammering on, seems more like the ticket for that kind of work.  Do you have any examples of what kiridashi you'd be considering making a part of your kit?"
Bushcraft,3c5k8z,Kipku,2,Sun Jul 5 02:57:43 2015 UTC,"No, this is the origin of the tanto. What you're thinking about is an American tanto, designed by Cold Steel. Just felt I needed to clear that up"

Bushcraft,3c5k8z,Kipku,2,Sun Jul 5 08:15:47 2015 UTC,I dun goofed. Here's an American tanto
Bushcraft,3c5k8z,tomcatHoly,2,Sun Jul 5 08:43:26 2015 UTC,Oh. Yeah I know what a modern tanto looks like. I guess it makes a little bit of sense that it progressed from what looks like a samurai sword blade shape.. but to me it also makes sense and is equally likely that the hard corner and angled tip could have spawned from this kiridashi style too.
Bushcraft,3c5k8z,MyWorkThrowawayShhhh,1 point,Sun Jul 5 08:50:16 2015 UTC,"I'm looking into simple traditional designs like this. Something with a blade angle somewhere between a skew chisel and an exacto knife — giving me the best of both worlds (knife and chisel). The simpler the better, although I wouldn't be against some minor skeletonization of the handle area to save weight (why I'm reassessing my kit in the first place) and allowing for a lanyard (I like to clip my tools to a carabiner).   As for the chiseling, I was referring to using fine/detailed woodworking chisels by hand as opposed to something like a cold chisel that would use a mallet or hammer to provide force. Here is a video of a kiridashi tearing up some lumber, skip to about 2:45. And here is a video of a kiridashi doing some fine round edge planing. Both of those are decent looking tools as well.  Just thought it might add some variety to a kit, since it will be supplementing a traditional knife."

Bushcraft,3c4g40,HeyRememberThatTime,3,Sat Jul 4 21:22:59 2015 UTC,"No, it isn't. I don't really understand the mora companion drops, because the knife is so cheap anyways.  I suppose it is a surefire way for massdrop to get some extra capital when they need it, and people who use the site regularly and don't need the knife right quick can support the site, and knock a few buck off the knife."
Bushcraft,3c4g40,Fragninja,2,Sun Jul 5 02:52:55 2015 UTC,It's a lot cheaper for people outside the US. Probably half what I'd pay locally and about 10 bucks cheaper than Amazon when I factor in shipping.

As far as I can tell I can get the other stuff I like to carry(ceramic sharpening rid, ferrocerium rod, mini bic and leatherman) in the sheath. It's at the high end of my price range.

Allow the roasted walnuts to completely cool (They can be stored in an air tight container for several weeks after roasting) and then use a pair of 10"" vice-grip pliers to crack the shells open. If you place the nut into the jaws so that the pressure is applied along the long axis (top to bottom) the shell should split in two along the crack. If you then take the half shell and repeat the process, you should wing up with four quarters, each containing a lobe of the walnut meat.   I also use a pair of wire cutters (Channellock 8-Inch Diagonal Cutting Plier) to aid in cracking the shell away from the meat.  It takes a bit of practice to become proficient at extracting the walnut meat, but it is absolutely worth the time and effort!"

Make some boards, and dry them right and you will have a trove of workable wood when the projects come up. A bench and outdoor table for your patio or yard. picture frame, knife, ax and shovel handles (as you mentioned) if you have a good reason or a desire you could always make a treehouse with the lumbar....in another tree?... lol I agree with so many other ideas listed here too! some really good ones.  Make a bunch of walking sticks from the branches and sell them to a camping (type) store, or online. You could very well trade that wood for work from a wood worker as well. Have him make the bench and table in trade :) you could always pick up an inexpensive heat engraving pen, and try you hand at a new skill, then you can decorate all the new toys you make!

Please don't waste your money.  If you're in love with the 'going light' idea just buy a tomahawk. Cold Steel (American Tomahawk) has several options that are great. Very lightweight, simple, and cheap!  I own probably a half dozen hawks. The trailhawk is very popular. I'm partial to the Frontier hawk though, broader face and lighter. Good chopper."

Also you'll notice, as I did late, that they sell a sort of proprietary handle for it as well.

To use an old sci-fi phrase, ""you must unlearn what you have learned.""  You're walking into a class with instructors who are going to be teaching you good core skills, and it would behoove you to make sure you are not resistant to learning them.  That means not having any of those ""your"" ways stuck in your hands and head but instead being empty minded and ready to replicate exactly what you're shown and do exactly as you're told.  If you think you should walk in there with any kind of pre-achieved mastery in order to succeed in the class, you're mistaken.  You should walk in there ready to be what they are prepared to make you into.  When you're done with the class, then compare what you've learned to what you already know and develop your own methods from there.

For the hatchet, the Husqvarna 13 inch hatchet is a great choice but a tad expensive ($42.00), alternatively you could get the Coleman Steel Camp Ax ($9.00), though it isn't as good. The pot is a little tricky, since I'm not sure how small you want it, but I've heard good things about the MSR Alpine Stowaway Pot ($13.00).

Bushcraft,3bq0eh,PhoenixXJPH,1 point,Wed Jul 1 17:20:15 2015 UTC,"Read, read, read up on bushcraft/camping and be familiar with the concepts and what is required before you take your hard earned money to the sporting goods store. And before spending big bucks, or even small bucks, on junky stuff, or good stuff you don't need, do some short excursions with experienced friends just to get the feel for it. (Hey, maybe it won't be as much fun in reality as it is in your mind. In that case, it'd be a shame to run up a big tab on camping gear only to dispose of it by yard sale or giving it away.) And, keep in mind, your experience level is not demanding of high end camping stuff, and where and when will also have a huge bearing on your gear specifications. For instance: A fair weather weekend ""bushcraft"" camping trip in a state park in Iowa in July with your car maybe a half mile away, versus a two week camping trip to Alaska in July. Okay, so you probably don't live in Iowa or Alaska, but you do get my point, don't you?"

They generally include some tinders that are extremely adept at capturing sparks (punk wood, fat wood, char cloth, pine resin/tar, birchbark, some fungi) for use when other tinders cannot be found. They also usually have a few methods of producing sparks, like flint and steel, a ferrocerium rod (fire steel), fire piston (less often), storm matches, and almost always a bic lighter. Some also have ways of producing fine tinders beyond feather sticks, like pencil sharpeners, rasps, or graters.  These kits are generally housed in a small tin or pouch to keep them dry and safe, as fire is extremely important to survival."

Bushcraft,3bpgdj,gettindemdownvotes,15,Wed Jul 1 02:32:16 2015 UTC,"Somewhat related, I remember a few years ago heading into the woods by myself for a simple overnight camping trip. I hiked in a few miles, set up my sleeping mat and bag on the ground in the middle of the woods, built a fire, and chilled out.  I had some vague notions of unease from the approaching darkness, knowing how far from civilization I was. I woke up in the middle of the night and sat up in the dark. The leaves were not yet on the trees and the moon shone brightly, illuminating the landscape for hundreds of yards in every direction. I looked around and everything was completely still and silent. And beautiful.  I realized how silly my fear really was, that I was really by far the most dangerous thing in the woods. I went back to sleep and since then that fear is much more remote."
Bushcraft,3bpgdj,Gullex,6,Wed Jul 1 04:52:10 2015 UTC,"This. IMO it's more about fearing to be bored, or fearing to have enough time to reflect on yourself, than actual loneliness or boredom.  Having the motivation to build up a skillset to be able to survive in the wilderness, move and go hiking alone, is only as important as the fact that it enables you. It's all only a setup to allow you to thrive in that new environment and enjoy things a social setting would not allow, even though we're fundamentally social creatures."

Bushcraft,3bpgdj,luisgarcia152,1 point,Wed Jul 1 02:55:15 2015 UTC,"I'd like to think that some of that ""confusion"" is your brain going from top-down thinking to bottom up. For some people it only takes hours, whereas others take a few days. I take about 2 full days before I feel ""comfortable"" in the bush.  Top-down is how we operate normally when we're in civilization. We think and plan about what needs to get done throughout the day, and our thoughts even carry over into the next day too, even though we're not there yet.  We're not designed to do this. It messes with our natural processes. We're just so used to it because that's how we're brought up.   Bottom-up thinking is how we're supposed to work: Get up, and do what you need to get done as the events present themselves, not some strictly laid out plan.  It's more healthy, and promotes better brain functions. There's been studies done, but I'm at work and can't dig up the articles at the moment.  Don't fret when you're feeling flustered. Instead, back your fun bus up a bit and ask yourself what you need to get done. Then do it. Then do whatever you feel like doing next. I guess what I'm trying to say is don't plan, just do!

I'd reached by noon and I goofed around until sunset and then moved up the tower. Everything was good until the wind died down at around 10:30 in the night and the mosquitos came in. Since this was deep in leopard territory I had to stay put up there and eventually fell asleep with my head in my backpack.  Woke up at around 4 in the morning to deer alarm calls. There was a leopard close by but I couldn't see any movement. By now the wind had picked up again and the constant sea wind was getting irritating. That's when I started regretting coming but I tried to go back to sleep any way.  I finally woke up at around 7. The sun was just coming up and the wind was much more gentle. The only thing I could hear was the grass moving in the breeze. In that moment, I was just thankful I was there. All my regret just vanished in an instant!

The mosquitoes came in so thick I just had to cover my whole body and cover my face up with a blanket, which they still bit through. Really late in the night, I heard a  bunch of deer running though the woods. I got really scared and thought maybe they were spooked by a bear, so I started to get up and drew my knife (all I had).

He uses this trip to finish his dissertation on the psychology of what alone is. He talks about the planning it took and older survival trip he'd done before that.

Snakes we have, but never really seen anyone wear snake pants. The old 1880s photos some wear rather big boots. Maybe with Rattlesnake around you'd be a little more likely to step on, hence protection more common. I'd think of them like our Death Adder for where they like to sit, and you never see Death Adder they're so well camouflaged (well least I haven't). So that leaves the Blacks and Browns, which mostly get outta your way before you realise they're around.  Ants, well I'm barefoot, so if the sentry gets me and I move on before the rest of the nest gets upset. Wouldn't want to get caught standing in some of the ants we have for 10mins before realising.

Bushcraft,3boqf4,BeastmanCaravan,5,Tue Jun 30 23:13:00 2015 UTC,"You could try birch bark oil. This is made the same way charcloth is made, ie. Having a tin with birchbark in it, closing it so there is a lack of oxygen (prevents combustion) and making two holes, one on top for a little oxygen supply and one at the bottom. You will place a container under the tin with the birchbark to collect the oil. This works because the bark chars, heating up the oil and drawing it out (and to the bottom of the tin) without burning the oil.  You cover the tin with the bark with wood and set alight, the smaller collection tin dug into the ground underneath.  This oil has many medicinal uses that you can read up on, can be ingested and prevents oxidation (rust formation).   The same can be done with cherry bark, or any bark that produces a black smoke when burnt (signifying presence of oil)."

Bushcraft,3bp0i0,HowlingDingo,3,Tue Jun 30 23:54:18 2015 UTC,"Just fyi bcause its my hobby, its not zero one steel, it is O1. The O stands for oil, as that is what is used in the heat treat process to cool the steel properly. Great video nonetheless! Any steel that is in the format O1, or A2 or W2, etc, delegates that purpose, whether it is air, oil or water. These steels are common tool steels, and are known for their toughness, as well as edge retention in onives due to their higher carbon content. They will throw sparks off of flint, and are slightly less corrosive resistant than a true high carbon like 1095 or 5160."
Bushcraft,3bp0i0,StandForMe,3,Wed Jul 1 04:17:35 2015 UTC,"I never knew that, thanks.  So if O is for oil, A is for air, W is for water, what does ""D-2"" indicate?"
Bushcraft,3bp0i0,Askii,1 point,Thu Jul 2 01:08:28 2015 UTC,"I know that D2 is air cooled, beyond that, I don't know. It has a high carbon content, but has a good deal more than say 1095, so it is a bit more corrosive resistant. My guess is represents an added ingredient to give it a slightly different property. Idk though. Other examples of tool steels include L6, M6, and H2. O1 and A2 are the most common for knife makeing though."
Bushcraft,3bp0i0,StandForMe,2,Thu Jul 2 01:23:47 2015 UTC,"I have a Knives Of Alaska Bush Camp knife in D2 that is somehow heat-treated to perfection. From what I hear, D2 is thought of as a less robust steel than the other tool steels, but this knife has been specially treated for all-around bushcraft/survival knife use in cold weather, and I can vouch for its toughness — I can chop and baton without losing hardly any edge sharpness. The steel is supposed to be more resilient than others in deep cold (and other design features back it up as a cold-weather knife). 59+ hardness."
Bushcraft,3bp0i0,Askii,1 point,Thu Jul 2 02:51:44 2015 UTC,Pretty knife. Yeah 59 is about where you want a camp knife. Heat treat is way more important than the steel. Buck's 420 steel is a perfect example. And those Knives of Alaska are a great brand too.

I know there are many Salix species up in the PNW and many of them will serve your purposes. Try a couple out, note the differences, pick your faves. Harvest from lots of different spots, try not to damage any one plant to much and all that...you could probably discretely slip through any local woods and discover a plethora of options. Reeds and grasses, sedges, etc...just start looking at plants and see which ones naturally seem to lend themselves to basket making--maybe yo'll even find a new one and think up a new style of basketmaking!

Bushcraft,3bg25d,ETeeski,2,Mon Jun 29 08:53:21 2015 UTC,"Stuffed grape leaves :)  Ingredients (This is my family's recipe. You'll find different recipes online.):   Forage for some grape leaves. The bigger the better. They look like this    They grow on the sides of roads a lot. It's a vine, so they grow on fences, other bushes, etc. They're pretty common in the middle of wooded areas too. Make sure you see curly vines growing off of their stems. I've heard that what they're growing on can have an effect on their tastes. You can also buy them in jars soaked in water in stores.   ground beef - about 4 cups plain yogurt (not vanilla, not sweet, tastes almost like sour cream. Plain greek yogurt works too.) - about 1 cup rice - about 1 cup lemon salt something to boil them in      You will need 1 grape leaf per ""sausage"" and a few extras to cover the bottom of the pot/pan (just a handy trick to keep them from burning on the bottom).  Mix the ground beef, plain yogurt, and uncooked rice. It's easiest to squish it all together with your hands. Take a small chunk of this mix and shape it into a sausage. Roll that up in the grape leaf. You'll need a flat surface. A tarp on the ground or a split log would work great. The rolling motion is kinda like start at the leaf stem, roll a bit, fold the sides, then roll the rest. As you roll them, place them in the pot. It's ok if they're stacked close together (this helps them from falling apart/unrolling).  Fill the pot with water and squeeze in some lemon. Boil for like 10-15 minutes or until the rice is soft (aka you bite into one and the rice isn't crunchy). Put some salt on it and it tastes amazing! One of my favorite foods ever!   Tip: if the leaves are tough and hard to roll, soak them in warm water for a few minutes, or if you're at home, stick them in the microwave for 10-15 seconds.  This has never really been a bushcraft meal for me. My family has always made these at home with grape leaves we've found. You can buy them in stores, but fresh ones are way better!

Unlike larger legumes like beans, lentils do not require a large period of pre-soaking. They can be cooked without any pre-soaking, though an hour or two in warm water before you boil them will make them easier to digest (= less gassy or upset stomach).  After soaking, add the lentils to a casserole together with some bouillion, salt, pepper and maybe some herbs (I use standard dried Herbs de Provence as my go-to), boil, and let simmer for maybe half an hour (depends a bit on the kind of lentils). If you've brought along bacon or sausages, fry them in a pan and add at the end (preferably cut up small), and add any wild greens and mushrooms you've gathered at an appropriate time as well. The result is a filling, warming and tasty dish."
Bushcraft,3bg25d,Woodsie_Lord,2,Fri Jul 10 10:56:05 2015 UTC,"My favourite one I like cooking is what I personally call ""A Woodsman's Risotto"". If you're doing this outdoors, it's a simple recipe. You only need rice and one pot to cook your rice in. If you have some meat, cook it before doing this. Gather whatever wild edibles you can find (wild mushrooms are the best for taste), cook your rice in the pot and after it's cooked, add the edibles to the pot and stir everything thoroughly so it all looks like a risotto. The meal is ready right away. But it's advisable to cover the lid after you stirred everything to steam the wild food. The taste will depend on the edibles used. You get bonus taste points, if you gathered berries, you get minus one taste point for every dandelion leaf (they tend to be a bit bitter).  You could try an extra step, if you have some oil. Fry some of your edibles like daisies, dandelions, clovers, mushrooms, etc and then add these fried goodies to your cooked rice. The whole recipe with an extra step can be done with one pot reusing it but it's much easier and faster, if you have two."

Hultafors were the original guys to do the hand forged Swedish ax guys. They are the original and have the longest history from the 3  Over all the difference is non existing.

Bushcraft,3beo2f,luisgarcia152,5,Sun Jun 28 15:06:41 2015 UTC,Easy sharpening. Which is an advantage out in the field when all you have is a stone and strop. Better than a flat grind for making feather sticks and carving wood due to the angle.
Bushcraft,3beo2f,Ottoblock,6,Sun Jun 28 15:20:34 2015 UTC,"They are ideal for woodworking. They are easy to sharpen. They are not ideal for food prep, and the convex grind is stronger, which becomes important in extremes of use or for choppers.   My scandis, especially more moras, are my sharpest and most used knives.   Edited to add: Also, it's not like it's an expensive experiment to run!  Pick up one of the many models of Mora's that appeals to you and give it a shot.  I love the 510, Mora 2000, Clipper and #2."
Bushcraft,3beo2f,Mora2015,4,Sun Jun 28 18:33:40 2015 UTC,"Scandi is great but after using it, I actually prefer a flat grind with a secondary bevel. Different grinds will have different characteristics; how they cut, how they split, how they shave, how they hold an edge and how easily they're sharpened.   You're best off choosing what you're actually comfortable using, but you'll only get to know them with use."

They have never needed more than a touch up on a steel.   I have other knives for example a fallkniven F1. It's a thicker survival type knife. It has a convex grind with a micro bevel. Sharpening is more complicated. Stropping  and sandpaper on a mouse mat.   All things being equal I think I'd choose the scandi. But they aren't and I'd likely choose the knife based on weight, steel and design. The knife maker chooses the grind and I learn to maintain it."

Bushcraft,3b4vwq,ETeeski,3,Fri Jun 26 12:50:37 2015 UTC,"Thank you for making this post :) yeah I was really confused looking back on the situation. Like, what would I have done if I wasn't close enough to walk back to my car?  Yeah, the adrenaline definitely was what made me run. I also had no knowledge of what to do when encountering a large cat. Talking to it in a calm voice does sound like a smart thing to do. If I ever find myself in a similar situation again, I'll do that :) I'll have to spend some time learning about predatory animals and how to react to them.   If it was a cougar, that would be news worthy, and pretty scary. The woods I was in has a lot of people visiting it daily. Lots of kids, families, teenagers, etc.   One other thing, could it have been something other than a cat at all? Are there any other animals that hiss? I could hardly see it. I mostly just saw its eyes. At one point I could almost make out its head and legs. From what I could tell, it was probably the size of a golden retriever dog.   Actually, I took a minute to look up some video of bobcats and cougars. Scroll to 0:20 in this video. That is the EXACT hiss noise I heard! The only thing is that I didn't hear that deep ""purr"" noise. Maybe I wasn't close enough to hear that. Does anyone know if bobcats can make the same sound?  So I'm guessing it was either a big bobcat or a small cougar. After watching the videos, it could be either. If it's a bobcat, that's surprising. If it was a cougar, then holy crap!  The next morning I went back. Surprisingly, all my food and gear was perfectly untouched! So I guess it didn't want my fish? Also, I'm pretty sure it was still there. I'm fairly certain I heard it moving in the bushes again, pacing and watching me. I assume that means it had kittens near by. I looked for foot prints, but the ground was covered in leaves. I couldn't find anything distinct.  I think I'm going to go back and clear an area of dirt, and maybe put some mud or sand down best I can. Then I put bait in the middle and see if any foot prints show up over the next week or so.   Also, one thing that doesn't add up, I've never seen a deer carcass in these woods, or any animal carcass. I've never found anything more than a few single old bones. I've been exploring those woods for years."
Bushcraft,3b4vwq,bigbeard_,2,Fri Jun 26 22:58:47 2015 UTC,"Awesome dude I'm glad you got all of your gear back safe and sound.   And you could be right about the cubs, that would explain why it didn't pursue you, and protecting young is absolutely a good reason for a bobcat to become aggressive.  All in all, I'm pretty damn jealous man, that adrenaline rush as you realize you could be hunted, and the relief/joy of getting to safety is the strongest feeling I've ever felt. There is no way to replicate that in a zoo, and now-a-days, its something that few humans get to experience."
Bushcraft,3b4vwq,Thjoth,2,Sat Jun 27 15:26:31 2015 UTC,"I would say that cooking in camp was another mistake, IMHO.   Even having a coyote in camp is unacceptable to me. In many areas an old trapper technique to get coyotes is to lay your traps beside/in a old fire pit/location that has been used by humans. Coyotes have been shown to go and dig up the fire pit, looking for scraps of food. I am sure it likely works this way for other animals.   Animals (and likely especially predictors), will often come to a sent just to see what it is. This means any food smell, soap, bug spray (likely more the stuff that smells nice, not stuff like muskoil or deep woods off) etc can be an excuse for a animal come into camp. Toothpaste is another bad one.    In bear country i will have my kitchen at least 100 yards or more away from my camp where i sleep.  Lately i have adopted this policy for any back country camping experience as i just don't see the risk in having an close encounter with anything bigger than a rabbit (raccoons i am looking at you). This also means that things like toothpaste etc stay with my food.   Anyways, i am glad like many others in this sub reddit that everything worked out ok, for him and the large cat."

He was hissing at you in the dark because you were along one of his usual hunting paths.   Why do cats hiss? Two reasons: 1. Pissed; and/or 2. Scared.   He was probably a bit of both. If you had a kid with you, he probably would have got snatched up the first time you turned your back on him. A bobcat won't generally attack a grown man unless any one of a few different things come into play:   Wounded Starving Afraid for life; a. again, wounded, and/or b. backed into a corner Extremely pissed Rabid, or otherwise deranged   In deep Michigan woods - any deep woods, for that matter - it's always best to walk/hike/camp with at least a sidearm of some kind.

"" haha but yeah that looked painful haha  Thanks for all the info. Would you say that bobcat probably would have left then if I didn't run away?  There's wolves in Michigan?!   Edit: now that I think about it. I feel like that cat was hunting me, or hunting for my fish and I was in its way. More maybe it was defending its territory? Did I have a litter of kitten near by? It stalked me for about an hour before the sun went down. Then it circles around me about 30-50 feet away and came up 20 feet away and stared at me. When I made a loud noise, it hopped away, but then circled around me more then hissed."
Bushcraft,3b196l,dustybizzle,2,Thu Jun 25 17:10:47 2015 UTC,"There's wolves in Michigan?!   Better believe it.  Bears, too. Forgot to add bears.   Would you say that bobcat probably would have left then if I didn't run away?   Hard to say for sure. Again, it depends entirely how hungry he was or if he was hurt or otherwise deranged. Also, it depends on how big/intimidating you are or can be.   hunting me,   That's entirely possible.   or hunting for my fish    Also entirely possible. Based on everything you say, it seems probable (even likely) that he caught wind of your meal and wanted it for himself. Bobcats do hunt fish. (Not the best example, but they do it in the wild, too.)  Protip: Next time, bring garlic and tomatoes to make a pan marinara sauce. Cats (of all sizes) absolutely despise anything acidic - tomato, citrus and the like - and they equally despise garlic. I think it even makes them sick.  Insta-edit: Forgot to add that you should store your fish in an airtight container or ziploc bag, to prevent odor from giving up your location. If you camp near a stream or lake, it probably won't matter. But if you're like a mile or three from a water source and you're lugging around a fish all day, you better believe that everything that will eat a fish within a five mile radius can smell you."

On the other hand, there are lots and lots of deer there. I've rarely found any deer carcass there.

From what I understand they do this because #1 many of the sightings are of an amateur and deservedly skeptical nature and #2 mountain lions will 99% of the time avoid humans so by acknowledging their presence they will just scare people for no reason.  Not saying I 100% believe this, but it does make sense.  I won't believe there are mountain lions in New England until I actually see one or see photo/video evidence from a reliable source.  I did bump into one in my campground in Montana a few weeks ago though, that was startling.  Stared at me from 10-15 feet away and didn't blink or move a muscle."

Bushcraft,3aqvvk,hulkster69,3,Tue Jun 23 03:00:55 2015 UTC,"PA is a great place for outdoor enthusiasts, however true bushcrafting is difficult to do legally here and I suspect it's the same in other states. If you want to break the rules, you can get the full experience but the state really doesn't want people bushcrafting. From an administrative and conservation standpoint, that makes total sense. If everyone were allowed to cut down trees to make pot hangers or shelters and could build fires wherever they wanted, the state could easily lose control of the available natural resources and we could have a lot more forest fires. My point is, read the rules/regs of the parks you will be going to and it's up to you to decide if you want to adhere to them.  Now that that's out of the way, here's a great interactive map from the PA Dept of Conservation and Natural Resources. I don't know where you are geographically, but this should help you find a place near you in PA. http://www.gis.dcnr.state.pa.us/maps/index.html   Also, I know this is lame and kind of against the whole concept of bushcraft, but you don't necessarily need to leave your community to practice many bushcraft skills. Sure, things like identifying plants, locating wood, building a natural shelter will need to be done ""on location"" but there are many things you can probably do in your house or in your community so you're ahead of the game when you're actually out in the field. For example, knot tying is a huge one. Very easy to practice at home and you really don't want to be learning on the job. If you have a fire pit in your back yard or even picnic areas with public grills, you could practice your fire-starting skills. Also, if you're near anything close to wilderness, pick up some sticks and small logs if you can take them back to your house. Then practice your knife skills at home. By the time you get out in the woods, all you'll need to do is put it all together. :)  Also, you'll really want to familiarize yourself with the rules & regs of State Park rules. Here's a summary for PA - http://www.cookforest.com/parkinfo/rules.cfm  The complete list of rules/regs is here: http://www.cookforest.com/parkinfo/newrulesregs.pdf"

The story behind the pines, at least in my area was that at one point in time, a third of the ships in the royal navy were produced in my area, they were quickly clearing the land of white pines, however this lead to an erosion problem, and in the 1920's the government started a red pine planting program on the sandy slopes, promising the land owners to buy back the mature red pines as telephone poles.

Bushcraft,3ap2it,razorfin8,2,Wed Jun 24 17:16:30 2015 UTC,"Its about weighing risk vs reward.  A tree provides a VERY solid base for a structure. You won't be able to come close to the same level of stability with a free standing structure (unless you are building with stone). So the rewards here are pretty high, trees are literally natural posts with deep foundations.  On the risk side, you have to watch out for dead branches and lightning. Both of these are mitigated by inspecting the tree, and not selecting the tallest tree in the area.   I can setup up camp between two trees in less than 20 minutes with ease (tarp based).  Building a free standing structure is going to take much longer, more effort (calories), and make a bigger impact on the environment."
Bushcraft,3ap2it,billbillbilly,2,Mon Jun 22 19:05:10 2015 UTC,"Lighting is like people. It's really lazy and always looking for the path of least resistance.

If you're in a wide open field with a single tall tree, that'd be the stupidest place to seek shelter because it's effectively a lightning rod. In a forest, full of tall trees, I would say do not pick the tallest one, or the highest."

Bushcraft,3ap2it,fromkentucky,2,Tue Jun 23 19:40:30 2015 UTC,"I had a scary situation not too long ago. I was backpacking into the Santa Rita Mountains in AZ. At the time I needed to settle, the terrain was incredibly steep. The comfortable option was underneath a large pine where the roots leveled it almost flat. It had many leafless branches, but they looked sturdy. What I didn't take into consideration was my terrain in juxtaposition to the weather. The valley funneled the cooling air at night, building tremendous pressure. The limbs were solid around 5pm, but 10-11pm they didn't measure up to the strength of the wind pressure.
