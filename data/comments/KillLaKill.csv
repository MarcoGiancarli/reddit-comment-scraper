It also is deep like Kill la Kill.  He also made Panty and Stocking with Garter Belt, which, as the name suggests, is crazy in its own way.  I recommend both, because they share the craziness and energy of KLK.  Also, Imaishi worked in Gainax while working on these, which had some pretty cool shows like FLCL and Neon Genesis Evangelion (which is a deep-dish pizza of psychology and angst.)"

(most likely, and alluded to in dialog)  kinda unlikely but Because he and Ryuko shared blood and DNA its possible that when they shared some fibers while kisaragi'd the transformation back was not complete due to the deterioration of his weave, although the only way for them to be ""him"" is if they come from the eye piece. (Ala scarfketsu but in her body, evidenced by her ""gained"" ability to absorb fibers as Senketsu did. were unable to tell if this is from fusing with him or merely the first demonstration of her fighting/utilizing this shared ability solo as a fully awakened hybrid) The far out and extremely unlikely possibility that Senketsu has ascended to a higher plane of existence to watch his waifu from the stars as shirt-jesus and aid her in time of need. (only evidenced by his face arguably appearing in the star pattern over earth, the ghost Senketsu images only appeared to Ryuko during the mecha fight, and the red star flash mimicking the power burst from first synch in the OVA credits) only included because out of Trigger's body of work it could believably happen."

Senketsu's death didn't shock me because before the finale was released there was a survey posted on this subreddit and one series of questions asked who was most likely to die. When I saw Senketsu on there I thought oh yeah he's going to die and that took away the shock of his death. However my heart was ripped out when Ryuko was cut in half because the survey made me think she was dead until it turned out she wasn't.

PS: If you haven't played Asura's Wrath, get it and play it, seriously.  At the VERY LEAST download the demo!  It's the best anime I've ever played.  Yes, even better than Zone of the Enders 2.  (But play that one as well if you haven't yet!)"
KillLaKill,3d0oi9,fallenlogan,6,Sun Jul 12 17:58:55 2015 UTC,You get a high five! Asuras Wrath was so freakin epic and the true ending was just spectacular.
KillLaKill,3d0oi9,MojaveMilkman,2,Sun Jul 12 18:07:31 2015 UTC,"Yes, SO spectacular!  You've played Zone of the Enders 2 right?  Because I am going to plug it; I have a feeling that if you are in a KlK subreddit and you loved Asura's Wrath that you will very much enjoy Zone of the Enders 2 as well.  It was re-released in the Zone of the Enders HD collection on PS3 and Xbox360.  I recommend PS3, but do let the game update.  PS: Don't feel obligated to play Zone of the Enders 1.  2 stands on its own.  (1 is a good game too but it really was made as a test of the PS2 Metal Gear engine and less as a high budget, stand alone title)"
KillLaKill,3d0oi9,AlloyMorph,2,Sun Jul 12 18:24:43 2015 UTC,"Zone of the Enders is better than Asura's Wrath in terms of gameplay for sure. I mean Asura's Wrath was basically a playable anime, but I still enjoyed both of the Enders games and Asura's Wrath."

If it does come to fruition awesome but right now they're not the biggest development studio in Japan. Also if a Kill La Kill game was made we might not get in the west due to the cost of translation and finding a publisher that would be willing to give them money for advertisement."

Instead of gibbing enemies, you just cut their clothes in the game's Blade Mode. In fact, they already have civilian NPCs that you can do this to!  Imagine fighting through the Elite Four one after the other. Just think about how hype the Vergil Satsuki fight will be. Just... the material is all there in the show. It's ripe for a Platinum adaptation."
KillLaKill,3d0oi9,sephtis,1 point,Sun Jul 12 21:54:55 2015 UTC,"I can't think of how the game's plot would be canon without just re-hashing the anime though. I mean it'd be cool for the fight scenes but unless they have you switch characters all the time Mortal Kombat style, you'd have a bunch of fights where you're scripted to outright lose as Ryuko OR Satsuki.  Actually, I take that back. Here's how you make it work and be canon: The game is a prequel where you play as Nui, assassinating all the other life-fiber research groups who aren't working for REVOCS. Think about it. The bullet-dodging, the limitless weapon variety, the Banshi-Zandatsus, THE TAUNTS...  Life-fibers, girl."

KillLaKill,3d0oi9,Deanonator,1 point,Tue Jul 14 06:38:21 2015 UTC,"Ehh, anime games normally aren't so good.  Kill la Kill is so excellent that it's extremely unlikely any studio would spend the money to make a game that lives up to it, rather than simply give it the normal ""anime game"" treatment.  Excellent games based on anime or manga are the exception by far.  Not to say I wouldn't play the game regardless, but no one is remembering a Full Metal Alchemist or even DBZ game as one of their favorites.  A good director could make all the difference, though, so obviously it would be excellent if he was involved.  Many of the so-so games I'm referring to were quite obviously made quickly and cheaply, so some real effort could make a pretty good game.  Though I still think that it would be difficult to live up to such an amazing show."
KillLaKill,3d0oi9,aztec_mummy,6,Sun Jul 12 19:11:49 2015 UTC,"but no one is remembering a Full Metal Alchemist or even DBZ game as one of their favorites.

As far as over the top fighting games go Tenkaichi 3 is definitely one of my favorites."
KillLaKill,3d0oi9,Herculefreezystar,2,Sun Jul 12 21:59:48 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I almost edited to say that several DBZ games were exceptions, though that makes a lot of sense since they're largely fighters and that works well with many shounen.  But basically no DBZ fighting game is particularly competitive, which is kind of the standard for fighting games. (though, personally, I'm even kind of biased against things like MK so I'm always skeptical of many 3D fighting games, especially those that aren't properly balanced)"

KillLaKill,3d7o4w,Fenixius,11,Tue Jul 14 04:02:33 2015 UTC,"For two reasons:  First, it means that we have closure. The characters' struggles are complete. The outcomes they fought to gain aren't going to be upended by some contrived reason for an S2. We don't really need more discussion about the nature of humanity and clothing, either - the themes are also thoroughly dissected during S1, especially if you include the OVA.   Secondly, because Trigger aren't making sequels, they can write new and exciting works. They're a small studio; they can't handle too many projects at once. We got the amazing Little Witch Academia second episode. They adapted When Supernatural Battles Became Commonplace, which had several nice surprises. They've since made Ninja Slayer, which is an experiment with the form. I don't know what's coming next, but I want to see Hiroyuki Imaishi and his team have the freedom to do anything they want. I want them to surprise me, which KLKS2 just wouldn't."

KillLaKill,3cxuf7,codywarmbo,6,Sun Jul 12 02:38:16 2015 UTC,You have to be impressed. They're great voice actors and the casting is perfect. What you mean to say is you don't favor them.
KillLaKill,3cxuf7,VerboseGecko,2,Sun Jul 12 00:31:13 2015 UTC,It's not going to be on Netflix for a while. It aired on adult swim (I think?)
KillLaKill,3cxuf7,HayabusaZeroZ,3,Sat Jul 11 23:05:59 2015 UTC,"Yes, it did. I think it still is, actually...idk. I'll see tonight :D"

KillLaKill,3ctilx,HayabusaZeroZ,7,Fri Jul 10 17:29:08 2015 UTC,"Prints & Artists:  Ryuuko v. Satsuki x2 - Alex Ahad (""Skullgirls"" creative director)  Ryuuko meeting Senketsu - rei17 (she was only there for one day I believe)  DJ Sona - shilin"
KillLaKill,3ctilx,Redditisquiteamazing,3,Fri Jul 10 17:32:57 2015 UTC,"I'm jealous of the one by Alex Ahad. I love skullgirls, it's the best fighting game on steam."
KillLaKill,3ctilx,Redditisquiteamazing,2,Sat Jul 11 01:25:59 2015 UTC,"It's the most fun I've had with a fighting game in a long time, but I've learned to stay the hell away from Quick Match...when you fight someone really good and you're a beginner....well, you can't really call that a fight."
KillLaKill,3ctilx,Redditisquiteamazing,1 point,Sat Jul 11 02:19:48 2015 UTC,"Ohh, that's why I recognized your username! I see you occasionally on /r/skullgirls! But yeah, quick match is brutal for new players."
KillLaKill,3ctilx,Le6barbare,2,Sat Jul 11 02:26:32 2015 UTC,"I got the game I believe last month? Been playing mainly offline, and my first dives online didn't end well ._."
KillLaKill,3ctilx,bunnyfriezz,2,Sat Jul 11 02:27:13 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that was me a lot my first month or so of Skullgirls. But now I've been playing the game for about a year now, and I can safely say that I still suck massive balls at quick match."
KillLaKill,3ctilx,bunnyfriezz,1 point,Sat Jul 11 02:30:36 2015 UTC,"""Ryuuko meeting Senketsu"" is absolutely wonderful. Where can I get a nice print of it too ? I search on pixiv, but I don't find"
KillLaKill,3ctilx,Rullponken,1 point,Sat Jul 11 07:12:53 2015 UTC,I honestly wouldn't know; I saw her booth in the Artist Alley at Anime Expo and didn't want to go without getting one of her prints.
KillLaKill,3ctilx,Mythiiical,3,Sat Jul 11 07:23:51 2015 UTC,I had great time at AX 2015. Can't wait for next year!
KillLaKill,3ctxls,greeny74,13,Fri Jul 10 19:18:03 2015 UTC,is rly good.

KillLaKill,3ctxls,XxLilNepxX,4,Sat Jul 11 02:22:29 2015 UTC,"The only problem I have with this is that Senketsu is inverted. Otherwise, nice art!  Imgur mirror!"
KillLaKill,3ctxls,Sixpix,8,Fri Jul 10 19:19:51 2015 UTC,Also double gloves :P
KillLaKill,3cvmwx,Weebvile,6,Sat Jul 11 03:49:36 2015 UTC,"Well, I'm not allowed to actually link to it, but I hear you can go to a pretty KICKASS website to find them for free. I'd recommend the Anime RG uploads. Dual audio and full 1080p.  If you do actually want them legally, they stream on Crunchyroll."
KillLaKill,3cvmwx,The-Sublimer-One,4,Sat Jul 11 04:10:16 2015 UTC,Crunchyroll would very much be preferable for my own stance in piracy. But of course there's no way of me knowing how exactly you got your footage... ;)
KillLaKill,3cvmwx,hulbhen,5,Sat Jul 11 04:30:38 2015 UTC,Nyaa(aaaah man I wish I could tell you where to get the [.s]tuff you n[e]ed.
KillLaKill,3cvmwx,HayabusaZeroZ,1 point,Sat Jul 11 05:27:24 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure if this is against the rules or not, but you could use Audials and record it from Netflix. But, I don't really see the need for another KlK Abridged series - we've already got at least two."
