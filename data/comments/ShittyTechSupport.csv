Your internet speed limit is an arbitrary restriction imposed by your ISP, not an actual technical limitation (although it is vaguely informed by the technical limitations, of course).  Even if it could reduce latencies on a local network without such restrictions (hint: it doesn't, I'll get to why later), it wouldn't help with your actual speed. This is because networks are specified work with one of a number of bandwidths to make sure that everything can keep up.  Finally, electrical tape does not conduct electricity. The reason for its usage is that it INSULATES stuff."

ShittyTechSupport,3akunp,Aperson3334,1 point,Tue Jun 30 05:10:45 2015 UTC,"sudo gives you root permissions, basically letting you do anything  rm is the command to delete files. the -r flag means ""recursively remove the directory and everything underneath it till it's dead"", and -f means ""don't ask any questions, force delete it all"". / is your root directory, approximately equivalent to the C:/ drive. rm -rf / would start deleting everything until it deletes a necessary file, at which point the system crashes. Your linux installation is then screwed.   chmod changes the permissions of a file. The -R flag again means ""recursively apply this change to this directory and every file underneath"", and 777 is the permission. It basically means ""give everyone read, write and execute permissions"", and / is again your root directory. This command changes the permissions of every file on your system to be readable, writable and executable by absolutely every user. If you're a server with that apache ""nobody"" user? Guess what, the ENTIRE internet can do ANYTHING on your machine.  If you want to learn linux, I'd totally advise you grab yourself a copy of Debian, and read the Arch Wiki.

It'll actually teach you how to use the OS, as opposed to offering a quick-fix Windows substitute.

We will say your night was 12 hours long, and there are 60 Minutes in an hours, and 60 seconds in a minute. Meaning your night was 43200 seconds long. If we divide that by 6 seconds, we can determine how many times your GIF loaded. which is 7200 times. Meaning 7200mb, or 7.2GB. if you have a phone plan of 6gb, you will be 1.2GB over.

'Drying Out' your computer is easy and relatively quick, and at the same time, we can 'Temper' your motherboard!! THIS IS A HUGE FUCKING UPGRADE THAT NONE OF THE n00b FAGGOTZ EVEN KNOE ABOUT!!!  Okay, first a little background! The biggest hindrance in overclocking and computer performance is heat. A lot of the processors on your motherboard and GPU are air-soldered using low-temp solder. This is fine until you become a 1337 h4x0r and start overclocking your sweet rig! You see, shit gets hot and the solder starts melting! Soon you have GPUs and CPUs starting to come loose. FUUUCCCC!!!   Well, when we're done, your shit can get hot as fuck and it won't even matter!! We're going to temper your motherboard!!  Yeah, I know, right? I'm pretty fucking stoked too! Get ready to unleash the art of medieval sword making that is hidden within your sick PC!! LET'S GET STARTED!!   Find a plastic container big enough to fit your entire PC!  Purchase enough mineral oil to fill this container. (you can also steal or download it. Your pc won't care) Gain access to your mom's oven. (this is not a metaphor! I am not necessarily condoning your Oedipus fantasies, nor am I  condemning them, I'm completely neutral on the subject, but fucking your mom won't be effective in this procedure...I should know). Preheat oven for 500 degrees Bake your PC for 3 hours. Note: Some purists will only bake the motherboard, RAM, and Graphics card. This allows them to use a smaller container of oil, and thus save money. CAREFULLY remove the computer, or components and immerse them in the container of oil. The solder will be in its 'Melty' state and can run so be extremely careful to keep everything COMPLETELY level. Eat a Hot Pocket. (that shit's alright, yo, and you gotta keep your strength up) Remove your computer, or computer components from the oil-bath and put them in the dish washer. (The dishwasher will wash off the oil and then dry everything. Reassemble, but leave out the heat sinks and cooling fans. You'll no longer need those.  PWN n00bz!! Congrats!!!

ShittyTechSupport,33fbes,Arkalis,10,Wed Apr 22 03:14:35 2015 UTC,There are many different kinds of viruses that exist. I recommend collecting every virus that you can find and then disconnecting from the internet forever. When you disconnect it prevents viruses from escaping into the internet again
ShittyTechSupport,33fbes,Almedinz,5,Wed Apr 22 03:14:42 2015 UTC,"This is a bit of an advanced topic since it requires you to delete files that are protected by the micro-viruses (which are essentially just small versions of viruses, but are greater in number). You can go about this in many different ways, but I'll teach you the easiest way:  Buy a Windows 97 OS from your local electronics store (they should still sell it, if not, file a complaint to their company because that's the latest OS right now). Once acquired, go to one of the domains from here (trusted websites listed, don't worry). Once that's done, there should be a file downloaded into your computer, the name should be something along the lines of 'cryptolocker.exe'. If your antivirus reads it as malware and tries to block it, uninstall your antivirus. Note that the file, when opened, launches a licensed system32 uninstaller (there's system64 and systemx86 too, but since you only mentioned system32...) that should automatically quarantine the micro-viruses and delete system32 if prompted. Don't forget to right click -> Run as administrator the file! After it's done, restart the computer and log into your bank account to check if system32 is deleted from the internet. You won't get in trouble if you delete the system32 for all of us because the uninstaller you downloaded is licensed :)  If you run across any problems, let me know!"

Mix the potato and the apple together then get the doctor to eat the potatoapple then make him regurgitate it. Wipe it all over your screen and apple's antivirus will take 2 seconds to scan the internet. The potato will help draw out the system32 hidden virus then the doctor's vomit will help with the surgery and there you go... Go enjoy the outdoors."

Also you will need to get a small piece of thin metal, copper usually is the best. Attach to wires to the battery terminals and tape the copper over the dead pixel. Now you don't want to hold the wires to the metal too long. It would be harder to explain a fried pixel to the PC Police. But give it a few zaps.   If this doesn't work then, the pixel has gone to the Great Monitor in the sky.  You should immediately dispose of the late pixel by removing it, placing it in the bath tub and pouring sulfuric acid on it. This can usually be found at any big box hardware store in the plumbing section. Be sure to wash all evidence away down the drain.  And pour some acid down all your drains so if the PC police come knocking then you can say you just cleaned all you drains.   Then put out an ad in the classifieds to hire a new pixel but be sure to brainwash this new pixel to think he has always been there. This should be relatively easy, pixels aren't too bright."

Back in the day, we all had big beautiful CRT monitors upon which we could set our printers. The gentle radiant heat of the unit kept the printer nice and toasty, like a mother's womb.   But cold, heartless LCD bullshit that we use now can't support a printer, and even if it could, it doesn't generate nearly enough heat to properly warm your inks.   So, to solve this, you either need to find a nice 17"" LCD to keep your printer warm, or put your ink cartridges in the microwave for about 3 minutes on high.

ShittyTechSupport,2zhxic,REDDITSHITLORD,3,Thu Mar 19 02:37:05 2015 UTC,That's insensitive grandpa died because he was run over by a train of thought...
ShittyTechSupport,2zhxic,REDDITSHITLORD,8,Thu Mar 19 02:48:33 2015 UTC,"Died? oh, OOOOHHH!! See I thought we were talking about computer problems, not corpse reanimation.   No matter, though. Your in luck! I just happen to have had limited success in this very field.   First thing's first. You need to retrieve the corpse. Hopefully, the flesh is still good, but I've got a work-around for that. The most important part is the skeleton.  Phase 1: Corpse preparation  This is relatively simple. You remove the skin. If you can do it in one piece your work will be easier later on.   Now once you get the flesh off, set that aside. You are going to see a lot of junk inside. This stuff is called ""guts"" Get rid of it. All that stuff is broken anyway. What you really want is that skeleton.  Once the skeleton is completely freed, you may want to take this opportunity to repair any broken bones. Bones are made out of wood, so you can just get new ones at Home Depot, Other corpses, or drugged captives.   Phase 2: Squirrels   Economical and efficient, Squirrels are the next best thing after forced labor! Seriously, they don't demand money, or rights, or even safety! The best part is that they're relatively easy to catch. Anyway, you'll want 75 to 100 of them depending on grandpa's build.  Phase 3: The hard part  Man, I wish there was an easy way, but there isn't. This is going to take some time. Drug the squirrels, to make them easier to handle. Begin by attaching the squirrels to the bones of the skeleton.  As you've probably already noticed, squirrels are surprisingly strong, and these are going to be grandpa's new muscles! I recommend using a sturdy, lightweight nylon cord for tendons, and well, have at it! The next part is the plumbing. You'll need surgical tubing and simply attach all the anuses...ALL OF THE ANUSES. Run a larger tube off of those and save it for later.   Phase 4: Flesh assembly  If the skin is still good, take it out back and bring your shotgun. You're going to want buck shot, not slugs. Lay the flash out and shoot it once, twice if he was a larger man. This is going to create the necessary air holes. The skin is now ready for installation. You will need to stuff the squirrel-laden skeleton in there, and if you're the perfectionist type, sew him up with a zipper so future maintenance will be easier. Make sure you sew the anus tube to the anus on the skin.   Phase 5: Painting  One thing I've noticed with corpses is corrosion. Go ahead and find a color you like and paint grandpa so he doesn't ""rust out"". Silver's always a cool color.   Phase 6: Activation  The squirrels will eventually wake from their drug-induced slumber and they'll be hungry. The first feeding is the most critical. Cram as many nuts and acorns as you can into his mouth until you can feel them down by his feet. Those furry devils are gonna be hungry!! They will also need to drink. the easiest way to do this is to spray him with the garden hose. The water will enter through the air holes.   When the squirrels regain their strength and become fully awake, they are going to FREAK THE FUCK OUT, causing grandpa to move in all kinds of ways!!! He'll even soil himself eventually! I mean, he's not likely to walk, and talking is right out of the question, but partial functionality is, statistically speaking, infinitely better than zero functionality.     Notes:   If flesh is decomposed or in some other way compromised beyond usability, search for a product called ""inflatable love doll"". Basically, it's an entire replacement synthetic skin that can be ordered to many different specifications. It also won't require the anti-corrosion paint. You may want to consider installing a maunal gate valve on the Anus tube. Cost-wise this will be far less expensive than adult diapers. Raccoons: If you choose these over squirrels, remove their claws first.   Well... I hope this helps! I mean, this isn't my field of expertise, and it's more of a hobby, really. Maybe there's someone on here who is a bit better versed in necromancy, but, hey, it's a start!"

I had it happen all the time when I would create the air holes after installing the flesh. So make sure you get those steps in the proper order.  Also, it's necessary to feed and water him on a regular basis.  Even then, some maintenance is still required.  If you installed a zipper, the process will be quicker, but if not just get some scissors, or some broken glass or whatever, and cut him open to locate the malfunctioning squirrels. You definitely want leather gloves for this!!  Once you have located the broken squirrels remove them, and do the following repairs:   Count how many squirrels you have. Catch 12 small mice for every squirrel Remove flesh from squirrel and set aside Remove guts from squirrel and throw away (strangely a lot of living things use guts) Attach the mice to the squirrel skeletons, in the same manner as you did before with the squirrels and grandpa, complete with anus tubes. Reinstall the refurbished squirrels!"

It appears as a decorative element in various cultures since at least the Neolithic, and is mostly known as a symbol in Indian religions, denoting ""auspiciousness"", adopted as such in pre-WWI-Europe and later, and most notably, by the Nazi Party and Nazi Germany.

First off, there are many types of clocks:  SAE 12 hour: ""normal clock"", typically used in North America  Metric: 10 hour dial, used mainly in continental Europe.   Australian: This clock runs in reverse so it can be displayed upside down.  Military: 24 hour dial, which is purposefully difficult to read so if captured by the enemy, it will prove to be inconvenient.  Now in the case of the SAE and Australian models, you can simply FORCE both hands to both point at the number six at the same time. I really need to stress that you absolutely need to force delicate mechanical instruments of all types. They will only bend to your will if you can prove yourself to them in a feat of strength.   Once you've made this adjustment, the clock will consistently display incorrect time 100% of the day.  For the Metric clock, you will need to force both hands to the 5.5 (55 centhours)  position.  In the case of a military clock, you should remove the hands entirely, paint over the dial and draw on new hands with a sharpie that point to the letter ""Q"". You may also have to add a letter Q. Also make sure to install a new battery. If you are one of our enemies, then do not complete this repair. Simply use it as you have found it.   Now for digital...

Simply add the month, day, and year your video was uploaded 3+5+2015=2023.  Then you take the current age of the father of the Internet and CEO of Apple, Al Gore, 66, and add that to the result of step one so 2023+66=2089. This is the expiration year.  Finally, switch the day and month it was uploaded. So 3/5 becomes 5/3. This becomes your month and day.  And there you have it! Your YouTube video will expire within a year of 5/3/2089.

ShittyTechSupport,2xll13,89rovi,1 point,Mon Mar 2 02:17:29 2015 UTC,"Hey there, OP.  Just wanted to clear a few things up, since there seem to be some very misleading comments in this thread.  As an amateur programmer, I feel obliged to help you out in this situation.  First of all, you must understand that most wireless routers don't have a particularly long range.  Specifically, there is no way that your standard wireless router will have a long enough range to reach your work.  However, there are a few things you could do to improve the range.  Many people don't realize this, but the power supply unit of your computer - that's the metal box inside your computer tower - operates on the same frequency as most wireless routers.  When your computer is running, the range of your wireless router may be greatly impacted because of your power supply unit.  But, fear not, there are ways of changing the frequency on which your power supply operates.  First of all, you'll need to open up the power supply unit using screwdrivers.  Don't worry about the power cord - it can stay plugged in, since this is a very short process.  Once you get the power supply open, go and get a cold pitcher of water.  Adding water to your power supply every week will help to dampen any fluctuations in the frequency it operates on.  Before the water has a chance to warm to room temperature, quickly pour it into your power supply.  It is imperative that the water stays cold!  Once it's in there, make sure to mix it well, preferably with your bare hands.  Mix that shit up real good.  Once you're finished, close up the power supply and you're all done!  Enjoy boundless internet wherever you go!  Disclaimer: don't actually do this, you'll die."

Step one is to find the internet. If there are telephones poles near your house, they are probably up there in those wires. If not, you may need to start digging or go further out. Now you have to catch the internet. This is trickier than you might think, and sometimes takes a few tries. First, you must get a long rope. Then, tie the rope around the internet you found in step 1. This may take some time, but it will be worth it once the internet is in your home. Once you have the rope tied to the internet, pull it tight. Now, bring the other end into your home. You now have internet in your home! Of course, most people like the internet to reach their computer. I will walk you through how to do this. First, bring the rope to your computer, and turn it on. Now, tightly tie the rope around your computer. It should have internet now! If it doesn't work, you may need to use super glue to make sure there is a good connection between the rope and the computer. If you have a router or modem, you can tie your rope to that.   Good luck!"

Gold plated connectors also help keep the cables from corroding, IIRC, so they should last longer than that old crappy cat5 cable from your garage.  You should not be allowed to give yourself a tech level of 4/5 if you think twisted-pair is unique to cat7. The number (7, 5, etc.) is the # of twists per foot, and higher twists = lower risk of electrical interference.  But since this person clearly knows what they are talking about (why else would they be a 4/5 tech level? Nobody ever lies on the Internet!), I think we can all pack up and go home, clearly everything we know and the ""facts"" we used to stand by are clearly all wrong because the Illuminati has been standing by since the very start of computer networking, secretly degrading performance with each new ""improvement"" in technology, all while providing enough of an illusion to give us enough reason to spend more money on decreased performance!

ShittyTechSupport,2tifqy,xsam_nzx,6,Sun Jan 25 01:06:56 2015 UTC,On the bright side you can now use it in your next house.
ShittyTechSupport,2tifqy,hbz4k,2,Sat Jan 24 22:32:29 2015 UTC,Now you just need a few thousand identical bricked phones to make the rest of the house.
ShittyTechSupport,2tifqy,Rob_T_Firefly,4,Sun Jan 25 02:56:26 2015 UTC,"Nah, u can just us ur pc to bacup ur phone (ituns if its an iphon or kis if its an samsong) then restor. Now u hav two brickd phons.  Repeat untl u have enoug 4 ur hous."
ShittyTechSupport,2tifqy,q-quan,3,Sun Jan 25 10:57:07 2015 UTC,"Uhm, did you try rebooting it?  Otherwise, boot it into recovery mode by holding down all the holes in the phone for 2 years, installing gentoo and then going to buy a new phone. Should do the trick."

ShittyTechSupport,2tifqy,robochicken11,3,Sun Feb 1 23:42:46 2015 UTC,"Drop the brick back on the phone, this maneuver is called a ""reverse brick."""
ShittyTechSupport,2tifqy,ultrasawblade,1 point,Mon Jan 26 14:27:04 2015 UTC,Try wiping the dalvik cache 52 times.
ShittyTechSupport,2tertm,HDInfinity,3,Fri Jan 23 15:25:45 2015 UTC,Yay! Free air forever!
ShittyTechSupport,2tertm,ProfessionalExtemper,1 point,Fri Jan 23 16:16:05 2015 UTC,Damn Obama and his commie cronies! How is American business supposed to survive if we can't even charge for air?
ShittyTechSupport,2tertm,ekolis,2,Tue Feb 3 02:06:09 2015 UTC,The cans also come in handy when your server room is making you uncomfortably hot. Just hold a can in each hand and spray for a few minutes and you'll be all cooled down.
ShittyTechSupport,2tertm,mordea,5,Fri Jan 23 16:59:58 2015 UTC,It's probably not good that I actually do that during the summer sometimes
ShittyTechSupport,2tertm,ZeKadeo,3,Fri Jan 23 17:00:47 2015 UTC,You'd die. That's the joke.
ShittyTechSupport,2tertm,xelanil,1 point,Sat Jan 24 03:42:19 2015 UTC,I hear they work better if you turn them upside down.
ShittyTechSupport,2tertm,dannysmackdown,5,Sat Jan 24 05:44:14 2015 UTC,Compressed air companies hate him! Watch how 1 man has destroyed the compressed air industry!
ShittyTechSupport,2tertm,opticbit,1 point,Fri Jan 23 18:08:04 2015 UTC,make an adapter for a scuba tank. It will fill it much faster.
ShittyTechSupport,2tertm,RavingGerbil,0,Fri Jan 23 19:49:54 2015 UTC,Hey I have the same air!
ShittyTechSupport,2t8g0q,IceGlaceon471,44,Thu Jan 22 00:39:00 2015 UTC,No. Windows 10 users will get the free upgrade to Windows 95.
ShittyTechSupport,2t8g0q,NameAlreadyTaken2,11,Thu Jan 22 00:43:01 2015 UTC,wat
ShittyTechSupport,2t8g0q,NameAlreadyTaken2,38,Thu Jan 22 00:49:35 2015 UTC,95 is bigger
ShittyTechSupport,2t8g0q,NameAlreadyTaken2,20,Thu Jan 22 00:59:58 2015 UTC,Shouldn't we get Windows 2000 instead?
ShittyTechSupport,2t8g0q,randomhumanuser,33,Thu Jan 22 01:03:19 2015 UTC,"No, that has the Y2K bug so it fills your screen with spiders"
ShittyTechSupport,2t8g0q,NameAlreadyTaken2,18,Thu Jan 22 01:13:21 2015 UTC,Spiders are technically not bugs.
ShittyTechSupport,2t8g0q,LeSpatula,17,Thu Jan 22 14:40:48 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that was the problem"
ShittyTechSupport,2t8g0q,avapoet,6,Thu Jan 22 15:11:03 2015 UTC,"Yeah, spiders are arachnids. Like scorpions. Do you want to have scorpions all over your screen? I think not."
ShittyTechSupport,2t8g0q,FlamingArmor,3,Thu Jan 22 21:00:40 2015 UTC,"In general use, ""bug"" means any land invertebrate, in the same way as you might use ""creepy crawlies"". So arthropods would be included.  The mistake that people make is calling them insects, which they're not. But there's nothing wrong with bugs."
ShittyTechSupport,2t8g0q,avapoet,6,Thu Jan 22 17:20:49 2015 UTC,"Where I come from, the analysis of the definition of 'bug' has no relevance to ShittyTechSupport"
ShittyTechSupport,2t8g0q,randomhumanuser,3,Sun Jan 25 03:52:01 2015 UTC,All the upvotes to you!
ShittyTechSupport,2t8g0q,DammitDan,2,Sun Jan 25 06:01:41 2015 UTC,"Where I come from, bug means beetle or insect."
ShittyTechSupport,2t8g0q,svenM,3,Thu Jan 22 18:22:54 2015 UTC,The bugs attract the spiders though.  And the spiders are the real problem.
ShittyTechSupport,2t8g0q,ekolis,3,Thu Jan 22 22:08:59 2015 UTC,"Nah, your computer needs to be ably to handle those large numbers, so to make sure all computers can handle it they limit it."
ShittyTechSupport,2t8g0q,Spysix,12,Thu Jan 22 07:41:20 2015 UTC,"No, 95 is more than 10, so it would be a downgrade."
ShittyTechSupport,2t8g0q,supergnawer,12,Thu Jan 22 01:02:52 2015 UTC,Then why does Microsoft want people to use Windows 8.1?
ShittyTechSupport,2t8g0q,avapoet,15,Thu Jan 22 01:09:07 2015 UTC,"Because windows is in limited supply, Microsoft is being pretty cheap in only trying to sell people windows 8.1 (has less windows than windows 95) Ever since the recession they took huge steps back in their windows manufactory and are slowing giving us more and more windows."
ShittyTechSupport,2t8g0q,Spysix,3,Thu Jan 22 07:57:17 2015 UTC,"Wait, are there limited windows in windows? Should I be worried? What happens if I open too many windows? Do they run out and make windows stop opening new windows, or will I have to buy new windows?  While we at this subject, which windows has enough windows in it for me to use it in a small business operation?  Edit: if it helps, my business is installing windows."
ShittyTechSupport,2t8g0q,penislandbic,1 point,Thu Jan 22 17:57:45 2015 UTC,I think you mean that Windows are in limited supply. It's a plural.
ShittyTechSupport,2t8g0q,lichorat,6,Thu Jan 22 17:21:37 2015 UTC,Shut up nerd.
ShittyTechSupport,2t8g0q,robochicken11,-4,Thu Jan 22 17:22:43 2015 UTC,"Actually, Windows 7 to Windows 8 was a downgrade."
ShittyTechSupport,2t8g0q,ijjimilan,5,Thu Jan 22 02:13:19 2015 UTC,"You will, but you are required to prove that you've used it consistently for the past few years. Also you are required to write a QBASIC ELIZA chatbot in limerick form."
ShittyTechSupport,2t8tww,ekolis,3,Thu Jan 22 02:30:16 2015 UTC,"Oh yea sure!  Step 0: Install gentoo, just to safe than sorry :)  Step 1: Go to installmoreram.com and download everything you see.  Step 2: Go to downloadmoreram.com and download some virtual memory.  Step 3: Now put the ram in your hard drive, and download it to a zip disk. The zip disk will make it zippy and fast.  Step 4: Put the zip disk back in.  Step 5: Run ""a:setup.exe"" and follow the instructions.  Step 6: Reboot your pc.  Done!"
ShittyTechSupport,2t8tww,AnAwesomeMiner,3,Thu Jan 22 14:42:57 2015 UTC,"Sometimes you can ram the disk with your memory, try that and see if it helps."
