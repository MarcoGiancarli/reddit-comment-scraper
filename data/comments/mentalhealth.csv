mentalhealth,3e42ua,eddielement,5,Tue Jul 21 20:15:09 2015 UTC,"Today is a day I’ve been working towards for months. I first released my app, called MoodTools, for Android last year. While I was trying to find some funding to pay for someone to port it to iOS, my friend, who owns an iPhone and had been dealing with depression, committed suicide. I decided to take matters into my own hand and learn how to code it myself. This is the culmination of my hard work, so check it out and let me know what you think! And if you like it, please share it with anyone you think might benefit from it.   The journey doesn’t end here of course. I will continue to improve and polish MoodTools, so I welcome any feedback you have in the comments. Thank you!"
mentalhealth,3e42ua,vanityobscene,2,Tue Jul 21 20:23:16 2015 UTC,"Congratulations on your successful port!  From the page it seems like a pretty solid piece of software. An all-in-one mood diary of sorts.   Its expressed purpose is to help people suffering from depressive symptoms / episodes. Can you track other mood types as well? For example I have Bipolar disorder and depressive symptoms are only one component to my illness as a whole. If you can't at this time, is that something you'd be interested in adding in the future?  I like that there are psycho-educational components to the application as well. That is particularly important - especially in the early days of a diagnosis like Major Depression or Bipolar disorder."

(Although I want them to remain relatively disorder specific, just to target app store searches). Bipolar disorder in particular would be easy to do!   And thank you about the psychoeducation part :) I remember a few years ago I knew nothing about mental illness while trying to help a friend and simply reading + learning about it made a HUGE difference!"

mentalhealth,3e648v,Alynxi,1 point,Wed Jul 22 06:26:21 2015 UTC,"The most important thing to do is to establish whether your father is a danger to himself or others. Though loopy, and though clearly experiencing something abnormal, your post doesn't make it sound like he's dangerous.  Having said that, it's clear that he needs intervention. I can't speak to what he's suffering from, that would be inappropriate, but I will say that he could be suffering from both mental and physical health problems.  A good place to start is to arrange an appointment with your family doctor. Arrange for a general check up (which usually includes a blood test - definitely worth doing regardless of whether he's mentally ill), and consult the doctor about his symptoms. Often GPs can prescribe short-term remedial prescriptions that will usually help while you wait to get into a psychiatrist's office.  The GP will also be networked with psychiatrists and psychologists and be able to help you and your family get in touch and start the process. (What you're after is a psychiatrist though, as your father needs a comprehensive assessment and diagnosis if there is one to be had.)  The most important thing to remember here is that no matter how crazy your father sounds he is sick, and helping him needs to come from a place of love, not frustration. I strongly suggest sitting down with the family and talking about what to do. Once you're all on the same page, include your father and explain that you all love him, and worry about him, and want to help him through whatever is going on. Assure him all anyone wants is to help - this should help to alleviate some of the tension that comes with paranoid delusions.  Tackle this as a team and you should all get through this. Good luck."

Here in Australia we only get advertisements for over the counter medications like ibuprofen and paracetamol.  Prescription medications of the kind that are used to treat mental illness aren't able to be advertised. These medications are also significantly cheaper here. You can get generic 'brand' versions, and on top of that most are on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, which is a government subsidy that reduces the cost to around five dollars per prescription.  I'm glad for that. In a system like ours there's no room for marketing to a consumer. It all stays strictly medical."

mentalhealth,3e1h6v,Sbeast,5,Tue Jul 21 17:08:51 2015 UTC,"Because quite often, it's perceived that women who are suicidal are that way because society treats them unfairly while men who are suicidal are just seen as weak and unnecessary. At least, that's how it goes in the majority of my state."

mentalhealth,3e1h6v,mhtwa,2,Tue Jul 21 19:15:13 2015 UTC,"The linked article is a bit misleading--the main reason suicide has become the leading cause of death is because the former leading cause, maternal mortality, has dropped. Which is actually a pretty great thing. And it's girls between 15 and 19, not just ""teens.""  Regarding boys, the leading cause of death for that age range is still accidents (unless you're Black and in the U.S., in which case it is, sadly, homicide) but suicide is up there, too. The most at-risk teen population when it comes to suicide is GLBT youth.   Regarding your glib line about ignoring boys, teen suicide is a frequently researched topic--for both genders, and particularly for GLBT kids because that's the most at-risk population."

mentalhealth,3e1h6v,pacmatt27,2,Tue Jul 21 15:57:37 2015 UTC,The point of the article is to show that suicide is now the biggest killer of teenaged girls because it wasn't before. We already know that suicide affects more males than females (in the U.S.).   See: https://www.afsp.org/understanding-suicide/facts-and-figures
mentalhealth,3e1h6v,kanyka,0,Tue Jul 21 21:22:24 2015 UTC,"Exactly my point. It's a bit like ""Men are killing themselves, who gives a fuck? Oh women are dying now, too? We should do something about it!""."
mentalhealth,3e1h6v,pacmatt27,0,Wed Jul 22 05:17:45 2015 UTC,"You need to stop. What you are doing is reprehensible. You cannot turn your nose up at one groups' suicide stats because you want more to be done about another. That is a disgusting point of view.  Men and women, adults and teens, different demographics face different pressures and circumstances that can lead them to kill themselves. It will never be the case where you can pretend that there isn't a difference, and address everyone on the same level.  Women are different from men. And men are different from women. Regardless of why that is, it's a fact. ""All people"" doesn't fucking apply here. And you do not need to address ""all people"" every time you address rates of suicide or leading causes of death.  Are we going to talk about ""all people"" when it comes to cervical cancer? No, no we're bloody not.  Think before you speak. You created an absurd ""us vs them"" narrative in your head and it's stupid. The appropriate time to deal with mens' issues is when the topic is about mens' issues.  Same goes for /u/captain_unremarkable."
mentalhealth,3e1h6v,vanityobscene,1 point,Wed Jul 22 05:26:00 2015 UTC,Except the topic never is men's issues. Obviously there's a difference but why am I suddenly seeing posts about suicide rates now that it's a women's issue when nobody seems to really care that men commit suicide on a consistently higher rate than women already?  It's not an us vs them narrative and I don't need to do anything. I'm allowed to ask questions and I'm certainly allowed to ask why virtually nothing is still being done to help men who commit suicide while more is being done to help young girls. The two are not mutually exclusive so stop trying to shut people down when they try to talk about it.
mentalhealth,3e1h6v,pacmatt27,1 point,Wed Jul 22 05:38:59 2015 UTC,"There are articles of men's mental health issues regularly on this subreddit as well as other mental health subreddits. There are also campaigns regularly lead by organisations throughout the U.S., Canada, Europe, Australia and New Zealand surrounding these issues. But it isn't a click your fingers fixed issue. The people who care are already there. The awareness brigade is already working hard. The problem is in funding, which is primarily given by governments or via charity (as these organisations are usually not-for-profit and government subsidised or funded entirely) and in the fact that men are they own worst enemy.  What I took issue with in what you lot have said is that you have pushed the conversation toward men's issues and asserted bullshit like ""oh, now it's about women people must care."" But that isn't what is happening.  You do need to do certain things. If you don't you're just pissing in the wind. And that's my point. There is a time and a place to fight the good fight and it is not during a time when the issue being addressed is that one leading cause of death in young women has been bumped down and another has taken its place.  If you want more to be done, endorse the organisations who actually work at the problems you care about. Post their content to this subreddit and others. Talk to friends and family about supporting these organisations that already work hard.  Men's greatest adversary is not women, or however much coverage they get. It is in fact men. One of the biggest obstacles is hypermasculine culture - a culture that men are as responsible for as their counter-parts. Men are not seeking help because they are being taught by their fathers to be stoic, to do things alone, to not lean on other people. Men are willfully ignorant to the positive benefits of psychiatry and caring for their mental health. And these facts are the ones consistently being addressed by the campaigns and organisations surrounding men's mental health issues."
mentalhealth,3e1h6v,vanityobscene,1 point,Wed Jul 22 06:07:11 2015 UTC,"1) Nope. I very rarely see articles specifically aimed at males otherwise we wouldn't be having this conversation. Scrolled through as many as I could be bothered to on this sub and none were aimed specifically at males... Would be interested to see some better statistics on the ratio there though, as I could be wrong. As weak as anecdotal evidence is, I personally never see articles addressing male needs without specifically searching for them.  2a) Blaming men for their difficulties is unhelpful when it's a deep-rooted societal and evolutionary problem.  3) I do. I'm a mental health clinician in the NHS and ran a men's group for the mental health charity Mind in my local area for about 7 months, single-handedly. Don't presume to know what I do or do not do in addition to commenting on reddit.  4) (2b) Blaming men for their difficulties is unhelpful when it's a deep-rooted societal and evolutionary problem.   One of the biggest obstacles is hypermasculine culture - a culture that all of society are responsible for endorsing and maintaining. Men are not seeking help because they are being taught by their fathers, mothers, daughters, sons, brothers and sisters, friends, colleagues and media to be stoic, to do things alone, to not lean on other people. Men are frightened to take advantage of the positive benefits of psychiatry and caring for their mental health. And these attitudes are the ones consistently being addressed by the campaigns and organisations surrounding men's mental health issues but reinforced, ignored or dismissed by wider society.   FTFY  These campaigns, charities and movements are consistently shouted down by feminists and funders because they're seen as detracting from more important (read: female) issues. Men are seen as disposable utilities, not human beings. Again, I reference the outcry over an increase in women's homelessness despite the vast majority of homeless individuals being male. Hillary Clinton's comments on war victims. #heforshe campaigns. #yesallwomen ring a bell? Look at any issues surrounding rape or domestic violence; do you not find them to be a little gynocentric, generally? There was a poster, in my mental health charity building, addressing battery towards women with incorrect statistics and no mention of males or where they could receive support. This new article on how suicide is now a serious issue for young females. So it is. It's been a serious issue for all males for god-knows how long. What is being done in wider society to address it? I would argue tantamount to nothing. It's getting worse, if anything.  5) You say I'm disregarding their needs when I'm not. I'm merely questioning why I'm to care more about this or fight for more investment in solving this  problem when there is an overwhelmingly unhelpful attitude towards men in society and the only efforts to change it are tokenistic or sabotaged. I will accept and respond to the plight of this one, small section of society more appropriately when the needs of the half of society to which I belong are being attended to."

mentalhealth,3e2hoa,beNEIN,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:24:40 2015 UTC,"I think having the ability to brush off whatever comes your way (also known as resilience) makes you mentally able / healthy. Everyone experiences some degree of disappointments / blues but those are not depression. Everyone gets stressed or uneasy about certain events or remembering certain things but it doesn't mean you're experiencing anxiety. Mental health to me is opposed to Mental Illness. Therefore, I would consider anyone recovered from, able to manage or without symptoms of mental illness to be mentally healthy. Mental Health could also be perceived on a scale, with social support, perceived happiness and overall job/hobby satisfaction contributing to the score."
mentalhealth,3e2hoa,TheSelfButcher,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:15:35 2015 UTC,"When you say brush of whatever comes your way, do you mean in an everyday sort of a way or WHATEVER (however extreme or twisted). Additionally, what about a person who considers human lives disposable but is highly intelligent and extremely resilient otherwise to the every day stressed and disappointments of life even without support. Is that person mentally healthy as well?   In case it sounds like I'm trying to counter or negate your points, I'm not. Genuine questions, those."
mentalhealth,3e2hoa,TheSelfButcher,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:30:42 2015 UTC,"Resiliency was, from my understanding, something that the military took great interest in. From that perspective, a highly resilient individual can survive traumatic events and is able to function even in the most high stress environments. That being said, when referring to someone who is resilient, it is usually referred to as someone with a good mental health, as is someone who has a sufficiently good outlook on life, social supports, etc. to endure various forms of stress or unplanned events. Regardless, I would not consider someone who is mentally healthy or even highly resilient to be able to face tragic episodes or very intense or prolonged stress without consequences as we are all physically limited to a certain extent. Regarding someone who considers human lives disposable, it could be seen either as a different value system which, in itself, is not necessarily an issue as it could be a cultural thing. If you're referring to someone like a sociopath, since it's no longer a personality trait but a personality disorder, it could be debated whether this person suffers from a mental illness or not."
mentalhealth,3e2hoa,TheSelfButcher,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:59:42 2015 UTC,"So from what I have gathered, when you use the term resiliency you're not referring to just a high level of tolerance but a particular set of traits or structures (internal and/or external) which allow an individual to deal with stress. Additionally it also appears that it is through the outlook the person maintains during periods of stress or sadness within the normal range, whatever that is, that their resilience is being assessed. Is my understanding approximately correct?   Regarding the example of someone who considers human lives disposable, it was just a question about where value systems figure into the concept of mental health. It could also be psychopath at peace with being the way they are, one who isn't disturbed by their own 'antisocial traits' and is able to maintain a positive outlook in their own right. Point being if mental health is an internal or external state."

Typical treatment time depends on the specific issue (or issues) and the person's level of social support, financial resources, motivation, and access to resources.

mentalhealth,3dzh47,citiesbreakindown,2,Mon Jul 20 20:02:41 2015 UTC,"You don't sound like a whiner at all! Why does the fact that your family is focusing on your brother mean that you can't see a therapist? Therapy is often recommended as a way of dealing with the stress of being a care-giver to someone with mental health issues, even if you don't have any yourself. Is there a financial issue? Or do you not want to burden your family with your problems? If it's the latter, I think you could find a way to explain it that wouldn't add to their stress.  As for your current symptoms, I'm not a doctor - I've never even studied psychology beyond a high school level - and I don't have any personal experience feeling this way. But if you were a character in a movie, I would think what the writer was trying to convey was that you're suppressing feelings that are too painful or intense to acknowledge, but they're find a way to manifest themselves physically. That may or may not be related to reality, but it's the intuitive answer to me. Maybe spend some time considering deeply the things that you find yourself reacting physically to, and see if you can sort out your thought process in that moment.

mentalhealth,3dxoc5,untouchedURL,-1,Mon Jul 20 11:42:28 2015 UTC,I'm cool with psychiatrists giving meds to bipolars and schizophrenics. I'm not cool with them doping up someone who's a little down during winter months or someone who can't get to sleep.
mentalhealth,3dxoc5,irondal2,4,Mon Jul 20 12:04:22 2015 UTC,"Okay? That's not really what this article is talking about at all. They're advocating for psychotherapy on the basis that some disorders don't respond well to medication, not that certain disorders aren't serious enough to merit treatment. So I'm not sure why trivializing insomnia and seasonal depression is relevant to this thread."

I mean molly is cool but taking it behind your partners back isnt."
mentalhealth,3dy2fi,firebird305,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:35:41 2015 UTC,"I don't think that she was sneaking away to take drugs or that she was lying. It just happened that way. She was very up front that she had taken it. She has never hidden her use from me. I just thought it was a stupid decision to take it from a stranger and she didn't seem to agree at the time. However, she did agree the next morning.   There are aspects of our relationship that are unhealthy due largely in part to both of our mental health issues."
mentalhealth,3dxg4z,RockstarSlut,4,Mon Jul 20 09:47:27 2015 UTC,"You can talk about sex. And you are not the first one to do so with your therapist. Sex is a pretty important part of most peoples' lives and the therapist will not be surprised that you think about sex.   And you can also point out that it's about the ""thought-world"" as much as it is about sex. Not to deflect the topic, but to give a complete picture. That will give you something else to talk about and connect pieces. The conversation will not be about what turns you on and such - that's not of interest. They want to learn why, how and when you do think in these ways."
mentalhealth,3dxg4z,ObsessionWithDeath,3,Mon Jul 20 10:30:51 2015 UTC,"Thank you so much for your input. How would one go about bringing it up? I mean, I know I can write it down with the other distractions I turn to when I feel depressed, but I have no idea how to phrase it. The thought alone makes me really uncomfortable, but I know I have to address at some point. I have definitely done my best to avoid the issue. But the only one I fool is myself, and I know I will regret it once my treatment is done."
mentalhealth,3dxg4z,ObsessionWithDeath,2,Mon Jul 20 12:20:06 2015 UTC,"It is hard, very hard. For me, it was similar to calling a doctor for the very first time and get on the record as needing help, which I avoided for all my life until early this year. I reminded me that they have to know what keeps me busy, that I already got so far and am still ok (I thought hell would break loose once I asked for help. Hah.), and that I can takte one step at a time.   I provided the information in a big-ass patient interview form, and filled it out one bit at a time. Answer all the easy questions, the next day think over the harder ones, then later start to answer some, and finally add all the missing things over the next days. You do not have to write it all in one sitting, I could not have done that without clamming up or breaking down.   By the way, even if it seems obvious, do include that and how you avoid/hide the things, too. That can be relevant.  Re: Phrasing: I used something like ""seeking comfort"" in my thoughts - oddly enough I find it very soothing to think about the possibility to commit suicide, and generally giving in to my depression. The therapist did not talk about it in the first session after I handed it in, and in the second one briefly asked me about how I feel when that happens, what can trigger it, and overall it was no big deal. Like discussing any other topic, but I was a bit more ""distanced"" from myself and the conversation, if that makes sense."
mentalhealth,3dxg4z,ObsessionWithDeath,3,Mon Jul 20 18:04:45 2015 UTC,"Hey - good thing that you summoned the courage to call a doctor! That is most definitely the hardest step. The first step. Confronting and accepting yourself! I also thought: Shit, what have I gotten myself into. I don't want this! Because it's so hard to truly face yourself.   So you wrote it down and showed it to your therapist? I took the initiative to write down the ""answers"" to my ""assignments"". But phrasing anything with the word ""sex"" in it really bothers me.   That's good advice to write down what you hide, thanks! Damn, that's difficult too, though.   I would do that too! I would fantasise about my funeral. Imagine every single detail and feel comfortable doing it. Glad, I'm not the only one to be comforted by depression. It does make sense to feel ""distanced"". Sometimes I also feel like I'm describing another person, or I try to make it sound like that, so I don't get upset. I hate to be emotional with psychologists and therapists. I don't want to let down my guard and show my ""weaknesses"".   I really appreciate tour thorough reply! I already like this sub. :)"
mentalhealth,3dxg4z,_kellermensch_,2,Mon Jul 20 18:39:36 2015 UTC,"I'm new here, too, I think your post is one of the first I comment on :D   It was the default form they give every new patient/client. It asks for history, health, acute problems, motivation to seek therapy, upbringing, the whole shebang.   For me the sex and relationship/marriage part was done with quickly.. never had sex, never had a partner, no acute intend to change either and there was that, lol. And I can totally see how that's difficult to talk about. It took me about four months to become comfortable with talking about my problems. And I remember that it took longer than I care to admit to become comfortable with being naked, and sleeping naked. At age 22. :/  Anyways, I now see it like an exam at the Doctor's. They're professionals, and nobody is in it (no pun) for fun so I can as well try to be professional as well.

mentalhealth,3dxg4z,_kellermensch_,3,Mon Jul 20 19:15:24 2015 UTC,"I share your diagnosis, but I'm a guy, and have often had female therapists/contacts on the psych hospital.   Talking about sex is perfectly fine. They are used to it, and often ask about it themselves. I don't think of myself as inhibited in the subject, but I feel it can be difficult to be honest with myself about it. So maybe it's important that you figure out why you do it and what it does for you and your condition.  On an off-topic note, I'm curious if you have group therapy ahead of you, or if you have just been assigned 1-on-1 sessions with your therapist? I have to get back into our system sooner rather than later, and I seem to always end up somewhere else than I had hoped.  Good luck with your treatment! I hope it works out for you."

I appreciate it! Exactly, I also have trouble being honest with myself about it -- and being confronted by it, by older people who's in control of their life, can be quite uncomfortable to me.    I'm about to start my first group therapy sessions in September in which we'll practice our social skills. There will be more concerning different topics later on. How do you mean somewhere else? Do you end up in the wrong group sessions?   And thank you! So far so good. :) Likewise!"

A quick search reveals there is /r/schizotypal, but it's dead.   I did actually mean that I end up in group sessions, generally, and it doesn't seem to do anything for me.. Last time with people with various other diagnoses. Either they send me there too early, or I just don't get anything out of it. I don't know. It makes me lose interest, and eventually just stop showing up - which really isn't the way forward. :/ It can be a bit frustrating, since it takes quite a while to get through a new referral, visitation, etc.   Luckily we're all different, and what doesn't work for me may very well work for you and others. :) Keep up your optimism!"

mentalhealth,3dx4n3,rekohunter,2,Mon Jul 20 06:59:18 2015 UTC,It seems like a good idea to talk to someone. I'm certainly not a professional. I have had my share of anxiety dreams before and I generally find that they don't have much to do with the actual subjects and imagery of the dream. Is there anything in your life causing unusual amounts of anxiety? Family? Fears about the future? Discomfort with your identity or current place in life?
mentalhealth,3dx4n3,ethicaldilemna,1 point,Mon Jul 20 07:49:35 2015 UTC,"Can't think of anything more than usual. I mean. Works work. Mild frustrations here and there. I work odd hours even for my department so I miss all the meetings and stuff. Missed out on a few opportunities to pseudo be promoted due to it. Been a bit miffed about that but thus is life.   I've been worried about money more lately. Not that it's changed or I'm bad off. I just still spend like I'm a stupid 18 year old rather than 28. So I've been having buyers remorse a lot lately. Maybe that's it? I know every time I'm in those dreams ""Oh god how am I gonna pay for stuff! Why didn't I save money!"" is thundering in my head."
mentalhealth,3dx4n3,ethicaldilemna,3,Mon Jul 20 09:15:20 2015 UTC,"So, like, again, I'm not a professional or even amateur psychologist nor do I know you well enough to make these kinds of judgments, but just from some of your comments you seem to feel consciously or subconsciously like you haven't achieved the things that you expect yourself to have done by now. Which is something that lots of twenty somethings feel, especially me. You describe your job as hum drum and your life as ordinary and maybe even boring, but brains don't really like feeling ordinary and they certainly don't like feeling left out or behind the curve. If anything I'd say your dreams manifest a feeling of being trapped between two anxieties. On one hand you need your job to live and define yourself and losing it is a terrifying prospect. On the other hand some part of you may feel like you should be somewhere, something, or someone else which is totally normal.   The hard part is sorting out what to do next. Pretending nothing is wrong is probably what's keeping you awake and driving these anxieties into your dreams. For me the best thing to do would be to spill my guts, to a friend, a therapist, or even alone. Really, have a good long talk about what you want from life and don't be afraid of shame or guilt or embarrassment. That might help you to reset your priorities and appraise your situation to figure out how to reclaim your own peace of mind.   As for what you should do specifically that's on you. Just remember that you are no less developed, intelligent or successful than you should be and that you have decades and decades and decades with which to decide who you are and what you want to be.   I'll add that professional help could be really great for you. Feel free to tell me I'm full of crap and that I'm reading too far into things.   And I'm typing this on mobile so formatting and spelling are probably fucked.   Good luck and pleasant dreams!"
mentalhealth,3dxgdd,WestAve001,3,Mon Jul 20 09:51:13 2015 UTC,"""What is it about me that's broken?"" is a harsh and unfair way to frame your situation. It sounds to me like your self criticism is turned up to 11, although I can understand that this is not where you expected to be.   It's certainly a good idea to talk to somebody, and to regroup emotionally. It feels to me like the answer is to approach your vocational uncertainty with some more lightness, sense of humor, and compassion towards yourself."
mentalhealth,3dxgdd,whoopeddog,1 point,Mon Jul 20 10:28:09 2015 UTC,"Thank you. I used to be a really positive person, but years of no's and no responses have wrung it out of me. The funny thing is, when things are going right, I'm the goofiest, friendliest, happiest guy. It's very difficult to dig deep and find that in such a bad financial situation, but I'll definitely take your advice and try to be a little more light-hearted."
mentalhealth,3dxgdd,whoopeddog,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:51:04 2015 UTC,"I've worked as a counselor for a long time, but it took me like 23 jobs to figure out my place in the world. I tried to work sales and I just didn't have the personality. I tried to do restaurant work, couldn't keep shit together in my head and kept getting fired. I think you can get in a catch-22 when you're looking for work. What I mean there is that you get discouraged and that limits what you think you can do, and I think prospective employers pick up on that vibe.   It's natural to get discouraged when you don't get a break, almost impossible not to get down about it. Have you looked into resources for veterans where you live? I know that in our area there are new programs that give a surprising amount of help to people, and a lot of vets don't know they are out there."
mentalhealth,3dxgdd,whoopeddog,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:42:44 2015 UTC,"Thank you! I have contacted Orion International and Bradley Morris -- I'm fortunate in that both have regional offices where I live. The downside, as they admitted of themselves, is that they are far more proficient at placing more physical labor type jobs, or management of the same. That would be okay, but I have a degree and talents and finance, and I can't seem to even get an interview for those types of jobs unless it's sales (at which point it's not really a corporate finance or investment analyst job). I'm fairly certain I would get hired for something like a labor management job, I just really don't see a future in that route, which is to say nothing bad about them.   I suppose the overall theme is that when it comes to what I want to do, I never seem to be able to get it. I have a tons and tons of desire and no success, and it's hell. I'm trying to figure out what's different at a core level in myself compared to other successful people in the fields I'm interested in. No one seems to be able to explain it.  Robert Greene's The 48 Laws of Power talks about avoiding the unlucky -- I really don't want to be that person that successful people avoid, but I'm almost certain that's what's happening."

Recently a friend of mine was diagnosed as bi-polar and I've met people who suffered with depression. They have told me.  I'm just unsure how I proceed ? Can I ask questions or avoid the subject until they decide to speak about it ?   I don't want to cause a situation where a friend is awkward. I have absolutely no clue with mental health issues so I'm asking to find how people with experience related to them would prefer.
mentalhealth,3dxtkm,wilkinson_blade,3,Mon Jul 20 13:59:59 2015 UTC,"I had a friend ask about my depression recently and it was really interesting to talk to him about it. I felt it made us closer and that he was genuinely interested in my world. Unfortunately, I can't remember how it came up in the conversation. I think it's probably best to wait until the effected person brings it up and then engage openly about it. Although, if you want them to know you're there for them you can always say that and see if they want to talk more. The main thing is to follow their lead."
mentalhealth,3dwsne,KoalifiedBear,3,Mon Jul 20 04:37:04 2015 UTC,"Sounds like there may be some depression going on... it would explain a lot of the symptoms you describe.  Seeing as you're 18 and going off to college, perhaps you'd be interested in seeking out counseling on your college campus?"

mentalhealth,3dwsne,acakewithwings,1 point,Mon Jul 20 07:03:09 2015 UTC,"I can very much relate to what you described in terms of not being suicidal, but just feeling like you have nothing to live for. However, the main difference I'd say is that I have a clear understanding of why I feel like that because of my life circumstances. Since you said that you were starting college, are in a healthy relationship and didn't mention anxiety, I would examine the time when you said you started to feel differently for an underlying cause, no matter how small it might seem. Depression is a self perpetuating spiral where negative thoughts/actions just reinforce themselves and start to build up - telling yourself 'I'm not going to get out of bed because I feel depressed' is a prime example of this. A technique I use to try and make up for a complete lack of motivation is to try and live my life on autopilot. I identify the things that I know I 'should' be doing to provide me with a sense of achievement, and just make myself do them without thinking. I would expect starting college to benefit you a lot in this regard.  Reading a book and not taking any of it in also sounds a lot like myself. In terms of finding activities pleasurable again, I think it comes down to having things in your life that offer you a sense of achievement (college/work) that aren't necessarily enjoyable. This causes you to value your 'free' time more which I think you'll find rekindles your interest in activities after a while.  Also as a side note - since you mentioned that you were a vegetarian and listed fruit/vegetables under a 'balanced' diet, I would seriously consider looking at your protein and especially fat intake. As someone who suffers from anorexia, I can say that lacking in dietary fat has had a PROFOUND effect on my mental health, more so than I think most people would expect."
mentalhealth,3dwsne,Fragility_,0,Mon Jul 20 09:43:34 2015 UTC,"As the others have said it seems like depression.   Also, something I've noticed about myself and others after graduating/leaving high school or even just turning 18 is that there seems to be a period like this among most during that time. I'm not saying you didn't already suffer from depression and that it will end once you go to college, but last year and about half of this year my anxiety and depression issues were heavily exacerbated by a sense of being lost in the world and not knowing what to do with my life now that the ""glory days"" were over and everyone was settling into adulthood.   I only bring this up to tell you that things will probably get better but you have to trust yourself and know who you are. If you don't know already don't be afraid to find out. Mothers and fathers, though they love you, aren't always the best people to talk to about psychological issues either. As lauren said above you should try the college counselor if these issues haven't been resolved by then and they might not be. These things take time to sort out and overcome."

They will know better than anyone if A) The sister actually could use being committed, and B) Whether you have anything you can do as their sister.  Bad decision making isn't necessarily a mental health issue.  Now, for the particular sisters:  Sister 1 (Married sister): Even if you think he is a dumbass, contact her husband and talk to him.  Explain your concerns, and give him those same names and numbers.  I would also try talking to her directly - explain you are concerned, think she could benefit from talking to someone, etc.  If she is refusing, end it there - be supportive, but realize that you can't help someone that just doesn't want help.    Sister 2: ....I would seriously consider calling child services on them.

Partial seizures can look like panic attacks, but there's some differences. You mentioned she loses the ability to talk when this happens. This is what happened to me when I had my seizure. I couldn't speak and if I tried to force myself to, the words would come out garbled.   There's different types of partial seizures like simple partial seizures and complex partial seizures. I would look into both of those and discuss this with her to see if it sounds like it could be this. It could also be a psychogenic non-epileptic seizure. These are seizures without a physical cause and can be triggered by things like anxiety and stress.   The best thing she can do is talk to a doctor so they can try to figure out what's wrong. If it is indeed a seizure, she can ask to have an EEG done.

Most rational parents have some recall of being a teen and KNOW it's not perfect and can be very challenging. Parents are sometimes more aware and smarter than you think.    On the other hand, there are some parents who are clueless.  Either way, if you feel you need help and to speak with a professional, you have to summon up the courage to simply sit down with parent and tell the truth.  ""Mom, Dad, although all in all I am doing okay, I AM having some issues I'd like to discuss with a professional. Nothing against You, Mom and Dad, but I'd like to schedule an appt with a therapist who specializes in young peoples issues. Will you help me do that please? (chances are you do NOT need a psychiatrist, they are for folks who have severe mental illness. A counselor/therapist is generally one's first stop)  Most parents will A. Be glad you spoke up. B.   will happily help you. C. will STILL worry about you 'cause you're their kid and parents naturally worry. It's about love.    Finally, needing help and having the guts to ask for it signals you are NOT  ""some damaged kid"" but rather one who recognizes when help is needed and is mature enough to ask for it.

Others prefer to think of their problems as, for example, an aspect of their personality which sometimes gets them into trouble but which they would not want to be without.”       The report adds that antipsychotic medications are sometimes helpful, but that “there is no evidence that it corrects an underlying biological abnormality.” It then warns about the risk of taking these drugs for years.       -- http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/18/opinion/sunday/t-m-luhrmann-redefining-mental-illness.html  The truth is you can't even prove anyone else even has ""auditory hallucinations""- people can just make it up.  And if they do actually hear a voice from their own mind, we can know they're based on the person's internal dialogue/thinking because there's nothing else.

A psychiatrist does not want to talk to you or offer solutions.  They want to label you with a ""mental illness"" label (which could destroy your life) and drug you, even if you say no.    If you say no, they can (and very often will) forcefully drug you via kidnapping & forced druggings.  It's very dangerous & rape-like.  And it doesn't matter much what you say- they twist your words.  ie, they get paid more to diagnose, and thus ""interpret"" (twist) people's words to match some label.  And (with no due process) you risk being kidnapped/imprisoned for life.  (Usually, it's however long they can make money of keeping you imprisoned.)  And if you don't study psychiatry, you don't know what not to say.  eg, simply saying you ""don't trust other people"" is an easy way to be labeled a ""schizophrenic"" or ""paranoid schizophrenic.""  That label could destroy your life.  As someone so young (young enough to almost surely have health insurance) this puts you at a greater risk.

The person(s) don't even have to be told what they're accused of. And such people are treated like animals- violently beaten, suffocated, tied up, (etc) during forceful druggings.  All without any evidence/conviction of any crime.  And no video recordings protect these torture victims from allegations by recording the ""interviews"" with their torturers.  (Such could easily exist & belong to the accused.)  Such imprisonment (a life sentence) is a form of murder to honest people.   There are rights that people have even if they have mental illnes   People accused of ""mental illness"" in psychiatric prisons have essentially no human rights.  They are slaves of the psychiatrists violently terrozing them & torturing them.   , they is time limits on lengths of being held for   Wrong.  The various ""time limits"" don't apply if the psychiatrist simply accuses the person of being potentialy dangerous.   they have the right to not take their meds and the right to refuse to be given medication.    Wrong.  If the victim refuses the drugs (they aren't ""medication"") the psychiatrists can simply say the person lacks the mental capacity to decide, which is a common allegation according to people I've spoken with who are survivors of such torture.

Lets start with some basic questions   Why are you here in /r/mentalhealth to spout off about your anti psychiatry view point? Are you here for the solo reason to just troll people who are looking for help?   Also from the rules on the right hand side >Please show respect and empathy when replying to personal posts.
mentalhealth,3drxi4,dunraim,-2,Sun Jul 19 19:13:07 2015 UTC,"Please show respect and empathy    If you have respect & empathy for people, you don't violently torture them.  You don't use rape-like suffocation & beatings to a tied up person in forced druggings.    And you don't murder innocent/unconvicted people via life prison sentences if you have respect and empathy for them.  It's psychiatrists who show no empathy for the people they torture.      The truth is, when people say ""I'm thinking of going to a psychiatrist"" I find almost every time they're thinking of a therapist.    And they should be warned about the incredible danger of simply talking to a psychiatrist, and how psychiatrists get paid to ""diagnose"" & thus it's very likely they'll leave with a made up ""diagnosis"" even if they didn't want one.  Possibly a life destroying one.  eg for simply saying ""I don't trust others.""  That is not so-called ""schizophrenia.""  It's a normal response to a world full of bad people & profiteers to not blindly trust others."

When you feel up for it, try to think back to where this idea of being a wimp came from. I'm guessing that someone told you that when you were young and you believed them. Because you were too young to understand why they were doing that: not because it was true, but probably because it made them feel better to make you feel bad.

A psychiatrist will want to put you on an ""atypical"" antipsychotic (meaning it's a newer drug with less of the bad side effects commonly produced by the older generation of drugs) and see you regularly to monitor your symptoms.   You don't have to be a slave to this disease. You don't have to be scared. Please get help. 10% of all schizophrenics will end up committing suicide. Half of homeless people are schizophrenics.

These are all very important things to make sure that you do well, and consistently, so that the drugs can have the desired effect. Talk to your doctor because the symptoms should be better with medication and not worse. Do not stop taking your meds though. If you are not taking them as prescribed this could be a big reason why you aren't getting the relief you want.   Is your family supportive? Talk to them about what you're going through."

mentalhealth,3dnwys,Gdolf,4,Sat Jul 18 01:39:03 2015 UTC,"Be careful with that alcohol, OK? There are certain psychiatry medications that should not be taken with alcohol because it causes them to be metabolized more quickly and basically not work as well as they should.  And what do you mean ""when I take my meds?"" I'm just curious about the word ""when"" because it makes it sound as if you're not taking your medication all the time. Again, your medications should not make the voices worse, and it's concerning to me that that seems to be the case, at least in your opinion. Please, please, please tell your doctor about this. He may want to put you on another medication regimen. One year with the same regimen is more than enough time to tell if it's working or not. Again, it's trial and error. It's very hard and frustrating sometimes to accept that fact, but be strong and hang in there. These medications do help. And when you talk to your doctor, make sure you tell him exactly the voices are saying.  Keep talking with your dad about the issue. Don't worry about your mom so much, because in my experience it often happens that one parent is more supportive than the other. Sometimes it's denial. Sometimes it's ignorance of the illness itself. Schizophrenia, for the most part, means hearing voices that are not there, along with some other criteria. I'm sure you've read enough about it to know what I'm talking about."

mentalhealth,3dnwys,ravia,3,Fri Jul 17 21:50:53 2015 UTC,"8 year schizophrenic here. The voices aren't real. They're a paranoid hallucination. When I'm in a situation where the voices are threatening or persecutory I find logic is the best answer. For instance, why in the world would 2 people who have manged to attain psychic powers worry about you?   Respidone is a generic medication. It's pretty old, and there are waaayy better medications out there. The only reason I can see someone being on it is if they're going to a state funded facility for medication. The voices aren't going to stop until you can get on better or at least different medications. I take 80mg of Geodon twice a day. The voices should be quiet while taking these medications, but it sounds like they are getting worse. You need a private psychiatrist and you ALWAYS must be 100% honest with them. With the Obama healthcare system you should be able to get mental health coverage (insurance companies don't group it with basic prescription insurance) from an insurance provider. If the voices aren't getting better, change the medications. You say you don't want to live an unproductive life, but what kind of quality of life can you have if you are constantly thinking you're under attack?   Something you need to look out for is command hallucinations. For instance something like ""Run, get out of here."" or the more extreme ""Hurt this person"". You never are obligated to do anything the voices tell you to do. Always remember that the voices are a product of your brain. So in that sense you can make them say anything, and if you'll notice your subconscious mind usually will ""lead"" the voices. Think about being able to contact people with just your thoughts. The pope, the president, anyone. Now contact someone who you absolutely KNOW isn't real. Like a cartoon character. I dunno, that kind of made it clear, to me, that the voices were just hallucinations. Find a way to break them."

Speaking with a therapist can help you identify and work on behaviors that you may see as self destructive.   If you want a diagnosis, you'll have to speak with a doctor. They're the only ones qualified to do so.   Depending on where you live, seeing a doctor may be covered by universal healthcare.

mentalhealth,3dpx9t,Megalandrys,2,Sat Jul 18 08:21:38 2015 UTC,"I am new to reddit and just clicked this thread. But my first question is how old are you, OP? The story seems to insinuate you are in headed into the 8th grade. Some of the things just seem like typical teenage behavior. Being lethargic, figuring things out about what does and doesn't give pleasure regarding sex, experimenting with a few drops of alcohol and a couple cigarettes, etc. These are all things typical with that phase of life. As far as being socially awkward and a little lonely due to not many companions/friends, those are both typical too.    But there are some things that seem like they could use a bit more attention. I am glad you are being proactive in your pursuit of answers to your behavior that you've decided to seek out more information. Your body image issues and your hallucinations both particularly stick out as things you ought to discuss more. The first thing I'd advise you to do is get the adults you trust the most in on the loop. That is a hard conversation to have, but I think you need to have it. It may be your parents, it may be a teacher, it may be a mentor. But tell someone other than reddit. After that, I do think seeing a psychiatrist or a psychologist (or both) would be beneficial. They know better than any redditor would the best way to proceed. Just be honest with them and be receptive to what they say.   Good luck to you. Be safe."
mentalhealth,3dpx9t,JustBSimple,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:13:44 2015 UTC,"See, your correct in your guess, but these didn't start when I was a teenager, they started before I even entered adolescence, for the most part, but most of what I talked about either got stronger or just appeared in the past year or so. The thing is though, and this is the main problem, I ask for help here, but I don't want to live without this part of me. It is me, and I don't want medication or ""help"" from some adult to make me any different. I don't want to be some regular person going about in some routine, ""normal"" life.   I've talked to a physician before, as noted, but this was months ago, and even then I didn't tell him everything (my fault and time's fault), and I don't want to go back. My parents think they know some of it, but I told them less than the physician.   It's not just a hard conversation, it's one that won't come up again."
mentalhealth,3dpx9t,JustBSimple,2,Sun Jul 19 21:32:36 2015 UTC,"You're young, so I can't fault you for being hesitant. Medication, if that is suggested to you, and any sort of change are scary concepts. I can understand why you want to resist. But at the same time, I think you know you need to get a grasp on what's going on. I noticed you said something about wanting to be like Syd Barrett. Well Syd was a creative genius, but he also lost his band and had constant hardships throughout his life because his mental health issues (coupled with drug abuse) consumed him. He eventually withdrew from public life all together. Read about what really happened. It wasn't a glamorous affair at all.   That is why I am urging you to have that conversation with those you trust. A psychologist who specializes in adolescent health is probably who could offer you a safe place to listen, a place to sort out what your going through, as well as the best guidance if you are willing to take it. No one can force you to take advice or to take medication. You are the one who is ultimately responsible. Your parents and specialists can help though. If you are lucky enough to have people who listen to you and can be supportive, don't be afraid to lean on them. So many others don't. Get the help you need. You have a whole lot of life left in front of you. Take the proactive route."

mentalhealth,3dn9sz,Lstn2TownesVanZandt,2,Fri Jul 17 18:08:11 2015 UTC,I totally agree with Lstn2TownesVanZandt. I think you need to ask him directly. Tell him that you are concerned about him and then listen to him. If he is contemplating killing himself then ask him if he would consider talking to a professional before he acted. Then get him to someone with some skills. Even a suicide hotline if that's all you have available. Many cities have crisis centers as well as phone lines. Hospital's are never my first choice but if that's all that you got go there.
mentalhealth,3dn9sz,wilkinson_blade,3,Fri Jul 17 18:22:43 2015 UTC,I third this suggestion. Ask him directly. Ask him if he's willing to get some help or if there's anything you can do (if you're willing) to help.

mentalhealth,3doqt0,throwitawayforsecret,1 point,Sat Jul 18 00:32:54 2015 UTC,"Hey, I grew up with similar stuff but I had the good fortune to not live with my parents throughout high school. It sounds like your established relationship and mannerism with your parents is that of an angsty teenager, and sometimes, that's always going to be your relationship. Parents nag. Or tell you that you messed up. Or have completely different plans and expectations for how you should be. Sometimes you luck out and have nice parents who still do these things, and sometimes you have horrible parents that will tear you down to win an argument, not sure where yours fall in that spectrum. The lower end will definitely make your self-esteem plummet.  If you dislike that you have a short temper specifically towards your parents, you can glance at some anger management references and try stuff out. Especially stuff with conflict resolution and effective communication. Personally I've always been the type to just say ""Sure"" and ""Okay"", be upset, leave and collect myself, then tell someone how I feel. My own parents molded me to be non-confrontational to a fault. Even without the visible anger I still had to learn to communicate. Even now, sometimes I do this extremely reasonably and sometimes I make the mistake of holding on to resentment even if I don't actively get angry.  Yes, it's pretty normal, most people suck at expressing themselves or communicating when pushed hard emotionally. Yes, most people have certain things they hate about themselves, and certain  events that happened that they know they have no one else to really blame for. In terms of a boyfriend and certain people bringing out things, you absolutely would want someone who is a friend first and a boyfriend second, preferably without a similar fault. If you dislike how angry you get with your parents, it will absolutely come up in a relationship and you should make sure a boyfriend does not argue the way your parents do, whether it's raising voice to the nth degree, degrading you, or whatever really causes you to enter that state where you need to escalate.  edit: Wanted to add that in my line of work I help people with behavioral issues, mental illness and substance abuse, and the fact that you're mindful of what causes you to get angry and able to recognize that you dislike acting that way gives you a huge advantage, many people will jump from relationship to relationship and burn bridges and only see a glimpse of the issue, if they even acknowledge they had any part in it."

How a certain drug will actually effect you can only be discovered by taking it That's why it's important to find a good doctor or psychiatrist to explore which med will be right for you. Avoiding all meds because some people suffer from some side effects seems like overkill.  That being said a good therapist can totally change your life.

mentalhealth,3dmew7,pillsdontdoSHIT,2,Fri Jul 17 16:46:29 2015 UTC,I'm sure there are a bunch of guides on this subreddit and on-line that will be more concise and thoughtful than any ideas I have but I will leave you with two.  What do you think you're looking for in a therapist? Do you want someone to compassionately listen and understand you? Do you want some techniques that will help you cope? Do you want to talk about your past and why you are the way you are? Do you want to deal with what is happening in your life right now? Do you want to be challenged?  What you are looking for in your therapy will determine the type of therapist you should hire. You don't have to know about all the schools of thought but the clearer you can be about your own therapeutic needs the easier it will be to find a therapist who will work for you.  I will also say that actually liking your therapist is the single most important thing when it comes to successful therapy. If you don't really like them then move on.  There are a lot of therapists in the world and you don't need to waste your time and money on someone who you don't really connect with.

I am coming to learn that therapy is so much more than just going to talk to some stranger and cry.... the more I research the more I realize that they can actually offer other types of help.  call me ignorant I guess.....  or scared to even acknowledge I could benefit from it and therefore never really looked for any info.  and again, I really appreciate you taking the time to write all that for me."

You fire enough therapists for being incompetent and immoral assholes, and suddenly it's going to be a lot harder to find a therapist willing to take your case.  And no, you won't be able to do shit about it, because they don't have to take you as a patient and there's no way you could prove to a jury that it's because they blabbed about you.  No matter how many times therapists have blabbed to you about their former patients."

I question how valuable exercise really is but every one seems to swear by it and I know I'll feel shifty if I just stay inside like a slug.  This gets me out and active a couple of times a week.  It also forces me to interact with people which I miss when I isolate myself.   I also hire a helper or personal assistant.  Sometimes I put an ad on Craig's List or hire my nice.  The fact is I know I'm going to get nothing done really soon and I'm going to feel even worse about that.  Hiring someone for a few hours every week to help me do house cleaning or laundry or answer emails means these things don't pile up around me.   I say yes to every invitation and I go if I possibly can. I can leave after 30 minutes if I want to but I must show up.    Yes, these things are difficult and cost money but they keep me going when things are getting bad and make the badness a little more bearable.

mentalhealth,3dgkdj,justanAme99,1 point,Thu Jul 16 04:18:33 2015 UTC,"My first recommendation to anyone is to try to find a support group, Any support group is okay at first, and the follow up to that group is to find some safe people to call when you need to talk about this. You're not alone, and getting support is both available and free at least in noon professional form. Lots of options from there, but Adult Children of Alcoholics, and Codependents Anonymous, are the first groups that are available to anyone searching for freedom from anything really.  Also, these people know many of the good therapists in the area as well.  Secondly, you're pretty normal in fact. This is a fairly common fear, and developing new patterns will help even if just small changes.  Good luck and I hope you find some safety quickly for yourself."

mentalhealth,3dhwho,skepticismismynature,1 point,Thu Jul 16 12:16:55 2015 UTC,"I just wanted to say that I believe, because of the fact that it's considered inappropriate, that the normal range of manipulative behaviors in people are underestimated and underreported. It's very possible that your feelings, the spontaneous self loathing/self aggrandizing and difficulties with feeling happy for other's achievements are all perfectly normal. Most folks just don't talk about it. I feel like for your age and gender these are relatively mundane and you may well gain perspective on them as you grow older.  I've heard that before 25 most thought is dominated by impulses, then around 25 something switches, the frontal lobe starts having more influence and thought/action patterns change quite a bit.   In the meantime, if you're looking for attention at times, why not get it in a healthier way? You're certainly not too young to learn an instrument or some other form of performance. Folks routinely compliment performers, even when they're beginners and you'd have an outlet for emotions. Learning a skill can have profound effects on self esteem and self discipline, both of which can help level out disconcerting thought patterns.  So, I think you're OK. If you're worried about it there's never any shame in seeing a therapist, but you're not broken and if you were truly a ""villain"" you'd never have felt any guilt.   (Side note, sociopaths are people too. I believe there are few truly bad folks in the world, just some need more support than others.)"
mentalhealth,3dhv2o,scarbageaccount,1 point,Thu Jul 16 12:01:40 2015 UTC,"I've seen similar behaviors in one person who has never been diagnosed with any condition. They were just very wrapped up in conspiracy theories and slowly lost touch with what many interact with as reality. Conspiracies can sometimes resonate so deeply with someone that they feel zealous about them and then persecuted because it's not considered a mainstream truth. Anyone offering an opposing viewpoint will hear ""you just need to open your eyes"" or ""you're just not able to understand"". Most conspiracies build and reinforce one another, as do the folks in the community. In my experience it's not uncommon for those heavily entrenched to experience some kind of shared delusion or break with reality while being fairly neurotypical.  Although in my experience I've also seen this kind of behavior in an untreated paranoid schizophrenic friend of mine while they were off their meds.  If you want more information about how to address someone stuck in conspiracy land I'd go over to r/skeptic or even r/conspiratard. I think they'd be able to help you gather some perspectives and information on just how intense things can be even before there's a psychiatric condition to be concerned about. Otherwise, in circumstances like this it's often good to pull back contact. Deprogramming takes a long time and most conspiracy related material (despite what many will claim) is propaganda designed to create a powerful reaction, it can send even highly logical people into a reactionary state. It's significantly more concerning when folks are exposed who are more subvertible.   Actually, you're welcome to message me about this situation if you feel it would help, especially if those subreddits don't end up getting you anywhere. Those beliefs can grow every bit as strong as the most heated religious fervor and it's often underestimated, the profound effect of feeling privy to some secret knowledge folks begin to separate from society."

mentalhealth,3dh5ad,Jumpbutton,1 point,Thu Jul 16 07:32:03 2015 UTC,I agree that adult ADD seems likely. You need to ask your GP for a referral to a psychiatrist. You live in Canada so it's all paid for by your taxes. There is often a wait list of 2-3 months. Psychiatrists know way more about this stuff than GPs and as ADD drugs are restricted they can be hard to get from a regular doctor. Also the psychiatrist will work with you to find the right medication for your unique symptoms. Mindfulness meditation may help while you're waiting to see a psychiatrist.  Good luck!

If you're troubled by your inability to focus and there's a safe reliable treatment why wouldn't you try it? Maybe your problem isn't ADD but it's certainly worth investigating.  Not sure about the walk-in clinic but I don't see why not. You should try to find a good GP though. A good working relationship w a regular doctor will prove invaluable in the futur"
mentalhealth,3dh5ad,wilkinson_blade,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:45:36 2015 UTC,me again.  Here are two resources for finding a doctor in Ontario. Way better to have your own GP than to use walk-in clinics. Community Health Centres are best if there's one near you. The doctors there are salaried so they aren't trying to rush you out the door and take the time to learn about you.  http://www.ontario.ca/page/find-family-doctor-or-nurse-practitioner  https://www.oma.org/Pages/FindaDoctor.aspx

mentalhealth,3dh5ad,wilkinson_blade,1 point,Fri Jul 17 01:56:11 2015 UTC,"If you've got a history of impulsive use of drugs and alcohol ADHD medication is not your friend unless your doctor has a med contract requiring regular drug tests (this is common in the states but I'm not sure about Canada). Those meds are addictive, abusable and do not play well with other drugs and alcohol.  If you're taking  recreational drugs though you're not doing yourself any favors. I don't have any moral issues or axes to grind with drugs, I'm just saying that if your mind is unpredictable you're making it more unpredictable with the drugs. With many of them, the pleasure folks feel from them is relief from withdrawal, almost like wearing tight shoes all day for the relief of taking them off. If you can't stop, you're likely addicted, even if what you're doing isn't physically addictive. I'd forget the psych meds until you'd get that sorted there's not much a doctor could or even should do when there's a risk of interaction with street drugs the doc doesn't know about. That could get you dead. If nothing else just stop to see if you do feel better. Generally takes a few months to level off."

Seeing something like this is the emotional equivalent of being hit by a baseball bat. It leaves us shocked and distressed for some time, and it is not something that you will ever forget. Im glad that you found writing about it helpful, and PossibleAssHats great sensitive comments useful. I really support your intention of going to the funeral and talking more. I hope this doesnt sound silly but keep reminding yourself that it is normal to have all sorts of strong reactions to this, including very vivid memories/images. Writing helps so it may be useful to do some more. Because of the way our brain works it can help to keep talking/writing (it uses a different part of the brain to the intense images). Nice scents can help disrupt distressing images for some people (Basically for the same reason) If thing s are still distressing after a month or so then you may seek professional help, but I wouldn't do that too soon as most of us do find that these things settle naturally, although it often leaves us a different person."
mentalhealth,3ddc7t,acmercer,6,Wed Jul 15 15:15:29 2015 UTC,"Hi there, I'm a paramedic.  Unfortunately there's no real trick to erasing what you've seen from your memory. Yes it is shocking and traumatizing, disgusting and sickening even. The important thing is how you handle having had to see it. It sounds to me like you're handling it fairly well. First, talking about it and just getting it off your chest is vital. So many people just bottle it up and convince themselves and others that they're not bothered and this leads to endless dwelling on it and it will eat away at your mind.  The other important thing to remember(and it doesn't sound like this is really a concern of yours, is it?) is that there is truly nothing more you could have done. It sounds harsh but that man was going to die. This could have happened outside the front door of the hospital, from what you described it doesn't sound like anything was going to save him. That might sound cruel or pessimistic but it is also essential for us to understand. I hope you're not being hard on yourself over that.  It will stick with you for a while but it will eventually stop consuming you every day. You'll still think about it from time to time in the future. That's normal of course. If anything use it as a lesson for yourself and others to be safe on the roads. I won't make assumptions as to what caused the crash but it was almost certainly avoidable, being a single vehicle crash. Could've been avoiding an animal, I suppose, but who knows. Just don't drink and drive. Don't speed, especially at night or in bad weather. Don't text and drive. For God's sake wear your seatbelt. All of the accident scenes I've been to have only reinforced this for me. At least let it do that much for you and your partner/friends.  You sound like a kind, level-headed person. Try to stay that way :)  Edit: also I just saw /u/divers69 response which has some great advice.  Edit 2: fixed some typos."

mentalhealth,3ddc7t,divers69,1 point,Fri Jul 17 10:44:57 2015 UTC,"My mom died almost a year ago and I was haunted for weeks by the image of her gasping for her final breath. At totally random moments I'd be back in that room and it was horrific. I was seeing a psychiatrist who helped me deal with those flashbacks and her technique was super helpful to me. Hopefully it will be helpful for you as well.  First find an object that you can discreetly carry with you. I had a ring but it could be anything small that you can have with you at all times. Then while holding the object think of a good memory. Now get right inside that memory. What does it smell like? Sound like? Look like? Where is the light coming from what are the characteristics of it? My psychiatrist asked me between 50 and 100 questions about that memory, maybe more. Exploring it from every sense. The whole time I was in that memory I kept touching and playing with that ring. I don't think you would need anyone else to ask the questions i.e. I assume this would work if you asked them yourself but the point is to go deep into this memory and suck up every bit of information you can about it. If you aren't quite sure of an answer make it up. You want to reconstruct this good place to the nth degree.  Then, when the horrible image flashes into your head, you grab the object that you built the good memory around and take yourself back to the place of the good memory. Because you've mapped it out with regard to all of your senses it's a very strong image/feeling and kind of blows the horrible one out of your mind.   I've been doing this for many months now. I can't stop the horrible image from coming. I don't know how to do that. But I can leave it so quickly that it's almost powerless. I don't need the ring any more either. I just touch the finger where it used to be and I'm transported. The good memory is so good and so full that the terrible memory kind of fades away by comparison. It's still there but it doesn't f*&k me up the way it used to.  Hope that is helpful to you.  tl;dr Use an object and recreate a really good memory using all of your senses. When the bad image comes touch the object and replace the horrible memory with the good one. Sounds cheesy but it actually works."
mentalhealth,3ddc7t,wilkinson_blade,2,Thu Jul 16 03:09:40 2015 UTC,"It does work ! Really sound advice. I would emphasize that it can be a good memory, or it can be an idealised safe/lovely image. The more vivid we can make the image the better, so what do I see (eg: a lovely mountain with a lake), what do I hear (eg: the birds chirping, what do I feel (eg: the sand squishing between my toes), and crucially what do I smell (eg: pine trees or a favourite scent). Smell is often something that we neglect but often the smell of a horrible memory is really evocative. Carrying something that has nice memories/associations smell can help to move us away from the distressing memory. Like wilkinson_blade says, we cannot (and indeed should not) stop the memory. It happened. But things like this help us place the memory in its rightful place which is the past. Doing stuff like this links 2 parts of the brain, the one that has the frozen memory and the more present oriented forebrain. All these things link the 2, and help prevent longer term problems. BTW: Im not sure I am doing this right as Im pretty new to Reddit. Have I put this in the right place for jjayrambo to see? Sorry ! Edit: In doing this it is important to practice so that we lay down a 'good scene' track that we can easily access when we choose. Run thro it a lot when feeling OK so it is more accessible if/when a troubling image arises. 2nd Edit to clarify that I mean something that has nice associations, not a smell that reminds us of the horrible event."
mentalhealth,3dec4d,Honeychile6841,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:38:16 2015 UTC,"[Sorry for long post]  I thought so too, but the meds or the therapy never seem to do that, and after years and years of expecting things ""to come back"" I have but one thing to say: nothing's coming back. You have to do it yourself.   Mad at yourself for being a lazy slug? Well, yeah, so am I, I really am, and there are times when I realise I am (at the moment) being a lazy slug- and I'm dissatisfied with myself- as you probably are, too. So what do you do, then?   Do you continue being a slug or do you get up and do something?   More often than not, during bad times, I'll just continue being lazy and unproductive even when I feel it's bad for me, and this just makes me feel even worse.  ""I can't.""   ""I don't have the energy.""  ""It's too hard.""  ""There's nothing I really want to do.""  ""There's too many things I should be doing and I won't be able to do all of them anyway so what's the point.""  Being a slug is just so much easier.   But we don't want this.  Sadly, or luckily, there's no magic pill for that. You're going to have to put effort into it. Productivity and activity in general are a thing of habit, and if you've been feeling down and ill for a while, you no longer possess that habit- you just have to start again.   You've picked yourself up, and that is GREAT.   Now you gotta carry on. And, guess what, you can.   Even if you were never productive, organised or disciplined before, you CAN become some or all of those things. We're so damn adaptable, it's ridiculous!  Set some guidelines for yourself, get someone else's help, give yourself some general idea of what you want to be doing, and don't think it's irrelevant even if it's small.   When I'm at my lowest, if I make sure I have breakfast, lunch and dinner and cook for myself and my husband at a set time, I already feel like I have a better grasp of things.   Get enough sleep and get active. Doing any sort of physical activity for a longer time is extremely helpful at getting disciplined. Check out /r/getdisciplined for some tips if you'd like.   Remember just this, though, baby steps.   You'll get there, and you'll be so very proud. But, in the meantime, remember to breathe and take it as it comes. BUT TAKE IT!"

mentalhealth,3deref,mythrowawayacc123212,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:24:38 2015 UTC,"Smoke good weed.  In moderation.  Okay, feel free to take that as a joke.  It's not, but so as to not get in trouble, let's say it is.  All joking aside,  You're assuming a lot about the kind of people you're working with.  If I'm at a meeting and a young intern is standing up and stuttering and gulping, all I'm going to think is, ""The kid is nervous.""  Then if he bucks up and shows some self-confidence, I'm going to think, ""Good for him, he's pulling it together.""  I'm not saying that to humor you.  That is literally how I would imagine myself reacting were I in the audience of such a meeting.  The idea of him ""faking"" something does not come into play at all.  Especially with an intern.  Sheesh.  They know you're inexperienced.  You're supposed to be inexperienced, or they'd be paying you properly.  My internship in software was my first time ever working with code I didn't write, and I was confused as hell.  The few times I pulled something from my education out of my sleeve and it proved useful, they were really impressed, like with a little kid charming his mother by doing something clever.  My point is you are acting like you are working in a room full of bullies who want to demean you for social quirks.  We have various words for a person who demeans another due to social quirks: ""asshole"" is one of them.  There are less assholes in the world than there are people who will have compassion for a struggling young intern and want to see to it that you are brought up to speed and feel included.  Those people we sometimes term ""decent human beings.""  You have to count on some of your co-workers being decent human beings.  If they're all assholes, you need to find a new workplace.  Look, most everybody just wants to get through their workday and go home.  Now, I'm going to do some wild assuming here.  You think people's eyes are all upon you, scrutinizing your every social grace, because that scenario literally did play out with the bullies of your past, be they from school or the family.  People actually did single you out and watch your every move and make fun of every little thing you did that could be picked on.  (Correct me if I'm wrong: I'm just seeing the smoke and figuring it means there's fire.)  The first thing to understand is that was abuse.  And the reason society makes a big deal out of abuse is that it has long-term, lifetime even, consequences on the abused person.  The second thing to understand is nobody is scrutinizing you that heavily anymore.  People will talk about the dangers of walking through life with a victim mentality, but it's even worse to have been a victim and not realize it.  To actively participate in covering it up by seeing yourself as the bad one, the incompetent one, the worthless one.  Sure, as we heal we do learn to shed our identities as victims because those identities hold us back from happiness and success.  But you can't get to that point without first having a pretty clear picture of what was done to you.  And that is a healing step in itself, because it allows you to stop demanding so much of yourself.  A victim identity is better than a worthless person identity.  Also, is the internship paid?  If not, you are literally free labor for them.  They're gonna be glad for whatever help they can get from you.  There's no such thing as faking.  Interning is part of your education.  You're there to learn.  Finally, I mentioned this in your last post, but if you haven't done so already, please, please get some face-to-face help.  There's no substitute for it.  Therapy.  Support groups.  Or find a church, (good) churches are full of broken people trying to heal and helping each other do it.  Whatever you have to do, just work to get to a place where you can talk to people face-to-face about the things obsessing you in your head.  That's really your first priority.  Oh, and also like I mentioned the last time we chatted: start loving yourself."

Except there people are aware that you are in the field and then it is less professional to give advice. No one here knows that. You're a person as well as a professional.  I was just saying this because you said really smart things there. Your advice IS valuable. Not more or less than the next person. As long as no one knows you're in the field.   Just my opinion. I've seen good and bad professionals. I know the bad ones will probably be all over the internet trying to impose shit on people with their qualifications. I DON'T think you are doing that. You are a good one because you just said that you feel like it's bad to do so. It is not. These people aren't your clients and you aren't trying to make them your clients and you don't seem full of yourself.  Don't leave possibly helpful advice out because of this. That's all I wanted to say. Sorry if this came off as rude or something. I just want people to get all the advice that they can, you know? You seem smart."

I have studied photography for the past two years, and I have found a great interest in ""Mental Health Art"". This means that I focus on specific mental illness and try to capture them in an image that people feel comfortable viewing, yet can relate to. I have a personal struggle with mental illnesses that comes across in my work allowing me to feel personally with my own work. This image has been put together in order to deliver a more personal message to the viewer. This could be how you feel suffering with anxiety, depression, bipolar, or much more.

Remeron tires you out and makes you hungry.  Vyvanse perks you up and curbs your appetite.  I'm surprised at how unenergetic I still feel but it keeps me from sleeping all day.  I'd give up the remeron way before I'd give up the Vyvanse.    Oh and the comment about the water bottle is totally true.

mentalhealth,3d86hv,patrickstarthatsme,5,Tue Jul 14 07:02:26 2015 UTC,"I can relate to this so much. I also have BPD, depression and major anxiety. I've also been on lots of different psych meds in the past, including Lamictal and Seroquil (though not at the same time).  The best advice I can give you for getting better is to find a psychologist/counselor/therapist that you connect with. Even if you have to go to every psychologist in town for therapy just to find someone you feel safe with and comfortable with, then do it. I think I went to about 7 different therapists before finding the one who has helped me so much the past five years. Be honest with your therapist, it will save you so much time and energy in this whole process. Don't expect to wake up one day and ""feel better"".  Feeling better is a process that will take time (probably more than you want it to but this is the hand we were dealt), some days you won't want to put the work in, some days you'll feel great and think that you don't need the meds or the therapy, but please keep going. I promise you can get better. You can get to a place where you want to live your life and you'll be excited about it. And I'm sure all of this sounds like bull, but as someone who has gone through it, I promise you can be better. It takes time, a lot of hard work, you'll probably have some setbacks that will be very disheartening but it's all worth it.  I completely understand not wanting to live anymore. But, luckily through therapy and medication and honestly, just trying to think more positively (something which my mind doesn't like doing) I've found that I have so much to live for. And I know that you do too, maybe you just haven't figured out what that is yet.  I hope you find the help you deserve, no one should have to go through anything like this alone. I hope my advice helps, best of luck to you!"

I absolutely agree with meggers8806, you need a therapist. finding one that you trust and click with is super duper hard. do you have anyone (a friend, family, etc.) who can encourage you through the process? I find it is helpful to have someone who won't let you slip away from the task.   you have a lot of work to do. it will suck. it will hurt. you'll have times where you think it's the worst decision you've ever made. but it's not. it's the best decision. and when - not if - you come out of the quagmire, you'll find out why."

mentalhealth,3d84g1,niller93,3,Tue Jul 14 06:38:42 2015 UTC,"First of all, I am so sorry that you had such a negative experience. But, I can also relate. I checked into a mental hospital for three days once, and I can safely say it was the worst experience of my life (and definitely didn't help me).  The only medication you listed that I'm familiar with is Trazadone, and I know that I was instructed to take it at bedtime because it can make you sleepy (plus I have sleep issues so it helped with that). But I have no idea how long those meds will be in your system. That might be something you could just google, I'm not sure. The best advice I can give you is what it sounds like you already plan on doing- seek an outside medical source not associated with the hospital you were at (if that's possible, I know it some towns it's hard to find a doctor that doesn't also work for the hospital). Find a therapist/psychologist/counselor that you TRUST and feel comfortable with.  That in itself can be extremely difficult, but therapy is only going to be helpful to you if you like the person helping you. Also, find a psychiatrist (the one who can actually prescribe meds) that you trust and feel comfortable with. Be honest with your doctors, it will save you a lot of time and energy if you're completely upfront with them about things. If/when you get put on medication, research the meds, keep track of any symptoms or side effects you're having while on them, and inform your doctors of anything you think they should know about. I really hope you find the help you're looking for. And I really hate that you had such a negative experience, but unfortunately, from my own experiences and talking to other people, it seems most people don't have very good experiences in mental hospitals/psych wards. So know that you're not alone at all!  I hope you find some great doctors who help you however you need it.  Good luck!"
mentalhealth,3d84g1,meggers8806,2,Tue Jul 14 07:50:36 2015 UTC,"I went in on Thursday willingly - admitted with the help of my mom. I believe I was having a panic attack (shaking - couldn't think) along with feeling suicidal due to life piling on pressures ( has happened a few times since I was a young teen - leading to 2 prior stays in the minor ward which I have a hard time remembering the details of those stays but anyways )    Kudos to you for being so open to getting help!   my turn came with the doctor who prescribes medication 50mg topamax for anxiety (to start that night) and 5mg of Saphris for depression (to take in the morning) - after spending a total of maybe 15-20 minutes speaking with me- she kept toting the fact that the pills will help me lose weight which I never mentioned anyways,    Topamax (also known as topiramate) is a drug that's prescribed for a number of conditions, including seizures, migraines, mood disorders, and addictions. It's also prescribed in combo w/ other psychiatric meds to help off-set weight gain. Drowsiness and fatigue, as well as ""muddled thinking"" and difficulty verbalizing words, are common side effects.  Saphris (also known as asenapine) is a drug that's fairly new to the market (I think it was approved by the FDA in 2013) and is used to treat symptoms of schizophrenia and bipolar I disorder (manic depression). Unlike most other meds, it has to be absorbed under the tongue and not swallowed, otherwise it's completely ineffective. Compared to other drugs that treat the same symptoms, Saphris tends to result in fewer side effects, like weight gain. Like Topamax, and most other mood stabilizers and antipsychotic drugs, drowsiness and fatigue are common side effects of Saphris.        My mom came to visit and after it was time for her to go I took my meds (topamax and a Trazodone 50mg) as given to me by the nurse. I went out like a light and the next day I was in a state of utter confusion, the nurse told me I was just feeling a bit drowsy but I felt like I was going to fall of my face so I slept the day away. (I have taken trazadone in the past in that past before but NEVER have I felt that way)   My best guess is this is the result of the Trazodone, which is extremely sedating and used for insomnia, combining with the Topamax and Saphris that were in your system, resulting in a trifecta of drowsiness and fatigue. The sedating side effects of Topamax and Saphris typically wane and are no longer an issue after a few weeks, but until then they definitely can cause people to feel like they're exhausted or ""drunk"" all the time.   she tried telling me something about my thoughts being directly related to my emotions which lead to my actions along with me trying to take on other peoples pain on top of once again saying that pills will help me lose weight ( I understand I a medically obese at 5'6 and 215 pounds but I struggled to lose close to (I weighed close to 240 at one point) 25 pounds these past year via biking/walking/diet changes and I am quite happy with how I look right now and what I am able to do but she didnt ask me any of that - but anyways bit of a sore subject)   That sucks and it's unfortunate that it seems like the doctor didn't do a better job of understanding where you were coming from on top of repeatedly discussing the weight issue. What I can say is there is a very big push from insurance companies and public policies to get mental health doctors and therapists to better address a person's overall health and not just a person's mental health. This stems from growing awareness that many medications have side effects that result in physical issues, such as weight gain, increased risk for diabetes, increased risk for abnormal heart rhythm, etc. Many individuals benefit from medications but stop taking them or refuse to take them due to these kinds of side effects. My best guess is that the doctor was hoping you would take the meds if they talked up the benefits enough.    my nurse gave me papers to sign but was extremely impatient and kept telling me to just sign on the X which stupidly I did afraid that the doctor would find some reason to keep me for further treatment   Not stupid at all. Given the negative experience you had, it's understandable. What you signed was most likely standard hospital discharge paperwork.    Now that I am home overlooking the copy of what I signed I have apparently been dignosed with R/O schizoaffective disorder and Dysthymia??? I am throughly confused on what the hell happened and my thoughts are still muddled when speaking from the medications (I believe)   Dysthymia is a mood disorder. It's basically depression that someone has had consistently for a very long time and at a degree that is not as severe or w/ as clear of an onset and remission as something like major depressive disorder. Dysthymia is like the Eeyore (from Winnie the Pooh) of the mood disorder group.   The ""R/O schizoaffective disorder"" means ""rule out the diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder."" It's the doctor's way of saying given family history and symptoms shown while in the hospital the doctor believes schizoaffective disorder may be more of an accurate diagnosis, but they do not have enough evidence at this time to make that the official or primary diagnosis. It's helpful for any therapist or doctor you see in the future to know that so they can keep it in mind when doing assessments and figuring out which therapies or medications to try.  Schizoaffective disorder is a potential diagnosis when someone shows symptoms of both schizophrenia and a mood disorder but they don't meet the full criteria for one or the other alone. It's basically a combination of symptoms of schizophrenia (such as delusions, hallucinations, disorganized thinking/speech/behavior, or lack of speech, emotion, affect, motivation) AND an episodic mood disorder (depression, mania, hypomania, mixed). From the sounds of it, the doctor was under the impression you were refusing meds due to paranoia or an irrational fear, which is very common w/ this diagnosis, and that combined w/ family history is what made them consider it as a potential diagnosis.    How long will the shit they gave me be in my system by the way?   Topamax and Saphris both have 21-24 hour half lives, so I would say you will likely notice a big reduction in any fatigue or drowsiness tomorrow or Thur at the latest.    oh and I got 0 therapy throughout this lovely ordeal   Sadly, the state of health care and insurance companies makes this more and more common w/ psychiatric units in hospitals. These days, if someone is admitted to the psych unit of a hospital they will only be there until they are stabilized enough to be out of immediate crisis or harm. Typically insurance companies will authorize 2-3, maaaaybe 4, days before they will argue that someone does not meet medical necessity anymore and that staff need to get them discharged. This results in pretty severe limitations on any therapy that can be given. At best, most hospital social workers/therapists provide 2 or 3 sessions involving crisis management, coordinating discharge resources, and coming up w/ a safety plan. While psychiatrists receive training and experience in performing therapy, their main role in a hospital and in working w/ insurance companies is to assess and diagnose someone (or confirm the assessment and diagnosis done by a social worker/therapist) and prescribe and adjust medications.   That said, I'm sorry your experience was so negative and I hope it does not prevent you from continuing to seek help elsewhere. Therapists and psychiatrists working in an outpatient clinic will have more time to assess and re-assess what's going on and try different treatments. In the outpatient setting there is much more of a focus on what's called client-centered treatment, meaning you work with a therapist and psychiatrist to determine treatment goals and different ways you can make progress, as opposed to being told what to do or not getting a chance to give feedback. You also have much more of an opportunity to find treatment providers who you feel are a good match for your personality and needs."

Clearly those doctors were in a rush to quickly find you a label and rush you out. Remember that it's your right to seek a second opinion. Don't take their diagnosis at face value. They acted insensitively and listened poorly, you deserve better than that.  EDIT  BTW not that I'm saying this happened for you, but I know for me I have trouble identifying when I need sleep. I've been nearly delusional before simply from lack of sleep. It's horrifying to know that if I showed up in that state they'd try to give me drugs and a serious label instead of just recognizing basic signs of exhaustion. I'm no doctor, but consider that with all that stress perhaps what you needed most was just permission to decompress. Not trying to diagnose you, just giving you a reason not to take their label seriously."

My general health declined and my immune system was shot, and I would get vomiting sick and hospitalized for severe infections several times a year.

mentalhealth,3d6v26,ttgr888,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:43:45 2015 UTC,"Start with going to see your GP. They may be able to diagnose you (or refer you to a specialist if it is complex). They wil be able to prescribe medication such as antidepressants (they won't necessarily though, and you can discuss it if that's something you're not comfortable with). They should also be able to refer you to free counselling, usually either person centred counselling, or cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT).  Unfortunately, mental health services on the nhs are not always the best at the moment. I would definitely try your doctor first and then, if you want to look at private options, check out www.counselling-directory.org.uk or www.itsgoodtotalk.org.uk/therapists  Do a search for counsellors/therapists in your area, and you can narrow them down by what issues they deal with. Contact some and ask to meet them. It's a really good idea to meet a few to find one that really fits. Often, they will offer an initial meeting for free. Explain your circumstances (can do this over email). Many will have a sliding scale and will offer a much lower cost for people who are on a low income.  You don't mention parents or family - is there anyone you could talk to who could perhaps help out? If it's just a matter of embarrassment or not wanting to let them down, definitely talk to them about helping you out financially.  It may not come to that though, try your GP first and go from there. Once you get to college, they may well have a counselling service too."

I have Generalized Anxiety Disorder and sometimes in the past that has manifested as anger problems. I would let it out on a bag of rice because that was something I couldn't break and the sound didn't carry through the house (I think). I think what was happening to me was physical tension causing me an intense emotional response. or sometimes a vague emotion causing a physical reaction and expression.  mindfulness and eventually meditation (when i started feeling successful at that) has helped me sort of isolate my physical and emotional responses and break the feedback loop between the two"

mentalhealth,3d4aoa,agenderwizard,4,Mon Jul 13 12:15:53 2015 UTC,"I'm so sorry that you've had such an awful time, but well done on finding something to keep you going. You may think living for your pets sounds silly, but it really, really isn't. It's so good that you're trying to hang in there, and giving yourself a reason to carry on is just such a brave thing to do. As the previous poster said, it could be really useful for you to find someone to talk to. A therapist who you like and can relate to you, and preferably not somebody who is time limited (I.e. Not someone who will see you for one hour a week for six weeks for a specific intervention). It sounds like having a person to whom you can truly talk to and who will listen to you properly would be hugely beneficial.  Also I agree that volunteer work in somewhere like an animal shelter could be a brilliant idea. I say volunteer work so that if there is a day when you can't face it because of feeling so depressed or whatever reason you won't feel so bad as if you had a regular job, which might make you feel like you've ""failed"" (not that you would have failed at all, but I know that that's how my mind works if I miss something I am supposed to do!). And an art course, or even just a social art group, if there's anything similar around you would be fantastic too. Again, nothing too high pressure, just somewhere you can go and meet people with similar interests.  But above all, please try and find someone to talk to. A therapist, a good friend, someone who won't hurt you. I know how lonely the world can feel, and just this simple thing might make all the difference.  Well done again on hanging in there, and keep going. You're doing an amazing job, and you are worth it. People can suck, but you sound like you realise that the mean things people have said about you are not true, and you know you are a kind and loving person. Hold on to that fact and take care of yourself. X"
mentalhealth,3d4aoa,bethany717,3,Mon Jul 13 20:05:46 2015 UTC,"I don't want to say something like ""I know just how you feel"", but I do identify with things you're saying here. I hate knowing that my mental health prevents me from doing the things I want, and keeps me locked inside of my head. I also have social anxiety, and there are times when I can't stand talking to anyone and just get deeper inside of my head.  One thing that really helped me was seeing someone I could talk to, instead of just someone who would give me pills. I know it can be very difficult to find good mental health professionals, but there are non-profit organizations that keep lists of references. I'm not sure where you're located, but I know there has to be someone out there. I've also found some relief in writing down my thoughts and looking back at them later. It helps to get stuff out of your head. Maybe start with volunteering for an animal shelter. It would be a great way to do something you love without the pressure of a job. Or, since you love art, volunteering with a kids program to teach art. Doing things for others has been something that has really helped me through dark days. But most of all, please don't give up. Things can be real shit, but that doesn't mean that they'll always be like that. Find something small, even if that thing is ""today I put on socks"", and allow yourself to celebrate small milestones."
mentalhealth,3d5wq8,AlexHowe24,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:47:12 2015 UTC,"Hi, I'm sorry you have been feeling so rubbish. I'm guessing that you are in the UK as you mentioned year 6 and GPs, but please tell me if I'm wrong. I can't diagnose you or even begin to guess, but I can perhaps shed some light on what you might experience at the GP. I was 15 when I became ill (depression, anxiety, anorexia) and went to the GP. My situation was a little different as I didn't want to go to the doctor, my parents saw some self harm scars and dragged me along. The GP was not particularly helpful (he was a 50-odd year old bloke, shouldn't have expected much!) and actually said he couldn't do much anyway, and I was referred to the local children and adolescent mental health team (CAMHS). Hopefully you will have a better experience with the GP, but I would imagine that if he/she feels that it's a mental health issue rather than a physical one (I expect they'll do blood tests etc anyway) they will likely refer you to CAMHS. There you will get to repeat everything you've said already to the GP, but much more in depth. The appointments tend to be hour long rather than the 10 minute surgery appts. They may get you to do questionnaires etc and from there will be able to recommend a treatment plan, whether that's medication, therapy or further diagnostic appointments. I might be completely off base though, as I'm now 25 and things might well have changed! There's a chance your GP might prescribe anti depressants if he feels you have depression, but as you are only an adolescent I think they'd probably want another opinion. Do your parents/guardians know what's going on, and are they coming with you to the GP? If not, you need to be prepared for the likelihood of your doctor wanting to get them involved. In fact, if medication is required, I think they have to be informed. Even if they don't need to talk to them, you may want to consider talking to them yourself, for the simple reason that they are an extra support resource you can use. And, from experience, it's always better to tell them straight out what's happening, rather than them find out in an unexpected way! I hope that was of some use, although I'm not even sure it was coherent, and I'm on mobile so can't easily check! Best of luck, and I hope the GP manages to help. Let us know how it goes, yeah? Take care."

I don't know if this is a close friend, family member, etc., but if you keep trying to help them, or keep suggesting therapy,  or keep putting yourself out there as a resource, but they refuse to change, you're going to hurt yourself a good deal as well along the way.

mentalhealth,3d544v,Maeve1176,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:35:21 2015 UTC,"Just as there are many different kinds of mental illnesses, those who diagnose them are also different. From what they were taught in school to their own experiences, everyone learns differently. I've been labelled as having borderline personality, and am also fairly knowledgeable about psychology. Yet only one doctor diagnosed me as having BPD. I've been labelled with bipolar (due to anxiety & depression), schizophrenia (due to hearing voices T_T People need to understand that schizophrenia is not the only illness that has hallucinations!), depression with psychosis, generalized anxiety disorder, and most recently, major depression.   If it's not something you agree with, get another opinion.   Also, psychologists might give diagnoses but cannot prescribe medication, as I'm sure you know.  A psychiatrist is just a medical doctor that specializes in psychiatric medication. In my experience, they don't usually offer talk therapy. Psychologists offer talk therapy.  Also, no matter the diagnosis, some people benefit from different types of therapy. CBT, DBT, ACT, to name a few- they're used to treat different illnesses but the benefits can also apply to you.  You've been assessed, and told the results of that assessment, I'd probably consider that a diagnosis. Now you're being referred to therapy. Just being assessed (without a diagnosis) I wouldn't consider therapy by itself. Having a diagnosis labels you and helps professionals know how to generally treat your symptoms best.

Great that when you saw her yesterday she seemed normal (I hate the word but its good shorthand). It is important to  know that grieving comes in waves, sometimes people seem normal, then they are absorbed in grief, then normal again. So some or all of this may well be her grief (I wont say 'only' her grief as it is terribly painful and consuming) With her odd statements, there can be value in gently challenging them, or asking her to show you what she means/what her evidence is. If she gets annoyed/agitated dont push it, but really listen. Sometimes there is a small grain of truth in seemingly odd statements, and overall we all react best to being heard and treated gently when we are fragile. Assuming that this is her first such episode, or she has had things in the past and then moved on, the odds are good. But grieving takes time and if her tendency is to disconnect, she/you may need more professional help, now or in future All the best with it."
mentalhealth,3d269m,ktree921,3,Mon Jul 13 11:49:47 2015 UTC,"PS isn't the only disorder with delusions. Some people have delusions to make dealing with grief easier, even if they don't mean to do it. She may not even be aware that she's doing it, but if she's never had this behaviour before and is not a threat to anyone, there shouldn't be any need to send her back, I don't think. I'm not a professional. The ""not there"" thing can be the result of medication. Antipsychotics, if I recall, are also known as major tranquilizers. I don't think she's ""literally not there"" because her physical body is probably there, but mentally she's a bit ...subdued? ...chemically calmed? Give her time to process the news, and support her as best you can."

mentalhealth,3d269m,henrebotha,2,Mon Jul 13 21:08:28 2015 UTC,"As someone else said, talk to her GP first off and ask about a mental health provider, you could probably have her GP get her medical records from the psyche ward as well and see what the GP thinks about that and where to go from there.  (Without me going into details, which I don't want to do, here is what I feel you should do based on my own experience.) I feel as though the best thing YOU can do for her, besides help her get professional help, is to be there for her. Like, physically be there. Even if she says she wants to be alone, just go chill in a different room or something. Obviously you can't act like nothing is wrong, because her mother died, but try not to treat her like a child or a patient. She needs someone she can trust, depend on and open up to. I feel like (again, this is just based on my own experience, I am NOT a professional) the worst thing for her right now is to feel abandoned or (and I am sorry, I can't think of the word for this) like her thoughts and feelings aren't important or relevant.  The professionals are there to figure out what's wrong, what is grief and what may be psychosis or what have you, YOUR job is to be her friend, confidante and advocate. I know how hard that is, and I hope I am not being contradictory or confusing. I wish you both the best of luck."

At the point you're questioning whether suicide is objectively a ""good idea"" is a red flag.  Talking about your feelings is important, and a lifeline can be critical in the lowest of lows. Because the time you feel the worst is where the scale starts tipping, and it's harder to analyze if you're doing so on your own.  Counselors are a good tool that most universities and high schools provide, but even trusted friends and family can be great people to just talk over your feelings with.

Right now I'm in a good place with what I take but I know from past experience it's only a matter of time before I'll be going through it again.  Don't give up. The answers out there.

What I recommend you do (and I hope you take my advice) is to talk to your psychiatrist and get different medication. If the medicine isn't working, you need to have a dialogue with your psychiatrist. Ask him/her about psychotherapy in conjunction with the medicine. It's all about being active in the process.  I hope you're okay."

You try not to drink so much for this reason don't you?   Are you going to start your meds back up? Also, this sort of thing happens often to me. I have a history of such fuck ups. Embarrassment, remorsefulness is optional you can still recover from this and take with you some knowledge out of the incident without beating yourself silly. I mean it's not going to do you any good to stay hung up about it. It wont help if your SO is too upset to help about it either. You planning on drinking again soon?"

Just sounds like a lot of pain and sadness that's trying to work itself out.  For me the only long term treatment that has worked is actually allowing it the space to do that.  Stability is important for family and social interactions but working with a therapist that can allow you to fully let out all the painful and confusing feelings is the only way I know of becoming mostly drug free.  I hope you're able to explore that at some point in the future.  Good luck to you."

I've been on Zoloft for almost 4 months now... and the past 2 months or so I have been waking up after sweating a lot. Always just on my legs. I had no idea what could have been causing it, but from your post I'm starting to think it might be the medication. Strange that it only started happening recently.  I was on clonazepam 0.25mg x3 a day for a month. I went off it no problem. Not sure how similar withdrawal between these meds is, but how you were taking your xanax makes me think withdrawal shouldn't be too big of an issue. Not sure what to tell you, but take a deep breath and relax. Assuming it is withdrawal, it will pass! If it's just because of your anxiousness with the zoloft and such (which I think is more likely), try to calm down (haha, easy to say ;)). I'd also recommend speaking to your doctor, as taking medication in ways that it wasn't prescribed or not taking it 'correctly' can have some serious side-effects.   Just take a break. Try to step away from the situation and give it a bit of time. I'm sorry you're feeling so anxious right ow. Beating yourself up about it however is just making it worse. Do what you gotta do to feel better okay?   Hope this helps!"
mentalhealth,3d1pur,1864752987,1 point,Sun Jul 12 21:08:14 2015 UTC,"My quandary is that if Im just having normal anxiety my past experience is that taking xanax helps me get back to normal functional state much quicker than otherwise. But what if the anxiety is FROM some slight xanax withdrawal itself? I feel like its a catch 22.  Honestly, I don't think the source matters.  Whether it's psychosomatic or physiological, if the small doses help then use them.  Use them to STOP taking it if that's your goal.  It sounds like you know the dangers of the addiction, so probably know the concept of weaning off of a substance vs cutting it off suddenly.  Any medication like these can be very bad if it's stopped suddenly.  Set a schedule for stopping it and stick with it.  If you need to take half a Xanax to help you sleep for a week then take it.  Worrying about using the medication may well be making the whole thing worse, as you point out.    Just remember that you're using it to minimize the withdrawal symptoms."

The true nature of the lack of empathy is trauma and dissociation, usually relating to big levels of anger that are too uncomfortable to admit to.  If I were you, focus on the lack of empathy and see what is really inside is that feeling. It may take some time and meditative type practice to dig in, but it sounds hopeful so far, and there are many more methodologies to try along the way. Also, resistance is normal and likely due to progress, so try and hang with it for a while if you can."

mentalhealth,3cynt3,nuclearqtip,3,Sun Jul 12 03:43:28 2015 UTC,"most people that have it will never admit it because they believe there is nothing wrong with them   This is a problem with most personality disorders. Unless you have some of the more painfully obvious ones (BPD, OCD, Antisocial) most sufferers just assume it's a personal issue to deal with in private.   I now humbly turn to the internet   Hey seriously good for you for wanting to get help. Personally I have AvPD + SPD, so I can't offer you too much advice that's directly related to NPD.  I can say, generically, that a lot of my personal problems come down to... how to put this... stories I tell myself. Narratives about myself, narratives about others, and narratives about how it all fits together. Who I am, who they are, what I like, what they like, what I can tolerate, what they can tolerate, what hurts me, what hurts them, etc.  One of the healthier things I've been working on is letting go of all those stories. Recognizing ALL of it as internal projections I've overlaid on the world, instead of just trying to take in the world as it really exists. Turning off the thinking mind, and activating the observing mind, in other words.   my lack of empathy and general emotions has made it quite difficult for me to maintain and even make friends and other relationships   Empathy and emotional awareness are pretty tightly related. They both require the ability to observe and accept emotions in the self and others. This is in contrast to the thinking mind which rejects emotions that don't fit the narrative.   I feel very isolated from most of society   I feel you. People don't put forth a lot of effort to understand personality disorders, unfortunately. It's very sad.   I'm a Narcissistic pig and I need help not being one.   Well surely there's some middle ground between feeling important, loved and admired and being a pig.  Having NPD doesn't make you inhuman. Though I'm sure the isolation makes it feel like that. Be strong, keep up the therapy, keep talking. Find some other folks with NPD, talk with them too. You're not as alone as you think."
mentalhealth,3cynt3,nuclearqtip,1 point,Sun Jul 12 07:48:44 2015 UTC,"Thank you, i've been doing a lot of research on personality disorders and what you say is very true. One, i have a severely over-analytical and logical brain and therefore i rationalize every response, action and reaction i do, including the way something makes me ""feel"" in a sense even though for the most part i only feel frustration. Two, it's an odd coincidence that you have SPD (im assuming Schizoid personality disorder? Or perhaps Schizotypal) and AvD because thats what the doctors thought i had at first because i exhibit many of the qualities of AvD, SPD and NPD but they narrowed it down to NPD and think that the other symptoms (i say for lack of a better term) are a by-product of the NPD. (how many times can i say NPD in one sentence) and it is really a shame that most people don't see or care to see that personality disorders can be socially crippling :/ I, however, have an insatiable appetite for learning about these sorts of things so if you want to tell me more about your ""disorders"" (sounds so negative to say it like that) I would love to hear about what you go through!"
mentalhealth,3cynt3,nuclearqtip,3,Sun Jul 12 18:35:16 2015 UTC,"if you want to tell me more about your ""disorders""   Yeah avoidant + schizoid. I kinda bounce between being hypersensitive and panicky and then a switch flips and I shut it all down and feel nothing at all. It's lovely. It manifests as depression, social anxiety, agoraphobia, insomnia, mild paranoia, and hypochondria.  I'm remarkably sensitive towards others, their emotions, their intentions towards me. But others can't read me at all. I have difficulty showing certain emotions (sexuality, anger, exuberance -- anything lively really). I don't allow myself to be angry until I'm basically being bullied ruthlessly, and then I explode in a fit of fury and freak the other person out.  I want relationships but when I'm in them I constantly suspect the other person of not really liking me. I want physical closeness but when I get it I literally have a panic attack. There's a joke that goes, ""how do porcupines make love? Very carefully"". That's my life, basically.  I've been on multiple medications, been to therapy a few times. I'm currently not getting any help. I moved to a really big city and I'm having a harder and harder time leaving my apartment. Agoraphobia is kicking my ass right now. I'm thinking about therapy again. In the meanwhile I'm focused on meditation and mindfulness to maybe get me out of this rut. It's helping, but I've been out of practice for a while."
mentalhealth,3cynt3,nuclearqtip,2,Sun Jul 12 20:51:13 2015 UTC,"I'm very similar with emotions, a few years ago when i went to therapy for what i thought was depression, my doctor thought i was bi-polar so i got put on medication for that and it completely destroyed a lot of my self-esteem. I have difficulty not only feeling but when i do feel emotions, showing them. My best example is christmas. When i was a child i would get presents from relatives that were really awesome and i'd love them but i wouldn't jump up and down (and i'm talking like really young here, 3-7 range) and go crazy for them and i'd basically give a forced thank you because my brain would tell me that was the right thing to do. Or in my last relationship, on a more recent note i had to look my ex in the eye and tell her i was not sure if i loved her because i really don't know what that feels like. I also suffer insomnia but no paranoia really and definitely no hypochondria. I'm extremely sensitive towards criticism, often jumping to the conclusion that everything is my fault and i'm a total failure, then immediately jumping to ""wait a second, screw these guys, there's no way i'm wrong."" a lot of people would think that being a narcissist i'd be promiscuous and in a way i am, in terms of getting around, not a lot, but a significant amount more than is healthy (I'm still clean though!!!) but at the same time i dont really care for sex and don't have much of a drive unless it's in the moment. It's usually the furthest thing from my mind and even sometimes when it may be the ""right time"" i either lose interest or never had it in the first place and just don't ""sugar the cookie"" if you will.

Wow, yup same deal here. I appreciate what you're saying SO much. I remember feeling a LOT of resentment growing up towards, well, everyone. After all, if I don't feel the spontaneous gratitude, why should I be forced to perform as if I did? It felt dishonest. I just went with that for a while, and that's when the ""S"" label started getting thrown around.   Or in my last relationship, on a more recent note i had to look my ex in the eye and tell her i was not sure if i loved her because i really don't know what that feels like.   Jesus. Me too. Minus the ""in the eyes"" part. I did it over the phone. Fuck me, that sucked. I'm really sorry, I actually know how that feels. Sucks ass. Feels like you're not quite human when you admit that.   I also suffer insomnia but no paranoia really and definitely no hypochondria.   Man we're pretty similar :/ The hypochondria is a bit more under control now, but for a while there every other week it was a cancer scare or some parasite or vitamin deficiency, etc. I had a few friends give me shit for it, kinda riled me up. Hypochondria in particular is a very schizoid feature. It's what happens when we don't, erm, realize we're having an emotion. We look for a mechanical explanation.   I'm extremely sensitive towards criticism, often jumping to the conclusion that everything is my fault and i'm a total failure, then immediately jumping to ""wait a second, screw these guys, there's no way i'm wrong.""   Fascinating. I do the same, minus the last part. Maybe that's the NPD? Is that the line?   a lot of people would think that being a narcissist i'd be promiscuous   I think BPD (borderline) is the one people usually associate with promiscuity. But yes I suppose if you've never had much exposure, narcissism might seem like a good fit.   even sometimes when it may be the ""right time"" i either lose interest or never had it in the first place and just don't ""sugar the cookie"" if you will   Lol. Oh god. So many times. I'm with you. I swear to god I've had the thought, ""why should I always initiate, why don't you make an effort, how about that?"". Around people I just met, mind you.   Also, idk if this applies to you, but i'm really bad at social cues, appropriate language, behavior and discussion.   That sucks. Yes unfortunately I'm in that boat as well. I laugh inappropriately at very serious things. And since others can't really read me too well, I've given up trying to use sarcasm in my day to day speech. Too many misunderstandings. Also, I've had a few people tell me recently that when I speak I tend to just ""fill the silence"" (not really saying anything meaningful). I know what they're referring to, I actually have panic attacks mid-sentence and my brain goes on auto-pilot while I dissociate from my body. I'm not really even listening to myself at that point, but apparently it becomes rather tedious for the listener.  What do you mean about appropriate language? Like profanity? Right wording? What kinds of social cues do you mess up?"
mentalhealth,3cynt3,senmyad,1 point,Sun Jul 12 23:23:43 2015 UTC,"Yea a lot of profanity, I'm actually really good with words, in terms of language, like writing a paper is no problem for me but in social situations i use a lot of C-words and such, and talk about things that offend people. I'm most famous among my few friends for saying ""uh actually i'm pro-abortion, i think everyone should have an abortion"" as a joke in a VERY inappropriate time and setting. As for social cues, I'm very on track-minded in terms of conversation. For example, I'm a musician/songwriter and I can talk about music for literally days on end. I can never tell when someone is bored with what I'm saying or genuinely interested either. I don't really care because I love to talk about it but I've learned from other people that i tend to drone. Also i have terrible indications as to whether or not someone is into me. I genuinely never know. Someone could be hitting on me and I would have no idea. Another thing I'm bad at is socially reacting to someone's sadness or anger. I have no idea what to do in those situations. I cant say that i have any panic attacks but i know the auto-pilot feeling, like you have no control over what you're saying and you literally dont even think before you say something and low and behold 30 minutes have gone by and youre still repeating the same sentence in every possible combination of words! And yes the idea of love makes me feel very inhuman, like to the point where i question whether or not i love my own family.

Like I said, I pick up EASILY on signs of rejection. But basically unless you either invite me to an event or ask me out on a date, I'd NEVER know you like me.  When I was younger (20-ish, still in college) I had my first real girlfriend. We were making out and I stopped, looked her in the eyes, and said, ""so... you like me right?"" She busted up laughing until she realized I was being serious. Later on we were about to have our first sexual encounter and I asked, ""so... you're actually attracted to me?"" She said ""yes"" and I said ""weird"". She got up and left at that point. Super awkward.   Another thing I'm bad at is socially reacting to someone's sadness or anger.

This is weird. I mean I literally JUST learned that about myself a few weeks ago. Horrible awful vacation, my only friend just randomly threw that one in my face. Said I've done it for years. I had no idea. Seriously weird hearing another person talk about this. I've googled my ass off looking for this symptom, and I haven't turned up anything. How odd. Does this have a name? Do you do this a lot?   yes the idea of love makes me feel very inhuman, like to the point where i question whether or not i love my own family   That is scary. I don't relate to questioning my love for my family, but I have questioned their love for me. Until I found some old home movies, and found undisputable proof that they loved the crap out of me. Made me cry when I realized I questioned them at all. That must be extra scary in the other direction. Maybe you can find some evidence of your own that contradicts your current feelings? Dunno, worth a shot.   the main one being that i dont know how to feel that feeling   Yeah I've felt that sometimes. It must be pretty hard wondering if you can feel that way. Wish I had a good answer for you other that what I was saying about the narratives.  Personally, it's the opposite direction for me. I seriously question if anyone can love me. It seems impossible, like a mistake. That's the narrative I'm working to overcome. Because it happens ALL THE TIME and I'm too focused on fitting people into my narrative to actually let reality in."
mentalhealth,3cxiru,Valiumth,8,Sat Jul 11 17:41:32 2015 UTC,"I can relate to this. Whenever I have acute psychosis, most docs don't believe me when I tell them I don't do drugs. They think I'm lying. And I end up in the hospital and they give me jack shit for help, because they think once the drugs wear off I'll be fine. But what really happens is I never get better, cause there were no drugs in my system in the first place. A week later I'm still there, still crazy as fuck and it's obvious they thought I was lying and didn't take me seriously. It happens every time. I have no fucking idea why they'd do this either, as antipsychotics will not make you high, they will not make you feel good, they are generally shitty drugs to be on. But I need them, and it's infuriating when I don't get them because the psych at whatever ER or ward I happen to be at has a pet theory that I'm actually psychotic because I was doing street drugs. You'd think I'd have a long enough history and records that they could look at but no, they keep doing it. It pisses me off to no end.  I understand docs often have people lying to them to get drugs, but for an antipsychotic, really? Nobody does that. And I'm schizoaffective, not retarded. I know what meds will help me with this. They should too, but they still pull this shit. I really don't understand it.  If you can cope with your symptoms fine without meds, then go for it, ditch them. If you actually need help, I encourage you to keep looking. While shitty psychs suck and are numerous, a good doc is a godsend.

A doctor may not necessarily suspect self harm when you come in for treatment, and if you disclose, it is still pretty unlikely that they're going to commit you. I don't know how the mental health system is where you are, but at least where I live, you have to be a major and immediate danger to yourself or others to be put in against your will. Like, seriously seriously seriously bad.  That's not to minimize your experience at all; it does sound like you've sustained a pretty good head injury there, and I think you're being really smart and brave getting it checked out. Whether it's the impact itself or the anxiety/depression, it's still good to go, and to be as honest with your doctor as you can.  It seems most probable (though I am not a doctor) that your doc will ask you about your symptoms and circumstances. They might refer you to get a brain scan of some sort, to check about any potential damage from the hit. And they might refer you to a psychologist and/or a psychiatrist to help with the depression/anxiety stuff. Or they may be able to do some medicine from their office, depending on the practice.  At any rate, I wouldn't at all worry about being made to go to the hospital against your will. It doesn't sound like you're a severe, immediate danger to yourself or anyone else. Your doc will probably be friendly, gentle, and helpful in figuring out what to do... and maybe that will mean taking it easy for a bit. Or if you whacked your jaw out of place or something, you might get a referral to a doc who can look at the nerves in your face.  I would definitely recommend going, though. You'll be doing a very good thing for yourself."

Only you know your body and if you think you have concussion get to your doctors :)  like I said don't take this as gospel, but do certainly look after yourself"
mentalhealth,3cvpsb,Charmanderpaul,-5,Sat Jul 11 15:19:27 2015 UTC,"It's highly unlikely that you would get carted off to hospital. They usually don't unless you are deeply suicidal or a danger to others. It does also depend on where you are in the world. Some GPs are a bit trigger happy, especially if you have to pay them loads of money. Honestly is usually the best policy, but if you are still worried, try this.   Tell the doctor that you fell and smacked your face on the floor/wall/whatever. Explain you've been feeling tired and work has stressed you out and that lack of concentration caused you to trip.   Explain the physical symptoms to the doctor and ask for blood tests to rule out anything that might actually be causing you to feel like this. There may be a physical reason for the sadness, anger and anxiety.   If all comes back clear, or there's no physical cause for symptoms, ask about stress management courses or ways to deal with the sadness. Many of these courses focus on healthy coping strategies and ways to reduce self harm. You could also ask for a low dose of antidepressants if you think they might support you in addressing your issues, alongside a skills management course."

mentalhealth,3crsxk,TheStickyNoteBandit,8,Fri Jul 10 06:45:23 2015 UTC,"I am absolutely no expert on this, but I've done a lot of reading/writing for my degree on this topic.  Childhood sexual abuse is associated with significant detrimental psychological effects on the individual, not just in childhood, but throughout life. These include clinical depression, anxiety, low self esteem, personality disorders (especially borderline personality disorder), eating disorders, self harm, sexual dysfunction, substance abuse and suicide.  First, if the experience is traumatic, it's going to have a significant effect on the developing brain. There are lots of different kinds of abuse but it often involves physical trauma (pain of the act itself, physical coercion, associated physical abuse such as beatings) or psychological trauma (verbal abuse, victim blaming during the abuse itself, shame, not being believed or being blamed by outside parties etc). Trauma and adverse events during childhood are thought to have a neurological effect on the brain, changing the structure of the brain. These changes may lead the person to be less able to cope with negative or distressing events in the future. It's not just that the person feels sad, angry or whatever, their brain literally functions differently than it would have if the abuse hadn't happened. Some abuse survivors have PTSD, and may suffer flashbacks of it. Some, as a result of feeling helpless and unable to control the abuse, develop something called dissociation, where they mentally ""check out"" of situations. If severe, it can manifest as dissociative identity disorder.  Inevitably, a lot will turn to unhealthy coping mechanisms to deal with negative emotions, whether cutting themselves, or binge drinking, or binge eating etc.  Even if the abuse at the time is not experienced as a traumatic event by the individual, it can still have long lasting negative effects. Shame is a massive component of surviving abuse. Shame can come from the perpetrator perhaps telling the victim that they deserved it, or they wanted it, or it's their fault. It can come from other people not believing them or misinterpreting events to blame the victim. It can come from inside the individual themselves as they struggle to understand what has happened to them and know only that they are ""dirty"" or ""bad"" for what has happened. Sometimes, a victim, even if they are young, may feel pleasurable physical sensations during abuse; if they are older and have more developed sexual feelings, then they may on some level want the action that has occurred. The abuse may happen in the context of an otherwise loving relationship, it may be a way of gaining attention from the abuser, there may be payment or gifts involved, the victim may ""enjoy"" aspects of the abuse because it's the only time they feel loved etc. As they grow older and try to contextualise what has happened to them, they may feel a deep sense of shame because there were some positive aspects to the abuse, and they may feel like they asked for it or weren't really victimised.  In your example of a 10 year old raped by her father, there is the added complication of her relationship to the perpetrator and what it should be. He's her father. He's supposed to love and protect her, but he has become the one who is hurting her. It's very likely that a child will have at least some feelings of love for a father, and while he/she may not want what is happening, they also may not want the father to be punished or that relationship taken away. If he is taken away or punished (even if just through divorce) then she will possibly feel guilt and more shame. There is a whole mess of confusing feelings there. She might find it hard to ever trust men again, or adults in general. She might find it hard to develop loving relationships that aren't defined by sex, or to trust that men want anything other than to take advantage. A young child may feel that it's normal to make someone else perform sexual acts, or to be made to. They may act out the abuse on other children, or may grow up feeling that it's ok for their partner to do whatever they want to them, as long as they love them etc.  There's also the sexual aspect. For one thing, I'm not sure that you can say that all 10 year olds ""do not understand sex"". They have some concept of it. Regardless, as they grow older they will have more and more understanding of sex, and that understanding will be forever shaped by those early experiences. That child will never be able to learn about what sex is and should be, and then learn about abuse in its proper context. Their understanding of sex is completely interweaved with abuse, with the unwanted, unasked for advances of someone else who has forced their needs onto that child. For many people, the idea of sex will be forever tinged with feeling dirty or ashamed. If physical pleasure was involved, then they may be afraid to feel sexual pleasure again. Memory plays a big part, and they may find themselves reminded of their (possibly incestuous) abuser every time they had sex.  Children who are abused are often taught to lie about what's happened to them. They may have to keep huge secrets from their parents, other family members, friends. As they grow older, unless it all comes out somehow, they keep lying by omission. It comes back to shame. If the abuse was incest, they may feel that no one will ever understand, or that people will be disgusted to hear about it. Or if the victim feels like they brought it on themselves (maybe literally asked for it - some abusers will make it so that the victim feels responsible) or they enjoyed it in any way, then they may not feel like they have the right to call it abuse. Say for example a 12 year old boy who is abused by an adult man or woman, who is interested in sex and physically aroused - that boy may feel extreme shame and disgust about his feelings, even though he has very definitely been abused. Adolescents and young adults can have very confusing thoughts about their sexuality and sexual orientation. A boy who is straight, may be confused because he was abused by a man and was physically aroused during it. A woman who is bisexual may end up living basically as a lesbian because although she finds men attractive, she can't escape the memories of abuse by a man and can't trust men. Some people are drawn to bdsm, but feel guilty about it. (Not at all saying that all people who are into bdsm were abused, but for some people, there is that link between pleasure and control etc.)  Sorry for the wall of text, but it's such a huge area. There's lots of research on this, but see for example Fergusson et al. (1996); Mullen et al. (1996); Anda et al. (2006; stuff on neurological changes). See also here for a more general overview."

After I got out I actually shouted ""yes"" at him because he didn't believe I was panicking right there in the chair in front of him. He upped the ativan right then.  My other doctor pulled me off the desipramine because she found heart damage. I never did get anything useful.   He was a low-rent psychiatrist. After he kept lengthening the apts from the first or second one each week to 5 weeks for his vacation with no one else to see, I lost it and never went back.

It is unlikely that the police will be at all equipped to handle her and it has a high likelihood of exacerbating her current state of mind. Call an ambulance instead - do not dial an emergency number. Dial a direct number for the hospital. If you dial the emergency number they will send police. Explain to the hospital that your friend is in the middle of a psychotic / paranoid episode.  That is honestly your only immediate choice. What the hospital will do is get her sedated and look for her history of care and diagnosis. If you don't know the details that's fine, try to get in touch with someone who might. On the interim the hospital will try to put her on something that will knock her out for a little while and help her come to her senses enough to be coherent.  Use that time to get some sleep at home. Go back the next day.  It's a tough as tits position to be in. I empathise with you. But there's very little else you can do. Yes, your friend may wind up in an in-patient program, maybe even involuntarily for a period of time, but weighing that against the risks to themselves? I know what I'd do.  Good luck either way.  P.S. To be clear, your friend is suffering from a psychotic episode. Psychosis is described as breaking from reality. Seeing things that are not there, hearing things that are not there, or losing touch with what is real vs unreal (i.e. the delusion that your family is plotting to kill you). Paranoia is a common bedfellow when it comes to psychosis, and usually psychosis has a delusional theme. These are all symptoms that are most reminiscent of Schizophrenia or Schizo-affective Disorder. Without medication and monitoring by medical professionals your friend is not safe. You cannot manage your friend on your own."

I did what you said, and long story short the county sent 2 people to our home to assess whether or not she's suicidal or homicidal.  They said that's the only criteria under which they can hospitalize her.  When they came she somehow turned completely normal and convinced them there was nothing wrong.  They said there's nothing they can do.  They said even though they believe everything I said, they still can't take her in because even if they did she ""presents so well"" the doctor would just let her go.  After they left she seemed a bit calmer and more relaxed.  Later that night I got her some food, and after she ate it I found out it was the first time she'd eaten in almost three weeks.  Also found out she hadnt slept for more than a few minutes at a time in about three weeks.  After eating, her body reacted quite negatively and she fainted, but then she went to sleep, and only woke up twice through the night, and seemed to be slowly getting better.  Then early this morning she got the idea in her head that she's HIV positive, which is ridiculous, and spent all day crying about that.  I told her I'll take you to the hospital right now to get tested if you like, she said no bring a doctor to my house.  I said I don't think I can do that, she said ""figure it out.""  Then she came up with this theory that her last boyfriend was paid by her cousins, the ones plotting to kill her, to give her HIV.  Then around the evening time, her lack of eating and sleeping for three weeks finally caught up to her, she felt she was losing consciousness and turned pale and was sweating quite a bit.  I called 911, an ambulance came.  In the emergency room I explained to the doctor as much as I could, but he seemed rather busy and in a hurry, but he was quite understanding and thought what I said makes sense given her behavior.  He said he's gonna get a psychiatrist.  I'm currently outside the emergency room drinking a diet coke, smoking a cigarette and typing this.  I hope all turns out well for her, this has been a freightening ordeal for me.  I hope she gets the proper help because god knows I'm not equipped to deal with this.

Why not look up a recommended psychologist in your area and call them? They should know how to deal with it and maybe they can speak to her on the phone and encourage her to meet them. Good luck

mentalhealth,3co1lh,velvethadron,1 point,Thu Jul 9 12:02:21 2015 UTC,"hi velvethadron,  i think what is causing so much of your anxiety is the fact that you believe everything you think. (I am not english native so I hope you understand the way I write) When I first was confronted with the saying that not everything I think represents reality I wanted to send the person to hell, because I thought it was an insult. I felt like she was not taking me and my feelings serious. But then I investigated on that ""theory"" so to say. And I came across this american writer Byron Katie. Actually she is not the first one saying that thoughts are random but it doesn`t matter. She established a technique to question your thoughts and I can tell your from my own experience that it works. I have instantly felt better about my relationship to other people and to myself and I also use here technique because I am a coach. However everything you need for it is free - you don't need money to use the technique. check out www.thework.com you can download free worksheets there. I also listen to her podcasts. I really hope this helps you. Another writer which you might consider is Eckardt Tolle who also talks about the ""thoughts"" and their randomness. And by the way: About becoming a psychologist: you are not alone with your fears, I have met a lot of people and I have met a lot of people treating others. The trick is to work on it and being conscious about fear, thoughts and behaviour.  If someone tells you: A psychologist should have all ducks in a row - so to say - You can always ask for an example of who came to in a state of ""enlightenment"" to the world. I give you a hint: NO ONE DOES. Keep on following your dreams."
mentalhealth,3cn7zn,alt_acount_for_bro,4,Thu Jul 9 05:31:33 2015 UTC,"Do you know what medications your brother was taking regularly? I can't speak for the doc's competency, but after overdosing, he is at risk for seizures, withdrawal, and other complications. Based on the info here, I don't think lithium and seroquel would be unreasonable meds for him based on his history. Lithium is considered to be the gold standard for mood stabliization and Seroquel is an antipsychotic. Both should help with some of his symptoms.   Both of these drugs can definitely make a person feel ""doped up"" and sleepy. The goal of these types of drugs are to decrease the symptoms a person may feel which caused them to be in a crisis scenario in the first place. Unfortunately, they also have a lot of side effects. Medications in this case (and always) always must be viewed in a benefit versus risk perspective. In this scenario, the docs are figuring that yes, he may be sleepy and not thinking clearly, but those symptoms are preferable to him feeling suicidal.   The blood tests are standard practice for someone beginning on Lithium. The tests determine if lithium is at a therapeutic/helpful level in his system. Lithium has a relatively narrow therapeutic range, which just means they have to tweak the lithium dose just right and they may have to play with it a little. Don't be too alarmed by the blood tests.   Most importantly, I'd encourage you to insist on a family conference between your brother, your family, and the docs. Like I said, I can't verify the doc's competency, so it is possible that these drugs are not right for your brother and he would be better suited with something else. What's important is that you and your family are involved in your brother's care and are educated on what he is taking and why exactly he is taking it. In my experience, hospital inpatient psych units are not the best place for people to get long term counseling. Their goal is to stabilize the person so that he is able to function safely outside of the hospital and be free of suicidal thoughts and urges. Once that happens, he should definitely seek out a therapist who can help with the childhood trauma. Best of luck to you.  Source: I'm a (new) nurse"

It can be frustrating working with the medical establishment because of the disconnect between the doctors actions and what you see and know about this person.  Try and have your parents setup a meeting with your brother, the doctor, and your family, where you can bring up your concerns that his medications may be too high and that you're concerne for your brothers well being. It's easy to become combative with the doctors, but try t keep your cool and focus on what is best for your brother, and why the doctor feels he needs the meds at such doses.  Having family hospitalized and medicated is hard because in my experience, there isn't much you can do other than be there for them.  My heart goes out to you."

In no way am I condoning that behaviour and I don't think you should do that.   I got many different diagnoses over the years, dysthymia, unipolar depression, major depressive disorder, generalised anxiety disorder... chances are a lot of doctors are gonna think differently.

Nothing helps better than for you to not leave yourself alone because that's giving yourself room in your brain for sad thoughts that can lead to suicidal thoughts.  Your mom, you friend or your boyfriend it can be anybody who you feel close to. Just call them and ask if you can see them and talk to them. It also helps for you to talk to them while you're having your panic attacks. Tell them to talk to you not about your state of mind but happy things while your feeling anxious. I call it my happy place when I get my attacks.   Also, pets help a lot. They're meant to be therapudic. Reading or doing puzzles until you're dead tired helps too but nothing helps better than having somebody you can talk to. If you feel like you don't have anybody, Reddit is a great place for help too. I go on /r/depression a lot and it helps me by looking at other people's threads or talking to people myself.

You might have some luck in calling your state or county department of health and human services; they often have a list of providers in the area who can help people with few financial means.  Also, you might try goodrx.com. I just found out about it recently and it looks like it's gonna reduce the cost of my meds by 90%. It may be different for different people, and it doesn't do anything for the office visits, but that might at least free up some funds to put toward them.  Are his symptoms any better, or are they still pretty severe? It sounds like it might well be worth going to readycare or even the ER. You should probably call around first and see what you can find out, but withdrawals can be really brutal, and besides unpleasant, they can be dangerous. A doctor's visit will be expensive but it's a good idea to go in if you can, and see if they can at least alleviate the shakes/vomiting and set him up with some temporary medicine or a referral."

Yes, there are places that are not condusive to rehabilitation and where people are not treated with dignity or respect.  However, this does not apply to every health facility and actually these places can provide a lot of support and a safe environment for the person to stabalize in.  A lot of places have come a long way from the 'one flew over the cuckoos nest' days. I have used these facilities before and they hav helped immensly, not only for me but also my loved ones who can get some space to re-evaluate things and get advice. I don't know why your sister has done this, people have many reasons, but I have been in her place before and it sucks. you say that prevention is on her, but in my experience when you feel that bad making logical decisions regardless of how they may impact other people is not top of the list. I hope you all find ways to cope.  Has she attended any kind of therapy outside of the crisis facility?  Maybe one or two family sessions could help?

But it might be worth trying to get close to her -- specially if you want to understand what is going on in her mind.

There is a 4 year difference between us so we've never been super close but we are definitely still close. Trust is very hard because after the first attempt we found out she'd been sneaking out, talking to people on various apps, and going behind our backs.

We are only 100% conscious when we stop for a moment and aware  of it - ""ok, this is me and this is what I feel and think, this is where I stand/sit and this is what I'm doing.""  Most human's bodies are not in their control but is being controlled by their emotions and instinct.  You are controlled by these emotions and instincts as well BUT you are aware of them.   Now this is all my own opinion so I don't expect you to agree. Your mind seems to be in a state of perception that can help you learn about how to see how life truly works vs. the illusion of life humans have created, and attain these abilities quickly.    Sometimes it seems as if everyone I talk to is a cliche or a stereotype. Last year, I remember walking through the hallways of school and looking everybody and mocking them and picking them apart and putting them down in my head.    To me it seems you've learned something here. Life sucks. It's our shitty gift we've been given. And nobody is willing to admit it. We all walk around like everything is all good and always respond with ""good"" when asked ""how are you doing?"" (yet another unconscious response we say) So we as humans have 3 options in life: 1) Keep trudging on pretending life is ok when really life in the end is death, sickness, pain. 2) Realize life sucks so instead of being brought down into the depths of its hell. Live above all it all and the fakers and find your real community. 3) Since most people are perfectly pretending everything is ok it's hard to admit the third option. Offing your Self.   I also feel in order for life to go on the game has to be worth it. If you know your going to lose in the end then what is the point of playing? It seems you have the best game of all to play! If it weren't for your enemy you wouldn't know who you were because that opposition brings out your character. If it weren't for all the wrong in the world you wouldn't know what was right. Therefore I feel you can quickly learn how to (like in war) mentally combat, avoid, and become victorious over the shitty opposition in life so you can start to nurture and love the ones you feel most connected with."

I have a few questions as I see fit in my own mind because they seem to fit your case as well. 1) What was your childhood like? 2) How is your relationship to your parents? 3) Have you experimented with any other drugs? 4) Do you ever get abusive towards animals?"
mentalhealth,3cierv,dolla-llamma,1 point,Wed Jul 8 06:08:46 2015 UTC,"1) What was your childhood like?   Well, it was strange I suppose. It feels rather surreal to think about, almost like a dream. I remember in preschool I played with the girls and played house (I was the dad), and I remember all the guys making fun of me and that made me stop playing house.   There was also a time when me and my younger sister shared a bed for a while. We were renovating and her room was getting expanded. I remember asking her to scratch my back and my stomach, and I sometimes I would ask her to scratch my waistband because it felt really ticklish. I never took it any farther because it felt like I shouldn't be doing that.   My older brother was always rather controlling and would make me do things for him (go get him a snack, etc.). This always annoyed me but eventually I would always do it for him. One time me and my older brother were playing in the back yard, and he did something that made me extremely angry. I decided to stand him to him, and it got physical. Since he was a lot larger than me, I grabbed a plastic pipe that was near me and I started swinging at him with it. I was really beating him up, when he somehow got the pipe and then beat the shit out of me.   Once I reached puberty and started going after girls, I quickly exploited my ability to sweet talk them. At that age, just drowning them in compliments would get them to like you, and pretty soon they would make out with you (a huge deal at that age).   After awhile, I started to imagine what it would be like if someone told me a bunch of lovey-dubby shit and it was all made-up. I ended up feeling like such a piece of shit that I lost all interest in girls (up until a few months ago).   That was really long winded but I feel like it told me a lot about myself, I'd never really thought about it before. Usually when I remember anything from over 3 years ago I get incredibly sad.    2) How is your relationship to your parents?   I think it is good. Me and my mom can talk about a lot of things together and I feel she can keep an open mind about things, whereas my dad is very wrong about a lot of things and will defend them to the death.   I'm not open with either of them though, and I honestly keep a face on when I'm talking to them. I really can't even force myself to act like me. I automatically act differently. I don't share much with them.    3) Have you experimented with any other drugs?   The only drugs I've tried are marijuana, alcohol, and diphenhydramine (Benadryl). DPH induces delirium and  hallucinations. For me, I had to take 150mg to get spacey, 200mg for delirium, 300mg for visual hallucinations (usually bugs or spiders), and 400mg for couch lock, an airy sensation in my head, and audial hallucinations that rushed past my ears. I probably got to that state of bliss about 5 times over the course of two weeks. I also used it about once every three days for about five weeks.    4) Do you ever get abusive towards animals?   Not really. I feel like I easily could do it, but couldn't deal with the guilt and remorse. One time I slapped the shit out of my friends dog and really liked it though.   Sorry for being so long winded, this all just flowed out pretty spontaneously."

But I feel like if anything we're just depressed. It can manifest itself in awful ways especially rage. I do know one thing though. When I get sad and life is getting overwhelming because I'm working too many hours or what have you and the big picture fades out of existence it seems, I find Psychedelics to be very cathartic.

mentalhealth,3ch7sc,xneon-rainbowsx,1 point,Tue Jul 7 21:57:14 2015 UTC,"Hey there. That's a really tough situation, and I hear you.  I have been dealing with similar stuff recently, and I found some help in looking at the healthcare.gov site. I don't know if you are an American or not (guessing so, since you have to pay) but they have a thing on there that works with you to get help in situations like losing a job. Whether or not you apply for medicaid, they can help you find a more affordable way to get insurance.  Also I just recently found out about goodrx.com. That is not for office visits, just prescriptions, but I think I will be saving about 90% from what I had been paying. So if you take meds, that might free up some money that would go toward the clinic payments.  You might also try calling your state department of community health (or whatever it's called in your specific area) and seeing what they know about stuff to help you out. I know in Michigan, where I live, there is a program called the Healthy Michigan program, which helps folks who are in a tight financial spot but aren't eligible for medicaid.  This stuff is really really rough, and it makes sense that you would be having a hard go of it. I was in a pretty dark place myself about it. But there is stuff out there to help you out. And also, you're being proactive and dealing with this! That's a big step. Go you! :)"

In depression your brain isn't functioning as it should. Meds help fix this. In depression your thought patterns can make you more depressed. Therapy fixes this."

mentalhealth,3cj0hq,Supportbot13,3,Wed Jul 8 08:52:00 2015 UTC,"I don't think the 'attention seeking' hypothesis is the best explanation as to the current 'popularity' or 'trendiness' regarding mental health problems in current youth culture. I think it's more likely that stigma towards mental health problems is slowly but surely declining, and therefore the understanding and widespread acceptance is increasing, (not to mention the advances of technologies such as social media), which would explain why it's a popular topic these days.  Additionally, assuming or accusing people of having 'attention seeking' as a prime motive for their behaviours can exacerbate their problems and hinder recovery in some cases, also whilst diminishing the seriousness of their illnesses.  However, you are right to be somewhat skeptical of people’s claims due to malingering and factitious disorder which are known by trained professionals who should be able to tell the difference between a genuine problem and a fake one, but I think you are over exaggerating the prevalence of these problems.  I do like your proposed solution, and in a saner world we would teach sanity from the get-go, although I would say the promotion of healthy emotional development is a role more fit for parents as opposed to schools, but I guess you could do both."

I've been mentally ill since my early teens, and now (late 20s) am comfortable enough with the older issues to talk frankly with my parents about it. But when the psychosis-ish symptoms began to manifest a little while back, it was still very hard.  I don't know your life or your situation, but this is what I would suggest:   Find a time when you can all sit down and have an unhurried, calm conversation. Let them know that you are telling them because you love them very much and want them to know what's going on in your life. Say something to the effect of ""I am already seeing a counselor and a psychiatrist I trust, and I am following their professional advice. I am working with them to responsibly manage my health."" I am sure your parents will worry, that's just a thing parents do, apparently. But they will feel a lot better knowing that you are being forthcoming with them and with professionals, and are working to manage your symptoms. Give them a big hug. Assure them that this is not their fault or yours, it's just a thing."

I knew something was wrong with my since I was 12 but I didn't see anyone about it until about 2-3 years ago. It took a lot of sessions with my then therapist just to accept what was going on with me (depression and anxiety). It took way longer to try to figure out IF I should tell my parents then WHEN to tell them. So one weekend when I was home from school my brain just decided to go for it. BIG MISTAKE THAT NIGHT. I did it when they were getting ready for bed, I got too defensive and emotional too quickly, and we ended the night basically screaming at each other. But it was a relief just to get it out in the open. Do I wish it could have gone better? Oh yeah.   But I have more than one coming out story. When I started medication I knew I had to approach things differently. The second time around I realized I can't handle speaking to my parents together. I feel ganged up on even when that's not the case. So I spoke to my parents one-on-one, in the afternoon, and after they had relaxed from any chore they did. This went SO MUCH BETTER. I was still emotional but it wasn't easy to talk about then. We did not fight though my mom and I had a little tension because she was of the ""snap out of it mind"" (which thankfully she is slowly getting that isn't helpful in the least).   Finally, the last little story I have is when I realize that I needed my relationship with my parents to change. They were always overprotective (not too bad) and I still felt like I was being treated like a child for the most part. I decided the one-on-one approach again but this time I wrote them a letter beforehand. I didn't think I would be able to think of everything I wanted to say when we had  our conversations so I wrote down everything I wanted to say and printed 2 letters. Again, this went so well!   So to finish my longer than realized post: You should reflect on what is going to make YOU comfortable. This isn't going to be easy for anybody. DON'T RUSH INTO IT!! Think about what you want to say. Are you going to be comfortable doing this alone or do you need a trusted friend with you?   I hope you get the advice you need! hugs"

ESA's should be calm and collected, and with the handler at almost all times. I would talk to her about keeping the dog a little more under control and taking care of the pup. Allergies are not something you can ask her to get rid of the dog for - if you knowingly entered a roommate situation while she had a dog or you approved of the dog moving in (knowing you had allergies), then I would suggest you looking for a new roommate and a new apartment. However, if your roommate got the dog while living with you and without your permission, then it would be grounds to ask her to possibly move out.   Having a pet is like family - you can't ask someone to get rid of a dog because of an inconvenience. It might just be time to not renew your lease and to find a new roommate.  Hope this helps!"

Do you want to stop the wellbutrin because you feel it's ineffectual?  Would there be any benefit of increasing your dose? As for the beta blockers it sounds as though they impact on your ability to get stuff done which is never fun. Have you maybe considered an atypical anti-depressant or a combination of 2 or more?  I know you're not keen on taking too many meds but if it gives you the ability to live relatively depression free then I for one (and do) see that as the benefits outweighing the costs.

You know those voices we have in our heads...our own self talk? The ones that tells you 'hey you look great in that outfit' or 'argh, I think I failed that exam' ? Well they vary for everyone. I don't think anyone has a positive image of themselves 24/7 - but there are some people's inner voice that is more negative than positive.  For some reason, that self talk is often what we believe. It sounds like that your friend has more negative thoughts than positive. The great thing is that she's noticing them! Often people who have a lot of negative self talk benefit from a therapy called Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (google it). You work with a pscyhologist to first notice those thoughts (sounds like you friend is half way there!) and then challenge them. By challenging them often people are told to question is what their inner voice saying a fact or an opinion. Often people's negative self talk are their own opinion - not factual. Once they can notice and challenge these thoughts, the habit of the negative self talk reduces. I hope this helps!"

mentalhealth,3ccpv5,Nikkiniknik,1 point,Tue Jul 7 00:15:10 2015 UTC,"Hi there, I think it's awesome that your wife has agreed to go to a support group. Sadly - different treatment works for different people - as you are  aware, even from professional to professional.  I would keep an eye on how she goes in the support group and whether her ED behaviour improves or not. It's great to be able to talk to people with similar experiences, but there's also evidence to show the they can trigger one another. I'm far from an expert, but I would recommend that support groups be just part of a wider treatment plan.  The benefits of a support group is that if someone she can relate to is seeking professional help, she is more likely to listen. I think it's hard to hear from someone, who hasn't experienced these things, to stop or change.   I would also suggest for you to have a look for mental health carer support groups. In order for you to be the best carer you can, you also need to be able to vent, talk and hear what others are doing. It might help you on figuring out 'where to start' as you said. Though it seems like you have done a great job so far!  Have you noticed an improvement due to her medication? If not, I would suggest she goes back to the Dr to have that looked at.  Take care of yourself. A high number of carers are at risk of developing mental health problems themselves, so it's important to look after yourself, keep connections to the outside world and keep healthy so you can continue to be the great supportive husband you seem to be. All the best."

mentalhealth,3cb0cf,luxdesigns,3,Mon Jul 6 21:41:14 2015 UTC,"In the US here. Yes, Prozac is still prescribed. However, over the past two decades, the market has been flooded with other SSRIs, giving doctors lots of choices of what to prescribe. These molecules often have only minor differences, and what works for one patient may not work for another. There's really no way to know how a patient will respond to a given medication until after it's been tried. As a result, at least according to my psychiatrist, the current generally accepted best practice in the US for patients looking to try an SSRI is to start with the drug that has the fewest negative side effects in the most people (apparently this is currently Lexapro/escitalopram, because that's what I was started on). If it doesn't work or if side effects aren't tolerable, that's when doctors start going down the list of other SSRIs. Prozac is still on that list, it's just no longer most doctors' first choice.   Regarding your concerns about aggression, when trialing an antidepressant you should be very careful to take note of minor changes in behavior. Your behavior may change in subtle ways that are easier for others to notice than for you yourself to notice. If you do become concerned that you are becoming more aggressive, it is very important that you talk to your doctor immediately."
mentalhealth,3cb0cf,brashbabe,1 point,Mon Jul 6 21:34:51 2015 UTC,It wasn't the first choice for me ether. I took two other antidepressants before and they didn't work so well for me. Thank you foк answering!
mentalhealth,3cb0cf,caseynouveau,4,Mon Jul 6 21:49:13 2015 UTC,"SSRIs, due to their activating nature, can amplify some underlying behavioral tendencies when a patient first starts out on them. It isn't all that common, and it's not the kind of the thing that happens past the first month or so. It is more common in juveniles than it is in adults. This is why there is a brief period where there is a heightened risk of suicide when taking this medications. The risk dissipates over time once the drug begins to start fully working.  Prozac is actually sometimes used to treat aggression, by the way. It is not an SSRI that is likely to amplify aggression in the initial stages of treatment.  Prozac is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines -- so no, it is definitely not something facing a ban. It is one of the safest SSRIs currently available."

I went from 5 panic attacks a day to never. Maybe give antidepressants a chance?

SSRIs are better for calming your daily panic."

I know Zoloft is an anti-depressant, but I didn't really feel depressed before I was on it. Mostly anxious. And it has helped a lot.

It's one thing to be able to pick up that someone is deals with anxiety and/or depression, but to diagnose what kind of anxiety disorder they have, or what kind of depression takes more time obviously. This psychiatrist I saw was kinda weird too. He really suggested that the group therapy sessions at the clinic would be quite beneficial to me, but when I mentioned that I'd like to see a therapist one on one, he said that that wouldn't have any benefit to me ever...

It seems really weird to be all hyped about a drug without trying it. Your doctors sound like responsible people. Social anxiety (making phone calls, job interviews) is much more effectively treatable with SSRI. Sure helped me.  I have used and abused a wide array of psychotropic medications and it ended bad every time. Two panic attacks per month are not worthy of taking benzos. Learning coping skills will help you more in the long run, try CBT."
mentalhealth,3cd21f,BoosterBooty,1 point,Tue Jul 7 02:16:11 2015 UTC,"I have no fear of being addicted to a drug. I've dabbled in many recreational drugs without the slightest and sign of addiction, whether it be mental or physical. I also smoked cigarettes for a couple years in my late teens, and quit cold turkey because I thought it was stupid, and I didn't feel any withdrawal. I'm so over getting high from drugs, that I wouldn't even consider abusing benzos. With the kind of anxiety I have, I wouldn't need to pop a pill often at all; therefore, if I only used it when I actually felt like I needed it, there would be no concern for addiction. Just because you chose to abuse benzos doesn't mean I should be concerned about it. There are millions of people with a coke habit, and I've managed to do it without ever feeling like I need more. Anyways, like I said, recreational drug use is in my past now, so I don't worry about the addictiveness of any pharmaceutical as long as it's not something I don't need to use often. Should you be afraid of being given morphine for pain just because people have opiate addiction? Seriously, if a doctor is smart, they'll only prescribe a certain amount each time, and obviously if you're coming back too frequently for more, they just cut you off, and if you rarely come in for a a refill, then it should be a non issue."
mentalhealth,3cd21f,Rakosman,1 point,Tue Jul 7 08:31:05 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the response. It does seem odd that your psychiatrist would discourage therapy. Having you choose your own antidepressant also strikes me as inappropriate. I think you're right to see a different psychiatrist.  However, I don't think it will be beneficial to keep seeing new therapists until one will prescribe you benzos without an SSRI. That's likely to be difficult. The confidence in your first post almost made it sound like you had been prescribed either an SSRI or a benzo in the past and had some first-hand experience about what works for you. If this is not the case, you're going to have to listen to the doctor.  You think an SSRI is the wrong medication for you, but you really have to understand that the doctor knows more about the medications than you do. You think an ""anti-depressant"" (SSRI is a better term) is inappropriate because you have social anxiety. My sister has social anxiety disorder and she takes Prozac. I have generalized anxiety disorder and I take Zoloft. We have both seen immense improvement. I know it seems sketchy to be diagnosed in an hour, and sometimes people get the diagnosis wrong. But both my sister and I were diagnosed in our first visits. (We didn't start the meds until a bit later, mostly to adjust to the idea.) And the symptoms you describe here are a strong fit for an SSRI.  I get that you don't like the idea of being on medication all the time, but that's where medicine is right now. To reject the concept of daily medication, not because you disagree with the diagnosis, but because you disagree on principle, is like telling your doctor that you'd really rather manage your diabetes without taking insulin. If those are your beliefs, that's absolutely your right to refuse medication. But you can't expect a doctor to prescribe you your preferred medication because you rejected theirs.  Honestly, if multiple psychiatrists have recommended and SSRI, just try one. My Zoloft is so much better than my Klonopin. Klonopin just makes me feel drunk. Zoloft has actually substantially improved my anxiety. You will not feel less like yourself, you'll feel more in control. Side effects are a possibility, but you can always change the meds until you find one that works. My side effects consisted of difficulty having an orgasm, and that lasted about two months before going away. So minor compared to the benefits.  Or get over it and give up on the benzos. If it's not a bad enough problem to try an SSRI, it's not bad enough to need benzos."
mentalhealth,3cd21f,elanvital07,1 point,Tue Jul 7 13:45:00 2015 UTC,"I have been prescribed an SSRI in the past. I just didn't get the prescription filled. I have never been prescribed a benzo before though. So I don't have first hand experience with either. I'm just aware of all the side effects that come with SSRIs, and I know people (all girls) who have used Ativan, and said it benefited them a lot. One of them ended up abusing it, and was snorting it, so of course she was cut off pretty fast. She's pretty into recreational drugs though, and I'm not and wouldn't consider abusing a benzo. Even if I was still into doing drugs recreationally, I still wouldn't consider abusing a benzo, because that's just as stupid as messing around with opiates.   Anyways, the girls I've talked to about it all seem to have similar if not the same kind of anxiety as me, and they all felt that it benefited them a lot, and they only use it from time to time, whether it be before a job interview, a first day at a new job, or first day starting college, or if it's for a random panic attack. This is why I wanted it. I definitely get random panic attacks that I really don't want to have to deal with anymore; however, they're not that frequent, usually just once a or twice a month at the most now, sometimes I'll go a couple months or so without any. But I definitely get very high anxiety that's very close to a full blown panic attack when applying for jobs, going for interviews etc. so I tend to completely avoid these situations, and it's holding me back.   I'm 25 years old and living with my parents right now, working a minimum wage seasonal job. It's just not acceptable, and the fact that the psychiatrist thought that's something I should be proud of is absurd. Perhaps if I only just started working after years of not working, it would be something to be proud of, because it would be a small step forward, but I made that small step a few years ago and seem to be stuck again. I can't afford to be in this position much longer.   I'm well aware that I shouldn't completely rely on something like Ativan to completely fix me. I know it's more of a band-aid than anything. I just figured it's a good quick fix, so that I can't start moving forward right away, and then I could do therapy as well, and eventually use Ativan (or whatever it is they prescribe me) less and less, and eventually just be a well adjusted person who can live life without the help of a drug.   I'm still gonna give it one last go, and see if I can acquire a benzo. Sure I could be wrong, and maybe it's not the drug for me, but I've heard great things about it. Ultimately though, if I keep hitting a wall, I will give into the SSRIs. As much as I don't want to be on them, if there's absolutely no possibility of me getting a benzo, or if I get it, and it's just not something that works for me, like it has for others, then I will try an SSRI, because I definitely don't want to be stuck in my position any longer.   Seeing as you have actually been on an SSRI, I was just curious, can you drink alcohol on them? I no longer touch drugs, but I still like to drink from time to time. I don't drink often, usually just once a month at most, but when I do drink, I'll be honest, I tend to drink to get drunk, cuz I drink socially with friends when we all get together. I'm sure that questions just a quick google search away, but I thought I'd ask anyways. Sometimes things are deemed safe, but some people don't think it should be, given their personal experience."
mentalhealth,3cd21f,justin7120,1 point,Wed Jul 8 01:50:47 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I guess I can see where you're coming from in not wanting to be on an SSRI. If you are overall happy with your level of anxiety except for relatively isolated panic attacks, a benzo might make sense. The stress surrounding job application strikes me as something that might be better treated with an SSRI, though I can't be sure. (I'm 25 and applying for jobs right now too. Ugh.) The more general social anxiety is definitely better treated by an SSRI, but if it's not at a level that you feel merits treatment, that's reasonable.  Keep in mind that you can be on an SSRI temporarily. If you feel stuck in a rut with your current employment situation, you might find that medication helps you motivate to get to a better place and in a year you won't need it anymore. Or you might find that it solves some chronic issues that you didn't realize you had and you want to stay on it. I'm not sure which way I'll go yet.  If you are going to try for a benzo again, just keep in mind that your doctors don't know your history with drugs. You can tell them that you know yourself and you won't abuse it, but that is probably going to sound like something an abuser would say. Maybe suggest a plan where you start seeing a therapist now, and if they feel that a benzo might be appropriate after a few sessions, you'll start it then? That's really just a guess though.  You can drink on an SSRI. It can exaggerate the effects, so my psychiatrist told me to take it slow the first time and assess any differences. I haven't personally noticed a major difference, although I've always been a lightweight and I really only get drunk (as opposed to buzzed/tipsy) once every month or two, so YMMV."
mentalhealth,3cafgg,xbofax,1 point,Mon Jul 6 10:53:26 2015 UTC,I really wish they would have offered up different mental illnesses. Schizophrenia is one mental illness that can be so outwardly noticeable. I would have liked them to include depression or suicidal thoughts..even eating disorders. Those are much more common and not as noticeable from the outside.
mentalhealth,3ca2sm,sobbingnightingales,2,Mon Jul 6 07:43:01 2015 UTC,"Good morning! Hope this finds you in a better place than which you are writing about. Let me start by saying you are in the right place and you are going the right direction. I can definitely relate to you, I am 21yo female who also attends college, although I am about to enter my senior year.   My freshman year I had a difficult time adapting to college.My parents were very worried for me when I came home for christmas break and recommended I see someone. I agreed to see a therapist and while I do believe she helped some, I can honestly say that my desire to get better, feel better, and do better is what got me through. This is not for everyone but I started a running plan I found online, stuck to it, and ended up running my first half marathon the summer following my freshmen year. This simple thing helped me feel successful and showed me how determined I could be when I put my mind to something.  The endorphins from exercise and the time I spent outside in the sunshine definitely helped my mental state. Regardless of what worked for me, you have to do whats right for you. Simply writing this post shows you desire to make a change and that is monumental.   I am no doctor, but I am in the school of health and human sciences and have taken plenty of courses on health both mental and physical. With that said, this does not qualify me to diagnose you in any way, and I am not intending to do so. I can say with certainty that I believe you have good reason to see a doctor about this.  Like I said, I am in college as well so I know it's not always a simple as ""Just go see the doctor!"". I know doctor visits can be pricey and not everyone has insurance to help front this cost. First off, I would try looking into your university's student health center. If this is not an option I would try seeing your normal doctor. Let them know what is going on, and ask them if they can give you a referral to a therapist or another doctor they would recommend. From my experience, I would advise you to get a few opinions. Some doctors are happy to prescribe you a pill and insist upon your return just so they can make money. On the other hand, many doctors are incredibly helpful and understanding of mental illness. These are the doctors you want on your side, they will help you find the best solution to your situation.  Talking about your problems with someone that you can trust and who you feel is unbiased to your situation can be so freeing. I hope this helped you, if only in the slightest bit. If you have any more questions please feel free to comment back and I'll try to get back to you as soon as I have the chance.  If you take anything from this, please just know there are people out there who relate to you. There are people out there reading this who either, didn't have the courage or possibly the time to respond (and that's okay!) but they are reading it and you are being heard. You want to better yourself and that's so amazing, channel that and keep moving forward!  Cheers,   Hailey"

mentalhealth,3c5a7m,ColdEmpathy,2,Sun Jul 5 01:18:23 2015 UTC,"Hi ttlgeek,  This is my first post on Reddit; I’ve always been a lurker. After the blackout I vowed to use voat once it got up, but then I read your post and felt like creating an account.  First, I want to say I am lucky. I was very lucky. I struggled with depression since my teens (about 15 years in all), but I never got to where you are now. I was lucky in that, though I was depressed, I was likable and able enough to keep a face to never have reached the point of no return that you describe. Over the years, I fluctuated between employment and unemployment, stability (hypomania?) and depression, living by myself and living with my parents.  So I don’t want to pretend I understand you. I might be able to say that I have felt the same kind of feeling and have thought similar thoughts, but the magnitude may be great enough that I can’t say that honestly. You were mistreated far more than I, so I didn’t reach full cynicism until recently.  Your thesis is spot on. Someone will surely say that not everyone is like how you described. That is certainly true, but that’s only because there are many types of people. Besides, it misses the point that those were the type of people in your life, and your social interactions have spiraled down to the point of being “jaded, jealous, and hateful towards society.” (I like the Oxford comma.)  You correctly point out the hypocrisy of the doublethink that people use all the time. I am lucky and deserve it. I dispense wisdom by judging. I understand by giving advice. I like everyone, except for those I don’t. I am generous, but the homeless are lazy. I have compassion, but the depressed won’t help themselves. I sympathize with scrutiny; I cherish with insults; I love with abuse. Ignorance is bliss, no?  To be honest, I didn’t read quite all of your analyses of the obviously useless advice you posted. It was really hard not to skim (the analogies) when the assumptions are so painfully obvious. I’ve heard some of them, but I’m fortunate enough to not have been mistreated with the more offensive ones.  Your experience with therapy is, sadly, typical. I’ve had therapists simply reflect what I say, and when I ask for their suggestions, they say I need to solve my own problems and not expect other people to do it for me. My current therapist has given the same advice for two years: “Do it even though you don’t feel like it, and eventually you’ll feel better.” I can’t believe I was so stupid to see him for so long only because he was friendly.  Cognitive behavioral therapists like to say that you’re irrational, and by attacking these beliefs, you’ll feel better. Except that you’re being rational. Could they, from their comfortable chairs, tell a hungry child with dysentery that their pessimistic forecast is irrational? Even if you could swallow a pill that instantly changed your beliefs, your negative emotions wouldn’t magically go away.  Self-affirmations are even worse because they harmed you. Science has actually already shown this. When a parent, for example, coaxes a child to “go play with the other kids because it will be fun,” they’re actually telling the child that it’s not fun. Otherwise, why would they need convincing? Incompetent therapists blindly assume this method works, in the same way that they assume everything works.  Sports are at least honest. They tell you the risks beforehand, ensure that you have strength to execute techniques, and instruct you in taking precautions. Clinical psychology has no such safeguards and abuse their patients. If therapy can be powerful, then by corollary, they can be dangerous. Meditation is especially guilty of this; it’s not a panacea and has hurt you and one of my friends.  Sorry, I’m ranting somewhat tangentially now about therapy. You seem to have a clear mind. You’re even aware enough to observe the mental barriers that enclose you; the less mindful would merely feel them. Everything you’ve said makes sense, and I would feel exactly the same were I in your shoes. I don’t want to imply that I completely agree with you, but that’s doubtlessly due to my better circumstance.   So what are your circumstances like? I’m currently in a “down” state and living with my parents, but (I hope) things are looking up. I only shower once a week but at least brush my teeth everyday, something I wasn’t doing a few months ago. Basically I just surf the web and read interesting things. What do you do to pass the time? Do you have things that pique your interest, or do you typically dredge through mindless content?  If you wonder why I bothered typing the above, it’s because I want to empathize with you. Not for your sake, but for mine. I’ve realized it’s a skill I’m not good at, partly because people didn’t quite understand me, so I haven’t really learned. Perhaps I’ll use this new account, though, to interact more outside my comfort zone, instead of simply reading. Assuming reddit doesn’t implode.  Hope to hear from you,  ColdEmpathy"

mentalhealth,3c5luk,HipponaxThelight,1 point,Sun Jul 5 01:03:46 2015 UTC,I believe you might be suffering effects related to Sleep Deprivation. Have you been sleeping at least 6-8 hours per day? If no you should probably start to. When we stay up several days with little to no sleep our body starts shutting down and as a consequence your mind start losing its ability to think fast. it takes longer and longer to think. I advice you to sleep more if you want to recover from this.
mentalhealth,3c3l6l,MKRune,5,Sat Jul 4 12:53:57 2015 UTC,"Obviously, only a clinician can diagnose you, but some of the symptoms you describe are associated with depression. Clinical depression isn't just about feeling sad. Tiredness, lethargy, changes in appetite, changes in sleep patterns, changes in sex drive, lack of interest in things you used to be interested in, are all symptoms of depression. They could also be symptoms of something else though, so it is definitely worth getting checked out by a doctor, even if just to rule out any other underlying cause.  Other than that, it's worth trying to go through the motions of things you enjoy doing, in the hopes that your interest will be sparked again. Especially things like going to the gym, since exercise can really help with depression. (Edit: although, maybe try a different kind of exercise? A lot of people find the gym boring). Maybe try some new hobbies if your old ones aren't holding your attention. And try to meet some new people. Even if you don't feel like you're lonely, social isolation can definitely do a number on your mood and overall wellbeing. Try to get out there and make some new friends, even if you have to ""fake it till you make it"" for a little while. Meaningful social interaction might be what you're missing."
mentalhealth,3c3l6l,Topiary_goat,2,Sat Jul 4 16:44:04 2015 UTC,"IMO, I think you're obviously bored with your circumstances at this stage of your life, and that's getting you down. So something needs to change. The gym or exercising for the sake of exercising is, well, boring. I kinda like going to the gym when I'm motivated to but I prefer playing football (even though watching football doesn't interest me much, I still prefer playing it).  I've also forced myself to go to classes just to meet people (even though I hate meeting new people, it's still healthy to get out of your own head and internal dialogue, and have real conversations with people).  You say you don't hate your job, but do you find it fulfilling?  A lot of people comment on how great my job is, but I fucking hate it and am trying desperately to get out of it. Once I've done that, I know everything else will fall into place.  I too, am bored with my situation which has the knock-on effect leading to depression and so on and so forth."

mentalhealth,3c4tt5,mehnuggets,2,Sat Jul 4 20:10:22 2015 UTC,"I would say I'm introverted-if your definition of an introvert is someone who needs time away from people to recharge-but I'm quite out-going. I'm generally very comfortable in social situations and meeting new people but after a short (gets shorter as I get older) period of time, I'm like, get-me-the-fuck-out-of here; I need to go home, be on my couch by myself, and put on Netflix/Couchtuner.   I've tried numerous therapists in the past and haven't found they've helped me in a significant way. Two therapists in particular, I felt were incompetent. Silently ponders to the therapists after paying the $150 for the hour...""Did you hear what I said?"" Cuz, it sure don't feel like it. sigh  I think there are a lot of limitations in psychotherapy and our understanding of mental health is still in its infancy. It'll be interesting to see how this field evolves as we learn more about the brain, the mind, psychology, etc. Depression, and our understanding of it in particular, I think will develop. How can one word describe the range of ""I need to be in the hospital for weeks on end"" to ""I can't get out of bed"" to ""I was depressed and then I changed my mindset-click here to see how I did it"". My point is that I'm sure each person felt depressed but their experience of depression and how (and if) they got better varies dramatically. I'm completed convinced that some people are born with a depressed personality and genetic vulnerabilities while others need to give their head a shake and have someone go ""look what you have around you, you ungrateful shit. Get your head out of your ass."". The only problem is that how do we separate the former from the latter.   I talked to this psychologist once and he spoke of how one of his clients is a ""mental health consumer"" and she would bounce between different therapists. Her desire to get better was there but the impression I got from the therapist was that there was a problem with her and not the therapy itself. Based on my experience, I think his arrogance around the ability of talk therapy to heal people (and I should mention he wasn't arrogant, but it seemed that he felt that psychotherapy was perfect) is seriously misguided. There's likely a reason why she bounced around--nothing was working for her! Don't blame her! Psychotherapy is NOT perfect!!!   Anyways, I've had a couple of glasses of wine and I'm on a bit of a rant. Thanks for listening.   /mehnuggets - are you introverted and if you have tried psychotherapy, has it worked for you?"
mentalhealth,3c4tt5,amberheartss,1 point,Sat Jul 4 21:12:43 2015 UTC,"I am introverted. I feel the need to get outside and such, but I am more of the guy that just wants to listen and have some contributions to what other people start as conversation. I have some problems with not being energetic through the day, and relationship problems (not being very talkative has been the top barrier). I feel jealous on friends that can stay up working their passions and such till 2-3 in the morning and then be fresh at 8 in the morning. I barely make it till 18-19. Also I cannot go on like this with my relationships. I have been to a consultation for meds, but he said it won't do for my condition, and that psychotherapy should be the solution. I have my doubts about this from multiple points of view. Firstly that I am an introvert, and I don't actually feel any relief telling people about my problems. Secondly, although my pragmatic part is saying ""you're not unique little shit"", my emotional part feels like my problems cannot be put up in a standard procedure in order to be resolved, as people are a lot different from one another. I am also afraid of spending money for nothing, like going to a psychotherapist that would just go ""aham, aham, aham. How that made you feel?"" and then repeat this process indefinitely."
mentalhealth,3c4tt5,amberheartss,2,Sat Jul 4 21:26:36 2015 UTC,"Interesting. Do YOU feel like there is anything ""wrong"" with you or is it  the people in your life (your relationships) that are saying there is something you need to fix?"

Right now I am finishing college, within a well paid field, but I am just like ""fuck it, I just want a break from the world, I just need some fucking QUIET."". I just want some rest. The biggest problem of all are my relationships, which haven't gone too far because I don't actually feel the need to talk just for the purpose of starting to talk. Moreover, whenever I get in a relationship I tend to go in comfort zone, and to not give an actual fuck about anything (by that I do not mean I hate the world, by that I mean I am just feeling like I am in a zone where I can rest). I feel the need to transmit my love to that person more physically (and I am not only talking about sex), I feel the need to nurture that person (cuddle her, you get the drill), make some activities with that person (take her to the theater, go on vacation, play sports, etc). Well that doesn't go too well, because most girls feel the need for conversation to be permanent in the relationship. From this point of view I am not freaking sure if I have a problem or not (I tend to considering more to having an actual problem because I want a healthy relationship too, like any other human being) because the comforting part of me just yells this is me and it's normal, the pragmatic part yells though luck it's not normal and you should change."

What a lot of people don't realise when seeking therapy is that it's ok (to be recommended really) to try a few out. You can contact a few and have a one off session with each to see if they feel like a good fit. You can also explain to them that this is what you're doing, and they'll probably be used to that and shouldn't be offended. If they're offended, that's probably a good sign that they're not a great therapist!  A lot of therapists will even offer you a free session (maybe just half an hour or so) to sort of try them out. When I started therapy, I think I ""auditioned"" maybe four different ones. Two I ruled out straight away, one was a definite possibility, but when I met the fourth, I knew she was the one. In the end, the only one that charged me was the one I ended up choosing.  By the way, as to how did I know? She had a lovely, calming manner. Spoke gently and respectfully straight away (some of the others were overly cheerful or, I don't know, casual? Which might not be a big deal, but didn't give me a good vibe.) She also seemed quite intuitive in the sense that she seemed to guess a lot of what I was trying to say even though I found it hard to talk. And she explained very clearly her approach to psychotherapy, and it just seemed to fit what I needed.  Anyway, definitely audition them, and if after several sessions they don't feel right, it's ok to go back to the drawing board and try someone else. It'd be frustrating and maybe feel like a waste of money, but in the end it's important to get someone that is the right fit for you.  It's also a good idea to do some research into the type of psychotherapy that you think will help you (and there might be more than one) and that will help you to narrow things down a bit."
mentalhealth,3c45b2,netusim,3,Sat Jul 4 16:27:00 2015 UTC,"It sounds like this makes you really anxious, so I think the first thing I'd suggest is just trying to find some grounding and relaxation skills to use. Practice them not only around the time of masturbating, but throughout the day.  What you're describing sounds like an obsessive thought and a compulsion to clean/avoid to get rid of the thought. I'm not saying I'm diagnosing you with OCD but I think being aware of the pattern is important. Use the coping skills you find useful to you and maybe practice challenging your fears of contamination. If it doesn't decrease, there is no shame in taking to a professional about this."

mentalhealth,3c37i5,mehnuggets,4,Sat Jul 4 09:17:01 2015 UTC,"I've been diagnosed schizophrenic, bi-polar, and depressed for about 8 years now. I'm currently on Geodon, Cogentin, Concerta, and Wellbutrin. Before I started taking geodon(I tried other meds to little effect) I weighed 175. I'm 6'4. Now, I'm 400lbs, and working out everyday to try to get back to around 200. The cogentin stops me from shaking due to the dopamine deficiency in my brain. Concerta is to help me concentrate and not just trail off into the distance. The Wellbutrin is the newest, and it's working ok, still trying out different times of day to take it. My sex drive is almost non-existent, and I think that's due to the weight. The geodon takes a ton of dopamine away from my brain, and about 6 months before this I was lactating. That has stopped and soon I will be trying saphris, a much newer and better anti-psychotic.   Now, this all sounds horrible right? All these side effects, are much better than living everyday as an unmedicated schizophrenic. I hallucinated across all 5 senses, and it was a living hell. I would be dead if not for these pills. I'd rather weigh 400 lbs my entire life than go back to that nightmare."
mentalhealth,3c37i5,Gdolf,2,Sat Jul 4 11:43:03 2015 UTC,"Not much.    Paxil made me gain some weight (40lbs.) Insta-side effect (as insta as weight gain can be) didn't go away. Wellbutrin decreased my appetite some, but not dramatically. (I'm losing weight at a healthy rate, and I was obese.) This was an insta-side effect, didn't go away.  Zoloft stopped me from reaching REM sleep after 6 months.  Paxil or Lamictal caused hand trembling, I'm not sure which.  I thought Topamax might have been causing tingling in extremities finally traced that to my painkiller Fioricet.  Klonopin gave me 2 straight weeks of nightmares, possibly? I was under a ton of stress that week, but I so rarely get nightmares that it has to be considered. This was during the ""settling"" period of the meds, hasn't happened since. Zoloft gave me vivid dreams during the same period, but they were significantly more pleasant.  (Little NSFW) I have sexual problems with a lot of these drugs. Paxil and Klonopin being the most notable. Paxil decreased my sex drive, and Klonopin can prevent orgasm entirely. I deal with that by just timing when I take Klonopin just right, if I want sexytime.  Finally, in ""Totally not acceptable"" Klonopin turns me into a high/drunk zombie. Even on a low dose. I'm still in adjustment stage, so I'm giving it time. But I stumble around and giggle a lot. Anxiety's gone, yeah, but so is my head.    I do have overall problems with creativity while on the drugs. I struggle to write like I used to, but I'm a published author now, so I have managed. I've considered a lot of these acceptable side effects. (Wellbutrin, Topamax, Paxil, Zoloft's dreams, the sexual ones.)   Disclaimer: My experiences won't be your experiences. They can be, but psych meds have such a long list of side effects for a very good reason: our brains are very different.   Edit: on the good side, before the meds I self-injured nearly daily, was actively, then passively suicidal, was having constantly exhaustive bad dreams (but not considering them nightmares, and I still don't.) I still sleepwalk and talk. I still have wild mood swings and weird things I just can't do. Still have panic attacks. Like... public drinking fountain? Can't touch that or I'll get poisoned. Can't sleep without a blanket on or something will grab my feet in my sleep. A bunch of that stuff goes away with meds.   I still need to find the right med mex. But I'll get there."

Formulate an exercise plan for yourself and stick to it every day. Find a spiritual practice that you're comfortable with and nurture that each day. Have a physical by a doc and rule out thyroid trouble and/or a vitamin D deficiency. Both of these can exacerbate mental symptoms.

I don't care in any personal way about 9/11 or Columbine. That's normal.  I care about Sandy Hook because I care about mental health. I struggle with mental health issues and when I see people with mental health issues I empathize with them. It makes me sad that a person would be in such a bad place that they would do that. I don't put effort into empathizing with the families affected because that would be pointlessly tragic.  I do not care in a personal way about Chick-Fil-A. I don't spend time thinking about the people hurt by their actions. It does not upset me emotionally. If I took the time to think about the eventual ramifications of the strengthening of anti-LGBT organizations it would be easy to care in an emotional way. Think about transwomen being brutally beaten. Make up a story with fully developed characters about a woman who can't say goodbye to her female partner on her deathbed because they aren't married. Better yet, listen to true stories about it. I think you have the capacity to empathize with them if you put as much time into it as you do an episode of Game of Thrones.  But you don't have to do the empathy exercise every time. I think you can logic your way through it and figure out which causes are more deeply upsetting than an absence of fried chicken without actually having to feel that pain first hand."

I have seen a psychotherapist three different times; twice to help with severe depression and once when I found myself in a relationship with someone with Borderline Personality Disorder.  Having a good therapist,  someone who intimately knew what was happening in my life and where I could be perfectly honest was invaluable to me.    Right now I'm just working my way back to not wanting to die every day after being in therapy for a year.  (Twice a week for the last 5 months, although last week we moved back to once a week.) My therapist has a view of me and my life that is very different from the way it often feels to me.  Depression totally skewed my thought processes and distorted everything making my self assessments unreliable. It's amazing what insight, an honest relationship and a different viewpoint can bring to your life.   Sometimes just making it to the next appointment was all that kept me going.    If you find a good therapist,  therapy can be life changing."
mentalhealth,3bzqc4,radio_dyke,1 point,Fri Jul 3 15:01:11 2015 UTC,"I have read what you last said about still being depressive, but I am curios if the psychotherapist helped you keep up your relationship with the BPD person , get past over that person, or both? Also, are you usually a person that feels the need to be listened by another person? By this last question I am not trying to insult you in any way, I just want to get to know in which cases this kind of therapy actually helped."
mentalhealth,3bzqc4,radio_dyke,1 point,Fri Jul 3 16:00:02 2015 UTC,"The relationship with the BPD person started off amazingly and then a year or so in suddenly turned to horribleness. I couldn't figure out what the hell was happening and according to my girlfriend it was all my fault. I went into therapy to try to work out what I was responsible for and what  was going on.   It was my therapist who suggested that my partner had BPD and recommended some books to read on the subject. I read them with a skeptics eye but my girlfriend was pretty textbook and it was hard to ignore the obvious. I then decided to try to make it work for a year but if things where still terrible I would then leave. My therapist helped me with strategies to deal with my partner and to sort out what was mine in terms of responsibility for the horribleness. Then when the year was up he supported me in my decision to leave and helped me recover from the damage that she did to me.   I'm not exactly sure how to answer your second question. I really like talking about life experiences and sharing philosophies about living with people. My friends and I share stories about our interpersonal relationships and interactions with the world. I like talking about and figuring out my own and other peoples motivations and reactions.  Therapy is a place where I can do all of those things but with a trained professional who can highlight and offer insights and points of view I may otherwise miss. Plus therapists are skilled at talking about these things so they can help bridge the gap between feeling and thinking.  Connecting with people is super important to me and connecting with someone who is trained and totally focused on me, my feelings and the way I choose to live is a pretty amazing experience. At the same time it is often difficult and challenging work and I leave feeling slightly devastated as often as I leave feeling better. Still I can't deny that my mood is improving and that I am changing in significant ways.  That being said, if you aren't interested in talking about who you are, why you do the things you do and how to do them differently then psychotherapy probably isn't a great choice.   Hope that helps."

I am usually more flexible in a more materialistic manner (like: let's try a new sport, let's get into a club, etc.), rather then let's be more positive, let's try not to go directly to our dark zone when facing situation X, etc.. I do not usually find comfort in speaking about my day, etc. actually speaking with people (I do not mind it, just I do not find it my first thoughts when I want to relax). I enjoy being around people and completing the conversation, but a lot of times I just like to just enjoy their company. That has been relationship barrier, as with every girl that I have been, on the 3rd 4th date I would gradually reduce conversation and get in a comfort zone where I do enjoy spending time with that person, cuddling and going places, but I do not feel the need to start the talking (I do not mind it, just not the person that starts it). As most women need comfort from speaking to their partner, I have not gotten very far (1-2 months). I also get energy drained more easily than my friends/colleagues. While some of them can stay up late till 2-3 in the morning and then get up at 8-9 and still be fresh all day, I can still be energy drained by 18-19 even if I had a good sleep.

All I can say is that I was once an abusive man and my mental illnesses pushed me toward more and more volatility. I am glad that I ended the relationship before anyone got seriously hurt.  You cannot abide the behaviour, cross your fingers, and hope some of what you say sinks in. You cannot go gently, gently. What is happening now is his problem. He is struggling. There is something wrong with him. It was something in his life that has caused his emotional ineptitude and volatility. He needs it to be clear that you will not go down with his sinking ship.  He has two choices; Get help and improve, or you leave him.  There's no excusing his behaviour. And while I agree that mental illness plays a role in abusive behaviour I do not agree that you can concede to him that ""it is not really you, it's your illness"" because that is a form of validation that doesn't help him. It absolves him of any responsibility for his actions, which is the exact opposite of how to handle the situation. He needs to be responsible. He needs to understand the ramifications of his behaviour. And you need to prioritise your health and well-being well and truly before his."
mentalhealth,3byhp8,vanityobscene,3,Fri Jul 3 05:39:18 2015 UTC,"I agree that your professional experiences and subsequent detachment are likely masking the seriousness of this situation. It's an issue that most mental health providers have run into at some point in their lives, but fortunately is a challenge that allows for a lot of growth and greater well-being.  From what I have read, this sounds like a very toxic relationship. That's not a judgment on him or you, just a statement/observation. Most people in toxic relationships are not ""bad"" people, and others can sympathize or logically understand why things happen the way they do. That said, it is possible to understand why someone acts a certain way while also holding them accountable for those behaviors. When we do not maintain our own boundaries, we creep toward codependency and parent/child dynamics, which are not healthy for relationships.   It is not your role or job to educate or fix him. Supporting someone is fine, but support is no longer just that when it continues to a point that we allow others to tread upon our boundaries and impact our well-being. Someone can violate boundaries in different ways. From what I have read, I would say that your boundaries are not respected when he screams at you, uses harsh words and verbally attacks you, destroys property (punching holes in the wall), engages in crazy making (""you're being a crazy person"" and initial denial), and repeatedly does not take action to seek help and change behaviors. It sounds like he relies upon you to reign in his behaviors while concurrently resenting you for it, very similar to the interactions between a teenager and an adult.   As you know from your own education and work, a key component of helping others w/ mental illnesses is insight. Someone needs to truly understand and believe or accept that their actions are hurtful to themselves or others, and then they have to be willing (or the consequences have to be great enough) to take action to change things. It sounds like he does not actually have insight yet into his behaviors. Also, the cycle of initial denial and anger, then guilt and apologies, followed by going right back to beginning again, are signs that he does not have actual insight into what is going on, on top of being signs that this relationship is not healthy for either of you as it stands right now.   I strongly encourage you to take a look at this resource: http://www.mentalhealthamerica.net/co-dependency and to reflect upon your answers to the questionnaire. If you find that you agree with a lot of what is on there, I think reaching out for support from a trained therapist will greatly benefit you and help you with taking steps forward with regard to your partner. Lastly, I've found that these books have been very helpful for others in very similar situations to yours:  Boundaries: Where You End and I Begin  Dealing with the CrazyMakers in Your Life: Setting Boundaries on Unhealthy Relationships  Best of luck to you!"

I saw you doing it and it was like a huge punch in the gut, and since then I've been trying to formulate some kind of response, and it has actually been pretty painful. For anybody who cares; Hi, I'm the boyfriend.  I'm not here to complain about you, make you feel bad, or whatever. I am slightly disappointed that you decided to air this out in public, but you're a grown woman and can do whatever you want.   I've already told you I am open to counseling together, and am looking for a therapist in my new area. And you know these things. I realize that maybe only nine other people saw fit to say anything to you about this, but I'm not going to lie, my goat is a little bit gotten. I feel there are details that may be necessary to mention.  I admit fully to essentially everything above. Literally, all of it is true, from what I know. But it is also important to note that the only facts presented are negative. Occurrences of these episodes are few and far between. For the greater part of our time, I am calm, reasonable, and we are happy together (as far as I can tell). Of all the thousands of walls I have encountered, only two have ever sustained damage.  Another fact that I bears mentioning is that most of these episodes occur while I am, in fact, asleep. I take a lot of medication, as prescribed by a doctor, for Major Depressive Disorder, Bipolar II, and Anxiety Disorders. There are often times when I am not conscious, but still capable of communication. These volatile episodes happen almost exclusively while I am in this strange, angry twilight state. The result of this includes a very foggy memory of these episodes. What I do remember is pleading with you just to allow me to return to sleep, which I assume I would have done had I remained unobstructed in doing so.  These kinds of hostile episodes while I am in half-sleep don't just happen to you. You have noticed me very upset with other people. This has been happening since before we even began dating.  I know it's a problem. I don't know how to stop it. I am likely the most mellow product of emotional and verbal abuse on Earth.  If you really feel this strongly about it, I have no right to say that you are blowing anything out of proportion. Honestly, I feel that the amount of time that this actually occurs is minimal. When it does, I don't even know what to tell you, or anybody else. I am not in control, and I don't see any way to gain control. I don't even see it happening, I am just asleep. It pains me that I can hurt you so much without even realizing it, but I am out of ideas. You've told everybody you can think of all about it, which is probably the most embarrassing thing ever to happen to me, and you don't want to accept the idea that, for some reason, I am out of my own conscious control. I am running out of things to try. If these incidents hurt you this much, leaving me might be the best option. I am tired of losing control, but it won't stop happening, and I don't even know how I could try to stop it.  So now I am asking you kindly and simply to stop running to everybody you can communicate to in order to tell them all about how great I am except for these times when I am not. I don't need my dirty laundry aired all over the internet, and among people I know and respect. I don't like being raked over coals, and I especially don't like it when I don't even know how to fix it. But please, if it hurts you that much then I don't want to hurt you anymore. But I don't want to hurt over it either. It affects my daily life and makes me feel like a giant piece of shit every moment of every day. What is happening isn't healthy for either of us."

Her strategy was that she would tell him ahead of time ""If you x,y, or z, I will leave. And I will come back, but not until I'm ready."" and she did. And he would scream and throw things, and she would walk out the door. It turned out that he wanted to be with her and he began to take notice of what his behavior was doing to their relationship.

mentalhealth,3bykth,NationYell,2,Fri Jul 3 05:30:31 2015 UTC,"One thing that I think is really important to know (and say, and repeat often) is that people with severe mental illness are far more likely to be victimized than to victimize others. A great deal of the stigma surrounding psychosis stems from the idea that everyone with psychotic symptoms is violent, predatory, and lacking any empathy.  Another thing to remember and share is that folks with unusual or seemingly very little expression are still very much capable of processing and feeling and knowing. A lot of times I see people say, oh, people with X don't have any empathy, they aren't fully human. Well, first of all, everyone is fully human and fully deserving of dignity and respect. Second, just because empathy is not demonstrated in a typical manner doesn't mean it's not there.  Something that I think can't be repeated enough is that mental illness is not a personal failure. It's so hard to un-internalize that feeling.  Finally, intrusive thoughts are actually pretty common. They can be incredibly scary, but I think that's often because you feel alone and don't know what's happening. But they're pretty common, and often benign."

One of the things that has gotten to me is when mental health proffesionals is that they can actually undermine my illness  and the stuff I deal with becasue I'm not psychotic and hospitalized.  They see that I'm kind of functioning and I'm not suicidal and think that's a success, like it can't be that bad if you still shower and work part time. A lot of the time I hear people saying that people focus too much on their illness but for me I find it more difficult when mental health practitioners think that not sucidal is the best I can expect and that i should be grateful for that. Sorry, rambling, but I just fimd it difficult when people who shoulld know better say that I can;t be that bad because I'm not experiencing the extremes of my condition. Also,  I feel a lot of people who have dealt with mental health problems do know what, logically, they should do but just can't do it at that moment.  So reciting again and again the 'go for a walk, have a shower' eat well'  is all well and good but most odf the time it's not ignorance on the patients side it's just that they really can not physically do that."

If you like baths, go get some awesome bath stuff and take the time to seriously enjoy it. if you like reading, get yourself a book you've always wanted to read and set aside the time in the evening to read it. just do something that actively removes your mind from the lab. sometimes not thinking of the same things constantly can also help you see things in a different way which can be helpful too."

mentalhealth,3bw7a4,SavageDark,1 point,Thu Jul 2 18:05:21 2015 UTC,"The only reason I'm even concerned about the diagnosis is because treatment doesn't seem to be working. You see, after I finally got my medication straight with help from the second doctor (wellbutrin for depression and depakote for bipolar) I had another psychotic event. It was earlier this year in February, at the same convention I had gone to last year. I had trouble sleeping for several days before, and finally ended up awake for three days straight (not purposely, I can assure you). I started having abnormal thought patterns / delusions just like during my previous psychotic event. However, this dissipated much more quickly. Roughly 48 hours after onset I was back to 'normal'. This occurred while I was taking depakote. So if that isn't going to prevent psychosis, what is the point of even taking it?  I just don't know what to think or do anymore. I'm actually in a pretty good state right now. Got a new job, have settled into a routine, have even stopped Wellbutrin since getting my new dog a few weeks ago (Wellbutrin was always supposed to be on an as-needed basis because of the bipolar thing). No psychotic events since February. Depression is not currently an issue, though I do still feel... ""altered"" I guess; I have a pretty benign passive deathwish even now,   I agree.

Just remember to keep in mind that maybe the time it all started is a trigger for you and take extra steps to keep yourself stable around then. What I do as August is coming on (I've already started this year) is I start writing in a journal to monitor how I'm feeling and I increase the appointments I have with my psych. I'll communicate to my family too that it's usually a rough time for me so if they notice anything unusual they'll  say something to me or my partner. Sometimes if I'm feeling particularly... off...

Also mental health illnesses are genetic and onset around early 20's. For me it onset when I was 23. I'm diagnosed with Bipolar 1. The first episode I had was one of the scariest times in my life. I had a few more there after but I learned to recognize the 'state' i was in and focused my thoughts on anything good and positive. I'm not saying it's easy but it's a strategy.  Often at nights I feel a void inside me and it's the depression that takes me there. What has helped me with this is to write whatever comes to mind. Dont stop, just keep writing, writing and writing. This should help to channel whatever you are thinking and feeling. It should help you understand what is going on at the time.   Keep a regular sleep pattern. I cannot emphasize this enough. My pattern was off for a long time and it made a definitive effect on me. Now I notice the difference.

mentalhealth,3bwbci,StripperWhore,6,Thu Jul 2 18:04:07 2015 UTC,"At least where I'm from, it's not necessarily a permanent thing depending on what else is going on. If she is straight up depressed and there isn't another issue like substance use going on, then the state will probably look on that with a softer light. They will work with her if she is trying to get better. The fact that she is seeking treatment is a much more positive sign of her ability to parent rather than hiding. In that vein, she needs to show them that she's serious about getting better. A repeating pattern of inpatient treatment probably doesn't look good. She needs to get a handle on her mental health. It's not some abstract thing that happens to people, it's part of the individual and is within their control.   More to the point though-- do you think she is truly capable of caring for her children in the face of suicidal thoughts? My experience of working with people in this situation says probably not. That's a very scary situation for the children. The state isn't always in the wrong when intervening on situations like this. And again, it's not necessarily permanent.  Bottom line-- she's not just going to get better on her own, by gritting her teeth and bearing it. Encourage her to get help."

I'd encourage your friend to get treated as needed and have a plan for her kids' care, which shows she is responsible and dedicated to their safety and care.

Avoid the news if you can- difficult, I know, cos I feel the need to know what's going on in the world myself. Get your therapist to practice relaxation and distraction techniques with you, upping the haldol only masks the issue, and it always helps to have a backup of skills to compliment the medication. Ask for a depression screening/assessment and a full physical check up just to rule out any other issues that may be making you feel low. It may be something that can be sorted out just by talking about it, but for peace of mind, it's worth checking it out."

mentalhealth,3btf2y,wildwolfway,7,Thu Jul 2 00:18:26 2015 UTC,"Some clinics, especially those dedicated to mental health services, keep a lot of free samples on hand.  If you are out of meds or will be, get on the phone and start calling around. Try the clinics likely to service primarily low income people first.  They can usually keep you in samples of most anything until paperwork can go through for patient assistance programs through pharmaceutical companies (and they will assist with this). If you have a few months of meds you may go straight for this.  You may need to make minor changes to your meds, but I have never had to doing this.  Finally, if you have a serious mental health issue and none of the above is possible, I strongly recommend that you start finding a way to move somewhere  where there is adequate support for you no matter what."
mentalhealth,3btf2y,JanitorJoe,3,Thu Jul 2 01:27:57 2015 UTC,"Try www.goodrx.com. It's a legitimate site on which you can get coupons/discounts for a wide variety of meds at a large selection of pharmacies (the site even lists the price differences at each of the pharmacies near you), including online pharmacies. As an example, let's say someone is prescribed Seroquel/quetiapine 100 mg 30 tabs 1 tab each day. This Rx normally costs $120-160 out of pocket, but the coupons/discounts available from the site bring the price down to $12.90+.   Also, look into whether there's a significant difference in cost dependent on the number of pills dispensed each time. Not all but many meds become more expensive when 30 pills are dispensed versus 15 or 45 versus 90 and so on. You can speak w/ your prescriber and see if they are willing to tinker w/ the mg and quantity amounts for your medication so that you get the same dose but in the most cost effective way. Using the same example as above, if there was a big difference in price b/w 30 tablets versus 15, you could see if the prescriber is willing to write the Rx for Seroquel/quetiapine 200 mg 15 tabs 1/2 tab each day. This won't work if the medication is a capsule or can't be split because it's extended release."

Its hard when you feel like you can't trust your own mind, but I think you need to trust what your body is saying. If you feel something is wrong, then it is. Even something psychosomatic is still physical, its just that the psychiatric field is better than the medical field at treating psychosomatic illnesses. What matters is that you find a treatment that works for you. I recommend that you pursue both lines of treatment. So definitely get that GI issues checked out, but maybe you should also get a new psychiatrist and continue therapy and try different antidepressants."

mentalhealth,3bnbbx,I_GRAB_BALLS,2,Tue Jun 30 18:35:16 2015 UTC,"I agree with /u/darthatheos that making time for your mental health is important. I would look at any way you can start to make that a priority, whether it's getting an appointment w/ the same doctor or a new one or finding clinics that offer evening and/or weekend hours. Some medications can trigger disinhibition or a manic response, which can result in an increase in aggressive thoughts to self or others and an increased urge to self-harm. It is very important for the doctor to know that not only is the medication not helping, but that it also seems to be connected to what you described above.   These thoughts and feelings will not go away on their own and without some kind of intervention will most likely increase in both frequency and intensity. If you take active steps now to prioritize and treat your mental health, you greatly lower the risk of eventually being involuntarily treated due to everything snow balling into a crisis, and you far increase your likelihood of feeling better and maintaining your every day activities (work, school, etc.). Best of luck to you."

mentalhealth,3bmv5q,jellotrain,2,Tue Jun 30 14:28:46 2015 UTC,"Your feelings are understandable and are ones that most people feel when starting therapy or seeing a new therapist, so you are not alone. Therapists are trained to be sensitive to these feelings and to take time to build trust and a healthy rapport/relationship with you. Therapy involves difficult work at times in order to bring about change, but the therapist will work with you to do this in a way that is helpful, planned, non-judgmental, and not re-traumatizing.   For the first session or two, your therapist will likely ask you what brings you to therapy followed by general questions regarding current symptoms and your background/history (have you received mental health services before, any history of suicide attempts, current and past medications, etc.). They may discuss establishing some goals for what you'd like to accomplish with therapy and give a general idea for how often they would like to meet with you and what therapeutic modalities they'll use (likely cognitive behavioral therapy [CBT]). They'll likely also talk about privacy and confidentiality and any fees/co-pays/insurance.   You can definitely let your therapist know that you're feeling nervous about attending therapy and that it may be difficult to respond at times. If a question comes up in which it is too difficult to respond, you can definitely say something like, ""I can't talk about that right now, but maybe down the road I can."" Your therapist will be understanding and non-judgmental about these difficulties and any others that come up.   If you feel like your anxiety is ramping up in the time leading up to the session(s), you can remind yourself that you are safe, that it is normal for people to experience these feelings before therapy, and that they will pass. Taking slow, deep breaths in through your nose and slowly exhaling through your mouth will also help to manage the physical parts of the anxiety (like heart rate, sweating, etc.). Using a stress ball or worry stone--really any physical object that you can focus on and touch--may also be helpful.   I commend you for taking this step forward and I know that the same courage you showed by scheduling the appointment will also help guide you through the anxious feelings. I wish you the best!"

I haven't paid for psychology in a long time (always had bulk billing psychs), but I think it's about $120 per session or something, of which, medicare generally gives half or more back."

mentalhealth,3bkxv0,sahcratik,2,Tue Jun 30 02:32:34 2015 UTC,"For me medication was a godsend, but I also went through a bunch of therapy techniques that I've found helpful in rebuilding my life post hospitalization.  I've just recently been certified as a peer specialist, and am pursing a couple jobs in the field, some at hospitals and some at group homes. We're trained with various techniques that help motivate and guide people to reach their own ideas about recovery and their own goals to pursue. We also share our own experiences with the mental health system in hopes that others can benefit from our experience. That said, the main thing we do is listen, validate, and support.  Peer Support jobs have been increasing over the last few years as they fulfill a vital niche of someone with lived experience that isn't there to diagnose, fix, or order around. We're there to listen and support.  That said some employers are better than others in what restrictions they place on us, but it's nice to see willingness to embrace a different approach than purely the traditional 'doctor as fixer' role. The health care system does pose some challenges as well and at some places there is pressure to produce tangible records rather than focusing on having an organic natural relationship.  That said I'm still very new to the field."

It's been now two and half months that I stopped taking it, as suggested by my doctor. For two weeks I took half of the usual dosage (0,25mg), then completely stopped with it. Insomnia kicked in for me much later, and I'm still trying to adapt in that field. Some nights I sleep normally, others I keep waking up. It's a mess, honestly. It sucks to keep up with university while experiencing all these symptoms. Cold sweat, dizziness, muscle pain stopped in about a month, I think. Then I started to experience emotional roller coaster. That stopped about two week ago. I was extremely irritable, depressed, overly sensitive. What helps is knowing it's just normal symptoms, it's not a sign of regression or anything like that.

A slow taper is pretty necessary. Slow like .25 mg reduction every 3-4 weeks slow, especially after that amount of time.   It's fucking badass you're kicking the kpin.

Being able to help other people who are in tough situations I can relate to makes me want to get up and go to work each day. Supportive people made the difference in my life and now I can hopefully play that role for someone else.  Sometimes it takes a while to find out what it is you want to do. I know it did for me.  Is there anything that dissatisfies you in your life? Getting in touch with your dissatisfaction can be a powerful energizer for change. Is there anything in your life that you'd like to do or share with people?   When I was feeling disconnected from people I started volunteering at soup kitchens which made me feel good about myself and was a step on the path to joining the peer support movement.

Does your university offer therapists? If so, start that and you'll have someone who can help you with accepting yourself the way you are, and who can also inform you better than us about the different kinds of therapy, so that you'll have that knowledge when you look for your next therapist.  Anyways, since you want to accept your body, what about dance therapy or yoga? It might be harder to find a dance therapist (or art/music therapist) but there should be plenty of yoga places to choose from in most cities. I think something like yoga can help you reaquaint yourself with your body. Whereas talk therapy might help you understand on an intellectual level that your body is good, but might not reach an emotional level of understanding."

I would love to try dance therapy, maybe one of the doctors I see can recommend something.

The next thing I might try in your situation would be to extend that same positivity and good vibes that you shower yourself with to other people in your life.  Spend time thinking of others and seeing them for the wonderfully radiant beings they are and wishing nothing but the best that life has to offer for each and every one of them.  There's a practice in Tibetan Buddhism similar to this called Tonglen which could be instructive to learn more about.    Congratulations on retraining yourself to have a more positive outlook on life by the way!  That can be a difficult road and you may find that you get some joy out of sharing more of your journey with others who may be struggling with some of the same issues that you've faced.  Giving back to others can be a great way to cultivate joy in your life and learning to see the best in people who may not even see it in themselves and then holding up that mirror for them can be a very rewarding experience.  Focus on what you want and spend less time battling against what you don't want and you'll find it comes easier over time."

I see a lot of similarities with myself and OP, and I can say that one of the best habits I've tried to start is actively thinking about the other people in my life.  Ultimately, I think obsessing over and micro-managing your mental state is something of a dead end; it's a great skill to notice your triggers and negative thought cycles but you're still left worrying about yourself most of the time, and I'm pretty sure most people on here can attest to how miserable that makes you feel.  If you already have a mindfulness practice and you're already confident in focusing your attention internally, I'd definitely try switching it up with something focused on compassion.  The technique I use comes from Headspace but seems pretty common in Buddhist circles.  Essentially it's deep breaths -> body scan -> visualize a ray of light that expands as you remember nice things you've done for others -> when it fully covers your body visualize someone you know/like sitting peacefully somewhere with the same ray of light starting to cover their body as they get increasingly happy (essentially, sharing your contentment with them).

Also, don't bum out because you are not the average kid - there are treatments for ADHD and therapy how to deal with autism. Actually, someone in my family did not speak until he was 4 years old as well (but could draw tanks and skyscrapers and communicate with ""sounds"", and he was playing/building his own computer instead of regular Lego) - he started to talk very clearly at the age of four. He is still socially a bit awkward sometimes (meaning not that much empathy), but he used his assets to build a solid friendship with some people (concentrated on only these) and acquired social skills through putting himself through all kinds of ""trainings"" and mingling with many different cultural and social groups. He kind of soaked up everything he saw. Today, he has his own family, has a very high-paid job and a solid group of friends, with one or the other being added.  Yes, he still has problems to get too close emotionally - sometimes I have the feeling he just ""functions"" as society demands of him. But he is doing really well. And he loves his wife and kid. Maybe you have not found the one thing in your life that you can make your passion, but you will! For me, you just sound like any normal teenager not wanting to socialize to some events and struggling with normal problems. If you are diagnosed with depression, the doctors will get you help and therapy. And be assured, you are not the only one, and with time passing, it won't be as bad as it seems. All the best for the future - in the end, it is up to you if you get yourself together and seek help for those areas where a professional advice and guidance is needed. I am sure you will do fine! :)"

(http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3031095/) (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3552245/)  What physical effects can we be harboring from the abuse or the PTSD? The tender physical bruises have long healed, and yet we remain connected to our past with such a memory and emotional consequence that our organs and systems can not even sustain their negative health impacts.   The fact that emotional impact is a known causation in psychological and physical disease is undeniable.   There is also a glossary of positive research on the health impacts of forgiveness. (Forgiveness as human strength: Theory, measurement, and links to well-being.

mentalhealth,3be7z0,Ikari_Shinji_kun_01,1 point,Mon Jun 29 02:24:50 2015 UTC,"I worked in a group home in Illinois that was run by DCFS. Mine housed teenaged girls with developmental disabilities and severe mental illness. Given the high acuity of the clients, this one was extremely chaotic.   All efforts to maintain a structured program were shut down by some of the clients' unwillingness and lack of desire to get better coupled with the influence they had on the other patients. We also were incredibly short staffed, so the clients 'took control' and would destroy the milieu, run away, and attack whoever they felt like. It was very unfortunate; the few girls that actually wanted to benefit from the groups couldn't because the staff had to focus their attention on the clients who were misbehaving.   Some of the staff at my group home were disgustingly corrupt. My boss told one of the clients that ""this dirty white girl (meaning me) wouldn't make it a week."" Favoritism towards the clients was very common. Some of the preferred girls would receive special privileges despite their erratic behavior, while some of the girls that behaved but weren't as liked by the program director would not receive the privileges they earned. For example, one of the privileges would be a weekend outing to an arcade or a movie. This would be rewarded to the clients that were able to refrain from any physical aggression for one week. One of the patients who refused to attend groups, wouldn't go to school, and threw punches at staff three times in one week was taken to the mall while another patient who was very compliant had to remain home because the aggressive patient ""didn't like her.""   Besides choosing favorites, the staff would turn the pot by pitting the girls against each other. The staff would spread gossip to Girl A about something that Girl B did, which would then result in Girl A and Girl B getting into a brawl. Fighting was a very common occurrence.   I also caught a staff member, who was responsible for purchasing groceries for the patients, stealing food for her own family and withdrawing money from the budget for her own personal use.   It's not uncommon for staff to hit the girls back rather than using nonviolent crisis interventions.   This group home used a ""leveling"" system to determine privileges. Each client got a point sheet for the day, and would earn points for doing basic tasks (getting out of bed on time, hygiene, doing their home jobs, attending groups). After the end of the day, the points were added up and the client would be assigned a level for the next day: ""Top,"" ""Middle,"" ""Lower,"" or ""TA"" (therapeutic assignment). The higher level you were, the more money and privileges you would earn. If you were aggressive, destroyed property, or attempted to run away, you'd be placed on ""TA"" in which you received no privileges and weren't allowed to use the telephone or go out (even though the staff abandoned that rule).   If you're curious, this was the basic schedule for our group home:    6:00am - Wake up, morning medications  6:15 am - Hygiene 6:30 am - Breakfast 7:00 am - 2:00 pm - School  2:30 pm - 3:30 pm: Alone time in their rooms  3:30 pm - 3:45 pm: Expectations group and snack  4:00 pm - 5:00 pm Group therapy, art therapy, or gym time  5:00 pm - 5:30 pm: Dinner 5:30 - 6:00 pm: Home jobs 6:00 pm - 7:00 pm: Group  7:00 pm - 8:00 pm: Hygiene, snack, evening meds 8:00 pm - 8:30 pm - Phone time  9:00 pm - Bed    With that said, every group home is different. Things would have flowed much nicer if we were a lockdown facility (requiring a key to leave the building), if we ditched the corrupt staff and hired more staff (or maybe even security) to keep the place safe. Some group homes can be very therapeutic and provide the structure needed for the patients to stabilize."

I may post a lot of negative here. Personal experiences jaded me. ;) But there is positive too.   I lived in a home as a kid. There were at least 40 kids in that home. You learn all kinds of new sh*t in a home like that. Exposure to all kinds of abuse. Kids talk. Swap abuse stories etc. Mine were physical abuse and neglect. Some of my closest friends in there experienced sexual abuse. Welp...now I was a kid that knew details of what happens when an adult sexually abuses a kid.   All the kids have issues. It manifests in different ways. Inappropriate sexual activity. Poor boundaries. Violence etc.   Competition & jealousy. That happens in small group homes too. You just need 2 kids from seperate families to have this behavior.   Kids will compete and get jealous over what gifts they get at Xmas time. The group home doesnt have the funds to buy gifts. It comes from the families.  Some kids are going to get a $5-$10 hand held game from a cheap store...another may get a gameboy. (This happened in a home I worked at as an adult.) Those kids are going to poke and pick on each other over whose gift is better. Gifts may end up being broken....or a physical fight may break out. This can happen in foster homes too.   I adopted my nephew from foster homes. He experienced the same thing. I had to teach him that in a family...everything is equal. He kept wanting to brag that he got the best mp3 player/video game etc....and if everyone got equal gifts....he went into a dark pouty mood. It took about a year to change that.   Lol. Whats good. If the support workers and programs offered are good...your brother is going to get the help he needs. You guys will see progress.   Check their qualifications and training.   The other stuff...he can survive if he has enough good supports. If he has some resilience....or if thry help build some resiliency.   Gift problems. I don't know how to fix that in a home. You can't make it all fair and equal. Some parents are poor...or too damn cheap. Others can afford more expensive items.   The price of the item isnt even the issue....as a kid my cheap little clock radio my mom gave each of my siblings snd I were broken on us. Some jealous older kid came around and broke them. Other kids got more expensive gifts...but somehow the clock radios got the most hate and jealousy. No idea why. We were either too happy over them...or its because we got a day visit with our mom. Other kids didn't.  Who knows.   Maybe if a gift is sent to your brother...include some stuff for the other residents. Chocolates. Movies for the whole home. I don't know.

If it's the later, you can expect abuse & should try to get the person out of there.    The whole point of psychiatric violence (taking people's human rights away) is pretending they're subhuman, like an animal, & treating them like one.  They can violently beat, suffocate, etc this person in forced druggings.    And after all that, what is the torture victim more likely to do?  Commit Suicide.    Ironically, victims of psychiatric violence/torture are more likely to commit suicide, and it should be obvious why:  They were tortured & soon realized most of humanity is (currently) nothing more than barbaric thugs violently overpowering others to gain the most profits."

You may get a preliminary diagnosis. 2. Do what they say. May include (depending on their opinion) medications (depending on their opinion/diagnosis/knowledge), and hopefully a referral to a mental health professional for diagnosis.   You need to go to a mental health professional, probably over several visits in order to reach a diagnosis if applicable and where to go from there. A GP is a great place to start as they will be able to refer you to the exact right services for you, whether that be to a psychologist, psychiatrist, or another mental health service/professional."

mentalhealth,3bb4eg,Ktmagnolia,2,Sun Jun 28 12:53:57 2015 UTC,"I am someone who has also been anhedonic for a few years now.   To answer your question, no, I didn't have something that worked, no med that reversed the situation, no life changing experience that let me feel again. I've been stuck with it for a long time.  Suicide is something I've previously tried because of how awful it is, but after two failed attempts and seeing how that has affected my family, it is not something I can conscientiously try again.  The only thing that worked for me were three things: alcohol, basketball (or any sport), and friends. Even when I'm hanging out with friends, I'm not happy, but at least it makes the day go faster. Basketball is something that you can use to keep yourself busy (unfortunately off season now). And if you drink in the evenings, it's makes the worst part of the day go by in a blur, a barely memorable blur.  So no, I don't have any positive words of encouragement, or some solution for you. I've just found the best way to get by is to find something to keep you busy, or slightly south of sober, and it makes every day a little bit shorter (weed also helps and is less toxic).   And at the end of the day, in the business of mental health, as long as you can make it through the night and get to tomorrow morning in one piece, everything will be ok.  Take it one day at a time and try to find things that keep you busy.  Maybe there's a solution out there, but I don't have it. If you find it, let me know."

mentalhealth,3bcccs,plaid_banana,1 point,Sat Jun 27 21:39:43 2015 UTC,"I post this advice a lot:  The symptoms you've related, plus the trauma history, are consistent with what is seen in those with a dissociative disorder. However, most psychiatrists are not dissociation-aware, so here are some possible next steps  1) Look over the website www.strangerinthemirror.com, and perhaps read the book by that same name mentioned there, as this will be a low-cost look at whether or not you identify with the hidden symptoms as described therein. There is a depersonalization screening (not diagnostic) test on that site, one of five screening tests the book has regarding other dissociative phenomena that you may be experiencing. Reading the book and taking the self-tests could help you in relating your symptoms to a health professional.  2) Check out the ""find-a-therapist"" link at the dissociation society website: http://www.isst-d.org/default.asp?contentID=18 Most therapists out in the world are not yet dissociation-aware, so this listing should help you identify those who are. Dissociative disorders, if you got one, have a good prospect for recovery WITHOUT a lifetime of medications, assuming you find a dissociation-aware therapist that is right for you, and assuming you are motivated for the insight-oriented therapy that looks at one's lifetime of dissociating experiences."
mentalhealth,3bb78k,Needhelp19691234,6,Sat Jun 27 15:31:00 2015 UTC,Three weeks is not nearly long enough to get the kind of result you are looking for.  Go back to the doc and try a different one.  Different people respond to different meds.
mentalhealth,3bb78k,tralfaz66,3,Sat Jun 27 15:45:40 2015 UTC,"The majority of psych hospitals (at least in the US) are primarily for emergency/crisis care for people who are imminent threats of harm to themselves (actively suicidal), or to others (homicidal), or because of a serious mental illness are unable to care for their basic needs (gravely disabled/psychotic).  Without minimizing the severity of your presenting symptoms, my concern is that you will not find the type of help and support you are looking for from an inpatient psych hospital.   Most psych hospitals are very short-term as well, with an average length of stay of 3-4 days. However, if you are feeling afraid that you might actually try to hurt yourself or attempt suicide, by all means go to the hospital."

Most U.S. Hospitals are only there to stop you from killing yourself and medicate you until you are stable. Think of them like emergency bandaid. If you want to just get better, you need to seek out psychiatrists and therapists, not an inpatient hospital.  Inpatient facilities cost over a grand per night. You have to go through ER and lab work to get admitted and they will also run close to two grand. The hospital billed my sister 5 grand for two nights stay. Our insurance paid and adjusted away most of it and we were responsible for 200. Check with your insurance first before you do anything."
mentalhealth,3bb78k,Always_Excited,1 point,Sun Jun 28 14:36:28 2015 UTC,"I did 16 days inpatient, and that was nowhere near long enough. I did get desipramine after refusing lexapro and abilify, it is old school and good for pain, but I had to give it up in less than 30 days because heart damage was found after I got out of the hospital. I also got ativan, neurontin, blood pressure and thyroid meds. I did not get a mood stabilizer which I really need.  I have a funky marriage which started my depression/possible bipolar or brought it out more the longer I was married. 24 years this year. My health is crap, his is pretty good except for sleep apnea.  I had a very high cortisol early in the marriage (stress hormone) almost over the limit. I have all kinds of health problems I didn't have before I got married. I was forced to quit  my job from daily migraines for 20 years straight. Friends moved away or were dead, and family problems with little to no support.  Now it's just me and him. I have a few online friends urging me to leave.  Unlike you I was so disappointed in the low rent psychiatrist I got I stopped going after my evaluation at his group office. I should have just found another one but I regressed almost immediately into the agoraphobia w/ panic. I know I should probably leave, but being honest I'm not sure I have the guts to at this point.  I think it would take me a long time to recover my old self fully, even though I started to look good enough in the hospital and after that the shrink couldn't see how distressed I really was. I had to shout at him to get his full attention.   I am married to an emotionally unavailable man (I think he has a specific problem but the shrink disagrees, but he doesn't have to live with him) and it is killing me. I am starting to feel demented, as I seem to have memory and cognition problems as well compared to how I used to be. My body is literally falling apart from the stress. Yet with everyone saying run or die, I can't seem to get out. I am frozen in place and scared to death to move out on my own when I can no longer drive or think clearly and make decisions, manage finances etc.  I also never finished my medical testing and there was a lot to do and repairs to make.  I found several places, one for sure in Michigan you can stay up to a year but the bill would be huge I imagine.  I would go because it would be a way to get out of my environment and into therapy all in one place (mobility  issues,) but you are already divorced and have seen therapists.  If you are not in danger, I'd say find a better therapist.   I don't have the nerve to even get the results from my evaluation after 4 years. I'm afraid I'll never get out. If I'm lucky I'll croak in my sleep from heart failure like an anorexic friend did when she was 20.  Unfortunately a nurse called me a survivor so I'm afraid I'll last longer than I care to. Longevity also runs in my family except for a cousin that shot herself in the head I only recently found out.  I also have no children, and am disconnected from what relatives I have left.  So not a lot of reasons to want to live a long life ill/disabled and alone.    If you get a better therapist and meds or even ect for depression (I've seen it work wonders,) you sound like you have a better shot at getting better but it may take time I would imagine. I guess it depends on how you respond.  Sorry for the long ramble but our situations sound similar in how they started.  I do think I was already semi-damaged from my home life and the marriage just about finished me off."

But I think it's important to have the humility to not expect 'normal' people to care for someone who themselves is not normal.   I think it is also important not to want a relationship where one is being looked after. A relationship with two mentally unwell people can be more challenging than a traditional one I do not doubt this being a possibility. Mutual respect, not mutual dependence is hard enough for most people to achieve. It is quite vital for the unwell."
