He certainly popularized it and made it accessible to the public through his numerous advertizing commissions, and is definitely one of the styles best known names. His rise to prominence started with the nearly life size posters he did for Sarah Bernhardt's theatrical performances.  They struck a chord with the Parisian public and he became highly in demand, and his personal style was widely copied. He did excellent painting (see his slav epics), costume jewelry (for Sarah Bernhardt mostly), real jewelry, lamps, statues, in addition to his graphic work. Art Nouveau is a ""total art "". Most of his Art was produced on commission and not as art for art sake."

It's just neat seeing this stuff, otherwise restricted to imagination (or cartoony pixels, or text), played out to its fullest extent, realized in one way or another. The aesthetic and technical virtues are additional factors, but the basic representation itself is a pretty satisfying thing.  I sound like I've never seen art before."

People around the time of this painting being made didnt have the chance to see an epic blockbuster picture.  I guess this could have fulfilled that ""niche"" for them.  An epic artwork like this.    Now we have gladiator movies but all they had back then was stories and a crazy painting like this. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pollice_Verso_(G%C3%A9r%C3%B4me)#/media/File:Jean-Leon_Gerome_Pollice_Verso.jpg  Fun fact: this painting influenced the movie, Gladiator."

As I did so, I realized that the left sleeve is very long, so I began to pull it. It was so long it went out of the room, all the way into the bathroom. After pulling it, trying to get to its end, I found myself in front of the dark bathroom, pulling stronger and realizing that someone or something is pulling form the other side... For me, this vivid dream is a representation of the darker side of human psyche, pull into inner darkness and our often futile resistance to that pull.   Thanks for sharing!"

ArtPorn,3cja6y,drjellyjoe,1 point,Wed Jul 8 10:15:12 2015 UTC,"This painting by John Rogers Herbert depicts a particularly controversial speech before the Assembly by Philip Nye against presbyterian church government.  A meeting of the Westminster Assembly on 21 Febuary 1644 inside the Houses of Parliament. Philip Nye, a member of the independent party, argues that the form of church government advocated by the presbyterians, under which local congregations submit to higher assemblies of elders, was ""thrice over pernicious, to civil states and kingdoms"". He was immediately ""cryed down"", according to Robert Baillie, who kept a journal of the proceedings. The painting depicts many individuals who were not members of the Assembly, because when issues of particular interest were debated, non-members would attend as spectators. Josias Shute, however, died before the Assembly met.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westminster_Assembly  http://www.reformed.org/documents/wcf_with_proofs/  http://www.reformed.org/documents/wsc/index.html"

Her father and mother, and perhaps all her kindred, have been destroyed by her foes, and she alone preserved as a treasure too valuable to be thrown away. She is now among barbarian strangers, under the pressure of a full recollection of the calamitous events which have brought her to her present state; and she stands exposed to the gaze of the people she abhors, and awaits her fate with intense anxiety, tempered indeed by the support of her reliance upon the goodness of God.

ArtPorn,3ad2kb,WouldBeSomething,2,Fri Jun 19 19:34:03 2015 UTC,"At his best, Millais created some worthy paintings, but mostly he was a shlockmeister - a purveyor of kitsch, chocolate box art. This is a poor painting. What is intended to come across as a vivid colour palette ends up being garish and undisciplined. There's some very dodgy drawing here too - the perspective on the goldfish bowel, the anatomy of the girl on the left. Most of all, the treatment of the subject is just so twee.   EDIT: The general feeling is that it is a great shame Millais went in the direction he did (selling out to sentimentality in his middle age) because his early works show greatness, and he had a masterly virtuosity of style when he was in the zone."
ArtPorn,3ad2kb,WouldBeSomething,2,Fri Jun 19 07:42:48 2015 UTC,"Twee? I can't remember the last time I had to look up a word.  Oh, and ""chocolate box."" I never heard that phrase before either. Very apt. Well worth posting for that alone."

ArtPorn,3ad2kb,joeray,1 point,Fri Jun 19 14:27:17 2015 UTC,"I think your use of twee is completely anachronistic.  Unless I am not couched enough in the use of British language, I don't know of a context for describing a type of music and lifestyle in the late 20th century spanning past centuries and eras to a time period where it would have nearly zero meaning.  Maybe young girls looking desultory seems 'twee' to us, but it has zero use in criticizing a painting over 150 years ago.  This is the 'leisure class' we are talking about anyway."
ArtPorn,3ad2kb,invisiblette,2,Fri Jun 19 17:25:07 2015 UTC,"I think your use of twee is completely anachronistic. Unless I am not couched enough in the use of British language   Yes, 'twee' is a chiefly British English expression, and is used in a pejorative sense to mean 'sweet or cute in a way that is silly and sentimental'. When something is twee, it is over the top in a sugary kind of way, just like this painting. It's not anachronistic, but perhaps a little rarefied in spoken discourse nowadays."
ArtPorn,3ad2kb,WouldBeSomething,1 point,Fri Jun 19 18:19:31 2015 UTC,"No, in America its actually a hugely loaded term (at least for people of a certain age)- usually communicating a certain amount of loathing or derision to the sensibility or signifier it refers to.  Twee can be something excessively cute, but it also refers to a sensibility - like for old quaint albums, a very soft and precious taste in music (see Belle and Sebastian) or anything old, cutesy and unizue.  Probably not doing a good job of explaining it, but if you described someone as twee - you'd be summing up their taste in music, fashion and general love of nostalgic things and their relative shyness and what kind of emotional expression they value.  There's a really in-depth article I read today that I'll spare you, but if you're curious just google twee and read the article from the Atlantic magazine."

But I have no idea why the farmer is standing there holding that kind of knife and wearing a bloody apron. I can only conclude that he just murdered the dog.  Edit: I was being tongue-in-cheek. It is obvious what message the painting is trying to make, I just think it makes it poorly. As /u/buzzandthelightyears says below, it's meant to seem ""deep,"" but doesn't have any actual substance."
ArtPorn,37l2ws,Eliphion,4,Thu May 28 14:27:53 2015 UTC,It's commenting on the fact that we eat and abuse the animals on the right while we cherish and care for the animals on the left. There really is no difference between the two groups of animals other than the fact that we have normalized the abuse of the farm animals.
ArtPorn,37l2ws,jaden_the_great,1 point,Thu May 28 16:04:27 2015 UTC,"Farming animals for food isn't an inherently bad thing, or atleast I don't think so. It's when you trap overweight mother pigs in cages barely larger than they are and force them to eat, milk, and give birth in that exact same spot forever, or throwing male chicks into an industrial paper shredder that you've gone too far."
ArtPorn,37l2ws,Designer94,3,Sat May 30 13:04:18 2015 UTC,No one is abusing horses or sheep.  You could make a case that poultry are abused in massive farms... but you could also make the case that dogs are abused in puppy mills.
ArtPorn,37l2ws,jmottram08,5,Thu May 28 16:43:03 2015 UTC,"Sheep are maimed all the time in the wool industry and they are absolutely slaughtered for food. Horses are forced into manual labor all the time (on farms definitely and think about those carriages around cities - the reason those are getting banned all over the place is because they are cruel and often result in exhaustion and death).   Puppy mills are literally the worst, but the point this painting is making is that we befriend dogs and cats but decide that other animals only exist to serve humans.   There's a really good book you should check out about this if you're interested! It's called Why We Love Dogs,  Eat Pigs, And Wear Cows by Melanie Joy PhD."
ArtPorn,37l2ws,jaden_the_great,4,Thu May 28 16:53:42 2015 UTC,"Horses, at least in America, are not used in farms very often any more. Carriages yes, but the only place that would really lead to exhaustion is NYC. Driving a carriage won't kill a horse if it's given proper care. That just means it should be better regulated, not banned. And horses in America are only slaughtered for dog food and other such purposes, it's illegal to slaughter horses in America for human consumption. If we made that legal, people may stop shipping them to Mexico to die in absolutely horrid conditions. We have an unbelievable amount of horses that need to be adopted but since they're 10x the responsibility of a dog, we run out of options and must slaughter them. Anyway, back to the point. Most farms don't use horses because it's a waste of time. They have machines that can do all the work. The main exception I can think of is when ranchers are rounding up and branding cattle, then horses are used."
ArtPorn,37l2ws,dressageaddict,3,Thu May 28 17:04:58 2015 UTC,"Given the aesthetic, I think it's probably meant as much as symbolism it is an accurate depiction of modern American agricultural practices. Especially given the artist is Polish."

Cats are neither large nor powerful.  Most cats are in barns because they are natural predators and control the rat population. Something cats enjoy doing.

ArtPorn,37l2ws,Beanbaker,0,Thu May 28 18:37:13 2015 UTC,Horses probably not.  But I'd wager sheep get abused like any other eaten farm animal.

ArtPorn,37l2ws,buzzandthelightyears,5,Thu May 28 15:16:05 2015 UTC,"Sorry for awkward language - not native speaker.  The picture conveys how unfairly we approach different species of animals. While all have very similar bilogical and neural complexity, have ability to feel emotions and pain just as every other. Pets get all the best from us, while domestic animals are universally (ab)used in cold calculative manner in similar way to non living material or resources.  All domestic animals are killed once they stop being profitable - that is usually very early in their natural lifespan. Even those bred for not-direct consumption (hens, dairy cows, breeding sows) live short lives in cruel conditions.   (hens are bred to lay unnatural amount and size of eggs, destroing their bones and orgnas, male chicks from laying breed are killed right after hatching because they are useless,  dairy cows are constantly impregnated and their calses taken immediately  so they dont ""steal"" milk. Breeding sows are basically ""birthed to death"" in their gestation crates,  Anually, we kill 56 Billion of domestic animals + 100 Billion of sea creatures. Combined with this all being unnecessary (it is been many times proven humans can live just fine on plant only diet)   I have to go now, but this site is good resource: http://www.yourveganfallacyis.com"
ArtPorn,37l2ws,cervenamys,3,Thu May 28 16:06:07 2015 UTC,"Horses and donkeys can be eaten, but usually after their usefulness as draft animals has come to an end. Horse meat isn't terrible, almost like venison. Anyway, what people who post these things fail to realize is that people don't eat cats and dogs because they were never domesticated as livestock. Dogs were domesticated and served initially as hunting assistants and guards, cats probably just started hanging around people after the development of agriculture and they were useful in keeping pests controlled. The usefulness of dogs and cats traditionally exempted them as a food source, except in extreme circumstances."
ArtPorn,37l2ws,IShouldNotTalk,3,Thu May 28 15:17:13 2015 UTC,"While I agree with you, I feel I should reiterate that the dog is not represented in this painting, except, as I theorized, as a probable murder victim... and given the farmer's submissive pose, it was possibly masterminded by the cat. ;)"

Actually, if you focus in on the two figures you’ll see that the one facing away could be a very masculine woman or just a skinny young matador and the person across from him/her is an Irishman in drag, sporting a small hat, a billowy dress and a sharp red boutonnière. The scene is set someplace in Mediterranean Europe, a coastal village in drag-queen friendly, bull-fighting Spain perhaps.  The sun is setting and these two guys are just chatting away. Behind them, over the Irish guy’s shoulder, are some people walking by toward the distant houses. The bistro is by the river facing a spectacular sunset - yet the scene is surprisingly empty, suggesting that the two queens are having a very loud passive-aggressive argument and it became too awkward for the other patrons. Hopper further establishes this theme of loneliness by the gray and shapeless sky and the four isolated swaying trees in the distance, they’re beyond the bridge but no one knows where.   Overall I think Hopper intended this to be a deft message of solidarity for the harsh reality Irish crossdressers had to face in communist Spain.

ArtPorn,36fddw,AmericanSuit,5,Mon May 18 23:21:23 2015 UTC,This painting represents such a bizarre road not taken in American art. I often forget how important Germanic culture was in the early Republic.
ArtPorn,36fddw,durutticolumn,2,Tue May 19 08:06:41 2015 UTC,"Where do you see the Germanic influence? I think that if anything, the painting evokes the same reverence for Roman culture that is common in all Western art of that time."
ArtPorn,36fddw,durutticolumn,3,Tue May 19 18:25:35 2015 UTC,"This painting has long been associated with Germanic mythology, as attested on its the Wikipedia page. The subject is a twist on the Norse World Tree, and the style is highly remiscent of contemporary German Romantic painters (e.g. Caspar David Friedrich)  A painting evoking Roman mythology would generally portray a specific action in close-up, with the landscape merely background and often exaggeratedly minimized in size. In German Romanticism, the whole point is to depict the vastness of nature."

ArtPorn,36d8vk,Saruz,13,Mon May 18 13:39:29 2015 UTC,"Caused quite the scandal at the time.  While the reclining nude has been around since forever, the fact that Olympia was a prostitute bushed boundaries. Rather than Venus laying next to Eros, or a virginal bride in her wedding chambers awaiting her new husband, Olympia lies impassively as a bouquet from a John is presented to her.  They had to hire guards to protect it from vandals."

She is covering her vaginal region up because it is for sale essentially which is also why she is crossing her legs. Also she looks at you as the viewer dead on because she is sizing you up to pretty much see how much money you got.
ArtPorn,36e8qx,Marisska,3,Mon May 18 18:27:00 2015 UTC,"Vrubel described this Demon as ""a spirit uniting in itself masculine and feminine qualities…a spirit, not so much evil as suffering and sorrowing, but in all that a powerful spirit…a majestic spirit"". Demon Seated is the generalized depiction of the soul. The inner focus of the eyes, the intensity of the huddled movement of the body, and the clasped hands all isolate the figure and produce an image of profound introspection."
ArtPorn,36agre,Marisska,5,Sun May 17 19:35:11 2015 UTC,"At the beginning of 1898 Ivan Shishkin, then aged sixty-six, produced a picture that revealed for the last time the artistic capabilities of the grand old man of Russian landscape painting (soon after completing his work, on March 8, 1898, Shishkin died). This was Mast-Tree Grove, a canvas that synthesised, as it were, the various facets of the master’s creative manner. A well-composed work and one of his largest, it produces an impression of monumentality, of stately grandeur and tranquility."

This lack of physical variety causes the eye to skim the canvas, for no one figure pulls attention from another. Their robes dissolve into the fabric of the background, creating an expansive study of drapery and its physical idiosyncrasies.

Yet this is the first thing that's made me stop my incessant scrolling down on my feed. It actually made me stop and think.  Where is the light coming from? Is the light shining down and woman is looking down to see what it's shining on, or is the light shining from the woman.   What is down below? what's the look on her face? Is it scornful, or a look embracing beauty? Is it the look of someone awaiting a loved one, or the look of seeing a loved one return?   There's literally nothing else in the painting other than bleakness. Surely that indicates that she is radiating the light. Is it her own beauty, or is she radiating the beauty of a loved one?  I have literally never felt this way about art before. Maybe I'm just drunk, or maybe this is just beautiful. Or maybe it's both."

Several months later, LOOK Magazine commissioned an investigative article about the incident entitled “Southern Justice,” and painter Norman Rockwell was asked to provide an illustration for the article. Over the course of five weeks, Rockwell intensively studied the circumstances of the murders, made many preliminary drawings, photographs, a preparatory oil sketch, and the finished painting entitled Murder in Mississippi.    Here is a wikipedia page about the murders.   If you search the Norman Rockwell Museum digital collection for ""Murder in Mississippi"", you can also see lots of photos and documentation about the commissioning of this piece. http://collections.nrm.org/highlights.page.do"

My understanding is that it's meant to mean the canvas took 11 years to complete from the first marks laid down on it to its finished state, but when you consider the fact that he wasn't continuously working on it for 11 years, this number kind of loses its meaning.  He was prolific and produced a huge number of works between 1880 and 1891, including other large-scale historical epics and some of his best-known works like Ivan holding his son and ""They Did Not Expect Him"" (the tense painting of the dude returning to his home and family).  ANYWAY, my point is I would love to actually get a realistic breakdown of how much time was spent on the painting.  Obviously he would have had to do numerous sketches, clothing studies, color sketches, etc, but I still don't see this work taking much longer than any of this other massive canvases of historical paintings.  I guess it just sounds cool to say it took 11 years."

ArtPorn,33p2kk,bukster,4,Fri Apr 24 09:59:10 2015 UTC,If you saw this in a show of contemporary landscape painting it wouldn't stand out as being old at all. His paintings really have a weird modernism too them. No one can be fucking 400 years ahead of their time.
ArtPorn,33p2kk,insoundfromwayout,2,Fri Apr 24 16:55:21 2015 UTC,Greco adopted the venetians use of color combined with the exaggerated perspective of the Cretan school. The result was the most idiosyncratic painter of the Spanish renaissance.  I always loved his skies and the modeling of the faces and the hands.
ArtPorn,33p2kk,LucretiusCarus,4,Fri Apr 24 19:03:50 2015 UTC,I was fascinated by this painting as a young man and I was never completely sure why. I can rest happy I got to see it in real life when it came to London in 2004.

ArtPorn,33dnp7,wintervenom123,3,Tue Apr 21 17:58:26 2015 UTC,"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_m%C3%A5lare   Virtually nothing is known of the life and work of Urban målare. He is traditionally attributed the original version of the painting Vädersolstavlan, today well-known through the 1630s copy hanging in the Stockholm Cathedral. The painting is depicting a halo or sun dog display over Stockholm in 1535 and is often mentioned as the oldest topographically correct view of the Swedish capital. As the painting is generally associated with the Danube School, it is possible Urban målare got his education in Germany. Similarly, he is often attributed the painting Arvstavlan.   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_dogs   Sun dogs are commonly caused by the refraction of light from plate-shaped hexagonal ice crystals either in high and cold cirrus or cirrostratus clouds or, during very cold weather, drifting in the air at low levels, in which case they are called diamond dust.[4] The crystals act as prisms, bending the light rays passing through them with a minimum deflection of 22°. As the crystals gently float downwards with their large hexagonal faces almost horizontal, sunlight is refracted horizontally, and sun dogs are seen to the left and right of the Sun. Larger plates wobble more, and thus produce taller sundogs.[5]"

ArtPorn,3369tv,RubensAss,18,Sun Apr 19 23:09:34 2015 UTC,"It's theorized that the piece was made for a wedding, with the unicorn chained to the pomegranate tree representing the husband who has finally been tamed by a virgin (the only person who can tame a unicorn). The pomegranate juice on the unicorn's body and its seeds represent fertility. The AE insignia in the middle and the four corners have been theorized to be attributed to Anne of Britanny.   If seeing this in person, I highly recommend the audio tour. The whole series pays homage to the mythical unicorn, and the hunt can be interpreted as the story of Jesus Christ. It's about a group of aristocrats who go on a hunt for a unicorn, find it, stab it to death, and brought a virgin in to tame it. Then the unicorn miraculously reincarnates and is just chilling in this circular fence which you see in this tapestry. Fun fact: the tapestries were largely lost during the French Revolution and one of the members of the La Rochefoucauld family who owned the tapestries found a farmer using it to cover potatoes. Fun fact: over a hundred plant species in the tapestry series, only 85% have been identified."

One woman hunches over her knees, keeping them bent as if to take the strain off her back. The other's shoulder pushes up, as if she's trying to brace herself on her knee as she lifts an object off the ground. The painting is imbued with the feelings and impressions of the end of a long, hot day of hard work. It communicates all of this so well with broad, painterly strokes. Good stuff."

He created hundreds of prints during his lifetime, primarily during the 1920s-1940s. You can see thousands of examples of his work here: http://ukiyo-e.org/artist/kawase-hasui  If you like pieces like this you may also like works by Yoshida Hiroshi: http://ukiyo-e.org/artist/yoshida-hiroshi  Or works by Tsuchiya Koitsu: http://ukiyo-e.org/artist/tsuchiya-koitsu  They're all from roughly the same time period - an era in which Japanese artists were starting to re-claim some of the traditional Japanese arts that had become passé once Japan adopted western culture (frequently referred to as ""shin hanga"").

ArtPorn,32jox8,Dunavks,3,Tue Apr 14 15:29:56 2015 UTC,"""ukiyo-e"" (pictures of the floating world) is generally used for this art form, in general, however that's a bit of a misnomer and generally refers to prints from the late 1600s to the late 1800s. This generally includes depictions of kabuki actors and courtesans. That being said searching for ""ukiyo-e"" will generally bring up all Japanese prints.  I started a sub-reddit for this a while back but I've been terrible at actually updating it: https://www.reddit.com/r/ukiyoe  If anyone is interested in submitting works or helping out in anyway, let me know! I also built the site: http://ukiyo-e.org/ to help people find works of this art form, pulled from major museums, universities, and libraries. It should help you to find all sorts of different styles and subject matter!"
