We were all part of a thing; a thing was was remarkable and held so much promise for so many people for what seemed like an eternity then it vanished. We built our own community. Now we can say, ""Fuck yeah, I was there. I pressed/didn't press/couldn't press that button, and it was the best/worst/most meaningless experience I've had."" And as we pass each other we can share a nod of acknowledgement that we recognize a fellow Buttoner. That for a time, we were one. Then we'll go on our way like ships passing in the night."

I'm mean I'm all for this personally, can't say no to a trophy.  I'm wondering whether the number would be shown or just the colour, and if cheaters (or errors as I'd prefer to call them since it wasn't really possible to cheat) would be distinguished from purples. Also whether non-pressers or can't pressers would get a trophy, they didn't press the button but did at least comment or post in the subreddit. I think they should."

ButtonAftermath,3d29zc,StigDoesntFart,0,Thu Jul 16 04:09:51 2015 UTC,"It was a waste because in the end I thought that something good would come from it. I spend 3 months of my life, 3 months that I will never get back, watching a timer. I did this based on the assumption that at the end of all of it I would have something to remember it by. Orangered and Periwinkle wasted a day. We wasted 3 months. I don't see why we can't have trophies."

It was deliberate decision that we never stated what would happen at the end of the button's life, even though the answer was always 'nothing will happen'.

I get your reasons, but why wouldn't you want something to commemorate the event? The gloriousness of The Button could last for years past its conception, and the faction superiority complexes being brought up once in awhile would be fun. I hope you reconsider, if any event deserves a trophy, it's this one. Don't let it be forgotten."

ButtonAftermath,3c74x0,Too_MuchWhiskey,2,Mon Jul 6 10:09:13 2015 UTC,There are actually 2. Only one made a post to the sub and made it into the catalog. I believe the user name /u/g123456 was an alt used by /u/makuio or /u/powerlan while testing their cheater/error flair theory.  Edit: Looks like it belongs to /u/makuio https://www.reddit.com/r/thebutton/comments/34f46v/anyone_know_how_to_get_0s/cre7046. I still think powerlan is his too.

It is quite possible the first 6s also belongs to /u/makuio from his early attempts at discovering how cheater flairs times are determined.

Personally speaking, while I support the actions of the mods of the default subs and their goal of getting better communication and support from the admins, I don't think going private here will affect much of anything.  We're a very small sub that rarely has even 20 people visiting at any given time.  If we joined in the protest, it would be purely symbolic given our low activity level.  I think there are probably better ways to show our support that would have more of an effect."

From time-to-time, when I see button flair on someone in another subreddit, I'll look into their buttoning comments.   After I have completed a thread, I hide it. Occasionally I'll undo that.   Do you read the threads?   All of them, some of them twice. I also lurk in many of the related subreddits.   Do you still vote on stuff you haven't seen before?    I won't rest until the only comments I haven't voted on come from firm ambivalence.   Is there stuff you haven't seen before?   Yes.    When do you think you'll finally let go?   When I saw /r/thebutton and its subreddit, I realized a huge number of things right away. It was a catalyst to a shift in my thinking on social networks, community, politics, peer pressure, hate, faith, gaming, culture, media, and more. As /r/thebutton unfolded, I began to see my views on much of the world and my place in it evolving. I'll confess that for a stretch after the button hit zero that I was a bit despondent, but I snapped out of it and have redoubled my efforts at self improvement.  I might, but I hope /r/thebutton will be with me forever.  Edit: I also occasionally edit comments I made in /r/thebutton from a few of my accounts."

ButtonAftermath,3bij8n,Modern_Robot,2,Tue Jun 30 16:27:01 2015 UTC,How about I hold a referendum and see what the delegates have to say?
ButtonAftermath,3bjyey,StoodieDain,3,Mon Jun 29 20:57:33 2015 UTC,"First of all: I don't know how the timer in this sub was done. I guess that it works using CSS3 animations.  This means, that in theory it would be possible to playback all of the presses by creating a really long CCS animation.  The problem with this is that the CSS file would probably be multiple gigabytes big. That's a lot more than the reddit CSS character limit.  This means it would not be possible to do on reddit."
ButtonAftermath,3bjyey,freundTech,2,Mon Jun 29 21:36:15 2015 UTC,Could you maybe just have it click at a semi-random time based on the percentage each second was pressed? Not sure if that makes it any easier.
ButtonAftermath,3bjyey,Zanthr,1 point,Mon Jun 29 23:26:23 2015 UTC,"Not really sure what you mean, but the button press right now is at ""semi-random"" time."
ButtonAftermath,3bjyey,gamehelp16,2,Tue Jun 30 04:42:24 2015 UTC,"Never seen it go below 31. I'll admit I've had a fairly limited experience, but 10 minutes straight is about all I could handle. Not only that, it's more often than not either a Green or Blue press. That's fairly ordered for semi-random, unless there's some sort of system I'm missing out on."
ButtonAftermath,3bjyey,Zanthr,1 point,Tue Jun 30 04:49:45 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the timer stops at 5 different times and loops, the reason for this is because each loop had 100 seconds and 5 times of reset adds up to 100 seconds (I hope I explain it well), and the reason I don't make it under 30 is because I need to do an extra (and maybe not easy) effort to make the pie timer being able to show < 30 seconds."
ButtonAftermath,3bjyey,gamehelp16,2,Tue Jun 30 04:59:37 2015 UTC,"It would be nice if you did, but I understand the work it would involve, so okay, I guess."
ButtonAftermath,3bjyey,Zanthr,2,Tue Jun 30 05:02:33 2015 UTC,"Just a little over 1 million numbers, 1 to 2 digits each shouldn't be a gigabyte should it? Correct me if I am wrong but isn't 1 gig = 1 billion bytes? Even at 2 characters per press, that is still a little over 2 million characters. A single number character doesn't require more than 1 byte does it?"
ButtonAftermath,3bjyey,h3ph43s7u5,2,Tue Jun 30 00:26:12 2015 UTC,"It's not as simple as having just the time the next press was at, it would be a lot more complicated and have a lot more data than that."
ButtonAftermath,3bjyey,gamehelp16,1 point,Tue Jun 30 01:17:24 2015 UTC,"Animating the timer is not as easy as putting some numbers, it works like the combination lock in luggages, there are 10 numbers but one is visible at a time, and I animate the ""rotation"" so the number changes."
ButtonAftermath,3bjyey,Stendarpaval,2,Tue Jun 30 04:44:21 2015 UTC,"We could fit a function to the original data and add some noise to it. Then you wouldn't need the data, just the function and the time between now and the start of the button."

ButtonAftermath,3bijjx,MissLauralot,1 point,Mon Jun 29 14:46:29 2015 UTC,Keep monitoring this. It'll be kind of cool to see if our slow decent into the forgotten realms matches an exponential curve. ;)

ButtonAftermath,3bg7h2,Kazuke86,1 point,Mon Jun 29 11:34:36 2015 UTC,"I agree that he needed help, but there are ways and means.  I was trying to get him to volunteer to go into hospital and if he had it would have been closer and more open to visitors, and he was already at 'stage 2' in counselling and was discussing voluntary hospital treatment with his counselor as well.  Then, well things went bad one night and I had to call the police for my sons safety (he ran away with a knife), and his Dad just sort of 'took over' .  As I said, ways and means,and I believe co operating with the treatment is more important than being forced into it. . Again, I may be wrong, but his Dad could have at least discussed it for a couple of minutes  EDIT: I promised myself I wouldn't do this, but it will help explain what I feel about his father.  I tried to stop my son leaving that night and as a result, had 4 broken fingers from my left m hand being slammed in a hardwood door, The police offered an ambulance for me and my son after they found him ( He had cut himself).   His father went in the ambulance with my son to the local Hospital, but refused me entry, explaining to his fellow officers I was making it all up .....¬£45 taxi drive later I was in the same hospital, with 4 broken fingers...

So I joined the Violet Hand to promote people to press early and not draw it out for years. That became a game on its own, even though my suspicion grew that nothing would happen in the end. I still think that there should have been a longer period after the button ended to comment, as I'd love to have participated in it, but alas.   Now the button is fading from my mind, but I'll never forget the faction skirmishes and propaganda plastered over /r/thebutton, and of course my fellow purple brothers.   The Hand has Risen."
ButtonAftermath,3bdyks,Stendarpaval,3,Sun Jun 28 12:03:39 2015 UTC,Looking at the lock I thought it was the meaning for everyone to guard the button by re-locking the lock every second or so. When the lock disappeared I though people let their guard down and I quickly pressed it :)

ButtonAftermath,3bdyks,johnny_moronic,1 point,Sun Jun 28 21:41:42 2015 UTC,"Very satisfied. I debated as I watched the button get lower and lower each day. 42 was calling me but the day I was going to press was the same day the 42 flair became the ""hip"" flair. I couldn't go with the masses. One day 12 was calling me. This was days after the lowest red flairs had been given out. Lastly it also makes me smile that many likely thought I was a fool going for red but pressing too early because of the rounding. Yet 12 was my intention and I was very satisfied to get the number I wanted, no, needed."
ButtonAftermath,3bdyks,smokecess,1 point,Sun Jun 28 22:02:07 2015 UTC,"Initially, yes. I had a vague understanding of what the button was when I pressed, because I'd seen a news story about it when it came out. I knew I only had one press. I also knew I had to press it. I unlocked it, and without any thought, I instantly pressed it without looking at the timer or anything. I'm still not sure why, I guess I was over-excited by having a button to press.  When I saw my flair, I had a moment of regret because I felt I should have tried to get a lower number and had wasted my press. This was short-lived, however. 23 is actually a very special number for me, and it's fantastic that I got it by accident. Also, I live the colour yellow :) End result, I love my flair!"

ButtonAftermath,3bdyks,tetelesti,1 point,Tue Jun 30 12:22:46 2015 UTC,"I am, although I have to say it was a hard choice. At first I thought I would never press, in a show of resistance. Then I thought about pressing, because I didn't like the ""shade"" thing. Then I realized I could opt out of flair, and did so for a while, coming across the Blankness. This appealed to me because I wanted the flair class system to end. But I was still unsatisfied. No flair, sure, but still a non-presser.  I decided to press. But couldn't decide if I wanted red, for Communism, or 42, because it's 42. At the time, the time was reaching red numbers, but the button was always immediately reset at 10s or so. This was when all the 11s happened. So even though I wanted red a bit more, I chose 42. It was one of the easiest numbers to get. (I didn't want to risk getting 60s and therefore neither of the things I wanted) So I got it. Literally 2 hours later, the Hitchhiker Exodus began. Sometimes I like to think I caused it.  And so, 42s. Sometimes I wish I could be red, but at the same time, choosing a number instead of a color seems like a good decision. I'd still be flairless, but dammit I love 42.  and damn I just wrote a few paragraphs about my experience with a button WHAT HAS MY LIFE COME TO"

Not one of the first....I wanted to be sure, so I wasn't aiming for a place in the catalog.  Why?  Lots of really shitty things happen to me when there is a 4 involved, For example my mother was buried on my 44th birthday.  So I wanted to break the cycle of bad 4's and get a good 4.  I waited and planned. I used squire only to check I had no lag on the button timer, and then one Sunday, I thought 'This is the day'.  I switched off all distractions, walked the dogs until there was no chance of them shitting for at least 24 hrs and sat down 6 am UTC (the time when least pressers were available)....I mean I was up at 5 am on a SUNDAY!! to walk the dogs and at my post at 7 am local time (sacrifices were made)  10 am I pressed......I was shaking(probably due to excess caffeine?) and dancing around, and being an idiot on /r/thebutton commenting in every post I could find to show of my bright shiny, big assed 4s flair  Epic  EDIT I still grin like a loon remembering it"

I'm not one to rush into things at all, so since we had pretty much no clue what was going on, I didn't want to risk anything. Gray was safe (even though I was tempted to press to have a purple flair, since purple was my favorite color.)  But as factions began to form and new colors were revealed, I started to really dislike some of the rhetoric coming from some of the grays. (Emphasis on ""some."") It'll probably sound ridiculous to those who weren't a part of all of this madness, but flairs were (and to some extent still are) very important in how you were perceived.  I thought about becoming a Knight or a Redguard, but I had a feeling that red would be the purple of the pressers who weren't purple.  A couple weeks into it, I had a dream about the Button. (Clearly my life had been hijacked.) In it, the Button ran out. I was still a gray, and very disappointed that my chance to press had vanished.  I took that day to choose the color I would be, and the day after that, I pressed.  For some reason, I really like the number four. So 40 was the best choice. I loved the creed of the Emerald Council, and that everyone is welcomed there regardless of flair color.  tl;dr: I think green has replaced purple as my favorite color."

Near the end, I started to worry a bit that I might log on and find that I had missed my opportunity to press altogether.    About a week or so before the end, I woke up around 3 am to give my daughter a bottle, and decided to go downstairs and check the button snitch.  To my surprise, the first countdown I watched made it all the way to zero, and I decided that the time had finally come for me to click.  Also to my surprise, I only had to watch the clock for about 7 minutes before I got my 0s flair.  What I felt after finally pressing the button? After all those weeks of watching and reading and wondering, I felt relieved and content.  The next week when I sat down for dinner with my family, then came back to the computer to find that not only had I missed the end of the button, but also the opportunity to post anything in the last 10 minutes? Total disbelief that I completely missed the end, 10 feet away from my screen.  Annoyance at why and how it ended.  And sadness that something that had become such a regular part of my routine was suddenly yanked away.  Oh well.  I spent a day or two visiting the button after that out of habit, and even spent some time watching the coup/hostile takeover of some of the factions' pages by the chaos legion.  Then I just let it all go and went on with life as usual.    Until today.  When I randomly decided to check out /r/thebutton. And I found this sub."
ButtonAftermath,3bc334,dujayy,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:34:10 2015 UTC,"I have a 60s flair. When I found out about the button I didn't know how it actually worked. So I took the safety off (unsheathed it) and then proceeded to shoot myself in the face (pressed it).   It was a mistake. At first I felt so bad, then embarrassed and then really angry. Everybody treated purples very shitty and still does. After awhile when the low flairs started showing up en masse I got over my anger and I'm a happy purple now."
ButtonAftermath,3bc334,ChiefKickingAss,1 point,Sat Jun 27 22:59:54 2015 UTC,"Back in the days of the Button, I was a grey.  Simply because I didn't know what color I wanted.  I found the page on the 1st and just didn't care enough to do any real research on it and so let it pass by.  Eventually I saw the religion form and then I was watching the Button for a good time.  Like everyone else.  But I was torn.  My favorite color is purple.  But purple was the laughing stock.  The scrubs.  The oppressed.  At at least in my eyes.  So my next favorite color is blue.  But the big thing at that point was red.  So i sat there.  DO I want a red and be cool and show my skill at clicking a button at a certain time?  Or do I want my favorite color?  Well as I thought about it, the experiment ended.  So I ended as a grey.  Which is also one of my favorite colors.  But I changed it on this sub simply because I thought the blue they used was pretty..."

Over time, my opinion changed. I didn't want the button to pass by and be lumped in with the thousands of other users who commented in /r/thebutton once and then forget about it. I didn't want to wonder what it would have been like to press. I wanted to control my own destiny. So I clicked at 10s."

I'm not the type of person to do things on a whim, everything I do is highly calculated before I make a decision. Not always the right design, but I digress.  Came in, saw button, read the rules and figured that more people would press the button than not. Well, more people that were aware/interested in the button. We had a choice, press or don't. The flairs were an incentive to push, but at the end of the day, they all are worth only what we determine.   Also, could be argued that I'm just stubborn."

I dont think ill ever find out why.

Site:  When you press the button it resets the timer back to 60. Your Ip address is logged and you are prompted to enter a name. This name appears on the leader-board with the corresponding flair color and time to when you pressed.  When you toggle the switch it does not reset the timer. Your Ip address is logged and you are prompted to enter a name. This name appears on the leader-board with the corresponding flair color and time to when you toggled.  There are two leader-boards, one for the pressers and one for the togglers. The leader-boards track recent and notable presses and toggles. (Notable being when one moves from one board to the other.) They also track total Presses vs. Total Toggles.   This Could be Very fun!"

Then people realised they should band together and subs were formed. Of course, I'm a white-flair who joined in May so don't trust me to be accurate."
ButtonAftermath,3b0jxy,MissLauralot,3,Thu Jun 25 07:28:22 2015 UTC,This is not a black and white world.    Correct! It's a gray/grey and purple and blue and green and yellow and orange and red world.
ButtonAftermath,3b0jxy,Thunderwing-Rynn,1 point,Thu Jun 25 22:01:45 2015 UTC,"A lot of the religious debates were actually about important things when you removed the button from them. I think, whether consciously or not, a lot of us were using it as a way to talk about these things without all of the stress or conflict that comes with talking about them normally. But, of course, this is just my theory on it."
ButtonAftermath,3b0jxy,Thunderwing-Rynn,2,Thu Jun 25 12:56:26 2015 UTC,"Oh, believe me, there was a lot of stress and conflict. The various gray/grey groups got very up in arms against anyone who'd pressed the button. Even by accident."
ButtonAftermath,3b0jxy,tetelesti,1 point,Thu Jun 25 16:26:14 2015 UTC,"Oh, I know that much. But it was definitely less conflict for everyone to get into a ""war"" discussing whether we should press a button than for everyone to have the same discussion without the button about the implications of self-indulgence, lack of self-control, elitism, and the futility of, or perhaps honor in, delaying the inevitable.   So, yes, there was stress and conflict, but it was done in more of a ""mock"" or role playing manner in the majority of cases, I think. That, for me at least, was what made it bearable and at times even enjoyable."

ButtonAftermath,3axwwo,tendeuchen,6,Wed Jun 24 21:59:30 2015 UTC,they were not all aware of the button.   Syntax.
ButtonAftermath,3axwwo,Jonny_Segment,2,Wed Jun 24 14:36:15 2015 UTC,"If one can say you all, one can surely say they all.   Compare: They all were here. They were all here. They all could come. They could all come. They all wanted to come. *They wanted all to come.   In the last example, the meaning is different and means 'They wanted everyone to come.'  So as you can see from the above, 'all' can only be moved to after a copula or a modal verb, but it can also occur before them. With 'regular' verbs, the 'all' must occur before the verb.   In Syntax, this type of movement is known as ""quantifier float(ing)."""
ButtonAftermath,3axwwo,ikar100,2,Wed Jun 24 19:30:21 2015 UTC,"Oh, yes, quite true. I only meant to say that   they were all not aware of the button   means something different from   they were not all aware of the button   and I think OP meant the latter."

ButtonAftermath,3aubsq,whizzer0,6,Tue Jun 23 17:10:33 2015 UTC,"There were more than seven uses on the first day. For some reason Google only gave you results that were either commented on or voted up. Here is an example of a post that did not get voted up or commented on from April 1st that did not show up in your Google search. I found this by searching with Reddit's own search function with filthy presser in quotes in the search. Oddly enough, Reddit will filter results by ""newest"" but not by ""oldest""."

He just realized that people would be engaged because of the mystery, and thought, why the hell not.  So for all the questions like ""when did you think of it"", ""what inspired the idea"" and so on - sure, he can answer that, but a lot of people are going to want an explanation and closure, and he can't give them that because the button was not conceived with either of those things in mind.

Families uprooted. My best friend became orangered... I killed him on that Field. I chanted the war cry as I crushed his skull ""Better dead than Orangered."" I had to or he'd have killed me all the same.  Why is this sub dying? Because its a bunch of whiners asking for ""Trophies"" and ""Medals"" and ""Flair"".

ButtonAftermath,3a7nt6,mncke,5,Thu Jun 18 04:34:38 2015 UTC,Uh...what the fuck?
ButtonAftermath,3a7nt6,Saphazure,2,Thu Jun 18 00:56:39 2015 UTC,/u/powerlanguage Bumping: is there a way to split the flair breakdown out as a distinct extension that could be hosted elsewhere? /u/mncke Whatcha think?
ButtonAftermath,3a7nt6,cxseven,2,Thu Jun 18 00:10:09 2015 UTC,"I agree with /u/powerlanguage. The button is over, and bringing back the flair breakdown which was a part of the plugin while possible still means engineering work for something there is almost no demand for."

ButtonAftermath,3a7nt6,Master_Sparky,4,Thu Jun 18 01:27:01 2015 UTC,Ooh. It might have been possible to submit presses.
ButtonAftermath,3a7nt6,Master_Sparky,3,Thu Jun 18 03:27:04 2015 UTC,Mine is still counting down. I have experimented with this a little bit. The Button Monitor loops 60-54 when there is no internet connection or it otherwise cannot access the timer count.
ButtonAftermath,3a66rw,Master_Sparky,37,Wed Jun 17 15:21:28 2015 UTC,"I think it's the lack of new content. A lot of the content on /r/thebutton was centered around the button and it's data. Now that the button is done and there's no new data to analyze, we're short on content."

Having said that, its rare to see over 30 people here  I did a quick survey of a few other button subs this time yesterday  Hitchikers, 59's 5 each  most populated subs were here (25) followed by Knights (10) and Emerald council 6 all the rest only had 1, 2 or 3 reading  NOW that's sad"
ButtonAftermath,39zjd9,britishteacher,1 point,Tue Jun 16 16:52:06 2015 UTC,"A lot of those were alts or ""press and forget"" people though."
ButtonAftermath,39zjd9,shh_coffee,0,Tue Jun 16 05:53:03 2015 UTC,I still think the ending was bogus. They decided that they were tired of malfunctions and they were just gonna call this one real.
ButtonAftermath,39zjd9,LiirFlies,8,Tue Jun 16 01:59:05 2015 UTC,"Well it did end a little unexpectedly, but I've read that it ended because the zombie asked to press The Button turned out to be a can't presser."
ButtonAftermath,39zjd9,rubysapphireemerald,5,Tue Jun 16 02:10:35 2015 UTC,"It didn't malfunction. There would have been a shitstorm of ""I PRESSED AND IT DIDNT GO THROUGH"" if that were the case. Remember, all it takes is one minute - one odd moment - to kill the Button. Normally, we would have zombie pressers for that, but since /u/StilesBC couldn't press, it ended up failing."
ButtonAftermath,39zjd9,Master_Sparky,2,Tue Jun 16 02:18:59 2015 UTC,The redguard was had! I was a gray to the end but I wasn't ready for the end.
ButtonAftermath,39zjd9,LiirFlies,3,Tue Jun 16 02:27:20 2015 UTC,Don't worry. I hear they're going to include an alternate ending on the DVD release
ButtonAftermath,39zjd9,CapnStabby,1 point,Tue Jun 16 16:28:46 2015 UTC,Hah! Alternate ending: The Ronin commit seppuku instead of pressing and are once again embraced as honorable by society.

ButtonAftermath,39xgd3,asde,10,Mon Jun 15 16:22:03 2015 UTC,The button's a 59s.
ButtonAftermath,39xgd3,Suzystar3,4,Mon Jun 15 17:22:21 2015 UTC,It's because the button is a stylized sticky post. If you turn CSS off you see it. So I guess the karmancer extension forces the post author to show its flair.
ButtonAftermath,39xgd3,Zezombye,6,Mon Jun 15 16:56:02 2015 UTC,Can you link to the post itself?
ButtonAftermath,39xgd3,Nitroserum,3,Mon Jun 15 19:51:12 2015 UTC,"Here. It's the only thing that shows up stickied when CSS is off, so."
ButtonAftermath,39xgd3,TOOCGamer,2,Mon Jun 15 20:47:37 2015 UTC,It all makes sense...Wicro is a 59s and also is my 'friend' and the fake button has both tags for me.  The fake button is /u/wicro weirdly
ButtonAftermath,39xgd3,britishteacher,3,Mon Jun 15 21:09:40 2015 UTC,If you inspect the button element you will see that wicro is the author of that element and his name is hidden in the element. Karmancer is picking up on that and displaying his flair. Its actually a 59s Cheater Flair. Wicro was a first day presser. :)
ButtonAftermath,39xgd3,Too_MuchWhiskey,3,Tue Jun 16 01:57:01 2015 UTC,"wait, I was a cheater?"
ButtonAftermath,39xgd3,wicro,3,Tue Jun 16 12:40:08 2015 UTC,"Well, you were a first day presser right? :)  In the first minute of button operation, 1157 59s cheater flairs were issued. The button was recording presses at up to 55 per second! 124755 Cheater flairs issued on day 1. If every press was 1 per second thats ~35 hours of pressing in ~14 hours."
ButtonAftermath,39xgd3,Too_MuchWhiskey,3,Tue Jun 16 15:10:08 2015 UTC,"Yep, I pressed in the first 3 or so minutes of the button."
ButtonAftermath,39xgd3,wicro,2,Tue Jun 16 15:30:45 2015 UTC,"127068 total 59s cheater flairs issued, 123871 on the first day. Makes me wonder; if they had not been cheater flairs would they be regular 59s?"
ButtonAftermath,39xgd3,Too_MuchWhiskey,2,Tue Jun 16 16:58:18 2015 UTC,"Click on flair, inspect element.... You are a Cheater. Confirmed (thank you Karmancer)"

ButtonAftermath,39xgd3,wicro,2,Tue Jun 16 20:04:17 2015 UTC,It also (on the round timer) tells me it is my friend?!
ButtonAftermath,39xgd3,britishteacher,1 point,Mon Jun 15 18:38:13 2015 UTC,"Maybe I will fix it later, because I'm not a karmancer user."

ButtonAftermath,39xgd3,BlupHox,-1,Tue Jun 16 14:39:12 2015 UTC,So realistic.  All of those purples just ran into then button whenever the fuck they wanted...
ButtonAftermath,39zs41,ArchCrono,1 point,Tue Jun 16 02:49:03 2015 UTC,"Probably not. I'm guessing that there is some code on the back end that is preventing any button presses after the end. Also there is stuff on the backend on rules for previous pressers, can't pressers and so on. The Javascript is not the only part of the code involved. Someone would have to replicate the back end that we don't have access to and point it to a separate database that they control on a different server which wouldn't have access to any of the information reddit has on users. It could be done, but it wouldn't be as simple as just copying it and putting it somewhere else. It would be a new button somewhere else. It wouldn't be the same."
ButtonAftermath,39zs41,CheckYourCommit,5,Tue Jun 16 13:15:42 2015 UTC,"Its simple, we have the fake button so all we need to do is infiltrate Reddit, take control of their servers (cassandra in particular) and voila, we would have the button back  So any problems with the plan?"
ButtonAftermath,39zs41,britishteacher,2,Tue Jun 16 21:50:45 2015 UTC,"Sounds good, know any Reddit Devs we can bribe?"

ButtonAftermath,39u4dv,PineappleKeeper,7,Sun Jun 14 23:56:28 2015 UTC,"Aww, thanks you guys. :D"
ButtonAftermath,39u4dv,greenteasoda,6,Mon Jun 15 05:29:58 2015 UTC,Indeed. Look at all the button subs that tried to get started in the first days of the After Timer. /r/postbutton and /r/buttonaftermath seemed to capture most of the users (the few others I had marked have since disappeared). This sub is relatively active and the excellent may be part of that.
ButtonAftermath,39u4dv,Master_Sparky,5,Mon Jun 15 00:10:18 2015 UTC,As the maker of /r/postbutton I knew I was fucked when I saw that logo! lol
ButtonAftermath,39u4dv,Master_Sparky,2,Mon Jun 15 00:24:00 2015 UTC,It all sorted itself out really fast. I was hoping for some diversity for new after timer subs.
ButtonAftermath,39u4dv,thislooksprettyfun,2,Mon Jun 15 01:48:19 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I think it's better to just have one sub, otherwise it would be too mixed up. There are still all the faction subs though."

ButtonAftermath,39v4zk,LondonNoodles,1 point,Mon Jun 15 16:28:34 2015 UTC,"Well, I could tell you, but what would be the fun of that???  ...  Ok ok, there are more important things than fun I guess.  Sometimes.  And I did forgot to add a TL;DR for those out of the loop:  Right after Reddit showed off how a single button (the Button) with a single press (or even NONE) could burst our collective mind into creative Valhalla, along comes Valve with a quite similar idea (press to keep the experiment alive), except this one is designed to zombify you until you're ready to throw your wallet at either Gabe, or his boss, zombie Ron Hubbard.  Is that any better?"
ButtonAftermath,39v4zk,autowikibot,1 point,Mon Jun 15 21:40:08 2015 UTC,"The Button (Reddit):       The Button was the name of a meta-game and a social experiment started on the website Reddit that was active between April 1st and June 5th 2015. The game was started by a Reddit administrator on April the 1st and was thought by many to be an April Fools' joke for 2015.  It garnered enthusiasm from Reddit users worldwide.  The game had its own subbreddit, an entry and a subpage devoted to it. On the specific subreddit for thebutton visitors were greeted with the normal Reddit subreddit style look but with a molly-guarded button next to a clock and a 60-second countdown timer that would reset whenever the button was clicked by a Reddit user.  The only accounts that could click the button were those created before the event started. The button could only be pressed once by each account holder.  There was also a count of every independent user who had clicked the button at any time since its launch.  All users had a small dot next to their username. Users who had not pressed the button had a gray dot, and users who had pressed had a dot colored based on the state of the timer when the button was pressed.

ButtonAftermath,39xk2h,FancySloth,1 point,Mon Jun 15 17:02:44 2015 UTC,So why do they hate purple the most? Purples pressed at the least possible time so that the button ended sooner. Why do they hate us?
ButtonAftermath,39xk2h,Zezombye,1 point,Tue Jun 16 22:00:22 2015 UTC,Because nobody forced you to press. Extending the button by 1 second is still extending it.

It is a misunderstanding that pressing makes one impure as we were always pure or impure, but the Button revealed to us our true nature in the form of the flair.

I clicked edit flair, choose the orange 17, and then that's my flair.  Since the bot I see a lot of colored dots but nobody seems to have numbers in it.  I saw rules posted regarding how to PM the bot and it seemed much harder than just clicking orange 17 like I did.  much love to wicro for all his many efforts and button related passions, which has made the buttonverse a much funner place, just my 0.02 regarding the flairs"
ButtonAftermath,39iq8k,feelingsofwhite,5,Fri Jun 12 13:28:15 2015 UTC,"I just kept mine from the before-bot time.  The bot was all like ""yo, I see you're 'new,' allow me to present a complicated method of getting the flair you already have.""  And I was all like, ""you know, I'll pass, bot.  That sounds like presser skullduggery to me.  Plus, you're newer than me.""  Also, I never edit my comments."
ButtonAftermath,39iq8k,Mestherion,3,Fri Jun 12 00:37:45 2015 UTC,I accidentally removed mine. Plus there are a bunch of new users with just empty colored dots.

ButtonAftermath,39i92d,Theowoll,1 point,Fri Jun 12 10:21:55 2015 UTC,No averaging.
ButtonAftermath,39i92d,Theowoll,1 point,Fri Jun 12 12:29:39 2015 UTC,"Oh, I wasn't looking carefully enough. Also, your time zone is probably around UTC+02:00. I was looking at the data using UTC-04:00, almost all non-regular presses (black line) happened on 4/25 for that time zone. The clearly visible increase of activity for ~10 hours on 4/25 right after the Cassandra incident is solely caused by automatic presses."

ButtonAftermath,39hgr3,Suzystar3,2,Thu Jun 11 21:02:36 2015 UTC,Purple is my favorite color. I want that 42s cheater flair I can live with it.
ButtonAftermath,39hgr3,TOOCGamer,1 point,Fri Jun 12 06:46:22 2015 UTC,"Purple is an awesome colour. I pressed for it, although not for a low flair. It has a certain pull to it for me. It's a fantastic flair. Let's wear it proudly!"

ButtonAftermath,39h4dr,Too_MuchWhiskey,1 point,Thu Jun 11 18:34:57 2015 UTC,"Oh sure, I use Firefox and the Stylish plugin. After you add Stylish, use the Add-on manager under Tools and select user styles, write new style, then paste this in there and save it.  .flair-cheater{ color: #ff0000; background: #000000; }       This is how it was given to me. Don't know enough about scripts to know if the formatting is important or if it can all be one line. I changed color from #000000 (black) to #ff0000 (red) and it makes the text red then it changes to white on hover. Works with Karmancer too!"

Well the Button was reddits April Fools joke and it has a huge history. 59 is one of the flairs you get when you push the button.   Go to /r/thebutton and read the wiki. Or just google it.

ButtonAftermath,39ewrm,MiggsBoson,2,Thu Jun 11 16:18:45 2015 UTC,"The Button was an amazing time in reddit's history. You are wise to come here for explanation.  On April 1, 2015, /r/thebutton became live. We had the option: to press it, or not to press it. Each eligible account (accounts created before April 1) had exactly one press available to them.  The Button was linked to a timer of 60 seconds. When anyone pressed, it was reset and started counting down again. So if you see a 59s, that means they pressed when the timer had 59 seconds left to go.  Purples are those who pressed between 60s and 52s.  Blue: 51s-42s  Green: 41s-32s  Yellow: 31s-22s  Orange: 21s-12s  Red: 11s-0s  Grey: non pressers (people who had the chance to press, but did not)  Silver / White: can't pressers (people who couldn't press because their accounts are too young)  As you get to know reddit, you'll understand why this became a huge thing. When the Button died, over a million people had pressed. (1,008,316 to be exact.) Most left, but then you had us. The people whose lives were taken over by the Button.  It lasted 66 days, then finally, ran out. The subreddit was archived, and so everyone who still cares about the Button (as they should) migrated here.  Edit: typo"

ButtonAftermath,39ednq,questionmonger,3,Thu Jun 11 17:40:18 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately, the source has been deleted with the deletion of the subreddit, and the brigaded suicidewatch thread was deleted for obvious reasons. I'm digging around in SRD to see if I can find a link to the drama thread.  It happened around the time that FPH started to reach the front page regularly. Someone made a post whose title was along the lines of ""one down"" and linked to a suicide watch thread that a person made following a FPH brigade to their post on progresspics.  I may be misremembering the minor details, but that's the gist of it."

ButtonAftermath,39bh70,Ghostise,5,Wed Jun 10 17:08:15 2015 UTC,I would like to know more about the Inquisition and the Crusades. Not sure what specifically to ask.
ButtonAftermath,39bh70,asde,4,Wed Jun 10 18:11:14 2015 UTC,"When most people refer to the Inquisition they often refer to united effort between the Church and Knights to find Assassins in their ranks. However while this is true it is not accurate.  The Inquisition started out as separate independent branches that weren't even aware of each others existence. There was the vigilante branch of /u/faberim, the Church branch headed by yours truely, and a Knight branch that acted as a MP.  Eventually we all discovered each other so /u/wicro and I brought them all together into /r/ButtonInquisition, assigned roles and Operations and were actually surprising successful.  After /u/mncke made the Squire the Assassins suddenly weren't much of a threat but Knight leadership liked the Church's contribution too much and we spent too much time building the infrastructure so we adapted from counter-intelligence to a full blown spy ring.  Things quickly started to go to shit. It went from ""What is possible."" to ""What can we get away with without breaking the rules?"". The lower levels of the Inquisition started to go inactive but the radical upper-levels remained.  I felt a mixture of both being proud and terrified that I made this and it became more and more apparent that this was bad so I killed it in the peace treaty for the 2nd Crusade.  Before it was all signed and official the Knights wanted me to start a new intelligence branch that won't end up like the Inquisition so I made all the infrastructure, then left after the treaty was signed.  However I think new branch was made up of the same people so I don't know if it worked or not. We'll have to wait until the reports come out."
