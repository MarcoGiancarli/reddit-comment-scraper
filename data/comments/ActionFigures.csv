My little brother had a wrestling ring, and a shit ton of classic characters from when I was a kid. That was about ten years ago.   My version of ""playing"" with them now is sort of imagining various stories as I am setting up display shelves. So for example, when I did this  http://imgur.com/C0juEOHI didn't actually act out the fight but it played out in my head. I had lines playing out.   Red Hood: I love fighting Robots!  Nightwing: You just love it when Batman doesn't make you use rubber bullets.  Red Robin: Yeah, same thing with Damian and dismemberment.   Damian: laughs maniacally and chops of a leg  Or when I was grabbing the Bat-Bot I imagined Bruce calling Oracle to have the Batwing drop the thrasher suit and remotely control it."

Back then, I would make Superman fight clay monsters I built or Lex Luthor in that armor and put them in a basin full of flour. The reason was I wanted to re-create battles like in the movies where Superman would dive into the ground and pulverize the environment lol! I pretended that the flour was the ground or they were mountains Superman could get smashed into :)  Nowadays with the help of technology, I play with toys by making little toy comics out of them or little stop motion videos.
