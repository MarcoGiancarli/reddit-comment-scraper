MLPLounge,3e36pv,PatientIsTheNight,4,Tue Jul 21 16:37:33 2015 UTC,"I like traditional a lot more. CGI just looks too smooth, like everything's made of plastic. That's not to say I don't like CGI movies, they're good too, but I found the animation in Princess and the frog more pleasing to look at than Tangled. I like both movies, but artistically, PATF is better."
MLPLounge,3e36pv,Sargon_the_Great,3,Tue Jul 21 16:45:37 2015 UTC,"I can see where you're coming from. I like when they use CG to try to emulate the traditional look, like what they did in The Emperor's New Groove."
MLPLounge,3e36pv,Cinderheart,2,Tue Jul 21 16:53:06 2015 UTC,Paperman did that flawlessly. I can't wait until they develop that technology enough to use it in full-length movies.
MLPLounge,3e36pv,PatrickRsGhost,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:58:56 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'd say I just prefer the general look of traditional Disney animation. The new CG movies seem... kinda generic. Like they haven't really developed their own style the way Pixar has. In the faces especially; they all look almost identical. Hopefully that's something they'll work out eventually, if they don't move on to the Paperman style."
MLPLounge,3e36pv,TotallyNotASlinky,3,Tue Jul 21 16:53:36 2015 UTC,"I grew up on traditional, so of course I'd have to vote for traditional.  I do like CG when it's done right.  I think one of the best examples would have to be any of the spacescape or landscape/aerial scenes in WALL-E.  My biggest gripe with CG animation at the moment is the software is still too beta for designing human or animal characters.  I'm sure the majority of that is how they're drawn, but my opinion is if you can make a landscape look realistic, make the characters more realistic.  I've seen some very classic traditional animation (Sleeping Beauty, Cinderella, and Bambi) where the characters don't look too cartoony and even more modern traditional animation (Princess and the Frog, Hunchback of Notre Dame, Prince of Egypt, Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron, where the characters didn't come off as too cartoony.  I really enjoy the very classic, traditional animation, mainly because it amazes me how many hours were put into animating a single scene.  Having to do a rough animation of it, film it, go back and redraw it, refilm it, rinse and repeat.  I find myself nowadays watching the classic Disney movies and even the classic animated shorts put out by Disney, Warner Brothers, and MGM, and not really paying attention to the characters, but to the backgrounds.  Some of the backgrounds in the Disney films are so elaborate, so detailed.  The Nine Old Men were decades ahead of their time.  Nowadays to render that same effect, it basically just takes a few clicks of a mouse, a few swipes of a stylus to a tablet, and you're done.  I know there's a lot more involved, but still."

The KnowYourMeme entry is more ""clean"" and organized,but it's KYM, so it focuses on videos and images, which are certainly not the focus of the whole thing.   For a TL;DR, it's a creepypasta site housing the archives of a secret global organization to contain weird and occult stuff that appears in the world and threatens ""normality"".

MLPLounge,3e1crz,Cinderheart,2,Tue Jul 21 19:01:51 2015 UTC,"Good, you already know the basics of character design, assuming your DM rewards roleplaying.  There are two big points to designing a character:   Your character lives in a world, not a void. She interacts with others and forms opinions. Actions speak louder than everything. Does your character like puppies? Well good for her, we don't care. But did she adopt one, maybe even volunteer for the local animal shelter? These actions are tangible.   A subset of the second rule is this: don't focus on what your character is, focus on what she wants to do/be.  In RPG terms, you're making a level 1 character. Leave room for development. This also applies to her physical design. It's important for your OC to look good, but she doesn't need to be an alicorn half-changeling in order to be impressive.  Lastly, good writing is the override to any of these rules. If you're good enough, you can take more risks.  So:   What is your character's name? Where was she born? What are her parents professions? What does she love doing? What's her most crazy story about that? What has she done that makes her feel guilty at night? What is her cutie mark story? And finally, what is her goal, and what would she refuse to do to reach it? Would she kill for it? What about steal?   EDIT: Take your time. Also you're going to need about 3 drafts before you get it right, and a week to think between each of them."

MLPLounge,3dzpit,GameSand,4,Mon Jul 20 21:15:42 2015 UTC,Haha he's grown so fucking much. In that first picture he was about the size of a cat. He still thinks he is too.  Still tries to get me to pick him up and carry him around like I did when he was a baby.
MLPLounge,3dzpit,GameSand,4,Mon Jul 20 21:21:23 2015 UTC,He is freakin adorable.
MLPLounge,3dzpit,GameSand,3,Mon Jul 20 21:02:32 2015 UTC,Haha thanks.  Loved that little shit to pieces as soon as I saw him.

MLPLounge,3e05l3,Best-Pony,2,Tue Jul 21 02:56:51 2015 UTC,So what do we do now?
MLPLounge,3e05l3,trippingrainbow,3,Tue Jul 21 15:56:37 2015 UTC,"Exactly. If one thing came from it, it's the knowledge that no one uses that flair at all.  Because it changes to RainbowDash when it breaks. And who would stand having that?"
MLPLounge,3e05l3,trippingrainbow,4,Mon Jul 20 23:07:48 2015 UTC,Because it changes to RainbowDash   So its not buttchaser?
MLPLounge,3e05l3,Trixiepasta,3,Mon Jul 20 23:14:23 2015 UTC,"No no, it changes the image of the flair to the Rainbowdash flair. And that's just awful."
MLPLounge,3e05l3,goffer54,4,Mon Jul 20 23:17:09 2015 UTC,The awful thing is that its not buttchaser.
MLPLounge,3e05l3,Cinderheart,3,Mon Jul 20 23:26:35 2015 UTC,Rainbow Dash is buttchaser.
MLPLounge,3e05l3,Jibodeah,3,Mon Jul 20 23:40:19 2015 UTC,The last person on here who I know actually liked Cloudchaser is the first person I suspect to have fucked it up.
MLPLounge,3e05l3,Jibodeah,3,Mon Jul 20 23:08:57 2015 UTC,
MLPLounge,3e05l3,Jibodeah,4,Mon Jul 20 23:46:13 2015 UTC,Today's Plounge tibit: Civvi forgot the CSS that ensures the super secret background still appears in nightmode when he did that CSS remake a while ago.  I struck it against his permanent record.
MLPLounge,3e05l3,Jibodeah,3,Mon Jul 20 23:08:00 2015 UTC,"Shit, did I?  Did you fix it with your super css mastery skills?"
MLPLounge,3e05l3,Mage_Meat,4,Mon Jul 20 23:08:50 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I fixed it.  Other things that annoy me is how messy the CSS required to do name replacements is, but it kinda has to be as CSS isn't designed to alter content. (That's javascript's job).  I'm not sure as it is it works on all browsers either. font-size: 0 doesn't actually make the font disappear on all browsers according to one article I read. (Just makes it very small instead)  I had a mess around trying to find a nicer way to do it but couldn't find any."
MLPLounge,3e05l3,TheAsianTroll,3,Mon Jul 20 23:17:36 2015 UTC,"There used to be a two property hack to get the name to vanish, but it went away with the change to being css3 compliant.  ... All major browsers should null text with the font-size: 0. I'm sure some legacy, or minor market share, browsers do not. Because fuck standardization, right?"
MLPLounge,3e05l3,Xeladner,2,Mon Jul 20 23:22:05 2015 UTC,It'd be so much easier if the psuedo element could override its parent's display: none.  Doesn't make any sense why it can't override that but can override visibility: hidden.
MLPLounge,3e05l3,goffer54,2,Mon Jul 20 23:38:45 2015 UTC,"It makes sense, I guess? Display:none removes the element, you can't have pseudo elements on something that doesn't exist."
MLPLounge,3e05l3,Protosega,2,Mon Jul 20 23:54:35 2015 UTC,Actual reasons seems to be that a child element with visibility: visible within a visibility: hidden element will show up. Whereas a display: block within a display: none won't.

MLPLounge,3e05l3,Kody02,2,Mon Jul 20 23:00:58 2015 UTC,Yep. Very silly.
MLPLounge,3e05l3,Kody02,3,Mon Jul 20 23:04:14 2015 UTC,Is that current mods or all mods - past and present. Because if it's all mods then that number is a little low from what I'd expect.

MLPLounge,3dzdll,Trixiepasta,8,Mon Jul 20 19:47:40 2015 UTC,Not what the title says. OP wouldn't lie to us like that!
MLPLounge,3dzdll,Seanachain,3,Mon Jul 20 19:49:36 2015 UTC,"The title doesn't say anything about which one is which, but it should be obvious due to the differences between them.

MLPLounge,3dzdll,Trixiepasta,6,Mon Jul 20 19:56:03 2015 UTC,The new keychain is mentioned in the title first. In a vertical picture you would expect the first thing to be on top. The fact that the second thing is on top is what makes the joke.

MLPLounge,3e0wkx,princezenon,3,Tue Jul 21 02:38:42 2015 UTC,"I need to spiel for a bit, because this brings back memories for me.  This rainbow is the rainbow from the very beginning of the Gen 1 My Little Pony movie. Which was, to be quite honest, a lot more baller than people would give it credit for, but that’s not important.  I saw this rainbow at least five dozen times while working on a project with some old friends of mine back when I was REALLY into the MLP fandom, and I had this little idea for a production of a pony parody of Mystery Science Theatre 3000, which, if you don’t know, is an old show where this guy and two robots were trapped in space and forced to watch shitty movies, and they basically riffed the fuck out of them the whole time to stay sane.  The premise would be that, while Luna was stuck on the moon, both Lyra and Bon Bon, two fan favorite characters, were banished there as well for unlawful use of a motor vehicle and tax evasion respectively. When I had this idea, it was me, my friend akward, and two guys who I used to fuck around with on a TF2 server. We, quite honestly, didn’t have a lot to contribute. I was the main writer, and I did a lot of the work with the script. Akward helped out a bit, but we ended up not keeping anything he wrote, so it was basically just us and a script. For this, we’d need a LOT more than that.  The first part of my vision was this: a theme song. We had to have an artist willing to do stills for the introduction in the style of the rest of the show, and we’d have to have a musician to do the intro.  The second part of my vision was this: an EXTREMELY SHORT animated sequence to lay everything out and set the groundwork for what this was going to be.  The third part was a looped animation of Luna’s hair, some slight movements of their silhouettes, and three high quality voice actors to play Lyra, Bon Bon, and, of course, the star Luna.  Surprisingly, we almost did it. There was a guy on Youtube called OcarinaPony who was popular for having done the animated Dr. Whooves and Derpy podcasts and posting them on Youtube. We showed him the script and messaged him, and he was very interested, having grown up with Mystery Science Theatre 3000 and loving the show. He thought that what we were doing was plausible, and joined us.  After he joined, we found an artist and a musician almost simultaneously. There was a student, I won’t say his name or school (but it was a very nice school for music) who said he would compose and produce an intro for us. Hell, he said since we were almost exactly ripping off the original MST3k opening, he said he could do it easily. His friend was an artist, and he said he’d do the opening sequence.  The voice actors is where it kind of fell apart, though. We had no way of knowing who’d be interested, and we had no familiarity with advertising our project or trying to find someone interested. I enlisted the help of Rina-Chan, a girl who I forget the name of but who’s skype was Id Tap Dat, and a guy who went by the moniker Loss. Loss was an apt name.  We all got to be friends, but work never got done. We lost contact with OcarinaPony first, and he was followed by Rina Chan. Without an animator, it was pretty much doomed, but I promised myself I’d find a replacement. I mean, surely there’d be someone else interested?  Apparently not though, and with my part done, I really depended on other people, but they really never did anything.  The group lasted about a year. A year and a half, even, til the last message. I’ve lost contact with all of them, and I kind of missed them. My biggest regret is still not finishing that project. It looked like it could be DONE but it wasn’t.  We would’ve called it the Mystery Magic Theatre 3000. At least we almost got a theme song done."
MLPLounge,3e0wkx,ECM,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:39:15 2015 UTC,"Damn those are some cool ideas. I wish i could see the finished versions.   It's always sad to lose contact with friends, and it's so easy with Internet friends. Too many people drift away of disappear."
MLPLounge,3e0wkx,PatientIsTheNight,2,Tue Jul 21 03:21:14 2015 UTC,Holy shit that would be awesome. I would 100% love to help with the art if you're ever able to piece the rest of the team together again.
MLPLounge,3e1chc,Derples1,2,Tue Jul 21 05:04:49 2015 UTC,Try to get out. Preferably through the mouth.
MLPLounge,3e1chc,TotallyNotASlinky,2,Tue Jul 21 05:09:27 2015 UTC,You are unable to reach the entry point of the stomach on your own.
MLPLounge,3e1chc,TotallyNotASlinky,2,Tue Jul 21 05:12:04 2015 UTC,Then I'd like to be in a pony who is going to have stomach surgery so I can get out.
MLPLounge,3e1chc,TotallyNotASlinky,2,Tue Jul 21 05:14:29 2015 UTC,Well you could also try to induce vomiting.  Or try to communicate with the pony surrounding you.
MLPLounge,3e1chc,TotallyNotASlinky,2,Tue Jul 21 05:16:30 2015 UTC,True. Maybe I could go inside Twilight. She would probably pick up on me being in there pretty quickly and she would handle it well.
MLPLounge,3e1chc,TotallyNotASlinky,2,Tue Jul 21 05:19:26 2015 UTC,"First and foremost, you'd need to get her attention.  How do you go about doing this?"
MLPLounge,3e1chc,Kody02,2,Tue Jul 21 05:27:22 2015 UTC,Start with shouting. If she can't here that I'll move to pounding on her side. I'd use a simple pattern to try and get her at least some understanding of what's going on.
MLPLounge,3e1chc,Kody02,2,Tue Jul 21 05:30:26 2015 UTC,"She looks up from her book, hearing a faint sound that she can't quite place.  She looks around, attempting to discern the location of the sound."
MLPLounge,3e1chc,Kody02,2,Tue Jul 21 05:32:00 2015 UTC,I guess I'll just keep shouting and running around in her stomach. I want to get her attention turned toward herself. Hopefully I can cause her enough trouble that she uses a body analysis spell or something like that.
MLPLounge,3e1chc,Kody02,2,Tue Jul 21 05:39:02 2015 UTC,"She eventually notices the strange sensations and sounds coming from inside her.  She gets up and walks to her library, causing you to fall over as her stomach sways.  She heads over to her shelf of spellbooks, getting a book of medical spells off the shelf.  She flips through the book until she gets to an ""X-ray vision"" spell.  Casting it on herself, she looks down at herself, eventually spotting you.  ""What the Tartarus?"" You hear her voice all around you."
MLPLounge,3e1chc,Kody02,2,Tue Jul 21 05:45:08 2015 UTC,What do I have on me when I awaken?
MLPLounge,3e1chc,FonsoTheWhitesican,2,Tue Jul 21 05:37:29 2015 UTC,Nothing but the clothes you normally wear.
MLPLounge,3e1chc,FonsoTheWhitesican,2,Tue Jul 21 05:46:39 2015 UTC,Does this include shoes?
MLPLounge,3e1chc,FonsoTheWhitesican,2,Tue Jul 21 05:54:22 2015 UTC,Yes.
MLPLounge,3e1chc,FonsoTheWhitesican,2,Tue Jul 21 05:57:20 2015 UTC,I start wailing the entire Marshall Mathers LP in hope that she hears me.

MLPLounge,3e1chc,eyecikjou567,2,Tue Jul 21 06:07:29 2015 UTC,"The double B. That's right, BB-motherfucking-King!   Nah, Bon Bon."
MLPLounge,3e1chc,eyecikjou567,2,Tue Jul 21 06:18:21 2015 UTC,"BonBon looks down at herself, faintly hearing strange noises coming from inside her.  ""What did I eat last night?"" She says."
MLPLounge,3e1chc,eyecikjou567,2,Tue Jul 21 06:36:56 2015 UTC,"""I told you not to eat that bowl of Rice Crisps, Bon"" Lyra retorts, moseying past her."

MLPLounge,3e1chc,AberrantWhovian,2,Tue Jul 21 06:57:59 2015 UTC,What pony are you inside right now?
MLPLounge,3e1chc,SeatieBelt,2,Tue Jul 21 07:33:37 2015 UTC,Twilight

MLPLounge,3e1chc,DarkLordSnuffles,2,Tue Jul 21 07:38:55 2015 UTC,"Well shit, I start to go and yell to see if I can get some sort of attention"
MLPLounge,3e1chc,zibbels,2,Tue Jul 21 07:40:44 2015 UTC,"You exit her body, landing in the toilet water with a splash.  You see her finish and clean up after herself before standing, not taking a look back as starts to envelop the lever on the toilet with her magic."
MLPLounge,3e1chc,zibbels,2,Tue Jul 21 07:43:16 2015 UTC,I become the inner voice of that character. I demand muffins.

MLPLounge,3e1chc,zibbels,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:42:05 2015 UTC,You aren't big or strong enough to do that.  Tossing yourself into their stomach wall is more likely to get noticed than you yelling though.

I think I'd be pretty happy with how I've done in high school and be happy with how I'm doing in track. I'd be very confused and weirded out by MLP.  2014 me would be happy with how I did in sophomore year and would be pretty happy with how I did in track. 2014 me would have been a brony for 2 months at the point and I think he'd be surprised at how into the fandom I've gotten.   Generally, nothing crazy has happened over the last 2 years, I'm just a bit older, smarter, taller, and more into ponies."

MLPLounge,3e0z7c,tightcaboose,2,Tue Jul 21 03:27:45 2015 UTC,"Ah, a lot of people tell me I look at least 20. Which has confused a few people in the past."

What I wouldn't be able to explain to myself is that I am for the first time in my life I am truly happy. I look forward to everyday, I want to learn new things, I spend every waking moment bettering myself, and life is something I want to go on forever. Not something I contemplate ending every night.  In addition to that I would think the fact I like MLP is rather disgusting, and would question my sexuality.   I wasn't a very good person. :c"

He'd also be really fucking surprised by some of the stuff that's happened to me in the intervening years.  Me from 1 year ago would just be relieved when I told him that he'd be living in an actual house by the end of the year."

So I wasn't here. Then, I was planning to murder my older brother, something I'm relieved barely didn't happen, and 2 years ago me would be relieved that didn't happen. In most other regards, I wouldn't be impressed, except maybe in one other  1 year ago me, wasn't doing to good in what I thought I would do for my future. With certain friends having left that Spring, I realized how lonely I felt most of the time and guessed things would always be like that, especially after high school, thinking that I wouldn't ever make friends again(still iffy now on that) or find someone.

It is more music that can be related to MLP.  Off the top of my head the only songs on G.I.T.C. that are actually meant to be pony related are: Upside Down, Set Me Free, Revenge and Reach (but Reach is REALLY subtle). However most of his songs can be taken with a MLP relation as they are left very open.   I would absolutely advise anyone to listen to Avi, I know quite a decent number of people that listen to him yet have no interest in MLP. I mean, here is his most recent single Writing on the Walls, it's bloody beautiful."

Pinkie fans: most likely to be fully invested in the ""magic of friendship"" message of the show.  Twi fans: most likely to be the nerdy types who just recently thought there might be more to life than just studying/working.  AJ fans: most likely to be politically conservative, also most likely to consider effort to be the most important trait in someone's life.  Rarity fans: most likely to be artsy types and enjoy aesthetics more than function.  Fluttershy fans: most likely to be heavyset, most likely to be helped with life issues by the MLP community.  Another thing I notice is that positive pictures of bronies (using the term in a gender-neutral way) usually show Rainbow Dash and Applejack cosplays and negative pictures tend to show Fluttershy or Pinkie Pie cosplays."

And your results seem to confirm my guesses for what each pony's own fanbase might be like: perhaps every ponyfan would select the pony that is most like him or her.   negative pictures tend to show Fluttershy or Pinkie Pie   Perhaps because Pinkie Pie is too girly, pink, and annoying, and Fluttershy's too cute and overrated -- wings on the cosplayer add to his or her ridiculous cosplay appearance."

MLPLounge,3dykb6,UltraMew,3,Mon Jul 20 23:21:28 2015 UTC,I know a girl who's a Fluttershy fan and she's fucking quiet.
MLPLounge,3dykb6,Space4334,2,Mon Jul 20 18:10:00 2015 UTC,"Pinkie Pie is my favorite but I've never thought of myself as someone who makes people happy, although I am annoying. I tend to be positive sometimes.  The characters I aspire to be like are not the cartoon ponies on MLP, but real life people, mainly musicians.  EDIT: I also forgot to mention Derpy is my other favorite pony. I never considered her dumb, I think if anything she might have autism, which I happen to have."
MLPLounge,3dykb6,Fluttershys_Disciple,2,Mon Jul 20 18:13:23 2015 UTC,"Doesn't apply like that. I'm a semi-sedentary nerd that hasn't done sports since forced to in school, and who loves books, knowledge and so on. Yet my favorite is still Rainbow Dash. I would get along damn easily with Twi and likely have differences with Dash. That doesn't change things."

MLPLounge,3dykb6,mannus_mortris,2,Mon Jul 20 17:44:43 2015 UTC,"Most background ponies are overrated as hell, mane six are overrated too, and most one-offs and/or side characters (excluding a few, like Trixie, who is also very overrated) are very underrated.      Also, I am nothing like any of my favorite ponies, or any ponies at all, really.    Edit: Luna is also very very overrated."

Didn't expect such jockish circlejerking in here. Out of the mane six she's my favorite, with Dash and Twilight being close seconds. I'm fairly reserved, but not too quiet. I'm in the science & technology fields, working towards building a career in aerospace and simulation software development."
MLPLounge,3dykb6,PonyGrove,2,Mon Jul 20 19:11:49 2015 UTC,"As you can see HERE, the brony study already looked into this matter and was able to conclude that the vast majority of bronies choose their favorite pony based on issues of identification with that pony. Hence, the average brony will tend to be more like their favorite pony, or at least how they perceive that pony to be."

MLPLounge,3dykb6,thuhnc,3,Mon Jul 20 22:41:00 2015 UTC,"They also found that people also gravitate toward ponies that people want to be like... and if that was the case people mostly gravitated toward Rainbow Dash, Pinkie Pie, and Apple Jack. So basically more outgoing and self-assured.  Of course, this is just the numbers. You could be an outlier! If you participated in the study then we can get better data."
MLPLounge,3dykb6,Relictorum,2,Mon Jul 20 22:51:51 2015 UTC,"I've participated in almost every one, I think. I think I'm kind of a mix between AJ, Twilight, and Rainbow Dash. Also Fluttershy, who oddly enough is who I most identify with, in a way. I used to have some social anxiety issues but kind of forced myself to get over them, for the most part. Now I'm not so much intimidated by social interaction as I am aloof and don't want to be bothered with it (irl anyway; online is a bit of a different situation).    But yeah, maybe I gravitate towards Pinkie out of a secret desire to be more optimistic, silly, or outgoing, or something."
MLPLounge,3dykb6,JustConfusedOctopus,2,Mon Jul 20 23:07:46 2015 UTC,"The important part is that you participated! I love all the brony studies and I wish even more people were involved, so thanks for providing another valuable data point!"

MLPLounge,3dykb6,DaylightDarkle,2,Tue Jul 21 00:02:07 2015 UTC,"You usually get two types of fans, those who's personally align directly with the pony, and those who are direct opposites.   Personal examples include a loud and obnoxious friends who fully embraces the whole friendship thing but is a Fluttershy fan, a shy and quiet but very considerate friend is a pinkie fan/cosplayer, a borderline NEET friend is a dash fan, a MLG, obsessed with league and makes call of duty YouTube videos friend is a rarara fan.  On the flip side there's also an down to earth, works with horses country girl friend who's an Applejack fan, an seamstress, makes her own cosplays friend is a rarara fan, a energetic, talks a million miles an hour, does traditional dance friend is a pinkie fan.  So to me, it's either opposite and aligned, with few in betweeners."

There's a lot more to it than fitting tab a into slot b (or whatever combination of tabs and slots you're into)   All said, best of luck to the both of you! May you live in eternal bliss."
MLPLounge,3dwt08,Samura1_I3,3,Mon Jul 20 16:20:00 2015 UTC,"I've heard of compatibility being an issue before, but I've never really pondered it much. I suppose in my ignorance I just assumed that it doesn't matter nearly as much as other things.  However, since neither of us are experienced, would it stand to reason that our 'compatibility' would truly mature once activity began rather than before?  Edit: No offense taken btw. I appreciate you voicing your opinion. :D"

Yes, your 'personality' will develop in that regard once you get some experience under your belt. However, that isn't exactly synonymous with your personalities walking the same path. One might be a Rainbow Dash, the other might need a Fluttershy. Ya dig?"
MLPLounge,3dwt08,rabidbasher,3,Mon Jul 20 16:44:27 2015 UTC,"Going to add on to my previous comment to say, the best way to avoid any unwelcome surprises is to be open and talk with your SO openly on the topic. Barring actual 'test drives' , it's the best way to make sure you're going to be on the same page when it comes time to deliver the package."
MLPLounge,3dwt08,Samura1_I3,3,Mon Jul 20 17:08:41 2015 UTC,We're both pretty open with eachother. I'll definitely bring this up in conversation soon. Thanks for the recommendation!
MLPLounge,3dwt08,rabidbasher,3,Mon Jul 20 17:13:29 2015 UTC,I really hope it works out for the both of you! Best of luck and all that. Glad your striving toward what you believe in and so forth / so on.
MLPLounge,3dwt08,Gak_Attack,3,Mon Jul 20 17:18:27 2015 UTC,It's not always a good thing if you don't fight.
MLPLounge,3dwt08,Samura1_I3,2,Mon Jul 20 18:16:09 2015 UTC,"Absolutely this, however fighting != disagreeing    We've had long discussions about varying things we disagree on. We don't ignore our issues, and sometimes we're upset with each other, but we make an effort not flare up at each other.     Anger has, in my experience, never solved problems. It only fuels itself and feeds individual pride. (I saw fights too many times growing up) Relationships are about we not me. On multiple occasions, I've had to surrender my arguments to hers because, well, she's really intelligent and she's got a different perspective than my own. She's saved me several times from screwing myself over when I had my own plan for doing things.I've helped her deduce what was really going on in a situation in her life as well. When emotion might be blinding her to reason, I can help. She's much more in touch with her and my emotions, as mine are pretty callous right now (I bought into that faulty definition of masculinity and I'm still pretty messed up because of it). I'm a more cerebral person, and I like to think of things objectively. I've got a more logical priority, which comes in handy at times. In the end, we both realize that right answer is out there, and either of us may be wrong.   We both prioritize healthy communication in our relationship. It's probably one of the reasons that we've lasted this long. We're both pretty open with each other, and we don't hide things from each other. At this point, I'd rely on her opinion about me rather than my own. She has the ability to see who I am coming across as. The feedback I get from her about who I am has really helped me become a better person. If there's one person I want to spend the rest of my life with, it's her.     She also buys me plushies."
MLPLounge,3dwt08,Samura1_I3,3,Mon Jul 20 18:42:59 2015 UTC,That's really awesome actually! I hope you guys have a super great relationship and stuff. (You probably do already though)   I would consider you lucky though. A lot of the couples in my family are kind of unhappy with eachother...
MLPLounge,3dwt08,SonOfPlinkett,4,Mon Jul 20 05:10:34 2015 UTC,That's makes me sad. I feel bad a lot of times because I got something others would kill for. Does that make sense?
MLPLounge,3dwt08,jherazob,4,Mon Jul 20 05:12:26 2015 UTC,Aw. Don't be. There's plenty of other people in this world who also probably have their perfect person with them <3  But I guess it does kind of make sense. Some people are not happy with one another when they really shouldn't be together in the first place. Makes me kind of paranoid for my future.

I just don't want to come out until I hear from someone who knows what they're talking about that I'm not just crazy, or these feelings aren't just normal, or something like that. I don't trust myself enough for a self-diagnosis to be enough. I need to know for sure...      I haven't been able to see a psychiatrist though for a lot of reasons...  I dunno.

MLPLounge,3dvzwa,Fatal_Taco,4,Mon Jul 20 00:26:40 2015 UTC,"There's really nothing wrong with being overweight. Way easier to find better clothes sizes - I went from XL to XS - a size usually not available for men.   Don't believe anyone when they say it's 'life changing', it doesn't change your life, it just changes other people's interpretations of you. People see you differently, but that's it. Sometimes I still feel overweight just because I told myself that for 18 years.     On that, if you are planning to diet, the best advice I could give is to do it yourself.  The weightloss and fitness industry is one giant circlejerk. If what they were selling/saying worked, then they'd be out of business. You gotta get out there and do your own reading.  Also I did no actual exercise. Gyms are overrated."
MLPLounge,3dvzwa,Fatal_Taco,3,Mon Jul 20 00:33:11 2015 UTC,"it doesn't change your life  I did no actual exercise.   If I may comment, I believe these things may be related. Personally, the greater mobility/ability, sense of accomplishment, and endorphin addiction of working out and getting stronger/faster/more enduring are FAR more impactful than the weight loss (which is still very desired). Just my anecdote..."

Me: Should I stop posting shit to /r/Cringeanarchy and SRD?  Fonso: In my opinion, yes  Me: K, I'm not stopping tho, in fact, I posted a pic of some drama you were in to /r/CringeAnarchy titled ""fat Mexican harasses another fellow user""  Fonso: ENGI, please take that down, we don't need more drama  Me: What, am I being an asshole again?

Goodbye Engi  Me: bye ya fat bitch  [END OF CRUDENESS SAMPLE]   You see, my worry sometimes causes me to break. One night on Skype I was feeling down and worried and sorta snapped and told fonso and swifey about how I was an extreme asshole to some in elementary and middle school.  I don't know why, but a part of me actually hungers this stuff, like I try to say very hurtful things in the hopes that it will cause as much damage as possible, one side of me regrets being like that while the other enjoys being an asshole.   Lets just say that these past few months in life have been difficult with still recovering from a family death, moving to a new state, mother who's being pissy about me moving and then the breakup. As a result, it's impossible to resist being an asshole, as I enjoy it so much that I'm willing to lose friends and loved ones for it.  Despite this, I've been happy with life these past few weeks, minecraft, games and other hobbies make life enjoyable, and therefore I'm pursuing my goal of being happy in life.  BTW, the above sample is not real, it's only a scenario of how bad I can get.  Sorry"

Stinger held up pretty well for the first part of the fight though, I was thinking that he might actually win right up until he got thrown out of the arena.  Based Tombstone vs. Witch Doctor:  Wow, that was close. I knew that Witch Doctor was going to put up a good fight against The Based One, but holy shit, I didn't expect that good of a fight. If Witch Doctor hadn't gotten flipped over and it came down to a pushing match, they would have almost certainly won.  Biteforce vs. Overhaul:  How rude of Biteforce and Overhaul to do that sort of thing on television, giving all the viewers at home an explicit robot anatomy lesson like that! Seriously though, really nice back-and-forth pushing match. I think this match could have easily gone the other way if Overhaul's pincer was more effective.  Ghost Raptor vs. Icewave:  Wow, I didn't expect this to go the way it did. I'm stunned that Ghost Raptor actually made it into the semi-finals, it seems to me that they've just been barely skirting along on luck this whole time. I have to admit that the de-icer was a pretty smart idea, though.  Man, I can't wait for next week.

MLPLounge,3dwakh,Kodiologist,3,Mon Jul 20 03:05:23 2015 UTC,"Logs base 10 are actually quite easy to estimate, since they are always between the number of digits in the argument and 1 less than that. For example, all 2-digit positive integers have a common log between 1 and 2."
MLPLounge,3dwakh,ponytron5000,2,Mon Jul 20 02:23:12 2015 UTC,"Doh! Thank you! You are right. I did not know this, but I did know how to find the log of 10,000 or 100 or 1,000 - just count the zeroes. Somehow I did not connect the dots to the obvious, though. My math knowledge has the weirdest gaps."
MLPLounge,3dwakh,Samura1_I3,2,Mon Jul 20 03:01:14 2015 UTC,"Chaining off of that, you can often estimate weird log bases just by counting digits and using division and a little intuition.  For instance, suppose I want to estimate log 57(34972).  This is the same as log 10(34972) / log 10(57) which is roughly 5/2 = 2.5. The actual answer is about 2.68, so that's not too shabby.  Similarly, log 23491 (739584983948) could be estimated as 12/5 = 24/10 = 2.4. This is reasonably close to the real value of about 2.72.  It's also handy to know that:   log (ab) = b log (a) log (a * b) = log a + log b log 10(x) > x/10 whenever x is between about 1.4 and 10, and the divergence is greatest around x=4.   Hence, if I wanted to estimate log 10(640):  log 10(640) = log 10(64) + log 10(10) = 2 * log 10(8) + 1. Based on the last point, I'd hazard a guess that log 10(8) is closer to 0.9 than 0.8, so my final estimate is 2 * 0.9 + 1 = 2.8. The actual answer is about 2.8062.  On the other hand, if I wanted to estimate log 10(400), that's log 10(4) + 2. I know that log(4) > 0.4, but since that's close to where the divergence is greatest, I'd estimate something like 0.6 instead. This gives a final estimate of 2.6 (actual value about 2.602). Alternatively, I might estimate it as 2 * log 10(20) = 2 * (log 10(2) + 1), which I'd ballpark as 2 * (0.3 + 1) = 2 * 1.3 = 2.6. Funny how that works."
MLPLounge,3dwakh,Samura1_I3,2,Mon Jul 20 05:55:40 2015 UTC,"I like this technique a lot because you do not need to know the exact value of the common log, and it is fast. I am going to save your post, so that I can play with it later."

MLPLounge,3dvyfp,Maupdie,3,Mon Jul 20 00:08:38 2015 UTC,"The Binding of Isaac is a two-dimensional Action-adventure game where the player controls Isaac or six of the unlockable characters as he traverses through the dungeons located underneath his mother's basement.  You basically start off on floor 1, go through all the rooms getting money, bombs and killing what is within with your tears. On each floor there is a boss which you need to kill to get to the next one.  Just look at some of the screenshots on TBOI store page or watch some YouTube gameplay of it if you're unsure."
MLPLounge,3dvyfp,Cinderheart,2,Mon Jul 20 00:16:50 2015 UTC,"It's the original Legend of Zelda but with a twisted as fuck humor, all atacks are ranged and there's a fuckload of content."

MLPLounge,3dvyfp,Cinderheart,2,Mon Jul 20 00:02:40 2015 UTC,"It's certainly repetitive, but it's alright.   Anyhow, it looks like I can't get Terraria for my Mac, but I can get Hotline Miami."

MLPLounge,3dun1k,Maupdie,15,Sun Jul 19 17:17:27 2015 UTC,TIL there are people who haven't tried quesadillas. O.o
MLPLounge,3dun1k,DarkLordSnuffles,5,Sun Jul 19 17:19:55 2015 UTC,Some people don't understand how much of of an American thing quesadillas are.   I've never had one either.  Have you ever had Pâté chinois or Ketchup chips? When I heard that they were Canadian things I was shocked.

MLPLounge,3dun1k,Cinderheart,3,Sun Jul 19 18:11:45 2015 UTC,Do I look like a communist to you?  no i haven't are they good?
MLPLounge,3dun1k,DarkLordSnuffles,3,Sun Jul 19 18:14:24 2015 UTC,"First off, I'm a socialist.  Secondly, yes.   Ketchup chips taste like really strong tomato and vinegar.  No one knows what all dressed chips taste like.  They taste like ""GOOD"". Whatever flavour that is."
MLPLounge,3dun1k,Cinderheart,2,Sun Jul 19 18:16:30 2015 UTC,Most intereschting. I'll give 'em a try if I'm ever up there.   but do you have breakfast tacos tho
MLPLounge,3dun1k,DarkLordSnuffles,2,Sun Jul 19 18:19:15 2015 UTC,"Oh btw, found an article for you.  And Mexican food in general is an American thing. We have more Palestinian and Chinese food than Mexican.   EDIT: McDonald's does have breakfast burritos though."
MLPLounge,3dun1k,Cinderheart,2,Sun Jul 19 18:20:35 2015 UTC,"Palestinian food? Interesting, didn't expect that in Canada. Also MickeyD's doesn't count 'cause it's not a true breakfast taco and in no way because I'm kind of elitist when it comes to tacos.   But yeh. Cool. On a side note I've had poutine about twice, and it was amazing. So there's that for whatever it's worth."
MLPLounge,3dun1k,DarkLordSnuffles,2,Sun Jul 19 18:26:58 2015 UTC,"Was it...  Duck poutine?  Also, no tacos at McDicky's."

MLPLounge,3dun1k,DarkLordSnuffles,3,Sun Jul 19 17:54:15 2015 UTC,"The trick is to cook it on low heat until the cheese melts, then then it to high to toast the shell. Then you flip it over and toast the other shell."

MLPLounge,3dv892,eyecikjou567,3,Sun Jul 19 20:31:31 2015 UTC,"Well, yeah, depends on the school. I had 10 shitty years, but the last two were great.  It's still very important that you pay attention and learn and pffff haha okay okay can't keep a straight face with this.  The important stuff is important, obviously. Pay attention in English classes, your German classes will be completely useless after the test. Math and Physics is optional but you should be able to calculate numbers n' stuff. That's about it.  Be glad it's over and from now on you'll only learning the stuff and things you need."
MLPLounge,3dv892,ParaspriteHugger,2,Sun Jul 19 20:35:41 2015 UTC,"As a German who works in a scientific job, I have to tell you that our priorities might diverge a bit...   And school itself wasn't the problem, it were the people.   Head of school who would allow psychopathic, deeply misandic teachers to roam free until police investigation started after she threw a glass bottle at a student for pointing out flaws in her reasoning, ending with her institutionalized.   People becoming class representative without even knowing what the job is, making it a stupid popularity contest.   Hall monitors giving victims the same detention times as bullies, as they ""wouldn't be attacked without reason"".   Fuck those people."
MLPLounge,3dv892,eyecikjou567,2,Sun Jul 19 20:49:49 2015 UTC,"Wow, okay my school time wasn't that bad, the only bad thing I really had was my german teacher, he was probably mental and a good deal paranoid. But agreed, it's the people that make the problems.  He thought I wanted to ruin his reputation (by the end that was actually my goal) and did everything he could to give me bad grades.  My last two years on FOS were great though; we had really relaxed teachers except one, but this one was hated by everyone else, including staff.  During the eclipse this year (? or was it last) three of the teachers brought telescopes with filters and one even made photographs and livestreamed it into one of the classrooms.    Though I'm going scientific too; IT, so I need a good deal of math and physics for that. Physics is actually mostly for the equations, simulation and/or additional math knowledge is never bad.  I just got said what should at least apply to a student, if you're going scientific you are going to know your focus anyways."

Something else tangentially related to vaporwave, this is what happens when one of the originators of that genre decides to make disturbing ambient music.

Now, for average people that isn't really true but if you look at the people that start the finals of the Olympic 100m you'll see a large amount of people from American and from the Caribbean. There is a theory that is supported by many scientists that this is somewhat due to slavery. Slave owners basically bred people because they were strong and healthy. Over the generations that eventually led to families made of the fittest people of their generations. Sort of like breeding greyhounds. It's an ugly ugly fact but data seems to support it and it makes logical sense. The reason I'm aware of this is because of track so I watch a lot of sprinting videos and documentaries."

MLPLounge,3duq69,FalconHawk5,2,Sun Jul 19 17:54:49 2015 UTC,Nope. Definitely not.   Do you feel that there will ever be a time when everyone can live without hunger?

MLPLounge,3duq69,PM_me_ur_RainbowDash,2,Sun Jul 19 18:54:24 2015 UTC,Mine would probably be drawing shitty clop at the request of /u/Hclegend.  Uhh... What would you say is the stupidest thing you've ever done?
MLPLounge,3duq69,PM_me_ur_RainbowDash,2,Sun Jul 19 19:07:53 2015 UTC,The stupidest thing I've ever done took place over a 1 month period in which I told my parents I was working on my science fair project when in reality I didn't have the materials to do it. It started simply enough when I didn't have the I needed one day so I told them I was a tiny bit ahead of where I was. That lie ended up growing and growing and eventually I just had to admit that I was bullshitting the whole time.   DT. What do you want?
MLPLounge,3duq69,PM_me_ur_RainbowDash,2,Sun Jul 19 19:14:57 2015 UTC,I'd like a DT.

MLPLounge,3duj19,ED40,3,Sun Jul 19 17:10:48 2015 UTC,Tanks are actually really fun! Of course I can't tell what you'll think of them but I think they're at least worth a try. Have you ever played Kerbal Space Program?

MLPLounge,3dtn4z,dr1nfinite,2,Sun Jul 19 20:55:02 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I know.  We're doing it mostly because all application servers are running on consumer grade hardware, basically doing nothing and we only have on *nix box which does everything.  Plan is to split up the tasks of the debian box and provide fault-tolerance. Our current RTO is probably between two and four days, the RPO is undefined.  With VMs we could shrink the RTO at least significantly and have a good estimate on the RPO if something fails.  Once we have the budget I would really like to upgrade it to a dedicated storage solution for the VMs and two dedicated servers with ECC instead of consumer.  But sadly that is currently a bit expensive."

MLPLounge,3dtn4z,Jesse4Lyfe,4,Sun Jul 19 16:49:56 2015 UTC,When you have less than average internet speed coupled with an aging laptop streaming isn't always the best option.  Episode files take a while to download but it's worth it once they're in your computer because you have them forever and they play immediately with no buffering.

MLPLounge,3dth1f,Protosega,3,Sun Jul 19 08:15:34 2015 UTC,"I'm a huge fan of the Unchained Monk. It's just so thematic. I glossed over what they changed about the summoner, but was never really big on the class before.  I'm really looking forward to picking up Occult Adventures though, and getting my Gothic Horror on."
MLPLounge,3dth1f,Kadakism,2,Sun Jul 19 17:21:23 2015 UTC,I think the summoner changes were to make it not as broken OP as it was while buffing the other classes.  The new rogue is just a better ninja now.
MLPLounge,3dth1f,Protosega,2,Sun Jul 19 18:42:42 2015 UTC,"Well that's good, my friend hates DMing for the Summoner because they can get really stupid. I'll have to actually read the changes in depth.  I'm not... disappointed with the new rogue, but it does feel like there's only one valid option now to play them, particularly with the Rogue Finesse ability. If you use non-finesseable weapons, you're really just losing out on a pretty major class feature. I do really like Debilitating Injury. Dirty Trick is my favorite combat maneuver, and so having a minor version of that that still does damage is fantastic."
MLPLounge,3dth1f,Kadakism,2,Sun Jul 19 18:57:08 2015 UTC,We had a ban on summoner with the people I played with.  Now with the new changes that ban is lifted so I'm excited to try it out.
MLPLounge,3dth1f,Protosega,2,Sun Jul 19 19:00:36 2015 UTC,"I'm playing a Cad archetype Fighter and it's pretty great. Although, I've been reading into other systems lately. I love D&D 5e, and Dungeon World seems really interesting. My group is kind of married to 3.5/PF though, so getting them to switch isn't going to be easy."
MLPLounge,3dth1f,Kadakism,2,Sun Jul 19 19:06:51 2015 UTC,What do you think of the new Stamina and Combat Tricks?
MLPLounge,3dth1f,Protosega,2,Sun Jul 19 19:11:41 2015 UTC,"I definitely like it, especially as a thing that Fighters just get for free. It adds a comfortable level of complexity that makes the Fighter what I think they should be, a master combatant.  In general some of the effects are highly situational, but that's really just par for the course in Pathfinder. The feat list is pretty comprehensive though, which is nice. Overall I like it better than the Signature Skill thing, which is kind of meh in my mind."
MLPLounge,3dth1f,Kadakism,2,Sun Jul 19 19:26:40 2015 UTC,I'm going to try to mess around with it on a summoner to see if I can get it working in a fun way.

You'd be surprised (or maybe you wouldn't) how large the anti-feminist contingent of the online fan base is. Best you can do is call that shit out when you feel you can make a positive difference and support others doing the same. Also, it's good advice to distance yourself from people tossing around the term SJW as an insult with any amount of sincerity, those type of folks are typically not the rational sort and, in my experience, not worth wasting your time on."

I always use The Spur and Nemesis to get through hell, but I think I like King's Blade best. It's not as strong as the Nemesis, so I always trade it when that time comes,  but the story significance and usefulness of it all throughout the game is really hard to beat."

Every time I tried to delete some files to clear up space, the PS2 froze. So I was stuck with this useless memory card but still had the urge to play vidya.

In all, I've probably beaten it between fifty and seventy times in my life.   Runner up is the Halo games. Did you know that you can beat Halo 1 on the 360 using the Xplorer Guitar Hero controller?

MLPLounge,3dsvg5,Relictorum,2,Sun Jul 19 07:28:00 2015 UTC,Probably Star wars : Republic Comando. I beat that game 4 times when I was younger and another time after I bought it again in a steam sale.

MLPLounge,3dsflq,Ootachiful,2,Sun Jul 19 00:43:33 2015 UTC,"Quite a few bots made it that were inspired by old designs or made by old teams.  Nightmare came back, looking more stable for once.  Complete Control also returned.  There were a pair of bots that looked like Razer, Mohawk(mentioned before), and Chomp.  In fact... They even have all the bots up for view on their website.  Just, Beta, Bulldog, Chronic and Splatter aren't in the tournament.  Some of Beta's parts got lost by the airport, while the other three I think were involved in 'Special Matches'. Haven't seen any of them yet."
MLPLounge,3dsflq,Rockdio,2,Sun Jul 19 00:50:08 2015 UTC,I've never heard of Battlebots nor ten further words you just used.  I feel as though I've been leading you on.

Battlebots was the USA equivalent of Robot Wars... just without the house robots and without the pit.  It used to run on Comedy Central for about 5 seasons.

MLPLounge,3dsflq,Toboe_LoneWolf,3,Sun Jul 19 01:04:51 2015 UTC,"HOLY SHIT THEY REBOOTED BATTLEBOTS?!  God damn, I've been waiting for this. Maybe it'll actually get people interested in robot combat again.  P.S. Tombstone used to fight as Last Rites at smaller events. He's been my favorite ever since I saw this match."
MLPLounge,3dsflq,Toboe_LoneWolf,2,Sun Jul 19 01:37:13 2015 UTC,"This season's only going to be 6 episodes, and only the heavyweight division, but that's all because they wanted to make sure it could still draw a crowd.

MLPLounge,3dsflq,Toboe_LoneWolf,2,Sun Jul 19 01:52:18 2015 UTC,"I think Bronco has the best match up against him. Though... that all depends on if Bronco can shove him up onto the screws, like it does.  I feel like Icewave breaks down too easy to win anything, and a lot of the bots don't seem like they have a counter."
MLPLounge,3dsflq,Toboe_LoneWolf,2,Sun Jul 19 01:54:17 2015 UTC,"You're right about Bronco. As long as it can keep Tombstone from getting behind it, it definitely has a chance.  Icewave is a cool bot, but up against the really powerful ones, it doesn't stand much of a chance."
MLPLounge,3dsflq,Protosega,2,Sun Jul 19 01:58:45 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's the whole thing. Tombstone vs Bronco is going to come out to who is the better driver, if they meet in the Semis. Tombstone's got an interesting quarterfinal fight coming up, and Bronco does as well, haha, this conversation is making me want to do a whole live reaction thing to the show with others and put it here, maybe."
MLPLounge,3dsflq,mercurated,2,Sun Jul 19 02:02:20 2015 UTC,"I started watching! Alas, I'm going to miss tomorrow's episode.   I kind of wish that the bots were a little bit more varied than flip/spin, but well, if they want to win they'll stick with what they know works."
MLPLounge,3dsflq,Protosega,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:22:27 2015 UTC,"Yeah, a lot of the most diverse bots lost in the 1st round. Complete Control was one of my favorite looking ones.  You still got Witch Doctor and it's trollbot and Shaman, though."
MLPLounge,3dsflq,mercurated,2,Sun Jul 19 02:25:16 2015 UTC,"Stinger looks like it's going to be be fun, although against Bronco I don't know. Overhaul looks pretty cool too."
MLPLounge,3dsflq,Protosega,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:32:15 2015 UTC,"I think Bronco's gonna just flip Stinger all around the battlebox, but I could be wrong on this.  Overhaul's pretty cool, should be interesting to see it's fight. Icewave's going to stumble into the semis easily though, it sounds like."
MLPLounge,3dsflq,mercurated,2,Sun Jul 19 02:34:43 2015 UTC,"Granted, this is my first time watching Battlebots and robot war competitions, but Stinger can drive while upside down and it seems like Stinger is more agile and possibly a better driver.   Icewave just looks puny compared to Tombstone :P"
MLPLounge,3dsflq,Protosega,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:42:24 2015 UTC,"True, but I mean Bronco flipping him onto the screws like the other bots he's done it to.  Icewave is kinda puny, yeah, but he's got the bracket matchups that he can go pretty far in. He could end up being top of his side."
MLPLounge,3dsflq,mercurated,2,Sun Jul 19 02:44:57 2015 UTC,"I dunno, Stinger looks large enough that he'd have to be flipped in a very particular position for him to actually get stuck on the screws, since Stinger can flip itself over.   Yeah, Icewave is probably going to get to the finals. I'm going to be a little bored if it turns out to be spinner vs spinner a la Icewave vs Tombstone. There's not much strategy other than ""point and see what falls apart"""
MLPLounge,3dsflq,Protosega,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:54:02 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I mean like the way it took care of Witch Doctor in the Qualifiers, though."
MLPLounge,3dsflq,mercurated,2,Sun Jul 19 02:56:37 2015 UTC,"Exactly - Witch Doctor's smaller than Stinger, so it had no leverage to even attempt flipping itself over.  It's going to come down to driving and the arena hazards for Bronco vs Stinger, imo. And perhaps how durable Stinger actually is - with enough flips Bronco might eventually damage Stinger enough."
MLPLounge,3dsflq,Teebocks,2,Sun Jul 19 03:01:50 2015 UTC,Tombstone gonna get rolled over by singer.
MLPLounge,3dsflq,lifeofthe6,2,Sun Jul 19 03:42:44 2015 UTC,"Actually, Tombstone (fighting as Last Rites) and Stinger (fighting as Sewer Snake) have already had several matches at smaller events, and so far they have a pretty even record.  Just to prove that point, here are two matches that Last Rites/Tombstone won: 1, 2  And two that Sewer Snake/Stinger won: 1, 2"
MLPLounge,3dsflq,IrisGoddamnIllych,2,Sun Jul 19 05:32:56 2015 UTC,I fully know.  That's why I said that.   Singer with his driver is just a better bot than Tomb.

MLPLounge,3drbz5,JIVEprinting,3,Sat Jul 18 18:46:41 2015 UTC,My car needs more fuel than most so I'm going to have to make an extra pitstop but my car is a lot faster than the more efficient cars. I think I've got the speed to create a gap to them so that even with the extra pitstop I'll be in front of them. There's a few people who are driving lap times just a little bit slower than mine but they'll need to pit the same amount as me so I'm not too worried about them. I think I can win.
MLPLounge,3drbz5,TotallyNotASlinky,3,Sat Jul 18 18:58:51 2015 UTC,"Damn, you've got it all figured out."
MLPLounge,3drbz5,JIVEprinting,3,Sat Jul 18 19:02:15 2015 UTC,About 10 hours of prep goes into every 1 hour race.   We do some serious math when we're figuring out our strategy.
MLPLounge,3drbz5,SovietMan,3,Sat Jul 18 19:04:06 2015 UTC,"As opposed to math that just won't take things seriously.  Damn equations, get a job."
MLPLounge,3drbz5,MasterT231,3,Sat Jul 18 19:05:32 2015 UTC,Ok I gotta start qualifying now.
MLPLounge,3drbz5,MasterT231,2,Sat Jul 18 19:10:10 2015 UTC,You sure you're qualified to do that?
MLPLounge,3drbz5,MasterT231,2,Sat Jul 18 19:11:03 2015 UTC,Whoa.   Big stuff
MLPLounge,3drbz5,MasterT231,2,Sun Jul 19 03:07:24 2015 UTC,"Yeah I like to take it pretty seriously. Strategy is really hard. You have to think about how many pitstop you'll do and then you have to think about how fast you want to run at different parts of your stint. Do you want to push the tires when they're fresh and suffer later or do you want to go easy on them and be able to run faster latter on? If you run too slowly at the start will you get passed and then have to fight with people?   Setup is tough as well. Can I afford to give the car some extra grip with a certain suspension setup that will also wear the tires faster? What kind of downforce am I looking for? Do I want to add a little bit of extra downforce so that I can save my tires better despite the fact that my speed during qualifying will be hampered?   And then I just do a shit ton of driving to really memorize the track, the braking points, where I can and can't pass, learn how the track behaves and changes when there's rain, and of course to just get as fast as possible."
MLPLounge,3drbz5,MasterT231,2,Sun Jul 19 03:17:49 2015 UTC,Jeez.  I think the most prep I ever made for a game race was looking up what color shell did what.
MLPLounge,3drbz5,thrae,2,Mon Jul 20 01:44:51 2015 UTC,More info pls :)
MLPLounge,3drbz5,Squirrelit,3,Sat Jul 18 22:58:47 2015 UTC,I'm alright!  Just finished up watching some more Twin Peaks with my mom and now I'm just trying to figure out what to do now.
MLPLounge,3drbz5,Squirrelit,3,Sat Jul 18 18:55:50 2015 UTC,Do a backflip
MLPLounge,3drbz5,Ootachiful,3,Sat Jul 18 18:58:15 2015 UTC,Now why would I do that?
MLPLounge,3drbz5,Ootachiful,3,Sat Jul 18 19:01:22 2015 UTC,Because you want to.
MLPLounge,3drbz5,Ootachiful,3,Sat Jul 18 19:04:14 2015 UTC,I do?
MLPLounge,3drbz5,PM_me_ur_RainbowDash,2,Sat Jul 18 19:07:19 2015 UTC,My sensors say yes.
MLPLounge,3drbz5,PM_me_ur_RainbowDash,3,Sat Jul 18 19:08:29 2015 UTC,Your sensors need recalibrated
MLPLounge,3drbz5,FalconHawk5,3,Sat Jul 18 19:13:20 2015 UTC,"My sensors never fail, mister."
MLPLounge,3drbz5,FtDLulz,3,Sat Jul 18 19:14:56 2015 UTC,I think they just did!

MLPLounge,3drbz5,Mr_Saek,3,Sat Jul 18 18:41:13 2015 UTC,I have done nothing all day except watch Parks and Recreation to the point where laughing has become moderately painful.
MLPLounge,3drbz5,DoomedCivilian,3,Sat Jul 18 18:43:28 2015 UTC,The best I can do to help is laugh at your pain until I share it.
MLPLounge,3drbz5,DoomedCivilian,3,Sat Jul 18 18:46:01 2015 UTC,At least you're laughing at my pain with good intentions. It makes a nice change.
MLPLounge,3drbz5,DoomedCivilian,3,Sat Jul 18 18:50:41 2015 UTC,"Laughter is the best medicine, after all."

MLPLounge,3drbz5,Fuzzy_Gauntlets,3,Sat Jul 18 19:00:22 2015 UTC,There is so much unpacking that I should be doing but I don't wanna do anything but sleep. What has my life come to.
MLPLounge,3drbz5,Protosega,3,Sat Jul 18 19:00:54 2015 UTC,Its inevitable conclusion.
MLPLounge,3drbz5,DoomedCivilian,2,Sat Jul 18 19:03:24 2015 UTC,Guess so.  Nice knowing you kids
MLPLounge,3drbz5,FalconHawk5,2,Sat Jul 18 20:43:50 2015 UTC,"Seeya later, m8."

MLPLounge,3drbz5,FalconHawk5,2,Sat Jul 18 19:21:45 2015 UTC,u cant just let a bot live ur life man
MLPLounge,3drbz5,FalconHawk5,2,Sat Jul 18 19:22:00 2015 UTC,I can -- you can't make me do otherwise!

MLPLounge,3drbz5,Cinderheart,2,Sat Jul 18 19:28:15 2015 UTC,You've been tricked by a tricky trickster.
MLPLounge,3drbz5,Cinderheart,2,Sat Jul 18 19:30:22 2015 UTC,"Had a nightmare about a robbery, in the nightmare i looked out the window to see the robbers. Killed my whole family and i wokeup when i was grabbed.  Looked out window IRL and saw the exact same scenario as i did in the dream but without the robbers, I heard creaking in my house so i freaked out and walked out with my knife in hand. My dad was walking around naked, His question was ""What the fuck are you doing?"". my question was ""The real question is what are you doing?"""
MLPLounge,3drbz5,Cinderheart,3,Sat Jul 18 19:54:26 2015 UTC,"Jesus, that's hilarious.  So didya stab him?"

MLPLounge,3drbz5,Cinderheart,2,Sat Jul 18 20:03:58 2015 UTC,So you admit there is evidence?
MLPLounge,3drbz5,eyecikjou567,2,Sat Jul 18 20:07:57 2015 UTC,there might be.  but i wont tell you unless i get a cookie.
MLPLounge,3drbz5,eyecikjou567,2,Sat Jul 18 20:20:48 2015 UTC,But I have no cookie
MLPLounge,3drbz5,eyecikjou567,2,Sat Jul 18 20:25:01 2015 UTC,then no proof
MLPLounge,3drbz5,eyecikjou567,2,Sat Jul 18 20:26:30 2015 UTC,You have no proof

MLPLounge,3drbz5,cinnamonthecat,3,Sat Jul 18 19:25:22 2015 UTC,I've been fine. Rocket League has consumed my life though.

MLPLounge,3dr2gm,Kodiologist,4,Sat Jul 18 17:13:34 2015 UTC,That would be quite the inception if they decided to do that within the episode.
MLPLounge,3dr2gm,TotallyNotASlinky,3,Sat Jul 18 17:14:59 2015 UTC,"The entire episode is just a single, unbroken shot of scootaloo sitting at a computer, scrolling through the Plounge, downvoting all the shitposts. The episode is 6 hours long. It ends when she falls asleep on the keyboard."
MLPLounge,3dr2gm,spartiecat,5,Sun Jul 19 04:35:48 2015 UTC,Why would you do that?
MLPLounge,3dr2gm,spartiecat,4,Sat Jul 18 18:25:18 2015 UTC,Because it was funny and relevant!
MLPLounge,3dr2gm,UltraMew,6,Sat Jul 18 18:28:35 2015 UTC,My favorite part was when they confirmed Steven Magnet for Smash Bros.
MLPLounge,3dr2gm,Cinderheart,4,Sat Jul 18 20:51:28 2015 UTC,That was some partnership with Nintendo wasn't it?  I never saw that coming.
MLPLounge,3dr2gm,UltraMew,5,Sat Jul 18 21:24:55 2015 UTC,Haaaa haaaaaaaaa.
MLPLounge,3dr2gm,Cinderheart,4,Sat Jul 18 17:13:40 2015 UTC,The episode I imagine had some hit and miss humor.
MLPLounge,3dr2gm,UltraMew,4,Sat Jul 18 17:16:08 2015 UTC,I give today 228/6
MLPLounge,3dr2gm,UltraMew,3,Sat Jul 18 17:35:06 2015 UTC,That's an interesting scheme. You must have really enjoyed the episode!
MLPLounge,3dr2gm,FonsoTheWhitesican,3,Sat Jul 18 17:41:32 2015 UTC,"Not really. I was hoping for 300+, but lots of things weren't working for this one."
MLPLounge,3dr2gm,FonsoTheWhitesican,5,Sat Jul 18 17:45:56 2015 UTC,"THIS EPISODE WAS THE BEST EVER!    Did you see that Sombra backstory? It was GREAT!      A straight up confirmation of Lyrabon and Fluttercord? Hype!    The Crusader's new cutie marks were neat too.   We even saw Babs Seed again!   AND SHE WAS RELEVANT FOR HALF THE EPISODE  I didn't really like the Chrysalis reform, but it was okay. Most of the fandom loved it.    Wonder if DarkLordSnuffles watch the new episode yet? His opinion'd be nice.     I saw Starlight in the background again. She was playing chess with Trixie.  And that cliffhanger, with Twilight getting brainwashed with dark magic...   11.5/10   sobs in corner"
MLPLounge,3dr2gm,Samura1_I3,4,Sat Jul 18 19:12:47 2015 UTC,Luna's necromancy seemed a little shoehorned in.  They could've made it something Twilight found in the ruins of the library's basement and it would've worked just as well.
MLPLounge,3dr2gm,JOHONDAR,3,Sat Jul 18 19:31:51 2015 UTC,"Yeah it was. It just seemed like filler.    The Celestia-banished-to-the-moon scene was interesting too. Why would Mother Faust need to banish her anyways? Ah well, guess I'll wait for Part 2.    The Derpy-adopting-Scootaloo thing was rather interesting too."
MLPLounge,3dr2gm,JOHONDAR,3,Sat Jul 18 19:37:36 2015 UTC,Derpy-adopting-Scootaloo   I don't think Daring Doo is going to be too happy about that.  Although I have a fan theory. Ditzy Doo is Daring Doo's good (twin) sister.
MLPLounge,3dr2gm,JOHONDAR,2,Sat Jul 18 19:39:17 2015 UTC,"Well, the scene of Ditzy and Button Mash running by Scootaloo might confirm that, but I don't know.    Speaking of Daring Do, the ship hint the writers put in was hilarious."
MLPLounge,3dr2gm,Samura1_I3,3,Sat Jul 18 19:41:16 2015 UTC,Now I know this is fake. The CMC failed to get a proper cutie mark in their dreams.
MLPLounge,3dr2gm,FtDLulz,3,Sat Jul 18 20:18:38 2015 UTC,"Well, those were nightmares. Now these are proper cutie marks. Who knew Scootaloo would be a toy manufacturer? Apple Bloom as a gamer is interesting too."

The cheap printed look isn't helped much by the images themselves which were just flat vectors. Here's another buckle with the same process. Better?  The belts are paracord, and the ones that give only give about an inch when they settle. After that they stay as still as the others, which don't need to settle."

A lot of Pinkie's can be ""don't be hyperactive and crazy."" A lot of Rarity's use the same general plot of freaking out over making dresses in some way or another.    I mean, not every single episode of every character is the same. And I think Fluttershy has shown some growth. She's able to make friends outside of the Mane 6 now (Discord, Treehugger, maybe the Breezies). She agreed to infiltrate Starlight Glimmer's town and bailed the rest of them out, etc."

I started these last year with a one off meme of the Rarity one to a mate. It lead into a discussion about how Pinkie was being poorly portrayed in the season. I figured all of the mane six would have been  a bit over her, But couldn't for the life of me find a screencap of Fluttershy pissed at Pinkie.   All the caps I tried for in Putting your hoof down had Pinkie looking terrified, which was not what I was looking for. I didn't want the others mad at her, just a little tired of her antics.   Everyone has that one bloke in their group of mates that everyone loves, is funny as hell, but sometimes you wish he could be a bit more... Respectable.     I think she is a lot more enjoyable as a character this season, she's still the adorable, goofy, little Pinkie we all love. The writers have reeled her in to back to the earlier season Pinkie.

MLPLounge,3dqm2x,TMGreycoat,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:44:19 2015 UTC,Do they pump out raw footage? Surely you could set it to some basic compression
MLPLounge,3dqm2x,eyecikjou567,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:34:16 2015 UTC,"IIRC some of the cheaper (as in 300$) ones have basic compression: Almost lossless MP4.  You still get about 20 - 30 GB per hour of 1080p footage, which should be manageable on a SSD.  The more expensive ones are either no compression (the one I used for a very short amount of time) or they connect via PCIe Gen 3 x16 to a PC with lot's of CPU that will compress the image and save to local HDD raids.  Though I'm really not qualified in that field and that's just what I've come across."
MLPLounge,3dqm2x,TMGreycoat,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:40:13 2015 UTC,"Wouldn't raw capture be a more basic function than compression (which requires extra processing)? I don't see why it would be limited to more expensive devices. Can't say that I've ever used a capture device, so I'm guessing here"
MLPLounge,3dqm2x,eyecikjou567,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:56:41 2015 UTC,"Well raw capture involves more bandwidth, therefore more expensive hardware.  The cheaper ones have some chips/something that reduces the need for high bandwidth and also the need for thick cables to transfer these huge amount of data. Though the compression algorithm is pretty bad on these.  They are made to quickly process an image, they can't do a lookahead and the result should look as good as possible.  Mostly you will get a row of JPEGs packed into a MKV or MJPG file without any interframe compression.  The better compression costs more money but if you already have that money at your expense, chances are you can also store raw data and process later for better quality.  I've only seen and used a couple so my guesses are only minimally better as yours. I wouldn't touch one of these with a ten foot pole, I rely on Bandicam for Video Capture stuff."
MLPLounge,3dqm2x,TMGreycoat,2,Sat Jul 18 21:02:54 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the cool info! I use Fraps myself, maybe just because I'm familiar with it. I'm not a fan of the performance hit you get, but it's not too bad. I've found 30s of raw capture (1080p, but only 10fps) results in a file around 6GB. Good thing I don't usually use it, because I definitely don't have the storage"
MLPLounge,3dqm2x,eyecikjou567,1 point,Sat Jul 18 21:26:48 2015 UTC,"Well, Fraps is definitely the most robust of all capture programs but I found that the compression options for Bandicam are just better."

MLPLounge,3dp70n,Kody02,3,Sat Jul 18 10:16:34 2015 UTC,"Oooo, looks like an Arizona blond."
MLPLounge,3dp70n,Kody02,4,Sat Jul 18 03:27:12 2015 UTC,"I do live in Vail, AZ, so that's probably exactly what he is!"
MLPLounge,3dp70n,sillybear25,3,Sat Jul 18 03:33:10 2015 UTC,"If it is, then her little spider-house should be somewhere close by!"
MLPLounge,3dp70n,FtDLulz,3,Sat Jul 18 03:38:58 2015 UTC,Is it a her? I had assumed it was male from the size of it.    That would make sense. My grandparents said they see it around that area all the time.
MLPLounge,3dp70n,FtDLulz,3,Sat Jul 18 03:42:09 2015 UTC,"I honestly don't know, I just assume most spiders are a she; it looks large enough to be a female so maybe. Though, looking at it again the abdomen doesn't look big enough to be female."
MLPLounge,3dp70n,gbrincks,3,Sat Jul 18 03:48:36 2015 UTC,"Fair enough. I know a good amount about sexual dimorphism in moths, but not too much about spiders."
MLPLounge,3dp70n,gbrincks,4,Sat Jul 18 03:51:18 2015 UTC,"From what I found, the major differences are in the pedipalps and the first set of legs: Male spiders have palpal bulbs (colloquially known as ""boxing gloves"" by tarantula enthusiasts) and usually have spurs on their front legs. Both of these are used during copulation."
MLPLounge,3dp70n,gbrincks,3,Sat Jul 18 05:53:04 2015 UTC,"I would have freaked out so bad. I hate spiders so much. They're fine as long as they're not close to me, then I am terrified."
MLPLounge,3dp70n,gbrincks,2,Sat Jul 18 03:30:44 2015 UTC,"A lot of bugs are less scary when you realize that the majority of them don't want to bite or sting you. Anything bloodsucking does, but most bugs are just scared because you tower at over 100 times their size.  Taking caution to not spook them (slow, smooth movements, etc) and keeping your distance from the actively aggressive ones, it's really easy to safely and happily observe them. They really are beautiful creatures when you take the time to understand them, instead of just thinking of them as icky monsters."
MLPLounge,3dp70n,TotallyNotASlinky,3,Sat Jul 18 03:36:31 2015 UTC,"Oh believe me, I try. And I'm usually fine with anything other than spiders. But when a spider is close to me I'm like ""NOPE!"""
MLPLounge,3dp70n,TotallyNotASlinky,1 point,Sat Jul 18 03:39:08 2015 UTC,"Fair enough.  People in general are raised to believe that spiders are terrifying, so it doesn't surprise me that it'd be difficult to see how one could be cute."

I really want one as a pet but that's probably not going to happen until I live alone. My planned first T is a Phrixotrichus scrofa (formerly known as Paraphysa scrofa), most owners agree that they're very docile and a good first.  Edit: I just want to say to anyone that may read this and is also interested in owning a tarantula: Avoid the extremely common Rose Hair tarantulas, they are usually wild caught. You want captive bred."

The people close to me would tell you that's not me at all though, as I can almost care too much sometimes about those people. Especially my girlfriend, who knows the most about me and sees every bit of me that I keep locked in my personal vault of a mind. If my moderation style has said anything about me, it's that I have a strong sense of justice and will throw away my personal allegiances in order to pursue what is the closest thing to a fair and just outcome.

Day-to-day, this just means that I laugh a lot at farts. Ideologically, it means more to me. Comedy is a form of communication; the purpose of communication is to convey information. Interesting information often challenges what you think you know. So, I get nothing from, say, a stand-up routine making fun of the WBC. I know precisely what I think about the WBC; I don't need or want to listen to someone on stage agree with me for ten minutes. Instead, give me a comic who suggests to the audience that we praise the WBC for their lenience in interpreting the Bible: instead of murdering gay people, they just torment their families at their funerals! I think that is a fantastic joke, not in the least because, even if it's delivered with a hint of irony, it horrifies me.  So naturally I'm a bit of a free speech, marketplace-of-ideas nut. I aspire to be a full-blown Libertarian nut, but I don't yet have the credentials. Need to read more Ayn Rand before that can happen.  I dealt with SA in middle and high school like several people in this thread seem to, but have made progress in that area since then. I'm happy with how I fare in social situations these days, and, in fact, I don't regret having been so anxious for such a large amount of my life, even though it was never a breeze. If I have any regret, honestly, it's that I didn't play more World of Warcraft. My friends have great stories from raiding with their guild during Wrath of the Lich King. I totally missed out. I don't know how to make time for WoW any more in college (I tried. It didn't work out well for me).  The future still terrifies me regardless of whatever progress I make with my mental health, but I'm comforted by the fact that most people my age share that fear."

MLPLounge,3dp6yx,mercurated,3,Sat Jul 18 18:09:14 2015 UTC,"I'm not really the me I am here IRL. I can't be.  I rarely talk to people outside of my small circle of friends, or my little brother. So most of what I like to do are solitary hobbies. Practicing, math, video games.   Never was likable, and still question what my friends see in me.  Really awkward in most things I do, and how I talk to people.   I guess in trying not to be dislikable, I  become more annoying and dislikable  I think too much of what people think of me. To the point that I'm scared of leaving any impression on people for fear that it'll be a negative impression, and rightfully so.  Usually I'm away from people, people I don't know, clinging to those I do. It's not good, but it beats the alternative.  And I've been that same person for a while, and it doesn't seem like that's changing. Which is unfortunate, but I like to think I'm with terms with it."

I'm generally pretty shy with people who I don't know that well. If you talk to me I can talk back just fine and hold a conversation it's just I probably won't talk to you first.

During school I like to keep to a small group of friends as opposed to large parties, and we usually play social video games like smash bros or Mario kart. I'm somewhere in between liberal and conservative with my views on political things in the USA, I love to drive my car and my job as a driver reflects that, I like outdoors stuff but don't have enough time for it, I don't understand a lot of social norms and sometimes press them but not too much, I drink too much but not enough to affect my acedimics or work, I like pokemon and a lot of other Nintendo stuff, and I enjoy just shooting the shit with friends and coworkers."

Despite some of the crap I've been through I've learned to love and accept myself a lot more and spend a lot of time on the internet doing my best to help make people smile and love themselves more. I don't always manage this and sometimes I screw up despite my best efforts but I mean well. I care way too much at times but I feel it's worth it.   I write stories, draw and play guitar and I've been told I'm a pretty good poet. I also pretend to be a poetic pony when I'm not pretending to be a rockstar anthropomorphic kangaroo. I've been a furry since 2007 and a brony since 2011 and I've been playing tabletop rpg's since 1984. I'm someone who thinks you should love and accept yourself as much as you can because you're worth it and I mean that from the bottom of my heart. Most of all I'm a weirdo and proud of it.

I basically have two modes that I often switch between very quickly. I'm either joking around in my usual absurd and mildly sarcastic style, or I'm in super serious mode. Basically, if the situation calls for it, I become a lot calmer and take on a more thoughtful approach to talking to people. I generally use that to settle arguments or give advice.  If there's one thing a bit odd about me IRL that you might not know about me, it's my strong aversion to loud noises. It doesn't even have to be that loud, if I can hear something a bit noisy that I can't stop, I get physically stressed.  tl;dr: 8th level grand autist"
MLPLounge,3dp6yx,MoonbuttOnTheTable,2,Sat Jul 18 11:08:15 2015 UTC,"I feel awkward all the time, so I tend to hide it. I have no idea if I'm going to communicate well, terribly, or even at all before I start talking. It's unlikely I will remember anything, so any question that starts with a ""Remember"" or similar is likely going to get the same result as every other time it's been asked. I'm pretty sure I'm a 0/10 in looks. I refuse to take many compliments unless they're from my sister, as we're brutally honest with each other. I love cheesecake, but don't have the money or willpower to actually get it.  I don't consider myself particularly intelligent, don't care what I look like for multiple reasons, and intensely dislike someone if they're being a massive dick. I play a lot of video games, eat a lot of food, and have an extremely fast metabolism so I don't gain weight. I think that's about it though, I'm not very interesting."

I would never be like them, and they would never accept me. Two of them already give me shit for the whole ponies thing, and the older two don't respect me. The only one I truly respect in the family is my father, and he would just hang his head in shame that his only son not only isn't married, but he's given up on his masculinity entirely.
