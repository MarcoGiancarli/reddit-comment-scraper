Mario,3cxa75,3rdOption,12,Sat Jul 11 16:26:02 2015 UTC,Perhaps because Mario started off completely linear.  It was not as if you could tackle the levels in any order in SMB.
Mario,3cxa75,ankerous,2,Sat Jul 11 16:45:11 2015 UTC,So did Sonic.
Mario,3cxa75,Soupbowler64,5,Sat Jul 11 16:58:18 2015 UTC,"Yes, sonic was a point A to point B platformer like Mario. HOWEVER, the levels were normally so big they allowed for multiple pathways that lead to the end of each stage allowing for different ways of beating the stage itself."
Mario,3cxa75,davesterist,1 point,Sat Jul 11 20:35:44 2015 UTC,You kinda could though. Several levels allow different exits that take you to different paths which lead to the ending.
Mario,3cxa75,ankerous,4,Sat Jul 11 16:49:22 2015 UTC,"Well, ok, yes you could warp to further ahead worlds but you still couldn't tackle World 4 first before World 1.  Still seems linear to me aside from skipping sections."
Mario,3cxa75,hylian122,9,Sat Jul 11 16:51:34 2015 UTC,"I'd rather it not be so linear, personally. I enjoy what we've got, but I'd love to see more like SM64 and Sunshine. Those were exceptions to an otherwise fairly linear series, but great exceptions if you ask me."
Mario,3cxa75,inatspong,0,Sat Jul 11 16:57:57 2015 UTC,I loved that the 3D games and the 2D games were so different.  I hate it that they're trying to make each other only different by one dimension.
Mario,3cxa75,Ko-Vic-Yourself,4,Sat Jul 11 16:59:27 2015 UTC,I feel like there's room for both Mario 64 style games and 3D Land/World style games.
Mario,3cxa75,Kubla_Khan,6,Sat Jul 11 23:54:10 2015 UTC,"I think SM3DL/W were just classic Mario games, but with a different dimension,(it even says so on the back of the box) while games like Sunshine and SM64 were another type of game completely. This is why the linear aspect is 'justified' in these games. 2D Mario was always linear.  I'd really want another non-linear 3D Mario, though."
Mario,3cxa75,KyuubiReddit,5,Sat Jul 11 20:26:04 2015 UTC,"Because the main point of the Mario titles is specifically the platforming, not the world-building, story, or whatever.  Its nice to have a bit more open-endedness for Mario titles, but its not a requirement."
Mario,3cxa75,cheat-master30,3,Sat Jul 11 21:33:08 2015 UTC,I don't view linearity as a bad thing.   SM64 is by far my least favorite Mario.
Mario,3cxa75,Raffo54,2,Sat Jul 11 19:33:41 2015 UTC,"What do you mean they're not?  I've seen quite a few Mario 64/Sunshine fans annoyed that the recent Mario games are overly linear.  Heck, I'm one of them."
Mario,3cxa75,LukeArio,1 point,Sat Jul 11 19:56:15 2015 UTC,"More open Mario games are the exceptions in the Mario franchise, most of them are linear. Nontheless, you do sometimes hear complaining about the Galaxies and 3D world being too linear.  For me, the more Linear the game the better. It almost always allows for better or more focused level design."
Mario,3cxa75,System777,1 point,Sun Jul 12 19:54:24 2015 UTC,"Because even when it is linear, Mario is AMAZING. Think - Super Mario 3D World. Much more linear but still a brilliant game, in my opinion. Those games were an experiment and less linear games will no doubt emerge at some point but you can't really say that recent Mario games are worse than previous ones, not by any stretch. Some people PREFER the more open games but a lot of people also prefer the more linear games. Mario never really hits a bum note in the main series, no matter what it does."
Mario,3cxa75,Ko-Vic-Yourself,0,Wed Jul 15 19:03:59 2015 UTC,because that is what Mario fans want.  except the fans of Mario 64  ew mario 64

Why are the reviews so high?  It's the same thing as mario galaxy but not as fun. I just eventually stopped playing less than half way through. Honestly i felt the same way about new super mario U. It was so unimaginative. Everything seemed so bland and over used...I really hope the step things up for the next mario
Mario,3ck866,Siluroth,17,Wed Jul 8 15:42:19 2015 UTC,Sometimes it just feels like the the same thing over and over with little innovation
Mario,3ck866,250lespaul,6,Wed Jul 8 16:24:32 2015 UTC,"If we limit ourselves to Mario platformers only, I don't agree with you."
Mario,3ck866,TakeOffYourMask,3,Wed Jul 8 17:35:50 2015 UTC,"But consider the fact that Mario is made new for every generation. Your kids can experience the same magic that you did but for their current system with modern graphics/sound.  The games can seem repetitive at times, but it seems like each Mario game does bring something new to the table or mixes things up just enough to make it refreshing. :)"
Mario,3ck866,Brackner,3,Wed Jul 8 18:37:12 2015 UTC,"This is very true... I got an NES when I was around 12. My kids now have a Wii and love Mario. The Super Mario Wii game got scratched badly long ago, and I recently picked up a used one for cheap, and they've been playing the heck out of it this summer!"

Mario,3ck866,3ggu,4,Wed Jul 8 16:01:29 2015 UTC,The god damn New Super Mario Bros series is so good and yet it's just the same game 4x.
Mario,3ck866,Zeppelanoid,9,Wed Jul 8 19:30:23 2015 UTC,Mario holds your hand to much nowadays. You always have 100 lives by the last world and if you die to much the level mocks you with helping items
Mario,3ck866,TORFdot0,4,Wed Jul 8 18:28:04 2015 UTC,"I agree to an extent. The first few worlds in most games are a bit hand-holdy, but later on (especially if you are going for 100%), the games get very difficult. The life count thing doesn't matter much these days, but look at games like Super Meat Boy or VVVVVV where you have infinite lives and just respawn at the last check point. No one ever complains about them being too easy..."
Mario,3ck866,Brackner,1 point,Wed Jul 8 18:39:24 2015 UTC,Yeah but I don't really see the point of having the extra life system at all when you can very easily get up to like 300.
Mario,3ck866,Shulks_Lower_Monado,6,Wed Jul 8 18:43:29 2015 UTC,I think it hasn't been gotten rid of just due to the legacy of it. Mario pretty much started the 1-UP thing.
Mario,3ck866,Brackner,2,Wed Jul 8 18:46:36 2015 UTC,not to mention a game over means nothing anymore. You don't have to use a continue and it doesn't even reset the game. you just have to retry the current level
Mario,3ck866,TORFdot0,6,Wed Jul 8 18:44:56 2015 UTC,"Not true. In the NSMB games, you can only save at castles (just like SMW)(although there is a ""quicksave"" feature), if you lose all your lives, you start back at the beginning of the world or the last castle you beat."
Mario,3ck866,Brackner,2,Wed Jul 8 18:47:17 2015 UTC,oh I didn't realize. I've never actually gotten a game over in the nsmb series. Actually the only time I've gotten game overs when I play 3d world with multiple people. That's probably why there are so many lives in the first place. They balance the game for 4 players instead of 1.
Mario,3ck866,TORFdot0,1 point,Wed Jul 8 18:51:12 2015 UTC,"Only until you get to world 9, then you can save anywhere on the map, anytime. The only thing it doesn't save is world progress like when you get the halfway flag."
Mario,3ck866,dammitkarissa,1 point,Wed Jul 8 20:53:51 2015 UTC,i actually agree with you.  i think life systems are an outdated concept that was only designed to drain children of their quarters at arcades.  they really have no place on a console release of a game.  Mario's life system is only tolerated due to its legacy.
Mario,3ck866,Kubla_Khan,2,Wed Jul 8 19:08:23 2015 UTC,"The game offers you the item, but you're not forced to take it. They want you to enjoy the game, and Mario is usually hard. Some people may enjoy just getting to the end."
Mario,3ck866,neoslith,1 point,Wed Jul 8 23:45:50 2015 UTC,"I'm old fashioned and I know it is optional. it's just part of the change of the game industry has taken and it reminds me of the more negative parts of gaming nowadays (DLC, microtransactions, no mods) so I know it's not right I just feel that way."

I love the all ""New"" Mario games, I do, especially the Wii U one, best of the series, but god, I just wish they would do something completely new for the next Mario side-scroller. Make it all a dream like Mario 2 was and you don't have to try to fit in a continuity or some lame princess-gets-kidnapped story. Just for one title. Please?"
Mario,3ck866,spagettparty,3,Wed Jul 8 19:14:13 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the New series is great, but it feels stale. Mario Maker makes me hopeful that the next sidescrolling mario will be quite different, since it can't just be more levels if we can already make our own."
Mario,3ck866,Kaeobais,3,Wed Jul 8 20:02:36 2015 UTC,"A different artstyle huh?  I always liked that cartoony artstyle they used for a lot of the still image artwork for SM3DL and SM3DW, like this and this. I bet that would look fantastic as a full game."

Mario,3ck866,Krustoff,5,Wed Jul 8 17:26:14 2015 UTC,On the contrary I love the controls for NSMBwii and wiiU. The only problem I have with those games is the goddamn pause when somebody dies. Ugh!
Mario,3ck866,dammitkarissa,1 point,Wed Jul 8 20:52:10 2015 UTC,"You love how floaty and slippery it is? To me it controls like when you're trying to catch a fuzzy piece of cotton floating in the air. I know some people feel like Donkey Kong Country is the exact opposite where DK feels heavy and it's not preferable to some, but I'd rather have that than a game that's super floaty and I don't feel like I have control over my character.   In my opinion the platformers that have done movement the best are SMB1, SMB3, SMW, DKC: Returns and Tropical Freeze, Super Meat Boy, and Rayman Legends."

Rosetta in JP, US changes it to Rosalina as it is a pleasant sounding name (Spanish-America keeps it as it can be easily used as well).  EU Spanish goes back to 'galactic' theme and Estela.  French did their own thing with Harmony.  I like Italy's interpretation: Rosalinda, meaning beautiful Rose.  OH! If you haven't seen it, check out the Game Theory about Rosalina, he puts in some work with the science and makes it feel like it kinda makes a bit of sense... There are two parts, but it is well worth it."
Mario,3bqjb4,MogMcKupo,4,Wed Jul 1 16:11:14 2015 UTC,It makes sense if you follow the VERY flawed logic that Rosalina NEEDS to be connected to main characters biologically. And completely disregard everything else.
Mario,3bqjb4,henryuuk,2,Wed Jul 1 20:23:40 2015 UTC,"Game Theories does this on the regular (Portal <3 boxes are old test subjects), shaky at best, but entertaining all the least.  Rosalina became my favorite female Nintendo girl after Galaxy, until LBW introduced Helga."
Mario,3bqjb4,MogMcKupo,5,Wed Jul 1 20:33:48 2015 UTC,"To be exact, game theory makes theories that are clearly wrong of unliekly at best, and uses emotional tricks and ignoring all counter evidence to sell it to his viewers, with the help of having a very high and nice production value to his videos.    It's either that, or explaining 'theories' that are written out by the game itself pretty much"
Mario,3bqjb4,henryuuk,2,Wed Jul 1 20:44:30 2015 UTC,"wrong or correct, they are highly enjoyable and put a different spin on the whole outlook.  Like Dark Side of the Moon and Wizard of Oz"

Mario,3bqjb4,Luigimario280,1 point,Wed Jul 1 17:04:37 2015 UTC,Probably because Rosalina isn't a real name
Mario,3bqjb4,cheat-master30,3,Wed Jul 1 13:39:35 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but neither is ""Toad"" or ""Peach"", it'd make sense for Nintendo to apply the same logic to them.  In French, Peach could have easily be translated to ""Pêche"" or anything else."

Mario,3bkoqx,P_Figgy_95,7,Tue Jun 30 00:30:16 2015 UTC,It's a toss-up between Super Mario RPG and Paper Mario TTYD.
Mario,3bkoqx,rastephens426,3,Tue Jun 30 00:33:56 2015 UTC,Paper Mario with M&L: PiT as a close second.
Mario,3bkoqx,Rica_Patin,3,Tue Jun 30 04:01:50 2015 UTC,"Paper Mario 64, I have a lot of fond memories of this game."
Mario,3bkoqx,Dogarsx,3,Tue Jun 30 05:33:49 2015 UTC,"The Thousand Year Door, no contest."
Mario,3bkoqx,henryuuk,2,Tue Jun 30 08:42:04 2015 UTC,"Paper Mario 64, although SMRPG is a close second."

Mario,3bkoqx,Presto99,1 point,Tue Jun 30 07:02:13 2015 UTC,"Super Mario RPG, but Super Paper Mario very much too! As no one else mentioned that one, Mario and Luigi must be really good."
Mario,3bkoqx,VTSvsAlucard,1 point,Tue Jun 30 04:26:02 2015 UTC,Super Mario RPG. It's one of my all time favorite games.
Mario,3bkoqx,SuperCashBrother,1 point,Tue Jun 30 04:33:24 2015 UTC,"I have to say Super Mario RPG, just due to the fact that it was one of the first video games that I owned. Mario RPGs are my favorite types of games, so I have to give some love to PM and PM:TTYD, as well as Superstar Saga. All of them are fantastic games."
Mario,3bkoqx,KaminaGurren,1 point,Tue Jun 30 17:09:19 2015 UTC,"Super Mario RPG, the only one where they're not made of paper and you have people other than Mario & Luigi in your party."

Mario,3bknwx,cheat-master30,1 point,Tue Jun 30 22:05:34 2015 UTC,"No problem.  If I used Gmod myself, I'd find you a Mario 64 style Thwomp model for it.  Just don't know all the model sites for that at the moment..."
