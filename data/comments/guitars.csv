guitars,3e3sqo,inflynnity2000,5,Tue Jul 21 19:06:38 2015 UTC,"Yes but doing it properly requires some math and special equipment as far as pickup winding goes its well known that building your own is the cheapest and best bet but stew Mac seems sells one for 500$ I think. Also you need 40-42 gauge copper wire for pickups. There is no ""complete"" pickup making guide that I have found but there is info out there just takes a little digging"
guitars,3e3sqo,Hunterlanier03,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:01:18 2015 UTC,cool so as long as I buy the same magnets as a pickup with the desired tone and wind it well I will get the same tone? There's no fancy gadget or hidden step which allows the big manufacturers to get the really clean/nice tones?
guitars,3e3sqo,Hunterlanier03,2,Tue Jul 21 22:06:27 2015 UTC,You would need the same gauge of wire and the same number of coils around the pick up. So if you have access to that knowledge then by all means yes. The variables for tone in pick ups is A. Number of coils in the pup B. Gauge of wire used C. Type of Magnets used   This is also assuming that you can coil the pickup neatly and have tight coil that is of quality. Another note is that pickup coil need to be coated in a type of wax (I don't remember which type) that makes the pickup not microphonic.
guitars,3e3sqo,Hunterlanier03,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:11:10 2015 UTC,"Yea heard that stops feed back. Thanks that's helped a bunch, will look online for that info then. If the magnets are probably the most expensive parts and they're selling some pickups for Â£100+ their margins must be insane.I thought their must be another part to the process which was inflating the price."
guitars,3e3sqo,wrongwayjay,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:41:56 2015 UTC,"Your initial investment is deffentaly gonna cost you more then the a set of pickups, but after that you'll be able to make lots of pickups. So its a pretty soild investment. There is a lot more to it then I have said but, if you realy want to wind pickups then you can find the info you need scatted around the web."
guitars,3e3sqo,sambooka,3,Tue Jul 21 23:57:14 2015 UTC,"It can be done. I saw a setup one guy made using a trolling reel, a VCR for counting the winds and an electric drill. He built and repaired guitars in his spare time and fixed appliances for a living. He looked like he fell off of the Grateful Dead's tour bus but he was one smart cookie! Edit: spelling"
guitars,3e3sqo,wrongwayjay,2,Tue Jul 21 21:55:14 2015 UTC,"Getting or making the hardware to wind is the easy part. Getting the materials to make the pick up or a little more difficult if you talk to guys like Jason Lollar they will tell you that it takes a while to find wire with the right type of enamel and slugs with the right proportions of aluminum nickel and cobalt   I wouldn't say hard but the tricky part is learning to actually wind pick up consistently. How you lay the wraps down, whether you're using a scatter pattern and getting the tension consistent when winding the pick up takes years of practice. That's where the fun starts .The key word there is consistently."
guitars,3e3sqo,sambooka,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:54:39 2015 UTC,You are 100% correct on all counts. The setup I saw he used the trolling reel to evenly lay the wire over the magnets and the the VCR was to count the number of wraps. I have no idea how he made it all work and I didn't get to see the process of setting up the pup before winding. It isn't something I would undertake.
guitars,3e3sqo,wrongwayjay,2,Wed Jul 22 02:08:15 2015 UTC,I have two kids so I can't really find the time to get it done. I have a school in a couple of P90 kits a bunch of old dead pick ups that have accumulated over the years and the magnetic odometer for bicycle that I can use to count the wraps. Someday they will all come together and I will have a little bit of fun.

Wire size, number of windings, slug metal type, type of magnet used are really all you can adjust starting out with readily available parts, full custom could get into string spacing, coil spacing, bars, rails, half rails, etc., etc.  The winding pattern also affects tone, obviously polarity needs to be addressed.  I would get a winder and then take a pickup I was shooting for to customize and then I would unwind it (hopefully the winder runs in reverse, or just use the pickup as the feeding reel) and take careful notes of the winding pattern, number of windings, magnet type and anything else I could think of."

There are stereotypical niches they fall into, like the Tele being for country but honestly they can all be used for diverse genres of music. In terms of tone, you have to go with a stratocaster, honestly i personally dislike the tele tone, the jazzmaster is a little bit dirtier than the other two if you like a sound like that. Of the 3 telecasters have the best sustain, but sustain doesnt really mean anything if you are using the right effects/pedals. In the end, just get what feels comfortable to you man!"

guitars,3drxbb,wrongwayjay,2,Sun Jul 19 00:47:50 2015 UTC,"From the comments, I am leaning toward the Melody Maker at the moment. I actually didn't know the model existed until yesterday. I was always a great fan of the vintage versions of it since Carl Barat from The Libertines played it, but of course in those years it was a long-ago discontinued model, let alone a Gibson, that I had no chance of affording. Now it's back, with P-90s, that beautiful easy to wield body, and a neck pick-up. I love its simplicity.  I like the Epiphone Casino because I've always wanted a semi-acoustic... and p-90s. And I've liked the sound I've heard musicians using it produce. My second (and now only) Electric guitar is an Epiphone Les Paul Custom that I bought around 2009 so I've got faith in the brand."
guitars,3drxbb,wrongwayjay,1 point,Sun Jul 19 11:11:40 2015 UTC,The Epiphone is decent brand. I have 5 of their guitars and no complaints. If I had to choose one I would go do for the MM. It is an all around great guitar and because it is a Gibson it will hold its value. But then again the Riveara has an extra a pup and that sweet Bigsby B70.

guitars,3dma79,Dreddlocks,2,Fri Jul 17 21:22:35 2015 UTC,You should probably consider getting a amp stand of some sort. Having your amp just sit on the floor like that means that most of the best sounds are just hitting your ankles.
guitars,3dma79,StarTrekMike,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:42:48 2015 UTC,Really? Even for large amps like that one?
guitars,3dma79,Dreddlocks,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:33:20 2015 UTC,"Yup, I have owned several amps that are a fair bit bigger than that one and the sound difference between having it on the floor and having it up and aimed at your head (like a amp stand does) is pretty dramatic.  When on the floor, the amp will sound muffled, you will find that you end up turning it up louder than it really needs to be and you end up jacking the treble higher than you normally would need to. You will have much better results if you get a amp stand. It will be like a whole new amp in some ways.  Seriously, it's a huge difference."

guitars,3dhhkm,ElBeartoe,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:28:36 2015 UTC,Yeah a pedal. It would probably help but it would be more like a band-aid than a solution. The behind a compressor working here is to even out the dynamics and not have your high end over power your low strings. It's pretty hard to get metal rhythm out of a strat

guitars,3datp7,sambooka,1 point,Wed Jul 15 00:11:09 2015 UTC,btw looking at the amps.. if they havent been used in a few decades then no.. do not plug them in.  You probably wont get shocked unless you plug in and hold a guitar with your feet in water or on bare concrete or touch a microphone or something.  But after years of disuse caps dry up and can fail if they are suddenly powered up. A good amp tech will power it up slowly with a variac and keep an eye on the voltages/redplating tubes etc.  After that they WILL need maintenace to be running. Electrolytic caps changed and a 3 prong installed. Then they are actually pretty good amps (I think harp players like them more than guitar players) but jazz guitarist looking for that hairy Charlie Christian tone would love them too.

guitars,3d9ca6,psychodreamr,2,Tue Jul 14 19:49:08 2015 UTC,"I couldn't agree more.  I've recently (about a month ago) tried to get back into guitar. I was a teenager the first time I tried to learn; my parents paid for a year of lessons, but due to a mix of ADHD and general teenage apathy, I just couldn't stick to it.  For the last decade, I regretted selling my guitar for weed money, but still thought I was incapable of learning. About a month ago there was a big flea market/yard sale in my neighborhood and I impulse bought a strat knockoff for 50 euro.   While searching for methods of amplifying the guitar through my laptop just after buying the guitar, I learned about and bought Rocksmith 2014.  When I gave up on the guitar 13 years ago, I could hardly even play chords. In the month that I've been playing rocksmith, I have learned more than from the months of lessons I had when I was younger.   I've heard that rocksmith is the best way to learn guitar. Maybe it's not true for everyone, but I am 100% certain that it is the best way for me.   I used to be a pretty hardcore gamer, but I have barely touched LoL since getting Rocksmith. There's just so much to do.  The Guitarcade is amazing; one of the hardest things about rocksmith is looking at the screen and playing the correct notes. The guitarcade helps so much with developing the skills necessary to play without looking at your neck.  shit, I'm rambling.  TLDR If Rocksmith 2014 is half as good for learning bass than it is for guitar, It is a wonderful means to learn and keep you from losing interest. 60 bucks/euro is a HUGE bargain for all of the features that come with that game."

guitars,3d7asc,SignatureStorm,1 point,Tue Jul 14 22:05:51 2015 UTC,I use the Dunlop tortex yellows. I like tear shaped picks. They just feel better for me. I picked up a Hufschmid Big Red Drop and that is amazing to use. Depending on a certain attack i'm looking for i'll switch between the two.
guitars,3d7asc,MattUpchuck,1 point,Wed Jul 15 08:55:01 2015 UTC,My pick of choice is an aluminium one.   The sound is much sharper but the downside is that they wear down and leave your hands covered in what looks like glitter. Wipe your sweating forward and you end up looking like Ziggy Stardust.  A good quality one is worth trying out even if just for recording.

PRS is hard to beat on looks alone and they have a few single cut models, but if you're looking for a hardtail check out an older Custom 22 if you like the Custom shape."

If you don't like how your Les Paul feels and/or sounds, then maybe it is time to try something else. I've grown to dislike what Gibson has become, but my SG and Les Paul are going nowhere anytime soon. I just have no interest in buying anything from the current line up.  ESP/LTD have peaked my interest lately. I might give them a go sometime."

guitars,3d1yys,SydM107,2,Sun Jul 12 21:40:25 2015 UTC,"As others have said you need to make sure the pickup cavity and pickguard is routed for a humbucker. Or alternatively you can get a single-coiled sized humbucker.   As for the neck you'll have to measure the neck pocket to make sure it is standard Strat size (56x76mm and 16mm deep). If it is any Strat replacement neck should fit.  And as for pickups, they can get expensive. Some cheaper brands that people say are good are GFS, Tonerider, or even Fender pickups aren't too expensive. I got a set of Fender Tex Mex pickups for about $60. Or, if you are feeling adventurous, they are quite a simple design, as you said. You could make your own. They're just magnet pole pieces with copper wire wound around them. If you do your research you could probably learn how to make them. if you feel up for it."

guitars,3d1yys,Simplefly,1 point,Mon Jul 13 03:50:13 2015 UTC,To replace the neck pickup you'll have take the pickguard off and see if the cavity is routed for a humbucker. Also you'll have to route or replace the pickguard to fit a humbucker. Normally that wouldn't be a problem but in you case that pickguard like it's one of a kind and you won't be finding a premade one haha   The neck should be a standard neck & simple enough to replace. Unscrew it & put the new one on. Just make sure you get one with the same pocket measurements

guitars,3d2gu2,Zekiniza,1 point,Mon Jul 13 00:25:51 2015 UTC,"I'd say if your buying new, know exactly what you want, and got the cash for it then go for it. Just be sure to hold it for a bit before you take it out of the store. I see that you said you don't know how to play and that's fine, get your hand around the neck, make sure you can reach all six strings with all four fingers all the way up and down. The neck (past like the 19th fret that'll start getting hard anyway so don't worry too much up there). Squeeze the neck and make sure your hand doesn't cramp up too fast on it. If it does look for a skinnier neck. But also remember that it's your first guitar and it doesn't have to be perfect and hell if you get good on something that is uncomfortable then just imagine how good you'll be on something that fits you."

I played it about 10Minutes, and even with the rusty strings and the pickups setup weird (the neck is way to far off) it was just a blast to play. The preowner has mounted a pair of SD Jazz and Hot Rodded, not sure however about the zebra look. Love the color of the guitar however.    Anyways, wanted to share this with you guys.

Before that he was rocking the G&L ASAT for a little bit.  Also he uses his own custom made  whammy bar called the Jake Blade which is an awesome idea.  Basically a whammy bar shaped to your palm and it has more surface area so it more evenly adjusts the pitch when in use."

I designed it to keep my guitar tone intact. EQ can be switched off. No tubes, all high quality solid-state. The pre-amp runs on almost 40 volts, while the lateral MOSFET power stage runs on 80 Volts, putting out about 45 Watts clean and soft clips beyond that to a maximum of about 68 Watts. The laterals are mounted on a big heat sink for reliability, but have self protective properties by nature. I use a sensitive Beyma speaker that can handle 250 Watts.

Their flagship, since Slash put it back on the map, has been the Les Paul, and it gave them a huge resurgence in their product line overall. But they've done nothing but drive it into the ground. They've shown zero interest in what the customers want.  They may be able to ride this wave a little longer. But it's close to the tipping point where all the real money is going to be in the used market, as people increasingly don't want the new models, and clamor for the pre-shit models. And that does nothing for Gibson.  This is nothing new though. This is a company with a long and storied history of making horrible decisions, and poorly run internal workings.

This looks like innovation and experimentation to me. Can or should a guitar company make the same exact guitar for decade after decade?

guitars,3cmg1z,danny29812,2,Thu Jul 9 01:53:23 2015 UTC,"I've spent like an hour trying to write out an answer, but it just ends up being very convoluted and confusing, so I've just ended up scrapping my first few attempts. This isn't a question you can really answer simply, but I'll do my best.  Changing your guitars tuning to something other than the standard EADGBe is going to mean you will sound out of tune when playing with others, unless they also tune to the same thing. You could re-learn songs by adapting the chords to the tuning, but it sort of defeats the purpose (difficult to explain without physically demonstrating what I mean by showing you on a guitar)  Tuning down isn't really going to technically make your guitar sound darker, but it might make it sound more heavy (this is one of those things where it can get complicated to explain as everyone has their own interpretation of dark, heavy and all the other words we use to describe the sound of our guitars).  Chaning string gauge to something thicker might give you a tiny bit darker tone, but you could easily just adjust your amp a fraction and get a fairly similar result (depending on amp/guitars and many other things). Here is a video test of 8s VS 11s. In my experience, using a thicker gauge of string is more suited when you want to tune to a lower tuning like C# tuning or something.  The short answer is, tuning isn't really the first thing you should be looking at to get a darker tone. Your amp is probably the first thing. Then maybe pickups and guitar etc."

Another VERY important point is the electronics and the pots you have in there will be shitty so Alpha pots are standard on Both Fender and Gibson guitars and will do the job fine if you have a little more monet i'd go for CTS pots way better. Also get pots 500K for  humbuckers, its just guitar law at this point. Good luck dude i know theres a lot out there but quality is honestly in the brands, custom stuff can be very hit and miss"

It is also not something I would advise doing unless you   A) have solid knowledge of how to level and dress frets.   B) can get your neck straight using the truss rod (you'll want a notched straightedge)  You will also get benefit of having a soldering iron to heat the frets before removing them and some ground down snips to get under and remove them. Clamps to deal with any high frets, a good neck rest for during hammering/clamping,superglue etc.  Its pretty involved, but given the expense of getting it done at a shop I would give it a try if the guitar isn't worth too much."

guitars,3cd0bx,Dalek_to_the_face,5,Mon Jul 6 23:20:26 2015 UTC,"When you tightened the nut, you may have allowed the whole pot to twist. This can strain the wires going to the pot and either break a solder joint or create a contact point where two wires that didn't previously touch now do, creating a short.  Typically, if you do something to a pot and what happened to you happens, this is the reason.  It could be that loosening the nut and rotating the pot back to it's original orientation might fix the issue.  I would suggest taking off the control cavity cover and looking at from the back first to see if the wires are twisted around. If so, loosen the nut, rotate the pot back and then test. If this fixes it, tighten the nut while still having the back open and hold the body of the pot so it won't rotate.  If you broke a connection, you get to practice your soldering skills!!!! (Or take it in to a tech. I prefer to do these things myself but saner people than me just want to play the damn thing.)  Ninja Edit: If you pulled on a wire, the break could be on the other end, so don't just check the pot; check the switch or the output jack, etc."

guitars,3c6pf8,hero3670,9,Sun Jul 5 10:32:36 2015 UTC,"First of all,  any body style can be used for pretty much any genre of music.   What matters is the rest of the rig (amp, pedals, pickups) and more importantly, the player.  I would highly recommend going to a store if you have one nearby so you can play some instruments and find out what you like.   As for your last question, an Explorer can work as can any of the entry level Jackson dinkys, Ibanez RG, or LTD."
guitars,3c6pf8,Thedirtyone522,6,Sun Jul 5 12:11:51 2015 UTC,"You can pretty much play any style of music on any guitar. I can play Jazz on a Dean, I can play death metal on an ES-335.  There are two main types of ""electric"" guitar. A Solidbody (Les Paul, Strat, Tele, SG, Explorer etc.) and a Hollow Body (ES-355, Gretsch Electromatic etc.). There are plenty of exceptions too, such as Thinline Teles, Hollow Body Les Pauls and chambered/weight relieved guitars. When it comes to guitars like an Explorer or Les Paul, the pickups are going to be the biggest contributors to the sound. If you have an Explorer and Les Paul with the same pickup, they are going to sound very similar, but not identical. The small difference in sound is going to be coming from things like the woods used and the construction methods. If you have two absolutely identical Explorers (which is unlikely as one piece of wood is always a little or a lot different than another) with two completely different pickups (such as one having an EMG and the other having a single coil), they are going to sound pretty different.  At the end of the day, if you like the look, feel and sound of the explorer, then go for it. Epiphone is a solid brand.  There is one thing I should mention though. A Good guitar through a bad amp will sound bad. A bad guitar through a good amp will sound good. A Good guitar through a good amp will sound great. Make sure you pair that Explorer with a decent amp, whether it be now or later on down the line. You wont regret it (although your wallet may)."

I personally think that you should start out on a acoustic but that's not my place to tell you :) also I recommend going to a guitar store instead of buying one online. It's way better to go to a store then buying it because you get to feel which one you like and you get to hear how it sounds. If you are worried of the price being higher in stores, wait until a sale come through. Like Guitar Center has some awesome deals around memorial day and the 4th of july. I got my acoustic guitar for only $99 dollars on memorial day! Hope that helped a little bit but definitely suggest you don't buy it online and try to see if a local music or guitar center has it then go to the store and see how it feels.

I personally really like epiphone guitars and they tend to run on the cheaper side but they still sound good and are built well. Really what you should look into though is the type of pick ups you think you'd want. The body of an electric does nothing for sound---it's all in the electronics. Single coil, humbucker, p90, etc. my black beauty had humbuckers and i mainly played Alllman brothers band--more bluesy type stuff on it--but then I had a distortion pedal to make it rocky when I wanted. So that's another option you could look into is getting a pedal to go along with a cheaper guitar to make it sound the way you want."

guitars,3c3ov5,wikisomnia,1 point,Sat Jul 4 14:43:28 2015 UTC,"I might be completely wrong, but I think it may not be the scale length you prefer, but rather how far away the nut of the guitar is on the Strat in comparison. Try sitting down with the Strat and take note of where the 12 fret is in comparison to your feet/legs/the floor. Grab the Les Paul and compare where the 12th fret is. I prefer my SG because although the scale length is the same, the nut is further away from me so it means that I have easier access to the middle of the fretboard. My SG actually has better access than my Strat and feels longer.  Again, I might be wrong, you might just prefer the slightly larger fretting area."
guitars,3c3ov5,BionicSammich,1 point,Sat Jul 4 19:48:39 2015 UTC,I play an SG and never thought of that - but you are absolutely right.  Id does make the middle of the neck more accessible.

guitars,3bznxv,MB617,6,Fri Jul 3 13:32:31 2015 UTC,"Learning to tune by ear is also a necessary skill to develop.   Another tip, though, if you must use an electronic tuner: Play the 12th fret harmonic on the high E string, rather than the open string. Tuners seem to pick that up better."
guitars,3bznxv,baldylox,6,Fri Jul 3 22:10:50 2015 UTC,"It's almost always better to tune by ear when your not playing professional.  It helps build your sence of tone and pitch and it will help you recognize the notes, making it much easier to learn a song by ear.  However, if you really want to use a digital tuner I would recommend getting one which doesn't go off of 'string' but rather one which goes off of notes.  I started with a finer which only did eadgbe, but it kept me from playing drop D or half step down, since I had grown dependent on the tuner.   Now I use a tuning app on my phone. Any 'tuner' app should work. I use 'Tuner - getting free' but any app which does more than just guitars is fine."

guitars,3by7cd,redditexspurt,2,Fri Jul 3 04:21:04 2015 UTC,Here is a great trick to learning stuff that's really hard. The truth is 99% of the time  you have to be able to play it slow before you can play it fast. Slow your speed down until you've reached a speed where you can play it perfectly. It doesn't matter how slow it is the key is that you are playing all the notes at all the right times. Now play the song 2 or 3 times at this speed. Now speed it up a little more. Repeat process. It's brute force but it's always produced results. Cut things up into pieces.
guitars,3by7cd,kcastun,1 point,Fri Jul 3 07:51:40 2015 UTC,"The best way to get better at chord changes is you change chords a lot. A good way to practice a specific change is to just go back and forth between the two chords a bunch of times quickly, making sure to play the chord each time you switch to make sure it's correct. If you're not having trouble with a specific change, try just playing all of the open chords you know in random order a few times through as quickly as possible.   The key to changing chords quickly is muscle memory, and the best way to develop muscle memory is doing something a bunch of times.   That said, don't get too caught up on drills or practicing changes, the best way to get better at playing chord progressions is by learning songs! Bertha by the grateful dead is a good one to learn as a beginner, it's got a quick g-c-g change that will take some practice and the chorus contains a few very useful chords. Good luck!"

guitars,3bvoya,Hunterlanier03,1 point,Thu Jul 2 17:03:24 2015 UTC,If the stink is going to the left I generally hold my breath and run to the right.
guitars,3bvoya,Tossit999,2,Fri Jul 3 10:11:20 2015 UTC,"Lets use this tuner as an example. If the needle is to the left side you need to tune the string up, if its to the right, you need to tune down. You need to learn which direction you need to turn your guitars tuners in for it to go up and down and memories it.  Even I accidentally tune up instead of down and have to correct it instantly very often and I've been playing for about 10 years.  If the needle is to the left, it doesn't necessarily mean you should turn the tuner to the left. It varies depending on what side of the guitars headstock the tuners are on."

guitars,3btpe7,ggskater,2,Thu Jul 2 01:50:24 2015 UTC,"I built a guitar using Warmoth parts and some Fender and other parts too. There were lots of little things that popped up that caused little issues. Just make sure to plan everything properly and make sure you actually have all the parts (how could I forget the input jack?). I spent months planning everything and deciding what parts to go with. The guitar certainly isn't more dear to me than my beloved SG or Les Paul, but it is 99% of the way into my ""Never sell list""."
guitars,3btpe7,pain-and-panic,1 point,Thu Jul 2 02:39:08 2015 UTC,"Definitely. I have 2 guitars now I'll never get rid of. One being my 87 kramer baretta, and the other my '80 gibson les paul firebrand."
guitars,3btpe7,norby2,1 point,Thu Jul 2 03:20:56 2015 UTC,"Honestly I'd advise you to start with something without a Floyd. For a first build it adds a lot of complexity. Also if you don't get a neck that's already built for a locking nut then you have to shave it yourself which is tricky and if you mess it up, you mess up the neck. I've 'restored' a guitar with a failed Floyd rose install and it wasn't easy.   If you are going to use this as a learning experience then go for some less expensive parts. Warmoth and the like provide great quality parts, but you don't want to drill clear through a $200+ neck because you measured wrong or pressed too hard with the drill.  If you want new parts check out guitarfetish and Amazon. The '$15' humbuckers on Amazon are surprisingly good. I've gotten nice maple necks from Amazon also, but they were sized for import neck pockets, not US neck pockets.   Guitarfetish has some good inexpensive parts. I'd stay away from their 'poplar' bodies. They are very light, damage easy and the ones I've bought have felt terrible. The GXP branded necks are much better. I haven't tried the GXP bodies yet....  But the swamp ash hardtail strat look cool.   Another option is to go hunting at goodwill or savers or pawn shops and buy the cheapest guitars you can that still look okay. Then strip them for parts and start trying to build the best guitar you can. When you buy an entire guitar for $30 you won't feel bad if you break something.   Good luck, this has turned into my favorite hobby so be careful it can be addictive."
guitars,3btpe7,pain-and-panic,1 point,Thu Jul 2 04:46:38 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately I agree about not doing a Floyd on the first try.  Drilling the holes in exactly the correct spot for the studs is a bitch.  Even the tech where I take guitars said it's ""hard as hell"".  I have done it though...after plugging the body with pieces of oak to mend my mistakes.  The easiest to build would probably be a Tele. It depends a lot on how much you are willing to spend. You may still need to take it to a tech to get the frets leveled.(they almost never come perfectly leveled).  It's hard to predict if you're gonna end up with a guitar you love or one you don't play.  Just like any guitar."
guitars,3bthcb,Anti-Bullshit_Machin,2,Thu Jul 2 00:38:50 2015 UTC,"It's either anxiety, boredom with what you're doing or lack of inspiration. Take a break. Go do something else. Walk away from it, relax and stimulate yourself with something other than what you've been doing. Change things up if you're locked in a pattern. The more creative you are in other things and the more input you take in from new things you've never done the more fuel you'll have for your playing."
guitars,3bthcb,ziddersroofurry,1 point,Thu Jul 2 01:46:15 2015 UTC,"Use a variety a different methods to write songs. The same one can get old pretty quick. For example, one way is to look at lyrics and try to play something that fits. Another is to think of an emotion, some images, and just play what you feel. String together random notes and add rhythm, then stick within that key."

But the Peavey looks a little nicer, and it has a double cutaway. I could never really get used to playing a Les in the upper register because of it being a single cutaway. The Peavey really offers a nice blend a Strat(ish)-style shape and fretboard access with the looks of the Les Paul. Both are very nice."
guitars,3blktp,joeguitargod,1 point,Wed Jul 1 02:28:36 2015 UTC,"That's is exactly the reason I bought the Peavey. Its double cutaway makes reaching the high notes much easier.

Drawbacks to a semi-hollow that I can think of are the size and the possibility of feedback if you're playing stuff with a lot of gain. Benefits include not always needing an amp and that sweet, silky tone. It's a give and take. In some ways a semi might be more versatile than a solid body, and in some ways it might be less. I know that's oxymoronic. Are you interested playing jazz? Rock? Blues? That could make an impact. If it's dope and it makes you happy, that's all you really need in your first electric."

guitars,3bl27c,mrjaguar1,2,Tue Jun 30 03:16:31 2015 UTC,"Get a used 50+ watt tube head and 4x12 cabinet. Probably not a Marshall head at that price but there are a lot of decent alternatives out there. Try to grab a Marshall cab if possible no matter how beat up it is but that may be overly optimistic. You may also need an dirt pedal of some sort.  There are always people looking to downsize their rigs, it's the circle of life. Those things are heavy if you're moving them a lot.  A 30+ watt tube combo would work fine too, but I never feel quite right about playing metal without moving a lot of air. There's something special about a loud tube amp and a 4x12 cabinet for the genres you're talking about."
guitars,3bl27c,Maskatron,1 point,Tue Jun 30 04:51:56 2015 UTC,"Maybe one of these. Marshall DSL40C, DSL15C, DSL5C (a real gem), Marshall SL-5. I've played all of those excluding the DSL15C. The DSL5C really is a gem. It sounds surprisingly good, but its terrible in the demos. Might not be great for turning up loud with its speaker, but you could always replace it with something better (Probably recommend that for all the DSL Combos really).  5 watts is also probably a lot louder than you'd expect. My little JCM1C packs a punch. My Marshall YJM100 packs a roundhouse kick to the nuts even when its only set at 12 watts. Thats partly to do with the speakers though.  Give those amps a try in a store if you can. Its never a great idea to buy an amp without hearing it in person first if possible."

guitars,3bijq2,DeltaJuliett,5,Mon Jun 29 18:20:31 2015 UTC,"Try to find a local teacher that you like, even having a few lessons in person with someone will give you a big head start compared to trying to figure it out yourself. And pick out a few songs that you'd like to learn that have basic chord progressions and work on those until your finger tips aren't sore any more and the songs start to sound like real songs!"
guitars,3bijq2,PAF_67,3,Mon Jun 29 16:35:40 2015 UTC,Learn as many chords as you can early on. Get a program that will be able to read tab and play it. Guitar pro is common but not free. I use tux guitar and that one is. Look for videos to make it play .gpx files. Make sure the strings aren't crazy high. I had a no acoustic that was badly setup. I felt like I didn't have the strength to make bar chords and got discouraged. Learn as many songs all the songs you can. Use proper posture when playing. I played a crap ton sitting down and slouched.. bad move. Especially since I'm a desk monkey. Learn to play standing early as possible. And this isn't required but get a track ball mouse and a keyboard that doesn't mess with your hands. That will  prevent any wrist injury. No type of music is too good for you. Learn to play music that you hate.
guitars,3bijq2,PM_ME_UR_SINCERITY,2,Mon Jun 29 16:46:26 2015 UTC,"Learn to read standard notation, not tab, from the beginning. I wish that I had never started with tab when I compare the difficulty of un-learning it  to my experience on the piano (where tab is not an option). Your resources and ability to play with others will greatly expand as a result of learning standard notation. Also, make practicing with a metronome or backing track a habit from the beginning."
guitars,3bijq2,real_rob_gordon,3,Mon Jun 29 16:54:53 2015 UTC,I was in band from 7th grade through college so I'm pretty decent at reading standard notation but the downside is that I played the Tuba lol
guitars,3bijq2,Maskatron,2,Mon Jun 29 17:01:08 2015 UTC,"First rule: Have fun. If you're not enjoying yourself, you won't keep up with it. Learn music you love and play it loud when you're feeling it.  Work on full songs, not just riffs. That's what we do, play songs. It seems really difficult at first to link all those parts together, but it gets so much easier the more you do it.  Learn lyrics and sing along as much as you can, no matter how good or bad your voice is. Even if you never sing one note on stage, it gets your muscle memory working for you and you'll learn to separate your attention and play without thinking about it. Also if you ever want to attract that girl/guy you're into, singing them a song is way more effective than playing a guitar accompaniment.  Practice looking away from the fretboard. It's easier than it seems to play without looking. You'll want to be able to look out at the crowd, or navigate around the patched hole on the stage, or stare into your lover's eyes while you serenade them."
guitars,3bijq2,kingbhudo,1 point,Tue Jun 30 00:16:05 2015 UTC,"I'd just suggest letting your music taste guide you toward what to play. Obviously, you're not going to become Steve Vai overnight, but if you look for lessons within the styles you enjoy, it'll be a little easier to keep at it during that first tough couple of months. It's supposed to be fun, so spend your time on simple stuff that will give you a sense of satisfaction before you start grinding away on the really regimented learning. A few little riffs and things that you can pick up fairly quickly will keep the motivation going!"
guitars,3bijq2,satanparty,1 point,Mon Jun 29 15:28:11 2015 UTC,"Learn all the standard chords and find a variation of each that sounds good and comfortable to you and play them until your fingers bleed. Everyday, until you enjoy it. From there, just watch some youtube videos of guys who you think sound good and go with the flow. Also, change all your strings every couple months even if none of them break. Its great practice and it helps you stay sounding good, and build a lasting relationship with your guitar. Final advice, do not play djent as a serious musician."

guitars,3bgzby,Guitarguy44,8,Mon Jun 29 03:29:52 2015 UTC,"Do it often, and don't give a shit. The jitters often is from sort of fear, because you feel you have to get it right, because it really matters now. But after a while, and after some fuckups you realize that the worst that can happen is you make a mistake, and so what? The worst has happened to you already, and it really wasn't that bad. If you have a laugh it off, oh well philosophy I find it is easier.  That you can just play, not worried of messing up, or missing a lyric, or anything like that, you just cover it up, pretend it didn't happen, and keep going.   It's like g a bike, if you're tentative and worried about falling, you go real slow, trying not to hurt yourself, which is the hardest way to ride a bike, so you fall. But if you just go with confidence, and no fear of falling, the bike stays up easily. You don't focus on not falling, but where you're going, instead.   So it's lack of fear of messing up. Just accept that you will sometimes, and it doesn't matter. Just like playing for yourself."

A thing that I do that helps me when I get jitters, I try to forget about the crowd (I know it's cliche but it helps!) now how you do that... That's the part that is hard.

A lot of the time, you're the only person that is aware of some of the mistakes you make.  The key is that you're performing and the crowd isn't, so who cares what they think?  Go up and do your thing; you're biggest critic will always be yourself.  Then when you're old enough, whiskey helps :p"
guitars,3bgzby,GALACTICA-Actual,1 point,Mon Jun 29 12:24:46 2015 UTC,"Congratulations on your first gig! I guarantee you that nobody here had a mistake-free night their first time in front of an audience.  A big part of it is just doing it more. You get used to places, people, bandmates, and it all gets easier. Some stages feel like home to me now.  Another part of the issue is realizing what it really means to know a song. I've heard you don't really know a song until you can play it through three times in a row without one mistake. I'm not sure that's exactly true, but the idea behind it is absolutely correct.  Gigs are distracting, chaotic events. It's so easy to get thrown off your game. If when learning a song you work it just a bit harder, it will pay off with an easier sense of comfort onstage."
guitars,3bgzby,ikilledtupac,1 point,Tue Jun 30 00:46:48 2015 UTC,"It's like any new activity or experience: It takes time to get used to it, to become comfortable in the new environment.  Your first fight, your first time having sex, your first time playing with other people, your first time in front of a live audience, (the dead ones rarely give you a negative reaction,) you get that rush of adrenalin. Your brain suddenly stops functioning correctly, your voice goes up an octave and words come out sounding like you've got just did 12 shots of Jack, and your hands shake.  Joey Alves, the original rhythm guitarist for Y&T gave me some of the best advice ever about being on stage when you're starting out or just feeling overwhelmed. He would focus on the lighted EXIT signs at the back of the room. It let him get into his head space, and not be self-conscious about people looking at him. And to the audience he simply was in the zone, completely comfortable with what he was doing.  Then eventually, he was one of the most animated guys on stage in rock.  It's okay to fuck-up. It happens to everyone. Even the biggest of the big. Music is organic, and therefor subject to imperfection. And it is never more organic than in a live setting. It's why performances run the full spectrum, from the most amazing thing you've heard to it really sucking sometimes.  Keep this in the back of your head: When you first picked-up your guitar you sucked at it. Then you got to the stage where you were really comfortable and played well in your room. Then you started jamming with people, and it was rough until it got better.  This is just the next step in your progression as a player."

Good luck mastering an album in iOS GarageBand and actually selling anything on your first attempt knowing hardly anything.  Odds are probably better that you will be struck by lightning and attacked by a shark on the same day.  Don't let me discourage you though, shoot for the moon.  My recommendation though, get a real DAW.  Reaper is a great choice for a beginner since it is really powerful and dirt cheap."

I checked Craigslist, Ebay, and lastly guitar center. It was on sale for 370 with a gig bag. I couldn't believe it. I've always wanted a Gibson Sg but never thought I'd b able to afford one. So instead of getting a back up  guitar, I ended up getting my new number one. It has a few scratches and places where the paint chipped, but its 10 years old so that's to be expected. Anyways, I went to Walmart and bought a paint sharpie and used it, and now it looks perfect. I love this  guitar. It's insanley powerful, has amazing action, great harmonics, and never goes out of tune. It is the best guitar I have ever played. I love it."

The good news for you is that this is a black guitar and the easiest to patch as far as color matching goes. From a foot away you  might be able to tell, anymore than that and it will look alright.  Just mix a drop or two of black pen ink with some super glue and carefully fill the gap with it and use a razor to carefully scrape it flush. You could use black nail polish, but it will show a little more. It is also a good idea to use a new razor without any flaws in it."

guitars,3bcedq,Judiciary_Pag,3,Sat Jun 27 21:58:33 2015 UTC,"Learning jazz guitar as a complete beginner will be tough, I'll tell you that. A lot of jazz guitar playing finds its roots in taking more traditional (read: basic) theory and expanding upon it, adding sevenths and ninths and so fourth (that was a pun). I would seriously consider taking time to work on rudimentary theory and technique before moving on, you don't want to end up frustrated. I might suggest looking into lessons. Find someone with a jazz background who could work with you on building the basic fundamentals while simultaneously laying the groundwork for theoretical expansion. You don't want to be sitting there learning hot cross buns forever, but I feel like jumping into weird (cool) shit right from the start is a good way to put a bad taste in your mouth.  About Experimental technique: experimenting (on anything, guitar included) comes from a removal from and progression of fundamental concepts. Learn those. Watch YouTube videos on theory and technique, take lessons. There's no shortcut to innovation.  I played one of those jazzmasters a while back, but don't remember much. It seemed nice. It has those huge soap-bar pickups. Make sure you put your hands on it before you buy it. Touch it, play it, check for build quality. Go play a lot of guitars.  I don't play much of those genres, but maybe look into some reverb or delay type effects. They'll help you get those sweet rhythms and that far-out, ambient tone.  Cheers, and good luck."
guitars,3bcedq,Judiciary_Pag,1 point,Sat Jun 27 22:36:53 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the response. When you say i I should learn ""rudimentary theory and technique"", you mean in the context of Jazz or guitar in general? If so, would a Fakebook help? Again, thanks for the response."
guitars,3bcedq,Judiciary_Pag,2,Sat Jun 27 22:40:36 2015 UTC,"When I talk about the basics, I mean things such as major and minor chords and their respective sets of voicings, basic scales (major, minor, dorian, pentatonic, etc). These are your building blocks, from which everything that makes something edgy, or jazzy, or bluesey, stems from. I mean you could start right out learning the voicings for jazz chords, but it's my personal opinion that you should probably learn why you're doing them in the first place, i.e. where they come from in terms of being expansions on what we might consider 'simpler' or more 'basic' theoretical structures.  The same goes for rhythms, too. It's going to be hard to play a good swing feel, or a triplet feel, or odd time signatures if you haven't yet become accomplished with basic rhythms in 4/4 or 3/4 time.  A fake book is going to give you the notes, and give you the names of the chords. It won't teach you how to play them of course, but I think it could a) give you something to practice that is consistent with what you're interested in and get your fingers used to those specific shapes and b) give you an idea of how those things fit together in real life and on paper. It could be a fun choice."

guitars,3bcedq,mrjaguar1,2,Sun Jun 28 01:11:00 2015 UTC,"1 The J Mascis and even the vintage modified jazzmaster are great guitars , the Mascis does have the tremelo closer to the bridge and the pickups are closer to P90's rather then traditional jazzmaster pickups .For a first amp I would suggest one of the fender mustang amps and take a look at the fuse presets  2 Depending on what you mean by experimental music take a look at this link Sonic Youth has tabs for all their songs up on their site  3 See the Sonic Youth tabs above .and their gear guide I am assuming other bands will have something similar online . For pedals I would say maybe a phaser and distortion pedal to start with or a multi effects pedal depending on your amp .  4 For prepared guitars look into what Glenn Branca does and this article  Now I am just using Sonic Youth as an example for avant-garde / weird music since they are one of the innovators of that style of music other bands may be slightly different ."
guitars,3bcedq,mrjaguar1,2,Sat Jun 27 22:40:36 2015 UTC,Thanks for the response. All the links are very useful but I'm still wondering (about question 2.) how to start off with the theory of experimental guitar. Where do I start? In the basics of Jazz or classical?
guitars,3bcedq,mrjaguar1,2,Sat Jun 27 22:50:10 2015 UTC,"Depends how you define experimental guitar , if your talking about stuff the members of Sonic Youth or Glenn Branca play its more change the tunings to either all the same note or go for weird tunings they get different things to play the guitar with or even use your TV remote pointed at the pickups . There really isnt alot of traditional theory for that type of music its more experimenting to see what sounds cool , if a power drill along the strings sounds cool go for that .  If your talking about Nels Cline style music then yes then its based in Jazz ."
guitars,3bcedq,GnomeThrone,2,Sat Jun 27 22:56:24 2015 UTC,"What about something like My Bloody Valentine or Joy Division? Post-Punk, Shoegaze, Noise-Pop and other relative genres?"
guitars,3bcedq,bolanrox,2,Sat Jun 27 23:06:14 2015 UTC,"Shoeglaze has more to do with alot of effects  but check out this video , not sure what post-punk or noise-pop is so I cant answer about those 2 genres . But it seems avant-garde / experimental and shoeglaze are such wide genres that its hard to give an answer for everything in the genre . Like avant-garde  includes Sonic Youth and Nels Cline and the beach boys which are really not that similar except they fit into that genre .   So even within one of those genres you need to narrow it down more and determine what you want to do or learn , some of it has a basis in Jazz , some in rock , some in blues and some is trying to make cool sounds with no real rules at all except you need some kind of an amp and something with strings on it anything else depends on what your going for ."

guitars,3b3fw5,PM_ME_UR_SINCERITY,3,Thu Jun 25 17:32:14 2015 UTC,"Not likely anything to do with the sound holes. Old strings get full of finger gunk, particularly the round-wound low strings. I find the low E string tends to ""deaden"" first on all my guitars. A good set might last a few months of regular, daily playing, then they lose their sparkle. If the low E starts to sound dull and thumpy with weak sustain, I change strings.   Swapping in a new set of strings will usually fix that right up. It's the easiest fix, and strings are cheap. Troubleshooting any problem, you start with the simplest solution and work your way up - if a new set of strings doesn't liven up the sound, start looking for problems at the bridge and the nut. Look for any buildup or fuzz or flat spots. The grooves in the nut should be crisp and clean, the bridge should have no flat spots underneath the strings. If there's a lot of wear, you might get a buzz that can deaden the sound.  If for some reason you are determined to keep that string, try removing it and boiling it in water with a mild detergent. That will lift out some of the dead skin and oils and might brighten the string up a bit. I've done that with old grungy bass strings and gotten mixed results. Might be difficult to re-string afterwards."

guitars,3aycyp,Tossit999,1 point,Wed Jun 24 14:17:12 2015 UTC,You pretty much answered your own question.   Personally I run a Mark V which is a pretty customizable amp as far as tone goes.   My method is to have a sound in my head that I want. Then I play on a higher register first.  If the higher register sounds good then I can work with it. Reason being is I find it easier to tweak the low end. And low end is easier to master than high. afterwords (most times in my experience). Once I come close then I go to mids and presence. Then finally low. Then eq(I have 5 band eq on mine). I document everrryyything. Down to where the knobs are on my guitar and what mode I have the tubes in.
guitars,3aycyp,Conspiracy795,1 point,Wed Jun 24 16:44:06 2015 UTC,Your play style will affect this also. Try to get right on the frets.   A little room between the fret and where your finger lies will create unwanted vibrations.

But what the pedals are set for depends what type of music I am playing and which guitar I am using .

I would never buy a LP new. When it's a good one, there's nothing like it. When it's bad...  They are far over-priced for the quality, and it's why I started buying Epis when I decided to add more LPs to my arsenal. I can buy three Epies for the cost of one used Gibson, five for the cost of a new one,, replace the electronics, put the pickups in that I want, set it up, and it's ready to go.  Also, in comparison: I can pick up almost any Ibanez, even their entry level line, and it'll play like a dream. The same can be said for most of the Fender stuff as well. And for around 1/4 of the price.  Take my opinion for what it's worth coming from an Internet stranger.

guitars,3aslrk,Solomon_Gunn,3,Tue Jun 23 04:26:08 2015 UTC,Just an epiphone Les Paul standard. It's a made in Korea model which is supposedly better than the made in china ones but that's a whole discussion in itself.  I'd sell it for around $300 if I were you. The tuners look nice (similar style as Gibson tuners) and there's straplocks on there so it's nice because it doesn't look like every other epi Les Paul standard out there although it's pretty much the same thing.  The only thing I highly advise you to look at before you sell it is those pickups. The bridge pickup is facing the wrong way and the covers have a different look to them than I'd expect. This leads me to believe that those pickups may be unoriginal (which could be a good thing). So if you're comfortable with removing without messing up your guitar id take a picture of their undersides and just post it so we can confirm whether or not there original

Those two are similar but fairly different. Also, which wattage Tubemeister? If cleans are important to you, neither amp is going to excel, but I think the Tubemeister 36 is going to be a little better. Given the selections, though, I'm not convinced you're looking for crystal-clear cleans. ;)"
guitars,3aphwy,tehjoshers,2,Mon Jun 22 16:21:38 2015 UTC,"Depends on the model of JCM 800. I had a 1982 JCM 800 2204, which is a 50 watt version of the 2203. There is also the 2205 and 2210, which are different to the 2203 and 2204. Then there is the 1959 (and 1987 I think) which are similar to the 70's style 1959 Plexi.  I'm assuming you want to know about a 2203, because thats the most common type of JCM 800 and is currently the only one Marshall makes new. I loved mine, but being an older amp, it had some problems with the Master Volume going up and down by its self making it louder and quieter as I was playing. It sounded absolutely great, but was SUPER LOUD and not really suitable for home use as it goes from bedroom levels at 0.9 on the Master volume to Stadium levels at 1 on the Master. It really takes some fiddling to get it to that sweet spot of not being too loud or too quiet. Having an attenuator can help give you more precise control over the volume. If you've got one that attenuates a lot of dB off, you can open up the Master volume on the amp so it sounds its best.  It wasn't a very versatile amp on its own, same as most of the older design single channel Marshalls. It was able to go clean-ish and it had decent control over the bass, mid and treble, and had a fair bit of gain on tap too. I hear that good pedals go great with a JCM 800 2203.  I don't know much about H&K amps, but I didn't like the one I tried, although I'm pretty sure it wasn't the one you're looking at buying."

guitars,3ano5w,kingjdthegreat,7,Mon Jun 22 00:16:47 2015 UTC,"Put a ton of Warmoth guitars together, always great quality, fit, and finish. There are a couple of things to look out for however-their big two-way truss rod works well but brightens up the tone considerably. If you hold a neck with a traditional one-way rod next to a Warmoth with the modern rod and 'tap"" them (like you would tap-tune a guitar top"" you will hear a considerable difference is sound. The old-style neck will go ""poong"" like a marimba and the modern construction neck will just make a quick ""pank"" with no discernable note. This has a big effect on the tone of the guitar. Fender-style guitars are relatively ""cold"" sounding and when you use a neck with the big truss rod in it you take away a lot of warmpth from an already cold sounding guitar. Obviously this is my very subjective opinion but I can definitely hear the difference in a guitar with their modern neck compared to the traditional construction. Last time I looked at their website they promote the modern two-way rod as ""best"" but make no mention of the tone difference. I have worked with necks that had all of the latest and most ""premium"" features and they have all sounded terrible (e.g. ebony fingerboard, big truss rod, stainless steel frets, graphite nut). It seems great on paper but doesn't sound so good IRL. So..... I recommend the ""total vintage"" or ""vintage modern"" neck construction over the ""Warmoth Pro"". If you like to bend notes go for a taller (over .050"") fret size, if not use 6230 (a little bigger than vintage Fender wire). Their finishing is excellent and way better than the typical guy down at the music store will be able to do. Their satin in particular is very nice. As far as the bodies go totally up to you, I prefer them on the lighter side and don't think weight has much to do with sustain. I've heard that the guy that owns the company can be a dick and there are other good companies too, USA Custom is former Warmoth guys and also make a very good product and MJT(ele) sells finished bodies on ebay that are also very good. Allparts has a line of Japanese made necks and bodies that are less expensive and still very high quality, I have been using them more often lately because they end up being 1/3 less than comparable Warmoth necks and they have all come out very nicely. And of course forget about resale value, if you want a custom guitar do it for yourself for the pride of assembly and ending up with a guitar that's really ""yours""."
guitars,3ano5w,PAF_67,2,Mon Jun 22 01:09:46 2015 UTC,"Plus one, everything this guy said. It's amazing how close you have to stick to the original recipe to get that specific classic sound. If you want it to sound like what you think a Tele sounds like, think long and hard each time you stray from the vintage spec. IMO, taller frets and a flatter radius are totally worth it, but that's about as much as you can cheat before making something that may sound great but won't have ""that"" sound you've heard on your favorite records. Especially true about the truss rod - and nitro is cool, I don't think Warmoth does Nitro on bodies... EDIT to answer the original question and say that Warmoth parts are top shelf and can add up to an amazing guitar."

I did have to do some careful sanding to fit the tuners in place, as thy didn't rout out the holes completely wide enough so I had to widen them ever so slightly, which was a bit of a pain in the ass since the holes got thinner towards one end, so it was hard to sand properly. I had no problems with the neck fitting on or anything like that and every other part of the process went straight forward. You will need some tools on hand and you'll also need a few random other tools that might make things easier.  You should take a look at this video series on building a Warmoth guitar. Not everything is going to apply directly to you, but you might pick up a thing or two. It sure helped me to see the whole process, even if it was taking ages. I skipped over bits that wouldn't apply to me.  No complaints on the finished product, other than me being a moron when doing a few things. I also did it over the course of two evenings without taking any breaks (Take breaks to refresh yourself so you don't end up scratching the back of your headstock like idiot me). Take your time and make sure you go through the whole process of putting it together in your head before doing anything.  Here is what I ended up with, and I'm very happy with it. I was a little disappointed with it at first, as it wouldn't stay in tune very well and didn't sound too good, but after giving it a proper good setup, it turned into a beast. Its exactly what I was going for, a Fender American Standard type guitar, with a few cosmetic extras.  Here is the spec from the order, plus some of the extras I got from other places:    Neck    Style: StratocasterÂ®  Construction: Warmoth Pro Construction  Scale: 25-1/2""  Orientation: Right Handed  Neck Wood: 3A Flame Maple  Fingerboard Wood:   3A Flame Maple  Nut Width: 1-11/16""  Back Shape: Standard thin  Fret Size: 6105  Tuner Ream: Schaller (25/64"" 11/32"")  Radius: Straight 9.5""  Fret #: 22  Mounting Holes: Standard 4 Bolt  Inlays: Abalone Face Dots  Side Dots: Abalone Side Dots  String Nut: GraphTech White TUSQ XL - Standard Nut  Finish: Clear Gloss    Body    Model: StratocasterÂ®  Orientation: Right handed  Scale: 25-1/2""  Wood: Alder  Rout: Top Rout  Pickup Rout: Universal  Controls: None  Bridge: American Standard StratÂ® Tremolo  Jack Rout: StratÂ® Top Jack Rout  Neck Pocket: StratÂ® Shape  Mounting Holes: Standard 4 Bolt  Contours: / Tummy Cut / Forearm Contour  F-Holes: None  Top Finish: Fiesta Red  Back Finish: Fiesta Red  Stud Install: Will mail in inserts to Warmoth    Pickguard    Shape: StratocasterÂ®  Orientation: Right Handed  Colour: White/Black/White  Neck Pickup: StratÂ®  Middle Pickup: StratÂ®  Bridge Pickup:StratÂ®  Control 1: Delonge Vol Position  Control 2: Tone  Control 3: Tone 2  Control 4: 5 Way Switch  Countersink: Standard Countersink  Bridge Cut: Standard Bridge Cut  Mounting Holes: 11 Hole    Trem Cavity Cover    Shape: Trem Cover  Orientation: Right Handed  Colour: White/Black/White  Tremolo Holes: 1 Rectangular Hole    Extras from Warmoth   Gold Neck Plate Gold Top Rout Jack Set of 4 Gold Neck Screws Standard Strap Buttons in Gold Dozen Pickguard Screws in Gold Dozen Blade Switch & Pickup Mounting Screw in Gold 6 Non-Tremolo Bridge Screw in Gold     Other Extras   Fender Gold American Strat Tremolo Fender American Tuners in Gold with Pearloid Buttons Fully loaded Fender American Standard Pickguard (taken from American Standard Strat) with 3 Fat 50's Single Coils, 5 Way Toggle Blade, Master Volume Pot, Tone Pot, No-Load Tone Pot Probably some stuff that I forgot about     Let me know if you have any questions about why I chose any specific part or material."

My tech got very angry because he said nothing at that price should have anything wrong with it.  They weren't real easy to get info out of  when I wanted to put a finish on my neck.  All I needed to know was what would, and would not, react with their finish.  They wouldn't budge."
guitars,3ak30t,zwinged,5,Sat Jun 20 23:44:38 2015 UTC,It's a tele-style Squier bullet 1 from the mid eighties. I've only seen one before in a garage sale.   Here's a bit more info on them:  http://www.strat-talk.com/forum/squier-strat-forum/5745-help-odd-squier.html
guitars,3ak30t,IncoherentMonk,1 point,Sun Jun 21 00:48:20 2015 UTC,Thanks for the info. I've never seen this type of body before. so would you consider it somewhat rare? It plays really great
guitars,3ak30t,IncoherentMonk,1 point,Sun Jun 21 03:18:05 2015 UTC,"They're decently rare, yes. There's not much demand for them, but they stand out well and are generally fun and quirky little guitars."

guitars,3akppo,ShinyAlpaca,1 point,Sun Jun 21 03:46:44 2015 UTC,Can you post a pic?
guitars,3akppo,86n96,1 point,Sun Jun 21 14:39:36 2015 UTC,"Well nobody else has replied so I figured I'd comment. Unfortunately I really don't know too much about pedalboards or what may be your problem. I haven't had this problem, although my drummer friend could possibly help. I can ask him, but without being physically there I can't guarantee anything.  It could be using batteries, if one is low on juice it might be the issue, so try getting AC adapters for all devices. If that still doesn't work I would call or bring the whole setup to a local music shop (a good one, not Music & Arts) and ask them for help. The store I shop at has some really knowledgable and helpful guys there."

You can also put pedals in the preamp if your amp allows it. It's all about what you want to put first."

That's backwards, actually. The performance of the delay is affected by the strength of the signal. The hotter the signal or attack of picking the less the delay affect at the front of the note."
guitars,3akppo,GALACTICA-Actual,1 point,Sun Jun 21 16:15:13 2015 UTC,"Well you're right, but I think what he meant was simply that if one puts a delay before the distortion, the signal (including each individual echo) will be distorted"
