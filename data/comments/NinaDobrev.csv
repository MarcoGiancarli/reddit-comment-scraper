NinaDobrev,3a4k1b,katepauls,1 point,Wed Jun 17 17:11:23 2015 UTC,"Usually her hair looks fantastic, but for some reason it looks a bit odd to me how her bangs are pulled back. Makes her forehead look a little big, especially with the hair on top.  No matter, she still looks fucking bangin'. :D"
NinaDobrev,3a4k1b,TheRipePunani,3,Wed Jun 17 18:00:23 2015 UTC,"Oh she always looks rocking. :)   She just has such potential for something more... Interesting, like a slightly daring bob."

NinaDobrev,34m94q,howyalikdemapples,2,Sun May 3 07:53:35 2015 UTC,I know! I don't believe the story that she planned to move on at this season all along. I think she would've stayed longer if they hadn't broken up.
NinaDobrev,34m94q,kenba2099,3,Sun May 3 11:56:17 2015 UTC,"Yeah, word on the street is Nikki Reed is an awful human being, to the point where she rubs people's faces in her success. If the breakup wasn't it, it could be her hanging around all the time."
NinaDobrev,34m94q,alteransg1,1 point,Sun May 3 15:33:18 2015 UTC,Her contract was for 6 seasons from the beginning whether or not she would've renewed it if things were going well with Ian is anyone's guess. It is a fact however that she wanted to focus on her movie career so basically things just fell into place

NinaDobrev,33bnpn,JammaWho,0,Tue Apr 21 09:25:22 2015 UTC,how did it end?
NinaDobrev,33bnpn,neos1990,5,Tue Apr 21 09:44:22 2015 UTC,TRUE BLOOD FINALE SPOILER The main character (Elena equivalent) ends up helping her boyfriend (Damon equivalent) to kill himself and then she went off and led a normal life with normal human beings. Not that it would happen that way but I have a suspicion that Elena will live happily ever after which would just be another cliche ending.
NinaDobrev,33bnpn,JammaWho,1 point,Tue Apr 21 10:25:58 2015 UTC,Eric?
NinaDobrev,33bnpn,aceshighsays,1 point,Sat Apr 25 22:06:29 2015 UTC,"Bill, so I'd say it's more of a Stefan equivalent."
NinaDobrev,33bnpn,JammaWho,1 point,Sat Apr 25 22:28:18 2015 UTC,Yup. It's really too bad Eric and Sookie never really get together. I stopped watching it after Eric got his memory back.
NinaDobrev,33bnpn,aceshighsays,1 point,Sat Apr 25 22:37:47 2015 UTC,there's no way they'll kill her off anyway so it's probably the happily ever after treatment which wouldn't bother me honestly
NinaDobrev,33bnpn,neos1990,-1,Tue Apr 21 10:39:45 2015 UTC,"I agree to some extent, but it would seriously be nice for a shock ending of some sort. Or even for her to just die somehow and everyone else just goes their own separate ways? Perhaps the whole ""flash forward"" is her dieing of age and the other guys are still vampires?"
NinaDobrev,33bnpn,JammaWho,1 point,Tue Apr 21 11:11:09 2015 UTC,maybe but killing her off would be a troll ending rather than shock....it's bad enough what happened to katherine

NinaDobrev,31phbg,Meior,5,Tue Apr 7 03:38:47 2015 UTC,I don't watch any of her stuff.  I just think she's astoundingly beautiful.  And speaking strictly in those terms I think she's got a shot at big movies if her agent isn't a clod.

NinaDobrev,31phbg,neos1990,3,Tue Apr 7 03:59:53 2015 UTC,"Outside of people who watch the CW and similar shows, I'd say she isn't big at all. I live in Germany and not a single person here has ever heard of her, save for a few teenage girls that watch TVD.  She needs a plan."
NinaDobrev,31phbg,GreekHole,1 point,Tue Apr 7 07:35:07 2015 UTC,exactly what i mean she needs an international hit and what better way than a superhero movie which wouldnt be too far off her expertise
NinaDobrev,31phbg,kzcatlady,2,Tue Apr 7 13:27:43 2015 UTC,unless she gets a big role soon her movie career doesn't seem promising. what she needs is a blockbuster maybe a superhero movie or something.
