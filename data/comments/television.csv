television,3dybty,NeogeoDude88,13,Mon Jul 20 20:28:05 2015 UTC,How is this show? I've heard good things.

television,3dybty,pimp_juice2272,3,Mon Jul 20 21:15:20 2015 UTC,I like it more then Seinfeld.
television,3dybty,Ihateualll,0,Mon Jul 20 19:39:34 2015 UTC,More than what?  And what comes after Seinfeld?
television,3dybty,jfree77,12,Mon Jul 20 20:11:17 2015 UTC,the star of curb your enthusiasm is the co creator of seinfeld

television,3dybty,mikhailovechkin,12,Mon Jul 20 20:52:05 2015 UTC,"My favorite show, by far. Whenever I'm having a bad day, I put it on. It is probably the funniest show I've ever seen. Watch it."
television,3dybty,FledglingScribe,9,Mon Jul 20 21:09:19 2015 UTC,Easiesly one of the funniest shows of all time. If u can appreciate dry humor
television,3dybty,Purple_elephant1353,4,Mon Jul 20 21:38:02 2015 UTC,I really enjoyed Seinfeld but could never get in to Curb Your Enthusiasm. I felt like he pushed jokes too far. The situations presented are definitely funny but so implausible as to merit more of a cringe than a laugh.
television,3dybty,WizardOfIF,3,Mon Jul 20 20:40:31 2015 UTC,Larry actually met with a Netflix exec but after an incident involving the last stick of chewing gum the deal fell through.  http://stream1.gifsoup.com/webroot/animatedgifs/239473_o.gif

television,3dybty,I_ONLY_BOLD_COMMENTS,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:26:59 2015 UTC,My only concern here is that this might mean the indefinite hiatus for Curb will continue even longer as most HBO shows on Amazon are officially over (maybe all of them?)...
television,3dybty,ImAJerk420,7,Mon Jul 20 15:33:30 2015 UTC,"Not true. If I recall correctly Boardwalk Empire appeared on Amazon Prime before it's final season. Now, it was only the first two seasons, and before the final season, but it did happen."
television,3dybty,jelatinman,3,Mon Jul 20 15:51:56 2015 UTC,"And Girls is on, albeit the first season. The deal is that the content gets added three years later. As such, shows like The Sopranos and Rome get their whole runs."

television,3dybty,jnards007,2,Mon Jul 20 15:57:36 2015 UTC,Veep season 1 is on Amazon Prime
television,3dybty,i_said_no_already,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:22:27 2015 UTC,I read slow and my brain got legitimately excited about season 9 for .4 seconds.
television,3dybty,ed2rummy,2,Mon Jul 20 20:19:47 2015 UTC,"You and me both.   I see a title - what's that! ""Curb Your Enthusiasm""? Can it be. Is this it? Is the elusive Season 9 finally being announced? At this point I'm already mentally compiling the list of people I will immediately tell. I'm sorting by who would be happiest, then other people who watched it, and finally those that I can try to convince to watch the first 8 before 9 comes out. Oh happy day! It's finally here!  ""Season"" - yes! Season 9. This is it! The waiting is over!  ""1-8"" Oh no.   ""Coming to Amazon Prime August 6th"" F  Oh well. Maybe next time."
television,3dybty,BooHoo_WhinyBitch,2,Mon Jul 20 20:27:42 2015 UTC,I am on Season 7 and this hands down beats Seinfeld. It is numero uno on my list now. I can not believe i waited this long to watch this show.
television,3dybty,mikhailovechkin,-1,Mon Jul 20 17:19:56 2015 UTC,I immediately bought the entire series on Amazon after watching a few episodes.  No regrets and a VERY high re-watch value.

television,3dybty,DoubleGuns,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:30:33 2015 UTC,TIL Larry David was convinced that he would be fired or the show wouldn't be picked up every year he did Seinfeld.  Several seasons he had to be convinced by Jerry Seinfeld that the show was starting production again and that they needed him to come back.
television,3dybty,thesmilingmeat,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:04:01 2015 UTC,Is there any chance it's going to come out in HD?    I found out on here the other day that The Wire was re-released in HD. Curb would be the only thing that I'd want a HD version of more.
