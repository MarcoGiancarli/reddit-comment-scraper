irlsmurfing,3cs1hb,normous,5,Sat Jul 11 02:20:28 2015 UTC,"I edited it to say plan, I agree, scheme isn't the best word to use."
irlsmurfing,3cs1hb,TARDIS-Engineer,22,Sat Jul 11 02:24:00 2015 UTC,"I changed it back.  This is a cultural misunderstanding and you guys I assume aren't actually from Britain.  A scheme isn't just a plan, it's an active undertaking currently in operation to achieve a specific outcome. A plan is just something written down on paper.  You won't understand this without living in Britain and being exposed to it daily. But the correct vernacular is ""scheme"", it's a word you'll hear every single day in British politics and policy making, government schemes, social schemes, welfare schemes, charity schemes and so on and so forth.  It's not sinister, it's just the correct word that's used for it.  For the purpose of understanding slightly better, here's some British journalism that uses both the word scheme and plan in their correct context.  In essence in British politics/welfare/social things/etc a plan is the early development of a scheme.  Give or take.  This is something I'd actually like to discuss with an English professor, there's very little discussion of the topic online and the definition in the OED doesn't completely satisfy me with the way the word is actually used in the British media.  Other British media articles for reference:  http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-33461759  http://www.birminghammail.co.uk/news/midlands-news/what-new-tax-free-childcare-scheme-9616036  http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-33336730  It's interesting because the difference is VERY nuanced. I wouldn't even say that it's universal... But I would say that use of the word plan in the way you changed the above wiki article is incorrect. Just as I would say that use of the word ""scheme"" would be incorrect in the following sentence: ""I helped out scheming his birthday party"" vs ""I helped out planning his birthday party"".  It's a difficult nuance.  EDIT: Ok I thought of the best way to explain the difference for those across the pond. It's like the ""projects"" or ""housing projects"" you guys have over there. The word ""projects"" is the word you guys use and to call those a ""plan"" or ""scheme"" or anything else in your eyes would be incorrect. We have equivalents here in the UK, they're called housing schemes, we use the word scheme for a lot of other government and social ""projects"" as well though. Here's a government link to information on our housing schemes: https://www.gov.uk/affordable-home-ownership-schemes/overview"

irlsmurfing,3cs1hb,onemoreclick,22,Fri Jul 10 10:58:59 2015 UTC,"He never did talk it up, it was the voiceover that did. Most people can hardly tell the difference between a 10 year old sports car and a supercar.  My dad had a Lotus Elise. They are great value for what you get, whereas a Ferrari is a terrible investment and burns cash for no real reason. Both impress girls all the same, and both must adhere to the same speed limits on the road. Even if you are worth ¬£20M+ I could imagine not wanting much more than a ¬£15k thing... you don't make money by splashing on poor investments"
irlsmurfing,3cs1hb,CHAD_J_THUNDERCOCK,2,Fri Jul 10 13:36:44 2015 UTC,"I agree that a Lotus Elise is great value. In school I once had a project where I had to select a car I would like to own and give pros and cons. We were given a price limit to keep people from going crazy with supercars. I picked a Lotus Elise and would like to say I came out on top.   My father's new truck ran him around $40k, I believe. I understand that a truck has more utility than a sports car, but if you can get a great looking car like the Elise for that price, I'd say you found a winner.  One thing I heard is that they are fairly uncomfortable to drive in - any comment on that?"
irlsmurfing,3cs1hb,GiveMeAcid,5,Fri Jul 10 19:21:14 2015 UTC,"They are uncomfortable for long distance. Its super lightweight, like a road-legal go-kart. The seats are hard like plastic rather than a cushion. The seats rattle and vibrate at a kind of high consistently.   It would tire you out to do a few hours in the thing. You would be much more mentally exhausted than you would in a comfortable car.  Its just designed for driving and they cut weight everywhere. The one thing it had that wasn't necessary was a very simple car radio with a few buttons on it. It had poor signal so my dad put copper foil on the inside of the front bonnet to make half the car a radio antenna.  When you are in the car you are very low to the ground, which makes you feel like you are going faster than you are. Add that to the acceleration and you quickly disover that its easy to impress your passengers while not having to go that fast"

However, if they focused a bit more on the wax museum bit of it, it'd be more appropriate but I also think you're getting a bit too serious about qualified content submitted to a small sub like this (literally, like 6 to 8 solid submissions per month pop up here, if that).  As far as the wax museum parts of the video go, people fully expect it to simply be an inanimate Terminator wax statue. It turns out to actually be Arnold Schwarzenegger in Terminator make-up. Of course it ""scares"" aka surprises people. People should be surprised when they learn the true identity of a smurf. Sure, they didn't focus on that the entirety of the video but it's still entertaining to see people's reactions when they realize what they previously thought to be a wax statue to actually be Arnold."

Thing is, you're only supposed to go through the pit if you actually need something of the above. In the race linked above, Senna went through the pit just because it's shorter and would save him time (on this particular track, usually this is not the case) due to there not being a speed limit yet. The limit was introduced afterwards to make sure that driving through the pit would never net you an advantage, but would only be for maintenance like intended."

irlsmurfing,36qjnx,yhelothere,5,Thu May 21 12:59:42 2015 UTC,"That part kinda just struck me as bullshit. More than likely they were confused from her just being completely incompetent during the first round so they were like ""do I try? Is she actually good or what? She was floundering last round, what if I go too far and hurt her?""  Would have been better if she didn't ambush them the way she did. Throw some good jabs and kicks, back off, repeat once or twice so they get the idea, then fight.  Only thing I could think during the video was that it was unfair as fuck."
irlsmurfing,36qjnx,soundslikeponies,2,Thu May 21 22:25:25 2015 UTC,"There's sparring in many gyms. It's part of the sport. This were amateurs. Probably in it for the work out. She didn't hurt them, and it probably looks worst than it is.  Look at the force she was using when she was hitting the bags and look how she hits them, she is just connecting the punches and not throwing weight/strength behind them.

irlsmurfing,36qjnx,arzuros,8,Thu May 21 12:16:20 2015 UTC,"It's a bit different when it comes to thai boxing. If you don't know the proper form, you sure as hell don't start teaching it to others. If you pick up the bad habits early, it's hard to work them out later.  If they don't know basics such as teeps, you don't jump into a ring with someone to teach them how to spar. The way they were ""beaten up"" by the girl just totally seems like fake. Nobody who gets himself into that situation is that bad."

irlsmurfing,36qjnx,igdub,20,Thu May 21 12:25:27 2015 UTC,"Yes definitely, it's called thai boxing and that's the idea of the sport. Them being girls, elderly or younger than me doesn't matter the slightest. Sure I'll adjust power accordingly, but from my experience it's usually the older men (50+) and girls who spar the hardest.  I have a feeling you've never tried any combat sport at all ? Or any sport where girls are included for that matter."

irlsmurfing,30nsuw,Uxt7,6,Sun Mar 29 05:28:25 2015 UTC,How come?
irlsmurfing,30nsuw,TheDetective13,33,Sun Mar 29 05:39:59 2015 UTC,It was faked.
irlsmurfing,30nsuw,dailyapple,22,Sun Mar 29 06:32:47 2015 UTC,I believe it was a publicity stunt where they tried to pretend that it actually was her winning all the matches and only came clean and released a video showing it was set up after somebody found the casting call for the girl a couple days later.
irlsmurfing,30nsuw,Uxt7,29,Sun Mar 29 06:39:33 2015 UTC,Well they clearly filmed all of this stuff as it was happening so it seems pretty obvious that they were going to release the video of it being faked regardless.
irlsmurfing,30nsuw,creepy_mofo,-16,Sun Mar 29 07:24:02 2015 UTC,Unless this was their security in case someone caught on to their shit.   Edit: Shoutout to /r/conspiracy

irlsmurfing,30nsuw,Pepperyfish,43,Sun Mar 29 15:23:28 2015 UTC,The smash community seems really cool. I would bet a lot of money if you did this at a like CoD event there would be a lot of salt getting thrown around. Hell I probably wouldn't let my kid do something like this at event for CoD or LoL for fear of her getting hit or something.

irlsmurfing,30nsuw,x3tripleace3x,-6,Sun Mar 29 04:31:15 2015 UTC,It's been true for me at least. I'm plat 2 which is fairly high elo ( diamond 3 before reset ) and if you play well no one will get mad
irlsmurfing,30nsuw,IdleRhymer,1 point,Sun Mar 29 06:11:26 2015 UTC,"Yeah, if you play well. But if you have a bad game (which happens to anyone) then people can get seriously salty.  The Diamond I grind is the most tedious, mind numbing, most insane grind I've ever been a part of. The elitism, by the way, was incredible. 50+ LP Diamond I players looked down on 0-49 LP Diamond I players, and 0-49 Diamond I players thought everyone below them were complete trash (there is, admittedly, a clear skill gap). Once I got to Challenger (mostly just because I exploited the start-of-the-season rush), the pressure was extremely high to win, even more so than Diamond I, you really had to fight tooth and nail to keep your spot. The only way I stayed sane playing at Diamond I/Challenger was just focusing on my gameplay 100%. But then you fall into the depressing loop of every loss being your fault, that you could have played better and that you suck. I quit after getting burnt out from that shit, and realizing I was near my limit skill-wise, and I had no future in the game."

I worked in the MMO industry long enough to want to stay as far away as possible from toxic communities, and that rules out me ever trying LoL. That's cool though, there's no shortage of fun titles in my steam backlog. Working in multiplayer gaming killed multiplayer gaming for me, heh."
irlsmurfing,30nsuw,bkalen17,1 point,Sun Mar 29 20:49:08 2015 UTC,"That attitude is literally exactly what makes people hate the LoL community. Its people like you who are the problem. I can't even comprehend how you think that mindset is okay. And to the dude who said it is getting better, I'm sorry but you are wrong. I've been playing since public beta and I promise you, once the tribunal was ""disabled for maintainence"" the problem got exponentially worse. Its so bad now that there are toxic players in beginner bot games verbally abusing brand new players for ""being a piece of shit who should uninstall and kill themselves."" Its astonishing how awful some people in the LoL community are towards other people. I guarantee that they don't act that way when they aren't safe behind their screens. If they did act that way they would get their teeth knocked out."
irlsmurfing,30nsuw,dopedoge,-2,Mon Mar 30 00:27:02 2015 UTC,How am i the problem? I have 2k+ games and am high plat/ low dia elo and never say anything in chat i just play. I was just saying that from my experience people only get mad if you feed/do stupid shit. And if you are that bothered by it you can simply mute them.
irlsmurfing,30nsuw,ZeusMcFly,2,Mon Mar 30 02:34:34 2015 UTC,"How are you the problem? A prime example is how you started a dick measuring contest over your allegedly high plat MMR. This is the exact kind of ""I'm gods gift to LoL"" behavior that is characteristic of toxic bronze-silver level players. MMR has absolutely nothing to do with how you treat others in a game. If you think that people who are better at the game are less likely to be an asshole or be treated poorly, then you have fooled yourself. Grow up and then come back and talk to me."

irlsmurfing,30ngm4,revolutionary_hero,42,Sun Mar 29 18:38:23 2015 UTC,"I agree, the celebrity in public posts should be deleted  Edit: I meant the celebrity in public doing nothing but talking to people. Like Snoop Dogg parking cars. How is that smurfing?"
irlsmurfing,30ngm4,FreB0,0,Sun Mar 29 00:50:26 2015 UTC,Well who determines who's a celebrity and who isn't? What about celebrities who are actually talented like that video with jewel? Which I'm pretty sure was one of the videos that inspired the creation of this subreddit
irlsmurfing,30ngm4,GershyBby,14,Sun Mar 29 02:51:19 2015 UTC,I think he refers the celebs who aren't really doing anything extraordinary in the videos other than the fact that people know who they are. (that is my view at least)
irlsmurfing,30ngm4,Ubley,2,Sun Mar 29 03:47:17 2015 UTC,"Also those who aren't doing what they're good at. Snoop dog in disguise playing soccer isn't smurfing because he isn't (as far as I know) an amazing soccer player.   David beckham (I believe?) did a thing where he worked undercover in a retail shop. I don't think that's smurfing because while he was disguised, he wasn't doing something that he is at the top of his field at against others who aren't.   However I don't think being disguised is really necessary for smurfing - Jeremy Lin playing street ball was still pretty epic.   I think the best example of IRLsmurfing that I've seen has got to be the video of Kobayashi - he is disguised as someone who is not expected to be world class, he vs's someone who is not at the ""top level"" (so, someone who is below him) but is still involved with the activity/sport/game and then beats him incredibly (think it was like 18-54)"
irlsmurfing,30ngm4,Ubley,27,Thu Jun 18 02:48:00 2015 UTC,That video with jewel was a perfect example of smurfingIRL. But all this shit like snoopdog being a carwasher and all that bullshit isn't.

irlsmurfing,30ngm4,Ubley,1 point,Sun Mar 29 08:22:46 2015 UTC,"Ya, I think that if the person isn't disguised then it isn't smurfing and should be removed. I'm totally for that, I just don't want it being a blanket ban of any celebrities ya know what I mean?"
irlsmurfing,30ngm4,GershyBby,3,Sun Mar 29 08:36:21 2015 UTC,oh nah man didn't mean it that way. Anyone that is at the top of their field vsing someone not of their level is smurfing imo
irlsmurfing,30ngm4,Konstiin,5,Sun Mar 29 04:24:40 2015 UTC,"I dunno, the celebrities are celebrities because they are exceedingly talented at certain aspects, and to smurf irl, you need to be exceedingly talented at something so it kinda goes hand in hand.  The more talented you are, the more famous you likely are going to be, throw on top of that the fact that it's also more likely that you're going to be recorded for a publicity stunt(such as smurfing) and it just sorta meshes together."
irlsmurfing,30ngm4,jubbing,8,Sun Mar 29 07:37:26 2015 UTC,If snoop dog versus someone in rapping thats smurfing but if he works as a car washed then thats not smurfing.
irlsmurfing,30ngm4,fnoobreported,0,Sun Mar 29 18:31:57 2015 UTC,"No, I'm not saying you have to be famous to be smurfing, but chances are if you're famous it's because you're good at something.  I'm not saying that only famous people can smurf, but I'm saying it's more likely."
irlsmurfing,30ngm4,tomastaz,2,Sun Mar 29 20:54:22 2015 UTC,"Yeah but he isn't saying celebrities shouldn't be in this sub, he's saying it should be limited to when they are doing what they are good at. You are right that celebrities are (mostly) celebrities because they're good at something but the smurfing video should be of THAT something - snoop RAPPING would be smurfing, he's not a world class window cleaner.."

The drummer in particular had some trouble with the syncopated rhythm, and the song had kind-of a repetetive arrangement. Could easily have fooled me had I not read the title of this post.

This isn't even close to that.
irlsmurfing,30ixhj,jackblack2323,2,Sun Mar 29 01:30:47 2015 UTC,My comment isn't really related to yours per se but I just found this subreddit and had no idea what smurfing was but judging from the submissions I figured it out.  It's exactly what I like to watch when inebriated.  Just came across your comment and this could not be worded more perfectly and should be in the sidebar permanently to describe what this subreddit represents.  Nice job mate

What if it's a professional entering a competition of stacking video game discs really high?  Smurfing as a term originated in online play. A smurf account, smurf character, etc.   Smash is not an online game.   KoreanDJ is not there as a smurf character, he's there as himself, flesh and blood. There is no distinction to be made between this and an athlete playing a sport in terms of what should and shouldn't be ""irlsmurfing"". And I think this is the nerdiest tirade I've made this year."

irlsmurfing,2wqlij,buzzzybutter,29,Sun Feb 22 06:20:29 2015 UTC,Man this is so old lol. This is back from the original SC2 release. The guy on the left is a caster (HDStarcraft) who's very average but would still be able to crush someone who had no idea what they were doing.  Guy playing is Day[9] who was a phenomenal SC1/Broodwar player and quite good at SC2 although he never really played. He also became a fulltime caster and eventually segued out of the SC2 scene.  He did it pretty well. If I were HDStarcraft I would have been fairly certain I was winning too. Day[9] sat on 1 base the entire time and just built a really powerful unit which is extremely uncommon and it caught him by surprise.
irlsmurfing,2wqlij,JamesB41,5,Sun Feb 22 22:53:26 2015 UTC,quite good at SC2 although he never really played.   GM with all different races is pretty good imo.

irlsmurfing,2u8zi4,autowikibot,2,Sat Jan 31 02:29:12 2015 UTC,"Section 3. Washington Post experiment of article  Joshua Bell:       In an experiment initiated by The Washington Post columnist Gene Weingarten, Bell donned a baseball cap and played as an incognito busker at the Metro subway station L'Enfant Plaza in Washington, D.C. on January 12, 2007. The experiment was videotaped on hidden camera; of the 1,097 people who passed by, only seven stopped to listen to him, and only one recognized him. For his nearly 45-minute performance, Bell collected $32.17 from 27 passersby (excluding $20 from the passerby who recognized him).  Three days before, he earned considerably more playing the same repertoire at a concert. Weingarten won the 2008 Pulitzer Prize for Feature Writing for his article on the experiment.   The Washington Post posted the video on YouTube  and a feature-length documentary, Find Your Way: A Busker's Documentary, chronicled Bell's experience.

irlsmurfing,2u8itk,Trewper-,31,Fri Jan 30 20:53:57 2015 UTC,"Funny, but I prefer the ones that show the reveal at the end."
irlsmurfing,2u8itk,mkglass,5,Fri Jan 30 23:17:08 2015 UTC,I was waiting the whole video for it to come and it never did. Very disappointed.
irlsmurfing,2u8itk,Uxt7,10,Sat Jan 31 09:41:46 2015 UTC,"I think the guy at around 5:00 in, Ragen, is the weirdo that pays hookers to fuck him on camera. His videos have popped up on /r/cringe a few times."
irlsmurfing,2u8itk,FuckingHippies,10,Fri Feb 6 00:28:18 2015 UTC,"You are correct, that guy is on Efukt and is known as the ""Creepiest motherfucker in porn"" he tricks women into thinking he is a talent scout that can help them find more porn work.   I posted this video before in my past comments and I talked about it in more detail. But you can find the video by googling the phrase above!  EDIT: Here's the video. NSFW!"
irlsmurfing,2u8itk,FuckingHippies,4,Fri Feb 6 03:58:01 2015 UTC,I knew it. And I'm pretty sure he's also in the Snoop video posted in this sub. He's like 4 minutes in. The old dude that watches Snoop in his car.   So odd.

irlsmurfing,2u89jn,whereswaldoscock,75,Fri Jan 30 20:44:58 2015 UTC,I liked the casual Pepsi drinking while other brands were actually blurred.

irlsmurfing,2u89jn,fOxxy_the_fox,115,Sun Jul 12 14:37:29 2015 UTC,Are you sure you weren't looking for /r/hailcorporate instead?  Seriously that is not real or at least heavily misrepresented.
irlsmurfing,2u89jn,hesh582,54,Fri Jan 30 21:42:13 2015 UTC,You mean some of those people just happened to be drinking delicious and refreshing Pepsi Max while there's a full camera crew filming?
irlsmurfing,2u89jn,Dynamiklol,8,Sat Jan 31 04:46:11 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I think it is semi-real.  It is at a real park that is known for amazing basketball players coming to play pickup games, and the premise was about a documentary about a pickup player trying to make it to the pros (""Uncle Drew's nephew"") which is how the explained the cameras.  I do think they definitely planted models for the camera shots of the pepsi, but I think the basketball stuff was legit."

irlsmurfing,2u8zsj,rexthedino,6,Sat Jan 31 05:05:52 2015 UTC,That was a rare opportunity to see someone both talking behind a celebrity's back and their attitude face-to-face.

irlsmurfing,2u8fey,HumSol,5,Sat Jan 31 03:11:00 2015 UTC,Being someone who actively dislikes his music I've defended him several times because every clip I've ever seen from this show he's been fucking hilarious. Go John Mayer!
