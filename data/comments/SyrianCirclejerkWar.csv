If we really wanted to we could defeat Daesh and install our own caliphate. We definitely have the brain and the manpower. There are plenty of veterans here, plus the rest here knows where the magazine release is on an AK74, from years of playing Counter Strike.  Realistically the SCW Force would be far more effective than most groups in the Syria right now, if not all. The Hezbollah is tied on Irans's apron strings. The Kurds can't even tie their shoes without US help. Don't get me started on the ""Free"" Syrian ""Army"". IF and JAI are sucking Erdogans cock, JaN isn't what they used to be. And the SAA, seriously, I'm actually suprised they made it this far. It's like the fat dude from Gravity Falls and the retarded chicken from Family Guy had a love child. None of them would stand a chance against us.  Daesh is getting bombed to shit now anyways. It's like a really low hanging fruit at this point - we could probably take Raqqa within days, and Mosul within months. Now, I don't actually support a violent intervention against Daesh by SCW. I just think its kind of a fun idea conceptually.  Edit: Downvotes, really Reddit?  Edit 2: Thanks for the gold, kind kuffr!  Edit 3: Wow can't believe my top comment is about this!

SyrianCirclejerkWar,3cbqlp,Balak_Jewboma,5,Wed Jul 8 05:05:04 2015 UTC,"The thing is, every video I watch, every snippet I see and every interview I read about Bashar al-Assad induces a hatred I haven't felt for someone in a long time. It's not an implicit hatred like I would have for Nickelback or Ellen Pao. No, it's a lot more nuanced than that. It's the same type of hatred that you get when someone cuts you in line at the supermarket. That type of anger that induces a little whence in the back of your neck and a shiver of anger echoing through the vestiges of your body. That anger stems from my feeling that he's the personification of all the ills of society. He represents the corporate greed corroding the foundations of the things I love, the person looking for a handout, the one who's always looking to blame others instead of their own ineptitude, the person quick to use the military instead of having a personal conversation. He's an adulterer and a liar and he's abused the goodwill of the syrian society for his own personal gain. In short, he's the type to cut his piece of the pie from the middle and still get mad when you eat the crust. And it's these very things about him that represents the moral decay I despise. I honestly can say this with a straight face. I despise him. I don't wish him any physical harm because I'm not that type of person, but I just wish he would disappear from Syria and by proxy my life in general. He needs to be fired; since he's held the position of president bad things have happened there. Negative things. It's time Syria shed him and move on."

For other uses, see ISIL (disambiguation), ISIS (disambiguation), Daish (disambiguation), and Islamic state (disambiguation).   The Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL /ˈaɪsəl/; Arabic: الدولة الإسلامية في العراق والشام‎), also known as the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria or the Islamic State of Iraq and ash-Sham (ISIS /ˈaɪsɪs/),  or simply as the Islamic State,  is a Salafi jihadi militant group and self-proclaimed caliphate and Islamic state that as of March 2015 has control over territory occupied by ten million people  in Iraq and Syria, as well as limited territorial control in Libya and Nigeria. The group also operates or has affiliates in other parts of the world including southeast Asia.    The group is known in Arabic as ad-Dawlah al-Islāmiyah fī 'l-ʿIrāq wa-sh-Shām, leading to the acronym Da'ish, Da'eesh, or DAESH (داعش, Arabic pronunciation: [ˈdaːʕiʃ]), the Arabic equivalent of ""ISIL"".  On 29 June 2014, the group proclaimed itself to be a worldwide caliphate, with Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi being named its caliph,  and renamed itself ""Islamic State"" (الدولة الإسلامية, ad-Dawlah al-Islāmiyah). The new name and the idea of a caliphate has been widely criticised and condemned, with the United Nations, various governments, and mainstream Muslim groups all refusing to acknowledge it. As caliphate, it claims religious, political and military authority over all Muslims worldwide and that ""the legality of all emirates, groups, states, and organisations, becomes null by the expansion of the khilāfah's [caliphate's] authority and arrival of its troops to their areas"".   Many Islamic and non-Islamic communities judge the group to be unrepresentative of Islam.

All anyone has to do to find out the true opinions of regime supporters is to read youtube and liveleak comments by the many shills and fanboys who support the Baathists and the Assad mafioso clan.  You all support genocide against Sunnis (aka takfiri terrorists) and think Alawites should be allowed to mass murder and gas Sunnis whenever they please to enforce their one party totalitarian authoritarian dictatorship through the Alawite controlled Mukhbarat agencies and armed forces. Plus you all truly hate Kurds on top of all that lol (who what a coincidence are mostly Sunni and where extremely oppressed and marginalized by the Assad dynasty for decades).
