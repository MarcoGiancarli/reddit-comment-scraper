I have Aromasin on hand and I am confused about the dosing protocol. I know alot of people say to start it preemptively and then others just wait until they feel high estrogen sides. When should I start taking it, and how often at first? I was thinking about starting next week and taking it on days I inject (12.5mg Mondays & Thursdays).  Also, should I up my Dbol dosage to 50mg ED? When should I notice it kick in?  Last question; since I'm already shut down from running TRT how soon will I notice my blast kick in?"

steroids,3e04uu,dusthole,2,Tue Jul 21 03:18:39 2015 UTC,Alicin has been found to not be biologically active inside the body after oral intake.  It is likely not the component responsible for garlic's benefits.

(NIH) in the United States and published in the Archives of Internal Medicine in 2007 found that the consumption of garlic in any form did not reduce blood cholesterol levels in patients with moderately high baseline cholesterol levels.[25] The fresh garlic used in this study contained substantial levels of allicin, so the study casts doubt on the ability of allicin when taken orally to reduce blood cholesterol levels in human subjects."
steroids,3e04uu,dusthole,4,Tue Jul 21 13:04:52 2015 UTC,"No, I used Examine.  There's over a dozen studies that prove it reduces LDL/overall cholesterol.  But the effects are not attributed to allicin.  It's either not tested, not used, or not found in the blood/urine in all the studies."
steroids,3e04uu,SPRVLN,4,Tue Jul 21 13:56:32 2015 UTC,This.   There are other compounds in garlic that give these benefits.
steroids,3e04uu,JackSprat9_21,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:10:35 2015 UTC,"from examine.com/supplements/Garlic  Basically, the Allicin is what gets everything started. It's a chain reaction which makes garlic work & give the benefits we want.   Garlic’s main mechanism involves a molecule called alliin. When garlic is physically disturbed through chewing, slicing, or crushing, it releases an alliin metabolite: allicin. Allicin turns into a variety of fat and water soluble sulfur-containing compounds. In fact, these compounds are so volatile, they give off hydrogen sulfide, which is part of garlic’s unmistakable smell and taste. By tapping into the hydrogen sulfide signaling system, garlic relaxes the blood vessels and provides a variety of health benefits. Garlic also uses the hydrogen sulfide signaling system to exert its anti-cancer effects.  Garlic can be taken in several forms: fresh/raw garlic, aged garlic, garlic oil and boiled garlic. Boiled garlic prevents alliin from creating its sulfur-containing metabolites, and garlic oil, while effective as a supplement, has a potentially high level of toxicity. All of the beneficial components of garlic can be found in fresh garlic, which makes aged garlic supplements and fresh garlic the two best ways to supplement garlic. Garlic should be crushed, sliced, or chewed (prior to cooking) in order to ensure maximum allicin production, since allicin is responsible for many of garlic’s beneficial effects."

steroids,3e130j,Shotdownm,2,Tue Jul 21 10:27:11 2015 UTC,"At least from an asin dosage standpoint I was doing the ""max"" and then some. I'll try what you suggested and see if that helps."
steroids,3e130j,forever-small,2,Tue Jul 21 12:00:22 2015 UTC,Asin dose? How much of each compound are you on? Do you have access to bloodwork so it's not just people guessing?
steroids,3e130j,DrDeath666,2,Tue Jul 21 04:08:51 2015 UTC,"I have access to bloodwork i'll have to wait about a week to get it though :/  I'm on 500 test/wk, 525 npp/wk, 20mg Sdrol ED  Edit: Asin dosed at 25mg ED"
steroids,3dyyvx,DryWeightSmoosh,2,Mon Jul 20 17:53:36 2015 UTC,"I've heard that on accutane sometime breakouts can continue and even worsen before they get better.  I would not suggest running more accutane.  Give it time.  Same goes for ai.  I had a back breakout when I switched from a blast to a cruise a few weeks ago.  It takes time to clear up, and I've learned to stay consistent with my ai dosing.  You don't want to take to much because crashed estro sucks.  Some people say you can't do it with arkmasin, but I have definitely got bloods that came back with e2 at 4 from 20 mg Ed of asin."
steroids,3dyyvx,skeetskeetskeetske,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:14:27 2015 UTC,they usually worsen before they get better.
steroids,3dyyvx,NotTheClA,2,Mon Jul 20 20:34:06 2015 UTC,"Little bit of real science I found out earlier,  Different carrier oils can cause breakouts just as bad if not worse than the steroids in them in some people"

steroids,3dyyvx,Levko13,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:15:41 2015 UTC,Does Asin dissolve in water?  All the liquids I've gotten have been dissolved in alcohol.    I had good luck with low does Accutane 20mg EOD @ 190lbs.  Also getting my e2 under control helped.
steroids,3dyyvx,PerCarl14,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:55:46 2015 UTC,"I'm on identical cycle of test and tren. I do 12.5 asin eod.   For acne, I do B5 in addition to the hygiene and topicals.  3 grams b5 + 500mg carnitine in the am and before bed.   B5 makes all the difference for me. Research it. People respond differently, but lots of good results on B5."
steroids,3dyyvx,JackSprat9_21,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:35:08 2015 UTC,TY for the info. I'll look up that stuff. I'll try anything to get away from high dose Accutane.
steroids,3dyyvx,ATXblazer,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:47:50 2015 UTC,Just get a pill cutter to ensure accurate dosing
steroids,3dyyvx,hammercurlsforthor,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:07:18 2015 UTC,"Does the sust you're using contain EO?   I've never had any issues with aromatization sides (including any amount of acne) even at doses of 1.5g test, in addition to other aromatising compounds. When I switched to sust brewed with EO? Jesus Christ, man. I've had, at most, two pimples on my face my entire life but that shit set me off. My forehead probably had 3-4 overnight and they wouldn't subside until I completely discontinued use and switched back to test e.   Try dropping the sust and switching back to enth or cyp. EO is a bitch if you react to it."

steroids,3dzz1b,gearedbeardv2,3,Mon Jul 20 23:09:15 2015 UTC,About two weeks to get out of your system. Sides? Probably a little sooner.

steroids,3dzz1b,zuk1,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:09:45 2015 UTC,why the fuck would you take any compound noted for its nasty side effect profile without understanding the half life of said compound
steroids,3dzz1b,hoponthe,2,Tue Jul 21 11:03:26 2015 UTC,"I do understand the half life and I know how long it takes for it to get out of my body. I am just asking what people experienced themselves, as the sides could disappear before it's out of your blood."
steroids,3dzz1b,Super-Saiyajin,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:47:07 2015 UTC,Can you get some singulair or an inhailer?
steroids,3dzz1b,gearedbeardv2,0,Tue Jul 21 13:55:36 2015 UTC,Anybody that can get steroids and ancillaries can get singulair. Obviously not looking hard enough.
steroids,3dzz1b,Queenslandian,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:55:09 2015 UTC,Seems very fast to be getting unbearable sides. You're in for a rough week if tren is the actual cause.
steroids,3dzz1b,mesologgi,-1,Tue Jul 21 02:05:15 2015 UTC,"3 months ago i started my first tren experience with enanthate. I was running 500mg test en.  After 1 week the weird dreams came. Night sweats were bearable 2 weeks in. I only gasped for air after sex. The most severe side effect was lack of sleep, sleep for 4-5 hours at most and wake up multiple times per night.   I decided to use 375mg test e and the sides got less and bearable. Then i increased to 600mg tren and it was as good as it gets. Loved the feel, the look in the mirror, the vascularity and only had some bad sleep here and there."

steroids,3dy2qt,the_d3vils_advocate,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:30:18 2015 UTC,Doesn't seem like you were using anything that could still be active unless you were given mislabeled test and  we're using a long esther that is still in your system. I hope someone else chimes in on this.
steroids,3dy2qt,egobroniacal,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:44:32 2015 UTC,"that is a wicked scenario, but even then, end of cycle was 1.5 month ago."
steroids,3dy2qt,tropostil,2,Mon Jul 20 16:17:58 2015 UTC,did you get pre-cycle bloods?  I am betting you were higher than 624 to begin with and you are still recovering your HPTA function.
steroids,3dy2qt,takeiteasy916,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:44:33 2015 UTC,Nope I didn't take a pre-cycle test.
steroids,3dy2qt,catsupbot,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:15:21 2015 UTC,624 is not very high. also your PCT is still in your system. i would honestly run more PCT and then test 6 weeks after that.

steroids,3dy2qt,mrlogical301,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:14:42 2015 UTC,I agree that you're probably still in recovery and your natty levels were a little higher than 624  After my 1st cycle I did bloods roughly a month after pct finished and was in the same boat. Waited another few months and all was good
steroids,3dwslw,vegeta_tarian,3,Mon Jul 20 04:36:40 2015 UTC,"Never tried quercetin.  DNP gives me hives pretty bad though, if I let my histamines get out of control.  The only thing that seems to help is if I stay on top of benadryl, and limit foods with high histamine values like cheese, sausage, beer, yogurt, tomatoes, etc.  Even with that strict control, it's still a fine line to walk, and I always feel like I'm about to get itchy.    Sticking to clen/T3 from now on."
steroids,3dwslw,MechanicalSideburns,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:41:23 2015 UTC,"So you have indeed tried multiple runs on dnp after your first allergic reaction?   I ask because I'd assume each exposure gives a worse allergic reaction, but it sounds like you were somewhat able to control it with benadryl."
steroids,3dwslw,MechanicalSideburns,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:45:33 2015 UTC,"First time I ran it, I broke out in full body hives 2 days after the run ended.  The second time (I'll try anything twice), I broke out like 4 days into it.  At that point I said fuck it.  Then this year, I just happened to be moving a bunch from a different vendor, and so I figured that I'd give it one last go with more attention to food/drink.  With a low dose (250), benadryl loading, and attention to histamine releasing foods, I was able to do like 12 days with no break outs.  But I was always right on the edge.  I could feel the heat and itching threatening to start, but it just never blossomed into a real rash."
steroids,3dwslw,ThemsFightinWords,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:24:20 2015 UTC,Are you allergic to DNP?
steroids,3dwslw,ThemsFightinWords,2,Mon Jul 20 06:25:58 2015 UTC,"Yep I sure am. I've seen people recommend loading up on benadryl or zyrtec a week before if you know you're allergic, but I've also know that each exposure to an allergen causes your body to freak out more. So I thought quercetin might be an additional option."
steroids,3dwslw,Juicedupmonkeyman,-1,Mon Jul 20 06:43:51 2015 UTC,"Uh huh. The fact that I disagree with DNP in general aside, you should just stick with T3 , perhaps clen, and deficit. Don't risk it. My 2c."
steroids,3dwslw,Juicedupmonkeyman,4,Mon Jul 20 07:58:31 2015 UTC,Clen is so much worse sides wise than dnp. If you're not an idiot dnp isn't that risk. Don't push the dose. Stay hydrated. Be smart.
steroids,3dwslw,ThemsFightinWords,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:59:14 2015 UTC,"True. My first dnp run, I hydrated and honestly felt totally fine. The only indication that I was indeed taking dnp was the crazy hives I got and scale number haha"

steroids,3dz294,xxam925,-3,Mon Jul 20 18:24:30 2015 UTC,Mainly because of the fact that it is a methylated compound and WILL destroy the liver.  Are you suggesting I run like a Test C cycle while on this?
steroids,3dz294,Juicedupmonkeyman,5,Mon Jul 20 18:26:08 2015 UTC,You need to do way more research before touching anything.
steroids,3dz294,Juicedupmonkeyman,-2,Mon Jul 20 18:32:57 2015 UTC,It is called asking for help if I am unsure.  Which Is what I just did.
steroids,3dz294,Juicedupmonkeyman,5,Mon Jul 20 18:38:22 2015 UTC,You shouldn't be touching this shit. Go read up on how to do a real cycle. Oral on prohormones are garbage. At least run a sarm instead so you don't fuck shit up.
steroids,3dz294,skeetskeetskeetske,-1,Mon Jul 20 18:40:14 2015 UTC,"I mean I have the basic knowledge on how to do a real cycle, my dad is on TRT but I am 18 and I don't want to mess with any testosterone since I'm still in the golden ages for that stuff."
steroids,3dz294,Juicedupmonkeyman,4,Mon Jul 20 18:43:50 2015 UTC,"The stuff you're taking is untested and far more dangerous than testosterone. You shouldn't be touching any of that shit yet. Like look, you'll do whatever you want I'm just trying to help guide you away from a dumb decision."
steroids,3dz294,gearedbeardv2,-1,Mon Jul 20 18:45:35 2015 UTC,I respect that and thats what I posted here for because ya'll are no bullshit.   What do you think about mk677? (Or any other SARMS you might think would help me? Dont know much about SARMS so)
steroids,3dz294,Dietyz,2,Mon Jul 20 18:47:36 2015 UTC,"Nope, that's more a hgh secretagogue I believe.  I think ostarine is probably the least supressive, but also the least effective.  I've been running lgd for 5 weeks and really like it, but I also have a trt dose of test alongside."
steroids,3dz294,clawing_kittens,0,Mon Jul 20 18:55:21 2015 UTC,"Well i mean my natural test levels are around 1100, ive been tested.  Is it super expensive?"
steroids,3dz294,xxam925,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:59:07 2015 UTC,"Mk677 isn't a sarm. It's a ghrelin mimetic. It causes the release of growth hormone. Stack that with lgd4033 at 5-10mg a day and you'll be far better off than this shit oral only cycle and won't be pinning. Run some d aspartic acid as a ""pct""  just make sure you get quality lgd and not some sketchy company that is putting prohormones or orals in their shit. 2 months of that and you will have great results. I'd take at least a month off between running lgd4033 again. Mk677 can be continued throughout."

steroids,3dz294,GearNbeer,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:18:07 2015 UTC,"that prohormone will suppress you the same way test would, so why would you just run that? it makes no sense  your just gonna run an oral and have up and down blood levels resulting in extra sides and less gains   I am 18 and I don't want to mess with any testosterone since I'm still in the golden ages for that stuff.   if you want to maintain the natty golden age of testosterone than you need to nly take things that wont suppress you"
steroids,3dz294,zzfish1095,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:48:02 2015 UTC,"If you don't want to mess with your natural hormonal balance at this age, don't take anything. Pro hormones, SARMs, steroids, they all are going to cause a displacement of your natural levels in some regard. Chill for a few years. Or take the plunge. Don't dip toes in the water because you're scared, that's when you'll fuck something up"
steroids,3dz294,idontlift66,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:37:53 2015 UTC,"Yes I am suggesting that you run a test base. Or just a test run. Your gains will be much better and longer lasting, test will also give you very few sides if you keep your ai game on point. Once you get past the idea of pinning=the devil it is a much better idea all around."
