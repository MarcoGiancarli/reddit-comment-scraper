SampleSize,3e3eg8,BenHellaCreme,4,Tue Jul 21 17:29:36 2015 UTC,"The ""list 10 actions"" questions are very demanding (does anyone really have 10 different things they do after sex?) and ignore the fact that there may not really be any single typical sequence of events, as it can vary wildly based on circumstances (for instance, it might depend on the partner, or on whether it's at the beginning of a relationship vs with an established partner, or if you are having sex right before sleeping or in the middle of the day).  I think I could have answered both more easily and more accurately if it had just been a single big textbox in which I was supposed to describe what I do in a narrative fashion, rather than being asked for 10 discrete items."
SampleSize,3e3eg8,swws,3,Tue Jul 21 19:17:27 2015 UTC,Even allowing for the respondent to list fewer than 10 actions would be acceptable. I was forced to just fill the last five with nonsense words for the last question because I couldn't think of anything else.

SampleSize,3dyxy6,D__,5,Tue Jul 21 11:23:18 2015 UTC,I agree. Although to do that for a large scale of individuals becomes unfeasible. Really this is about familiarity vs awareness of cosmetic deception and security indicators.  I am happy to give you a detailed breakdown of what we are trying to achieve.
SampleSize,3dyxy6,BRNXB0MBERS,9,Mon Jul 20 20:46:06 2015 UTC,"I understand.  However, I quit the survey after question 10 or 11 because I had to make too many guesses based on my previous concerns.  Apart from the ""is this in response to something I actually did"" stuff, maybe this is better suited for citizens of the UK?  I would never pay for wifi in the US, but maybe that's a thing in the UK."
SampleSize,3dyxy6,BRNXB0MBERS,3,Mon Jul 20 21:04:47 2015 UTC,"No worries at all. So yes, we have wifi hotspots in the UK where you pay for them e.g. a local service provider hotspot in residential estates.  I totally agree with you and the points you are making. The thing is if for example one of the email requires context that may infer it is a spear phishing email, rather than common unsolicited email. The difference that the survey can determine is what users are looking for based on common cosmetic features that would indicate an attack or not. The research continues on from the survey into more context based experiments later this year... thanks for your interest and feedback it is great to discuss the pros/cons of the survey!"

Also, there were a few things that made me unsure overall, plus the definition of ""attack"" wasn't clearly defined. Some things were fishy and shitty mirror sites but didn't feel like an ""attack"", and some things felt like an ""attack"" but could be innocuous.  Why the fuck would your friend on Skype send you a USB driver?  I guess the positive, however, is that I got only two wrong -- and it was that I thought it was an attack when it was safe overall."

SampleSize,3dyxy6,Leo_Fire,2,Tue Jul 21 07:31:22 2015 UTC,"Hi wkpaccount,  Apologies for that question, it was built before I submitted it! The study questions, demographic are designed to translate (mostly) into measurable and computable variables that will be used in a technical system. The exhibits themselves are designed such that this plays well with the end goal of the dataset. We did a pilot survey prior to this which included much more context, but the results were negligible. The results, so far for this survey are promising in what we want to achieve. The point also is that we do not expect one to know the core details of an attack rather than understand what behaviours lead to the execution of one at the expense of a uers. Given these behaviours we profile, which leads to automation in user warnings and blocking of actions without the need for a user to be an experienced cyber security expert."

That was our first time doing so. Do you enjoy travelling with other people? Sure, but not with a large group.  I can travel with my husband and enjoy it, but would be more stressed if it was a large group of people When looking around your neighbourhood, what sort of places do you look for? Do you mean as a place to live?  We look for a lot of things.  We looked for a neighborhood with lots of things nearby in walking distance, easily accessible to bus routes, local restaurants/shopping, and a neighborhood that has families like us. How often do you travel to remote locations? Depends what you mean by ""remote"".  Our last trip was to a small out-of-the-way beach town, but that was the most ""remote"" place we've ever been to. When you are faced with a problem you don't know how to answer, what is your strategy to solve it? As it relates to travelling, it means having multiple plans or ideas in case something falls apart that day.  We also overplan and try to anticipate any problems we might have and have solutions ready.  If something comes up we weren't anticipating, we try to come up with a reasonable alternative quickly so as to not waste time. Is there anything about travelling that makes you uncomfortable? Uncertainty, talking to strangers, having to be in a situation of dependence on someone else Is okay if I PM you with a follow-up question? Sure."
SampleSize,3dxctb,SmellsLikeDogBuns,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:33:49 2015 UTC,Awesome. Follow up questions are sent. I'm going to draw respondents for gold so hopefully I'll follow up again with that :)
SampleSize,3dxctb,OhYaaah,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:33:23 2015 UTC,"Every damn day. I like to day dream at work =p Google, travel subreddits, wikivoyage, hostelworld Nope, no smartphone or other smart device Larger cities when abroad, smaller towns at home. In 2014? Not much as I was in school. By the end of 2015, I will have taken about 10 trips of varying lengths. Historical sites and good museums are most important, different food/culture than my own currently, opportunity to explore nature. I prefer hostels when solo, hotels when with family. Preferably just my boyfriend, although my family can be ok too. Otherwise solo, not into going with friends/in large groups. I don't quite understand. I guess I look for housing in proximity to grocery stores, restaurants, access to highways, etc. Never. I don't consider many places very remote anymore.  Ask someone who I think might know the answer. Next is to google it. Sexually aggressive people. Sure!"

SampleSize,3due4p,sensedata,13,Mon Jul 20 14:18:26 2015 UTC,"We had a mere 83 respondents this week. So sad. They were (hopefully) all male. The options aren't exclusive, so you could choose to have a mustache and a goatee, for example.  Things of note:   This time there was nothing in particular that attracted my attention. Feel free to make observations if you do see anything."
SampleSize,3due4p,TheSujis,9,Sun Jul 19 15:59:21 2015 UTC,What was the question? What kind of facial hair do you have? Or what would you like to have?
SampleSize,3due4p,guacamully,6,Sun Jul 19 16:50:12 2015 UTC,One's current facial hair style/preferred style.
SampleSize,3due4p,axehomeless,9,Sun Jul 19 17:12:57 2015 UTC,is that how you worded it? because i'd prefer to have a full beard but my current style is none.
SampleSize,3due4p,Labargoth,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:59:52 2015 UTC,"Well.....fuck. In that case, the choice is yours. You can also select both, since the choices are not exclusive."

SampleSize,3due4p,LithiumEnergy,3,Mon Jul 20 06:46:28 2015 UTC,"I've detected an error with the validity of your survey. You said ""men"" but then you left options other than ""beards""."
SampleSize,3due4p,Cwolfe465,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:02:52 2015 UTC,I can't believe more people have sideburns then goatees. interesting. this is why we do surveys.
SampleSize,3due4p,Cwolfe465,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:12:24 2015 UTC,Mustache represent!
SampleSize,3due4p,sami27,-20,Mon Jul 20 10:51:06 2015 UTC,Perhaps the only thing missing is clean shaven? I know its practically the same as 'no facial hair' but personally (as a young adult/adolescent) prefer to differentiate myself to those without facial hair at all. My ability to grow a beard is one I take pride in. Just cause I don't do it doesn't mean I can't. Also you'd be surprised how many grown men just can't grow beards. Personally I prefer to be visibly different to this group (maybe I'm just snobby).
