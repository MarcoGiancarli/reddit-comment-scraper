Corvette,3e0lwf,w_a_w,2,Tue Jul 21 03:45:40 2015 UTC,"You will get what is called ""fair market value"" from his insurance company.  That amount will be based on NADA book value adjusted for the mileage and options specific to your car.  It's very simple and unadjustable.  There will be no negotiating the value unless there is something specific to your car, such as an aftermarket exhaust, stereo, etc that would adjust the value upwards (and you will need receipts to prove the upgrades).  It doesn't matter that he was cited for DUI or DWAI, just simply that he was deemed at fault, and his insurance will pay for your loss.  There was no personal injury, other than your emotional health.  That is difficult to assess and assign monetary value to.  Have you sought out professional care for your mental health ?  If so, and you are diagnosed with a disorder, you can approach this with a personal injury lawsuit.  Otherwise, you will be given a property settlement only, based only on the actual value for the car.  Losing your car certainly sucks..I know, I've lost a few Corvettes as total wrecks - one I owned for 28 years - more than half of my lifetime (and that one caused me significant mental anguish, not to mention physical injuries as well - all thanks to an elementary school teacher that was texting while driving and rammed me doing 50 mph whilst I was at a standstill).  That Corvette, a C3, wasn't worth too much (by book value). It  going to take 15K to repair it, and the book value was $10, so it was deemed a total loss.  Salvage value was around $2,500, so I kept the car, was given about $8K from her insurance company, I kept the car and then immediately sold it as a ""parts car"" on Craigslist for about $5k. I have a C6 (which I think is awesome), but I would much rather have had her hit me it that one - it has airbags so I would probably would have not gotten as busted up, the repairs costs would probably have not risen to the total loss levels, and even if they had, C6's are a dime a dozen. If you owned this C7 without any outstanding loan balance, then the  money that you receive from his insurance company is yours to keep (to buy another car, etc).  If there is a loan against the car, that of course will get paid off before you are compensated.  In any event - So sorry to see your car destroyed, ANY Corvette destroyed, but glad you weren't in it at the time.  Good luck with your future Corvette endeavors."
Corvette,3e0lwf,COPDSTR,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:20:32 2015 UTC,"Keep in mind that what the other insurance company is offering you is nothing more than a settlement so that you don't take it to court. If you don't like their number, you can push back and possibly get a higher offer, or just take it to court and see what a judge decides... whether that's worth pursuing or not will depend on your specific circumstances."
Corvette,3e0lwf,savage24x,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:31:38 2015 UTC,"OP would have to file a suit to sue the other guy's insurance company if he is unwilling to accept their offer.  However in a property claim calculation/settlement such as this, there should really be very little flexibility around the actual value/repair costs regarding OP's vehicle. The insured's insurance company will be willing, able, and expecting, to pay exactly what the reapirs will cost or that value that this car is worth based on actual sales figures for a comparably equipped 2014 C7 with the same mileage."
Corvette,3e0lwf,cthompson07,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:37:30 2015 UTC,"In an ideal world, yes, but this is a for-profit company. I've seen cases where they tried to get away with paying less (below what's reasonable), until they were faced with going to court over it. Claims adjusters are often idiots, and things tend to change in the victim's favor when it gets escalated.  Ultimately, OP is entitled to be made whole again, so that he is in the same position as before the accident... If he is getting a settlement that isn't enough to put him in the same model of car with about the same miles, then something is wrong."

Corvette,3ds96d,TheFakeJerrySeinfeld,15,Sat Jul 18 23:32:34 2015 UTC,"TLDR: Glad you've seen the light  There used to be a strong stigma in the mass media of automobiles against corvettes, and there still is in some areas. For reasons just as you explained, they were viewed as unintelligent redneck jalopies Why? My guess is that corvette was just as good if not better than its competitors for a quarter of the cost, so rendering it as a retards car would stray customers away from the Vette. I read a NYT article on the new Z06 convertible and the writer said, although praising it as a ""bespoke piece of American engineering"", to pass on the car due to its small luggage compartment and lack of a proper stereo  system. Reading that made me want to kill the writer, but I knew better. The Corvette will aways have a place in my conscience. As an ME student, it's very plain to see Chevrolets engineers and designers really have done something amazing. Hell, it's what molded my career choice altogether. They built a car that can go toe to toe with the purebred automobiles of Europe and Asia. Moreover, the new C7 is probably the best car to come out of North America. Period. And for a completely attainable under most wages 55 thousand, its a steal for what you're getting with that car. Aerogel tunnel insulation, carbon fiber, fully functional ducting, direct injection (it really is a piece of automotive innovation), I could go on.   I love a nice Mercedes, Ferrari, or Mclaren as the next guy, but if I had a million dollars to spend right now, I'd buy a new Corvette (Z06 C7R Edition to be specific).  I do not include the C4 in this. Those were ugly and garbage aren't my flavor of styling. Sorry x2  people who own to like C4s  If you don't like what I said, I'm sorry, but please live with it. I bet not everyone on here likes all the models. Can we please stop jumping down my throat before I get banned by defending my opinion."
Corvette,3ds96d,skeptoid79,8,Sun Jul 19 00:10:00 2015 UTC,I do not include the C4 in this.   I object.
Corvette,3ds96d,flaagan,8,Sun Jul 19 00:36:26 2015 UTC,As do I. The C7 is around and has much of its styling cues to thank from the C4. The C4's only fault was existing at a period when smog regulations blindsided a somewhat ignorant domestic manufacturer along with some rather poor management decisions.  I wouldn't own a C7 if it weren't for owning a C4.
Corvette,3ds96d,UndeadVette,8,Sun Jul 19 01:05:27 2015 UTC,And the c4 still performed better than a lot of competition at the time. All that torque. Anyone that says they don't have curves has never sat in one and looked down the hood

That's why you've been getting harsh blizzards in the past couple winters.  If I was you, evaluate your earnings, and if you have enough, I'd go Camaro SS with a Silverado [or  your flavor of truck, but my model, the LT, has a 380~hp LS3 (base model C6 engine) so you'd have year round performance].   I also personally would never drive a ""good"" car in the winter. The salt that they put on the roads eats and steel components and will undoubtedly corrode the aluminum frame of a vette.

For the convertible they added a cross brace under the car, to help with rigidity. Supposedly there's a kit out there to bolt that cross brace onto the bottom of the car, which supposedly fixed the problem. Here is an article talking about it, and supposedly you can buy the cross brace for >$500. I don't know if they actually help, though.

Corvette,3chgxg,iamtheman01,8,Tue Jul 7 23:05:00 2015 UTC,"Something you may not have noticed/cared about is that the car is not a 3LT, it's a 2LT with a HUD added by the previous owner. It still has the 2LT options like power seats and a few other goodies, but a 3LT would have switches for the heated leather seats on the center console. Someone has gone to the trouble of pulling out the entire gauge cluster and gauge surround to install the HUD projector. This isn't a particularly difficult job and shouldn't be an issue if it was done by someone who knew what they were doing, but it does mean that they weren't afraid to take everything apart. Also, I can't tell from the pictures if the car actually has the Z51 package (bigger brakes, drilled rotors, oil & transmission cooler, stiffer sway bars, different gear ratios, etc), but judging from the caliper covers it seems as if they're trying to hide the fact that they bought just the rotors without upgrading the calipers. I wouldn't let all this deter you, but certainly factor it in if you make an offer."
Corvette,3chgxg,HotshotGT,6,Wed Jul 8 12:51:01 2015 UTC,"That price is a little high for an 08 with 36k  on it.

Corvette,3chgxg,troutstomper,2,Tue Jul 7 23:49:50 2015 UTC,I would second the 27K price. Be prepared to walk away if they say no. There are plenty other Vettes and let them know that. It looks like the previous owner added several (some unnecessary) mods. As for a DD be ready to put the mileage on being in a major metro. That will drive the value down tremendously in the future when you're ready for your next Vette.
Corvette,3chgxg,Hoose93,1 point,Tue Jul 7 23:58:25 2015 UTC,I third(?) it. I got my 09 A6 vette with ~38k miles on it and magnaflow exhaust for 28k. Not a steal for it but a fair price in my opinion.

Corvette,3chgxg,HotshotGT,1 point,Wed Jul 8 02:25:20 2015 UTC,"Opinions are like assholes, as the saying goes. I personally think the mods are pretty tasteful in comparison to some of the things I've seen done to other Vettes. Matter of fact, if I didn't already have mine, and this was 8-10k cheaper, I'd consider buying it and being happy that someone spent their money on mods I was going to do eventually. That said, I think it's a decent looking car and the only downside to DD'ing it, in my opinion, is getting in and out of driveways with that front splitter."
Corvette,3chgxg,Contact_8090,1 point,Wed Jul 8 12:33:06 2015 UTC,"Like everyone else here is saying - it's overpriced.  But, keep in mind, that is just the dealer's advertised price.  The dealer is only ""hoping"" he'll find a buyer willing to step up and pay the asking price.  Dealers usually expect buyers to offer less, and then enter into some negotiation for the final amount.  I don't know your market, but summer is high-time Vette buying season, so it's more of a seller's market than a buyer's bonanza.  I would offer 25K as a starting point, and work upwards as the dealer works downward.  He clearly wants to sell the car and make it profitable for himself.  He likely won't give it away for a minimal return on his investment, especially if he hasn't had the car very long, because he knows someone else will come along after you who will end up buying it.  It really then depends on how worth it this car is TO YOU.  Be sure you are doing your comparison shopping. If you live in the Atlanta market, there is something to be said for buying locally, and not having to mess with travelling to get your car because of the downside expense with travelling, although this is sometimes a good move, particularly for a car such as a Corvette.  I will bore you with the details of my find/purchase: I picked up a silver '09 3LT Z51 AT with chrome wheels & dual tops with 11K in 2012 for $32K at an Acura dealership in my metro area (Denver) - they had a window sticker on it for 38,900.  I bought in February (definitely not Corvette season in Colorado).  I've since taken the mileage on the car to 35K.  If I were to sell it, I would expect it to fetch around $25K, maybe a little more, but not much.  So $31,595 for an 08 2LT with 35K is wishful thinking on the dealer's part."
Corvette,3chgxg,mrsmph,1 point,Wed Jul 8 15:31:40 2015 UTC,"WAY too high for an 08.  I just bought my 2011 Grand Sport 2LT, 32,000 miles, very clean,  for 32k plus my Tahoe that was worth 3-4k. It also came with a lifetime powertrain warranty.  It is my DD and I get the biggest stupidest grin on my face every single day when i get in and start it up.  SO worth it to have one as a DD.  Find a better deal, though!"
Corvette,3chgxg,lvtrance,1 point,Wed Jul 8 16:04:49 2015 UTC,Thanks for all the input guys! I decided not to buy as they would not come down past 30k....
Corvette,3chgxg,superman_king,-2,Fri Jul 10 14:43:15 2015 UTC,Automatic. No
Corvette,3chgxg,Gradient_Sauce,3,Wed Jul 8 04:03:55 2015 UTC,"I second this. Automatics usually go for cheaper. If that was a 6 speed manual that price would not be too bad. But for an automatic I would try to get the price lower.  I just bought a 2007 with 29k miles for $27,900, and it was a 6 speed. Also it was from a dealer."
Corvette,3chgxg,ecp30,-1,Wed Jul 8 12:35:38 2015 UTC,"Be wary of the miles on Corvettes, 36k is low for an 8 year old car, but it is still way overpriced even if that were the true mileage.    Anyone can unplug the speedo sensor on the diff and drive the car without adding any miles to the odometer.  I'm always skeptical about these real low mileage vettes, especially one that is modded.  Why would you mod a vette and not drive it?  It's more like, ""oh look, I'm under here anyway putting on the exhaust, let me just unplug the speedo."" Obviously, this is my opinion, so take it as that.  Expand your search to Florida, where you can find a vette within pissing distance at all times.  More supply, lower price, not too far from Georgia."
Corvette,3chgxg,Gradient_Sauce,2,Wed Jul 8 07:35:49 2015 UTC,"Actually I think autos go for about the same or maybe even higher, since most people looking to buy a Vette are older and want high optioned automatics. Manuals are just rare, but not necessarily more expensive. Same with tan interior cars."
Corvette,3ch9lw,Hoosier40,5,Tue Jul 7 22:10:48 2015 UTC,I turned it off when he said previous corvettes have had questionable performance. What car for the $$ has better performance?
Corvette,3ch9lw,vice726,2,Wed Jul 8 01:13:53 2015 UTC,Agreed. I watched 2 minutes of it and had to stop. For a car channel they seem to not be very knowledgeable.
Corvette,3ch9lw,ASH503,0,Wed Jul 8 04:43:32 2015 UTC,I would say almost all cars had questionable performance from the late 70s to early 90s .  I would say the Buick GNX had great performance for its time .
Corvette,3ch9lw,ZTwenty8SS,2,Thu Jul 9 22:50:47 2015 UTC,"They say the front brakes are 14.2"" diameter. That's nothing, my car has brakes that size. The actual size is 15.5"" front, 15.3"" rear with Z07 package.  source"

Corvette,3cfx5o,AgentTangerine,2,Tue Jul 7 19:52:13 2015 UTC,"Have you considered simply removing the system? I don't know exactly what's involved, but you can get a full set of performance shocks for the price of one of yours or well under that for OEM stuff. Ride quality is not bad and handling would likely be improved."

Corvette,3c5dyc,TheInnovatorHD,5,Sat Jul 4 23:27:09 2015 UTC,I had a 91 with auto it seemed really peppy because of 1st gear torque.  above 4000 rpm it struggled with breathe.

Corvette,3c5dyc,IRateBoobies,1 point,Sun Jul 5 15:31:42 2015 UTC,You sir make me want a 96 more than anything right now. How much did you pay for her? Also is is manual transmission?
Corvette,3c5dyc,IRateBoobies,1 point,Mon Jul 6 10:39:18 2015 UTC,Yeah the lt4 only came in a 6 speed.  Under 10k and had less than 80k miles.
Corvette,3c5dyc,C4gery,2,Mon Jul 6 21:42:12 2015 UTC,"you can easily get a nice LT1 for that price if you like the later bodystyle  personally my favorite year of C4 is 1990 due to being the only year you could get the newer interior with the original body style, also the 6 speed was introduced starting in 1989"
Corvette,3c5dyc,Ngoscope,2,Sun Jul 5 00:58:34 2015 UTC,"I'd go '91, I love my '91. As long as you find one that hasn't had its wiring hacked and slashed, you are good. And performance and repair part are fairly easy to come by. I also have a '95, and while the lt1 is a good motor and makes good power, but I prefer the higher torque the the l98 gives. And the money you save by getting a l98 can go to mods that put it well above an lt1. I like the interior of the 91 better than the 95, the seats are much better, and you don't have to deal with optispark (seriously, the water pump is located above the ignition system. If the water pump goes bad it leaks water all over the electrical system). It just depends on if you want a car you're not going to mod (lt1) or one you save money on and mod (l98). Either way, if you fine one in mint condition you can't go wrong. Just find one with a manual, z51 or fx3 suspension, and the j55 break option (if possible)."
Corvette,3c5dyc,cigarmanpa,2,Sun Jul 5 03:01:28 2015 UTC,"the l98 makes a good amount of low end torque, though not as much as everyone thinks and runs out of breath quite quickly. it's not a bad car at all, it's fun, it feels a lot faster then it is, it handles fine, and for $7500 it's a hell of a buy. I hope you have some other money set aside for insurance, fuel, repairs."
Corvette,3c5dyc,ItalianFlyer,2,Sun Jul 5 16:59:05 2015 UTC,"The key for C4s is to get the cleanest and best maintained one you can afford, so shop around rather than focus on a specific year/color combination/feature list. Service records are a big plus, otherwise assume nothing has been done at the recommended interval and address it within the first few months. The electricals in the later model years are more reliable, and the cars seem to get more well put together as the years go in terms of fit and finish. The L98 is easier to work on, but if you want the performance of an LT1, I suggest a 95 or 96 since they have the vented optispark design which is less prone to failure from moisture. Overall they are good cars, loads of fun and very reliable, but they have a tendency to nickle and dime you to death if you want it perfect, from which my first statement! I daily drive mine and want to drive it like it was intended to (therefore hard) so I noticed that first hand since I usually overkill on maintenance as a result. Mine didn't come with records so i'm slowly replacing all the vital components and wear items to make sure it's reliable for another 100k miles Good luck finding the best one for you and don't forget to wave once you do. BTW I paid exactly 8k for my 1996 plus 1500$ in maintenance and repairs so far (mostly parts and some labor for the jobs I didn't want to do), which I expect to go up to 2500 by the time i can consider myself happy with the condition"
Corvette,3c5dyc,nothing_clever,1 point,Sun Jul 5 01:31:45 2015 UTC,"I'd say go with '92 and up, so you have the LT1. I paid $6400 for my 1993."

Corvette,3c5dyc,IRateBoobies,1 point,Sun Jul 5 10:00:13 2015 UTC,I have had a c5 and if your in it for the better car go c5.  I bought a c4 because I liked the looks of it and bought the best motor I could afford in it.  the lt4
Corvette,3c5dyc,IRateBoobies,2,Sun Jul 5 10:12:22 2015 UTC,What c5 would you recommend? I'm kind of interested now.
Corvette,3c5dyc,cigarmanpa,1 point,Sun Jul 5 10:14:30 2015 UTC,Well I only state this because of traction control and stability control.  But I had a 01 coupe 6 speed.  I've had 3 corvettes and the c5 was the best of them.  But I now have a 96 and have the best of both worlds.  Traction control and stability control but with older computers.  Doesn't make a shit it will still save your ass on going 84mph in a 45mph curve with bald tires.  The car is smarter than my right foot.    I just always had a hard on for c4 corvettes.  So go with the best that you can afford but preferably 95 or 96 6 speed.  EDit :  keep in mind that weather stripping is 20 years old so that is something that will have to be addressed as well as a few odds and ends.
Corvette,3c5dyc,IRateBoobies,2,Sun Jul 5 10:19:50 2015 UTC,"Thank you for all that information, from what I've been told, the best c4 I could get for the price is either the 95 or 96."
Corvette,3c5dyc,cigarmanpa,1 point,Sun Jul 5 10:25:26 2015 UTC,For what you have to spend 95 6 speed or if you take your time and don't mind a few miles from the right buyer a 96 6 speed which will get you the lt4.    Happy Motoring and don't forget to save the wave!

Corvette,3c2z14,drsfmd,2,Sat Jul 4 12:36:30 2015 UTC,"It's the light sensor in the top left part of the dash. That little square thing is a light sensor. If it goes out it'll keep the screen dim.

Corvette,3buu67,chbrules,2,Fri Jul 3 04:03:52 2015 UTC,"I had a SPEC 2+ in mine.  Only slightly heavier clutch feel than stock, not bad at all.

Corvette,3buu67,Spinolio,2,Thu Jul 2 13:00:42 2015 UTC,"5th ends at 176mph. The C5's aero was not really made for that or more in stock form, and I don't imagine its clutch was either.  Perhaps at that high of a rotational speed, the clutch assembly's clamping ability is lightened from the rotational forces, making the clutch feel less ""clampy."" I could only imagine aftermarket performance solutions would solve this."

Corvette,3bng6n,Chameleon4242,2,Tue Jun 30 17:00:21 2015 UTC,"You may have already verified, but you need to make sure the fans are actually working. Also, peek underneath and check that the air intake under the bumper doesn't have something blocking it, like a plastic grocery sack.  The big radiator will help a good bit. Be prepared to modify the fan shroud and the upper and lower clamshells a bit, went through this same process last year. An angle grinder with a cutoff wheel can be used to reduce the thickness of the shroud and the other required cuts."
Corvette,3bng6n,spctrbytz,1 point,Tue Jun 30 17:27:56 2015 UTC,Thanks for the reply. I did shock the fans and they're good. I haven't changed the radiator on a c4 but I did put a 3 row in my c3 and I've read that the upgrade in the c4 is actually easier. Hoping it all goes smooth.
Corvette,3bng6n,nothing_clever,2,Tue Jun 30 17:35:15 2015 UTC,"I've also heard putting in that radiator helps. The '91 has digital readouts for the oil and coolant, right? What temperatures are they reading?  On my '93 (so, different engine, but still I worry about heating) what looks like ""close to redline"" reads as ~230F for the coolant, which is when the fans are programmed to turn on. Do you have trouble when moving, or just when the car is running?   What radiator did you order?"
Corvette,3bng6n,nothing_clever,1 point,Tue Jun 30 18:18:37 2015 UTC,"91 still has analog for those but oil is lass than half way. Coolant maxes out at 280 iirc. At work and the car is at home. My money is actually on bent find restricting airflow, but if I'm pulling it to straighten them out, I might as well upgrade. And again, there was no issue back in NY. This started just about when I got to 100+ temps."
Corvette,3bng6n,Corvette512,2,Tue Jun 30 18:37:03 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's fair. I live in northern California and have driven through a few days just over 100F and the car got warm but didn't give me too much trouble."
Corvette,3bng6n,Corvette512,2,Tue Jun 30 18:43:22 2015 UTC,"The front end of the c4's are giant vacuum cleaners. Leaves and road debris (plastic and trash) like to get wedged up under there. Check underneath the radiator for debris, that may help.   Also, check the normal passageways for any leaks. Make sure the radiator and overflow reservoir are full. Do you know how to ""burp"" the system to get all the air out?  Also also, what's the fluid like? If its an L98, its gotta be the green stuff. The LT1 motors need DexCool, which is orange. Check for any discoloration or oil deposits in the fluid."

Corvette,3azrx9,CJC_Swizzy,1 point,Wed Jun 24 20:36:44 2015 UTC,"Probably should ask a mechanic near you.  I think the 84 took R-12 which can only be sold/installed by approved vendors, and if your system leaks they will not do it.  You can get some refrigerants (R-143A) at auto stores but your system will need to be retrofitted to accept this."
Corvette,3azrx9,BiochemBrewer,1 point,Wed Jun 24 22:10:25 2015 UTC,"Unless the car has been converted to R131a or R134a C4's used R12. R12 blows cooler, thus I keep it in my older cars unless absolutely necessary to convert. That said you'll need around 3lb of R12 to fill it if it's bone dry.  Here's where I buy R12 from:. They no longer sell it at local stores thus you'll need to get it online or convert to 134 (pain to do, costs quite a bit and in the end is less efficient at cooling than R12).  As far as steps, I'm sure there are tons of YouTube videos out there but long story short you connect and charge from the low side - turn the car on and turn the AC to max - begin charging and checking the pressure until you're at 50psi."
Corvette,3azrx9,Eight-Seconds,1 point,Wed Jun 24 22:25:41 2015 UTC,"Check for leaks before refilling it, especially with R12. Refrigerant isn't ever supposed to run out or need topping off. You need to find and fix your leaks first.  A vacuum pump can be used to verify that it's not holding pressure. Leakfinding can be done with dyes or pressurizing the system with a DRY gas like nitrogen or CO2 (not air from your compressor), then putting a soap/water mixture on the lines to look for bubbles."
Corvette,3azrx9,skftw,1 point,Wed Jun 24 23:28:43 2015 UTC,"Good info, to add to your leak detection techniques I personally prefer to use a black light. Here's an example of black light leak detection  Auto Refrigerants sells a Quick Charge kit that includes a can of stopleak - and to your point, if you're low there's a reason :)"

Corvette,3azrx9,skftw,1 point,Wed Jun 24 23:53:57 2015 UTC,"Once you find a leak, how do you go about fixing it? Is it normally just a matter of going through and replacing old o-rings?"
Corvette,3azrx9,nothing_clever,1 point,Thu Jun 25 17:23:26 2015 UTC,"Hopefully just o rings between parts. Leaks can also come from cracks in the evaporator or condensor, seals in the compressor, rubber lines breaking down, etc. The only major ones are the compressor and the evaporator, usually. The others are relatively inexpensive and generally easy to replace (though I've never had to replace them on a Corvette."

Either way, I've seen dark grey C7's with flat black stripe packages from the factory (but had black wheels). They look amazing, and I think that would be the way to go. Red would work well with white, but not darker colors (for me at least), and silver on grey is too similar to me. Just my 2 cents."

Corvette,3awaji,SeismicAltop,5,Wed Jun 24 03:59:11 2015 UTC,"The head unit was easy. The hard part was that I ran new wires to the rear speakers, doors and to the dash. Removing all of the Bose components was a bitch because you nearly had to take the entire door off and mounting brackets to the dash required me to rip it apart. The sub box is custom done for 2 10in subs. The 3000 watt amp is located under the passenger seat. It probably took me 20 or so hours to do."

Corvette,3awaji,jenjen3252,3,Wed Jun 24 16:33:55 2015 UTC,"Pretty straight forward.

Taking off the dash cover is easy as well just look for the screws, be careful screwing it back on though as you can crack the plastic."

Corvette,3aoqep,Remigus,6,Mon Jun 22 06:58:08 2015 UTC,"The C5 Z06 was only made in manual. They sell SC kits all over the place that have everything you need. The engine should hold up well to modest boost, but obviously more stress on the engine will reduce long-term engine life no matter what.  In terms of things to look out for, mainly, look at the error code readout on the dash computer - http://www.stengel.net/diccodes.htm  Those can be deleted, so always be sure to take the car out for a test drive and see what pops up. You could also take it to the dealer for an inspection. Things that usually go are the ABS unit, speed sensors, column lock, the valve springs are junk, and I heard that sometimes 2nd gear can pop out if the forks are bent. Overall, the car is incredibly reliable. Here's a post about known issues:  http://www.ebay.com/gds/C5-CORVETTE-COMMON-PROBLEMS-/10000000177428688/g.html"

Especially if you have a 02-03, as those are the most likely to fail. I had one break only two weeks after buying the car while I was just cruising, but I'm lucky it didn't take anything else in the motor with it.

Corvette,3aoqep,snackdrag,1 point,Mon Jun 22 13:07:10 2015 UTC,building for NA is very different than building for forced induction.  It's almost mutually exclusive parts/tuning.  So you need to pick a direction you want to go.

This weekend my upper hose went out but for less than 50 bucks I was back in no less form than before I started.  I'd say if you don't enjoy working on the time to time thing go newer.

Corvette,3a0t1n,ItalianFlyer,3,Tue Jun 16 22:54:53 2015 UTC,"95 and 96 have a revised Optispark design that is more reliable and less prone to getting ruined by moisture. Overall they are reliable cars, just make sure to find one that has been taken care of. Even the newer models are starting to show their age, so expect to have to replace some of the wearable components soon, like brakes, some suspension components, rubber parts, fluids and all your normal maintenance items. Working on them is a little more involved than your average econobox but nothing that can't be done in a day's DIY work, just some parts are a tight squeeze to get to. Expect to work on them every once in a while, mostly for preventive maintenance, but if you do they will treat you well and put a smile on your face every day. Make sure you get one with the electricals sorted out as they tended to be quircky and can easily become a nightmare to diagnose. In that regard later model years had better built electrical systems than the earlier ones. Bonus is that 96 is OBD II so easier to diagnose if it ever throws a code.

Corvette,3a0t1n,banduu,3,Tue Jun 16 14:08:52 2015 UTC,"I drove my 92, 6 speed daily through all NY weather, even snow, for 4 years till a Pizza delivery boy decided not to stop at a stop sign. Over the years I've owned her, the 1 Major issue I had was clutch related. The adjuster for the clutch for loosened which caused the clutch for to drag on the flywheel, stalling the engine. Had to pull the Trans out, replaced the rear main seal, flywheel, and clutch while I was there. She had about 120k miles at the time.   I heard rumors you can buy dual mass flywheels anymore (the type of flywheel that came with the C4) and have to use a single mass flywheel and some sort of clutch spacer to make up the size difference.   I did a tuneup when I first got her, plugs, wires, new MSD Optispark and MSD coil. All in all was my favorite car I've owned. She had power, handling, looks, and capable of so much."
Corvette,3a0t1n,nothing_clever,3,Tue Jun 16 14:13:46 2015 UTC,Did the MSD optispark have vents for vacuum lines? I understand I can buy AC Delco cap and rotor that will fit my car (93) and have vents to hook up to vacuum lines to prevent moisture damage. But I think the only vented MSD opti didn't fit early LT1's.
Corvette,3a0t1n,banduu,3,Tue Jun 16 15:54:45 2015 UTC,"There was a vacuum hose vent to remove moisture. Instructions said to hook it up to the intake. Drilled a small hole through the rubber close to the throttle body. I think the fitting was included with the Opti-Spark but not sure, was a while ago. As you may or may not know '92 was the first year of the LT1. Another BIG piece of advice. Early '92's had a different electrical connector to the Opti than Mid '92's and later. Of course, I had an early '92 and didn't realize until EVERYTHING was back together. Its the same 4 wire electrical system, just the plug from the cars wiring harness is different. I found one from a junk yard and wired it up. Ecklers or CorvetteAmerica may have the connector also. If you need anything else PM me. I know the car in and out.    After having her sit for the past 3 years, I am fixing her. I'll posting updates and pics as I go. I'm sure someone will love to see.  EDIT just looked at the link you posted. You can see the vent hose to the Opti in the pic of the engine. Just another comment. The Polo green is hard to find and even HARDER to find in a 6 speed, which is why I'm fixing mine. I think the price is a bit high but you're paying for the Color, Trans, and Mileage. All in all, seems like a great deal. You won't be disappointed."
Corvette,3a0t1n,banduu,1 point,Tue Jun 16 21:03:43 2015 UTC,"Thanks a ton! This is all great info. My only concerns were that its a '93 so no airbag, no OBDII, and, of course, the older optispark.   I'm learning a lot from everyone here and I really appreciate it!"
Corvette,3a0t1n,nothing_clever,3,Tue Jun 16 21:46:28 2015 UTC,There should be a drivers side airbag at least. Not a deal breaker for me.

Corvette,3a0t1n,nothing_clever,2,Tue Jun 16 15:23:14 2015 UTC,"All good advice here so far. I would also try to get one that has had new tires put on it recently. It's a lot of rubber and can be expensive. Also, buy a coupe. It's nicer to drive and you can take the roof off anyway. If you want a 6-speed car, your choices will be quite limited because most of these cars were built with automatics. Try to find one with decent weather stripping.  Your budget is realistic and you shouldn't have a problem finding a pretty good one for that money, although I don't know what the SoCal market is for these. I found a fantastic '94 coupe with a 6-speed and 48k miles on the east coast for $10k. The only problems I've had with it were a bad power steering pump and a flat tire."

Corvette,3a0t1n,rangerfan88,2,Tue Jun 16 20:44:29 2015 UTC,I've got a 96. It's like any older car. Things will break but most of the work isn't as hard as people make it out to be. The biggest problem I've had is the cooling system. If you live in California I suggest you invest in a bigger aluminum radiator. Otherwise it's a great daily driver.

Corvette,39swds,Obnoxiousdonkey,1 point,Thu Jun 18 06:05:08 2015 UTC,"I have never seen any Corvette Racing related posts on this sub. And most of the motorsports subs, especially /r/wec have rules against posting spoilers for certain lengths of time because they realize not everyone can watch a 24 hour race (pr even a 6 hour race) live.   I understand this sub doesn't have that rule but.. well its unfortunate."

Corvette,39fmfd,Aeonus,8,Thu Jun 11 12:14:57 2015 UTC,"Shoot, I knew it before I even owned mine.  First time I rode in someone else's, I noticed the electronic door buttons.  My next thought after that was ""well, these are useless if the battery dies, so I wonder where the manual release is"".  Looked around for a few seconds and found it easily.  Of course I also read the manuals of every car I own cover to cover and investigate every single feature of the car (usually before I even buy it)."

Corvette,39fmfd,cajunmagic,6,Thu Jun 11 13:21:19 2015 UTC,Here's a c6. C7 is similar. Right in front of the seat rails. Only way it could possibly be missed is if he had the seat literally all the way forward. Even then..   http://www.autotraderclassics.com/images/a/cms/48116/48116.jpg

Corvette,39fmfd,Aeonus,5,Thu Jun 11 13:26:10 2015 UTC,"And it's not even hidden either, they're giant levers centered by the doorsill. Easily 2 or 3 times the size of fuel door release levers back when everything was cable operated."
Corvette,39fmfd,skftw,22,Thu Jun 11 14:15:08 2015 UTC,"Didn't know about the manual release, didn't think about breaking a window, so he died.   Can't help but feel Darwin won here."
Corvette,39fmfd,superstubb,8,Thu Jun 11 12:19:27 2015 UTC,And he left his cell phone at a Waffle House by accident. Freak chain of mishappenings.
Corvette,39fmfd,Aeonus,10,Thu Jun 11 12:20:01 2015 UTC,"Choosing to die instead of breaking open your car window so you can climb out or call for help is not a mishappening, it's fucking stupid."
Corvette,39fmfd,superstubb,11,Thu Jun 11 12:22:08 2015 UTC,"Well, I mean, he WAS old, so it is possible he may not have had the mental capability of not panicking in the situation.   I mean, my 76 year old grandmother I have to tape off all the buttons on her TV remote except for power/volume/channel otherwise she gets mini panic attacks and can't figure the thing out, lol.  It scares me someone like that is driving a high powered death machine, but it is possible.  Still, what are the chances you forget your cell phone, your battery cables come unconnected magically while in your car, and you also don't know about the manual release and there's nobody around to help? Story sounds fishy."

Corvette,39fmfd,Gradient_Sauce,3,Thu Jun 11 16:58:24 2015 UTC,"He was old as fuck, probably had the arm strength of a 13 year old girl. Easy to say as a strapping young man."

Corvette,39fmfd,Aeonus,2,Thu Jun 11 13:31:39 2015 UTC,"Some of the tops are very tight, he may not have had the hand / arm strength to pop the latches."
Corvette,39fmfd,mondain,6,Thu Jun 11 13:51:49 2015 UTC,"To be fair, try breaking a car window with your hands, from the inside, seated in a cockpit style cab.  Good luck.   It's also hard to pass judgement without knowing the man or the exact circumstances.  I'm am absolutely positive it was an oven in that car when he got in and shut the door. Panic sets in quickly followed by heat exhaustion.  He was old and possibly with health issues, remember that, with a dog that was probably going ballistic, so we could be talking on the order of less than 30 seconds.  You'd be surprised how quickly straight thinking disappears when you start seeing stars from heat."
Corvette,39fmfd,Gradient_Sauce,2,Thu Jun 11 16:48:46 2015 UTC,"I didn't see if he had his keys with him in this situation. Wouldn't it be possible, yet probably painful to take the tip of the key and strike the window or is the glass to hard to do that?"
Corvette,39fmfd,sithlordtaco42,2,Fri Jun 12 02:06:25 2015 UTC,"Score the window with the key first, then hit it.  That's what works best."
Corvette,39fmfd,Gradient_Sauce,6,Fri Jun 12 02:38:06 2015 UTC,"When I bought my first c6, the dealer showed me the releases, the key fob port in the glovebox, the manual gas cap release, and the ""keyed"" entry in the rear. This should be part of their job and no one IMHO should operate a vehicle that they have no training on."
Corvette,39fmfd,mondain,7,Thu Jun 11 13:54:59 2015 UTC,I see your point but also feel it should be on the owner of the vehicle to read the owners booklett. It sucks this guy died. Sucks also he took his dog with him. It could have all been prevented if he read the booklett.
Corvette,39fmfd,TheFedds,3,Thu Jun 11 15:30:54 2015 UTC,"Agreed on all points. In my case, even though the guy showed me what was what, I still read or at least skimmed my manual."
Corvette,39fmfd,mondain,5,Thu Jun 11 15:50:24 2015 UTC,Right on. It's unfathomable someone could spend tens of thousands of dollars on a recreational vehicle and not even take a look through the manual so see all the features you just purchased!
Corvette,39fmfd,TheFedds,4,Thu Jun 11 16:03:19 2015 UTC,"In addition to the manual release, this is another reason you need to have a window breaker/seat belt cutter in your car. Just looked on Amazon and they're $3-$4 and can get you out of your car if there's an accident, mechanical malfunction, or you're in water."

Corvette,38xjjx,adamk24,3,Sun Jun 7 18:16:44 2015 UTC,Such a great car. I'm not a fan of the C5 corvette interior but the Z06 was just staggering performance for the money in it's day. Even more than 10 years later and it's still one of the fastest cars you can buy for the track.
Corvette,38xjjx,RPLLL,3,Sun Jun 7 18:42:06 2015 UTC,The performance:dollar ratio now that they are depreciated is truly insane.  A very fast car that always leaves me wondering if my 445whp STi is my favorite or if its this thing now.  The Corvette just feels so put together and the grip/torque is wild.
Corvette,38xjjx,RPLLL,1 point,Sun Jun 7 18:44:22 2015 UTC,"Why would you favor the corvette over the STi, and vise versa?"
Corvette,38xjjx,nickbreaksstuff,2,Mon Jun 8 03:49:01 2015 UTC,"There are so many differences but the gist of it is:  STi Pros:   100ish more HP than my z06. AWD makes getting power to the ground much easier. Big turbo makes cool whoosh noises. Better city mpg than my Corvette. Looks cool, sounds cool. Modified to the gills.   STi Cons:   Loud. Seriously uncomfortable. Highway fuel economy not as good as Corvette. Turbo lag. Runs methanol.   Corvette Pros:   Sound/feel of big v8 motor. Curb appeal. VERY comfortable especially compared to my STi which is really a track car at this point. Highway mileage. Torque to cruise at low rpm and the gearing to match. Stock, with stock reliability.   Corvette Cons:   Too low for NYC driving, scrapes on the street and especially on speed bumps. Large engine gets terrible fuel economy in real city traffic.  Like 6-8 MPG.  This is a function of not ever being able to go far enough to increase the ""miles"" part of ""miles per gallon"". The stock z06 shifter has really long throws and feels kind of like driving a truck.   I'd love to track them back to back and see which is actually faster.  I know the wider tires of the corvette and the wide powerband couples with the wide gearbox would be very nice on the road course, but the STi is fully built and has had literally every part replaced with something beefy and aftermarket for the road course, and also has 100hp/100lb-ft advantage.    http://i.imgur.com/Q3lLrNf.jpg"

The corvette forum is a great spot for advice and pointers, just don't spend too much time or money buying shiny things for the new love in your life.   As a stock car, the C6 is pretty robust. And the LS3 is reliable and at 16k miles has at least another 100k in her before she needs much.   Just remember that it's a premium car so... Good gas, good and regular maintenance.

Corvette,38h70r,frogjizz,1 point,Thu Jun 4 15:11:50 2015 UTC,Not a helluva lot.  I just sold my 2009 C6 with 56k miles and it was pretty much perfect.  Seat wear was the biggest issue really.
Corvette,38h70r,uber_neutrino,-1,Thu Jun 4 16:07:31 2015 UTC,"I bought a 2010 C6 Grand Sport (Heritage Edition) almost exactly 2 years ago with 4K miles on it.  I've now just past 16K and she's a beast.  Love my baby, and I bet you will, too.  Just be careful when you open her up, the local constabulary wasn't kind to me when they caught me passing a slowpoke doing 93 in a 55.  But now I have street cred so I got that going for me, which is nice!"
Corvette,387tv8,LingenfelterLPE,5,Tue Jun 2 13:52:10 2015 UTC,"That is true but it won't counter depreciation. Just kinda crazy considering what you could do with that price tag. Starting at 0 hp.  None the less, an amazing car. Especially at 700+"
Corvette,387tv8,PaigeTheGreat,3,Tue Jun 2 20:25:12 2015 UTC,If your worried about resale on a new corvette your going to have a really bad time.
Corvette,387tv8,XiXyness,2,Wed Jun 3 01:28:58 2015 UTC,That price. Little steep for 70 hp lol.
Corvette,387tv8,PaigeTheGreat,4,Tue Jun 2 16:17:12 2015 UTC,Did you take into consideration the fact that it comes with a four wheel alignment?
Corvette,387tv8,SomebodyAtOasis,10,Tue Jun 2 16:24:40 2015 UTC,And you can call your C7 a Lingenfelter.
Corvette,387tv8,Axiomiat,2,Tue Jun 2 16:34:01 2015 UTC,Also a full detail which is a decent chunk of change
Corvette,387tv8,Neon_Orange_,3,Tue Jun 2 22:54:52 2015 UTC,"Perhaps, but this package could increase the resale value of the car by namesake alone."
Corvette,387tv8,jkmimages,1 point,Tue Jun 2 17:08:21 2015 UTC,"Yes, but $4k isn't so much on an $80k car, especially when you consider that a lot of people end up tacking on another $20k in options. It's definitely a price that this market segment will pay."
