amiibo,3e2lkl,MrRaspberryJam,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:45:40 2015 UTC,"I don't like the idea of Amiibo booster packs. At all.  First off - 3 cards per pack, and we don't (currently) know how much they'll be. If they're more expensive than a YuGiOh or Pokemon booster, no-one will want to buy them.  Second - You're not even guaranteed cards you want. They should've done blister packs where you get a number of guaranteed cards, instead of 3 randoms. This defeats what seemed to be the point of Amiibo in the first place.  Third - Rares are going to be ridiculous to get. Unlike your figures, you can get a rare guaranteed as long as you find it and/or are willing to pay for it. With these packs, you're not guaranteed your rares (if rarities exist in the packs), which means people going after one specific rare character are going to be royally screwed.  I'll stop there. I just hate the idea of random boosters as it defeats the point of Amiibo in my opinion."

Good to know since the amiibos you want could be popping in and out of MSRP and this gives you a pretty decent time window in order to get the most amiibo all together for the cheaper shipping.

amiibo,3e2n0z,Numel1,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:59:42 2015 UTC,How long do they hold your package for?
amiibo,3e2n0z,RedRing14,2,Tue Jul 21 14:32:17 2015 UTC,"They can hold it up to 60 days, BUT packages can only be consolidated within 30 days and once it has been consolidated that's it, cannot be done twice."
amiibo,3e2n0z,heyrich,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:36:21 2015 UTC,"People should also note that you can order and send to Tenso without having a verified account, but you will need a verified account address to have Tenso ship to you. So, if you see products up on Amazon Japan, go ahead and make that account quickly and lock in those preorders.  The first time you ship from Tenso, you are required to have them send to the address provided on the ID you give them. Once the first shipment is completed to that address, you are free to edit your shipping address at your discretion.  Tenso will hold your packages for 60 days. Within the first 30 days of that period, you will be allowed to consolidate multiple packages being held for you. The fee for two packages to be consolidated is 500 yen, going up from there."
amiibo,3e2n0z,rottedzombie,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:43:37 2015 UTC,Fucking tenso keeps refusing my proof when it has everything saying my info is wrong. I've checked it fifty times. I think someone sees my last name then first name on my id and doesn't get it. Pisses me off. I must have tried fifty times.
amiibo,3e2n0z,Radiodisease1900,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:07:01 2015 UTC,If the ID has your middle name on it put your middle name in the first and last name box as well as the name box.        Name(first and last) John Doe.      Name (alphabet) John Robert Doe.       On ID it shows. Doe. John Robert.      So you actually fill in your info.      Name (first and last) John Robert Doe.     Name (alphabet) John Robert Doe.    I know that's a long explanation but that was what was stopping me from being verified was my middle names.  They wouldn't verify until my middle names were in both lines since they're on my ID as well.
amiibo,3e2n0z,awwwzee,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:23:00 2015 UTC,OPs numbers are way higher than they should be.  I just shipped 6 Yarn Yoshi Amiibo with consolidation and paid 3500 Yen or $28 USD.  http://i.imgur.com/cEiS5Nz.jpg

amiibo,3e2dez,ZiggyPalffyLA,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:17:08 2015 UTC,"Well, is it worth $7 extra/each to guarantee not have to deal with the retailer exclusive/rarity/reservations/wake up at 3am/Hitting F5 for 6 hours on amazon US.  I say yes, and just ordered them.   Worst case scenario is that the amiibos end up being easily attainable in stores, and you ""lose"" ~$20.  Best case is that you're not checking websites every goddamn day because Olimar is only available in a Gamestop 72 miles away or on an Amazon 3rd party seller for $63.99 + FREE SHIPPING.  I just reset my expectations a few months ago and accepted that Amiibos will cost me $20/ea instead of $13/ea via imports  Now I can spend that time fighting in the game instead of fighting the best buy website or whatever."

There is no way to undo light exposure so the best way to extend the life of an object is to limit it.  That being said, I personally don't believe that Amiibos are worth museum-quality care."
amiibo,3e35mv,ValkyrieVance,0,Tue Jul 21 16:45:25 2015 UTC,"I keep them NiB because I think they look better displayed that way, and I think their in-game function is poo-poo-garbage. So I don't care about them being damaged by UV light, or anything else. I don't buy them with the intent of reselling or hoarding until the value increases. And I think that goes for most NiB collectors. I don't see why so many can't wrap their head around that."

amiibo,3e35mv,Gluetendo,2,Tue Jul 21 17:05:31 2015 UTC,I keep them NiB because I think they look better displayed that way...   Notice that the way I worded it implies that is an opinion. My opinion. I think they look better in the box. You're welcome to think whatever you'd like as well.

amiibo,3e35mv,JustAnAnimator,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:47:32 2015 UTC,"For one, you kept reiterating that you were stating your opinion when all I was doing was stating mine to begin with. You didn't really need to reply, to be honest.   I knew it was an opinion from the very beginning, then I stated mine. So that's why you need to chill. The connotation and the fact you had to reply to me implies you weren't chill."
amiibo,3e35mv,Gluetendo,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:52:34 2015 UTC,"Not really 'They look better…' is an assertion, not an opinion. It didn't come across as particularly 'chill'.  (ps I like them both OOB and NIB)"

amiibo,3e1l6x,GayyLuigi,2,Tue Jul 21 17:08:12 2015 UTC,I'm referring more to the hate he's been getting.  Like people acting like Jigglypuff ledge-camping is worthy of rabid hate but Fox laser-camping is somehow completely okay.

amiibo,3e1l6x,CosmicBubbles,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:45:51 2015 UTC,Had a heart attack when I saw Hbox's tweet about him losing his sweet custom controller on stage (pink with a green ribbon).
amiibo,3e1l6x,IcedKappaccino,3,Tue Jul 21 15:47:04 2015 UTC,"Good thing he found it later. That was an amazing controller, and the fan looked really happy to present it to him."
amiibo,3e1l6x,AwkwardPSI,9,Tue Jul 21 17:22:01 2015 UTC,"I'll be honest, his edge-camp/time-out strategy was pretty foul, but that Jigglypuff costume is pretty great."
amiibo,3e1l6x,CatalinaFightSwan,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:56:46 2015 UTC,"See, the thing about that is people don't realize that Armada was laser camping too. The difference is that Hbox looks more blatant doing it but Armada is literally lasering in place, and since he looks like he's attacking, people aren't putting him at fault. Hbox would be the only one at fault if Armada was actually attempting to pursue him."
amiibo,3e1l6x,ss4444gogeta,7,Tue Jul 21 13:42:03 2015 UTC,"But the thing is, in that match, Hbox's endgame was the time-out rather than really forcing an approach by Armada and punishing. It's like how FilipinoChamp went for the time-out in UMVC3 at EVO last year. Or how Mayweather didn't really trade punches once he felt like he had the score lead against Pacquiao. Don't get me wrong, I think Hbox is a great player, it's just that one strategy during that one match was disappointing to watch as a spectator."
amiibo,3e1l6x,CatalinaFightSwan,3,Tue Jul 21 16:51:31 2015 UTC,"Why is camping suddenly okay because there's a different end goal. HBox played to win and took the strategy he thought would be optimal in that situation, which is the mindset of a pro. One playstyle isn't better or worse than another playstyle because spectators prefer one, the only thing that makes one better than another is the results."
amiibo,3e1l6x,jodansokutogeri,2,Tue Jul 21 19:04:34 2015 UTC,"So edge camping is bad, but there's nothing wrong with laser camping?"

Normally they would be put on the floor, but he offered to hold them for me since my Palutena pre-order from them was really late. So I said to just hold Lucina and Robin for me since I had Ike and Marth already, and later that week I picked them up.

amiibo,3dyunj,zerotwo2,9,Mon Jul 20 17:32:29 2015 UTC,fellow papercrafter here. keep up the good work. just wanted to make a suggestion regarding your printing/paper weight.  staples or other similar printing place will do a color page for somewhere around $1 on a nice flimsy cardstock.  They'll laser it so you'll get a richer color than what i think might be an inkjet youre using now. It will also hold up better during the folding process and you'll see less buckling/paper warping.  Looking forward to seeing your next models
amiibo,3dyunj,frankrenault,4,Mon Jul 20 17:33:00 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the advice! I'm kinda limited to printer paper and basic materials at the moment right now, but when I'm able to I'm going to rebuild these with the proper paper/printing methods."
amiibo,3dyunj,_Mr_Brightside_,2,Mon Jul 20 17:35:29 2015 UTC,"This gave me an awesome idea. I'm not sure how big these papercrafts are, but from the pictures OP posted of his, if I were to get these printed out in the way you mentioned they seem like they could fit neatly inside these HORI cases. This would make such an awesome diorama to display safely. OP feel free to steal this idea and make millions in an etsy shop. Keep up the awesome work!"

amiibo,3dyunj,Gluetendo,5,Mon Jul 20 17:34:13 2015 UTC,"Well, sort of. It's a bit more complicated than that. I need to essentially rebuild the stages from scratch using existing textures from the game. There's also a lot of measuring involved of course to make sure everything lines up properly."
amiibo,3dyunj,KrysInColor,4,Mon Jul 20 17:37:21 2015 UTC,Yeah. I understand all the measuring so it would be hard to make a Halberd one because of how round it is. I'm trying to get a Meta Knight and since he is my favorite character I would love to have a display like this too. Also nice how you put DK in reference to DK being a boss in Punch-Out.
amiibo,3dyunj,KrysInColor,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:56:29 2015 UTC,"Hmm, can't say I've played the Kirby games too much, so making up an idea for Meta Knight wouldn't be easy, especially if the Halberd is to be included. And I'm glad you noticed the reference!"

Unless I do Donkey Kong but that would be weird. I might pay like $30 to get Little Mac so I can make this. Once again looks great! Keep up the great work!

amiibo,3e2hd0,anijunkie,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:21:57 2015 UTC,"I would love to watch a stream like this!  A piece of advice would be to do amiibo tournaments to mix things up a little and maybe do little bets with the viewers and stuff, too. Can't wait for you to begin! :D"
amiibo,3e2hd0,NinjaBrandon11,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:41:25 2015 UTC,"the biggest problems for tournaments would be that they would take an incredibly long time to complete, esp as the roster continues to grow. don't get me wrong, I will definitely do tournaments with my amiibos. I already started a while ago and recorded their results and their current standings can be seen here  I'm thinking of kicking off the stream with training a brand new amiibo and seeing how they do in a tournament with everyone else actually."
amiibo,3e2hd0,NinjaBrandon11,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:49:17 2015 UTC,"Instead of using all of your amiibo for your tournament, just use a randomized pick to determine which amiibo get to go to the tournament and what amiibo faces off against a specifically picked amiibo. You could do this weekly and train/play any other games/face off against viewers/go on for glory and do silly things like Olamar with no pikmin. That all depends on how much you plan on streaming, too. If you streamed daily, you would need a few filler things such as what I've listed above. And when you plan on doing an amiibo tournament, make it that day's thing and maybe some short matches, too. Depending on how long you will be streaming for, you could do a 8 amiibo bracket, 16 amiibo bracket, double or single elimination is also another thing to consider."
amiibo,3e2hd0,NinjaBrandon11,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:56:48 2015 UTC,"a 16 amiibo double elim 3 stock BO3 with a BO5 for semis and finals usually takes an entire day. With a growing collection, I'm probably going to use this format and the amiibos will be chosen randomly at first, then if the audience is large enough, put up a strawpoll or something a couple of days prior for viewers to vote."
amiibo,3e2hd0,ZeekLTK,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:04:32 2015 UTC,"Also, whatever amiibo wins the first tournament, could be like ""King amiibo"" or whatever you may wanna call it. This means that this amiibo will face off against the last standing amiibo in your next tournament. The other amiibo have to fight each other to get tha best of them and then try to take down the ruler of them all! Hope you are successful when you begin and I wish you the best of luck as well! :D"
amiibo,3e2hd0,AnthranDawn,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:09:10 2015 UTC,"With tournaments, you could always run them ""offline"" and then only broadcast the good/exciting games (via the Replay feature). No one needs to see Sheik 3-stock Charizard in round 1 or a Mario vs Luigi fight that goes to ""time"" because they just spam fireballs at each other, but they would be interested to see the semifinals or a big upset or whatever.  This would take some extra effort on the broadcaster's part, but it would essentially ensure that only interesting stuff is broadcast. And if you were planning on commenting during the broadcast, it would be easier to talk about the matchups when you already know what is going to happen / who is going to win (just don't spoil it for the audience)."
amiibo,3e2hd0,Evrythngivknwn,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:25:11 2015 UTC,Maybe you could list the amiibos you have and plan on using and create some sort of bracket? Maybe have people vote on specific amiibos that they would like to see fight each-other and determine the match-ups that way?
amiibo,3e2hd0,grathungar,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:46:50 2015 UTC,"I always have a new theme for my tournaments each season I do. My first one was point based, where each tournament had a theme like ""items, omegas, team fights, free for alls"" something like that and each match win gave the winner +3 points, each loss gave them -2 points and every tournament top 3 got a bonus in points.  I did that for two seasons. When I got to season 3 I really wanted to change the format, so I had the idea of adding all the elements to each tournament and the contestants were picked at random. So each tournament had team/ffas/omegas/items etc. That season they scored points in their placement matches to place them in their corresponding rank. Then they were pitted against their closest rivals placed above or below them to either rise or fall in the rankings. There was also opportunity for amiibos to get randomly selected to run a gauntlet, allowing them to climb the ranks until they lose. That season went to whoever was still sitting at the top when all the tournaments ended.  My most recent season I split my amiibos into groups, every group was a variety of matches and each amiibo had a specific number of matches they had to compete in. At the end of the group the amiibo with the lowest points was eliminated permanently from the competition. At the end of the season only 1 was left standing, and they were the champion.  You just gotta switch it up and be creative, imo no one wants to watch amiibos just fight it out on omegas in 1v1s over and over, that can get monotonous and boring. (I've tried to watch tournaments on youtube. lol)"
amiibo,3e2hd0,badwolf422,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:20:44 2015 UTC,"http://challonge.com/ Is good for creating brackets.   I had a tournament a while back where I let reddit train the amiibo. They gave me all of the training info I used for the tournament and informed me on how to feed the buggers.   I had fun but it became too much to handle. I wanted to do another tournament but I never really was able to do it. I was developing little personas for each one that did well and parodying the WWE. (Villager was the undertaker, Mario was HHH things like that.   I think it could have been popular but I just didn't have the time to dedicate to it to make videos on the regular."

amiibo,3e2hd0,Aced_It_Helps_Out,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:02:50 2015 UTC,"Do some testing and find out how your amiibos stack up against each other, then do a series where you try to train one of the worst amiibos to try to teach it how to be able to beat the best ones.  For example, (and I'm just picking two random amiibos for the example) let's say your Diddy Kong amiibo is the best one and Sonic is one of your worst. Have them fight each other at the beginning of the series and let everyone see how bad Diddy beats Sonic. Then spend time training Sonic to specifically fight Diddy Kong. Do a handful of trainings and then pit them against each other again, repeating this until eventually Sonic is able to compete/beat him... or until it is determined that Diddy is just too good and Sonic will never win.  And then if this ends up being fun/interesting, you can just pick another one of the ""worst"" amiibos and do the same thing with them (they wouldn't necessarily have to fight Diddy every time, but it should be clear who the top ones are to have them gun for). Eventually this will help them all ""git gud"" and make the competition even better."

If someone hadn't taken a chance with me (we were both first time traders), I wouldn't have made the trades I have so far.   The real thing, in my opinion, is to do your due diligence  first. Do they have time stamped pics? Do they type normally? Is their reddit account of a decent age with an active posting history? That all isn't fool proof but it goes a long way."

Now, they have so far cancelled 2 orders on me (back when Greninja was up for pre-order) with absolutely no explanation, and their customer service had no idea what happened.  Then, they just deleted my whole account. Again, customer service didn't know what happened and couldn't explain anything. That account had 3 amiibo on pre-order, which of course were then lost to the account disappearing.  Further, trying to link PayPal to them is a pain in the ass, and usually doesn't work (at least for me).  Basically, I guess they are okay for UK customers, but I'll wait for Amazon."

I think the biggest thing I have against them which probably isn't their fault, the time it takes to get them, I'm impatient and that's on me. However they do come each in there own box always in perfect condition and require a signature, so no stolen amiibo.

amiibo,3e248b,youmadSin,3,Tue Jul 21 11:05:20 2015 UTC,A lot of people fall into a bit both category.  I want to see what they choose during a difficult would you rather/either or.  I myself particularly hate the hunt but I can't deny that it was an amazing way to find other nintendo fans and connect as a community...  Still don't endorse this BS so I'm more of a destination person when it comes to amiibos
amiibo,3e248b,Psychic_Espurr,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:08:21 2015 UTC,"I love hunting, but it's much more satisfying to just sit back and display my collection. 90% of the time I go hunting, it's just to see what I can find, and not for any given Amiibo. I've gone legit hunting once, for defects."

amiibo,3e248b,SideshowRahim12,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:52:01 2015 UTC,"For me, it's the destination. A place which I will love, care for, and regularly dust."
amiibo,3e248b,sonicbrawler182,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:01:45 2015 UTC,"The destination, if only because the hunt is not all that exciting for me.  It was great finding so many hard to find Amiibos when I first started out, but for the most part, I'm just going in, placing my order in Argos/handing my chosen Amiibos to the person at the cash register, or ordering them online, or doing trades.  Rarely do I get a nerdy conversation with the store employees, and I've never met fellow hunters. In fact, last week was the first time I had outright heard of other hunters in my area, and even then, they were ""people who are just collecting them to keep in the box, and they don't even have a Wii U"", so they likely don't care much about Nintendo games.  Co-operating with my friend in New York and doing a trade on amiiboSwap have been nice experiences, but even with my friend, he's often peeved at how hard they are to find at times, and so am I, especially since some figures don't make it to Ireland until very late.  At the end of the day, a real life collection of Smash Bros trophies has been a dream of mine since I was younger. And I can make it a reality, so that's what I am shooting for. I'm nearly finished (nothing more to buy until September, and after that it's just DLC characters), so I doubt I will have any super cool experiences between now and then. I haven't made any close friends or anything through this, and I haven't had any real rush through a store or anything. I head down no earlier than 12pm when looking for new releases, and they generally aren't even unpacked at that stage, so I just walk in and get handed the figures and give them the money, and go home. No rush, it's actually quite a relaxing time. Money has been the only stressful aspect for me, and now that's gone since I am up to date."

amiibo,3e1v39,Niche16,5,Tue Jul 21 08:53:49 2015 UTC,"EB has just over half in stock, and I've found in-store Target has way better stock.  The reason the stock is so good though is because they have to be shared between 20 million people, not 400 million. Other countries are still getting way more stock than us, we're just better at keeping them on shelves.  I will agree though that the situation right now is pretty good. While we still have rares (Peach and Sheik), we do have a lot more than we used to. Back in the old days, if you didn't want Pikachu, you weren't gonna get amiibo. I will pat Nintendo AU on the back for getting us what we need."

amiibo,3e1bfm,RelevantDelibird,5,Tue Jul 21 16:11:42 2015 UTC,"But people who preordered camp out anyway because they're greedy little mooks hoping to get a trade or make their money back from either their preorder or their import. That being said, though you have some very good points and the only thing that could drive people away would be Toys R Us restocks, but people will probably force their parents or partners to camp there while they wait at Best Buy.

amiibo,3e1bfm,iLLNiSS,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:25:27 2015 UTC,"True, but when a medium traffic store gets 80-100, that outweighs 20-30 with no preorders. My store actually lasted a day and a half."

amiibo,3e3l8a,aknight99,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:16:07 2015 UTC,I think a huge percent of people on /r/amiibo have used it. It's completely safe no problem at all. Some people are put off by the fact that you need to send them I.D. but it's Japanese Law to do so. Under the FAQ on their site it explains why. Tenso is fantastic but it's a little expensive only getting 1 amiibo. If you get 3 or 4 in one shipment they average out to around $18 dollars apiece.

amiibo,3e217u,Joshyjosh1990,5,Tue Jul 21 10:18:01 2015 UTC,Flickering only happens during the restocks or after the item is sold out. Usually caused by Warehouses scanning inventory as they are received. New releases are released all at once. Also since they have all the supply I'm hoping it will give everyone at least 5 minutes or more to buy it without issues.
amiibo,3e217u,Oceandove45,2,Tue Jul 21 11:50:35 2015 UTC,5 minutes   I really do hope it's longer than that.
amiibo,3e217u,cloudsdale,2,Tue Jul 21 14:59:03 2015 UTC,"5 Minutes for the entire stock of North American Palutena would be a colossal fail on both Amazon and Nintendo's part because there's absolutely no way that they could run through that many of them without terrible stock numbers and people buying with bots.    Call me crazy, but I expect it to last for an hour or more."
amiibo,3e217u,DrBrian,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:50:43 2015 UTC,I believe Amazon said with the amount they had it should be about a 5-10 minute range to get one.
amiibo,3e217u,jman0125,2,Tue Jul 21 16:11:38 2015 UTC,Tomorrow there will be an email spelling out exactly how she will be distributed but it won't be a flickering situation on Friday. She will be available at one predetermined time and we will know when that is well enough in advance to arrange to at least make a bathroom run with our phones and Amazon apps for those of us who work that day ;)  No worries!
amiibo,3e217u,XZero319,2,Tue Jul 21 10:21:40 2015 UTC,The world will shut down for those 30 seconds!
amiibo,3e217u,pdwinslow,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:23:37 2015 UTC,"Yes, I think that because of their increased stock, Amazon will be able to handle Palutena well. If you're there on time, I doubt there will be flickering. However, maybe afterward there might be?"
amiibo,3e217u,jathzia,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:20:39 2015 UTC,"Flickering is only the case for restock. For new release, Amazon will put all of their stock at once. If they are sold out, they will stay sold out until the next official restock, which will be the time for flickering."
amiibo,3e217u,aidanvu1992,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:58:50 2015 UTC,"Amazon is able to handle incredibly huge amounts of customer with limited stocks...look at their Black Friday sales as an example.  Amazon has 100% of the stock of Palutena so it is highly unlikely that there will be any major issues.    That said, don't expect to have her available for weeks after the release day either."

amiibo,3e217u,mast3r_sword,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:04:22 2015 UTC,"Dark Pit is still the 31st. Amazon Josh informed us that Palutena is the 24th. My guess is the 27th is Nintendo's street date, which would be the day that Prime users get their orders from the 24th."
amiibo,3e217u,Drclaw411,-1,Tue Jul 21 15:16:59 2015 UTC,"Regardless of how they handle the order window(s), customers will more likely be screwed over by neglected packaging than anything else."
amiibo,3e217u,voideddarkness,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:51:45 2015 UTC,"So far with Amazon, I had one poorly packaged product--all but Toad of the Super Mario line was bent on the top. If you only order one amiibo, they haven't given me any issues. It's not nearly as good as European Amazons, but I haven't gotten damaged product.   One thing about Amazon though is certain sellers who ship through Amazon (Amazon Warehouse Deals comes to mind) have the figure shrink-wrapped to a large piece of cardboard which 2/3 of the time will crush the blister pack on the outside, at least in corners."
amiibo,3e217u,XZero319,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:23:27 2015 UTC,"And like I've mentioned in a lot of posts that whine about packaging...it's not the retailers fault all the time.  A package could be received in bent from Nintendo.  If the package isn't severely damaged and the product inside is OK then it will be deemed OK for sale. It's also very likely that UPS/FEDEX/USPS could have damaged the package in transit.  These companies handle millions of packages a day and I know from experience working at a FedEx Ground facility that things happen that are out of the employees control, the corner of a box can get stuck to a conveyor, a loose piece of tape can get caught, a very large box can get stuck causing a backup.    I understand that going to a store isn't an option for Palutena and that's aggravating for NiB collectors, but if it really is THAT much of a concern, then buy one second hand from a seller that has guaranteed the package is perfect."
amiibo,3e217u,Porkpants81,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:39:48 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'll just leave this here for you to look at and understand where I'm coming from. If that isn't severely damaged then I don't know what is."
amiibo,3e217u,voideddarkness,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:53:51 2015 UTC,"Looks like a combination of Amazon and whatever delivery service they used.  But honestly, Amazon doesn't sell these as collectibles, they are sold as toys and the same level of packaging that would go into something labeled a collectible doesn't apply to a toy.   If you don't like how Amazon ships, then don't order from them and then write a letter (yes a physical letter, not an e-mail) to their customer service dept. and tell them that you no longer are doing business with them until they improve their packaging standards.  Also going on Twitter and sending a direct message to their customer service will get their attention.    They are a huge corporation and the only way to make a company like that listen is through your wallet."
amiibo,3e217u,Porkpants81,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:11:40 2015 UTC,"Amazon highly values their customers. Regardless of if this is a collectible or not, any shipment should not be packaged in a box as small as that was. Don't send them a physical letter. Email them and call them. This is a tech company. A letter is going to take forever until someone responds, if they respond. Looking at that box and packaging, the Amazon distribution center messed up the most here."
amiibo,3e217u,PokemonMasterMax,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:03:26 2015 UTC,"Physical letters carry a lot more weight.  E-mails can get filtered and will either generate an automatic response (""Thank you for your message, we will look into this issue and hopefully you won't have problems in the future.  Thanks for being an Amazon customer""), and have a high likelihood of never even being seen by a person, or at least will never been seen by a person that can do anything about the problem.  It's not about getting an immediate response, it's about getting their business process changed for the better.  If you want an individual immediate response then the best thing to do is call them and complain to get a refund or a a voucher for money off another order.  The Amazon warehouse certainly shouldn't have put the amiibo in a box that wasn't the correct size, but the warehouse probably had nothing to do with the external damage where the corner got crushed."

amiibo,3e1vnv,jthedub,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:14:19 2015 UTC,Never. Remember wave 4?
amiibo,3e1vnv,ianolivia,0,Tue Jul 21 15:22:12 2015 UTC,"You mean Amazon US? Because so far, they have Palutena and the likely hood of any pre orders for any of the rest of wave 5 is slim to none at this point. We will know when the day comes."
amiibo,3e1vnv,Zantos8741,0,Tue Jul 21 09:28:05 2015 UTC,The only wave 5 coming out soon are Dark Pit (Best Buy) and Paulitina (Amazon) and there will be no pre orders. Assuming you are talking about US releases.

amiibo,3dz6ar,Radiodisease1900,6,Mon Jul 20 23:25:34 2015 UTC,Best numbers on release day for a single amiibo we've gotten in ages. Hopefully he gets restocked quickly
amiibo,3dz6ar,DrCoolWhip,20,Mon Jul 20 18:45:52 2015 UTC,You must not remember Greninja.
amiibo,3dz6ar,The_Beebat,4,Mon Jul 20 18:51:07 2015 UTC,His average wasn't that high. There were a lot of stores that didn't get that many. Only major areas got a decent amount
amiibo,3dz6ar,DrCoolWhip,7,Mon Jul 20 18:53:19 2015 UTC,"Not to counter your argument but multiple Toys R Us got more than 50 Greninjas. Mine got freaking 80 of them, it still sold out on the first day."
amiibo,3dz6ar,Senor_J,3,Mon Jul 20 19:02:48 2015 UTC,"My store claims to have gotten 186 Greninjas on launch day, and sold all but 30-ish that day. They had that many at open the enxt day and were out by lunchtime. Still, I hope there's a good number of DP to go around. I might consider picking up a Pit if they have any by the time I get through the line. I need trades for Marth and Robin."
amiibo,3dz6ar,Toky18,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:15:44 2015 UTC,one close to me got 48 according to the guy I talked to the other day. I wasn't collecting then so I missed out.
amiibo,3dz6ar,JustcallmeNi,2,Mon Jul 20 20:13:05 2015 UTC,My TRU had 120 Greninjas on launch and I wouldn't say I'm in a major area. Prob a mid type of area. Hopefully that means the Best Buy in that same area gets stocked well.
amiibo,3dz6ar,Eye_Of_Greyluck,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:58:44 2015 UTC,So funny. I live in an a major area and our ToysRus had none. Not even a single shipment. It sucked.
amiibo,3dz6ar,JustAGuyGaming21,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:30:46 2015 UTC,"My store is decently popular, and we got well over 100. They didn't sell out for a few days apparently."
amiibo,3dz6ar,wilandhugs,2,Mon Jul 20 20:51:19 2015 UTC,The TRU nearest me didn't get many at all. He was sold out before the people waiting in line all got one.
amiibo,3dz6ar,Porkpants81,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:00:52 2015 UTC,Sorta the same for the one I went to except that they got like 40+ but still ran out since the line was so long so the people at the end weren't  able to get them
amiibo,3dz6ar,Helllo_laryssa,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:52:43 2015 UTC,My Toysrus got over 100 Greninja... nice try Dark Pit.

amiibo,3dz6ar,Toky18,6,Mon Jul 20 19:16:58 2015 UTC,"Guys, the less we hype its rarity, the easier it will be to get. Just like all the returned rosas and jiggs, if the already disheartened resellers dont see mad hype on here, they wont bother. But do what you want, my DP and palutena (and ganon and a fox) just arrived at customs yesterday, so I'll just sit back and watch the world burn."

amiibo,3dz6ar,powercorruption,3,Mon Jul 20 18:51:07 2015 UTC,It's a good number that's for sure but that stock will definitely disappear quickly since it is in-store only.
amiibo,3dz6ar,LarryXMario,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:55:07 2015 UTC,"Hm, I wonder how rare he'll be?? I personally think Pit will always be rarer then him because Dark Pit is pretty much useless. Like really Nintendo, just add a black color to Pit then you're good."

amiibo,3dz6ar,MeowsticAmiibo,2,Mon Jul 20 18:44:53 2015 UTC,I knew 100 was too good to be true and even 25-30 means 10-15 because of employees taking for themselves.
amiibo,3dz6ar,DjjD89,7,Mon Jul 20 18:48:50 2015 UTC,I doubt there is 15-20 people at each Best Buy that will buy them to either collect or flip.
amiibo,3dz6ar,ChiefsFan435,-6,Mon Jul 20 18:49:49 2015 UTC,No i meant that out of the 25-30 per store hes saying we will only see 10-15 dark pits because the other ones will be taken by employees
amiibo,3dz6ar,DjjD89,10,Mon Jul 20 18:52:01 2015 UTC,"Umm, he understood what you were saying. He's saying there might not be that many employees interested in taking those Dark Pits."
amiibo,3dz6ar,jerm2z,3,Mon Jul 20 18:59:40 2015 UTC,there NO way that at every store there will be like more hen maybe 1 person that takes one for himself and I don't see to much of the probem as long as there is more for other people.
amiibo,3dz6ar,beastman1655,2,Mon Jul 20 18:57:20 2015 UTC,They could lose their job over that. I doubt that many people are stupid enough to risk that.
amiibo,3dz6ar,EICzerofour,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:43:56 2015 UTC,Does this mean all Best Buys or some Best Buys?
amiibo,3dz6ar,SoulHariko,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:56:34 2015 UTC,The metropolitan area stores like the ones in NYC are sure to get 100+. TRU was said to get 20 Greninja per store and the Times Sq TRU ended up getting like 120+. Probably a similar case with Best Buy.
amiibo,3dz6ar,jerm2z,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:57:55 2015 UTC,Times Square got 400.
amiibo,3dz6ar,orfwivherhead,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:28:48 2015 UTC,"Westbury TRU got like 200 Greninja, and Westbury Target got like 120 Jiggs. They also got 80 Rosalinas prior."
amiibo,3dz6ar,wilandhugs,2,Mon Jul 20 20:53:03 2015 UTC,Oh well looks like I'm going there to wait...
amiibo,3dz6ar,Porkpants81,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:01:34 2015 UTC,"That's awesome numbers, I just hope I'm not in the area that gets very low stock of Dark Pit."

amiibo,3dz6ar,JorJor91,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:14:04 2015 UTC,This is a better number than that 8 I saw earlier.
amiibo,3dz6ar,Juanblue85,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:29:18 2015 UTC,So now all stores will Get 30. and not 100+ ????
amiibo,3dz6ar,RabbitJP,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:07:39 2015 UTC,"At least its better numbers than meta knight initial stock! 25-30 seems pretty good imo for a launch exclusive. In reality the only good exclusives that had good initial release date stocks were Rosalina,Jigglypuff,Greninja in my area. Shulk was like finding a needle in gaur plain. Lucario was like finding a shiny pokemon. Meta knight was like finding a bat in a large cave. Ness was pretty bad too. Still Hopefully I'll be able to snag a dark pit and hopefully everyone else will be too :) Dark pit was the amiibo me and my little bro been looking forward too the most since amiibos were revealed. Good luck on the 31st! Oh and on Friday for Palutena!"
amiibo,3dz6ar,SaiyanPrince35,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:18:20 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the heads up! Based on previous numbers I've seen of people waiting in line here, pretty much everyone should be walking away happy in my neck of the woods.  I'll keep my fingers crossed that I can grab Pit (in that he may or may not show up at my Best Buy)... but it's all good in the end."
amiibo,3dz6ar,spd12,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:37:21 2015 UTC,"thank God for being in NYC for the summer because I remember standing in line for Rosie in Denver (I go to school in Colorado) and they had only a meager 6, 1 Sheik, 2 Toon links and 4 bowsers."
amiibo,3dz6ar,So12rovv,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:02:05 2015 UTC,"Well, at least they're off to a better start than they were with MK. Though, that really isn't saying much as Mk probably had the worst launch out of any store exclusive Amiibo. I guess we'll just see how it goes."
amiibo,3dz6ar,Strickerx5,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:03:10 2015 UTC,"I work for BB and all of the stores in my area(Sacramento , CA) have requested ~20-25. Nothing is in transit yet so that could change, but with those numbers my DC would have enough to supply about 360 stores."

amiibo,3dz6ar,furydeath,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:36:23 2015 UTC,"Would this be an average that applies primarily to American Best Buy's, or would the numbers be similar for the Canadian Best Buy locations as well?"
amiibo,3dz6ar,c_king_007,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:44:08 2015 UTC,"Not really as prevalent as Jigglypuff. He was available both online AND in-store, which helped cut down how many people would be camping outside the store. Dark Pit is only going to be available in-store. Hopefully the stock numbers will increase."

amiibo,3dz6ar,RayToday138,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:22:12 2015 UTC,Do you guys think that they'll put the Dark Pits at the amiibo section or at a counter somewhere? Which happened during Meta Knight?
amiibo,3dz6ar,Fluggerson,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:44:56 2015 UTC,Meta Knight was at this service counter area.. they walked everyone over to it.. will probably be the same thing.  They handed out tickets too at my BB

amiibo,3dz6ar,Helllo_laryssa,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:37:25 2015 UTC,"So I'm assuming this 30 per store isn't necessarily true for Ohio and Michigan? Cause it said a minimum of 8 per store (which makes it seem like we won't get many) or does that just mean we won't have a store with only 1-2?  I don't know, I'm just trying to figure out why Ohio would be on the short end of the stick like I've been reading lately."

amiibo,3dz6ar,antidakoda,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:42:47 2015 UTC,I would rather spend twice the money and have it go to anyone else other than best buy. I love best buy a lot but this no preorder shit is ridic. So glad I went OOB recently. Importing is amazing.
amiibo,3dz6ar,SaiyanOfDarkness,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:28:38 2015 UTC,Where do you like to get your imports from?  Heard shipping costs can be a bitch though..
amiibo,3dz6ar,SaiyanOfDarkness,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:49:54 2015 UTC,So far just Amazon. Paying a few extra bucks per figure to save me time and hassle is worth it IMO. I ain't got time fo campin.
amiibo,3dz6ar,obiwan341,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:03:06 2015 UTC,"Well I think the only benefit of camping, is if you are there early enough.. u can get first dibs.. and pick out the best ""looking"" one.."
