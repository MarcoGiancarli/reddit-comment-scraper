I became obsessed so fast and derby has been probably the biggest life changer for me outside of meeting my husband. I remember being so sore for a full week after learning to fall safely, icing my knees, I remember adoring the trainers who were so positive and yes, intimidating with their skills. I'm captain of a team this year and I still can't quite believe that I am where I am. Keep at it, wonderful things are ahead of you :)"

rollerderby,3e3k5g,danooli,2,Tue Jul 21 19:16:49 2015 UTC,"Our fresh meat are sort of required to NSO. It helps us learn the game and all the work it takes to make a game happen. We also have a player who officiated regularly, and she loves it. I think it can really broaden your understanding of the game, and make you a better player."

Unlike most male skater-refs I started as a skater. Skating is my main priority though and whenever training etc picks up refereeing takes a back seat so I'll never be a great ref.  I started out doing a bit of refereeing on the side to get a better understanding of the game but got more into it and have now reffed 14 public games.  Edit: I'm in a co-ed league, which I suppose gives me more chances to officiate.  A female skater I know both plays at world cup level and refs at a high standard too so she's a total inspiration."

rollerderby,3e3k5g,poiro,2,Wed Jul 22 01:31:55 2015 UTC,I'm head ref for the women's team in my city and currently lfounder/current chair person of the men's team. It's a lot of hard work at times but its been very rewarding throughout.   Also one role tends to help the other in that my ref training and knowledge certainly helps when it comes to skating in a bout
rollerderby,3e3k5g,poiro,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:07:53 2015 UTC,"Awesome! Glad to hear it's working for someone.   Not sure if you're certified as a ref, but do you think you'd be able to become certified while also skating, without having one compromise the other?"
rollerderby,3e3k5g,STGItsMe,2,Wed Jul 22 01:39:33 2015 UTC,"I'm aiming for certification this year :)  While some track time gets dedicated to refereeing, that's not actually track time that I could be skating in so I always consider my time with the women's team as bonus skating and any opportunity to learn the sport better can only be a good thing IMHO.  Also any studying I do tends to be in my own time anyway."

It gives me a chance to still be able to work with the league while I'm not skating, and when I am skating what will mostly be interleague bouts I'll have a lot of opportunity to maintain volunteer credit while I'm at it with the home team bouts I can't play in."

I kept NSOing though and I think it's really rad. I've been able to do a few regulation games and big tournaments, which is exciting.     These days I'm training to be a ref while still NSOing bouts. I still train/skate with various levels within my league, so if I want to return to playing, the option is there :)"

So this year April rolls around she blows out an MCL in practice and you can only defer your passes one year, and no refunds so... money flushed down the toilet.  It would have been nice if Rollercon would have at least let us gift our passes to someone else.  I'd have gladly given my passes and hotel reservations to someone else if it meant they got to go.

rollerderby,3dmsqc,Stuff9910,6,Fri Jul 17 15:22:43 2015 UTC,"Are you in my league? ?? Seriously, I attempted to serve on our BOD this year, and immediately noticed all these rules made by the previous BOD but never enforced. We started holding people to attendance and committee requirements, and our head coach threw the BOD under the bus telling everyone that BOD was the ones stopping people from skating. I had skaters asking me why I was so mean and what my problem was that I was trying to stop them from skating. All I'm doing is tracking and reporting your attendance! Preferential treatment is when you ignore requirements to let your friends skate, which is what our coaches and BOD used to do. The bullying got so bad I resigned."
rollerderby,3dmsqc,biglebowski55,5,Fri Jul 17 18:13:23 2015 UTC,"This annoys me so much. The coach throwing you under the buss and claiming that the BOD was the one stopping people from skating. No... It isn't the BOD stopping you. It's yourself. You aren't keeping up attendance or your other duties. Sure, things come up but it's up to you to live up to your duties."
rollerderby,3dmsqc,RefBeaver,2,Fri Jul 17 18:31:25 2015 UTC,There needs to be procedures in place to make exceptions. Like submitting an appeal.
rollerderby,3dmsqc,biglebowski55,2,Fri Jul 17 18:15:56 2015 UTC,Exactly. Transparency.
rollerderby,3dmsqc,RefBeaver,2,Fri Jul 17 18:18:19 2015 UTC,Yes! I realize things come up but when you don't make mention of it it makes it look like something shady is going on.
rollerderby,3dmsqc,RefBeaver,3,Fri Jul 17 18:28:33 2015 UTC,"I would at the very least take a look at the attendance and see how it is calculated or ask for an explanation. If rules aren't going to be enforced then they have to be not enforced across the board otherwise you will create disgruntled players. Obviously there is some grumbling going on as you wouldn't have noticed it. Just double and triple check your math. Could it be that there are some personal days or things like that being taken into account?  In the league I work with, myself and another ref have worked on creating a google spreadsheet that everyone sees which does all the calculations and shows which skaters attended which practices and also when personal days etc... were used. We have a rolling 90 day attendance so sometimes the numbers get a bit funky when calculating by hand but the sheet does all the calculations for us.  I would inquire at the very least about the calculation with the board. There's a reason you have a board and if it's not doing it's job then there's going to be issues."
rollerderby,3dmsqc,RefBeaver,3,Fri Jul 17 17:10:32 2015 UTC,We do have a board just like that and I check it regularly. There are no exceptions for personal days. Only injuries. I rechecked today for the old bout and it seemed like attendance was altered. I am going to attempt to view previous versions as well as consult with some trusted skaters about this. If I find something I am not quite sure how to present it to bod without sounding accusatory. What is a good approach?
rollerderby,3dmsqc,Missmuffit,3,Fri Jul 17 17:38:44 2015 UTC,"The best approach is to go in with all of your facts. Make sure you've got documentation on the issue and that the documentation is sound.  You also don't want to go in just pointing fingers because no matter how much documentation you have it will look accusatory. You basically just want to bring up that you think there is an issue with either the calculations or changes after the fact.  I'd say treat it like an official review. State your grievance in a calm professional manner and what you'd like to see come out of this. In your case, your grievance is that you have some iffy calculations or changes after the fact and you'd like to see the attendance policy followed correctly across the board."

rollerderby,3dmsqc,biglebowski55,2,Fri Jul 17 18:28:14 2015 UTC,My league recently got rid of a league attendance. It is up to teams to decide what they want to do in that regard and take care of the tracking etc.  The BOD then doesn't have to worry about inforcing anything it's up to coaches and captains to take care of.  Also we have an A/B/C team structure so each team can have different requirements.

Every skater on the track will learn something about herself in that game, not just the new ones.   Others have said it, but it bears repeating: Keep your head up, always be looking to contribute, don't get distracted, always be with a partner.  Most importantly, relax. You've been trained for this. Trust your skates, trust your teammates and trust your coach."

We are so enthusiastic, but never get a chance to train outside of the dedicated practice time. Even if part of that training means that you are observing (perhaps with a vet explaining what is being taught) its valuable. You may also get revenue from other leagues that way."
rollerderby,3dhb42,toragirl,2,Thu Jul 16 18:36:21 2015 UTC,"My league did a one day event for the first time last year and is repeating it this year. Contact neighbouring leagues and see if any experienced skaters are willing to do a one or two hour skill session, and have a few of your top skaters and coaches do the same. Invite skaters from those leagues to participate. Have each instructor focus on a specific skill, like following through on hits, or offensive blocking. Make an agenda. Make sure there aren't a lot of repeated skills. Schedule in breaks. We also managed to get a yoga instructor to start the day with a quick session. We had donated snacks. Use those networking skills. If though can end the day with a party, all the better."
rollerderby,3dhb42,biglebowski55,2,Thu Jul 16 22:51:02 2015 UTC,My only suggestion would be to contact recruiting at other leagues and ask them how that works.   Our bootcamp is usually 6 practices.  The first an intro to derby and some skating to assess skills. After that we run through going over basic skills each practice.   Just make sure you have dedicated vets attending practice who will learn people's names and encourage them from beginning to end.
rollerderby,3dhb42,jaxxly,3,Thu Jul 16 11:18:57 2015 UTC,Oh! Sorry I wasn't more clear. I meant like a weekend or a one-day bootcamp that focuses on specific skills for skaters at an intermediate level. I'll edit my post! (Thank you!)
rollerderby,3dhb42,jaxxly,2,Thu Jul 16 18:09:04 2015 UTC,"I would suggest attending a boot camp and modeling a program off of that.   You may also be able to plan as you go. So have everyone scrimmage the first day, fill out a questionnaire, and then build your activity for the next day based on what people need to work on.   I would also suggest doing strengthening and conditioning exercises as well. A lot of people don't cross train when they really should be."

Oly didn't play enough WFTDA-sanctioned games this year to qualify; even if they did, Oly has said in the past that they won't go into WFTDA playoffs if that means leaving their under-18 skaters off their main roster. Oly is going back to USARS Nationals again, however… Minnesota will be in Los Angeles this weekend to play the L.A. Derby Dolls on the banked track.

Note that there are more international (outside North America) teams in the playoffs this year than ever before, so any money saved domestically would probably be trumped by the money spent for the Euro/Aussie teams to get over here and back, at least once."

And here's what DNN said about Oly:   Oly fulfilled their requirements and were duly invited to [WFTDA] playoffs. However, they’re taking another year out of the playoff cycle. Why? “So all of our skaters can skate including the under age,” explained Oly’s Tannibal Lector, talking to DNN.   Oly could very easily leave their juniors at home and go play in the WFTDA playoffs.

rollerderby,3dcbii,WDRBY,2,Wed Jul 15 19:22:13 2015 UTC,"Just let me know the teams: League Name, team name, location. Please use the home team first and I'll look up their information. All the bouts information I get from Flat Track stats. It took about 3 hours to write this."

rollerderby,3dcbii,SiriusHertz,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:04:56 2015 UTC,Give me some info for this bout and I'll add it if you'd like.
rollerderby,3dcbii,TchaiKILLsky,2,Wed Jul 15 22:41:04 2015 UTC,RDCL! Minnesota are coming to play the LA Ri-Ettes at our new facility Saturday night after they have their sanctioned bout against ACDG earlier in the day. They've played us on the banked track before and it was rad. Edit: apparently I was implanted with a false memory and this is actually MN's first time on the bank. Even better?!

rollerderby,3dbjwl,mattybeast,2,Wed Jul 15 16:24:37 2015 UTC,"This is from a co-ed mixup scrimmage we held, it was pretty amazing because we had skaters come from 3-5 hours away. Everyone learned, and EVERYONE hated our floor. The venue is actually the hockey arena where SlapShot was filmed, when the ice is down for the summer they let us have games on the concrete underfloor. It's terrible for grip, but when someone gets hit they slide about 15 feet so the crowd gets really excited..."

rollerderby,3dbjwl,drlb53,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:28:42 2015 UTC,Really? Almost every bout I've played has been in an arena. Also upvotes for Slap Shot :)
rollerderby,3dbjwl,drlb53,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:46:06 2015 UTC,It's an incredibly hard concrete and weirdly powdery. With invisible slick spots- primarily in the middle of turn 3.  And divots. And spots where oil has dripped down from the machinery in the ceiling.
