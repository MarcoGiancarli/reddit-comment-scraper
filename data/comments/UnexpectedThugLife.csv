UnexpectedThugLife,3e1hij,spidersnake,56,Tue Jul 21 07:31:52 2015 UTC,He's a comedian.
UnexpectedThugLife,3e1hij,Renal_Toothpaste,24,Tue Jul 21 07:49:47 2015 UTC,I hope he's louder at his shows then.
UnexpectedThugLife,3e1hij,spidersnake,47,Tue Jul 21 07:50:42 2015 UTC,He probably gets a mic at those.  I love how he is asking for security and they waited just long enough that the guy would have a chance to punch him if he wanted.
UnexpectedThugLife,3e1hij,DragoonDirk,4,Tue Jul 21 08:59:05 2015 UTC,"I'm sure he does, I was just being a bit facetious. I'm just wondering that if he made the effort to get in there with props, why he also didn't make the effort to shout."

UnexpectedThugLife,3e1hij,flippitus_floppitus,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:12:00 2015 UTC,Lee Nelson is one of Simon Brodkin's characters. The character in post is Jason Bent who at least gets up to some funny stunts... that's as far as Brodkin's comedic appeal goes though.
UnexpectedThugLife,3e1hij,tigranater,3,Tue Jul 21 15:34:27 2015 UTC,"Yeah he kinda sounds like a Muppet talking through a wet rag, still have no idea what he's saying"
UnexpectedThugLife,3e1hij,Evil-Imp,11,Tue Jul 21 12:20:15 2015 UTC,"He is playing one of his characters, ""Jason Bent"", who is a portrayal of a modern-day English footballer from Liverpool. The Liverpool accent makes it more difficult to understand, but he's basically saying how honoured he is to have been made representative for North Korea's 2026 World Cup bid, and is thanking Mr Blatter for choosing them as the host nation. As he's being taken away he says ""I promise you, it's all there Mr Blatter"", referring to the 'bribe money' he has just thrown."
UnexpectedThugLife,3e1hij,turnip_juice,2,Tue Jul 21 12:36:14 2015 UTC,There's quite a funny video of Jason Bent. He had to go to court for impersonating a Manchester City player and training with the squad. When he left the court he stayed in character and made a load of jokes about shagging John Terry's missus etc. I'm not a massive fan either but credit where it's due he can be funny.  There's a video on this Mail article but I can't find the YouTube link.

It was the same when he invaded the stage during Kanye's set at Glastonbury. No message other than ""hey, Kanye likes to invade stages. Let's see how he likes it. Also, people can look at me as I do it"". At least when Kanye does it, he has a message behind it.   All he's done is make a point that everyone in the whole world was already aware of. It comes off more to me as attention seeking than it does comedy, or even protest."

Yes, from a medical standpoint she is exactly right. But now, there is mounting evidence that PEDs, in both male and female athletes, have lasting effects once they're stopped and they never go away.   For example, Cris Cyborg will never physically be the Cris Cyborg that wasn't shaped by steroids.   And if Fallon Fox (rightfully) shouldn't fight because of her performance advantage……  Slippery slope."
UnexpectedThugLife,3dg1kn,Billy_Reuben,61,Thu Jul 16 00:39:42 2015 UTC,"Not really a slippery slope, you could ban PED users for life and that's where the slope would end."
UnexpectedThugLife,3dg1kn,vecnyj,13,Thu Jul 16 02:19:15 2015 UTC,"The slippery slope is how quickly and easily PED users can get around drug testers. They can only test for known substances.

It's like racing: Cheating and not getting caught is winning."
UnexpectedThugLife,3dg1kn,Billy_Reuben,26,Thu Jul 16 03:36:26 2015 UTC,"The advantage of going through puberty as a man is incomparable to PED usage. Skeletal growth cannot be achieved to this level in adults by use of any PED.  So let's just say all top athletes use PEDs of some form, the best they can hope for is to maybe reach a level where they can compete with a hypothetical trans athlete who is not using. Now say the trans athlete decides to hop on a little gear.."

UnexpectedThugLife,3dg1kn,Billy_Reuben,9,Thu Jul 16 04:04:14 2015 UTC,"That's not a slippery slope, it's just a testing problem.   Would some still use PEDs even if caught they faced a lifetime ban? Sure, but I doubt the top levels would because they'd be risking a lot more."

Whoever thinks Floyd can avoid a takedown better than someone with a blackbelt in judo (and she's thrown plenty of them), is crazy.

As a boxer, he would have zero take down defense, and a good take down shooter would make him their bitch in a real hurry.  Go check out Bas Rutens YouTube channel, he has the DVD clips of all his fights in Pancrase in Japan, where he commentates over the fight. One of the areas he is constantly talking about in the first half of his fights, and even in his later ones from time to time, is how easy he was taken down, no sprawl, no defense, just easy take downs for his opponent. So when he was in the ring with Ken or Frank Shamrock, they would just own him like a bitch with no take down defense. Likewise his grappling ability was pretty much nonexistent im the beginning as well, so he just kind sat there on the floor, and got fucked trying to hard to do things that would never work.  Everything you know about fighting on your feet, is completely irrelevant once your on the ground, especially for an experienced striker who's never had to grapple for amy reason before."

It extends over a dozen years and includes at least seven separate physical assaults on five different women that resulted in arrest or citation, as well as several other instances where the police had to be summoned in response to an actual or perceived threat from Mayweather.

I dont think people realize how ineffective a human being is who's never grappled. Its actually scary training for the first time and realizing how helpless you've been.  The funny thing is, theres more ways to get the fight to a clinch without Ronda putting up her guard and running headfirst for under hooks. She could actually roll towards him, shoot for an ankle, shit, even a butt scoot would be effective against a guy who dont know how to defend trips.   Its weird how a guy who has only one split second moment to survive is the guy people would put money on."

UnexpectedThugLife,3dg1kn,Quachyyy,10,Thu Jul 16 04:40:10 2015 UTC,"It's not that grappling beats non-grappling (or boxing as you're implying), it's that leg blows, take downs, and technical ability can all beat boxing.   If they fought tomorrow I'd definitely put my money on her. Sure Floyd is the greatest boxer, but that's it. That's only boxing. Put him in a cage and that little hug he likes to do will get turned into a takedown, then to an arm-bar. She's a woman and is lighter, but that doesn't mean she doesn't know her way to a takedown.   There's more ways to winning than just punching."
UnexpectedThugLife,3dg1kn,FusRoBlah,10,Thu Jul 16 02:32:17 2015 UTC,Yah I'm gonna have to disagree. You don't become a world champion boxer not being able to fight. If they were using ufc rules Mayweather would not get close to her and she wouldn't have a chance of getting close to him. There's a reason he's undefeated. Also it's difficult to when someone has such fast movement speed and a long reach. Not to mention that he throws heavy punches for his size.
UnexpectedThugLife,3dg1kn,teamSpahr,12,Thu Jul 16 04:17:18 2015 UTC,My guess is you've never grappled a day in your life.
UnexpectedThugLife,3dg1kn,FusRoBlah,5,Thu Jul 16 09:07:54 2015 UTC,I actually take Maui Tai so I do know a little something about what I'm talking about.
UnexpectedThugLife,3dg1kn,Quachyyy,4,Thu Jul 16 09:20:38 2015 UTC,"You become a world champion boxer by being able to box.   He's fast, and he's a great boxer, but he doesn't have as much experience as she does when it goes beyond that. I highly doubt he has the instinct to sprawl when getting shot or to roll through when being put to his back; he might know that you're supposed to sprawl when the opponent shoots, but does he have he experience to just automatically do it without hesitation when it comes to it.   It's very probable that a punch from him that fully connects may knock her out, but the odds of that happening are way lower than the odds of her taking a few punches and then going in for the takedown. Additionally, I'd put money on Rondas leg/knee sweeps/blows against Floyd's punches. Even if he does have more muscles, arms<legs. 15 pounds doesn't make up for that.   And it's not that difficult going against a faster opponent when it goes beyond boxing. I wrestled varsity in HS at 170 and my buddy was 135. If you can read hip movements, you can take down someone 5x faster than you (exaggeration). On the flip side, he was smaller but if he managed to get to my side, it only took an ankle pick to take me down. Ronda knows how to throw those. If Floyd knew wrestling/BJJ/judo then it'd be a no brainer, but he doesn't and those fields offer such a bigger arsenal than boxing   Edit: she could even just start low with a hand on the matt. That takes away pretty much Floyd's entire game since he can't hit her face when she's grounded, and we all know that if he tried wrestling her he'd lose. She could just circle step while being low and grounded and win."
UnexpectedThugLife,3dg1kn,tattlerat,18,Thu Jul 16 09:55:20 2015 UTC,"It's not impossible. She's an Olympic calibre Judo fighter with great knowledge of submissions. If she got him to the ground good chance she could snap his arm off, long as he didn't knock her head off before then."
UnexpectedThugLife,3dg1kn,ridgy_didge,9,Thu Jul 16 09:57:09 2015 UTC,I wouldn't put it past her. Yes floyd is great there is no denying it. But it's UFC. Boxing is one aspect and I doubt floyd could take kicks or the judo skills she possesses.   My money would be on her.   And we know it wouldn't be rigged because floyd has no troubles hitting females.
UnexpectedThugLife,3dg1kn,OBJesus,26,Thu Jul 16 09:57:08 2015 UTC,"I would give you 10000-1 odds in that bet. Floyd is bigger, much stronger, and much much faster. It wouldn't last last 30 seconds before Mayweather won. I'm seriously shocked people are debating this."
UnexpectedThugLife,3dg1kn,BulletTo_0th,14,Thu Jul 16 04:22:28 2015 UTC,"Because it's a hypothetical that we'll never know the answer to. MMA fans have seen what world-class judo and bjj fighters can do to a pure boxer. You say he's much, much stronger, but how strong is his takedown defense or how strong is he when he's on his back?  Ronda has taken down and submitted high-level male MMA fighters in training that are the same size as Floyd. Honestly, I'd take your 1000-1 odds in a heartbeat if this was a UFC-rules fight."

It'd be like Serena Williams playing a male player - her usual game of physical dominance goes out the window. Unless Rousey grapples him perfectly as soon as they started, he'd win.

Its like when serena and venus williams thought they could beat a rank 200 guy in tennis when they were both in the top 20, and he beat them both 6-1 and 6-2 and he said he didnt even try because he wanted to keep it interesting"

Sure she could beat some guys in the cage, but if you think she even has a 1% chance of beating the best boxer in the world you're insanely delusional"
UnexpectedThugLife,3dg1kn,Sheepoverlord,3,Thu Jul 16 05:45:21 2015 UTC,"The problem is that you think ""she wouldn't have the strength to bring him down"". Ground fighting has much less to do with brute strength, and much more to do with technique (which she has, and Mayweather presumably doesn't). It's actually much easier than you'd expect to put someone untrained on the ground, regardless of weight.   That's not to say that the fight would clearly go one way or the other; rather, that the fight would be decided within the first 30 seconds at most. If Mayweather manages to connect immediately, a few solid blows is all it would take - you're right, he has the strength advantage. But if Rousey gets inside his guard (and there are many ways to do so, some not available in boxing and therefore presumably not familiar to Mayweather), he'll be on the ground and she'd win it easily from there."

Play an online game for a years and sure enough it gets far worse around June-August because that's when the children are playing more, because of summer vacation.  Adults may make stupid posts from time to time, but turning the kids loose on the Internet every summer is not a fake idea, it's what happens, every year.  They really are terrible humans with undeveloped brains and they negatively impact shit online with their poorly conceived ideas.  I'm sure ever once in awhile you'll think ""Oh, this 14 year old isn't a complete retard, he's probably an OK person or something.""  But for the most part, kids and teenagers are terrible at doing things in any meaningful sophisticated way online.  They are mostly just uneducated racists that like to inflame things because it's funny to them.  It's very infrequent you get so many dumb Internet posts/gamers during 9 am to 3pm.  Why?

Our brain does a sort of mental subconcious checklist to determine if it's something worth noticing ""There's something in the corner of the video. Is it part of the video itself? No. Am I still able to watch the content I'm interested in? Yes. Conclusion: It's not important so just ignore its existance.""  Though I could be speaking total bollocks."
UnexpectedThugLife,3d5epu,Squebeb,1 point,Mon Jul 13 23:37:59 2015 UTC,Its very true.  Ads on websites have become more and more intrusive because it was determined that a large percentage of people intuitively don't see banner ads anymore. When you purposely ignore something for long enough your brain will filter it out of your consciousness.

When you get to a certain level of wealth, you go from ""how to I responsibly spend my money"" to ""how do I preserve my wealth and make my money work for me."" When your mindset is of the latter, you don't spend more money (ie - hire more people) unless you need to. 2 - Most jobs created due to higher demand. An employer isn't going to hire more people unless their current staff can't keep up with demand. Why would anyone hire more people than what's needed to deal with current demand? It's not efficient. So in order to create more demand, you have to put money in the pockets of people who need to spend that money.  That's my take when I try to think about it logically, anyway. But I'm not economist and I'm open to being corrected."

UnexpectedThugLife,3cz4o6,iAmRealCarlosDanger,1 point,Sun Jul 12 14:36:25 2015 UTC,"I don't know what system of taxation works better for economic growth, other than less taxes and regulations is best strictly on the economic growth basis.   I think the best point for having more wealth to the lower income group is that they will spend more, which is good for the economy.  I beleive that when someone has more money, they will put it into things like index and mutual funds, which is still good for the economy.  Having more available capital is good for businesses because they can spend more.  It is kind of a trade off, and I dont know if it is better to have money in the hands of the poor to spend, or the hands of the rich to invest.  For me, taxation is not really about what is best for the economy, but what is fair.  People believe that taxing the rich because they have all of the wealth, but the majority of the rich obtained their wealth through hardwork, risk, and prudent living.  I get frustrated by the rich hate that happens when if people actually knew what rich people were like, they wouldnt be so quick to want to take their money."
UnexpectedThugLife,3cz4o6,DietOysterCrackers,2,Wed Jul 15 18:40:44 2015 UTC,"So when we say rich, we don't mean people making 150 grand per year. In USA, top 2 percent have 40% of wealth. This creates an imbalance which is unsustainable. The worker wages have remained stagnant for over 2 decades, while the rich are getting richer as we speak. The political system is such that the rich are able to sway it their way by using money. 93 % of the times, a guy who has spent most money wins in a congressional election since citizen united. These are all not unrelated, there is a pattern. Most rich people are good hardworking people, but they became rich by living in a country of opportunities. They have a duty to contribute more. If they are sitting on 2 billion dollars and their 40 mansions around the country while an average person can't get treatment for cancer without going broke, something is wrong with the system. I am not talking about giving handouts to poor people but at least make healthcare, college education etc more affordable like other developed nations which are doing perfectly fine. e.g. Germany.   I want to be rich, like everyone, but when I do, I want to leave behind a society to my children where everyone is more educated, there are more opportunities and more people have a chance of getting rich rather than a leave them my wealth and a country full of miserable unhealthy, uneducated people where opportunities are scares."
UnexpectedThugLife,3cz4o6,iAmRealCarlosDanger,0,Sun Jul 12 22:22:26 2015 UTC,"I totally agree that rich people should give more, but I dont want to live in a society that takes their money by force.  I will be rich someday and will enjoy giving my money to deserving people, as all wealthy people should.  You are misrepresenting who is being taxed here.  Billionaires only account for 1700 people in US.  I estimate their total networth is about 4-5 trillion, which is less than the annual budget of the US.  To get into the top 2% it takes something like 2 million dollar net worth.  That is/was a sum that is attainable by most people in US.  So it is true that the top 2% have 40% of the wealth, but that statics more points out how not enough people save money.  There is a spending and consumerism problem in our country.  I agree that the political system is broken.  Yes people in US have gotten rich because they have great oppurtunity, but so do the people they are paying their taxes to support.  The crux of my problem with higher taxes, which mainly happen to the rich, is how the money is used.  Money is directly given to people that do not deserve it.  On one hand they recieve free housing, and then on the other hand they have a smart phone, and eat at McDonalds on a regular basis.  I am not getting this from watching Fox news and listening to Rush limbaugh, I rent to HUD people, and go into their houses to fix things, and see them on a regular basis, so I know how they live.  I really wish you could see it through my eyes, and it would make you mad, the welfare system is broken.  First we need to fix how our money is spent/distributed.  I can just see my money going directly out of my pocket, into the pocket of someone that does not deserve it."

There is no force. You cannot always choose how your money will be spent. I being a liberal was against the Iraq and Afganistan wars where a total of 3 trillion dollars of our taxes were spent, where thousands of soldiers dies. I did not ask for it. I don't agree with the government spending 750 billion dollars on military annually when the next 13 countries don't spend that much combined. But I understand that that is the choice that we made as a nation via our elected leaders.   I am not in favor of handing money out, but I am in favor of government spending money and investing money in infrastructure which will create jobs, in education which make us better at competing with other countries and become innovation powerhouse so that we attract more investment, in healthcare so that our people can live healthier and be more productive and also because we owe it to each other to take care of the weakest among us.   If you think of this country as one big family, you'd understand what I am saying. As far as welfare goes, I think that government should be focusing on providing jobs rather than free money but if someone is disabled, we should have welfare for them. We can't turn a blind eye toward someone who is in need and let them die of hunger."

I think we agree, the government has a huge spending problem.  If someone has a spending problem, if you give them more money they will just waste it.  I say before we give them more money, they need to fix their spending addiction.   Everything you say sounds good, but it is not going to happen.  If you give them another billion the will buy F-35."

UnexpectedThugLife,3clrs4,curias00,0,Thu Jul 9 15:08:30 2015 UTC,"Why is everyone saying the 'race card'? As a amatuer Egyptologist I have read more than a few books from antiquity up until more recently on the discovery of Egyptian tombs and Europeans astonishment that the same people that were/had been slaves could have built the pyramids.   He said European and African; Europeans came up with this theory and Africans built the pyramids.   I know I'm risking all of my delicious 'karma' but this 'theory' pisses me off to no end.   And before ""but the Egyptians weren't black"", well I guess me, Lenny Kravitz, Barack Obama, Halle Berry aren't black. 1950 in Mississippi we would definitely be, but in order to further discredit a group of people the Egyptians can't be. There was a 19th century map that color coded regions based on race and had Egypt included with whites. And yes, I know that they weren't jet black African, that's why I used the previous examples of Halle Berry, etc. Egypt was situated in a location that mixing between African, Middle Eastern and Europeans couldn't help but happen.  So why is this important at all? When I was a kid, the only thing I was taught black people did was be slaves, make peanut butter and get civil rights. Martin Luther King and George Washington Carver. On TV Michael Jordan and NWA. A couple of good men and a bunch of rappers and ball players. Knowing that other people of African descent could make these great feats of engineering marvels would instill a greater sense of pride in self and community.   I'm not saying to exaggerate, misshape or twist history in order to prevent gang violence, but at the same time if you don't have any sense of pride your life and the next man's life isn't worth shit..."

If pyramids were found on some white only inhabited island, it would still be ""aliens"".  Stonehenge in Britain is still partially attributed to ""aliens"", which by this reasoning alone should create a paradox because whites would be racist towards themselves.   I think it would be better to concentrate on your own personal accomplishments or failures rather than on those of your ancestors.

If you are a white male then you may have a subconscious feeling of superiority, whilst a black person could have the opposite (and I would argue do, since black on black crime is so high). This is why I personally feel that knowledge of self is important to everyone.  I assume your comment was meant to people in general not to me in particular. I had a very strong community and family to support me and have a great life although most my friends I grew up with don't.

Not all scientists are so egotistical that they think science is the only means of knowing truth (a self-defeating epistemology); nor do they take every opportunity to make pompous, intellectually vacuous statements outside of their field.  Pop-sci figures like Tyson and others remind me of Hercule from Dragon Ball Z. Hercule is a great fighter when compared to the ordinary individual; he has strong personality; and the masses love him, but the real serious fighters are either not well known or are misrepresented by Hercule (or people like him).  Even the brilliant ones, like Stephen Hawking, fall victim to this nonsense sometimes. Sir Martin Rees, for example, has said this regarding Hawking: ""I know Stephen Hawking well enough to know that he has read little philosophy and less theology, so I don't think his views should be taken with any special weight.""  Scientists such as George Ellis or Alexander Vilenkin are much more successful scientists than NDT, but they aren't nearly as popular as him because they are humble, and they don't typically pretend to be experts in disciplines in which they have little-to-no training."

When a 'popular' person holds court, they often maintain their position by reducing people around them. Like they'll talk about cool exclusive things they did, or allude to special relationships they have with other 'popular' people.  You mention breaking a finger, but really any injury, triggers sympathy right? But in the case of a popular person it's like an opportunity for other people to get credit for helping out.   For example, i could say i helped a guy who tripped the other day. Or i could mention that i helped george clooney when he tripped. Maybe he'll thank me somehow, like with a special memento, or an invite to a cool party! But even if he doesn't, you better believe i'm going to tell this 'story' to everyone i know"

The scientific community rightfully decides on the classifications of the disorders/spectrum but for-profit industries take over the majority of the production chain. Drug companies run on the usual business model of cutting corners and maximizing profits. Many doctors are pushed (with financial incentives) to prescribe medication over natural approaches. I am not advocating for alternative or holistic medicine but rather the increased use of preventive care and the promotion of healthy living. Drug companies pump out medications that will pass FDA approval without knowledge of long-term side effects (for good reasons). And, the developing market around vitamin supplements has also contributed to this ""culture"". People in America are over-diagnosed and over-prescribed, a phenomenon brought on partially by making healthcare for-profit and under-regulated."
UnexpectedThugLife,3b9uo8,renovatio93,2,Mon Jul 20 10:28:02 2015 UTC,"with financial incentives) to prescribe medication over natural approaches.   Unfortunately, for a majority of mental illnesses, natural approaches aren't effective on their own. My highest experience comes with depression from both people I've worked with and through my education, and natural approaches such as therapy (I assume this is what you mean) are effective, along with medication being effective, but combined they have the highest success rate (both > medicine alone > therapy alone).  I agree that preventative medicine and healthy living are important, and when I am a physician this is going to be one of my biggest beliefs when helping my patients. Despite this, I'm not going to deny them a medication that I know will help them get started in the right direction because I want them to take natural approaches first. There are a lot of patients with depression who simply won't go to counseling of any sort, but a simple SSRI can make a large impact in their daily life.  In terms of other mental illnesses, most are extremely easy to diagnose and the medications we have available are quite effective. ADHD is the one that people get worked up over because they think that it's just given to any overactive kid, and while that might happen in some cases, oftentimes these kids are highly destructive due to their behaviors and it can bring them back to being able to function in their classes, with friends, etc. again.  The vitamin issue isn't related, but I will agree that vitamins are extremely overused and I believe I read some research recently that showed that anything beyond a simple multivitamin was unnecessary (unless you're some sort of bodybuilder that could truly make use of additional supplements).   People in America are over-diagnosed and over-prescribed, a phenomenon brought on partially by making healthcare for-profit and under-regulated.   I don't really feel like this is the case, or at least to the catastrophic level you're making it out to be. Most physicians are trained to help their patients find the cheapest, yet most effective, form of treatment. This includes trying generic drugs before attempting to use brand-name ones, making lifestyle modifications, and other options to reduce cost. This may not be true in the case of private practice physicians who have more free reign and could be more prone to influence from pharmaceutical companies, but this is the risk you take going to a private practice, and hopefully the people that do so have done the appropriate research about them before going.  If you disagree or have anything you'd like to add, I'd be happy to listen."

UnexpectedThugLife,3b9uo8,PeeFarts,-4,Sat Jun 27 16:30:36 2015 UTC,"I don't have a dog in this fight - but your comparison is flawed.  A classical composer required decades of study (same as modern day symphonic composers) in order to achieve the compositions they did.  The work they did to create their music in no way shape or form is comparable to the amount of work that goes into producing EDM or any other form of modern pop music. Computers have eliminated almost all need for music theory knowledge and have enabled lay people to create music that usually stands on a basic foundation of having a ""good beat"".  Not saying any of this is a bad thing-- just saying that classical composers are not comparable in any way to EDM artists or most of today's composers and producers."
UnexpectedThugLife,3b9uo8,ArcticSpaceman,5,Sat Jun 27 16:41:18 2015 UTC,"not comparable in any way   Well they all make music so, yeah they are actually   general ""it's too easy now no one has to learn theory"" stuff   You don't need to have studied theory to make music or compose something interesting. And aside from that, producing is not just about composing, a producer handles every single element of the way their song sounds, from the synth patches they create and properly EQ and mix, the drums used, the mastering, etc.   These are different skills that just composing a piece, and I think acting as if it's just a cakewall because putting a simple melody together is easier isn't a great argument either."

First of all there's no human performance - so There is no organic interaction between the performer and the audience. Just a bunch of people yelling at speakers. It's good music, just not an organic, authentic live experience.   OP is right and You guys are the reason music is shit and dead now."

UnexpectedThugLife,3b9uo8,neozuki,2,Sat Jun 27 20:47:42 2015 UTC,"You're logic is weak, son. Musical talent is about music, not about performing live. It takes a different set of skills to go out on stage and perform. This is like saying a chef has no cooking talent because he sucks at bringing the food to you.  Just say you don't like electronic stuff. That's all it is. Because either you're stupid and can't separate ""music"" from ""performance"", or you are trying to justify why you don't like electronic music using bullshit reasoning."
UnexpectedThugLife,3b9uo8,NoOrdinaryJeff,-2,Sat Jun 27 20:50:52 2015 UTC,"This is like saying a chef has no cooking talent because he sucks at bringing the food to you.   It's more like saying a chef has no cooking talent because he can't actually cook and only came up with the recipe in his home kitchen one afternoon.  I think this whole thread is a stupid fucking argument that I don't give a shit about, but your analogy is shit."
UnexpectedThugLife,3b9uo8,neozuki,4,Sat Jun 27 18:22:32 2015 UTC,"How doesn't it work? He equated musical talent with live performance. In this context the ability to make the music was never in question, just performing it live. My analogy works fine. It's your reading skills that are shit. But nice try."
UnexpectedThugLife,3b9uo8,NoOrdinaryJeff,-2,Sat Jun 27 19:24:17 2015 UTC,"Your analogy was that live performance is to music composition as carrying a plate is to cooking. You don't have to be the verbal section of the SAT to know that's not even close. Given your defense of said analogy, I am of the belief that you've never cooked, carried a plate, played an instrument or composed music before. I'm not judging you as a person, you just made a shitty analogy. It's okay, just accept it."
UnexpectedThugLife,3b9uo8,neozuki,2,Sat Jun 27 19:35:21 2015 UTC,"The analogy is fine. It's not perfect, but I'm using it for this one discussion, it's not going into the Bible. I'm talking about performing specifically. The entire point was that performance has nothing to do with musical talent. Was Hendrix talented? What about if he was unable to perform due to anxiety? Using the logic I'm trying to refute, no, Hendrix is not musically talented because he can't perform live.   Unless he edited it, go and look at what he said. He's trying to correlate ""pressing play"" with having no musical talent. It's absurd."
UnexpectedThugLife,3b9uo8,AnoK760,-2,Sat Jun 27 19:39:07 2015 UTC,"I actually enjoy some electronic music. I just don't consider it talent in the same way. And i even said some of them are talented. Just most arent, in my opinion.   I just think it takes more musical talent and understanding to play a real instrument, or compose a classical piece. No need for everyone to get butthurt about it."
UnexpectedThugLife,3b9uo8,ArcticSpaceman,2,Sat Jun 27 23:24:50 2015 UTC,"I just think it takes more musical talent   I'm glad you have some sort of quantifying system for the artistic value of a completely subjective medium like music. What is ""more/less musical talent?""  It's all arbitrary. Would you like to also explain why your favorite ice cream flavor is objectively better than mine or how your favorite color kicks my favorite color's ass?  Also, with this shit:   real instrument   knock it the fuck off, what a hot bullshit term, you're the type of person holding music back be being elitist about how music is made and performed."
UnexpectedThugLife,3b9uo8,neozuki,2,Sat Jun 27 21:45:56 2015 UTC,"Music is pure and simple. It's waves hitting your ears and coursing through your body. Who made it, how they made it, what circumstances led to their inspiration, how they felt and how they wanted us to feel, is not the core. The experiences and feelings we attach to music is icing on the cake. It makes music better. But when you try and define what music means to others, based on the unique mishmash of feelings in your head, that's when you go too far.  Plus your whole ""passive aggressively insult them and act surprised when they get mad"" act is about as complex as a sitcom character."

UnexpectedThugLife,3apkde,MrBlisss,48,Mon Jun 22 15:33:10 2015 UTC,See its funny because John Barrowman is a famous actor and is calling the other not famous actors shitty in character but it also makes sense out of character. So we have a double entendre and therefore a joke.

It's his turn to be interviewed! It seems Marc went a bit too far in what he said, but not really now that I know the OCD reference. And there was no reason for Burt to get upset in the first place. Then, Burt escalates the situation from verbal to physical...and dumps a cup on Marc and slaps his hand during the attempted retaliation!   Marc: Maybe 1/2 strike --- Burt: 3 strikes...You...are...outta here!  TL;DR - Marc's comment was maaaybe a bit excessive, but Burt was the main problem.

He was sort of the Adam Sandler of his day, he had horrible taste in roles and made some of the most terrible movies ever inflicted on the public.

You're right, I wouldn't use the word ""nigger"" in the presence of an athletic black man.  If I did, however, that wouldn't give him the right to assault me.  You're not allowed to physically harm someone just because they made a noise with their mouth that you don't like.   Because you know you'd get your ass whooped.   Yeah, you're right.  Doesn't mean he'd get a pass for assaulting me.    The fact that the guy made a dig about Burt's failed marriage doesn't give Burt free-reign to start a fight or throw water or the guy.  Be a grown-up for fuck's sake.   Funny, because I think claiming water being thrown on you is ""assault"" is a move pussies use.   Sweet pun, bro. But hey, so do I.

Would you try to teach potential children about atheism (not that showing them atheism is bad, but if they were too young and impressionable they might ""become atheists"" to avoid going to church or because their parents are one).   Now, if an atheist were to agree to all these things (and possibly a few more things, but maybe not because I can't think of them :P) I would gladly date her. But I highly doubt any atheist would.   But I guess I should have used the term ""marry"", not ""date"". Because you're right, saying such a blanket statement is a foolish thing to do.

Two Justice Department officials have written an op-ed piece describing scared straight programs as ""not only ineffective but is potentially harmful"" to the kids involved. The op-ed appears in the February 1, 2011 edition of the Baltimore Sun, written by OJJDP Acting Administrator Jeff Slowikowski and Laurie O. Robinson. They say that, ""when it comes to our children,"" policymakers and parents should ""follow evidence, not anecdote.""

UnexpectedThugLife,3a3mrc,Simim,-4,Wed Jun 17 19:54:06 2015 UTC,"I always laugh at these kids talking shit to cops and their parents. Clearly they haven't been to my knick of the south, where the cops are happy to beat you after you've gone tanning and where you get to go cut your own switch off the tree out front for an ass whooping.  You wouldn't say shit to a cop if you'd see them beat down a suspect.  Edit: there's this pronoun, the ""generic you"" which is used impersonally, indefinitely, to an unspecified subject. I am not referring to anyone, including myself, specifically with this generic ""you/one/they."""
UnexpectedThugLife,3a3mrc,MaryJaneandMolly,5,Wed Jun 17 20:15:51 2015 UTC,Bullshit I doubt you've never had a confrontation with the cops. The only reason you're saying that shit is probably because your friends boost themselves up and lie about getting beat up by cops.
UnexpectedThugLife,3a3mrc,Simim,0,Wed Jun 17 18:45:39 2015 UTC,"Any time I'm ever pulled over, it is yes sir/ma'am, no sir/ma'am, what seems to be the problem officer, thank you, please, you're welcome, alrighty, you take care now, even god bless if need be.  Again, you don't say shit to cops. Their mood entirely determines if you're going to jail or not.  I'm not that idiot who's yelling out YOU CAN'T DETAIN ME AM I FREE TO LEAVE AM I FREE TO LEAVE I DO NOT CONSENT TO A SEARCH snarky crap with a sarcastic attitude. Those people get arrested, those people get searched, go to jail, get tickets when they could have gotten away with a warning.  It's really not that difficult to pull off: kiss ass to the pigs and make sure anything you're carrying is entirely concealable/hideable or you can ditch it before they notice.  Common sense. They hold the power, so you kiss ass until you're able to be on an equal playing field. You can take the shit to court later if you felt you were wrongfully harassed, but for the time being, you're not the one with a gun and taser so tuck down your pride and be polite.  Edit: Don't wanna consent to a search? Now all the cop's gotta do is say they smell weed. They officially have probable cause/suspicion to search your car/house/person anyway. All resisting is going to do is make them bug you even more."
UnexpectedThugLife,3a3mrc,MaryJaneandMolly,2,Wed Jun 17 20:34:52 2015 UTC,How does any of this have to do with cops beating you or your friends
UnexpectedThugLife,3a3mrc,Simim,1 point,Wed Jun 17 21:13:52 2015 UTC,"It doesn't. My original comment was saying that if these smartass kids had ever seen cops beat someone down, they might shut their mouths and show some respect.  I've never been beat by a cop. Neither have most people I associate with. However I have seen cops take down and beat a man, and the area I live in is notorious for having trigger-happy 5-0  Therefore, since I do not want to be their lucky target of attention, I don the persona of humble softspoken polite law-abiding citizen whenever interacting with them.  You catch less cops with honey than vinegar.   Edit: Also, there is this thing called a ""generic you:"" one/you/they. It is used in a impersonal or indefinite subject manner. It does not necessarily mean I am talking to you specifically, and it doesn't necessarily mean I am referring to myself. It is commonly used throughout the English language."
UnexpectedThugLife,3a3mrc,DeschainDuGilead,1 point,Wed Jun 17 21:40:11 2015 UTC,"My god, you're such a worm. You disgust me."
UnexpectedThugLife,3a3mrc,Simim,0,Wed Jun 17 21:54:53 2015 UTC,"Call me a worm all you want. Rather be a free worm than an imprisoned bird.   It must be so easy for you to just call up your rich parents and ask for bail money. Do you think jail's some sort of time-out resort?  Or is that you think police officers are all honest, reliable, humble civil servants who would never do anything wrong? That there isn't a systemic series of flaws that favors the cops? That cops don't have other cops' backs? That quotas don't exist?   Or perhaps you think a criminal record isn't that important. That you could just walk in anywhere and still get hired. That people wouldn't judge you the moment you said you'd been to jail before. That your employer will definitely understand if you were late to work because you were arrested.  Even if you're doing nothing wrong you can still be detained and take up several hours of your time for all sorts of bullshit. All they need is suspicion or probable cause. Probable cause is virtually anything.  I was pulled over and threatened with pepper spray while walking, no joke, because I have a mohawk. The officer said there were a string of car thefts around the area and the suspect had a mohawk. The ""area"" turned out to be several miles away from me. That is to say, he saw me walking around minding my own business, decided I ""looked suspicious"" in my neon colored clothing, and proceeded to stop me. Turns out the suspect also happened to be the opposite gender.  Because profiling doesn't exist, am I right? And shit, I'm white. There are a lot of fucking racist douchebags around here; it's fairly certain several of them made their way into law enforcement. I can't even imagine having to avoid being too ""uppity"" if I was black.   My best friend is Native American; we both got patted down for walking around a park. He was immediately asked ""what colors you claiming, hombre?"" by one of the officers. He asked what hombre meant. Cop goes, ""you know what it means, Jose. Go ahead, keep it up. Where's your car parked at, we might need to search that too.""   You're technically under arrest any time you've been pulled over; it's entirely up to the officer's discretion as to whether you're remaining under arrest. You do not have to have Miranda rights read. If you leave without the officer's consent, you are resisting arrest. All the cop's gotta do is say ""no"" if you're acting like a dick and you're just gonna stay there all day long until they decide you can go.  Now, I understand that the system is flawed and in law enforcement's favor. I don't like it one bit. However, if I'm the only person around, no other witnesses besides me and the cop, what's to stop officer so-and-so from just saying I did something? Who's going to believe me?  Yes, I can take that to court. And I might very well win. Do I have thousands of dollars to afford a lawyer? Nope. Are good lawyers cheap? Nope.  So until some day in the future where all cops are required to wear cameras and I can guarantee I won't be arrested for no good reason, I'm going to shut my mouth and play nice.  My pride isn't worth getting arrested. I can't fight to change the system from a jail cell."

UnexpectedThugLife,3a3mrc,amedeus,7,Wed Jun 17 05:58:33 2015 UTC,Ok but let's be honest here. To actually try and find the problem and fix it in an individual would take more than a few minutes of lecturing them. It's not just realizing that what you're doing is bad because not every case is the same. It could take weeks or months of work on every individual and then maybe years to prove that it worked. It just wouldn't be good television. Best way to make it work would be to take a large portion of the money these shows make donated to people who can actually help.

UnexpectedThugLife,39t94e,autowikibot,3,Sun Jun 14 16:42:25 2015 UTC,"John Wayne:       Marion Mitchell Morrison (born Marion Robert Morrison; May 26, 1907 – June 11, 1979), better known by his stage name John Wayne, was an American film actor, director, and producer.  An Academy Award-winner, Wayne was among the top box office draws for three decades.   An enduring American icon, and worldwide cultural figure [citation needed], he epitomized rugged masculinity and is famous for his demeanor, including his distinctive calm voice, walk, and height.  Wayne was born in Winterset, Iowa, but his family relocated to the greater Los Angeles area when he was nine years old. He graduated from Glendale High School (Glendale, California). He found work at local film studios when he lost his football scholarship to USC as a result of a bodysurfing accident.  :63–64 Initially working for the Fox Film Corporation, he mostly appeared in small bit parts. His first leading role came in Raoul Walsh's lavish widescreen epic The Big Trail (1930), which led to leading roles in numerous B movies throughout the 1930s, many of them in the western genre. His career rebounded in 1939, with John Ford's Stagecoach making him an instant mainstream star. Wayne would go on to star in 142 pictures. Biographer Ronald Davis says: ""John Wayne personified for millions the nation's frontier heritage. Eighty-three of his movies were Westerns, and in them he played cowboys, cavalrymen, and unconquerable loners extracted from the Republic's central creation myth.""   Among his better-known later films are The Quiet Man (1952), in which he is an Irish-American in love with a fiery spinster played by Maureen O'Hara; The Searchers (1956), in which he plays a Civil War veteran whose young niece (Natalie Wood) is abducted by a tribe of Comanches in an Indian raid; Rio Bravo (1959), playing a sheriff with Dean Martin; The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance (1962), portraying a troubled rancher competing with Eastern lawyer (James Stewart) for a woman's hand in marriage; True Grit (1969), as a humorous U.S. Marshal who sets out to avenge a man's death in the role that won Wayne his Academy Award; and The Shootist (1976), his final screen performance, in which he plays an aging gunfighter battling cancer. Wayne was a prominent Republican in Hollywood, supporting anti-communist positions.  In June 1999, the American Film Institute named Wayne 13th among the Greatest Male Screen Legends of All Time.

That was a short fling.  But it's these same kids who complain about not getting jobs, and whining about the state of this country, but they refuse to be informed and refuse to take any sort of responsibility for their own actions.

Would you call Michael Jordan, or Larry Bird, or Kareem Abdul-Jabbar just good at basketball? Or would you call them great? Similarly, would you call DeSagana Diop, DeMarre Carroll, or Tony Battie good? Just because someone plays basketball, doesn't mean they're a good player. But when you have guys like Steph Curry, who pretty much carried his team to and through the finals and mostly performed above and beyond the call of duty during this season, you have good players.

In cases like these, physical punishment is an effective way to train the horse. I'm not advocating beating the shit out of it, just some good solid slaps with the crop."
UnexpectedThugLife,39g146,wudaokor,10,Fri Jun 12 02:59:46 2015 UTC,"in cases like these, physical punishment is an effective way to train the horse.   With an aggressive bit and good riding.

UnexpectedThugLife,39g146,NathanDeger,8,Fri Jun 12 04:24:46 2015 UTC,"Thank you. The answer is never beating it with a crop. Yah you may have to dig your heels and be firm with them, but smacking your horse is no way to train them. The only time you should ever do something like that is when they try and bite you or another animal, and even that only requires a hand. A crop is just going to make the animal afraid of the crop."

UnexpectedThugLife,39g146,somekid66,1 point,Fri Jun 12 09:27:00 2015 UTC,"Fencing response:       The fencing response is a peculiar position of the arms following a concussion. Immediately after moderate forces have been applied to the brainstem, the forearms are held flexed or extended (typically into the air) for a period lasting up to several seconds after the impact. The fencing response is often observed during athletic competition involving contact, such as American football, hockey, rugby and martial arts. It is used as an overt indicator of injury force magnitude and midbrain localization to aid in injury identification and classification for events including, but not limited to, on-field and/or bystander observations of sports-related head injuries.     Image i - Schematic illustration of the fencing response during a knockout. A. The individual receives a punch to the head. B. After the traumatic blow to the head, the unconscious individual immediately exhibits arm extension on the same side of the body as the site that received the blow and arm flexion on the opposite side while falling to the ground. C. During prostration, the rigidity of the extended and flexed arms is retained for several seconds as flaccidity gradually returns.

Sometimes it sucks because you want to say ""it's just an animal"", but with things that we expect to be able to handle human interaction, that's the standard. Being dangerous is a no-no."
UnexpectedThugLife,39g146,alexaspaghetti,4,Fri Jun 12 09:35:30 2015 UTC,"A horse's self defense is kicking....It's not violence. Riders are taught from day one that kicking is a threat. Yes, that horse was bad and bucked her off (he wasn't trying very hard honestly). But she should've gotten up calmly, to at least lower some of the flight risk, and walked up to him at least silently and gotten back on to work on the problem. Yes, I would be angry too but self-control is important, especially if you're dealing with an animal that is larger and more powerful than you."

If you do things which are known to freak out a horse, you accept the risks which come with it.  You can't be an ignorant fool around large animals.  Animals are amoral and they run on instinct and have their own social language, you can't expect them to automatically disregard something which is triggering their fight-or-flight instincts.  What happened to that girl was completely her own fault for being stupid and not interacting with the horse properly."

If you're thinking of getting one, and you can do so, I would definitely say do it. It looks like so much fun and it just really is. I got to have a drive along in a BRZ and it is just a great car, it hugs corners, it isn't blazing fast, but it is just so fun, I can't describe it. It looks great, I love the look. Also, the owner did a bit of a drift along a corner and it seemed to initiate and hold so easily, it was bone stock, but the tires wailed. The aftermarket and following of the 86 is huge.

I actually really want an E36, there's a lot on CL in my area for around 5k, but they all look beat up, too many miles, shitty mods, or I'm worried about all the things people say about cheap BMW's breaking down, I think one of them in specific had to do with a chain or bearings in the block or something.   Yup, already saving. So far I haven't had a job, but I've been saving my financial aid money from college, but this summer I'm getting a job. My long term goal is to afford a down payment on a house by the time I'm 30, so in 12 years. After some number crunching and how I expect the market to be at that time, I would need about $800 a month for 144 months to have $130k for a 20% down on a pretty nice house in my area. That's not even accounting for inflation though, but I still need to figure out how I would be investing for better leverage on my money.  Fuck, i just went on a total tangent, sorry, I tend to do that.   Forgot that I need to save up some nickels for girls to touch my pickle.   Thanks for the advice on the test drives too. I never thought they would take time to do a test drive without a guaranteed incentive, like they would see some kid wanting to test drive a car who can't buy one and just laugh them out, but I'll try what you said if they really will allow such a thing it I do what you said."

It's so nimble and precise feeling. Something like an Evo or STI is just pretty basic feeling, like a typical fast car and I don't really like the style of them, everyone seems to have them too. With an 86, it catches the eye and it just feels different. Idk, it's hard to explain. Either way, I really like what it offers and I would prefer it over something else with more power unless you're getting into something twice as expensive."
UnexpectedThugLife,38tq2d,ahm911,1 point,Sun Jun 7 20:34:32 2015 UTC,"6 speed BRZ here!! Advice for the typical driver: don't go with the automatic. They're traded in all the time, mostly because as a daily driver for the general public it isn't practical. Small, slightly harsh ride, not much sound deadening.... That said, if you enjoy driving, and feeling connected to the machine, it is an absolutely incredible little car for the price. I plan on keeping it forever.  Short edit: if you're worried about power, and have about 5k to throw into it, a forced induction setup makes more power on the same amount of boost and same turbo as the ej25 in the WRX.  Also, it loves to be sideways. So easy to control, it is a drifter's dream."

Edit:  From my understanding the Versa is not easy to convert into a sleeper.  It would require a custom modification to nearly every major component of the car:  Only a potential select few engines would fit the chassis (and these are horribly expensive) and still would require extensive modifications, and it would probably shred the factory drivetrain; Thus, it would be cheaper to just buy a hunk-o-junk and start from scratch, while keeping the Versa for long trips (~40 mpg).  Edit(2x):  In OP's video you see a VW Golf easily handle a couple of souped up cars.  It's a sleeper (It was hidden.  A ""sleeper"" cell.  You woke the dragon, son.)"

UnexpectedThugLife,38qoyv,E_hV,0,Sat Jun 6 21:03:55 2015 UTC,"Last time I checked there were no laws regarding acceleration of motor vehicles, nor lane splitting the latter being more of a legal gray area. While I do not agree with lane spiltting at any considerable speed, lane splitting itself is a safety thing. It provides you with less of a chance to be pinned between two cars if you are rear ended. As for accelerating from a stop unless your front wheel is lifting off the ground I see nothing wrong, I'd personally rather provide as much distance between myself and other drivers to minimize a chance of an accident. Furthermore motorcycles are typically more stable at speed similar to a bicycle. In addition all motorcycles accelerate quickly compared to cars due to their reduced weight.   No offense but maybe you should make a less bias opinion of motorcycles and motorcyclist. Consider talking to some and learning their side and why they do certain things. Also, unless your observations are backed by data than you are already guilty of a bias no matter how impartial you think you are being. It's how we are wired."

If two guys in a field were throwing baseball bats at each other, that wouldn't be thug, would be a bit odd, but it wouldn't be thug. If some guy was sitting in the stands of a baseball game, enjoying his beverage and a baseball bat got hurled at him and he caught it, one handed, without spilling his beverage and saving some one from getting a Louisville slugger to the head. That would be thug.  But that's just my interpretation of the meaning, some one that does something bad ass or has swagger.

I ride a 50cc scooter, and have a top speed of about 43mph, and most of the roads in my area of town have a 45mph speed limit. I'm in the rightmost lane, per courtesy, and a pickup truck is behind me for about two minutes. No cars in either of the lanes for at least a half mile, but the driver stays behind me before then going around and yelling ""Get the fuck off of the road!"" and flipping me off. I shake my head, which I guess he saw, since he slowed down and waited for me to pass before following me. I notice him and pull into a bank parking lot, where there's cameras and a cop inside. He pulls aside and asks if I want to fight. I warn him that there's cameras and that if he follows me further, I'll have him reported to the police. He keeps yelling that he'll kick my ass as I tell him to go home and have a beer, and I just ride off.  I don't get people sometimes."

UnexpectedThugLife,37mpfb,unitedairforce1,10,Fri May 29 01:26:52 2015 UTC,"ACTUALLY- FWIW, the etymology of redneck refers to the red bandannas worn by newly unionized miners in West Virginia to separate them from non-union scabs and to act as something as a uniform for their armed battles with the Pinkertons/Baldwin-Felts agents and US military.  Popularized (although missing from the wikipedia entry for some reason) at the Battle of Blair Mountain.  You are absolutely correct that there is a very large distinction between a redneck and white trash, though. I know some rednecks who make $150k a year and have college degrees and who are active in their communities. Not so much the white trash."

For five days in late August and early September 1921, in Logan County, West Virginia, some 10,000 armed coal miners confronted 3,000 lawmen and strikebreakers, called the Logan Defenders,  who were backed by coal mine operators during an attempt by the miners to unionize the southwestern West Virginia coalfields. The battle ended after approximately one million rounds were fired,  and the United States Army intervened by presidential order.

That doesn't give him the right to try and run them off the road.  Pretty much every person in the video is an idiot."
UnexpectedThugLife,37mpfb,dilespla,34,Thu May 28 21:11:34 2015 UTC,"What do you mean by this? From the video the biker was only going 77. Which is speeding pretty much anywhere in the US, nevertheless, the truck driver was almost completely in the opposing lane and almost hit the other biker. His only excuse was I have kids in the back. I think he deserved to get knocked on his ass for his behavior.  EDIT:: I stand corrected, there was another video that was made private that I didn't know about with him going over 170mph in a neighborhood. I will agree now that everyone is stupid in this video. The truck, even if he was enacting ""justice"" shouldn't have done so especially with kids in the back. If he wasn't he just needs to own up to the fact that he wasn't paying attention, even though by the looks of it he is facing forward during the whole endeavor."
UnexpectedThugLife,37mpfb,TheCalvinator,29,Thu May 28 21:17:31 2015 UTC,"There was another video on his YouTube channel, where he was speeding well in the excess of 100MPH, but he made the video private, probably got to know somehow (maybe Analytics) that his video was getting traction on Reddit."
UnexpectedThugLife,37mpfb,Ausrufepunkt,23,Thu May 28 21:47:07 2015 UTC,"He went through and took most of their video's down.  I love bikes, and don't have a problem with any other bikers in town, but these two assclowns are going to kill themselves or someone else.  They really are ripping through residential areas going way over the speed limit.  Just the other day I was at my kids baseball game and they tore ass past the park, and a school zone, going at least 90 in a 25.  Cops around here won't chase a bike either, too dangerous.  Up until two nights ago, when this video went viral, they would be out riding until about 11pm.  I could hear them on the highway racing up and down from the red light to the next intersection.  My first thought is that they are laying low, or got busted for the assault, but the guy that did the headbutting is still posting on his facebook page.    Edit:  I should add that the truck driver got off easy with just a headbutt, he should have had his ass beat.  Either way, both parties are stupid.  Another Edit:  Apparently the guy with the camera worked for the sheriffs office.  Key word ""worked,"" he is no longer employed.  Still no word of any charges being filed on anyone."

UnexpectedThugLife,37mpfb,flacciddick,1 point,Thu May 28 22:25:45 2015 UTC,Because of government mandates they make them way to fast to avoid them being slow at all.

If you don't believe me then get your needle bang on 70 mph, and simultaneously have a sat-nav that gives you your speed. Bet you anything you like it'll read 62 - 64 mph (ie, about 10% less than your speedo). Iv'e tested it myself. Also, if your bike is telling you that you're doing 100, and are actually doing 92 (or at least thats how a citroen c1 is set up), then you won't be doing 100 when you inevitably slam the breaks on, but can still say to all your friends ""i was goin at 100"", even though what you mean is ""i was going at indicated 100""."

UnexpectedThugLife,35y6it,RBDtwisted,-8,Fri May 15 04:41:57 2015 UTC,"This is not what happened. The statement was, ""Some people are worried that it's not going to be finished"". It's a statement of fact and GRRM was asked to comment on that fact.   Either he will finish the series or die before he finishes the series. I know he doesn't deny this fact. Do you?"
UnexpectedThugLife,35y6it,officerkondo,60,Fri May 15 04:23:56 2015 UTC,I think he still would have told the producers how the story ends. With the amount of things that have been changed from the books they'd almost need to know how everything ends so that they are able to continue to write in a more TV friendly fashion and still reach a conclusion that makes sense and will jive with the books. Sort of like how JK Rowling let Alan Rickman in on Snape's endgame as to create a more convincing continuity throughout the movies.

NB: ""I didn't know he was a double agent."""
UnexpectedThugLife,35y6it,officerkondo,7,Thu May 14 20:46:29 2015 UTC,"Fair enough points.  GRRM has also stated that he doesn't want anyone to finish his books should he pass before the series is completed. I'm not sure what that says about him, whether he is confident in his health or just doesn't care about the readers. Maybe he feels telling the producers the conclusion gives him a bit of a safety net in that regard, either way I don't really care I just want him to finish the fucking books."
UnexpectedThugLife,35y6it,gesamtkunstwerk,7,Thu May 14 16:20:18 2015 UTC,"I just want him to finish the fucking books.   Agreed! If he does die before then, the good thing is that I don't think he has any kids to ruin the series like Frank Herbert's kid did with Dune."
UnexpectedThugLife,35y6it,officerkondo,3,Fri May 15 04:50:07 2015 UTC,"Oh lord, if having someone finish his work would result in anything like those last two Dune books... yeah I'd rather have them not finished."

UnexpectedThugLife,35y6it,elbruce,4,Thu May 14 16:41:10 2015 UTC,"Yeah I was a little harsh with the not caring about the readers comment.  Anyone who's ever watched an interview with him knows the guy cares about his audience, it just gets frustrating. I only started reading the books shortly before the show came out and it's difficult to imagine the wait that people who have read from the beginning have had to endure. I want him to finish and I want him to continue to hold himself to the quality standard he has used for so long, but I'm also a really impatient asshole."
UnexpectedThugLife,35y6it,gesamtkunstwerk,3,Thu May 14 16:49:49 2015 UTC,"There is, actually, a sort of implied commitment in beginning a seven volume series of books and asking people to read them before all seven volumes are released. You're saying, on some level, ""read these books -- the story isn't finished, but I really do plan on finishing them and not leaving you hanging."" If this implied commitment did not exist, people would simply not buy multi-volume sets until the whole series was complete (which would suck for everyone)."

UnexpectedThugLife,35y6it,yungun,-7,Thu May 14 16:31:32 2015 UTC,"My grandparents are not obese, they are there because they are old and can't take care of themselves and have dementia, just like all the other people there.  All of them are old, only some are fat, so this argument you are conjuring about fat people in nursing homes is simply bullshit.  Once you are past 60 you are rolling the dice, there are all sorts of conditions that land you in that home.  Good for that 80yo dude you ran with, but he is an outlier.  As a wise man once said, ""You see plenty of young runners people in the streets.  And plenty of old people.  But you rarely see old runners.""  Did you expect to see tons of old fat people at your marathon?  There is nothing wrong with an old, healthy person having other hobbies, reading, gardening, etc.  Of course that one old dude is going to seem like an inspiration.  Remember that no how much you respect that old man, he is still going to end up with a nurse wiping his ass, don't pretend like running a marathon now and then is going to save anyone from that fate."
UnexpectedThugLife,35y6it,Chewzilla,-1,Fri May 15 02:15:49 2015 UTC,"that argument stemmed from his earlier point that fat people don't live long enough to make it to nursing-home age, which they do and I see it twice a week literally"
UnexpectedThugLife,35y6it,Chewzilla,2,Thu May 14 16:36:21 2015 UTC,"which they do and I see it twice a week literally   There's a difference between becoming obese at an old age, and growing up obese for most of your life. Just because you see seniors that are overweight, doesn't mean they were that way growing up. Take these seniors, for instance:  http://www.blogs.va.gov/VAntage/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/honorflightblog.jpg  They are most likely overweight by BMI standards, however they are WW2 veterans who were in fighting shape during the war. They gain weight as they grow older because their metabolism isn't what it was before and they lose mobility. However, their bodies didn't suffer from decades of obesity when they were growing up.  There is a difference. I would be willing to bet that the overweight seniors you see ""twice a week, literally"" had a much healthier weight when they were young."

Average male life expectancy for the US: 77.4 years1  Average effect of class III obesity on life expectancy: -9 years2  George RR Martin is 66, which means he's quickly approaching the age beyond which class III obese people are not expected to survive; before you ask, George RR Martin is well beyond the minimum for class III ""super obesity""; he's easily 300 lbs., and at his 5'6"" height, that puts him at nearly 50 kg/m2."
UnexpectedThugLife,35y6it,AdmiralCrunch9,5,Thu May 14 19:32:41 2015 UTC,"On the other hand people born after 1940 who make it past 55 and are in the top 10% of wealth have a life expectancy of 90 instead of 77.  Not sure how that would interplay with weight, but Martin has definitely been raking in the cash recently, and being  able to afford the best doctors can be a big help."
UnexpectedThugLife,35y6it,ErisGrey,3,Thu May 14 20:26:19 2015 UTC,Assuming he is going to doctors. Never underestimate someone not wanting to go to their doctor to hear bad news. Think of Steve Jobs refusal to get his cancer treated by doctors. He wasn't exactly hurting for money at the time.
UnexpectedThugLife,35y6it,s54b32dd,14,Thu May 14 20:29:50 2015 UTC,"You make a good point about wealthy people and life expectancy. However, that only extends as far as you're willing to listen to good advice.  Obesity is going to kill him; it's only a question of when, and it's probably too late to prevent the slide, at this point. The odds say that it's probably going to kill him sooner, rather than later."
UnexpectedThugLife,35y6it,AdmiralCrunch9,3,Thu May 14 21:00:02 2015 UTC,"It's a complicated issue.  On the one hand those statistics I posted are probably at least partially based on wealthier people being less likely to be obese in the first place.  On the other hand, there are many mitigating effects that wealth could have on his life expectancy besides getting good advice.  He(assumedly) has less stress in his life than someone the same weight living paycheck to paycheck or struggling to pay off their mortgage.  If he ends up needing bypass surgery or a heart transplant, he's more likely to get it done quickly and with better doctors than a person with less money.  During the recuperation time, he again would benefit from reduced stress due to his not needing to worry about how he'll pay for it or when he could get back to work.  Finally he can afford the best and latest medications to regulate cholesterol and other health risks.  Add in the fact that we don't know what his family health history is, and we have a whole host of other factors unaccounted for.  Basically what I'm saying is that it's a bad idea to base a prediction for an individual off of only variable.  A single variable can be great at predicting demographic trends, but useless when looking at an individual.  GRRM might have died while I was writing this, or he might live another thirty years.  His weight absolutely puts him in a very high risk demographic, but it's also not the only thing about him that affects his life expectancy."
UnexpectedThugLife,35y6it,s54b32dd,3,Thu May 14 17:16:35 2015 UTC,"He(assumedly) has less stress in his life than someone the same weight living paycheck to paycheck or struggling to pay off their mortgage.   GRRM was a pretty average professional writer for most of his life; received critical acclaim, published several times, able to make a living (for the most part, with supplemental income from editing, etc.), but not really becoming wealthy until ASOIAF became very popular.   A single variable can be great at predicting demographic trends, but useless when looking at an individual.   True. That being said, GRRM is well past morbid obesity. It's incredibly unlikely that his weight hasn't had a significant impact on his overall health to this point in his life, and even with the best medicine available, he's not willing/able to change his lifestyle, which means he's probably living on borrowed time as it is.  Extreme obesity isn't a guarantee of an early demise; it's about as solid an indicator as we have, though."

UnexpectedThugLife,35y6it,s54b32dd,0,Thu May 14 20:11:26 2015 UTC,"The stages are based on traditional measurements such as body mass index (BMI). A BMI of 30 or above is termed obese.  The system also takes into account clinical measurements such as high blood pressure and diabetes.  Those obese people in stages 2 or 3, who had moderate to severe co-existing medical conditions, were 1.6 to 1.7 times as likely as the normal-weight people to die from any cause during the follow-up.  They were more than two times as likely to die of a cardiovascular cause.   So what this says, is that as soon as you are diagnosed with an obesity-related illness (which is up to 2x as likely in the obese population as the ""normal weight"" folks), you are no longer considered a part of the study.  So. If you make it 16 years as an obese person, don't get diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes, don't have cardiovascular disease, and don't get other weight-related/""coexisting"" medical issues, you're not expected to die any more than a normal weight person.  Which is not really a shocker; we all know that it's the complications from obesity (i.e. diabetes, cardiovascular disease, illness, etc.) that typically kill you early.  Thus, if you're lucky enough to be obese without complications, and if you are in stage 0 or 1 obesity (which basically means you're at a BMI of 35 or below), you're not significantly more likely to die of heart disease than a normal weight person."

UnexpectedThugLife,35e86x,DammitDan,3,Sun May 10 00:51:32 2015 UTC,A guy could easily get a handle on that situation without the need violent force... 99% of the time the guy is going to be bigger and stronger than the girl; there's no threat; there's un comfort and disrespect; but most guys realize the damage they can cause to a girl with a punch or slap will far outweigh the moment of discomfort and unpleasantness they caused them. It's simply unfair and most guys are aware of that. When you go do that to a girl there's an immediate threat which is why she will more than likely react violently by slapping you or at least pushing you away..  If a dude does it to another dude all bets are off.. That's an even playing field and you just disrespected and sexually assaulted someone. I'm not saying every guy should punch another guy in the face for it; but you shouldn't be surprised if that's how a guy reacts to another guy sexually assaulting them.. He crossed a boundary. Simple as that. If you can't understand that then idk what to tell you.

UnexpectedThugLife,35e86x,EXV,-1,Sun May 10 01:17:28 2015 UTC,"As others said, because it's sexual assault and gays have no complimentary ticket at this point. I knocked a gay person out once in my life as well and I am not homophobic, it had to do with the sexual assault.  I was in a club with some friends and my girldfriend, there was this gay stranger sitting on the right from me, my girldfriend on the left as same as my friends. He started to flirt with me and I said ""Hey, sorry, I am not gay and my girlfriend is sitting on the left"". He started to touch me, my girlfriend talked to him, it looked as he wouldn't care about all the facts...  We decided to stand up to search another bench, you know, you don't want trouble in a club, it's shitty. However, he followed us and then it seemed as he would enjoy to upset us, he either really didn't get what we told him (unlikely), or he now enjoyed to be that gay bully and thought his sexuality would be something like a bubble that would protect him from anything. Because, then it happened, he gave me a kiss...  Everything else did just take seconds, I punched him in the face, did hit him quite hard, he hit the ground and slept for a moment.  Everyone around us who didn't notice the kiss thought I just beat someone up, other guys started trouble lol, my friends protected me, discussions bla bla, we told some securities what happened, they only believed after several other strangers who saw the kiss told them that it really happened... Police came, the gay guy didn't want to file charges, me neither, anyway, we decided to leave the club and went to another one to finally have a great night.  I am honest, nothing happened in my head, anything in my brain decided to instantly punch him in the face. I think I had the right to do it, I didn't even think about it, my brain just decided to defend my body. Again, beeing gay doesn't protect you, doing sexual assault will most likely get you beaten up, as same as almost any other bully gets beaten up at some point.  EDIT: removed at least a few typos, sorry I'm German and English noob :D"

But what this leads to is a large amount of ""down low"" men, or men who pretend to be heterosexual to get by and secretly have sexual encounters with men, which is also a huge problem in urban areas.

That's exactly what the outcry is.   There will, of course, be unreasonable people more focused on the stigma of ""cop"" grouped in with reasonable people, but that's doing the same thing as those stigmatizing cops, and so, ironically, all outcry against police savagery is being stigmatized.

A video of someone walking on the sidewalk and getting run over by a car shouldn't make you stop walking on sidewalks.

Edit: Also let's not kid ourselves, most pedophiles aren't as calm, cool and attractive as 'Matt' was in that video.  People of all ages notice when something is off about a person, but an actor playing a part with full understanding that there's no repercussions for his actions doesn't have those telltale signs."

UnexpectedThugLife,34xecu,AustinTreeLover,15,Tue May 5 15:05:48 2015 UTC,"Agreed, it's great advice that your child needs to know.  But parents shouldn't stay up all night at the thought of the charismatic pedophile with an ice cream truck kidnapping their kids anytime soon."
UnexpectedThugLife,34xecu,TitoTheMidget,12,Tue May 5 15:27:39 2015 UTC,"Intuitively, this makes sense, but, I think we should be very careful with the ""can't hurt"" attitude on this one.   It may not hurt, as individual parents, but it likely doesn't help much and, on a larger scale, it does more harm than good.   Source: Ice cream truck-owning pervert.   I'm kidding, just hear me out.  Kids are not little adults. Their brains do not process cause and effect the same way adult brains do. The biggest factor in terms of how a child learns, is the time between the action and the consequence.   For instance, a 3-year-old learns not to touch a hot stove because there is a nearly immediate consequence. If burns didn't hurt until the next day, toddlers on fire everywhere.   This would happen no matter how many times the parent tells the kid not to touch the stove.   There are exceptions, or outliers, but generally, this is how humans operate.   What Stranger Danger really reinforces is a general association between strangers and danger that isn't complex enough in the child's mind to be useful, but establishes enough of an association to be harmful.   By default, Stranger Danger disassociates danger and familiarity. Since most kids are victimized by people they know, Stranger Danger campaigns have done more to aid child predator efforts than berry-flavored wine coolers.  And remember, doctors, teachers, and school bus drivers are all strangers on the kid's first day. Yet, we reinforce the idea these people are to be obeyed. This puts children in a position of making adult-level decisions before they've fully developed the capacity to do so. These distinctions among strangers (who should and shouldn't be trusted and at what point that changes and why) are too nuanced for a child's brain.   I'm not saying that you shouldn't warn your kids, but just be careful not to lapse into a false sense of security. If your kid is in the ""normal range"" there is a good chance s/he will go for the ice cream. And too much emphasis on strangers will lead your child to dismiss the statistically more likely threat of a sneaky-peeky youth minister or t-ball coach.   I'll end by saying, it makes absolute sense parents wouldn't know this. The media has really screwed us on this one. We've been fed false information and of the worst kind, the kind that instinctively seems right to us and yet, potentially endangers our children.    (Don't get me started on D.A.R.E.)

We teach our kids situational awareness. That includes never walking away with someone or getting into anyones vehicle at all. period. That includes police vehicles.

The block happened to be a school. A few kids come up to the mesh fence to see the dog. More come until there's probably about 50 of them.

UnexpectedThugLife,34xecu,BobbyBeltran,21,Tue May 5 15:38:36 2015 UTC,"Statistically did they count that stranger danger has been beaten into kids heads for the last twenty years?  Statistically, what would have happened if stranger danger was never a thing?  I don't see how this is proof that teaching kids to be wary of strangers is folly. For all we know, the stranger danger program has reduced the number of stranger abductions, making the 'majority' all occur by close adults."
UnexpectedThugLife,34xecu,daimposter,10,Tue May 5 13:14:51 2015 UTC,"Just like how terrorist attacks stopped happening after the TSA - the TSA must have prevented them! We'd better give them more money!  Or how this stone prevents tiger attacks!  I was born in the 80s and I never heard of ""stranger danger"" until I had a child last year. I knew not to follow/trust strangers, but I also knew who to find when I needed help or got lost.  I'm not saying Stranger Danger is not effective, but I do think your logic is misguided when applied to other low-likelihood high-damage risks. It is more important to draw conclusions from data, not fear."
UnexpectedThugLife,34xecu,jargoon,4,Tue May 5 14:40:59 2015 UTC,"Have you ever thought that might be because 'stranger danger' warnings have be essentially programmed into kids since the 1980's?

Kinda like those idiots that want to shut down the EPA because our air and water are clean so we don't need the EPA --- ignoring the fact that it is clean BECAUSE of the EPA."
UnexpectedThugLife,34xecu,bark_wahlberg,5,Tue May 5 15:59:57 2015 UTC,"I'm not super sure about that. My parents and I had a secret code word for emergency pickups and such, but they also taught me how to take the bus at a young age and let me run off with my friends as long as I checked in every so often and let them know what was up.

UnexpectedThugLife,34xecu,spookypickles87,2,Tue May 5 14:17:55 2015 UTC,"Maybe the statistics for abductions from strangers are so low because we teach them about ""stranger danger"". If they start trusting whatever stranger comes up to them, one could assume abductions rise."
UnexpectedThugLife,34xecu,nerfAvari,2,Tue May 5 17:16:57 2015 UTC,"Well, I think parents should teach their children to be leery of strangers. When my sister and I were about 6 years old, we were outside just having a blast on our grandparents sidewalk, when this guy in a white car pulled up and asked if we could help him look for his cat. He then asked us if we could get in his car and help him find it. I could tell something was off, so we started to yell for our grandma and ran to the house. The guy took off so quick, he was scared shitless. I probably wouldn't be here today if my parents didn't teach me to be leery of strangers. I understand to an extent why parents instill fear into their kids. Who knows how many lives it's saved. Sometimes parents can take it too far to the point where the kid runs off screaming the moment any stranger talks to them or is friendly. Maybe we should teach our kids to trust their intuition and tactics sex offenders use to kidnap children."
UnexpectedThugLife,34xecu,GrayOne,2,Tue May 5 15:18:20 2015 UTC,"Imagine this was your kid(s) getting into that truck, would you just shrug it off and say nothing?  What if you never had a chance to tell your kids not to go anywhere with strangers because of the way you're thinking right now, and they ended up missing one day while you were cleaning the house while they played outside. Do you feel like you should've had that talk?  Absolutely nothing wrong with teaching kids not to do things strangers ask them, or go places that strangers want them to.   Sure sometimes things happen between the kids and people they know, but that is also another conversation entirely. Stranger danger is one of the first step basics of child safety"
UnexpectedThugLife,34xecu,SpeCtruM_SlaYeR,6,Tue May 5 18:05:12 2015 UTC,"My kid logic would be... If the guy has an ice cream truck full of ice cream he's probably a legitimate ice cream man and thus no danger.  If it was some weird looking guy in an old conversion van that was offering free ice cream, that would be different."

UnexpectedThugLife,34xecu,inssein,3,Tue May 5 15:53:18 2015 UTC,"When I was 6 or 7 I used to really enjoy sweeping my grandparents driveway.  They had pine trees around the house and it was oh so satisfying to clear it off.  One day I was sweeping outside while my family was inside and a van pulled up with a young woman and young man.  They told me they lost thier dog and that they needed help finding it.  My mom was always talking to me about stranger danger so I ran screaming into the house.  I remember asking them if they were testing me and telling them that it wasn't funny.  They freaked out a little and ran outside.  The van was gone by then.  I asked multiple times if it was a test and they said it was.  I don't know if they said that because it was or because they needed me to calm down.  I've asked them a few times over the years about it and they maintain that it wasn't a set up and that they have no idea who those people were.  I still think that maybe it was a set up (my mom worked in law enforcement) and that maybe they forgot or didn't tell the family that was there that it was fake.  Regardless of whether it was real or not, it's scared me into believing that it CAN happen and it's worth the conversation of possible scenarios.  My mom had discussed multiple scenarios with me and role-played it with me before.  ""If someone offers you candy, if someone is trying to find thier daughter, if someone says they're friends of Mommy, if someone wants to give you a puppy, if someone is trying to find thier dog..."" If it weren't for those previous conversations I totally would have helped them find thier dog."
UnexpectedThugLife,34xecu,PMmeforRule34ofYou,4,Tue May 5 16:29:46 2015 UTC,"I remember when I was a freshman in high school I was waiting at a bus stop around 5:30 am; I woke up early so I could make it to morning practice before school started. I lived out of the district so I had to wake up super early to make it there on time. One morning I was half asleep standing there in the dark waiting on the bus to come when this car pulls up, in this car is an older man and he says ""hello there, do you by chance know how to get to the highway from here?"" I thought this was strange question the bus stop was on a main road and you could see sign everywhere pointing to the highway, so I said sir the highway is straight down this road you can’t miss it, he said"" oh thank you , what are you doing up so early ?"" I told him I was heading to morning practice and I was waiting on the bus. ""He then said thank you for the help and asked me if I needed a ride to school. Now mind you I was half asleep and started to walk to his car then I like had moment of clarity and remembered about a rapist in the area and then the horror struck me, I told him no thank you and that the bus would be here shortly.  He then started to drive away slowly smiling at me, till this day the look on his face haunts me. The look of almost capturing his pray."

UnexpectedThugLife,348xqh,CounterClockworkOrng,33,Wed Apr 29 12:52:34 2015 UTC,"You can break down the word transvestite to trans and vestite. Trans you can think of as meaning as across or change, vestite you can think of the word vest and this word part usually means clothing or visage (how they look). Transvestite you can derive the meaning of someone who dresses or makes themselves look like someone of the opposite gender.   Transgender on the other hand you can break down in a similar way. People who identify as trans typically identify as the opposite gender. Sometimes they prefer not to be identified as another gender, but in this case I personally prefer to use the term gender queer which is a more abstract, overarching term.  Anyone please feel free to correct me. I don't identify as either, but I have several friends who identify as such."

UnexpectedThugLife,348xqh,GrassSloth,2,Wed Apr 29 15:59:23 2015 UTC,"In the community we typically use ""trans*"" as the overarching term for transvestite, transgender, transsexual, gender queer, etc. Transgender meaning someone who identifies as the other gender, transsexual meaning someone who has transitioned into that other gender, and gender queer meaning someone who identifies with aspects of both genders, or neither gender (also referred to as non-gender binary)."

UnexpectedThugLife,348xqh,SexualPie,2,Wed Apr 29 14:32:05 2015 UTC,"You're close--transgender (not transgendered, since the -ed has other implications) means a person who identifies as a different gender than what they were assigned at birth, transsexual means that they've gone through sex reassignment surgery in order to change their appearance (top/bottom surgery).

I dont give a shit what is in people's pants, and that isnt what should matter anyways; what matters is respecting the wishes of the person in question, and deal with it on a person by person basis.   It is honestly extraordinarily easy.   1) Change your vocabulary to not use her or him, sir and maam - use they and them instead - until the person self-identifies.   2) dont make other assumptions based on gender until a person self-identifies.

You're an absolutely delusional walking talking democrat talking point.  Obama raised income taxes from 35% to 39%, raised capital gains taxes, raised SS taxes. The rich now pay a higher percentage of income tax than at any point in history. More than when the highest marginal rate was 90%.

Because that's the most recent number? I don't think that's selective. It shows the economy is in danger of another recession. The core drivers of economic growth are stalled because of uncertainty in the regulatory world.   What is hilariously selective is to pick the lowest point in a recession measure from there and blame the last president who had very little to do with it. Nevermind the democrats controlled the house and the senate in 2007. Nevermind that Bush went to the housing committee 17 times and asked them to reign in subprimes. Here is a video of Barney Frank telling him No on the house floor in 2005. The economy improved in spite of Obama economic doctrine, not because of it.

Nvm that the new regulation in banking gave the banks an assurance that they'd get bailouts in the future and effectively did nothing.    ...he's president for 8 years. Singling out 1/32 of that makes no sense.   Not sure you understand what GDP growth means. Also the economy hasn't had no respectable growth number that has touched the average growth of the preceding two decades.    Which would be?   High taxes and spending.    No, the stimulus definitely helps.   The stimulus was widely regarded as a miserable failure. Even liberals like Krugman who advocated it just claimed it didn't work because it wasn't big enough. The only place you'll find people claiming it was a success is web site for retards like /r/politics or solon.com.   You are hopelessly outgunned here.

Barack Obama's budget proposals didn't even get 1 vote from his own party for the first 3 years of his presidency? What the fuck are you talking about?    As a net? I'm talking about the wealthy   Lol yes they think you're stupid. Marginal tax rates can be anything they want. Effective tax rates are what people actually pay. When marginal tax rates were high, you could literally deduct 70% of your income and adjusted for inflation the top bracket would by 3.2 million a year. Are you not actually reading these posts? I would gladly pay 90% of 30% of my income on money over 3.2 million dollars. Not 35% on money over 395k. Plus state taxes, SS, myriad of extortionate local taxes. If you're making 1 million dollars in the US, you are going to pay between 46%  and 50% of your income in taxes. 60% if you live in a place like NY or CA. I recently tried to buy a house for 350k but the property taxes were $8,000 a year. Fuck that.    ...but taxes aren't high, historically speaking. Spending isn't that high either--it was just a higher percentage of the GDP for a bit because of the recession   Effective taxes are higher than at any point in history. It's not even debatable.

He has gone from torturing detainees, including US citizens, to straight up assassinating them without trial. He launched a war in Libya in violating of the War Powers Act. He backed up every major autocracy when it crushed democratic revolutions in the Arab world. He continued the Iraq War for 3 more years until the Iraqi public, WikiLeaks, and Iran basically forced him into ending it. He continued and drastically expanded NSA mass surveillance programs while pretending to be for civil liberties. He gutted the healthcare bill of any kind of public option before it was even on the table. He bailed out every major financial institution and gave the handful that received any sort of penalty for their fraud and other misconduct that caused the financial crisis a slap on the wrist, and 0 jailtime. He also refused to hold anyone in the Bush Administration responsible or even investigate their potentially criminal conduct during the Iraq War, and that may itself be a violation of the Convention Against Torture.  I'll give him the Iran diplomacy thing, but again, I think Iran is doing the heavy lifting there.   He is a P.I.M.P. but then again so was this guy. It doesn't mean he is a good policy-maker."

Or maybe just like people hanging out with and dating the people they like and who confer some sort of benefit to them, businesses will do business with the companies they like and with whom doing business is advantageous. That means the ones that are easiest to work with with, who can compliment one another's products, and whom they have the longest history and common interests with (these relationships tend to be the most profitable for both parties).  Nvidia and AMD are doing just fine working with Microsoft and Sony and other players, so they really have no vested interest in working with Linux. At least not a strong enough one. In fact, it would be a bad move, because doing so would weaken the platform they've already invested 99.9% of their R&D into (Windows).  It's nice to think that businesses make decisions based on feelings or warm fuzzy stuff. Being run by humans, sometimes they do. But for the most part, business decisions are based only on logic and the most advantageous decision at the time given the information available at the time. Schemes are rarely ever involved, because scheming and plotting is too risky. Nvidia will start making more of an effort to support Linux development the instant there is more of a payoff and it becomes a more advantageous position for the company.  Linux's problem is that it's not a for-profit gig, so it has no vested interest in getting Nvidia or AMD to work with it. No one is really making an effort at it, outside of small developers and folks like Valve. This may change as Nvidia is pushing out their own hardware platform(s) and trying to enter the home entertainment market in the living room. But for now, this is how it is."

This would simply be solved if NVidia helped development on the open source NVidia driver nouveau. But they don't, and the open source driver is just plain bad.   AMD does the same thing with their proprietary drivers, except they also help the community improve their open source drivers. The open source AMD drivers are actually better than their proprietary counterparts. (Not that that means they're very good, they just work. And the proprietary drivers are absolutely horrible.)"

AMD's best preforming drivers are open sourced, but they're WAY behind NVIDIA's performance level.  With a properly ported game, NVIDIA is on par or better with their Winderp$ version of the drivers, but AMD is still getting about 1/2 - 3/4's the performance that card would normally get on Winderp$."

On the other hand, C is middle ground between low level and high level languages, and you'll find yourself dealing with memory management and bare-bones data structures. It gives the experienced programmer vast control over what he can do, but the price is verbosity and skillful resource management, not to mention a decent knowledge of how computers handle stuff ""internally"".  High level languages such as Python (or, to name a couple, Java and C#) tend to be friendlier and have lots of syntactic sugar to make stuff more readable, but they often showcase elements from many different programming paradigms (Object Oriented Programming, Event-Driven Programming, Functional Programming, etc.), which can be overwhelming to someone just starting out. They also tend to hide some of the more low-level aspects of C with nice layers of abstraction, which make code both easier to follow and manage, but also slightly less versatile and fast (to put it simply, each layer of abstraction decreases the performance a bit). They also tend to the manage memory for you (via garbage collection), and while that takes a huge load off your shoulders, it also limits your range of choices when it comes to optimization.  In the end, there are two things to be said:   You don't choose a language based on how it looks, but rather, on what you need it for. C and C++ are better where performance and portability (even to embedded systems) is required, but not as much for general purpose programming. I'll still underline that C is never a bad choice, because of how much you can learn from it, but you'll probably find yourself using some other language for your day-to-day projects. Learning many languages and coding practices is as important as mastering a single language because it greatly improves your general view, and because you'll have something to fall back on as soon as your requirements change."

UnexpectedThugLife,33ybgf,doldrim,61,Sun Apr 26 21:07:15 2015 UTC,Linus Torvalds is the creator of Linux and also is still the head honcho for maintaining the Linux kernel.  This was during a Q&A and Linus was responding to a question an attendee asked (I can't quite remember the question at the moment).  He was talking about device / driver support and more or less says that NVidia has been one of the worst companies to work with because they don't give anything to open source community to use to help with open source graphics drivers.  So he says fuck you and flips them off.

UnexpectedThugLife,33lwuz,darwinianfacepalm,14,Thu Apr 23 18:21:05 2015 UTC,"But they butchered one of the best lines in all of the books.. ""Only Cat"" is so much more powerful."
UnexpectedThugLife,33lwuz,BroomSIR,20,Thu Apr 23 21:32:26 2015 UTC,It was fine how it was in the show. The tv show isn't supposed to be a direct dramatization of the books and the showrunners change things to make it better and easier to follow.
UnexpectedThugLife,33lwuz,choldslingshot,-4,Fri Apr 24 00:38:34 2015 UTC,"to make it better and easier to follow   Cutting the really good shit doesn't make it better.  Where are Victarion, Euron, Strong Belwas, Aeron, Quentyn and so many more?"
UnexpectedThugLife,33lwuz,BroomSIR,-3,Fri Apr 24 08:01:51 2015 UTC,I haven't read the books so I don't care about these characters. I would rather have the show flesh out already established characters instead of wasting time with unimportant side characters when there is a very limited amount of time that the show has. The show could easily be twice as long without adding in anymore characters.
UnexpectedThugLife,33lwuz,ronter95,2,Sat Apr 25 23:26:07 2015 UTC,Strong Belwas  Unimportant side characters   Fuck you
UnexpectedThugLife,33lwuz,choldslingshot,3,Sun Apr 26 22:10:10 2015 UTC,I wholeheartedly disagree with you in every way.  Edit: Also important to note that these are not unimportant characters.  It's like saying that Gimli was unimportant overall.
UnexpectedThugLife,33lwuz,BroomSIR,-6,Sun Apr 26 01:43:53 2015 UTC,"There already isn't enough screentime for existing characters and you want to add more that aren't essential to the story? All of the big main characters are in the show, not comparable at all to Gimli. Also, if Gimlis and Legolas's on screen chemistry didn't work then he wouldn't be missed."
UnexpectedThugLife,33lwuz,choldslingshot,3,Sun Apr 26 01:55:50 2015 UTC,"Considering you haven't read the books, you don't really have firm ground to stand on saying that all big main characters are in the show.  They cut a massive one the minute they had Varys choosing to support Dany instead."
UnexpectedThugLife,33lwuz,BroomSIR,-5,Sun Apr 26 01:58:20 2015 UTC,Do you not realize that GoT the show isn't the same as ASOIAF? GoT is based on the source material and not a line by line depiction of the books. GRRM makes mistakes in his writing that can be corrected in the show.
UnexpectedThugLife,33lwuz,choldslingshot,3,Sun Apr 26 02:01:06 2015 UTC,"Wait you're saying GRRM is the one making the mistakes, and not D&D? That doesn't really feel like a legitimate argument, and especially not one for you to make having never read the books.  That's like criticizing a song without ever actually hearing it.  Point 1: They cut out basically the entire Greyjoy family.  You know Theon's relatives that are another major family in Westeros.  In the books Theon's uncles are really important.  In the show Stannis casts a leech on the fire for Balon Greyjoy.  Motherfucker's still alive on the show because they just decided not to cover them at all.  Currently Theon's uncles are both waging war against the Tyrells and sending a massive ship army to go help Dany.  Point 2:  Varys was supposed to support Aegon.  There's another Targaryen claimant to the throne other than Dany, and that's going to be huge in the next book.  Like full on war huge.  I could go on and on, but I'd just belabor the point.  It's clear you like the show.  It's a great show, but that doesn't mean it comes anywhere close to the depth, rich story material that it draws upon.  D&D's decision to both cut great characters, important storylines, while inventing bullshit as well is not something I'm a fan of at all."
UnexpectedThugLife,33lwuz,BroomSIR,2,Sun Apr 26 02:08:11 2015 UTC,Considering we're both posting on an internet forum for this tv show we are pretty invested in it and worry about the details of this show. But most casual watchers don't give a shit about fan theories and show related content and just want an easy(ish) show to follow. If you miss one episode you pretty much can't continue watching.
UnexpectedThugLife,33lwuz,BroomSIR,2,Fri Apr 24 03:39:04 2015 UTC,What the fuck kind of crazy world are you living in? The show should be written for the largest audience that will make HBO the most money. Money is what drives shows like GOT to be even made. No one pays to watch GOT anyways.
UnexpectedThugLife,33lwuz,BroomSIR,0,Fri Apr 24 03:45:01 2015 UTC,Not really. Netflix provides the funding for a run of the mill production studio to make and produce a tv show. Any show that would be sucessful on netflix would be just as successful on cable. HoC for example.
UnexpectedThugLife,33lwuz,James_Locke,3,Fri Apr 24 03:54:13 2015 UTC,Except they had not referred to her as Cat in the show.

UnexpectedThugLife,33lwuz,Obamanomicon_,23,Thu Apr 23 22:50:03 2015 UTC,I felt like realizing Cat was Catelyn in the show would be easier than remembering Lysa was her sister.

My advice, just go through in order, but check the IMDB ratings of individual episodes before watching. They are usually pretty accurate. Skip the crummy ones, watch the good ones, and watch anything that sounds good to you (avoid reading too much of the plot.)   S1 is by far the weakest. Absolutely wonderful series."

I'll give you another example:  When the Soviet Union existed, it was a union of various republics, or countries.  (Russia, Ukraine, Georgia, etc.)  However, throughout the existence of the Soviet Union, it was common to refer to it as Russia.  Why?  Because Russia was the dominant republic of the Soviet Union.

Not always, sometimes we'd say the Soviet Union or Soviets, but often we all said Russia or Russian.  Same thing with England and the UK.

UnexpectedThugLife,32yw37,theB1ackSwan,3,Sat Apr 18 15:22:18 2015 UTC,"Groland:       Groland (full name: Presipality of Groland, French : Présipauté du Groland) is a fictional country featured in various humorous programs on French television channel Canal+. It is a vague parody of France and of European microstates. The show associated with the country is Made in Groland, Also known, for the older version as : Groland Sat, 7 Jours au Groland (7 Days in Groland) Bienvenue au Groland. (Welcome to Groland) Groland Magazine, Groland.con.  The landlocked nation is described as a ‘presipality’ (a neologism made from ""principality"" and ""president""), and its main regions are: Upper Groland (le Groland-du-Haut), Side Groland (le Groland-de-Côté), Lower Groland (le Groland-du-bas), and Other Side Groland (Groland-de-l'Autre-Côté). The capital is Groville, the main river is the Gro, and the main prefectures are Grugny, Mufflins, Maroufle and Vichumes. The placenames, certain elements of Grolandais speech (e.g. the use of ""ch'"" instead of ""le"" or ""la""), and the generally crass and unintelligent character of the Grolandais themselves, reflect popular stereotypes about rural northern France. Groland has the distinction of having a border with every country in the world.  The motto of the country is Joie, hospitalité, lâcheté (""Joy, hospitality, cowardice""). The country remained neutral during World War I, and was famous for being a haven for soldiers on leave, with its cheap alcohol and prostitutes. During World War II, the country's leadership collaborated with the Nazi occupier; the government engaged in policies of persecution and deportation of Jews and homosexuals. After American troops liberated the country, a sudden change of mood happened, and alleged former collaborators were murdered.    Image i - Some French car owners show their devotion to the TV program by using this emblem as a rear car tag, as if their vehicle was registered in Groland.

It is listed as Least Concern by the IUCN on account of its widespread range and large numbers estimated between 27,000 and 47,000 individuals.  The species is however experiencing declines outside of protected areas due to habitat loss and poaching.  The species may have originated in Asia,  and once ranged throughout Europe for at least one million years until the end of the Late Pleistocene.  The spotted hyena is the largest member of the Hyaenidae, and is further physically distinguished from other species by its vaguely bear-like build,  its rounded ears,  its less prominent mane, its spotted pelt,  its more dual purposed dentition,  its fewer nipples  and the presence of a pseudo-penis in the female. It is the only mammalian species to lack an external vaginal opening.     Image i     Interesting: Hyena | Clitoris | Kitengela | Cave hyena   Parent commenter can toggle NSFW or delete.

UnexpectedThugLife,3286e2,ControlBear,8,Sun Apr 12 07:37:44 2015 UTC,"The alchemist picked up a book that someone in the caravan had brought. Leafing through the pages, he found a story about Narcissus.  The alchemist knew the legend of Narcissus, a youth who knelt daily beside a lake to contemplate his own beauty. He was so fascinated by himself that, one morning, he fell into the lake and drowned. At the spot where he fell, a flower was born, which was called the narcissus.  But this was not how the author of the book ended the story.  He said that when Narcissus died, the goddesses of the forest appeared and found the lake, which had been fresh water, transformed into a lake of salty tears.  'Why do you weep?' the goddesses asked.  'I weep for Narcissus,"" the lake replied.  'Ah, it is no surprise that you weep for Narcissus,' they said, 'for though we always pursued him in the forest, you alone could contemplate his beauty close at hand.'  'But... was Narcissus beautiful?' the lake asked.  'Who better than you to know that?' the goddesses asked in wonder. 'After all, it was by your banks that he knelt each day to contemplate himself!'  The lake was silent for some time. Finally, it said:  'I weep for Narcissus, but I never noticed that Narcissus was beautiful. I weep because, each time he knelt beside my banks, I could see, in the depths of his eyes, my own beauty reflected.'  'What a lovely story,' the alchemist thought.  Paulo Coelho, The Alchemist"

As soon as I see her, I know I'm not going to give her a pass like every other douche bag she has come across, e.g. smoking hot chick equals automatic ticket, no breaks.  So I take her information, walk back to may car, and write out the ticket.  When I walk back up, I notice that her tits are almost falling out of her top now.  Her shorts are pulled up so tight against her crotch, I can see what day she was born on.  When I tell her to sign the ticket, she is completely surprised that ""I"" would be giving ""her"" a ticket.  Her psuedo-tears were delicious."

UnexpectedThugLife,31x7r5,745631258978963214,1 point,Thu Apr 9 03:59:23 2015 UTC,"Seems reasonable in my opinion.  All signing does is essentially have a weak paper trail showing suggesting that the person was indeed around when the ticket was given.   Without the signature, a cop can simply spam fake tickets out and then give out warrants without pulling people over.  Likewise, the ticketed person might claim that he never received a ticket and waste court time.    At least with forced signatures, if a cop makes up a signature, he could be liable for identity fraud (I'm guessing), which is not something he'd like to be sued for if he's faking signatures.  Besides, in my state at least, a signature doesn't ""admit guilt""; it just means ""yeah, I'm the guy that was driving when the cop wrote the ticket""."

UnexpectedThugLife,31x7r5,slimmtl,1 point,Thu Apr 9 09:44:49 2015 UTC,"That would imply that she would have to break a law of some sort, which would actually lead to lawsuits against the city, since most laws are designed for safety.  That is, something as simple as a broken taillight is still technically for safety and could lead to an accident.  Even an overdue inspection (while technically not grounds for being pulled over, I think) is technically a danger, as it means the car might not be functioning properly, though I guess they could inspect it before a sting operation and just not issue it..."

Well according to the dictionary.com one has to be a vicious ruffian robber or murderer to be a thug, and in the countless videos I've watched I haven't seen even one real thug action, does this mean that none of these videos belong here? No.  Maybe the sub isn't going downhill, maybe your idea of what this sub is isn't meeting the expectation you're setting for it, this is a community and last time i checked there aren't any rules about what can be posted other than;  ""If you see a video you don't think belongs here, please report it so the mods can look at it.""

UnexpectedThugLife,30rzvi,ksobby,12,Fri Apr 10 16:46:23 2015 UTC,I had to look it up.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rake_(character)
UnexpectedThugLife,30rzvi,JuanPabloElSegundo,12,Mon Mar 30 14:51:24 2015 UTC,"Rake (character):       A rake, short for rakehell (analogous to ""hellraiser""), is a historic term applied to a man who is habituated to immoral conduct, particularly womanising. Often a rake was also prodigal who wasted his (usually inherited) fortune on gambling, wine, women and song, incurring lavish debts in the process. Comparable terms are ""libertine"" and ""debauchee"".  The Restoration rake was a carefree, witty, sexually irresistible aristocrat whose heyday was during the English Restoration period (1660–1688) at the court of Charles II. They were typified by the ""Merry gang"" of courtiers, who included as prominent members the Earl of Rochester; George Villiers, 2nd Duke of Buckingham; and the Earl of Dorset, who combined riotous living with intellectual pursuits and patronage of the arts. At this time the rake featured as a stock character in Restoration comedy.     After the reign of Charles II, and especially after the Glorious Revolution of 1688, the cultural perception of the rake took a dive into squalor. The rake became the butt of moralistic tales in which his typical fate was debtor's prison, venereal disease, or, in the case of William Hogarth's A Rake's Progress, insanity in Bedlam.

UnexpectedThugLife,30r5wx,Arkaega,22,Mon Mar 30 01:46:22 2015 UTC,Yep. Happens with every thing that goes viral at some point. We don't control it. :)
UnexpectedThugLife,30r5wx,jim45804,84,Mon Mar 30 02:05:46 2015 UTC,Wat.  Quality control needs to get under control here first. I don't think there's any demand out there for unexpected thug pics but I wish you luck in proving me wrong.
UnexpectedThugLife,30r5wx,Ghant_,92,Mon Mar 30 01:43:32 2015 UTC,"I see this message tons of times. I'll tell you what I reply every time as well.  You have to understand that we remove a dozen or more submissions a day. That is complete shit we spare for you to see. Yes, even worse than what you see come through here. You're welcome. We do this free of charge for you.  Now, you also have to understand that since the Unexpected Thug Life thing went viral, there has been sites, Facebook pages, YouTube Channels (we ban tons of people abusing Reddit's self promotion rules and flooding the subreddit) all trying to cash in on it, creating tons of new material.  Material that usually can't be forced, but they do. And thus it comes out as shit because they force it. It's a thing that should come natural, and sadly, it's rare to see a good vid be made that comes through here. That's just how it is.  That's just how every viral thing works. It gains traction and everyone wants in on it. We cannot guarantee you high class content every single day, because guess what, we don't make it. We're just a gateway for people to submit their links. We cannot control what comes through here. We can only filter it.  I get it's incredibly easy to blame Moderators on Reddit, but most of the time they can't do shit on what comes through their subreddits.   We actually tried amping up our quality control. What followed were zero new entries in two days. Because that's what happens if we would do it your way. And then we get an increase in people complaining there's no content on the subreddit. See what happens? People always complain the (free) work we do. That's how it is.  So either apply to be a Moderator on here and share your ideas and work hard, or enjoy and hope for a good (free) submission once in a while. Or unsubscribe, because that option is there as well, and nobody will hate you for doing so.  And as the for the /r/UnexpectedThugPics thing, we made it because it simply wasn't there yet and because some other people complained we didn't allow images on here. Lots of complaining as you can see, doesn't matter if we do stuff or don't do stuff. In the end it's still free entertainment for you.   Bookwork reply, sorry, but I'll use this to direct other posts to this as well, thanks."

Even 50 out of 187.000 complain, those are good odds. Doesn't matter where you go, most comment sections on the larger subs will be filled with complaints. It's because complaints gain the most attention. Just check the cesspool that is /r/pics or /r/funny.   This doesn't mean we don't take it seriously however, but I just literally explained how it works on the subreddit. If you have any ideas, feel free to message the mods. We seriously love your ideas that you have how to improve!"
UnexpectedThugLife,30r5wx,gothgar,-2,Mon Mar 30 13:13:11 2015 UTC,I also think you guys should be more selective even though it means less content. Just because few subscribers are complaining doesn't mean the silent ones aren't thinking the same thing.
UnexpectedThugLife,30r5wx,Jesse402,-1,Mon Mar 30 16:18:24 2015 UTC,"We know the moderators remove hundreds of submissions a day, and we are thankful for that.  We need a moderation team to stop spam, stop self-promoting and making sure the subreddit remains a friendly environment.  However, it doesn't change that the quality of content has decreased on this sub.  There is no suprise that the quality and quantity of videos have a direct relation.  You try to enforce moderation, realise that it means there was no suitable entries for 2 days, and so you give up and fling the doors open again?  That's not how quality control should work.  If you were less concerned about how active the subreddit was, and more concerned about the quality of it, we would all see a vast improvement I'm sure.  It is not a competition to be the most popular subreddit.    The meme is not dying, but your userbase and quality content creators have turned away because all they see is tens upon tens of generic cheap attempts flooding this subreddit every day.  A lot of good quality videos are buried because of the quantity of crap that is upvoted by alts out the bat and raised to the front page of this subreddit.  People can, have, and will continue to unsubcribe because they think this place has lost its quality. I know I've gone from visiting this page daily to closer to twice a week. You will continue to get new subscribers who didn't know how high the quality used to be, and so will continue to enjoy the barrage of crap that is flung at them.  I think your post makes it clear you are more interesting in quantity than quality, especially considering you're actively trying to promote a new subreddit and get as many on the bandwagon as possible.  That's fine, like you say none of this really matters to anybody anyway, it's all just for a little bit of entertainment.  But the complaints remained justified and I wouldn't expect them to disappear when you admit you aren't making any current attempt to improve quality.     We cannot guarantee you high class content every single day, because guess what, we don't make it.   Then try and guarantee us just high class content, and we won't expect a new front page every day.  Coming here daily to rewatch that funny video from 4 days ago is better than coming here and seeing a page full of mediocre content that I'll have no intention of ever seeing again.  You say you get a complaint about their being no new contect, but I don't remember any sticked posts about a change in quality control.  I would at least recommend trying it again before starting an ""[Official] This Sub is Dead RIP!  Join us at /r/xyz!"".  Because nothing is going to make this place empty faster than by telling your subscribers that you don't think enough people care anymore so the rest of us may as well go."
UnexpectedThugLife,30r5wx,Ikarus3426,3,Mon Mar 30 14:27:08 2015 UTC,"I appreciate your long written reply.  However, i'm just a guy like you, who made a subreddit about Unexpected Thugs. It's a subreddit. A site. Online. With free entertainment. We are doing the best we can with removing bad submissions and spammers that violate the self promotion rule.  Also, i'm not going to lie to you and pretend we're top notch fancy awesome and sexy and that the meme is strong. Fuck no. Viral things die out after a while and its userbase will turn on it the bigger it gets. It happens. It's a fact. We have to deal with that.   The /r/UnexpectedThugPics thing was just an extra, and people seem to like it so far. Good for them.   And yes. People can unsubscribe if they want to. It's not the end of the world. It's about watching videos, that's literally all it is. I'm not going to lie to you, or pretend, or suck up to you so you please stay. Hell no. It needs to stay fun for me as well.   Again, we're not getting paid to do this. We have no obligation to you by contract, but we do like helping other people out and help them provide some laughter.   I also invite you to become a Mod. We need some fresh blood, and you seem passionate enough to type a bookwork just like I did.  Funny thing is that people loudly complain in comments that they don't like it (where everyone can see them), but we never get personal Mod messages with helpful advice on how to improve, or offers to join as a Mod to make a change.  So if you want change, you're welcome to join us. Or unsubscribe. Free will and all that. Nobody will hate you if you do. :)"
UnexpectedThugLife,30r5wx,kylebyrne,2,Mon Mar 30 15:21:17 2015 UTC,"So I just did another longwinded reply and then my works software crashed IE, so apologies if this doesn't quite make sense, but basically what I said was;  I've had a quick look and it looks like of the few moderators there is, only a handful of you are actually active on Reddit, let alone active moderating this sub.  I wouldn't expect 4 or 5 people to be able to supervise 180,000+ under any circumstances, especially not on an anonymous forum, so props for the work done to date.  I would actually consider being a moderator because I think that there is still potential in this subreddit.  But I'm sure if you advised the sub you were looking for new moderators and asked them to fill out a short application, you would find amongst the 180,000 subscribers at least a couple of Redditors who have experience in managing other successful subs.  We aren't the only people who care about quality and want to do something worthwhile with our time.  I think it may also be worth having an open discussion with the community as a whole regarding what it is exactly that people expect from this subreddit.  You clearly do a lot of work in the background which we aren't seeing, so some regular communication about what problems the mods have been having recently, and what the community wants to see from the sub, I think would help improve the user experience.    I like the pics and have subbed anyway, but I don't think it will ever get as popular as this place, so no need to let it kick the bucket just yet.  There is always going to be thugs in unexpected places, and as long as this community exists, there will always be a home for the videos.  There was something else I mentioned ... but I really can't remember now ...  edit;  Oh yeah.  You obviously are doing a lot of work behind the scenes which we do appreciate, so maybe if you held regular discussion with the community about what kind of problems the moderation team are dealing with at the moment, and at the same time give the community a chance to provide feedback on the sub, there would be a ""coming together"" so to speak, and both the mods and the userbase will hopefully become happier with the way things are working out.  I appreciate how you probably can't be bothered to do this after spending so much time removing content, so perhaps new moderators to help you out would be the best thing."

UnexpectedThugLife,30itd3,meandertothehorizon,1 point,Tue Apr 7 21:20:00 2015 UTC,I feel like this is what you get when you make a subreddit for everything. Instead of enjoying the random naturally occurring unexpected thug life - you form a breeding ground where people compete to find any and all videos matching the pattern. This works pretty well right away but once the good ones are exhausted people start to reach and eventually everything is muddied beyond recognition and once again we've driven a meme horse into the ground.

UnexpectedThugLife,2zs5gj,jmillerworks,30,Sat Mar 21 17:46:52 2015 UTC,That's a great way to describe Fred Rogers. He was a class act. Check his Senate testimony in favor of funding for PBS in 1969. The world lost something when it lost Fred Rogers.

UnexpectedThugLife,2zs5gj,mlsoccer2,8,Mon May 11 17:24:14 2015 UTC,"Thank you for posting this, I hadn't seen it and am a big fan of Fred Rogers. It was great to see someone lobbying for funding not to make a buck or sell something or find a way to sell something to children. The man dedicated his life to helping children assimilate to this sometimes frightening place called Earth. So much programming seems devoid of any message besides going for a cheap laugh.   It never felt like pandering, he genuinely wanted to help. If someone acted like this today, the pedo jokes would fly, and he would be suspect. I just hope we haven't gone so far as a society to never produce another Fred Rogers.   Things seem so far out of control lately, many suffer at the hands of angry men. If only those men could have learned from this man when they were still scared and angry little boys."

UnexpectedThugLife,2zngac,jimmyjazz2000,44,Fri Mar 20 10:55:10 2015 UTC,"This is often called the ""wrong ball"" trick. Just before the play begins, coach yells to his team from the sideline, ""Hey, wait, you have the wrong ball!"" Center hands the ball to the quarterback, and the quarterback walks to the sidelines to supposedly switch balls. (The trick is that this constitutes a legal snap, and a live play is now in process without the defense doing any defending.) When he gets close to the sidelines, away from the defense, he just sprints down the sideline to the endzone for an easy score. In this case, instead of saying, ""wrong ball"", I think the coach yelled, ""ball's in the wrong spot,"" or claimed there was some kind of penalty. The quarterback took the ball, and appeared to be marching off a 10-yard penalty. Same punchline, though, once he got clear of the defense, he took off.  It's a shitty trick play that only works on little kids, and is only taught by asshole coaches who want to win at all costs, and make it all about themselves instead of the players. I truly hate this play, and the jerk coaches who teach it. It's been made illegal on almost every level of the game, but they still get away with it now and then at the little kid level, mostly because the referees are usually 14-year-old kids."

We spend all this time teaching them to respect the game and have good sportsmanship yet they get thrown these trick plays that take advantage of that. the only reason the defense let him go like that is because they didn't immediately assume ill-will.

UnexpectedThugLife,2zngac,eggsovereazy,17,Tue Mar 24 00:17:50 2015 UTC,Normally when a play starts the center (guy who starts with the ball) hands the ball between his legs to the quarterback (guy who ran with the ball) in this case the quarterback pretended he didn't know what play to call and acted like he was walking to the sideline  to talk to the coach. When he did this the center handed him the ball over his shoulder which is still a legal hike (start of a play) but kids at that level don't always know that.
UnexpectedThugLife,2zngac,antici________potato,6,Fri Mar 20 13:19:40 2015 UTC,"Right idea, wrong play. He didn't act like he didn't know what play to run. It was the kid saying that they had the wrong ball and was acting like they were going to switch it out."

UnexpectedThugLife,2zngac,WentoX,3,Fri Mar 20 11:30:15 2015 UTC,I'm guessing they thought someone called a timeout or something they missed.

The thing that makes this play work is the offensive lineman not getting set into 3 point stance. .. but there's nothing illegal about that hike.

This manual covers exceptions to the High School Rules only. Unsportsmanlike Conduct is not one of the exceptions and is covered in the Federation Rule Book under 9.5.1b: Any action or verbiage used to deceive the defense into thinking that the ball is not about to become live is illegal. Acting like you need a new ball or have the wrong ball or are missing the kicking tee are all illegal under this rule if the ball is snapped during said baloney.

A total of 595 episodes were taped at CFTO-TV in Toronto, Ontario. It was hosted by Stephen Young during the show's first season, but from the second season on, it was hosted by the husband-and-wife duo of Fergie Olver and the show's creator Catherine Swing. Dave Devall announced the series for its entire run. The format was to determine which child and mother knew each other the best through answer-matching as well as the memorable Bake-off Challenge. Three teams, consisting of a young child and his or her mother (or occasionally father), competed on each episode. Repeats aired on GameTV from 2008 to 2010.

Votes can easily be toyed with, and misinterpreted considering you DONT have to be a part of the community to vote on a post. Seriously ignore that fact, that's okay. And sure enough if 2,000 retarded geese smash the keyboard and get it to the top it is most definitely not a good post.   As well a vote does NOT = good. A vote could be accidental, it could mean this has a lot of votes and upvoted without even watching, it could mean it's your cake day so I'll upvote, it could mean I have cerebral palsy and upvoted everything, it could mean I'm in a good mood and upvoted everything regardless of it's quality, it could mean anything.

Let me just repeat the facts because this is getting old:   If you post content that matches the sub description, then you've contributed to Reddit positively. You wanna make Reddit better, post better content yourself.   And your second paragraph. Wow. Just wow. Claiming that a voting system isn't a good way to measure popularity and then you say I have retarded logic.  Go on, write back again, I could do with a laugh.

How on earth do you think they are mutually exclusive?   And what about my second paragraph? Lol you live in a fantasy world where voting is perfect? All the things I stated could easily occur and not represent the communities views. Seriously you've never come across a thread where there's hundreds of upvotes but hundreds of comment sayin it's crap? Cuz ppl pass thru and upvote anything funny without thought. Your little fetish for voting is lame af. And your edits of the upvotes are mediocre and only show how you don't hesitant to bend over backwards to the negative progression that is a large population boom in subreddits. Foolish behavior"

IMO, If you're asking someone to marry you, and you're afraid that they won't say yes, that means you're not ready as a couple for marriage. Marriage isn't a one-way street, nor is initiating one. Conversation is needed, you both need to know that marriage is what you want.  The HOW of the proposal is the surprising and romantic part, not that you proposed."

I see the effects of the constriction being somewhat mitigated with a larger one, but the article I linked even mentions if you've held a small one it is bizarre sensation because there is pressure exerted from them holding on, even when they aren't trying to kill, eat, defend.
