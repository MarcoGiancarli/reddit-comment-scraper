WarplanePorn,3c3z1p,Moofies,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:30:39 2015 UTC,I always thought that it took a while to get all of those aircraft up from something like an Nimitz class. You would be refueling the first 1/3 of the carriers compliment by the time the last launched I imagine. I know the F-14's had enough trouble going up with (4) AIM-54's for super extended periods of time and the bug has much shorter legs.
WarplanePorn,3c3vpv,silence_hr,6,Sat Jul 4 14:54:50 2015 UTC,"Any more progress on these in the last few months? Interesting planes. I'm even more interested to see what India changes about it in the FGFA version, which is supposed to be better in stealth and a lot of other areas. The stealth could use an improvement if the 0.5mm2 RCS is right."
WarplanePorn,3c3vpv,ShaidarHaran2,6,Sat Jul 4 18:43:15 2015 UTC,"Russia just massively reduced its T-50 order and will be getting only a single squadron.   You can imagine that move doesn't exactly instill confidence in the solid future of the project with their Indian partners.  The Russians will be getting cheaper Su-35s, instead."
WarplanePorn,3c3vpv,DhulKarnain,5,Sat Jul 4 19:14:13 2015 UTC,"Yeah, plus Russia selling SU-30s and soon SU-35s to China, and attack helicopters to Pakistan. I know they need a quick buck right now, but India can't be happy about any of this. If they want India pushed to European and American jets, they're doing all the right things. India is their biggest importer, not a great idea.    Me, I'd honestly just cut the money from the Pak fa and Rafale, get the F35 and be done with it. Negative publicity from armchair critics aside, at least it's a finished, datalinked, stealthy fifth gen platform. Focus on the Tejas for the low end cheap fighter, F35 to project power everywhere it's needed. Nothing China or Pakistan have could counter that for a long time."
WarplanePorn,3c3vpv,ShaidarHaran2,3,Sat Jul 4 19:25:18 2015 UTC,"I think it's more likely we'll see another EU fighter in Indian inventory than the F-35, but that's just my personal opinion in light of how the Eurofighter Consortium kept up a strong presence in India for all this time even though they lost the MRCA competition. I figure India and the US are just not that close an allies yet for a transfer of such a delicate piece of military technology as the F-35.  The EF Consortium were also very quick to offer up a new Typhoon deal after India gave up on going through with the MRCA Rafale order.   Do you have any info or opinion on how the Tejas stacks up against the JF-17 (which made quite a positive impact in this year's Paris Air Show)?"
WarplanePorn,3c3vpv,DhulKarnain,4,Sat Jul 4 19:40:30 2015 UTC,"It's possible, the problem with the Typhoon is that you'd have to talk to every country in the Eurofighter consortium, in case one of them decided they didn't want to ship it to India in a war. With the Rafale, it's just France, and France has been pretty good about continuing to ship things to India in wartimes. Plus, the Typhoon and Rafale are so similar and trade blows in so many areas, having two different ones doesn't make sense to me, if they got more I'd think it would be more Rafales.    You're right about the F35 being a touchy export, but while there certainly would be no transfer of technology (there never is with the States), I think America did express some enthusiasm at opening up to shipping it to India after the F-18 was kicked out of MRCA.    I suspect JF-17 vs Tejas would be like a mini version of Rafale vs F35. One is a plane for today, one is a plane for tomorrow. The Rafale can outfly the F35 within visual range, but the F35 would go undetected for much longer, and have a more advanced radar to guide missiles to an enemy craft. Same thing I think would happen with JF-17 vs Tejas, the JF-17 may be kinematically superior, but the largely carbon body and low size of the Tejas allow a much lower radar return, and it will also have the more advanced radars in the MK2 form (MK1 isn't very appealing). Failing that, the Tejas will have helmet mounted targeting and off-boresight missiles, so it can fire missiles at an enemy without the plane having to point at them.  So plane of today, plane of tomorrow, Rafale/JF-17, F35/Tejas. Not that they're comparable, just that the situation would be similar.    And besides all that, the situations aren't comparable - the JF-17 (along with the F16) are Pakistans premier fighters, whereas the Tejas follows behind the future Pak Fa/FGFA, Rafale, SU-30MKIs, so it's their low end fighter, that's comparable to Pakistans high end fighter.    Phew, I wrote a novel there! I like planes, ok!"
WarplanePorn,3c3vpv,ShaidarHaran2,5,Sat Jul 4 19:51:26 2015 UTC,"So, to recap, India is really in a bind. The AF is under tremendous pressure to phase out old flying coffins (MiG-21s and 27s) and we learned today that they need at least 80 Rafale-type fighters soon, like yesterday soon, if they hope to maintain parity with China and Pakistan. The AF feels the heat and wants solutions NOW.   The FGFA deal with the Russians is by all accounts in the toilet, after India invested huge amounts of cash to prop up Russian air industry whilst getting fucking nothing in return. With the Russian economy hit by EU-US sanctions much more than they're ready to admit, I'd wager there will be no PAK FAs on Indian skies in the next 5-10 years, if ever.  The F-35 is practically out of reach, the closest American allies like the UK and Israel only just started receiving first jets and even if India inked a deal today it would take at least half a decade for the first Indian F-35s to fly. Also important thing to take into account is the adverse reaction that an eventual F-35 sale to India would have in China. Would the Yanks be willing to upset China just to help India? Hmm.. And seeing how Indians already made their bed when they partnered up with Russia, chances for this deal are way low (Who knows how many agents have the Russians planted in the Indian aerospace sector during the FGFA collaboration that would now have access to sensitive F-35 components? - Hard to believe Americans would take those chances).  The low end of the spectrum is covered by the Tejas, but at the high end the only realistic options for them are, as you say, the Rafale and the Typhoon.  However, seeing how ridiculously diverse and difficult to maintain the logistics chain in the Indian AF is already and the relative parity between the two European fighters the most obvious choice for India would, in fact, be to stick with Dassault 'till the end.  BUT, India dropped the MRCA and reduced the Rafale order from 126 to 36 units! Was that a ploy to reneg a better deal or what?  Their actions really make no sense from a strategic viewpoint.  I'm affraid that, in the end, India might have tried to sit on too many chairs and will end up with its ass in the air once the music stops."
WarplanePorn,3c3vpv,DhulKarnain,5,Sat Jul 4 20:13:00 2015 UTC,"Indias doctrine is definitely confusing. The spread of jets they have is pretty non-unified in comparison to other countries. I don't know of another airforce that splits things into heavy, medium, and light fighters, and insists on having all three.    Those MIG-21s definitely needed to go, like, last decade. A pilot even sued the Indian government in a right to life case, making the case of their really bad record.    The gap in their power was why Modi ordered 36 Rafales in an immediate Government to Government deal, knowing there wasn't time to keep negotiating for a transfer of tech for all of them. Though, that probably hurt their negotiating position for the rest of them.    The Rafale is a brilliant plane imo, if they end up getting near the original 126 they wanted that would be a pretty good deterrent power. They could always get more SU-30MKIs, but those seem like they perpetually have half the fleet grounded for repairs.   But they need to cover their butts for a fifth gen fighter eventually too, with the J20 and J31 looming (though Chinas engines and stealth coatings and radars/avionics may not be up to snuff for fifth gen, though again it could be good enough to beat 4++ gen planes like the Rafale).   Russia did shorten the first delivery of the first Indianized Pak Fa to 36 months, I'll be curious to see what India thinks of it at that point."

WarplanePorn,3br2j5,llamabomb,1 point,Thu Jul 2 05:06:16 2015 UTC,"Linear Aerospike SR-71 Experiment:       LASRE was NASA's Linear Aerospike SR-71 Experiment which took place at the Dryden Flight Research Center at Edwards Air Force Base, California, until November 1998. The experiment sought to provide flight data to help Lockheed Martin validate and tune the computational predictive tools used to determine the aerodynamic performance of the Lockheed Martin X-33 lifting body and linear aerospike engine combination and to lay groundwork for a future reusable launch vehicle.   LASRE was a small, half-span model of the X-33's lifting body with eight thrust cells of an aerospike engine, rotated 90 degrees and mounted on the back of an Lockheed SR-71 Blackbird aircraft, to operate like a kind of ""flying wind tunnel."" The experiment focused on determining how a reusable launch vehicle's engine plume would affect the aerodynamics of its lifting body shape at specific altitudes and speeds reaching about 750 miles/hour (335 meter/second or 1207 km/h). Design refinements looked to minimize the interaction of the aerodynamic flow with the engine plume, which could create drag.  The aircraft completed seven research flights. Two initial flights were used to determine the aerodynamic characteristics of the LASRE apparatus on the back of the aircraft. The first of those occurred 31 October 1997. The SR-71 took off at 8:31 a.m. (Pacific Standard Time-PST). The aircraft flew for 1:50 hour, reaching Mach 1.2 and an altitude of 33,000 feet (10,000 m), landing at Edwards AFB. The result validated the SR-71/pod configuration.

WarplanePorn,3bje6j,Fruit_Cake_Best_Cake,3,Tue Jun 30 13:00:24 2015 UTC,"Kind of. They're both multi-role, but the F-35 has a lot more capability (stealth, better radar, better EOTS/targeting, better range, can carry more weapons, etc).  However, it's worth it to say the F-35 will be the aircraft operating off Britain's carriers (replacing the harrier)."
WarplanePorn,3bje6j,fredy5,2,Tue Jun 30 13:09:33 2015 UTC,So the eurofighter has become obsolete?  I don't get it why do people hate the F-35 then?
WarplanePorn,3bje6j,Fruit_Cake_Best_Cake,5,Tue Jun 30 13:47:40 2015 UTC,"Kind of, if you want to think of it that way. The Eurofighter can still do what it was designed to do. And the Eurofighter is in a way cheaper than the F-35 for those European countries, as the cost is paid to the company/people that build them; and then the government taxes that.   The F-35B (which Britain is buying) is also a bit lacking compared to the A/C models. By this I mean it'll only have a smaller advantage over a Eurofighter. Plus the Eurofighter will get a new radar and such to make it last longer. Although it's also worthy to note the A model has been thrown around as a future replacement option for the Eurofighter (keep in mind the F-35 isn't in service yet, and is over a decade newer).  Now to address why people dislike it: they read articles by Dave Majumdar, David Axe, Bill Sweetman, and a few others. These people have an agenda to harm the F-35, as apparent in their articles. Also to note their sources, they're always a ""recent report"" or ""someone said so"", never revealing where or how they got any information. Lots of claims, and no real ground to back it up. I remember one article where Dave Majumdar (never flown an aircraft, has no degree in aviation) tried to dispel some confident remarks said by Billy Flynn (test pilot for F-35, Eurofighter Typhoon, F-16 Super Viper and CF-18 pilot). Kinda hard to believe these people when they call actual pilots wrong about planes."

WarplanePorn,3bje6j,Preacherjonson,1 point,Sat Jul 18 00:14:38 2015 UTC,"I would agree, except the F-35 is cheaper than any of its competitors. Here's a chart: https://www.reddit.com/r/F35Lightning/comments/3c68tl/table_aircraft_cost_comparison/?sort=confidence. For the US, every cost associated with the F-35 will amount to 1.3 trillion in FY2065 dollars. Maintaining the aircraft it will replace would cost about 4 trillion. It also costs about the same per year as an F-16 currently does (so actually less with inflation) and is estimated to cost the same as an F-16 per flight hour when it reaches maturity."

It was an articulation of the failure of the military industrial complex as a jobs program. For too long, international (it's not just a US problem, though we exemplify it) arms spending has been used not for its intended purpose, defense, but to try to mitigate what would be horrendous unemployment. The F-35 was an attempt to have our cake and eat it too, to keep those jobs intact and keep the defense industry current, but without going overboard and replacing systems 1:1 as their capability would dictate. It's become more expensive than hoped, less capable than desired, and has been left as something still very capable, but in no way excellent. At the end of the day, the overwhelming feeling I have about the F-35 is that it is unnecessary, and the money could have been injected into the tech and manufacturing industries in other ways, such as further promoting private spaceflight or constructing/renovating national transportation infrastructure."
WarplanePorn,3bje6j,MiG31_Foxhound,3,Tue Jun 30 05:58:43 2015 UTC,I dont really think its that bad. Look at its equivalent.

However, like it or not, the F-35 will never fill fill the shoes of the A-10. In order to gain political momentum, it had to fill as many roles as possible to secure inter-agency support. It's literally the Space Shuttle all over again.  Edit: Since you replaced ""aircraft it's replacing"" with ""equivalent,"" my reply  makes far less sense, but I still think the spirit is preserved. Are you speaking of the Hornet? The F-35 is definitely a match for, and in some cases superior to the Hornet. However, the performance differential is not great enough to warrant the expenditure. The F-35 has a similar speed, comparable range, fills both strike and fleet defense roles, and offers low-observability. This is all fine, but only one of those traits is unique to it. Now, consider a Hornet's price tag... Like I said before, the F-35 is not the anti-Christ, it's just hugely unnecessary in my opinion."

WarplanePorn,3bje6j,EclecticEuTECHtic,2,Tue Jun 30 15:57:36 2015 UTC,"I was referring mainly to the hornet and harrier. For these planes you also have to take the pilot into consideration. There was an AMA some months ago done by an AAF pilot who flew f-18's and had the fortune to fly in f-35's and potentially teach in the f-35. From what I gathered the f-35 is a total dream to fly with its incredible electronics. I mean sure there's its theoretical stats but if its a pain in the ass to fly its not going to be as successful (look at the super saber). Maybe I rambled there a bit but I just dont see how the F-35 is as big of a flop as people make it out to be, War is expensive and its only going to get costlier."

WarplanePorn,3bje6j,fredy5,4,Wed Jul 1 01:02:27 2015 UTC,"I'm going to put this simple. You're wrong because you haven't looked into the program, and haven't read past the F-35 hate train.  Now more complex; the f-35 is advertised to politicians for jobs. Just like every program is. Do you wanna know why Arizona opposes the F-35 so much? Money/jobs from the A-10. The F-35's performance is in no way hindered by politics. So let me see if I can change your mind about some things. For starters, the F-35 is better than all the aircraft it's replacing, in literally every way (except max speed). This really isn't an issue, because top speed is almost never used, and combat loaded 4th Gen fighters couldn't hope to reach the F-35's max speed (it can reach its max speed with combat load). The F-35 is better in BVR than anything but the F-22. It's radar is the 2nd most powerful (of fighters) flying, and will be the third stealth aircraft ever deployed. In WVR, the F-35 excels. It's got an AOA limit of 50 degrees, nearly 20-30 degrees better than any aircraft it's replacing. The F-35 also has better exceleration/lifting than nearly everything it's replacing (when loaded equivalently as what it's replacing). The F-35 also has as much range with internal fuel as any aircraft it's replacing with drop tanks. To further it's lead, the F-35 has the most advanced avionics, combined with the most comprehensive sensor suit (DAS). And to top it all off, the F-35 costs about as much as an F-16 and F-18E (cheaper than a Eurofighter or Rafale).   Now I'm going to tackle the myth that the F-35 can't replace the A-10. For starters, the F-35 really isn't replacing the A-10. The A-10 just doesn't have a role in the USAF anymore. F-16 and F-18 aircraft already do most of CAS. But to continue, the F-35 carries more weapons than an A-10, it's targeting system is far better (to the point of laghable), it's got almost 4 times the combat range, it can operate in contested air space (the A-10 cannot), it's less prone to friendly fire, it can set up attacks much quicker, it can spend more time in combat at a greater range, etc. The only thing the A-10 is better at, is carrying more bullets. Which isn't an issue, as the gun on the A-10 is becoming less useful for military purposes (can't penetrate armor, is quit inaccurate thus dangerous to use for CAS, etc)."
WarplanePorn,3bje6j,fredy5,-9,Tue Jun 30 13:07:01 2015 UTC,"Only two of those aircraft are worth a damn.  Besides I thought the F-35 was being employed by the Fleet Air Arm?   Edit: Christ, I won't have an opinion then."

Chinese Flankers also have the NATO reporting name of Flanker, so yes they are actual Flankers. They're not Su-27s though but J-11s.  In the end it's semantics though, you could also argue that European F-16s aren't really F-16s because they were not built by General Dynamics/Lockheed Martin, but license built by Fokker and SABCA."

WarplanePorn,3be4ii,BananaPeelSlippers,3,Sun Jun 28 18:00:38 2015 UTC,"I think so.  The thing that sucks about cluster munitions are the numerous small, unexploded duds that sit around for a long time after a conflict.

WarplanePorn,3be4r4,BananaPeelSlippers,1 point,Sun Jun 28 18:05:50 2015 UTC,"Honestly, how is it supposed to be stealthy without a place for internal weapons storage? I've been following the development of this plane for a while because my dad thinks Russian warplanes are the bee's knees. I can see why they're WAY behind in development."
WarplanePorn,3be4r4,bhfroh,5,Mon Jun 29 05:49:12 2015 UTC,It does have a place for internal weapons carriage - there are 2 inline weapon bays between the engines and the two thin little pod things under the root of the wings can carry one short range air-to-air missile each.
WarplanePorn,3be4r4,Dragon029,-2,Mon Jun 29 08:25:45 2015 UTC,So it really can't become an air superiority fighter... nor multirole eh?
WarplanePorn,3be4r4,bhfroh,5,Mon Jun 29 08:30:44 2015 UTC,What makes you say that?
WarplanePorn,3be4r4,Dragon029,-1,Mon Jun 29 08:31:22 2015 UTC,"Theoretically, a single F-22 can take down 8 targets with an array of 6 AIM 120s and 2 AIM 9s; all carried internally. However, if the T-50 can only carry 4 weapons internally, how is it supposed to be an air superiority fighter? And the only way it can be a good multi-role aircraft is on day two (meaning air defenses requiring stealth penetration capabilities have been taken out, allowing hard points on the wings to be less risky)."
WarplanePorn,3be4r4,bhfroh,6,Mon Jun 29 08:36:06 2015 UTC,"No, the weapon bays in the center of the PAK-FA carry 2 or 3 missiles each (at the moment it's thought to be 2, due to the size of the fins on Russia's current missiles, but they're also developing new air-to-air missiles that could make it 3, maybe 4 if they really push it.  So right now (if it's radar, etc were fully functional) it could carry 4 AIM-120-equivalents (R-77s) and 2 AIM-9-equivalents (R-73s).  We don't yet know exactly what will fit in the bays in terms of air-to-ground, but it's likely to be similar to the F-35's capacity, if not a bit more."
WarplanePorn,3be4r4,Dragon029,-1,Mon Jun 29 08:49:55 2015 UTC,The F-35 is a laughable excuse for a 5th gen fighter...
WarplanePorn,3be4r4,bhfroh,5,Mon Jun 29 09:00:42 2015 UTC,"Bring up every complaint about it and I'll rebuttal each and everyone one of them - the F-35 is no F-22 in the air-to-air realm, but it's similar, and maximises on the things that make the F-22 >100x more lethal than the F-15C."

WarplanePorn,3bavut,silence_hr,2,Sat Jun 27 13:29:10 2015 UTC,"It would be more accurate to call it an attack aircraft or strike fighter, rather than a bomber.  Apart from not being carrier-capable, it's broadly comparable to a Super Hornet in size and role."
WarplanePorn,3bavut,BCMM,4,Sat Jun 27 14:02:42 2015 UTC,"Very broadly; the Super Hornet is a slightly above the median size of a fighter; the Su-34 is at the very high end of the scale:  F/A-18F vs Su-35:  Length: 18.31m vs 23.34m  Wingspan: 13.62m vs 14.7m  Empty weight: 32,081lb vs 49,608lb  Internal fuel capacity: 13,550lb vs 26,676lb  Payload capacity: 17,750lb vs 26,450lb  MTOW: 66,000lb vs 99,425lb  Combat radius: 390nmi vs 680nmi"

WarplanePorn,3bb6r6,silence_hr,1 point,Sat Jun 27 15:26:13 2015 UTC,The one thing i really hate about this plane is the lack of wingtip pylons.
WarplanePorn,3bb6r6,LPFJII,7,Sat Jun 27 22:20:07 2015 UTC,"If it had wingtip pylons it wouldn't be very stealthy now would it? It's a small fighter with 10 hardpoints, it's not lacking in slots for boom boom."
WarplanePorn,3bb6r6,specofdust,2,Sat Jun 27 22:55:45 2015 UTC,"Right but wingtip pylons look cool.   Also, underwing pylons aren't exactly stealthy either, but they can be removed...why not have removable wingtip pylons too?"
WarplanePorn,3bb6r6,LPFJII,2,Sat Jun 27 22:57:44 2015 UTC,"It just doesn't seem necessary. You've got 10 pylons if you need them, you're generally only going to use 4, why bother?"
WarplanePorn,3bb6r6,specofdust,4,Sat Jun 27 23:05:29 2015 UTC,"Because they look cool. I'm not saying it needs them, I'm just saying they look cool.   Also, why couldn't two of those 10 pylons have been on the wingtips?"
WarplanePorn,3bb6r6,LPFJII,3,Sat Jun 27 23:16:48 2015 UTC,"Stealth aircraft want / need wingtips that taper to an edge; having hardpoints for missile rails eliminates that as a possibility.   Plus, the further you go away from the center of a wing, the smaller the weapon the hardpoint can handle."

This F-35B is carrying Paveway LGBs; they've been in the F-35-news because they're undering external carriage / release tests for the UK.

WarplanePorn,3b3emo,Clovis69,3,Sat Jun 27 05:01:38 2015 UTC,"6 AIM-120s actually for the internal bays.  If the CUDA / SACM comes around and they were integrated with the F-22, then it could carry 12 internally (same as the F-35), although there might be opportunity to mount 2 or 4 more in the auxilliary weapon bays (where the AIM-9s are launched from).

WarplanePorn,3azdtz,PolarWalrus,5,Sat Jun 27 06:50:33 2015 UTC,Heat Exchangers  The X-35 had several external heat exchangers. A nose ram air inlet was incorporated for backup avionics cooling. A centerline heat exchanger provided cooling for the hydraulic system. A heat exchanger on the left side supported the environmental control system. The F-35 has two scoops located in the wing/fuselage to provide nacelle bay ventilation. The aircraft also has a scoop located on the top of the right wing-glove to provide air to the fuel/air heat exchanger. A deployable scoop is located on the left-aft fuselage to provide air to the IPP and to the avionics. The F-35 minimizes the need for external scoops by using heat exchangers that are integrated in the engine fan duct. These heat exchangers use engine bypass air as a heat sink.   http://www.codeonemagazine.com/article.html?item_id=28

WarplanePorn,39sm3x,dakboy,1 point,Sun Jun 14 21:29:22 2015 UTC,"Boeing B-52 Stratofortress:       The Boeing B-52 Stratofortress is a long-range, subsonic, jet-powered strategic bomber. The B-52 was designed and built by Boeing, which has continued to provide support and upgrades. It has been operated by the United States Air Force (USAF) since the 1950s. The bomber is capable of carrying up to 70,000 pounds (32,000 kg) of weapons.   Beginning with the successful contract bid in June 1946, the B-52 design evolved from a straight wing aircraft powered by six turboprop engines to the final prototype YB-52 with eight turbojet engines and swept wings. The B-52 took its maiden flight in April 1952. Built to carry nuclear weapons for Cold War-era deterrence missions, the B-52 Stratofortress replaced the Convair B-36. A veteran of several wars, the B-52 has dropped only conventional munitions in combat. The B-52's official name Stratofortress is rarely used; informally, the aircraft has become commonly referred to as the BUFF (Big Ugly Fat Fucker).    The B-52 has been in active service with the USAF since 1955. As of 2012 [update], 85 were in active service with nine in reserve. The bombers flew under the Strategic Air Command (SAC) until it was inactivated in 1992 and its aircraft absorbed into the Air Combat Command (ACC); in 2010 all B-52 Stratofortresses were transferred from the ACC to the new Air Force Global Strike Command (AFGSC). Superior performance at high subsonic speeds and relatively low operating costs have kept the B-52 in service despite the advent of later, more advanced aircraft, including the canceled Mach 3 B-70 Valkyrie, the variable-geometry B-1 Lancer, and the stealth B-2 Spirit. The B-52 completed fifty years of continuous service with its original operator in 2005; after being upgraded between 2013 and 2015, it is expected to serve into the 2040s.

Maybe that revised nose and intake would reduce its front on signature but the moment it manoeuvres, even allowing for RAM panels its going to betray its 70s origins.   Conformal tanks are a short cut range booster and in this case may even aid stealth but they take their (permanent) toll on performance.   Would be a good way to keep the newer airframes flying though I guess.  EDIT: I didn't realise those were conformal weapon bays and not tanks. Again though tacking stuff like this on reduces performance, especially in this case only to give you 2x BVR missile capability.   EDIT2: That panel fit tho..."

WarplanePorn,39g9gl,dakboy,3,Fri Jun 12 00:47:05 2015 UTC,Genuine question. Why does the fastest plane in the world need a afterburner?
WarplanePorn,39g9gl,tijger897,13,Thu Jun 11 18:19:47 2015 UTC,"The afterburner is what makes it the fastest plane in the world?  Interesting fun fact, the SR-71 required the pilot to light one afterburner during refueling to avoid falling off the boom.  From Sled Driver:   At the slow 300 knot range i n which we were flying to refuel, the feel of the jet became sluggish as the SR filled with fuel. At these gross weights a n d slower airspeeds, the SR-71 became thrust limited during the last few minutes of refueling. In military power, we would start to fall off the boom. A disconnect was highly undesirable since the jet was less responsive now and to reconnect was more difficult. It also meant wasting time on the refueling track a n d this could affect our overall mission timing. The solution was to light one afterburner with careful finesse. The fine art of pulling the throttle ever so slightly up a n d just into the minimum burner range was handed down from one generation of SR pilots to the next. The SR is the only airplane I know that required the use of afterburner to stay on the boom.  Using one afterburner caused another problem: asymmetrical thrust. Some pilots used a little rudder to handle the yaw. Others left the rudders alone, flew sideways, a n d looked out the front quarter panel to see forward. The quarter panels were located on either side of the windshield. Only the left quarter panel was wired for defogging so we always lit the left burner to yaw right so we could use this feature if needed.  The most exciting moments on the refueling track were normally reserved for those final few minutes in afterburner on the boom with a very heavy jet. Once I selected m i n AB a n d the TEB dumped in, there was a pause, then the airplane lunged sideways a n d started to charge up the boom. With the left burner stabilized in min AB, I control led our fore and aft position with right throttle. With this method, the pilot controlled the airplane by leading the power inputs. It was like flying a freight train because the airplane's inertia caused a lag between throttle input a n d aircraft response. It wasn't uncommon a t this point for the director lights to resemble a pinball game, flashing from end to end as the fore a n d aft movements of the jet caused continual changes in relative position. I had to ignore the director lights, grit my teeth, a n d ca l l on every bit of my experience to get to the end of the refueling track with a full tank."

Their speed and maneuverability is comparable as far as I know, but the Eurofighter presumably has better radar and beyond-visual-range performance.

WarplanePorn,38osmz,nsgiad,2,Fri Jun 5 19:14:33 2015 UTC,The only way to manually rotate them is to tear apart the nacelle and hook a drill up to the shaft that raises and lowers it. Definitely not going to happen during flight. But the only way its gonna fail to raise is if that shaft is fucked. Its a super redundant system.

I do remember reading somewhere (probably on reddit) that in WW2 large bomber formations would have one bomber that would be the lead, kind of like a flagship. To avoid having the enemy listen in on radio communications they'd use a variety of visual signals to give orders to the formation. The designated lead bomber would have a very recognizable paint job sort of like this one so that everyone would know where to look.   I doubt that's what's going on here though."

WarplanePorn,378564,Rodot,1 point,Sun May 31 02:10:42 2015 UTC,They're all bound by the same physics when trying to build a stealth fighter. All fifth gen designs will have similar features. The stealth F-117 was the odd man out only because it was built before sophisticated CAD tools which allow for more curvy shapes than its flatness.
WarplanePorn,378hgg,mrjderp,1 point,Mon May 25 19:06:53 2015 UTC,Plot twist: the P-51 was shopped into this photo. The most clearly visible clue is that the lighting is totally off. It's also sharper than the other aircraft.

The bombers are both exposed to sunlight coming from their 9 o'clock high. The P-51's fuselage is shaded, while its wings are exposed. That indicates the sun is at its 2 or 3 o'clock high. The sun can't be in two positions at the same time, so that's the first thing that stands out.  Furthermore, the P-51 is much sharper than both bombers. There are also clone stamp marks visible next to the P-51's tail, which are similar to its horizontal stabilizer. Zoom in and see for yourself: even the paint job is visible on those cloning marks.  The aircraft themselves are great, no question about that. Of course its difficult to schedule photoshoots with all aircraft, but a bit more photoshopping would have resulted in a far more convincing picture ;-)"

WarplanePorn,36ipur,OrzBlueFog,3,Tue May 19 18:04:29 2015 UTC,Story?
WarplanePorn,36ipur,TheRealNortson,19,Tue May 19 18:54:58 2015 UTC,"It was on the first NATO exercise for one Sub Lieutenant ""Soapy"" Watson, flying his Harrier off of the HMS Illustrious near the coast of Portugal. Soapy and his wingman were tasked with searching for a French carrier under simulated combat conditions with radar and radio off.  After completing his assignment, Soapy was detached to rendezvous with his flight leader and return to the carrier. Unfortunately when he showed up his flight leader was nowhere to be seen.   Soapy fired up his radio to try and assess the situation, only to find it was dead. Then he realized his inertial navigation system had delivered him nowhere near his ship. Soapy was in a pickle.  Luckily the sub lieutenant had his wits about him and guided his Harrier towards a busy shipping lane. It was there he spotted the container ship Alraigo, which was delivering cargo to the Canary Islands. Soapy was preparing to eject near the ship when he spotted something promising.  See, one of the things the Alraigo was delivering to Santa Cruz was a huge base plate for a telescope for the Santa Cruz observatory. The containers had a nice flat top reminiscent of the landing surface on his missing carrier. Soapy decided to chance his luck and brought his aircraft - by now, critically low on fuel - in for a landing.  The landing went well, with the Harrier touching down gently in the calm seas. It was then that Soapy realized that the tops of the containers were wet with sea spray. His Harrier began to unnervingly roll backwards. Soapy tried to retract the landing gear to stop the skid, but his aircraft slid off the back of the container.  Fortunately, instead of a huge fireball, the Harrier landed atop a van strapped to the deck. The vans roof absorbed the impact and left the Harrier in the position you see in the photo. The Alraigo docked in the Canary Islands to quite a media reception. The ships crew and owners were paid £570,000 for their services.   The Harrier was repaired and returned to duty. In 1992 it was retired and sits on display at the Newark Air Museum in Nottinghamshire.   As for Soapy? Well, if LinkedIn is to be believed, he retired from the Navy after 17 years, got his MBA, and is currently a real estate agent in New Zealand."

WarplanePorn,36ffjw,LPFJII,4,Mon May 18 23:37:49 2015 UTC,This isn't an f-16?
WarplanePorn,36ffjw,got_sweg,22,Tue May 19 04:19:01 2015 UTC,"It is based on the F-16, but it is different enough to be considered a different aircraft.  It incorporates some features that Lockheed demonstrated on various specialized variants of the F-16 but that never went into production.    Compared to the F-16, the wings and taiplane are larger and the aircraft is overall slightly longer, and the nose and forward fuselage are slightly bigger in circumference.  What sets it apart from the F-16 is its construction and (for its time) pioneering technologies; the bigger wings had to be made of new composite materials to keep them from becoming excessively heavy, and it was the first operational fighter to be equipped with an Active Electronic Scanning Antenna (AESA) radar.    All that being said, while it was an impressive technical feat, it was not a good deal for Japan.  In terms of performance it is about equal to an F-16; the better sustained turning ability due to greater wing area is negated somewhat by its greater weight (even with the greater percentage of composites) and the new radar and other avionics took over a decade to get working right.  By the time all the bugs were worked out, it was no more capable than a contemporary F-16C.    Worse than the teething problems was the cost: the aircraft were vastly more expensive than buying off-the-shelf U.S. models tailored to Japanese specifications.  The unit cost for one aircraft was four times that of a Block 50 F-16C, and that doesn't even include the cost of developing the design.    In the end, the only real benefit Japan got from the F-2 program was experience and technology transfer, since Lockheed licensed a lot of tech to Mitsubishi.  This may prove useful in the future if Japan designs its own fighters from the ground up.  But in and of itself the F-2 was not money well spent; it is a perfectly capable and modern fighter, but much too expensive for what it is."
WarplanePorn,36ffjw,Setitimer,6,Tue May 19 04:51:22 2015 UTC,"For interest, this is what the F-2 was originally supposed to look like when they were conceiving it as a fully indigenous design, before opting for a foreign-derived design:   Drawing Model"
WarplanePorn,36ffjw,Kytescall,5,Tue May 19 14:02:58 2015 UTC,"The unit cost for one aircraft was four times that of a Block 50 F-16C, and that doesn't even include the cost of developing the design   That situation is quite Japanese - there's a lot of industrial welfare built into the numbers. Apparently their Apache helicopters somehow ended up a billion dollars a copy."
WarplanePorn,36ffjw,tinian_circus,4,Tue May 19 19:21:57 2015 UTC,"Not a billion, $200 million is the commonly quoted figure, about the cost of an F-22. But I've read that one reason this happened is that they tried to pay off the licence costs and various other costs (which would normally be paid off bit by bit throughout the production run) in one year. Three Apaches plus the licence fees etc they owed for another 50 Apaches that were cancelled worked out to about $200 million per Apache that year. The budget though was denied so they actually bought none for that specific price. A couple of years later they bought those last three Apaches, but only paid $40-something million each. Those licence fees and so on that they owed were paid separately."
WarplanePorn,36ffjw,Kytescall,1 point,Wed May 20 02:37:19 2015 UTC,"Huh, that might shed some light on it. I'm not sure where the billion-per-copy number got figured but they're big on tech transfer, and it might include things like production tooling that don't make it into other estimates. It may be a case of putting themselves in a position where they can rapidly start rolling the assembly lines in the future if the local geopolitical situation starts looking scary."
WarplanePorn,36ffjw,tinian_circus,1 point,Wed May 20 11:28:38 2015 UTC,"Yup, it maintains their capability to make advanced weapons systems, and it also essentially serves as a subsidy for the Japanese companies involved."

WarplanePorn,367nuo,Le-Croissant,3,Sun May 17 07:25:33 2015 UTC,The big colouful one is the F-15 STOL/MTD  The small one is one of the NASA T-38s that's often used a chase plane because it can keep up with the F-16XL and F-15 more easily than typical low-performance chase planes like Boeing's T-33 or Airbus' Aerospatiale Corvette.

Developed as a technology demonstrator, the F-15 STOL/MTD carried out research for studying the effects of thrust vectoring and enhanced maneuverability. The aircraft used for the project was pre-production TF-15A (F-15B) No. 1 (USAF S/N 71-0290), the first two-seat F-15 Eagle built by McDonnell Douglas (out of 2 prototype ), the sixth F-15 off the assembly line, and was the oldest F-15 flying up to its retirement. It was also used as the avionics testbed for the F-15E Strike Eagle program.  The plane was on loan to NASA from the United States Air Force.

WarplanePorn,367nuo,CoLTe,2,Sun May 17 09:54:11 2015 UTC,The camo business jet looking one is a Lockheed Jetstar (designated C-140 by the USAF).    The other one with variable geometry wings looks to me like an F-111.
WarplanePorn,367nuo,Alpha_Zulu,2,Sun May 17 11:39:37 2015 UTC,2nd one is a USAF / NASA F-111 AFTI - it's different from regular F-111's due to it's larger wing chord and the use of seamless flaps.

WarplanePorn,362uhz,NTolerance,3,Sat May 16 12:50:13 2015 UTC,"When it was designed it was compared to the F-4 and MiG-21, both of which it could turn inside.  Later aircraft like the F-15/16/18 likely gave it some problems, but it was still exceptional at BFM for such a large aircraft that could carry so much weaponry and fuel.  Early F-14s were hampered by the anemic TF30 engines, but later models were quite powerful when equipped with the F110 engines.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3VKND7HrB8  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsUCixAeZ0A"
