There's a minor issue, after stopping something that's been playing for a bit, I get a directory error, but everything is still working, so just slightly annoying.

I suppose I can probably tag those movies somehow in Plex but that seems a little more complicated."

It's a bit of a pain in the ass if you have a large library, but it's worth going through and marking stuff ""watched.""  If you use the select feature, it's pretty easy to go through a hundred or more at a time.  I just did it whenever I had a few minutes to kill over a few days and went through about 1,000 movies.  Now I just filter by unwatched.  Plex handled genres fine as long as the metadata is accurate.  But that's a little tougher to make sure it's right."

PleX,3e19rr,myrandomevents,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:21:13 2015 UTC,"Got it. Ok, looks like your options, as mentioned elsewhere are:  1) Mount Google Drive as a local drive. You would then basically point Plex at your ""local drive"" (will look and feel like a local drive, but won't actually store any data) to index and pull metadata. There are quite a few cons to this solution though. For one, in order to stream to anything but a player that resides on your server machine, the video would have to make two hops (Google > Server, then Server > Player). And there could potentially be transcoding, etc. in the Server > Player step. With this set up, you also would not benefit from the transcoding / adaptive streaming you mentioned that is so great about Google Drive (I'm guessing this is thanks to YouTube's tech, but I digress). So that brings me to, which I think you've been asking for, but this thread may be missing...  2) Web frontend for Google Drive. Does not exist to my knowledge, but honestly would not be that hard to create, especially if you are in the habit of downloading all your own metadata and storing it outside of Plex. If you had a library with associated movie posters, movie.xml files, backgrounds, etc. it would be pretty simple to display that via HTML. The hardest part would be creating the Google Drive scanner and setting up deeplinking for mobile.  Does Google Drive connect with Google Compute Engine? I'm guessing it probably does not. But it may just be easiest to host a Plex server on AWS / Google Compute / Azure and you'd basically have your own always-on Plex server in the cloud that anything could always connect to."

I don't think it would be terribly hard given there are streaming sites that link to ""illegal"" streaming movies all over the net. So why not make a legal version? They are YOUR movies. This would be an easy addition to something like Trakt.tv where you have your own lists and they are linked to your legal file locker with your movies in them. I mean why not?"

It sucks that it has be to running in Windows (for now until someone releases their Linux version) but its better then nothing.  Plex seems to have a breakdown when initially indexing everything but that could very possibly just be the fact that the VPS only has 2GB ram. I've tried acd_cli for linux but it seems too unstable - same with the google drive alternative node-gdrive-fuse.  If you want you can try the setup out with the 3 month ACD trial + 1 month netdrive2 trial. :)

PleX,3dzzlf,LincolnStein,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:15:22 2015 UTC,I will have to try this on mine.  My remote access stopped working with PIA when plex forums got hacked.

Installed PIA and connected.  Remote Access was still working.  I did not put my plex server in a DMZ.

PleX,3dwwre,ravonaf,0,Mon Jul 20 13:26:26 2015 UTC,The IOS client works for me. I do get the occasional crash but they are few and far between. What IOS users don't have are all the new features that have been added over the last year. As an example I can't implement user control on my server because the IOS client does not support that yet. This is a feature that was added last year. Here is it almost August and IOS users are still out in the cold. My clients work.

If you aren't great with Linux, or don't want to take the time to get familiar with it,  I would stick with a Windows server.   I have never tried to run Windows on my server so I have no comparison in performance but I have never had any trouble with transcoding performance (2 1080p 8mbit streams at once), or the speed at which the drives are accessed. I use a 12TB-usable ZFS pool that is pretty simple to add storage to but the ZFS support on Linux is just okay.

PleX,3dvrwq,AfterShock,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:44:11 2015 UTC,Plex web app buffers all the time as well.
PleX,3dvrwq,AfterShock,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:50:42 2015 UTC,"So if the web app buffers, there has to be something wrong locally, yes I've read the speed tests, but this is two clients now that buffer.  So it's not client specific issue, it has to be local network related.  Disable experimental player for the web client and see if that helps.  I'd setup a temp PMS at the parents on their pc just to test with.  Try lowering quality to 720p most parents won't be able to tell the difference."
PleX,3dvrwq,Plonqor,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:33:44 2015 UTC,"Yeah I'm thinking it has to be something with their router or their Ooma Telo which is currently first in line after the modem (bridged) and then their router connects through that.  I'm going to move the Telo inside their network and see if that makes a difference.  The downloads through plex web start fast (900-1000) but then dwindle down to 300kbps or so in less than 5 or 6 seconds.  I suspect something is throttling that traffic on their network (potentially the QOS in the Telo is acting up?).    The issue is a more broad, ""why can't their network receive data from my network faster than ~4mbps"" vs a specific plex issue.  I know my network can SEND data as fast as it needs to by testing with my office PC, so that leaves the problem likely on their end.    I have them throttling down to 2mbps 768p right now in the AFT, which works okay, but they said it still pauses briefly to buffer maybe 3 or 4 times during a tv show.  Next step is 1mbps 480p, but I really just want to get full speed data transfers going because then it can direct-play my files, and that's easier on my PMS as well."
PleX,3dvrwq,Plonqor,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:28:10 2015 UTC,Could it be their ISP throttling plex traffic somehow?  By the way - props for a well constructed informative post.
PleX,3dvrwq,Plonqor,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:18:03 2015 UTC,"Thanks - I don't think plex itself is being throttled.  One thing I left out of the OP was that I used TeamViewer's file transfer option to just copy a file from my computer to theirs, and the throughput was even worse - 200-300KB/s.  Again, same feature to my office computer (granted, same ISP, very local) saturates my connection."

PleX,3dvrwq,PBI325,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:29:01 2015 UTC,"I did do plex web as myself and download a file first, then just to test general throughput between my computer and theirs, did the teamviewer download.

PleX,3dvrwq,PBI325,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:51:33 2015 UTC,"I would also test downloading from microsoft.com (like an iso).   MS download was around 5MB/s - not saturating their downstream, but plenty fast for plex.  Watching the plex download (when I log in to plex web and download a file) is interesting - It seems to start fast and then slow down over the next few seconds.  Watching the start of a download, I'd see 900KB/s, then 1,000KB/s, then 600KB/s, then 500, 400, 300 and that'd be where it would hang out.    I'm trying to think how they have their network set up (I'm the one who did it, but it's been a couple of years).  IIRC, they have their Ooma Telo first in line bridged to the modem, then their Cisco/Linksys E1200 running DD-WRT, then all their client devices.   I'm concerned because I wonder if their Ooma Telo is playing with the traffic for QOS or something.  However, I can't seem to access it, nor can I get to ooma.com from their network.    I wish I could be in two places at once, it's so difficult trying to troubleshoot this thing from 1300 miles away."

I know that feeling, I do remote tech support...  Like you say, the speed degradation over time suggests some kind of throttling. QoS was my first thought as well. I suppose you could test this theory by using a VPN - TeamViewer's built in VPN might do the trick. If the VPN is also slow, then try a tracert - maybe it's taking some weird route through a bottleneck."
PleX,3dvrwq,barnopss,2,Mon Jul 20 05:14:44 2015 UTC,"It was the Ooma Telo.  I moved that to connect to the router instead of bridging to the modem, and their speeds doubled.  It still wasn't quite maxing me out, ~800KB/s or so.  Then I checked and realized I had two other remote clients connected to Plex at the time.  So yeah, I am 99% sure that solved my problem.  Instead of starting fast and slowing down, it started slow-ish and then gradually climbed."
PleX,3dvrwq,barnopss,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:04:23 2015 UTC,"IIRC, they have their Ooma Telo first in line bridged to the modem, then their Cisco/Linksys E1200 running DD-WRT, then all their client devices.   Is this an older Ooma? I know my newer unit can be set us as a normal endpoint device. Even though I wouldn't think the Telo would be the issue you should try and get that back inside your LAN if at all possible."

So no, as far as I know there is no way to maintain full resolution without having a Blu-ray player. With 3D on Blu-ray, each eye gets its own 1,920x1,080-pixel image. These are combined into one extra-tall frame, of which there are 24 per second. 45 pixels of blanking are included (the black space in the middle), resulting in a 1,920x2,205/24 signal.

This is different from (and inferior to) what's on Blu Rays, which alternate left and right images using the whole frame. The point of all this is the detail in SBS-converted files is half of what you'd otherwise get.  I'd like to be wrong. Are there 3D files that Plex can stream that aren't SBS?"
PleX,3dutub,spblat,3,Sun Jul 19 23:18:48 2015 UTC,"You realise that SBS can also actually be double-width encoded, right? As in the file isn't 1920x1080, but actually 3840x1080 to accomodate for both of the 3D frame images, and then still presented at whatever framerate the material is at.  Interlaced 3D either doubles the required frames or halves the effective framerate (which for film is often acceptable to have a 60 or 48 Hz/FPS encode that becomes 30 or 24 effective Hz/FPS).   There are also methods of interlaced 3D where they use every other line instead of every other frame, which halves your vertical resolution. You may be thinking of this.  A proper SBS 3D file is likely going to be 1.5~2 times bigger in file size than a 2D version."

You could always pay for a private server ""in the cloud"" with someone like Amazon and simply host your data and the server there, just like you do on your home network but the system will always require a volume mounted which the plex server can address.

PleX,3dux9p,Cel_Drow,3,Sun Jul 19 19:32:51 2015 UTC,It actually says Force Refresh as an option on the cog icon when viewing a particular library. As far as Freebase it needs to be enabled on both its own setting and under The Movie Database. Also be sure to hit its cog icon and set to find trailers and extras automatically under both sets of settings.

I'm trying to get at WHY it doesn't work locally without internet.  If the WHY is that it requires plexpass, then that is completely understable that it wouldn't work without internet (or their server being up) and it's apples and oranges relevant to the larger topic.  Two things can have the same outcome (doesn't work without internet connection) and appear to be comparable on the surface.  But if the actual cause of it not working is completely different, they're not really the same thing even if the end result seems the same.  If something is members only, it makes sense that they need to confirm that you're a member.  And they do that via a phone home to confirm.  So it's a no brainer that it wouldn't work if their server is down and it can't authenticate.  That's pretty understandable.  That is not remotely the same as a client that does not require membership not working locally."

PleX,3dnn3x,halethrain,3,Fri Jul 17 19:10:58 2015 UTC,If you use OpenVPN you can set this up in your config file and don't have to run any scripts (but you may have to periodically update the config with any new IP addresses that resolve to my.plexapp.com). I like running OpenVPN as a service and have a single config file that randomly selects one of a handful of the available servers. Here's a sample of the config:  Random Connection Config Example:  remote-random remote us-east.privateinternetaccess.com 1194 remote us-florida.privateinternetaccess.com 1194 remote ca.privateinternetaccess.com 1194   Bypass VPN to expose Plex server over WAN:  route 184.169.0.0 255.255.0.0 <plex server ip address>  route 50.18.105.0 255.255.255.0 <plex server ip address>  route 50.18.254.0 255.255.255.0 <plex server ip address>  route 50.18.178.0 255.255.255.0 <plex server ip address>    Edit: the Plex server IP address is your LAN IP of the box that your Plex server is running on. It's assumed you're running your VPN client and Plex on the same box.

PleX,3dnn3x,mannibis,4,Fri Jul 17 19:20:27 2015 UTC,"Plex encrypting traffic isn't really relevant to this.  Most people running PIA aren't doing it for plex, they're doing it for other things. The problem is that when running, it prevents remote access to plex (which just happens to be on the same machine).  This just lets you use PIA, for a plethora of non-plex related reasons, and still access the server remotely."

PleX,3dnn3x,mflagler,1 point,Sat Jul 18 05:27:31 2015 UTC,"I can't say for sure without knowing how Plex's backend actually deals with their traffic. VPN's by nature obfuscate your IP address, and PIA specifically doesn't take requests to open ports. I don't see any indication online that SSL will be a solution for this though, so I guess it's a wait-and-see thing."
PleX,3dnn3x,_BindersFullOfWomen_,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:43:44 2015 UTC,"The purpose of using PIA has nothing to do with the SSL certificates.

Some of PIA's servers will allow it, but you're assigned a random port which can change, making it a pain. This way uses your normal router/firewall and bypasses the VPN which means you'll get your full ISP speed and not a more restrictive VPN speed for remote viewing. Local streaming works without this, but anything remotely needs to bypass the VPN."

I think that is the standard response if accessing the service from a device that is not an AppleTV.  EDIT: just to add that you need to have both the HTTPS and HTTP services accessible otherwise you wont be able to use it since the atv makes requests on both protocols and expects replies on them too. A few things to check are wether there are other applications/services making use of those ports and if so simply use port redirects for specific ip's. I for example already run a webserver on my debian machine at port 80/443 so I need to launch PlexConnect on other ports and tell the system that when a request for a specific ip (my atvs) comes through on the standard 80/443 ports to redirect to the other ports I set up.

I picked up a very quiet fractal design case as it had a lot of internal bays as well, an i5 and a motherboard with 8 sata on it and slapped unraid on a thumb drive. The best thing about unraid is that not only does it protect you from failure, but it can mold together any size drives you have into one storage pool and you can expand whenever you want just by adding a new drive and adding it to your pool. It is very easy to use and so far has been extremely reliable. Getting plex running on it is very easy.  The only thing you wont be able to do is stick in your existing drives. I would get some totally new 4TB drives (at least 2 to start, better to have 3).

Check for other devices that could be interfering with the 2.4 GHz band. The Chromecast does not use the 5 GHz band, which means it's on the same frequency of lots of other devices that can muddle the signal.   If the problem persists, then the ethernet adapter would be fine. I was really lucky to get mine yesterday, and for my third floor TV Plex went from nearly unusable due to low signal, to crystal clear.

PleX,3dnil8,ZombieBeach,2,Fri Jul 17 20:02:46 2015 UTC,"I had a lot of issues getting my chromecast to have a dependable signal on my ""home"" network.  I've got 3 Cisco 3502i APs in my home (enterprise grade huge APs) and this thing still struggles with reception with the HDMI extender and it made no sense.  For me, I had to purchase an even longer HDMI extender from monoprice and the issues were solved.  TV mounted flat against a wall with an 802.11 client buried up against the wall structure is sometimes not a good place for wifi signals to penetrate depending on your construction.  Again wifi is very case-dependent.  IP multicast is needed to get it to work and if you are using a consumer grade router you are usually going to have nearly no issues there.  When you have some fancy stuff underpinning your network is when I've had very clear issues with the Chromecast and google offers 0 real help (I tried with a support email/ticket) and the response was nearly identical to the stuff that was publicly posted.  I haven't seen you indicate what kind of wifi you are using and routers/switches behind it.  If it helps you though you may want to consider reading up on this document that Cisco published.  It provides the multicast group that is used by Chromecasts (239.255.255.250) which was previously unknown to me and helped me figure out my issues on the multicast messaging.  The fact is that the chromecast does not behave like most enterprise grade multicast devices.  You end up on a Cisco AP having to disable ip igmp snooping in my case (probably not your issue).  Try out pinging your multicast address and verifying if you receive a unicast response from your chromecast IP.  Very quick way to test if the client is connecting to the wifi + multicast routing is working.  If the client is not even associating your issue is wifi and getting your client closer to the radio or using a long HDMI extender with tape to secure it may be your best option.  http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/wireless/controller/technotes/7-6/chromecastDG76/ChromecastDG76.html"

I had a bucket full of old USB ones that I've collected over the years and had a D-Link that had the right internals. Purchased a Y-OTG cable, plugged it in, pushed the cabinet back to whereit should be and everything is all good. All up, without the cost of the Y-OTG was about $10.

I recently switched to that.  I've basically decided to be done with Plex as the quality of the Google TV app went down awhile ago (audio sync issues on direct play clips [which are all of them for me] that were only visible in plex).  The android tv interface is like 90% great but the other 10 % annoying.

PleX,3dlykt,yell0wdog,2,Fri Jul 17 13:20:41 2015 UTC,"Thought I'd share my experiences with plex clients...  The best player I've used thus far is rasplex on a raspberry pi 2. My primary requirement was to be able to play bluray mkv rips without transcoding. Also wanted dts and dd hdmi pass through. My network is wired, so can't vouch for any WiFi issues, and use an HP microserver for the plex server.  Originally I was using the plex app on my samsung tv, it worked for std definition video, but wasn't powerful enough to decode 1080p.  Next I tried a roku 3, had a fast interface, however it basically didn't seem to be able to play mkv files unless I used direct play, which my little microsever still isn't really up too. Gave up after a couple of months, just far too annoying messing around with the different playback options with each video.   Finally after considering more of the commercial players I decided to give rasplex a go. It's nippy, plays nearly all formats (note you need to buy the mpeg 2 codec from pi foundation to decode those videos) and you can use your phone as the controller or if your tv remote if it supports hdmi ece.  It does take a little configuration, but on the whole I've been very pleased with it. However clearly less of an out of the box solution compared to say roku and the Google stick. Its not 100% perfect, occasionally I get the odd film it attempts to transcode for some reason, and it still has the odd bug here or there. But credit to the open source world, version 0.6 saw lots of good improvements, and no doubt they will continue to improve it.  If you do go down this route, I'd recommend getting a fast memory card, helps make it boot quicker. Also I power mine from a usb socket on the tv, so handily turns on with the tv.

I don't have as many issues with the UI as you have, my wife seems to not complain, which is fine for me, I prefer this UI to the PHT one.   On a side note having used AndroidTV since like the beginning (ADT-1 and Nexus Player), the entire platform is a big pile of these bugs. The SlingTV app tends to just starts blacking out randomly, the liveTV app's schedule is a 50/50 chance that the information doesn't fill in, the HGTV and Food Network apps will randomly stop playing at various points in a show. Also the top thing on the home screen that is supposed to be like Plex's OnDeck but across apps, I don't think I've ever seen that thing work properly. I could go on and on.

You’ll find that most low cost VMs are OpenVZ, it took me 3 different providers to find one which would enable the kernel modules I require. So either avoid OpenVZ or find a provider happy to enable modules for you. Of course all this assumes you will mount Google Drive with FUSE (not sure how else you would).  I also encrypted my data, it’s maybe not so wise to store some of your media directly on Google Drive (again, I don’t know what you’re hosting).   NAT?

I have not come across a file the rpi2 wouldn't transcode, only had a stutter with hd 4 gb mkv's. I usually just download files <1 gb. On mobile so won't go into specifics of setup but I'll say I did everything on tutorials - I'm not a programmer by any means."

When testing Google Drive last night we managed to only get 30Mbps upload and 10(!)Mbps download. Where as on acd, reaching 200 in both directions.  The only differences between our setups is I have added file encryption and I am testing on a VM rather than a dedicated.  I have been considering making files local and uploading after X days to ensure the newer data (which is most likely to have reads) can be accessed faster/without network utilisation.  How are your performance tests so far? How much media have you stored?"
PleX,3dkfbp,mortonfan,1 point,Sat Jul 18 09:12:37 2015 UTC,"Interesting! I only have around 20GB on it at the moment, the next tutorial (probably releasing today) has information on setting up rTorrent and automatic uploading. It seems to stream an 8GB hd 1080p copy of Serenity just fine after about 30s of buffering.  I'm having some interesting issues with transcoding at the moment since it's a very low spec box, but with it disabled it seems fine.   In what way are you doing encryption, and how does it affect performance/plex?"
PleX,3dkfbp,msh100,1 point,Sat Jul 18 10:46:20 2015 UTC,"I am at 3TB now. With my tests, I could watch 1080 after a couple of seconds (I tried 2 concurrent streams too, also works fine. I have no data for more than that at the time) although I think 720 is probably best to increase maximum number of concurrent streams.  I don't think I have tried any media which needs transcoding - I should check that.  To encrypt, I use encfs (another fuse filesystem). So I acd_cli mount with encrypted files, and encfs over that. From my tests as encfs encrypts individual blocks, there's 0 performance impact to plex, it also means scanning through a video still works also. Because acd_cli doesn't support writes, I have had to make a script which creates an encfs mount on the host filesystem with the same encryption keys and copies in the file to encrypt when I want to upload - it then acd_cli uploads the file from the encrypted directory."

If you're planning to run FreeNAS, your old hardware and the hardware you have selected for a new build is insufficient.   For starters FreeNAS needs ECC memory, which is more expensive than normal memory, but that means a motherboard and chipset that supports ECC memory also.   If you are going with FreeNAS, a RAID card isn't necessary b/c FreeNAS uses advanced software RAID called ZFS. So unless you need more SATA ports, you don't need a RAID card. Most FreeNAS motherboards you'll be looking at have a minimum of 6 SATA ports. The one I have has 12...The ASRock C2750d4i.

Then you need to take into account things like what happens if one of your Plex Media Servers becomes unresponsive? It may contain your view history and you could lose track of where you are etc (maybe that's a price to pay for this).  Don't get me wrong this would be a nice feature, but with how Plex works I don't think it's too plausible and I am not a fan of having Plex handle data which the Plex Media Servers currently handle, maybe some kind of Plex Media Server load balancing proxy could work, which stores this data - who knows."

PleX,3df8tw,mannibis,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:50:18 2015 UTC,"Some of the newer QNAP's can handle this but they are extremely expensive ($2500+ w/ drives). What I would do is use a split system. Something like an Intel NUC or Mac Mini to run PMS/PHT on, and the NAS to store the media. The good thing about using a split system like that is you also get a Plex Home Theater client out of it (via connecting the Mini or NUC to your TV via HDMI @ your main TV). Also, with PHT there is no need to transcode--it will Direct Play anything with minimal resource usage. Your other clients (Roku/Web/Chromecast/FireTV/Phone) will use the NUC/Mini to transcode but there is no issue there because they have ample CPU to do so. And then you have that massive NAS (any size, any specs) you want to store everything and you mount it via SMB/AFP/NFS shares to the NUC/Mini.  The only thing I would strongly recommend is to make sure both parts of the split system are wired (ethernet).  I do this with a 2012 i5 Mac Mini and a QNAP 870 mounted via AFP. Works like a charm and I can transcode about 3 simultaneous remote 720p streams before things start getting hot. If I'm just playing content on my main TV, it Direct Plays and there is no fuss."

Let say I'm watching a movie but my friend/wife wants to see what other things I have to queue up next. Can't do that with fire tv You have to use the remote and it's slow to browse when you have a large library like I do. Scrolling through stuff on my tablet or phone is 10 times faster I can use any devices to start/stop stuff or switch to the next content with Chromecast. The Firetv app can sorta do the same but it's clunky The fire tv app itself is terrible. It's just a software replica of the physical remote. They should have made it like an extension of the fire tv stick, let you browse your Plex contents or something while the fire TV is playing or show you the playlist etc."

PleX,3ddz0c,andy2na,2,Wed Jul 15 17:06:25 2015 UTC,"I think it works well as a secondary viewing device in a bedroom or when travelling (which is when I use mine.) There's issues with surround sound, which may be important for a living room, but not so much for a bedroom.   The Plex app is OK. It gets the job done, but it looks a bit dated. For example, the Settings menu is basically the Android app but stretched horizontally for TV. Actual playback quality is fine, and I guess that's what matters! The remote that comes with the Fire TV does the trick and I personally prefer having a physical UI & remote to a Chromecast.   Others prefer the simplicity of browsing on your phone and casting to a Chromecast. Neither approach is the 'right one', it's just personal preference."
PleX,3ddz0c,britishchris,2,Thu Jul 16 09:33:48 2015 UTC,I much prefer the Fire TV & Stick to Chromecast if only for the fact that I don't have to have my phone next to me as I use it. I bought one in yesterday's sale as well and it will be my 8th or 9th (gave some to family to access my server).

PleX,3dark5,DeepNorth,1 point,Wed Jul 15 07:50:53 2015 UTC,"So, I have a question. I have a Pi 2 that I am using as a server right now. I have a few movies on the SD card but obviously that is a rather limited storage solution.  I bought a simple hard drive tray that is connected to the Pi via USB. I am running Ubuntu (basically followed the guides from the Plex forums). I have no experience in Linux or anything but I can follow instructions and start to understand some of the things.  How do I get that external drive to properly mount so Plex can index the movies and file? I can view the folders and files from the Pi but the server is not picking them up in the scan.   DISCLAIMER: Yes I realize that the Pi will not likely be able to transcode and is underpowered. I want a low power device that I can leave on and have limited interaction with. Also, most of the movies I have on there are SD. Thank you."
PleX,3dark5,Luckyaussiebob,2,Wed Jul 15 12:12:35 2015 UTC,To keep from having to transcode use mkvtomp4. This program will repackage the video file and convert the video and audio to a Plex friendly format.  Works fast too.

Using Linux gives you the ability to strip it down to its core and install just the pieces you need to accomplish the task you want.   Having a full Windows install with add a lot to the overhead of the machine and steal resources. You'd be surprised how little CPU/RAM is used by the setup shown in this video. It isn't something you can achieve yet with Windows.   I did hear that Microsoft is working towards this model with an upcoming nano version that is super lightweight, possibly targeted at the IOT market, but I'm not 100% on that."
PleX,3dark5,fico,3,Wed Jul 15 01:43:35 2015 UTC,"upcoming nano version that is super lightweight, possibly targeted at the IOT market, but I'm not 100% on that.   There's two things coming up, but I don't think either of them quite fit the bill:   Windows 10 for IoT, which is a really stripped down product; runs on the Raspberry Pi 2, Intel Galileo, and some other dev boards like those. It's designed for interacting with hardware pins and sensors, and while it can run services and so on, the Pi's pretty underpowered to be a Plex transcoder...   Windows Nano Server, which is basically a stripped-down, containerised version of Windows Server with no local UI at all (all management is done via PowerShell remoting, SSH, and the remote server admin tools), and is apparently kinda weird at the moment.    The current iteration for a lightweight server is Server Core, which has a basic shell-only UI, and claims to be very stripped down and nothing-included-choose-what-you-want. Most people I've spoken to about it seem to think it's too much of a pain in the backside to administer for the relatively mediocre CPU, RAM and disk savings it provides, and I've heard Microsoft are pulling it soon in favor of Nano Server."

PleX,3davsp,redlandmover,1 point,Tue Jul 14 22:44:08 2015 UTC,"I have just been trying it, works pretty well but lacks some stuff that Yatse can do, for example:  With Yatse I have one-touch play on episodes, after I enter a show/season. With Kore I have to go into the show, then into episode tab, then episode, then click play.  The app appears to suffer from the same bad sync of watched/unwatched stuff - I can go into the tv shows section, watch an episode or two, but the only way to update the watched status is to swipe down manually when in the tv shows section, this appears to then update the fact that I have watched something.  It hasn't once remembered where I was in a movie or tv show episode, Yatse wasn't great but would occasionally ask me to resume from where I was.  I think Yatse still holds a lot over this, but they both suffer from the same thing that made me want to try out Plex in the first instance."
PleX,3davsp,meeekus,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:33:28 2015 UTC,"fair enough.  personally i use plex as my library, and then use plexbmc on xbmc for a client.   another option (since you mentioned that you don't plan on external viewing) is emby. plex is great, however to get the alot of the newer features you need to be plexpass; which while very worth it, isn't a great deal if you're just doing local content. i have yet to use emby, but it does hook up to xbmc and offers alot of the features of plex."
PleX,3davsp,johnpowell,2,Tue Jul 14 23:38:28 2015 UTC,"I gave Emby a quick bash, and can honestly say that both Plex and KODI are superior, it was marking things as watched as soon as I played something, the UI in the mobile app was slow as hell, I couldn't see a way to advance the slider along to change the position in the video.  Plex with the Yatse app would be perfect. I will see if ""PlexBMC"" integration works or not, though I suspect it would give me more headaches."

I suggest you continue with Kodi since you will have a much better ui in the app (albeit the bad watched/placesaver)."

Sharing with external devices whilst an interesting thing, is not something I can currently do (at least well) because my internet connection here isn't so great, fibre not available in my area yet.  That being said it pretty much seems to boil down to what I like more, the Yatse app vs the immediacy of Plex, and ultimately I think Plex will probably win based on it updating my watched stuff in real time.  I've not seen any alternative Plex remote apps for Android, are there any?  Lastly if it did what I required (i.e. streaming of content remotely) then I think that I would pay £50 for a Plex Pass, however it's currently $149.99 which is about £100 here, and sounds like it's going up in price too in the near future."

You combine all of your non-OS partitions into a single drive letter on Windows. You want more space, you add a new drive to the pool. It automatically balances files across the drives, and you can mark which folders you want duplicated for redundancy in case of a drive failure.  On Linux, use FlexRaid.  Yes what you want is possible, but why even split it up into separate partitions? Keep 1 big partition and keep all of your folders in that. If TV gets too big or Movies, you don't want to have to resize, repartition or any of that."

So using plex app on PS3/4 or iphone may not work as intended. If you port forward and your users access via browser it may work using the TP-link device mentioned ITT.

PleX,3da30j,gstuartj,2,Tue Jul 14 20:35:16 2015 UTC,"TL;DR: Two separate Plex instances each on their own WAN connection with users split between the two is, IMO, the best option.     Plex uses some very clever techniques in order to do SSL now via plex.tv.  When a user goes to plex.tv, plex has it's own DNS name for you based on your IP address. (You can read more about how that works here).  What this means, though, is that whenever a user goes to plex.tv it's going to only look up to one IP address.  Now, if plex had the ability to round robin DNS then this could be solved for you.  But they don't.  So using any conventional way to do this is not going to happen.   You have a few options that could potentially 'solve' the issue for you.    You set up round robin DNS on your own domain name, say, plex.mbeau88.com.  Where it will round robin users. This option would mean your users can never use plex.tv (Well, they could, but it would only ever route to one IP). This would most likely break any non-web based player like Android, iOS, etc.  You set up a bounce point with an end to end throughput >= 40Mbit/s (All traffic will get routed through this VPS / server) On that server, you configure an application layer load balancer such as Nginx or HAProxy to load balance between your two <ip's>:<plex_port>. You must whitelist (everyone else is blocked) traffic between your plex instance and the VPS. The reason you do this is that it prevents your Plex instance from calling back to plex.tv and registering a different IP than you want.* Then plex.tv thinks your VPS is your Plex instance, and your VPS load balances all traffic once it hits it (plex.tv is none the wiser at this point) You create two Plex boxes, both on a different WAN connection and split your users between the two. (This would be super easy if you are virtualizing your Plex server) You might actually be able to spin up two completely separate Plex instances each listening on a different port on the same machine but I've never tried that before.  You physically take your server, and colocate it in a data center.    Honestly, I'd do number 3.  But I have everything virtualized which makes it significantly easier.   Sorry if this is hard to follow, I've had a long day at work.    * Option 2 might not work (sorry), I'm not 100% sure on how the handshake works when Plex creates a dynamic DNS for you."
PleX,3da30j,anekdotos,1 point,Wed Jul 15 00:27:27 2015 UTC,"For option 2, if you VPN the Plex server through the VPS then it would probably be able to handshake normally as long as you already have a port proxy set up"

What I'm really wanting to know is how to (if possible) split the Plex streams between the two (load balancing).  Like 10 streams on one connection, 10 streams on the other.   I also have dual gigabit LAN cards on my server/computer, so maybe there's a software solution for load balancing the Plex server..."
PleX,3da30j,gstuartj,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:29:03 2015 UTC,"Bonding would be ideal, but it isn't going to be an option on residential accounts. Load balancing is what you'll want.  Your AC66U will handle load-balancing for your LAN, no new hardware required. (with Shibby Tomato or DD-WRT firmware) The problem is balancing incoming connections, since you'll have two separate public IP addresses.  The easiest way to do this is going to be round-robin DNS. That way each time a user does a lookup for your domain they will randomly get one of the two IPs and access Plex via that IP. There's no way for you to get 40Mbps up per stream, but this will at least enable you to balance the users between the two 20Mbps pipes."
PleX,3da30j,jamjopeanut,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:38:43 2015 UTC,"It's definitely possible, and not really that hard. I researched this a while back and found its easiest to just get a hardware device that's takes care of it all. I think TP-Link had the best one that I saw. I think it'd probably be cheaper for you to simply pay for a virtual server with far more bandwidth. You can also do it with any Linux box with two Ethernet ports."

I'm pretty sure it supports it out of the box with the latest firmware, but if not, you might want to try the Merlin firmware build.  It is based off the official Asus firmware, often containing bug fixes and extra features.  http://{Your Router's IP}/Advanced_WANPort_Content.asp  http://leonid.shevtsov.me/en/how-to-configure-dual-wan-on-asuswrt-routers  What you could do is a poor-man's load balancing.  Register a domain name and set up a DNS entry somewhere with 2 A records.  In BIND syntax, you'd have something like:  @ORIGIN mbeau88.com. plex IN A 1.2.3.4 plex IN A 5.6.7.8   Whatever DNS management tool you use (e.g. EasyDNS, DNSMadeEasy, Route53, etc) there are different ways of expressing that.  For example, in Route53, you'd just put both IP addresses into the text field.  In DNSMadeEasy, you need to create two records with the same name.  Now, you give out plex.mbeau88.com to your friends and family.  In theory, 50% of the time they'll access 1.2.3.4 and 50% of the time they'll access 5.6.7.8.  DNS load balancing cannot guarantee it will be 50/50...but you should kind of see it average out over time."

Load balancing is always going to be as fast as your single fastest under-utilized connection. Channel bonding combines parallel connections to make things faster.

Disk speed is probably not an issue, as most files will be streamed way slower over the network than your disk permits anyway. (If you have many user or extremely large rips, your mileage may vary.)  If you're running backups on your system disk, you probably want another backup regime that for your media library. Personally, I don't back up my media.  If you have your media files on a non-virtual file system, here are some advantages: * Your media files can be spread on several cheap disks on several servers. * You can easily expand the storage. You don't have to have your Plex server running to manipulate your media library (drop new movies in there, delete files, back up files, etc). * You can run your bit torrent client on another computer and drop them automatically in the library folders, or when you decide. * You can reach your files with other media players to replay files that for some reason doesn't work correctly in Plex.

You can copy or move that virtual disk around and attach it to another VM.   You can get as simple as just using USB hard drive passthrued to your VMs or as complicated as ZFS NASes for media storage.

PleX,3d7fph,Piku_Chan,3,Tue Jul 14 02:44:10 2015 UTC,Check if FFMPEG supports it and for how long it has. Plex tends to pickup the features after they are declared stable.
PleX,3d7fph,ElectroSpore,2,Tue Jul 14 02:53:05 2015 UTC,Since May it seems.
PleX,3d7fph,itoldyouiwouldeatyou,4,Tue Jul 14 02:59:14 2015 UTC,"Really? There are some limited options (NVENC) but it's not something Plex could just enable for everyone.  From the FFMPEG site:   Will a graphics card make x264 encode faster?  Not necessarily. ​x264 supports OpenCL for some lookahead operations. There are also some proprietary encoders that utilize the GPU, but that does not mean they are well optimized, though encoding time may be faster; and they might be ​worse than vanilla x264, and possibly slower.   Regardless, FFmpeg today doesn't support any means of GPU encoding, outside of libx264."
PleX,3d7fph,ElectroSpore,2,Tue Jul 14 06:54:33 2015 UTC,Give it a minimum of 6mo to a year to make its way into the Plex code then.

I'd just like to use Intel Quicksync as that seems to about triple encoding performance in handbrake, but I'm concerned that the quality will suffer."
PleX,3d7fph,nebhead,2,Tue Jul 14 14:19:41 2015 UTC,"Yep, if Quicksync could somehow be leveraged, that would be a seriously killer feature.  Please plex devs... pleeeasse!"

Seperate these series into seperate folders and Plex should be able to distinct the differences.

PleX,3d4mqa,antiproton,3,Mon Jul 13 19:36:15 2015 UTC,"There is a lubricant applied to the platter.  The head flies a few angstroms above the platter.     Platters are typically made using an aluminium or glass and ceramic substrate. In disk manufacturing, a thin coating is deposited on both sides of the substrate, mostly by a vacuum deposition process called magnetron sputtering. The coating has a complex layered structure consisting of various metallic (mostly non-magnetic) alloys[clarification needed] as underlayers, optimized for the control of the crystallographic orientation and the grain size of the actual magnetic media layer on top of them, i.e. the film storing the bits of information. On top of it a protective carbon-based overcoat is deposited in the same sputtering process. In post-processing a nanometer thin polymeric lubricant layer gets deposited on top of the sputtered structure by dipping the disk into a solvent solution, after which the disk is buffed by various processes[clarification needed] to eliminate small defects and verified by a special sensor on a flying head for absence of any remaining impurities or other defects (where the size of the bit given above roughly sets the scale for what constitutes a significant defect size). In the hard-disk drive the hard-drive heads fly and move radially over the surface of the spinning platters to read or write the data. Extreme smoothness, durability, and perfection of finish are required properties of a hard-disk platte   source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_disk_drive_platter#Manufacture"
PleX,3d4mqa,iamajs,2,Mon Jul 13 20:08:59 2015 UTC,"You still implied that heat, breaking down the lubricant, would cause HDD failure by, presumably, friction. This is false.   There's no source on that wikipedia article for the lubricant claim, but if true, it seems to be there for the purpose of the final buffing to remove imperfections.   The lubricant is NOT there for the benefit of the drive head. The drive head does ride on a cushion of air, and friction between the air and the platter is required to keep the air rotating, providing lift for the drive head.   Excessive heat IS bad for a hard drive, but it has nothing to do with the lubricant applied to the surface of the platter. Instead, as with all moving metal parts, heat can cause expansion of the metal and, given the extremely tight tolerance in a hard disk, this can cause the motor to seize or the arm to warp just enough to cause a head crash."
PleX,3d4mqa,nonya-in,1 point,Mon Jul 13 21:19:19 2015 UTC,"My post was poorly worded, I meant to point out that excessive heat will break down the protective lubricant on the disk.. contributing to a failure in the case of a head crash (not directly causing).  The thermal expansion of the actuator/arm/heads is taken into account when the controller adjusts the fly height of the heads.  This technology is called adaptive fly height.  In fact, the controller adjusts the height constantly using heat and the thermal expansion property of the assembly.  Its true there is lift from the air circulating in the disk, its really neat how the heads basically ""fly"", but that is only part of the fly height control.  You are right the tolerances are extremely tight.  The cushion of air between the lubricant on the disk and the head is only a few atoms thick.  All the more reason the lubricant is necessary.  Perhaps my information on heat breaking down the lubricant is not entirely accurate, however it did come directly from very smart and experienced hard drive engineers."
PleX,3d4mqa,iamajs,2,Mon Jul 13 21:54:23 2015 UTC,"That lubricant layer is used in the various buffing operations in the platter manufacture.  It is not used, as you seem to indicate, as a lubricant for the drive heads.  This is indicated by the following from your cite: ""In post-processing a nanometer thin polymeric lubricant layer gets deposited on top of the sputtered structure by dipping the disk into a solvent solution, after which the disk is buffed by various processes[clarification needed] to eliminate small defects""  I will cite: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_crash  ""A head normally rides on a thin film of moving air entrapped at the surface of its platter (some drives of the mid-1990s used a thin liquid layer instead)[citation needed]. The topmost layer of the platter is made of a Teflon-like material that acts like a lubricant. Underneath is a layer of sputtered carbon. These two layers protect the magnetic layer (data storage area) from most accidental touches of the read-write head.[1]""  The head uses an air gap as the primary ""lubricant"" any coating on the platter is secondary rather than primary to reducing wear and increasing reliability.  Any continuous  contact with a material rotating at 5,400-15,000 RPM will result in excessive heat and wear and would dramatically shorten the life of the drive.   So while technically there is a lubricant on the platter, that lubricant is not primarily there for the heads to travel over.  So I stand by my original statement."
PleX,3d4mqa,nonya-in,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:15:52 2015 UTC,"I don't think you realize how close these heads fly across the platter.  This distance is measured in angstroms (an angstrom is the size of an atom).  The air gap you mention is virtually non-existent to the point where the lubricant is necessary to protect the media.  I've worked on projects where we were calibrating this fly height (and this was back in 2007), I can't really comment about the technology today.. but I'd presume its even more advanced."
PleX,3d4mqa,nonya-in,1 point,Tue Jul 14 13:29:50 2015 UTC,"Actually, I do understand exactly how close to the platter the heads fly, but they do ride a cushion of air, which is in fact critical to using the drive, that was my point.  Think of the heads of a hard drive like a hovercraft.  Without the air you can't easily move the craft without damaging both the craft and the surface (heads and platters), with that small cushion of air it will glide over the surface with ease.  Don't believe me?  Put a drive in a vacuum chamber, pump out the air and run the drive.  Just make sure the drive doesn't have any data you care about before you perform the test.  ;)"

RE: Hard Drive issues, as others have stated having your drives in constant use is actually better for them. It is less wear and tear on the motor to maintain the speed of the spinning platters than it is to start and stop them frequently.   Despite that, iMacs definitely do not have a server-grade hard drive in them, so YMMV in regards to life expectations of said drive. If it is starting to die out you might consider replacing it with something made for constant use, or at least have a backup system in place along with your new drive."
PleX,3d4mqa,Stevo32792,2,Mon Jul 13 20:48:02 2015 UTC,"All electronics, over time, eventually fail.  Mechanical failure would be your first symptom and eventually followed by the CPU/Mobo due to capacitors failing or even leakage in the CPU.   Generally speaking, your mechanical HD would be the first to fail.  Even if you had just 1 stream going, all the time, the HD is taking a lot of strain that consumer HDs just are not made for.  Either a head with crash, or the platters will just refuse to change states.  This leads to bad sectors.  Pay attention to your SMART readings to try to predict this before complete failure.  Enterprise drives would perform better and longer, but cost a considerable bit more. Motherboard Failure...  Capacitors fail, BIOS crashes, etc.  If you browse /r/techsupportgore a bit, i am sure you can find a few pictures.  Simply one popped Cap on your mobo and you are toast!  The only fix at that point is a new Mobo.  More strain on the entire computer may put the Mobo at more risk, but there is no easy way to tell. Eventually, even the CPU will faill.  This is likey due to an effect known as Leakage https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leakage_(electronics)#In_semiconductors.  As the pathways in CPUs get smaller and smaller, it is more and more likely that electrons can hop (crosstalk) from one pathway to another.  It may burn through the insulation entirely!  If this happens enough times, you will notice degraded performance and eventually complete system failure.  Here is another article on semiconductor aging.  http://spectrum.ieee.org/semiconductors/processors/transistor-aging   As for your setup... I would say pay attention to those HDs.  I know Windows will display an error from Event Viewer when it detects that a HD is having SMART errors.  I recently had to replace one of my older 1TB drives due to this.  Luckily i had 2TB upgrades ready to go and was able to copy the data to the new drive.  The old drive actually failed the next day, so you may not have a lot of time!"

PleX,3d4mqa,PigSlam,2,Mon Jul 13 21:56:45 2015 UTC,"Electronics do wear out but not the point where'd they be significantly or even noticeably slower. What happens most of the time is the the system stops being able to deal with heat as efficiently. Any number of things can be affecting temperatures.   The thermal paste between the CPU and GPU heatsinks is usually the biggest culprit. Overtime it becomes less effective, meaning they can't dissipate heat as well, hurting performance. On a normal desktop, this isn't a difficult fix. Just remove the easily accesible heatsink, clean the thermal paste off the CPU and heatsink with tissues and 99% isopropyl alcohol, and apply new paste and reattach the heatsink. On laptops and iMacs, it pretty much requires taking the entire thing apart and putting back together again, and removing the from screen an iMac to get inside is one of the toughest home repair jobs out there. Dust. Self-explanatory, gets in vents slows down fans and airflow. Fan efficiency and fan speed. Fans are mechanical devices too. They can get slower, not adjust speeds properly, especially if temperatures in other parts of the system are not properly balanced. Power supplies become less efficient over time as well, especially if the system is on all the time. That means they more energy is released as heat.   As far as mechanical HDDs go. They will all fail eventually, it's not a matter if but when. But it's possible that your HDD is fine but is having problems because of heat generated from the other components. I wish these things were easy fixes on an iMac, but sadly they're not."

If there were an SSD, and if PMS were primarily a write-heavy service instead of a read-heavy service, this could decrease the life of the SSD slightly. Those don't come standard in a 2011 iMac.  The CPU, all the other components... doesn't wear them out anymore than if no one was streaming. In fact, if he was powering down the machine often, this would wear it out more than leaving it on.

PleX,3d36o5,solarbeat,5,Mon Jul 13 03:55:37 2015 UTC,My first guess and yes it is a guess is the network on the Surface.  I see the Surface does not have an ethernet port but only a USB 3.0....so are you connecting via that?  Is your adapter 2.0 or 3.0 based?  Are you sure that you have the wireless on the Surface disabled?  Could be that both are connected and Plex is randomly going via the wireless?  That is where I would personally start the battle.
PleX,3d36o5,CaptAngryPants,8,Mon Jul 13 04:17:39 2015 UTC,"I think Capt Angry Pants is onto something but for maybe a different reason than he would think. For testing purposes, I would definitely try the wireless mode to see if that changes your performance at all.  Reason? USB 3.0 ethernet is going to be a CPU driven interface, and any network transfer which occurs is going to take a potentially not insignificant CPU utilization to perform the transfer, which is competing against the transcoder.  Wireless on the other hand will be handled by usually a pcie wifi addon card which should have the tcp offload engine."
PleX,3d36o5,togetherwem0m0,2,Mon Jul 13 12:40:05 2015 UTC,"I am going to agree with this idea as it was my next area of attack thinking it is a software driven issue.  Also, are there updates for drivers for the usb nic, the usb controller or similar?  If you have access to spare USB nics, try different types.  Just a quick google pops up issues with the USB controller on the Surface with different types of USB drives....could similar hidden incompatibles be showing up here."
PleX,3d36o5,CaptAngryPants,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:42:43 2015 UTC,"Yes, it's connecting via a USB 3.0 Gigabit Ethernet Adapter, over CAT6 -- in fact, I replaced the USB 2.0 adapter I had laying around. I've confirmed that the wireless adapter is turned off."
PleX,3d36o5,firstsnowfall,1 point,Mon Jul 13 05:00:20 2015 UTC,What you can do is this. Download and install netspeedmonitor to watch outgoing bandwidth. Also have task manager running to monitor cpu usage. See what happens when videos buffer. Is CPU spiking to 100? Then that's bottleneck. Could be network too if network is moving too slow
PleX,3d36o5,Kaysauce,2,Mon Jul 13 13:51:48 2015 UTC,"Before I side with CaptAngryPants, what does the playback look like in web/PMS on the Surface itself?  If you're able to scrub through videos there, it's completely possible that your wireless clients aren't getting what they need from your router.  I'd test it on your Surface Pro, and if that works well see if you can hardwire another client, performing similar tests.  I'm fully willing to bet that you'll be replacing that Surface in this setup, though.  I can't imagine a tablet (even a beefy one) handling transcodes of 12gig 1080p rips gracefully before serving it to any Apple device or Vizio TV."
PleX,3d36o5,Goinsandrew,1 point,Mon Jul 13 04:35:52 2015 UTC,"Playback is... satisfactory on the Surface itself, about the same as on a Macbook Pro Retina (i7). Testing the same file being served off the Surface versus off the NAS showed a tiny difference (NAS being a smidgen slower, but still okay).  Oddly enough, playing the same file using the iOS app on my iPhone, it was significantly quicker, by a few orders of magnitude. (test file was a 1080P MP4 H264 ~10000 bit rate)  The Surface has been performing admirably, as far as I can tell. The CPU is (should be) more than enough to do at least 1 1080P stream (though most of my clients should be doing directplay anyway), though I do have an old i7-3770 sitting around that I was thinking of building a new Plex server around.   I'm beginning to wonder if the Chromecasts and Apple TVs are severely underperforming, as they're the most problematic. They all show nearly full signal, and both are 802.11n. Maybe the extra hop in the NAS->Plex Server->iPhone/iPad->AppleTV path is the weak link?"
PleX,3d36o5,Crocoduck_The_Great,3,Mon Jul 13 05:06:25 2015 UTC,"Desktop CPU's generally outperform their mobile ""equivalent"" so that i7 may be your best bet. You could try optimizing your video files to direct play to your clients so transcoding isn't even needed."

Lots of routers let you set up QoS rules or traffic control which can be done in a myriad of ways, like users/groups ip/mac protocol/port. I have my router set up like this, basically anyone that connects is throttled until they're added as a user on the router, then after they are added they become part of a group, each group has it's own broad throttling and the individual activity they're doing has limits on bandwidth by protocols.
