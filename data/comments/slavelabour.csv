As a matter of fact, there's nothing more refreshing than a cold splash of water that can invigorate the body and the soul. Water is not only a useful resource, but it is necessary in order to sustain life. However, the average American doesn't spend time really planning how to store excess water for use in the future if necessary. In this essay, I will explain how to convert a generic tool shed into a storage facility for fresh, clean water. You'll find that building a watershed is simple and having access to clean, clear water that has been stored in your very own watershed can really help during those dry summer months when a little bit of extra water can make a big difference."

slavelabour,3cvw56,ilikewc3,-9,Sat Jul 11 07:38:07 2015 UTC,"Everybody is entitled to their own opinions, and I respect that. You may wish to leave this thread if you believe this is ""absolutely terrible"". If you truly believe that this is to a point of, unethical, then you may wish to report me, along with this thread.  By the same token, there is obviously a reason why this is listed in the slavelaboursubreddit. I have a limited budget and cannot afford to spend thousands on a small essay database. Further expanding on this idea, I am also providing students a  of source of income, however little it may be - by selling their school essays. These are the same school essays which would probably have been left in a folder on their computer, and thrown away eventually. So ask yourself, why not?"
slavelabour,3cvw56,Corndog_Enthusiast,2,Sat Jul 11 20:48:37 2015 UTC,"Come on, we're not actually slaves... make it AT LEAST $1.01 and we might consider it..."
slavelabour,3cvw56,ilikewc3,1 point,Sat Jul 11 21:32:49 2015 UTC,I appreciate your sense of humour
slavelabour,3cvw56,BackburnerPyro,1 point,Sat Jul 11 23:37:47 2015 UTC,"Change it to a dollar per 650 words, otherwise your offer is bullshit. Even then, it sucks dick considering students pay up to 20 bucks a page if they have to buy a paper. I don't actually care but I'd like otherwise naive students to understand that you're being predatory."
slavelabour,3cvw56,devler,0,Sat Jul 11 21:51:30 2015 UTC,"Calling me to be predatory is simply ridiculous on your behalf.  I don't know how you spent your academic years, but paying $20 for a page of essay is simply unheard of in Canada, at least where I am from. If that was how you had spent your school years, then I would feel sorry for you.  Regarding the price, this is simply my offering. If students believe it is unfair, we don't have to follow through with the transaction. I am certainly not forcing them into anything. Secondly, however outrageous my offers maybe, to you, it does not concern you one bit. I appreciate the fact you are trying to give an honest warning to all the fellow students here, but again, none of your business.  As long as there are those who are happy with this offer, I will continue to purchase those essays, until I have reached my quota.   You may continue to down vote me, or report me to the admins at your hearts content. I fail to see, because I know that, I am not doing anything wrong, unethical, or being ""predatory"" as you described.  Feel free to comment here and I will do my best to try and reply to you as I see fit. I am not too busy today anyway."
slavelabour,3cvw56,BackburnerPyro,5,Sun Jul 12 00:00:53 2015 UTC,http://www.myessays.com/sell.php  You can sell essays here for a minimum of $7.50 after fees.

slavelabour,3cvw56,rainbowshabmagic,1 point,Sat Jul 11 10:57:05 2015 UTC,"I have more essays for you (you bought 5/6 from me) but I'd like a bit more payment. 1 dollar per is simply too little.  Also I will point out that you promise $1 per essay, but the seller actually receives less because you neglect to cover paypal fees (and you also neglect to mention there being fees)."
slavelabour,3cvw56,colafrank,-6,Sun Jul 12 05:29:26 2015 UTC,"If you feel like 1 dollar is too little, then I'm sorry, but that is all I can provide. I am unsure of what ""a bit more payment"" is. Are you talking about $5? Or perhaps $10? If so, you might as well go rob a bank. Try selling your essays somewhere for that amount, I would be surprised if any legit organization would take them for anything higher than $5.   You have to keep in mind that these are mostly HIGH SCHOOL level essays we are talking about. Do you honestly believe that people would be investing upwards of $10 for a high school essay, that could be of any quality? Even if you achieved an ""A"" on the essay, the marking regime may be different else where. Your ""A"" could well be a ""B-"" here.  As for the Paypal fees. I have no control over it. That is how Paypal works.   Once again, 1 dollar is my offer. If you are not happy with it, leave it. For those that believe it is acceptable, take it.   It is unbelievable how much hate I am getting for this simple task. If I was truly looking for HQ college papers, I wouldn't be posting here. It is called ""slave labor"" for a reason.  I hope you can all take some time and read the side bar.   Slave labor: It is a place to get jobs done well below market rate. Any tasks (within reason!) for any amount. Find casual online work. Earn a few dollars here and there completing small tasks. It will soon add up!"
slavelabour,3cvw56,BackburnerPyro,-3,Sun Jul 12 06:45:52 2015 UTC,"I checked my email and realized that you are sending me essays from the 9th and 10th grade.  I mean no harm but, go ahead and try to sell your essays for more than $5, ANYWHERE.   This reminds me of an old quote: I give you an inch, and you take a mile."
