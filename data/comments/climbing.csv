I only use it for static protection though, I would never use a sling as a PAS if I wanted to work on a particular section of a climb off belay, for example - although it would probably hold, other systems transfer much less energy to the last point of security, such as a PAS made from dynamic rope.  That being said, personally I would never use a PAS for such a purpose anyway, but I know there are people out there that do."

climbing,3e310v,SandalsMan,5,Tue Jul 21 16:51:40 2015 UTC,I use a nylon sling for this. Dynema looses more strength in nots and a nylon sling has a bit of stretch reducing shock loading. I also try to rig things so shock loading isn't a possibility but I like that there is a bit of stretch in the system should I get hit by a rock and fall off the belay ledge or something crazy like that.
climbing,3e310v,micro_cam,2,Tue Jul 21 16:58:05 2015 UTC,Have you a source for that?  Why should dynema loose more strength? Static load ofc.
climbing,3e310v,Alx_xl,4,Tue Jul 21 18:59:51 2015 UTC,It is pretty well known and there are tons of references on why you shouldn't knot dynema:  dmm test results  a broken girth hitched sling incident in the field  one of the oldest references i remember  AMGA manual  climbing anchors
climbing,3e310v,micro_cam,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:13:34 2015 UTC,I see.  I knew it weakens the sling but in the charts i saw it wasn't that big of a difference between the materials.   For me my rule of thumb is/were a knot is 50%strength.

climbing,3e310v,toastiesguy,4,Tue Jul 21 19:46:23 2015 UTC,"Many people, myself included, use a knotted sling as a PAS. Just be sure to use an overhand knot and dress it properly. You can weight it in any of the loops.   A few of the more frugal minded friends I have make fun of me for using an actual PAS as opposed to just a knotted sling. I use both. The PAS is a little more versatile in that the length is so much easier to get right. I usually start with the knotted sling for one safety and then use the PAS to adjust to the right length for the other (in a two safety situation)."

A traditional daisy chain isn't preferred because it's easy to clip across two loops, which break under small loads."
climbing,3e310v,redlude97,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:19:18 2015 UTC,You will be fine I use hand tied slings all the time for my personal anchor but I also like using my end of the rope as a personal anchor just do a clove hitch on a locking carabiner and put it on your anchor.

climbing,3e310v,redlude97,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:36:09 2015 UTC,"How do you figure it's more adjustable? A purcell prussik is only adjustable from its minimum length to twice its minimum length. The metolius pas on the other hand is adjustable from 1 loop to 6 loops or 6 times its minimum size.   It's cheap yeah, but pretty much inferior to something like the metolius pas in every way."
climbing,3e310v,hiddengulley,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:35:51 2015 UTC,"i was referring to a knotted sling, but it doesn't matter either way. the adjustability simply isn't needed more than that range, and you can make one for 1/10 of the cost of the met. PAS. Plenty of us clean with qds or a chain of qds and never have an issue, and when you are climbing multi, the rope has infinite adjustability."

climbing,3e2ld3,Cragzilla,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:56:52 2015 UTC,I just read an article about Dyneema slings rapidly losing strength with age1 (from >22kn to <16kn in 3-5 years).  It would be a shame if that means these lighter cams with a Dyneema core have to be retired much sooner than the old C4s :/  1 DAV Panorama 04.2015 P.58-61
climbing,3e2ld3,McMa,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:41:39 2015 UTC,16kn is still more than the c4 strength... I wonder what the curve looks like over time? Hockey stick or linear or...?
climbing,3e2ld3,tinyOnion,2,Tue Jul 21 15:27:14 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the question is: is the dyneema involved in typical modes of failure? If not, then a decrease in the strength of the dyneema will likely have no effect on the overall strength of the cam."
climbing,3e2ld3,aplusbi,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:52:33 2015 UTC,I seem to recall that it seems like a lot of the time the cams break at the metal thumb loop so perhaps this will make them stronger than normal at least initially.
climbing,3e2ld3,tinyOnion,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:16:09 2015 UTC,"The thumb loop is usually the failure point. The ultralights have a 2kn lower rating than normal C4s, so I would expect the ultralight thumb loops will fail at 2kn less than the wired thumb loops."

climbing,3e2ld3,McMa,2,Tue Jul 21 16:31:50 2015 UTC,"I also wonder if the dyneema core will lose it's strength as quickly as a dyneema sling, as it will be protected from UV and from constant bending and abrasion.

Its a lot of extra cost for not much benefit unless you plan on doing a lot of climbing in wet weather. I got my rope on amazon for pretty cheap actually. It was on sale one week.

climbing,3e30yf,iclimbnaked,2,Tue Jul 21 17:30:53 2015 UTC,Even damp isnt really an issue. Dry treated ropes are mainly for alpine or ice climbing. They do help your rope last a little longer but the dry coating wears off with use anyways.  Its just as safe as long as your rope isnt getting seriously wet. You shouldn't lead on a wet rope because it absorbs less energy.   tldr: Its perfectly safe for outdoors.

climbing,3e0w8m,jmutter3,3,Tue Jul 21 03:51:56 2015 UTC,"Yeah, for sport climbing I'd much rather have a slightly harder catch with a backup than more potential for human error.  Way more accident reports feature a belayer spacing out/panicking/getting knocked unconscious/burning their hands than feature life threatening injuries/broken gear because of hard catches.  It's true that ""a good belayer with an ATC is the best catch"" but belayer error, even with a rock solid belayer, is always probably close to the #1 risk.  Trad is a completely different case, because while your belayer is still a human that might screw up, the risk of gear pulling out is such a huge concern that the relative risk of belayer goes down.  For what it's worth, there's a chart a third of the way down this page that would indicate you get a much softer catch on the tube style assisted locking devices (e.g. the Mega Jul I use) than the gri gri, so kinda the best of both worlds."

Photography and Videography go hand in hand with rock climbing because of the same reasons many people like to climb in the first place, to gain a better perspective of the natural beauty around the climb (at least, that is a huge reason why I enjoy climbing).  The feeling of exposure cannot be beaten through photo or video, but I do not have anything against sharing the experiences and trying to recreate it.  This is one reason why many Nat Geo photographers climb, the sport offers vantages unseen to the common world, which is what Nat Geo is all about.  As technology advances, so do our vantages for photography and video.  Drones are a huge stepping stone in that because they offer amazing perspectives of scale that would be impossible to reach normally.  This also wasn't your average drone with a GoPro on it, unless I'm mistaken.  This looks like a very skilled videographer using high end equipment, just like some of the best videographers and photographers in the world are doing right now such as Paul Nicklen."

climbing,3e3np6,NterMyVoid,9,Tue Jul 21 19:29:39 2015 UTC,"Say you were in a group of walkers, and you decide to have lunch at the bottom of a sport crag:   I ask because I was having lunch last weekend, in a pretty crowded area and there was a guy climbing next to me. One of my walking partners knew the guy to be an experienced climber, but I still couldn't help but be angry with the him. If he falls and dies or breaks his neck, we have to deal with it. We have to watch it happen, and call an ambulance, and deal with the fact that we watched someone die. There were probably 10 people within eye sight of him, including children. I don't see him as brave, I see him as selfish. Am I alone here? What are the communities thoughts on it? When is it appropriate to climb, and when is it not?   ""Ah, but sport climbing isn't crazy risky!"" I hear you say. And the soloist thinks the same thing. In both cases one party considers it an acceptable risk and other party does not.  But who's right? Nobody, as there is no such thing as a universally acceptable level of risk. You just have to accept that some people are happy accepting a greater level of risk than you are."
climbing,3e3np6,the_birds_and_bees,-2,Tue Jul 21 19:27:25 2015 UTC,"I think there's such a thing as acceptable levels of risk within any given community, and everyone at the crag is a climber.  If I was at a major mecca for speed walkers and decided to, I dunno, play russian roulette, that'd be uncool.  Free soloing is so far outside the normal level of risk that I'm comfortable calling it totally uncool at a busy crag. It's fine if you want to do it off on your own, but most people don't want to be part of it.    Like sailing on the high seas, there's obviously a code among people who hang out in wilderness areas.  If something bad happens and I'm there, I have to help. His blood is going to get on me while I try to help. Since the consequences of his bad decisions are going to be forced onto me and my family, my only option is to leave the crag. Which I've done in the past when people were doing super sketchy shit.

If I'm bothered or I don't want to witness someone get hurt that day, I'll leave the crag. As offensive as I may find free soloing, I have no right to ask someone not to do it, in the same way that nobody has a right to ask me not to trad climb, or sport climb.  Personally, I find free soloing dumb. Holds break, feet slip, jams get sweaty."
climbing,3e3np6,PatrickBecerra,2,Tue Jul 21 20:16:56 2015 UTC,"I see climbing as a problem solving sport. Safety is one aspect of the problem to be solved.

That's not to say I don't push the limits, I just try to be as safe as one can possibly be when it comes to climbing.   I see free solo-ing as an adrenaline rush sport.

I cant help but look in awe when I see Honnold soloing something difficult.  I wouldnt say you cant do it with anyone near by but doing it at a crowded crag especially with children seems irresponsible because you are right if he falls it becomes everyone theres problem. Could even be traumatizing to people.  I wouldnt go so far as to say Id be angry with him about it but I would say its irresponsible with that many people around.  I dont think its bad to do as a whole, I would never but at the same time the better you get, the less crazy freesoloing easy things seems."

Recreational climbing is one of the most incredible of human activities. You can't get your rush from leading 5.12 trad or pushing your grade on sport? Highball bouldering too tame for you?  Sure, there are people who can confidently onsight 12+. Good for you. Plenty of experienced, strong climbers have died out there when something went wrong. A rock that stuck in place for millions of years finally decides to give. The weather turns on you. A long night of drinking has sapped your endurance, but you're not brave enough to say ""I can't do this today."" Ironic, that one.   There are probably more Honnolds out there than I realize. Yoesmite is likely full of them - a sort of strongman shangri-la. It must be a wonderful feeling. But when I'm out for a day of fun leadiing 5.9s at a local crag in the middle of who-gives-a-shits-ville, and some hot head is out free soloing his project - guess what? You're ruining my day. You're stressing everyone out. And if today is the day that you're not at your best, you're very close to inflicting us all with the nightmare of dealing with your fall and the possible PTSD that comes with dealing with your broken and bleeding body for the final 15 minutes of your life.

The hero worship that goes on for free soloing is what I'm really pissed about.

Sometimes this will sling shot it out of whatever it's stuck on.  -jug up (bummer)  -set up a 3:1 and pull as hard as you can using your weight.  Alternatively you can do it to the other side if you are thinking that the rope ended up stuck between the slings/rapp rings/whatever at the top.  this could free it."
climbing,3dyvye,robxburninator,8,Mon Jul 20 21:21:09 2015 UTC,"Classic problem of rope stuck on the pull. Depending on how stuck it is, how far you are from the ground, how much rope you have left, and what the terrain looks like between you and the rappel anchor, you have increasingly desperate options.  If you are on the ground already, breathe a sigh of relief.   You can:  -Jiggle the rope -Jump on it. Clip in with a grigri, jump up on the pull side, and yard in as much slack as you can. Repeat. If this doesn't work, yard in more, then have your partner jump on you. -Do the same thing on the other side. -Walk out to way out to the side on your pull side and try from another angle. Do the same with the other side.  If this still doesn't work, proceed...  2) If you are not on the ground:  -Do you have both ends? If yes, do the things from the above section (stay clipped in), tether both ends to your current anchor.  -If you don't have both ends, can you easily reach the other end?  -If can't reach the other end, do you have enough rope to lead on, and reach the other end? If so, try to retrieve the other end. Tether both ends to the anchor, grab a grigri or something similar, and clip into the pull end. Then use it as an ascender with the anchor as the counterweight. You can climb/jug up on it until you hit the knot (tying catastrophe knots as needed), fix it, then rappel on the same line.  Other options: -If you have enough rope, you can lead up to the knot with what you got and clear it. -If you don't have enough, you have to lead up in sections, build an intermediate, bring your partner up, and then repeat until you get up to the knot.  If you only have one end, you are several pitches up, the terrain above you is unclimbable, and you don't have enough rope remaining to cut it and get down, you are pretty fucked.  Your only option here is pretty much cry, call for help, or as a very very last option, jug the remaining end that you have and pray to jesus that whatever it is caught on will hold."

Ascending the rope is probably the best thing to do in that situation as anything else has the potential to make it worse. That said, I've heard people using a 3:1 pulley system to pull on the rope. No personal experience with this method, however, and I personally would only do it if I felt that ascending the rope wasn't a safe option."

I've had my ropes fall into a notch where one strand is sitting on top of the other so it basically works like a reverso in guide mode. We could pull the wrong rope which was unhelpful, but as soon as we tried to pull the correct strand it locked up immediately. No amount of pulling harder is going to help in that situation.

climbing,3dzd0z,clubfootsmear,3,Mon Jul 20 22:26:23 2015 UTC,"I hope you never lead climb because you'll whip on single anchor points all the time. What do you think is going to happen if you clip the first bolt, climb to the 2nd, fall, and the first bolt breaks? What do you think is going to happen if you clip that 2nd bolt, are going for the third, fall, and the 2nd bolt breaks? You'll most likely have so much rope out that the first bolt won't even matter."
climbing,3dzd0z,kaptainkayak,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:14:20 2015 UTC,"I agree with you. I think hes talking about TR. I have taken a few whippers, but none scarier than reaching to clip into the second bolt."
climbing,3dzd0z,Sutekhy,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:02:44 2015 UTC,"Wait... it's fine to whip on a single anchor on lead, but on top rope it's sketchy?"
climbing,3dzd0z,Durbanpoisonyo,4,Tue Jul 21 15:59:28 2015 UTC,"The difference is height and time. On lead, you're on a single anchor for the beginning of the route, but redundancy is increased with each new bolt. On TR, (in this case) the single anchor is the only protection you have for the whole duration and height of the route. You can fall a lot farther if your single TR anchor breaks than you would if a bolt breaks on lead."
climbing,3dzd0z,ImMadeOfRice,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:23:43 2015 UTC,"While that's true, it's many times more likely that a bolt should blow on lead, especially on the first half of the route, than on top rope. I'm not saying that top roping on a single bolt is a great idea, but the risk is definitely much higher on lead, even though the consequences are usually not as severe."

climbing,3dw6lj,akci,8,Mon Jul 20 04:01:30 2015 UTC,"When things fall into water they almost never fall straight down.

To sum it up: when they drain the lake you can sport and trad climb in the lake bed. When they fill it up during the summer those same routes are still there, but with lots of water below them. Getting to the areas we went to was quite easy. A short hike then a short swim is all you need. We rented life vests and just swam out to the climbs and hung out by the wall all day. Last year we got a pontoon boat and anchored near the climbs (way more fun). But both are super chill and great."

Maestri declared that Egger had the camera with the pictures of the summit, but this camera was never found. Inconsistencies in Maestri's account, and the lack of bolts, pitons or fixed ropes on the route, have led most mountaineers to doubt Maestri's claim. Patagonia gallery: https://flic.kr/s/aHsj7oNh5i"

It's not really an inconvenience, especially if they just finished a route and are taking a break. I've seen plenty of people who aren't comfortable with people they brought who aren't new belayers and ask someone else to belay for them."
climbing,3dvto4,ARQBZAK,9,Mon Jul 20 00:16:12 2015 UTC,"Not at all.  I mean, sometimes you may see my normal belay partner and I doing laps and sweating like a hooker in church.  We may not want to get interrupted mid swing.  But other times we are relaxing and more casually climbing.  Feel free to jump in and ask for a belay.  I can and have.  Especially for new climbers stuck on the auto belays.  I think the key is look for folks casually climbing.  Not intently focused or working up a sweat.  Just like any other gym.  It's generally ok to walk up to someone and ask a question or talk if they are standing around relaxing.  Not so much if they are mid stroke on the bench with 225 above them, or 10 miles into a treadmill run...  I've never said no.  Just introduce yourself and ask for a belay.  Worst they can say is no.  I'd figure most people would say yes.  But what other said here is correct.  Don't take an hour on the route.  If you are struggling after a while, ask to be lowered.    Also, have your friend learn how to belay.  It's pretty rude to ask for a belay and not be able to give one.  Not that I would expect you to.  But if the end game is to make friends and partners, you should probably get on that."
climbing,3dvto4,FluxxxCapacitard,7,Mon Jul 20 00:58:17 2015 UTC,"Perfectly acceptable, just pick a route you're not gonna have to hang dog, or if you do end up falling or taking more than a couple times just come down. I have seen someone ask for a belay from a stranger then take about 15 minutes to do the climb hanging about half the time, don't be that guy."
climbing,3dvto4,Befozz,7,Mon Jul 20 00:32:46 2015 UTC,"Not bad etiquette, but I've been the person approached before and here's the effect. If I'm climbing with 2 others, one of us is the odd man out in the rotation, but we went to the gym together to climb together. If someone approaches asking for a belay, it breaks up our rotation. I'm happy to help out once, but I've also had guys that assumed this meant we were now climbing together for the entire evening, which would completely split up my group and leave me with hanging out with someone I don't know."
climbing,3dvto4,pinkshirtfedora,6,Mon Jul 20 01:16:05 2015 UTC,"I don't top rope much anymore, but when I was in this position a lot I would try to talk with the prospective partner a bit first: ""hey, what're you guys working on? do you want some beta for that move?""  If they're really receptive to the conversation and seem friendly enough, I might offer to belay them first: ""hey, I see your buddies paired up, did you want to run a few laps on something?"" If this goes well, they'll almost always respond in kind."
climbing,3dvto4,kennethsime,5,Mon Jul 20 00:15:06 2015 UTC,It all depends on how it is done and the situation both the person asking and being asked are in.  A lot of gyms have a system where people who are looking for climbing partners can sign up on a white board or something to make it easier for others in similar situations can find them.  Maybe suggest this to your gym?

climbing,3dvto4,IamEdmundDantes,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:12:24 2015 UTC,We had a white board too but it ended up just being a jumble of names and random times. We just recently set up a facebook group for the gym and got the rockwall staff involved. I cannot recommend this enough! Gives a chance for new climbers who may be too nervous to approach more skilled climbers and it makes it so easy to set up an impromptu session.
climbing,3dvto4,ab0z,2,Mon Jul 20 01:31:32 2015 UTC,"In my experience, if someone is reluctant to trade belays with you in a situation like this, you probably don't want to climb with them.  My whole social circle is built from chatting up strangers at the climbing gym, the crag, Miguel's, etc.  If someone acts inconvenienced by people being social at the climbing gym they are a. A pro with a serious training schedule to keep (.001% chance) b. some jerk you don't want to climb with anyways (99.999% chance) Keep in mind though, this is all based on the assumption that you don't look/do something/say something totally crazy/creepy/weird."
climbing,3dvto4,jbnj451,4,Mon Jul 20 03:21:52 2015 UTC,"It would have been better if you would have asked him if he wanted a catch first.  If he said yes, then asking him to belay you would have been no problem.  I'll be honest, if I was climbing at the gym with my friends and a total stranger asked me to belay him, I would be a little annoyed.  You put the guy in a situation to either look like a jerk and say no or to have to belay you just to be polite (which really isn't a big deal, but still...).  Why don't you get your friend belay certified? It's quick and easy and likely only costs $5. Then everyone can climb their little hearts out."

Learn pad placement and how to spot and you're golden.  In this video it's obvious the parents are confident in her ability to climb the wall. If at any point they were worried about her well-being, I highly doubt they would sit by and nonchalantly record their child. The wall is also only like 5 feet tall with an extreme amount of padding. It's funny how children her age aren't frowned upon for gymnastics, but when the uneducated moms see rock climbing they automatically assume the parents are careless and are putting their kid in an unsafe environment.   ""PUT ON A HELMET"" Oh yeah, that's real effective on a bouldering wall.   Maybe I'm going on a rant, but I boulder exclusively and it always gets on my nerves when I hear people tell me how dangerous it is. Don't speak on things you're uneducated about people."

climbing,3dt5sh,borlak,2,Sun Jul 19 16:38:26 2015 UTC,"You're right that it's a risk, but it's kinda necessary. Kids learn by pushing themselves and getting hurt. Unless there's a real risk of a solid hit to the head or neck, I force myself to let them do their thing. Better to learn to be responsible for your personal safety in a 5 foot fall onto padding at age 2 than a 50 foot fall at age 16.  lAll kids are different, but mine have never taken a hard fall.  I've never seen them pop off a bouldering wall unexpectedly and they're almost completely unable (now at 5 and 8) to push themselves.  If they're not sure they can do a move, they have a really hard time trying, especially outside.  We'll go on a vacation and climb every day and they won't fall for the whole week. They'll top a 5.x perfectly, then get half way up a 5.(x+1) and ask to be lowered off when they get to a harder move.  Won't even try it.  Super cautious climbers.  Which is interesting when you're hanging out around kids who have been more helicopter parented. The ones who have been 'protected' are utterly fearless in a bad way. When we go to the playground my kids ask for a 'problem'.  I'll tell them to climb the full length of a play structure from underneath or climb an I-beam with rivets on the outside for footholds or do the picnic table traverse. My 8 year old will do it.  Then my 5 year old will look at it and say ""I can't do that"".  Then we'll walk away to go find him something he can do.  Inevitably, some other little kid comes over to where my 8 year old was climbing and tries to repeat it.  No caution.  They either fall off or get part way up and freak out.  Then their parents look up from their cell phones to see what's going on and flip their shit."

I got into climbing because a friend at work recommended it, and when he mentioned bouldering, I had no idea such a thing existed, and still didn't understand it until I saw it in the gym.  sadly, your average person's ideas about rock climbing are people free solo'ing and falling to their deaths."

climbing,3dvt94,AlleyAlmonds,6,Sun Jul 19 23:14:41 2015 UTC,"Bear in mind, people climb upwards of V10 in Anasazi Mocs all the time. You will see the biggest difference between moderate shoes like your Anasazis and downturned, aggressive shoes like the Solution on steep, overhung terrain (especially with small pockets etc). If you're climbing V11 slab, you probably don't want a downturned shoe; downturn does not make you a better climber.  That said, here's my advice: try on as many shoes as possible. Every shoe from every brand fits differently, even within the brand. Find what fits your foot best. A few different high-end bouldering/downturned/aggressive shoes from the big brands would be:  FiveTen: Dragons, Team 5.10s  La Sportiva: Solution, Futura  Scarpa: Instinct, Furia  Evolv: Shaman, Nexxo  Tenaya: Oasi, Tarifa  The Tenaya shoes are getting really popular right now, they're said to offer the performance of the Solution with a bit more sensitivity and wayyyyy more comfort."
climbing,3dvt94,kennethsime,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:47:20 2015 UTC,"Yes, definitely just trying on absolutely everything you can.  I'm a barefoot runner with pretty strong feet so I climbed in pretty soft shoes for a long time, preferring to have really good feel for what was going on.  Last year I started to get toe pain in my Evolv Defys and Anasazi VCS before a week long climbing trip.  Basically couldn't use pockets because it hurt too much.  Gym was closed for a holidy, so I went to a local moosejaw to see if I could find something stiffer to hold me over.    Normally wouldn't have bothered with it, but since they only had 2 shoes in my size, I tried the Miura VS. Most people describe it as a torture device but I knew the second I put it on that I'd found my shoe.  And it edges and deals with pockets like nothing else I've used, so that's nice."
climbing,3dvt94,goyploy,2,Mon Jul 20 20:16:26 2015 UTC,"Miuras get a decent rep as a more sensitive shoe that is a bit flatter than the solutions yet more aggro than the Anasazis.  Team 5.10s are super aggressive, I couldn't even get my foot in a pair.  Tenaya Oasi are aggressive and somewhat comfortable, but the quality of the Velcro fasteners is shockingly bad."

climbing,3dvt94,Cedalion,2,Mon Jul 20 06:17:44 2015 UTC,"If the Anasazi fit well you might check the Scarpa Instincts. They fit a wider, higher volume foot much better than Solutions or Dragons will. Sportiva tends to fit a skinny, lower volume foot. The last on the 5.10 Dragons (and their other aggressive bouldering shoes) is much skinnier than the last on the Anasazi line and will fit quite differently.   Bottom line is to just try on a bunch of different shoes and go for fit over brand names. Solutions are supposed to be great, but they'll be worthless if they don't fit your feet properly."

Moderate downturn, good for overhanging or vertical.  They edge well, but are aggressive enough to catch small pockets or heel hook.  I've bouldered up to v5 outdoors (i'm not much of a boulderer though) in my muiras, and climbed up to 11c sport.  If you're looking for the dedicated bouldering shoe, 5.10 hi angles, mad rock sharks, sportiva solutions/futuras are better.  Just find the shoe that fits your foot the best.  Particularly with downturned shoes, you really have to try them on to get the feel."

climbing,3duzds,Nina1701,8,Sun Jul 19 19:56:56 2015 UTC,"You've gotten a lot of great advice, all of which centers around the idea that it generally is a little scary always, but you learn to manage the fear with time and understanding of the systems involved.  Trad climbing isn't rocket science, and some people learn to trust the gear faster than others.  Some mindfuck themselves constantly, and will always climb below the grade.    As to the question of running it out, you should really only run it out when it's safe to do so.  Is the rock good?  Is the climbing easy?  Would placing a piece mean more drag or more fatigue?  I would never run it out in a place where gear was readily available and a fall would mean death or injury, even if it was really easy ground.  A guy was blown off the top of one of the tetons by wind, and his last piece was 50 feet below him, and he was gravely injured.  There just wasn't a need to run it out.  The fear changed for me when I took my first big whipper on trad.  I was on easy vertical climbing, with a solid #3 about ten feet below me.  I was chatting with a climber on another route when a foot blew and with stretch, ended up about 25 feet lower.  The cam held, I was safe, and all was well.  Do I still get sketched out?  Sure.  But usually only when the rock is bad, the gear is bad, or both."

climbing,3duzds,PuxinF,5,Mon Jul 20 01:39:08 2015 UTC,"Have you read 9 out of 10 climbers make the same mistakes by Dave Macleod? If not I'd recommend it.  I had a lot of sport climbing experience before I started trad, and a very experienced mentor to let me know if my gear placements were safe, so after three weekends of learning to place gear I started doing falling practice. This helped enormously - I still get petrified tying in to my first climb of the day, especially if I haven't done trad for a while, but a couple of practice falls on the warmup usually settles me down so I can climb freely, as long as I'm in a position where I think it's objectively pretty safe.   I'm still terrified of bold trad, but that's probably a good thing... I have no desire to break my legs, or worse... I like routes that could be pretty much described as sport climbing on gear :)"
climbing,3duzds,Ciro1,4,Mon Jul 20 07:52:09 2015 UTC,You don't want to get there quickly. You need to build up a broad base of experience which will help with managing the fear. Fear and doubt are important elements of trad and keeping calm under duress comes with practice.
climbing,3duzds,queev,3,Sun Jul 19 22:12:34 2015 UTC,"I started by practicing placing gear at sport crags, reading books, and following others on trad routes. I was lucky enough to have more experienced friends who could evaluate my placements. Once I felt confident in my gear, I did my first trad lead but felt super sketched out.  That was two months ago. I might just be lucky/stupid, but the fear has never been too bad after the first handful of routes. I'd recommend just hopping on some stuff a couple number grades down from your redpoint mark and putting in the mileage until you feel confident. Start by hanging on your own gear at times and then take a couple small, clean falls. Overcoming the fear at the start is definitely a part of the process, but having some of it isn't a bad thing.  I haven't climbed any runout trad yet beyond easy terrain, but would imagine that putting myself in those sorts of mentally hard situations (runouts on easy terrain, moderate highballs, old school bolted routes with big falls) is beneficial. Respect your limits and have fun!"
climbing,3duzds,Goldennova,3,Sun Jul 19 20:14:11 2015 UTC,'Comfortable' would be an exaggeration but I've been leading trad for almost a year now and I'm starting to get more confident. I don't 'fearlessly run things out' because that's a fairly stupid thing to do usually.

climbing,3duzds,TAOspeedwagon,2,Mon Jul 20 13:21:33 2015 UTC,It's never less scary. You just get better at thinking through the fear.
climbing,3duzds,Salad_Nazi,2,Sun Jul 19 21:41:27 2015 UTC,"Hmm, it took me a few months until I was satisfied that I can place gear that's actually gonna hold. This was confirmed by taking my first fall onto gear. Different to being scary- its always gonna be scary but now I've been leading for a while I have learnt to relax more and have subsequently really started improving. As for runouts, the British grading system nicely deals with this- runouts are reflected in the contrast between adjective and technical grade, so you know if you are climbing a runout route at your grade, then the climbing at the runout will be  well within your technically ability, so I'm fine with that.   I think one thing that helped a lot was starting leading trad after being a fairly competent boulderer and sport climber. It meant I knew how to move on the rock, and wasn't trying to learn how to climb (physically) whilst also learning the gear ect. It also meant that when I was spending hours hanging on my arms faffing with gear (as you do when you are new to trad!) I wasn't getting pumped to oblivion.   So, oddly, my suggestion would be to spend some time bouldering and sport/gym climbing so you are super strong and confident on the rock- regardless of the rope being there or not."
climbing,3duzds,rockinghorseshit,2,Sun Jul 19 21:56:53 2015 UTC,"Oh, also I used to walk around the bottom of crags with more experienced climbers sticking gear in and getting them to rate it, and sometimes put a sling on it and sit on it in my harness. And whenever I was seconded by someone more experienced than me I'd ask them to rate my gear, and really focus on remembering each piece as I placed it so that their feedback would make sense to me."
climbing,3duzds,rockinghorseshit,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:59:25 2015 UTC,It's a balance you run it out when it gets easy to save time and you stitch it up when it gets harder that being said trad will always be more of a rush than sport climbing at least for me

STEP 3: More photos of the bag that will go inside the plushie.  STEP 4: sewing the bag into the plushie. STEP 5: used bias tape to sew over the seam and bag for the drawstring. Sew it so that the draw string goes through one eye lit tube and out the other side then use a cord stopper.   STEP 6: pin the bias tape on to be sewed on. then sew it.  last steps: draw string drawn through! put on loops for a belt!  FIN!

You should be able to slide two fingers into the harness but not flip them over.  The harness should be tight enough that if you inverted, the harness would catch on your hips.  Cleaning: recommended cleaning is soaking in cold water with a mild soap. Detergents are usually fine, but more caustic cleaning agents are not! No vinegar or bleach!

For trad climbing you'll generally want to trade off a bit of precision for comfort - you might have to wear them for an hour or more.  For steep sport climbing or bouldering you'll want them pretty tight, but it shouldn't be painful unless you find yourself stuck on a slabby top.   For slabby friction climbing you'll need them a bit looser in order to get a large contact area."

But really, if you're using a gym to train, then you'll want similar shoes to what you climb outdoors in so you're comfortable with your footwork.

climbing,3dqymd,JaayKaay420,2,Sun Jul 19 22:40:21 2015 UTC,"Depends on the shoe and level that you're climbing at. Moccasins stretch more than other shoes, buying them real tight means they will have more useable lifetime down the road. E.G. I wear a 9.5 US male street shoe, bought a size 8.5 evolve mocc, hurt real bad cause they were new but after a bit they broke in and fit snug but not painfully. They're my casual shoe. My aggressive project shoe are 6.5 US male La Sportiva Miuras, they didn't stretch much at all and still feel very similar to when I bought them. My feet fit perfectly in that shoe though so they don't hurt much.  I guess what im trying to say is that new shoes hurt, downsizing a bit is good for climbing but dont go crazy when you first start. You'll get a feel for what is going to happen with your next pair pretty quickly and will be able to get a good size."

climbing,3dqymd,Aelfhere,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:38:29 2015 UTC,Well depending on the shoe they do stretch. Before you climb a few sessions they should normally be tight. Remember to take the shoes of often. I see new climbers complain about shoes but never take them off.  There's no need for new climbers to wear too small shoes though.
climbing,3dqymd,DobbyChief,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:08:11 2015 UTC,I have some new shoes that really hurt my feet in a standing position. As soon as I start climbing they feel immensely more comfortable.  I take them off in between routes.
climbing,3dqymd,iamriot,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:48:21 2015 UTC,"Not being able to walk in them is normal especially with downturned shoes. If you could walk normally they would probably be too big.  Personally, I don't like to crunch my feet to a painful extent. My shoes, yes are tight and uncomfortable, but I don't think it's realistic to be in so much pain that it hurts to climb. Sharma talked about how too many people have a misconception on how tight their climbing shoes need to be when in reality, they should be uncomfortable, but not painful. I'm on mobile so I can't link it, but I'm pretty sure it's a review on his shamans if you want to look it up.   I always make sure I can pull my toes up and flex them down. If your shoes are so tight you can't move your feet, then it's going to be extremely difficult to toehook and heelhook without being able to effectively pull with your foot. I'm also a boulderer, so my shoe preferences are a little specific. It took me a while to find the right shoe that was uncomfortably comfortable and had just the right amount of power. For me, it's the Five Ten W Hiangles . Most comfortable and powerful shoe I've ever worn. And the only heel to ever fit my baby feet."
climbing,3dqymd,casedia,1 point,Sun Jul 19 06:09:34 2015 UTC,"It's a pretty big misconception that they should fit towards the ""very uncomfortable"" side. There's a few articles floating around explaining how a lot of those myths originated back when vertical rock climbing shoes were in their infancy, and the fits were so terrible that people overcompensated by wearing them as tight and small as they could stand.  Nowadays, the fit and rnd behind the fit is pretty solid; so shop around for something that fits like a glove. There's enough options that you should be able to find something that fits with zero wiggle margin. Zappos surprisingly isn't all that bad for climbing shoes, you can order 3 at a time with free next day shipping if you use the mobile app. I guarantee you'll find what will feel like a custom fit if you stick with it, and your feet will thank you."

climbing,3dqymd,cheatcodez,-3,Sun Jul 19 14:38:09 2015 UTC,"You shouldn't be able to walk normally in climbing shoes.  They're for climbing, not walking.  When I started climbing, I crammed my feet into the smallest size I could cram them into.  Now I prefer a more comfortable fit.  You can't really go too small in climbing shoes, but it's not always worth the discomfort, so find what makes you happy.  Some shoes stretch a lot, and some stretch a little."
climbing,3dqymd,acranox,9,Sat Jul 18 21:41:19 2015 UTC,You can't really go too small in climbing shoes   I wouldn't put it that way. You can in fact size your shoes down to the point that they cause pretty serious and permanent damage to your feet.

I really did pick the smallest size I could physically put my foot into. But the all-leather La Sportivas will stretch quite a bit.  I asked my doctor, and she said she couldn't imagine me doing permanent damage from wearing small shoes.

climbing,3dnl4l,ImMadeOfRice,7,Mon Jul 20 15:17:36 2015 UTC,"I would rather them take longer with it and make it really good than spit out a fast movie. It really is one of, if not the greatest achievement in modern big wall climbing. Arguably the hardest route in the world. Why not take a year and a half to produce it? If they were trying to milk it, wouldnt they release the film soon after they topped out to capitalize on the media frenzy?   i dont really care when it comes out, i am just stoked to see it eventually"
climbing,3dnl4l,slats_grobnik,2,Fri Jul 17 22:01:29 2015 UTC,They're planning a feature length movie for that.  Many of the segments in past Reel Rock tours have been slightly or heavily edited versions of separate releases.

This is seriously looking like one of the most pathetic lineups I have ever seen from Reel Rock.  It just doesn't seem like a worthwhile thing to watch if they're going to stick to same handful of people doing miniscule shit when there is a whole world of climbers doing amazing things out there, but they're only here to sell images and brand names.  The dawn wall was amazing, everyone knows that and everyone has already seen truck loads of coverage for it.  Reel rock hands down sucks these days. Valley uprising was not the kind of film people wanted to see at a reelrock tour and since then it seems like they think its acceptable to put all this filler on tour."
climbing,3dnl4l,placehasgonetoshit,2,Sun Jul 19 05:04:30 2015 UTC,"Lol, OK, then what do you want people to see? Your home footage of your latest sick send? Some unknown doing the FA of an OK route, of a middling grade in an area that isn't that great? It's Reel Rock, they travel around the country. They need to make something that loads of people will want to see. BTW, I agree about your Valley Uprising comment, definitely not the type of film for that show."
climbing,3dnl4l,tripmind,1 point,Sun Jul 19 08:21:30 2015 UTC,"First of all thank you for your sincere reply. What I honestly want to see are people actually seeking out new routes, new crags and pushing the hardest lines they can find. Call me a fan boy but this is why I love watching Sharma because this is the type of stuff he does.  I know Honnold is a great great climber, but the stuff we see him doing on a daily basis doesn't quite fit this. So he recently did the Sufferfest - bicycle around Moab and do as many desert towers as he could, that's pretty rad, but for the most part Honnold is just touring.   ""The Line Across The Sky"" is allegedly going to be a first ""Ascent"" in the sense that Honnold and Caldwell are going to be the first to complete the chain of peaks which is pretty rad, I just hope that Honnold takes it seriously in the alpine sense, because even though he knows how to climb quickly, there are skillsets and even equipment that he doesn't have or think to bring (such as good crampons lol). I want to see Honnold do something that takes him to the edge of his ability (which doesn't necessarily mean freesoloing) and requires a serious concentration on his part. Alot of the videos I see Honnold doing recently seems to just be him and a buddy romping around, which isn't a bad thing but it feels like, in essence is watching someone be on vacation.  D.Woods is a boulderer, and he has put away some pretty gravity defying problems in the past, so I am interested in what he has been doing recently, although I think the flavor of the past few years is South Africa."

It's only missing sport but there hasn't been anything that groundbreaking this year out of the sporto world. some of those highball boulders can be considered a boltless short sport climb so there you go....   edit. I enjoyed valley uprising quite a bit because of the history of it. it doesn't have to be an all out sick gnar send fest sport brouldering climbing to be good."

climbing,3dpd3c,anxiousclimber,6,Sat Jul 18 04:04:40 2015 UTC,"I've used to have climbing anxiety for a very long time. All my family climbs and I was the pussy who never dared to leave the safety of the floor, and that made me feel incredibly pressured.  The moment I lost that anxiety was the moment I stopped giving a fuck about what others think (i.e. about my little sister climbing better than I do). Now I am by far the best climber in the family.  I'd say don't mix your relationship with the climbing too much in your mind -- Concretely, don't pressure yourself to climb in order to not let your boyfriend down. Makes sense?  If I were in your shoes I'd ask myself: why did losing communication make you that anxious? Why do you need it to be reassured / at ease?   Does it have to do with your trust in your climbing skills or the climb itself? Does it have to do with your ease for climbing coming from your boyfriend? Does it have to do with your relationship entirely? i.e. does it have to do with your fear of failing him? Does it have to do with something else entirely?   Maybe I'm just rambling, but I hope this helps you. This is too much of a lovely sport to feel pressured into it.  Hope you make it through this rough patch :)"
climbing,3dpd3c,CapeHorn15,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:58:36 2015 UTC,"It was just the lack of communication because I had no idea what to do when we couldn't communicate verbally, we had no rope tug system figured out and I just had to figure out how to get to him (which I obviously did otherwise we'd still be up there). Now those feelings come back regardless of the situation. Thanks for the help though!"
climbing,3dpd3c,Sutekhy,5,Sun Jul 19 19:33:52 2015 UTC,"Anxiety can be a real tricky situation, it's completely irrational, you know it's irrational, but sometimes you can't get over it.   Usually the routine for getting over anxiety in situations is to first figure out what's causing the issue with you, take slow deep breaths and control your breathing, realize that it's on you to figure out what's causing the issue you're currently facing, when you get there examine the hard facts about what problem you're facing, and most importantly you've got to believe and have confidence in yourself.   Obviously all this is easier said that done, my ex suffered from severe anxiety and panic attacks for many years, it was torture watching them affect her, I'm sure your boyfriend is not let down by you at all. If anything I bet he just wants you to be happy again doing what you love."

climbing,3dpd3c,tinyOnion,2,Sat Jul 18 09:34:24 2015 UTC,"you still have to be able to deal with it when you are in the shit of it. dropped radios, dead batteries, malfunctioning devices, out of range, wrong band etc. if you are a few hundred feet up and shit goes wrong you need to know that you can deal. radios could help if they don't cause more anxiety than just exposure therapy would.   To the OP. I think a good idea for those situations is to stop and take deep breaths. have a system of rope tugs that works for you when you are not in communication. I personally use three really hard tugs when I put my partner on belay and they can't hear me. take up all the slack. put on belay. three hard tugs. no ambiguity and works when you drop the radios(I don't use them but they could be nice)."

climbing,3dpd3c,krovek42,2,Sun Jul 19 20:14:55 2015 UTC,"I'd recommend a few things.   Take a break from the sport for a week or two (at most). Let yourself settle down out of the jitters. In a safe environment, put yourself into the stressful situations and have someone there to talk you through it. Repeat as necessary, rehearsing whatever it is that helps you get through it. Some pro climbers say they sing to themselves when they climb, maybe try that. (Worked for a friend of mine recently when she got panicky on lead) If you're doing multipitch, maybe try some radios so you can stay in comms with your partner the whole time to reassure yourself."

climbing,3dpbu6,DrDare,2,Sat Jul 18 03:51:55 2015 UTC,"I actually bought the Inti today and climbed with them outside as well. I tried on all the models and this was the only one I really loved. I have long narrow feet as well. They are smaller in the toe than the Ra so that was my reasoning for ditching the Ra. The Oasi and Tarifa were not stuff enough for what I wanted, wich was a somewhat aggressive shoe for all day sport. I needed a shoe that performs on small tech face edges and tiny slab. The Oasi would be a nice bouldering shoe though.   Size wise I pretty much got my street shoe size and even those are tight, people say no break in period but these will still require some. Also I lead mid/high 10s, if that matters. Hope some if this helps, feel free to PM me for more info."
climbing,3dpbu6,1stand1st,2,Sat Jul 18 04:45:35 2015 UTC,"I have the Masai and the Ra. The Masai is definitely for narrow/low volume feet. The Ra not so much.   The Masai is a comfortable all-around climbing shoe. It compares to the lace-up versions of the Five Ten Anasazi and La Sportiva Miura.   For steep bouldering, probably want to look at the Oasi or Tarifa."
climbing,3dpbu6,ninjastar527,2,Sat Jul 18 07:57:16 2015 UTC,"I have long narrow feet and I have the Masai and the Oasi. The Masai fit me great at my normal shoe size (ie I normally wear a 7 in shoes and I have a 7 for my climbing shoes). Despite being my normal shoe size I still get a nice tight fit on the Masai and I find them great for toeing onto small footholds. Edit to add: One downside is I find the heel is a bit too low or maybe not quite tight enough; my foot has slipped out a couple of times on heelhooks if I didn't have the shoes laced up super tight. But I have really narrow feet, so grain of salt I s'pose.  The Oasi are the same size but a bit roomier for me. I was told by the sales guy when I went to try on climbing shoes that because I don't have a very high arch in my foot, velcro shoes wouldn't give me as great of a fit and I guess it's true. The Oasi just feel a bit looser around the ball of my foot, so I tend to wear them when I'm doing more endurance type workouts rather than pushing my grade."
climbing,3dpbu6,Mugginsx,2,Sat Jul 18 09:23:30 2015 UTC,"I own the Oasi, although they are comfy for an aggressive shoe I would stay clear of them as the Velcro is not good at all, I've had mine for about 3 months and I'm replacing them as the Velcro fastening system was not fit for purpose after 1 month of bi-weekly use. It's a real shame as I thought they had great potential when new. I tried on a pair of the Masais earlier and the fit just wasn't right for my foot, went from too much room in the toe to painfully small in half a size - cool looking show though  As of today I'm wearing the five ten Anasazi pink lace ups. They're just great!"

If you're not sure what a back clip, or a z clip is, go over it before the climb so you're not fiddling around when there's a risk of danger. If you're really nervous about it and have two ropes out at the crag just do a mock lead on top rope."

climbing,3dnfyj,iclimbnaked,0,Sat Jul 18 16:32:08 2015 UTC,"I mean he was already clipped! Why did he unclip?? I think this video also highlights the importance of clipping at belt level, as opposed to so far over head. (Advice I should often follow myself!!)"
climbing,3dnfyj,Nina1701,6,Fri Jul 17 18:46:28 2015 UTC,"Clip from the good holds actually. it's easier to clip from the hip usually but if you are clipping from tenuous holds it's better to be clipping from the jugs. You fall the same total distance when you clip either way but the distance relative to the ground is actually lower by about 3 or 4 feet; the distance from your tie in point to the end of your finger tips is the distance that you will be closer to the ground. this could be important when doing the first few clips or a clip above a ledge but in general is not a big deal. no extra force is put on the piece because you fall the same total distance. (as an aside, I have had similar conversations  about this topic in the past and it always leads to the other party not getting it and me having to explain it four or five times before they understand even with pictures drawn of the two situations. It's not intuitive and it's a big misconception.)   picture explanation:  http://i.imgur.com/TOXj6X8.png  Description:   Red x is the bolt you are trying to clip.   Blue bolt is the one you are clipped to.   the yellow dot on the left is where you would fall if you clipped from the hip.   the yellow dot on the right is where you would fall from if you clipped above you.   Green line represents the length fallen from each point. The numbers are for the length of rope out.   Another way to think about it is to look at it from an extreme... if you are 10' above a bolt with no extra slack it is a 20' fall. if you are 10' above the bolt and you have 100' of extra slack out you fall 120' instead 200'."
climbing,3dnfyj,oakbaybeachbum,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:20:27 2015 UTC,"It's important to note though that you fall to a lower point when reaching for a clip, which is why it is much safer to clip at waist level if you can, especially for lower clips where decking is a possibility.

You can get a guidebook at Rock & Snow in nearby New Paltz. There are different entry passes for Peterskill and Mohonk (which is what most people think of when they think of ""The Gunks"") so that's something to keep in mind. But the tops of the cliffs are all accessible by hiking up/down, they're all single pitch 50-80' (as far as I'm aware), and the routes are of a very similar style and quality to Mohonk!  There are a few bolted anchors for some of the climbs, but you'll find it very useful to learn how to set up an anchor using natural protection (i.e. trees). Make sure to bring towels to protect the trees, and do be careful not to use the endangered pitch pines!"

I read a few articles thinking about putting a screws in a tree for reasons other than climbing (e.g. http://www.chron.com/life/gardening/article/Do-nails-and-screws-harm-trees-1793098.php)  The consensus seems to be any holes are bad due to the increased risk of viral or bacterial infection, and damage to nutrient conduits.  If you are going to put a hole into a tree, people say that making one large hole is better than many small ones. The analogy is to imagine some one screwed something into your body and left it there - your body would not do all that well and be much more susceptible to disease.   According to my intuition (read non-reliable information), even if the tree is going to die from putting it full of holds, it is going to be a slow death and you should be able to get a few good years of climbing out of it.

She began lowering the bag down over the lip. Now, keep in mind the lip wasn't even a smidge sharp, in fact it was a pour off so it was quite well rounded. Standing at the bottom watching the bag slowly come down, I hear a rip and suddenly the bag's in free fall. Boom, lands like ten feet from me.  I've since lowered many, many packs with webbing or a real climbing rope. Never once has anything like that happened using real gear.  Lesson learned."
climbing,3djgdd,GoonCommaThe,6,Thu Jul 16 19:53:00 2015 UTC,I've used plenty of Home Depot ropes to lower and raise plenty of things over the years and have never had any issues (not climbing).  The ropes are rated for their use just like a climbing rope is rated for climbing.  I'm going to guess you exceeded the weight limit on whatever sort of like you were using.
climbing,3djgdd,Nina1701,4,Thu Jul 16 20:27:47 2015 UTC,"I doubt it was the weight of the bag. It couldn't have weighed more then 35-40 lbs or I wouldn't have been able to carry it! lol.  At the time, I attributed it to the friction of rubbing against the lip of the drop."
climbing,3djgdd,experiential,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:35:00 2015 UTC,Isn't it heavy carrying climbing rope? Do you use a full 60m length?

If we're in doing low grade scrambling like in a canyon or something, we use webbing. Sometimes if were doing low grade climbing, like class 4 or easy 5, we use a half (twin) rope."

I advised him not to do that and offered to let him use my rope. He declined.  A month later I saw him with a real climbing rope. BUT, he was using Home Depot rope to build a TR anchor. Again, he declined my sage advice.  Ran into him a third time and he told me he got his ""certification"" and was going to take out his son's Boy Scout troop out climbing. After some questions, I realized that ""certification"" meant he passed the belay test at the gym."

Had absolutely no idea what they were doing.  Meanwhile, they were literally 3 feet from a perfectly good bolted anchor they could have used!  One of them almost fell off the cliff a few times trying to make their anchor.  I asked them if they were gunks belay certified.  They looked puzzled.

climbing,3djgdd,Hubology,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:54:15 2015 UTC,Working Load Limit is equal to Minimum Break Strength divided by Safety Factor. So if the SF is 6 (guess?) then the MBS is 1860lbs. With a crap knot 930lbs. Most good knots will retain better than 50%.

climbing,3dkgtv,kennethsime,0,Fri Jul 17 09:16:02 2015 UTC,That happen a lot? I almost never get that at GWPC. Sometimes someone will start a problem after me without realizing they cross and I'll have to yell at them to get off (or if they're cute I'll usually just jump off) but that's really rare. Pretty much never happens in the cave when it could actually be dangerous.
climbing,3dkgtv,bonestorm5001,2,Fri Jul 17 19:57:40 2015 UTC,"Yea, at my home gym it happens mostly with kids who don't realize the danger, I've never really had it happen at Planet Granite, but almost every time I climb at a TS gym I run into it.  I think one of the big things is there's pretty much nowhere to rest in busy times; one of the last times I was at GWPC there a guy was traversing the central wall who started climbing over me as I was sitting. I got up immediately, and excused myself for being under him, to which he replied: ""oh no, it's cool."" Clearly, it wasn't cool with me, and I told him so. It's cool that you're confident, but I don't actually trust you at all and I didn't know you were above me. He continued to traverse above others after our encounter.  At our gym it's generally advised that you avoid traversing during busier times so as to avoid monopolizing the wall, but I feel like at GWPC a similar rule might help with regards to the central pillar, because there really is no other place to rest if you're not actively on the wall. I ran into a very similar issue at Pipeworks, where for certain areas, the only area to rest clear of a fall zone is also a walkway (to be fair, they also have a bunch of couches that aren't that far away).  Ironworks has the unique problem that top-ropers and boulderers share floor space on 80% of their bouldering wall, and each tends to think that they are the #1 priority (ie, boulderers seem to expect top ropers to stay out of their fall zones, while top ropers seem to expect boulderers to stay out of their belay area). The wave has a nice amount of space behind it and no top roping adjacent, which is ideally how the entire bouldering area should be set up."
climbing,3dkgtv,kennethsime,1 point,Sat Jul 18 02:28:36 2015 UTC,Lol I was just at Ironworks last night for the comp. It was crowded due to the comp but you're right about the proximity of the bouldering walls and the roped walls. I kept thinking about how many times people get landed on.

After 20 feet of sliding down sandstone, hitting a couple holds in the gym won't seem so bad.  :)  But yeah, I feels ya.  Honestly, you just sort of have to practice footwork a lot until you've got a sense for what you can and can't do.  Took a sudden 12+ fall down a slab at the gym a couple weeks ago.  The good news is the holds hit you and hurt, but as long as they don't catch a foot and hyper extend a knee/break an ankle, you'll just get some bruises.  The better news is, if it's a slab and it's anything other than a V1, the holds probably aren't big enough to grab you.  Just try to go limp and curl up a bit as you're fall.  Easy to say, hard to remember.  :)"

climbing,3dle9a,redditierre,3,Sun Jul 19 20:13:33 2015 UTC,"I think smacking holds on the the way down is just part of slab. If I'm in the gym, I find it helps to push off from the wall a little as I fall. So far, except for when there's been a volume or or large hold under me, that's worked fine. But slabs are the best, you just have to commit and learn to trust your feet!"
climbing,3dle9a,failure_is_an_option,4,Fri Jul 17 05:42:43 2015 UTC,"Not to disagree with this, but it's hard to imagine people are committing to the problem if they are ready to push off from the wall."
climbing,3dle9a,ex0-,2,Fri Jul 17 09:44:56 2015 UTC,Exactly.  Nobody worries about the falls where you have time to push off.  It's the sudden foot slips that get you.    I honestly don't think there's a way to avoid it other than getting better at recognizing when foot slips are likely.  I've been a fan of slab bouldering/climbing for years and still take scary falls every now and then.
climbing,3dle9a,kepleronlyknows,3,Fri Jul 17 14:37:21 2015 UTC,"If I slip and find myself sliding down, is it reasonable to try and push off mid-fall or should I just kind of take it at that point?"
climbing,3dle9a,ex0-,2,Fri Jul 17 13:00:22 2015 UTC,"If you slip and find yourself sliding down and have time to even think about pushing off mid fall you must be climbing something fucking gigantic. If you have time to do it, sure, but make sure you don't end up dwelling on it (which you will, i promise) and that then effecting your climbing because you're not concentrating on the problem."
climbing,3dle9a,aspz,6,Fri Jul 17 15:28:20 2015 UTC,I've fallen off slabs unexpectedly and the instinct to push off the wall kicks in without thinking. It will be the tiniest of forces but is often enough to make a difference. I've seen many other people do the same thing. I've never seen anyone cheese grater down a slab on a boulder problem possibly because of this instinct.
climbing,3dle9a,straightCrimpin,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:15:13 2015 UTC,"Agreed. Most slab falls occur because balance is lost, and it usually takes a good amount of time where you're reeling and trying to regain balance. At some point you realize it's not going to happen and you start to fall, there's usually time to push away from the wall."
climbing,3dle9a,aspz,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:46:50 2015 UTC,I'm not even talking about a fall where you peel off. I'm talking about a foot slip or something else unexpected. You have a fraction of a second to reorientate yourself and a very quick slap on the wall with a hand or a foot will allow you to instinctively avoid the wall and stay on your feet.

climbing,3dljlz,Ciro1,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:02:15 2015 UTC,"More rope out past the draw, bigger fall and potential lateral swing."
climbing,3dljlz,deus216,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:12:56 2015 UTC,"Yes, but either way the two people take up one line. Either the wall has been set up so that line is safe for people to lead climb on or it hasn't. If it's not safe to lead climb when every line is full then it's not safe to lead climb when the wall is half empty either, since people can still climb on adjacent routes."
climbing,3dljlz,Ciro1,2,Fri Jul 17 21:47:54 2015 UTC,"What?  You are more likely to fall off and into the adjacent route when lead climbing than if you were topping the same route in some cases. That is the reasoning. The gyms I've been to all say that if someone is lead climbing a route, the two adjacent ropes can't be climbed at the same time - so yeah, lead climbing takes up a bit more space.  I feel this practice is just fine. I can still lead in my gym, I just don't when it's busy because it is inconsiderate."
climbing,3dljlz,deus216,2,Fri Jul 17 21:52:54 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I guess that should be an obvious thing to do, but I just haven't really practiced falling outdoors.

I would highly recommend it as it is a good read and has helped me a lot in how I think while climbing.    perfect example: if you are afraid of falling you are usually thinking to yourself ""don't fall""  but you are still thinking about falling so you are unable to focus on your next move.  The Rock Warriors Way teaches a lot in the way of self awareness, and understanding how state of mind effects performance."
climbing,3dljlz,Fnurgh,2,Fri Jul 17 16:25:51 2015 UTC,"There is no shortcut to mitigating the fear of falling, especially after you've taken one.  A couple of years ago I took a large lead fall that bust my ankle. 10 weeks later (before I could walk without a limp) I tied back in and immediately started taking lead falls. It wasn't easy.  If you ever find yourself being limited by the threat of falling do this (indoors):  Tie in, climb to the third clip, let go. Get back on, climb to the 4th clip, let go. 5th clip, let go. Do this to the anchors.  Next session do this but from the 4th clip, climb to the next bolt, and don't clip it before you let go.  Repeat this every session until you no longer care about falling :)  Edit: one other very important thing; your belayer has to practise you falling as well. The difference between climbing when you trust your belayer to catch you, catch softly and not short-dick you versus a belayer who you don't trust is HUGE. I see many climbers who never fall (never push themselves) and so their belayers never get to practice catching them. If you want to push yourself, you have trust your belayer."

Add in the fact that rescue is free in National Parks and most counties wont charge for SAR it's pointless. And worse than the competition.  From the AACUK - Austrian Alpine Club United Kingdom Chapter ""1. Rescue Costs up to EUR 25,000.– per person and claim. Rescue costs are understood as those costs of local rescue organisations (including costs of rescue organisations of neighbouring countries for incidents occurring close to national frontiers) incurred when the insured person has suffered an accident, or must be rescued, whether injured or uninjured, from mountain or aquatic distress (the same also applies in the case of fatalities). Rescue costs are deemed the demonstrable costs incurred in searching for and transporting the injured person to the nearest road open to traffic or to the hospital nearest the site of the accident. 2. Costs for Transfer, Repatriation and Medical Treatment • Costs of moving persons who have been injured or have fallen ill, and costs of transferring corpses within the country of permanent residence without any limitation on cost when preceded by a rescue operation. • Repatriation from abroad without limitation on cost. • For medically necessary treatment (including medically necessary transportation to a hospital) abroad, up to EUR 10,000.–."""

climbing,3dkiqe,Engyu,14,Fri Jul 17 00:31:31 2015 UTC,"Ok, i'll bite. I think the two questions you should ask yourself are ""will i actually enjoy this?"" and ""can i do this?""  will i actually enjoy this:   while being a passionate climber is important for owning/managing a bouldering gym, keep in mind that there is actually no climbing involved. Do you enjoy hiring and firing people? managing payroll? purchasing, paying taxes, promoting your business/marketing, dealing with your city zoning laws and insurance, long term maintenance of your place of business and bouldering cave? Again, there is no climbing involved. Managing a gym is closer to managing a store than to climbing.  What would you be doing if you weren't opening a bouldering cave? Owning a business is a full time ~100 hour/week commitment with no vacations, for many years. Would you rather be spending time with your kids? Traveling? Having another job that you like?  can i do this?:   Basic questions to ask yourself. How much will i spend in initial investment? In the first year? In the first 5 years? Including rent/equipment/staff/insurance/taxes.  How many years before my business turns a profit?  do you have a family? What happens if your idea doesn't work? Either way, at what point to you ""give up"" (ie: x years without turning a profit, or being x dollars in the hole and not willing to mortgage the house).  Good luck. Of the two questions, the first is most important. If you want to do it, no one can tell you you can't do it except yourself. But at least we can make sure you're asking yourself the right questions (and that you have a satisfactory answer)."
climbing,3dkiqe,dsafvdaviafjsdoifjsa,5,Fri Jul 17 03:43:54 2015 UTC,A bouldering gym sounds like a great way to make a pile of money. Assuming you start with a much bigger pile of money.    High initial investment. High liability. There's a reason most non-climbing gyms depend on signing up New Years resolutioners who never show up.
climbing,3dkiqe,kamakie,5,Fri Jul 17 03:05:19 2015 UTC,"And lots and lots of birthday parties, which bouldering gyms are not nearly as good at hosting."
climbing,3dkiqe,kepleronlyknows,4,Fri Jul 17 15:43:57 2015 UTC,It's going to be a lot of money. it's going to be a ton of time. it's a risk as climbing is more popular than ever but it's still niche. your routes are your product so you have to have good ones or else people bail on you. the vibe of the gym is important too as holier than thou cliques can be detrimental to your bread and butter daypass and birthday party goers. I doubt you will make enough to survive off just members unless you are a mega gym like sender one and even then I am not sure the are profitable without daypass and parties. It also depends on the area and the area's demographic. how good are you at marketing? if you are good at marketing and don't shut down ideas it could be an advantage. liability is also a big profit eroder so you need a long runway of cash. good luck.
climbing,3dkiqe,tinyOnion,1 point,Fri Jul 17 00:51:29 2015 UTC,"Liability aspect is probably the one thing that scares me the most. As of now, I am trying to gather as much information as possible. Also, I wasn't aware daypass and parties were such a big part of the cash inflow. Concerning marketing, I am convinced it is really important if not crucial to a good launch. Long term image/vibe/concpet is a bit harder to foresee though as the sport will probably change a fair bit if media/public attentions keeps on growing. So I believe there is a bit of a gambling here going on.  In any case, thank you for your comment!"

climbing,3dkiqe,kepleronlyknows,3,Fri Jul 17 02:59:23 2015 UTC,"Have you worked in a gym?  It's hard to imagine a gym doing well if it doesn't have an owner or at least GM with a fair amount of industry experience.    Bouldering gyms have unique challenges.  Most regular gyms survive in large part because of things like birthday parties and summer camps.  Bouldering gyms don't have as much of an edge on those areas, which means you need to survive by pleasing actual climbers to a larger degree (not that regular gyms don't aim for that, but it's extra crucial in a bouldering gym).  Therefore, If you do it, don't skimp on things like setting, coaching, hold budget, etc..  For instance, I've seen a good number of smaller start ups try to get by with volunteer setters, and that shit sucks."

Birthday moms see bouldering as dangerous, and don't want to bring their kids to somewhere ""unsafe"". Maybe offer summer camps and after school programs instead. That way you know the kids coming in are actually there to learn to climb instead of moms just finding a place they can drop their kids off to tire them out."

climbing,3dkiqe,casedia,2,Sat Jul 18 21:13:14 2015 UTC,"I supported my coach/boss as he built a bouldering gym. Worked there for 2 years from the start until I moved to go to school. Things I learned:   Know your demographic.   If you want to bring newbies in and introduce people to climbing, then try to be as welcoming to the sport as you can. It has worked well for us, but some of the things we have come by is intimidation.   Our gyms goal was to give climbers a place to train and to grow the climbing community. The issue is that the walls are amazing if you've been climbing for a while, but are extremely intimidating if you're in for your first time. Our bouldering walls are 18 feet tall and are almost all steep terrain. It is literally the best place to jump two grades if you want to train, but it can be hard to introduce people to climbing without scaring them away.  That being said, it's not impossible to introduce people to climbing. Since working there, I've seen us grow exponentially with new climbers. I feel like compared to the other gyms in the area, we've brought the most newbies into the sport and have really expanded the community through our facility. That being said... Point 2.   Be active with the community.   There was no exclusively bouldering gym that existed before us. A lot of the members we lose or don't have are because they want to climb ""tall"" walls. (I'm using quotations because where I'm from the buildings are only 30 feet high). Most of the time, being the newbie in the community can be hard. Listen to what people want and show them that you care.   We do a lot of local competitions, members nights, and fun nights throughout the week. Offer something to the people that climb at other gyms that they can only get from you. It'll always be hard for someone to leave a gym they are loyal to, but sometimes they just need a good reason too. If you're the only gym doing fun things in the community then you will get the most attention.  Edit: group memberships are huge for this. People climb with their friends. give people a discounted price for ""couples"" memberships etc. usually it's not about leaving the gym that's hard for people, it's about leaving the friend group they've made there.   Upkeep. Frequent route turnovers is a big one. Don't let people get bored too quickly. Also, stay clean. Most newer gyms are... Newer. Clean your bathrooms, clean your counters. Gyms built 10 years ago look like it, yours shouldn't. It surprisingly makes a huge difference. Most of our yelp reviews always mention how clean our gym is and how nice it is because of it. Have fun. You're a climber. Don't stress out too much. Give yourself time to climb on your own canvas. Climb with your members. Be approachable. Remember why you're there in the first place.   I hope this helps a little bit. I'm young and by no means a business woman, but I like to think I've gotten a pretty good insight on how to cater to a climbing community. Please send me any messages if you feel like it. I don't want to post too many personal things on here, but if you ask nicely maybe I'll let you know the name of the facility :). And good luck!"

climbing,3dizm2,iRisingson,1 point,Fri Jul 17 01:34:11 2015 UTC,"It's actually exactly the same outside on sharp rock.  In fact, it's more pronounced because the margin for error is so much smaller.     Even a tiny amount of movement on micro crimps can wreck your fingertips.     I had a project last winter that involved yarding off a sharp 6mm incut.  When I first started working it I was only able to give it 3 or 4 tries.  After a few sessions I was able to give it a few dozen attempts without risk of an eviscerated index finger.   Why?   Because my strength in the position was better; a result of better beta, stronger fingers in those specific positions, and a better understanding of how to leverage my body position between movements."
climbing,3dizm2,milyoo,1 point,Fri Jul 17 11:41:42 2015 UTC,"The point is that the rocks don't get softer, you just get better at the moves in a project and it becomes easier and less painful as you acquire muscle memory and don't move about as much on the rock.  Some things just hurt though. You gotta try things a bunch of times before you figure them out sometimes. Sometimes the rock is Joshua Tree sharp. Sometimes you gotta make a two hand dyno to a sharp little crimpy hold and no matter how good you grab it and grip it it still hurts. Good technique just minimizes these things, it never removes them away completely."

climbing,3dizm2,kevingrr,3,Thu Jul 16 18:03:43 2015 UTC,"You need to care for your skin properly.  This means filing down and trimming any edges or torn calluses and moisturizing your skin between sessions.  Many people will recommend expensive climbing specific ointments and those do work fine.  However cheaper alternatives such as Burt's Bees Hand Salve work equally well and cost $5.00.  Some pro's I have talked with use regular lotion.  Few other tips: 1. Wash your hands as soon as you are done climbing to remove chalk.  It dries out your hands.   Chalk up properly while climbing.  The less your skin ""slips"" the better. Moisturize after sessions and on off days.  Never before you climb ;) Reduce how much you climb on highly textured jug hauls and big moves.  Typically these really do a number on the skin."

At the local shop one of the owners would go around finding old boots, tents, and gear, along with making most of the decor and shelving from reclaimed wood. Working there put you in an occupational hazard for splinters but it looked great, and very purpose built. At Arc and TNF, there's so much amazing gear and hardware that will never get to see the outside of a display mannequin it's almost heartbreaking.

climbing,3di42s,asfdhf,2,Thu Jul 16 21:48:17 2015 UTC,"It's an alpine climb. Maybe your question is more suited to /r/alpinism.  If you have experience in alpinism (traversing exposed terrain with crampons and ice axe, know when to rope up, how to walk in a rope team, have a good sense of orientation, know when to belay and how to build belays etc.) then you may be up to it.  Otherwise, get a mountain guide. It's not that hard technically, I think there's no climbing passage harder than III but you will climb it in mountain boots. In the french adjectival grading system it is graded as AD (assez difficile: ""fairly difficult"", see wikipedia).  So it really depends on what you already have experience in. If you've never done a high mountain tour there are probably better routes to do for a starter...."

climbing,3di42s,stenvold,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:50:45 2015 UTC,"Let me start off by saying, the route shouldn't be a dream goal to be done. It's a nice climbing in it's own right but not overly hard or pleasing. There is no real direct route up to the summit and lots of miscues as to where the path leads. Lots of scree on rock and verglassed rock in the early morning make it interesting to keep your footing.  I think the main challange of the route is the mental aspect of knowing what you are capable of and finding the route. It's more of a culmination of general skills but mostly knowing the skills to get you to the top. These skills you need to learn over time by doing climbs of similar types.  I never did any training with this climb in mind so it's hard to say. You need to be able to hike at least 2000m in elevation in a day and be comfortable on ice at 45 degrees as well as climbing grade 2 and 3 all day long in mountain boots. Other than general mountain fitness, no specific training in terms of conditioning is required.  I did the the route solo with 1 ice axe, most photos I've seen have always had people with two ice axes. From the description though I decided that I should be ok with just one for the weight savings. I also carried very little in terms of gear. The decisions I made for gear were all based on personal experience and what I thought I would need from the route description. I did however get myself into a situation where I went off route and ended up rappelling off a snow bollard to get back on route. If I didn't know that useful trick I would have been in a much worse situation. Experience is the key. I met a group of spanish climbers who in my opinion shouldn't have been anywhere near the mountain and I was actually glad to see they didn't make an attempt for the summit as I could predict mountain rescue would have a greater than 50% of being called to save them.  I'm not sure why you are asking about Yosemite Granite at the same time. I've never been to Yosemite so couldn't give any better advice than looking on the internet.  If you are actually really serious about getting into Alpine climbing and there isn't enough around australia for you then I'd suggest you head over to NZ for a couple weeks a year and hire a guide or take a course to get you into it.   tl;dr Go climb some mountains"

Had I known earlier about the hold quality. I would have gone all wood which would knock the best price down at least $100. So you should totally build something like this and get strong!
