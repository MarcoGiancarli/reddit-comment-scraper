airsoft,3e3f6s,Greyfells,4,Tue Jul 21 20:09:11 2015 UTC,"The separatists in Ukraine are not professional soldiers like Russians or Americans, they shot down an air liner for example. Their flag and cause has the validity of the Taliban (actually probably less, since the Taliban has clearly stated causes and they're honest about who they are). Funded by an external force, and a proxy for a nation that only wants to continue the war for its own interest.  Also, some of us are European, and some of us are Eastern European. Is it such a surprise that we'd be a little critical of anything related to Russia's little war games in Europe? In a way, it's a little bit worse for some of us than people dressing up like Wehrmacht, because the Nazi's aren't still killing people and causing unrest in Europe. They're a figment of history. Ukrainian separatists and Russian vacationers are very real, and very dangerous for some of us."

Ukrainian separatists and Russian vacationers are very real, and very dangerous for some of us.   I believe that there should be principles guiding the usage of symbols, impressions, and other related things - either ALL portrayals of real life combatants is banned entirely, or you must allow everything. Otherwise it's becomes just a matter of perspective, i.e. somebody somewhere will get upset by it.  For you it's worse than the Third Reich, and you don't really care about that. But some do, and don't care about the Ukraine conflict in turn. Who gets the final say?  And it should also be fairly apparent that the impression contains satire as well."
airsoft,3e3f6s,dieDoktor,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:28:57 2015 UTC,"Passenger flight shot down by US navy in 1988. Mistakes happen in conflicts   That's true, mistakes happen, but they happen far less often if you're a professional soldier with proper training. That's why the US military is so insanely anal about safety procedures. Para-military forces always end up making a mess of things, it's always just a matter of time. You can't give guns to idealistic teenagers and ignorant old men and call them an army.    For you it's worse than the Third Reich, and you don't really care about that. But some do, and don't care about the Ukraine conflict in turn. Who gets the final say?   Once again, this is an ongoing conflict. I don't think that you shouldn't be allowed to dress up like one of them or post this pic here, but I also don't think it's appropriate to try and reason away people's discomfort. People don't get fussy when someone dresses up as a middle-eastern terrorist because they know they're playing the ""bad guy"". To almost any European point of view, you're dressed up as the bad guy."

We pretty much agree, I think. How, and if, people are discomforted is not under my control. I could apologize, but my principles stand in the way of doing so. Besides, and most importantly, this is an airsoft impression and not in any way a condonement of any real life conflicts.

Evike has green ones but they are always sold out. So if you have .23g (maybe even .25s) bbs in green and another color other than black or white you can expect me to buy some your site. I do not care if your pricing is a tad bit more expensive compared to Evike for Goldenball bbs that are in different colors. I will pay more especially if I know your site will pretty much have them in stock because it takes too long for Evike to stock back up. Even if Evike has them for cheaper and in stock, if you have unique colors of the Goldenball bb I will buy from you."
airsoft,3e3ajz,magusopus,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:21:22 2015 UTC,I've been reluctant to stock 0.23g rounds based on personal preference alone and the general lack of interest it seems to get but if there's demand for it I'll definitely at least give it some consideration.

My thought was the fuse had blown but i couldn't see one once opened. The battery connector was roasting hot and hard to touch at the time, the motor was moving when the trigger was pulled but eventually started smoking. The motor did have electrical tape around it but it wasn't tight so my guess was it was holding the wires in closer to the body.     any ideas what could be causing the smoke and why it wont fire?"
airsoft,3e20p8,Smithycroft,2,Tue Jul 21 10:43:20 2015 UTC,"Sounds like a short, I'd try another motor, battery, and get that fuse replaced. If it still doesn't fire, it needs new wiring."
airsoft,3e20p8,FreddieG10,2,Tue Jul 21 14:04:16 2015 UTC,Smoke usually means a short somewhere.  Check the wires for fraying.

airsoft,3e20p8,aznriptide859,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:51:23 2015 UTC,How practical would dual TM Xtreme Hi-CAPAs with extended mags be in a CQB environment?   Can I run them with propane?   What is the best way to take care of them? What should I lube and clean and how often?
airsoft,3e20p8,ThisIsForViewing,4,Tue Jul 21 10:29:12 2015 UTC,"Dual wielding pistols is not super practical because you will most likely be lacking in the aiming department. Unless you want to put a laser on each to get a general idea of where you will be shooting. Extended mags are wonderful in almost every situation, especially with pistols. As for propane, I can't really help with that for I use co2. And for the last bit, if it moves, it can be lubed. But you shouldn't have to worry about it too much as long as the slide moves freely."
airsoft,3e20p8,Thatoneguywhofailed,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:44:12 2015 UTC,"I run pistols only on a regular basis, so I should be able to provide some insight.   I purchased a KSC G18 to use outdoors. That was a bad idea. In CQB, you might have a better experience (depending on just how CQB it is). Since you're running 2, you'll be gaining fire power and should be able to run and spray 'n pray like a maniac. If you're the kind of guy that likes to sit back under an umbrella with a sniper and a lemonade, those are not the guns you are looking for.    In terms of accuracy, they're going to be basically just as accurate duel wield as they are single. Which basically means that since they're Maruis, the BBs will be deadly accurate to where you're aiming, but the recoil will throw your shots off. Again, in CQB, doesn't really matter much.   I would definitely go with extended mags, just be weary of how much weight you're throwing on your gear and how many dineros you'll be throwing at this setup.  To be honest, 1 semi-auto Hi-Capa is probably going to be more ""practical"" and whatever overall. But you're going to have 9001x more fun with 2 full auto .45's that make your enemies need new pants.   Yes. Just lube. Smells horrible, but works fine. Just be warned that eventually you'll probably need a new slide. That being said, don't believe the guys that say that Marui slides explode after 5 shots on Green Gas/Propane. They can last thousands of rounds, especially if you take care of them. This is an awesome video covering that subject, and is pretty universal for any GBBP.  The TL;DR is that the most important part is cleaning and lubing the ""rails"" between the slide and the frame. I do it after every game, but I play mostly outdoors and do quite a bit of running through creeks and rolling in mud.   Edit: IDK what's going on with formatting, but the second ""1."" and the ""2."" should be ""2."" and ""3."""

In all of the pistols that I've owned (most of them stock) and seen on the field, the only one I've personally seen fail (and even then, it works; the slide just doesn't lock back any more) was a heavily upgraded WA HRT that had reportedly been run on red gas by its previous owner.

airsoft,3e20p8,parliamentNY,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:29:25 2015 UTC,"Negative.  However, the stupid abounds, so those of us that decide to fly with airsoft guns usually just decide to bite the bullet (so to speak) and declare them as you would real guns so that you don't end up with a shiny new pair of bracelets while you wait for the situation to resolve itself.  As to the original question, in 2013 I spent 3 days in London for work.  During that time I visited Wolf Armouries' brick-and-mortar shop, and purchased a long mag for a Tanaka M700.  All I did (aside from depressurizing it) was leave it in its retail box and put it in my checked baggage."
airsoft,3e20p8,therealvulrath,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:35:20 2015 UTC,"If you're buying the mags in UK, tape the receipt (with item description) on the box. Put a couple of BB's into the mag, so on the x-ray and when they inspect it, they could tell it's not for a real gun. You could also inform the airline at check-in. Place the mags in your check-in luggage somewhere you could get to easily in case they want to examine it.  No need to declare it as firearms with the TSA or locked in a case as long as it's airsoft. If the mags are gas of any kind, don't leave gas in them or have canisters in your luggage. From my experiences coming back from Taiwan & Hong Kong with airsoft guns, it's usually the departing airport that checks more thoroughly. Can't say for sure what the UK regulations are, but I don't think it should be a problem if you could demonstrate it's an airsoft toy."

airsoft,3e20p8,Npf6,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:25:19 2015 UTC,My first guess is that you're accidentally pushing up on the slide catch.
airsoft,3e20p8,Misguidedx,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:33:58 2015 UTC,Would it be down on the slide catch though?
airsoft,3e20p8,Misguidedx,2,Tue Jul 21 16:10:00 2015 UTC,"The slide catch goes upwards to catch the slide, so you would be pushing upwards. I would fire the gun with your thumb away from the slide catch. If the slide does not lock back when your magazine is empty, then it is for sure a mechanical issue.  Does this happen with all magazines? Perhaps there is something jamming the follower in the magazine. When the magazine is empty, a jammed/sticky follower may not push up to engage the slide catch.  Like whitash6 mentioned, it may also be caused by releasing the slide via the slide release. This causes wear on the slide catch and the frame. Over time, this wear may cause the slide to slip past the frame.  However, since your gun is new, it's unlikely that wear should be a problem."

By the same logic, you are restricting your group to only the KC-02 and semi-auto pistols, because every other GBB (including the SOCOM 16, the closest you get to the Mini-14) available has a full-auto setting which no civilian would have. Well, you COULD get the SR-15, but that'd set you back more than a real AR-15 at $900 (which almost gets you a Colt LE6920)."

And fun us a very subjective thing.  It still however doesn't change the fact you are wanting to prevent the good majority of players from playing your game type for no other reason than you dislike their guns. That does not make any sense if you are trying to get more people to play.
airsoft,3e39vb,Chieffy765,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:48:22 2015 UTC,"I didn't know the Škorpion vz. 61 shot that slow, but that's just another reason why I've always liked the M11.  No, I just want the people who play this to be as immersed as possible. Gas operated, bolt carrying systems are far more realistic and I figured other enthusiasts of this 'niche' would opt for them as well. Full auto is not the problem, everyone just needs to run the most realistic (GBB) replicas possible so that nobody has an advantage over them by using an AEG. This was supposed to go hand-in-hand with what that kid I mentioned who longed to play spring airsoft again said about the limited range they had to play with. it didn't matter because they ALL had spring weapons.  The really specific gun restrictions beyond it being GBB are ideas for my personal group (like civilian weapons only.)  edit: Oh, and if you have more fun just shooting an AEG SMG more than firing a GBB SMG I just don't know what to say. We mind as well be speaking different languages at that point."
airsoft,3e39vb,MaceRider,4,Tue Jul 21 20:19:22 2015 UTC,"I'm surprised you're not including AR-style GBBRs and just restricting auto. You gotta figure the bulk of GBBRs in the American market, at an  rate, are AR style (WA/KA/WE/KWA).   Plus, automatics aren't completely out of the realm of possibility. Between pickups off of slain police/military, or those folks who own transferable automatics, there ARE autos out there.   Plus, any room for spring trishots in there?"

airsoft,3e3e9r,Aremnant,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:36:56 2015 UTC,"Don't know how handy you are with DIY stuff, but you could try to build it into the ARES-16 LMG. Externally, they don't look too different from an M4. Other than that, just get a drum."
airsoft,3e3e9r,clinically_alive,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:06:31 2015 UTC,"In real steel terms, a LMG is any machinerifle which is made for the infantry support role at a squad level. In basic terms their duty is to provide covering and offensive fire for the whole squad. To do this, they need to be able to handle sustained automatic fire for several minutes, often with replaceble barrels so you can switch when it becomes too hot.   Some are proprietary and completely built from the ground up like the FN-minimi while others are just reinforced and lightly modified assault rifles like the RPK. They usually use intermediate rifle cartridges like the 5.56 so you can carry more ammo with you and lay down more accurate automatic fire without having a too heavy gun.   In airsoft terms, it's a gun with a good gearbox that can take some serious beating (often an HPA rig) and a drum mag."

airsoft,3e2sex,Boggess,4,Tue Jul 21 14:54:02 2015 UTC,"1:  There should not be air leaking at all.  Track down where the leak is coming from and lubricate the o ring.  If the leak persists, replace the o-ring as needed.  If its coming from the air line into the gun, remove the QD adaptor and inspect the end of the line.  If its worn down, rounded out, or not a flat/level line, get a sharp knife, like an exacto knife and cut off a small portion of the line.  A quarter inch is plenty.  Your'e trying to go for a clean cut line.  2: 95 psi is a solid pressure,  but it seems a bit low.  When I first had in my blue nozzle, I was shooting at 390 fps at 120 psi.  I'm don't know your exact set up, but if youre playing cqb, then 95 psi seems about right IIRC. 3: I've had issues with a p* selector in g&g guns before.  you may want to try a different selector plate on your p* and see what works best.  I've usually taken off the selector plate from the g&g gearbox, and that seems to work just fine from past builds I've done.  IF that doesn't work, try replacing the selector cam, it can be found inside the body of the gun."
airsoft,3e2sex,Ghillieman78,2,Tue Jul 21 15:10:02 2015 UTC,"First off congrats on your purchase!  All of the following answers are based on the assumption that you bought it new in box  1: There is most likely a leak somewhere, if it is not coming from the fitting on the macro line I would recommend bringing it to wherever you bought it and tell them it is leaking, if not contact polarstar directly.  2: 95 psi on the blue nozzle is pretty average, if you want to go super low, its recommended that you run a higher flow nozzle, such as a silver or red, at a lower pressure for the same fps or  Joules.  3: As far as the full auto issue, it could be a few things.  One could be the settings on the fcu itself, the selector plate may not be moving enough the trip the proper switches, or the trigger board could be fried.  Hope this helped!"
airsoft,3e2sex,ketchup530,2,Tue Jul 21 15:13:33 2015 UTC,"There should be no air leak. If it's near the air line connect it's an easy fix. That's pretty normal, most people prefer to use a higher nozzle and a lower PSI for a high fps but low sound and less air used. Most likely a selector plate issue / it was installed incorrectly. I would try reseting the FCU just incase they did something silly with the settings."

My past gun was a Honey Badger but I returned that because I saw this beaut (plus there was a technical problem that wasn't my fault). Honestly, for $10 more I think this is a steal.  It originally came with a Magpul style stubby grip, an extra rubber buttpad (that doesn't fit; it says Victor on it so I'm guessing it's for a replica Vltor stock), a black metal flash hider, and three rubber handguard covers.   After I put my own touch on it I put on a BSA red dot that I got a long time ago (I have a shot shield somewhere), a Magpul replica angled grip (because I'm not paying $35 for one), and a one point sling.   This was well worth the two 12-hour shifts I covered last week. And sorry for the camera quality and the camera work; the Nexus 5's camera is alright and I suck at taking pictures."

I removed the bolts from one of the carry handles, and put them through each of the two side panels, with the panels facing each other. Added the thumb screws back, and presto! An easy bracket to mount any RIS to another RIS! (I drilled new holes in my side panels because my quad rail is slightly-off spec and the bolts needed to be shifted a little.)  I then made my own version of a masterkey with a cheap springer I got for $18 on AirsoftGi. Chopped off the pistol grip with a coping saw, and it fit perfectly.

If I have the best air efficiency and best air seal possible will I be able to shoot 1500 shots?   Though it depends on the energy level you want to achieve I have to say I think it's unlikely; that is a very, very small tank. RedLine quote 700-900 shots; /u/Von_Claussen noted ~1,000 shots in his thread yesterday, not more than half as much again.  I don't really understand why you're limiting yourself to such a small tank; it's not like you're using the AirStock or something. You want a bullpup; even an M82 Barrett won't fit a HPA tank internally, not even an 8c.i. one. If the tank is going to be external, why not just use something a bit bigger?"
airsoft,3e37qu,Pure_Silver,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:34:40 2015 UTC,I plan on trimming the external plastic body on the Aug and mounting the tank behind the magazine on the aug
airsoft,3e37qu,Pure_Silver,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:38:56 2015 UTC,"I can tell you now, unless you want it sticking out the sides it's categorically not going to fit. It's a matter of width; the 13c.i. tanks are 2"" in diameter; the AUG's buttstock is barely half that wide for most of its length, not to mention full of gearbox and/or Polar* FE.  Again, no bullpup rifle - not even a Barrett, I've seen it tried - will take even an 8c.i. tank internally. I doubt even the colossal FN2000 is wide enough. If you want the tank attached to the gun, look at the aforementioned AirStock."

airsoft,3dyt35,Angusthebear,15,Mon Jul 20 17:17:22 2015 UTC,"I think unless your site has extremely weird rules it's very nice but it's not a DMR. A DMR in airsoft means a gun that plays under DMR rules - which usually means higher muzzle energy limit, semi-automatic only, with a minimum engagement distance.  You didn't mention anything about a quick change of the spring or anything, so I'm guessing the muzzle velocity doesn't change between CQB and field, which means either your site has the same muzzle velocity limit for DMRs as it does for regular rifles (in which case it's not really a DMR) or you're not playing to the DMR ruleset (likewise).  Still a nice-looking rifle, though. I think if you want to make the difference between field and CQB more pronounced you could look at getting a second upper receiver for the gun, with a very short barrel to help you turn corners and manoeuvre in tight spaces better."

airsoft,3dyt35,TheCowfishy,0,Mon Jul 20 20:35:41 2015 UTC,it depends. if you have a short barrel like mine (263mm) and go to a standard (363mm) then you will get a slightly noticeable boost in accuracy.

If it's a ""deactivated"" foam filled silencer (meaning they disassembled it and removed the foam, then put it back together), it's actually really light, as it was intended to have foam in the space that on the dummy silencers would have been filled in with cast metal.  Or, he could have said ""fuck it"" and put a foam-filled silencer on it.

Those oil can things are dangerous in my opinion re:constructive possession, but we're getting off topic.   My comment was actually referring to the ATF stance that foam filled airsoft silencers can be used on real guns. They contend that if it lowers the volume of ONE shot by ONE decibel, then it's a real silencer. Doesn't matter if it survives."

airsoft,3e30tv,TheOgrelord,6,Tue Jul 21 15:56:00 2015 UTC,"You're looking to buy new, yes? I live near PAS and can show you around, if you like - just drop me a PM. DEFINITELY go to PAS and not to Wolf Armouries. You should be looking for:  PPE:   Eye & Face Protection: Full-seal goggles (e.g. Bollé's Cobras, £10) are a bare minimum - do not wear shooting glasses for CQB. You may find yourself sweating heavily indoors and steaming up, in which case high-quality mesh full face masks (£20) not unlike a fencing mask may make sense. If you're sticking with goggles, a mesh lower face mask (£15) should be considered mandatory unless you really like visiting the dentist to have your teeth replaced. Boots: High-quality boots are multipurpose and generally a good thing to own. Salomon hiking boots (£125) are very good if you'll use them elsewhere; cheaper boots can be had in the £50-100 range.   Gun:   Primary: You want an AEG assault rifle or SMG; it will be reliable, versatile, and easy to get parts for if you have problems. In your price range (£250-450) I would strongly suggest a Tokyo Marui Recoil Shock, or for less money, a KWA ERG. These guns have recoil, and advanced features like bolt-lock, last-round-feed and stop-on-empty that most AEGs don't. You could also look at ASG's CZ Scorpion Evo, which has similar features but no recoil, and other mid- or high-end AEGs; let me know if you want other suggestions. You will want to upgrade the gun eventually, but unlike in the U.S., U.K. retailers are obliged to warranty your gun - usually for a minimum of a year - and you will void that warranty if you start poking around inside it. Magazines: You will want mid-capacity magazines, and at least four additional to the one supplied with the gun. Budget £15-20 per magazine. Batteries: You will want 2-3 LiPo batteries (~£10 each), a charger (~£10-30) and a battery tester (~£10) from HobbyKing, not from an airsoft retailer. Pick a gun and go from there. Torch: If you're playing in the dark - and it's pitch fucking black in the lower levels of The Mall - you need a torch. Budget £30-100 depending on your preference. Other Accessories: Optional accessories like a tracer unit and/or optics can be considered later. Some (e.g. VFGs and slings) should be bought upfront if you want them.   Gear:   Trousers & Shirt: My standard recommendation to UK airsofters is to buy surplus Forces gear, in either the older DPM (well-suited to British woodland) or the newer MTP (more advanced, but a bit bright for Britain). Surplus gear is widely available in a huge variety of sizes, and it's dirt cheap. However, if you're only going to play indoors CQB, camouflage is less important and you can certainly play in jeans if you like. If there is any chance at all of you playing outside, I would strongly recommend buying camouflage as opposed to black (a common CQB colour). You can always wear camouflage indoors - you'll be seen no matter what you're wearing. Wearing black outside is a sure-fire way to get shot at. Rig: This is more personal, and to be honest you don't need it immediately - you can definitely keep your spare magazines in your trouser pockets. Lightweight options (e.g. a belt rig) have a lot of advantages compared to heavy, bulky plate carriers and the like, especially since you will never be carrying the full combat load those were designed for. Try other styles if you can; budget £100-125 for a complete rig with some HSGI Taco magazine pouches. You ideally want your rig to match your camouflage either identically or roughly in colour and pattern, so first figure out what sort of environment you will be playing in. Gloves: Do not underestimate the pain of being shot in the knuckles at close range. Mechanix or Oakley gloves are £15-25 and worth every penny.   You may also want a helmet if you expect to be playing in cramped conditions a lot or you're reasonably tall - smacking your head on things is very unpleasant."

I'll let the advice sink in and probably plan a set-up and then run it by you later tonight or in the week. Should I look into a secondary immediately or is that something I can leave for a while? I'm 6""1 without shoes so height could be an issue, I'll take your word on that and re-evaluate as needed depending on site though.  I'll probably end up taking you up on that offer of showing me around if you don't mind, any help is appreciated, what site are you usually playing at?"
airsoft,3e30tv,Pure_Silver,3,Tue Jul 21 16:56:13 2015 UTC,"I'll let the advice sink in and probably plan a set-up and then run it by you later tonight or in the week.   No worries and no hurry. Are you familiar with your obligations under the VCRA? If not read up; you should not plan on purchasing a gun until you know your options (most sensibly, buy your gun from somewhere that will keep it for your first three games, alternatively borrow or rent a gun for your first three games) because the system is complex.  I would recommend renting for a game or two before you buy anything anyway, for the key reason that you might end up hating airsoft.   Should I look into a secondary immediately or is that something I can leave for a while?   I own some of the most over-the-top secondaries you can have in airsoft, and find them very rarely used - once a game day, maybe. You definitely do not need one now; better to spend the money on a great primary you'll keep for ages than a mediocre primary and secondary you'll sell at a loss to upgrade.   I'll probably end up taking you up on that offer of showing me around if you don't mind, any help is appreciated, what site are you usually playing at?   Absolutely; someone did it for me when I joined, and I'm happy to pass the favour on. I usually play at Longmoor military base, but also at Billericay and The Mall. PAS is my local; they have an arrangement with RIFT that you might want to investigate if you end up buying a gun from them."
airsoft,3e30tv,Pure_Silver,2,Tue Jul 21 17:04:39 2015 UTC,"Thanks again for the detailed replies, massively helpful!   Yeah, I've looked into the law behind buying RIF's and everything seems pretty fair, will be jumping into my first few games soon so wont be long before I get UKARA membership and everything should be smooth.  It makes sense what you said about secondaries, I can't imagine they're something that's used frequently by those with versatile primaries. I've had another look around PAS and their range doesn't seem huge for Tokyo Marui primaries, would you suggest an alternate supplies for the rifle or does the range they have cover the best?  I appreciate your kindness to an airsoft-noob, am I ok to PM you if I have questions at a later date?"
airsoft,3e30tv,stephenwraysford,2,Tue Jul 21 18:54:53 2015 UTC,"Getting your site membership registered with UKARA is definitely the safest and easiest (though also expensive) way of getting your defence, so I definitely recommend it if you're not put off by the idea of renting or borrowing a gun for the first three games.  Secondaries do have their place, but for the vast majority of players they're a glorified holster-stuffer and basically dead weight. They're not cheap, either - a good pistol and three magazines will easily set you back £200, and a reasonably high-end metal one could be £400 or more. I only use mine in exceptionally close quarters and even then I'd probably be better off carrying the same weight in grenades or more magazines for my rifle. The advantage of a pistol is mostly for extremely close range and for those carrying primaries that have a MED (minimum engagement distance) within which the player must switch to a lower-power secondary weapon.  PAS don't have a great selection of TM's guns; unfortunately, owing to a crackdown on non-CE-marked electronics, they're not as common as they used to be with UK retailers. PAS do a lot of trade in guns that are bluntly a bit cheaper than you're shopping for (WE, G&G) and guns that are about the same price but not as good as Tokyo Marui (VFC). Wolf Armouries in Camden - who I don't like very much - usually have a reasonably good selection of Marui weaponry on-site and KWA's ERGs on their website, as do various other UK sites that you might order from by post. If you're feeling adventurous, you can import TM's entire catalogue at considerable discount from Echigoya but you'll have to pay a local technician (e.g. PAS') to fix it if it goes wrong.  Please feel free to PM me; it's very easy to get your first purchases in airsoft wrong and frankly if I can help someone avoid that, so much the better."
airsoft,3e30tv,rich_monkey,3,Tue Jul 21 19:21:19 2015 UTC,"I've played at the Mall a few times. In addition to the excellent advice already in the thread, I would recommend:  • a quality torch with a strobe function and a rail attachment. Fenix or Surefire. You can buy pressure pads for it later. If you're going to play twice a month at the Mall I'd also buy a mini tripod to clip your torch into.   • consider a pistol if you have money left, as there are plenty of nooks and crannies to poke around. I have a WE PX4 compact which is tiny little and easy to maneuver with. The Mall plays plenty of single-shot games so you won't be at a disadvantage.  • knee pads - you only need a nail in your knee once. always have knee pads  In terms of stores, PAS is a good place to shop for gear. There's a milsurp store by Waterloo station called Waterloo Camping that will get you kitted out with camo, boots, gloves and bags if you want. I've also heard good things about Silverman's over in East London for chest rigs.   The Mall is a great site. You should also visit the Sandpit in Dartford (a damn sight easier to get to than the Mall also and IMO the best airsoft experience in the M25), TWA in Croydon (not my favourite by a long way but worth a try) and Epsom Elite Action (""Epsom Tunnels"")."

Nothing against you older players (I'm almost 30 myself), I know kids do it too, but what's the deal with a grown adult throwing a temper tantrum?  Regardless of how old someone is, there shouldn't be any tolerance for anyone acting like that even if they're in the right. It gives the whole game a bad rep and makes for a crappy rest of the day for anyone involved.  The fact that they didn't want to do anything because he's on a team is a red flag for me. I get that teams bring business, but if a field is going to cater to bad players just because it means more money, you don't want to be playing at that kind of field.

airsoft,3e14gy,TheVelocirapist,11,Tue Jul 21 03:46:47 2015 UTC,"Because the instance a scenario is trying to be taken seriously, it falls apart very quickly (at least within non strict-milsim games).  Every single time I've seen a game with a strong scenario basis, it falls through about halfway through the day. Why? Because a large majority of players don't really care. It's always the leaders, veterans of airsoft, and long-time players who focus more on objectives and winning. Newer and younger players typically want to live out their CoD fantasies and simply go force on force (not saying that every teenager is like that though). Lack of proper comms is also huge - I have yet to see more than 50% of a team have proper communications equipment all at one time. This usually leads to a game scenario collapsing fairly quickly, and people just start focusing on kills and not much on completing objectives.  From my perspective, having extremely strict scenario rules is hard to enforce. This is why IMO it's easier to see more coordination and MILSIM-type games from the older players since those games' entry fees are so high (typically not within financial reach of the average teenager).   So it seems the majority of players who go out on the weekends typically favor force on force battles anyways; when you tell them otherwise, usually they won't listen."

airsoft,3e14gy,Nickvr628,2,Tue Jul 21 08:44:01 2015 UTC,Right. Most people don't want to be a zombie because it means getting shot at and hit repeatedly. I have unloaded on my fair share of zombies myself.
airsoft,3e14gy,lizanawow,3,Tue Jul 21 12:12:06 2015 UTC,"Zombie games happen, but it have a huge problem, for the game to be fun for the survivors, you need at minimum 3-4 times the number of zombies to survivors, to really get the zombie horde feel you need 5-10x the people.  So for a team of 5 survivors you need 25-50 people who don't get to play and just get to be shot or hit.  That means the zombie game is only fun for a very small amount of the people at any given time.    Objective games happen as well, my husband has a all day scenario game with missions and such happening just later this year, and it takes 2-3 months of work to plan it and a lot of behind the scenes work.   Night Games are dangerous and carry a high insurance risk and have the hard time of getting a day and time people can play.  During the summer you would not be able to start a game till almost 9 pm.  That means 2-3 games tops before people with jobs have to go because they have to sleep for work in the morning.

We only played with spring guns because everything else would be too easy. Zombies could take six shots to the body, head shots counted double. We had a spring revolver that counted as three hits. Zombies stayed dead for 30 seconds and got back up, and the game started out with 1 zombie for every 5 players in the group. So for 10 guys, 2 would start off as zombies. The last two players left as humans we the zombies after the game was over. We played full contact (i.e. you're not dead until the zombie drags you to the ground), but flag football style worked when we had females or younger kids play with us. Be part it is a super easy investment (a walmart springer and .12, and a mask are cheap) and we played in our backyards very often. Games lasted like 15 minutes and the game ended when all the humans were dead.  May not be the format you're looking at but to me its the best way to do it so everyone has fun and plays both roles."

airsoft,3e14gy,ScruffStuff,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:30:15 2015 UTC,"My buddy created a game type that he calls Breakdown, that simulates a collapse of society. Basically, everyone starts with basic ""civilian"" weapons (mostly pistols, shotguns) and walk outward from a circle in the middle of the field for 200 paces. Prior to the game, a marshal stashes loot like medical supplies, ammo, weapons, and objectives all across the field. Your goal is to obtain the most objectives, and get out alive. You can choose to form alliances, kill everyone you see, backstab, or any other strategy. It gets intense when everyone starts getting into it. Near the end of the game, everyone wants to win, so it heats up pretty quick. It's a blast."

One of my buddies invited me to play Airsoft and I was in love with it straight away!  Clothing? You can literally wear anything. Jeans and a t-shirt was what I wore the first time I went. I hit up a couple of Army Surplus stores where I managed to get a MTP Jacket, a UBACS and MTP Trousers for around £30 all in! Best to check in there to try on for size and fit. (People always say check eBay but more often than not you get mugged off buying kit that probably won't fit!)  You can either buy a Two-Tone gun from the getgo (If you are 18+ of course...) or play 3 times at a site for longer than a time period (forgotten what it is!) and get registered for your unique UKARA code (UKARA Website) and get yourself a lovely looking rifle!  Where abouts do you live, and how far are you willing to travel to play?  Make sure you grab yourself some boots, they don't have to be decent.. just be enough for you not to fall over and sprain your ankle.  Eye protection also, if you are -18 you will be told you will have to wear full face at all times... If your not... then probably go to a local Airsoft shop and try some mesh goggles on. Personally I hate them, but I tried them on to see if my face fit!  Don't go spending a hella-lotta money straight away, start small and work your way up :)  A"

I am 19 years old and live in south west london, so preferably looking to stick in the local area, possibly reachable by public transport.  Yeah I will need to go ahead and find a surplus store and get some gear, I used to be a cadet and had the lot, but of course I grew out of it. Id like a helmet which I can mount the GoPro I got for christmas on to it.  I cant blow a lot of money on this anyway, I dont get a lot of it (£4.29 an Hour!!!) So I will try and build it up slowly.  Unfortunately my two gas pistols are broken and I dont have the first clue where to take them to have them fixed and not sure how much its going to cost. But I do have my trusty spring shotgun at hand. Id like to at least have a side arm, i do have a holster for it but i need other things like the camo, padding, boots etc."
airsoft,3e2cd6,NandosLoL,2,Tue Jul 21 13:07:02 2015 UTC,"Try hitting up the Bunker. It's run by UCAP, and I'm pretty sure they are offering free rentals at the moment so you just have to pay a walk-on fee... (Don't hold me to that though!)  Dude that's awesome, definitely go for a helmet if you can then.  If you are around Camden way, Wolf Armouries has a shop which I'm sure they might be able to help you out with fixing them.   The Bunker I mentioned is actually CQB so you take your shotty there and use it as your Primary weapon? While still waiting for your UKARA to come through!  When you get to a site, be sure to ask fellow Airsofters about their guns... I did! They let me hold the weight of theirs, even let me fire a few BB's off too. We love bragging about our gear :P"

(set of 12, so they will last me a while)  All stock parts except the fill valve o-rings from evike... so I haven't even improved the gun, rather just fixed it. I was hard on this gun, and didn't bother to clean/oil hardly ever.  I sorta want to buy your TM 226 now ;P"

airsoft,3e1p6i,viper_polo,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:51:44 2015 UTC,Spray paint with a matte clear protective layer is the cheapest option and gets the job done as long as there is no dripping. Stencils also work when done properly and can be made easily with some tape and patience.
airsoft,3e1p6i,Thatoneguywhofailed,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:48:25 2015 UTC,"This is a good tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqQ0U8J7gHU  For designs, you can use stencils or masking tape.  Ensure that you do not paint over important items.  A long lasting paint job usually has these steps:  Sand, Spray primer, Sand (lightly), Spray paint, Clear coat,  You can get away with just spray painting over your current gun, but it depends on how much action your rifle will see."

Unfortunately medium is the smallest size that vest comes in and it was relatively expensive. I'll just have to stick with it. It's not terrible.

You can also adjust the tension on the holster, you didn't mention doing that (that part seems a little obvious, but figured I'd mention it).  And ""RTI"" is G-code's proprietary system. They make adapters for other brands, like safariland, but if you're getting a new holster anyway, I'd just use the system the other company provides. Poke around g-code's website (I think it's tacticalholsters.com or something) and you'll see the adapters)."

The thing with Cymas is that even for the cheaper ones, they come with a european 220v charger... and it cost 6 bucks extra for a normal charger... That may not seem like much, but the only CYMA tactical AKs that appealed to me were at least 199 bucks, and with 2 extra mags and a speed loader that i really need, plus the taxes and shipping, it goes into the 300 bucks.. I also need to buy goggles and a vest that i'm buying from another website, i don't have much money to spend on things like that for now.... I already had a budget established and i can't really go over it... As much as i'd like a CYMA, i can't afford it.... sorry...

He's got some good feedback from selling on other subs so I want to believe he took good care of it. I did take it out to see if I could replace the spring but I'm pretty sure I put everything back correctly.

airsoft,3e0e8h,lizanawow,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:59:25 2015 UTC,You could have compromised the air seal or damaged the hop up.  That is why everyone always says leave TM guns alone.  They aren't made to run stronger springs.

airsoft,3e070p,Ninovoa,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:41:26 2015 UTC,"Well the mosfet takes the current and tells the motor to spin. So if you remove it, you're just making a circuit when you plug in the battery (that's why it fires as soon as you plug in the battery).  Is this a simple mosfet (like not BTC/burst wizard/ASCU)? Because some have built in electrical fuses that need to reset if ""blown"". Like instead of literally blowing fuses because your shimming is too tight, or your motor height is too high, the mosfet recognizes that and stops the current before it can do any real damage. Repeatedly doing that will kill your mosfet though (if that's even the case).  I would definitely recommend taking a look at your wiring again, making sure all your connections are properly soldered. Make sure your shimming and motor height are all good. I've had times where a mosfet doesn't quite work, or something sounds bad, so I open the gearbox and take everything out and put it back in and it's fine. Some things are finicky..."

When you have it, you set the pace; if you move first before they're ready to deal with you (i.e you rush forward and turn that corner right when they reach it, or rush forward unexpectedly while sweeping the corner with full-auto), you get first hits, which usually means you win.  If they are ready for you and took the initiative by setting up flanking fire with teammates, it will fail and you will get hit instead, but that requires more teamwork which most pickup games don't have, and you can overcome this by sending a portion of your own team around to flank them in a pincher movement."

If my gun is at my hip then my left hand (which is on the barrel) would be dominant in moving the gun but my right hand would help a little. Did I answer this right?"
airsoft,3dzvss,Popebenedictkickas,2,Mon Jul 20 21:54:51 2015 UTC,thank you it actually answer my question !  but i find it strange that the weak hand actually aim because its the weak hand its supposed to be worst :D
airsoft,3dzvss,Popebenedictkickas,2,Mon Jul 20 21:58:30 2015 UTC,Well u have the most range of motion with your hand that far out while your right hand is tucked close to u. But if we were talking pistols my right hand does most of the work.
airsoft,3dzvss,MaceRider,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:34:51 2015 UTC,"Both arms are moving the gun most of the time. This is the case both in pistols and in rifles - you have both hands on the gun most of the time. In cases when you do not, you are usually in a situation where you cannot choose to have both hands on the gun (reloading while keeping the weapon shouldered, manipulating something with your other hand, possibly injured and unable to move one of your hands/arms), but in cases like that, exact precision isn't what you are expecting."

In general JG's most popular replicas - G36 and Sig get mixed reviews, people often complain on performance, but don't forget that these are budget replicas and especially older models are made by chinese manufacturers, where you can get really nice working one or moderate gun from the same series (I think it's due to quality control which wasn't that strict as it is nowadays - quality of Chinese made airsoft guns is much better now).   6 years ago I had G36K from JG and was very satisfied, it worked very well and I never had any problems - I only swapped the hop up rubber to Systema. Here I have stock gun, nothing was changed and it - also works very well. I have no objections because I've got more than I paid for. I wanted to have a CQB gun but it occured it works well enough that I can take it to the forest because it has surprisingly good range and is quite precise, something that I didn't expect.   Sig's aren't popular where I live (Poland) and previous owner dropped the price to just 70 usd because noone was keen on taking it - it's probably due to availability of the mags. I had to pay additional 54 usd to get mid-caps and they were ordered from HK because I couldn't get any in Europe.    But as I said - these are budget replicas and you can't expect performance as in KWA or Tokyo Marui ;)."

There are many, many guides to dealing with those, and they should all (more or less) apply to what you've got. The trigger contact system looks to be the same as what other AUGs have, too.  The easiest way to get the run-back in is to remove the gear it acts on, put the thing back in its hole, and then put the gear back in its place by pushing the thing out of the way. That's a lot easier, because you're then not trying to force a tiny, grease-covered part into position while its spring is under compression. A lot of people recommend holding it in place with a strong magnet under the gearbox shell once it's back in position.   I hope that helps!"

When you're playing with the small space in the handguard that's important.  7.2V NiMH probably won't be able to turn the gun over, it won't be able to supply enough power.

You will find 7.2 lipos will have the same power as a 9.6 nimh, but a 7.2 nimh won't really be best for your gun.    And I don't run lipos because I don't want something up near my face to risk exploding if my gun shorts.  And yes it can happen, it is rare, but it happens.  I have also seen a lipo that was dropped and hit a rock when being loaded, about 40 minutes late it failed by fire.  Luckily the guy just had it on a table not in his vehicle.

Green lasers are more powerful than red ones by quite a bit and unless it's a high quality US-made one it likely has no IR filter on it so you could be damaging someone's eyes and not even know. If you really want a laser (you don't need one) then get a low-power red one where you can't see the beam during the day but can see the dot. You should be able to get by just using your hand to direct teammates. Even if you're not aiming it directly at anyone people are unpredictable and someone could somehow move to where the beam enters their eye.   I'm sorry if I sound at all inconsiderate but this is a game and no one needs to loose their eyesight. Use all the gadgets you want, but leave the lasers at home, they're not necessary and can ruin much more than someone's day."

airsoft,3dz4eg,NOFF44,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:31:18 2015 UTC,using amo pouches for everything is what most people in the military do. IMO most airsofters are carrying way to much gear in way to many pouches. You want to feel if you are being hit.  That being said one pouch I find extremely useful is pistol mag pouches. You can put a speedloader or a flashlight in them.  Another good pouch to have is a magazine drop pouch on your hip. Try to find as minimal a pouch for this as possible. We had some fancy ones to replace our old ones and they got snagged on everything and magazines constantly got jammed up as you tried to put them in during speed drills.  If you want to set up a really good kit do what cosplayers do and get yourself a reference image. Go off your reference image and try to get the same pouches as the guys in your image.

I like the idea of using Stanag mags with G36, but most of adapters are ambidexterous, which results mainly in accidental mag releases because you press the release button to your chest rig / pouches :P.

airsoft,3dysrz,drk_evns,7,Mon Jul 20 17:10:58 2015 UTC,"Not trying to be rude here, but you did the standard ""throwing a scope on a gun makes it a DMR, right?""    DMRs are rifles that have extra range over your squad mates.  150 feet of range is pretty standard for most aegs.  You're going to want to hit closer to that 250+ foot mark. I'm going to start the ""Get a prommy barrel and bucking"" train.  In my completely stock vfc gearbox, I'm using a prowin hop up, prommy purple bucking, and a prommy 363 inner barrel, very original, I know.  With this set up, I'm easily hitting guys at 250 feet with .28s .  The prommy hype train isn't a wrong way to go. For your set up, I'd keep the Krytac hop up unit (from what I've heard its pretty decent!) If you've got the coin, get a PDI barrel or a prommy barrel.  A good bucking will go a long way, pun sort of not intended... The reaps bucking, prommy purple, modify flat hop, and the g&g green bucking (flat hopped) are all excellent choices.    Barrel stabilization will also further increase your accuracy.  Using small o rings along your barrel can work, if you've got enough room in your outer barrel. If thats too tight, try using a layer of teflon tape in a barber pole style down your barrel.  Repeat this until you get a snug  fit without having to force it into the barrel.  If you need any help, or have any further questions, ask away.  I know I just bombarded you with info."

You can get better than that, of course, but I'd call those distances 'usable' and worthy of labelling a gun a DMR..."

airsoft,3dysrz,MaceRider,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:34:27 2015 UTC,"in addition to some of the things others mentioned here, a big part of a DMR is consistency.  This can be accomplished by small diy mods like stabilizing the barrel, shimming your hop up arm, flat hopping or rhopping, glueing the air nozzle to the tappet plate, sealing the bucking to the barrel with floss or teflon, teflon tapping your cylinder head, ect...  These things will keep your fps from varying too greatly and also ensure that your bbs will travel on basically the same trajectory with each shot.  As a DMR you should only be shooting Semi Auto so you want to know that when you put your reticle on a Tango  and pull the trigger, that that shot is gonna go where its supposed to."

airsoft,3dysrz,The_Mexx,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:59:47 2015 UTC,Decent SMGs are 50 - 150 feet and decent rifles are 120 to 180 ft if but at the same time I've seen some M4's shoot 50-75 feet and I've seen an MP5 hit a human sized target at 225 feet... so the 50 - 150 and 120 - 180 isn't perfect and if you wish to achieve that you'll need the right bucking and BB's

If you're handy with tools then you can bore out the outer barrel to fit an extended inner barrel in it.

airsoft,3dxv3f,snakebitey,2,Mon Jul 20 14:50:09 2015 UTC,"Wouldn't recommend running one as a primary, your trigger finger will be sad from the heavy pull after a few games!  I've got good results from mine with r-hop on the stock barrel, running on propane and 0.40g BBs.  The stock internals are great, so really the only things to do upgrade are a decent aftermarket barrel, and HPA tapping would make it even more consistent. I'm sticking with propane though as it's consistent enough, and having a trailing hose (and swapping it over when changing mags) doesn't seem like fun on a pistol.  If you want to stay below 350 fps don't get a longer inner barrel. Not sure why you would anyway - it won't improve accuracy over standard length, and it'll just reduce the effectiveness of the awesome suppressor. Plus you'll lose the option of taking the suppressor off for tighter close engagements."

I would expect to see some aftermarket support soonish.  The inner barrel (atleast in my first gen ver of this gun) has notches cut abit different than the standard GBB inner barrels. So most inner barrels will not work as of now.  But because the hopup is basically the same as the TM hi capa line, some of those upgrades can be used.   The maple leaf i key is a stupid easy flat hop, and their hopup wheel are great improvements. I have these in my TM MK23 and am hitting 200 feet with ease using green gas and .25's"

I've owned a fair few (currently have two), but I've never had one break spectacularly (well one cylinder did explode but beyond that...). Like any other AEG it runs best when you keep it in shape and make sure it's not getting unnecessary wear. I've had and seen PTWs run for years and years without issue, but most require some servicing now and again.  There is a learning curve to teching PTWs, but once you get used to it I'd say it's far, far easier to take care of than any AEG or GBBR.   There are some things to keep in mind when getting one; the off-brands are most often very unreliable QC-wise, try and get it moisture protected and lock the hop roller for more consistency. If you have any specific questions, feel free to ask.  EDIT: Forgot to add that yes I do like them very much, and it would be hard to go back to an AEG that isn't really well teched."

airsoft,3duag1,Vauun,1 point,Mon Jul 20 06:27:59 2015 UTC,"As long as it's a free choice you're happy with go for it!   There are however a number of people who have died from SWAT teams showing up at their home despite them being innocent.  http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/headlines/2014/05/baby-in-coma-after-police-grenade-dropped-in-crib-during-drug-raid/  http://abcnews.go.com/US/tucson-swat-team-defends-shooting-iraq-marine-veteran/story?id=13640112  http://www.metrowestdailynews.com/article/20110501/News/305019966/?Start=3  http://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/30/us/30lima.html?_r=0  And so so many more examples (not to mention the sheer amount of dogs that get shot during raids as well, innocent or not). Also take a look at the mental trauma/emotional scarring it can cause by watching videos from people who have been ""swatted"" and articles surrounding it.   It's in general nothing you can just shrug off just because it later turns out you were innocent/they were in the wrong because every second between them entering and they finding that out (which can be an undefined amount of time) they will come in with explosive aggression and treat you and everyone in your house as a lethal threat, including any family members or house guests you might have over to visit. There is no way knowing how they will react, you might be holding something in your hands when they enter that they believe is a weapon and in the split second it takes the team to make the decision it can easily end up wrong.  (Just look at the 911 transcript with Police unit 664 in The Verge's article on swatting, where police is standing outside and saying that they see a knife in his hand and he looks agitated. Because under stress it's easy to make assumptions, and when you work in a field where your constantly faced with threat it's easy to see it wherever you're looking.)  And some people might not care or be located where it's relevant but having Police/task forces show up outside your house and break down your door can have devastating effects on relationships with neighbours/causing you to be ostracised.   And if one had the misfortune to be wrongfully accused for a crime that had any type of media attention one can be sure that those are the pictures the media will be using and focus on setting a narrative and a stamp that can be hard to recover from even after one has been cleared of suspicions.  These are all real examples that have actually happened and there is no way of knowing what situation one might be in tomorrow, but as long as the uploading/sharing of a non-blurred photo is voluntary then in short I see no problem with it since it's done with that persons own values/risk assessment.  (Plus my risk assessment might differ from yours or anyone else's based on a number of factors like where you live and what kind of community it is, some are more vulnerable than others. Also things like social status/income levels and other factors comes into play when looking at the likelihood, but my personal opinion is that it's not worth it. To each his own!)"

One tip that took me ages to learn was to 'hold' on the target after hitting them. That way, you get high quality footage that people will be able to take in and enjoy!   Also, if you've got image stabilisation in your camera it's worth while turning that on as it can give you a smoother looking shot. But on the other hand, as this is dmr game play you might be looking for the more frantic style of video :-)."

Together with someone that had some experience we got through and didn't see any targets, but we were close to their spawn. I had to drop a bomb inside an area, so the only logical thing to do was ask for some cover, run the 10 meters and hope I could drop the bomb before getting hit. I didn't get hit, but got tackled, flew a few feet and hit a wall. KO for a moment. Hurts a lot, think I bruised a rib.

airsoft,3dutcp,BQJJ,11,Sun Jul 19 20:49:33 2015 UTC,"Kinda depends on my mood, I suppose. I'm much more conservative with my BBs, now.

Some days I'll sit back and wait for an opportunity, other days I'll make my own opportunities and just charge out.  I think one thing I've learned (not that I was ever real bad about it, but it's definitely something I've noticed) is to just let shit happen. Oh, you didn't feel that hit? Oh well, it's just a game. Fuck, that guy hit me three times in a row. No biggie, I'll just get him next round.  Airsoft is cool like that. Every game or round can be totally different, and it's incredibly fun to adapt on the fly."

airsoft,3dutcp,needanacc0unt,6,Sun Jul 19 20:59:42 2015 UTC,"Some things I've learned that I can summerize that have allowed me to rek people. And also has gotten me rekt.  Patience is key  Watching the enemy to see what they do. How they take cover, etc. Works way better than instantly unloading on their cover. Just wastes your ammo. Take your time and just wait for him to pop out.   Semi-auto is love. Semi-auto is lyfe.  A single accurate bb shot is way more effective than spraying and praying. When you go full auto into the approx area I'm in it just tells everyone where you are. bbgats are louder than you think, and when I'm sitting still watching/hearing you I can pinpoint exactly where you are.  Also some theory about buckings warming up as bbs pass through lowering the accuracy/consistency.  Be random  One example I can show is when I was facing off a guy across a street once. he was dumping full auto into me and I was around a corner only with a shitty gbb pistol. He was exposed and would spray when I peeked, but he was too slow to react so by the time I saw where he was I went back into cover just to hear bbs passing by me.  I kept peaking while standing up and then crouched, peeked and took a shot. Hit him. He expected me to peek standing up, but was surprised when I was near the ground.  Movement > Camouflage  Camo in airsoft does almost nothing. It helps, but in reality most of the things that give you away are movement. Going back to what I said before about patience. Moving slow is key. People tend to run around and even through a bunch of brush you can easily see where they are. Move slow. Take your time. Be sneeki. Be a bushwookie.  Comms should be more important than your rifle  You can try to be as organized as you can, but if you dont have proper comms your squad or team will fall apart instantly. You're going with your team, one dies and has to respawn. You lose him, then another, then another. Get a reliable comms system that works and learn to use it."

As long as I know that they don't take action on people with them, I won't really care.  I have GMRS Motorola walkies, but only 2 work out of 5 (three just need new batteries). They are decent, but the issue arises of the enemy having access to them. We use them really to talk to each other mostly out of game, when heading back to the safe zone when we got split up. Or to ask a team mate if they have an extra mag to borrow. We all briefly discussed getting real comms, and headsets, because the speakers are either too loud or too quiet. What headsets or accessories do you have? Most on my team don't want to spend money. And then there's me, who spends money on whatever the fuck I think would be cool haha."

airsoft,3du9fi,Jermenizzle,3,Sun Jul 19 15:11:21 2015 UTC,So a few days ago I got an A&K MK46 in the mail. I didn’t really like how boring the gun looked so I painted it.   For the base coat I used Rustoleum Khaki. Then I ever so slightly hit it with Aervoe Field Drab and Aervoe Coyote. I think this produces a nice effect since it causes the gun to become multiple shades of tan instead of one single color. Next I used a piece of a laundry bag as a stencil to create a snakeskin effect. The snakeskin pattern was done with Krylon Brown and then softened up with Rustoleum Khaki.

airsoft,3du9fi,PriceZombie,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:44:56 2015 UTC,"This is what I used.  My only tip would be, after you do the snakeskin, try blending it with the background color. It makes the pattern more subtle IMO."

The tubing you typically use is semisoft silicone and you have way more surface area than regular buckings.  HS5 has a standing request to show him a worn down patch, no one has taken him up on it as of ~2011 I believe.  LRB is sort of a weird outdated Japanese mod that people typically don't do because its hard to do correctly.  I think /u/snakebitey did one but I could be wrong."
airsoft,3dwei3,jules_fait_fer,4,Mon Jul 20 03:01:12 2015 UTC,"I've not done one yet, but I will be in my M500 shotgun when I find some charging arms for it...  They're supposed to be more consistent than r-hops, but they're not adjustable so you're stuck to the BB weight and fps you set it up to.  Many of the builds I see now use both r-hop and LRB, giving the consistency of LRB with adjustability of r-hop..... I'll believe it if/when I see it though.  I've had fantastic results from r-hops so far though, they're definitely the way forward :)"
airsoft,3dwei3,snakebitey,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:38:49 2015 UTC,What do you mean by outdated? I saw a post on  some sniper forum were someone made an lrb and secured it in place with melted wax between his inner and outer barrel. He was getting a 3x3 inch grouping at 215 feet with his stock barrel (6.08) I think. I totally agree that lrb is difficult and limits your ammunition but I don't see how it has been replaced and is out of date. There is a YouTube video of someone hitting 300 foot shots prone in a crosswind with an aeg... and an lrb mod
airsoft,3dwei3,jules_fait_fer,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:30:52 2015 UTC,"Not a bad result, just a really tedious one.  Rhop just necessitates tuning a patch and you have an adjustable tack driver.  Doesn't take that long.  LRB limits your adjustability entirely and is a messy process in comparison.  Same results with a more involved process seems outdated to me.  Those results sound similar to rhop accuracy, at any rate.  I wouldn't count LRB out for the sake of perfection, but I like more adjustability than that."
airsoft,3dwei3,SenshiHiro,1 point,Mon Jul 20 10:39:02 2015 UTC,"I don't know but it's s very interesting idea. My first question is how much back spin can the barrel give? I'm thinking that the BB and barrel are both pretty smooth so there wouldn't be much friction.   My follow up question is how much friction does an R-Hop patch have. It's not rubber pushing on the BB but rather part of a plastic hose cut to shape. Maybe you don't need too much friction?  Either way, cool post."
airsoft,3dwei3,yamar35,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:42:42 2015 UTC,"LRB's nowadays are used to improve the shot to shot consistency, while the hopup actually applies 90% of the hop.  The hopup spins the BB, the LRB forces it into riding the same path along the top of the barrel, so every BB leaves the barrel at almost the exact same place, in the almost exact same direction.  In an non LRB, the BB can bounce around slightly, which leads to small deviations, which turn into large ones at 300'.  The LRB adds a small amount of backspin, but not much. The barrel end tends to be only 2-5mm lower than the hopup, it is a VERY slight curve. Only enough to ""stick"" the BB to the top.  One other advantage, is in some adjustable LRB setups, you can actually correct for left or right hooks by ""bending"" the barrel at an angle.  TL;DR: Useful, and they do work, but only if you know what to do with them. A standard ER-hop will serve you 95% as well, but some people want that last 5%."

airsoft,3du4oc,poo_finger,5,Sun Jul 19 15:33:30 2015 UTC,"You need to iniatate a challenge call system. This is very common practice at large ops. Essentially you have a challenge word, often a number, which you will yell to the person in your sights. If they get it wrong they get tagged. You need to change the challenge frequently to keep the enemy from figuring it out but it's highly effective. Example of using a number: you make your challenge 15. His counter to your call needs to equal 15. If you yell 7 he better reply 8. Often times pepole will hear you shouting these numbers back and forth and not even realize it's a challenge, whereas if you yell burger and the counter is cheese that's not too hard to figure out what's going on. It needs to be something that leaves the counter rather open ended though. That can keep the enemy from figuring out what you're doing.   So many times I've been approached by the green team when I'm black in thick woods and they do the typical ""green?"" shit. Of course I say green back and light them up as soon as I have a shot. This has also backfired on me when my own team mates tried to dupe the enemy by shouting green, to which I reply green then we end up wasting each other in a massive blue on blue."

I know that sort of thing happens from time to time, but it shouldn't be a regular occurrence unless your field has a weird layout or you're playing with complete idiots.  In my experience, it usually happens because the guys in the back laying down support fire into an enemy position can't actually see what's happening up front with our friendlies, and we don't usually have radios with everyone on the team.  Move into the position and keep your head down until word that the position has been taken has been passed down the line to those of us laying down suppressive fire on the position."

Had a lovely conversation with the manager and took some pictures of their Webley Mk6.    Revolvers are awesome, whoever disagrees is wrong. And the Webley MkVI is no exception. To be honest it's extra awesome because of the break action.  Video of the awesome shell ejection  (Has slow motion capability with youtube)  The Britbongs made one neat revolver, and Gun Heaven made a really nice replica. The external quality and weathered finish are spectacular. As you can imagine it feels quite realistic (well, real).  The trigger is oh-so-smooth in both SA and DA. Friend that is unfamiliar with guns had no trouble with it. Firing it is loud as hell and quite accurate.  It uses a 12g CO2 cartridge in the grip and shoots a bit hot (like WinGun revolvers). I plan on using the SHS refillable green gas cartridge to bring down the velocity.  Also pictured is the RUGER Leather handmade MK6 holster, which...well it's nice and it works as intended! No loose threads or wear, the leather seems to be great quality but I guess I'm not an expert. Definitely worth a purchase to go with your new Webley MK6.

airsoft,3dwdxt,lizanawow,3,Mon Jul 20 02:22:22 2015 UTC,I own both the ESS Turbo Fans and the Revision Desert Locust w/ Fan System. I prefer the Revision personally. I find the foam seal on the ESS goggles to be more annoying when sweaty than the rubber seal on the Revision.
airsoft,3dwdxt,SenshiHiro,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:47:48 2015 UTC,"My Desert Locusts slid around on my face when I started sweating, so I cut off the strap and attached them with the NVG bungees on my helmet. No more sliding, Desert Locusts rock."
airsoft,3dwdxt,Plasmus642,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:33:44 2015 UTC,The locusts are also a bit closer to the face and give you better vertical visibility. This makes a big difference when you are trying to find something on your gear. The ESS ones block all that vision whereas the Locusts don't and to me that is a big benefit.
airsoft,3dwdxt,BrightCandle,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:58:43 2015 UTC,"I was planning to get ESS turbofans but I kept holding off. On prime day you could get a used one for $45 after taxes with the 15% off warehouse deals. I kept lolly gagging and as a result they are now $68 used ._. ...  If you get a counterfeit one on Amazon then it'll be a easy return anyway :D... D:  Decided to go with arena flakjaks for $25 new instead :c  My ESS land ops were pretty good. If you buy used, the lenses may be scratched and the foam will likely be deteriorated. Good fit overall."
airsoft,3dwdxt,pyotr_the_great,3,Mon Jul 20 11:08:18 2015 UTC,"I personally have really liked the revision line, and have used the desert locust goggles, bullet ant goggles and stinger hawk glasses.   I would highly recommend, my experiences with them I have had no fogging and only condensation from sweat dripping onto the lenses for the goggles.   The desert locust is a little crowded with my mask, but the bullet ant has ample room for my mask."
airsoft,3dwdxt,chillyrabbit,2,Mon Jul 20 03:14:47 2015 UTC,I think the Desert locusts are and with the fan they are really quite fog resistant. Combine that with the thermal lenses and you have about the best anti fog very high rated eye wear you can reasonably get.

airsoft,3dve45,Quazaria7892,2,Sun Jul 19 21:06:22 2015 UTC,"Sounds like your output valve oring is either dried up or needs replacing.  First thing I'd try is remove the base plate of the mag and undo one of the big plugs from the bottom (make sure there is no gas in the mag). Then hold the magazine upside down and pour some silicon oil into the bottom of the mag where you removed the plug. Hold the release valve in for about 30 seconds so the oil can flow down into it then open and close it a few times. Put a bit of gas in the mag and dump it out to clear the oil before using it in the gun.  If that doesn't work then you need to replace the output valve oring, which is very simple to do but you will need a valve key to remove the output valve from the mag. Then go to a hardware store and by some 2.57 x 1.78 mm orings and replace the oring on the piece of the valve that moves when you press the button.  I noticed in the video you posted that you are using propane to fill your mags, are you putting some silicon oil in the adapter before filling? Otherwise the propane will dry out the orings.  Hope this giant post is helpful."

airsoft,3dv2mv,iampillzbury,2,Sun Jul 19 19:28:47 2015 UTC,"I think you are confused somewhere... mAh is a measurement of battery power over time.  Its basically how many shots you can get out of a battery, not how powerful the battery is.  I could run my gun with a 7.4 100 mAh battery, just not for a lot of shots..."
airsoft,3dv2mv,lizanawow,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:45:03 2015 UTC,"I could run my gun with a 7.4 100 mAh battery, just not for a lot of shots...    You really couldn't unless you had some super amazing discharge rate on the thing or the gearbox was set up to draw very little current. The motor would need to draw way more current than the battery could provide and the gun wouldn't cycle. Might even kill the battery if you don't have safety measures in the electrical system."
airsoft,3dv2mv,Arg0ms,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:45:29 2015 UTC,"I've run a standard AEG on a 300mAh 35-70C 2S (you can get them in 45-90C now), worked fine. I think you might have missed his (valid) point.  OP, a Turnigy 2S 1200mAh 15-25C LiPo is cheap as from HobbyKing, but FWIW the 1400mAh is almost the same price and size. Like lizanawow says, a lower mAh might give you less capacity (i.e. shots), but that doesn't mean it won't run the gun fine. That 1200 will give you about 3-4 high caps on an M4, about 3 AK high caps, and will fit up a buffer tube fine. Let me know if you need a link to it."
airsoft,3dv2mv,someguyfromnz,1 point,Mon Jul 20 10:29:00 2015 UTC,That's multiple times the typical discharge rate of batteries you commonly see used in airsoft.
airsoft,3dv2mv,Arg0ms,1 point,Mon Jul 20 11:37:22 2015 UTC,"Yes it was hyperbole, but mAh does not play a role in if your gun will cycle or not was my point."
airsoft,3dv2mv,lizanawow,0,Mon Jul 20 00:51:52 2015 UTC,"That's not accurate, a battery's maximum power output is a direct product of its capacity and its C-rating. Multiplying the Amp-hour capacity (typically dividing the mAh by 1000) together with the C-rating will give you the battery's current rating. Airsoft guns should have a battery with a current rating of at least 15 for decent performance, and going above 15 will yield minor improvements in ROF and trigger response. Going below 15 amp rated batteries will mean the battery's being redlined during normal use, which is bad for the battery and for performance.  By that formula a 100mAh (0.1Ah) battery would need a C-rating of at least 150C to produce the needed amps, and even then, would drop to unusable power levels in less than 30 seconds.  And again using that formula, just about any 1100mAh battery would be able to power an airsoft gun, provided it had a C-rating of 15C or greater, which is common."
airsoft,3dv2mv,OnwardsMrSnippy,3,Sun Jul 19 20:18:57 2015 UTC,And your answer has nothing to do with the question.  Notice the person who asked said nothing about C-rating.  They are asking about just mAh.  There is nothing about mAh that will need a 1600 vs a 1100 in an airsoft gun.  That was the point I was making in basic terms so it would be easily understood by someone who does not know anything about batteries.
airsoft,3dv2mv,lizanawow,-2,Sun Jul 19 20:32:01 2015 UTC,"mAh is ... not how powerful the battery is  I could run my gun with a 7.4 100 mAh battery   You're saying objectively wrong things to get your point across.   your answer has nothing to do with the question   I taught him how to figure it out for himself. That has a lot to do with the question. Also I answered the question, but maybe you didn't read that far."
airsoft,3dv2mv,OnwardsMrSnippy,3,Sun Jul 19 20:41:55 2015 UTC,But she isn't wrong.. MaH is capacity.
airsoft,3dv2mv,cameroncac,0,Sun Jul 19 21:22:33 2015 UTC,"And capacity is a direct factor in a battery's ability to deliver power. You can't start a car with 12 D-cells and you can't run a gun off of a 100mAh battery. They can't push the power, and that's a direct consequence of their capacity being too low. You can't teach that capacity doesn't matter."
airsoft,3dv2mv,OnwardsMrSnippy,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:45:06 2015 UTC,"Airsoft guns should have a battery with a current rating of at least 15 for decent performance, and going above 15 will yield minor improvements in ROF and trigger response. Going below 15 amp rated batteries will mean the battery's being redlined during normal use, which is bad for the battery and for performance.   not sure how you decided on 15, but everything else seems about right"
airsoft,3dv2mv,Arg0ms,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:43:09 2015 UTC,"Well that's admittedly a personal estimate. Airsoft guns use 20 or 30 amp fuses, so we probably come in somewhere under 30 amps on an average gun. We use 18 gauge wiring and it's rated for 14-16 amps continuous. Since it quickly gets warm to the touch I think we meet or exceed that number. 15 amps seemed like a healthy minimum for what airsoft batteries should achieve. I considered raising it to 20 but I have personally seen 1000mAh 15C batteries run a gun passably, so I figured I'd leave it."
airsoft,3dv2mv,OnwardsMrSnippy,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:26:41 2015 UTC,"mAh is just related to the capacity of the battery. It's just like how much water a fire truck can hold.   Higher mAh = more water = more woosh pew  Your gun probably doesn't require a 1600 mAh battery. It is likely only a recommendation to get a decent amount of shots from the battery.  Anyway, 7.4v lipo 1100mAh will run just fine in your gun that recommends a 8.4v/9.6v 1600 mAh battery.  A typical comparison is a 15-25 C 7.4v lipo is equivalent to a 9.6v Nimh battery in terms of output."

You may need to put new connectors on the gun and/or battery. I'd recommend changing everything to Deans or XT60 anyway."
airsoft,3duejm,snakebitey,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:17:54 2015 UTC,"Like this one ? There arent any shops near me that sells these batteries unfortunately, im also ordering other stuff so it´s actually more convenient for me. That link i posted says 20/40C , what does that mean? Sorry for bothering."
airsoft,3duejm,Pure_Silver,5,Sun Jul 19 16:40:14 2015 UTC,"GunFire is an airsoft shop; you don't want to order the batteries or the electrical accessories from there - they're comically overpriced. Order everything you can from HobbyKing instead. Assuming that the gun is front wired (battery in the handguard), you could look at:   Batteries: Turnigy Nano-Tech 2000mAh 2S (7.4v) 15~25C LiPo - These should fit in the handguard, have a large capacity, and are dirt cheap. Ideally you should order two or three - with 2000mAh, you might well last an entire day on a single battery, but it's best to have a spare in case of problems; it's a shame to waste a $50 game day over a $10 battery. Battery Connectors: Deans Ultra Connectors or XT60 Connectors - like /u/snakebitey says, you should definitely remove the electrical bottleneck that is the gun's horrible stock mini-Tamiya connectors, and replace them with something better. Deans are more common, XT60s are bit easier to separate; both will require you to cut the existing connectors off the gun and batteries and solder the new ones on. Battery Tester & Balancer: Turnigy Deluxe LiPo Battery Tester & Balancer - This will help balance your batteries' individual cells after charging, prolonging their life and improving their performance. More importantly, it will allow you to check the battery's voltage periodically (e.g. at lunch) so you can swap it for a fresh one to ensure it doesn't drop below a safe voltage."

airsoft,3duejm,Branks,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:52:43 2015 UTC,What charger would you recommend for those batteries? I assume the charger should also be able to safely discharge the batteries for storing them?
airsoft,3duejm,Pure_Silver,1 point,Mon Jul 20 09:39:36 2015 UTC,"The usual recommendation for smart chargers (which can charge, discharge etc.) is IMAX's B6AC V2 - make sure you select the closest warehouse HobbyKing has to you to avoid high shipping charges. (Despite what OP thinks, ~€10 is not an excessive sum to charge for fast shipping of LiPo batteries.)  If you're not comfortable with the relatively steep learning curve of the smart chargers (which have to be programmed, although that's not hugely difficult) you can also purchase a dumb charger instead. These charge through the balancing leads, which takes longer, and can't discharge or charge to a storage voltage, but they are much cheaper and simpler. The usual recommendation is Turnigy's E3 2S/3S charger - again, check the warehouse."
airsoft,3duejm,jules_fait_fer,1 point,Mon Jul 20 10:07:08 2015 UTC,Do you have an EU link for that smart charger?
airsoft,3duejm,cameroncac,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:06:38 2015 UTC,"Looks like the newer AC V2 is only in the international warehouse (Hong Kong, I think). The older B6 - recommended for years and still perfectly good - is available from the EU warehouse. There's also a UK warehouse you might want to check out; it depends where you want it shipped to."
airsoft,3duejm,The_Mexx,2,Mon Jul 20 13:35:49 2015 UTC,"C denotes ""capacity"", and that number is how the discharge rate of the battery is measured.  In laymans terms it means how much power (amperage) the battery can safely provide your motor.  15C to 25C is what you want to go for at about 1500-2500mah.  If it says 20/40c it means that it can continuously sustain a 20c discharge but can burst up to 40c discharge for small increments.  more relevant for RC cars or helicopters which encounter different levels of resistance, whereas Airsoft is a spring that is the same resistance every time/much more predictable."

airsoft,3dsmqw,OnwardsMrSnippy,3,Sun Jul 19 01:48:30 2015 UTC,"Think ventilated goggles are expensive, or only available in certain models? That your options are limited? Think again! With a pair of 5V 25mm* fans, a 100- or 50-ohm trim potentiometer, a battery connector and a 4.8V battery, you can ventilate your own goggles. You'll also need strong flexible glue (I choose Shoe Goo), basic soldering equipment and some loose wire.  Glue the fans to your goggles, blowing inward. Route the wires to a glued connector on the side of your goggles. Cludge together a 4.8V battery pack (in this case, half of a 9.6 pack I had laying around) with your potentiometer and remote-line it to your goggles. Get the proper concealment for your kit. In my case I hid the fans with a boonie and the battery inside of a gutted MP5 hi-cap. Most people don't know I have ventilated goggles until they see the hat come off in the staging area.  These goggles have saved my game countless times, on truly awful humid days. Fogging is doubly bad for me because I wear glasses inside the goggles and they try to fog too. Some days the humidity is so bad, when the fans get switched off, my goggles fog up in seconds. These fans keep it all out.  Questions about the specifics? Ask away.  *make sure your goggles' depth profile will fit 25mm fans. if there is not 25mm from the front rim of the goggles to your forehead, then you need to see what fans you may be able to fit, like 20mm"
airsoft,3dsmqw,skyfaller4,3,Sun Jul 19 01:48:36 2015 UTC,From the pictures it looks like the fans would be too big and would hit your forehead and not make the gogles seal correctly. Could you post a picture of you wearing them?
airsoft,3dsmqw,skyfaller4,2,Sun Jul 19 04:30:21 2015 UTC,"Pic. On my goggles these fans have a small 2mm clearance to my forehead. They don't often touch skin and when they do, they don't bother me. I had this figured from the planning stage when I measured my goggles and ordered the fans. You brought up a good point, as 25mm fans may not fit on thinner profile goggles. I'll add that to my OP."

airsoft,3dv2tt,NATOMarksman,0,Sun Jul 19 19:52:20 2015 UTC,"Really? I've heard a few people say that light interferes with the magnifier instead. Can we get some other opinion's here?  Now that I'm thinking about it, I think the reason people don't do this is because the height of the red dot makes it difficult to put a magnifier on the same level. But I dunno."
airsoft,3dv2tt,NATOMarksman,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:25:01 2015 UTC,"The idea behind any magnifying optic is that it gathers light to make an object appear closer than it really is.   Magnifiers are a special kind of optic that has to have more depth of field (so that you can actually distinguish the dot being magnified instead of just seeing a blob of blurry red pixels). Depth of field requires even more light than normal optics.   On top of that, magnifiers are usually compressed compared to full scopes, so you have less surface area to gather light and the smaller lenses transmit less light between each other.   I've never seen a magnifier (or ANY magnifying optic) getting better in low light. It always gets worse; the degree to which it gets worse depends on the light available, the diameter of the objective, the width of the scope body, and the quality of the glass.   That's pretty much the reason why people don't do it, but with an appropriate riser (or some creative engineering), you could do it.   The other problem with magnifiers is that they usually have short eye relief, which doesn't bode well for those using eye protection."

Of course I took some measurements on the original for the fit and I tried to keep the feeling of the original when doing the design (hexagonal shape, venting slots etc.) just so it fit with the overall look of the gun, but otherwise, I didn't use any pre-existing 3D model."

airsoft,3dslaa,zakkwaldo,3,Sun Jul 19 07:14:35 2015 UTC,They are converted from regular BB guns. So they don't have any hop up and probably shoot too hot. Otherwise I haven't heard anything bad about them.

airsoft,3dt5dg,Mrawesome0002,7,Sun Jul 19 05:12:07 2015 UTC,"It's MAP Pricing. Anything that says ""this product is excluded from coupon codes"" has MAP pricing on it, meaning that coupons or any type of discount cannot be used unless stated otherwise."
airsoft,3dt5dg,Aairo,8,Sun Jul 19 05:16:09 2015 UTC,MAP - Minimum Advertised Price. It's because their profit margins are tighter on guns than on lower ticket items. 20% off of a gun almost entirely kills their profit. Whereas they can take a 20% hit on a motor because the retail price is marked up 100% or more.
airsoft,3dt5dg,OnwardsMrSnippy,1 point,Sun Jul 19 05:23:13 2015 UTC,It seems like EVERYTHING is priced like that. At least every gun I've looked at.
airsoft,3dt5dg,NATOMarksman,4,Sun Jul 19 05:22:35 2015 UTC,"When you get to higher quality manufacturers, they want their items to be sold at a certain price to ensure a good profit margin.   I would personally opt for reduced/free shipping cost codes, as those don't affect MAP items at all and it'll still take a chunk off of the total price to you. Now, if you're blowing more than $300 total (likely), this might not mean as much, but it's something.   TL;DR  It means no coupon code will reduce the price on those items, yes. Find another way to save (perhaps on the non-gun items), because you're not going to with those items."

airsoft,3dq3wo,Pisciform,3,Sat Jul 18 11:14:28 2015 UTC,"I originally added them as a bit of personalisation back when I had an AEG L85, but I've since found a handful of bonuses for having them there.   At the moment I use them to hold my hop and NPAS adjustment keys inside the space under the ACOG - I used to use the space in the grip but I left the base plate on a random table somewhere like an idiot... =[   Back on my ICS I had them handy to secure batteries to the outside of the RIS should I ever run out - since the space inside the RIS limited use to TIIIINY batteries. Never actually ended up using them for that, but it was nice to know I could.   In a GBBR you can use them to bodge the nozzle return spring should it ever snap though, so in-field repairs can benefit from it given the right situation.   And lastly, who knows when a rubber band might come in handy? Lol"

Get a better view from the camera when it's on my head rather than the helmet too, keeps it closer to my eyes.  Also, I know the Spectres are used now, but the clone version on the airsoft market isn't the OSx4 it's the DR... So the fact it's wrong is putting me off.   Though my ACOG is actually slightly wrong as well, so I shouldn't really pick hairs. I may well pick one up, because they're much nicer than the ACOG clones."

airsoft,3dt1yr,SutroBaths,5,Sun Jul 19 04:31:42 2015 UTC,"Silver is about 9% more conductive than copper, which makes it a nice substitute in high efficiency and high current applications. However, the silver plating on silver plated copper wire is something else. It makes up a very small fraction of the wire's cross section. In the grand scheme of things it will lower the wire's resistance by a very negligible amount, probably by much less than 1%. Silver plating is really a thing because silver is a little more corrosion resistant than copper, which is useful in precision applications that use screw down terminals, like audio. Even in that use, the average homeowner doesn't need it.  Anyway any 16 gauge copper wire is fine."
airsoft,3dt1yr,OnwardsMrSnippy,1 point,Sun Jul 19 05:02:42 2015 UTC,"The silver is there to stop the copper reacting with the insulation (thus why it's a plating rather than alloyed with the copper). Quite typical for teflon insulation, I assume it's used for other types though."

The sight protector is probably your best bet as you can put it really close to the sight but you may need a special drill in addition to a dremel.  Also note that Lexan will eventually develop a yellowish hue due to UV exposure and can get scratched more easily than plexiglass can, so you may need to replace the screen every now and then."

Check that there's a screw in the back of the upper gearbox (slide it out of the upper receiver) and if there is you're all set and it can be used as it is.  Just a bit ghetto is all.    Assuming the rest of the components are there (hop up, inner barrel, etc) just reassemble it and you should be fine to shoot some BBs."

It will have to be an ICS one, and it may be that it will also have to be a sportsline ICS one and not a regular one - I'm not an ICS owner and don't know if there are differences.

I say this because of proprietary parts in the design; if something goes wrong with a crucial part, you could have a hard time replacing it or even be stuck entirely, due to lack of aftermarket/OEM support for that model.  You don't have to stay away from proprietary things entirely, but be aware of what parts selection and support is available before you choose such a system."

The gu performed flawlessly, he was a beast on the battlefield. UNTIL... One game he heard a whinning noise. Ever so faint that picked up, and evantually his gun quit shooting. All it made was a high pitched whnning noise. Later we found that it was the motor not connecting to the gearbox. The gun has now been on a workbench for at least a month, and not for lake of trying.

airsoft,3dnxlh,EchelonAgent,6,Fri Jul 17 20:41:08 2015 UTC,"$108 for the gun, five bucks for the firing pin parts, another ten for the hammer torsion springs, and a bunch of drilling, sanding, filing, and fitting to get the whole thing to work right. I'd guess not a lot of people have done this conversion because it was a hell of a lot of work- way easier to just get a Hwa San sawnoff and back out two grub screws, which is all it takes to convert it to use Goblins. I built this mostly because that Hwa San vanished into the woods on its first outing and I didn't much feel like getting another of the same thing, but still wanted something to use the ten remaining shells."
airsoft,3dnxlh,ConvertsToMetric,2,Fri Jul 17 20:46:05 2015 UTC,How did the sawn off converted to goblin shells preform? More or less the same as your coach gun?
airsoft,3dnxlh,CobaltRose800,6,Fri Jul 17 21:58:23 2015 UTC,"Differently, actually, owing to the difference in barrel length. With the paintball shells, using a homemade paper shot cup and a cardboard overshot card, the coach gun has a somewhat tighter spread than the sawnoff, and slightly higher muzzle velocity. With the airsoft shells, the difference is significant- the sawnoff produces a thirty-degree cone of BBs flying wildly with a maximum effective range of about thirty feet, while the coach gun has a spread somewhat wider than with the paintball shells but still manageable.  Basically, with the sawnoff, the paintball shells give you a spread good for 50-100ft, and the airsoft shells give you a cloud of aiming-doesn't-matter random death out to 50ft. Which are both useful, for different purposes. The coach gun does the same thing, but with a tighter spread in both applications. For all purposes CO2 is pretty much required, the muzzle velocity on green gas is simply pathetic."

AFAIK, that is a DBoys-OEM'd SCAR-H; it's not one of the better SCARs out there, and most of the SCARs out there suck real bad. Alright, it's not as bad as the CA Sportslines, but it's still a pretty nasty gun, with a proprietary hop-up unit and fragile metals and plastics, especially in the stock and stock hinge.  Anyway, if you choose to entirely disregard that advice, the answer is it depends entirely on the LiPo and the PEQ box. Why you would want to change a rear-wired gun (battery conveniently hidden in the stock) to front-wired (battery has to go into a PEQ box that's ugly and takes up space, probably with exposed wiring into the bargain) I have no idea, but just how bad an idea it is depends on the voltage and capacity of the LiPo."

airsoft,3drle1,Ruschnav,2,Sat Jul 18 21:21:36 2015 UTC,If I were you I would take it apart and perfect your compression. That should boost your FPS a little bit if you had a small leak. Also going from a 6.05 to a 6.01 or 6.02 will also increase your FPS a tad. Combining both of these alongside a SHS M100 should boost you to around 350 to 360. If you are above then you should clip a coil off your spring. Also are you sure your chrono is correct?

The BARS ones are very cheap but that's the only positive thing I've heard about them, they've available for around $70 a suit. The SPLAV versions cost closer to $120-$140."

Their VK page and forums are full of people with horror stories of waiting for months for a paid order to ship to them, people ignoring their emails, nobody picking up the phone when they call, etc. I went through the exact same shit when I was trying to order SSO shit for some people on this subReddit, and ended up refunding most of it because I literally COULD NOT GET THEM TO TAKE MY MONEY.  As it stands, I will take SPLAV over SSO any day of the week because at least there I can walk into a store and actually try on anything I want to buy, and when I call them, they pick up the phone.

airsoft,3dn77l,MaceRider,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:03:20 2015 UTC,"In my experience, with pouches for instance, a pouch can be something like $5 USD on the SSO site, but in my local Airsoft store, it may be $8 or even $10. The same pricing tendencies are observable when you take something large like a backpack or a SMERSH rig as well. And this is all in Russia, so officially product X is 5000 rubles, but in the local store it's 6000, and you either pay that, or try to order direct from SSO Moscow and they ignore your calls and emails for months until you finally get your package. Or you don't. Who knows?  As for me and the way I operate... well, the thing is, most of the users on this forum cannot direct purchase anything from Russian companies, because they typically do not ship out of the country and are not able to handle orders in English with payment via Paypal. As such, middlemen like me are their only option.  I do not and cannot offer ""better"" prices than buying direct, because I myself am buying everything with minimal discounts (I have a SPLAV discount card, but it's like 5% most of the time) or at regular list price, so the person ends up paying slightly more than the list price at the store. I am not a charity and do not hide the fact that I am taking time out of my day to go to the store and do all the logistical work, and for that I charge a percentage for myself when taking an order.  That being said, the prices people pay when ordering through me are smaller than you typically used to see on eBay and whatnot, where people were routinely marking up 100%+ simply because nobody else was around to regulate the market."

airsoft,3dn77l,Iamthebacon,1 point,Sat Jul 18 00:03:19 2015 UTC,"What do you usually do for regular uniforms? I've been trying to decide whether to tuck mine in or not, since I've seen Ukraine pictures and most of them have it un-tucked. I'm sure there's some official Soviet guideline or something right?"
airsoft,3dn77l,ColonelCubbage,3,Sat Jul 18 00:31:15 2015 UTC,"Well, considering the Soviet Union hasn't existed for 25 years now, I dare say their guidelines are a little bit out of date. That being said, the general doctrine is thus - if it has pockets, it's worn outside the waistband. This goes for Gorka parkas (which were not a part of the official uniform) as well as regular field jackets. The VDV had special jackets without lower pockets they wore tucked into the waist because they jumped out of planes and didn't want air to flap their coattails around and shit - hence the tucking. They were allowed to do this.   Because soldiers are still people and people oftentimes want to appear cooler than they are, there was a period of time when regular infantry started to cut pockets off their regular field jackets and tuck those in as well, to look like VDV and seem cooler by association. This was not officially sanctioned, but in Afghanistan, nobody was going to fuck around with you for wearing your coat wrong when you were constantly getting shot at by Muja snipers and RPGs. They had better things to worry about.  I tend to believe that nowadays the regulations are similar. Shirts are tucked in because they don't have pockets below the waist. Jackets are not because they do. That's pretty much as complicated as it gets.  I personally do not wear regular uniforms with field jackets and whatnot. In most cases, I wear t-shirts or combat shirts, both I typically wear tucked in as otherwise it's just not very comfortable. Otherwise I will be in a Gorka or a civilian-style softshell or fleece."

airsoft,3dnef7,needanacc0unt,2,Fri Jul 17 19:12:02 2015 UTC,Yeah so originally the converter uses a high cap and you leave the door open. Then you pour the bbs in and wind the high cap. What I did is remove the safety tab that keeps the door open this is so it can take mid caps. It still takes both though and fully functions!
airsoft,3dnef7,needanacc0unt,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:35:24 2015 UTC,So the high cap lip is connected to where the original mag would be connected? and then the rest of it just acts as a reserve and feeds into the highcap through the open door and winding?

airsoft,3dqx8u,_So_Others_May_Live_,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:08:13 2015 UTC,"the nub is tricky to do on your own but can yield excellent results when done well.  what tools are you using?  what's your process for making it fit?  most stock flat nubs don't fit every hop arm.  so be prepared to have some of them just not work for shit, like you've seen happen already.  I personally like to use a fine grit 1/4"" dremel abrasive cylinder bit to sand my eraser nubs down to be slightly convex.  However, I don't use erasers for flat hops, as I feel they're too soft, and better for rhops.  I've noticed that the little + shaped spacers that are used for laying tile work very well for flat hopping as they're both already flat and a little harder which seems to work better."

Famas is a pain because of the way its assembled. you need to run wire through a specific channel in the chassis, which limits your ability to increase the gauge. in addition, it requires a v7 (m14) spur gear, and uses both spur and sector gear to determine ratio, making upgrades expensive (m14 13:1 gears cost more than the gun is worth)   do yourself a favor and seriously just read this"

The CA SCAR-H has a V2.5 gearbox like the SR25, so the nozzle might be a tiny bit shorter than necessary for your build, and consequentially might be causing an airleak.  As far as I know, you can shave part of the tappet to allow the nozzle to move forward more and press into the bucking lips more firmly, but I do not remember exactly which part of the tappet it is.

airsoft,3doiib,Dutchbet,1 point,Sat Jul 18 00:22:04 2015 UTC,"LCT great internals? IIRC E&L soundly beats it. Externally it might beat E&L, but it's close enough to be a matter of opinion."

airsoft,3doiib,Dutchbet,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:22:40 2015 UTC,"I'm not convinced by that, really. There are tons of others that preference E&L internals, even some mods. But let's say the two are about even. LCT is significantly more expensive."
airsoft,3doiib,izwald88,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:39:40 2015 UTC,Lets leave it at that they are both good brands for an AK the only better brands i could think of would be VFC. Wich are pretty much in a unicorn state. Never seen one for sale anymore in europe and the Realsword AK's
airsoft,3doiib,Dutchbet,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:01:36 2015 UTC,"Indeed. If some would be happy with an LCT then they would likely be happy with an E&L, and vise versa. My point was, do you want to pay more for something that, at best, is on par with a similar, cheaper, item?"
airsoft,3doiib,izwald88,2,Sat Jul 18 19:10:25 2015 UTC,"If you can afford it, E&L will give you the best AK for your money outside of a Real Sword, if you're into Chinese guns (though it's a copy of the AK47 there and not a 74).  LCT is even more expensive and not really worth the extra money IMHO.  Cyma/DBoys/Kalash is a fine option if you don't want to plunk down the money for an E&L."

airsoft,3dm3h2,PowerfulPotatoPunch,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:26:19 2015 UTC,"I don't know about the MTC, but the SL9's stock is pretty light so most of the weight is in the barrel assembly so a long barrel may make it fairly front heavy."
airsoft,3dm3h2,The_Rathour,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:38:19 2015 UTC,From what I read it's already very front heavy as the lower receiver and stock are both polymer where the front handguard/RIS setup are fully metal. I have some extra metal weights laying around if I need to balance it a bit more I can just through them in the back of the stock with the battery as that compartment looks very roomy. I actually held an SL9 today at a local store and that thing is pretty light and balanced even with that huge mock suppressor.
airsoft,3dm3h2,KillermooseD,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:51:47 2015 UTC,"Well, on the SL9 the suppressor is hollow so it'll stay somewhat light. For the size it's definitely light, which is nice."

airsoft,3dmdl0,Senchoo87,2,Fri Jul 17 17:41:56 2015 UTC,If you are in the field of Gen 1 or 1+ make sure to have money for a good IR torch. Those Gen's of NVG are not that super good on their own. And if you have one without an IR-torch you will only be able to see outlines.  The Gen 1+ is a little better but the technique for the manufacturing hasn't changed since the Starlight. Gen 1+ is good if in a weapons sight cascaded.  For monocular i'd say look after a Gen 2 at least.  To get the pricing down search for people who have NVG's specifically as hobby. They can get the PVS-14 case and a tube for lower price and fully legal.  I have a couple of years gone from a Pulsar 1x20 Gen 1+ to my PVS-7 Gen 3. And i can't stress it enough. If you want it headmounted go Gen 2 at least.

airsoft,3dms80,pyotr_the_great,2,Fri Jul 17 15:46:25 2015 UTC,I though that indicators were made to be used during gameplay. Also does your indicator have lights on it to show how much battery you have?
airsoft,3dms80,OGPancakewasd,3,Fri Jul 17 15:50:27 2015 UTC,"Nah, they are supposed to be used to check your battery's voltage level at some point so that you don't start yourself on fire or something. And yes, it has a simple digital display like a clock"
airsoft,3dms80,pyotr_the_great,2,Fri Jul 17 16:09:59 2015 UTC,Why would you not use it during game play? How are you supposed to know when to stop using the battery? Are you just draining it completely o_O?
airsoft,3dms80,pyotr_the_great,4,Fri Jul 17 16:29:58 2015 UTC,"Because if you check it and it's at like 12.3 for an 11.1, you don't want it beeping constantly if you're sneaking and unless your gun is extremely inefficient you wont need the checker around. And I check the battery after every round, stopping once is gets to like ~10.9. If that doesn't happen first I stop using the gun when it starts to slow down."
airsoft,3dms80,Pure_Silver,2,Fri Jul 17 16:46:46 2015 UTC,Ah okay. That makes more sense. Actually makes a lot more sense. I was planning on keeping it in the gun. I'll just follow your advice and check during downtime.   Thanks :c
airsoft,3dms80,Luissen,2,Fri Jul 17 19:35:09 2015 UTC,"RC hobbyists use voltage alarm indicators to tell them when the battery has reached a certain voltage. From this voltage, people estimate how much energy the battery has left.  A conservative voltage is around 3.5v to maximize battery longevity. At 3.5v around 80% of the capacity of the battery has been discharged.  Are you balancing your cells? Perhaps one of your cells is under the voltage threshold? Does your voltage checker indicate the voltage in each cell?"
airsoft,3dms80,omgalbert3,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:28:39 2015 UTC,"Not gonna lie, I would definitely have thought the same, and I'm surprised that it's doing that. I have a standalone battery balancer and tester that's clearly not supposed to be connected during play, but that little thing looks like it omits a bunch of features to keep it small enough to stuff into the gun, and it'll beep eventually to let you know to change the battery out.  Does it beep even when you aren't shooting it? If not, it may be that it's being confused by the voltage in the pack dropping temporarily when you shoot the gun, in which case your gun may be drawing more than the battery should supply?"

airsoft,3dlwyk,Iamthebacon,5,Fri Jul 17 09:42:30 2015 UTC,"Accuracy isn't going to be affected by the longer barrel so much as FPS - it being a gas gun, it will be shooting hotter the longer barrel is installed. That being said, make sure you don't overdo it with the barrel length.   I'm sure that if you do the requisite air-seal mods and install a good hop-up bucking and all the standard accuracy mods, it will be as accurate as any other GBB SMG. You will probably have to HPA tap the mags in order to get perfect consistency and accuracy, but I think even in stock trim it will be usable."
airsoft,3dlwyk,MaceRider,2,Fri Jul 17 10:41:19 2015 UTC,"So, I own a stock KWA mp7. I'm not sure how similar they are but I Have found it to be very accurate with the default barrel and shooting at 400 FPS with .2's, so pretty perfect for field use. I actually tried using an extended inner barrel suppressor and it chrono'd at over 500 FPS, so I had to remove it. I would be careful extending the inner barrel so you don't push the FPS too high."

Its robust and takes a beating! The material it's made from is sturdy and tactile. Mine is the 'K' version with the longer barrel and foldable stock. The stock isn't flimsy at all. There's no play in the pivots point. I haven't upgraded anything as I haven't needed to. Apart from the silencer and foregrip it's completely stock OOTB and I love it!

It is possible that it is a Taiwanese version of the KSC M11, since there are some Taiwanese made KSC M93R's floating around. Does it have any other markings on it? Some KSC M11's also had a block of text near the ejection port. The only other possibilities are the Maruzen, HFC, and WA M11's, but the WA and Maruzen M11's are both Japanese made, and the HFC never had any markings on it at all. At this point I'm pretty damn sure it's a Taiwanese made KSC M11."

airsoft,3dl1oc,Noppta,1 point,Fri Jul 17 12:43:08 2015 UTC,I use 2000mah 11.1 lipos in the Krytac and I can just barely get a 1000mah 11.1 to fit in the Scorpion. I need to get a battery box to mount on the Scorpion so I can use the bigger lipos in it.   Sorry I can't do a video for you I live in a city and only get to shoot my guns on the field.
airsoft,3dl1oc,actionsportgames_bob,1 point,Fri Jul 17 12:49:38 2015 UTC,"I'm not entirely sure what your question is by ""battery accuracy"", but I can tell you that the stock SPR is pretty damn good in terms of range, accuracy, and RoF.  That being said, the barrel length is a bit longer than the EVO, so it could be a bit difficult for CQB.  Back to the SPR though, it comes with a MOSFET built in, so you can run an 11.1v LiPo no problem as long as you take care of your gun.  If you want to make the SPR slightly better than it already is, I would suggest installing a TBB and a new bucking (I use a 6.03mm TBB and a Maple Leaf 70 degree bucking and I can really reach out and touch people)."

airsoft,3dkzqe,Ayylmao1106,2,Fri Jul 17 19:40:08 2015 UTC,"I can't really understand what's supposed to be so special about the Maruzen; it's a bolt-action springer and fundamentally they're all pretty similar - what makes them special is their aftermarket and knowledge base. That's why serious snipers almost exclusively use VSR-platform rifles - that's what all the parts are made for, that's where all the development's done, all the guides are written for it, all that good stuff.  If you don't want a VSR in any of its myriad forms - and I have to say I think a PDI'd VSR in a ModelWork stock is a sexy thing to behold - then I'd still recommend the TM over the Maruzen."

airsoft,3dleph,taj1994,2,Fri Jul 17 09:03:46 2015 UTC,"If they require 366 FPS with .25s, then you'll be fine. 400 with .2s isn't even 360 with .25s (356.9 to be exact). You would need to be shooting above 408 with .2s to go over the limit   On the other hand, if they require 366 with .2s, then don't even try it. Without taking joule creep into account, all weights of BBs hit with the same energy when fired from the same gun, meaning you're going above what they set as a safe limit for their site, and would also be considered cheating and possibly risking a ban"

airsoft,3di7sx,ObsidianOne,3,Thu Jul 16 14:03:34 2015 UTC,I'm no tek but you might want to open the gearbox and make sure the grease that was in there still is. Make sure nothing on it is dry rotted away. Clean the barrel. Check the hop up. Then check your wiring and make sure it's all still in good shape before event plugging a battery in.

airsoft,3di7sx,srg99,2,Thu Jul 16 19:20:23 2015 UTC,"Ammo - 6mm, between .2 and .3 grams. I would recommend .25 or .28g  Batteries - check the connector type and where the battery fits. This will determine the size and connector type you need. Most guns use 8.4 or 9.6v batteries stock, which can be replaced by a 7.4v LiPo battery if you want to get those.  Nothing you need to do aside from swabbing the barrel out. You may need to replace the hop-up rubber as it's probably dried out and cracked and will not work properly."

airsoft,3di1hq,RIICKY,6,Thu Jul 16 14:53:22 2015 UTC,"I saw a video on YouTube of some ""milsim"" game that featured that.  Supposedly, from someone's comment, game staff would yell something like ""Gas, gas!"" and everyone had to stop shooting, take off their masks/goggles, and then put on gas masks, and then continue...  I commented on the video asking why some people were explicitly taking off their eye protection in the middle of the field.  I didn't really agree with it, what if someone was still shooting at people who were starting to take off their goggles to put on their gas masks?  Found it, right around the 1:13 mark: https://youtu.be/mIKUuTxhYmY?t=1m13s  Not even sure if the guy's gas mask has ballistic-rated lenses installed in it.  Okay, I posted that comment 4 years ago under a different YouTube account and someone replied:   @albertomg - All our players that use gas masks have had a pro replace the lenses with 4-6mm lexan.  They are stronger than your typical goggles.  Anytime a gas attack is called, a ceasefire takes place first to allow players to don chem gear.   I personally would not be comfortable in trusting every player not to hear & acknowledge the call for ceasefire and refrain from shooting during the entire time.  It would probably take a long time for staff to confirm every single person has safely taken off their eye protection and swapped on gas masks before resuming fire, among other possible airsoft devices, that can cause damage."

airsoft,3di1hq,MaceRider,5,Thu Jul 16 15:11:52 2015 UTC,You're not understanding my original point. You can make it as clear as you want that the quad is not part of the game. Human nature and the kids that this sport attracts will find some excuse to shoot at it.  This is why I disagree with your second point. No one is downvoting you dude. I wouldn't downvote over something so trivial.
airsoft,3di1hq,mclarenf1boi,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:30:46 2015 UTC,"Mmmm, I think that if people were told ahead of time that there would be a drone filming them and that it shouldn't be shot at, it wouldn't get shot at. Most people are not deliberately malicious.  And if they are, then they're on camera. Figure out who it was based on the footage and then kick the shit out of them or permanently ban them or send their parents a bill.  Lots of solutions to the potential problem."
airsoft,3di1hq,MaceRider,2,Thu Jul 16 15:33:09 2015 UTC,"Most people are not deliberately malicious   Exactly this, but the few minority are/can be malicious and won't listen to reason.   Ideally, even if your camera was pointing in the direction of the perp who was shooting at you, theres a lot of if's at play. If the camera was recording, if it was pointed at the right direction, if it the footage was sufficiently clear to see who shot at it, etc.    The point of this post was if quads were used more often in airsoft games. My point is that they're not because of the danger of irresponsible players.   I'm not trying to argue with you Mace, I'm just stating my opinion on the matter."

airsoft,3di1hq,daboardman,2,Thu Jul 16 19:24:44 2015 UTC,This is true. That would make for one hell of a video. The problem is that most of us have played too much call of duty and expect it as a combat drone. I'm sure it would be ok if the refs announce that it's the field's drone so it doesn't get shot down.

airsoft,3di1hq,daboardman,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:15:46 2015 UTC,"That's why it shouldn't be weaponised. A friend of mine uses one for recon at our local field. Nobody shoots at it, which is good because it costs about $300. It's not fair if this thing flys in and kills you. Granted, I'm not gonna shoot it. I collect rc helicopters and I know how expensive it can get, but at the same time, I really wouldn't blame someone for shooting down a weaponised drone. Long story short, want people not to break your drone? Use it for recon and not a deathbot."
airsoft,3di1hq,mclarenf1boi,2,Thu Jul 16 18:41:49 2015 UTC,"Even if a quad could be weaponzied and you figured out the live feeding, mounting an AEG, I feel that any person on the ground could easily shoot it out of the sky. A person on the ground has the benefit of cover and quads can't stay in the air for prolonged periods of time either.   I don't own any rc helicopters but I do have nitro RC cars and those are quite expensive as well."
airsoft,3di1hq,daboardman,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:19:09 2015 UTC,"You are very right. Anything that flies with a rotary wing is quite literally a balancing act. The seccond that a bb strike tips the craft, it's going to veer hard to one direction and if tipped too much, fall out of the sky. If the pilot on the ground is fast enough, he may correct it, but any damage from bb strike will throw off the balance of the vehicle. If you don't punch the gas when a chopper starts falling, it will fall faster than the amount of lift the blades can create, and if you didn't react in time, you can't recover. This is from experience flying many different size and weight choppers. They dont fall softly either. Frankly, the seccond someone lands a hit or two on it it's going down hard."
airsoft,3di1hq,mclarenf1boi,2,Thu Jul 16 20:42:01 2015 UTC,"Thanks for sharing your rc helicopter experience, I did not know any of those things.   One thing that I did consider was that I assume most quads have frames/components made of plastic to save on weight? I can't imagine how those stand up with BB hits.   I think the biggest reason we haven't seen more quad usage is just there is too much inherit risk involved in using it that outweighs the benefits of footage."
airsoft,3di1hq,daboardman,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:47:12 2015 UTC,"Yeah, they are like plastic and foam to as light as possible. And yeah you hit the nail on the head. They video may be awesome, but at about 300 for a good quad, I wouldn't risk it."

The fact that this is a 1911 (and that it was bought from a supermarket) makes it even more likely it's not a 1911, no matter what they call it, so disregard my advice.  WE don't sell under other brand names much AFAIK.  KWC do have a good parts support website, but for the cost of shipping you might as well buy a new magazine."
airsoft,3dkuhw,omgalbert3,2,Fri Jul 17 16:44:59 2015 UTC,"If you look at the magazine in the picture, it looks just like the optional WE CO2 Hi-capa magazines that aren't as common, has the same baseplate with slot for the CO2 screw-in plate and everything.  I don't think the Black Ops 1911 is CO2-only, but they're only bundled with CO2 magazines.

I thought this was the former but it isn't - I think you're right and it's a Chinese clone of the WE P14. I get the impression that the WE is part Hi-Capa (unlike the WA P14 and its KJW clone) so Hi-Capa feed lips may fit.

Usually though when you sign a liability waiver at an airsoft facility that also frees them to use your image in promotion.

airsoft,3de90d,phyrephawckce,4,Wed Jul 15 16:56:06 2015 UTC,Just take the stl file to a local shop.  Might cost you around $50 instead of hundreds or thousands.  No use buying a printer unless you find a way to make money off of it.  I haven't even touched mine in months.

airsoft,3de90d,TheSkoomaCat,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:02:49 2015 UTC,Meanwhile a desktop printer costs about that much. But those are really high res.

airsoft,3de90d,phyrephawckce,2,Wed Jul 15 17:44:16 2015 UTC,Why don't you build yourself one?  You can 3D print a lot of the parts with the one you'll have access to and the rest are easy enough to acquire for reasonable prices.  It takes a several hundred dollar machine down to only a couple hundred or lower easy.  I think you can even do sub-one hundred if you play your cards right.

I'm also a huge fan of this gun in general. A few awesome features are rotsting trigger guard for gloves, collaspable stock, locking slide with release. I'm looking into buying a flip to side magnifier and a bipod to finish up the look I'm going for. Let me know what ya think/ suggestions for accessories.

airsoft,3disaj,CustomerServiceDesk,6,Thu Jul 16 16:40:16 2015 UTC,"Any HPA system is more than able to work with your proposed barrel length. However, your wording is strange. An integrated suppressor is one that is built into the outer barrel. If you have the standard outer barrel, then it can't be integrated, it will just be a suppressor attached to the end of the barrel.  That being said - you do not have to use a barrel that long, and instead have the suppressor attached purely for cosmetic purposes. If you stuff it with foam, you can even quiet your gun down AS LONG AS YOU ARE OK WITH TAKING RESPONSIBILITY FOR YOUR ACTIONS AND ACCEPT THAT THIS MAY BE ILLEGAL IN THE US.  I think in terms of bang-for-buck, currently the SMP is probably going to be the cheapest proven option. The Jack and Hydra are new and I think you should treat all brand new products with a grain of salt - early adoption is usually costly as well as relatively more problematic.  Barrel diameter - two schools of thought on this. If you want to, you can go for an extra-wide barrel, which is popular with HPA guns. Or you can go for a tight-bore like on a standard AEG."
airsoft,3disaj,MaceRider,2,Thu Jul 16 16:48:39 2015 UTC,"Sorry about the wording, the suppressor is a part of the outer barrel. I've been told that if you remove the suppressor there's threads under it, but it would be a long process of heating and using wrenches to get it off.   I will under no circumstances be filling the suppressor with foam, I don't know my state laws (MA), but in going to guess that it would be frowned upon.   What would the pros and cons be of wide vs tight bore barrel? If there's no real difference there's a perfect length Prometheus barrel available."
airsoft,3disaj,MaceRider,2,Thu Jul 16 17:17:22 2015 UTC,"Wide-bore barrels supposedly give the BB a cushion of air to float down the length of the barrel on, whereas tightbores lead to more contact between the BB and the barrel. Please do some reading on the relative merits of each yourself, as I have no personal experience with widebores and do not want to act like I am knowledgeable on the subject. I think there are plenty of forum posts on the issue."

airsoft,3disaj,omgalbert3,2,Thu Jul 16 17:33:42 2015 UTC,"I know it's the most expensive but I'm pretty partial to the Fusion Engine for a few reasons. First is the ability to swap in New nozzles and poppet valves. Although you can adjust your fps with your regulator regardless of what HPA system you get, the FE allows you to raise or lower the maximum fps at 120 psi. Furthermore, I love the FCU. As a disclaimer, I know next to nothing about any of the other options you listed. However, I think I'm correct in saying the FE is the only one of the bunch that had such a dynamic on board computer. You can use it to adjust the rate of fire, trigger response time, enable 1-9 round burst, full auto only, semi only, and I'm only touching the surface. If I'm wrong in assuming the other options can't do all of that, then by all means go the cheaper option. But as someone else mentioned, hopping onto a brand new product line that hasn't had all the kinks worked out could be a headache. Also any HPA system will be able to supply more than enough air to your barrel.   Edit: See other answers for determining barrel diameter."
airsoft,3disaj,apoctank,2,Thu Jul 16 23:51:35 2015 UTC,"I'm leaning towards SMP because it's cheaper than a Fusion Engine and not exactly new.

airsoft,3disaj,apoctank,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:47:31 2015 UTC,"DGs (and really all Escort-based systems), being recoil-operated, are a whole different story.  In a DG you want a wider bore because of how the bolt/nozzle/airshaft works (you want wider tolerances to avoid jamming and breakage).    More conventional HPA systems can afford to have tighter tolerances as there are far fewer moving parts and are as such much more forgiving.  Now that I've said that, if OP does everything else right, a Promy 6.05 has the capability to help in creating a true monster."

airsoft,3disaj,Johnag1291989,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:26:32 2015 UTC,Wider tolerance =/= less accuracy.

I have a generic no-name charger that I got from my local RC store, seems to work OK.  For safety's sake, get a LiPo bag as well or do your charging in a safe and fire-resistant area if you can, like in a garage or out on your porch/deck/etc. It's highly unlikely you will have a catastrophic battery failure while charging, but it's better to be safe than sorry. I charge my batteries out on my concrete balcony, so even if the battery does flare up, it won't burn anything, at most it will leave some scorch marks on the concrete."

I had this issue when I wasn't shooting high enough quality BBs, so I switched it up to the KWA perfects and never looked back. You also need to allow a 'break in' period for the magazines, and make sure they're regularly cleaned. The only two types of BBs that I've found to shoot well are the KWAs and the elite force, the rest cause feeding issues.

airsoft,3dhfbm,Djeheuty,3,Thu Jul 16 18:56:20 2015 UTC,A V3 is one of the easier guns to install a MOSFET in because the wiring is external.  The best base gun to start with is a JG.

airsoft,3dh4t9,Sneekygreenman,2,Thu Jul 16 11:47:34 2015 UTC,"Agreed, start by binning the WE and buying a TM. You will be looking to spend quite serious money to turn a Hi-Capa into a competitive primary, and it would be stupid to dump large amounts of money into such a crap gun.  With a TM 5.1 Hi-Capa in hand, first grab 2-4 spare magazines - ProWin make very nice ones, but there's nothing wrong the with TM originals - and some Nine Ball gas routers for them. You may also want LPE router shims.  Then, consider how you want the gun to perform and appear. You might want to consider a long inner barrel to boost muzzle energy, and covering it with a compensator or suppressor. If so, look at non-tilting barrels - you don't want to upset the slide's cycling. You might want a mounted sight for fast target acquisition at range; look at open-class race guns for inspiration. You might want a hybrid slide or short-stroked gun for faster cycling - look at ProG4's .22 split-slide kit.  Basically anything you want is possible on the Hi-Capa platform, but you definitely want a TM base, not a WE one."

airsoft,3dh4t9,ConorN93,2,Thu Jul 16 13:16:20 2015 UTC,"Usually there parts are slightly off spec, plus there quality control isn't that good so there's a good chance of getting a dud."
airsoft,3dh4t9,Pure_Silver,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:10:17 2015 UTC,"The WE 1911 and 2011 replicas have a truly terrible reputation for shoddy construction, loose tolerances, and nasty materials. If you want a performance gun, you really want the opposite of all of those - and in particular, you want to avoid the heavy, dense and yet fragile pot-metal slide and outer barrel of the WE, because they cripple the gun's gas efficiency, which means slower cycling and thus fewer, less consistent shots per magazine. Less consistency means lesser accuracy, too.  Honestly, even if you already have a WE Hi-Capa in hand you would likely be better off keeping it as it is than sinking a ton of money into it, trying to make it as good as a stock TM. You can definitely start with purchasing the magazines, though - those should work with the WE just like they do with the TM.  If you don't have the WE in hand, definitely get the TM. You don't need to feel guilty about modifying something great to make it even greater."

You mean it fires 2 bb's on one trigger pull? Or pulling the trigger once makes the gun overcycle twice?   If its the first issue, I'd take a look at how you got your hop-up on your inner. Make sure the grooves line up and you don't meet too much resistance when pushing it into the hop-up."

airsoft,3dfgrd,Kozio_,2,Thu Jul 16 14:40:43 2015 UTC,"We envisioned it as kind of a rifle equivalent of our current gen Dan Wesson revolvers, meant more for casual airsoft enthusiasts (not necessarily those who play) to plink with, so we cut down on features that would add complexity and cost.

On our official ones with the McMillan licensing, we specifically requested a steel pinned cylinder that can stand up to higher springs.  During our testing and evaluation of the M40A3, the aluminum cylinder was the number one thing on our list of changes."
airsoft,3dfgrd,cameroncac,8,Thu Jul 16 00:00:25 2015 UTC,"Which store did you get it from? Our models all have steel cylinders, so this is the first time I'm hearing about this issue."
airsoft,3dfgrd,AMGTD,5,Thu Jul 16 01:27:03 2015 UTC,"I'm not insulting you nor am I lying to you. I'm trying to get to the bottom of this issue you are having and I would appreciate it if you can keep it civil.   We've sold hundreds of M40A3s in the US, and beyond a select few specimens that had a piston issue we haven't heard any other negative feedback from customers. That is why I am genuinely surprised to hear about this problem, since I personally have spot-tested guns out of each shipment and have not encountered this wobbling issue.  When I get back to work tomorrow, I'm going to take a look at our M40A3 inventory and do more testing. If you still have the stock cylinder, you can send me pictures of it to BL-US@actionsportgames.com and I can use it as reference against what we have in stock."
airsoft,3dfgrd,cameroncac,6,Thu Jul 16 01:43:14 2015 UTC,"For the cylinder material I'm certain it comes down to where it was bought from. In that thread you linked, the most recent post from ThatIsWhat says he got a steel cylinder out of the box, which is what ours comes with.   We found that the piston issue was caused by some trigger units missing a shim on earlier models. It made the sear sit too low, so instead of catching the piston completely it'd only grab it halfway, resulting in that wear pattern."
airsoft,3dfgrd,AMGTD,5,Thu Jul 16 01:53:39 2015 UTC,"Are we discussing whether or not the cylinder is steel, or that he and you are having issues with the pins? I'm not arguing with you over the pins, if your bolt handle wobbles then it wobbles, that's pretty black and white, which is why I'm going to look into it. I thought you were saying the cylinder isn't steel."

airsoft,3df4f3,broken42,3,Wed Jul 15 20:16:01 2015 UTC,"Less of intimidating, more of a cheesy way for recognition. If you're playing with a team of 200 and you call out Jake(my name) chances are there's gonna be other people with the same name. There's many duplicate names such as Nick and Tony within our own team. If you call out a cheesy call sign it's easier to know who they're talking to. Plus it's easier to remember people you may have met on the field, but not know in person. As for team names, it's to create a means of recognition as well. We have a ShadowRegimeAirsoft YouTube channel where we like to post our game plays. If you know that name you'll know it's our stuff. As for the specific names? Just as you said it, cheesy things people make up. WarHawks are historically people in politics that favor war or escalating conflicts. It is also simply some of my profile names on gaming outlets."

Use external audio, the GoPro needs to be in a protective case and making compromises to that case for the sake of audio (which will be distorted from air moving around/through the case anyway) won't help.   To make your videos interesting, make two kinds of the same outing: compilations of interesting/funny moments lasting no longer than 15-20 seconds each with total time less than six minutes (generally closer to three), and full length video of everything.   Color correct your videos, but only to sharpen details to the audience that might've been lost with natural color."

airsoft,3dh20l,sokolske,6,Thu Jul 16 17:05:17 2015 UTC,"You need at least two cameras.  One on your gun so we can actually see who you are shooting.  And a second on for fps view.  Stick to 1080p, I'm pretty sure anyone that uses YouTube always goes for 1080p.   The gun camera doesn't have to be amazing, but it actually has to show who is getting shot, not just some shitty zoom in.   My personal take on the matter."

You should still shoot at 720p60. I can upconvert the video for you and add an Anti-Aliasing filter for you if you want.

When this happens, stop firing from that gun and change/charge the battery."

Detailed version: It has a photogate sensor similar to a tracer unit that detects when a BB passes through it. This triggers a bank of 4 LEDs with color temperatures specifically chosen to resemble muzzle flash to light up. The inside of the unit is polished to reflect the light to basically every visible angle from the front.

They do the majority of their sales from online, so they have a very good idea of where in the country their sales are coming from. Their choice of physical retail locations reflects the data they compile from their sales.  Now I'm not saying that the Midwest doesnt have a strong airsoft community. I'm sure you guys are great and avid airsofters, but at the end of the day it comes down to simple numbers.  Evike/GI need to invest a certain amount into startup costs to get the store open, and then a monthly investment to keep the store open. If they don't foresee/forecast an acceptable return on investment, or ROI, from the store, then it doesn't make sense to open one in a particular region, even if the store does manage to make a profit. The opportunity cost associated with opening this store may mean missing out on other initiatives/opportunities, whether it's opening a store in a region with higher ROI, bringing in a new product line, or something else.  Again, I'm not questioning the eagerness of the community, but at the end of the day it comes down to simple numbers and what would help grow the company the most. They're not some evil corporations out to shaft the airsofters of the Midwest.  To an extent, that's the same reason why we never see airsoft versions of certain guns. There simply isn't the market to justify a significant return on investment to make financial sense."

airsoft,3detye,EmptyMaG,2,Wed Jul 15 21:11:57 2015 UTC,"At the end of the day, I think it comes down to sales from a region. If you had X dollars to start a store, would you open a store in a region that gets you Y dollars, or a region that gets you 5Y dollars? If a region isn't generating significant numbers, then it doesn't make sense financially.   I don't think it's fair to say that no one is actually looking.

I've been there last month and everything seemed fine.  Now, onto the tips:   Prepare for hot weather, I only put this first because Lake Elsinore is ridiculously hot in the summer. Sunscreen is a must in the desert. Sources of water include hydration bladders, Nalgene and other canteens, large packs of water bottles, and maybe even Gatorade/Powerade. Cooler with ice is great but not necessary. A towel and at least a spare t-shirt is good to have. Please abide all safety precautions, the owner is infamously known for chewing out people for shooting guns and leaving mags in the safe zone, and banning players for harsher violations. However, he's only trying to make sure no one gets hurt. Make sure to bring at least one pair of full-seal goggles or mask. Lower face protection is mandatory, ages 18+ can use cloth material like shemaghs and neck gaiters, younger need hard covers like metal mesh.  Don't be discouraged by semi-only. Lots of game modes there require the majority of the players to keep their guns on semi (with the exception of chosen ""machine gunners""). It's a good opportunity to learn how to burn less ammo and place shots better. Go nuts whenever they let you use auto, juuust don't light someone up while inside buildings and you're good.

I'm starting with a 300mm I've cut and I figure ill just keep cutting until I get to where I want it to be, but it would be nice to know where the ideal might be.  I tried a maple leaf bucking and it was kinda terrible in terms of accuracy.  Really bad groupings.  That's insane that you get so much range from it.  are you just using a stock nub with it?

airsoft,3denn1,Magdumper,2,Wed Jul 15 21:40:01 2015 UTC,"1 - I wouldn't cut a barrel unless you can professionally machine a new crown, because crown's purpose is to diffuse the air so overvoluming does not affect accuracy.  2 - Your goal is a hybrid field/cqb gun, witch is exactly what i did with my mp5k. My mp5k is legal is basically any field in the world (only 10 fps over Japanese fields atm, assuming they allow 1 joule), but heavily outranging my tokyo marui p90 that stock everything but the piston and spring, to upgrade it from 280 to 390 fps. The mp5k has a shorter barrel, less fps, and is built off a galaxy base, but still outdoes my tm p90 in every aspect, and that tm p90 is very field able as it is. The p90 has a 3/4 port, a 247mm barrel, and an ~m110ish spring. I need to actually put a 4/5 or full cylinder in the p90 because it significantly looses joules with heavier ammo...  3 - what am I saying? Id probably shoot for 350 fps on a .2 as your mark with a short barrel/full cyl, and depending how good you are at teching, choose a barrel length accordingly. to hit 355 fps with a 141mm 6.03 barrel (shitty ACM one I had), I needed an m130. On the other hand, the p90 hits 390 fps with an m110 because of the longer 247mm barrel and thus gives it more time to accelerate even on a much weaker spring. Id probaly pick an m110 spring on a 160-200mm barrel, because that would be right in your ballpark of 350-375 fps, and would still allow it to joule creep anough to be usable in field games, without breaking any rules. Note: I am not saying top use joule creep to break your fields joule limits, I'm just saying that you can switch ammo to get closer to your fields desired joule limits in a shorter package with the same gun. My mp5k for example, can be used in any field, anywhere, never break joule rules (not gunna use heavy bbs in cqb ever, no point), and still perform close to optimally.  Anything else you want to know?"

Should be a fun little experiment.  I'm chopping up a stock combat machine aluminum barrel that was crowned like hot shit so nothing will go to waste exactly.  Once I find a golden point maybe ill throw in a better barrel in the length I want.  thanks man!

Here are your options.   Cut coils off the spring. Go one at a time and keep chronoing until you see the result you want. Rack it and leave the spring compressed for some time, then chrono it. I recommend this the most. Take your spring out of the gun, get the necessary measurements, and then take the dimensions to mcmaster.com and get a spring of the same dimensions with less coils."

The point of the ghillie is to not look like a person hiding, waiting to kill people in ambush.    Regardless of ghillie type though you should consider what vegetation you should be adding to your suit.  Try not to grab too many branches and leaves.  Do be sure to grab dead grass and thicker ground covering flora.  It's hot out and plants will wilt faster when you pull them from the ground.  That's okay."

airsoft,3dgb9u,PM_ME_THAT_SNATCH,4,Thu Jul 16 01:20:29 2015 UTC,"The stock spring may be hooked into the piston.  On older designs, there is a metal piece that the piston head screws into, and then the spring has a hook and it hooked into it.  You have to unscrew your piston head to remove the spring, so slide the whole piston & spring out of your cylinder/gearbox."
airsoft,3dgb9u,omgalbert3,1 point,Thu Jul 16 01:53:21 2015 UTC,"That's what I figured, but when I try unscrewing the piston head, it just spun around but wouldn't actually screw out. So I wasn't sure exactly if that was the issue."
airsoft,3dgb9u,omgalbert3,1 point,Thu Jul 16 04:59:35 2015 UTC,"Ah yes, it can freely rotate at a certain point.  When it starts to unscrew from the spring-holding piece, you reach a certain point that you are simply rotating everything freely, when the spring-holding piece is no longer in the positioning-stabilizing-hole in the piston.  Try using another tool to push against the spring-holding piece inside the piston, like a flathead screwdriver, while you are unscrewing the piston head from the outside of the piston."

airsoft,3de66e,TheCowsRComing,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:36:14 2015 UTC,"You might actually look into the Tippmann M4.   It might not have the furniture you want right out of the box (it comes with standard M4 furniture), but it uses HPA with a mechanical trigger, which means that trigger response will be immediate, and it uses common M4 AEG magazines. You'll need to buy a remote line (so that the tank isn't hanging off the gun) and an HPA tank (3000 ci should be sufficient), but otherwise you would be good to go.   It's currently $450, which will give you $100-150 to spend on dressing it up or upgrading if you don't like how it comes out of the box."

I was wanting to grab a set of MTP but its about $100 for a shirt and then pants are about the same. Flecktarn is ridiculously cheap that some places have such low prices theyre basically giving it away. Varusteleka is probably the best place to grab flecktarn gear, then asmc is just as good.

airsoft,3dba8t,wilbo-swaggins,3,Tue Jul 14 23:01:46 2015 UTC,"These custom grips were made out of solid oak trim. I started by planing the wood down to thickness and then used a Dremel with a sanding attachment to finish the shaping. The weathering was done by dipping the grips into some darker stain and then letting them sit overnight. Once the stain had time to soak in a bit, I dipped the grips into some paint thinner and used a rag to wipe off the excess stain, giving the grips a nice aged and slightly worn look."

airsoft,3d9v6r,BlitzOne,4,Tue Jul 14 18:40:46 2015 UTC,VFC takedown is mostly like the real AK where the TM has 4 screws under the body. Also the VFC/VFC Clone AKs are mostly steel and have better internals.
airsoft,3d9v6r,Insertclevername7141,3,Tue Jul 14 19:30:59 2015 UTC,"VFC style also has different bolt handle style and can use a complete mock bolt optionally, and lacks the annoying battery tray bracket seen in the TM design.  VFC style also can accept newer furniture accessories that are popular since they are closer to real steel dimensions slightly, for example some handguards such as popular Zenitco style."

airsoft,3dafqc,TheCowsRComing,13,Tue Jul 14 19:23:50 2015 UTC,"Game was part of IplayAIrsoft's Robin Sage series. I think is was game 3.  Repost from HERE  My buddies and I were playing as an NPC sheep herders (Villagers). We were technically neutral and were used as informants, guides and support to the UN troops. We did the same for the local warlords.   The night was pretty dull, doing backroom (tent) deals with both sides for encampment locations, patrol paths and locations for objectives (bomb controller, missile sights and the like). We decided to pack up and take our sheep (each of us carried a cowbell to simulate a herd, people could hear us 100 yards away) to ""greener pastures""  Anyways, the UN forces thought it was suspicious that we would pack up and move, so they decided dispatch a squad to tail us, about 50 yards behind. Knowing we were being followed, we hailed the local warlord and told him we had info about a stray UN patrol and gave him coordinates 100 or so yards ahead of us.   We increased our pace and the UN troops did the same. As we neared the coordinates, we could see the lights from the warlord's militia.   When the militia were in sight, we took a sharp turn south and sprinted up a hill to watch the ""festivities"". We have our night game around full Moons, so we have plenty of residual light to watch the oncoming firefight.  In about 2 minutes, both forces clashed in the middle of the field. The UN squad opened fired on the militia scouts and the militia called in for support in return. The firefight lasted for over 10 minutes, with the militia getting steady reinforcements. The UN forces took a heavy toll. After 15 minutes, the firefight was over.   Pretty much cut off from the core UN forces, the tailing squad was disarmed and taken as POW's. The POW's were then rounded up and brought to us in exchange for information.   We got some strong kudos after the game for our deceptive ambush."

airsoft,3dafqc,kuavi,4,Tue Jul 14 21:46:18 2015 UTC,"Coming from someone who just roleplayed at a game, it's great if you can deal with players that kill on sight and are okay with being captured until you can escape.  It's amazing what you can get away with sometimes."
airsoft,3dafqc,aznriptide859,3,Tue Jul 14 23:09:47 2015 UTC,"like, can they just have people walk on to ops with civi load outs whose only purpose is to be an extra? I would love to walk around with an m16a1 with only three midcaps and a satchel to hold them. be part of a market, have personal objectives. if any of the main forces get in your way, sure shoot them, but don't get caught or they can arrest you.  as you can see, i really want to roleplay a game."
airsoft,3dafqc,Aldorf,3,Wed Jul 15 01:54:14 2015 UTC,"It depends on the event organizer and type of OP he is running.  For an OP in shoreham's decommissioned nuclear facility, the roleplayers there were an OPFOR to both sides.  For the one I went to, the roleplayers were used more to come in contact with other players to enhance the experience for the first day.  The second day was more playing as a 3rd group of enemy combatants to ensure objectives weren't completed before the other side could get there.  Pretty much you do whatever the event organizer says for you to do.  He'll set up objectives for you to complete and then you go do it.  You'll likely also work as staff for the event, helping to set-up, chrono and clean up afterwards.  The only milsim level OP roleplaying I've done is with MSATO and they do not accept walk-on roleplayers.  Maybe other milsim OP's do but I'd imagine most if not all would want to either know you personally or have you referred by  someone they trust.  Again the loadout as with everything else is primarily set by the role the event organizer wants you to do.  You can fill in the specifics of your role's loadout yourself as any decent event organizer won't be bothered to micromanage details such as the amount of mags or loadbearing equipment used.    My advice to you is find out who runs milsim games around where you live and try to network with them."

The team ran out of gunners, so they called me to be the turret gunner since I had an MG36 at the time.  Except they didn't make gunner rules clear, originally stating if the gunner was shot, he wasn't dead until a rocket/GL hit was called on the tank (this was changed once I left...poor other gunner).

airsoft,3dafqc,The_Mexx,2,Tue Jul 14 22:22:34 2015 UTC,"I used to Ref at GoldEagle Airsoft in Duluth Georgia, and it's since shutdown, reopened under a different name, and shut down again. I was already a seasoned veteran and a kid named Patrick, who was a new ref, talked a big game and never really knew how to back out of a challenge.  Well, he challenged me to a duel. He had just bought his first MP5 after upgrading from having only a sidearm. We had a 20,000 sq ft indoor arena with four plywood houses and plenty of other cover.   The match starts and we sprint at each other firing wildly, ducking and dodging. He sees that I have not brought my rifle and am only using a pistol. I had decided to use a handicap since he was simply outmatched.   The fool puts his gun down and pulls out his pistol thinking it will 'even the odds.'   I picked up his gun and shot him in the back with it. /ninja  Round 2: Fight - Favorite memory, no best game, I got close enough to a kid wearing a clown mask who was posted up. I whistled and instead of turning his gun he turns his head and I popped him in the forehead. So satisfying and assassin-like.   FINISH HIM - I once solo'd an entire team of sixteen 9-15 year olds. At one point I hurdled a stream of BBs for a Knife safety kill.   I liked OPs story too."

Madbull only makes 2 CO2 compatible shells, ask me about them if you really want. Keep in mind the co2 charger alone cost $85.   I have heard very good things about MAG brand shells if you want a more cost friendly option.   Shower shells with 6 holes instead of 12 will have a little more range.  8mm shells are a gimmick.   You can buy a 100 pack of replacement grenade bearings for about $8 on amazon if you know what size to get. Same for o-rings. You can get replacement o-rings for cheap from McMaster Carr. The only replacement parts you should by fr Madbull are release valves plungers, springs, and fill valves.   Let me know if you have any questions."

I clean and relube them once every 6 or so scenarios. They're super easy to maintain, relatively cheap, if I remember correctly, and preform great. I highly recommend them. Oh and if you want to shoot a projectile that's not Bbs, just pack whatever it is you want to launch in your launcher barrel. I like to print off a bunch of knock off 100 dollar bills, keeping it legal lol, and shoot them out along with the Bbs so it looks like the 'payback' kills from call of duty. The smoke grenades I get also fit snugly in a 40mm barrel with a layer or two of tissue around them. Grenades are a lot of fun, hope you enjoy them as much as I do!"

airsoft,3d649m,ColonelCubbage,2,Tue Jul 14 04:09:00 2015 UTC,"I've considered switching to propane. Is it safe for a KWA M9 PTP?

airsoft,3d649m,Oh_Sweet_Jeebus,7,Tue Jul 14 04:02:17 2015 UTC,Not that I know of. Propane is a poisonous gas. The smell is purposely put there to deter you from smelling it if possible.
airsoft,3d649m,richisonfire,11,Tue Jul 14 04:14:51 2015 UTC,"To be fair, all gasses are poisonous if they're the only thing you're breathing ;)  But yeah. The smell is actually a gigantic turnoff for me"

airsoft,3d649m,Kalashnireznikov,3,Tue Jul 14 06:49:58 2015 UTC,"It's safe. Some people will tell you that it's a few PSI higher in pressure, but with properly lubricated O-rings that's well within the parameters of their design even if using propane on a hotter day (which would increase the PSI twofold).   There's not a way to get propane without the odorant, but it's for situations like OP's. If OP had a proper propane tank, it would just blow off the extra pressure safely instead of violently bursting, and the smell would let you know when all the propane had actually left the vehicle.   If you value not smelling anything over significantly cheaper and safer propane, that's your call. Me, I can deal with it. Plus it makes it easy to set up a mini-grill for some impromptu hot dogs and burgers."
airsoft,3d649m,NATOMarksman,2,Tue Jul 14 04:38:43 2015 UTC,You can certainly buy pure N-propane but it would be most cost effective to buy like 30lb at a time at least. I know this because of the medical cannabis industry using pure N-propane as a solvent
airsoft,3d649m,LeprechronicChris,2,Tue Jul 14 05:50:27 2015 UTC,"I don't really consider that an option since the idea behind using propane as a propellent for airsoft is that it's cheaper.   Plus, industrial-grade pure propane is overkill since it's going to be essentially wasted (i.e not reacted or used in any product) anyway."
airsoft,3d649m,NATOMarksman,1 point,Tue Jul 14 05:56:36 2015 UTC,"Being honest, the smell actually made my eyes water a little. Grilling DOES seem like a major positive though... I'll have to consider"

I know most people buy from airsoftgi or Evike, but with the upcoming sale I am willing to buy from Amazon if the discount is deep enough.  The problem is they don't have the large selection of AEGs like airsoft specialty sites.  I guess a better question would have been ""Other than a Combat Machine, are there any other AEGs on Amazon worth buying?""  I know we don't know what items will be discounted or how big discounts will be, I just wanted to see if there are any other quality AEGs to monitor and watch for discounts since most of Amazon's selection is springers or crappy AEGs."

airsoft,3d7w7m,4627,10,Tue Jul 14 05:08:23 2015 UTC,"Not ""unique"" in a sense of rarity, but by far the most customizable, reliable and upgradable pistol is the TM Hi-Capa 5.1. Speedsofters use them, some milsimers use them; you can easily make your Hi-Capa your own. Shoots straight and consistently, too, even in upper East Coast winters.  A drawback though, is that it's going to cost you. The pistol itself is around $150 alone, plus mags are gonna be a pain. Secondly, the gun comes with a plastic slide, which will snap if used with green gas or propane. On top of that is that most of the better looking slides can only be ordered from overseas, making this cost almost as much as an AEG. But, hell, as a CQB-guy, I love mine to death, and it's definitely an eye-catcher."
airsoft,3d7w7m,KiwiTheDriller,2,Tue Jul 14 05:53:03 2015 UTC,"Secondly, the gun comes with a plastic slide, which will snap if used with green gas or propane   If it helps, the 4.3 model is less prone to breaking if you have a shock buffer or several in there.

Again, your gun takes M14-size magazines, so you will need to find SCAR-H specific magazines.   The modification bit refers to VFC SCAR-Ls and M4s (which can take M4-type magazines), because the magazine is fitted and may be wider than VFC specification; it would require some sanding to fit properly in those magazine wells.

airsoft,3dbgjk,sokolske,8,Wed Jul 15 01:08:19 2015 UTC,"No he's not.  He is just stating an obvious point that you just bought m4 magazines for a scar H.   IMHO, those magazines look very different. So much so that it is shocking that you actually bought them for that specific gun.   So now, not only do you have to return those magazines, but the pouches and the chest rig. As I am fairly certain that the rig only has available m4 style magazine systems.   All because the gun you wanted, a scar L, wasn't in the available color of black, when a spray paint can could do the job.  But with this in mind, it makes sense why you didn't do that, because if you could not find the right magazines for the gun, chances are that you probably would fuck up an all black paint job.  And no sort of witty and snark remark could cover this error.  So yeah, that's why the guy is getting up voted and you down voted."

airsoft,3dbgjk,The_Mexx,3,Wed Jul 15 00:00:21 2015 UTC,"Cancel your SCAR-H order while you have the chance. The VFC SCAR-H is well-known for being overpriced and having shitty quality internals.  Everyone's already explained everything by the time I write this - you bought a SCAR-H, M4/M16 magazines do not work inside it as they are smaller than SCAR-H magazines. The reason the page for the mag doesn't state specifically that it will not fit the SCAR-H is because it's too obvious to mention, the same way it doesn't say that they won't fit AK47's or Glock pistols."

Tan over green and visa versa. Then I used a third color (brown) to go over the whole thing in random areas, giving it a very broken up look. Honestly it really didn't take long.

airsoft,3d57t9,MrFlakeOne,2,Mon Jul 13 16:53:58 2015 UTC,"I repainted my Sig552 (JG) yesterday. I used Fosco's Coyote and Marsh Grass and local flora to get the camo pattern. The backpack in Coyote Brown and pouch in Ranger Green are on the picture for the reference.  I needed to repaint it, because before that it was painted in a pattern that you can see on Eotech replica (I used TOO MUCH Fosco's Pale Green spray - beware of that unless you really want to have a mint colour on your paintjobs).   Additionally I'm waiting for the courrier with my Micro T1 replica and MOE style vertical grip, which is going to replace Eotech and angled foregrip."
airsoft,3d57t9,J13D,2,Mon Jul 13 16:54:07 2015 UTC,"Looks pretty awsome, i love Sig's and prefer the all black but that still looks really cool.   On another note, is the bolt catch on that fully functional? Just curious.."
airsoft,3d57t9,Rebel_toaster,2,Mon Jul 13 17:43:32 2015 UTC,"If it's a JG SIG, than no. I have one and the bolt catch isn't functional sadly"
airsoft,3d57t9,Rebel_toaster,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:27:32 2015 UTC,That's what I thought. Btw. what's your opinion about this model? I didn't have an occassion to shoot it for a longer time yet. I really like the ergonomics and fact that it's 2x lighter than my AK ;).
airsoft,3d57t9,Rebel_toaster,2,Tue Jul 14 07:13:30 2015 UTC,"I really like it for close quarters and the fact that it's very light. My only gripes about it are that I'm not a fan of the iron sights (and my rear one came broken) and the small battery space. You'll only fit am 8.4v. And it's also kind of a bitch to take apart. I spent hours trying to take it apart and couldn't quite disassemble it completely. I wouldn't recommend it as a full on primary for long range, but it's great for close quarters. I really like the SIG552, and definitely recommend adding one to any arsenal, and for ~$140-150 you can't really go wrong with this one. But if you're looking for a better SIG, than ICS is the way to go, provides you've got the money to spend."
airsoft,3d57t9,MaceRider,1 point,Tue Jul 14 11:56:54 2015 UTC,Yeah I also agree that the whole body (the way that it's assebled) might be a pain in the ass to disassembly. I agree about small battery space but I'm using 7.4 lipo and it fits perfectly - there's RIS rail on upper handguard so you can always use a ANPQ replica to put battery in it.   SIG ICS is really cool as far as I know but it's totally different league.
airsoft,3d57t9,MaceRider,2,Tue Jul 14 14:01:58 2015 UTC,"I don't have the equipment to run lipos, no Lipo charger or connector or anything like that. I'm trying to keep my SIG fairly stock as a back up to when my main gun is out of commission  Way out of my league too, but they seem nice. Maybe one day when I'm done with school"
airsoft,3d57t9,Rebel_toaster,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:59:25 2015 UTC,"Thank you!   According to bolt catch - I have no idea if it has any function to be honest, because I didn't disassemble this one (when the gun is assembled it doesn't even move). On the other hand, the charging handle works as in AK's, so you can regulate the hop up unit."
airsoft,3d57t9,Rebel_toaster,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:10:50 2015 UTC,"You did a good job on the pattern and overall paint job, but you need to weather it a bit to make it look like a ""proper gun""."
airsoft,3d57t9,Rebel_toaster,2,Mon Jul 13 17:45:54 2015 UTC,"Thank you! :)  I think that it will wear off a bit when I'll be using it. I purchased it from another guy recently as a CQB alternative to my AK. This Sig is very compact, lightweight and has around 350 fps. I also purchased 4 MAG midcaps and they work like a charm - they are also transparent like these beta project mags for AK - I love it!"

Never heard of this company or this pistol so I tried to do some late night searching but didn't really find anything on reddit so I just watched a couple of YouTube guys do reviews. Seems like an alright gun.  Also read somewhere that it's compatible with KWC/Elice Force parts and that it may be a rebranded KWC? No idea. That would be pretty cool though. I'll probably just end up putting it back in the box and selling it.  Oh ya, and 2 meh pictures that one of the staff got of me when I wasn't entirely paying attention.

airsoft,3d6ueg,86fsb,1 point,Tue Jul 14 01:04:24 2015 UTC,"What do you mean? Because they do birthday parties for kids sometimes, aswell because of a lack of good advertising they did get a lot of local kids.

For the changing of hands, after the fallout with them and cobalt they would hire people who would say things and not actually do anything or were a bad fit and didn't know much about the airsoft community.

They're useful if I'm on a large field with a lot of people and critical for large assaults. What bothers me is when it causes disruptions in response. I've lost count how many times I've seen fireteams and full on squads decked out with comms completely stop in their tracks when a command or report comes over the wire.  Radios are good tools to have but they're also major distractions.  My favorite tool to take out on the field is my map pouch with a plastic insert. One side I put a field layout, other side a sheet of grid paper. A couple of dry erase markers makes impromptu planning of attacks pretty easy to communicate."

That's why the wires are so long, because they have to go all the way from the end of the rail to the trigger guard.   If you're using a foregrip or otherwise want to use the switch with your grip hand, use a physical on/off switch endcap, do a mild amount of electrical work by removing a section of the wire and re-splicing it, buy a shorter remote switch, or just make your own remote switch."

However, I suspect that they will start becoming ""legal"" to sell soon enough since the British Forces are apparently being issued the Revision Batlskin Viper helmet in the future. As for where I got mine, I got almost all my kit from various UK eBay stores. Whether the helmet is from there or not I'll leave unsaid."

airsoft,3d6bnd,Lordmonocrona,5,Mon Jul 13 21:32:12 2015 UTC,"You also have to take into account what the field is like. If you are playing in a big ass open field with minimal coverage then it is pretty hard to get kills or flank since the average engagement distance is 150 feet and people can see you across the field and tell everyone that you are there. So in this instance you need a gun with good range and accuracy and know how to use said gun. Indoor CQB is a whole different story. You don't need that good of a gun since engagement distances will be <75 feet. You just need to know how to point the gun toward the enemy and shoot.  Now if we are looking at just money spent compared to how good you are at the sport. It doesn't matter if you spend 100 dollars on a CYMA AK or 500 dollars on a Real Sword. They are both AKs, they will both shoot BBs, but one will shoot accurately out to 150 feet and the other to 275 feet+.

Assuming we're not talking about some £10 spring pistol with an effective range of the muzzle vs. a suped up AEG/HPA/GBB, your weapon is not likely to yield noticeable improvements. To me, your weapon and gear are there to compliment/augment your play style and strategies: a means to an end."
airsoft,3d6bnd,SoggyPorridge,1 point,Mon Jul 13 21:49:56 2015 UTC,"I am an opportunist when it comes to airsoft. Do I have a clear shot at an enemy? Can I get teammates to give me cover fire while I most up? My tactics aren't kosher, but what fun is that in a normal pickup game? Also, with gear, if you are a more up-close-and-personal player, use a plate carrier because it will give you the most protection in the chest area and it can add a lot of molle space. If you use a Sniper or DMR, use a battle belt/chest rig because you normally aren't directly in the fight and are usually set up a good ways back. Also having gear that is customized to your preference is a big help: pouches in the right spot so reloads go quicker, dump-pouch is easily accessible, pistol holster is an easy draw (mine's a pain in the ass but it is out of the way). Little things like that help majorly."

IE: Handling Fundamentals, Map knowledge, Tactics, Teamwork.  If you and your opponent are equally skilled, odds favor the person with greater accuracy, range and rate of fire.  Skill is more important overall, until you get to the upper end of the spectrum; as the skill gap closes the equipment gap becomes more relevant.  I prefer people who are:  A. Aggressive. B. Know their personal and equipment's limitations.  C. Know how to minimize those limitations. D. Learn from their mistakes."
airsoft,3d6bnd,Infide1icious,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:02:01 2015 UTC,"There's a lot of factors that come into play. Two of my favorites is Morale and Health. These two are universal to all situations. I can't really give you advice suited to your specific one since I don't know it.  A sharp, toned, and trained body will outperform one that's not in every situation, all other factors being equal. The quality of your resources, managing your resources, and deploying the best resources you have against your opponents is fundamentally strategic. Thus keeping your body, your most important powerful, important, and often used resource fit is the best strategical decision, one that wins fights before they start and gives you a definite heads up during.  Next is Morale. A team that respects each other, wants to impress each other, and fears appearing weak in the face of one another is one that will take initiative, be methodical, and think out their every action so as to not make mistakes, not appear unwilling to commit, and tries as hard as they can to work with team-mates. Team mates with a high, group focused morale will be more likely to check corners before moving out, will take positions to defend their mates, and synergize with their movements, and won't retreat or cower in cover when the firefight gets too rough and BB's fly everywhere. People with such morale will throw themselves onto the dirt, looking for a new angle, or swap sides instead of huddling in the middle, waiting for the storm to abate.  To build such a mindset, it's crucial to actively interact with other players, especially the younger ones. Get to know them, praise their specialties when they do well, and point out when they make mistakes. It takes patience, time, and personal charisma. But it can be done."

If you're set on a GLOCK, I would definitely recommend looking at Stark Arms' GLOCKs. They're high-quality plastic and reasonable metal, cost about the same as a TM, and are available with CO2 magazines to help push the metal slide in the winter."

airsoft,3d46jz,Pure_Silver,2,Tue Jul 14 08:35:03 2015 UTC,"If you want to play in UK temperatures, spend £130-140ish, and buy a gun that will last, definitely start looking at recent Tokyo Marui releases. I'd have a look at the M&P9, USPc and HK45 if possible - they're the newest and best releases."
airsoft,3d46jz,Pure_Silver,1 point,Mon Jul 13 11:50:23 2015 UTC,I thought the main concern with temperature was which gas to use?
airsoft,3d46jz,spaghettifellout,2,Tue Jul 14 08:35:21 2015 UTC,"There are limits to what gas you can get and also what gas the pistol will be able to handle. If you buy a metal gun, especially one with a skinny single-stack magazine (which means low gas capacity), e.g. a WE 1911, you have a very small amount of gas trying to move a heavy (dense, weak pot metal) slide and outer barrel. That weight demands more gas, which in turn empties the tiny reservoir even faster, which empties even faster owing to adiabatic cooling which disproportionately affects small magazines. Cold weather exacerbates all of these problems by lowering the vapour pressure of the gas and thereby decreasing operating efficiency; a cheap metal gun in cold weather is a perfect storm of inefficiency that leads to crap performance, if it will work at all.  The upshot of this is that what you want for UK weather - generally cold and miserable - is a gun with good gas capacity (double-stack magazines) and lightweight moving parts. The M&P9, USPc and HK45 all have big double-stack magazines and lightweight ABS plastic slides and barrels - which mean they're very gas efficient and will operate in cold weather without slowing down and eventually failing. You can easily purchase lightweight aluminium replacements for the slide and barrel if you want extra realism without ruining the gun's performance."
airsoft,3d46jz,Jimlasomething,2,Tue Jul 14 09:31:44 2015 UTC,"Ahh, thanks for the detailed response!  Is there any real loss of durability when going for an ABS slide/barrel? Thinking more from a mechanical point of view with regard to repeated firing rather than dropping/hitting on objects etc.  Also, this last weekend it was roughly 28C and very humid, is that going to cause problems if I choose more of a cold-weather oriented gun?"
airsoft,3d46jz,TheCowsRComing,2,Tue Jul 14 10:32:19 2015 UTC,"Is there any real loss of durability when going for an ABS slide/barrel?   As compared with high-quality aluminium alloy, yes. As compared with the dreadful pot metal most cheap airsoft guns are made of, not really. The key thing that eventually does in ABS is...   Also, this last weekend it was roughly 28C and very humid, is that going to cause problems if I choose more of a cold-weather oriented gun?   ...extremes of temperature. TM guns aren't 'cold-weather oriented' so much as they are just efficient, but in hot weather if used with inappropriate gas (as it gets hotter, vapour pressure of propellants rises significantly) they can crack just like everything else. It's easy and cheap to get spares for TM's guns (something it may not be for other manufacturers') but you can usually avoid any problems by switching to lower-pressure propellant in very warm weather."
airsoft,3d46jz,TheCowsRComing,2,Tue Jul 14 11:10:19 2015 UTC,"Aha, okay! I'm probably leaning towards the Stark Arms Glocks, I'm a sucker for the G17 really. Assuming the parts market is OK for them that is!  Is the Super Combat model (CO2) worth the £40 premium over the ""regular""?  e.g. http://www.patrolbase.co.uk/airsoft-pistols/stark-arms-super-grade-s17-co2-pistol-cnc-slide-silver-black.htm#.VaTuRPlVhBc  vs  http://www.patrolbase.co.uk/airsoft-pistols/1-stark-arms-combat-s17-gas-pistol-tan.htm#.VaTuNflVhBc  Thanks for all your input by the way, very much appreciated!"

The bottom one is the new (to me) one, and is a Tokyo Marui. There's something about the G36 that I just love, so I'm glad to be sticking with one.  It's remarkable how identical they are, but I guess that's to be expected since they're based off a real gun, and pretty much everyone (from my understanding) makes clones of Tokyo Marui's guns."

The base gun is a KWA M4, however I am unaware of the specific model because I got it through a trade. I was not happy with it's default performance so I revamped everything in this puppy except the barrel set-up! The internal highlights are as following:  Matrix 3000 motor  Nukefet  Krytak gears  Angle custom aluminum piston  and a heck of a lot more! The only GB parts that are the same is the (unnecessarily) reinforced GB shell and barrel set up. As for externals I personally have added an unknown brand railed gas block and I have added a (Matrix?) T1 (plus the paint job).   Regarding the decal I personally designed the team logo and had /u/DoWhileGeek print out the decal. For the record he does good work, I would recommend him! As for the design I am currently in art school for graphic design so I spent a fair amount of time with the logo. My buddy and I (the only team members) are both Christian so the half circle on top is to represent under God. As for the two quarter circles at the bottom, that is to represent me and my team mate. In the center I tried to make the design seem to be both an arrow piercing armor and a simplistic pine tree outline. Let me know what you all think! :)  EDIT: Is this deleted? :P"

airsoft,3d83ki,_So_Others_May_Live_,16,Tue Jul 14 06:39:06 2015 UTC,"[""Have you played in an airsoft match before!""] no.   Please come back and update us all on how you totally dominated your first ever airsoft game using only a rental M9 GBB.   i also don't see what is so hard about firing a gun and hitting a target.   For real, though, you are going to get obliterated. You have no experience with airsoft or, it would appear, with firearms - replica or real - of any other sort, and your plan is to take a vastly inferior weapon into a game against other players with much more experience and much greater firepower. This is not a good plan and talking tough...   and i may be out-gunned, but i am not out matched.   ...is not going to make it a good plan."
airsoft,3d83ki,_So_Others_May_Live_,-18,Tue Jul 14 09:09:48 2015 UTC,"i have no plan, therefor it is neither good, nor bad. and i have fired a gun, once. i hit what i was shooting at."
airsoft,3d83ki,Plasmus642,13,Tue Jul 14 09:16:13 2015 UTC,"Take it from someone that has fired a lot of guns and played a considerable amount of airsoft, then: don't play your first airsoft game using only a pistol. It is nothing like CoD, nothing like shooting real weapons, and probably not very much like you're imagining, either. Also, talking in one-liners like a bad dubbing of an action movie isn't very reassuring.  In airsoft accuracy at range and firepower are king. Projectiles are light, slow, and easily dodged or blown off course. The easiest way to compensate for this is to have a high rate of fire, which pistols don't, to have long-distance accuracy, which pistols usually don't, and to be a steady shooting platform, which pistols aren't.  If you're dead-set on heading out into your first ever airsoft game clutching a semi-automatic handgun, well, we can't stop you. But nobody here - all of whom have played many, many more games than you have - is saying that doing so is a good idea."
airsoft,3d83ki,UncleTouchers,9,Tue Jul 14 09:42:53 2015 UTC,So do you think having a 20 bb mag in a semi auto pistol is a big disadvantage when the other person has 100+ in the mag and can go full auto? And also I wouldn't compare airsoft to COD.
airsoft,3d83ki,UncleTouchers,-16,Tue Jul 14 06:41:43 2015 UTC,"i do not, it is how i use those 20 bb's compared to how someone else uses their 100."
airsoft,3d83ki,catsatonmykeyboard,12,Tue Jul 14 06:44:04 2015 UTC,"Tactics can only get you so far. Also it isn't real steel shooting. The bb's aren't lasers and they move much slower, your not going to hit everything.  20 w/ semi auto IS a disadvantage to 100+ w/ auto, there is no way around that"

airsoft,3d83ki,Sneekygreenman,3,Tue Jul 14 06:52:54 2015 UTC,"As someone who has had their gun eat shit on them and be forced to play pistol only with only two 21-round mags for the rest of the day... No. You can use those 21 BBs to suppress people and keep their heads down, but you're gonna run out of BBs real fucking fast. You can try being sneaky and get behind them, but as soon as you get seen (You've never played airsoft, you probably will get seen), you're gonna have 7 or 8 guns turn on you before you can take anyone out. You can be speedy and do a run-through, bunkering people as you go, but guess what? If it takes you 4 or 5 shots to hit a person while on the move, you can only hit 4 or 5 people before you run out, and that's assuming they aren't shooting back. Which they will be. En masse. Sure, playing pistol only can be a whole lot of fun, but from my experience, it's only a lot of fun if you don't give a shit about winning or getting hit. You're going to be outgunned. You're going to be outplayed by people who have been playing for years. That's how it works. You can't rely on tactics and speed for everything. You just can't. Stop kidding yourself."
airsoft,3d83ki,dieDoktor,14,Tue Jul 14 16:05:49 2015 UTC,It's not a dig at you. It's a fact. Can your pistol dump a 300 round mag on full auto without having to reload? No? Then that's a disadvantage.
airsoft,3d83ki,Sneekygreenman,-15,Tue Jul 14 06:43:10 2015 UTC,is a gun with a 300 round mag able to move around faster than a pistol? than that is a disadvantage.
airsoft,3d83ki,omgalbert3,14,Tue Jul 14 06:47:18 2015 UTC,...I...I don't even know to respond to that. Of course you won't be entirely disadvantaged. I never said that and it is common sense. You'll just have a lot more.

airsoft,3d42lq,kjaxxn,3,Mon Jul 13 12:50:55 2015 UTC,"Contacts are really the best solution, other than Lasix/Eye surgery. Having prescription inserts or regular glasses means there are more lens surfaces to fog. And regular glasses under goggles is uncomfortable even with everything adjusted well. Somehow, somewhere you'll get an extra pressure point on your face from the elastic band of the goggles pushing the glasses. Dealing with a mesh mask and goggles is enough of a hassle."

One Fogtech wipe per day and I rarely get too fogged up to play (has to be 80-90ºF heat and 3 hrs of play in). The glasses and insert themselves are cheap, but it's expensive to have the prescription filled.

airsoft,3d31h2,BQJJ,14,Mon Jul 13 03:08:45 2015 UTC,"I'd say ditch this parts list all together :/ First off, you're going to want to shop at Brill Armory or Clandestine Airsoft, far better parts at a fraction of the price.    SP150 spring on a stock A&K gearbox is a bit much. You'll crack that thing in no time if you don't radius the frontward cylinder and use a thick 70d+ sorbo pad, especially when in conjunction with a heavy piston set up. The piston you've selected is short-stroked from 15 to 14 teeth, which will lower your FPS and require you to grind down a tooth on your sector.  Guarder gears are god awful in my experience. They strip extremely easily, mesh extremely poorly, and tend to be far too thick, making proper shimming impossible.  Don't use bearings on a high-FPS setup. Just...don't...please. Also, don't use .25s in a DMR setup, use at least a .30g+. You're also going to want to use a stainless steel or brass barrel in a high-FPS setup. It goes without saying that R-Hop or Flat Hop is must for a great long range build.  Hope this helps :)"
airsoft,3d31h2,RaptureHitler,2,Mon Jul 13 04:13:01 2015 UTC,"It does help, thanks for your list of suggestions! Everything on there sounds good, although I wanted to point out that I have a G&P gearbox on the list, I didn't plan on running the stock one, haha. Also, the .25s were for my current gun, not the DMR. xD I had them on there and forgot to remove them. But nonetheless, thanks so much! I'll adjust this list at some point today and share it with you to see what you think, if you don't mind."
airsoft,3d31h2,RaptureHitler,2,Mon Jul 13 10:05:53 2015 UTC,"Aaah, that makes more sense. I feel a bit silly now, I didn't see there were another two pages. I'm gonna have to make a few more suggestions after seeing the rest of the parts :D   APS parts are non-standard despite how they advertise them as V2 compatible. Their tappets are made specifically for their nozzles, which are smaller in inner and outer diameter than a standard one. Their cut off leavers, while standard V2, are made of the thinnest, cheapest pot metal imaginable. SHS tappet plates and Lonex cut-off levers are awesome, cheap replacements that certainly beat the hell out of anything APS.  G&P motors are really over-priced and have a bad tendency to burn out, especially using an AB set up. As an alternative, SHS, ZCI and JG motors listed as 22TPA+ are perfect for DMR builds. I strongly recommend you stay away from purchasing LiPos from airsoft stores and visit a hobby or RC store like HobbyKing. The LiPos on there are far higher quality and much cheaper.   Once everything's adjusted, I think this will be a great build. Great choice on getting the complete G&P gearbox. G&P parts are solid, so, if you're new to teching and screw something up, you can always fall back on some of the original G&P parts."
airsoft,3d31h2,RaptureHitler,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:25:53 2015 UTC,"I just now realized you're the one who wrote the guide to barrels, flat hop, and R-hop. I feel honored to get your advice, haha! Don't worry about feeling silly, I feel silly myself as I'm new to upgrading so I feel like I've made some obvious mistakes to more seasoned people, lol.  Okay, so based on your original comment and this most recent one, I have some questions.   Going with the G&P gearbox, would I still need to make the adjustments you listed due to the SP150 spring (""...radius the frontward cylinder and use a thick 70d+ sorbo pad, especially when in conjunction with a heavy piston set up..."")? The bearings... do you mean the bushings or the spring guide? I went with a bearing spring guide 'cause the DMR guide said it will help keep the spring straight and make it more reliable. If you mean the bushings, I assume I should just use regular bushings instead? The DMR guide says to omit the anti-reversal latch in place of a mosfet. Since those are fairly pricey, would it be doable to just keep the anti-reversal latch until I can put in a mosfet? From what I understand, installing a mosfet/taking out the latch only serves to improve trigger response.   I think that's it for now. I've taken your other points and turned them into quick and easy notes I can refer to so I can adjust the parts list. :D"
airsoft,3d31h2,The_Mexx,2,Mon Jul 13 20:56:58 2015 UTC,"Haha! Thanks, man. I feel honored that you feel honored to be honored by my honor? Something like that :D   Sorbothane is a great way to prevent gearbox cracking. When used in conjunction with a neoprene pad, it can prolong the life of your shell and drastically increase the life and performance of your piston. Radiusing isn't really advised with thicker gearbox shells like G&Ps, on top of that, it's a bit unnecessary because they're so damn thick.  I was referring to bearing bushings. It's a bit of force of habit to refer to bearing bushings as ""bearings"", sorry :/ They very easily cave in and can often sink on heavy loads. Bearing spring guides essentially have no downside and are a must for a first-time upgrade.  AB or ""Active Breaking"" MOSFETs work by moving the ""stop and start"" part of the cycling process from the bevel gear and AR Latch to the motor. This is the most tricky question as AB Fets usually have to be programmed to work correctly as a replacement for AR Latches. In other words, it varies from build to build and FET to FET, so this is one you're just going to have to wait and see with.   Have fun :)"

airsoft,3d3agw,chewbakka4lyfe,3,Mon Jul 13 04:29:08 2015 UTC,"as /u/rashanav said, It would be more finiky, and just would be liable.  saying that, if you have an m249, use a mid cap m4 mag in the side well, that will give you a realistic capacity. saying that, support weapons have 100 or 200 normally, the standard infantry man has 30rd mags. so if  30rds = ~120 - 150 bbs(depending on the brand) that 4 or 5x the capacity, that would mean LMG's should have ~500 to 1000 bbs, and most seem pretty close to that number, so why put them at the disadvantage of less bbs, plus the pain of trying to carry those big boxes they use for mags?"
airsoft,3d3agw,The_Mexx,1 point,Mon Jul 13 04:46:11 2015 UTC,"Well that's my point. I understand the spring issue, as I've heard it before, but would 500ish rounds really be that much for a spring to handle? Half the point is that the 2-3000+ capacity of most box mags is far too high to begin with."
airsoft,3d3agw,Avers8418,3,Mon Jul 13 05:01:41 2015 UTC,"I met a guy at a field up in ohio that would buy a 5,000 round bag and I'd watch him split it into 4-5 bags and get them about even. He said he felt like it was a little unfair to have 5,000 in a mag so he tried to balance the game by having to fire in ""shorter"" bursts and reload more often.  Never really thought 50 rounds would be considered a short burst until that moment. Choosing to do what he did really comes to the core principle of airsoft, its a game of honor. He handicapped his gun to improve the environment of the game. It wasn't about getting kills or winning. He enjoyed watching enemies make the rush when he had to reload. It forced other teams to work together or get gunned down by his 249."

airsoft,3d3agw,Ruschnav,2,Mon Jul 13 15:34:13 2015 UTC,Well you have to think about how you are going to fit 1000+ BBs in a mag on one spring and then getting those BBs into the mag. Also the spring would have to be ridiculously strong to feed the weight of said BBs. So it just wouldn't work out.
airsoft,3d3agw,MaceRider,2,Mon Jul 13 04:36:49 2015 UTC,"Because there's no way to easily put 2000 rounds into a directly spring-actuated magazine like a typical midcap. Because the spring cannot have excessively tight bends, otherwise it stops working, there is no way to have a realistically sized drum/box mag that holds 500+ rounds.   That being said - most support weapons have a mag of 100-200 rounds at most, which is well within the range of regular midcaps. If you want to run a ""realistic"" capacity, you can easily just run those in your gun, provided it can take M4 or AK-pattern magazines (which is usually the case with drums, less so with belt-fed guns).  It's going to cause a balance issue as well. Everyone has to be running real-cap magazines, otherwise your support gunner will be useless and is essentially just another rifleman, because most M4 and AK midcaps have a capacity of around 120-180 BB's."

ICS flash hider and outer barrel is 14-, however I have no idea what the G&G/ARMY is since my L85a1's flash hider is pinned on in such a way that it's impossible to remove without breaking something.

airsoft,3d0mrj,wilbo-swaggins,3,Mon Jul 13 02:23:22 2015 UTC,"The problem with bull pups is that the trigger has to be in front of the breech. In rs firearms the solution is to have it on a cable or wire, like on the grossa, the bullpup ak. In the sa80 they have the trigger system on a long metal piece stretching back to the breech.  In airsoft however, the triggers are electronic, so no taut wore or metal rod has to extend to the breech but rather an electrical wire has to. You maybe can get the m4a1 with the solid non ris handguard to hold the trigger housing to perform this. Also, this will have a space for the battery. The buffer tube on a rs m4 plays a part in the action I believe but in airsoft it doesn't matter. The only issue I can think of is that you won't easily have optics on it without a stock as your face will be over the breech rather than behind it so you will have to have the scope really far forward."

You can wire them right into the data cable for the Chimera. I used micro deans connectors so that I can unplug the switches and disassemble the guns in the normal fashion.

airsoft,3d2zsr,Catgutt,1 point,Mon Jul 13 03:31:57 2015 UTC,"That'd be nice, but it's wrong. I've had shipments coming from HK and China get seized before when they contained guns, for various reasons. At the same time, my most recent purchase is a WE G17 from WGCShop and it got through without issue. Customs doesn't catch most things, but they definitely try, and that makes it something of a crapshoot.  For the OP, the WE G17 I got shipped with a plastic orange barrel in the gun, and a metal black barrel in the pistol box, so it looks like they come from the factory in this configuration. Customs could still stop it because of Glock trade issues, but with an orange tip it's less likely.  Shipping it to yourself won't change anything, it'll still go through Customs.  So, I'd say go for it, but keep in mind that seizure is a small but real possibility. Pay with Paypal, and if your package gets seized file a dispute before the eligible window elapses."

airsoft,3cz280,Pure_Silver,3,Sun Jul 12 04:40:10 2015 UTC,"Also, owning one, do you think that the rumors of the body being milled from a real AK's body is true? I get a different answer from everyone I ask.   I can give you a definitive answer right now; E&L do not use RS parts in their guns. The most obvious indication of this is that the gun's receiver isn't 1:1; it's Tokyo Marui-specification (about 5mm longer than it should be, IIRC, in order to fit the Version 3 gearbox) which you can readily confirm by trying unsuccessfully to fit a RS top cover. E&L's guns are supposedly made in a real arms plant (either EMEI or Landarms) but they are not made of RS parts.  RealSword's guns are made of RS (Norinco) parts; they are the only true 1:1 Kalashnikov & SVD AEGs in airsoft and have a special custom gearbox in order to fit into the RS receivers. Another key clue is that RealSword's guns are all Chinese guns (Type 56s, Type 85s, Type 97s) that Norinco actually make, hence the ready availability of parts. Nobody in China makes actual Russian AKs; there's no parts for E&L or anyone else to use."
airsoft,3cz280,pygmymath,2,Sun Jul 12 12:00:21 2015 UTC,E&L's guns are supposedly made in a real arms plant (either EMEI or Landarms) but they are not made of RS parts.     I can see here that this is where peoples confusion comes from. I kind of already figured from had handling real steel AK's before that they were indeed not real AK receivers seeing the trouble of modifying one to fit a gearbox and the rest of the guts of an AEG into one would not be worth it.
airsoft,3cz280,ElGatoTheManCat,1 point,Sun Jul 12 23:02:18 2015 UTC,"I'm guessing real steel means that it has the same specs as the real gun? I'm still trying to understand that terminology. It's confusing because my E&L is made of actual steel, but it isn't ""real steel"".  Anyway, thanks for the info! I do remember reading that it isn't 100% replica of a real 74u on a soviet themed airsoft forum."
airsoft,3cz280,Archebanc,3,Sun Jul 12 16:14:10 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's pretty confusing, especially since 'RealSword' also capitalises to 'RS'. 'Real steel' is context-dependent, but usually refers to parts/accessories that were made for real firearms, or (less commonly) to things that are exactly the same dimensions as real firearms.  So, a real AK-47 is 'a real steel AK', a real AK-47 stock is 'a real steel stock' (even though it's made of wood), and an E&L AK-47 isn't 'real steel', even though it is made of real steel.  The key distinction is that E&L don't use real gun parts ('real steel parts') in the construction of their guns, and RealSword do. E&L's guns, like every other airsoft Kalashnikov except RealSword's, are also not true 1:1 replicas of a Kalashnikov; they're slightly longer. RealSword's guns, as above, are 1:1 replicas of a Type 56, which is a Chinese copy of an AKM. As to whether or not your E&L is otherwise identical to a 74U, I don't know - Rus-softers can be very picky about the details."

Why were there guns that were capable of firing within firing distance of people without protection in place, with their muzzle(s) ostensibly flagging people?

When I wear the clear lenses I usually have a hat on (okay, I usually have a hat on anyway, but that's beside the point) to compensate for the extra light hitting my eyes (wearing sunglasses is less of an option and more of a survival mechanism for me)."

Some people suggest shimming it underneath with a cut out credit card. Others use RTV silicone to add onto the top. Personally I let it soak in silicone oil until it swells up and closes the gap, based on the philosophy that it's shrunken from drying out and only needs rehydrating. Careful not to overdo it. You also have the option of ordering a new one from the KWA pro shop, they have inexpensive replacements but you will pay $9 flat rate shipping on top."

Giving you more than enough rounds on the field, and no need for the extra weight and gear.  For me spending more on a gun and getting the cosmetic stuff later is the way to go.    That means you could get a http://www.evike.com/products/39127/ for the same cost almost...  And that makes a spring change to go to the field so much easier"
airsoft,3cz9lf,lizanawow,2,Sun Jul 12 05:04:57 2015 UTC,CQB or Field play?    Also with that gun I would step up from .2 to at least .25's

airsoft,3cz9lf,GnarShredder96,3,Sun Jul 12 03:57:37 2015 UTC,Bit more accuracy and better range. it'll also drop your FPS a little but not your Joules so if your field has Joule limits as opposed to FPS make sure you're within those limits.
airsoft,3cz9lf,lizanawow,1 point,Sun Jul 12 04:06:51 2015 UTC,"Ah ok! FPS limits are 400 FPS around here, or were within the past few years. I think they measure with .2 BBs anyways, so might as well use a lower spring and not risk it by cheating the chrono :/"

Most people can take the parts from most mountable scopes (some scopes have a small piece which both clamps the bottom part of the scope mount, and the rail on the rifle and keeps them both  together,much like a dual female adapter) which, when paired with other parts like a bolt/nut assembly and more adapters, will allow you to functionally do the same as what you hope to achieve.

It's been very reliable, and is efficient enough to guarantee two mags worth of shots before replacing the CO2. There was one day where I found my mags leaking to empty (very slowly and sneakily), but it hasn't happened since.  It will require cleaning and lubrication.  One point of negative interest is that the hammer will grind on the slide when the slide is to the rear- something I've also seen on Elite Force 1911s. There is not enough friction to interfere with normal operation, but if you gently let the slide return, it will halt on it. Not an issue during gameplay.  Ergonomically, it is a very large gun and I can only recommend it to people with big hands, or medium hands that are willing to stretch a little. Getting to the slide release with medium-size hands is what's difficult- you'll have to reach over the thumb safety, which can be awkward. It is a big, rather heavy gun; it's up to you whether or not that's a plus.   If I had to make a general recommendation, I'd say go with a regular P226 rather than the X-Five big brother."

They're Marui-compatible, so you can fit hop-up upgrades and the like if you want to, they'll run in any weather with CO2, and they're good value.  I would definitely get the newer one on Evike rather than the X-Five on AGi. As far as I know, KJW don't make an X-Five, and I think that gun is actually made by a different OEM (KWC or Y&P, probably), not KJW."
airsoft,3cydek,needanacc0unt,1 point,Sat Jul 11 22:44:03 2015 UTC,"I have the first link one, the KJW p226. I've had it since 2011 and love it. I abused it too much, and now that I want to use it in games it is costing me a lot of money to repair it back to normal. I don't really like the paint job, it's glossy and makes the gun feel cheap. My local store had an unlicensed sig 226, the actual KP-01 from KJWorks (not sure how familiar you are with the licensing process they use) and its paint job was amazing. It was a flat black, no markings or writing at all. I really wish I bought that one originally. They only had one I think, it wasn't in the case when I was there last night. So if that sorta thing matters to you, I'd look for that version. KJWorks support is great. They email me back usually the same day (we've exchanged a shit load of emails in the past month ordering parts for mine.)  So yeah, if you don't mind the paint, get it. You will by happy with it, but save yourself the shipping cost and get some fill valve o-rings for the mags when you order. They ship mags with ones that seem not to last.  P.S. I hate to break it to you, but a sale just ended on the 226 on Evike. It was $111.99 last week :("

airsoft,3cvgok,diggnURgrave,1 point,Sat Jul 11 04:04:40 2015 UTC,"Here's a good trick to keep the gearbox from exploding!:  Before you unscrew the gearbox, place a small screwdriver in the hole at the back of the gearbox. (This is only applicable to V2s, as V3s and others usually doesn't have a hole.) Then, unscrew the gearbox, making sure to keep downward pressure on the gb shell. After the gb shell is unscrewed, use the free hand that you now have to hold the screw driver you had previously inserted. Keep inward pressure, and lift the top half of the shell up. Also don't forget to keep the cylinder from popping up. Or, just do it in a gallon Ziploc bag, and it'll only go flying in the bag.  Also, hi, from another mk18 owner."
airsoft,3cxc6k,Ninjaz0mb1e333,3,Sat Jul 11 16:43:45 2015 UTC,GG or PP? How much is left? Technically your not filling a mag but equalizing the pressure between the two tanks. Your fill source might be low.  Could be it's too humid or cold wherever you are. Both are factors.  If it's not gas related I can't help. I'm no tech.

airsoft,3cxc6k,FTAC_Swope,2,Sat Jul 11 17:23:40 2015 UTC,A third full so only 30% is in the can? That's really low. I don't even like to use cans or tanks after there 60% gone. I'll hive then to someone else or something. Wasteful? Maybe. But I'd rather have my mags nice and hot.

airsoft,3cxc6k,NATOMarksman,2,Sat Jul 11 21:47:10 2015 UTC,"17 shots sounds about right. It won't fire more than its normal amount no matter how long you fill it because there is a maximum capacity.    If you want more shots per fill, consider using a CO2 mag."

airsoft,3cxc6k,legacysmash,2,Sat Jul 11 17:32:54 2015 UTC,That's why I never use my Green Gas Mag. 17 sounds about the same as what I get with KJW M1911 MEU with a GG mag. Co2 gets me about 3 double stack mags worth of shots.
airsoft,3cxc6k,MaceRider,2,Sat Jul 11 17:44:07 2015 UTC,"For the skinny mags that most 1911's have, 17 shots is decent, albeit low. I think my WE 1911 can hold about 25 shots worth in one fill. The mag itself can't really hold more than 17 shots, so you're reloading it anyway - just fill with gas at the same time.  Also, you should be OK if you buy a couple extra mags and swap them if you need more than one mag's worth of shots out on the field."

airsoft,3cxc6k,ConorN93,2,Sat Jul 11 22:02:31 2015 UTC,"17 is above aveaverage then. That style of 1911 is derived from the Tokyo Marui design, which is based on a plastic slide and frame. The metal of the KJW and lower tolerances if their manufacturing will make their pistols less efficient, and the magazines for your gun holds very little gas.   If you want more shots than that you will have to buy TM or Knockoff extended magazines for it. When I had the exact same pistol as you, I always loaded my magazines to only 10 rounds because I would rapid fire in burst of 3 or 4, using up my gas quick."

airsoft,3cymrz,Dutchbet,0,Sun Jul 12 03:04:20 2015 UTC,"I highly recommend avoiding A&K LMGs. As for changing the spring, you shouldn't need to take the gearbox out. It should be as simple as removing the stock and opening the feed tray cover. If you do get an A&K, expect to put in some heavy upgrades, and especially replace the hopup unit! That is a must.

Umarex doesn't actually make any replicas, they are a rebrander, so they buy Chinese-made guns at a factory and then put their logo on them.   At a guess, though, I think a gun that was €100 five years ago probably isn't very good. You can probably use it as a starting point, or to learn basic tech work, but you'll likely want a better gun down the line.

You may want to take the gearbox out and take a look at it just to know what it looks like and how it works."
airsoft,3cwryt,taj1994,3,Sat Jul 11 14:05:03 2015 UTC,"From your edit, it could be something that you can field, but don't count on it lasting too long or taking too much abuse before something breaks. But who knows, it could run perfectly fine for years to come with no problem.   Also, I saw the pic of your mag and the BB's inside it, they look like they might be .12g BB's (just a guess from the yellow colour, but that could be the lighting). As a bare minimum, you should use .2g or .25g BB's. Most fields now chronograph with those weights.   I would say use it as much as you can, but keep in mind that you might need to get something new if it breaks, because it might not be worth fixing. That is unless you want to get into working on the gearbox. Which if that's the case, it will be a great opportunity to gain some knowledge on how they work.   Good luck."

According to the Cybergun page that OP linked for this gun, it's shooting 302 FPS using .12s (0.5 Joules), which would be approximately 232 FPS using .2s. If .12 gram BBs weren't such low quality and didn't break easily, I'd personally say to not even bother with anything heavier without upgrading the gun. Lol"

Most tm guns are amazing so hk.45 is a good one, m&ps are decent and I heard great things about the USP compact compared to the kwa one. But if he does like something like a glock, I would recommend something other than TM as while their glocks are good, they aren't as sturdy as the newer TM guns.

See point #1 Lifchik does indeed mean brassiere, and chest rigs of all types were called ""lifchiks"" informally, but that's all it ever was - a nickname. And really, what else are you going to call it? It straps to your chest and has loops going over the shoulders - a typical dude in the 80's Russia never saw anything like that aside from a woman's bra. There were Russian-made chest rigs based on the Chicom design but there were called ПОЯС А/Б (Belt A/B).    P.S. I'm actually Russian so you don't have to translate Russian words for me.

Ive had a GBBP that ive gotten into the habit of cleaning with and grew up around ARs and AKs.  Replacement parts also arent too expensive unless you bite the bullet and go with RA Tech   i personally had the same concern. But im keeping my AEG with me at every game just to have in case of emergency"
airsoft,3cuy2y,Pure_Silver,1 point,Sat Jul 11 02:36:24 2015 UTC,spraying silicon wouldn't do it too much. you need heavier/thicker lube for the bolt and hammer etc.
airsoft,3cuy2y,steinarsen44,1 point,Sat Jul 11 04:12:33 2015 UTC,White lithium grease is what I use for my sidearm  I'll use it on the bolt as well.  Is it the bolt or the bolt carrier that needs it?
airsoft,3cuy2y,Pure_Silver,1 point,Sat Jul 11 04:13:31 2015 UTC,"hmmm.. i dunno what the difference between bolt vs bolt carrier is  but i use the thicker lube mostly on the bolt where it contacts the trigger hammer... it's easier to see where you should apply it after a few mags. you'll see wear marks (the top coating wears off, exposing the shiny metal underneath) and thats where I apply the lube.  i use silicon spray for the nozzle inside the bolt carrier. to lube the oring seals.  i just played an indoor game today... and it was running smooth until the end, it started to jam. lubed it up and it was running good again."

airsoft,3cwxn1,Vorpalbunnie,1 point,Sat Jul 11 14:28:29 2015 UTC,"How would you know when the gas stops, do you have to listen out for a hissing sound or something? Whenever I fill my mags it is pretty much silent the whole time."
airsoft,3cwxn1,Pure_Silver,2,Sat Jul 11 14:56:38 2015 UTC,"It depends on the type of fill valve you have. If you have venting (non-'silent fill'; that is, the valve hisses while filling) valves you'll know when it's full because liquid will begin to spit at you from the valve. If you have non-venting ('silent-fill'; that is, the valve doesn't make much if any noise while filling) valves it's harder to tell, so for a typical pistol magazine just count to 10."
airsoft,3cwxn1,MaceRider,2,Sat Jul 11 15:41:58 2015 UTC,Listen more closely. You can typically hear a dull PSHHHH as the mag fills that then stops when it's full.
airsoft,3cwxn1,stevewmn,1 point,Sat Jul 11 15:49:05 2015 UTC,"All of this is easily drowned out in a busy CQB staging area. So it's probably best to test out how your mags fill at home where it's quiet, counting off as you do to get a sense for how long you'll need to count in a noisy room."

airsoft,3cxjk4,MaceRider,1 point,Sat Jul 11 17:53:28 2015 UTC,I'll give that a shot. Can I get a new seal from any airsoft place? Or is there some place that's better than another?
airsoft,3cxjk4,Stevenm56,1 point,Sat Jul 11 18:52:16 2015 UTC,"You should be able to get the seal anywhere Airsoft shit is sold, even my crappy store has seals and repair kits for sale.  You may not be able to find the seal for SOCOM Gear specifically, but it's likely the magazine is compatible with one of a few different large manufacturer's guns - almost nobody develops new shit for Airsoft, everyone just copies Tokyo Marui (mostly)."
airsoft,3cxjk4,Stevenm56,1 point,Sat Jul 11 19:24:07 2015 UTC,This my sound like a silly question but are you keeping gas in the mag when you're not using it? If you're not then that's probably your problem....

airsoft,3cxh7f,tokke,4,Sat Jul 11 17:27:17 2015 UTC,"Nothing is wrong with lithium polymer batteries, as you're no doubt aware they've been used in RC hobbies for years, airsoft is just behind the curve. The two main reasons why people warn against lipos are that they are more susceptible to containment failure (ie battery fires) when impacted or punctured, and because of their small size people get tempted to put a 11.1V in a gun not suited for it and start breaking internal parts left and right. Use a 7.4V, which will give you comparable performance to a decent 9.6V NiMh pack, and you have nothing to worry about."

Also, /u/Kozio_ and /u/datguyfromoverdere make pretty good points.  Based on the dodgy details of your post, it honestly sounds like you bought a garbage gun and then took the worst possible route you could to alleviate the problem.  My recommendations for you:   Don't buy essentials from Airsplat and don't buy things from them that you need quickly.  I buy parts and accessories from them all the time, and they're usually great.  Sometimes things are back ordered, but whatever.  I can wait. Don't buy crappy guns just because they're on sale. Get acquainted with a tech at one of your local fields.  Find someone you can get to know personally that you would actually trust with your guns.  The tech services offered by most airsoft retailers is basically just there to take your money.  Don't use it. If you receive a broken gun and it can't be fixed by putting in a new fuse, return it.  Don't ask them to fix it.  Buy something else.  It's not worth the hassle."

airsoft,3cvjr8,datguyfromoverdere,4,Sat Jul 11 06:44:03 2015 UTC,"Yes and no. I don't have much sympathy for people that buy shitty guns either, but at the same time, if it was ""most likely a few easy fixes"" then Airsplat's technician(s) should have been able to fix it quickly. Telling /u/ThatGuyFroMiami that he could probably have fixed it himself may not be much use if (a) he's one of those radical lunatics that thinks a brand new product should probably work as described, or (b) if he tries to fix the gun himself, Airsplat will void whatever guarantee they offered with the gun.  OP, we need to know what make and model of gun before we can pass judgement on how you and Airsplat handled this.  Also, thank you for the reminder of why I love living somewhere that has strong consumer protection laws and mandatory warranty rules."
airsoft,3cvjr8,Pure_Silver,3,Sat Jul 11 11:04:43 2015 UTC,"When I deal with these issues at work, 70% of the time it's an easy fix like a loose screw etc. I agree that a new Airsoft gun should work when being sold BUT keep in mind these are children's toys made in Asia. Stuff happens and the cheaper you buy the more issues you will run into.  That's why I always recommend buying in person, you can try it out to make sure everything works.   I don't put too much stock in airsplat techs, they must have to deal with a TON of guns each day and will miss things. That's really not their fault.   In this case, the jamming is most likely a bad hopup bucking or bad bbs. Op didn't say what brand the gun and bbs where so it could be either.   The blowback doesn't work? Good it'll just break your gun anyway.  The battery issue sounds like the shrink wrap broke, was probably a clear plastic type. Those can get old and brittle.   The spring guide for the dust cover, loose grub screw that holds it in place?  I'd have to see a pic."

They aren't going to steal your money and move out of the country, however they have been known to substitute items for out of stock items, back order items hanging in limbo for a long time and then refund your money when they can't get the item months later - that sort of thing.

airsoft,3cw326,needanacc0unt,1 point,Sat Jul 11 14:34:54 2015 UTC,"I think the only really big problem is with their backorder policy. They tend to list guns that they have available to order from overseas. I tried to order a CYMA Galil when I was just getting into Airsoft. I waited a week with no tracking then called to find out they were just trying to order it from overseas and it might take up to 7 weeks to get to me.   So just keep that in mind. The TM your ordering might not be at their US based warehouse, but might be available from a distributor in Asia. Their prices seem to be consistent with this as they are usually what an Asian retailer might have plus shipping."

If it's nightly, change your route and see if you cant see where the kid is or what he looks like. If you can get it down to that, then you can figure out where he lives and confront the parents. And instead of being that angry adult, instead mention that you've noticed the kid likes Airsoft and if he'd like to come to a field and explain the sport. If all goes well, or even bad and the parents go apeshit helicopter on ya, mention the reason you offered to introduce the sport to him.   That way, in the good way the kid learns about the sport and hopefully stops shooting people. In the bad way, that fucking gun is out of his hands, cause if it were me I drive with my fucking window down so that could easily get me in the fucking eye and I would not even be a rational adult at that point and that gun would be in pieces over my knee and his legs."

airsoft,3ctbrc,SovietFishGun,14,Fri Jul 10 18:50:38 2015 UTC,"If there's no damage, it's hard to make a case, and since it's at night, it'd be hard to make a clear ID.  Bring a handheld spotlight and a camcorder/camera capable of true 1080p with you. Next time it happens, light him up and record it. When you get home, edit the video and try to blow up the section with him in it.   I would strongly recommend against trying to shoot back at him, as it would be equally illegal use of an airsoft gun (in public, against unprotected people) and would make it impossible for you to take action against him. Additionally, if you cause serious harm or otherwise hurt him without taking hits yourself, he could accuse YOU of being the hooligan, and since he knows where your house is, he could have the police called on you, and they will definitely find your airsoft guns.   Confronting him would also be a bad option because he might do something stupid like pull out a knife or air pistol capable of doing serious damage.   I would also try canvassing the area to see if anyone else has been shot at with an airsoft gun or if they have kids who have airsoft guns. It seems very unusual if you are the only person being shot at, especially since they bothered to shoot at your house too.   If you are the only person being shot at, consider making a non-emergency call to the police to report any future incidents and put it on the record that you are being harassed. If they assign a unit to your neighborhood and they still do something stupid, they'll win their prize for being stupid.   It's hard to deal with situations like this because there is no visible or actual property damage, the suspect has a ready means of escaping beyond visual identification, there's no way to trace a gun to the BBs fired (since he's probably using cheap Crosman BBs from Walmart), and their parents can protect them from any consequences or further investigation if they so chose (which they probably will, since you're some random 16 year old who owns his own airsoft guns). If visual ID doesn't work you might just have to deal with it until something bad happens from their harassment (i.e physical or property damage). Which sucks, but there's not really much else to do."

airsoft,3cw8sj,pilows,2,Sat Jul 11 08:21:05 2015 UTC,if you have airsoft guns that arnt springers let them play with those first to see if they like it and then get them to buy guns like yours (unlesss its super expensive). im sure theyd want a competitive gun like an AEG and not a springer
airsoft,3cw8sj,hnfr,2,Sat Jul 11 10:05:01 2015 UTC,"Good gun for a beginner eh?   I wouldn't start on a springer, go for a low level AEG like the time tested and surprisingly good for price point CYMA AK's.

The springs do get trashed for some reason, although I have no idea why. It hasn't happened to me though.  Definitely file the bolt catch a bit. Just round out the edges and remove the paint (the paint just rubs off and makes things dirtier anyway). Keep it lubed very well, like I clean it after every gaming day. It cycles beautifully that way every time for me. The bop up gets a bit wonky for me as well, but keeping silicone oil away from it will keep it shooting straight."

airsoft,3cvimp,plagueofunicorns,2,Sat Jul 11 07:35:08 2015 UTC,"I'll second this.   I actually have an old CA SL8 and you can technically even put a G36C length inner barrel in it. Only thing is that there's going to be a lot of space after the barrel ends, but it's still inside the outer barrel. That could potentially throw off your accuracy if the BB hits the inside of the outer barrel before it completely exits the gun.   OP's idea of just using a G36K outer barrel is a good fix for this since it will cut down on the overall length and have less room to have the BB make contact inside the outer barrel."

airsoft,3cvfet,fearismybaconbits,2,Sat Jul 11 02:36:25 2015 UTC,"I have a DYE i4 and I have very little trouble aiming down the sights even without a rail riser.

Great mask and aiming down sights is pretty easy, not as easy as some other mask I have.

I also have a red dot optic that I can aim down pretty good. A riser would make it slightly more comfortable however it isn't needed.   The flexible cheek guards on the DYE i4 mask are made to be pressed up against a gun and flex a little to allow for better aiming. They aren't like some mask that offer no flexibility (which I have used and hated before)."
airsoft,3cvfet,SuprDrummy,1 point,Sat Jul 11 03:38:36 2015 UTC,"I agree and have had similar experience with the mask. To add on, it depends what type of stock your gun has (assuming it's an AR, if not, then depending on the gun itself).  My full stock m16 makes me angle my head a little bit to use irons. My retractable stock on an m4 gives me no trouble when using irons. These are both without any modification to the mask.   I highly recommend getting one!"
airsoft,3cvfet,someguyfromnz,2,Mon Jul 13 00:02:02 2015 UTC,"It depends on the gun and sight combo.   Red dots:  With M4s, I normally use a 1/2"" riser on an Eotech, nothing on an Aimpoint M2/M4, a 1"" riser on a typical RDS. On a H&K gun (MP5/G3 style) I use no riser, but use a look through riser claw mount (which gives about a 1"" rise). On an MP5/G3 with a sliding stock you can use a low claw mount as your cheek goes where the stock rails are, so your head is lower. T1s are always a good choice, as they're readily available with quick release high rise mounts. My new favourite is the ELCAN Spectre with a mini RDS. Sure I'm just using the ELCAN as an expensive riser mount, but they look pretty pimp.  Irons:  Those flip up style irons are fine, so are the M16 carry handle style. MP5/G3s are fine with sliding stocks (and not tooo bad with fixed stocks). AKs with M4 buffer tube style stocks are fine, but haven't tried with an AK wood stock so not sure about those.   Only 1 in 10 of my guns has irons (or rather, doesn't have a red dot)... I find quick acquisition to be superior with an RDS.  You won't regret the Dye i4, it is basically ideal for airsoft.  One other thing... the Eotechs aren't particularly good. A big reticile just blocks more of your vision than a dot would... would be sweet if they made a model that didn't mimic the real thing, and just had a nice sharp tiny little dot. I know everyone wants one cause muh seal team 6, but there are definitely better options for airsoft."

In terms of target acquisition you want to know that if you're zeroed in you can quickly can hit the target being pointed at w the reticle. Knockoffs simply aren't bright enough in the daylight. I noticed during drills it takes a second or two for your eye to acquire the dot to confirm its on-target or if you need to adjust.

airsoft,3ctsgk,MaceRider,1 point,Fri Jul 10 20:00:30 2015 UTC,"Sadly there is not a metal version of the m14 hop up chamber so that is out. And If you get a new barrel, m14s are proprietary, so you'll need an ""m14 barrel"" which can be hard to find. But you can still flat hop it. As far as GB parts, depending on what FPS you want ~m130 spring, the stock motor is not impressive, definitely o-ring nozzle(proprietary), spring guide (proprietary), piston head, piston if you feel so inclined, the cylinder head is so-so(proprietary).  This goes for anything but a lipo, deans, shimming, and motor height all add up.

airsoft,3ct9z0,Avonyx,3,Fri Jul 10 16:25:15 2015 UTC,"Know your field. Know where the choke points and alternate paths are. Also shoot and move helps. Bounding from cover to cover with a teammate while using cover fire works well. Knowing your field also helps with this a little bit. Most experienced players will shoot from behind cover. Look for heads poking around corners and such. Try to familiarize yourself with your teammates. Not much help here.  Psychology plays a bigger role in the game than I initially thought too. I'm not a big guy (5'9""), so I can't offer too much help there. Make sure whoever you're running with keeps in contact with you and the rest of the squad. That means eyes/ears on teammates as well as the field. I think radios are a little silly for smaller fields too. I wear glasses and have had good luck with these ESS goggles. I just rip off the foam around the seal. Then I cut out two slits for my eyeglass ear pieces on the side. No problems with fogging or issues with glasses being pushed around.   Hope this helps. Most important thing to do is have fun and don't take things too seriously. For what is essentially LARPing with guns, people sure do get butthurt a lot."
airsoft,3ct9z0,BravoKilo1,2,Fri Jul 10 16:57:13 2015 UTC,"First Item:  This is going to happen every time, especially in an indoor CQB place.  If you don't take the initiative the enemy will.  Second Item:  A mix of general inexperience, lack of perception and a lack of map knowledge.  It will probably get better.  Third Item:  Friendly fire is always an issue, especially indoors.  If it's a single arm band that kind of blows. Best option is to try to pay attention to the body language and where they are focused.  Most of the time if someone seems like they're being sneaky, and not minding angles facing you, they're friendly.  But yeah, most of the time it's really unclear indoors because everyone looks pretty similar, and they're set up like mazes so you can't really keep track of how far up your team is.  Fourth Item:  Make sure your kneepads are tightened and adjusted properly, and that you're not using shitty ones.  Good kneepads make a world of difference.   Fifth Item: Communication indoors is hard because it's loud and small and echo-ey.  Hand signals will probably work but don't like over do it, especially if you're trying to communicate outside your group.  99% of people are going to have no idea what anything other than a raised fist or pointing at something then flashing numbers with your hands means.  I think Revisions with prescription inserts and rip the foam out of the top would be your best bet.  But I don't wear glasses, so grain of salt."

airsoft,3ct88n,Sankarrr,2,Fri Jul 10 16:15:36 2015 UTC,"I spent months trying to figure out which MP5 replica has the most realistic externals.  I came to conclusion that the VFC MP5s (either Japan or Asia editions) are the best you can get realism wise.  Here's mine.   The CA and ICS come close, but the VFCs sold overseas are the only ones that look exactly like the real thing.  Here's why:  -The receivers are stamped steel with proper fake weld marks and you can see that the metal was molded into shape rather than die-cast or machine cut.  Some airsoft receivers look too ""perfect"" but the VFC asia/japan editions get this right.  The CA does not have the front cocking tube section as one piece with the rest of the upper receiver and you can see it some picture that it kinda droops down.  Its the same story with the US version of the VFC, which they say is stamped steel but are actually die cast and looks too ""perfect"".  The only other airsoft receivers that get this right are the ICS MX5 pro split gearbox models, but they don't get the color quite right.  They are a dull dark grey rather than the glossy black on the HK.  Also the ICS's grip is slightly off.  Which brings me to the next point  -The lower is only correct on the VFC.  Some other brands like ICS have the pictogram markings engraved and painted while the VFC has it correctly painted on, not engraved.  The VFC also gets the grip right, keeping it slim.  Every other brand has the grip bulge to accomodate the aeg motor, but I guess VFC worked around that like they did for the HK416.  The Systema also gets this right but the paint they used for the pictograms is just slightly too bright, and the nylon fiber they made the plastic furniture out of looks a little rougher than the real HK grip  Overall, the VFC nails all the little details, which is I'm sure one of the benefits of Umarex having unparalleled access to HK for R&D.  However, this is only if you buy the Asia or Japan versions (not the die-cast ones), which are a little pricier and will cost you an extra $80 in shipping, but then again they're the only ones where you could probably put it next to real thing and have a hard time telling the difference."

airsoft,3ct88n,dabluebunny,1 point,Fri Jul 10 17:22:04 2015 UTC,"lol yea sorry if it came across as a little wordy.  Plus I just looked after I wrote all of that and  realized the asia editions are out of stock everywhere, making all of that a bit moot.  Even still I think the US versions, even tho they use an unrealistc handguard on the A5 and have an umarex legalese blurb on the side, have better quality receivers and externals than the aging CA, which have been in production since frosted tips were still a thing.  I can tell you from personal experience that the 3 rnd burst is a gimmick.  The 3 rnd thing is just a ""suggestion"" on mine and it just shoots 4 or 7 shots or goes full auto.  Trigger response is also crap but I guess since you're gutting it, it doesn't make a difference.  Hope that helps, good luck!"

The reason the mag is venting is after a few shots go through the mag, it gets cold and the valve sticks open, causing problems."

airsoft,3cs3so,Catbrain,2,Fri Jul 10 22:10:16 2015 UTC,"Cheapest shipping will be like $15-ish. More expensive shipping options like EMS Express depend highly on weight, so the lighter the box, the cheaper it will be. With that in mind, for $50-$75-$100 I can probably get you a nice and lightweight mystery box that's full of stuff, but still sub 2 kilograms and so will only be like $25-ish to ship with EMS Express.   Obviously if you want something large like a pair of boots or whatnot, it'll end up expensive-ish to ship EMS. The box I sent to /u/David_Trest was almost 7 kg and ended up costing around $60 for EMS shipping, but he did order a lot of stuff, like a pair of boots, a large backpack, and some shirts and gloves I think."
airsoft,3cs3so,David_Trest,2,Sat Jul 11 08:34:07 2015 UTC,"Also keep in mind that I'm in Texas too. So the shipping is about the same. I did get a big, heavy box. Smaller, lighter boxes will be less.

airsoft,3csxph,Kozio_,1 point,Fri Jul 10 16:27:05 2015 UTC,"The reason for the down votes is that barrel length  does not correspond to more accuracy in airsoft. What matters is stabilizing a bb in the barrel, with the correct air volume. Sometimes a longer barrel helps sometimes a shorter barrel helps, but its not the barrel its the air volume that makes it accurate."
airsoft,3csxph,chillyrabbit,1 point,Sat Jul 11 04:23:00 2015 UTC,"Ok, edgi (just as an example) barrels are designed so they start as wide bore and go down to whatever size you want from there. Say you're wanting a 6.03mm barrel and can't decide on a 300mm or, idk, a 350mm long barrel. Well logic says that if the barrels are made the exact same way and end up becoming the same bore at the end, the longer barrel will be more accurate. Why? Because more mm means more time for a bb to be ""stabilized"". I would honestly love to know of a case where this logic is wrong that isn't based on the different designs of barrels, a prommy will perform different than an action army, duh...   If I come off as a uppity know it all, I'm not trying to be. Just stating my reasoning for why I believe longer barrels are better than short. If I am wrong, then please correct me"
airsoft,3csxph,Kozio_,1 point,Sat Jul 11 04:36:36 2015 UTC,"Well if you don't have enough air volume for a longer barrel you have the risk of the bb becoming unstabilized because it is in the barrel so long. This is where I got my information specifically the barrel.  What it says is that if you stabilize a bb after 7 inches of barrel, if it still has another 12 inches to go it can destabilize after it stabilizes.   Specifically this is only for AEG's."

airsoft,3csxph,Kozio_,1 point,Sat Jul 11 18:16:13 2015 UTC,"yup, so it could make it more accurate but you have to understand the physics of it. A shorter barrel could also make it more accurate."

airsoft,3csxph,Lordmonocrona,-3,Fri Jul 10 15:20:24 2015 UTC,If you replaced the barrel with the same bore (keeping it stock bore for example) then accuracy would be relatively unchanged but if the bore went wider the accuracy may suffer so try and get the new barrel at 6.03 or lower

airsoft,3cqikm,ElGatoTheManCat,1 point,Fri Jul 10 13:56:16 2015 UTC,"Thank you very much. What I was going for was a 40mm chamber to hold the grenade, with the barrel further up tapering down to 20mm, to tighten the spread, if that even works on airsoft grenades, heh. Then to make it break action, I was going to have the barrel sleep de forward on system similar to that used in drawers, just a few inches before it stops so that I could eject and reload another she'll, then pull it back and secure it with a latch. Not sure of the viability is to this, but I feel like it would just be fun to work on."
airsoft,3cqikm,c0mplicated,1 point,Fri Jul 10 14:21:42 2015 UTC,"Narrowing the barrel down with 40mm shells isn't going to yield you good results at all. Rather than the bbs simple moving closer together as you'd assume, they have a tendency to bounce around as they travel down the barrel, drastically decreasing your range. You'd be better off keeping the barrel the same diameter the whole way or, if you really want a more unique grenade launcher, look into a pump action style system with a large bore barrel"
airsoft,3cqikm,Catgutt,2,Sat Jul 11 06:12:50 2015 UTC,"At 40mm you're reaching more into light anti-tank gun territory, and the very limited range on airsoft grenades could make it difficult to be effective. Just building what is essentially an oversized M79 does not sound like a viable plan.  However, I think you have a couple of options here.   Chamber it in 40mm, but don't use 40mm grenades. Use a CO2 or HPA constant-air setup to build a simple cannon. It won't be much harder than building it to load and fire 40mms, and there are plenty of resources online. This way you get variable power and ammo flexibility, and can use sabots to extend your effective range. Build it with a smaller-than-40mm barrel, and use the 'multipurpose' 40mm grenades (example) for power. That hole is roughly 20mm, so if you use a 20mm barrel and a wad behind the BBs (cotton balls work pretty well) then you can get a LOT better power and range, not to mention a tighter spread, than with a 40mm barrel.   Either of those will work much more effectively. You may be able to get some inspiration from a bolt-action grenade launcher build someone I know was working on a few years ago."
airsoft,3cqikm,Catgutt,1 point,Fri Jul 10 12:37:34 2015 UTC,"Thank you, I would probably go with option two, because I would have no idea how to set up a hpa"
airsoft,3cqikm,Thatoneguywhofailed,1 point,Fri Jul 10 14:45:11 2015 UTC,"It's really not something to be intimidated by, especially with all the resources out there on the Internet. What you're looking at is essentially an external-air spud gun or paintball cannon- you can build a really simple one with two valves and a hose fitting. Really, the more complicated part is building and loading sabots, but as far as propulsion systems go an external CO2 or HPA tank is a lot more efficient and effective than relying on 40mm grenade cartridges."

airsoft,3cqikm,geckos100,3,Fri Jul 10 15:06:06 2015 UTC,I've wanted to do this for a long time. I'd personally start with a GL-06 and add a 2-4 ft PVC pipe over the barrel to extend it. Rig a wooden stock to it and a scope on top. I believe G&P makes a long range grenade shell that can get to ranges of 100+ ft.

So everyone is gathered around the entrance to one of the maps which happens to be right next to the entrance road for the field. This black truck comes down the road with this dog in the back the truck stops right in front of everyone when the guy comes out and is looking frantically at for something when he just starts bawling. He hadn't realized until just now that his other dog was being dragged behind his truck for who knows how long. He start then to scream at the motionless dog in Spanish for a good 2 minutes before the ref tells him to get the dog to the hospital. At this point he is just complete out of touch with reality and continues to scream at the dog for another 5 mins. Now he is starting to really scare all of us and we get all the young players behind us as he seems like he might lash out and hurt someone. Then the dog comes back from the dead and this guy just loses it. He starts crying again and gets his dog and leaves and we don't see him for the rest of the day. Weirdest thing that happened so far in my airsoft experience. Tl:dr Some guy almost kills his dog an accident by dragging it behind car. Almost loses it. Dog becomes zombie. All is good.

airsoft,3cqnxa,Ruschnav,6,Sat Jul 11 01:28:09 2015 UTC,"Mags and pouches (decent quality pouches at least) usually tend to have a better resale value than gats because with an AEG so many things can go wrong. Piston, bucking, compression issues, wiring, contacts, etc. So many different things can go wrong. With mags and pouches they are very simple and less can go wrong with them.  Also rare guns/limited run gats usually keep their value a lot better because of their rarity."

airsoft,3cqnxa,Pure_Silver,2,Fri Jul 10 01:27:28 2015 UTC,Most airsoft guns have horrible resale values IME. The influx of dirt cheap CYMAs and Combat Machines means that people would rather pay ~$125 for a brand new gun than $100 for a used one even if that gun was $200 new. IME your average AEG now has to drop below 50% of its new value before you can sell it easily; GBBRs are even worse.

airsoft,3cqnxa,MaceRider,1 point,Fri Jul 10 13:21:12 2015 UTC,"Anything that is easily available is a bad choice in terms of resale value.

airsoft,3cq3k8,fortehz,6,Thu Jul 9 23:03:49 2015 UTC,"I play outdoors and there is a lot of brush in some places, which makes going prone useful especially if there is no barricades nearby."
airsoft,3cq3k8,dot_executable,3,Fri Jul 10 02:15:31 2015 UTC,"Lying on your belly matters during scenario games where the event actually lasts long enough for the primary advantage of going prone (minimizing contrast with the scenery) to matter.   In a pick up game, the rounds are usually set at 5-15 minutes and cannot exceed that if they cannot find you; it's simply called off, for the sake of the other players. The field itself is also usually designed to maximize other players' ability to find and shoot at you for that reason, so you would have to keep moving even if you only wanted to stay out of sight.   In a scenario game, you have time and the square footage to actually set up an ambush, and the objective may require you to defend a point against attackers who have the low ground; from the high ground, it'd make the most sense to go prone to keep your superior position hidden while also not expending too much effort to take aim."

airsoft,3cqis1,datguyfromoverdere,2,Fri Jul 10 03:54:20 2015 UTC,what do you need to see? If you're familiar with the PPSh the barrel swings down and reveals the top of the gearbox and the bolt.   That's about as far as I've taken this thing down.
airsoft,3cqis1,datguyfromoverdere,1 point,Fri Jul 10 04:10:37 2015 UTC,A pic of the top of the gearbox should do.

airsoft,3cqis1,c4bb0ose,1 point,Fri Jul 10 05:01:02 2015 UTC,The part in question will still be there riding behind the bolt if you remove the nub that pulls the dust cover back.  I'd just leave it or have a pro remove it.
airsoft,3crrdl,mobius1022,2,Fri Jul 10 06:26:28 2015 UTC,"The Ares is just like the AM-013, with a shorter handrail and $20 more. It has a built in electronic trigger system that can switch the firing mode from safe-semi-auto to safe-burst-auto, safe-semi-burst, or safe-semi-semi. (You'll need to buy the ETS box to do that). This means that it's 11.1 lipo ready. However, the biggest downside is finding a battery that'll fit. The stock battery compartment is tiny; your standard small tamiya type battery won't even fit in there.   I have to use a 1300 mah 11.1 lipo and rewire the connector because it was meant for RC. Overall though I love it.   I would've gotten the version you posted but it wasn't available in America when I ordered mine.   Edit: here's the battery.   If you go this path I'd recommend rewiring your gun and the battery to deans because it's more efficient and because SKYRC lipo balancers don't come with tamiya heads, but they do come with dean heads. If you want to rewire you can buy the connectors and heatshrink from the same website as the battery and get your shopping done in one stop. All you'll need from that point is solder and an iron.   Edit 2: if you're willing to drop $350 then I'd definitely recommend the G&P Sentry. Evike has it on sale for $297 instead of $350 and you can never go wrong with their internals/externals. Its look is also one of my favorite M4-type looks (after the honey badger and the 416)."
airsoft,3crrdl,Quachyyy,1 point,Fri Jul 10 08:31:18 2015 UTC,"Huh thats weird that they would make a battery compartment that doesn't fit any normal airsoft battery. I took a glance at the specs and saw you were right, the barrels are the same length so I guess Ill cross that off the list for now. Shame as it seemed like a nice one to have too, but I'll definitely save the info for later in case I ever decide to try out standard rifles. Also the Sentry looks nice but just isn't really my taste though I'm sure it performs great. Actually now that i think about it, that battery might fight if I go with the Krytac, but again warranty (their tech department really despises ANY sort of internal custom work apparently)."

I've got the M4MP5G36AK47 pistol on a semi only field and with a 7.4 stuck under that top rail I can easily go two days of games with it. Light, reasonably accurate but loud as fuck. Another guy at my field has the AM-013 but had the green chip, so when he was in his 'make fun of HPA' phase of carrying a massive battery on his back to connect all his AEGs and AEPs to, he burnt the contacts out and had to change that up. Now that its fixed and runs off its own battery, it works fine."

airsoft,3crrdl,violent_by_design,1 point,Fri Jul 10 13:44:31 2015 UTC,I'm not so sure about the happy part. I sent in my Krytac LMG in to get fixed and they weren't the most cooperative. They accused me of modifying my gun and cutting the wires when I hadn't done anything to it and was running it completely stock. I even made sure that I wasn't using a lipo and used a 9.6 nimh crane stock type battery. The only two things I did to it were remove the non functiong boltcatch (to allow easier access to the inner barrel to clean. Still have it in my gun bag) and accidently broke off the top half of the flash hider (Slipped on some mud and ended up almost cracking up my head against a crate as well as the flash hider). The only reason they ended up fixing it was because it was in warranty and my local store had a tech basic lookover and didn't see anything immediately wrong besides the flash hider so they ended up emailing Krytac as well.

airsoft,3cpriw,Kozio_,1 point,Fri Jul 10 01:08:36 2015 UTC,"I'm just making a assumption based on what I saw in the disassembly video, but it looks like you should be able to position the battery in a way that forces the wiring harness into the shroud. Chafing around the shroud holes would be a concern but that's the way its routed. As long as you don't force the wiring in there and break any solder joints or crimp the wiring you should be fine.  How bad is the wiring sticking out? It looks like a tiny bit will always be visible based on the location of the grip on the rail."
airsoft,3cpriw,Kyeld,1 point,Fri Jul 10 01:17:06 2015 UTC,"Maybe about half the grips length of wire sticking out, I'll try getting some of the wire into the shroud for more space in the grip.

MOSFETS can be a little temperamental with too high of temperatures.  If you held the solder too long it's quite possible it burned it out.

airsoft,3cojjt,NATOMarksman,3,Fri Jul 10 15:54:34 2015 UTC,"It's basically a monolith with a point at the top. I probably wouldn't bother because it relies a lot on having a repeatable zero (hence the point), and because cheap sights have large reticles that are imprecise.   Since airsofters holdover a lot due to BBs arcing visibly over comparatively short distances, it's pretty impractical. Pair that with the 1"" eye relief (which is stupid short for any optic) and the relatively high magnification for airsoft, and you're going to have a bad time.   EDIT  The reason why 1""/25mm eye relief is bad news is because that's the distance your eye needs to be at (plus or minus a few mms) in order to actually use the sight. Further or closer, you won't see anything at all through it. I'd bet money that your eye protection will put your eye at least 2"" away from any sight, if not more, which would make it an expensive paperweight that would be no better than having no sights at all."

Like others have said, the single post or obelisk makes any hold-over shots hard to see where they hit and at least the matrix SUSAT makes my L85 heavier than most SAW's out there.   If you want the looks and the authenticity of an obelisk style optic, the Matrix one has been pretty good for me, but if you're trying to be more practical (or modern British military look) I'd go with an ACOG replica where you have a better field of view and you can see under your point of aim."

airsoft,3cqlpz,Automobilie,1 point,Fri Jul 10 02:32:17 2015 UTC,"A larger battery is a must for this gun IMO, because having the magazine motor on the same circuit significantly increases the current draw compared to other AEGs. A higher mAh-rated battery with the same C-rating will give you proportionally higher maximum current, which will increase rate of fire if your battery is being choked out.  A two-cell lipo will give you a solid rate of fire (consider replacing the motor- the stock one is pretty awful) without risking damage, and should have no problem fitting in the box.  As carbacca said, don't worry about leaving it on auto-wind, and definitely strip out the stupid power-wasting potentiometer ROF adjuster."

I don't know much about ICS but it seems that they're blow for blow as good as G&G, they only thing that puts me off is the difference of internals. I won't be doing much inside the gearbox, only ensuring that I'm not breaching the 350fps site limit, so it's design is not much use to me.   If you don't like the proprietary parts in an ICS M4/M16 AEG, then be aware that the G&G TR16A3 also has proprietary parts due some of the cosmetic features such as the pneumatic-blowback and fake bolt-catch functions."

airsoft,3covfd,OGPancakewasd,1 point,Thu Jul 9 16:28:49 2015 UTC,"ICS all the way. You may not plan to get in the gearbox much, but when you have a broken pistol or need a spring change the split gearbox makes it cake."
airsoft,3covfd,Pure_Silver,1 point,Thu Jul 9 16:45:18 2015 UTC,"Does it perform as well though?  I'm not afraid to open stuff up to fix it, I'm just indifferent to the split gearbox because I won't use it.  I'd rather have the extra performance than convenience.  However if it is a performer then it's always nice to have my cake and eat it..."
airsoft,3covfd,Pure_Silver,2,Thu Jul 9 17:05:27 2015 UTC,"They perform great. Great internals. You will find some people that have  beverage needed to open the bottom gearbox on years. The split gearbox is not weaker than a single peice, but it is lot easier to fix when something breaks. I can change a spring or piston in 5 minutes.

airsoft,3cpli3,NogaDanish,5,Thu Jul 9 19:29:44 2015 UTC,"The internals on sportlines are way cheaper. Their motors are notoriously horrible and die after a few months. Their gears are brittle and weak, usually end up stripping on anything stronger than an M110 in a matter of days. One thing they have in common however, is weak pistons. The piston won't be great on either product. The externals are cheaper too. The Sportline's rails are literally made of plastic, and the lower receiver is rather poor quality plastic you'd see on a Cyma CM028. In comparison, the rails on the Proline are full metal aluminum and the polymer on the lower receiver has a bit of fiberglass in them. They feel like the polymer on real steel Magpul parts. Lastly, the Proline 7mm bushings are pretty alright, and the Sportline lacks these.  Oh, I forgot to mention. The gas block on the Sportline is highly unrealistic to the real steel SCAR, while the Proline's gas block can be adjusted and stuff like the read deal."
airsoft,3cpli3,luckydude4,3,Thu Jul 9 19:46:06 2015 UTC,"The Sportline model has cheaper internals for sure, standard Sportline type (such as blue plastic bushings, blue plastic spring guide, blue inner barrel & cylinder, etc...) and a terribly weak motor that is somehow labelled High Torque.  I think the upper receiver and rails are both made of plastic as opposed to being metal like the Proline has."
airsoft,3cpli3,omgalbert3,1 point,Thu Jul 9 19:57:40 2015 UTC,"Are you sure about some of that because I have opened the sportline gearbox and the only thin I noticed (besides the motor) was a blue cylinder, blue inner barrel, and a polycarbon piston.

airsoft,3cpli3,omgalbert3,1 point,Thu Jul 9 21:41:46 2015 UTC,Classic Army sportline models historically have had blue plastic bushing.  can't remember the spring guide but pretty sure it was plastic too.  Edit correction by /u/artist508 's comment.  Some parts different.

airsoft,3cnkut,SugaSwish,8,Thu Jul 9 08:12:37 2015 UTC,"Me and my friends played in a park once when we were in high school almost 10 years ago, in a place we thought was secluded. It was to be our introduction to the sport. Park police came, at gunpoint, we were detained, guns confiscated, mandatory counseling, parental grief. Don't be fucking stupid like that. We could have been shot or been given more serious penalties that may have remained on record. Play in sanctioned or private locations with healthy buffer zones.  But it didn't dampen our spirits! We just decided to get less stupid. We started going to fields and getting serious about safety. Most of us have kept on playing the sport and we still aim to play at least once a month."
airsoft,3cnkut,OnwardsMrSnippy,5,Thu Jul 9 09:04:42 2015 UTC,"This is a story from my friends.     There used to be an abandoned trailer in a lot next to a fairly busy two-lane road. It had waist-high grass, tons of cover, and the trailer in the middle of the lot was busted up and missing all of its doors and windows. The trailer was positioned about 70 meters from a house, 70 meters from a convenience store, and about the same distance from the road.    The kids from around my neighborhood would all play there. Like 20-30 of them at a time in organized ""wars.""    So apparently one day some old distressed woman called the cops when she saw a group of children dressed in masks and hoodies, with guns, running around near a convenience store. The cops came and pulled up with vests, the kids freaked but put down their guns and talked to them. Told them to stop being idiots I assume.    One of the cops pointed at one of the kids' guns and said ""hey, I have one of those in the truck!""    I didn't see them playing there again."

It's internally stock, save for the barrel being some weird coated aluminum one instead of the stock brass (It's the one that came with the shorter outer barrel I have installed, I figured doing an accuracy test with a prommy barrel and Rhop would be cheating!)  Externally... anything but stock!  The charging handle and fire selector have been swapped to lefthanded operation (which required a nearly full disassembly of the gun).  I removed the upper rail and sights and replaced them with a monolithic upper rail (which has integrated flip up sights). The rail is made by 6mm Proshop. ZERO wobble on the upper rail now, vs the small amount on the smaller stock rail (which almost everyone mentions, so it's not just mine).  The front grip, which was squeaky and wobbly has been replaced by an Angry Gun Tar-21 Rail grip set (Which was originally brown, but I primed and painted black). New grip has NO wobble, and looks awesome. ...Good luck finding them in stock though, as they have been discontinued and are extremely rare to find! Thanks to /u/KikoIzFtw for pointing me to this one! (It was on ShooterCBgear, but the page didn't show up on google when searched, which is why they had 1 or two left.)  I also replaced the outer barrel with a shorter one, from 19"" to 15.75"". Howeverit turns out it is 14mm+, despite being listed on Evike as 14mm-!  Currently I have an adapter on it, but I will probably be returning the short outer barrel, and instead trim down the stock 19"" outer and re-thread it, as I don't want to use an adapter (It makes the gun longer, and is a slightly different size than the outer barrel, so it looks meh).  Accessories mounted:  MAGPUL Foregrip MAGPUL Sling mount (The gun hangs perfectly with this - I just need a better single point sling now!) Kruger Riflescope, 1.5-5x32 Madbull Gemtech G5 QD Suppressor/flashider combo  Plans for this gun are to HPA it, and drop in a PDI 6.10 barrel, and an RHOP. Might even be stupid fancy and put in a TDC mod for super tuned hopup.   HPA is hopefully within the next few months. Currently, it looks like the Wolverine Hydra will be my best bet, as while I would prefer a Polarstar F1, there has been jack all news about it, and the Hydra is actually coming out this month...

airsoft,3cn7el,cameroncac,4,Thu Jul 9 16:17:29 2015 UTC,"The TM M9A1 is the current gold standard of M9s. It will not fire at particularly high FPS, but it will do stupid things like engage at near AEG range, which TM hop-ups will make possible. However, it's also not available domestically in the US, so if you are looking at buying them from Japan, shipping will usually push the price a bit over budget. It's also made with polymer instead of metal (which isn't a bad thing but can be subjectively).   The KWA is considered by some to be better than the KJW M9 because the KWA is optimized for propane better and comes better out of the box overall. If you don't want to mod the gun with accuracy upgrades or don't want to bother with CO2, choose the KWA. Both are full metal.   However, if you want to use CO2, the KJW is the way to go. The KJW is also $30 cheaper, although considering the cost of accuracy upgrades and CO2 magazines, it actually ends up costing more to own an upgraded KJW. The KJW is compatible with previous-gen TM M9 upgrades and replacement parts are everywhere, unlike the KWA (although it consists primarily of ordering directly from the factory, which isn't too much a stretch). I would personally opt for the KJW, simply because I have one and it has never jammed or failed for any reason.   For $170, you could buy your choice of KJW M9 variant along with a tightbore, new hop-up bucking, and one spare propane magazine, in addition to whatever other gear you buy with it.   WE is compatible with many of the same upgrades as the KJW, but QC is sometimes squiffy and part compatibility can be a crapshoot since they make their M9 slightly different (enough to require sanding and other fitting for several internal parts). They do offer their M9s in a greater variety of models, though."

Commoners are not allowed into the Zone, but stalkers sneak into the zone to find riches through artifacts and weapons, with the ultimate rumor of the Wish Granter, which is in the middle of the Zone, the Chernobyl NPP.   In Fallout, the world is utter wasteland, nukes went off everywhere.   Hope this clears things up."

The original buildings, constructed in 1896 and reconstructed in 1906, were once the manufacturing site for Olympia Beer. They have long served as a landmark for local residents and drivers along Interstate 5.  A new brewery was built in 1934, uphill from the original brewhouse. Brewing operations in a modern plant on the site ended in 2003.  The brewery has been for sale since the collapse of a real estate deal with a bottled water company in 2007.  After condemning previous owners' water rights in April 2008, the cities of Lacey, Olympia and Tumwater took possession of water rights once held by the former Olympia Brewing Company.   The original brewhouse is part of the Tumwater Historic District, listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

airsoft,3cmwjm,zkid10,4,Thu Jul 9 03:40:34 2015 UTC,"With FAMAS you have very limited companies to choose from. Off the top of my head I can only name 2 that make them: Tokyo Marui, and Cybergun. I'm not sure how Cybergun performs, but TM should be good for how old it is (I believe it has a v.1 gearbox).   As for AUG you have ASG, APS and I think JG. I know the first version of the APS Urban AUG was shit, but the version 2 is supposedly supposed to be free of those flaws. JG is a kind of alright brand overall (not sure how their AUGs are), and all three are prone to upgrades.   Honestly, if you're looking for $100 and/or under, get a CYMA AK.   ≤$200 G&G combat machine   ≤$300 I love the look of the G&P Sentry (I think normally they're $350 but evike has a sale right now). You also can't go wrong with any ICS gun. My current gun, the ARES Amoeba AM-013 is a blast and I got for $280. Its ETS makes it safe to use an 11.1 lipo on.   ≤$400 most G&P guns  ≤$500 VFC"
airsoft,3cmwjm,Quachyyy,3,Thu Jul 9 05:26:17 2015 UTC,"Cybergun and JP Famas use the V1Mod gearbox that accepts a mishmash of AK (v3) and M14 (v7) parts, and can accept a short type motor if you grind the shaft down approx 1-3mm or use a shorter gear.   TBH, if you don't mind paying more for just the gears alone, (F*cking 13:1 v7 gears cost more than the gun does) and having basically no documentation beyond a few obscure and poorly labeled threads, Famas is a perfectly valid choice for someone with no common sense and a plump wallet.   with the Cybergun Famas, I was seeing about 300 fps with .2 (not spectacular) at about 11rps using a 7.4v LiPo but these issues can be resolved by buying an v7 cylinder and a v2/3 piston and head, since the compression in the stock components is just horrible. Mine is shooting 330 fps at 25 rps after fixing compression and shimming, which is almost skirmishable. almost...   from a financial standpoint though, get any other gun. its not worth it unless you're crazier than I am."

airsoft,3cmwjm,MaceRider,2,Thu Jul 9 09:46:43 2015 UTC,"No good FAMAS models out there aside from the TM one, which is super old and likely rare/expensive.  AUG models are few and far between and, consequentially, there are less upgrades, replacement parts, etc for them."
airsoft,3cmwjm,Luissen,1 point,Thu Jul 9 09:58:24 2015 UTC,"@ OP, Famas rail is not that bad, its a little higher than the carry handle on the M4/m16 platform (of which some have rails) and lines up perfectly with most paintball masks. if you cut out a mesh mask to fit goggles, you can even get proper cheekweld with optics.   The Famas can mount a rail in the groove that the irons sight through (and you can also mount one on the side of the sights due to a second pair of holes if you want) but the screw will block the sights off. There is also a pic rail on the handguard too if you like grips or lights. I wouldn't go crazy mounting stuff on that rail though because the safety catch is the only thing holding it onto the rest of the gun.  Downside of getting a Famas though would be the lack of documentation, and that your parts cost multiple times more than the gun itself, for moderate benefit."
airsoft,3cmwjm,littlepig45,1 point,Thu Jul 9 06:07:20 2015 UTC,I actually use an M4 with the carry handle sights. I hate how high they are when I put my rail mount and aimpoint on.

airsoft,3cli3d,NashvilleAirsoftMatt,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:41:47 2015 UTC,The downside to a battery box on the front is that with all of the other stuff people normally attach to their guns - a battery/battery box can make the gun super front heavy.

After getting it in the right shape I fucked up the spring (managed to bend it when extracting the original magazine catch so the pin required a massive amount of fiddling around to get it completely through) but with the sweet tunes of metallica, turbonegro and megadeth I finally managed to seat the spring and jam that fucker of a pin in, screw on the other side of the pin and I must say I'm happy with the product;  I can now accidentially press it, have my mags freefall onto the stonecold ground and have them shatter into more pieces than grahams number. Although the magazines fit snuggly and don't have the magazine catch slam into them at the speed of sound anymore it's too bad most of the paint is gone cause I dinged it up bending and fitting it  replica is a CM045  What I learned from this:    be careful when taking stuff apart for the first time anything can be used as a hammer if you beat it hard enough springs are the devils magic metal is hard paint is soft"

airsoft,3cmpn6,Speefy,1 point,Thu Jul 9 07:23:25 2015 UTC,"1 & 2) Yes, you can interchange any m4/m16 barrel / rail system.  3) The short answer: No, at least in terms of the airsoft equivalent.  The longer, technical answer: The Classic Army Scar-H (Classic Army MK17 specifically) gets away with being cross-compatible because it uses the same .308 style magazine across their replicas (AR-10 and MK17 replica come to mind as both have the extended v2 gearbox).    As far as cross brands, G&P SR25 magazines, A&K SR25 magazines, and Classic Army magazines are cross-compatible with one another, though some modifications in the magwell may be required to get it to fit.  G&G and Ares use their own proprietary magazines.  VFC Scar-H magazines 'could' be made to fit...someone has tried as far as I recall."

Check it out, hopefully it will give some of y'all some ideas of things to bring to events like these.  Most of NATO was unprepared for this event. 27 were heatcas/injured (2 went to the hospital after they stopped sweating completely), and we were down to about 60 guys by the last day from more than half of NATO dropping from exhaustion. There's nothing wrong with taking yourself out of the fight if you feel like you really can't take anymore. No shame in that. However, it was directly the fault of some players for not doing there research and thinking this was just another Lion Claws or AMS event.   Preparation is extremely important for events like MSW puts on. Me and my squad don't live anywhere near eachother, but we kept in contact for months. Keeping up on gear checks, PT, making sure we pre-hydrated the week before the event, practiced hand-signals and other key teamwork essentials during Skype sessions, etc. None of our guys had problems, and had a blast running Nods and clearing the factory, completing our objectives while Rusfor was busy waking the rest of NATO from their naps. But GG Rusfor, you guys made that event much more fun than if it were just another NATO vs. NATO event. Definitely a major part of what makes MSW events so unique."
airsoft,3ck84d,kuroageha,5,Wed Jul 8 15:50:47 2015 UTC,"MSW is interesting in that the 'experienced' MSW NATO guys will eventually stand out by having stripped nearly everything they don't need off of their kit and rucks.  I run a 44L Kelty as my ruck now and have space left over, despite half of the bag being my sleep system.  (Okay, I did have a gun bag with spare M60 last time as well that I put some things in.  We have also learned that spare Machine Guns are basically a requirement.  One or more is guaranteed to die at the worst possible moment.)"
airsoft,3ck84d,DisforDoga,3,Wed Jul 8 17:25:55 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I can definitely cut down on a lot of shit next MSW Op. I go to. There was some confusion on what constituted as a meal. There was no way I would've ever eaten 6 MREs. I survived just fine off of 1 MRE, 5 Cliff bars, and some Hi-chews. Albeit I had a huge breakfast/lunch at the local IHOP before hand. I tend to eat a lot less during games. I try to eat a lot anyway because I'm burning so many calories. At the very least, I try to get a lot of electrolytes in me, and not drink just plain water. I ended up over-hydrating at RoR and started to gag from downing medic bottle after medic bottle. I also didn't use any part of my sleep system. Just sort of laid my Boonie on the ground as a pillow, and got a few minutes of shuteye here-and-there. Probably can cut down on at least 60% of the stuff I brought to RoR. Would also have been nice, since I had to ruck in our extra SAW for the Op. Was never really into the whole saying, ""ounces=pounds, pounds=pain"" but I'm certainly a believer now, haha."
airsoft,3ck84d,kuroageha,4,Wed Jul 8 18:07:18 2015 UTC,Yea it's kind of dumb the entire time pre-game they were telling us 6 meals. And then on site they changed it to 4. Could have packed a lot less. I did 3 meals + snacks.  Seriously could have done it assault packs only.   Also agree on the water. If you're hydrating properly it's hard to drink that whole medic bottle.

Honestly didn't feel like this was a hard event at all. Wasn't as bad temperature wise as Sovereign Fury, aren't pushing as hard as Shelby. Terrain is pretty flat so it's not like Cove.   Some of NATO was really unprepared. The one guy at the post game AAR all like ""give us rehydration tablets."" lolno. Just drink your water. We were literally sitting there for 3 hours after the jump in doing nothing at night and you were a heat casualty. You literally just did not hydrate.   You can tell who has been there done that even in the parking lot before the game. The guys running around in PC/helmets are going to heatcat unless they are true military studs. But true military studs aren't concerned with looking fly before the game even starts and are those dudes in Tshirts, shorts and sandals as long as possible. Or in the case of the one dude, just boxers and sandals.  Going from 181 to 67 by endex was an eyeopener for some people I'm sure.  DA kits are sexy, but SF guys know how to moderate their kits for the situation. They aren't wearing plate carriers and helmets for Red Wings."

My squad got to the parking lot at about 8am after a 10 hour drive (which was really not bad compared to the 22+ hour drive to Oklahoma for BH3 last year). We talked for a few minutes to get a game plan. Went to the local Walmart to pick up 3 cases of water, ate at IHOP, and then headed back to the parking lot. We got the first spot in the left side lot, under some really nice shade. We rigged up some of our tarps between two of our vehicles for extra shade, and chilled/rested up for the rest of the day. We were already really squared away, so within the last hour of check-in we chrono'd and got our papers and bbs good-to-go. Meanwhile, guys were still showing up, and rushing to get checked-in. You could tell some guys were definitely new. One guy started loading mags with his own bbs, till his teamate told him that's not how MSW works. That should give a pretty good idea of how unprepared and clueless some of the NATO guys were.."

airsoft,3cjvv7,TheKrazeTrain,1 point,Wed Jul 8 16:38:50 2015 UTC,I need to seal one of my mags a little better cause it's still a little leaky. I usually wrap it around 2 times. Any tips?
airsoft,3cjvv7,BrianWantsTruth,1 point,Wed Jul 8 16:42:22 2015 UTC,"Obnoxious music, but this video pretty much covers the process.  I used WAY less tape than this guy though, like, I made a strip of tape as wide as the channel the o-ring sits in, then wrapped it maybe 2 or 3 times around. I know people have varying success with this, and I'm not sure why my technique worked so well, but it definitely can work."
airsoft,3cjvv7,TheKrazeTrain,1 point,Wed Jul 8 16:50:32 2015 UTC,Yeah I used this video before. The music is really quite annoying. I'm gonna attempt to teflon tape the one that leaks again.
airsoft,3cjvv7,BrianWantsTruth,1 point,Thu Jul 9 00:52:14 2015 UTC,"It may take a couple tries to find the right shape for the tape, but I can attest to it working if everything is good.   An additional tip, though I question if it makes much difference, is that I rotated to o-rings when I put them back. On disassembly, they were formed in a squarish shape, so I put them back in with the o-rings's ""corners"" on the flat part of the base-plate...I hope that makes sense.   I also soaked the o-rings in silicon liquid while I worked (maybe 45 minutes), but I didn't notice a difference in their texture or thickness or anything.  shrug that's all I've got. Good luck, as I said, keep at it and it should work. They're totally decent mags once the seal is solved.  One last idea: if the teflon tape didn't work, I was going to use some sort of rubber gap-sealer goo from a hardware store. It wouldn't be permanent, as you could always pry it back open, but it has a chance to be a little messy. I suspect it would be a good final solution if necessary."

Some places in the town have some random nets hanging there and it's a bit bothersome. Fix the net around the safe area, this is a safety thing above all else.

One thing about the M1100s is they have a really dumb sear design that a lot of people just remove because it often just causes problems.   What this means is that each shot will require a fairly sharp jerk on the trigger, as a gradual pull will just end up in the gas venting similar to what you're describing.   It's also possible the valve reset springs are worn out enough that it can't handle green gas anyone, which I assume you're using.  Edit: Also these photos are fairly straightforward"

The valve is a fairly straightforward assembly, so pictures on what exactly is tripping you up would be very helpful for us to give you advice.   Also, that's a peculiar issue- if the gun was discharging all of its gas at once, there could be an issue with the valve knocker reset during the firing cycle, which is what cuts off the flow of gas. When the gun discharged its gas, did the bolt stay open until it ran out, or did it cycle normally while draining the gas?"

airsoft,3ckk4p,Lacking_The_Time,2,Wed Jul 8 18:03:15 2015 UTC,"My issue personally is that Airsoft combat ranges are always less than 200 feet, and even with a ghillie suit, any movement will give you away pretty easily."

It doesn't matter what you're wearing, if you move, you will be seen. This also works both ways. You don't have to be wearing a ghillie suit for people to completely miss you at reasonable distance.

The idea of reviewing airsoft firearms has been ground into mush by YouTube and other bloggers alike...I'd focus maybe on broader concepts like your experiences in Airsoft, different gametypes, etc. Why one firearm may work in a certain situation where it's counterpart won't.   Blogs are a tricky sell because they're not content that people can watch or background browse. They really require a certain type of finesse. Our team has it's own blog and an article I wrote really resonated with the online community back in May, to the point where it's viewership totalled over 5,000 and it was shared across North America and abroad...Blacksheep even re-shared it via their Facebook and in turn it got put out even further.  I didn't talk about guns though...I talked about being honest in Airsoft. I gave my opinion as a team leader on cheating, cheaters and how you should approach it. I drew a line in the sand and called out people who called out cheaters, I told it how many people see it.   Did I do anything differently to get it shared? Not particularly. I just wrote an honest opinion piece from the perspective of a team leader. I didn't write about the same thing everyone else wrote about, and it created and sparked conversation."

airsoft,3clnqd,jules_fait_fer,1 point,Wed Jul 8 22:57:11 2015 UTC,"Doesn't seem like a deep or unique enough concept to get much of a following.  The historical background of every firearm ever has been summarized very well by a ton of different professionals, so you'd be better off just linking a Wikipedia article, in that respect.  Similarly, most popular Airsoft guns have been reviewed a million times by a million kids on YouTube.  Do what you enjoy of course, but it's hard to break into what's been done to death.  Maybe concentrate on weird or unique models of Airsoft guns and the history behind the replicas themselves?  when were they made, by whom, availability, upgrade capacity, etc.  I know I really love reading about bizarre or uncommon Airsoft guns like the old Japanese compressed air guns or the Korean/Chinese army service weapons replicas that pop up once in a blue moon.  They usually get upvoted on here because it's an interesting and novel subject."
airsoft,3clnqd,NATOMarksman,1 point,Wed Jul 8 22:22:00 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I was thinking it's probably been done a lot. Mostly was trying to come up with a niche for an affiliate program and I chose the first thing I was interested in. Just thought I'd check for ideas, but it doesn't look like I'll be finding any way to get into it unless I do rare guns."
airsoft,3clnqd,Zillo7,1 point,Wed Jul 8 22:37:00 2015 UTC,"Compiling 'research' on guns is something that is almost inherently redundant. Like any consumer, airsofters either have at least a general idea of what they want (finding a site specific to their interests, like Evike) or go to sites where there is an aggregate of data on them (like reddit or other forums, but also sorting by user review and searching through those). Many also happen to thoroughly research real guns as a hobby and are buying airsoft guns as an extension of that.   In both cases, your blog is a drop in the ocean and people would have little reason to read it. Your reviews would represent only one point of data in terms of relative success of the item, and unless you are actually going out and running these guns hard enough to have a practical, respected opinion on them (which you probably aren't, since it sounds like many of your reviews will be compilations of information already available on the Internet), they will be rejected along with every other C/P 'airsoft' blog out there.   When I search for information or reviews on guns and find a pile of blogs that simply C/P wikipedia entries on 'real steel' and product information sheets from the manufacturer, just clicking and loading their blog for three seconds feels like I've wasted an eternity, because there was no point in even clicking that link in the first place. I explicitly avoid blogs when looking for information on guns/items for that reason.   Practical advice and information is valued over simple data aggregation. Search engines can do that. What information can YOU provide? What perspective on airsoft is unique to you that might shed light on things for someone else?   A better question to ask is, 'how can I better the airsoft community? What do I have to teach them, what needs to be said or done to make us better players or better optimize our guns and gear?' You can narrow it down from there."

airsoft,3cn3aa,Pure_Silver,2,Thu Jul 9 05:16:53 2015 UTC,"Can /u/Ruschnav speak for all guns from VFC or is it just for the lower end guns[?]   VFC's guns do have a reputation for some poor internal parts - self-shimming gears are my biggest problem with them, but there are others - but they are very readily fixed by any competent tech. If you do want to replace the gearbox with an HPA alternative, the Polar* V2 Fusion Engines are literally built for these guns and would be a very sensible choice if you don't want to fiddle around with AEG internals any more.  I don't know about ""one of the best AEGs in airsoft"" (RealSword, TM, Krytac etc. are better) but the VFC HK416s are still great purchases because of their great externals and ready parts compatibility. Therefore, even if you completely change the internals that's still much cheaper and easier than buying a gun that has great internals but bad externals, and trying to upgrade the externals instead."
airsoft,3cn3aa,Pure_Silver,1 point,Thu Jul 9 08:08:21 2015 UTC,"if I were to replace the internals, do you know how much it would cost for staying with AEG and what parts do you reccomend? and could I sell the internals that are already in the gun since I have only fielded the gun maybe 3 times?  I was testing the gun earlier today with a 9.6v battery and when I went decently hard on the trigger on semi, I got a lot of lockouts which I really don't want.  Would that be the piston, motor, or the gearbox causing that?  Basically I want to be able to trigger finger like this guy recording:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qgn2nbJP5_k"
airsoft,3cn3aa,Pure_Silver,2,Thu Jul 9 15:20:23 2015 UTC,"A comprehensive overhaul of the gun will be sub-$100 in parts - maybe even sub-$50 - plus an hour or two of labour from a competent tech. Not much, in other words (at least not compared to a $500 P* FE), and it should last you a long time if it's done well.  You could sell the parts, but you probably wouldn't make much back (people know they aren't great, and when great is only $20 people just buy new instead) so you might be better off offering them to your tech's spares box in exchange for a discount on the labour or something. You won't need to replace a lot of parts anyway; from /u/Ayylmao1106 and /u/OGPancakewasd's comments below it sounds like it'll be the motor and maybe the gearset - $60ish for both unless you buy very high-end gears."

If it has self-shimming gears, replace them; I like SHS' if you're on a tight budget. Then consider your options for hop-up and inner barrel - flat-hop or R-hop (I think /u/imarziali does them for $25?) would be the obvious choices."

Was wrong on this part. They finally fixed the piston and tappet plate with decent material.  If you want some trigger response go with a ZCI Hi Torque motor for 30 bucks off brill.  Do some compression work to make it as consistent as possible, correct the AoE using either a sorbo or a faucet washer.

airsoft,3cldio,RomiFarmCash,4,Wed Jul 8 20:28:37 2015 UTC,"The O-rings definitely need lubricant out of the box, one drop of silicone oil on each (the release valve on the back of the magazine and the fill valve on the bottom). Otherwise GBBPs don't need all that much lube; they actually work pretty much optimally when dry.   You want a very thin film of lube just to grease the parts a bit, but it sounds like that's already done."
airsoft,3cldio,NATOMarksman,2,Wed Jul 8 20:43:29 2015 UTC,"wash it off    With water? No, don't do that. If anything you wipe it off with a rag.   As long as you re-lube with a petroleum product free lubricant it will be fine. WE isn't famous for having great lube in their guns. Lots of people are going to demand you use a certain type of lube. Reality of the situation is that they'll all do pretty much the same thing with negligible differences that no one has proven much about."
airsoft,3cldio,IDGAF1203,1 point,Wed Jul 8 20:38:58 2015 UTC,With soap and water?   Yes.   I use a rag which I dip into soapy water and rub against the slide contacts which helps separate the grease/oil.  Of course I use a dry rag to clean off any excess afterwards.
airsoft,3cldio,Jermenizzle,1 point,Wed Jul 8 20:49:39 2015 UTC,"Most are going to recommend you clean with a rag, and only use mild soap and water for cleaning the bucking, not cleaning the rest of the gun."
airsoft,3cldio,IDGAF1203,1 point,Wed Jul 8 20:57:05 2015 UTC,Why not? Just wondering.
airsoft,3cldio,Jermenizzle,2,Wed Jul 8 20:59:51 2015 UTC,"Because the gun has lots of little cracks and crevices, especially after use. Water can leak in there, and when you pack lube on top of that you're just sealing the water in.   The only part of the gun you want completely lube-free is the bucking (and inner barrel). You just want to get rid of dirt and debris from the rest of the gun and keep it lubed, which you don't need water to do.  Is using water better than not cleaning it? Sure. Is there a huge difference between using water and wiping it down without water? Not really, but its still not recommended by most sources."
airsoft,3cldio,IDGAF1203,1 point,Wed Jul 8 21:03:43 2015 UTC,"Ah I see where you are coming from, didn't even think of that.

airsoft,3cldio,Jermenizzle,1 point,Wed Jul 8 21:07:43 2015 UTC,"Ah, sure for a complete disassembly it would be fine. I just don't usually do that to a ""new"" gun unless it's been skirmished before, for a quick re-lubing with the upper and trigger intact you're just better off dry cleaning everything. WE glock I've had came lubed just fine."
airsoft,3cldio,IDGAF1203,1 point,Wed Jul 8 23:19:58 2015 UTC,"I don't have much experience with GBBPs, but I wouldn't. That lube is most likely perfectly good for the gun.

airsoft,3ckchn,lSherlockl,3,Wed Jul 8 16:13:17 2015 UTC,"In my experience a cheap 3-9x40 is perfect for airsoft.  3x is useful when you might be getting faster, closer engagements. 9x is great for spotting. I tend to shoot on 4x, mostly because I'm familiar with range-finding at 4x.  Having parallax isn't so bad if you're good at getting your cheek weld the same each time, and get used to looking centrally down the scope. If you've got a little more budget go for a parallax-adjustable model.  Like you say objective size isn't a huge thing, but it definitely helps when shooting into shaded areas to have a little more light gathering. Would say 40mm is a good balance between bulk and light gathering.  My favourite of my collection is a TM - http://shop.ehobbyasia.com/tokyo-marui-3-9x40-pro-scope-zoom.html"
airsoft,3ckchn,snakebitey,1 point,Wed Jul 8 17:02:12 2015 UTC,"The TM scopes seem kind of pricey but they're actually really good quality for the price.  I think the zoom scopes still use TASCO glass.  Despite the plastic body, my TM red dot lasted much longer and had better light transmission than my cheaper, but metal constructed G&P aimpoint."
airsoft,3ckchn,kuroageha,3,Wed Jul 8 18:20:29 2015 UTC,"I went overkill and bought a low-mid end real steel short dot.  If I ever want to throw it on a SKS or Enfield or something I can, which is nice.  Airsoft repro scopes or magnifiers (especially magnifiers) often have horrible image distortion and quality, its super hit and miss.  Thats why I just ate the cost. The Barska 1.25x-4.5x short dot scope is what the following will refer to.   Magnification   IMHO glass clarity is more important than magnification with respect to Airsoft.  you need a focus feature to track your BBs effectively especially on those 275' shots on windy days when you need to adjust your shooting significantly.  if you're smart youll be putting Lexan over both ends of your optic, too, so that plus goggles means you need clarity wherever you can with so many reflective surfaces in play.  the Barska focuses nice and clear so I'm happy there.  anyway, the 1.25x can be used both eyes open, which is nice.  4.5x is really perfect if your gun shoots past 250' in a straight line.  I haven't used the other settings a ton.     *Eye relief: how far your eye can be from the scope, usually see 3-5” range from most scopes. Here I have a question using a long eye relief scope or a “Scout” scope 10-12” relief can you place the scope closer or is the eye relief mean keep eye X distance from the scope?   This basically means what distance can you effectively look through the scope.  Too close or too far and it won't focus.  My scope is about perfect at 4"", so unfortunately you can't really mount it that far forward.  Works fine for me but for some real guns it means mounting it over the action which can cause issues.   Objective Lens: How big of a “picture” you get and how much light you get   I'm actually not sure, though the specs to that Barska are available.   Tube Diameter: usually 30mm or 1” can* help with light transmission   also not positive, but I think its 30mm.  Plenty of light gathering for my tastes.   Reticle type: Generally understand mill-dots are preferred/useful for airsoft, illumination is an option on some   Non illuminated, ""Euro type"" crosshair.  really good target acquisition and ability to track shots but I believe mildot would be better.  basically a ""T"" shaped crosshair   Parallax setting   Not perfect but its only relevant on 1.25x, and in that scenario you're probably firing for effect anyway.  Above 2x or so I can't see a difference for Airsoft at least.   I have been pondering the following optics if anyone would care to comment: *Leapers 1.5-6x44 30mm  *Leapers 1-4.5x28 cqb 30mm *NcStar 1.5-6x40 30mm  *Leapers 3-9x32 CQB 1” (adjustable Parallax)   Can't comment except I've only had bad experiences with NCstar.  Just trash."
airsoft,3ckchn,jules_fait_fer,2,Wed Jul 8 17:25:37 2015 UTC,"Magnification up to 4x is appropriate for airsoft. You can technically go higher, but since the guns themselves are limited to much shorter distances than firearms, it's overkill unless your vision isn't too good. That, and if you're firing with a mid/hi-cap, high magnification is more of a liability since it restricts your field of view; if you miss the precise target, you can just follow up with more shots until you hit it.  With long eye-relief scopes, you cannot place the scope further or closer. The eye relief defines where, within a few tenths of an inch, you can place your eye to actually see through it.   Objective describes how wide the end of the scope tube is, which improves your light gathering; however, it also adds to the weight and bulk of the scope. For most people, 32-40mm is plenty.   Tube diameter also contributes to light gathering, but not as much as the objective, and again, there is a tradeoff between light gathering and size/weight.   Mil-dots make sense in airsoft because there is a noticeable arc over the pellet's flightpath, and they make for convenient holdover points at range where your shots begin to vertically disperse down. However, I personally prefer duplex/mil-duplex because I find the crosshairs cleaner and easier to read.   Find a scope that is set at 35 yards parallax and forget about it. Your parallax setting should be from a third to a half of your normal range, and since 50 yards (normally found on scopes intended for .22s, which are normally fired up to 100-150 yards) is more along the lines of three-quarters of normal airsoft range, it's not optimal. 100 yards is pure firearm range and not what you should be using.   You can use parallax as a kind of range estimation, since it makes your field of view clearer/blurrier relative to the actual distance, but this relies on your vision being good. If you don't have excellent vision, stick with 35 yards."
airsoft,3ckchn,NATOMarksman,1 point,Wed Jul 8 17:45:43 2015 UTC,The number one thing for an airsoft scope is being able to actually see through it. Too many times I've seen people with cool looking scope replicas that have no eye relief and suck lol. I run a .22 mag scope made by simmons that cost me 28$ + 20$ for some really nice leopold scope rings and I can run it all day both eyes open.

airsoft,3ckchn,DragunovCpt,1 point,Thu Jul 9 01:27:33 2015 UTC,"I've been using the VisionKing 1.25-5x26 for a while now and love it.  Decent optical quality, eye relief is bang on average, and the range of magnification is PERFECT for Airsoft. 1.25 is usable in CQB, and 5 is great for identifying targets further away (although I tend to stick to around 3)."
airsoft,3ckchn,RWJP,1 point,Thu Jul 9 05:49:31 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the inputs. For anyone that is like me and was freaked out or concerned about parallax, here is the simple formula to calculate how far of center your shot could be due to parallax error.  1/2 * (objective in mm) * abs(desired range in yrds - parallax set to yrds) / parallax set to yrds  and now an example 1.5-6x44mm scope set at 100 yrds  1/2 * 44 * abs(10-100)/100 =19.8mm  So what does this tell us? Due to moving your head around or inconsistent cheeking (face it it will happen) could yield up to a max variation of .779"" off center for a total of ~1.5"" grouping at 30' assuming your weapon is laser accurate. So realistically I think it is safe to say for the most part the effects of parallax are not huge at the ranges we use compared to the pre set range of rifles.  However this cannot say as to the physical ""focus"" of the image which may be off due to the parallax setting."

airsoft,3ckpqd,kuroageha,3,Wed Jul 8 21:44:07 2015 UTC,I'm being sarcastic.  Prowins are notoriously finicky and picky.   They're made to very good tolerances when many guns are not.    It's not really their fault I guess but there are still a fair share of issues with them either way.
airsoft,3ckpqd,jules_fait_fer,1 point,Wed Jul 8 21:47:31 2015 UTC,"prowin has trouble with some guns.  it works fine in most, though.  my other comment was downvoted for some reason, but try it again with another bucking."
airsoft,3ckpqd,dabluebunny,1 point,Wed Jul 8 22:07:12 2015 UTC,"Had the same issues same barrel and bucking.  Prowins are just finicky. You will get it right you just have to play it a bit. I lived my hookup with a little spit or something to get it to slide in easier. Idk probably not recommended, but it worked for me."
airsoft,3ckpqd,jules_fait_fer,3,Thu Jul 9 01:56:41 2015 UTC,"Try another bucking.  The maple leaf is very tight in every hopup, and honestly not very good in the first place.  I use an r-hopped Prometheus barrel with my prowin and a g&g green bucking which fits perfectly snug.  The prowin is really nice for doing mods like a flat hop or especially an r-hop because it's so easy to disassemble/reassemble and it adjusts reaallly finely.  It's sort of a waste otherwise, imo as it doesn't do much a stock hopup and bucking dont already accomplish."
airsoft,3ckpqd,Papirkurven,1 point,Wed Jul 8 18:00:47 2015 UTC,"I had the same problem, what i did was that i filed down abit at the end of the barrel and around the maple leaf bucking at the back where the lip is. Just 1mm or something. Sorry for my terrible english, jusk ask if you didnt understand it. xD maple leaf in the prowin is superb. Mine is r-hoped tho"
airsoft,3cijtc,Trevortmiller,6,Wed Jul 8 04:35:42 2015 UTC,I'm moving soon and cleaned out my airsoft closet tonight. Filled up one container with gear and the other with parts and etc. I don't have a container big enough for my guns so they're going separate. Ammo box is filled with mags and I have some things in the black bag as well. Can't forget about all of stuff I'm throwing out too. You never expect everything to accumulate like this so fast.
airsoft,3cijtc,Cryocasm,3,Wed Jul 8 04:39:39 2015 UTC,Nice one on capping the guns with massive red caps (or tape it looks) it make it very clear that they aren't real guns.  Hopefully the moving company doesn't think you're a warlord.
airsoft,3clv8c,coperphage,1 point,Wed Jul 8 22:37:42 2015 UTC,Why would you need that?
airsoft,3clv8c,The_Mexx,1 point,Wed Jul 8 22:42:27 2015 UTC,I have found a pistol grip that I like that does not seem to have the space for a motor in it so without having changed the location before I wanted to see if it was a hard thing to do and it seems like it is.
airsoft,3clv8c,chewbakka4lyfe,1 point,Wed Jul 8 22:50:13 2015 UTC,"You're probably better off dremeling out the pistol grip to fit the motor, rather than move the motor. The motor likely sits in a well in the gearbox to make contact with the first gear (bevel or pinion I forget which is which). In order to move the motor you'd literally have to re-engineer the gearbox shell to allow a different gear alignment in order for you to get a good angle on the gear from the motor. This may sound like gibberish to you, but I guarantee you that whatever it is I just explained is a fraction of how difficult it will actually be."
airsoft,3clv8c,Infide1icious,1 point,Wed Jul 8 22:56:45 2015 UTC,"Not easily, no.  If you've got a grand to spare, P* it, and put whatever pistol grip you want on it."
airsoft,3clv8c,TheWulfenPrince,1 point,Wed Jul 8 22:43:07 2015 UTC,Honestly that was one of the options I am considering
airsoft,3clv8c,TheWulfenPrince,1 point,Wed Jul 8 22:49:22 2015 UTC,"For some reason I thought the stoner had the motor inside the receiver, but perhaps I'm wrong. Anyways, you can't move the motor unless you make a serious project out of it, total rework/rebuild style.  Short answer: not a chance."
airsoft,3clno0,J13D,3,Wed Jul 8 21:40:20 2015 UTC,"My KJW sig just started doing this. The button for the mag release is known as the obtainer... and it gets worn down and quits obtaining. The hole on the side of the mag that the gun holds onto could also be worn to far down. The part is cheap enough, I am about to order mine."
airsoft,3clno0,needanacc0unt,1 point,Wed Jul 8 22:06:10 2015 UTC,Any recommended place to get the part?
airsoft,3clno0,needanacc0unt,1 point,Wed Jul 8 22:22:29 2015 UTC,"I'm ordering it straight from KJWorks in Taiwan, not sure if the part is the same for the HFC (I don't know if they are an OEM, if not who is their OEM?).   Here is the KJW part list, Page 3 Item number 64. http://www.kjworks.com.tw/photo/12918998873.pdf  It only comes out to be 3.45 USD, plus 3 bucks for shipping. I'm also ordering some new filling valves and mag lips (figured I'd make the order worth while)"
airsoft,3clno0,I_PLAY_CSGO,0,Wed Jul 8 22:30:53 2015 UTC,"This is most likely because the mag sits too loose in the magwell. A single layer of duct tape around the mag will do it, play around with it. Be careful not to put tape around the hole on the side, for the mag release to grip on.  EDIT. I'm a fool, I did not release this was a pistol until further inspection. Its late."

airsoft,3cgb8x,FlopperARC,20,Tue Jul 7 18:10:16 2015 UTC,You lucky fuckers that can actually use water to your advantage. Most water in one area here in CA is probably the Gatorade water cooler at the chrono station.
airsoft,3cgb8x,imarziali,3,Tue Jul 7 21:01:41 2015 UTC,That's not even really water.
airsoft,3cgb8x,Antirandomguy,5,Wed Jul 8 01:39:56 2015 UTC,"You're right. It's at the chrono station, so it's just a bunch of shitty .20s.  There is no water in California."

airsoft,3cgb8x,nskoko,2,Wed Jul 8 14:50:00 2015 UTC,That just makes me jealous. Nothing you say about playing in the snow will make me feel otherwise. I really want some snow games here in SoCal.
airsoft,3cgb8x,imarziali,1 point,Wed Jul 8 16:42:50 2015 UTC,"The cold kills your battery if you're using an AEG, and gas is even more useless, even Co2 gets shoddy and not to mention if you do try to heat/insulate your gun, better waterproof it too, lest snow gets in and melts. This leaves springers as the only effective weapon, and have fun lying still in -25C waiting for a target. Snow games can work, but only under ideal conditions."

airsoft,3cgb8x,peterha_jp,4,Tue Jul 7 20:35:57 2015 UTC,"Here's a vid on airsoft-guns submerged in water.  ...but I wouldn't play in water. Mostly because it's not somewhere you'd be able to dodge, cover or hide. If you're spotted you're more or less out in the coming seconds. Rather work my way where I have control.  I do like the photo and your dedication tho."
airsoft,3cgb8x,peterha_jp,1 point,Wed Jul 8 01:33:05 2015 UTC,Gas guns bro.
airsoft,3cgb8x,FTAC_Swope,2,Wed Jul 8 01:44:34 2015 UTC,"I don't get it. Gas gun makes you able to dodge, cover and hide in water?"
airsoft,3cgb8x,Kniefjdl,1 point,Wed Jul 8 02:18:22 2015 UTC,"You can submerge the gun, meaning you can get your body more under water. So at times I'll go completely underwater to my eyes and it's damn near impossible to see me. Then you can pull a gas gun out of the water and it'll fire. You just have to be sure to disassemble it and clean it hardcore."
airsoft,3cgb8x,FokkerBoombass,-1,Wed Jul 8 13:17:21 2015 UTC,"You're telling me gas-guns works when in water, even after the gun gets submerged? That which I precisely posted a video about?   If you're up to your eyes people can still see you. Yes, you could even dive, swim around under water if you think that's viable with all your gear on. But as soon as you need air you got no cover - and can hardly move. Not fast enough to dodge, and no obstacle behind which to hide. You're pretty much out. That's my point."

airsoft,3ckywn,needanacc0unt,3,Wed Jul 8 18:48:42 2015 UTC,"I know in some of these newer EBB series ICS models, you can just open the upper gearbox shell and inside are the pieces linked to the fake bolt movement that you can take out without any permanent alteration to your gun."
airsoft,3ckywn,omgalbert3,1 point,Wed Jul 8 18:50:10 2015 UTC,"I didn't open the upper gearbox, I took it out when I was sort of exploring the gun, but never changed anything. The charging handle pulls the bolt back but then nothing else happens. It seems like the handle is disconnected from the gearbox component, because if you push the handle back into the gun, it doesn't move the bolt."
airsoft,3ckywn,omgalbert3,5,Wed Jul 8 19:12:44 2015 UTC,"I never said you have already opened your upper gearbox, but I was trying to suggest that that is how you can disable the EBB function, since your post title says ""how to disable"" in it.  Maybe the EBB ICS models have a functioning bolt catch simulation, maybe that is your issue.  Can you press the bolt paddle button and see if that releases the fake bolt and charging handle back forward.  Often, these pieces hang back when your fake bolt is in the locked position and will stay there until you release them with the bolt paddle."
airsoft,3ckywn,omgalbert3,1 point,Wed Jul 8 19:39:16 2015 UTC,I'll give it a go. I put disable and reenable because I though I could work backwards if someone had disabled it( I have heard people don't like it).
airsoft,3ckywn,omgalbert3,2,Wed Jul 8 19:46:38 2015 UTC,"Sure that makes sense.  Usually though, when it comes to disabling EBB on an AEG, it involves some level of disassembly, it's not usually as easy as flipping a switch or holding down a button to instantly disable it.  That would be kind of interesting but I guess not worth the engineering for such a cosmetic to switch that quickly."
airsoft,3ckywn,omgalbert3,1 point,Wed Jul 8 19:48:46 2015 UTC,"By bolt paddle button do you mean the ""forward assist""? Like the button to release spring tension? On the Transform4 it does it when you switch back to safe after firing"

You may get more feel, customization ability, features, and bigger magazines than some pistols if you choose an SMG.  A good balance of size and weight would be the KWA MP9 series or maybe that new KWA Scorpion for even smaller.  The MP7 is also popular but is heavier in my opinion.

airsoft,3ckkyc,Pure_Silver,1 point,Wed Jul 8 18:26:46 2015 UTC,Ah now that's a very good point you two. I'm glad I asked this question. Looks like I'll need to investigate this point.
airsoft,3ckkyc,Pure_Silver,1 point,Wed Jul 8 18:35:43 2015 UTC,"I can see it's possible to get 540 round mags for the Scar. I'm not into milsim necessarily, but is having so large a mag considered bad form?"
airsoft,3ckkyc,Plasmus642,2,Wed Jul 8 18:40:01 2015 UTC,"Hi-cap magazines are cheap, but they're annoying (they make a loud rattling noise when you move, and have to be wound manually every so often) and those annoyances are really annoying with the advanced Recoil Shocks, because some of the gun's useful and realistic features (bolt lock and stop-on-empty) don't work with them.  My advice would be to stick to mid-caps if at all possible."
airsoft,3ckkyc,Pure_Silver,2,Wed Jul 8 18:55:27 2015 UTC,"Possible and now a certainty. I can live with 90 round mags if needed, especially as I want the bolt lock and stop-on empty features. Just need to work out the pouches issue by the sound of it ;)"
airsoft,3ckkyc,kuroageha,3,Wed Jul 8 19:11:00 2015 UTC,"You probably don't want to hear this, but the solution to the pouches is very simple - you save yourself $40 on the gun and $4 per magazine, and buy the SCAR-L instead, since they are identical internally and the L uses the STANAGs around which virtually every Western pouch is designed...  Regardless of whether you buy the H or the L, HSGI's Taco pouches are what you want. They are versatile - they'll take both 5.56mm NATO and 7.62mm NATO magazines - very high quality, and extremely good at accepting, retaining and releasing magazines. I can't recommend them enough."
airsoft,3ckkyc,sokolske,1 point,Wed Jul 8 19:21:10 2015 UTC,Any reason I shouldn't get the L over the H then? They both have the same firing specs I assume? I think the H looks a little nicer but maybe I could be convinced...
airsoft,3ckkyc,Plasmus642,1 point,Wed Jul 8 21:07:44 2015 UTC,Personally I agree with you that I would take a SCAR-H over a SCAR-L in terms of looks. If they both fire the same save yourself some trouble and get the one that takes 5.56 mags. Pouches and mags will be cheaper and easier to come by.
airsoft,3ckkyc,sokolske,1 point,Wed Jul 8 22:30:10 2015 UTC,"Nope, the differences are entirely cosmetic. I agree that the H is a much better looking gun, though. Check out the Tacos - they will take SCAR-H magazines, which solves the major problem."
airsoft,3ckkyc,ilovejellydonuts,2,Thu Jul 9 03:55:30 2015 UTC,"TM hicaps are more expensive than the mids, usually.  But in a way they are overall cheaper per rounds you can carry so I guess you're right in a way."
airsoft,3ckkyc,kuroageha,2,Wed Jul 8 20:31:40 2015 UTC,Not a bad purchase. Maybe get a stronger spring. But finding pouches will be hard.
airsoft,3ckkyc,kuroageha,1 point,Wed Jul 8 18:03:39 2015 UTC,Stronger spring - check. I think I've also read that an aftermarket barrel is an easy way to increase fps a little as well. Any other simple mods I can make? I don't think I'll be putting in an 11.1 Lipo as I don't want to mess about with mofset (sp?)
airsoft,3ckkyc,The_Mexx,1 point,Wed Jul 8 18:44:09 2015 UTC,"A mosfet is necessary to run an 11.1 lipo out of the box for most guns. I know of a few guns that have them out of the box, but it's not common."
airsoft,3ckkyc,The_Mexx,1 point,Wed Jul 8 22:31:12 2015 UTC,"Well for fps all matters on consistency.  So a taped up air nozzle, correct AOE, tight bore barrel, will help with increasing fps, but also making the gun more consistent."

airsoft,3ckkyc,kuroageha,2,Sun Jul 12 20:23:02 2015 UTC,"Okay, as you may have surmised from my other comments, this is my favorite gun out of all the guns that I own.  It's fun, sounds great (actually it's rather quiet even despite all the bolt parts moving), extremely accurate, and well made.  That said, I can be objective and there are some parts that are not so great, most of which are because it's a SCAR there are a lot of problems that are common with all models of SCAR (Including the real one.)   Limited external customization. The rails are too short for a lot of people, which makes getting a good firing grip complicated for some.   You also have limited side and under rail space if you have a lot of accessories.   (There are rail extensions available though.  I have an extension on my SCAR-H)    You cannot change out the pistol grip without extensive modification.  (Common to real SCAR.)    Balance. Most SCARs, including this one, are a little front heavy due to the very light stock. Durability issues. Though the stock lock design is easily the strongest out of all the SCAR AEGs on the market, with metal in many areas that even the real SCAR does not have metal in this area, the stock button is still plastic.  (Just like the real one...)   Aftermarket buttons are somewhat rare, and while metal ones meant for the real SCAR can be modified to fit, they're extremely expensive for a small piece of aluminum.    The bolt handle sticks out too far and may get snagged if you're firing from a strange position.   I have rectified this with a laylax short bolt handle.   (I just broke my stock button a couple months ago, after having owned the SCAR-H since preorder.   Even though it's broken, the stock still stays locked closed, I just can't fold it without replacing the button.  I actually have a spare replacement button that I haven't bothered to install because I never fold the stock anyway.   But in all, I feel these are all really minor issues I have, and mostly they're not TM's fault, but FNHs."
airsoft,3ckkyc,Pure_Silver,1 point,Wed Jul 8 18:43:50 2015 UTC,"Just want to say thanks very much for providing so much information - its really useful. And to address your points in respect to my potential purchase;  Customisation - not really that bothered with slapping on after market accessories. I just want a gun that shoots really well and is well made to boot.  Balance - this could be an issue, though I'm hoping a small one. I get the impression its not a deal breaker from what you have said, more just for completeness  Durability - I was hoping that with a TM I would be getting a good quality piece of kit. If its just the stock button then I can purchase a spare for if and when it breaks. Looking at a couple of websites they do seem quite rare (i.e. on backorder). Replacing the standard bolt handle with a half sized one sounds like a winner."
airsoft,3ckkyc,kuroageha,1 point,Wed Jul 8 19:05:22 2015 UTC,A note as to durability /reliability - I have used my SCAR at several Milsim West events which are probably the toughest torture tests an AEG an endure and it's performed excellently both times.

I'm pretty sure Airsoft GI custom made theirs from KWC Berettas and re-sold them. They're pretty skimpy on the technical specs, because they're intended to be ""props"" but my guess would be that the switch probably doesn't do anything, because they'd have to majorly overhaul the KWC to make it functional. Instead it looks like they just put the internals in a new receiver, so I think the rear safety is the only true saftey. But again I could be wrong, the only info they gave was that it was KWC. Looks pretty cool though. I'd buy one if it wouldn't be so insanely expensive to get it into my country."

airsoft,3cgijc,ilovejellydonuts,2,Tue Jul 7 20:01:56 2015 UTC,"Normal P90 high caps fill like a normal high cap (just dump them in) but the difference between those and something like an M4 mag is that instead of winding a wheel, they have a system like pistol where it pushes the BB's to the feed nozzle on the mag.  No winding needed since the mag is on top, its gravity fed.   Midcaps use a tube and spring follower in the mag like a normal M4 type midcaps. No winding needed, either.  The high caps are iffy on feeding mainly because they jam up all the time. That's why most people with P90's that want a high cap use the M4 mag adapter like the one you're familiar with."

airsoft,3chocf,yarudl,1 point,Wed Jul 8 20:01:29 2015 UTC,It depends on your play style but overall I believe AEGs are more versatile. Are there GBB support weapons? Is it easier to build a DMR with an AEG or GBB?
airsoft,3chocf,Chieffy765,0,Wed Jul 8 20:30:35 2015 UTC,"There aren't any GBB LMGs that are released yet, but I know a few are in development, and for the DMR thing, it's about the same I'd think, just like you'd need to completely overhaul a gearbox for an AEG DMR, a GBB DMR just needs lots of tuning, and possibly an HPA tap for consistency's sake"
airsoft,3chocf,yarudl,1 point,Thu Jul 9 00:46:01 2015 UTC,I don't believe that there will ever be a production model Gas in mag Gbb LMG that can compete with an AEG LMG. Simple as that.   Also I think you're overestimating the simplicity of tuning a gbbrs vs an AEG. Look at the sheer volume of AEG DMRs vs GBB. I agree it's possible but Gbb has inherent inconsistencies based on a huge as chunk of metal rattling the thing to bits every shot. Tolerances have to be higher to account for the long action meaning less precise return to battery. Can't have tighter tolerances or it'll jam.
airsoft,3chocf,Chieffy765,1 point,Thu Jul 9 01:00:20 2015 UTC,"It'll only jam with high tolerances if it's improperly maintained, and here are more AEG DMRs out there because the majority of people would prefer the plug and play aspect of AEGs over the realistic maintainence and constant troubleshooting of GBBs.  With regards to the LMGs, I only said some were being developed, I never said it would be able to compete with the sheer volume of fire an AEG LMG can put out, but if I had a choice, I'd take the gas one, because I came to airsoft because of the realism aspect, and carrying 5000rds in a mag designed for 100 kinda ruins that for me, but it's not my choice, if that's what people want, that's what people will buy."
airsoft,3cfwgp,madethisforposts,13,Tue Jul 7 16:28:23 2015 UTC,"Good to see LEOs looking at Airsoft as training tools!  They're very useful for CQC movement drills and weapons manipulation exercises and are super cheap over simunition.    Be wary that for distances beyond 10-15' (killhouse, traffic stops) they become less realistic for training purposes due to bb speed and accuracy.  Similarly, recoil is absolutely nowhere near real steel, but it would suffice for really close-range stuff in terms of drawing and firing practice in arrest/detaining scenarios to develop muscle memory, which sounds like what you're looking for.  WE specifically has done well with newer Glocks, I think the G17 is good but not sure about g18 (you probably don't want that);however, they haven't done very well with other models of firearms, so be wary.  KJW is also a very good budget brand for Glocks and 1911 models in terms of functionality and finish.  I have never seen a good gas powered mini 14 Airsoft replica unfortunately.  You may be stuck with simunition for that if that's the gun you specifically have to use.  If anyone could provide you with a conversion useful for training, it might be the Daytona Gun group on Facebook.  DGs use a high pressure air tank to power Airsoft guns and makes them recoil similarly to real steel.  They may be able to set you up with conversion kits for one of your rugers OR an existing Airsoft replica but they'd be custom made if even possible.  Youd also have a tank and air line to deal with so it might not be a useful training tool beyond very basic firing drills.  Wherever you get these from, stress they're for LEO level training and that you need a certain trigger pull, kick, etc if at all possible.  it may also get you a discount as it's good publicity for companies to support police and similar people.  good luck!"
airsoft,3cfwgp,jules_fait_fer,10,Tue Jul 7 16:45:20 2015 UTC,"WE glock 17s are actually quite good for the cost, though any of the WE glocks with full auto are just a catastrophe waiting to happen. Your biggest issue will be getting them into america due to laws and such. Kjw glocks work well too, though you'll run into the same problem.  As for mini 14s, your options are limited. You could opt for m14s, but the gas ones with recoil cost upwards of 1000$ new, plus crazy expensive magazines. CYMA make affordable electric ones but you wont have the simulated recoil. Your other option is the kjw kc02, which is a gas powered .22 variant. Theyre not exactly cheap at about 250 each, but theyre fairly reliable and accurate at 100ft. The mags are also only 30 each so you wont break the bank. They can also fit into most real .22 ruger wood stocks with a bit of modification to the stock if that is what your department uses."
airsoft,3cfwgp,nitemarez44,3,Tue Jul 7 16:42:24 2015 UTC,"Oh, right on. But $1000 for an M14? Wow haha I'll have to check with the department to see if we have a budget for that."

airsoft,3cfwgp,Nickvr628,3,Wed Jul 8 02:25:07 2015 UTC,CO2 blowback pistols have pretty good kick.
airsoft,3cfwgp,omgalbert3,2,Tue Jul 7 17:27:04 2015 UTC,"They can, but be aware of what model you get.  Often, a CO2-only GBB pistol will have proprietary magazines and parts, making it tough to use these in a rough manner when you cannot fix them easily and end up using them like disposable items."
airsoft,3cfwgp,Nickvr628,2,Tue Jul 7 17:31:13 2015 UTC,Very true.
airsoft,3cfwgp,omgalbert3,5,Tue Jul 7 18:18:57 2015 UTC,"Do you need rifle types, handgun types, or both?  Other things to think about:   There are only a handful of GBB replicas that give kick as powerful as the real thing, and not all of them are good quality.  Don't treat it as your number 1 factor, you don't want something that kicks hard and then breaks after a few rounds. Most GBBs will have working charging handle required for the bolt functions, yes.  Are you looking at rifles or handguns, or both? Don't factor out TM 100% just because of plastic material in some parts like the pistol slides, as their performance and manufacturing is very good, unless you require heavy weight as a completely necessary requirement. Most GBB rifle types will accept optics, but be aware that airsoft BBs can shatter the glass on them, even if they're real firearm grade optics.  You will want lens protectors bought or made for them. Same for pistols, glass needs to be protected but yes the pistols with rails or rail attachments you can put flashlights or lasers on them. Be aware that hard dropping GBB magazines can damage them, they usually cannot handle abuse like a real magazine can."
airsoft,3cfwgp,omgalbert3,3,Tue Jul 7 16:34:40 2015 UTC,"Edited. And yes, I hear TM performance is supreme stock. Sadly, we're looking for good performance and kick in one package."
airsoft,3cfwgp,OnwardsMrSnippy,6,Tue Jul 7 16:41:49 2015 UTC,"The USA specifically has a problem with getting airsoft Glock replicas due to lack of licensing and crackdown by Glock themselves.  A good alternative to this is the KWA ATP system.  While it looks different, it has the same Glock functions and control placements, approximate same feel, and fits Glock style holsters.  It takes legacy KWA/KSC type magazines in addition to its ""ATP"" type magazines.  I have seen several police trainings use KWA ATPs because of availability and similarity.  I don't know if any airsoft Mini-14s exist."
airsoft,3cfwgp,Shadowex3,6,Tue Jul 7 16:49:00 2015 UTC,"Can confirm, ATPs are a nice Glock substitute. KWA built them as a Glock trainer, and also to fill the airsoft market void left by Glock's takedowns. They did an overhaul on the outer appearance in order to avoid issues with the Glock legal team, but kept the shape and functionality. They handle very similarly, and ATPs even fit most Glock holsters."
airsoft,3cfwgp,needanacc0unt,4,Tue Jul 7 17:58:24 2015 UTC,"Airsoft guns function by storing compressed propane, Co2, or duster-gas in the magazine and releasing some to cycle the bolt and propel the BB.   Now yknow how real guns don't send people flying backwards like in the movies because physics would mean the shooter also gets knocked back just as hard as the target? Same thing here but going the other direction.  Our BB's are propelled with only a joule or two of force. And even if you got around the whole equal/opposite reaction thing our propellants just don't have the kind of pressure needed to simulate a real gun's level of recoil.  Airsoft guns aren't for training shooting skills, they're good for training everything around that. If you need to train someone to shoot a gun use simunitions. If you want to train someone to avoid getting shot, avoid shooting buddies, and/or avoid shooting themselves while doing various things at close ranges airsoft can work for you."
airsoft,3cfwgp,Kant_Lavar,2,Tue Jul 7 18:11:42 2015 UTC,"If you're in the US you are not going to find very many Glock airsoft guns. They are out there, but way more expensive because of how rare they are. If only Glock would actually license them out..."
airsoft,3cfwgp,needanacc0unt,3,Tue Jul 7 16:44:35 2015 UTC,I suspect that Glock won't share the glory with anyone else so they're just copyrighting everyone who uses their design? Lol.
airsoft,3cfwgp,WaddleWaddleMofo,4,Tue Jul 7 16:46:34 2015 UTC,"What's legally happening (I am not a lawyer, so this is my best understanding) is that Glock is enforcing what's called ""trade dress"" - basically, they're saying that anything that looks like a Glock without their permission is infringing on their gun designs. As part of this, they've issued a request to U.S. Customs to block import of anything that looks like a Glock but isn't coming in their shipments.  Now, all is not entirely lost. Two companies make guns that are fairly similar to a Glock. One, the KWA ATP, was purportedly designed as a training pistol for law enforcement, and in my inexpert opinion, stimulates a Glock well enough for shooting mechanics but is different enough that it won't be mistaken for an actual weapon.  The Echo 1 Timberwolf is a licensed replica of an aftermarket frame installed on a full size Glock. Again, it's fairly close to a real Glock for training, but visually different from the stock Glocks your department, I presume, issues.  If you can, you might consider going to a different model of pistol. First off, some people are less than impressed with Echo 1 and KWA guns, as they tend to have less than stellar aftermarket support for replacement parts. In addition, you should consider weather as a factor. Green gas, which is basically propane with a silicon lubricant added and no oderant, becomes less and less efficient below 60 degrees, and is pretty much useless once you get into the mid-40s. To combat this (without getting into the arcana of alternative gas supplies too much) some guns have magazines that can use common 12 gram CO2 cartridges - the KJW M9 is one example. Just a thought, anyway."
airsoft,3cfwgp,slimjim00,2,Tue Jul 7 17:24:02 2015 UTC,"Yeah they have some legal right on ANYTHING that remotely resembles their product, so I guess its against US law to import the airsoft guns, and that leaves us high and dry because they are all made in TW or China. I know some Canadian airsoft retailers sell the TM glocks, but I don't know if they would get xrayed or something upon entering the US, so if it does, customs can seize it. Fucking USA man!"
airsoft,3cfwgp,NATOMarksman,1 point,Tue Jul 7 16:58:42 2015 UTC,I've dealt with my local sheriffs department wanting to acquire airsoft Glocks for training when I use to work at an airsoft shop. The one big issue both parties had was that the sheriffs wanted to use their Safariland holsters but none of the airsoft Glocks were the correct dimensions to what they were replicating. I believe the sheriffs were rocking G22/G17 holsters and the airsoft G17s were too big to fit so nothing worked out unfortunately

airsoft,3cfwgp,magusopus,6,Tue Jul 7 18:37:08 2015 UTC,"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_Enforcement_Exploring  Simunitions would probably be cost prohibitive for that kind of program, since it would cost $500 per Glock conversion kit (not including the cost of replacements or the inconvenience of taking duty pistols out of service for this purpose, since the department apparently doesn't have a force-on-force training program already) and cost about the same as standard ammo at 61 cents per round. They don't offer Mini-14 Simunition kits either.   With airsoft, the ammo, powerplant, and initial cost are significantly lower and there's not as much liability involved.   Then again, I suppose they could just remove the firing pin from duty pistols and use snap caps to practice manual of arms for even cheaper, so maybe the whole thing is pointless."

Costs around $90 and mags are usually $23-$28 depending on if you catch a sale.  Durability would be pretty high for me.  I've owned it for around a year now, and it has been dropped, stepped on, accidentally kicked and has only needed a trigger sear and nozzle replacement after nearly 15k rounds (3 mags with a heavy trigger finger and  pretty sure the nozzle was because someone using it dropped it while firing.

airsoft,3cilu4,Cernan,1 point,Wed Jul 8 05:00:28 2015 UTC,"Ive thought about this gun too, but its older than the MK18 and the new SR series thats coming out look really nice. The only issue I have with the CM16 above is I would want a full RIS rail stock if I could, Im not a big fan of the movable rail sections. And If I was to move to a full rail on the CM16, my only battery option would be a PEQ box with a lipo, and wouldnt I need a mosfet for that too?"
airsoft,3cilu4,zkid10,1 point,Wed Jul 8 05:27:57 2015 UTC,"This is my gun. It preforms perfectly, sans two problems. EVER. First, and foremost, after ~10 rounds, semi-auto will not fire, however full-auto works just fine, and the ROF is low enough that you can tap out individual rounds. Second, the fuse burned out after a few trips, but that is easily remedied by electrical taping the contacts together (which increased my ROF).  It fires at or above 400 FPS (the limit for Combat City Orlando for AEGs [Snipers have a 500 FPS limit with a minimum 100 ft engage distance]), and rarely drops below. It is completely metal except for the polymer handguard and stock. The gun is also, as a bonus, balanced correctly, allowing you to utilize the carry handle.  The downside of this weapon is that the M16 ironsights are not removable. You CAN get weaver rail mounts for them, such as this, which is what I have for mine, while mounting a Diamond Tactical Aimpoint sight. While it works well for close/medium range encounters, scopes are useless due to the extreme height that they are placed above the barrel.  Overall, I love my M4; it's accurate, has a decent ROF, nice weight, perfect balance, and is reliable, but there are some points that a (when I bought it) $200 gun can't touch."
airsoft,3cilu4,cstigerwright,1 point,Wed Jul 8 17:28:52 2015 UTC,I had the Mk18 Mod1 a little while back. Its Ok. My main issue with it was that it refused to feed. For instance the mag that it came with fed 1 in 8 shots. From what I've been told you can fix the feeding issue with the gun by putting some tape or something on the back of the magwell. Its sights are nice and It looks good for the most part. Mine shot out of the box at 340fps with .20s. For a newcomer though I would recommend any one of the ICS sport-lines as they are easy to upgrade.

airsoft,3ceocr,snakebitey,5,Tue Jul 7 17:31:24 2015 UTC,"Either flat-hop or G-hop would be your best options. On the spectrum of best performance, flat hop is definitely better than a conventional bucking, and G-hop is between a flat hop and an R-hop. Also, the complexity of the install is parallel with the preformance of your hop-up. So, the better you hop preforms, the more time and work will be put into it.  Now, with that in mind, I'm going to give you a simple overview of all four types of hop up. (Regular bucking<flat-hop<G-hop<R-hop). Once you know what these generally are, then I would suggest using the searchbar here, and google/YouTube, to find out more about them, and how to properly install them. But anyway, here it goes.  Regular buckings:  You probably already know this, but these are a cylindrical peices of rubber with a ""mound"" on the inside of the tube, that lines up with a square hole in the inner barrel, which lines up with a nub held by a hop arm. The arm puts pressure on the nub, which puts pressure on the mound, which puts pressure on the bb. This causes the bb to fly further, because physics (backspin = lift, completely simplified). Great. But it can only put so much pressure on the bb, with it only has one point of contact. Also, the bb can be sent down different paths down the barrel, because it isn't centered every time.  So, flat-hop improves on that concept, by providing a more flat/even surface to impart backspin on the bb, thus improving consistency, and potentially providing more pressure, to get more backspin on more massive  bbs (eg. .25s vs .20s). Now, one might ask, what is a flat hop? It is essentially a regular bucking, without the mound, and a square nub instead of a cylindrical one. Yay, so now we can lob bbs further, but the accuracy remains a slight problem. It can be made better.  So, we come to G-hop. We realise that the bb needs to be contured in order to create a more consistent flight path. So, we keep the original flat hop idea, but cut a patch out of a different bucking, in the shape of the inner barrel's window, glue it in there. Then we slip a flat bucking on top, put the square nub in there, and call it good. But is still doesn't completely conture the bb, so there is still a bit too much variation.  And finally, we come to R-hops. They are essentially a soft piece of tubing, cut and sanded to essentially become a part of the inner barrel, filling in what was cut out. This provides a near perfect conture of the bb, and allows for even pressure on the bb,  and therefore more backspin than the others. Although, this one takes the most time and attention to detail. (But I still suggest giving it a try. 10in of tubing is like 3 bucks, and you have nothing to loose.)  So, there's your answer, in the longest form possible.  TLDR: Do a flat hop or G-hop. Look it up."

If that's the case, sometimes it's easier to put the top half of the handguard on first, then the bottom half.

Is this impeding performance in any way? I've heard of some people sanding and buffing them out. I'm interested in doing this, but I'm afraid it might make my BCG too loose in the upper, leading to even more problems. Is this a reasonable concern or am I overthinking this?   2) The loading nozzle has a very small hole broken into the bottom, near the intake hole, presumably from a lodged bb. I've checked, and I'm fairly certain that it does not affect my air seal in any way. Still, is there anything else I should be worried about from this break?   3) My biggest problem is with my awful magazines. These will get anywhere from 5 to 20 shots off before running out of gas. They don't leak to my knowledge, but they do have a really stupid engineering flaw: the fill valve needle is wider than the hole in green gas cans. Could that be my issue? Why am I getting such poor gas efficiency? Would a low flow nozzle help out with this issue? (Keep in mind I have pretty low FPS currently, can't give an exact number as I haven't chronoed in a while) should I just go for broke and get new mags? If so, what WA style mags are good?

airsoft,3ceocr,jules_fait_fer,2,Tue Jul 7 14:33:17 2015 UTC,1) sanding out and smoothing the inside of receiver will only do u good... The amount of material removed vs the friction is well worth it. If ur bcg is really loose because of removing some paint then it's the receiver out of spec  2) if ur air seal is fine then it shouldn't be a problem... As long as it feeds and shoots the other things on the bcg/nozzle are just cosmetic   3) most likely your gas efficient is caused by the extra friction for the bcg and the extra paint... If it's not the mag or the paint then ur #2/nozzle is probably fcked

I'm not sure it's the correct name, but the trigger bar will stick up instead of staying pushed down when the slide cycles, causing it to pinch the slide and not move forward. It might or might not be linked with another issue with the hammer: sometimes when the trigger is pulled, it will not reset and will stay midway to the reset position (only happens visibly when pulling the trigger when the gun is not loaded with gas). Anyhow, this issue with the bar sticking caused a catastrophic malfunction, and my slide broke on that side. Luckily, Impulse101 exists and I already have my new slide with me. Here are some pictures that illustrate the problem. What could be causing this? Has a spring worn out?      Might be worth noticing that this issue with the trigger sticking happend ever since I got it, but it did not worry me much at that time because the gun functioned properly on every other aspect (besides the slide not always locking back on empty, due to a cracked piece on the nozzle). I've had two of these, it's my favorite pistol so far, and it has worked flawlessly and solid aside from these issues, for over a year."

airsoft,3cfqew,trllz0722,4,Tue Jul 7 15:45:56 2015 UTC,"When you leave the propane and the magazine connected, they will naturally balance so that they both have the same pressure. It's like the two tanks have become one tank, until you disconnect them again.  The magazine can take it, so don't worry about leaving them connected too long."
airsoft,3cfqew,BrianWantsTruth,4,Tue Jul 7 16:31:08 2015 UTC,"Actually, you're not equalizing pressure in two gas chambers. You're pouring liquid propane from a largish container to a smaller one. This is why you have to hold the fill can upside down on top of your mag as you fill it.  Also, there are two opposing schools of thought on how long to fill a mag. The first is as described here so far, where you just fill the mag until the propane stops flowing.  The second school of thought is that you should fill for around 5 seconds. GHK/Samoon, the maker of the GHK GBBRs, is a strong advocate of the 5 second rule. The rationale as I understand it is that it is very easy to pour liquid propane out of a really full mag onto your gun o-rings and then have it expand there, freezing and damaging them. I also believe that having a small reservoir of liquid propane at the bottom of a largish gas chamber leaves more surface area of the mag exposed to the gas to warm it up as you fire, reducing cool down effects.  My experience has been that 5 seconds isn't quite enough for my propane adapter, but probably is with a can of green gas. My propane adapter has a metal fill nozzle with a fairly narrow gauge fill port through the middle of it so it takes longer to move the same amount of liquid as a green gas can.  This is with WE G39c and 5.1 HiCapa mags that hold 30 rounds.  With a good 6-8 second fill I always get a good 30 rounds out of the mag and I never have to worry much about whether to fill them for the next round. (I always just fill them again.)"

Yes, you should keep it locked away, but realistically, NABV isn't going to check, nor are they allowed to, police isn't going to check either, and if they do, you shouldn't let them in until they have a search warrant, which they're not going to get for checking if your airsoft gun is locked away(unless it was involved in a crime).  The rule is most likely incredibly vauge because the NABV had to agree to making the rule as a condition for legalisation, this rule is essentially just a way to force people to keep their replicas out of sight and not attracting attention.  You shouldn't be worried about them getting you when it's not locked away, but if you have only a couple of euros to spare, it's not expensive to just buy a box and put a padlock on it."

And even then there's a big chance that you won't be successful.   But man if you do get it to work you've accomplished something not many people dare to bother with as it's much more easy to just point and hold down a trigger.  Hope you'll give it an honest try and keep at it through what will undoubtedly be a frustrating challenge.  edit: Oh, cheaper? It can be slightly cheaper I suppose. But not that much.

airsoft,3ch2s6,zkid10,2,Wed Jul 8 01:37:23 2015 UTC,"I'd say yes, although the best bang for your buck might actually be a Cybergun FAMAS spring rifle.   I know that brand irks a lot of people here, but the FAMAS springer is actually very good; I can hit squirrels out to 60' with it and can keep my shots within a 1"" wide vertical shot pattern at the same distance. It requires no gas or other maintenance, and as long as you don't smack it into a tree, it's pretty sturdy. It also fires pretty fast considering its single shot, because the cocking lever is wide and easy to pull back. It's pretty much the optimal plinker, with aperture sights built-in for accuracy. I consider it the airsoft equivalent of the Red Ryder, at least from my experience with my particular gun.   Then again, with eye protection, you guys might not be able to appreciate the nice sights and accuracy, so the other option there would be UTG Everblast/DE M87 spring shotguns. Not as accurate, but they come with 190 round 'hi-caps' that you can just rip out as fast as you can rack the pump and pull the tirgger. They are even less sensitive to rough use, will fire any BB you put into them, and are hella fun to blast.   It depends on what you're looking for.

airsoft,3ch2s6,imarziali,1 point,Thu Jul 9 03:31:57 2015 UTC,"It's deceptive. Getting a pistol can be cheaper, if you intentionally restrict yourself to something silly like two spare mags, but it's also significantly less effective.   Most pistols are hard pressed to make it 50' without having rounds fly off into space, while most AEGs can easily hit people out to 100-150' out of the box with a predictable arc beyond that; this is because the longer barrel length gives the BB more time to develop and be stabilized from the backspin started by the hop-up bucking.   The blowback unit is also a problem, because in some cases, the blowback unit starts to unlock the slide before the BB leaves the barrel, negatively affecting accuracy.   Typical pistol magazines hold 25 rounds each. Typical AEG hi-caps hold 400, while typical mid-caps hold 170.   The AEG magazines are also 2-3 times cheaper than pistol magazines; for the price of three (or two, for the more expensive ones) spare pistol magazines (which is considered the minimum for people who run pistols), you can get a pile of seven AEG magazines in a bundle pack, for over a thousand rounds with mid-caps and thousands of rounds with hi-caps.   The AEGs can also fire on full automatic in short bursts and can expend the equivalent of several pistol magazines in a single suppression without having to wind or reload.   Pistols have a cooldown effect, where firing in rapid succession will massively reduce FPS and effective range, to the point that continued firing can actually jam the gun from insufficient gas pressure. If you want to hit something further than 15 feet, you will have to fire slowly, as slow as one shot per 3-4 seconds in some cases. If you only want to put plastic in the air, you can fire as fast as you want, but considering how few rounds you have and how many magazines you can carry, this isn't really a great option.  You can use CO2 to mitigate the cooldown issue somewhere, but many CO2 guns fire too hot for fields, and you have to expend the entire cartridge before removing it (or else the O-ring will tear from the dry, freezing cold gas shooting out from the cartridge). There are only a handful of trustworthy CO2 pistols out there, most of which are made by KJW (which is fine, but not if you want a particular model not offered by them).   Get either a G&G Combat Machine or CYMA AK (CM028 minimum, not their low-cost ones), and then decide where you want to go from there."
airsoft,3ch2s6,UncleTouchers,1 point,Tue Jul 7 22:19:02 2015 UTC,"Okay, you've convinced me that AEGs are more effective on the field.  But what about the backyard-style game? If I want to host a small party (5-10 people) would going for cheap pistols be better than cheap AEGs? I ask because I've been looking at the Umarex H&K USP CO2 NBB and might just give those out to the guests. What do you think?"
airsoft,3ch2s6,imarziali,1 point,Wed Jul 8 01:08:54 2015 UTC,"If you led with that, this thread might've gone differently.   Absolutely, I would opt for that NBB over cheap AEGs, because as finicky cheap NBBs are, they aren't anywhere near as finicky as cheap AEGs whose gearboxes are made of cheaper plastic than the handguards on the outside.   However, I would spend $10 more per pistol and get one of two Y&P NBBs instead: the M9 or the M1911, or perhaps some combination of both for whatever games you have in mind.   This is because these NBBs use propane, which is milder on the gun parts and will last longer if you intend to use them for more than one party or as gifts. Depending on how hot they shoot, you might even be able to field them (as secondaries, or primaries in CQB fields if you're good).   Then again, you (and any guests, if as gifts) would have to get one of these kits and a Coleman propane tank if you wanted to continue shooting it, while CO2 Powerlets are readily available at Walmart and most people would be okay if it broke, so it depends on what you intend for these pistols to be used for. If you intend to reuse these pistols, get the Y&Ps. If you intend for this to be a one-off thing, get the CO2 USP.   For whatever pistol you choose, get these holsters. There are others that cost $1-3 less, but this one is ambidextrous and is actually pretty good, since it has a thumb break and not a buckle. Ask them to wear belts.   And of course, provide safety glasses, tell them to wear thicker clothing, and not to aim for the head. The optimal face protection would be a polycarbonate faceshield, again for a few dollars more but with noticeable benefits.   Neat thing about propane-power is that once they get the pistol and the kit, all they need is a $3 Coleman propane tank and they are pretty set. If they want to buy spare magazines on their own, they're $20 each, and they can progress to bigger and better guns from there."

airsoft,3ch2s6,Mrmnbeowolve,3,Tue Jul 7 22:16:20 2015 UTC,I don't think he gets the entire point of the post.
airsoft,3ch2s6,imarziali,2,Tue Jul 7 22:19:10 2015 UTC,something tells me that too

airsoft,3ch2s6,imarziali,2,Tue Jul 7 22:18:33 2015 UTC,"No, because they aren't practical to be used as a primary for field use. Especially for someone who is just beginning."

airsoft,3chv3i,JackalThePowerful,2,Thu Jul 9 15:15:46 2015 UTC,"I'm going to start. How long should I jog for? Until I can't go any further at all, or until I'm a little past tired?"
airsoft,3chv3i,TheKrazeTrain,1 point,Thu Jul 9 16:15:30 2015 UTC,"So the best thing for you to start doing would be to run when you're not on the field.  Start with a little at a time, mile or two. Then move to running a little more distance. You don't have to run fast, running will help improve your cardiovascular system which will help you with the current endurance issue.  Another tip: shed any weight you don't need on your kit. It'll help tremendously."
airsoft,3chv3i,Automobilie,2,Thu Jul 9 16:45:02 2015 UTC,"Shed any weight you don't need on your kit   Good thing I don't run a kit in the summer. However, I have been and I think that's where most of my issues come from. I'm going to begin running in a couple weeks, as next week I'm in St. Augustine. I'm going to go out this weekend without a kit on, and see how well I do.  EDIT: Forgot to update this. I did amazingly well without a kit. I could run a multitude of guns comfortably in the 95-100 degree heat."
