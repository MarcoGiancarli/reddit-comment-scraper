Not that Juice was a bad film, but this song is killer.    I particularly like, lyrically, where it starts, and then where it finishes.   This is the sort of song you play to someone who says hip hop has no value.  I mean, I know most people have given up on that fight, but...this is as good as it gets.  Unfortunately, this particular YouTube clip, to no one's satisfaction, censors shit, stupidly.  To whoever decided that needed to happen -- especially in what is, in essence, a morality tale not unlike Ice-T's ""High Roller"" or BDP's ""Love's Gonna Get Cha"" - I hope you get a bad rash or something.

Hip-hop is more laid-back/jazz samples/""conscious"" (ie socially conscious, less street-oriented) lyrics and rhymes. If you want to keep going back, check out the early 90s when hip-hop made it to the suburbs/college kids/etc., and this style started to form(ATCQ, De La Soul, Brand Nubian, Digable Planets, UMCs, yada yada).  Going forward I would say the Roots, and the neo soul Philly scene, kept this style of more chill, melodic hip-hop going in the mid-to-late 90s. Also, LA had the Good Life Cafe scene (Freestyle Fellowship/Aceyalone), and the bay had Hieroglyphics/Del.   Go from there."

90sHipHop,3bek9c,thefroggfather,3,Mon Jun 29 05:28:36 2015 UTC,"AEOM is a great album, it's a classic that many rappers imitated its style well into the 2000s. Its by far his most influential album.  However Me Against the World is often considered his magnum opus due to how dark an introspective it is. By both fans, and critics.  Example reviews:   In a contemporary review, Cheo H. Coker at Rolling Stone called the album Shakur's best and said it was ""by and large a work of pain, anger and burning desperation — it is the first time 2Pac has taken the conflicting forces tugging at his psyche head-on"" - Cheo H. Coker, Rolling Stone ""This may be the first hip-hop blues LP,"" - Mark Hall, Select ""[Shakur's] most thematically consistent, least self-contradicting work. It may not be his definitive album, but it just might be his best"" - Steve Huey. Allmusic ""is not only the quintessential Shakur album, but one of the most important rap albums released in the 1990s as a whole"". - Steve ""Flash"" Juon, Rap Review   Crtically speaking from an artistic point of view, Me Against the World ranks higher than All Eyez on Me. Both albums have became classics, both albums imitated, and All Eyez on Me certaintly more popular because its the more ""fun"" album. But Me Against the World sounded very, very special when it was released. Nothing sounded like it at the time. Same could be said for AEOM, but it just wasn't as ""dark""."

Below are excerpts of the write-up I posted with the freestyle (full version here) for anybody that's not familiar with E.C. Illa (Chicago) or Mykill Miers (Los Angeles.) These excerpts pertain to their ties to the underground scenes in their cities in the '90s.   If you’re not familiar with E.C. Illa, he’s an emcee from the North side of Chicago and a founder of the Ill State Assassins, a rap and production crew that included The Legendary Traxster and Toxic, among others. He was likely on the Wake Up Show promoting his 1997 sophomore album Power Moves. The lead single from Power Moves was Old School Tactics featuring Rhymefest who might be known best these days as the co-writer of Jesus Walks by Kanye West.  Mykill Miers was a regular on The Wake Up Show (I’ve heard him participate in cyphers with KRS, Pharoahe Monch, O.C. & others) and well-known to underground heads for being a part of the legendary Western Hemisfear crew with Ras Kass, Meen Green and Vooodu. Check out this video for info on the crew, it’s extremely informative and I’d recommend it to any fan of West Coast underground hip-hop of the ’90s."

It was hosted by Kevvy Kev and I believe Sway hosted it for a while before starting The Wake Up Show with King Tech. I don't know the name of the emcee rhyming with Miilkbone.  After the freestyle is the premiere of the single Miilkbone was in studio to promote, Keep It Real.  If you recognize the beat from Keep It Real, it's probably because it was the backdrop of a famous freestyle session by Big L and Jay-Z on the Stretch Armstrong and Bobbito Show later that year.  Speaking of Stretch & Bobbito, Bobbito was visiting San Francisco and is in studio as well, not sure why, but at the end Kevvy Kev asks him a few questions including one about his ""underground hip hop thing."""

He was a member of probably one of the earliest popular rap groups ""Advanced Chemistry"".  He was influenced by American Rap and decided to bring that style of music to Germany. He is considered a pioneer and legend among rap artists and still gets honorable mentions in todays german rap.   He just released one single Album ""Blauer Samt"" which is one of the most infamous rap albums ever created. He lyrics are mostly focused on his own past and his own thoughts about various topics.   In this song MC Torch is praising his youth and his city of birth ""Heidelberg"". He describes how beautiful(""Wunderschön""') it is. He references memories of his own past and how deeply he is connected to the city.  He samples Master Aces - Beautiful in this song."

Little brother  Little brother has only one wish, grow up That's why he persists to become wild from 10 years old Become an adult, with the TV news as a guide And slug the disagreers (1)  In the past, when big brother was a kid It was sheer madness with Snow White and the Seven Dwarves Now the dwarves have kicked Snow White out and hit And beat up guys like in Mortal Kombat  At 13 he already loves money, greedy But his pockets are empty so he acts like a big boss in the dancing parties, that have now become celebrations, no more syrup Little brother wants beers  I don't think it was intentional, but adults - that's for sure - Indirectly showed that harming was a good thing Tomorrow his exercice books will be full of deletions Little brother smokes spliffs and break cars  (chorus) Little brother doesn't go to playgrounds anymore He still toddles yet wants seven league boot Little brother wants grow up too fast But he's forgotten that vain is running, little brother  Little brother dreams about big cars, clothes and dough About a reputation of bad boy, for all of those, he'd steal the moon He commits fellony after fellony without caring About the harm he's done, while asking for respect  He doesn't care much about what tomorrow will bring About giving certain people reasons to despise him In his head the cathode ray tube Smothered the vibrations of the African drums  No more school bag, he wouldn't know what to do with it He doesn't play marbles anymore, he wanna play guns (2) Little brother threw his toy soldiers away to become a warrior and think about the loot he'll amass  (chorus)  Journalists make fashions, school violence already existed When I was young there were rackets, punch-ups and damages The teachers' windshields were also broken with baseball bats They were getting muddled with cutters  But speaking about it in the newsbroadcast becomes usual It prints in the retina like a normal situation And if little brother wants to make the news He only has to imitate what he saw before 8:30 pm  Damn, in the 80's it was a fact but now Those journalists made the normality out of it And I don't think that little brother is worse than before Only overexposed to publicity and violence  For the older, the kids are the best lemon The number one target for market products And to be sure that he obtains it Little brother secures himself with a gun at the belt  They know who you are when they see what you possess Little brother knows it, and keeps that fact in mind Money would open a gate to heaven for him As easily as his screwdriver opens car doors  Grandstanding is all he desires It looks better, when you wear a Giorgio Armani Worried about how people see him In spite of his young age, little brother smokes to appear older  He would take the fortune highway and doesn't realize that he can lose his shirt he's only out of his egg and already little brother wanna be bigger than a steer   IAM is the only french 90s rap group I know of. Notice the WuTang Clan - C.R.E.A.M sample in the chorus. Tbh I don't know much info about the artists... Probably somebody can add some further info?"

Also, there are plenty of 5-6 min examples in here that fly in the face of your observation. We also have the data for the ratio of the unique words to song length. That's a much, much different list, which several people have requested, and I'd like to assemble that one too. But don't ask a number to mean two things. This is but one way to order the data."

Both just awesome versions of a great track"

It looked like it was shot from a surveillance camera. I've only seen the video twice. Both times were late at night on a public access channel here in the L.A. area back in the mid 90s.  I also remember when the crew was on Rap City and Masta Ace told them they needed a censor to be ready to bleep out the female emcees verse cuz she was going to cuss up a storm.

They could have canceled the show but both emcees threw down regardless. 88 keys performed every song on his debut (which hadn't dropped yet) and gave us the back story behind each track. Ace then came out and said ""it doesn't matter how many people are here now. This is a moment in time we are all sharing,"" and commenced to rip as if it was a full house. Acey performed songs from the book of human language through all balls and accepted eclectic. He did a few verses from freestyle fellowship and he even spit off the dome.

90sHipHop,31czo4,DingusDeluxe,3,Fri Apr 3 22:22:08 2015 UTC,"This is a great counter-example to people saying gangster rap, or rap in general promotes violence.  The reality is that a lot of songs are quite graphic depictions of the gangster life. In this song, Snoop Dogg dies violently while his girlfriend is pregnant with his child. Snoop Dogg cries out for God but the devil finds him instead - among the Christian African-American community, such imagery would be quite distressing. He experiences some wealth, but after saying a typical prayer before sleeping he ends up with his life taken away from him. He intimidates (mad dogs) other cell mates because he no longer cares what happens to him. The song ends with the chilling imagery of Snoop Dogg awake to the sound of shanks being made after his 21 year old friend was stabbed in the neck.    Rap glorifies the gangster life omg"

90sHipHop,2yen8p,knowyourpast,1 point,Mon Mar 9 03:40:03 2015 UTC,"There's only one line in there aimed at Ice Cube.     ""Started with five and, yo, one couldn't take it. / So now there's four 'cause the fifth couldn't make it.""   Now ""Message for B.A.""?  That's an Ice Cube diss track, even if it is more of a skit."
90sHipHop,2yen8p,furiousmiked,1 point,Mon Mar 9 14:55:33 2015 UTC,Yea I was being sensationalist. The 100 Miles And Running EP had an anti-Ice Cube theme throughout the tracks.
