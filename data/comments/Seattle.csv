Seattle,3e2lt6,TheOdyssey_,2,Tue Jul 21 15:30:04 2015 UTC,"I don't think that's how El Nino works. El Nino/La Nina is a warm mass of water that moves back and forth across the Pacific, based on how the Trade Winds blow.

Seattle,3e2lt6,readedit,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:29:45 2015 UTC,"If an El Nino is simply a warm ocean front, and the ocean is getting warmer, what makes it not certain this won't just continue to scale this way? It's been doing it the last decade after all"
Seattle,3e2lt6,TheOdyssey_,2,Tue Jul 21 19:31:31 2015 UTC,"Just to back up, I want to mention again that I was just commenting that drought will not be the norm. La Nina will return no matter what happens to the ocean temps and with it will be moisture again. It very well may scale but that has not been proven to be the cause of what's happening now. Increased ocean temps could also prove to be the case in time, but from what I have read, they can't attribute it now. Not every extreme weather event can be chalked up to climate change.

Seattle,3e321s,seariously,2,Tue Jul 21 16:42:52 2015 UTC,Looks like the truck was making a turn to close to the lamp post with the signal lights mounted on it.

Seattle,3e32zz,lumpytrout,4,Tue Jul 21 16:11:26 2015 UTC,"I just finished a 3 day crabbing binge practically within sight of Golden Gardens (but on the west side of the sound...that is as specific as I will get about my ""secret"" crabbing grounds!) where we limited each day, gorged on crab, and brought a dozen home to share out with friends.  They are sooo plentiful thanks to WDFW for their excellent management of this resource.  We would get a limit in one pull of one pot, having to sort out the smaller legal males and just keeping 6.5 - 7.25 inchers.   Some other tips (I read through your instructable quickly so maybe you have some of these):  Weight your pots with rebar or the current will sweep them away.  Every year we see pots swept from one side of the sound to the other and get lost.  They are never weighted.  Horse clams make excellent bait and are plentiful on any sandy flat at low tide.  Just smash em up.  I am a big proponent of cleaning before cooking, and cooking by steaming with salt water from the sound.  Lay them on their backs, give them a good hard whack with a cleaver right in the middle, hitting the mouth parts, and they are stunned.  Fold each side to the middle and rip out two clean halves, leaving the back and 90% of the butter behind.  A few good flicks of the wrist and the remaining butter is gone.  Rip the gills off, and it is ready to cook 18 minutes at full steam.  Crab comes out much cleaner, and you can fit way more crab in the pot as opposed to cooking them whole.  Chill in the sound by dunking for 5 minutes or so.  Soaking overnight will get a good haul in the morning but introduces a higher risk of theft.  From your photos it looks like you get a lot of rock crab.  Time to switch locations!  We get about 10 dungeness per one rock crab and never keep the rock crab.  No meat in them really outside of the claws.  Crab is highly perishable so keep it on ice once cooked and toss when in doubt.  Best to eat within a day or two at most.  Here is a good article as well with some interesting strategies around managing the bait scent trail:  http://pacnwboat.us7.list-manage.com/track/click?u=f63adc3f5c46ce9a126513651&id=a0979f38ec&e=22f52a094d"

Ballard is a large neighborhood by Seattle standards, when individuals make it popular prices rise due to strong demand.  It's not class war, it's the basic economic principle of supply and demand.  Supply is short, demand is high.        I'm sure you feel sad about all the poor lumberjacks and prostitutes who had to move away due to the rise of fishing terminals and people profiting off the gold rush.  Alas neighborhoods evolve with changing industries and people get priced out.  Not exactly a new concept.       I see you still have nothing intelligent to add here.

What's causing the issues is the inability of drivers to query for and pay a toll easily. The way it is now, you cannot pay a toll without the mailed notice. So if you use the bridge today, instead of paying it off when you come back home you have to remember to check your mail until you receive a notice and then promptly pay it off before the deadline expires. If you are one of those people who doesn't use mail for anything important or if you moved recently then you are setting yourself up for trouble. Why can't people just query for their vehicle registration plate and pay any outstanding tolls immediately. Easiest way to resolve this is to give people the ability to receive email notices/text messages once a month listing any outstanding tolls. Also provide a way to pay a toll without having to wait for any bullshit notices. This also saves the govt. mailing expenditures and might encourage people to pay their tolls more quickly."

Some guy in the U District tells he wife he's going to Cap Hill to go bar hopping with the guys but his wife finds he crossed 520 that night.  Users should need to authenticate themselves as the vehicle owner by using information off of the registration or driver's license id or something like that then set up an account which they can use to check their status."

Seattle,3dza1r,vatothe0,3,Mon Jul 20 23:36:19 2015 UTC,"I guess that it enables people to see when others crossed the bridge based on the license plate. But even with the current system the wife in your case can still find out that her husband is lying if she gets hold of the mailed receipt. So I am not sure of how much additional protection it is adding there.   If they can add something like license plate + VIN or license plate + license number of the registered owner it would make it difficult for outsiders to see the information. It can still allow your wife to see it but I don't think even the current system is good at protecting your privacy from your wife. Or they can provide the ability to send notices via SMS or email instead of the unreliable mail. Faster, cheaper and more reliable."
Seattle,3dza1r,arererere,2,Mon Jul 20 23:41:44 2015 UTC,"Not really concerned about this scenario - a mailed bill is just as much of a potential problem here.

Seattle,3dza1r,despalicious,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:04:50 2015 UTC,"The way it is now, you cannot pay a toll without the mailed notice.   This is not true.  Twice I've accidentally crossed the 520 toll bridge (thanks, Google Maps / unmarked Arboretum exit) and both times I was able to pay the toll by calling up customer service and giving them the crossing date and my plate # and confirming my registration info and giving a credit card # over the phone.  Good thing, too, as I was registered out of state and the paper bills were mailed out to that address.  Not the easiest thing to do to call up and do it manually, nor the most secure payment method, but it's certainly better than getting a massive fine."

It's almost always the last option.  (Although I imagine this isn't the case for people in the 'burbs.)  As the middle class gets more and more options, I don't know if everyone will be as enthusiastic about funding busses.  And in 10 or 20 years I think driverless cars will be another huge blow to busses.  Hopefully we have a good rail system by then."

I have legs and I can walk so I walk to the bus station and I take the bus to SLU. I suffer usually for about an hour in the morning and anywhere from an hour to an hour and a half on the way home, usually standing. This is really grating on my wife because I am never home consistently so it throws off my entire at home routine. Sometimes, like on friday last week, I waited for an hour for my bus to show up at Howell and 9th. It is supposed to run every 15 minutes. I stood there until I had the last standing spot on a bus at 5:15, 1 hour and 15 minutes after I got out there.   This really fucking sucks. Like, I actually thought about buying a car just so I wouldn't have to stand. The problem is that I would end up just idling in traffic, wasting gas, polluting the air, and being just as pissed off about the long commute time as I am about it now. Why the fuck seriously during rush hour do they not make the express lanes bus only. I swear to christ on a bicycle if they did that EVERYONE would take the bus. You would just cruise by those fucking suckers in their cars going 5MPH while you are going by at 65 with this totally seattle smug sense of superiority. My life would become at least 2 to 3 times easier with that. I would show up to work more instead of watching traffic wondering how much its going to suck that day and WFH instead. I would be giving metro more money because their service is better. Bus lines wouldn't be as fragile because nobody is in their way.   Just sounds like common sense to me."

That said, I believe the solution to the ""slower than driving"" problem is to reduce the stop frequency (express buses, Light Rail, for instance) and also create grade separated or transit-only lanes. Everyone (including car-only people) benefit from the choices that bus riders make, since those choices effectively reduce pollution in our city air and traffic on our streets and parking problems for cars. A strong public transit system also lets apartments use less parking, which in turn lowers the cost of housing for everyone. (apartment underground parking spaces cost ~$30,000 per parking space).  There are exciting and radical proposals for how we can move Seattle from a suburban bus route schedule to an urban bus route schedule. Thanks to increasing density and a multipolar city, it's possible for us to increase service (hours, frequency, and make buses faster) and simplify routes. Check out this example of how restructuring is hard and the benefits it can offer. Here's an extremely radical proposal for 15 minute bus frequency city-wide and a realistic proposal to restructure after the UW light rail opens."

When I worked in Magnolia, it took me about 40-60 minutes to drive to work every day in clear-to-moderate traffic. One day I had to take the bus because I got in a car wreck near work.

Maybe worst case scenario...I live in bothell and it usually takes me 40-45 min to get from the kenmore park and ride to downtown Seattle during rush hour. I've driven 10 or so times and it has taken an hour every time, if not more and you're not even taking into consideration how much it costs to park (at the very least $160/month and even at that you're getting a steal...like that's unheard of)  If you're driving during rush hour, here is absolutely no way you are getting to Seattle in 20-45 min.  The worst is the ride back from downtown...I usually have to wait for multiple buses to catch one that isn't full. The whole process usually takes an hour and a half leaving work at 5:10...THAT fucking blows and I'm sure Magnolia is even worse because that isn't a hub.  We need designated public transit lanes.

The evening rush hour is more finnicky and sometimes takes up to 1hr 45.

The busses are frequently late, which is fine, I just leave earlier. But I've never sat down on my commute to work. The bus is constantly overcrowded and often skips stops since it's over capacity. I've had busses deny me and several other people needing to get to work because of the overflow. This seems to be the case going home too, unless I take a different bus that takes 2x as long (but at the end of the day, I like sitting on the bus and staring out the window, with no destination that I have to get to at a certain time.)   Also, uncrowded busses have seen me and driven past a couple times, despite the fact that I never shook my head, broke eye contact, etc. to make the driver think I didn't want to get on.

Seattle,3e0q5u,NrdRage,18,Tue Jul 21 14:56:41 2015 UTC,"The reasons for me are simple:  -It takes longer than driving.  By a lot.  -The nearest bus stop is an exit down the highway from me.  So I'm going into my car, anyways  -My car smells nicer  -My car is more comfortable  -My car runs on my schedule, not someone else's  -I can play my music as loud as I want (I wear cans all day at work, my head hurts by the end of the day, I don't want to wear them on my way home)  -Perhaps most importantly:  It's the only time I'm alone.  Think about the average person for a second.  They are with at least 1 other person (usually at least 2 once kids are factored in) all morning till they leave the house.  Then you're surrounded by people for 9 hours as you're at the office.  Then you go home, and the same people from the morning are there, and you remain with them until you go to sleep (where someone is next to you), and you repeat the whole process the next day.  Now don't get me wrong, I adore the person and half-person in the house and enjoy my time with them.  I even like most of the people I work with all day.  It drains, though.  But that 30 minutes to work and 30 minutes from work is literally the only time I have all day to just be alone with my thoughts.  That one glorious hour of respite from queries and conversations and having to be aware of potential verbal engagements and having to be available in some capacity is all most of us get every day.   Not to offend, but the last thing I want to do with that magnificent hour (edit:  2 hours, cause bus time) is spend it surrounded by a bunch of assholes on a bus."

Car payment + insurance + maintenance + gas + parking (home and work) can easily total over $1000 per month.  What you mean by not accounting for opportunity cost?  A car is generally a depreciating asset, so financially you're better off investing."
Seattle,3e0q5u,MrJadaml,9,Tue Jul 21 02:27:54 2015 UTC,"/u/jollyshroom may be referring to the fact that when you're riding the bus you aren't earning money. ie: ""I'm a lawyer who bills out at $240/hour. Since the bus takes 15 minutes longer than driving, taking bus actually costs me $60!""  Almost no one actually has a job where you can actually recoup the financial opportunity cost of commuting faster. If someone does, please let me know because I would like to work there too.   In terms of the non-financial opportunity costs, it's hard to estimate. Many riders will ""profit"" riding the bus, because they can use the time doing something they enjoy more than driving like relaxing, reading, gaming, or texting.   Maybe other people value home time more than free time on the bus and there is a real non-financial cost to being on the bus, like trying to get home before your kids go to sleep.   It's hard to know/quantify the non-financial side, but I believe it's clear that the bus is almost always financially cheaper than driving."
Seattle,3e0q5u,blushingapple,4,Tue Jul 21 03:03:00 2015 UTC,"I can and do work on the bus, because I'm not responsible for giving 100% of my attention to not killing someone else on the road.

After nine years, I am finally breaking down and buying a car next month.  If you want to keep a job in this town, you can't rely on Metro.    I had to drop out of night classes at school two years ago because in one of our busiest corridors where I lived, Pike/Pine, busses wouldn't even stop during rush hour- I would have five or more busses of four routes passing me that were so full they couldn't pick up more people.

Seattle,3e0q5u,trentsgir,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:53:00 2015 UTC,"If you own your own business, there is ALWAYS an opportunity cost. If you're on salary or have a fixed number of hours on hourly wages, there is a very small opportunity cost (mostly of investing/saving the little money you save) plus the one of your own spare time and convenience. If you place a high value on your spare time/convenience, you'll have to balance that with the cost of commuting. Taken to the extreme, you can pay for a helicopter transport (and pay to install a helipad, permits, etc) which will get you to work in 5 minutes, or you can spend 3 hours walking to work. Most of us choose somewhere in between.  Every decision we make is at the expense of another. By deciding to live in one city, you are denying yourself the opportunity to live in another city. By choosing to marry one spouse, you are saying ""no"" to every other person in the world. By spending your money on commuting, you are denying yourself of spending (or saving, which is actually spending for the future self) that money elsewhere."

And even if I were to be stuck in traffic, I could read/listen to music/nap on a bus versus staring at the road and silently raging in a car."

The Tukwila Goodwill location has an ok selection but less. The Salvation Army store across from the stadium usually has one or two things from each category, and an occasional tent or raft. It is also where old cable modems and wireless routers go to die.   I got swim fins and a dive mask for like $6.00 each instead of $35.00 at Renton Goodwill. Lots of baseball, football, and golf stuff at that one, too."

Seattle,3dzylf,ManyFacedSeahawk,57,Mon Jul 20 22:06:15 2015 UTC,To those cheering that we won't be spending public money remember the leading proposal from the Tukwila group was going to be 100% privately financed. I think we lost out on an asset for our region today and it's too bad.
Seattle,3dzylf,belgiumania,11,Tue Jul 21 00:48:22 2015 UTC,"Not trolling: don't arenas typically start out with something like, 'Oh yeah, we have the money!' and end up something like, 'OK, so you guys owe us some money...'?"
Seattle,3dzylf,onlyinseattle,4,Tue Jul 21 04:52:09 2015 UTC,"From whose perspective?  Modern arena deals are overwhelmingly financed by local governments. It basically goes like this:  If your team is popular, making money, and resides in a large media market (I'm talking top-5), then it's likely that a new arena will be financed privately, because the owners really have no leverage with the local government.  If your team is unpopular, not making money, or resides in a small media market, then the ownership (and usually the league) will lobby the local government to pay for a new arena. They do this by promising jobs (not the best claim, studies show most arena-related job growth is temporary construction-based employment) and/or by threatening relocation. It helps to have a larger media market with a thirst for a team. In the NBA this has been Seattle. The NHL has Vegas and Quebec City, although now they're likely to get expansion teams. The NHL could very likely use Seattle as a relocation threat in the future as well. The NFL has LA, and MLB teams usually don't relocate, their last one was in 2005 when Montreal moved to Washington D.C., but there hadn't been a relocation in 33 years before that. It's much more difficult to relocate a baseball team because of the farm system as well."
Seattle,3dzylf,warox13,2,Tue Jul 21 05:08:46 2015 UTC,From what I've seen they usually try to hold the city ransom from the start and negotiate to taking a little less public money by the end.

It says that if there was an NBA contract that the project would receive 200 mill in private funding, but that an NHL contract would not trigger that proposed private funding. Perhaps I am missing it  Edit: also, looks like an avg stadium built after 2000 costs around 500 mill. So I'm not seeing at all where you're getting the notion this was completely private."

Of course, once Clay Bennet started moving the team, everyone got outraged.  I tell you just like I'd tell a small child...  ""You weren't playing with it.  Don't cry when we give your toy to someone who will play with it and enjoy it."""
Seattle,3dzylf,mister_skippy,-1,Tue Jul 21 05:18:26 2015 UTC,"Well, if you wanna be condescending about it, I'll tell you like I'd tell a small child.   ""Not everyone can afford to go to an NBA game, so the best they can do to participate is watch the games on TV. You know those times when they stop showing the game and give us short video clips of people using different kinds of stuff? Those are called commercials. Companies pay more for commercials when more people are watching. The money they pay for those commercials is part of the team business. Do you know what happens when we watch? That's two more people watching! Yes, so we can help the team make money add best as we can by watching as often as we can.""  So you can get off your high horse, Schultz was a shitty owner and a huge reason the team left town. If he had managed the contracts better, he could have capitalized on the 13th largest TV market in the country.   The Seahawks, for instance made $226 million in TV ads last season, and that was only for games that were on national TV. They made money on games that were only shown in areas course to Seattle on top of this huge amount.   But who am I to judge? Fuck all those people who decided to buy groceries and pay bills! They should have emptied their savings to buy tickets to watch terrible basketball! How dare they complain when the team leaves town when their children could have just like, you know, eaten less for a few years."
Seattle,3dzylf,furious_20,-2,Tue Jul 21 05:37:20 2015 UTC,"Now that you bring up the Seahawks...  Article in the news last week that Seattle is SIXTH-FROM-THE-BOTTOM when it comes to spending money to support the Super Bowl-winning Seahawks.  They based this on market size, income, win/loss record, etc.  And even for a team like the Hawks, Seattle isn't supporting them even close to the level of the Cowboys or Patriots.  Sorry, but Seattle is a very fickle sports market.  Always has been, always will.  Mariners losing?  Stadium's half empty.  Sonics not playing well, same thing.  The Hawks have an advantage that they have comparatively few home games so most people watch them on TV.  But let them lose for a few seasons and do you think anyone will be buying their jerseys at the team store or cramming the bars on game day?  Nope.  Seattle is not a sports town.  They want to be.  They tell everyone who will listen that they are.  But they are not.  Compare the M's to the Cubs...  Who are the REAL fans?  (Hint, it's not us.)  We had a team that was losing money, in a city that didn't care, with an owner who didn't want to keep pouring good money after bad.  It's not a conspiracy or an evil plot.  It's a fickle, self-entitled city that wants to have the team just so nobody else can have it.  (Case and point, keeping the Sonics name when the team moved.)  Is Seattle a horrible place without a basketball team?  Nope.  Will I still get an excellent cup of coffee?  Yep.  It's done.  Let it go."

It's a fickle, self-entitled city that wants to have the team just so nobody else can have it. (Case and point, keeping the Sonics name when the team moved.)   That's a rather narrow mischaracterization of a smart business move that makes sense for the possibility of getting a team back. Or are you too young to remember the Browns leaving Cleveland, but leaving the mascot and history with the city in the event they get an NFL team back? I don't think it's self-entitled to  have planned for the same. I think a lot of people would say that's following precedent.   But either way, I get your point that you don't think Seattle deserves pro sports and, for the record, I've been over the move since before they left since I knew Clay Bennett and David Stern would move the team no matter what.

I'm jaded towards mainstream sports. I don't enjoy the energy or atmosphere and adding more to a city (for no apparentl reason) to satisfy a minority.   Being a raging idealist but I just wish people were investing in people instead of more corporate building projects.    I've lived in Seattle my whole life. Love it here. But it's central identity never (to me at least) really included an NHL team.   It's nostalgia but I miss the Seattle I grew up in and not sports ball land. But  things obviously change.   It's not a rational opinion and I like sports but the machine of mainstreamm sports is just....not my thing.  I don't expect you or anyone to get it but I just don't vibe that way and I know I'm not alone in my opinion.   There are just so many things that I wish we spent millions on before sports. That's all. I don't wanna ruin anyone's good time.

The report says the city needs to do a better job of getting tow trucks to the scene faster and should be more flexible in calling tow companies other than the one it contracts with.   ""Lincoln Towing can't get a guy out here for another few hours!"" ""But we get a sweet discount with Lincoln Towing!""    Other recommendations include better coordination between police and SDOT, training for all responders, and instilling a greater sense of urgency in those who manage traffic incidents.   If only people could somehow be trained to care about other people.   Rather than a priority system of ""safety, property, traffic,"" the system will be ""safety, traffic, property"".    I find it hard to believe they will actually do this since damaging property potentially costs them money and holding up traffic doesn't, and probably even motivates greater funding of their department. But if they did take it seriously, it would be amusing to see what sort of property destruction they're willing to commit in order to allow cars to move by more quickly.

If our local school system is teaching solid CS basics (IDK as I don't have kids) we can eventually fill these jobs with locally raised human resources. Bottom line, any time a metro are experiences a grand economic shift prices will change, costs of living will change, and those not trained for the new economy will be priced out.

For example, the Pacific Place parking garage cost $61,000 per space to build (see page 12), and that was back in the 90s. How could any sane person think that was a good use of public funds? But the city did it anyway because Parking.  Granted Pacific Place was an outlier, but in Seattle it still costs around $20,000 per space for an above-grade garage and around twice that for below-grade, hence why garage parking is expensive.

I'd also love to see what percentage of bike commuters (as opposed to pleasure riders) are young, healthy, rich, white males. Assuming tech jobs qualify as rich that is. I suspect it's pretty high. I don't think supporting that demographic is the best use of this space. Or even near the top of the list really.  Edit: This really isn't complicated people. Land use is zero sum.

The purpose is to make sure that it's capable of supporting future increases.  Over 1000 people per day can easily turn into over 2000 people per day once Amazon, Expedia, Facebook, etc hire more people in the area. There isn't enough room for cars, so the better option is to make other commute options more atrractive."

There is also an answer as to how many people might use the bike lanes if yet even more lanes are added. To more fully connect the city. It's likely to be a larger number but by how much is far from certain.  There is another set of answers for how many people can be moved with other uses of that space. Such as dedicated bus lanes. Or street car. Or light rail. And even cars!   I'm relatively confident that dedicated bus/street car is a vastly superior choice than bike lanes. They have the added benefit of not only being faster and moving more people but being usable by children, elderly, disabled, injured, out of shape, and poor.   People like to think bikes are great for the poor. Who can't afford a bike? My anecdotal observation is that bike lanes are primarily used by rich people. You don't see a whole lot of bargain bin bikes for commuting. You do see a lot of $1000+ bikes though. I'd rather help the poor than help the rich. But maybe that's just me."
Seattle,3e0g4n,VietOne,3,Tue Jul 21 16:32:55 2015 UTC,"The increase in bicycle use is the concern and why they intend to increase the bicycle lanes. 54 per hour currently is only on 2nd ave. A single location. Which means multitudes more for all the current bicycle lanes and riders who are sharing the roads. More protected lanes, more usage all around. 177 per hour at a single location is SIGNIFICANT improvement from 54.  There is an answer to the use of a dedicated bus lane, the difference is negligible for the areas they want to use as a bicycle lane. 3rd ave already exists as the bus cooridoor and it's effective because it runs straight through downtown and cars are prohibited to be on 3rd during rush hour. Proposing turning the indicated lanes into a bus lane would result in a worse use of the space. Same as a street car lane.  For cars, the answer already exists. Neglibible. Adding an extra lane in those areas won't do much because there are already too many cars. It's like the Mercer street expansion. More cars can get onto mercer but the rest of the connecting infrastructure can't handle it making traffic improvements small. The same will happen here, unless you're prepared to upgrade all the roads in downtown Seattle, upgrading a small section of a few isn't going to provide the benefit to the drivers, you simply will have more lanes to wait in traffic."
Seattle,3e0g4n,LLJKCicero,3,Tue Jul 21 17:15:00 2015 UTC,"I'd even call it shameful given the demographics that receive the benefit.   Getting the affluent out of their cars: shameful.  Have you ever considered that maybe, just maybe, the reason why people who bike in America are largely young and fit is because our bike facilities are horrendously lacking? I just got back from a vacation in Denmark and Germany. There, you see all kinds of people biking. I would regularly see grandmas and grandpas shuttling their grandkids around on a bike. Easy to do when there are protected bike lanes all over the place and car traffic is slower."
Seattle,3e0g4n,forrestthewoods,0,Tue Jul 21 17:16:12 2015 UTC,Yes. I have considered that. I'm not stupid. I'm clearly thinking ahead multiple steps.  I'd love to see the numbers for Seattle if we were a biker's paradise like Amsterdam. I'd love to see the absolute best case. Protected bike lanes everywhere. Bike racks everywhere.  I don't think that universe is good enough. I think it's a local maxima. If such a study were to be done I think it might even be enough justification to remove what commuter bike lanes we have. If you want to bike then go do it on recreational trails. If you want to maximize economic opportunity across socio-economic stratification then ditch the bikes and replace them with dedicated public transportation.  I don't mind be wrong. Not in the slightest. I just want to see numbers. So far none of the numbers for bikes are impressive in the slightest.
Seattle,3e0g4n,LLJKCicero,3,Tue Jul 21 17:25:21 2015 UTC,"The numbers are plenty impressive when you look at how many people bike relative to the public investments there. Sure, many more people take rail or buses, but then again, we've spent and continue to spend far, far more money on those modes.   But treating them as either-or is ridiculous, anyway. The cities I visited (Copenhagen, Munich, Lubeck) managed to have both good public transportation and good biking facilities, and from what I saw, they had less land relative to their population compared to Seattle, not more. If other cities managed to do it, why not Seattle?"
Seattle,3e0g4n,forrestthewoods,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:43:58 2015 UTC,"Good bike and good public transportation is NOT either-or. But determining how to best use the space for a given location is. Broadway can have either a protected bike line or a dedicated street car lane. Either-or.  Well, the either-or options are a little bit more complex. Cars + protected bike OR cars + street car OR street car + bike. And even a few more if you consider elimination of street parking if there is any! I'd gladly trade street parking for other things along many of our streets."
Seattle,3e0g4n,theGalation,6,Tue Jul 21 18:36:37 2015 UTC,Public transportation and bikes are a better use of limited space.
Seattle,3e0g4n,forrestthewoods,-3,Tue Jul 21 14:59:14 2015 UTC,I agree on public transportation. I do not about bike lanes. I can say with high confidence that Broadway would have been better served with the protected bike lane instead being used as a dedicated bus/street car lane.
Seattle,3e0g4n,Bensch,3,Tue Jul 21 15:29:11 2015 UTC,"Bikes are way more space efficient than cars, so you'll move more people over time with them."

Seattle,3e0g4n,Polynya,5,Tue Jul 21 17:46:09 2015 UTC,"Well, a part of the problem is that many of the bike lanes in this city don't link up effectively with other bike lanes. It is possible to build a bike lane no one will use because the streets are too busy and dangerous before the start and after the finish. By planning and building a network of interconnected bike lanes, use of those lanes should jump considerably."

I don't see how bike lanes are any different. Like sidewalks, they need to connect in order to truly work which is not the case at all downtown.

Even other staunch supporters I've talked to rationalize their continued support with the thought that she probably won't be able to convince Olympia.

Everyone is pretty categorically against the New York-style rent control (zero increases ever), but controls against predatory landlords are more mixed.  Limiting rent increases to a specific percentage (10%, say) are usually considered very fair, and stop situations where landlords lure people with low initial rents, and then jack the rent up.

Seattle,3dywbw,OrangeCurtain,-1,Mon Jul 20 21:30:09 2015 UTC,"Agreed.  Unfortunately dogmatic opposition to the extremes of New York have lead to a reactionary backlash against anything resembling rent regulation.  The fact is, the California style caps on increases do not have the same negative impacts as strict rent control.  Developers are not scared away from producing new apartments, since they have the ability to move rent upwards to respond to increasing prices, while tenants have the safety of knowing that their rent can be a realistic budget item from year-to-year without worrying about the stress and expense of moving.  It just stops most of the really nasty games that are played.  And it gives people peace of mind, which is really important."

I realize that reports like the one I posted are 40 page PDFs filled with citations and lack the sort of ""clear soundbites"" that make for pithy reddit comments.  The true picture is that some rent control measures are bad, some are not.  Some decent measures can be implemented poorly.  A lack of regulation is also bad, but only in certain ways, and not always.  The fact is the truth is more complex than any clear message that I could put on a billboard.

My main issue with most of the reports, polls and studies is that they almost universally and exclusively use NYC or CA as examples for anti-rent control.

Or are we talking reasonable caps on increases (like ""no more than 7-10% per year"") that have allowances for major renovations to the property?    A one question unscientific poll which only accepts one-word answers on an agree-disagree spectrum can never capture a full and robust picture of rent and its effects.  But more to the point, if you disbelieve the report I pointed you towards, perhaps you can show evidence that second generation rent stabilization measures still cause these undesirable effects you mention?  Certainly if this is so clear and obvious, you can easily show it."
Seattle,3dywbw,TheComputerLovesYou,0,Mon Jul 20 22:56:55 2015 UTC,"The question posed:   Local ordinances that limit rent increases for some rental housing units, such as in New York and San Francisco, have had a positive impact over the past three decades on the amount and quality of broadly affordable rental housing in cities that have used them.   Are you aware of how sample size works? Even if an opinion poll was a good way to gauge expert consensus (it's not) 2 cities is a not a sufficient sample size to judge the complex variety of rent regulations used in hundreds if not thousands of cities."
Seattle,3dywbw,animalchin99,0,Tue Jul 21 15:28:56 2015 UTC,"If a question is asked, and examples mentioned, I don't see how it's then limited to only those examples. Try to pick it apart as much as you want. But broadly speaking in macroeconomics, any price limits of any kind limit supply and creates scarcity/dead weight loss over time."

Seattle,3dywbw,F_WRLCK,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:04:19 2015 UTC,"That's why setting the increase cap is so important.  Obviously if you never allow increases, that's terrible.  If you set the cap to 500% it's irrelevant because it will never come into effect.    Somewhere between there is a cap where landlords can adjust for inflation and not be behind, but where tenants can have peace of mind for the future."
Seattle,3dywbw,TheComputerLovesYou,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:08:22 2015 UTC,"Agreed. Unfortunately dogmatic opposition to the extremes of New York have lead to a reactionary backlash against anything resembling rent regulation.   I think this is for very good reason.  Economists in general view price as a very useful signal for allocating scarce goods.  When you start putting controls and limits on the price, it has all sorts of distortionary effects on the supply and demand side.    You want developers to see a high rent price to incentivize more supply.  And you want renters to see a high price and consider roommates or other substitutes as a way of conserving what little housing there is.    Price is the signal that makes all this work.  If you distort the price signal, you take away a lot of the balancing economic forces.  Economists are also in general against price gouging laws for the same damn reason.  Prices == signals.   In general, economists are much bigger fans of simply giving people $$ and raising their incomes & letting them decide if they want to spend more of it on rent, or on transportation, or whatever.    Honestly, the best way to finance something like this is a Land Value Tax:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land_value_tax  Which has vastly better economic properties than something like rent control.   God knows we'll never see good economic policy actually debated in this state though."
Seattle,3dywbw,puto_guapo,3,Tue Jul 21 05:33:47 2015 UTC,"While Econ 101 provides a basic understanding of the matter, the fact is that things are a tad more complicated.    First, the housing market is not very reactive.  ""Housing"" and ""smartphones"" are fundamentally different.  Between acquiring land, passing permitting, and finishing construction, new apartments can take years to construct.  Even if developers ran out the door tomorrow, there would be a very long lag time to new housing being available.  Second, an apartment represents significant sunk cost for a person.  Moving in, furnishing, and settling into a location is a time-consuming and expensive process.  When a landlord jacks the price up 30-50% the occupant is faced with two unpleasant choices.  Both represent a very high cost to them, and a very low cost to the landlord (who can find new tenants/victims easily in this housing market) who often gets the new price they are demanding.    Finally, capping price increases gives tenants confidence to move.  When you go from a $1500 a month apartment to a $1300 a month apartment, there's no guarantee that the price won't just shoot up when your lease expires.  That tends to lock tenants in place.    Tenant rights are important.  A home is not a luxury good (see: food, water, shelter).  That gives landlords a significant power imbalance, because it is not possible to simply abstain from buying shelter the way one might abstain from buying magazines or a new television.    A dogmatic ""never regulate the free market"" approach is no more sensible than a communist saying ""the market cannot be allowed any freedoms""."
Seattle,3dywbw,TheComputerLovesYou,-1,Tue Jul 21 06:11:42 2015 UTC,"Between acquiring land, passing permitting, and finishing construction, new apartments can take years to construct.   Right.  But rent control has been in place for almost 50 years in places like SF, and even their version allows for smallish rent increases each year.  It's still distorted incentives considerably there.     Second, an apartment represents significant sunk cost for a person.    Not for those that pack light.  Believe me, I grew up poor as shit in Seattle.  I was always ready to move at the drop of a hat, and could fit all my earthly belongs in the back of my truck.     A home is not a luxury good   So?  All evidence points to people responding to prices even in areas like housing.     because it is not possible to simply abstain from buying shelter the way one might abstain from buying magazines or a new television.   But it is totally possible to economize on shelter, by shacking with roommates, etc.  The whole point is you want prices to reflect scarcity.  Because then market forces work in your favor and not against it.    Regulating prices to be artificially low does nothing to help out in the long run.     A dogmatic ""never regulate the free market"" approach is no more sensible than a communist saying ""the market cannot be allowed any freedoms"".   I'm not dogmatic here, I'm saying if you just tax land at a reasonable level and give the proceeds to citizens this does a lot of things for you:   Incentives development.  Yes, the land value tax actually encourages development!  It's a tax on land, not buildings! Keeping rental prices flexible, means they send the proper signal to those building houses, and those living in them. Taking the land value tax proceeds and putting it into people's pockets makes high rents more affordable.    This is strictly better than any proposal that involves price controls on rents."

And these crews weren't really breaking a sweat, which is a real trick in the heat down here.  So it seems to me that it shouldn't be hard for a city to pack on a thousand households a month by simply offering decent/subsidized construction financing.  Which might do a lot more for the price of rent than the 220 houses per month that Seattle has been building for the past 11 years.  Maybe it's just me, but why try to control a price that's going to cause massive market distortions, when it would probably be better for everyone to simple increase supply."

When only considering today's institutional investors, you're right, but they aren't the only ones who would be able to operate in the market if you got rid of, say, single family zones. Any level of imperfect information in the market - and markets get less perfect the more actors you allow in - represents an opportunity for lower rents.  There's another factor as well. If you allow more growth, you get more people and jobs - so you're also going to cause median income to increase. The proportion of income that goes to rent will likely drop even if rents do not in absolute terms."

This is really another aspect of city planning that Seattle skipped until it was 10 years past due. Workers who rent in the city are likely working in the city. They likely work in places that serve the higher paid workers and tenants. If we start to push those people out of the city by raising rents, people in the city will either have to pay more for services so that those same people can afford to continue to live in the city or risk that those workers will simply move away and work in the suburbs instead. If we push that work out of the city then we risk having the higher paid workers also move out of the city center to follow the service they no longer have access to.   It's nebulous for sure but we see examples of hollow city centers with no sense of culture around the US. Seattle has time to fix this if they are careful about it. In the mean time, fixing light rail so that the east side and outer suburbs are more connected will help all levels of worker to continue to work in Seattle."

Cities and states rarely want to risk building more than they absolutely have to.  Just look at the press about the tunnel project.

Selective wage and price control chooses winners and losers.  Total wage and price control in command economies are largely viewed as not sustainable.  The Soviets got 70+ years before they collapsed.

Name one other item that can eat up 40-60% of your income (depending on where you live and your job). The only other thing I can think of is a mortgage.  Think of how much other businesses would benefit from lower rents. People would be able to afford things they previously couldn't like a new car, TV, computer. Maybe even go to college without having to take out loans."

Unfortunately, the real problem for the city is not that you can't find a place to live in the city, but that lots and lots of people can't.  The problem is that there is much more demand for certain neighborhoods than there is supply.  Artificially keeping your rent low doesn't fix that problem. It doesn't even try to and it makes it worse as it reduces the incentive to build.  The other people who are not you also want to live in the city.  What about them?    I'm sorry your rent is too high, but I want the city to be affordable and accessible for my kids when they grow up as well, and rent control is not going to help with that.  It's just going to make things worse."

Seattle,3dywbw,blushingapple,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:56:00 2015 UTC,"So sick of this as a comeback.  Moving is expensive.  Our economy has made it to where a lot of people are just one paycheck away from homelessness.  Moving when you have a life like this in Seattle means downgrading to having multiple roommates (what if you have a family?  Not likely you are gonna find people to take you in) or going into transitional housing still with roommates, except now they have mental illness and drug problems, and 1/4 of your earnings to cover rent which may not even be a more affordable solution in a city like this.  If you are a barista or grocery bagger making $1500/mo, after you add in transit costs and food and other life expenses, how are you supposed to save money or go to school on a low income to better yourself?  At that point you are probably battling depression on top of all your other issues which makes getting ahead even more difficult, because now you make too much money for Medicaid but have to come up with money for a private insurance plan.    A lot of people are imprisoned in their situations in Seattle now, due to how rapidly rents and other things have risen around here in the last ten years, while most people's wages never went up.  I doubt anything I write is going to change a mind set in your type of thinking though, so fuck it, why am I even wasting my time.  I guess I should just grab my last $60 and take a Greyhound to Wenatchee and squat on land out there till I die of starvation for being a low income piece of shit who couldn't recover from the economy collapsing while record levels of gentrification were happening in Seattle at the same time, according to your logic.    Guess I sure was stupid to try to use my rollover IRA from the white collar job I was laid off at to move somewhere cheaper like you suggested.  It just ended up having price increases too.  I am living out of a van next month after getting another price increase today which I can't cover this time.   No money left to move, barely enough to buy the van.

Seattle,3dwt88,CorvusCaurinus,2,Mon Jul 20 17:52:24 2015 UTC,"BPA also produces a lot of their electricity from hydropower. Read a little farther down. Less than 3% of our electricity comes from a source that contributes carbon to the atmosphere. Landfill gas is essentially carbon-neutral. If it wasn't captured and burned, releasing CO2 exhaust, it would escape into the atmosphere as methane anyway, which is a worse greenhouse gas than CO2."
Seattle,3dwt88,Schadenfreuder,5,Mon Jul 20 19:27:26 2015 UTC,"Where I live, Puget Sound Energy provides power and they get 49% of their energy from coal and oil resources, which our over-reliance on is the primary reason for climate change happening. You, me and everyone else around here are relieving ourselves from the effects of climate change by using a device that makes climate change worse (unless you're powering from a renewable resource, like solar).  In Dubai, a country whose immense wealth comes from the oil that we're using to heat up the earth, hosts a beach-side hotel with sand so hot, they built pipes underneath it to keep the sand refrigerated for its guests."
Seattle,3dwt88,spencer32320,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:35:02 2015 UTC,I thought Seattle gets something like 95% of our power from hydro electric? So its not as bad for seattlites to use more power compared to other places.

Seattle,3dwt88,aliensvsdinosaurs,4,Mon Jul 20 15:27:23 2015 UTC,"You can't use that reason to justify using more electricity though.  There is only so much hydro power available in the US, and the more we use, the less places like California will have available, which means more coal and gas.  Also note that the 95% number is based on paper only; physically your source of electricity is much more complicated and is likely well under 95% hydro.  Not that I'm judging you for wanting to use more electricity, just don't hide behind cheap hydro power as an excuse."

However, reducing our energy consumption here allows that energy to be sent to other states/ other areas of Washington, or support this state's growing population, so reducing your electricity consumption is still helping prevent climate change."
Seattle,3dwt88,mdwyer,2,Mon Jul 20 14:56:40 2015 UTC,"You're both right. PSE gets 49% of its energy from coal and gas, and that is a much better proportion than is used in a lot of other places, like the more than two thirds at PSCO."

Seattle,3dwt88,Emberwake,1 point,Mon Jul 20 06:55:41 2015 UTC,"If your freezer is in your home, this is actually a net gain in heat. Your freezer doesn't simply remove heat from things you put into it, it transfers it into the air via the coils in back. But it is not 100% efficient, meaning using the freezer to chill water into ice and then using that ice to cool your home will always be worse than simply not freezing the water in the first place.  Now, if you buy a bag of ice frozen elsewhere and bring that home, you might be looking at a minor reduction in heat."
Seattle,3dwt88,omgbewbs,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:28:38 2015 UTC,"While yes, it will produce a miniscule net gain overall, the localized cool air is worth it for me. If I were to freeze a bunch of ice and dump it on myself, my home might be slightly warmer,  but I'm still going to be cold."

I let it cool the room down to 60 degrees, and then turned it off. Super easy to install too.  One of the problems for a lot of townhouse, and apartment renters out there is that there's a heavy use of casement windows. Very few sliding glass windows that go vertically here in Seattle.

Seattle,3dz2r4,Evilrazzberi09,16,Mon Jul 20 23:26:34 2015 UTC,"Lived in Castle Rock from 1975-1999.  Most of the town was flooded as the river overfilled with silt.  Anyone who was in town moved their belongs and themselves to higher ground and lots of people had friends and family live with them for extended periods of time.  Movement around/in/out of town was nearly impossible as roads were washed away and/or buried under water and silt.  For months people walked around town with medical-style face masks to protect their lungs from the ash which would be stirred up from the ground.  Even now, you can still drive on I-5 and see the remnants of the dredging that took place as 40-50 foot tall piles of sand pulled from the Cowlitz river still sit beside the freeway (now blocked mostly by alder trees).  It does make for some fun ATV activities though.  All around Castle Rock, all the playfields are all made of this sand with a layer of dirt on top.  If you walk up and down the Cowlitz River in town, there is a 20-30 foot dike between the river and the town to prevent the river from spilling into the town... in fact for 10 years or so after the eruption, areas in and around town would be continually flooded with only marginally more than normal rainfall.  The town and surrounding areas lost about 10% - 20% of its population.  The school district went from about 1,500 students to about 1,000 (Source:  parents taught in the school district).  This was great for class sizes but bad for funding as the per capita allotment didn't meet the requirements for the district.  As such, special levies were required to make up the difference.  This directly impacted future levies for other things that were needed by the district not related to the eruption because people were ""taxed enough already"".  You would often see the high school sports teams having to do fund raisers to pay for basic items like uniforms and equipment and busdriver pay.  It did bring in a ton of tourism to town though.  There are three visitors centers in the area and there were really interesting tours you could take of the effects of the pyroclastic floe.  Castle Rock is now known as the ""Gateway to Mt. St. Helens"", so there's that."

Seattle,3dz2r4,The_funny_guy,11,Tue Jul 21 10:15:03 2015 UTC,"Air travel was disrupted for weeks before the big eruption, as the mountain periodically belched smoke and ash.  Jets apparently don't fly so well when that stuff is clogging their engines, so when there was much of it up there, the airlines didn't fly in that direction.  I had a friend who was working in customer service then for the now-defunct Western Airlines.  He said he had a lot of people calling up, outraged that their flight was delayed or cancelled, demanding to know why the airline wasn't doing something about this, and when it was going to be over.  He never was able to get the idea across to them that volcanoes are just going to do what volcanoes do, and we were just along for the ride."
Seattle,3dz2r4,casagordita,7,Mon Jul 20 20:56:16 2015 UTC,"There was a very light dusting of ash (it was hard to notice), some really weird clouds that turned out not to be clouds and some spectacular sunsets."

Seattle,3dz2r4,MegaRAID01,6,Mon Jul 20 20:15:44 2015 UTC,In Seattle?  Nothing.  But traveling through the areas that did get ash was difficult for a while because there wasn't enough equipment to clean it up - sort of like a snow storm that never melts.    The ash was fun to play with.  It had a slimy clay like consistency when wet.  Not good for driving on though.
Seattle,3dz2r4,leftcoastmoderate,5,Mon Jul 20 21:44:27 2015 UTC,I lived in Lake Stevens at the time.   The sound of the initial blast woke me up.

A few weeks later we had a camping trip scheduled for the Naches area (West of Yakima) and ended up camping in 6-8 inches of ash.   It was NOT good for cars or people.

I've jumped at all the local dropzones, you have 4 to choose from.  skydive snohomish you've heard about.  skydivers dont like the place but if you want a decent view and just to go on a ride its safe and the instructors are experienced.    I normally jump at Skydive Kapowsin down in Shelton.  More people, more experience, and an incredible view of Mt. Rainier.  the instructors have a lot of experience backing them and the DZ is run very well.  you will jump from a caravan or a twin otter depending on the day.    you then have whidby island.  that has an amazing view of the island and that area with a small cessna running.  its a smaller dz with a huge heart and the people there really enjoy skydiving.  still a lot of experience with the instructors.  the final option is Skydive Toledo.  its a smaller DZ with some very old school skydivers with crazy experience but you would never know it.  its ""rogue"" in the words of skydivers but has a lot of character.  I would recommend this place over Snohomish.    An honorable mention is in Chelan, wa which has some awesome people and its right next to the lake, it will be very hot here and they do jumps into a winery on certain days.  I dont know all the info on that though.  run but really cool people with lots of experience."

Drivers approaching the tunnel from either direction will face a choice depending on their destination: use the tunnel to bypass downtown or exit to city streets and head into downtown. From the south, on- and off-ramps near the stadiums will connect SR 99 to a new waterfront surface street that will be built in the footprint of the viaduct. This connection and new east-west connections between the new waterfront street and downtown will replace the function of today’s midtown viaduct ramps and also provide improved access to the waterfront.  This rendering (https://www.flickr.com/photos/wsdot/15415702577/in/album-72157631528692308/)  illustrates what the tunnel’s south portal will look like.

Hearing more about the troubles, though, I really resent how much they have fought the state about the pipe if that has turned out to be inconsequential. So the contractor made the choice on the tool... are they (mostly) to blame?

Seattle,3dyxci,mister_bulldog,3,Mon Jul 20 17:42:42 2015 UTC,"Interesting, although I think including total population density and not just percent change would be informative."
Seattle,3dyxci,Zonoc,2,Mon Jul 20 19:41:22 2015 UTC,"So much of the population boom has occurred in the last five years, it's too bad the article only examines 2000-2010."
Seattle,3dysnv,mrye06,10,Mon Jul 20 17:10:14 2015 UTC,To the north: Deception Pass and Larabee. Chuckanut Drive is gorgeous.
Seattle,3dysnv,soundslikepuget,8,Mon Jul 20 17:11:34 2015 UTC,Fort Flagler and Fort Casey are nice if you like old things.
Seattle,3dysnv,taxtaxi,7,Mon Jul 20 17:20:23 2015 UTC,"There are very few duds in the State Park system.   Start out exploring the parks in King County  Salwater and Dash Point sport lovely waterfront access and nice woods.  Kanaskat Palmer, Nolte and Flaming Geyser explore the Green River.  Ollalie has the classic Twin Falls hike plus access to the Snoqualmie River and the Iron Horse Trail  Lake Sammamish is great for picnics, swimming, and features hundreds of acres of ""wild areas"" back from the lake that are worth exploring. Lots of interesting animals and some remnants of homesteads (an orchard!) back in there.   Saint Edward must be seen. An old catholic seminary school still stands, though it is falling into disrepair it is still an awsome sight. Great trails down to the shores of Lake Washington as well.  Squak Mountain is excellent for hiking especially when Cougar and Tiger are overrun. The Bullit Fireplace is a fun and interesting destination. There is a ""secret view"" on the south slopes of the mountain that is worth a trip. A view all the way to Mt Rainier.    Avoid Bridle Trails unless you are a horse person.   Just those nearby parks will keep you busy for a while."
Seattle,3dysnv,jnorm00,2,Mon Jul 20 21:08:49 2015 UTC,"I don't know much about parks to just go hang out, but for hiking you should check out Wallace Falls and Ollalie state parks. In the latter, the lower Twin Falls trailhead is still washed out as far as I know, but you can get in from the top. If you like to bike on trails, you should check out Iron Horse State Park, which has a separate parking lot at Rattlesnake Lake. It's a reclaimed railway line that is open to hiking, biking, and horseback riding, and maybe snowmobiling in the winter (although you need a separate pass for that). I've only ridden the ~20 miles from there to the tunnel at Snoqualmie Pass, but the trail continues most of the way (or maybe all the way) to the Idaho border."
Seattle,3dysnv,draqza,3,Mon Jul 20 19:02:50 2015 UTC,"Deception Pass SP up on Whidbey Island is a must in the summertime- be sure to stick around at the north beach when the tides change, the rapids that flow through the pass are pretty crazy (even better if you get to watch an underpowered boat have to bail out and turn around while attempting them)."
Seattle,3dysnv,aimless_ly,2,Mon Jul 20 20:03:46 2015 UTC,"The Little Si trail in the North Bend area is pretty awesome. It's an easy trail for beginners, family friendly, and dog friendly.

The state's got a lot to offer - I recommend a road trip to eastern Washington after the heat dies down a bit.  Hit it at harvest time and live off of the fresh fruit stands.  P.S. posting in r/washington will probably get you a wealth of local knowledge about these and other areas (i.e. not just state parks, but county or state DFW)."

So far that's been the best hike I've done, with spectacular views all along, and a 9 mile roundtrip thats a bit challenging. Highly recommend if anyone is looking for a new hike spot. Its got a bit of everything, constant upwards climb, scrambling up Vesper Peak itself, even Vesper Lake to dip in and swim in."

If you don't like people or going out much, you can live in North Bend as well."
Seattle,3dzneq,leftcoastmoderate,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:48:14 2015 UTC,"I do enjoy going out for drinks, hiking, yoga and such.. all those listed above would be good options? There were a few decent priced placed for Issaquah on Airbnb."
Seattle,3dzneq,retreadz,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:14:22 2015 UTC,"Sorry, I just saw this. I'll go through each.    Drinks Issaquah and North Bend were formed as frontier towns back in the day for mining and logging and such. There is still a lot of shipping and trucking there. Therefore, you will have your fill of salty dive bars filled with truckers. It's awesome to grab a cheap boilermaker after work with a game on or a game of pool. However, there are a lot of nice places as well. Issaquah has a brewpub owned by Rogue. Across the street is a place called Sunset Alehouse which has great pub food and quality beer. If you like swanky, there are lots of wine bars in Issaquah, the Issaquah Plateau, and Sammamish. Bellevue itself has the snootiest places (not necessarily a complaint) and even has a few night clubs. Redmond is a hub of small local breweries like Black Raven, Hi-Fi, Postdoc, and a larger one called Mac & Jacks.     Newcastle, Eastgate, Factoria, Lakemont, and Newport Hills all have not much going on in that department other than your local Mexican restaurants with margs, Applebee's, etc.     Hiking Oh yes, we have hiking. If you look at a map and check out the cities and neighborhoods I'm recommending, you'll see they are along I-90. There are countless hikes with trailheads just off 90. Denny Creek, Mount Si, Rattlesnake Ledge... Go to wta.org and browse to your heart's content. We have some seriously good trails here.    Yoga The PNW is a hub of ""natural wellness"", and because of that, we have a lot of yoga studios. Because I don't do yoga, I do not know if they are good, average, or exceptional, but Issaquah and other areas around the Eastside do have yoga studios.    Overall, stay on the Eastside and you'll do fine for traffic and the above. It has a reputation of being a bit snootier than Seattle-proper, but that's not always true, I think people come in with closed minds because they know the stereotypes and create a self-fulfilling prophecy. The only negatives I've found: there aren't as many fascinating food places on the Eastside. We have excellent restaurants, just not as dense as Seattle's. Also, because I lived in Seattle for so many years, I have a lot of friends out there and they seem to think it's super far to come visit, so they rarely do."

Seattle,3dzneq,rossa8,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:36:10 2015 UTC,"Nice idea, but a LOT of the cabins that are available typically see year-round use and often don't even depend on the ski season compared to other similar locations in WA or other states."
Seattle,3dzneq,surflessinseattle,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:21:27 2015 UTC,"Most people are trying to get from Issaquah to Seattle for work so if you cannot find something in Issaquah, head west for housing. You'll be going the opposite direction of traffic during commute times. Bellevue/Eastgate, Mercer Island, Factoria, Renton areas would be your second best bet."

When it became clear the voters were growing tired of funding the profits of the owners ( of three stadiums ), the team was sold to an individual who always intended to move the team to another city (his own.)  The new owner used his home city as leverage, and got them to build a new arena with all the luxury boxes and VIP areas they could afford, so he asked the NBA to move the team because Seattle was full of jerks who wouldn't give him a blank check.  Seattle then passed a law prohibiting blank checks for stadiums, which prompted the glorious leader of the NBA to declare Seattle would never have a NBA team "" as long as he was alive"""

I figured this was as good a time as any to come out of lurker mode and actually post something (let's see if I learned something from all the lurking).  First- Proof!  Second - It was absolutely my pleasure to assist Saturday! Backstory:  I was in the area dropping off a friend after we played 2 games in the brutal heat for a corporate charity soccer tournament; Apologies for the mess in my car. We saw you as I turned onto her street and I chuckled (one look at the bus and you'd laugh too).  I dropped my friend off and as it happened, I needed to come back the way I came and as I approached the bus again, I came to the conclusion that this was not something any couple should couple should have to endure. The rest is just an awesome wedding story you can tell your friends and family about later!  I did this not for recognition, but because people needed help on a very special day that shouldn't be marred by bad luck (and newbie bus drivers who should know better than to take anything other than QA Ave up the hill). Plus, sometimes, something compels you to do something great for a complete stranger.  When you get back from your honeymoon message me!  I'd be more than happy to meet up with you at a local bar and share a beer with you!  /u/poppycorn, I was about to tell you that we're not on The Knot, but turns out my fiance first registered there before forgetting and creating a website somewhere else! The Knot requires you to input at least two characters for the last name, so I was about to get really creeped out as to how you could have possibly found our registry. Took me a second to realize you can get by the two character last name requirements on The Knot by typing **. I applaud your sleuthing skills!  EDIT: Originally chose the name I_Jumpoutofairplanes, but changed it to EOD_Skydiver, hence why the photo doesn't match the username.  Apologies."

Edit: I made that pic quickly in paint last night for the discussion.  But, since apparently everyone expects me to be a professional cartographer, I made a second one to clarify even further.  The white circle in my first map goes further north than the actual picture.  Again, it was something I drew freehand at 1am.  Please observe here, however:  http://i.imgur.com/6Xvm4lt.png  The photo is clearly not straight east towards the Microsoft campus (marked with a red star), but is at a steep southwest angle (black line, approximately).  The photo mostly hits Lake Sammamish at its wide western crest (marked in yellow).  We just barely see a tiny part of the lake as it begins curving to the east (marked in green).  So, because of the steep angle, we CLEARLY do not see straight east of Hunts Point, which is where the Microsoft campus is.  Hopefully that clears is up for everyone who couldn't figure out angles on their own."

The ""spite house"" concept sounds absurd to me, which is not to say it isn't true.  Our neighborhood conversation sparked by this shooting is full of concern, but it's fragmented. It's fragmented across different communication channels. Just today, we've talked to neighbors on Reddit, Nextdoor, Facebook, and on the street. It's fragmented in terms of actions. Different neighbors have vastly different attitudes about what to do about the drug, violence, prostitution and mental health issues nearby.    If a self-interested developer is endangering our neighborhood to spite the city, that is a target that can galvanize all of us."

At least in my townhouse setup, there is no community zone, every owner has their plot and there is a set of easements given to various other owners."
Seattle,3dvp77,DoctorZook,1 point,Mon Jul 20 07:00:42 2015 UTC,"IANAL, but absent a contract to the contrary, I think this is correct.  I lived in a townhouse that sounds rather like this, and the land was legally divided, with each townhouse on a separate plot. The SMC seems to indicate that whoever owns the land that abuts the planting strip is responsible. E.g.,   SMC 10.52.030 In addition to duties the owner or occupant may have to abate nuisances, the owner or occupant of property shall:   Remove vegetation in or on an abutting sidewalk; Destroy, remove or trim vegetation or parts thereof on the property, and which are also overhanging any sidewalk within eight (8) feet measured vertically from any point on the sidewalk; Destroy, remove or trim vegetation or any parts thereof on the property or on adjacent planting strips, which encroaches on or overhangs the travelled portion of the street or alley within fourteen (14) feet measured vertically from any point on the street or alley; Remove vegetation constituting a safety hazard found on adjacent planting strips or alleys; Remove vegetation constituting a fire hazard found on adjacent planting strips or alleys; Remove vegetation constituting a health hazard found on adjacent planting strips or alleys.    (Emphasis mine.)  Of course, the SMC doesn't say anything about what constitutes neighborly behavior. If you think the renovation will improve your property value, or improve your enjoyment of the property, you might want to kick in.  (One thing is for sure: whatever some people in this thread may wish to believe, the homeowner, not the city, is responsible for maintaining this space.)"
Seattle,3dvp77,CokeRobot,2,Mon Jul 20 15:38:09 2015 UTC,"I personally would at least maintain it. I see a lot of planter strips in front of houses around the city that are just dead and look dreadful compared to the rest of the neighborhood. You don't have to, but it's nice.   On a related note, around the Seattle Center, there's small planter sections that are also completely dead. Doesn't the city maintain that at all?"
Seattle,3dvp77,fizzlebottom,2,Mon Jul 20 03:40:36 2015 UTC,"/u/tallyrue already mentioned it, but I'm putting this in its own comment:  Go to the King County Parcel Viewer and search for your street address. It will show you a representation of your property line. That is what you're legally responsible for according to the county. If you want to chip in, nothing is stopping you. But this map and your deed will stop your neighbor from demanding anything from you."
Seattle,3dvp77,Junkpuncherz101,3,Mon Jul 20 16:09:24 2015 UTC,"If you benefit financially from the upkeep when you go to sell, why not chip in?"
Seattle,3dvp77,leftcoastmoderate,-1,Mon Jul 20 01:11:40 2015 UTC,"The planting strip is usually city property, so nobody is responsible for maintaining it.  People usually landscape the strip in front of their homes although they're under no obligation to do more than keep their own bushes trimmed back from the sidewalk.    Look at the king county parcel viewer and you may be able to determine whether the planting strip is in fact within lot boundaries.  Most of the time it is not."
Seattle,3dvp77,tallyrue,6,Sun Jul 19 23:04:05 2015 UTC,"Thanks. From this website, however, it seems like only the properties abutting the planting strip are responsible: http://www.seattle.gov/transportation/stuse_faq.htm#tree1"

Seattle,3dvp77,Electricoutlet,-6,Sun Jul 19 23:12:39 2015 UTC,"City maintained... That's why you see the signs on these strips occasionally that say ""Owner will maintain"". The city is responsible for their upkeep but some times nearby homeowner/renters/leasers will prefer to utilize them as their own personal gardens, posting these signs asking the city to not disturb the work being done."
Seattle,3e0twh,bexyboozy,17,Tue Jul 21 02:15:51 2015 UTC,"Do us one favor: Do not go to a gay bar unless you are celebrating a bachelorette who is an actual lesbian.  While gay marriage is now legal (hallelujah!) it is still bad manners to take over a corner of a gay bar to look at hot guys and not be bothered by straight men.  Gay clubs are not theme parks for straight women.  Individually, all of you are welcome at any other time to throw back a shot and enjoy the party.  No one is saying that gay bars cannot be a good place for any gender or sexual orientation to drink and have a (respectful) good time.  Being a part of a pack of women who are decked out with pink feather boas, glittery crowns, and penis-shaped accessories may feel like being in a gay pride parade to the participants, but to outside observers it's about as fun as being an animal on display at the zoo on school field trip day."

The more activity-focused might like some slightly odd physical activity like Indoor Skydiving (See iFly). We also have a place that does Trapeze lessons.  The most ""let's see some dude flesh"" ladies might prefer Seattle's substantial burlesque scene (maybe the Can Can in the market, although stuff is frequently going on all over), or if you want straight up male stripping, we have a few of those clubs as well.  There're also some ghost tours and the like for the type of person that likes ghost tours.  We've got all sorts of clubs and bars across the various neighborhoods, for the clubbing and drinking set. Belltown's bars and clubs are the closest to ""generic bar"" like other cities, I think, followed by Capitol Hill. Pioneer Square is also a place. Seattle has some amazing bartenders who make some amazing cocktails, if your goal is booze."

Seattle,3dsb4s,MrJadaml,2,Sun Jul 19 03:31:32 2015 UTC,Those streets look wide.  Are they wider than Seattle?  Traffic is already bad and didn't data say that Seattle drivers prefer driving alone?  I work construction and bounce from Job to Job throughout the day and traffic everywhere is bad....and not getting any better.  Do we accommodate a small segment of population with 30% of the street or should we do something different with that money?  edit: not directed at anybody in particular just wanted continuity on the posts to this idea.
Seattle,3dsb4s,1337Rooster,2,Sun Jul 19 13:27:05 2015 UTC,"I think we accommodate all forms of transit. No one form should be raised above any other. Certainly not the most expensive form of transportation (personal car ownership). I would love to see biking get that ""30%"" of the budget (or whatever the exact percentage is) that its segment takes up."
Seattle,3dsb4s,mesatchie,4,Mon Jul 20 23:35:24 2015 UTC,"Biking helps poor people. Its the cheapest mode of transportation. Plus we should incentivize biking it, make it a good mode of transportation worth using. Cars on the road impact the environment significantly, which creates a public expense which affects everyone. We need less people driving. Make not driving a good experience.  I agree that downtown and surrounding is pretty bad. I think we could build bike lanes by converting the city's lawn properties into bike lanes. This doesn't reduce traffic lanes, but may require loss of lawn (which is city property) and trees. Of course homeowners don't really like it. Japan has really big sidewalks in their cities, part of their sidewalks are bike lanes. Its like road, barrier,sidewalk,bikelanes. So its a safe separation from traffic. This is an approach I'd like to see. Of course it wouldn't work downtown.  But I mean, can't make everyone happy."
Seattle,3dsb4s,alexfrancisburchard,5,Sun Jul 19 23:08:13 2015 UTC,"More cyclists will reduce traffic congestion. Two bike lanes can be fit into one car lane with room to spare. As well, these bike lanes are just built in former on-street parking. These changes will reduce on-street parking in Seattle by only 1-2%, but take quite a few cars off the road. On-street parking is a massive hidden subsidy in the first place. It is using public property on some of the most expensive real estate in the state for free, or much less than market parking costs. This is economically irrational, and results in a parking shortage, and traffic congestion. This is why it's estimated that 30-40% of cars you see driving in central Seattle are circling for parking."
Seattle,3dsb4s,MrJadaml,2,Sun Jul 19 16:34:11 2015 UTC,"SOV commuting to downtown Seattle is like 35% or something, transit is in the 40's cycling is like 5% walking is like 10% ish."

Seattle,3dsb4s,kusuriya,1 point,Mon Jul 20 07:17:17 2015 UTC,what? ST starts running at like 6 AM... the sounder starts even earlier IIRC. (First arrival in Seattle is 5:54 AM)
Seattle,3dsb4s,alexfrancisburchard,4,Sun Jul 19 14:40:28 2015 UTC,"I worked in SLU for years on a schedule of 8 - 5 M - F, I tried transit for about a solid month with a bike and was late just about every single day. With how shitty the buses run and how quickly the bike racks filled on the sounder and light rail It was near impossible to make it into work before 9, 8:30 would have been pushing it.   Leaving from kent as an example the first ST bus is around 6, takes 2 hours to get downtown on it, that puts you at Westlake center about 8, already late for your 8 AM office start. The sounder if you get on it first run is at 6, but youll have to account for some extra time at that point on the sounder because the bike racks probably filled up in Tacoma so you wont be able to board with your bike. The light rail, if you get on over there you have a fighting chance to get into Seattle around 6:45 - 7 but you have to be aggro enough to push through so you can get a space on the bike rack otherwise you get to wait.  But after about 6 months of trying various combos to not drive since changing my work schedule was not possible the viable choices to get to work on time were, Wake up ass-crack-o-clock early and just ride the damn bike all the way in. Forsake the bike and walk/bus/train (I ended up doing this), Or just drive.  Lets not even go into what you have to do if you want to bike later on in the day because traffic always sucks, but you have to be in Seattle during the hours of 3 AM - 6AM (after the last bus out of dodge till the first bus back). Working overnights suuuuucked.  Seattle has a shitty transit system and it honestly is an embarrassment for a city of its size. If they honestly want to try and consider bikes as a viable way of cutting down car traffic in the city they need to have what every other city that has a large bike population has, easy ways to get into the city at all times of day with your bike.  TL;DR:  Seattle needs a 22 - 24 hour transit system that is reliable and on time before they start designing the city for bicyclists."
Seattle,3dsb4s,kusuriya,1 point,Sun Jul 19 14:58:53 2015 UTC,"Seattle transit is wayyy more bike friendly than Chicago (which is the other place I've extensively used transit) No rush hour bans, etc in Seattle. And what sound transit bus takes 2 hours from Kent?   The 150 barely takes an hour, even at rush hour to go from Kent Station to Westlake.   the 6:46 is exactly 1 hour: http://metro.kingcounty.gov/schedules/150/n0.html  I've never tried taking a bike on the sounder in the peak direction (I reverse commuted to Tacoma with a bike though for a summer and that was awesome) but link you don't have to hang your bike, you can just get on with it and stand with it. That's what I always had to do on the L - no bike racks (when not at rush hour - because bikes are banned at rush hour).  And it is what I have done on Link when there was luggage in the bike rack.   There's also locking the bike at the sounder station as an option, and using pronto downtown.   I don't know what bus you were trying to get on that took 2 hours from Kent though, seriously. did it go to redmond first or something?"
Seattle,3dsb4s,alexfrancisburchard,3,Sun Jul 19 15:05:53 2015 UTC,"nope just about every route from the transit station takes 1 hr 50 - 2 hrs during peak times, and you are not supposed to stand with your bike on the link, I found that out by getting kicked off of the link by a fare enforcement officer."

I've had this problem with people parking in front of the garage entrance to my apartment building. Red curb, three no parking and towing signs, but some jackass still inconveniences a building of 100 people who now can't get their cars in and out.   You can't just call the tow company and have the car removed if it is on a public street. The SPD has to come out and write a ticket first. After the car has been ticketed can call to have a tow truck dispatched.  The only time I've been able to even get a ticket written was when after 2 hours, a police car just happened to arrest someone on the corner.  I politely approached an officer after they were done and asked if they could write a ticket if they had time.   This is a much bigger road so I imagine it might get a quicker response.  But it looks like there are already 4 cars parked so maybe not."

Seattle,3dsb4s,rainbowmoonheartache,2,Sun Jul 19 06:53:16 2015 UTC,"The number for the SPD's non emergency is (206) 625-5011. My parents driveway is regularly blocked and the non-emergency line normally gets a reasonably quick response (20-40 minutes) for parking enforcement. They normally ask for the car to only be ticketed, not towed, but if a tow truck is called, they show up quickly after parking enforcement."

Seattle,3dsb4s,derrickito1,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:00:43 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I was very familiar with the non-emergency number. I guess of the 5-6 time this happened (for cars that were there for at least an hour, not the inconsiderate idiots who still blocked people but ""just for a minute"" while they went inside to a friends apt for 10 min), I know that 2-3 drove off without a ticket in 2-6 hours, one got a ticket, but not towed and 1-2 disappeared without me seeing it, but after 2-4 hours without a ticket. I suppose there was a slim chance one of them was ticketed and towed and I didn't see it, but I would be very surprised.   They did bust some in-progress car prowlers for me though!

Although this is anecdotal, I really think the frequency of people blocking the bike lane on Dexter (where I commute) has decreased over the past several months since I started making a point of confronting every person that blocks the lane. In some cases when it's a delivery/moving truck, I bother the manager of the building they're parked in front of too.  People that park in the bike lane are selfish. I'm not hoping to convince them that what they're doing is wrong, but if they learn that taking a shortcut is going to get them hassled (or ticketed), they're less likely to do it again."

Seattle,3dsb4s,trentsgir,8,Sun Jul 19 13:07:54 2015 UTC,"Come on, don't be a smart ass. If I called the police every time someone broke any traffic law, I'd have a continuous open phone call with dispatch.  I personally hate it when entitled drivers park in the bike lane, because it's both illegal and dangerous to cyclists who must make an unexpected lane change (often after a curve with low visibility). Therefore I ask them to move and call the police if they don't leave. Since I want to take action, that's the correct action for me to take.  Could I call the police for people jaywalking? Yes, but I don't. Jaywalking (done with care) doesn't impact anyone. Parking in the bike lane actively blocks traffic. See if you can spot the difference. (And yes, people who jaywalk right in front of traffic deserve tickets. That's why the law is on the books.)"

Are you keeping your child close? It is also the law that all trail users must keep right (it's posted along the trail). I see pedestrians walking down the middle, walking on the left, kids darting out into the middle, dog leashes blocking the entire trail, etc. While you may have the legal right-of-way, you also have personal responsibility for your own (and your child's) safety. That means keeping to the right. If you are doing that, I don't know why you would have to dodge bikes. I've spent countless hours riding the BG trail and never seen anyone have an issue with a pedestrian on the right."

Seattle,3dzyhh,bigfinnrider,16,Tue Jul 21 06:05:31 2015 UTC,"fyi, from a cyclists perspective: we do yield to you. but we are going faster than you. when you hear a ""on your left"" please know that means that you are about to have a cyclist passing you on your left. if you move to your left when you hear that called out, you're moving directly into the path of someone on a bike, that's real scary. also, if your child or you like to unexpectedly dart left and right running suddenly, you might create a situation where you are run over. in a multi use environment, try to keep that in mind. same with pets with long leashes.  if your child can't control themselves, being on a multi use path might not be the best place for you. no one wants to run you or your child over, but unpredictability causes problems.   also, pedestrians, don't walk several people wide in large groups and take up the entire trail. double that down eh?"

Seattle,3dzyhh,tucker_is_furry,3,Tue Jul 21 04:31:23 2015 UTC,"The BGT is definitely a bit hairy during commute times, but if you are predictable in your actions no one will run in to you or require you to ""duck away"" (although you may not be comfortable with the crowding, but that is a different issue than whether you will collide with a cyclist).  Outside of commute times I've never seen anything close to a problem (other than the large oblivious pedestrian groups).  When I was training for a running race I was running through the stretch from UW to the Fremont bridge several times a week and never had an issue with bikes being too close (and I was even one of those annoying runners that stayed on the bike only section when the trail completely splits because running on concrete is awful).  Now I bike commute regularly through that area and I will say the risk to a bicyclist is dramatically higher than it was when I was on foot.  When I have a clear section I do speed up (18-20mph, yes, I admit I speed a bit), but I slow way down when passing especially if I can't give an extremely wide berth.  I've seen plenty of bad passes and close calls with head on collisions between cyclists, but the only time I've seen a close call with pedestrians has been near UW when they suddenly go from the right side of the trail to the left without looking or when there is a group of 3 or 4 and someone decides to suddenly move left with no warning.  I'm sorry you're having problems with the bikes and I don't like victim blaming, but having specifics of what behavior is causing you problems is helpful.  I sincerely doubt that you ""duck away"" from cyclists.  If you continue on the predictable path that you are on, no harm will come of you and cyclists will yield.  In a bike / pedestrian collision no one wins, but the potential for pain on the cyclist's part is extremely high (ever known someone that has gone over the handle bars) so rest assured that the cyclist will do whatever it takes to avoid hitting you."

Cool temps, fall winds, and 5pm sunsets."
Seattle,3dympn,RoyalWithChee,4,Mon Jul 20 16:33:22 2015 UTC,Not necessarily in November though. We usually get  one or two heavy rainstorms and windstorms in/around November
Seattle,3dympn,brakos,3,Mon Jul 20 16:44:21 2015 UTC,"November is statistically our stormiest month.  We can get the somewhat unusual hard rain any time of the year, or windstorms anytime in the winter, but they're most common in November--specifically, toward the end of the month.  That doesn't mean it's not still beautiful, or that you won't get some nice, clear, calm days...but pack for rain and wind.   Umbrellas aren't so good here--city streets are too crowded, and they'll just blow inside out if it's windy.  Think water-resistant jacket, with a hood.  The first year I moved here, I didn't know this.  My mother came to visit over Thanksgiving.  I knew she'd enjoy Victoria, so I booked us a package deal with the Victoria Clipper:  the boat up and back + a night at the Empress Hotel, leaving the Friday after Thanksgiving.  The day came, and it was raining, and the wind was howling, and there were gale warnings out on the Strait.  But that travel package was non-refundable if the Clipper wasn't cancelled, and they'd confirmed they were sailing, gales or no.  And my mother, Great Depression survivor that she was, would be damned if we were going to just waste that money...so off we went.  I think I was the only passenger on board who didn't lose my breakfast on the way up.  Victoria was lovely--cold and clear--but the trip back was more of the same.  We hit wave after wave after wave that shook the boat and rattled my teeth.  I hardly ever get seasick, but that time I did, as did everyone else on the boat, including some of the crew.  I always tell people, to really see Seattle properly, you need to get out on the water--a tour boat, a ferry, whatever.  But in your case...wait to book it when you know the weather won't make it more of a thrill ride than you'd planned."
Seattle,3dympn,casagordita,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:53:08 2015 UTC,It's a weird month. Between five day stretches of near constant rain you'll have a couple days of unseasonably warm and dry windy days. Temps vary wildly not just from week to week but during the same day. You can scrape ice off your windshield in the morning and comfortably walk outside in shorts a couple hours later. As a year-round hiker it's by far the most unpredictable month to plan for outdoor activities.
Seattle,3dympn,thegodsarepleased,4,Mon Jul 20 17:09:52 2015 UTC,"Definitely unpredictable, but having lived here my entire life, I learned long ago that you just kind of have to tell the weather to fuck off and go do what you had planned anyways."

All of my activities have to be planned around the fact that it's just going to get dark at 4:30 PM and that really limits the amount of outdoors things I can do, since the sun doesn't even come up until well after 8 AM in the winter.  I'd like to try some winter sports but with the coming winter being as warm as it will be (meteorologists/climatologists are predicting temps in the mid-50s to low-60s throughout the winter due to El Nino), I don't think I'll get a chance to really try out skiing or snowboarding."

On a beautiful calm sunny Sunday afternoon, there were at least a dozen open unrestricted parking spots at the spot we used by the Blue Ribbon Cooking School.  I'm not sure why there would be a law stating you can park there only if you don't happen to remove a boat from your car."
Seattle,3dusy2,phinneypat,8,Mon Jul 20 19:35:35 2015 UTC,Pretty much anywhere on the east side of the lake on Fairview Ave E.  Terry Pettus park has a ton of parking right beside it.

Seattle,3dusy2,Probably_Stoned,3,Sun Jul 19 20:35:01 2015 UTC,There is a little small hand-carry launch down in Fairview park (NE side of the lake) and I believe you can also down in the big park on the south end where the wooden boat park is.

I more commonly hear discussions on how the city should (or shouldn't) minimalize the effects that all of these high wage positions on Seattle. For example: how the city should deal with increasing housing demand/price. Or just general discontent with how the city is changing/people getting priced out.

I know this sounds a little like ""your friends are nut jobs"" and there is a bit of truth to that characterization of the reaction you are getting here, but I'd honestly like to better understand what the defining characteristics are of a a group of people who would honestly voice these opinions and feel supported by others around them.

I don't know who is claiming this exactly, or if you've just chosen to distill the topic down to that faulty strawman-like statement yourself.  The truth is that this tech-centric economic development (and its resulting stratification of the cost of living) is what the City of Seattle has effectively chosen to cast their lot with, for their own economic benefit. This is a prime source of various forms of tax revenue... probably not necessarily in direct business taxes given all the breaks Amazon and other companies get, but in residual tax revenue from these companies doing business, and from all these workers who in turn get paid loads of money. The tech industry isn't a bad guy in the resulting cost of living spike so much as they're just doing what works best for them and this is the byproduct.  The real discussion is in what workers who aren't part of this tech gravy train, and aren't in a similarly lucrative career or living situation, need to do to deal with this. There is nothing anyone can do to stop this economic trend in Seattle.  I advocate that people struggling to afford to live in Seattle consider moving away, at least for a while. If you consider that costly and expensive, consider your current life is costly and expensive now, and is only going to get worse in the foreseeable future."

Seattle,3dyobv,harlottesometimes,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:22:08 2015 UTC,"Well, the city could do it, if the city was allowed to tax income at a certain level. But to be perfectly clear, state law does not allow the city to do this, and the state constitution does not allow the state to do this either. I'm pretty sure that federal law cannot, under the US Constitution, prohibit states from taxing income in whatever way they wish to do so.  But laws can be changed. Imagine we've amended the state constitution to do this, and enacted whatever statute is necessary at the state level. Say we decide that a given amount of income is ""obscene"". Then create an income tax bracket starting at that level, and set the tax rate at that bracket high enough that few would bother paying anyone above that rate.  Most economists agree that the ""optimal"" rate, with respect to maximizing revenue (not maximizing production), is around 70%. But if your goal was to actually prevent anyone from receiving significant income, you obviously need to set it higher. Probably at least 99%, maybe 99.9%. If you set it at 100%, that would definitely work. Since the top federal rate is already 39.6%, you only need 100 minus 39.6, or 60.4%.  Personally, I don't think this is a good idea, and I don't know anyone who does. I'm all for taxing the rich (at e.g. California's top rate, 13.3%), but you can't do that if the rich pack up and leave! Most people though, aren't very well-versed in either law or economics, so I can understand if ""I don't like these new people moving in, make them go away"" makes sense to them."

Seattle,3dv14j,Silent_Seven,2,Mon Jul 20 14:35:05 2015 UTC,"Among the rules:  they limit where boats can be on the lake while the Blue Angels are flying--it's one of the things the Navy requires, you can't have anyone under the path of the most low-flying and tricky maneuvers.  Once they let you into the middle of the lake, they will insist that you keep your speed down--no wakes.  A horde of boats going full-throttle churns up the water, to the point that it's more dangerous for the hydros (I know some people really go just to see one flip and cartwheel spectacularly, but the hydro drivers would prefer not to). It's mostly the Coast Guard Auxiliary and Seafair volunteers that patrol and enforce those rules, and some people try to blow them off because they're amateurs...but there are also regular Coast Guard boats out there and they'll drive the point home with an expensive citation for negligent operation (and BUI, and possession of marijuana--the Coast Guard goes by federal law, not state--and too many passengers, and not enough life jackets, and anything else they can find, once you have their attention).

Seattle,3duq68,meow_purrr,3,Sun Jul 19 17:43:28 2015 UTC,There wouldn't be any sewage overflows this time of year.
Seattle,3duq68,jnorm00,2,Sun Jul 19 20:58:35 2015 UTC,Sewage overflows occur in the fall and spring during excessive rainfall. In the summertime lake Washington is good to go. I personally avoid bodies of water that are not linked to Puget Sound.
Seattle,3duq68,Cowboyridge,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:00:29 2015 UTC,"That sure does sound like there's an existing sewer outflow problem that hasn't been fixed yet. I'd stay away, personally."
Seattle,3duq68,rationalomega,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:22:42 2015 UTC,"For those who are new here, the city's sewage system is designed to spill into Lakes Washington and Union when overflowing... which they often do during periods of heavier rain. Yes, they should have fixed this decades ago (... like most pieces of outdated infrastructure in Seattle). At least they're fixing some of it now."
Seattle,3duq68,deadmandrawing,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:30:51 2015 UTC,"Thanks, I didn't know that. I'm not sure I wanted to know that, but that's reality for you."
Seattle,3duq68,rationalomega,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:47:15 2015 UTC,During large rain events sometime parts of the city system default to a combined surface run off and waste water flow.  This is rare and installations are being done along Lake Washington's shore in that area to make the event even much less likely.

Actually I just found it. For your reading pleasure.  Monday, June 18, 2012 Goodspaceguy, 2012 candidate for Congress from Washington State, District 7  Dear Voters and fellow Crew Members of our Spaceship Earth, 2012 June 16:  This is Message #43 from me, Goodspaceguy, on my blog Our Spaceship Earth.  I am now a 2012 candidate for US Representative to Congress from the 7th Congressional District of Washington State.   I, Goodspaceguy, ask that you think of our Earth as a natural spaceship that travels in our solar system around our star, the Sun, and with our Sun travels within our Milky Way Galaxy, a collection of hundreds of billions of solar systems.   Our knowledge of science and technology is continuing to advance.   Guided by the Science of Economics, let’s solve national and world problems from the viewpoint that we are crewmembers and voters of our Spaceship Earth.   Some centuries have greatness in them. In the 20th Century, we Earthlings moved from the Horse and Buggy Age into the Automobile Age and into the Airplane Age and into the Movie and Television Age and into the Computer Age and into the beginning of the Space Age. We can raise the living standard even more than we have.  A great goal for our new 21st Century is to start the Age of Orbital Space Colonization! It’s almost here. On 2012 May 25, Naturalized American Elon Musk and his Space X Team enabled Space X to be the first privately owned space rocket company to deliver supplies to the International Space Station. In 2006 and 2007, American Robert T. Bigelow of Nevada and his team put experimental, inflatable habitats into orbit. Also, the Russians are available for hire to send cargo and people up into orbital space. By hiring rocket launch services, the people of any nation can participate in the Space Age.   Space Colonization should have been the goal from the beginning of our American space program. We should already have the beginning orbital space colonies with over 260 habitats, but we don’t. We only have about the equivalent of 6 habitats joined together to form the International Space Station. We have already spent the necessary money, but unfortunately our leaders were not educated in orbital space colonization and so wasted billions and billions of dollars of our space money and burnt up much of our space material, that the space colonists could have used.   The beginning colonization of orbital space should become NASA’s main research project: helping private enterprise to start space colonization. Private owners can colonize space more effectively, but NASA can help. The space colonizers will need much help. NASA should stop burning up our space assets!   About 400 million years ago, life came up from the sea and colonized the land of Earth. Now, the colonization of orbital space by life from Earth is of similar significance. You live in a time of historic transformation: Humans moving up to the High Frontier.  Before the arrival of the next killer asteroid or killer comet or nuclear war, I, Goodspaceguy, want us to spread life from Earth out into our solar system. The space colonists should get ready to mine away the next killer asteroid or comet that threatens Earth. The space colonists should use its material to expand the beginning orbital space colonies. The space colonists should also mine and use the materials of the near Earth asteroids and comets to help expand their orbital space colonies. This should be cheaper than the high cost of bringing all the needed material up from Earth. Let’s follow the low-cost path to the Fantastic Future. Let NASA help the private space colonies.  I, Goodspaceguy, study economics with the goal of raising the living standard by increasing production and jobs. Let’s improve the quality-of-life. Please vote for those small-spending candidates who understand the Science of Economics, led by incentive.  So that we can live longer and healthier, I, Goodspaceguy, want more medical research, rejuvenation research, and longevity research. Let’s continue the great and surprising advances of the Twentieth Century into our new Twenty-first Century.  Because Maryland donated the land that became Washington D.C., the people of Washington D. C. should be allowed to vote federally through the state of Maryland.  I, Goodspaceguy, want beautiful Puerto Rico to become the 51st state.  The Planned Economies worked poorly. The planners usually got things wrong. Please support the consumer directed, Competitive Free Market where the prices for the different kinds of labor are set by the interaction of the Supply of different kinds of labor with the Demand for that labor, not sabotaged by the economy crippling minimum wage.  The Competitive Free Market works for you, the consumers, but the planners sometimes interfere and sabotage your Competitive Free Market Economy, stopping it from re-adjusting to serve you, the consumers. Using prices, Supply and Demand, profit and incentive, the Free Market tries to readjust. But you have voted many misguided leaders into power who don’t understand incentive and the Science of Economics. This lack of knowledge of the profit and wealth incentives and the Science of Economics has sabotaged our economy and put harmful rigidities into our economy that has led to job loss, suffering, decreased production, and a lower living standard for us, the people. The living standard could be much higher if we allowed the consumer directed, Competitive Free Market to function. In order to raise the living standard, we should un-sabotage our economy. We should start by abolishing the job-destroying minimum wage. What does the minimum wage do? It destroys jobs. Jobs and employers go bye-bye. The minimum wage helps create many homeless people and decreases the production of goods and services that could raise our living standard. Crime increases. Some religious people might say that God created Supply and Demand to continually adjust the changing prices of labor in our Exchange Economy, but the servants of Satan have introduced rigidity and suffering by establishing the job-destroying, employer-destroying minimum wage.  Born in Minnesota, I was university educated in Germany, Sweden, and America. My Bachelor’s and Master’s Degrees were in business with minors in ECONOMICS.

According to their very own web site you can find it here.  I hear people like it.  You probably ought to give Northwest microbrews a try though.  At least sample the beers of your maybe adopted home.  There are no Kolachis anywhere.  Those are a Houston area phenomenon.    We don't build roads like Houston does.  Give up driving fast.  Give up driving anywhere without serious clog.  You know how it is on 59 and 610 around Reliant?  That's every highway here every day during rush hour, which lasts 4 hrs at least.  Give up having a plot of land bigger than your house.  Give up on houses over 2,000 square feet, if that.  We live Japanese style here.  We pack things into tight, steep little plots.  You know how everyone's moving to Katy and now the tollway is clogged full of people driving back for work?  that's every highway here.    We have a smidgeon more public transport than you have, and it's better, but still not enough to make you really want to use it, at least not at first.  You might not get air conditioning here.  Most of the year you won't need it, but about a month out of the year you will, and wonder why the fuck nobody put any in your building.  On the other hand it's a dry heat, and the insect population here is about 10000000 times less than yours.  Dry ground, dry air, not many mosquitoes living on the steep hills, because there's no place for that many puddles.   The one thing we do have is big ol spiders, like 2"" large and they bite.    No BBQ here.  Sorry, we're not the South or the Midwest.  This comes up about once a month, ""Where can I get BBQ?""  The answer is always damn near almost nowhere.  Maybe a few are alright, nothing however will be what you are used to.  Can you handle months of 8 hours or less of light, unending low clouds, drizzle, and no sun?  If not, don't come here.  If you've ever lived in a Pacific / Japanese / Northern European / Western Canadian / Alaskan climate before, you can disregard this.    In general the sooner you drop the Lone Star bullshit the better off you'll be here.  If that thought terrifies you, don't come."

It's nice to have the side-by-side comparison, this gives me a way better picture than the generic stuff. Definitely would give the microbrews a try, and not really afraid to drop the BBQ and the lone star. Houston, or the south in general, aint really my thing. Spiders might be a deterrent however."

Seattle,3dwhy3,casagordita,2,Mon Jul 20 04:57:50 2015 UTC,"I keep hearing about those ginormous spiders we have here, but in 22 years on Western Washington, I've never seen one.  Sure, we have lots of little, harmless spiders, but the big ones just aren't that common.  Ditto the poisonous ones--we have a few of those, but I've only seen one or two that I recognized (black widows--I grew up around a lot of those bastards, but they're unusual here) and I've never known anyone who got a serious bite.  So I wouldn't worry too much about them.  You'll be mostly escaping the cockroaches, and I will take our lots of harmless spiders (and a few nasty ones) over the overwhelming hordes of cockroaches I saw in Houston, ANY day!  Also, we have no poisonous snakes on this side of the mountains, and no fire ants.  Also no armadillos (which I've always thought were kinda cool, in spite of the leprosy thing--can you bring a few with you?)  If you live in Seattle proper, then /u/my_lucid_nightmare is right--you'll have to be a fairly successful architect to have a big house or a big plot of land around it.  If that's a priority, though, you can always live in the suburbs, some of which are actually pretty pleasant.  A little space (or even a lot, depending on where you locate) is still affordable out here, and we do still have most of the amenities of civilization.  Some folks in Seattle think the suburbs are a fate worse than death, but other folks think that label better applies to living in a tiny space, jammed up against your neighbors.  To each their own.  Some people weren't born on the west coast, but they were definitely born to live here.  If Houston and the South aren't your thing, maybe Seattle is.  It's worth a try.  Good luck!"
Seattle,3dwhy3,theultrayik,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:27:59 2015 UTC,"The big spiders are around, but Seattle has nothing on Spokane when it comes to spiders.  Spokane is basically filled with buildings that are insulated with millions of 3"" hobo spiders."
Seattle,3dwhy3,my_lucid_nightmare,2,Mon Jul 20 05:45:14 2015 UTC,"The main issue with living in Exurbia is the drive back to town.  If you can arrange it so you don't need that, I completely agree.  I can't emphasize the ""road differences"" to a Houstonian enough.  In Houston (And all of Tejas really) they believe in using sprawling, ever expanding loops of roads around the major metropolitan areas.  Every 10 years or less, whether they need it or not, a shiny mighty new 6 lane highway goes in, named for somebody's daddy.  We just simply do not build roads like that.  If you move here, and think ""oh, I can get a sweet home in Marysville that's only 40 miles from downtown"" are you ever in for a bad surprise.   I'd say your guessed-at commute travel times per distance in Houston .. double the time you'll need for the same distance here.  Expect a lot of that will be used up on 2 lane massively over-subscribed roads trying to fight your way to the same highways everyone else out there is also fighting their way to get on.  You will not see a new six lane road in the Northwest in the past 60 years.  Ever?  We just simply do not believe in it here, it's a matter of religious faith that ""we cannot build more roads to solve our traffic.""  To a Native Texan this may look stupid, but there's some wisdom to it.  Our land is very hilly and rocky.  You don't just get given wide swaths of easily plowable scrub land, perfect for a new road.  Here, you have to follow the contours of the land to build, and this tends to result in very few ""easily usable"" pathways for highways, and those are already all used.  So while there appears to be widespread agreement in Houston, Dallas over whether or not to sprawl to grow economically, here we're more like Austin, or Austin built on a steep set of hills and valleys.  There's kind of no consensus here whether roads are the right way to go, many in positions of authority here will say we need more trains and buses and bikes and taller buildings in Seattle's existing footprint before they'll agree to widening a 2 lane road into a 4, or in repaving the existing 3-4 lane roads.  Houston is booming, Seattle is booming, and both have almost completely opposite ways to solve city growth challenges.  I find it fascinating as I shuffle back and forth for work between the worlds.  Here's all about trying to grow beyond the personal occupancy vehicle, there its still let's find a way to put in another road (and toll for it).  We're arguing over tolls for years, they just roll out a new 6 lane stretch between big new suburbs to the point it might cost $100 a week to roll from suburbia all the way to downtown Houston each day.  We flip out over tolls 1/4 that amount.  Of course we don't get a nice big new roadway for our tolling, just the same shitty old 2-lane or 3-lane state highway we have used without tolling for decades.  Big difference between that and the Katy Freeway.   Hell, Texas has 2-4 lanes of side-road per big freeway they call the ""frontage road.""  THOSE are wider/newer/faster than our existing big highways in most cases, no joke.  Texas believes in its concrete highways.  Here we pour some asphalt over the top of whatever the fuck they built in the 1950s, then argue with each other why it doesn't need more lanes, while others say screw roads entirely let's just all ride bikes regardless of age or physical ability, and all live downtown in magical new 60 story highrises perfect for every social occasion, because they want us to look like Hong Kong more than Los Angeles.  People here drive scared, they drive slow, they drive less aggressive than anything you've experienced in Houston.  Here if you try to stomp on the gas you get dirty looks or some passive-aggressive stalwart corking you in by driving the speed limit in the left or center lane.  They say they are going to start ticketing for that, but I haven't seen it.  Here you also need to hands-free mount your phone - they will definitely ticket for that if they see you talking / texting and driving.   They'll also ticket pedestrians downtown for jaywalking, just in case you do find a place to park, obey those traffic lights on foot.  And watch out for bikes.  Way more cyclists on the road here than anywhere I've seen in Texas, outside of probably Austin.  Just be aware, every month some noob comes on here complaining about the drivers.  I could see a whole section of the wiki on how Northwest driving is different, because I've driven all over the USA for work, and noplace else I've been to drives as slow or weirdly indecisive like they do in Puget Sound.  Seriously if you drive north from Portland you can feel it changing outside of Olympia.  The road speeds drop, the left-lane campers start showing up."

Architecture here is over-saturated, you'll have more job opportunities in architecture in Houston- but of course that depends what sort of firm you are looking to work for.  If you still want to move over here: move here first, apply from here with a Seattle address. I review resumes for my firm, and essentially anything not in the state goes in the ""no"" stack- simply because you can tell they are just fishing around everywhere (cover letters are telling.)   You'll have higher chances of finding a job in the fall/winter - spring/summer I get resumes from students, so the pool is much larger- and usually hiring someone from UW works for the firm as their education focuses on architectural issues and design interventions that work in the region.

I don't think this is aimed at residents. Too much work there to make it worth hassling over. I could be wrong, but I think this is a non issue for a far majority of residents."
Seattle,3dq6xy,GoldenFalcon,8,Sat Jul 18 15:03:24 2015 UTC,"It was targeted at businesses and apartment complexes to get them to compost - many apartment complexes and lots of business recycle, but don't have a separate bin for food/yard waste to be picked up and composted.

It's nonsense haha  I got an email saying I wasn't composting properly. The bin was full... so whatever food scraps I had went into my white double tied garbage bag. Then I got a warning... which means someone was opening up my garbage bags, snooping through them, then somehow connecting it to me.  It's sooooo silly."
Seattle,3dq6xy,Duffalpha,6,Sat Jul 18 21:49:47 2015 UTC,"As someone who worked in a ""green"" hotel, where they have 3 different bins... it all goes into one big dumpster at the end of the day. So, I agree, it is certainly aimed at them."
Seattle,3dq6xy,GoldenFalcon,3,Sat Jul 18 23:20:00 2015 UTC,"Sorry, there is already a Supreme Court ruling which sets the precedent that once it is thrown away in a bin for pickup you have no expectation of privacy.   https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_v._Greenwood"
Seattle,3dq6xy,PurpleComyn,4,Sun Jul 19 02:35:01 2015 UTC,"Not in Washington State:   In rendering our opinion, we acknowledge that the United States Supreme Court has held to the contrary under the Fourth Amendment in Greenwood. We also recognize that the opinions of the Supreme Court, while not controlling on state courts construing their own constitutions, are nevertheless important guides on the subjects they squarely address... However, we decline to follow federal precedent for two reasons."
Seattle,3dq6xy,Mandamus,5,Sun Jul 19 03:44:45 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the input.   However I don't think it is ironclad either. This is notable:   Boland's trash was in his can and sitting on the curb in expectation that it would be picked up by a licensed garbage collector. This leads us to the conclusion that it falls squarely within the contemplated meaning of a ""private affair"". While it may be true an expectation that children, scavengers, or snoops will not sift through one's garbage is unreasonable, average persons would find it reasonable to believe the garbage they place in their trash cans will be protected from warrantless governmental intrusion.   If the garbage collector is doing the review then this may skirt this decision as the garbage collector is exactly who you expect to pick up and have access to your garbage. As long as evidence of crime isn't passed on to police, I don't think they have too much ground to stand on.   Just to be clear where I stand, in school we reviewed this federal case and I wrote an opinion that exactly mirrored the dissenting opinion, without knowing it, and it sounded similar to the things said here."
Seattle,3dq6xy,PurpleComyn,4,Sun Jul 19 03:54:00 2015 UTC,"That's certainly the language that the City will quote in defense of the ordinance. I'd imagine that the key is going to be the extent to which the trash collector acts as an agent of the City.  For example, it almost certainly wouldn't be constitutional for the police to tell a trash collector to sort through one customer's garbage and take photos. On the other hand, it probably would be constitutional for a trash collector to call the police if he coincidentally noticed evidence of a crime in a customer's trash. The composting ordinance is somewhere in between."

Seattle,3dq6xy,NeShep,-2,Sun Jul 19 03:11:55 2015 UTC,Other than they've been enforcing a recycling standard for the last billion years or so...what does it matter whether the trash haulers see what you've thrown away?
Seattle,3dq6xy,somenewuser,6,Sat Jul 18 20:26:15 2015 UTC,Um it matters because it sets a precedent that the government is allowed to go through everyone's trash just in case there's something in there they don't like.
Seattle,3dq6xy,shitduke,5,Sat Jul 18 20:32:33 2015 UTC,"That precedent was already set over ten years ago when Seattle began enforcing mandatory recycling.  Also, no, in Washington it isn't anytime ""there's something in there they don't like,"" because the state courts have already said that law enforcement has to get a warrant before digging through garbage left out at the curb.  This is a service provider--in this case, the city through Seattle Public Utilities--saying ""you can't put X in the garbage and, if you do, we will charge you extra for violating that rule.""  Is it similarly invasive to insist that no hazardous materials be put into the trash and then the haulers noting that you bagged up a bunch of lead paint and motor oil?"
Seattle,3dq6xy,somenewuser,2,Sat Jul 18 20:37:27 2015 UTC,"That precedent was already set over ten years ago when Seattle began enforcing mandatory recycling.   I don't understand why you keep bringing this up like it should affect my opinion of the policy, but I'm glad you did:   Also, no, in Washington it isn't anytime ""there's something in there they don't like,"" because the state courts have already said that law enforcement has to get a warrant before digging through garbage left out at the curb.   So, as you point out, we already had a precedent for the government digging through my trash. As expected, this precedent is now being invoked to dig through more of my trash, for a different reason this time. What will they start looking for two years from now?   This is a service provider--in this case, the city through Seattle Public Utilities--saying ""you can't put X in the garbage and, if you do, we will charge you extra for violating that rule.""   Oh great! So it's not the government doing it. I suppose that means I can just ignore any fines I get. Because it's just a public utility. The government totally isn't involved!   Is it similarly invasive to insist that no hazardous materials be put into the trash and then the haulers noting that you bagged up a bunch of lead paint and motor oil?   If waste management had a government mandate to go around scrutinizing everyone's trash doing mental math and eyeballing things really well just in case they threw away some lead paint, then yeah, that would sound pretty invasive to me."
Seattle,3dq6xy,shitduke,-1,Sat Jul 18 20:49:52 2015 UTC,"What will they start looking for two years from now?   Whatever they deem not suitable for garbage.  Turns out, this policy is influenced by elected officials so, unlike a private trash hauler, if you don't like it you can complain to the Mayor.  But it's still not an invasion of privacy.   I suppose that means I can just ignore any fines I get. Because it's just a public utility. The government totally isn't involved!   It's not a fine, at least not a fine in the sense that you're using ""fine,"" where you can be hauled into court for not paying it.  It is a surcharge for not following the rules of the service provider.  You will not be thrown into jail for not paying it, though you may have a late fee.  (Hey, that reminds me, is it a violation of your privacy to have someone monitoring for your bill being paid late and then charging you?)   then yeah, that would sound pretty invasive to me.   OK, so then we're not allowed to have rules about what is thrown into the garbage?  Because it's all judgment at some point by some person.  And I'm going to have to simply disagree with you there, and there's no real way to reconcile that belief with living in a society that happens to have rules of conduct that are enforced in various ways."
Seattle,3dq6xy,somenewuser,4,Sat Jul 18 21:04:27 2015 UTC,"You can have whatever rules you want about anything; it doesn't mean your method of enforcing the rule doesn't set a really stupid policy.  I'm pretty much done having this discussion with someone who equates ""monitoring"" a bill with monitoring everyone's trash.  And actually yes, the government is involved. It was the government's idea. It's the government's policy. The government is extremely fucking obviously involved."

As a matter of fact, if you read my reply above, I specifically said ""it is the city--through Seattle Public Utilities""...last I checked, the City of Seattle is definitely a government.   someone who equates ""monitoring"" a bill with monitoring everyone's trash.   OK, so is it a violation of your privacy for the hauler to note that you put out two bins worth of trash instead of just one and charge you the extra $10 for the second bin?  You can rage and call it stupid and stomp your feet and get all angry about those evil government-employed trash haulers looking at what you throw away, but the point is that your privacy is no more being violated than it would be if someone walking down the street and looking at the bags you left by the curb.  There is no responsibility for the government, or anyone else, to avert their eyes from activities in the public right of way.  This isn't communication between you and another person over a telephone line.  It's more like you and another person speaking aloud to each other on a bus."

The government has to spend a lot of money to dispose of garbage. Recycling and composting offset that cost    The state is saying, you must recycle and compost to use our facilities.  If you have a problem with that then don't use them.   The Orwellian control and spy state is separate because there is no other choice. There are choices here for you to dispose of your garbage other than curb side pick up. Don't believe for a second you are losing any rights either. That garbage was always public and always scrutinized by sanitation workers for illegally thrown away items."

Seattle,3dq6xy,shitduke,-2,Sat Jul 18 22:45:50 2015 UTC,"So to be clear, you don't actually have a privacy complaint. You think that trying to keep recyclable or compostable waste out of a landfill is Orwellian. That isn't my understanding of the word."
Seattle,3dq6xy,neverbetterthanlate,2,Sat Jul 18 23:00:26 2015 UTC,"I think any time we forfeit expectations of privacy or discretion, we come closer to an Orwellian surveillance state. Any time useful do-gooders celebrate those forfeitures, the path towards fewer freedoms become more clear.  Twenty years ago, this wouldn't have been debated. Trash-diggers were once rightfully villainized as nosy, snooping and generally no-good. We may no longer expect the contents of our garbage to be private, but that has not always been true.  I mourn the rights and privileges you probably never knew."
Seattle,3dq6xy,harlottesometimes,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:27:51 2015 UTC,"We forfeit a realistic expectation of privacy for garbage when we ask someone else to deal with it for us, it is as simple as that. Humans have to deal with our garbage, and it is unreasonable to imagine they don't see the things they are disposing of. It is an intrinsic fact of garbage collection, it has been an issue forever.  There are many places in the U.S. where they don't even recycle, but humans still have to look at your trash as they move it from one place to another. This specific ""right"" / ""privilege"" you are mourning is imaginary."

Seattle,3dq6xy,-pinkmarshmallow-,2,Sat Jul 18 23:54:24 2015 UTC,"Your assertion is shit.    What constitutes improper snooping in the trash is a question that courts have dug into before. The United States Supreme Court, in a case in 1988, said that the decision to throw something away effectively puts that object into the public domain. The police do not need a warrant, the court ruled, to grab a suspect’s garbage and take it down to the station for examination in a drug case.  But lawyers for the plaintiffs in Seattle said that Washington law has mostly gone the other way. The state Constitution, they said, has stringent and specific language about privacy. And the Washington Supreme Court held in a case in 1990 that law enforcement officials needed a warrant to search a suspect’s trash for evidence in a criminal case.   If even Law Enforcement needs a warrant to go through trash in Washington State, then private companies (working for the government) can be held to the same standard."
Seattle,3dq6xy,-pinkmarshmallow-,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:02:18 2015 UTC,That's not true at all. The private company may have a business reason to search the trash. You aren't subjected to them by law to turn your waste over for search.
Seattle,3dq6xy,CityOfWin,-1,Mon Jul 20 09:15:35 2015 UTC,"The law is ridiculous.  Garbage collectors have work to do, they can't be standing around eyeballing ""ten percent"" in every can.  And garbage should be private.  Do you want people going through your old documents?  Your cut-up credit cards?  Your empty pill bottles?  Not to mention, there is no way of actually knowing who placed something in a bin.  It could have been someone walking down the street.  It's hardly enforceable, there's no evidence tying it to the can owner, and it's invasive.  The intentions are good, but the brains behind it were empty."
Seattle,3dq6xy,theultrayik,18,Sat Jul 18 16:14:33 2015 UTC,Garbage hasn't been private forever. Once you put it on the curve it is considered public. Court precedent.

Seattle,3drxl2,New_new_account2,12,Sun Jul 19 05:51:52 2015 UTC,"The switch from borosilicate to soda lime glass is because more people drop pyrex to break them then manage to break them through thermal shock.  Soda lime is more resistant to drops, borosilicate is more resistant to rapid shifts in temperature.  Plus it wasn't meth Pyrex was famous for being used for.  When making crack cocaine they would cook cocaine hcl, baking soda, and some water in a microwave.  Then you dump ice water in it.  That thermal shock is what you need borosilicate glass for.  Pyrex was convenient for doing this, but they didn't stop making boro Pyrex because of people cooking crack in them.  When you cook meth in a baking dish, you are just evaporating off the liquid, so there is little thermal shock; any type of glass works fine."

It was the most terrifying experience of my life. It took a long time for me to snap out of the madness. I don't know if he was dosed or what but I could easily believe he was in a similar state of mind. It was my fear of dying that almost led to me killing myself.

Seattle,3dpixv,DingoDanza,-8,Sat Jul 18 13:46:02 2015 UTC,"Yes... this is totally justified, tragic, heartbreaking, etcetc.   But... just raising the question here and curious about opinions... and knowing that officers ""trained to do so""... why in situations like this do they immediately HAVE to unload a bunch of gunshots to the chest?   It seems like tasers would be perfect... or a few shots to the shoulders/legs/etc would do wonders. Of course it can't be done in a lot of situations and you don't want officers unduly risking their lives.. but when it's a slow-moving barefoot guy with a knife? Yes it's scary as hell and he reacted perfectly as he was trained. .. but in a specific situation like this there was no solid risk to the officer's safety. Just a shame that the instant you make a move at a cop or twitch at all, no matter how misguided or drugged or overmatched you are...  you're basically dead.  How long until we get some perfectly logical and risk-free Robocops out there to keep our streets safe?"
Seattle,3dpixv,variousdinosaurs,4,Sat Jul 18 14:50:36 2015 UTC,"why in situations like this do they immediately HAVE to unload a bunch of gunshots to the chest?   Because there is no other method that is anywhere near as reliable for stopping a suspect from doing whatever they were doing.   It seems like tasers would be perfect   Tasers have many issues. To begin with, they are almost all single shot, which means that if they miss, the officer can often get injured or killed while they then try to draw their gun. Second, they aren't anywhere near as reliable. The hooks can fail to make contact, fail to stop to the suspect, or other things that cause it to not stop the suspect.    or a few shots to the shoulders/legs/etc would do wonders   No. If you're shooting your gun at all as a police officer, you are doing it for the purpose of stopping the suspect in the quickest way possible, which is by putting as many shots as needed into their center of mass. It is extremely difficult to hit even a ""slow"" suspect reliably in the arms or legs, and it isn't effective and can often result in death anyways.   It would be great if it were so simple. It sucks that even a single person has to die at the hands of police, and if there is ever something reliable enough to replace guns, cops will be the first in line to get them."
Seattle,3dpixv,SodaAnt,2,Sat Jul 18 16:50:29 2015 UTC,"Hindsight is 20/20. I'm not sure how you can say that this guy posed no real safety concern to the officer. How would you react if a big guy pulled a knife on you and started coming at you? I guarantee, you're not thinking ""Generally slow and not peak coordination, flat footed. No need to shoot, I'll just reason with him and maybe use some Judo or switch to the tazer.""   The fact of the matter is that the whole scene played out in less than 5 seconds. You don't have time to take those risks and make those decisions. When someone comes at the cop with a potentially lethal weapon, the cop is going to defend themselves just as you would have the right to do."
Seattle,3dpixv,ConsultMass,2,Sun Jul 19 06:10:29 2015 UTC,"Exactly. I don't think people understand how quickly these scenarios play out, or how dangerous knives are at close range. That officer is lucky to have even have had enough time to draw his sidearm. Here is a video that demonstrates how difficult it is for an officer to react in time to a knife-wielding attacker."
Seattle,3dpixv,ShakingSquirrels,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:41:45 2015 UTC,"So, I think a key thing to realize here is that the cop moved faster than the guy initially, and then obviously he was safe by virtue of having a gun pointed at a guy with a knife. However, he can't maintain that safety and move fast, only walking speed, so he's no longer faster than the guy. And the other choice of lowering his weapon and moving away from the guy faster, well there is no guarantee that the guy doesn't just start sprinting and overtake him. If he just attacked the cop with his fists, or something not so deadly, I would agree with you. Also, it's really not reliable enough to shoot for the legs etc. so they are trained not to."
Seattle,3dpixv,oheoh,0,Sun Jul 19 16:41:36 2015 UTC,My thoughts too. Reading what people are saying about Sam breaks my heart that he had to lose his life.   Doesn't police have some kind of technology that makes the person instantaneously unconscious or paralyzed without killing them?
Seattle,3dpixv,erratic3,4,Sun Jul 19 20:09:18 2015 UTC,"No, they don't. Tasers are not reliable or effective enough to use in this type of situation. If the police had the kind of technology that you described, of course they would use it, but they don't."
Seattle,3dpixv,SodaAnt,2,Sun Jul 19 16:45:48 2015 UTC,"I thought tasers were a lot better now? Fair enough.  And sheeeeesh guys, what's with the spamming of downvotes on something like that. I'm trying to be respectful here and understand stuff like this better... ya know.. have a civil discussion and all that.   Anyway... Thanks Soda for the response, I thought tasers have been getting better though? But I supposed if they have a greater chance of failure than regular firearm it makes sense to not rely on them."
Seattle,3dpixv,variousdinosaurs,3,Sun Jul 19 07:30:29 2015 UTC,"They are better, and each generation improves reliability and effectiveness, but they still aren't quite there yet. Guns have a very important advantage that if they don't stop a subject with one shot, you can simply continue to fire. Hopefully within a few years something gets good enough that it can be used in the place of guns, but I'm not too optimistic."
Seattle,3dpixv,SodaAnt,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:22:53 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the info.   Perhaps if I were in officers place, I would have shot too in this situation but I think it's failure to develop a technology that is effective to take the person down without killing them, has costed a man's life here."
Seattle,3dpixv,erratic3,3,Sun Jul 19 16:45:08 2015 UTC,"No, they're not better. They are not always capable of penetrating clothing and, even if they do, they don't always stop people. And even if they were better, you wouldn't rely on a non-deadly weapon to respond to a deadly force. Knives are extremely dangerous at close range, and can do a ton of damage in a very short amount of time. A knife is a deadly weapon. Period. People can't expect officers to treat them as some sort of toy that isn't really that dangerous.   Also, when you draw a firearm in self-defense, you shoot for center mass and shoot until the threat is neutralized. It's not like a video game where you can just run away and shoot their limbs. You shoot to stop the threat.   Sure, it sucks that dude had to die. But that's what happens when you attack someone with a deadly weapon. That's a choice he made, and those are the consequences of his actions. It's not like he "" twitched and made some random action "" at an officer. He made a deliberate effort to arm himself with a blade and threaten someone else's life.  Play stupid games, win stupid prizes."

I know the police aren't supposed to do anything about people smoking pot in public places, but that law (and others like it) are there for a reason.   We know smoking is terrible for people's health, and I do feel like it is really rude to smoke in a public place and put your toxins in the air other people are breathing.   I don't berate people for smoking in public places, but if they are doing so at a bus stop or something where I need to be, I will politely ask them to smoke somewhere else because I have asthma. I've never had anyone I've asked that of respond negatively. When I'm walking on a sidewalk and someone is smoking there I try to move past it quickly.   TL/DR: As someone with  asthma, I hate it, but I try to get around the people quickly or politely ask them to move somewhere else because it triggers my asthma."

Seattle,3dnahf,FuckedByCrap,2,Sat Jul 18 17:50:31 2015 UTC,"My own opinion is it's two things:  1) Cops see the public less as peers and more as military enemies.  Thus, they are less likely to just walk up and engage in banter with a sleeping fellow and ""move him along"" .. it'd escalate into a beatdown or arrest, which they aren't really looking to start with a simple homeless guy.  2) The rest of Seattle, knowing how violent and incompetent our police are, want them to stand down around ""harmless homeless guys.""  That has been a West Coast thing for decades, but it takes on more meaning when you realize the police are violent and incompetent a lot of the time.  Modern police tend not to be someone you can trust just to ""move someone along.""  They go from zero to weapons discharge in seconds now.  That probably did not used to be the case, years ago.  It's not the case in many countries now, police aren't even armed in England.  Yet we have paramilitary policing, and this is one of the results.  Given a relatively harmless homeless guy versus a prone-to-outburst-deadly-force-cop .. I'll take leaving the homeless guy alone.  Even though I hate it, that's still better than letting the paramilitary cops have their way.  So unless or until we get better civil policing, people who are capable of engaging the public without immediately escalating things into a shooting situation, we'll probably be better off letting homeless people lie.  Because the alternative is some fuckwit cop shooting him in 4 seconds because he's old and deaf and had a pocketknife.  Or some other idiot cop with a history of over-escalation engaging with hostility a 61 year old war veteran who uses a golf club as a walking aid, and is minding his own business."

Venture over to Tacoma to see the 10 Things I Hate about you house and Stadium high school. Gas Works is where the paintball scene was filmed and Kerry Park is featured in the beginning of the movie.   A bit further east down I90, just over the cascades, you'll find Roslyn where many of the exterior scenes for Northern Exposure were filmed, that is also a very good day trip to take."

Seattle,3dql1o,Cbanders,2,Sat Jul 18 17:15:10 2015 UTC,"Same here.  Snoqualmie Falls is gorgeous, with or without Laura Palmer's body washed up at the bottom.  I'm a sucker for trains, so I enjoy the Northwest Railway Museum and a ride on their old steam train.  I usually try to make a half-day drive of a visit out there, and take Hwy 203 up through the Snoqualmie Valley.  It's mostly just lush, green countryside, farms, and a few cute little towns.  There's some pretty good food along the way--Maltby Cafe, Fall City Roadhouse, Woodman Lodge.  You can come back through Woodinville and do a little wine tasting."
Seattle,3dql1o,casagordita,2,Sat Jul 18 22:23:44 2015 UTC,"A 1961 movie called Ring of Fire was filmed out on the peninsula.   For the final scene the protagonists are trying to escape by train, and it gets stuck on a bridge which burns up and collapses.   They actually filmed this for real. Used an old steam locomotive and an unused old wooden trestle bridge over the Wynoochee river. They actually lit an old huge trestle bridge on fire with the train sitting on it, then added some explosives to help it all collapse. Apparently you can still find small hunks of old railway car and steam engine at the bottom of the gorge.   Bridge and train action at 10:30 here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGnzVdnFkmI"
Seattle,3dql1o,jimmythefly,3,Sun Jul 19 00:26:38 2015 UTC,"If you were a fan of the 1990's TV show Northern Exposure, you'd probably enjoy Roslyn.  It's where they filmed most of the episodes, standing in for Cecily, Alaska.  The die-hard fans still do an annual Moosefest festival there.  You can visit the Brick Saloon, which was prominently featured in the show, but pre-dates it considerably--it's Washington's oldest continuously-operating bar.  Roslyn has some other interesting history as well--it was one of the few towns in Washington with a significant African-American community in the late 1800's.  It's worth a stop if you're out that way.  It's about a 90 minute drive out I-90, over Snoqualmie Pass."

It is too much of a PITA to get to Tukwila and there are no current plans to improve the public transit in any meaningful way.   My travel time would be almost as long as the game.

Seattle,3dp65y,Audicity,3,Sat Jul 18 15:40:09 2015 UTC,"Especially since the Sounders and Seahawks share the stadium, they can't play at the same time anyways already during those 3 months (4 if we're including preseason) where they overlap.

If the arena were in SoDo, half the attendees would be working in town during the day already, they won't be causing traffic. The rest would be coming in as others are leaving, i.e., opposite directions.   And I know this is not a huge issue because: Not a lot of overlap between baseball and winter sports It already happens all the time for Mariners (I work in SoDo, don't see the commute majorly affected by home games, only the rare weekday afternoon ones if they run late) and...basketball/hockey would never conflict IF THEY USED THE SAME ARENA  Tukwila?

Seattle,3dp65y,forrestthewoods,0,Sat Jul 18 23:33:21 2015 UTC,For weeknight games people who aren't going to the game will leave work early to avoid the extra traffic. End result is worse traffic from mid afternoon til evening. Not worth it.

High Line is a completely false, even naive comparison.  Plus the city is building an elevated park from the Market down to the waterfront that actually will have businesses around it.  Like the everlasting Monorail projects, this viaduct proposal is another attempt by busybodies to garner funds for a pipe dream.  We should tear down the viaduct and work on better ways to connect Spring st. and Union st. foot traffic to the waterfront at ground level.  Harbor steps should be the model of how to connect 1st Ave and the waterfront, not an elevated park that goes nowhere."

That's fine, but I can still say you have the same values as a developer.  You might not be a developer, but from my view outside the pro-developer viewpoints, does it really matter?  You might have entirely legit other reasons for wanting the viaduct down completely, but you haven't said any of those, so I'll keep assuming you want a 1%'er downtown.. like the developers want.  So far the namecall score is you 1 for ""grow up"" and me .. well I called you a developer shill by proxy, that's kind of a name call.  Feel free to dispute it.  What other reasons do you want the viaduct completely gone, that don't have anything to do with promoting 1%'er property values?  We could argue also whether tearing down the whole viaduct results in 1%'er waterfront.  I'm pretty convinced it will, which is probably why the downtown developer crowd wants it done so much."
Seattle,3do7nj,my_lucid_nightmare,2,Sat Jul 18 17:02:54 2015 UTC,"So you're saying you want an expensive, 1%'er only downtown yet you aren't a developer? That's fine, but I can still say you have the same values as a developer.   This is a strawman argument.  I never said anything of the sort.  I said, only, that I support the viaduct's removal and that I think the new waterfront will be an improvement over the existing one.    That doesn't make me a 1%er or a developer.

Seattle,3do7nj,Dilong-paradoxus,3,Fri Jul 17 23:39:40 2015 UTC,"It's probably a lot more affordable to make the necessary changes required to support some greenery and pedestrians than it is to support multi-ton trucks. Tearing is down wouldn't be free either, so we may be looking at a relatively small increase for a park retrofit. And while it may be ugly now, covering it in plants that would consume most of the visible concrete would make for a pretty unique and impressive repurposing."
Seattle,3do7nj,sealistaccount,6,Sat Jul 18 04:28:25 2015 UTC,"Not quite. Most of the structure of the Viaduct is there to hold itself up--the ""dead load"". The weight of car traffic or the ""live load"" is much less than just the weight of the concrete and rebar standing there. To support that you have to do what they've done in the settled portion, reinforce the support columns with structures extending all the way down to the bedrock under the loose soils.  However, the southern (and partly demolished now) part of the Viaduct is more vulnerable than the remainder. So it's feasible. Not sure if practible, though."
Seattle,3do7nj,LordoftheSynth,9,Sat Jul 18 04:59:12 2015 UTC,The reason it needs to be replaced is because it is fundamentally structurally unsound.

Seattle,3dn2il,GiveHerTheDeak,104,Fri Jul 17 16:37:57 2015 UTC,"Seattle is, like many dense liberal cities, becoming much more of a superstar city, as Edward Glaeser defines it in The Triumph of the City. That means that it has a densely urbanized core, strong education facilities, and intense research / development / intellectual industries. Innovation, in the sense Peter Thiel describes in Zero to One, plus the ability to sell to global markets leads to extremely high earning potential for some people.   For reasons still somewhat opaque to me and rooted in psychology, politics, and law, (but that are somewhat discussed by Glaeser and by Tyler Cowen in Average is Over), liberal and superficially progressive cities like Seattle also tend to generate intense land-use controls and opposition to development. This tends to strangle housing supply. The combination of high incomes generated by innovation and selling to global markets, along with limited housing supply, tends to price non-superstars out of the market. Various subsidy schemes generate much more noise than practical assistance for people, and markets are at best exceedingly hard to alter through government fiat. Sun Belt cities are growing so fast and so consistently because of real affordable housing. People move to them because housing is cheap. Issues with superstar cities and housing affordability are well-known in the research community but those issues haven't translated much into voters voting for greater housing supply.   Ignore the many bogeymen being discussed in this thread and focus on market fundamentals. Seattle is increasingly great for economic superstars. Most of them probably aren't wasting time posting to or reading Reddit. If you are not a superstar Seattle, like L.A., Boston, New York, and many other cities is going to be very difficult to build a future in. Many voters don't understand basic economics (as this sub-reddit demonstrates routinely), and existing property owners prefer to exclude rivalrous uses.   See also this discussion and my discussion of Jane Jacobs and urban land politics. Ignore any comments that lack citations to actual research.   EDIT: Note too that, as Matt Yglesias points out in The Rent Is Too Damn High: What To Do About It, And Why It Matters More Than You Think, nominally free-market conservatives also tend to oppose development and support extensive land-use controls. But urban cities like Seattle almost always tilt leftward relative to suburbs and rural areas. Why this happens isn't well understood.   Still, it's telling that Seattlites generate a lot of rhetoric around affordable housing and being progressive while simultaneously attacking policies that would actually provide affordable housing and be actually progressive. Some of you may have heard the hot air around Piketty. But it turns out that, if you properly account for housing and land-use controls, a surprisingly large a mount of the supposed disparity between top earners and everyone else goes away."

Seattle,3dn2il,SLCamper,2,Fri Jul 17 19:14:33 2015 UTC,"Damn, you sound like you know what you're talking about. Really appreciate the detailed response. I actually have family planning to move to NC because it's their best bet of actually owning property in their lifetime. I can't blame them for not wanting to rent forever. In your opinion though, are there any cities in the U.S. (or the world for that matter) that we should look up to for being truly progressive in their approach to affordable housing?"
Seattle,3dn2il,InnerChutzpah,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:23:21 2015 UTC,"To follow up to this, have you you GP found a case that goes though the elasticity of housing demand relative to a decreased price? Meaning, if the city of Seattle said ""we will provide affordable housing in neighborhoods X, Y, and Z by keeping building apartments and fixing the price at, hypothetically, $1500/mo for a 2 bedroom 1.5 bath,""  would it even be possible to meet the demand for this? My intuition says that it would requires many many thousands of units before reaching a point where there are no more waiting lists for these $1500 apartments.   Assuming there are waiting lists and supply for these affordable units cannot meet demand, and the price cannot be increased to decrease demand, then what should the mechanism of deciding who gets these $1500 apartments? Lottery? Applications?"

Seattle,3dn2il,Callox,39,Sat Jul 18 05:58:05 2015 UTC,"I moved here from the Rust Belt on the East Coast, and I thought people were depressing and pessimistic about their future prospects there, in cities that were actually, factually on their dead ends in development. I come here, in the fastest growing city in America and people here, who on average, make more money, have a higher standard of living, and have more going for them where they live, and people here are even more pessimistic about their future.   I'm not downplaying the many roadblocks that millennials have, and I'm not downplaying the challenges this city has to young people, but compared to many, many other places where people our age doing quite squarely jack shit? In my admittedly subjective view, I think this place has more opportunities than most."
Seattle,3dn2il,XxHULKANANIACxX93175,13,Fri Jul 17 17:35:32 2015 UTC,I grew up in the Allegheny Valley. Seattle is a literal heaven on Earth as far the economy is going. Havent had any problem getting a job here. Now that I'm in school I feel even more confident than ever. My poor parents dont understand why I can never go back. Maybe if Im lucky someone will gentrify those areas (oh no so scary) then Ill have a reason to return.
Seattle,3dn2il,Callox,19,Fri Jul 17 20:10:03 2015 UTC,"I think this place has more opportunities than most   I do too. But the truth is that no matter where you are, if you're born poor, you're likely to stay poor. Having that reality looming over you at all times can be stressful."
Seattle,3dn2il,alexfrancisburchard,16,Fri Jul 17 17:50:16 2015 UTC,"I know. I was born poor too, hence my understanding of what I mentioned above isn't just sentiment; I lived it.  I am not saying that 'if ya just pull yourself up by your bootstraps...!' because I know there's more to that in the success equation. What I am saying is though, in terms of inherent opportunities in location, I'd far rather have been born poor in Seattle than being born poor in say, Baltimore.   Being poor sucks, I know, but Seattle has a lot going for it, and one thing that people overlook is that the city at least seems proactive about changing the city and addressing issues. Many places back on the East Coast, a lot of politicians and councilmen don't even put on a show about giving a shit."
Seattle,3dn2il,kweer,4,Fri Jul 17 17:54:47 2015 UTC,"This. In Chicago they just ignore problems and hope they go away, at least they pretend to work on changing things here."
Seattle,3dn2il,bonnieprincebilly,8,Fri Jul 17 18:48:07 2015 UTC,"Not necessarily.  I was raised in a trailer park in the bible belt and I'm about to buy a house in Seattle.  When I moved here after college I spent several months working at Starbucks while I was applying to jobs. It just takes some time, work, and luck.  You might have to just suck it up and live within your means for a while until an opportunity presents itself.  Despite what you might think, this is a fantastic time to grow up in America and you are going to have a hard time finding a more supportive city than Seattle."
Seattle,3dn2il,death_to_all_humans,20,Sat Jul 18 00:03:53 2015 UTC,"Fuck that attitude. I was born poor, moved here a decade ago, worked my ass off, and I bought my dream house last fall. You can do it. Suck it up, make it happen. You've got one shot at life - own it."
Seattle,3dn2il,bonnieprincebilly,0,Fri Jul 17 19:17:51 2015 UTC,"So you're incredibly lucky.  There's a million other people who worked just as hard as you with nothing to show for it.  The ""pull yourself up by your own bootstraps"" attitude is total bullshit.  The poorer you are, the more good luck you need to make it.  You shouldn't expect everyone to be as fortunate as you, because they won't be."
Seattle,3dn2il,brerrabbit,7,Sat Jul 18 23:33:59 2015 UTC,"Oh, I'm definitely lucky. But to what degree does that account for my success v. the hard work I put in? It's hard to say, but only a percentage, and I would wager a small one. Life isn't fair - I'm not arguing that. All I'm saying is that the only person responsible for improving your lot in life is you. You can whine and blame or you can get to achieving what you can. I wish you all the luck in the world - I know that life would have been a lot harder on me if I shared your attitude."
Seattle,3dn2il,brerrabbit,3,Sat Jul 18 23:45:39 2015 UTC,"if you're born poor, you're likely to stay poor.   And one of the biggest reason's why is because you have that voice in your head telling you that."
Seattle,3dn2il,death_to_all_humans,2,Sat Jul 18 16:46:06 2015 UTC,"Absolute bullshit. Yeah, I'll just think my way out of poverty. Thanks for the tip!"
Seattle,3dn2il,p_nathan,3,Sat Jul 18 17:09:47 2015 UTC,"Well, I'm not going to argue with you, but yeah, that's pretty much exactly what you do. I mean, I cant think of a more concise way of describing what education is!    Success certainly is not just about hard work. It's about knowing what a lever is, and where to place it to magnify your work to the greatest effect.   People fuck up when they think education is just about the degree and smooth sailing after that.   Life's just not like that for most of us.   And yeah, the mental game is huge.  If you say ""I can,"" you may be right.   But if you say ""I can't"" then you're certainly right.  That was a core value around my household growing up.   Anytime I said ""I can't,"" I'd get a smack and hear ""Can't never could!""   There's a chapter in ""Outliers, the story of Success"" by Malcolm Gladwell, where he discusses the advantageous attitudes middle class children pick up from their parents that are largely absent from poorer families.   I think acceptance of ""your place"" (your perceived place)  is one of them.    It's a great book.  Even though I don't agree with all of it, and I begrudgingly accept some of it I think its a worthwhile read nonetheless.   I would say the biggest takeway from it for me is that yeah, successful people have had certain advantages, and not everybody has the same advantages, but it is possible manufacture your own advantages in the same way you can manufacture your own luck.   Edit:  Btw, I have that same voice.  I have the advantage of having a wife who is an incurable optimist.   I have undeniably gone further in life because of her being there to constantly remind me to question my attitude about things.  One thing she has taught me is that if you can look at something (people, events, interactions what have you) positively, and there is no disadvantage to doing so...then do it! You benefit."
Seattle,3dn2il,lumpytrout,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:18:00 2015 UTC,"OK, thanks for explaining. I can see where you're coming from, but that doesn't deny the fact that the likelihood of upward social mobility is on the decline no matter what I tell myself. That being said, I like to think that I'm able to acknowledge my disadvantages without succumbing to apathy. I'm pursuing education right now in the hope that things will work out in the future. I'm doing research into internships and doing my best to attend as many networking events as possible. I just don't want people to get the idea that I'm pouting around and complaining while doing nothing to improve my situation."
Seattle,3dn2il,p_nathan,2,Sat Jul 18 20:06:40 2015 UTC,"God, I don't know whether the correct response to people like that is to laugh or facepalm.  Yeah, you can magically become rich just by changing your attitude.  That's why everyone who read The Secret is a millionaire now."
Seattle,3dn2il,lumpytrout,2,Sat Jul 18 23:35:37 2015 UTC,"The truth is also this: if you pursue lucrative opportunities, it will let you get more lucre.  If you wanted to be an artist of some flavour, you're probably going to learn about the ""Starving"" part of ""starving artist"". You need to play the cold hard ROI cash of university educations."
Seattle,3dn2il,p_nathan,2,Fri Jul 17 18:22:15 2015 UTC,Why do I always have to see some version of this on reddit?  Careers can be found in all kinds of economic nooks and crannies. There are many people in Seattle with thriving art careers and that even own houses!  This is a great town with huge support for the arts and it's why many of us arty folks moved here.
Seattle,3dn2il,lumpytrout,2,Sat Jul 18 14:21:11 2015 UTC,"I'm very glad to hear that! I haven't personally seen it myself, but YMMV as they say.  It's very important to understand the risks and rewards of the career you choose and pick one that satisfies your life desires."

Seattle,3dn2il,Callox,3,Sat Jul 18 01:52:06 2015 UTC,The career opportunities in Seattle across many spectrums are more than you can find in a lot of places in the US (or at least could 4 years ago when I started searching)  It's a grind and it's not always fun but it's amazing to be in a space where you have opportunities and are surrounded by people who want to try new things/are willing to give others a chance. It's not always easy but it's a great thing to have such a jumping off point if you can make it happen.
Seattle,3dn2il,lumpytrout,6,Sat Jul 18 04:32:36 2015 UTC,"It's far more expensive here, and that's the larger problem for a lot of people.

Seattle,3dn2il,ethidda,1 point,Sat Jul 18 23:45:39 2015 UTC,"on average   Average ain't shit.  The rich are doing well here, which drives the average up, but the poor still get fucked over.  It's like how Bill Gates moving into a neighborhood will make the average income soar, but that doesn't actually mean the other people there are doing any better.  And just because things could be worse somewhere else doesn't mean you need to accept the way things are.

Seattle,3dn2il,komnenos,9,Sat Jul 18 23:43:39 2015 UTC,"I grew up dirt poor, single father household. Down in Pierce county.   I was basically the poster child for financial aid / affirmative action. Thanks to state programs and the good graces of WA state tax payers I graduated from the UW with $14k in debt June 2007. But I'm now the kind of citizen the state wants, I read, I vote, I recycle, I like to be self-reliant, I donate to charity.   The recession sucked. When I graduated there were tons of entry level administrative jobs in the private and public/non-profit sector. Not so much after that.   I've been living with housemates since I moved to Seattle for college, 11 years now. And, it is OKAY. I've never lived with fewer than three other room mates. You now need a different kind of resource, not cash (though still helpful) but social networks. Old school or the way contemporary immigrants have been rolling in every generation. I can spend $11 at Safeway and my boyfriend and I can have a bomb ass dinner, we'll spend 45 minutes cooking it, but that is time we spend together.   Land a union job, or get a vocational cert/degree. My bf is going back to school at age 32.   Do I expect to be a high roller w/o re-investing in my edu? No. Is my standard of living way higher than my reduced lunch qualifying childhood: yes."

He got a summer job after grad school working at one of the paper mills and was able to afford a HOUSE in Lakewood after only a few months, then he networked and got into a great business in Seattle and bought a house on Beacon Hill.  From what he's told me everything seemed so incredibly cheap back then, if my dad was to do it over again in this day and time I doubt he could buy that house or hell even live on his own with that one summer job or buy the house on Beacon on a new hire's wage (the house costs about $650,000 or so now).

To be slightly snarky: I think that's called ""being an adult without rich parents"". I don't know anyone who supports themselves who would say otherwise about their situation.  Less snarkily - I encourage you to take a very nasty look at your job market post-graduation. Don't assume flowers and roses. Go out to network with people making a living in that market and ask them pushy and uncomfortable questions about job turnover rate, what they look for.  You should be aware that in many fields, this is impossible to do realistically without being in a city like Seattle. You're blessed to be in the middle of a boom-town.  If you don't like the answers that the locals are giving about your major's job market, consider switching majors. Definitely get an internship - PAID. If your field has no paid internship, this is your value on the cash market without a degree (and probably with a fresh degree too)... not worth giving money to. Think about these things very hard before graduating. It gets harder afterwards.   I share your frustration about ""Like every other millenial in America, I was told that if I work hard and go to college then I'll be able to make a decent living"". It's just not true.  I encourage a very harsh look at your ROI on college degrees and career prospects: only people quite lucky and/or wealthy get to go to university to do pure intellectual stimulation without paying very hard for it later in life. Feel free to PM me if you want more of my perspective... I am happy to talk to anyone about things, 'specially career optimizations."

I don't think the figures really support that statement. A degree, regardless of the type, does eventually pay for itself. It's extremely painful when it takes 30 years to break even, but I think a lot of that is more a question of unrealistic expectations (""do what you love..."") than non-stem degrees lacking utility."

I've got a Master's in an applied science and have been working/going to school for nearly 10 years before I could afford property in Seattle.  Find a trade in demand, go to a 2yr trade school and you can make bank.  You can also consider moving somewhere more affordable. No shame in that. I lived in California for long enough to know that I didn't want to make a permanent residence there(bad example-not affordable). Ohio is actually great; lived there for a few years and there were huge homes in great neighborhoods for $50-$100k.

They never last, and when they're over the industry will be overcrowded; everyone who pursued it because it was booming will suddenly be competing for the regular number of jobs.  Unless that's actually a career you want to pursue, stay away.  Second, unfortunate as it is, many jobs require a college degree, and even if they don't they will still consider one a big separator.  If the only way you can go to college is to rack up crazy amounts of debt that's a different situation, but if you can make it through with minimal debt it's a lot better to have that degree."

A trade is something that will last from boom to boom, but not to say an educated field isn't as well.   Some will hire based off experience, some hire based off education."
Seattle,3dn2il,seattleslow,11,Sun Jul 19 20:26:22 2015 UTC,"You should move out.  Seriously.  Ten years ago, I was in the same shoes as you.  I lived in an up-and-coming city with explosive growth and saw cost of living skyrocket.  There were new opportunities all around me, but I could never take advantage of them.  I also grew up modestly with no connections.  When i was young, I didn't know how to get myself a six-figure job that seemed like the bare minimum requirements to rent a studio apartment.  I moved.  The midwest has a bunch of cities with cheap rent and good opportunities.   Not the same amount of opportunities in Seattle, but you can't take advantage of the opportunities here anyway.  Out there, you'll more likely get your foot into the door without connections.  And once you start networking and gaining experience, you can look into coming back to Seattle or another city like it.  Places I would consider are Cleveland, Kansas City, Las Vegas, and Minneapolis.  I lived in both Cleveland and Las Vegas, and they're great for a young person to become ""self-made.""  Best of luck."

Seattle,3dn2il,rationalomega,18,Fri Jul 17 20:12:36 2015 UTC,"This thread is jammin' so I don't expect this to not get buried, but it's hit a couple chords with me, too.  My wife and I were both lucky enough to have parents who supported our dreams to the point they would encourage educations in, well, pretty much whatever we wanted. Here we are on the other side with conceptual art degrees (at least mine was media, her's was visual...oy) that would be nearly useless without her comm minor and internship her last year of school. She's debt free, but I fucked around with school and ended up squandering some good scholarships and with about 15k in debt. I know that's not as bad as a lot of folks, but I think it have the same exact debt today as I did when I graduated in 07 with very little in the way of job prospects thanks to the abstract nature of my program.  We started our own business and it was pretty successful. I also bartended 2-10 shifts a week over the past 4 years to supplement the slow seasons. Now she has a job she hates in a field that at least resembles something she's interested in, and I bailed from the bar and am in the middle of a bunch of interviews.  So what? Well, I love Seattle. I moved here  from Phoenix because Phoenix sucks and this place is great. I love living in Seattle proper (even if barely) but I don't feel (and here's the key, ya'll) ENTITLED enough to believe someone owes it to me to live here. As we watch rents and mortgages around us go up up up we realize we're on borrowed time, and the burbs (if we stay in W. Wa) aren't too far off in the future. Does that suck? Sure. But boo-fucking-hoo. No one owes us anything to the point that we DESERVE to live here. If we made more money we absolutely would. But we don't. So we adjust and move on. This whole ""seattle is our town fuck everyone"" mentality that some on this sub (and more IRL) seem to have is shitty. Could you imagine that mentality in other big(ger) cities? Move to Manhattan and tell someone they owe it to you to let you live there working a $15/hr job. I'm sure that'll fly. Wanna live somewhere on that salary? Phoenix is pretty cheap.  tl;dr: Love seattle and wanna live here forever, but don't have the education/resources/lack of debt to do it in the near future. Will make adjustments. This is life."

Seattle,3dn2il,getonmyhype,11,Fri Jul 17 16:52:16 2015 UTC,Do you like 8+ years of post secondary education and 35k a year? Great! Science is for you!   Engineering and CS are really the only two STEM programs that result in high wages
Seattle,3dn2il,zeppelin0110,3,Fri Jul 17 19:25:23 2015 UTC,"Not true, Math opens up almost limitless potential for STEM jobs and careers. It boils down to one of two things, if you're good at math, people know you're either a) really really smart in abstract concepts and thought/memory or b) really really disciplined to put in the time to study stuff that you're committed to learning. That means you can easily learn something in the field like a programming language, a data modeling program, an algorithm simulator, a test tool, etc. Doesn't immediately qualify you for these things, but it almost guarantees the potential that you could do it. I regularly see higher level, senior level programmer positions, systems engineer positions or data scientist positions list a phd in CS or math as a preferred prereq. The industry is aware and HR folks know of the two points i raised above. You don't see starving, homeless mathematicians on the street (unless they're lazy or crazy [or both!])."
Seattle,3dn2il,ebox86,2,Sat Jul 18 01:17:01 2015 UTC,"You said it in your own post, they're looking for phds. The only STEM degrees that reliably result in high paying jobs right out of undergraduate are engineering and CS"
Seattle,3dn2il,theKearney,4,Sat Jul 18 03:23:25 2015 UTC,Math?   I was a math major doing just fine.
Seattle,3dn2il,rationalomega,7,Fri Jul 17 20:19:23 2015 UTC,"Math is a fine major. A lot of programmers actually are math majors. I feel like most companies love hiring math majors, because they really live up to their stereotype - smart people."
Seattle,3dn2il,not_gryz,5,Sat Jul 18 01:14:36 2015 UTC,"You are totally correct, see my above comment. If you're good at math, you're good (or can be) by mere associate, at a whole bunch of other abstract disciplines and careers. Take Finance for example, the high speed, computerized platform of instant-trading stocks, funds and bonds that our economy relies on today was made possible by statisticians and mathematicians (and also finance folks and programmers). Or hedge funds, they usually have several mathematician/statisticians on staff high up the chain."

They pay 40% less than the company you physically work at and that place doesn't have to worry about payroll, hr, etc.  The business is also cyclical where it goes well for a few years then lay offs galore.    It's hard to plan things when you don't have a good sense of job security.  That's why after Amgen shut down, my wife is going into software development"

Do what interests you, what is going to get you to study and do shit.  A lot of jobs just want you to have a bachelor's degree, the specific field doesn't matter.  If you want to pursue a career in tech get a degree in that, but if that's not your thing it's not going to be any better than a degree in biology or linguistics or art.  In fact, if you're not into tech it's probably best not to pursue that because you'll be competing with people who actually do like it and when the bubble bursts you'll likely get squeezed out."
Seattle,3dn2il,AwfulWaffleWalkr,4,Sat Jul 18 23:50:47 2015 UTC,I know it's shitty to say but major in something that is tech related. Art major? Double in compsci/engineering/math. Biology major?

Seattle,3dn2il,wolfnb,7,Fri Jul 17 17:40:26 2015 UTC,"I've lived in Seattle my whole life. I'm a city kid, I love urban areas and the Seattle area offers the perfect blend of natural beauty and urban excitement.  I'm 20 and split my time between LA for university and Seattle for summers. I have mixed feelings about the growth and gentrification of this city. On one hand, currently living in west LA gives me perspective: Seattle has a long way to go before it starts being as absurdly expensive and wealthy as LA and SF. Seattle is still largely low density, and our surrounding areas are vastly more affordable and accessible compared to the city suburbs of California. I love the young, techy vibe of SLU and Belltown, and I think the growth and prosperity is positive for the city culture as a whole.  At the same time, rent prices are definitely not going down. People who aren't competitive in the job market or already settled in the city will be priced out. This really sucks. Unfortunately, this is a reality of living in a desirable urban area on the West Coast. I chose a computer science degree in part because I know it will give me the freedom to live independently in Seattle within my means. I hope you find a career path that will take you where you want to go. If you have any interest in programming, I strongly recommend following that interest. It is not hard to learn programming on your own, or with some classes at junior college. The job market is booming here, and small-medium size companies will hire you if you have a couple coding projects to talk about, degree or not."
Seattle,3dn2il,deadmandrawing,7,Fri Jul 17 21:13:51 2015 UTC,"As someone who is now 43 and makes good money, I lived for 10 years as an adult in this city on just over minimum wage, I couch surfed and rented rooms in houses, it sucks to be poor, but when you're young you're poor.  Eventually I got into software when the dotcom boom happened in the late 90's, my first decent job was doing windows 95 tech support for 10 bucks an hour, which was barely enough to rent a room.  Things haven't changed all that much except there is a much better job market now."
Seattle,3dn2il,wolfnb,6,Fri Jul 17 21:44:40 2015 UTC,"This is more of a response to the personal finance part of your question rather than the Seattle specific issues:  Your socioeconomic status will be what you make it, it will just be harder for you than for some others. You are right in that the family/life you are born into will significantly help or hinder trying to climb that ladder, but that doesn't mean it can't be done. And the fact that you are thinking about it and willing to ask for help is a good indicator that you've got what it takes to change your economic future. Here's my two challenges for you:   Learn all about personal finance. A great place to get started is /r/personalfinance and read up. This is a big topic and it can take a while to soak things in, but here's some basics (much of which you probably know). Get out of debt. Always spend less than you make--live cheaply (get roommates) and spend little (don't eat out much). Invest wisely (both your money and your time)--example: 4 year university degree that costs 40k per year and will allow you to get a job that will pay 50k per year. Good investment? HELL NO! If it is for your dream job that you really want to do then go for it, just be okay with living on ramen forever. How about a 3 month welding class that costs 15k that will get you a job paying 65k+ per year? That's a much better investment on both time and money even though it might not sound as ""sexy"" as some fancy degrees. Careful when comparing to others. Do compare to the neighbor that is a single mom working 3 jobs and barely scraping by, and not just to feel good about yourself, but to help out! Go buy them some groceries! Helping out others is rich, having a mansion full of unused rooms is poor. Don't compare to people making more than you. Years from now, when you are making bank, there will still be people making more than you and they can still make you feel like you haven't made it. Comparing like that only leads to jealousy and frustration (eg most people talking about tech workers in this sub), and on a practical level that negative comparison can often lower your optimism which statistically would lead to lower income.   Hang in there and keep learning and growing. It will probably be very difficult, but you can make it. Even in Seattle."
Seattle,3dn2il,Tb0ne,6,Fri Jul 17 21:43:26 2015 UTC,"So serious question here, but what about Seattle makes you want to stay? If our neighborhoods are changing (according to this sub, almost always in negative ways), the cool people that used to be here are all being pushed out or already are pushed out, and everything is so expensive, what makes you want to remain? Doesn't the people and the atmosphere make the place?"
Seattle,3dn2il,not_gryz,7,Fri Jul 17 16:57:00 2015 UTC,"I actually left because it had changed.  I would highly recommend others do the same, to anywhere more affordable. You may be pleasantly surprised how much more you'll like it somewhere outside the PNW.  If people have any prayer of changing Seattle economically without an economic crash, it's going to come from people who can't afford it, or aren't happy with what it's become, moving away."
Seattle,3dn2il,peachios,9,Fri Jul 17 20:24:41 2015 UTC,"It's pretty, it's in close proximity to secluded (for now) nature, a large number of the people hold progressive attitudes, I'm more likely to find a high paying job here, and I won't get arrested for smoking pot. I know this describes a lot of other places too, but I kinda want to stick around to see how everything works out. I also feel that I haven't lived nearly enough years to start complaining about neighborhood changes, so for me it's actually kind of exciting, at least superficially."
Seattle,3dn2il,Tb0ne,9,Fri Jul 17 17:26:39 2015 UTC,"I totally agree. That plus family/friends was a big reason why I came back from the East Coast.   I'll continue to play Devil's Advocate here. You mention pretty, close to nature, progressive, jobs, and pot, however, couldn't you say the same things about Renton/Tukwilla or Shoreline/Lynnwood? Those places are more affordable, you still are close enough to capitalize on the strong job market, and you can still participate in the neighborhood changes. Not as exciting as Seattle for sure, but I'd think it's as close to having your cake and eating it too as a lot of people can get these days.   Also, you mention socioeconomic status as the reason why you feel like you cannot stay in Seattle for much longer, yet you also put likelihood of finding a high paying job as a reason for staying. Sounds like you are simultaneously hopeful and terrified?"
Seattle,3dn2il,Will_Im_Not,4,Fri Jul 17 18:25:50 2015 UTC,"Those places to me are just sprawl. Seattle still has its share of Fred Meyers and stuff but everything out in those areas just seem like strip malls with the same businesses copy and pasted. Seattle still has some great character and local shops. Sure I can go to Starbucks or Big5, but I'd rather go to Ballard Coffee Works or Second Ascent."
Seattle,3dn2il,mukmuk_,5,Fri Jul 17 19:46:28 2015 UTC,"I kinda disagree in a way.  the ""sprawl"" areas have cheaper rents and more wacky local stores.  the high prices of seattle are driving most of the quirky shops out."

Seattle,3dn2il,p_nathan,2,Fri Jul 17 20:11:41 2015 UTC,It was suggested to stay in Renton/Tukwila/Etc.  I just posited a reason why those would be far less attractive than living in Seattle.
Seattle,3dn2il,Poppycorn,8,Fri Jul 17 20:27:03 2015 UTC,"I mean, obviously I'd rather live in Seattle than Renton. But if you're really struggling to make ends meet then maybe you shouldn't live in one of the most expensive cities in america."

Seattle,3dn2il,zeppelin0110,2,Fri Jul 17 17:11:27 2015 UTC,"I grew up incredibly poor.  I'm talking literally dirt poor.  I LITERALLY grew up in a barn.  When I was a very young child (2-3 years old), my single mother was raising me and my two twin sisters in a double wide trailer in rural west Georgia, a few miles from the Alabama border.  In 1993, a tornado touched down on our property and destroyed our trailer to the point where 15 years later, I was still finding pieces of debris from it out in the woods half a mile from where it originally sat.  My mother loves horses, and we had a concrete cinder block barn for them that was relatively undamaged by the tornado.  She converted half of the barn into a pseudo-house, meaning she made the former horse stalls into bedrooms and a kitchen and bathroom.  Our bathtub was an old 80 gallon horse trough that she paid a neighbor $50 to weld claw feet to so it wouldn't wobble.  We had a washing machine, dryer, and a hot water heater in the bathroom but I didn't have an indoor toilet until I was 12.  We had an outhouse that was up on a hill about 500 feet from the barn-house.  We had to use that in all seasons, all weather, no matter what because that's all we had.  I remember faking sick to stay home from school on the day the plumber and contractor came in to set up the plumbing and the toilet, and I thought it was the height of luxury that I didn't have to go piss and shit in a 150 degree outhouse (remember, Georgia during the summer!).  The barn-house had concrete floors with no carpeting, cinder block walls, little insulation (so the house would become insanely hot and brutally cold), no heat except from a wood burning stove, no air conditioning whatsoever.  Our driveway was 3/4 of a mile worth of red clay and dirt and gravel.  We had an Internet connection but it was a 28.8k dial-up modem, and the only vehicle we had until I was 13 was a 1972 Ford Lariat pickup truck.  During the summers when I was off of school, I did hard labor on the farm, sometimes up to 14 hours a day - building fences, digging post holes, repairing roofs, building chicken coops, shoveling gravel, bush-hogging my grandmother's fielsd (using a huge tractor with a 6 foot wide mower at the end of it and I was 11 when I started doing this), and I would spend each night before bed learning everything I could about whatever struck my liking.  I hated growing up that way, and I never had friends come over to hang out.  I vowed that my children would never, ever grow up in those conditions.  When I got to college, I was studying history and quickly figured out that there were no jobs in that field, especially since I started school at the beginning of the economic collapse in 2008.  I watched as millions of people without the right skills lose their jobs and be unemployed perpetually, living in the same type of poverty that I grew up in.  That's when I decided to teach myself everything I could about technology.  I studied principles of quality assurance, I taught myself how to write a test plan, how to write test cases and what smoke, sanity, white, black, and grey testing were.  I busted my ass trying to land IT jobs at my school even though I was turned down in preference of the tech majors.  I opened up a computer repair business on the side, repairing peoples' hardware and troubleshooting software for $20 per job because all my customers were just as broke as I was.  When I got out of school, I didn't even bother applying for jobs in my field.  I went directly into tech, and I applied for ~900 jobs in Atlanta before I landed my first tech job in Alpharetta.  From there, I learned everything I could about development and even more about QA and leveraged that knowledge into a QA-specific job in another suburb.  I worked my ass off there until Amazon noticed my resume on LinkedIn and sent me a request for an interview.  Thanks to everything I taught myself, I made it through the interview loop and was given a job offer and now I'm here.  I've been out of school for two years and I've already doubled my salary from what I was making at my exploitative, awful first ""real job"".  That never would have been possible if I hadn't moved to Seattle and taken a job with Amazon.  Within the next four years, I'm looking at having tens of thousands of dollars worth of stock and rapidly shrinking student debt (monthly payments of $501.26 YAY).  By the way, I should mention that I'm 50% Cherokee, 50% Creek and have also been dealing with the economic consequences of my direct ancestors being forced off of their land and into reservations by the US government, which is what initially put my family into poverty in the first place.  No white privilege here.  If I can do all of that with my background, I don't want to hear a single goddamn word about anyone who says they can't do it too.  It's not a problem of circumstances, it's a problem of lack of will to improve your situation.  I'm not saying you need to get into tech, because there are many other lucrative careers in a wide variety of fields.  If you can't put the effort into improving yourself, then you're going to fail and no amount of help is going to stop it."

There isn't a day that goes by the past 2 years that I don't think about pretty much everything in your post. I've been here and seen rents go from $900 for a 3 bedroom to the current $3000+ and it scares the shit out of me. I'm very very lucky to have an awesome girlfriend that is going to make almost triple what I make in the next year or two and she already makes double what I make. I'm also very lucky to have an awesome landlord that isn't raising our rent despite what the market is doing. It's still ridiculous to pay $1280 for 640 square feet imo but I'm in Fremont and got it better off than 90% of the city. I dunno what I'm trying to say in this post but I feel your pain and I'm scared and don't want to move either. Hopefully things change soon.

I don't really have experience in much else. I could switch and shoot video full time but I'm super comfortable with my hours, paid time off, sick leave, and insurance to do so. Being full time with Film and Cinema means sacrificing my social and weekend life and I don't think that's a way to live for anyone.

Seattle,3dn2il,diditforthecomment,3,Sat Jul 18 00:21:33 2015 UTC,"This will sound harsh, but I feel like you need someone to tell you this:  you're in a comfort zone and expecting others to look out for you.  This scenario plays out often and rarely does it have a happy ending.  If you want to improve your salary situation (and, by proxy, your ability to remain in the city proper) you'll need to step out from your comfort zone.  There are plenty of better paying opportunities with the same work schedule and likely better benefits that are within an arms reach.  You don't have to go into film and cinema to improve your situation.  You have relevant experience to go further with a career in IT.  Look into certification.  It's a minimal investment (~$200 in books and $2-300 in tests) that will open the door to opportunities with a significant salary increase.  But doing nothing to improve your employment situation because it's comfortable and expecting the city to change to accommodate you is not a situation that is going to end well for you."

I am making under $60k right now and I do feel left out of the ""salary"" boom the city is experiencing.  One thing that is important to focus on is that many of these tech salaries are very stagnant and it is very hard to climb the leadership ladder.  The market is very porous and it is socially acceptable to move from one job to another in less then a 12 month span.  If you put your head down and work hard for an individual company you have a higher upside than many of these tech workers.  I also am thankful that the city put in the first light rail line in one of the more economically diverse neighborhoods in Seattle.  There are many houses in the $350-400k range in Beacon Hill, Columbia City and along MLK and Rainier.  Not getting the opportunity to live in a condo in downtown Seattle does not mean I am missing out."

Seattle,3dn2il,Tb0ne,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:16:22 2015 UTC,"You have to build new buildings, so that they can become old and affordable. No, these buildings won't solve the problem in the next year. But in 10 or 20 years, they'll be the affordable buildings. There's always going to be a lag, because new construction is able to command a premium.  Unfortunately, we can't go back in time to build more buildings so that they would be cheap now."
Seattle,3dn2il,2capp,2,Sat Jul 18 00:03:20 2015 UTC,"How will the new buildings become affordable? (Serious question)  I've seen solid trends that property rent price increases over time, not decreases. In addition I've observed that income growth in any single given field is slow in comparison to the rate of rent increase.   I fail to see how any of the new buildings in Seattle will ever become affordable for someone making a comparable wage to someone who can't afford them now. Is there something I'm not seeing here?"
Seattle,3dn2il,Tb0ne,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:25:22 2015 UTC,"If we are building enough units (comparable to the number of families moving to Seattle), then rents will decrease. The absolute dollar value will increase, year after year, but it is supposed to be cheaper compared to buying power (and therefore a smaller percentage of income) due to inflation. However, because we do not build enough new units, there are fewer units per family as time goes on, and each unit becomes more valuable.  A good example of this working is Chicago. They have about 1:1 ratio of permits issued for new units and the increase in number of families. Their rent stays comparably cheap. IIRC, in Seattle, that ratio is like 1:10. At this rate, we will only fall behind, and yes, that means rent will be more expensive.  But my original point stands: we need to build more units.  (The fact that most middle class salaries are stagnant is a separate issue. However, AFAIK, this is not limited to Seattle, but a problem across the US.)"

However, I still think knocking everything down and building roach motels won't make the city more livable. It'll just make it more cramped and claustrophobic.

Otherwise your entire city is just going to be tech workers and business people. Do you really want your construction guy commuting an hour and a half each way to his 10-12 hour shift taking caffeine pills building your high rise. I'd guess not. While no one 'deserves' to live in the city. I certainly believe it is both better and possible to have a city where people can afford to live on differing incomes.

Seattle,3dn2il,heinekev,8,Fri Jul 17 22:55:25 2015 UTC,"Overall I think the tech industry has been quite the boon for the area. I don't mind the transplants, they definitely add some needed flavor.  However it's still infuriating to see the insinuation that somehow a stranger on the internet didn't work hard enough, and clearly the solution to all their problem is move out of the city so their cash flow can improve.  To me that's a complete business answer that fails to take into consideration the human factor. ""Well you're too poor to live here, just leave your friends, family, significant other, and support network and find somewhere cheaper, duh, it's easy, maybe you should have worked harder and gone into tech like the rest of us.""  I can easily see both sides of the coin and why people are pissed at both sentiments. I just wish it were easier or there were better policies in place to ensure someone that's not in as lucrative of a field can live here. People can work hard at other things, not make as much money, and we (seattle) should be able to accommodate that too."
Seattle,3dn2il,2capp,4,Fri Jul 17 23:48:00 2015 UTC,"I agree.  Just because someone has a job that happens to pay more doesn't give them more right to live somewhere. I think our current situation is a result of a combination of traditional Seattle politics, poorly thought out growth policy, and a bunch of jerk developers cashing in on the former two things.  I believe a properly invested and planned regional transit system will solve the latter issue, if we can overcome the former. If you take away this false demand then anyone has the option to move out of higher rent zones. I make a decent, but not absurd, living working in tech. I'm not inclined to pay $1800 or more for a place I don't own than anyone else. I used to have a large beach front apartment in west Seattle for $700. That was only 6 years ago.  I pay twice that for a less nice place now.  If I had the option to live in a nicer, quieter neighborhood farther out where I could access Seattle in around 20 min I would do it in a heartbeat.  20 minutes on public transit doesn't get you very far today and that is completely ludicrous.  I don't believe it's a cold business answer so much as it's understanding your current reality.  If you can't make it work, then maybe it's not going to and wishing it were some other way isn't going to change it.  Right now, as in today, it's really hard to live within Seattle on minimum wage.  That is a sad fact.  So keep voting for people who are fighting to change that.  I don't know what else to do.  So I guess we're even for assuming the worst about each other.  Curse the nuance and non-immediate form of conversation that is a message board.  It feels like we're thinking the same thing just coming at it from different directions."

Once you graduate, you'll be at entry-level in your chosen field and unable to afford that same quality of life.    That's true regardless of city, though.  It's especially true in Seattle, with the economic boom it's enjoying (or not?), but that's not exclusively a Seattle problem.   I'm currently going to school and working for minimum wage, but the closer I come to graduation, the more I fear that I'll be spending my entire life working only to maintain the same living standard that I was born into.    Assuming you have chosen a lucrative major, that's true only while you remain at the entry level.  If you remain entry level, or have chosen a major that will not end up being financially lucrative, then you will struggle to maintain your existing standard of living and likely not meet it.    Don't be afraid to step away from Seattle for a bit, either.  Go where the opportunities are (that's why the Techies are invading), get established in your field.  Get some experience and build a salary history, then come back to Seattle.  You'll be amazed how many opportunities Seattle has for experienced career folks.    Once you mature in your career, your salary will also mature and opportunities to move back into the city will open up.  It won't just happen magically, you will need to put forth significant effort.  It can be done and it's not impossible or improbable.  It really boils down to being realistic with yourself and your expectations.  If you want to improve your standard of living, you'll need to be aggressive with your career and intelligent with your education.  Staying at a job for 20 years will only ever get you cost of living increases.  If you land your first job out of college and expect to stay there for 20-30 years (that dream died with our grandparents, btw), you'll never break out of your standard of living.    If you are really interested in improving your standard of living, you need to be realistic with yourself.  In a perfect world, any degree/field you want to work in should be able to support your dreams.  But we're not in a perfect world, otherwise this thread wouldn't exist.  And that means you need to use your education opportunity wisely:  get a degree that will primarily assist you in finding high-paying work.    As a borderline millennial, one of the biggest lies we were told was to go to school and learn about what we love.  Our parents and leaders failed us in that message.  Get a practical education that can be leveraged into tangible employment.  That part is important.  You can always go back to school to learn about your passion.  It'll even be more fun because you won't be relying on that for your livelihood.    If you are on that road already, kudos.  Stay the course, weather the rough times (entry-level in your career), and you'll enjoy the fruits of your labor.  If your education is not something that will lead to a stable, well paying career -- then you owe yourself an honest, hard look at why you're going to school.  Good luck"

They've been done a disservice by being told that if they try their best it'll work out and that's not always true.  Unfortunately that opportunity is there it just takes more work than it used to I guess.  While I'm all about affordable housing in the city I think  I want regional transit more.  I feel like it would give people in yours or similar situations more options.  People shouldn't feel like they HAVE to live in the city to be able to have a life here and the other option shouldn't mean needing to have a car and sit in it for a non-trivial portion of their day.  Transit means you can live farther out where it's cheaper, or any number of other reasons people prefer not to live in the city for, and instead of having to sit for an hour driving you have an hour to do whatever while you travel, for example.

Even then it would require a cutter head that just simply doesn't exist at the moment. Remember, Bertha hit a relatively small forgotten pipe and it almost destroyed itself grinding through it.   Mining equipment could probably make reasonable progress through the cutter head, but then you have to figure out how to get that out of the way of the new machine without losing pressure and causing a cave in.  This is all assuming Bertha breaks down again later, underneath the city where digging a giant hole isn't an option. Right now, they're basically replacing/refurbishing everything but the skeleton of the cutter head and putting it back together in the access hole.

Seattle,3dm95b,kamiikoneko,10,Fri Jul 17 17:41:36 2015 UTC,Man am I glad you aren't a city planner
Seattle,3dm95b,redfroody,14,Fri Jul 17 18:03:54 2015 UTC,This seems like a very reasonable question. The project is not going at planned. There must be a point where we decide to abandon it. Maybe that point is when Bertha tunnels under downtown and 2 buildings collapse. Or maybe it's just when it's more than 3 years behind schedule. But it's a relevant question worth thinking about.
Seattle,3dm95b,CaMKIIalpha,3,Fri Jul 17 16:15:21 2015 UTC,"With many industry projects,  there are typically ""go"" ""no-go"" scenarios made a priori...I wonder if they made any before the project began..."
Seattle,3dm95b,kamiikoneko,7,Fri Jul 17 16:59:49 2015 UTC,"lol what?  So you think that the subways and NYC got built with no mistakes, overages, or sacrifices?  I'm not saying that I think the viaduct is a perfect decision, but you don't abandon a project like that if you want to advance a city.  Your attitude is a large part of why Seattle has 15 different useless transit options, none of which work together.  I am telling you now that when the next phase of the subway here occurs, probably to ballard, it is going to have problems, get behind schedule, cost money...it's just...you need to sweat if you want to progress your city.  Bertha hasn't failed, it's just gotten expensive and shitty.  Also the whole buildings collapsing thing is hilarious.  Talk about fucking melodrama haha"
Seattle,3dm95b,SLCamper,4,Fri Jul 17 17:40:34 2015 UTC,"The difference is, we aren't building public transportation with this tunnel.  In fact, there are no plans to use the tunnel for any sort of public transportation.  It's one thing to make sacrifices for something worthwhile, like for instance a subway system.  It's another thing to make sacrifices for a billion dollar hole in the ground that has no exits downtown, a high toll and will only cram more cars into our already overcrowded streets.  Even if the tunnel were being built on time and on budget, it would still be a bad idea.  The fact that it's a dumb idea in the first place make it even more frustrating that we're apparently willing to spend an infinite amount of money on the damn thing."

Double seems almost expected. 10x sounds like a bit much. 100x is just getting ridiculous, and at some point you should just throw in the towel and go with something that's more likely to succeed.  I don't think any buildings will collapse. I'm just demonstrating that there is a scenario where almost everybody will agree to cancel the project. Given that that scenario exists, what is the least-bad situation where we will throw in the towel? (Earthquake buries Bertha?)"

Seattle,3dmskf,elister,5,Fri Jul 17 18:41:10 2015 UTC,I had expected to see this inquiry ultimately.  Widen I-5 through downtown? Where? Do you propose we dynamite numerous high rises and Harborview hospital and other various heavy development flanking both sides of it? Do you realize how prohibitively expensive an undertaking of that would be given the logistics?  TL;DR: Far more than JUST the convention center stands in the way of widening I-5 and to think otherwise is an egregiously simplistic grievance.
Seattle,3dmskf,machines_breathe,3,Sat Jul 18 03:27:11 2015 UTC,The existence of the convention center pretty much kills any chance at widening I-5 in Seattle. Though even if the WSCC was just a vacant lot that whole area makes it almost impossible to change I-5 at all.
Seattle,3dmskf,rocketsocks,4,Fri Jul 17 22:11:39 2015 UTC,"I'd rather we capped I-5 with a park from Madison to Olive, create some new usable public space, new pedestrian, bike and transit connections, reconnect the street grid, and plant a bunch of trees.  I mean, I get that traffic sucks but we've never been able to build our way out of it. Road construction is a feedback loop that induces more demand by funneling money away from more efficient and appropriate alternatives. If Seattle had more grade-separated transit connecting its high density areas a lot of people would opt to not drive, thus freeing roads up for those who really must."

Then look at Seattle, that really never does much to enforce existing laws against homeless.  We won't.  Because it's not the nice thing to do.  Let people sit where they want.  So what if it increases petty crime or phone theft or scares people off.

The shops in downtown near the ferry terminal are definitely worth visiting. And Fay Bainbridge Park has a really nice lookout across the sound towards Ballard. The Bloedel Reserve is a fantastic garden with plenty of foliage, and this time of year is perfect for visiting.  Poulsbo is only about 10 miles from the ferry terminal, and it's a really cute Viking town. Sluy's bakery is really good... better than Top Pot (no I'm not sorry!). Two Brothers Deli is a good place to grab lunch, a little ways from the downtown area.  Point No Point is up past Kingston (in Hansville, 20 miles or so from the ferry), at the northern tip of the Kitsap peninsula. There's a beach and a lighthouse there that's worth checking out.

I remember when I was there, parking was limited--we didn't park in a lot, but on the side of a road, and it was kind of a hike from there.  Maybe they added a lot?

Seattle Times: ""The officer involved in the shooting will be placed on paid administrative leave during the investigation, police said.""  While technically true, without the added information that this is department policy, it can give the impression of suspicion of guilt- which is way to early to know either way.  Same argument for common report that ""an inquest was ordered"". It is department policy to have an inquest in ALL officer involved shootings."
Seattle,3dmsv6,Pivan1,3,Fri Jul 17 17:15:08 2015 UTC,While I see your point I think there's been enough press about officer conduct lately that it's common knowledge that use of force results in administrative leave. Pretty sure that that's standard policy at just about every police department everywhere and most folks know that.
Seattle,3dmsv6,Gizmos_Human,-2,Fri Jul 17 18:58:54 2015 UTC,"You're probably right about administrative leave being standard. However, there are most likely variations from county to county and state to state, such as duration and extent of evaluation before retiring to light duty work and/or full duty. I've seen a lot of reports that use language like ""a mental evaluation was ordered"", when its standard operating procedure.   In this case probably not such a big deal, but it points to a larger issue I've been noticing since being involved in an inquest. I was surprised to learn, after it was over, that the (well educated) jury didn't know what an inquest was, why they were having one, or what their verdict would be used for. Followed shortly thereafter with a news report saying the inquest lasted only one day and ""by day's end the jury had a verdict"", when in fact it had lasted all week. Just urging for more transparency and unbiased reporting (even if unintentional) in general."

I just believe they should.   Thank you for your comment."
Seattle,3dlcle,TheMellifiedMan,2,Sat Jul 18 01:42:26 2015 UTC,"Thanks so much for the thoughtful answer. As you could probably tell from my tentative probe I was unsure if I was expressing my question well, but you've zeroed-in on the subject I wanted to raise.  As a point of reference, my thoughts about law and morality (and I know you weren't referencing 'morality' and all the baggage that word brings with it, but I hope you'll bear with me) have been powerfully shaped by this essay. While I think it's a great read, I'll summarize in case it isn't your cup of tea by saying: I think less is more when it comes to laws, because most laws passed have side effects that go beyond their intended purposes, and these unintended consequences are frequently more determinative of people's actual behavior than the behavior that the law was attempting to proscribe originally.  So, by way of a poor example and metaphor, let's imagine that China outlawed butterflies. This then leads to the black market trade of butterflies and the criminal elements involved with the trade are seeking advantages over one another, so one particularly enterprising criminal finds a way to breed a special type of butterfly that can fly longer without rest than the native species. This hybrid then ends up winning the local Darwin contest and it turns out that in order for these butterflies-with-bullet-wings to breed, the males of the species all need to converge like cicadas at a specific time to spawn. During that time all the male butterflies of this uber-Lepidopterium species constantly beat their wings in a mating display. This has the unintended (or maybe it's intended as a bizarre form of bio-drone warfare) consequence of driving more air across the Gulf Stream which deadens the plants of California, leading to a nationwide food shortage.  Told you it was a poor metaphor. :-) But hopefully that conveys my sentiment. I think we're definitely aligned on the notion that laws 'should' better society, but shoulda, coulda, woulda, and all that. What's your take?"
Seattle,3dlcle,sometimesanengineer,1 point,Sat Jul 18 02:17:05 2015 UTC,"I know I've tried to read this and other sections of The Tao Is Silent before and fallen flat.  But a couple years have passed since then and considering the context in the thread above, I was quickly hooked.  The Taoist really hits home for me with this:   TAOIST:  Oh no!  My principle is far more basic.  It is simply that everyone has the right to do whatever he wants!   ...   TAOIST:  Oh, not at all!  If the people want laws, they have a perfect right to pass them.  The criminal has a perfect right to break them, the police have a perfect right to arrest him, the judge has a perfect right to sentence him to jail, and so on.   It then gets a little deeper than I am usually game for on a Friday night, but he begins to solidify his conclusion   Give up advertizing goodness and duty, and people will indeed regain love of their fellows.   ...   Perhaps a still better way of conveying my real message is to say that if one believes he has the right to do what he wants, then he is more likely to want to do what is right.   And so I find myself agreeing with the Taoist, but am a few steps behind still.   I believe a person is most honestly defined by how they behave when no one is watching.  There is no government setting laws.  You God died, lied or never was.  If you rely upon an external motivator to force your actions and behavior, who are you when it is lifted?  And that has to be the craziest butterfly effect metaphor, complete with actual butterflies, I have read in a while, but I think it conveys the point.  I prefer Australia's rabbit proof fence.   Or the nursery rhyme story of The Lady Who Swallowed a Fly.  In complex systems trying to fix one problem creates others."
Seattle,3dlcle,akkmedk,-2,Sat Jul 18 03:38:40 2015 UTC,I contend that if most people followed the gun transfer laws that society would be improved. While it may not stop criminals from illegally transferring guns it does add punishment. Much like how murder laws don't stop murder from being possible.
Seattle,3dlcle,sometimesanengineer,3,Fri Jul 17 15:56:03 2015 UTC,"Right, you and a majority of Washingtonians that passed it believe it to be a step forward and I respect that. It will stop someone from accidentally transferring a gun to an ineligible  person if they use an FLL for the transaction. I disagree with the law because I believe that the vast majority of bad actors would not use the process through an FLL for the transaction. It then inconveniences everyone who obeys the rules but not criminals - and it's purpose is supposed to be to stop those people from getting their hands on guns. It's like the TSA groping everyone who gets into a plane when private aircraft have no such inspections. We inconvenience everyone while leaving open big holes and accept these constraints on ourselves in hopes ""if it prevents even one incident"". Which it might. Or it might not."

Seattle,3dlcle,puerh_lover,-1,Fri Jul 17 17:58:08 2015 UTC,Is spent shell analysis precise enough to tie random shell casings to this specific pistol? Who sends random shell casings found with no victims or nearby damage to a forensic crime lab anyway? Doesn't make sense to me. That and the 9mm Luger comment make me think they've tied one type of bullet to all these crimes even if they were shot from diff guns.
Seattle,3dlcle,Fteven,4,Fri Jul 17 07:03:22 2015 UTC,"They may have recovered a bullet from the scene and compared it to bullets from other crimes. When a round is fired the barrel leaves a unique pattern on the bullet, much like a fingerprint. I think this can be true for casings too, maybe leaving distinct markings from the extractor and breach but I'm not sure."
Seattle,3dlcle,sometimesanengineer,2,Fri Jul 17 09:54:31 2015 UTC,"Yes, a gun will leave semi unique marks on the cases. There is a bit of forensics they could do. But those marks very with lots of factors including the pressure in the round being fired so it can be imprecise.  Its not like a fingerprint.  The case has to be handled as you load the magazine and that might leave prints (give or take gloves) that could connect the shootings together and the shooter to the gun.  But because marks from the gun change with wear, ammunition, and cleaning of the gun and are not reproducible, there are skeptics."
Seattle,3dlcle,puerh_lover,2,Fri Jul 17 14:48:26 2015 UTC,That's what I was wondering about. I imagine it would be fairly easy to recognize the patterns one type of gun leaves on spent brass. I didn't think the data would be reliable enough to perfectly match randomly found brass in Seattle to one gun. Maybe they've got fancy new forensic magicians with enough time on their hands to sit around analyzing spare brass. Who knows.
Seattle,3dlcle,puerh_lover,2,Fri Jul 17 16:14:48 2015 UTC,"That is true, but twice in the article they mention matching merely spent brass shell casings found in instances where there were no witness, victims, or bullet damage."

Seattle,3dlcle,ChippyMalone,4,Fri Jul 17 16:09:14 2015 UTC,I can imagine a particular gun having a particular shaped firing pin or ejection mechanism that could leave a signature mark.   I also think an expert could just say whatever he wanted and the jury would believe it.
Seattle,3dlcle,Sunfried,1 point,Fri Jul 17 12:58:23 2015 UTC,"Probably guns of the same model give the same mark from pin or ejector, which if true could be used in concert with other data such as bullet striations and eyewitnesses to support a match."
Seattle,3dlcle,Horvaticus,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:34:12 2015 UTC,"Well, statistically speaking, I assume it'd be more likely to find casings spent by one pistol across multiple crime scenes as opposed to finding the same style of casings found at multiple crime scenes.   Not statistically speaking, I'd say it's entirely possible to ID a gun based on the firing pin strike on the primer of the cartridge. There's little minute differences across different builds of guns that'd make it easy to take examples from different crimes and compare them."

I lived in Atlanta for years and the only times I ever took MARTA were to go to the airport and a few times to visit friends in the city when I lived in Alpharetta.  It's almost always quicker to drive or Uber if you're going to anywhere decent.  Edit: and it was decent for going to Braves games if you lived north of the perimeter, just take the line down to 5 Points and hop over to the blue line and go one stop east to Georgia State and walk 15 minutes south.

Seattle,3dkt7m,mcriedel,6,Fri Jul 17 02:05:55 2015 UTC,"""I didn't take MARTA so therefore it isn't useful"" isn't the greatest measurement of a system. Do you know what its ridership is?"

That is across buses, inter-county shuttles, rail, and MARTA-owned disability/rideshare vehicles.  So to say that it's not useful isn't exactly true, but for many people it is.  I wasn't able to find statistics for how many of those rides were connections or transfers, or a breakdown of ridership by area/neighborhood.  That would be the most useful knowledge to have."

One of the reasons why there's no MARTA line to Marietta (upper middle class white suburb), Roswell (same), or Alpharetta (filthy fucking rich white people) is literally that a NIMBY coalition was telling people that ""Criminal elements will ride on the train to your house, break in and steal your TV and valuables, and escape on the next train back to the city.""  I shit you not.  That is literally the reason.  Of course, nothing of the sort has happened and 40 years of history should disprove that stupid idea, but there are a surprisingly large amount of people in those suburbs that still believe that they'll be robbed or mugged or assaulted by ""urban elements"".  Story time!  When I first moved to Alpharetta for a job, I encountered my very first Walmart that wasn't one of the 24 hour supercenters.  I was shopping for some cheap dishes and furniture since I'd just finished unloading the moving truck and wanted dinner, when I heard the announcement on the intercom: ""We will be closing in 30 minutes"" (it was 10:30 at night).  Heavily confused since all of my interactions in Walmart have been at stores that never closed, I asked a manager why they were closing.  Her response? ""We have been having a lot of problems with theft lately, and we discovered that closing at 11 keeps undesirable elements out of our stores.""  Undesirable elements.

I've seen a lot of people get assaulted on MARTA buses, and there have been news stories about people being robbed, shot, and stabbed in some of the worse areas of the city.  I typically avoided riding the bus whenever possible because the risk was too high for my liking, plus with my car it was always faster to drive to my destination because Atlanta is definitely a city built for cars."

It's pretty rare for a metro map to give so much emphasis to the highway system.

When living in Midtown a decade ago, however, I did take the train quite often to work downtown, and to Buckhead, Perimiter Mall, Decatur, and L5P without much difficulty.  I still hold the belief that a train in Seattle would've served the city (denser than ATL even in the 70's) far better however."

Seattle,3dmxuq,mynameisvlad,7,Fri Jul 17 20:38:58 2015 UTC,"Naw dude. If you have a decent carrier (i.e. not T-Mobile or Sprint), you get reception in the stadium. It's a bit spotty, but AT&T and Verizon both have a crapload of boosters in that area. Worst case, you'd have to jog across the street to a bar for internet service... at least you can catch most of the game.

Seattle,3dmxuq,pipedreamSEA,1 point,Sat Jul 18 02:48:02 2015 UTC,Depends on why you are going to the stadium.  Varying policies for different events.  I believe the policy for the Seahawks is the most stringent because they have to fall in line with an overarching NFL security policy which is very strict.

Seattle,3dmvfs,sarhoshamiral,20,Fri Jul 17 15:43:48 2015 UTC,"yes, they can ticket you, and I think most people see the lower speed and just choose to pay better attention, knowing traffic will soon come to a halt. At least, that's how I deal with them on I-5. I see the lower speed, I stay with traffic, but I'm looking for the inevitable traffic jam so I don't have to slam on my brakes, it seems to work in that sense. before those boards, I used to slam on my brakes a lot more often entering Seattle."
Seattle,3dmvfs,alexfrancisburchard,2,Fri Jul 17 16:01:13 2015 UTC,"They are meant to slow down incoming traffic to slower section ahead of you, so if it is 45 when the road is empty it probably means there is congestion couple miles ahead.  Enforcemented shouldn't be difficult I assume the times are logged somewhere so cops can just say at the time of the ticket the speed limit was X, driver was going with Y and X can be shown by WSDOT logs."
Seattle,3dmvfs,Phoenix-D,2,Fri Jul 17 16:06:56 2015 UTC,You'd also need to show the driver had a chance to see the amended speed.
Seattle,3dmvfs,Wisconsin_Expat,0,Fri Jul 17 16:12:51 2015 UTC,Speed cameras would work well for enforcing variable speed limits and would generate a fuckton of ticket revenue given the current attitudes towards them.

Seattle,3dmvfs,Schwa142,6,Fri Jul 17 22:18:23 2015 UTC,I get why it is implemented and I actually find them useful and try to follow them as several times they saved me from joining the stop & go traffic and instead going at a constant lower speed.   But they would work a lot better if people actually followed them but without enforcement that doesn't look likely.
Seattle,3dmvfs,MajorLazy,5,Fri Jul 17 16:06:24 2015 UTC,"If it says ""Limit"" it's enforceable.  Ever notice those yellow speed signs on on-ramps...?  They don't say ""Limit"" because it's just a suggested speed and you won't get a ticket for going over them."
Seattle,3dmvfs,intuition-j,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:11:03 2015 UTC,"Black on white is regulatory (enforceable) while yellow is warning.  http://www.trafficsign.us/signcolor.html  The text may be significant also, but color is the real key here."
Seattle,3dmvfs,bkelly3,2,Fri Jul 17 16:15:14 2015 UTC,"I think enforcement is a challenge, similar to when you have tag team laser/chase cars for speeders, the court burden might go up. Just like the variable signs on I-5 and SR-520, they would need to know 1) when and where was the violation, 2) a record of the variable speeds at that time, 3) a way to prove which variable limit sign the person saw [i.e., although the limit sign might say 35 mph right now, it might have said 55 mph when the specific car went by the sign, requiring video evidence and maybe even more]"
Seattle,3dmvfs,GuinnessDraught,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:03:23 2015 UTC,What really chaps my hide is when folks roll down the lanes that are explicitly labelled with the big red X meaning the lane is closed (usually because of an accident ahead).
Seattle,3dmvfs,Eskali160,4,Fri Jul 17 16:49:40 2015 UTC,"You should ride out a lane until it actually ends, whether it's a normal merging scenario or a lane is closed ahead. You want everyone merging at one point, zippering one after another at the actual convergence point. Everyone just merging willy-nilly and too early creates far more slowdown.  Note: this is not the same as a backed-up on/off ramp with a line and someone cutting in at the last minute. That's a dickhead."
Seattle,3dmvfs,Semper_OFP,8,Fri Jul 17 17:41:22 2015 UTC,"That's true for lanes you are legally allowed on, when it's marked with an X you aren't allowed in it. It's not a merge sign, it's a closed sign."

I loved living in Seattle, and it was a great experience. Just make sure you have good renters/homeowners insurance, I suppose.

He essentially took the line ""everything West of I5 is going to be toast"", which has already been dismissed by the seismologists as very misleading, and used that to deduce that all of Seattle is going to die.

Two of them just happen to lead to I-90, where about half of users are going. The fact that they're separated from each other is irrelevant to their load, which is well balanced."
Seattle,3dk27u,Bensch,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:14:04 2015 UTC,"Odd, I'm usually stuck in traffic on I-5, not traffic for the I-90 Collector/Distributer Lanes.  If they lead somewhere else, they aren't part of the road, they are Exit Only lanes.  That entire section, from 520 to I-90 needs a complete rethink, redesign and replacement."

Seattle,3dk27u,Bensch,2,Fri Jul 17 17:20:43 2015 UTC,"Because we can eliminate weaving, provide proper acceleration/deceleration lanes, correct issues with Left Exits and Popular Right Exits being close together.  Perhaps rebuild the Express Lanes to have more lanes and have direct access to and from I-90, and the stadiums.  You could also eliminate some of the bridges, add lanes, and even mass transit access (light rail, monorail, or busses) separate from the traffic lanes so they can bypass all the shit that happens between 520 and I-90."
Seattle,3dk27u,TEG24601,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:26:59 2015 UTC,"""more lans"", ""provide proper... lanes"", ""add lanes""  All of those things would worsen congestion over where it is today. The split of the freeway into two segments already does a lot to eliminate weaving."

The secret is in things like cheese curds and fries and gravy ... just being normal and good.

It's at the point that I can't wait to go back and visit my friends and family in Kansas so I can get my hands on legit biscuits and gravy.    It's goddamn simple, guys. You take a simple, flaky buttermilk biscuit (not the over-kneaded quickbreads that end up more like dinner rolls).  Then you brown up some country sausage. COUNTRY SAUSAGE. PUT THE GODDAMN ITALIAN SAUSAGE AWAY BEFORE I CUT YOU. Drain off all but a bit of the grease, throw in some flour, brown it a bit, add whole milk slowly and heat it until it's thick, then spoon it on the buttermilk biscuit. No extra seasonings except maybe salt and pepper. The sausage will handle the flavor.  My problem is that I can either find a place that makes good gravy, but puts it over a shit biscuit, or has an incredible biscuit but over-complicated, shit gravy. I can make it myself at home, but goddamn, guys."

Gotta get back to the Midwest or South, they just can't leave well enough alone up here.  You can say the same about literally every comfort food from the rest of the country: Seattle will fuck it up.  And then you'll get a bunch of clueless people who have never had 'the real thing' talk up how great some over-wrought local version of something is, you'll go there and try it, and be really disappointed.    But you can't say so out loud, or you might offend the Seattle person that thought it was great who doesn't know any better.  CSB:  Had this experience with Deep Dish Pizza.  For years, I told people how it was in Chicago, and then I'd get referred to all kinds of stupid local mistakes that did not do it right.  Finally, I took someone who was from here to Chicago and fed them actual authentic local Chicago style 'zah .  Light bulb.  On.  ""Oh.  So this really is better.""

Nobody else in town comes close.  Delfinos is stuffed not deep dish; and that's really about it.  That Pizza Place in North Bend was really close (and using recipes from Chicago) but it closed, then burned down.  We had a Pizzeria Unos for about six months but it closed.  Plenty of local places get talked up as having deep dish to this day, none are.  So the moral of the story is:  Don't move to Seattle expecting the comfort food of your native land, unless you want Korean/Japanese style.  We do those really well, even more or less inventing one of our own, the classic Teriyaki Chicken place.  Those amazingly are rare to non existent in many parts of the country, which always comes as something of a shock since they're so prevalent here.  Skip the deep dish pizza, the biscuits n gravy, the poutine.  Skip the cheese steak, the ""LA Style Mexican,"" and the BBQ.  Seattle has tried all, Seattle has failed at all."
Seattle,3dkxex,my_lucid_nightmare,4,Fri Jul 17 16:05:06 2015 UTC,"Similar with NY Pizza. I have a friend from California who sighed wistfully coming up here saying ""Man, I wish I could find some good pizza like back in (pizza place in his Californian college town). The really good NY style stuff.""  Me: ""...That's not NY style pizza."" (I've had this place's pizza when visiting. I've also had legit New York pizza)  Him: ""Sure it is."" (keep in mind he's never been to New York)  Me: ""That's great, but I've had legit NY Style Pizza, and while your place was good, don't ever call it NY pizza.""   At least, in my case, I'm from Wichita, KS. Thankfully I can get Wichita Style Pizza any goddamn time I want. Thanks, Pizza Hut."
Seattle,3dkxex,Fizzbit,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:21:43 2015 UTC,"And then you'll get a bunch of clueless people who have never had 'the real thing' talk up how great some over-wrought local version of something is, you'll go there and try it, and be really disappointed.    what is paseo.  seriously though, I've lived in almost every region of the country and I think a lot of seattle residents maybe haven't been to other cities and then just assume that whatever is here is the best.  top pot for example, 2 dollars for a donut that would be unacceptable on the east coast.  does seattle even have a cuisine or is it just ""fucking up and overcomplicating other regional dishes""?"
Seattle,3dkxex,not_gryz,3,Fri Jul 17 20:11:25 2015 UTC,"Well, we have a few things.  The classic Teriyaki chicken with the syrupy sweet sauce, you cannot get that mainstay anywhere else but the Northwest it turns out.  Try, I have.    Fresh King Salmon and Dungeness Crab are obviously pretty good here, possibly best in the world.  So yes, I'd argue we have a few things, it's just like everywhere else, if you go away from the native area you can't find the same quality.  The only difference is Seattle is the recipient of many expats from elsewhere, who are surprised to find their own mainstay comfort food from their homelands is exotic cuisine or useless knock-off here.  I was like that, I searched-and-bitched looking for Chicago style deep dish pizza for years.  Finally gave up.  Though Kylies in Fremont is pretty not bad if you do want to check it out.  In Chicagoland they'd be a solid OK to not great.  I won't trash Top Pot as I think they do some things well (Apple fritters, maple bars) but I think they got caught halfway between truly high end like Voodoo and fully loaded donuts like that, and mass produced Duncan Donut style stuff like that.  They're neither, but they wind up satisfying fans of neither niche.  They definitely want to play the DIY local card in their marketing, yet they aren't loaded enough to match quality once anyone's had a Voodoo or others in that class.  But they aren't truly cheap mass produced either as you've pointed out.  So they do kind of cash in on the fact there's no widely accepted Duncan-donut style here.  We did have Winchells, but those seem to have collapsed back to LA where they came from.  Really, Seattle sat out the DIY Donut Revival of the late 1990s/early 2000s wave that got us Voodoo and friends down south - we were already in love with bistro pastries and our mass produced class is more likely stuff like croissants at Starbucks than donuts from the gas station.  And we already had Top Pot.  Somehow we managed to convince ourselves that was the last word in DIY Donutting.  It is weird, I'd think we'd have the Voodoo style donut someplace by now, and I bet it'd do pretty well if we did.  The belief was once Seattle was ""too healthy"" for true donut culture (in the Duncan style) but that ship has sailed.  We definitely will eat big fat loads of comfort food... we just don't have anything that fits in the donut class at this point in time, unless you count Krispy Kreme (and they're awesome, but they're also not the whole family of donuts by any means)"

If your dog likes to swim around fences, this is important. Big field for tossing balls. The dogs and owners are nearly all courteous and well-behaved. It's a happy place. There are some pack walkers, but most of them are nice and responsible. There's a pack walker volunteer group that cleans and maintains the park. During weekday lunch-time you can access the NOAA station property for a beautiful lakeside walk (dog must be leashed).   CONS: Not enough shade. Too many kids and strollers.   Woodland Park  PROS: Shady. Posted signs discourage admission of kids under age 10. It's not very large, but it's a fun hilly terrain with trees. Three double security gates.   CONS: I notice more aggressive dogs here, with unapologetic owners. I wonder if the hilly terrain gives some dogs a ""king of the hill"" complex.   NorthAcres  PROS: Nicely-maintained shady wooded winding paths. Paths lined with woodchips. Dog loves to run the paths. It's easy to play hide and seek. I've never seen it crowded.

You'll pay more, but he is a superstar vet: skilled, compassionate, sensitive, erudite, curious, down-to-earth, great bedside manner. Nice facility.  For our healthy young dog, we use Greenwood Animal Hospital on Aurora. Reasonably-priced. Dr Z is really nice and takes good care of our young hound. Nice staff."

Seattle,3dl520,pivolover,2,Fri Jul 17 05:31:34 2015 UTC,Maybe the tenant could circumvent that by eating marijuana edibles on the property versus smoking it.
Seattle,3dl520,bigpandas,2,Fri Jul 17 16:21:14 2015 UTC,"Depends if possession of marijuana is prohibited by lease (either explicitly or a mention to not using premises for unlawful purposes that includes federal law).  OP has posted here but hasn't addressed this question, which is the answer to his/her entire question.  Don't know why he/she won't answer."
Seattle,3dl520,pivolover,2,Sat Jul 18 02:47:41 2015 UTC,"Another perspective though: it is possible there is a clause in the lease about illegal drug usage/possession.  Since it is still federally illegal, and the landlord has made his perspective of which laws known, I would think he might have a valid case (much more so if MJ was illegal when the lease was originally signed).  From my experience, most boilerplate leases have some Drug clause in there.  Obviously it would depend on the judge if taken to court, but I don't think it is as clear cut as you made it.  Cheers"
Seattle,3dl520,PirateKeanu,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:33:56 2015 UTC,"Illegal activities do not need to be specified in a lease to be grounds for eviction. You can be evicted if convicted of illegal activities on the premises. Possession of certain quantities and consumption of MJ is explicitly legal in Washington. Who is going to arrest, prosecute and convict the tenant for possession? DEA? FBI? CIA? Seattle municipal court would very likely throw out an eviction notice for MJ possession unless the landlord can show the tenants signature on a lease that prohibits such possession. IANAL so this may be complete bullshit, but it sounds logical to me"
Seattle,3dl520,catalytica,19,Fri Jul 17 23:44:58 2015 UTC,"This has come up with firearms in other states -- can you contract with a landlord to forfeit your 2nd amendment rights on rented property?  The answer is usually yes.  There's one state I know that does not allow this in leases (Minnesota).  May be more and more in the works.  So: that's a Constitutionally protected right, and still you and your landlord can agree via contract that you forfeit it.    Now imagine that instead of Constitutionally protected right, we're talking ""prohibited by federal law.""  That said, I don't know how an apartment complex can ""follow Federal Law on marijuana usage.""  I think that just means that the owner/manager 'agrees' with federal law in the sense that he/she doesn't like weed.  DEA is definitely not going to be interested in some landlord calling and saying that a tenant of his smokes weed sometimes, or that he saw a jar of it, or probably even a few plants.  And it's legal under state law, so all he can do is....evict you for violation of your lease.  There's a process for that, of course...he can't just change locks or give you 24 hours to get out.  I will admit that I don't know if RCW comes in play here, but it's hard to imagine that the state legislature or the voters made a law that says landlords can't prohibit drug possession.    ***** WAIT:  Rereading your post -- does your lease prohibit marijuana possession?  Or was this thrown out in the email for the first time?  (My lease says no smoking of any king, including marijuana -- which I don't on premises --  but nothing about possession.)   If that's the case, we might have a different situation, depending on other aspects of the lease."
Seattle,3dl520,pivolover,0,Fri Jul 17 04:00:54 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the informative reply! Definitely interesting to see some similar precedence.  Not that you might know but if anyone else does, at what point do we get to stop calling it drug possession? I can walk up to a cop and wave a joint in front of his face and nothing happens. But if I walk into my living room in my own apartment with it in my pocket my landlord threatens me with ""Legal action"" for drug possession? Seems pretty fucked up."
Seattle,3dl520,pivolover,9,Fri Jul 17 04:22:27 2015 UTC,"I meant no offense, just a legal perspective.  (I smoke myself.)  I was just saying that it's doubtful that either the people or the state legislature took the step to mandate that landlords allow tenants to possess a federally scheduled drug.  ""Legal action"" does not necessarily mean criminal action. Here, it likely means eviction, which is a legal action.  Again, unless the landlord has some extraordinary pull at the DEA, this isn't a criminal matter in any way.    This is a contract/landlord-tenant issue.  I am a renter also.  If I sign a contract with landlord that says 'I agree not to bring a bicycle into the apartment. If I do, it constitutes breach,"" and then I bring a bicycle in, it can lead to eviction.  Even though bicycle ownership is entirely legal.  (Obviously landlord can't restrict your right to legal activity off-property...so saying that you were prohibited from owning a bicycle would not pass muster.)  Similarly, if you signed a lease that says ""I will not bring marijuana on the premises, nor possess it, nor consume it in any way on premises...if I do, it constitutes breach."" You can be evicted for bringing marijuana onto the property, possessing it, or smoking/eating/vaping/swallowing it."

Seattle,3dl520,pivolover,1 point,Fri Jul 17 04:50:20 2015 UTC,Here's how I get past it.  Get a dab rig or a vaporizer.   The rules say no smoking and as long as your materials don't combust....you should be fine.  Concentrates are cheap and plentiful in Seattle.
Seattle,3dl520,_ayli_,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:14:50 2015 UTC,It's not legal where you live. The Feds can arrest you for it. The state however doesn't care.
Seattle,3dl520,shitduke,-1,Sat Jul 18 01:52:43 2015 UTC,"IANAL, but I don't think the complex can just opt to not follow state law. State law says that possession of marijuana is just fine, and SCOTUS rulings on state vs federal in this matter are unclear at best. That said, state law also does not allow smoking marijuana ""in public"", so by banning smoking inside your apartment complex may be effectively banning all smoking of marijuana. That still leaves posession and edibles as an open question.  If your complex is owned by an out of state company, it is entirely possible they are just covering their ass, since it is still illegal for any interstate entity to have anything to do with marijuana. If you have a decent relationship with your complex and noone complains about your smoking, you probably don't have anything to worry about. If your landlord is out to get you, they may try to evict you based on marijuana posession, but that's going to be a constitutional lawyer's wet dream and it's anyone's guess as to who will come out ahead in that case."
Seattle,3dl520,wildcatsnbacon,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:36:19 2015 UTC,"No no no no no.  There is nothing to litigate on federal vs state law. The Supremacy Clause settled that in 1789. Federal law trumps.  Are you suggesting there might be a Constitutional right to possess marijuana?  That's not 'anyone's guess' in 2015.   The stuff about out of state landlord is red herring/irrelevant.  This is simple: does OP's lease explicitly prohibit possession of marijuana? If so, absent a state law prohibiting that clause, it is perfectly legal for a landlord to evict a tenant for breach of contract.  If not, it gets more interesting. Most leases say something like 'no illegal activity.' That would be more interesting to litigate but I suspect in the absence of the identification of controlling legal authority (I.e. ""the premises shall not be used for any activity prohibited by state or local law. Violation is a material breach of this contract.""), a court would still uphold a LL's right to evict someone violating federal law."
Seattle,3dl520,juniormantis,1 point,Sat Jul 18 02:38:09 2015 UTC,"Federal law trumps provided there is jurisdiction. The tenth amendment makes it clear that the states have jurisdiction, unless explicitly specified otherwise in the constitution. The one caveat is the interstate commerce clause, which the federal government has been using to pass all sorts of laws that would otherwise not be allowed. You'd be far better off to cite Gonzales v Raich, but that ruling has not yet been tested when a state explicitly creates a recreational marijuana market."
Seattle,3dl520,gl00pp,0,Fri Jul 17 07:12:58 2015 UTC,Only an accurate restatement of what the plan was before everyone decided to bend over.
Seattle,3dl520,pivolover,0,Fri Jul 17 13:29:55 2015 UTC,"I'd start looking for a new place now, and just GTFO.  Who lives in a place like that?  Anytime a federal law is cited I almost immediately lulz and no longer take that person serious.    I'd also find out of a way out of the lease, and then I'd go the extra mile of making sure everyone knows they aren't weed friendly."
Seattle,3dl520,shitduke,-13,Fri Jul 17 17:16:39 2015 UTC,"I work at a convenience store and a guy came in to buy Stinger (a vitamin supplement used to pass drug tests) because he had a UA for his child custody case. Exclaiming ""I should be able to smoke pot because it's legal."" All he cares about is himself, just like you OP. It's still a drug and just because it's legal doesn't mean your community has to be accepting of it."
