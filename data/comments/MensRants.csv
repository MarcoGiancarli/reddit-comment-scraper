The one office is in our hometown and it's managed by women and the senior female staff (not management) bully and cajole and abuse the newer staff, swear at work like it's a job requirement and are generally a bunch of entitled twats. When something needs to be addressed, the female manager has so little control that she calls a staff meeting and then CRIES to everyone in the office to get them to behave.  The OTHER office is in a town 1/2 an hour away. This office is managed by men. There are NONE of the behavioral problems here. The men are fair and more importantly, respected by the staff.  She has a choice and has consequently never chosen the female managed office.  Incidentally, the female to male ratio in these offices is like 8 to 1."

They get nourished thru it, and will not be judged as hard (proof http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10755-014-9313-4) , therefor never getting forced to really learn any thing, and therefor, they are utterly pathetic when they get there diplomas.

I already have had to warn one girlfriend that I have a really vengeful ex, and I'm fairly sure she has impersonated one of my actual friends on Facebook to see my posts.  She told me recently that she's contemplating suicide.  I know she's attempted it before, and I'm not sure if she's bluffing or not.  I feel a little bad that part of me wants her to do it just so she'd leave me alone and stop forcing herself into my life.  I need a break.  I tried reaching out to an abuse support group in my area.  The staff was very courteous but didn't know what to do with me because I'm a man and all.

I think it's at least an interesting idea to think about or research.  At any rate, I think the cat-calling thing is a real issue, even if it's not very widespread. The argument that women should just be brave enough to brush off verbal harassment doesn't really work when threats/advances come from a threatening person.

And it's certainly not an issue of sexism, even if so. First of all it happens to men as well; secondly, even if it's annoying, that doesn't make it sexism. People don't say ""hey beautiful"" because they think you're worth less than men, they say it because that's what they're thinking.   The argument that women should just be brave enough to brush off verbal harassment doesn't really work when threats/advances come from a threatening person.   Agreed, but that's not catcalling, that's harassment and happens to men more than women. Maybe not advances, but in general."
MensRants,37xgsf,Amunium,1 point,Sun May 31 13:42:11 2015 UTC,I'm still waiting to hear just one legendary cat-call.
MensRants,37xgsf,sizzletron,0,Sun May 31 14:27:45 2015 UTC,"What I was thinking when I wrote that was that the roots of Western culture are Greece/Rome, which were patriarchal societies (kyriarchical as well, but those things aren't necessarily mutually exclusive) in which space was gender-coded. IE, the woman's domain was the home and when she wasn't there she covered her face/head and was generally accompanied by a man or a slave. A more modern argument might revolve around, say, American customs of sexual modesty and what women can wear in public being different from what men can wear in public (although that has more to do with the nation's roots in Puritanism as far as I understand). Certainly in both examples, society is exerting control over women in public spaces that it does not exert over men, and we're only just now reaching an age of sexual egalitarianism where we're starting to eliminate double standards like ""women should cover more of their bodies than men."" Really I just thought the comic took an interesting approach by looking at historical/societal models of power instead of the usual ""men-who-cat-call-are-horny-and-aggressive"" rhetoric. I'd like to see the idea researched and expanded on by someone who has a degree in history or sociology rather than a girl who drew a web-comic, though.  I don't know if we agree here, but I think cat-calling can often be classified as street harassment. As mentioned, if a stranger who is physically superior to me implies he/she wants something from me (even through a compliment), be it sex or my wallet, I'll be intimidated if it's obvious that they have the means to physically dominate me and take what they want. I think most unarmed men have the means to overpower most unarmed women because of natural size and strength disparity, so a lot of women feel unsafe when they are singled out by strange men. In that sense, it's a gendered issue. It doesn't necessarily have anything to do with sexism, but that women are on average a more physically vulnerable group.  I think another important thing to consider is that there are virtually no street harassment apologists whereas there are cat-calling apologists. I think the biggest problem is that people don't understand how random street compliments can be intimidating (to anybody). If I've got a Rolex on and a big stranger with big muscles tells me it's a pretty watch, I don't give a damn if he/she was trying to be nice. My reaction is always going to be to tense up and get ready to run or to defend myself, just in case. From a woman's perspective, a whole lot of men look big and strong. The only difference being ""nice Rolex"" becomes ""nice physical features"""

Joe: I bought her a male tears mug. She earned it after the blowjob she gave me last week.  Jack: I'm going to ask Jill if she'll be in our bukkake.  Kurt: Jill is into that sort of thing?

MensRants,37g6dd,SarahC,2,Thu May 28 05:58:33 2015 UTC,"Basically the fact that women consider themselfs the better humans,  yet they consume shit shit en masse. Sure, men have special interest magazines too. But they often are about something technical or some hobby and not 100 % about gossip, fashion and celebrities. And considering the content of these magazines, you just HAVE to assume that many women are complete retards.  Remember how they claim that the STEM-fields are sexist and how ""scary"" it is if some scientist wears a T-Shirt with some comic-chicks. Well where are the special STEM-fields magazine that are targeted towards women? Or maybe SOME magazine about technic,  planes or anything targeted at women. It's not there.   We have the prove, what women want, right in front of our very eyes. Yet they claim the polar opposite."
MensRants,37g6dd,7rthan7,1 point,Thu May 28 06:41:01 2015 UTC,"You make a good point about demand driving supply.  There's a shed-load of Otaku out there..but for many they're embarrassed to even be seen buying it.  So indeed, where are the RC-Planes magazines for women... men may get embarrassed to buy what they want, so we can imagine women would be too (trying to fit with 'the image')...... but men still managed to create demand!  Even if women were oppressed into not buying tec mags - surely we'd see the ""under the radar"" magazine's supplied to the niche market?  Nope, not a thing..."
MensRants,379bye,wiseprogressivethink,6,Mon May 25 22:50:00 2015 UTC,I have a hard time believing this.  They buy sex because they have no time for a relationship?  This is the most illogical reason ever.   That's like buying bicycle parts because you have no time to fix your bike.
MensRants,379bye,xNOM,4,Tue May 26 11:03:52 2015 UTC,I haven't ever heard an explanation of men's sexual consumption behavior like this.  It's just easier to call men pervy I guess.

MensRants,379bye,rsresnor,5,Wed May 27 00:45:31 2015 UTC,"BBC further reported Hunter as saying that the female penguins probably didn't engage in prostitution only for stones. Hunter believed ""what they are doing is having copulation for another reason and just taking the stones as well. We don't know exactly why, but they are using the males."" This behavior was also suggested as a mate choice process by which the females might find a possible future mate. This would provide a female penguin with another male penguin should their current mate die. The male penguins, the study speculates, were engaged in sex with the prostitute females only for sexual satisfaction.   Fuck this sounds all really familiar."
MensRants,379bye,_bluerabbit_,1 point,Thu May 28 10:46:33 2015 UTC,Also familiar is the question:  why can't the female penguins find their own damn pebbles?  :-)

MensRants,3797t4,grindmonkey,1 point,Mon May 25 22:18:30 2015 UTC,With looking for women who will only date white men I think you will just have to get used to that (In my mind it shouldn't really matter). Cultural and race acceptance is a major part of a more left based mindset.

Gas doesn't look to be a problem in this world or reason for society's fall. I don't know how m left with so many more questions then I like to be left with at the end of a movie.   Previous mad max movies at least left fewer lose ends."
MensRants,375hs7,redskinsnation123,1 point,Tue May 26 19:36:54 2015 UTC,I thought you hated the movie because I know many people who went and watched it and hated it because they had no context on what was going on as they had not seen the previous movies. Other than that I can see you have made some valid points
MensRants,375hs7,evilkenevil,1 point,Tue May 26 19:44:38 2015 UTC,Well it had far more no context or background characters then ever before so I can see why many people would hate it.   I was waiting for a furiosa flash back right before they detoured from the gas town supply run....perfect place to see her past and motivation and see what drives her to save those women.  I went in looking for feminist propaganda and found more poor story telling then anything. I was left wanting to see more furiosa and pissed that such a good actor was left with no background story.
