Playdate,3bcsqx,stridernfs,1 point,Sun Jun 28 06:21:20 2015 UTC,"That's not necessarily my problem, I've tried plenty of times without having skype or anything on my computer on at all. At times I've tried as my XBOX the only online thing, and though it was much better every here and there it still was BAD. I think I might just be screwed."
Playdate,3bbl0e,Alkpwn77,1 point,Sat Jun 27 17:35:05 2015 UTC,Happy to play SupCom 2 :-P
Playdate,3bbl0e,jones77,2,Sat Jun 27 17:56:17 2015 UTC,"I'm not a huge fan of SupCom 2. The maps are tiny, they got rid of tons of units and structures from the other games, and the matches are really short. I played it on a friend's computer once and didn't like it so I don't own it."
Playdate,3bbl0e,jones77,1 point,Sat Jun 27 17:58:41 2015 UTC,What you said but the opposite is how I feel about SupCom FA.  ;-)
Playdate,3bbl0e,lazybum965,1 point,Sat Jun 27 21:50:27 2015 UTC,So you think there are more units and bigger maps on supcom 2? Have you ever actually plaid supcom fa? It's a completely different game from 2.
Playdate,3bbl0e,jones77,2,Sat Jun 27 23:31:38 2015 UTC,I think he means he enjoys smaller maps and less units.
Playdate,3bbl0e,shooter_magavin,1 point,Sun Jun 28 04:44:31 2015 UTC,I've played it a few times. I found it long and confusing where SupCom2 was accessible and enjoyable.
Playdate,3bbl0e,bro918,1 point,Sun Jun 28 13:00:33 2015 UTC,if you use a mic i will play some supreme commander.
Playdate,3bbz1e,jfletch99,1 point,Sat Jun 27 19:37:54 2015 UTC,Game on.  Enlighten me though. MvM when it released was released with Normal & Hard modes. However the hard mode was locked behind the MvM keys that you could only get through the cash shop. Did they change this at all?
Playdate,3bbz1e,vf-noclue,1 point,Sat Jun 27 19:58:07 2015 UTC,"Oh, yeah. Four or five normal difficulties now. Normal, Intermediate, Advanced, Expert, and Nightmare."

Playdate,3barm9,ryangillam,1 point,Sat Jun 27 12:29:37 2015 UTC,Are you going to be playing borderlands the pre-sequel at all? I've been looking to replay it but only want to tackle it again in co-op
Playdate,3barm9,lessthanzero89,1 point,Sun Jun 28 16:10:55 2015 UTC,"I bought the Pre-sequel, and I'm planning on starting it once I finish BL2 at least once. I've played through BL2 before, so as long as I've got someone to coop with it should be done soonish :)"
Playdate,3barm9,lessthanzero89,1 point,Sun Jun 28 16:19:45 2015 UTC,"I've played BL2 a bit too much. Still never beat the one DLC I actually cared about though, which was the Tiny Tina one. Hit me up on steam if you want"
