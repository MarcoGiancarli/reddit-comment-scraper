Using the Pyrex name may be a reference to how Pyrex containers can change cheap ingredients into expensive crack, but the pricing is not.  Virgil Abloh didn't design a bunch of clothes, decide to call the brand ""Pyrex"", then make the prices astronomical to make a reference.  More likely he decided to make expensive clothes, decided to design over cheap stock, then chose the name."

malefashion,3e2km5,sexy_knee,4,Tue Jul 21 17:27:31 2015 UTC,Some of the mark up is import taxes and shipping because it comes from Japan. Plus the quality and manufacturing of the garments is very high quality. There are many worse offenders in my opinion.
malefashion,3e2km5,timmmmmay,7,Tue Jul 21 17:38:19 2015 UTC,"Construction quality really isn't that high... it's not that high now, and it wasn't that high in the mystical 2008-ish era as well. Anyone who's owned FBTs from back then can tell you that the sole will separate just like any other sneaker with a glued on sole. The construction of their non-technical apparel is also nothing special. I will say their materials are doubtlessly absurdly nice, though.  The skyrocketing of prices really can't be stressed enough though. I got my first pair brand new for less than $300."
malefashion,3e2km5,sexy_knee,2,Tue Jul 21 18:38:40 2015 UTC,"FBTs are a bad example I think, I was referring to the shirts, outerwear etc.   But yeah - it is overpriced. I just think that with stuff like Pyrex Vision or printed Fear of God Tees you're getting ripped off way worse."
malefashion,3e2km5,timmmmmay,2,Tue Jul 21 19:20:05 2015 UTC,"Oh, without a fraction of a doubt. I think the only Visvim pieces with truly superlative quality are the gore-tex pieces, and they've been putting out less and less of that in recent years. The hybrid pieces like the Mies coat with gore-tex inners are great as well."
malefashion,3e2km5,trippy_grape,2,Tue Jul 21 19:49:48 2015 UTC,"Some of the mark up is import taxes and shipping because it comes from Japan.   Visvim is soooo cheap in Japan, especially with the exchange to the dollar. I'm so pissed at myself for not buying more when I visited last year."
malefashion,3e2km5,telemodal,2,Tue Jul 21 22:29:26 2015 UTC,"I thought that as well, but I didn't think it was THAT big of a contributor to price. Then again, Geobaskets are 650 something euro retail before taxes and shipping so maybe it is all just taxes. Does that mean buying Visvim in Japan is significantly cheaper? I think it'd be worth the trip if it is.  No dispute about the quality and manufacturing here though, Visvim is top notch when it comes to that. However I really do believe pricing is still overpriced despite its quality."
malefashion,3e2km5,TheLouisVuittonPawn,4,Tue Jul 21 18:18:25 2015 UTC,"Its definitely a good amount cheaper in japan, but the stores that stock it themselves markup the price. I know DSM charges a shit ton for vis stuff, like 1k for the backpacks that are ~700 on the vis webstore"

I like to see people constantly experiment till they find there own groove THEY created,  following trends and whats current, just for the sake of being trendy and current, i really see no point in that.  (that being said, if you like whats current, doesn't mean you should hate it, but it doesn't need to become and obsession attached to your identity)"

Try out different styles and trends and settle on the ones that work with me and my lifestyle.   I like the plain toe, two pieces of leather Chelsea alternatives somebody linked below with the zippers instead of the elastic. Something about the elastic has always been ehh to me...

malefashion,3e0hfj,EJ-ericjackson,2,Wed Jul 22 02:16:06 2015 UTC,"I (somewhat) agree with everything here except the last statement which I think is an unfair generalization. Some people care less about being progressive or avant-garde and just want a good look that works with their body type and style. Say what you will about Hedi but he showed the masses how cool the skinny jean / chelsea combo looked. And I'm sure many are buying into the look not for the sake of ""being trendy and current,"" but because it's a cool look that they had previously been unexposed to.  And to preempt the argument that ""consumers are just sheep"" or ""Hedi's a marketer, not a designer"" or whatever, man, some people just wanna look cool. Ain't nothing wrong with that, it's their money and how they spend it shouldn't be a source of personal grief... (I realize this may come off as hypocritical since I just called out SLP in the overpriced thread, but I think there's a difference between pointing out a brand as overpriced and criticizing its clients for buying into it, mindlessly or not)"

Again, my lifestyle matches my clothing so when people hear what I do for work and the social events I attend I think it all makes sense to them. Or they at least accept it.

In other words, IMO jumpsuits and the like are statement pieces so unique that they can easily dominate your wardrobe, if the rest of your wardrobe consists of OCBDs and uniqlo chinos it's painfully discrepant every time you bust out the apron. But if your daily rotation consists of multiple dick ovens dickhole shirts and bondage pants and latex dipped sneakers there's less discrepancy due to relative difference. Same goes for anything that is so unique it creates discrepancy with its surroundings -- if you've got this on your coffee table next to a stack of Better Homes and Gardens...... weird as shit.  With that being said, there are definitely more low-key jumpsuits, etc. Someone posted a really cool fit with a Dickies jumpsuit several months ago."
malefashion,3dwrg8,timmmmmay,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:19:22 2015 UTC,"totally fair point, it's definitely a challenge with a piece like that to effectively balance it with the rest of your wardrobe without being as off-putting as a giant stone dick as you mentioned.   i guess the question then is how you effectively find that balance, is a ""toned-down"" approach the way to go or is it just how it's styled? because these kinds of pieces are already present within womenswear in certain capacities and it's very easily pulled off in that realm."
malefashion,3dwrg8,timmmmmay,2,Mon Jul 20 05:44:22 2015 UTC,"Well, I guess it depends on if you want a less weird jumpsuit, or if you want a more weird wardrobe. A Dickies jumpsuit isn't going to look too out of place with New Balances or something, but a full leather Rick jumpsuit will.  Regarding your last comment, I think generalized cultural acceptability still plays a large role in the 'weirdness' of certain garments, almost like a macro-trend. High heels were present in menswear half a millennium ago and were ""easily"" pulled off in that realm, doesn't mean it's not weird as shit today."
malefashion,3dwrg8,timmmmmay,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:58:55 2015 UTC,"pardon my phrasing, i completely understand that. acceptability of the ""strange"" or ""weird"" is totally subjective to the wearer, the viewer, and the time the garment is being worn. deviance from social acceptability will always garner looks.   but i guess with something like this, as any other trend begins, is how to effectively strike that balance between pushing the limits and inching towards something that become acceptable, if that makes sense."

But then people try to go out of their way to come up with something ""original"" (or try wearing pieces in ways that the designer didn't come up with/intend to; for example geos in ""normal"" streetwear fits), and they will almost always get ripped apart (You're not supposed to wear Rick like that!!1!).   I think it's good to first emulate how it's supposed to be worn, and then branch out and start experimenting later (consider it like training wheels if you will). Sure it's not ground breaking to directly copy an ad campaign, but it's a double standard imo.   You can't expect every fit to be on the cutting edge of fashion, or to blow you away with originality."

malefashion,3dmxgj,UrbanApollo,6,Fri Jul 17 19:31:25 2015 UTC,the permanent collection is hardly gaudy at all which is presumably the collection that heidi wants to exude from his brand. The other stuff is trying something new/different to not make it look like the same shit every time.

malefashion,3dmxgj,EJ-ericjackson,3,Sat Jul 18 22:39:27 2015 UTC,"but it's so lame and boring now, it's all far too contemporary, Yves was a flashy guy, and I just don't think Hedi Slimane is really doing his legacy justice, nor did I like him when he was working for Dior. personal preference   Hedi should just go make his own fucking label already,"
malefashion,3dmxgj,UrbanApollo,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:23:31 2015 UTC,"I'm probably biased because I am a large fan of Hedi Slimane. I think he's brilliant in changing YSL to SLP to better suit today's demographic. I may be wrong in saying this, but I feel under Hedi they have really switched more towards menswear over women's wear which really separates them from Yves time; that being said they wouldn't have hired Hedi if they didn't believe in him or his work."
malefashion,3dmxgj,EJ-ericjackson,3,Sun Jul 19 18:31:41 2015 UTC,"Don't get me wrong, I think Hedi does good work, it's just not for me.  I like to see old Houses have creative directors that preserve the spirit of the patron designer, to me its a mater of respect.  I feel like coming into an already world renowned house with en established Past, look, and history that at that point has honestly become a classic (like Dior, Yves St Laurent, etc) and re-inventing it, yes, is a good business decision, but it almost vandalizes the past legacy.   If I was Hedi, I would just start my own house, he is good enough to do that so why he doesn't I have no idea.  I was hoping that was what he was going to do when he left Dior, but I guess he just has a few more years of vandalism and being a leech on the belly of a past legacy before he does that."
malefashion,3dmxgj,BerriesNCreme,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:40:46 2015 UTC,I guess it really comes down to popular opinion when a creative director changes the direction of a fashion house. If people didn't like it it wouldn't sell.

But I've always been an advocate for principles over profit, so I guess I'm bias in that sense.   People like crack, meth, crocks and cigarettes too, they sell really well as well, a lot of people like them, but should you sell them? the age old argument of principles vs profit rages on."

I think the boots look good but like hugandwug I really think a different pairing might look better. I'm possibly ingrained due to harnden only making derby type shoes.

malefashion,3dgtmk,SquirlyBiscuits,16,Thu Jul 16 10:50:54 2015 UTC,i think this outfit fits this person's personality. slightly awkward (aka that posture) slightly quirky but still has refined taste aka the y-3s. but still has an eye and knowledge on how colors and fits should go. maybe it's the life style or culture of individuals he surrounds himself with that influence his choice in clothing and style. It could be a combination. It could be his confidence too. Also a lot of what he's wearing falls in the right spots on his body. if i'm off base please correct.

That plus some p severe trichotillomania makes it harder for me to style when it's not cut short, but the aforementioned trichotillomania (chronic hair pulling, it's a compulsion) also makes it look sparse when it's short, so right now I'm trying to grow it into something like the Harry Styles manbun. Currently I'm happy w/ it but it requires a lot of barrettes.   Edit: not sure if that was the intended direction of discussion tbh.

Randomly wandered into a store called VFILES and they actually stocked Craig green which I actually didn't know existed outside of Tumblr,  and the shit is actually insanely wearable.

malefashion,3de73u,Callusing,2,Sat Jul 18 21:51:50 2015 UTC,"Looking for thoughts on suits.    I've got say, $800 to drop on a suit. (not including tailoring, which I'm figuring will run another $200 or less) I want something boardroom-quality, but still very contemporary (light shoulders, slim-as-possible cut, small lapels, yadda yadda). The way I see it, I've got two options:     Get something from SuitSupply's red line. Maybe the Sienna. That's the easy option...no thinking, no searching, and what looks like great quality. See what $800 can get me on the used/discount market. I've spotted a couple within the price range already from Jil, Margiela, and a couple RLBL's. Not saying I want to jump on these in particular, but they seem to be indicative that there's high-end stuff available at this pricepoint.   Which path do you think will get me a better suit?"
malefashion,3de73u,CheerUpBrokeBoy,7,Wed Jul 15 18:24:53 2015 UTC,"go for designer stuff on used/discount  it'll probably be more interesting of a suit, the fabric will be better and because suits are usually only worn on formal occasions there will likely be no issues with condition on used suits"

And you make a great point regarding the condition...I'm in SoCal, so I only need a suit once in a blue moon, but I want a showstopper for when that time comes.

malefashion,3de73u,truthfulie,1 point,Fri Jul 17 09:40:07 2015 UTC,What kind of occasion are you buying the suit for? Designer options are going to be interesting but it may not be suitable for the occasion. Also designer suits don't always offer a good 'bang for the buck' in terms of tailoring standards.
malefashion,3de73u,Callusing,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:10:41 2015 UTC,"High-end business. I want to be able to sit in a room with a bunch of execs and look like I belong. I'm OK with being a little fashion-forward when it comes to styling, since I'm young enough to make it work.    That said, part of the reason I want to drop so much on one suit is because I want one killer suit, instead of a couple decent suits. I've gone the previous route before, and it leaves me feeling less than my best at the times I need to be at my absolute peak."
malefashion,3de73u,truthfulie,2,Thu Jul 16 23:22:14 2015 UTC,"Regardless of your age, I think looking professional should be the primary goal here. A lot of executives, if they are not involved in fashion industry, will not understand designers suits and may not take you seriously. Find a slim tailored suit that fit you well but don't go too skinny or go for suits like Margiela you've linked. Darted front seem interesting to us who follow fashion, but would be a sore sight in a business meeting.  As for the price of the suit, $800 isn't a lot to drop on a suit to be honest. If you really want one killer suit, you may have to invest much more. $800 will get you a decent suit though. If you are serious about the suit game, going made to measure will get you better fitting suit than any you will find off the rack."
malefashion,3de73u,Callusing,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:53:51 2015 UTC,"All valid points, and I'll keep them in mind. Thanks for your input.    Your point about styling is spot-on. I'm absolutely not trying to make a statement...no big details, no weird colors, nothing like that. I'm definitely hoping to err slim, simply because that's what looks best on my build. But I'll make sure to do a little gut-check before I buy anything so I don't go too far.    And as for the price...I know you're right. I've built my entire wardrobe so far with used and sale stuff, and it's allowed me to punch far above my weight. I think I'm still 5 years away from really investing in a suit for the long haul, but I'm hoping I can find something that makes me feel great in the meantime."

malefashion,3db9uv,okreddit545,36,Tue Jul 14 22:56:20 2015 UTC,"I find the pants in the first too structured. They look like some kind of thick, textured cotton (cold dyed?) which doesn't go particularly well with the intended flowiness of the shirt, especially with how rigidly it seems to sit . I think a light jacket of a similar material would help, or pants of a softer material. Shoes are similarly soft,  so maybe a pair of light ankle length pants that aren't too baggy would be good -- no jeans. Color tones are nice but the progression from light dust to dark gray to black is a bit bottom heavy, a darker outer layer or even a black scarf or hat or some shit would help. Or a dark drape tee with a light underlayer to break things up.   Tee in second one seems to fit funny, tapered waist and baggy hem looks odd. Not gonna lie, proportions straight up suck -- shoes overpower everything else way too much and the length of the pants accentuates your calves in an unflattering way. I'm less sure about what would look good here, but the easy answer is something similar to pods -- long shorts with a longer inseam. Not a fan of the color on the geobaskets."

malefashion,3db9uv,timmmmmay,1 point,Thu Jul 16 02:29:24 2015 UTC,"yeah, the shorts are a lot thicker - I think the still photography makes them look a little stiffer than they are, maybe a gif of them in motion would've been better. the shirt I think is just sitting like that because my hand's in my pocket. I can definitely buy that the shirt/shoes have a ""softer"" look to them than the shorts though, and the black at the bottom is probably too deep of a black for the rest of the fit. I can't reasonably add a jacket, etc. because it's 90+ every day here right now, but the tee layering might work. that's something I haven't experimented with yet.  I'm really falling out of love with the WvG tee tbh. I've worn it a ton but I've come to realize that it interacts really badly with almost any bottoms around the waist. the fabric is so thin and drapey that it almost constantly shows the outline of your pants waist. or in this case, the drawstring of your shorts. fit in the shoulders isn't great either. you're right about the proportions, too -- I think I kinda fell into ""these shorts are new and I just want to wear them"" mode. this was actually my first time wearing these, so I didn't quite realize how badly they'd be dwarfed by the geos, haha. colorway isn't for everyone, but it looks a little better when the picture's less overexposed -- the gum sole looks almost silver here, I don't like it either. but thank you for all the thoughtful criticism and suggestions, it is really helpful :)"

malefashion,3db9uv,EJ-ericjackson,1 point,Wed Jul 15 03:04:21 2015 UTC,"yep, like /u/headintheclauds said, WvG = Wolf vs Goat. There's a different batch of tees on the site right now IIRC -- these are not the same as what I'm wearing (mine's a bamboo/sorona blend, and I think Mauro's changed his cuts too... hard to keep track.)  it was hard to get a decent photo of this shirt though. the fabric is so thin and drapey that it practically hugs the outline of your pants waist -- so if you wear it over denim, expect to see awkward creasing around where the shirt hits the top of your waistband -- even in this pic, if you look close, you can see that one of the bottom creases is actually from the knot of the drawstring. this isn't a problem exclusive to WvG tees, but I own a few and I've noticed it a lot with them."

malefashion,3cxx3l,Solacee,3,Sun Jul 12 01:10:14 2015 UTC,I fully agree with that assessment. At least for myself I use tumblr more for appreciating archival runway shots and editorials than contemporary trends.

Fit 2 looks fair, but the color of the jacket looks too vibrant compared to the rest of it. The hoodie doesn't compliment it either.  Fit 4 the whole thing just looks cluttered in my opinion. The colors are spread and too many to be able to compliment each other.  Fit 5-6 lose a lot because of the jeans. If they weren't teared it would look really good, specially the color pallette and how it accents the whole style.  Fit 7 this time the jeans really work well with the sandals. The coat/thing(forgot what it's called) with the blue pattern(forgot what it's called, sorry) removes a lot from the fit. It just doesn't blend well with the bottoms, and blue is being abused in this style too."

malefashion,3cz858,jknowl3m,3,Sun Jul 12 05:34:36 2015 UTC,"thanks for the contribution, even though it is a ton of outfits. I think you have some cool style ideas, and a couple really emulate fashion forum trends. This is really visible in the tonal outfits (~palewave~) and your footwear (Tevas, Flyknits, moc-toe boots). None of that is negative though, and I own both Flyknits and Tevas because they're awesome shoes, and most people are sort of trendy. I think you should move in a more focused direction with your clothing, because it seems like right now you're trying to pull off a ton of different looks because you appreciate them all. That said, don't just move to MFA and say bye to malefashion, just browse them both and enjoy. I like fit 7 btw, despite what the other guy said"
malefashion,3cz858,BerriesNCreme,1 point,Mon Jul 13 02:35:37 2015 UTC,"I definitley need to choose a specific style for my wardrobe. At the moment, 90% of my clothes are hand me downs or thrifted.

malefashion,3cz858,SGTxARTEAGA,2,Mon Jul 13 03:02:32 2015 UTC,"I understand the thought process of suggesting that you focus your style, but for the sake of playing devils advocate I suggest that you keep it varied.   When you focus your style, all of your purchases typically work with each other, they're interchangeable and makes for efficient spending of your money. This is obviously an upside, but the downside is that more often than not you begin to emulate the thousands of other people who subscribe to that style.   Now I am aware that very few people in this world are truly individual with their style, however, if you want to push the boundaries, experiment and step outside the box, you need to have pieces from a number of styles because it is only then that you can start putting together some uncommon combinations.   Both views come with their ups and downs, only you can decide which one you would like to pursue based on your style goals. Yet as a guy who comes to this sub for inspiration, I would rather see you keep it varied, fail completely 10 times and then just nail that one new outfit that I hadn't thought to put together.   Just my two cents, keep on keeping on bud."

The lighting in the pic is bad. The camera that took this pic is bad. You at least trim your facial hair. The outfit makes you look like a little kid because everything fits awkwardly.

malefashion,3cqtge,burgundyalex,27,Fri Jul 10 01:05:37 2015 UTC,Pretty sure Vivienne Westwood was the first (or one of the first) to reference this with her work for Seditionaries (shop where the sex pistols were formed).  She did a lot of straight jacket stuff/stuff with straps on it. It was all about being shocking and offensive.   Just google Vivienne Westwood Seditionaries or Vivienne Westwood Malcolm McClaren there's loads of info out there about it.
malefashion,3cqtge,heck3,115,Fri Jul 10 01:28:11 2015 UTC,"You can really go back to the mid or late 60's with this. Andy Warhol's Factory/Exploding Plastic Inevitable and the Velvet Underground sort of pioneered the whole marriage between bondage and rock that came to dominate punk. They had dancers in leather with whips and chains, etc. Because this was so important to the NYC art scene, you had the next generation (or first, if you will) of punk kind of going on with it. Richard Hell notably being the inspiration behind most of the Westwood stuff.   But it's also kind of bullshit to try to find the genesis. McClaren was copying Richard Hell's style, but the New York Dolls predated Richard Hell and were shopped around by McClaren. But they were only occasionally in leather/bondage/drag. And it's not like they started it, right? There was a look that hustlers/rent boys had back in the 60's/early 70's.   So yeah, you have different groups (prostitutes, artists) with different and sometimes intersecting histories sort of doing similar things before it reached England, but I'd guess that it's not like England didn't have this before 70's either. And I think it'd be really cool to look at how sex in clothing and the artsy crowd mingled in the pre-War era. I don't remember the Man Ray photos but I could have sworn he took a lot of risque shots.  Only mention this because attributing the look to Westwood isn't really accurate and it's not like she was a ""designer"" then either, or at least not any more than the people preceding her."

malefashion,3cr16x,frenchfrieskl,7,Sun Jul 12 18:29:53 2015 UTC,"If we are going to use labels then I would call that look prep goth more so then street goth. Street goth seems to be more street wear with high end labels and primarily black garments with an emphasis on drape and unique cuts like s pop necks with side slots of destroyed biker denim.   Prep goth seems to be more about  black cropped trousers or slim fitting black denim and black boots or chunky derbies, a nice white OCBD and a black wool coat of other high end black over coat of some kind.   This is all just what I would assume the look would be based off of your pic and I don't have much to offer for inspiration pics but I'm sure you could look at the top of waywt for the past few months and find some fits that work with that particular look you are going for."

malefashion,3cr16x,GreatLordYeezus,1 point,Fri Jul 10 10:04:58 2015 UTC,Well if you wanted to modernize that style then I would look at copping some longer oxfords and possibly cropped trousers with a drop crotch to even out your proportions. A preacher hat could work as well but you have to definitely be comfortable in your own skin to pull that off. Just think of Rick Owens style of drape and elongated proportions but apply that to a more preppy and classical style.
malefashion,3cr16x,vetement_pour_homme,1 point,Fri Jul 10 05:50:12 2015 UTC,I'm not really going for the drape sort of thing. I guess the basis off the style I'm going for is just like black skinny trousers and black sweaters and mixing it up with oxfords I'd really just try to see an inspo album if one existed but im working on one myself.

malefashion,3cotr2,sausagesizzle,4,Fri Jul 10 15:08:25 2015 UTC,Food for thought - how is someone going around in silk and furs in the 20s that different from someone going around in something like full Rick now?

malefashion,3cotr2,EJ-ericjackson,2,Fri Jul 10 03:07:42 2015 UTC,"I think what matters most in fashion, to me at least regarding ""good vs bad"" is thought.  Something that is well thought out, tends to be well designed and put together, so it is subjective in a way, in the same way any art is, different looks attract different thought patterns and personalities.   thats not to say ""nothing is bad"" cuz trust me, there is some cringy bad shit out there, but I think fashion is generally ruled by ""what is the dominate personality"" at that given time.  as far as things in fashion being rules, its just a reflection of culture as a whole, at any given point, people make an unspoken concessions about what is ok and not ok, what is ok to eat, drink, wear, read, watch, etc.  and you have a choice of following these social norms or going your own way."

malefashion,3cnbnm,MRSIII,0,Fri Jul 10 00:40:14 2015 UTC,"Imo qasas never really look right with jeans. He was asking you a question which I simplified, why are you wearing those shoes with the rest of the outfit?"
malefashion,3cnbnm,gingerbeast124,7,Fri Jul 10 00:53:19 2015 UTC,"Because I had to walk a lot that day, and Qasa are comfortable and they dont look that bad?"

malefashion,3coyc6,easysnipes,3,Thu Jul 9 23:41:39 2015 UTC,"A higher quality tee would work better here. Maybe an APC white scoop neck. If you don't want to spend loot, then look at void the brand or one of the low tier brands that urban outfitters sell. Feathers is one of the brands that comes to mind. The quality control is hit or miss but they go for like $20-25 a tee so it's not that big of an investment.  Pretty much you need a shirt that won't flare so much at the arms and possibly something with a little more drape. Like your bottom half is on point but the top half is severely lacking and ruins the fit imo.  If you're struggling with figuring out what kind of tee to wear then you might be better suited asking the folks at /r/mfa. They are more friendly when it comes to asking questions and you most likely won't get body slammed for asking for advice like tee shirt selection."

malefashion,3cje3a,timmmmmay,8,Wed Jul 8 18:49:35 2015 UTC,"OK wait, let me get this straight. You criticize him, he says ""thanks but I disagree"" you say ""no, you're not  allowed to disagree with me"" and he's the one with a problem? Ok...."
malefashion,3cje3a,WheelchairEpidemic,-4,Wed Jul 8 19:53:12 2015 UTC,"i didn't say that. i said to give more feedback. i criticized him, i was expecting him to explain himself. explain his thought process, what he was going for, what the context of the fit was, WHAT HE WAS TRYING TO DO! i didn't even ask he just replied and said ""nah i think its fine"". define ""Fine"". why did this look appeal to you, what do you get out of it when you look at yourself in the mirror?  thats the real question. im not bullying some user. im young i want a response, i want him to reply with a definite answer and not a bullshit response where he doesn't elaborate on the fit itself. at some point in this thread i think OP took the comment as an attack on him. its not about him. its about fashion. can we please keep it that way?"
malefashion,3cje3a,WheelchairEpidemic,2,Thu Jul 9 01:04:26 2015 UTC,"Have you considered the fact that you may be the one in the wrong? Another vote for it looking fine and the too tight crowd is in the minority, I think this is one of the better fits posted here in recent memory. Just because someone rejects criticism doesn't mean he's overly defensive, the criticism might just not hold water"
malefashion,3cje3a,timmmmmay,8,Thu Jul 9 01:17:09 2015 UTC,"The poor way in which you handled some relatively mild criticism in an online discussion forum doesn't really help the ""I'm not insecure"" argument."

malefashion,3cjjsh,DatSkinnyMuthaFucka,3,Wed Jul 8 22:08:40 2015 UTC,"Lemaire seems to be quite unknown at this point, and especially to hypebeasts. As the other guy said though, access to a style people wouldnt likely be able to afford otherwise will probably mean there are more eyes on this one. Also with things like minimalist overcoats being in this collection and heavily coveted in all types of styles at the moment, probably mean it gets more interest."
malefashion,3cjjsh,generalwarlord,3,Wed Jul 8 22:26:23 2015 UTC,Basically any collaboration between a fast fashion company and a high end designer is going to be hyped because it allows people to have access to a style they likely wouldn't be able to afford.

A lot of the boxy outerwear just straight up sucked. Look 13, what the fuck? 34? The deep pinks (though the very light pinks were nice). Loved the deep red in look 11 though.

malefashion,3cbbfo,easysnipes,1 point,Tue Jul 7 23:46:32 2015 UTC,They look like they fit well. I bought mine off grailed and wish I would had sized down from a 12 to an 11 since they're so wide. If they don't feel too wide in the feet then I think you'll be straight. The fun part is building a wardrobe around the Ramones.
malefashion,3cbbfo,Clean_n_Proper,1 point,Wed Jul 8 02:38:34 2015 UTC,I need a pair of non skinny jeans to make them work. The pair I'm wearing seem to accentuate how large these shoes are.
malefashion,3cbbfo,easysnipes,1 point,Wed Jul 8 04:33:59 2015 UTC,I bought some Zanerobe black joggers and those look great with my Ramones. They have a slight drop crotch so I can wear long drapey tees or long oversized sweaters with them as well. I'm sure you are familiar with how to achieve the Rick aesthetic but don't feel like you need to drop several hundred on pants and a tee when you can achieve that with some lower price point alternatives.
malefashion,3cbbfo,Clean_n_Proper,1 point,Wed Jul 8 04:47:35 2015 UTC,"Thanks, I already got 3 rick tees that I think will go with the ramones, but just looking for a decent pair of pants I'll check out the zanerobes."

malefashion,3c4viu,yankeeclip,7,Wed Jul 8 18:54:04 2015 UTC,"Collection  I'm terrible at throwing away old shoes, so this represents stuff I've had since the beginning of college.  Upper row from left  1 - Converse x UNDFTD: one of my first footwear purchases almost six years ago, back when I thought UNDFTD and streetwear was the coolest shit ever. The inside is orange to match the classic lining of flight jackets, and the outside is a padded nylon. Also, all the branding patches are actually velcro patched and removable (I believe there were UNDFTD branded patches you could switch with, but I think I lost those really quickly). These are one of the most surprisingly durable shoes I've owned. After I stopped wearing as much streetwear type clothes, these were relegated to being shoes for dance practice. Breakdancing shreds footwear, but there's no structural damage on these even after years. These shoes are part of the reason why I swear by Converse collabs as the best budget sneakers ever. I think in total I've owned five collabs and have been extremely satisfied with all of them.  2 - Visvim 73 hole: I think I've said enough about these already. This is the type of boot you get if you want to feel fucking invincible. I don't think boots should be babied, and as a result the uppers are more than a big dinged up, but every crease and scratch just makes them look more amazing to me. I honestly look forwards to wearing these into leather scraps.  3 - Rider Boot derbies: I don't particularly care about formal wear so I'll be brief. Got these for the rare days of work and graduate school where a bit more formality is required. Because I wanted something that wasn't entirely conservative, I opted for a chisel toe instead of a rounder toe.  4 - ??? monkstraps: I bought these back in junior year of college when the internet tricked me into thinking monkstraps were the best thing ever. Wore these for years to internships and interviews and fucking hated them. Ass leather, fake leather sole, hilariously fake sole stitching, pretty much the whole nine yards of cheap dress shoes. I got the derbies described above as a replacement to these and was about to throw these out, but realized that after being roughly worn and not really cared for for years, they actually looked pretty good beaten up. So I occasionally wear these casually now.  **Bottom row from left  1 - Some Nike running shoes: I wear these to run. Moving on.  2 - Soloist x Foot the coacher shoes: Upon receiving these in the mail, I instantly listed both pairs of my Converse x N(N) on Grailed. They are seriously that goddamn amazing. While the Odessas are still fantastic shoes, it seems to me that Miyashita was really able to fulfill his creative vision with these without needing to worry about the limitations of working with Converse (price point, materials, etc.). Similar to the Converse, the outers are deerskin leather, but this model has a much more luxurious nubuck feel. Overall, the detailing is insane: metal shoelace caps, unfinished leather fringes on the panels similar to Soloist leather jackets, fully leather lined on the inside, and T.M. initials stitched into the sides. As a final plus, they're vibram soled. They're incredibly hard to find in larger sizes, but I'm definitely doubling down on these if I can find another in my size. Also, this isn't the asymmetrical lace model, but those seem to run about triple the price of these on the resale market. I don't buy many ""luxury"" sneakers, but I can easily, EASILY say these are the nicest sneakers I've ever seen.  3 - New Balance: I wear these to hike and stuff. They feel goddamn invincible as well.   4 - Yuketen ripple sole derbies: I'm a bit ambivalent on these. On the one hand, they look really cool, are a beautiful shade of blue, are very well constructed, and are very comfortable... as long as I'm standing still. I don't think my foot is the right shape for the last used here, as they feel like they're falling off my foot as I'm walking around. Walking around on the ripple sole has been quite interesting, it feels so normal you eventually forget about it, but sometimes when walking on brick or cobblestone roads they can get slightly stuck."
malefashion,3c4viu,Callusing,2,Sat Jul 4 21:02:37 2015 UTC,"The visvims are fucking fantastic. I wish they made more boots with black soles...I love the uppers nine times out of ten, but I'm not as big a fan of the vibram wedges."

malefashion,3c4viu,HugAndWug,1 point,Sat Jul 4 21:22:58 2015 UTC,Yep there's a black one that looks pretty cool as well. I'd just recommend trying them on if you can at all because they definitely don't fit like traditional shoes imo.

malefashion,3c4viu,HugAndWug,2,Sat Jul 4 22:56:05 2015 UTC,a little tight because i have wide feet.   i'm actually putting up a write up on harnden whenever i get around to adding a topy to mine but overall really good shoes. comparable to their price point and the aesthetic honestly isnt matched. i have no idea what their boots are like but the oxfords that ive experienced have all been good.

malefashion,3c4viu,Callusing,1 point,Mon Jul 6 05:26:20 2015 UTC,Those wedges are absolutely crazy.
malefashion,3c4viu,Callusing,4,Mon Jul 20 21:49:51 2015 UTC,"Alright, I'll bite. I've been going through a huge shoe liquidation recently (which is still ongoing), and this is what's left. I really do not like low-tops. My photos suck, so I linked to pro-shots of every shoe.      First pic John Varvatos Mac - My first high-end sneaker purchase, and still one of my favorites. They look like Multilace-lites, they're thick as hell, and the bulky sole works really well. I think Varvatos's footwear is very underrated in general...it's overpriced at retail, but it always sells at fire-sale prices at the end of the season and on the used market, and his stuff often brings a lot of concepts from streetgoth-style designers into a form that is a lot more approachable and versatile. Puma x Hussein Chalayan Gravity High -I don't wear these guys enough. Puma and Chalayan collaborated for a few years in the early 2010s, and the results were always interesting, though these are my favorite. The matte grey works with everything, as does the shape...basically, they're halfway between techwear and grey boots. AJ1 Premiers - One of only a few pairs of Jordans I've ever been interested in, because the quality on these is a notch above most. Comfy, and I don't need to baby them, and they hold down the ""red shoes"" part of my wardrobe. Seavees Boondocker - The leather on these is thin and cheap. The sole is basically flip-flop material. But they look damn good, they're ridiculously comfy, and they've worn in well. These are boots that wear like sneakers, and in that context, I love them. Also, they were like $50 shipped. Fake rafs - Decent quality fakes from back when I spent more time on frugalmalefashion and convinced myself that the quality was about the same as the real deal. Which it surprisingly is. I might turn these into a project at some point. Feit Biotrainers - You know how they say your best suit is the one you wear the least? These are my best sneakers, at least until I got the Ann D's, and they're certainly the ones I wear the least. I've had these for almost a year, and I've only worn them twice, but I can't bring myself to sell them. They're truly unique. One downside, though, is that they stain incredibly easily, and the leather feels very thin and fragile. Centre Commercial Pantal Suede Boots - Real nice suede, and I fuck with creeper soles. These are perfect business-casual boots...anytime I need to cut the all black look and go to something where I need to look more yuppieish, these are my go-to. I think they're just the right balance of rugged and formal. Vans x Taka Hayashi Sk8 Hi - I like a lot of Taka's work, and his stuff with Vans was instrumental in me becoming more comfortable with less conventional footwear designs. I love these because the overall shape is relatively conventional, but every detail is the opposite of that...wraparound lace holders (which you usually only see in high-end stuff), contrast leather panels, a leather-wrapped sole...these things are designed like high-end sneakers, and Vans does an admirable job with materials and construction.    Second pic  Ralph Lauren Macomb - The newest member of the family. I hear boots described as ""built like tanks"" a lot, but these just about take the cake. Thick, heavy, and with a subtle pebble grain that I didn't like at first, but that's grown on me quickly. These double as dress boots for me.  Hella old W+H High tops - These are from some old season (the ones in the pic are 08...these are from around then, but not quite), and were my favorite sneakers for a long time. The leather quality is as good as you could ask for, and W+H's high top silhouette is still my favorite of all the options out there. If they went on sale more often, I'd probably have a pair of these in 3 or 4 different colors.  Palladium Palabrouse - Cheap beaters. But damn well-made and good-looking cheap beaters. Palladium's canvas is tougher than any other fabric I've encountered on sneakers, and despite regular wear, these things would look as good as new with a scrub. And if you're down with the military look, these fit the bill just as well as a lot of more expensive stuff.  Converse x Hideout Chucks - My most-worn pair. The guy I bought these from described them as ""the last pair of black high-tops you'll ever need to buy"", and he wasn't joking. These had the 1970s sole on them before Converse was doing that regularly (which I think looks SO much better than the thinner new sole), and they're just legit. They work with everything. They brush off everything. They've been everywhere. They're one of the cheapest pairs of shoes I've got, but they might be my favorite. Ann D Sidezips - The buckled sky-high version, though I always wear them without the buckles. I was intimidated by the height when I bought them (though I got an absurd price on these), but I usually just wear them with my jeans cuffed high, and it works perfectly. The quality on these is just as ridiculous as you'd expect from $1000 sneakers...a lot of my other stuff is subtly high-end, but these look killer from half a room away. These actually impressed me so much that they convinced me to cut down on the sneaker purchases and switch to boots...I just feel like I'm not gonna do much better than these.   Public School High Tops - Got these last season, before these were called ""Braeburns."" I still think these are the single best-designed sneaker of the last few years. They look incredible on feet. Not much else to be said.   Two pairs of old Oliberte boots - These have decent leather, I like the height, and the styles are interesting. (One is a Domo, one is a Tompa). They fit my wardrobe better when I was more into mfa / workwear stuff, but they're still very interesting, and still look great in the right fits.    Third pic Three pairs of Varvatos x Converse Weapons - If you're into the used market, Varvatos x Converse is one of the best value buys out there. I probably paid under $200 total for all three of these, and they're made with leather that rivals designer sneakers, and just look dope in every fit. They've held up extremely well through a lot of wear, too. These are my ""nice beaters"" - something I can throw on anytime I'm not totally slumming, but don't have to take care of. And they've been so good in that role that I might get a couple more colorways yet. The black ones are my second most-worn shoes, after the Converse Hideouts."
malefashion,3c4viu,easysnipes,2,Sun Jul 5 03:13:31 2015 UTC,"Those RL boots are intense. Not gonna lie, I don't see the appeal of the FEITs at all. They just look like wholecuts with sneaker laces and an orthopedic sole to me. Narrow toebox and bulbous sole is a no-go for me."
malefashion,3c4viu,EJ-ericjackson,1 point,Sun Jul 5 14:53:53 2015 UTC,"The RL boots almost shocked me. They've got the thickest leather I think I've ever seen on a shoe. They're pretty uncomfortable and make all kinds of weird noises right now (when they're brand new), but I'm sure they'll be wonderful once they're broken in.    As for the Feits, they look a bit better on feet (that's a newer, similar model), but I've definitely gone back and forth on them. There's a bit of nostalgia involved...I was psyched back when I got these...and a bit of hipster pride just because they're so unique. And I do love the heel counter. But if I were smart, I'd recognize that I could probably sell them for almost $200, and put that toward something I wore way more often. One of these days, I might get smart.    In retrospect, I do wish I'd gotten handsewns instead of Biotrainers. They were about the same price back when I bought these, and I think the handsewns are simultaneously more interesting and more versatile.    The leather is seriously flimsy-feeling, though. I'm sure it's objectively high-quality, but it's apparent why you don't see a whole lot of unstructured suede footwear."

Really liked some looks from Damir Doma and tried really hard to like the whole collection but most of it was just so boring. Haider Ackermann's striped stuff was really cool as always, I'm always a fan of how he mixes patterns. Thom Browne was a positive for sure but didn't 100% blow me away. Don't know much about Craig Green and wooyoungmi but they struck similar chords for me, pretty good stuff. Many of Dior's looks struck me as similar to Junya from 5-10 years ago, but more tightly tailored. Hated Gosha.  Don't think the Japanese designers were on their A game this season. Was disappointed by White Mountaineering, Sacai, Facetasm, and what I've seen so far from SoloIst. Liked Junya but I think it's just more of the same, nothing really stood out to me as incredible and I'm not a huge fan of the tan. Actually really liked OAMC. Undercover is Undercover."

We're a relatively small community largely comprised of users from other fashion boards, so going dark in protest of politics exclusive to reddit would alienate all the users who really are only here for /r/malefashion. The pull we have a sub is somewhat limited at this size. I know that doesn't seem like a valid reason to not join the protest to some, but what does /r/malefashion even have in common with the subs that are protesting? Even arguing to do it as a move of solidarity shows relatively little understanding of what the issue is. To my knowledge, the /r/malefashion moderation team hasn't had any issues with admins affecting their ability to moderate the sub content. This protest of going private is protesting the effect that reddit's admins are having on the ability of moderators to regulate their subs. As far as I know, that doesn't concern us.

malefashion,3bzbql,JstnJ,46,Fri Jul 3 12:25:42 2015 UTC,"The point isn't that she got fired. That's the shallow reason. It's perfectly possible that she was let go with cause, but if you look past the circle jerk to the complaints of the mods who initiated the whole ""darkening"" thing, it's not the firing that's the problem.  The reason it's important is that reddit relies on (essentially) volunteers to manage all of the content on the site, and these volunteers go to pretty great lengths to make reddit as successful as it is, such as by putting a lot of time and effort into bringing relevant AMAs to their communities. Those AMAs relied on Victoria as a liaison to reddit. By getting rid of her suddenly and without giving any back-up help or alternatives to mods, they hung many hours of people's work in limbo.  Whether subreddits decide to close or not is up to their mods and communities, but to make this out to be about personnel decisions rather than the substantial fuck you to some of the communities biggest contributors is unfair."

I heard one (I think it was L'Emulier or something?) that sells CCP, Rick, bbs, undercover etc. my boss is going to give me my monthly paycheck and quarterly bonus early for the trip because he is awesome so if I see some drips there that I like I think I maaaay have to cop. Or a blazer, specifically one that has like 5+ buttons is a certain style that I am having trouble thinking of a description of...but it would look very AnnD, LUC, or Paul Harden-ish in a light fabric. Then I will be taking a train, and getting picked up by my parents who have driven from Copenhagen to Bordeaux, France to attend my brothers wedding at some sweet chateau for a few days. I will then head to Brussels and Amsterdam, and while in one of those two cities I can't remember I will have to try and find any shops, if not the flagship store for Jan Jan Van Essche. Then it's off to Copenhagen to revisit the city I lived in 2 years ago.  I am also waiting on a pair of black horse leather guidi 988 backzips to come in the mail next week. I can't even explain how excited I am to FINALLY HAVE FOUND A PAIR IN MY SIZE!!! WAHOOOOOOOOO!!!"

malefashion,3byb4x,lovetosaydada,6,Fri Jul 3 06:52:00 2015 UTC,"I think it would look better if there was less wrap. Basically the shape of the wrap is not flattering your head. I don't know, but I'm guessing you don't have so much hair to need it that high. This looks pretty good (couldn't find a front on). Over the hair and once around. Or maybe this like a Brett Michaels w/ a wrap instead of a bandana."
malefashion,3byb4x,LenientWhale,3,Fri Jul 3 04:48:44 2015 UTC,"Yeah I think there should be less or more wrap, the bit hanging near your neck makes it look a bit awkward to me. It'd be cooler if it was longer maybe for some vibes like Kanye's Mercy music video"

I would just make sure it stays separate of your shirt (ie not touching your neck) and just follow your natural head shape. I like the look of the hair coming out the back too, and it'll help to differentiate yourself from the religious reasons to wrap."

malefashion,3bs2j1,rafsimonsdickowens,2,Thu Jul 2 13:12:22 2015 UTC,"Well, I don't think I'd go that far. His jawline and his top makes it look athletic. I agree with craymond in that a hem at a shorter length would be better than the cuff, simply because the cuff breaks the otherwise clean, athletic lines of the rest of the look. It's a well proportioned, monochrome look that looks comfortable without being Rick. It's also not the monochrome draped linen look. It's sufficiently different from what I've seen on this sub in the past month that makes it interesting for me. I also think that the small black socks are actually smart, because it continues from up top, reducing the contrast between his clothes and shoes. I really like it."
malefashion,3bs2j1,jrlpauig,3,Thu Jul 2 13:35:38 2015 UTC,Looks good.  And your short hair and clean-shaveness works well with all the minimalism.    Only thing... the all black makes it seem like it would be pretty hot on such a sunny day.

The crazy boxiness of the shirt looks bad the way you have it.  The shorts could be alright, but you're wearing them way too high; optimally the hem would be a few inches below the knee. Refer to the picture I included in my comment yesterday to get a feel for where they're designed to sit. Alternatively, this picture of /u/thisistheodore shows how low they should sit for the look you're going for (I know that picture isn't what you're going for, but the shorts are styled the same).

malefashion,3bx0gj,fistomatic,1 point,Thu Jul 2 21:24:39 2015 UTC,"It could also just be the angle of the shot throwing the proportions off. Just looking at it again though, it seems like the pods are high for this sort of Rick look, and if they hung lower on your legs it might balance out the shoes.

malefashion,3bsapu,philmyshoes,10,Wed Jul 1 19:11:47 2015 UTC,"I'm not feeling the sandals for this fit, I think they'd work better with the ""socks and sandals"" look that's been getting attention lately. I'm not sure what footwear would work, but I think maybe some kind of bigger shoe like crust dunks or geos paired with thick socks would fit the look it looks like you're going for, like this. Regarding the shorts, I don't think a dark layer under a gray layer works very well here, at least on legs. Perhaps in a vastly different fit the leg layering would work better. And finally, the shirt looks like it doesn't fit very well; oversized is fine, but with this particular shirt I feel as though in the size you have it, it would look better as a lower layer under another shirt.  All in all, I think every part of this could look very good in a different outfit, but together it doesn't work very well in my opinion."

malefashion,3bi9l7,Broadkast,4,Mon Jun 29 14:55:45 2015 UTC,"Yeah that's what I was thinking, it's the same silhouette and pieces on each outfit (different button patterns and suit styles, sure), just with different (albeit amazing) patterns.  I liked the overall idea, but the execution could have been a bit more broad."
malefashion,3bi9l7,Major_Tom42,6,Mon Jun 29 15:17:39 2015 UTC,"I was about to call this one of his most conservative runway shows to date, but then I got to the last few ones.  Even then, it's definitely not as wonderfully batshit crazy as previous years."
malefashion,3bi9l7,Aaarrrgh,2,Mon Jun 29 16:04:00 2015 UTC,"those last few really were really unexpected, i actually laughed a little"

malefashion,3bi9l7,Lord_of_the_Dance,3,Mon Jun 29 17:39:57 2015 UTC,there was a whale backpack on ebay for $150. I slept on it and someone bought it  :(
malefashion,3bi9l7,timothynguyen,3,Mon Jun 29 17:58:31 2015 UTC,"I like those with bit wider silhouettes, seems more fitting to the whole Japanese garment. And being a lover of gray, blue (and all the subdued colors in between really), I really like the patterns and patches, especially the ties. But I don't know how I feel about the full out kimono thing."
malefashion,3bi9l7,truthfulie,4,Mon Jun 29 16:20:42 2015 UTC,It would have been unbearably dull without the kimono things
malefashion,3bi9l7,Broadkast,3,Mon Jun 29 18:49:09 2015 UTC,I really love the Japanese influence here; and heres hoping the socks and geisha sandals actually becomes a thing. However I'm not as big a fan of the suits with 2+ buttons. I saw Dior had some similar styling this year and I hope this doesn't lead to early 2000s nba suits coming back
malefashion,3bi9l7,MrT-1000,1 point,Mon Jun 29 19:12:23 2015 UTC,What do you mean by 2+ buttons in relation to NBA suits? All the (barely visible under the coat) suits in the show looks like any other TB 3 button suits.
malefashion,3bi9l7,truthfulie,3,Mon Jun 29 20:05:07 2015 UTC,"Ah, the patterns may be throwing off my perception of the suits, but something like this from Dior stuck with me because it reminded me of that early 2000's suit styling although granted the fit of the pants these days is vastly superior"
malefashion,3bi9l7,MrT-1000,9,Mon Jun 29 20:13:14 2015 UTC,I think you're mistaking the overcoat for the suit jacket
malefashion,3bi9l7,thomaspaine,1 point,Mon Jun 29 21:55:29 2015 UTC,Honestly curious to see what the suit jackets look like in this season. I  think some of the looks aren't coats.
malefashion,3bi9l7,SisterRayVU,1 point,Tue Jun 30 01:55:40 2015 UTC,Oh right. I see what you are saying. Yeah I don't think we'll ever go back to that. But I think three buttons can look decent on NBA players if well fitted since they are just so damn tall. Just don't button them like that.
malefashion,3bi9l7,truthfulie,1 point,Mon Jun 29 20:18:28 2015 UTC,"Look 18 is my favorite, that's a hawaiian fish on the trousers."

malefashion,3bfh2m,Pengyster,2,Sun Jun 28 20:05:26 2015 UTC,"Totally. Actually I take that back, I'd probably wear some of that if it was in my own collection. But you should try to look at it that way, and some of the newer influences and color choices made for a really great show."
malefashion,3bfh2m,Mister_Squishy,1 point,Sun Jun 28 22:30:36 2015 UTC,Maybe a flannel here and there  i saw a video and the vibes seemed dope
malefashion,3bfh2m,Pengyster,8,Sun Jun 28 22:36:00 2015 UTC,Disturbing lack of boots!  also this guy looks undead
malefashion,3bfh2m,benj1623,3,Sun Jun 28 20:13:36 2015 UTC,"Thats James, he's one of my best friends. He was obsessed with Hedi's Slimanes Dior Homme, and I was so happy for him when Hedi approached him after a show to walk for SLP. He is a great guy and a great friend, I cannot speak highly enough about the content of his character. He deserves to be on the catwalk. He probably also was really, really hungover during the show."
malefashion,3bfh2m,WetWasteOfAGirl,20,Fri Jul 3 01:52:52 2015 UTC,"If you're disappointed or dislike this season but liked the past seasons, I have no idea where you're coming from. It's not like this is wildly different, he's just pulling from a more explicit 90's reference all around instead of the 70's with some 90's. But if you think this is boring or crap or disappointing or a let down or whatever, you should have probably thought the same about literally every other season.  Also throwing out there that I think this is less boring or crap or disappointing than previous seasons but still bad."
malefashion,3bfh2m,SisterRayVU,9,Sun Jun 28 20:17:16 2015 UTC,"I think they're comparing the runway stuff to what SLP actually sells right to consumers. Correct me if I'm wrong, but the runway shit hardly ever goes on sale in mass quantities, does it?"
malefashion,3bfh2m,doublementh,12,Sun Jun 28 20:34:46 2015 UTC,"I mean for SLP, that's not the case. I don't know if everything makes production but it's not like they put out really weird clothes. A lot of the men's stuff is carried in stores because it's not some gorgeous monstrosity that five people buy and it's not too out there like some RO.  The people who complain, presumably, are people who have praised previous shows so they're familiar with the runways and what's stocked."
malefashion,3bfh2m,SisterRayVU,2,Sun Jun 28 20:39:14 2015 UTC,"Couldn't have said it better myself. I went into an SLP store here in Chicago, and the only very obvious runway piece was a red and sliver striped blazer. It was hideous, but everything else there was the SLP I know and love. I love the look, but sometimes I wonder what trends and changes will actually graft onto what he sells; even the permanent collections.  also i wish he would get rid of those damn epaulettes"
malefashion,3bfh2m,doublementh,6,Sun Jun 28 20:45:47 2015 UTC,"I'm confused by your comment, sorry. I'm saying that most of the runway stuff hits the stores because SLP is a brand that makes clothes that can sell well to anyone. But did you like this show? Why or why not? What trends do you think Hedi cares about?"
malefashion,3bfh2m,SisterRayVU,-4,Sun Jun 28 21:19:30 2015 UTC,"Ah. Most of his are black and rockstarry; I don't see how you think this runway collection is similar to that sort of thing, is what I meant. But I also haven't seen the other runway stuff, so I dunno. I don't know what he seems to care about, honestly. Looks like the pants are a bit... flair-y. And I'm not digging it. frankly, I'm still stuck in my memecore stage. You? What do you think?"
malefashion,3bfh2m,doublementh,2,Sun Jun 28 21:49:03 2015 UTC,actually 95% of the runway pieces are available to purchase in stores and online
malefashion,3bfh2m,PanDerCakes,2,Sun Jun 28 21:31:43 2015 UTC,d'oh
malefashion,3bfh2m,doublementh,2,Sun Jun 28 21:49:14 2015 UTC,"we had that blazer in the Houston store 2, was strange material"
malefashion,3bfh2m,Discover_and_Become,8,Sun Jun 28 21:05:07 2015 UTC,"The runway pieces are definitely more limited than everything else and usually go on sale at the end. Obviously you have standout pieces every season that sell out from the runway, but ya."
malefashion,3bfh2m,plickz,2,Sun Jun 28 20:37:28 2015 UTC,"I 100% agree with this, I think it's right in the pocket and just different enough to feel interesting compared to past SLP collections. My only problems with it are maybe the lack of boots and the way throwing Cobain glasses on feels late to the party."
malefashion,3bfh2m,maps1488,1 point,Sun Jun 28 21:36:42 2015 UTC,"a guy on /fa said something interesting that was its a reactionary move by hedi away from the recent items that have become fuccboi grails (the teddy, wyatt boots etc)"
malefashion,3bfh2m,Pengyster,14,Sun Jun 28 21:16:54 2015 UTC,You mean the stuff that's part of the permanent collection? And like this won't be coveted but at a less accessible price point?. It's not like there aren't the same flannels or the callback to his popular black and white knit from the first season. The problem with someone on /fa saying that is that they actually think Hedi gives a shit about them.
malefashion,3bfh2m,SisterRayVU,1 point,Sun Jun 28 21:33:37 2015 UTC,The distressed denim particularly too. what do you think hedi gives a shit about?  this seems to be much less accessible than his other collections
malefashion,3bfh2m,Pengyster,13,Sun Jun 28 22:20:04 2015 UTC,Selling clothes. Going to parties. Cocaine.
malefashion,3bfh2m,SisterRayVU,1 point,Sun Jun 28 22:32:24 2015 UTC,hahaha   but the selling clothes thing would make one think that he'd do more of what he's been doing in the past. this is a more extreme direction (and thereby one would think less of a financial opportunity)
malefashion,3bfh2m,Pengyster,9,Sun Jun 28 22:35:20 2015 UTC,"Permanent collection is still the same, nothing is that wild, frilly little shirts on men could be cool and will sell fine, sweaters that harken back to people's grails, jackets that look luxe and expensive but are pretty easy to wear, etc. It'll sell fine. And now people can buy ""normcore slp jeans"" and have to own multiple pairs because the skinny black ones are temporarily usurped. If he just made the exact same thing every season, it'd never sell."
malefashion,3bfh2m,SisterRayVU,3,Sun Jun 28 23:13:45 2015 UTC,he sent models down the runway in serapes and cowboy hats last s/s. how is more colorful jackets less accessible?
malefashion,3bfh2m,CheerUpBrokeBoy,1 point,Sun Jun 28 22:32:35 2015 UTC,colourful jackets is wild understatement   beige and black are easy on the eye at least
malefashion,3bfh2m,Pengyster,4,Sun Jun 28 22:37:24 2015 UTC,"i think that might just be a result of how color-phobic men's fashion (and by extension this sub) has been of late  there are plenty of great brands that don't stick to greyscale or subdued tans, blues and greens"
malefashion,3bfh2m,CheerUpBrokeBoy,8,Sun Jun 28 22:47:02 2015 UTC,lol  but seriously saint laurent has done some in your face colour in the past but it isn't known for maximalism. and it is usually very hard to pull off

malefashion,3bblz9,TESLA-fan,1 point,Sun Jun 28 01:49:08 2015 UTC,"Yeah there seems to be a bit of confusion here.  I'm trying to figure out Meunier's influence vs. getting out of the shadow of the namesake.  I thought his first season was really nuanced and safe and he's branching out with more colors/fabrics.    There are flashes of what I think are very classic Ann D stuff that I like though and I think this is a good balance... (look 5 and 19, perhaps?).  Personal fave is look 11, that long vest and the aesthetic on the lapel."
malefashion,3bblz9,xHao1,1 point,Sun Jun 28 07:02:23 2015 UTC,"While the skinniness of this collection I think is one of its biggest problems, Ann has used plenty of very tight trousers in the past, so it's not uncommon for the brand."
malefashion,3bblz9,Hamlor,3,Sun Jun 28 07:40:36 2015 UTC,"yes, i agree, my point however is that the signature plays on sillouettes are missing from the whole collection, which is the flaring of arm/leg openings, alterations in proportions length and width wise, etc. although its easy to look at ann leaving her label as the cause of these issues, the past couple of seasons have been objectively lackluster.   i reckon anyway lol"

malefashion,3bb9n0,RodyFashion,3,Sat Jun 27 15:53:14 2015 UTC,I don't follow either brand but is this really reminiscent of raf/sterling ruby to anyone else? Someone more knowledgeable can tell me how wrong I am.
malefashion,3bb9n0,timmmmmay,3,Sat Jun 27 18:50:35 2015 UTC,"I think it could be a part of Pigalle's general direction of conforming to the ""high fashion"" group, and from what I see, most ""streetwear"" brands tend to veer towards Raf for their higher fashion aspirations  Check out this article from BOF that talks about how Pigalle is planning to shed its identity. Which I think Pigalle will struggle with"
malefashion,3bb9n0,JustFromage,7,Sat Jun 27 19:20:13 2015 UTC,"The thing is, and part of this is my ignorance, but Pigalle doesn't really have an identity besides, ""Oh, A$AP Rocky name dropped them and they have bogos that you used to only be able to cop in Paris."" Obviously there's streetwear and basketball inspiration but who cares? The brand is mostly a blank slate. They've been putting out comfy, bigger pieces for a while but most are pretty forgettable. I don't think they're bad but not every streetwear brand needs to be a ""fashion"" brand. Maybe I'll change my mind in a few months but Gosha straddles the line better."

malefashion,3b7pkr,maps1488,1 point,Sat Jun 27 17:34:28 2015 UTC,"This is rad, can I ask why it's only a pop up and not a permanent store? Just curious as to what goes into making a decision like that."

malefashion,3b7qud,neverherebefore,12,Fri Jun 26 17:25:49 2015 UTC,adidas really stepping up their game
malefashion,3b7qud,cakefrags,8,Fri Jun 26 21:18:00 2015 UTC,"It's pretty unreal.  People were saying this a year ago, but it wasn't as readily apparent. These days, it's impossible to ignore how far they have come."
malefashion,3b7qud,Walt_F,3,Sat Jun 27 01:03:26 2015 UTC,Would buy at least 3 pairs
malefashion,3b7qud,DarkHaute,5,Fri Jun 26 19:28:02 2015 UTC,man those look so cool. three stripes are taking over.
malefashion,3b7qud,jpthehp,1 point,Fri Jun 26 23:21:06 2015 UTC,Don't like the two directions of the ripples(?) here on the outsole but these are really nice. Overall cool collection.
malefashion,3b7qud,ilike13acon,1 point,Sat Jun 27 02:00:22 2015 UTC,Looks like they've taken a lot of inspiration from the y3 qasa highs and other shoes from that collaboration. I wonder if yohji helped with the design of these.
malefashion,3b7qud,Rj_d,1 point,Sat Jun 27 07:11:57 2015 UTC,This is amazing; I had never really payed attention to adidas before (or tech runners in general) but I just might have to pick up a pair of these next year. (Anyone know what model this is btw? all the names are a bit confusing)
malefashion,3b6cvv,Okuu6,3,Fri Jun 26 09:42:11 2015 UTC,very much digging the toe-less boots
malefashion,3b6cvv,Xandralis,3,Fri Jun 26 13:43:50 2015 UTC,"Am I the only one who feels a softer, more spiritual tone with this collection compared to prior collections? I like it"
malefashion,3b6cvv,fiestadelsalsa,2,Fri Jun 26 19:40:36 2015 UTC,"thanks for posting this, I couldn't find the collection online last night. I'm a fan of the blazers especially those cuts"
malefashion,3b6cvv,openwatch,2,Fri Jun 26 14:32:07 2015 UTC,"This is so fucking good, honestly enjoy this more than the street-assassin thing they've had going for the past few collections."
malefashion,3b6cvv,guly5ever,2,Fri Jun 26 23:12:28 2015 UTC,"love this, the large pieces of driftwood were unexpected lol"
malefashion,3b6cvv,frenchfrieskl,2,Sat Jun 27 00:09:51 2015 UTC,"Really cool, I truly feel that Julius is reaching it's Zenith, easily Top 3 from Paris so far for me."
malefashion,3b5q16,openwatch,7,Fri Jun 26 04:40:46 2015 UTC,"Really enjoying this, and Balenciaga is usually not a brand I'm into. They killed it with technical outerwear, and pairing it with military styled footwear works excellently. The fabrics they used for shirting are really interesting, and the setting really tops off the whole thing. Well done Balenciaga."
malefashion,3b5q16,CaliforniaViking,2,Fri Jun 26 09:36:51 2015 UTC,"I really enjoyed this collection. The cuts on some of the pieces were great. Although, I probably wouldn't be interested in the technical clothing it was still well executed. This was one of the top collections from Paris thus far from me."
malefashion,3b5q16,Aaarrrgh,1 point,Fri Jun 26 14:25:10 2015 UTC,"Reminds me a bit of Alexander Wang's own collections, if aWang was less minimal, but I think it's pretty good."
malefashion,3b5q16,frenchfrieskl,1 point,Fri Jun 26 07:48:58 2015 UTC,"yeah i agree with this, military/sportswearish vibe. pretty unlike balenciaga"
malefashion,3b5q16,blarghable,1 point,Fri Jun 26 15:26:29 2015 UTC,jacket in #3 is amazing.
malefashion,3b46qc,weenewman,5,Thu Jun 25 20:46:02 2015 UTC,"Really digging the textures in 30 & 31, reminds me of Issey Miyake."
malefashion,3b46qc,palmytree,2,Thu Jun 25 20:48:04 2015 UTC,Loved those.
malefashion,3b46qc,coldomatic,5,Thu Jun 25 23:48:00 2015 UTC,the crinkled grey suit with cropped pants one is probably my favourite. That shade of grey looks amazing.
malefashion,3b46qc,Jacob_The_Duck,1 point,Fri Jun 26 03:47:23 2015 UTC,"I can't agree more, i just paused on that slide and was just amazed at how cool that was. I wonder if it's a sewn in crinkle or just a wrinkled linen blend."
malefashion,3b46qc,friendliest_giant,10,Fri Jun 26 17:22:16 2015 UTC,"I absolutely loved this album, especially the way that most of the collection was subtly (and not so subtly) unsymmetrical. The fits were also amazing. Maybe I'm biased because I find this 'style' to be an absolute pleasure."
malefashion,3b46qc,iamsuperflush,4,Fri Jun 26 02:38:05 2015 UTC,Am I the only one who can never get style.com slideshows to work properly? They always get stuck on the first image.
malefashion,3b46qc,acebrotura,2,Fri Jun 26 14:33:20 2015 UTC,"Love how the kind of ""splattered paint"" aesthetic builds off incrementally through the fits, this is some truly beautiful stuff. Really makes it a dance for the eyes to work around these fits."
malefashion,3b46qc,BasilVal,1 point,Fri Jun 26 13:21:33 2015 UTC,"Excellent, thanks."
malefashion,3b46qc,openwatch,1 point,Thu Jun 25 22:31:59 2015 UTC,"does he usually use this much color? When I think of Yohji I usually see black, grey, etc. I found the colorful pieces to be pretty nice and I liked the texture on his pieces as always."
malefashion,3b46qc,TESLA-fan,11,Fri Jun 26 04:36:39 2015 UTC,"yes, yohji has always had a balance of monochrome and color into his collections, incorporating them into prints, patterns, etc."
malefashion,3b5jsk,openwatch,3,Fri Jun 26 03:40:50 2015 UTC,Blue camo jacket is absolute ballgame
malefashion,3b5jsk,Prodigy-II,2,Fri Jun 26 08:54:19 2015 UTC,"Looking at the art and craftsmanship itself, I gotta honestly say, those Chinese inspired crane/phoenix/peacock embroideries are beautiful."
malefashion,3b5jsk,obbob,2,Fri Jun 26 04:58:13 2015 UTC,"His strongest collection yet. Apparently in this case especially, the photos don't do the clothes justice, they're supposed to be really structurally impressive."
malefashion,3b5jsk,guly5ever,1 point,Fri Jun 26 08:55:46 2015 UTC,"Honestly this felt a bit unapproachable, what with all the OD satin."
malefashion,3b5jsk,DatSkinnyMuthaFucka,3,Fri Jun 26 04:22:24 2015 UTC,"I don't think LV runway pieces are meant to be approachable by the masses anyways. But, I posted it primarily because it was a vast improvement compared to Kim Jones' other LV collections imo."
malefashion,3b4c8w,openwatch,1 point,Thu Jun 25 21:27:31 2015 UTC,"Hey, just curious ~ what style of jacket is the on in this picture:  http://theimprint.theimpression.com/wp-content/uploads/Miyake-m-RS16-0101.jpg With the single button near the neck, is there a name for that style?"
malefashion,3b4c8w,helloitsjonny,2,Mon Jun 29 01:00:25 2015 UTC,Soutien collar single breast mac coat is probably what you're looking for?
malefashion,3b4c8w,PapaBearBrian,2,Tue Jun 30 05:32:57 2015 UTC,"Yep, that yields good results, thanks for the clear reply! :)"
malefashion,3b4h9i,benj1623,3,Thu Jun 25 22:05:53 2015 UTC,Marilyn Monroe and lobsters
malefashion,3b4h9i,Pengyster,2,Thu Jun 25 22:18:52 2015 UTC,never seen dvn do photo prints like that before... odd  although that marilyn button down is pretty killer
malefashion,3b4h9i,guly5ever,3,Thu Jun 25 22:29:23 2015 UTC,"Really don't like the Marilyn prints, which was essentially the entire collection.  Then again, I don't fully understand the reason why they were included. Not a big fan of the lobster prints either, there are subtle and better ways to reference Schiaparelli.  Side-note: What's with all these painfully-obvious references in this season's shows?"
malefashion,3b4h9i,Suquida,2,Fri Jun 26 08:54:48 2015 UTC,"I felt the exact same way after seeing this and undercovers latest stuff, Marilyn monroe and Star Wars, ehhh  Maybe we're witnessing the birth of a microtrend, ""glaringly obvious pop culture prints"""
malefashion,3b2b45,BUKUTUS,32,Thu Jun 25 11:58:09 2015 UTC,Talk about career suicide. If that guy actually was acting on his own accord he'll never see the runway again.
malefashion,3b2b45,Crow_Shit,23,Thu Jun 25 12:21:11 2015 UTC,GG.  He also was punched in the face.
malefashion,3b2b45,twinsofliberty,23,Thu Jun 25 12:26:38 2015 UTC,wait rick punched him? lol
malefashion,3b2b45,Schenectadye,14,Thu Jun 25 14:46:24 2015 UTC,"Which showed his aggression, circlejerk"
malefashion,3b2b45,postposter,11,Thu Jun 25 15:44:58 2015 UTC,"He’s been my male muse for the past twelve years or something   This is a safe space, Ricky, you can be honest."
malefashion,3b2b45,CheerUpBrokeBoy,20,Thu Jun 25 18:32:38 2015 UTC,"he's bi, has an unconventional lifestyle and his wife is 20 years older than him  that goes without saying"
malefashion,3b2b45,windowflowers,4,Thu Jun 25 21:38:10 2015 UTC,"Wait, did it actually say anywhere that it was in the face?"
malefashion,3b2b45,St_OP_to_u_chin_me,-17,Thu Jun 25 17:08:24 2015 UTC,models down the runway with their penises exposed?!...wtf

malefashion,3b2b45,CheerUpBrokeBoy,11,Thu Jun 25 13:25:29 2015 UTC,"seriously  especially considering the theme of the show was ""protesting male aggression"", and this is for sure going to be the most-publicized part of the show instead of the clothes"
malefashion,3b2b45,Strange1130,7,Thu Jun 25 15:22:31 2015 UTC,"yeah and that dude has been modelling for rick for YEARS.  crazy.  edit: says in the article 12 years, damn.  I remember seeing him in Rick ads ~5 or so ago, but didn't know he went that far back."
malefashion,3b2b45,trippy_grape,0,Thu Jun 25 18:16:30 2015 UTC,"It's a shame, because the mint-green series of tops were some of my favorites and he completely covered and hide one of them with the poster. :("

malefashion,3b2b45,fatalistspalmistry,7,Thu Jun 25 15:08:01 2015 UTC,Well memed.
malefashion,3b2b45,mc-lunar,27,Fri Jun 26 11:25:41 2015 UTC,"Woke up early Stayed up and watched the live stream of the runway show.  Saw Michele Lamy up front chatting with a few people.  First impressions of the show before all review is posted:   The first dude looked like Theon Greyjoy Rain boots and Combat Boots. It's too bad this is going to be released after winter. (unclear from the image but the profile of the combat boots made it appear as though they had lace holes all the way up) That being said the boots that appear after that look pretty enticing.  The footwear afterwards, which I assume might be ROxAdidas, was interesting... Kind of look like martial arts shinguards.  Hair Cowls S/S '16 Kind of resembles an upside-down night gown I really like the gradient pieces The texturing here is really well done And the black hole shirts are dope In case you're wondering who Angela Merkel might be Tricky Ricky looking jacked. Overall Feeling   PS NowFashion also has a bunch of pictures. Some more detailed/better even. Why do we always post style.com links?   Shinguard/ninja cargo sandals (I think that's a pocket) Dementor Pic Golden Bomber for this man Illuminati Confirmed =)"

malefashion,3b2b45,DatSkinnyMuthaFucka,2,Thu Jun 25 19:07:50 2015 UTC,"I post style.com links cause a review is included, which is sometimes interesting, but mostly because it is easy to view and access the pictures. If you find something you like, you can easily search for more detailed pictures on the look elsewhere."
malefashion,3b2b45,trippy_grape,9,Thu Jun 25 19:11:20 2015 UTC,Never thought I'd be into graphic rick but I really dig the eyes. Really solid collection overall imo
malefashion,3b2b45,maps1488,2,Thu Jun 25 16:26:40 2015 UTC,His 2014 SS graphics were absolutely amazing imo.
malefashion,3b2b45,jasonjahson,9,Sat Jun 27 19:50:06 2015 UTC,"Man, he's always so good. Its a style I would never wear and I honestly don't really enjoy seeing in the wild, but it is incredible what he can create."
malefashion,3b2b45,svalmyrrh,2,Thu Jun 25 16:06:57 2015 UTC,I got curious what a woman does at men's fashion show ;-)

malefashion,3b2b45,svalmyrrh,2,Thu Jun 25 15:46:51 2015 UTC,If you lightened up you might enjoy it.
malefashion,3b2b45,flrfmp2yashit,5,Thu Jun 25 21:54:44 2015 UTC,"were did i say i didn't enjoy it? i respect rick. all i alluded to was that the hair cocoon was comical, which it is. welcome to r/malefashion, where people down vote you to oblivion for harmless comments they don't agree with."

malefashion,3b2b45,mc-lunar,8,Thu Jun 25 12:57:43 2015 UTC,because we get comments like yours on p much every post...

malefashion,3b2b45,konzaii,3,Thu Jun 25 16:44:54 2015 UTC,I also want to wear suits and get fly hunnies
malefashion,3b2b45,twinsofliberty,-42,Thu Jun 25 19:07:13 2015 UTC,Why do they try to make them look as ridiculous as possible?
malefashion,3b2b45,konzaii,20,Thu Jun 25 19:24:57 2015 UTC,they don't :)  it's part of a very different aesthetic in fashion that takes more time to get into
malefashion,3b2b45,GimmeYourTags,-41,Thu Jun 25 19:28:22 2015 UTC,False pretenses 101 right there.
malefashion,3b2b45,konzaii,13,Fri Jun 26 01:02:24 2015 UTC,"or its just that fashion is an art form, and like art fashion is subjective. everyone has different tastes but that doesnt mean you should try to dismiss someones work as false pretenses if you dont like it"

malefashion,3b6zfv,Sondreg93,7,Fri Jun 26 14:01:16 2015 UTC,Do you mean in the way of collabs? Mainline designs? Similar models? Popular colorways? You'll have to be more specific :)
malefashion,3b6zfv,ruuditor,2,Fri Jun 26 15:25:27 2015 UTC,Like In similar design.
malefashion,3b6zfv,secretly_not_obama,2,Fri Jun 26 18:24:26 2015 UTC,There is nikelab that I think is somewhat similar.
malefashion,3b6zfv,openwatch,2,Mon Jun 29 01:36:33 2015 UTC,"nike sportswear, nikelab, nike white label. I think you mean stuff like this?"
malefashion,3b6zfv,Chief_Quiche,2,Fri Jun 26 18:30:37 2015 UTC,Yes! Thank you
malefashion,3b6zfv,Kaisern,2,Fri Jun 26 21:06:45 2015 UTC,Closest thing is probably nikelab
malefashion,3b6zfv,fiestadelsalsa,-7,Mon Jun 29 14:40:10 2015 UTC,"I don't know what you mean, but I'd say low Air Force 1s are the equivalent of the Adidas Originals."
malefashion,3b6zfv,Kaisern,6,Fri Jun 26 16:56:57 2015 UTC,you do realize that adidas originals is the branch of adidas focused on aesthetic design right? not an individual shoe?
malefashion,3b33km,thecanadiancook,14,Thu Jun 25 16:02:19 2015 UTC,I think getting into grad school is an acceptable excuse to buy a leather jacket.
malefashion,3b33km,GimmeYourTags,12,Thu Jun 25 18:17:13 2015 UTC,anything is an excuse to buy a leather jacket if you really want one
malefashion,3b33km,asoihgf,1 point,Thu Jun 25 20:41:17 2015 UTC,Which ones are you looking at?
malefashion,3b33km,thecanadiancook,3,Fri Jun 26 01:45:58 2015 UTC,"Top choices are Rick Intarsia and Margiela 5-zip. I like the more washed leathers as opposed to perfectos or biker jackets.  If anyone has some recommendations, I am all ears."
malefashion,3b33km,timmmmmay,2,Fri Jun 26 07:52:00 2015 UTC,"Better buy now since you sure aren't gonna be afford those leathers on stipend... I'm actually making triple at my summer job, it's ridiculous"
malefashion,3b33km,thecanadiancook,1 point,Fri Jun 26 21:53:48 2015 UTC,Yup :/. But 1.5 full time jobs this summer plus a leather jacket has been in the want for a while. Just hoping for the Grailed/B&S lottery to pay off for me.
malefashion,3b33km,timmmmmay,1 point,Fri Jun 26 22:16:28 2015 UTC,"Oh no I'm definitely not saying you shouldn't get one, it was more of a comment about stipends in general.   Also isn't 1.5 full time jobs just... 1 full time job and 1 part time job? Lol"
malefashion,3b33km,thecanadiancook,1 point,Fri Jun 26 22:53:41 2015 UTC,"Ah, I see. And the stipend will be decent, all things considered, but still probably going to cut down on some spending.   And technically yes it is. However as it stands the lines between them are bluring as I am working ~65 hours a week."

malefashion,3b33km,truthfulie,2,Thu Jun 25 20:13:06 2015 UTC,Which brand/designers are creating some of the more interesting suits for men today?
malefashion,3b33km,mc-lunar,5,Thu Jun 25 18:15:42 2015 UTC,"do you mean interesting as in like deconstructed suits or examining what it means to be a 'suit' or stuff like unusual cuts/styling choices but still wearable to, say, a wedding"
malefashion,3b33km,truthfulie,1 point,Thu Jun 25 18:59:39 2015 UTC,"Both, but not necessarily for formal settings such as a wedding."

malefashion,3b33km,truthfulie,3,Thu Jun 25 21:27:38 2015 UTC,"I don't know yet. As long as it's within reasonable range I guess. Two grand-ish? I been looking at TB, BBBF and wanted know more about other intrestingly tailored suits that I could wear as more of  'fashion suit' that could be worn in casual/informal environments rather than a proper 'business suit' in office settings."
malefashion,3b33km,benj1623,1 point,Thu Jun 25 21:36:34 2015 UTC,"I totally get what you have in mind, although i don't even know where i would begin. A lot of designers make 'fashion'-suits as you call them. Could you elaborate on what you want to be different from say a 'business' suit?"
malefashion,3b33km,truthfulie,2,Thu Jun 25 21:40:56 2015 UTC,"Something that bends and play around with the rules about traditional suit tailoring or play around with details that makes different than other suits or even play with silhouette to certain degree (without going complete avant-garde).  Edit: As you can tell by my lack of particular details, I am not looking for something specific (just yet). I want to know what's out there worth checking out and go from there."
malefashion,3b33km,benj1623,3,Thu Jun 25 21:45:56 2015 UTC,Thom Browne is what immediately comes to mind
malefashion,3b33km,truthfulie,1 point,Thu Jun 25 21:47:43 2015 UTC,"Yeah, he's the one that got me thinking more about this idea to begin with. Do you think there are anyone else out there doing interesting that I should check out?"

I bought the Y-3 Windbreaker on sale, only to find it discounted by another $75 the next day. Oh well, what can ya do. I really like it though.  Finally the HBA shirt lol. There was no way i'd ever pay $750 for that shirt. But currently it's on sale for 50% off... I told myself if it drops to $300 or below I'd buy it, so we'll see."

malefashion,3ayqg4,thecanadiancook,5,Sat Jun 27 19:58:21 2015 UTC,My vote is for the black mids. Having both lows (light grey and black) seems to me a little redundant or at least more static.

malefashion,3awhcv,PrimalTriFecta,25,Wed Jun 24 06:05:06 2015 UTC,"To me it seems like a classic example of economic signaling: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signalling_(economics)  I view it as a statement made by the person about themselves and the groups they feel a part of.  To me it usually indicates less of a mainstream connection and I think there are often costs associated with larger gauges - like it's harder to get certain jobs.  But that's part of the point of signaling - talk is cheap, really good signals should have an associated cost with them.  Fashion wise - it depends on the style you're going for.  It's not a look that I dig but I'm a yuppie so you probably don't care what I think.  But people in your peer group will probably think its super awesome and know that you're committed to that group."

malefashion,3awhcv,StarBelly_Sneetch,7,Wed Jun 24 03:17:35 2015 UTC,"Interesting. I suppose the whole concept of it must stem from making a statement of being part of a sort of counter-culture community. unlike a tattoo or something with the opportunity for more personalization, its sort of one of those things where your more or less either have them or don't, making it a sort of ""with it or against it"" fashion statement.  As someone in the punk music scene seeing a lot of fellow musicians with them I probably subconsciously felt I needed them to really ""signal"" that I was part of that community. Now I could care less and my opinion of them is wavering.  but anyway, that's maybe getting a little more deep into psychology of body modification then either of us planned on going haha."

That can't really be a coincidence. T-shirts/polos, light wash jeans, techie (non-Classic) New Balances. They know this is the ""look"" for people who have certain tech industry jobs, so they abide by it. It's not a complicated look to manage, but they adapt to it nonetheless to send a certain signal about who they are."

For example, in Michael Spence's job-market signalling model, (potential) employees send a signal about their ability level to the employer by acquiring certain education credentials. The informational value of the credential comes from the fact that the employer assumes it is positively correlated with having greater ability.

I haven't really spoken to here in like 4 years after she told me to ""Blow my faggot face and cock off with the 12 gauge in the garage"" but she grew up in a different time, so I can't really blame her all that much.  but we don't get along.

malefashion,3awhcv,KlausFenrir,2,Wed Jun 24 05:20:24 2015 UTC,"Personally, I think they look incredibly unattractive.   Objectively, I would highly suggest you discontinue them. They will seriously limit your employment and mainstream social acceptance. Showing up to an interview with big gauges is like wearing a punk rocker outfit to that interview."

malefashion,3awhcv,brettb515,1 point,Wed Jun 24 20:56:59 2015 UTC,"I think, because ears are so visible, that they signal a certain type of personality. I guess they could be compared to exposed tattoos -- because tattoos are explicitly on the wearer's decision in whether they'll be exposed or not, gauged ears are instead made to stand out.  The tattoos on the inside of my wrists are a lot more subdued compared to, say, a half- or full-sleeve."

malefashion,3awhcv,Hahahahahahai,1 point,Wed Jun 24 14:08:43 2015 UTC,"Gauges that size are easily acceptable today.  That said, it does affect your professional image, so it all depends on what your career goals are.  Can you rise to be a CEO with them? Probably?  Though you'll often be starting yourself with a handicap, as they will always be part of your first impression.  So, really there is no correct answer to ""keep them or not,"" but rather the question is what are your priorities?  Do you want to have that self-expression first and foremost, and do you consider it part of your identity?  Or do you want to put your career growth first?  Feel free to stop reading here.  Below is a bit on my personal experience:  I had my ears gauged (maybe 4g or 2g, I honestly forget) all though college, and graduate school.  For some of college I had both the gauges and a lip ring.  For summer internships I would take the lip ring and gauges out (they were small enough that unless you were looking for them, you couldn't tell w/o a plug in) while at work.  I eventually took the lip ring out for medical reasons, but would have eventually anyways.  The gauges remained for just under 10 years.  Fast forward to about 1 year after grad school and into my actual career.  I happen to work in a place that didn't care, so I wore them everyday.  I was playing in a company rec basketball game and the ref said I had to take them out.  I was getting married about 6 months from then, starting out my career, and always knew I'd get rid of them someday.  So I took that as the sign to just get it over with.  Anyways, for the first several months I felt like I had lost part of me.  When I was in my shirt and tie for work there was nothing distinguishing me anymore, I was just like everyone else.  I got over it though, and honestly, it is probably for the best.  Although my firm doesn't care, I do have a client-facing position and I'm sure that the gauges would have inhibited my growth eventually.  Some of the comments here have been voicing a ""pro-gauge"" opinion with reasoning that people should be judged by their character and not their appearance.  I completely agree, but I think that logic swings both ways.  Yes, you shouldn't write someone off just because they have gauges.  But at the same time it is pretty naive to have this need to project a certain image.  You are who you are with or without gauges. That's essentially the realization I eventually came to after taking mine out.  [edit: grammar]"

malefashion,3awhcv,soundclip989,1 point,Wed Jun 24 14:03:49 2015 UTC,"That's what I did although it was prob 10 yrs ago. I went down size by size as to let the skin adjust. I've seen some friends take them out at a 1/2"" or so and it'll close a bit but does not pull all the way back. I still have small holes. Nothing noticeable but my advice is go down slowly to try to get some elasticity back in the skin."

I still respect body mods (and definitely tattoos; they're having a moment as people finally move on to GOOD body art instead of just tribal tattoos and generic stars) but I never, never, never see gauged ears on someone I think it dressed well or interestingly, and maybe that's why it's never had a positive association for me."

If your goal is to design the monster for the movie Alien, then beauty might not be your goal, and beautiful design would be bad design.  Of course the other fault is that my idea of beautiful is different than your idea of beautiful. In this video they describe minimal churches as ugly, though minimal design is quite desirable by many people, especially architects. Though stained glass windows and sculptures might be nice in a church setting, they aren't exactly standard design in all houses and apartments.   This video, it turns out, is an example of bad design, because it didn't present good arguments for the importance of design."

malefashion,3apfvx,iamonapig,23,Mon Jun 22 19:18:30 2015 UTC,"I don't like it.   The watch is too bulky. The tee is form-fitting, while the RO stuff is oversized and works best with loose fitting tops, and your calfs are awesomely shaped, which doesn't show, because shorts are long and shoes are high. Now your legs just look too big.  As for my personal opinion: Burlon is really tacky, wearing RO bottoms and shoes is a bit on the nose, and as a whole it's nothing original; mostly expensive hyped pieces packed together without regard to what works for you, your shape and tone.  Your complexion is pretty dark, wear earth tones and grey to accentuate that. Or go for contrast   Your build is strong. Wear something that fits and highlights that.   Don't overspend on hyped clothes that don't fit your build. You could have spent 20% of what you're wearing on an outfit that looks much better.  Actually, spend as much as you like, just don't let hype be the reason you buy something. Make sure it works for you. Check out Études, that would work really good on you.  One more thing, if sweat or nipples are the reason for the undershirt, you shouldn't be wearing that tee to being with."
malefashion,3apfvx,postposter,23,Mon Jun 22 14:31:41 2015 UTC,"First of all thank you for the criticism. I like how you explained all of your points. I do feel that you contradicted yourself more than once though. You say go less form fitting but wear something that highlights my build. Also about contrast. Im wearing white and black on darker skin tone.   I really dont subscribe to the whole dressing for skin tone because ive heard at a darker tone just too avoid too many bright colors and you're good.

And for the shirt its both sweat, nipples, and darker skin tone that shows the shirt. With black shirts you would almost never know im wearing the beater.  Edit: Spacing."
malefashion,3apfvx,jtwizzle57,5,Mon Jun 22 15:54:43 2015 UTC,"Thanks for taking it well, i meant it well.  The formfitting critisism was in relation to how you styled it with the RO shorts and shoes. The combo doesn't work.  Overall, i think you have good build to dress form-fitting or slimmer. That's meant as a compliment.  Your complexion is awesome, that's why I said something about it. The reason I linked Etudes is because they've done some awesome pieces that just work better if you have dark skin. (Not the motor-print stuff, scroll up or down to the more basic sweats and tees in blue or neon.)  Anyway, I usually don't bother with these comments, because it tends to attract negativity, but I felt you could pull off some awesome fits if you'd look in a different direction.   My 2 cents.   Edit: i forgot to mention, I kind of misprashed my first comment about styling for your complexion. I didn't mean you should only wear darker tones. But I think they'd work well on you."

Anyways, I agree a drapier tee would go better with the fit, but OP doesn't need to go for a different look to accentuate his build.

The double RO and fitted tee points are helpful, but turning around and saying they don't show off athleticism is nonsensical (which is why I downvoted). Not downvoting you though, so that's someone else."

The MB tee really just doesn't compliment the proportions of the shorts and sneaks.   And with all due respect, I think this looks gaudy with the watch and print. I think rick's look is cool when understated, but the print and watch are certainly supposed to be eye-catchers.  I think if you got a longer top and ditched the watch the rick look would be really great on you. You definitely have the body type for it from what i can tell."

malefashion,3aq179,teckneaks,8,Mon Jun 22 18:02:50 2015 UTC,"this basically looks like you're wearing tshirt and jeans. when it comes to getting that yohji look, its way way way bigger than you think, combined with exacting tailoring at specific points. yohji pants have huge legs, but fit fairly well at the waist, and sit very high, and have a specific type of break (which varies, all im saying is that you have to consider how the break effects the the shape.   im 5'8'' but i have very short legs, a long torso, and broad shoulders, which makes yohji stuff challenging because the volumous pants look better on longer legs imo. doesn't mean that you can't mess around with the lines of course.  for your fit, obviously try different things: size up a lot. size up one item and then size down another (big huge tee with skinny, short pants are big right now). try moving the cuff up and down your leg. try this on with minimal shoes like cons, and then big chunky shoes. try wearing two pairs of pants, or pants with shorts. layer everything, try to obscure where one garment starts and another ends."
malefashion,3aq179,FinalPartisan,1 point,Mon Jun 22 18:46:50 2015 UTC,I have a question related to body type if u dont mind me asking. Im 6ft with slightly longer legs and shorter torso. I have slightly broader shoulders as well. So my question is what type of clothes should i avoid and what can i wear? My understanding is that i can wear longlines to balence out my longer legs and shorter torso. Should I avoid skinny jeans? Im really interested in stuff like julius and RO. Im asking here because mfa doesnt really talk about brands like julius and ro.
malefashion,3aq179,teckneaks,2,Tue Jun 23 04:11:05 2015 UTC,"really just depends on what you're looking for. long legs and broad shoulders sounds like you've got a model's proportions, and that really means you can probably wear whatever the fuck you want. skinny jeans could look great if you're looking for an SLP look.   i'd break it down into sections: legs, feet, torso, head. These are the main areas you can affect.   Here's a tall dude who is doing the yohji thing. chunky feet. wide legs. squarish torso. works great.  this guy kinda has the opposite: slim legs, big hat, cropped top with layering.   then there's this that kinda does both: big furry shorts, chunky shoe and ankle, but fitted torso and no hair.   they all work in different ways, so i hesitate to say there's a ""rule"" outside of the ones you set for yourself. RO stuck looks great on skinny tall people because rick is himself skinny and tall(ish) and his clothes ranges from tight ass jeans to baggy basketball shorts.    edit: this guy is another example of moving the lines/proportions. you can tell he's slim and tall(er) but the jacket moves his waistline super high up. then he's got these blocky shorts that anchor everything, and then skinny stick legs. we can't see his feet but using the above experimental options, he could probably punctuate everything with big fat sneakers and look rad."
malefashion,3aq179,FinalPartisan,1 point,Tue Jun 23 16:05:56 2015 UTC,"Thanks, the issue is it seems like a lot of people who wear SLP are thin. Ive been working on my fitness for the past year (I used to be skinny fat). So i have muscular legs compared to the guys who wear skinny slp jeans. I went to try on some julius jeans and although I really liked them, I wasnt sure if it was a problem that it formed to some of my muscles. Im not sure if im describing it right? But basically im just worried i wouldnt be able to pull off stuff like julius, ro, etc... cus Im trying to get fit???

malefashion,3aou88,Suquida,1 point,Mon Jun 22 21:44:01 2015 UTC,"I don't understand the boots with those pants. Loosen up the pants and it might look better together. That would also create some sort of synergy with the bomber. Further, you might want to think about the layering up top. I think it's an awkward length for a bomber exacerbated by the fact that the t shirt, from what I can tell, is the same length."
malefashion,3aou88,Suquida,1 point,Mon Jun 22 13:46:22 2015 UTC,"The boots are what I have, and I didn't think they looked terrible. What do you mean ""loosen up"" the pants, like get a size larger? As I said to another poster, it's not a bomber, it's like a moto jacket, which is why it's that length. And again, the shirt is not, the details are just not coming out due to the poor lighting in my apartment. I might try to take better pics if it's light out today."
malefashion,3aou88,Suquida,1 point,Mon Jun 22 21:20:00 2015 UTC,"Yep, because the shoes are kinda bulky, it would match looser pants, especially if they are clunky military boots. Sorry, when I posted you hadn't clarified the bomber. I still stand by what I said though, the length is a little strange, just chopping you off in a really unflattering way, imo. I agree about the lighting, I kinda can just tell that the t shirt is the length it is; more lighting would help."
malefashion,3aou88,weenewman,1 point,Mon Jun 22 21:35:12 2015 UTC,"Gotcha, that makes sense. What would you change as to footwear? that seems to be a very common critique, but I'm having a hard time teasing answers out of people.

If you're looking for shirts with interesting materials, American Apparel makes viscose shirts, in both an oversized and regular fit. They also have a nice sheer jersey cotton shirt that has a longer length and a scoop neck. None of these are l/s.  Voidthebrand has some l/s shirts in a 50/50 cotton modal blend.

Would have liked the fit a lot more if you included a more inspiring silhouette or an intriguing textural element to the outfit. You neutralized Rick with Acne when I think you should really try to make Rick the grounding feature for a more ambitious fit. From your comments, it seems like your wardrobe is a WIP (hopefully it never isn't!), but these are just my thoughts and hopefully you take them into consideration going forward."

Meanwhile, retrospecs looks like he is wearing the clothes he wants to wear.   I look at the other posters on this board and pity them because they paid so much to be owned by their clothes.

How's the Ann shirt? What differentiates it from any other black shirt?

malefashion,3aaqah,Uncle_Ernie,11,Thu Jun 18 16:05:41 2015 UTC,"I sell a lot of stuff on Grailed and from that perspective it's pretty great. There are many lowballers, but that's what you get with a ""best offer"" system. I've had items sell in a couple hours to a couple months; it all depends on the hype of what you're selling. There has recently been an influx of streetwear/Jordan kids that has negatively impacted the site, but the admins are currently working on a plan to separate them. I foresee another division ala ""grailed basic"" but with streetwear.   From a buying perspective, you constantly have to worry about fakes with the more common items. Making sure the seller has references is a huge part of buying something. I wouldn't recommend doing trades via Grailed unless you are looking to never get your item back. On the other hand, if you're quick enough, you can find some great items for very cheap.  Overall, Grailed is a nice website, but it has some major flaws that can't easily be fixed."
malefashion,3aaqah,grailedofficial,10,Thu Jun 18 16:21:05 2015 UTC,Thanks for the kind words. We are indeed concerned about the growing streetwear presence on the site and how it is impacting the overall flow. Our broader redesign should help alleviate this issue in a big way. We are also pursuing all necessary avenues to cut off the flow of fakes that have accompanied this influx.
malefashion,3aaqah,timmmmmay,3,Thu Jun 18 16:43:59 2015 UTC,"Awesome to hear. I think a better filtering system would also help a lot. Right now I only follow a handful of brands in my filters, but I think I would greater prefer to unfollow certain brands."

I'm on there probably 2-3 a day lately, been close to buying things but haven't pulled any triggers since my first purchase.  I feel that there should be some sort of template for the descriptions so that each item has all the necessary info (dimensions, description, wear/age, etc) and maybe have some sort of requisite photos (front, back, proffesional/site example, etc) that each item must have, I'm sick of grainy, dark, vague photos."
malefashion,3aaqah,grailedofficial,8,Thu Jun 18 16:27:23 2015 UTC,Great call - this will be a part of the new sell form. We definitely want to encourage users to be more informative and post much better pictures.

malefashion,3aaqah,dakaf_fal,2,Fri Jun 19 23:20:51 2015 UTC,"I ask for more information if I'm serious about buying, but the quality of the listing also plays a big part in my decision.

The measurements looked legit but parts where the cut differs aren't usually measured (biceps, waist) and those were where it was the most ill-fitting. Well, if anyone knows a lady who can use some swag, let me know.  Second time, I bought a nice pair of Patrik Ervell winter jeans off Grailed for a fair price. Guess what, seller spilled bleach on them again. He also doesn't seem to understand the Paypal process for returns. What a pain."

malefashion,3a5fj2,joehatespotatoes,33,Fri Jun 19 00:01:13 2015 UTC,I'd be careful about cultural appropriation here guy
malefashion,3a5fj2,StarBelly_Sneetch,16,Wed Jun 17 12:11:03 2015 UTC,"People should not be downvoting this. ""Disrespectful"" is the first thing that came to mind when I heard OP's desire to wear a turban.  Do whatever you want, OP, but be mindful of cultural and religious significance. Some of these head garbs are still relevant to a sizable portion the modern world."
malefashion,3a5fj2,StarBelly_Sneetch,16,Wed Jun 17 12:58:43 2015 UTC,"i value your point, its why the first place i stopped was a gurdwara to ask about the turban as an item in sikhism.    basically, it was told to me like this: all sikhs wear turbans, but not all people who wear turbans are sikh.  and when i was talking with them, and the muslim people at the mosque, I was met with genuine interest, fascination, and support- even with them full well knowing it was for appearance reasons, and in the context of fashion, not religious significance at all,   most of the ""disrespectful"" side of the argument i have heard, oddly enough, comes from caucasians, at least as far as my exploration has gone    also a point to add is im not saying to rip the styles straight out of those cultures, but to use them as a baseline inspiration for other wrap- headdresses"
malefashion,3a5fj2,StarBelly_Sneetch,6,Wed Jun 17 13:06:03 2015 UTC,"I appreciate your efforts, but a sample size of 1 Gurdwara is not statistically significant. You must know that there are other members of faith who take the 5 principles very seriously. To many, the turban is a symbol of faith. If you really want to misappropriate that just for the fashion lulz then be prepared for blowback."
malefashion,3a5fj2,shffldair,10,Wed Jun 17 13:54:48 2015 UTC,"2 actually, plus r/sikism a few weeks back when it first poked into my brain, and i emailed a few sikh bloggers and a few forums.   trust me, I'm doing my homework, but as all the sikhs told me, the 5 ks are only meaningful when meaning is given.  that being said, not everyone is going to be happy, people were pissed when women wore pants for the first time, lol (different ballgame, i am aware of)"
malefashion,3a5fj2,shffldair,2,Wed Jun 17 14:06:09 2015 UTC,"I think thats valid, by no means do I condone appropriation, but an appreciation, experimentation, inspiration and ultimately creativity is the goal."

malefashion,3a5fj2,Deutschbury,9,Wed Jun 17 14:11:00 2015 UTC,in what way is it displeasing?
malefashion,3a5fj2,L30N1DA5,4,Wed Jun 17 14:12:47 2015 UTC,"I have zero cultural affiliation towards the turban. I don't see a particularly huge issue with westerners wearing them (though I can see people getting offended), but I, and I would imagine others, just don't feel a connection to them. It's an item born out of geographical necessity that took on cultural significance, and a lot of us just don't have any sort of that background whatsoever, so it would feel really fake and put-on by me to wear one. I wouldn't feel comfortable in it one bit, and isn't confidence the key? I also just like hair too, and removing hairstyles from the equation isn't a notion I'm very find of.  In my case, there is also the fact that  it's just pretty impractical where I live as well."
malefashion,3a5fj2,Prodigy-II,1 point,Wed Jun 17 21:37:20 2015 UTC,"Mhm, completely get that it stems from geography and practical purpose, but we wear combat boots and are not soldiers, and countless other things that have been repurposed   confidence is really important, I agree, just like anything from a pair of shoes to stuff like thing, the main thing is being comfortable.  also the idea is not to wear one every day, but to have more varity, so you can keep your hairstyles for some days :P"
malefashion,3a5fj2,Prodigy-II,2,Wed Jun 17 21:49:33 2015 UTC,"I don't disagree, but those aren't 1:1. The combat boots I wear are decidedly western, the same as my father and uncles wore in Vietnam. If you're going to toss out everything that's been repurposed, then there won't be much left. Turbans are just so obviously non-western and specific that it feels like an attention grab.   I actually just took an entire course last semester on non-western rhetoric and how it fits into our current understanding; I wish this had been posted six months ago, since I could have written a ton about it."
malefashion,3a5fj2,Prodigy-II,2,Wed Jun 17 21:53:14 2015 UTC,"absolutely not a 1:1, so rather then that, how about something like the cross?   the idea of it being an ""attention grab"" is a little complicated, is not most avant garde fashion ideas ""attention grabbing"" I think thats the point of art most of the time regardless, to grab attention, spark interest and establish meaning (or lack there of) so i don't really see that as a negative connotation, and don't see why so many people do see it as so negative."
malefashion,3aaxtf,jwas1256,16,Thu Jun 18 16:57:58 2015 UTC,Pic from the front is necessary if you want people to say anything about this. Just blur/cover your face if you're worried about anonymity. Also don't use backlighting like that as it will cause everything in front to be underexposed.

malefashion,3a3bri,EJ-ericjackson,16,Wed Jun 17 04:55:38 2015 UTC,Wrong again. Japan fetishizes Americana more than America does.
malefashion,3a3bri,timmmmmay,-3,Wed Jun 17 13:27:15 2015 UTC,"they like to manipulate americana, sure.  and they do take some inspiration from them, and a culture cannot fetishize itself, thats defeats the purpose the definition of the word ""fetish""   but they also a lot of the time actively protest american influence in Japanese culture and media.  I'm by no means some weeaboo japan-o-pile, there 20 or so cultures I'm more interested in then them, but none the less, it is plainly apparent that they are culturally and influentially xenophobic, they have been for centuries VERY SLOWLY opening up,"
malefashion,3a3bri,EJ-ericjackson,8,Wed Jun 17 13:32:57 2015 UTC,"a culture cannot fetishize itself, thats defeats the purpose the definition of the word ""fetish""   Yes they can if the culture has transitioned past the source of inspiration. Amish people are Americans. American can still fetishize Amish style. I do think you're minimizing the influence Americana has had on Japanese style, and the subsequent influence Japanese Americana had on modern Americana.  It's definitely true that Japan remains quite xenophobic today, Japanese xenophobia is far more complex that can be summed up in a single statement. It's very multidimensional... for example, they may be very open to external cultures from an aesthetic or design standpoint, but become very defensive once external culture threatens to alter their traditional way of life."

malefashion,3a1996,radioactivify,6,Tue Jun 16 19:58:30 2015 UTC,like this dude.  nothing really to critique whatsoever. maybe looser pants but still look fine here as is. maybe lighter shoes too?
malefashion,3a1996,ThisIsJesseTaft,10,Tue Jun 16 14:12:29 2015 UTC,"I would have liked some grey suede slip ons but I can't have them all haha, thanks man"
malefashion,3a1996,rosstimus,4,Tue Jun 16 14:19:38 2015 UTC,it'd be interesting to experiment with even looser pants with a heavier taper and espadrille-ish shoes
malefashion,3a1996,Prodigy-II,3,Tue Jun 16 16:27:08 2015 UTC,"So wider thighs and slimmer ankles? I have a couple of pairs with extreme tapers so I'll give them a go. I tend to shy away from espadrille's though because I feel like having small slim feet to begin with throws the balance off once I exaggerate them with what is essentially a well built sock haha. I wanted to go with a very simple shoe because the Kimono to me sets the tone of simplicity, not only in it's lack of hardware etc. but also in it's cultural identity. Other than espaidrilles and slip ons, can you recommend any others?"

malefashion,39xdml,CheerUpBrokeBoy,3,Tue Jun 16 00:25:54 2015 UTC,"For the record, the usage of 'mongol' as a derogatory term arises from mongolism, now known as Down syndrome. Still offensive, but not (directly) racist."

Honestly most of the socks you'll find will probably be the same - just look for something with a thin/no elastic band at the opening.   I've tried ones from BR, JCrew, Uniqlo, and Ninja Sox and my favorite ones are probably Uniqlo since they fit my feet the best (size 8 brannock)."

I ended up getting everything for about 60% off.  I had initially walked into Barney's after buying a pair of jeans that ripped within the first week of wear, and were apparently defective. Walked into the store to see if I could get a replacement pair and it turns out they had just marked everything down that morning. I had been keeping my eye on the Vince bomber, and everything else was just gravy. Paid less than $700 for over $1600 in face-value clothes. And they made good on the jeans."

Don't want to deal with lowballers on Grailed as I'm quite alright with keeping, hit me up if any of this interests you.  Junya Watanabe patchwork jeans - [1] [2] [3] - $200 - size 32, but tight in the thighs for me. Not good for really tall people, inseam's not too long. Might change my mind on selling this one.  SoloIst. large pocket wool pajama pants - [1] [2] - ~$175 - size M, fits 28-32, but very slim throughout the leg. All soloist pants essentially fit a size down from my experiences. Would recommend for a tall size 30 with slim build. Small tear in rear that's been repaired, price heavily reflects this. You won't find this for <$250 even proxied.  number (n)ine birdseye cardigan - [1] [2] - $130 - size 2 (S-M), fits on the small side for me. Been trying to sell this on and off for a while now, very ambivalent. I'd recommend for a size 46, and not for a shorter person. Retailed for around ¥30k, on the cheaper side for n(n).  SoloIst. horse riding jacket - [1] - $250 - size S, fits S-M, a little oversized. I'd like a size up so I can layer under it, right now I can barely button it. Would recommend for a size 44-46. Retailed in the ¥70-90k like most SoloIst outerwear in the early years, I'll see if I can find the tag.  Paul Harnden silk gauze pyjama shirt - [1] - $250 - size L, fits S easily. Fits trim in body, not too long, very slim in arms. Would recommend for a size 46 max, and you can't have large biceps. Condition is quite used -- tears in the silk outer layer around the elbows, and some small bleach dots on the lower left side. This is the rarer color, and the brown one goes for like $450+ in good condition."

malefashion,39pll1,paz4000,-20,Sun Jun 14 12:42:19 2015 UTC,ok ok ok...im done. I subscribed to this subreddit because I thought I'd see some cool clothes I could wear out. But this is absolute bull shit. I mean Im not a fashion major but those were all the same designs with different colors. That chubby dude is a swindler. like seriously he's wearing the same shit I wear but hawking prison jumpsuits. come on

malefashion,39pll1,paz4000,-13,Sat Jun 13 21:45:04 2015 UTC,I understand that. I'm  sure the guy who was wearing the 'please kill me sweater' didn't actually want me to kill him. but this is ridiculous 1)it's literally the same design with different colors...so the fashion version of early 90s mortal kombat  2) The sash is dumb. its just a means to show off his color pallat or whatever and going for a muslim political statement maybe?  I just feel like sensible fashions should be marketed and this just isnt marketable. except for other fashion designers. what could propagate from this? because honestly to me this looks like light armor from the medieval era for the rabble
malefashion,39pll1,FartingLikeFlowers,15,Sat Jun 13 22:16:39 2015 UTC,You really dont get it do you. This isnt meant to look cool or fresh or even wearable. It doesnt matter if it looks medieval if thats the point bevause nobodys going to fucking wear it outside of this runway

There's just nothing being re-purposed in a new, interesting, or meaningful way.  You're still dressing better, more interesting, and with a more specific aesthetic than 90% of people and the vast majority of mfa (and myself.)

However mundane you think something might be, it will be refreshing to someone who's never seen it before. EJ said it was relatable. It's a consistent aesthetic that's achievable with out much money. And I post once a week because of I posted 30 once a month you all would bitch about how many their are.   Thanks for saying I dress better than you and everyone else though. That was nice.

malefashion,39u1th,ThatDrunkViking,16,Sun Jun 14 21:17:54 2015 UTC,"Ok, I think your fits don't really express any exploration. I don't think it looks terrible it just doesn't look like you care that much about fashion. If that's what you want to wear that's fine but I just don't know if it fits in well in this subreddit. I used to dress very similarly when I was really into thrifting and vintage pieces which eventually led me to some designers that take inspiration from this kind of style but add their own style to it."

malefashion,39u1th,EJ-ericjackson,2,Mon Jun 22 07:35:02 2015 UTC,"Honestly, maybe just store these albums for once a month. Even people who have super well regarded style and outfits do not post as much. Leave people wanting more, ya know?  Also the lifting pic is super unnecessary. Let your muscles speak for themselves instead of telling people ""Look, I workout!""   Otherwise everything was the bad type of plain, and I didn't think your gold chain helped. You got the black greasy hair and your very 80's so maybe you were trying for that Miami coke dealer look with it? Your outfits are more high-school/college looking(of the 80's era) and the chain does not seem to mesh with them. I enjoy the colors and patterns though."

malefashion,39l1jn,flrfmp2yashit,12,Fri Jun 12 14:34:05 2015 UTC,how does it look like underwear..?
malefashion,39l1jn,lessthanjake,13,Fri Jun 12 15:36:19 2015 UTC,"Sorry, I probably should have explained more. The scoop/wide collared white tee looks like a shirt meant to wear at night or under collared shirts (hence my claim that it looks like underwear). It doesn't look like it's meant to be worn by itself.  The pants appear to be sweatshorts (?) which just add to that image. The high black socks and tevas (which, I understand is a somewhat common style in this community) just seems to remind of me of high school kids coming to school in nike socks and slides. Not very fashionable, imo.  This is just my opinion."

malefashion,39jc4r,CommanderVinegar,9,Fri Jun 12 03:43:56 2015 UTC,"I think the proportions are off because of the contrast between the tank and the cargo pants. If the tank were looser fitting in the chest it would be okay, or if the pants weren't cargo pants it would also work, but with the tight tank and the bulky cargo pants things look kinda funky.   Beyond that outfit is awesome, colors and the pieces are all nice."
malefashion,39jc4r,vinpannn,1 point,Fri Jun 12 05:52:07 2015 UTC,I was gonna come in here to say the exact same thing about the tank. If it were a looser fit I feel like it would match the cargo pants perfectly. With that said I also think that the silhouette of the pants look a little off with the rest of the outfit but that might just be a matter of personal taste.

malefashion,39jc4r,pewpfeast420,2,Fri Jun 12 08:11:05 2015 UTC,"Good jacket, good tank top. Good range of colours, textures, and tones throughout the outfit.  I like the idea of pants that are baggy above the knee but slim beneath the knee, but in your case the fabric still bunches and stacks beneath the knee, which kind of defeats the purpose of the above knee bagginess from a visual standpoint.  The shoes are a bit too curvy in the context of the baggy stackiness of the pants. Perhaps try a pair of reasonably baggy harem pants (the ones that are a little bit shapeless, not just drop crotch) in black. Otherwise, you might want to look into some black cargo pants. Fill out the pockets to get the silhouette you're after, and perhaps tuck the pants into your socks to bring some narrowness into the silhouette as you go down. If not that, then swap out your shoes for something cut a bit higher, like geobaskets or Nike SFB's in black."

He wears dirty ass old white shoes (much dirtier than yours)... and the one shirt I've seen him in looks ragged like the two tops you are wearing, though the jacket he wears is very different.

malefashion,39hf0y,JamesLW86,5,Fri Jun 12 00:27:37 2015 UTC,"I think both the layering and the colour choices are well done, especially when seen from the side profile. Look at the where all the horizontal lines are in this picture - the roll in the pants, the bottom of the first shirt, the bottom of the second shirt, and the bottom of the sleeve. The distance between them seems very deliberate and controlled, yet still interesting and not something you'd see everyday. Looking though the other comments though some other people have brought up points I think I agree with, in particular the pants would probably look better less creased - not iron smooth, but just less ""these were in a ball on my floor"" looking. Overall I just think it's an interesting looking, fairly well done fit."

That tshirt looks filthy likes it's covered with dirt and grease but that might just be the lighting combined with all the wrinkles. Everything is wrinkled.  And not in a ""fashionable"" way.  More of a ""I never wash my clothes way"".  Check out the collar of the tshirt... it's all fuckin bunched up like it was rolled in a ball and thrown in a corner for a week. Looks like he's trying to hide his black socks... but he's failing miserably at that.  Failing to hide black socks while wearing white shoes just creates a ton of unintentional contrast at his feet. The top layer just looks like it's really, really small for him.  It's obviously short in length, but it's the super short sleeves that get me.  They not rolled up at all and the cuffs barely make it pass his elbows.  It's just too fucking small... kind of like a homeless person might wear because they have no other options.   There is nothing inherently wrong with larger, drapier fits.  But that fit combined with filthy and super-wrinkled clothes does not look good."
malefashion,39hf0y,callmeRichard,2,Thu Jun 11 21:40:07 2015 UTC,"I'm not mad about your opinions. The top layer is quite short and has cropped sleeves. I usually wear it with slimmer fits. That t shirt is really light, so it sits funny sometimes, and it was pretty windy. But it's the apc kanye camo tee, which is dyed inside out which is why it looks splotchy. Those shoes are a tan elk leather, so they appear off white. And the pants were actually in a ball on the floor. You got me there."
malefashion,39hf0y,Flux-knot,5,Thu Jun 11 23:32:27 2015 UTC,Yeah dude...  The reason the shirt looks muddled makes sense now.  And I noticed in one of the other comments that the top layer is just cut that way because that's how it is.  But those pants wrinkles are deeepppp... so they look messy instead of casual.  But the pair of pants I'm wearing tomorrow actually fit pretty much the same.  I'll have them cuffed that high and everything.  Looking at individual items I like the shoes the most.  But I just think the black socks sneaking out the top look bad.  But that's sort of a pet peeve of mine and may not bother others nearly as much.

malefashion,39b7f4,ooib,1 point,Wed Jun 10 16:22:51 2015 UTC,Your thoughts? Might pick up a pair as an investment piece
malefashion,39b7f4,therealsilkyjohnson,3,Wed Jun 10 17:24:09 2015 UTC,"Sold my pair for around 400 brand new but that was before the news of KVA shuttering. I agree with /u/guly5ever that they are indeed quite heavy and basically boot-like with their size and heft. They do indeed run large so size down anywhere from 1-2 sizes. The zippers are bit hard to maneuver and the laces a bit difficult to re-arrange/lace but overall a great shoe. The leg opening is also larger than expected and my Ace Cashes got swallowed kinda, so look out for that if you want stacking. Looked great with an olive top/black bottom as was seen in one of the pics posted up awhile back. You can snag a pair on Grailed or off Farfetch I'm sure."
malefashion,39b7f4,guly5ever,1 point,Wed Jun 10 23:24:42 2015 UTC,"That was actually my reasoning, I saw he was pressing pause on the label so I decided to finally buy some. Saw a pair for 30% off on antonioli and pulled the trigger.  They're high-quality, quite heavy and look quite big when worn, so I'd recommend getting some if you have some bulky outfits to pair them with.  The laces are also so long that you can effectively wrap them around the tongue so that it doesn't stick out like it does in this photo.  Overall they're a pretty nice piece with a fair amount of future potential."

malefashion,3990hw,Foocup,14,Wed Jun 10 03:08:59 2015 UTC,In general I'd suggest sizing up at least once if you want a fit like Disick's with the 15.5.

As usual interviews serve to see are you a good fit for the position and would you work well within the company culture.  With regards to the weather you can either stunt hard potentially disregarding the hot weather (I cant imagine the interview lasting significantly long). Or just pair down what you wear to better suit the temperature.

malefashion,394ae5,IsGonnaSueYou,9,Tue Jun 9 03:55:14 2015 UTC,"for around $200   Your budget is why I'd tell you to try this in MFA.  I'm not trying to be arrogant, it's just that most in this sub have a frame of reference filled with high-end brands, and most of them don't make derby shoes under $500.  The only thing that comes to mind for under $200 is Dr Martens, but they have a very distinct look which might not be what you're looking for.   looks too dressy   If these are your first leather shoes, I'd say save up for the best you can afford, and enjoy the quality and elegance that a pair of high-end derby shoes can offer, and go for dressy shoes, so you can also wear them for those occasions.   If you didn't yet, you can check www.thecorner.com and browse within your category.   Taking a look, I immediately stumbled on these - Officine Creative is about as good as it gets. If you don't buy them, I might :)"
malefashion,394ae5,alexwoodgarbage,2,Tue Jun 9 09:31:01 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the advice. I went ahead and x-posted to MFA. I was hoping people here might have enough experience with APC to be able to tell me if the build quality is worth it at 50% off. While the shoes seem very nice in person, I was thinking someone here might have more detail.  And while I appreciate the build quality and lasting power of $500+ shoes, they're just not for me at the moment. I don't make enough to justify spending that kind of money on any shoe when a ~$200 shoe is still going to be very comfortable and last a long time. I don't really have any situations where I need to dress very professionally, so I'm not worried about having dress shoes either.  Dr. Martens are alright, but finding ones with black soles and stitching can be tough. Plus, would they be as nice as the APCs?"
malefashion,394ae5,alexwoodgarbage,3,Tue Jun 9 11:25:25 2015 UTC,"I don't have experience with APC, so I can't comment on their overall quality. However, I rarely hear negative comments on them. They do look nicer than Dr Martens, imo, but they're almost double the price.  Dr Martens black on black lace-up is a pretty standard shoe, you should be able to find it on their website, shouldn't be more than $140."

Do you think its possible, at all, to even 'try' Paul Harnden. That is buy one or two essential pieces like his mac and see what it looks like or would I have to buy/try entire outfits to get even remotely close."
malefashion,391jn6,HugAndWug,1 point,Mon Jun 8 23:22:09 2015 UTC,it's all good i like talking about clothes.   yeah i think it is. there are tons of shirts that work with the aesthetic that can be used in all sorts of fits (generally white oversized button ups) and most of the pants work well with looser fits. his footwear is a little out there in coherency with other designers but i think it pairs well with an aesthetic like yohji.  so if you can make most of them work without dedicating yourself to that style the only really would be whatever coat you decide to try.

malefashion,391jn6,CheerUpBrokeBoy,20,Mon Jun 8 16:51:21 2015 UTC,"i think they're kinda eurotrashy tbh, their shapes/silhouettes really don't have much going for em and the gold accents are kind of nasty  and i recommend taking a serious look at your wardrobe before getting geobaskets, they don't work for everyone"

Id be afraid to buy something like that that would potentially be regretful way before it fell apart.  if you're looking to spend some money on some sneakers that are hip now but might stay good looking even if theyre not ""on trend"", I feel like Balenciaga Arenas hit a similar nerve."

malefashion,391jn6,_jamesaanderson,2,Tue Jun 9 10:28:34 2015 UTC,I'm going to be in SF. Anywhere cool to shop or eat?
malefashion,391jn6,jrlpauig,12,Mon Jun 8 18:19:53 2015 UTC,"Idk what you like or what your price points are but for shopping here are a couple interesting places I found while I lived there for a few months  Downtown (4th and Market) - All the mall brands are either at the mall at this intersection or have stand alone stores in and around the area. The mall has a Nordstrom which stocks CPs and some other brands like Zara (although you're better off going to their Union Square location since it's bigger and has fewer people). In the area, you're gonna be able to find Uniqlo, H&M, Levi's and a ton more that I'm forgetting.  Maas and Stacks - Nonnative, Robert Geller and most interestingly Craig Green  MAC (Modern Appealing Clothing)- Japanese brands like CDG. Again, interesting place that stocks brands not commonly seen available to try on in person in SF, as far as I could tell  Acrimony - Cote and Ciel, Chapter, some Rick, Wings + Horns, Alexander Wang  Azalea SF and Rand + Statler - Phillip Lim, John Elliott, Acne are the highlights. Both cater for streetwear with Azalea being the lower end sister shop to Rand. They're next door to one another.  Barney's - Like Barney's in other parts of the States but on crack. Many high end brands and things like Public School. Cool to just go and browse.  The Archive - Similar to Darklands but in SF. If you're into black everything, this is the place. Guidi, Julius, etc.  Taylor Stitch - American made OCBDs, chinos, etc.  Unionmade - Probably the best workwear store in SF. Sells typical stuff like Filson but also things like Kapital. Also gets interesting make ups of Aldens.  Self Edge - Definitive denim store in SF. If you're one of those people who say ""I can never find a pair of jeans that fit we right"", take a look at this place. Flat Head, Roy, 3Sixteen, Iron Heart."

malefashion,38zfbf,Alf_Alfa,13,Mon Jun 8 03:18:14 2015 UTC,The top block is really good and i like the palette a lot. But the bottom half just doesnt have the same vibe (tbh im not even sure the pants have the same vibe as the shoes). You should try to dress the bottom half with more pale colors or earthtones.
malefashion,38zfbf,sourwurms,7,Mon Jun 8 03:59:30 2015 UTC,"I think the sweatshirt is earthy enough. It's the white shirt that's throwing everything off form me. Pants fit with the shoes in silhouette but not in detailing, but it's not discrepant enough to bother me."

malefashion,38yg9f,Rogue_Pixel,11,Sun Jun 7 22:28:01 2015 UTC,How did you decide to wear those shoes? The shoes feel too clean and stand out too much compared to the elegant sloppiness of the rest of the outfit. That's just my opinion though.

Sometimes they're not the best choice, but I just can't stop wearing them.  edit: it seems my comment is being inferred as rude or knocking on OP, and that is definitely not the intention.

malefashion,38xc4n,benj1623,2,Mon Jun 8 11:48:22 2015 UTC,"Can't say I know either. Honestly though, it strikes me as a strap for the sake of having a strap, or maybe for the sake of signalling fashion savviness, kind of like the blogger suit plus sneaker look. I'm not a fan, I think it's discordant and takes away more than it adds here."
malefashion,38xc4n,timmmmmay,3,Mon Jun 8 12:41:28 2015 UTC,"Probably should have posted the back view as well, but the strap goes through the back of the cardigan. Yes, essentially in my wearing its a strap for the sake of a strap. I really liked the dries collection the cardigan is from, but a lot of it is too context/collection specific. I like the strap because its a fun detail that calls to the theme and inspiration of the overall dries collection, but its more wearable in an everyday context than this for instance. This picture is also my first wearing so I'm still trying to figure out what to do with the strap. The way I am wearing it is probably the most ""costumey"" way I could wear it, but I think its fun and different enough to be interesting. And to your comment below, its cotton (tag says Italian yarn for what its worth) not wool, and yes it does feel very luxe, much softer and nicer than any other cotton knitwear pieces I've felt."
malefashion,38xc4n,benj1623,2,Mon Jun 8 19:14:51 2015 UTC,When you look at it in the context of the collection it makes more sense i think

Overall I guess it's just not my thing. I dig the rest though, the wool(?) bomber looks really luxe."

malefashion,38tqpx,artismyhustle,5,Sat Jun 6 19:12:22 2015 UTC,"In the end, what helps workers is economic growth -- Chinese workers have seen conditions improve as their national economy has improved.   Does the case of China show that such ""progress"" improves condition of workers generally, or does it simply show how the exploitation faced by Chinese workers shifted from burdening a certain group of workers to burdening another, non-Chinese group of workers? That is, while the material conditions of Chinese workers may have improved, it is not clear that somewhere else in the world another group of workers hasn't taken on that same burden in order to meet global capitalism's demand for cheap labor.   I am somewhat hesitant to measure the so-called progress of developing nations simply with reference to economic growth, that is, with reference to the abstract logic of global capitalism itself, as opposed to, say, actually existing material conditions. The typical liberal argument here presupposes that where capitalism begins to flourish so too does democracy, which is not only a baseless and unevidenced presupposition, it is one which directly conflicts with what we actually see happening in China. What you get is not western-style democracy but ""capitalism with Asian values"": the rule of capital combined with and actually flourishing under traditional structures of totalitarianism.   That said, I do agree that boycotting or ""voting"" with your consumer choices is not the answer, given the usual argument that it doesn't actually change things and only really functions to make the consumer feel good about themselves (and in that sense seems very, very dangerous, especially nowadays when millennials in the western world seem to have far more faith in this sort of consumer pseudo-democracy than they do in the process of actual democratic elections).  All in all it seems like a very sticky situation. I don't know what is to be done."

malefashion,38tqpx,eccentrica,2,Sun Jun 7 02:27:30 2015 UTC,"I dont think the answer is is boycotting companies that use sweatshop labour or campaigning them to move their operations elsewhere.

malefashion,38tqpx,eccentrica,1 point,Sun Jun 7 02:48:01 2015 UTC,"Thanks for sharing your thoughts. I also think we should start thinking and talking about clothing like we are with food.   And yeah, I don't think that voting-with-your-wallet is enough, there has to be policy and structural change, but I think your ideas are great. Exploring alternatives, while ultimately not enough, at least get people thinking and talking about this stuff, as seen with food.   It seems like what's crucial in the Slow Food movement is relocalizing production and reengaging people with the process, building a relationship between the consumer and the production. Regular people like myself are getting involved on farms. I never thought I'd do that, haha. I wonder if people would be interested in getting back in touch with clothing production. I am, at least to an extent.   Although not enough on its own, I think consumer-level changes like CSA and potentially a clothing-version of CSA are extremely important. I see it as building a new system that's based on relationship and ethical considerations, replacing the old system. Of course, CSA would carry way less weight if it weren't supporting organic and sustainable farming. I want to see local and ethical raw-to-finished goods production of clothes. And this is where it gets gray and my knowledge limited, but I want to see governmental support for ethical production of food and clothing. I'm not sure what that would look like though. Or maybe restrictions on nonethical practices (this I know nothing about). Do you have any experience or thoughts with this?"
malefashion,38tqpx,timmmmmay,14,Sun Jun 7 04:30:37 2015 UTC,"Stupid article title notwithstanding, I'm glad that supply chain issues are getting more awareness. It's actually insanely hard to control the practices of parts of the supply chain beyond the first tier.    Though it may seem shocking that a company so publicly committed to fair labor practices could have such violations in its production chain, the news is less surprising when taking into account how the apparel industry operates: with unwieldy, complicated supply chains that reach around the globe. And, considering this, the findings of Patagonia’s audits take on a different cast, a sign not of corporate hypocrisy, but of the near impossibility of treating workers well at every step in the production process, even when a company is genuine in its desire to do so.   Also, the article mentions Taiwan, which does have a lot of what essentially amounts to slave labor. We're by all other accounts a first world country. Goes to show how rampant this behavior still is."

malefashion,38tqpx,kpals,3,Sun Jun 7 11:34:33 2015 UTC,"So I'm not sure how I feel about sweatshops. Don't get me wrong I don't think anybody deserves to be treated so poorly, the issue is that if there were not sweatshops, what would these people be doing. For most they would likely be unemployed and starve. We can probably pay them slightly more but at some point it becomes too expensive to manufacture in third world countries, and we are back to unemployed starve to death. So there certainly is a middle ground, however it probably isn't a solution, we pay the workers just enough so that manufacturing is still slightly cheaper over seas. We could probably take this money from sweatshop owners who probably make tons of money. Unfortunately this is a disincentive to owners fewer new sweatshops will be opened, people starve and die. I really don't see a solution."

I have no experience with Margiela, but it is licensed to OTB which owns Diesel and produces clothes for Dsquared, Marc Jacobs Men, Just Cavalli, and John Galliano.  Acne is a big creative company and the clothing line is merely their most famous brand.  They make their jeans in Italy and source most of their fabric from Turkey and China.  The chance that any big fashion brand is using questionable labour, whether knowingly or not, is quite high considering the complexities of global supply chains."

That pale/loose look has become quite popular in the East, and is coming to the West.  Also, regarding your comment, I get that pale, tall and skinny asians with buzzcuts aren't common in the West, but the fact that you are comparing them to ""Auschwitz prisoners"" does kind of counter the ""no hate intended"". I am sure there are many different other ways of describing their look, other than utilizing a holocaust reference."

Honestly, never take shit I say personally, cuz I don't take what others say personally, I think you can learn 10 times more from someone you disagree with the someone you agree with, even if it is just through self reflection and questioning.  Good news is I get a little time off and I might be going to a few functions so I should be able to dress all fancy pantsy again and post some of that shit (my current wardrobe is hoodies and sweat-pants, or work clothes, do to my 50+ hour- work weeks)   mainly though, wanna thank all of you for welcoming me (or even no-so-welcoming me) into the fold, I had honestly given up on fashion for a lot of reasons but I still find a reason to pursue it partly in thanks to finding this sub, I hope if anything, I can at least accomplish my goal of causing people to question,  thanks for the love <3"

Obviously this isn't the case when it comes from within the culture (reclamation is a thing), but I'd be wary of how you engage with terminology and the culture in general (avoiding terms like ""cholo style"" regarding the way you button your shirt, etc.).

malefashion,387rgz,Erdnal,14,Tue Jun 2 13:32:58 2015 UTC,"To keep it simple and not delineate from their working relationship back then in Dior,  DH made a name for itself through Hedi's sensibility and design in menswear. It brought the skinny jeans look, slim blazers and pretty much what you might see in the current slim fitted menswear trend (I might have given him too much credit here). Anyway, Hedi's DH was cutting edge and ahead of its time.  In contrast, the razor sharp Hedi's DH silhouette still remained popular but KVA brought in a his own sensibility contrasting the rock n roll inspired pieces during Hedi's time in DH. Tapered trousers are loosened, jackets became more roomy and the sportswear silhouette became quite an iconic shape during KVA's reign. Honestly speaking, I would put much credit to KVA for bringing in the chunky sneaker and trouser look.  I would say Dior Homme is seemingly more inspired by KVA's mainline (R.I.P) :( rather than the reverse. The current Dior Homme have shifted away from the darker silhouette during Hedi's era and KVA has brought in a lighter color palette which is often seen in his own mainline.   What I would advise you would be to check out DH's collection from 2001 all the way to the current season and find your own personal opinion. Find contrasts in their collections, their iconic pieces, what led them to success etc. Check out Hedi's visual diary online (he's a photographer) because its very inspirational for me :)   p.s. I got a interview with Alex McQ in their retail section soon i'm super stoked. (never been into McQ much but always found his work inspirational) I'm currently frantically going on tumblr and other resources to expand my fashion knowledge of Alex McQ lol help me out anyone?   edit: removed unnecessary info"

malefashion,387rgz,syahrulanuar,3,Tue Jun 2 14:40:39 2015 UTC,"Youtube is a great place to find previous collections! I personally like to browse around tumblr and find more iconic pieces/collections coupled with great photography.  DH 'Luster' and 'Follow Me' IMO are Hedi's most prominent collections during his time, perhaps characterized by his phase into the euro techno/electronic scene which later shifted around 05 'In the morning"" collection. This shift became a sign of his current rock n roll sensibility found in later DH collections e.g. 'Navigate' and canonized towards the very western Saint Laurent Paris look e.g. biker jackets, chelsea boots, distressed jeans etc.   KVA grew up with a sport-ish background which clearly reflects the entire current DH silhouette. Slim fitted, but less so. Finding a personal opinion is a great way IMO, my entire text was just me typing out what I felt about Hedi's and KVA's work, people who I admire a lot.   Anyway try to find some really good photos, browse forums e.g. styleforum's thread on DH etc and dig this sub more :)"

malefashion,3871e5,do_not_call_it_swag,2,Tue Jun 2 11:55:39 2015 UTC,"(I'm awful at giving instructions, but ill try my best) to make this shape, you basically have 3 panels, the long panel, (used as the back and flap to close the bag) the short panel (the front) and the strip along the sides, that creates the depth in the bag.  there are two ways you can approach it, A) disassemble the jeans first, then using a basic pattern, (or if you are confident in your ability to sew then you can maybe do it without the pattern) cut everything out, or B) cut the parts you need directly out of the jeans, saving any of the elements and decorative seams for the bag.  I recommend also going and buying either a cheap table cloth from a thrift store, or a few yards of cheap muslin to do a few tests if you've never made stuff like this before, well your there pick up a few closures, studs, whatever you want to make it a little more ""bag-like"""

My personal standard is that pants are too tight once the curves of the thigh and / or calves become quite clearly visible. Not a bad look, though.   Really small point on the shoes. I think SLP has a little trick that makes dressier shoes and boots look good with jeans: if you look at most of the derbies and oxfords they've made, the soles are very understated, sometimes ending before the toe does. All this adds to the daintiness of the shoes. I've never really liked seeing docs with skinny jeans, and here I think SLP improves on the original."

malefashion,3826t9,truthfulie,1 point,Mon Jun 1 23:37:07 2015 UTC,"I disagree... synthetic fibers are easily put into the dryer. people need to READ the tags on their clothing. Pre shrunk items can be put in the dryer with no fear. Wool items and things like cashmere, angora, and mohair must be laid flat to dry or hung up.  Sometimes it's good to pin block them (people have told me they don't have time for that, but truly it's the only way to handle some garments)"
malefashion,3826t9,jpthehp,1 point,Thu Jun 4 18:37:12 2015 UTC,"I never said they couldn't be. Sure they can be, but that doesn't mean you should. Machine washing and tumble drying will cut down the life of every garment, period. Now for some items this could mean you get 10 years out of it instead of 15. And for others it might mean ruining it."
malefashion,3826t9,Baddarn,1 point,Thu Jun 4 18:57:55 2015 UTC,point taken but Still anything with natural fibers needs to be BLOCK dried. or PIN tried ...pinned out into the shape you want it to keep. Hanging it can do damage especially if it's woven or knit.

malefashion,3822yp,VictusPerstiti,13,Mon Jun 1 09:16:48 2015 UTC,"Seconded. Describing why you chose the pieces you did and what you were trying to achieve with a fit is really useful, at least in my experience, since we don't normally do it outside our own minds. That sort of self-reflection would really help discussion here, I think."
malefashion,3822yp,joehatespotatoes,3,Mon Jun 1 09:26:02 2015 UTC,"Plus, one of the most important reasons behind an outfit is trying to convey something, so at least unconsciously we already make a context or goal or whatever for a fit so explaining it helps critique it on whether the fit accomplished the goal or not."
malefashion,3822yp,VictusPerstiti,4,Mon Jun 1 11:12:50 2015 UTC,"In this vein of thinking, would requiring deeper critiques and praises also be appropriate? Cull comments like sick or this sucks  and allow deeper explanations of why these sentiments might be true to be more common or encouraged?"
malefashion,3822yp,jrlpauig,14,Mon Jun 1 10:51:35 2015 UTC,"deeper critique and praise is always better, but i personally only have a problem with negative unexplained comments."
malefashion,3822yp,VictusPerstiti,4,Mon Jun 1 11:10:35 2015 UTC,"I think the community should look negatively on any post that provides criticism that isn't constructive critique. From my perspective, this sub is far more likely to drive itself into obscurity by being hostile towards new users than it is to become some sort of ""MFA 2.0"". There's clearly a different sense of style and fashion here but when you treat people trying to make changes that move them in a more /mf direction like shit as the only community on reddit that is supposed to appreciate that sort of thing, you're effectively cutting off the lifeblood of the subreddit."
malefashion,3822yp,SirSourdough,4,Mon Jun 1 11:48:28 2015 UTC,"I'd honestly be fine with users being more conscientious with their upvotes / downvotes. Stop downvoting unliked fits, start upvoting high effort comments, start downvoting low effort comments."

malefashion,3822yp,InvasiveSpecies207,12,Mon Jun 1 16:31:59 2015 UTC,"Only posted on here once or twice, and viewed from afar for a short amount of time, so forgive me in advance if this thought is off base, but I think the ""MFA 2.0"" concerns come with a bit of a pot/kettle scenario; someone who posts a workwear fit gets shunned for a simple or tired aethstetic, then someone else posts a fit consisting of: ma-1 + unstable tee + form fitting jogger. while people can definately look good and execute this well, it's not ~new~ anymore (and IMO, that's okay). In regards to identity, people have to decide if they're comfortable forcing avant-garde or comfortable in the fashion du-jour, or both. More probing and discussion goes a long way towards enriching a forum like this but that level of exclusion has to be all or nothing to be pointed.   At the very least, bland ""this sucks"" posts are about as worthless as it gets. If you have the time to be negative at least explain yourself. even ""I cant figure out why but I hate this"" has slightly more contribution value."
malefashion,3822yp,InvasiveSpecies207,4,Mon Jun 1 15:49:17 2015 UTC,"If I'm understanding you right I think we're actually agreeing, especially regarding the lack of ~new~ness of certain aesthetics (which imo everything that has been said about the basic fit has been said).   I think that when the situation you describe happens, it's usually because the workwear fit just happens to strike more viewers as boring. Just like how you can make goofninja more interesting than black ma-1 + tee etc., I'm sure there's a way to put spins on workwear as well.  With that being said, I think the most interesting posts are the ones that hop aesthetics, or combine disparate elements you wouldn't expect. Some dude posted an all-black fit with a MA-1 and a jumpsuit or something a while ago, and it was awesome. Like who the fuck does that? Personally that's the type of shit I like seeing in this subreddit.  Agreed on the last point as well."
malefashion,3822yp,InvasiveSpecies207,4,Mon Jun 1 17:24:51 2015 UTC,"Oh the fits where someone takes ""the norm"" and adds something are absolutely necessary & great without a doubt; that's the kind of content that moves the ideas forward without making them feel like they happen in outer space."
malefashion,3822yp,BrickbirckBrick,1 point,Mon Jun 1 17:31:46 2015 UTC,"That honestly depends on which norm we're looking at. Using some brands I've been digging lately as an example, outfits in the full Haider Ackermann / Ziggy Chen aesthetic are not really in the norm in any of the popular online fashion communities, but I'd probably jizz if I saw someone do it really well here. I personally think there's nothing wrong with leapfrogging, it'll make for interesting discussion at the very least."
malefashion,3822yp,InvasiveSpecies207,1 point,Mon Jun 1 17:45:31 2015 UTC,"It's a bummer that Ackermann costs so much because the clothes are gorgeous. No second hand market developed yet either, so it's tough to find a piece to play with without committing 4 digits."
malefashion,3822yp,BrickbirckBrick,1 point,Mon Jun 1 19:28:06 2015 UTC,"It's unfortunate for us non-1-percenters that it's positioned as a luxury brand with luxury markups. Really liked everything I've seen in person, didn't like how a basic long sleeve runs $800. No idea who's buying it though."
malefashion,3822yp,shitsfuckedupalot,2,Tue Jun 2 04:26:17 2015 UTC,"I feel like part of the reason we wouldn't want to become mfa 2.0 is because mfa already exists.  Even if a modern workwear fit and one like you described both don't really push or advance any boundaries, I'd argue that the latter would fit in more here just because mfa already exists to discuss the former.  Sure, it isn't necessarily ideal, but he might still have interesting, unusual ideas and justifications for his outfit that would make it fit in better here. Note that this is also true for the other outfit, which is why I go back to the point about mfa already existing."
malefashion,3822yp,vetement_pour_homme,6,Mon Jun 1 16:41:55 2015 UTC,"you're absolutely right about the latter fitting in, but I would argue that the concept of fitting into a pre-carved niche is the draw to MFA, wheras the draw to this sub is boundary pushing / risk taking. The way I see the trajectory of modern styling is such that as the (forgive me, lack of a better general term) health-goth look becomes more common, the more it fit's into the discussions and tutorial nature of MFA, and perhaps the less it fits into here if only because it's already been explored. By model of your last bit, perhaps MFA would serve the blue oxford crowd, MF would serve the black denim / common projects crowd. but at that point is the spirit of experimentation in tact?   (also thanks for your reply, it's nice to have an outlet for discussion about this kind of thing!)"
malefashion,3822yp,shit_taste,6,Mon Jun 1 17:17:19 2015 UTC,"Red queen hypothesis in fashion. Definitely agreed, if you think MFA's reception to Rick can be chilly at times, imagine what it was like five years ago.   I would argue that the concept of fitting into a pre-carved niche is the draw to MFA, wheras the draw to this sub is boundary pushing / risk taking.   Agreed 100% on this."
malefashion,3822yp,Sir-Mustache,3,Mon Jun 1 17:29:53 2015 UTC,"You're definitely right in that one, constant Rick based fits do get boring. I think it's more of an issue of having realistic expectations.  We're not fashion robots, we like seeing things were familiar with and we desire to fit in just like MFA does, we just do it differently.  I think change and innovation ARE happening, it's just gradual, and can manifest itself as more of the same"
malefashion,3822yp,joehatespotatoes,9,Mon Jun 1 18:28:48 2015 UTC,"Another thought I had relating to the lack of ""guidelines"" in this subreddit: many of the more knowledgeable users have, for one reason or another, stopped posting here for a variety of reasons, including but not limited to preferring other communities, wanting to avoid toxic comments, whatever. As a personal example I don't really like posting waywt's here because the feedback I get here (vs. somewhere like Styleforum) isn't very useful. Either I get upvotes and lots of people commenting 'sick,' or I get downvotes and lots of people commenting 'this sucks.' I've tried to make a point of giving specific and actionable comments, and I think in general comments have gotten a bit more useful in recent months, which is a plus.  That sort of rambled, but what I'm saying is that I feel that people who bitch about stuff not ""fitting"" with what they want to see in MFA should just post more waywts themselves. It's imo the most direct way of enacting the change you want to see yourself."

malefashion,3822yp,SirSourdough,5,Mon Jun 1 21:35:02 2015 UTC,a certain black-loving community   for the love of god man... phrasing.
malefashion,3822yp,BrickbirckBrick,4,Tue Jun 2 01:07:28 2015 UTC,"The reason I came to /MF is because I love fashion and I feel that I have a solid understanding of how clothes work together and a good understanding of my style, but I have never posted here because I always got a vibe of, ""you need to have a curated, revolutionary style that makes you peacock in a group of people."" And so I feel like if Im not an aspiring fashion designer then my fits would be ripped to shreds (hence why i have never posted to this sub until now) And while I would love to see more of those hyper-unique styles because those almost always looks awesome! This sub is already slow as it is and reenforcing that vibe of ""pros only"" with writing this post in hope to change the culture of this sub then this is going make this sub fade out, which would be a real shame. I think if anything we should relax a bit with how serious some people take their outfits, I think it's awesome that people could have a story behind it or the ability to articulate why they chose why they wore what they wore, but I don't know if you put a gun to my head I could come up with a reason I picked to wear my Nudies today instead of my Outliers. Idk maybe that just me, but I just wanted to through that opinion into the mix."
malefashion,3822yp,joehatespotatoes,2,Mon Jun 1 16:56:15 2015 UTC,"I think this is where we have to agree to disagree. I definitely see the merits of your point of view but my personal opinion is just that if you want to chillax and wear comfortable, good-looking, brainless stuff, why not post in MFA where you'll likely get the type of feedback you're looking for?"
malefashion,3822yp,SirSourdough,4,Mon Jun 1 17:26:06 2015 UTC,"I agree that this subreddit is more geared towards the experimental stuff in fashion. I think the reason that people don't want to see things like what was posted earlier because the subreddits quality will fall. It's what happened to 4 Chans /fa/ the quality of the content fell and everyone abandoned it, it pretty much became MFA 2.0. There are still a few good fits here and there but not like it used to be. I enjoy seeing the more diverse outfits that aren't your basic run of the mill jeans and a t-shirt. I feel like people's fits should explore un-traditional cuts of clothing and relate to current trends. The post that was posted earlier was not a quality post in my opinion, it looked to basic and doesn't relate to current trends, there is nothing edgy or diverse in the fit. If your fit is heavily criticized, you should change the way you are going about things. Personally I think that if your fit is shit it deserves to be called out and that's what I liked about 4chan. Reddit plays favorites and if you go to MFA a few users have decent fits but most are cookie cutter and basic. I feel like people of this sub want to avoid that cookie cutter look and branch out."
malefashion,3822yp,truthfulie,10,Mon Jun 1 10:17:21 2015 UTC,"if your fit is shit it deserves to be called out   I'd prefer if this board didn't really have this attitude. Fashion is such a subjective thing that discussion on why the pieces were chosen and what the intent was behind the form goes a lot farther than ""I don't like thing."" I agree with you that more experimental fits tend to be more my sort of thing, but clearly, (for example) enough people like u/retro_specs's stuff enough to comment and upvote it considerably. We just already have enough of a reputation for being unwelcoming and mean, it seems, and I'd like to  see that change."
malefashion,3822yp,SirSourdough,5,Mon Jun 1 10:38:57 2015 UTC,"I fear without calling people out though you will start to see a large about of ""shitposts"" though. That look like they came straight from MFA."
malefashion,3822yp,SirSourdough,6,Mon Jun 1 11:08:01 2015 UTC,"There's more than one way to ""call someone out"" on a fit though.  I think that people need to lose the attitude that the OP in a thread is providing the content. On the best subreddits, the OP is only part of the content, with fruitful discussion and critique in the comments. Telling someone that their fit is shit is useless to them, creates a toxic attitude in the sub, and drives people away.   If you want to be a subreddit dedicated to experimental or progressive fashion you have to be willing to accept that the line is different for different people and there's only a limited number of people who are going to dress well in the particular way that you like. I think it would benefit the subreddit greatly if people were more openminded and constructive. ""Shit"" and ""basic"" aren't helpful for someone looking to dress more progressively, particularly when they feel that they have moved away from what might be familiar to them or far outside the norm for their area (not everybody lives in an inner city where you can get away with wearing whatever the fuck you want without turning heads and taking shit from people)."
malefashion,3822yp,Discover_and_Become,3,Mon Jun 1 11:38:29 2015 UTC,"I feel like saying that fashion is subjective is sort of a cop out for the fact that we DO have somewhat specific expectations for what should be posted here.  Subjectivity doesn't mean all fits are created equal and can be discussed at similar lengths, nor will any amount of subjectivity make a really basic fit fit in here."
malefashion,3822yp,Discover_and_Become,1 point,Mon Jun 1 16:36:37 2015 UTC,"I don't disagree! I'd just like more polite discussion, rather than the slews of ""this sucks"" comments that happen a lot now."
malefashion,3822yp,Kritios_Boy,2,Mon Jun 1 22:36:51 2015 UTC,"I agree with the calling out in principle but not the implied aggression. I think /u/Discover_and_Become handled this fantastically in one of the posts I linked.  From my perception as a long-term on and off user, right now the sub is a lot less aggressive and edgy, which is a positive change at the very least."
malefashion,3822yp,Kritios_Boy,3,Mon Jun 1 12:03:12 2015 UTC,"I think you need to let go of the idea that this subreddit has some ""standard of quality"" to preserve and look for ways to inject some life into it. A 30,000 user subreddit is a fairly large community, and yet there are 5 day old posts with 2 up votes on the front page. If people want a subreddit that is lively and useful they are going to need to come up with ways to make people feel more comfortable contributing content and participating in discussion regardless of how you might feel about a particular fit."
malefashion,3822yp,bootsnpantsnboots,1 point,Mon Jun 1 11:56:20 2015 UTC,"There's a delicate balance, though. Afaik this community was created with some sort of vague goal which has something to do with Fashion with a capital F. It's just very hard to get a good balance between user activity and staying true to the intent of the sub."
malefashion,3822yp,GraphicNovelty,2,Mon Jun 1 12:05:05 2015 UTC,But concerning balance at this point seems rather pointless to be honest. The sub barely has any new contents being posted. Setting a standard of quality may result in even fewer posts. It feels like people aren't very accepting of other peoples' personal styles and aesthetics which isn't very encouraging. From what I've seen the sub seems to favor certain aesthetics and I rarely see anything different. I feel like the sub needs to provide comfortable environment and be more accepting before concerning itself with quality.
malefashion,3822yp,HugAndWug,3,Mon Jun 1 13:16:03 2015 UTC,"Several things:   I think part of this is just up to personal opinion. Should you post pictures of Toyotas to /r/honda if /r/honda is dying?  I'm less encouraging an adoption of a minimum cutoff of quality and more so encouraging people to spend a little more time and effort to stimulate discussion in their contributions. And maybe self-censor posts that don't have any room for discussion. People being assholes is an important problem, but is honestly unrelated to the point I'm trying to make here.  People constantly say that this sub favors certain looks but whenever this is asked people always point out there's a fair bit of diversity in the top posts. I don't think /r/malefashion likes goof ninja any more than any other fashion board."

But it's boring at the same time, and I never see you pushing development in what you wear. It's not a bad thing, I mean in the end you wear your clothes and I don't so it's your choice, but I'd rather see you post here with something interesting and progressive rather than the relatively simplistic thing you wear every single time you post in mfa waywt.   This is my two cents, vote as deserved, but if it's a bad vote please explain, I would appreciate it."
malefashion,38038y,jpthehp,19,Sun May 31 21:59:45 2015 UTC,"This sort of thing is why I think the subreddit needs to seriously revisit and articulate its posting norms. How appropriate is this subreddit for posting ""personal development"" shit, given that something highly novel to yourself isn't necessarily going to be novel to viewers? And, if the subreddit decides that this sort of post is in fact (not) appropriate, should there not be an accepted standard to compare against? It's gotta suck to contribute stuff like this which isn't horrible per se, and be blasted due to a fuzzy set of rules that are never explicitly described, and only exist in the minds of a subset of users."
malefashion,38038y,timmmmmay,8,Mon Jun 1 00:39:22 2015 UTC,People are just trying to articulate their desire to prevent this place becoming mfa 2.0.

(Google esoterrorism dressed.so if you want proof) and this is my first fit ever in high top sneakers. Two months ago, I hadn't worn a t-shirt in years. Sorry if my shit bums you out, but this is pretty far from what I was used to doing. I think a lot of the interest in my fits on MFA has to do with the fact that I've changed my shit up a lot in the past 6 months.   I'm not going to downvote you for a decently articulated opinion though."
malefashion,38038y,SirSourdough,12,Sun May 31 22:04:58 2015 UTC,"Nah it doesn't bum me out I just feel like every now and then it gets repetitive  Again in the end, it's you and your clothing, not mine. If your more comfy in what you wear, keep wearing it because that's really the end goal for all of us, and it's always good to see someone do well in what they are happy to wear.  This isn't bad at all, if I came across that way. It's nice, again, clean. I suppose ive just become used to it."

malefashion,38038y,KlausFenrir,3,Sun May 31 23:19:19 2015 UTC,Something about those lines. I ran into a guy wearing the Carvaggio sweatshirt and it looked so good.
malefashion,38038y,SirSourdough,-17,Sun May 31 23:23:12 2015 UTC,"What I'm wearing now is hugely different from what I was wearing a year ago.   That's cool. It's still irrelevant to his comment.   Sorry if my shit bums you out, but this is pretty far from what I was used to doing.   Still irrelevant.  Your outfit here just isn't interesting or innovative in the grand scale. A shirt, jeans, and Jordans -- what's interesting about that? I mean, if it was a big tattered shirt with crazy stacked jeans and Jordans, it could warrant a post here (or /r/streetwear).  This isn't MFA where you're getting looked at by people who are just trying to get into the how-to-dress-well scene, it's comprised of people who are looking for something new.  And tbh, I liked your old stuff a lot more. Shirt, jeans, and Jordans may be new to you, but it's not to us."
malefashion,38038y,SirSourdough,13,Sun May 31 22:47:41 2015 UTC,The two quotes that you pulled are pretty much an exactly relevant response to the criticism that he doesn't change his looks up much.
malefashion,38038y,KlausFenrir,-3,Sun May 31 23:40:44 2015 UTC,"How is that relevant? Because he used to not dress that way? That's like someone posting some basic grilled cheese on /r/FoodPorn and then say ""well I only use to make cereal"" when they receive criticism.  The progression is irrelevant -- the product is what matters. He posted a basic outfit and got critiqued."
malefashion,38038y,SirSourdough,3,Mon Jun 1 01:46:09 2015 UTC,"The progression is exactly the thing that the comment he was responding to was about though. Not to mention that progress and comfort zones are pretty relative in fashion. You're right that this outfit probably isn't advancing the limits of mens fashion, and that's a valid critique. But if you are going to be the arbiter of the standard for quality then at least give the guy something tangible rather than ""if you change everything about your style we might welcome you here""."
malefashion,38038y,LilMooseCub,6,Mon Jun 1 02:03:05 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I don't usually post here for a reason. I thought this fit was a little more on point with what goes down here.

From a strictly fashion view saying that is completely fine.  But beyond that you have to understand the microcosm that is Complex and these asinine hyped up claims.  They literally took a Kanye West album title, threw Rick Owens name in there, and then said he defines modern menswear.  It's ridiculous, bad journalism, an exaggeration, and just and over all stupid thing to say.

Basically the big menswear designers of the early 90s and late 80s that did started doing clothing that integrated sportswear influences and new cuts into their tailoring. Fashion for men that sprung out of the fashion world and wasn't tied to entirely to either subcultures or professional life.  Someone mentioned Thom Browne, but that is a really horrible suggestion. Not only did he emerge at a time where menswear within fashion was already a very established category – He is a designer with a very specialized look that while influential never had anywhere near the effect on the culture of dressing for men in general that the designers I mentioned above did."

Quite honestly the breadth of most designers will never be represented in market. It may be easier to say fashion buyers define ""modern menswear"" or at least what becomes accepted by the masses. Also, most men, even the most on point, would never dress fully in only one designer. This is why at the more ""modern"" mass market levels of say H&M, Zara, Uniqlo etc you can see influences of any designer mentioned in this thread.   Defining your own personal style is more important than figuring out what or who defined what's modern. Wear what speaks to you, and makes you feel confident. For me it's RO, Hedi, & CCP and my basic daily uniform is Dior Jeans & Blazers, RO Leathers, CCP boots and a rotation of basic shirts. With few exceptions this hasn't changed for years, and likely won't."

A couple of these can  be helpful but only if you're doing them correctly, and if you're not doing them correctly (but think you are) they can throw you out even worse. Plank/bridge is the best example of this, it can be hard if you don't regularly do bridge to know if your technique is correct, but if you've got it down then yes bridge is very helpful.  Reverse crunches I'd also recommend. There's this one where you get some plastic-rope thing (physio gave me mine) and you do draws leaning on a bench, that helped my shoulders a lot.  If possible I'd see a physio to give you your own personal plan, he helped my posture out a lot."

There are two exercises that if done 15 reps 3 sets a day will improve your posture. Apparently the exercises are important because rather than having to think about standing straight your body will naturally do so.  1) lay face down on a bed or carpet or whatever flat surface you like. Tuck your chin in to your chest. Now arch your back so your torso begins to come off the ground, leading with your shoulders. Keep your chin tucked the whole time. Repeat.  2) again lay face down. Extend your arms out to your sides, palms down. Now pull your arms back so they lift off the ground and then lower them. Repeat."

I just got a job that allows me to purchase higher-end stuff, but I just don't know what direction I want to go. I've been in college with a shoestring budget (and I really mean it - I haven't bought anything in over a year and a half) and the only way to dress reasonably well on that budget is safely - levi's, uniqlo, etc.  I want to stop dressing so boring, and I vaguely know what direction I want to go in (brands like TB, KVA (rip), and BBBF) but I don't know if it will work for me, if it will fit me (athletic build) or anything like that.   I went to Tyson's Corner yesterday to pick up some necessarily boring work clothes (bizcaz, kill me) and left with only a pair of Levi's jeans and a GNC shaker bottle. It was pretty weird - I just felt like nothing I wanted was there.   That was rambling. Sorry."

AND i think its something i think i could do cheaply (see above)."
malefashion,37lw07,HoneyIAteTheCat,1 point,Thu May 28 19:08:54 2015 UTC,"yeah i will probably try out stuff on a light budget, see how it works out. unfortunately i'm not really sure where i can find a similar silhouette  to BBBF/TB for cheap.  also that image is sweet, what's the context for that?"

malefashion,37lw07,SisterRayVU,4,Thu May 28 20:56:36 2015 UTC,"I think BBBF is more forgiving than TB, but I'm sure someone else can answer. You can also ball out in bizcaz, it just takes more work. I haven't gotten anything really cool since I just wear Kamakura for shirts and ties but at some point, I'll buy ACNE shirts or bottoms, Balenciaga, Lanvin, etc., and try to push it."

malefashion,37lw07,buckcub,1 point,Thu May 28 20:38:42 2015 UTC,"Tyson's is kind of a fashion vacuum, which is surprising enough considering the general wealth of the area. I mean you've got the superlux markup brands, but then it jumps right on down to mall-tier. To clean up those bizcaz outfits, check out Nordstrom for some sales (I've seen some good Paul Smith suiting & APC denim there before, nothing right now though). For pretty much anything 'above' that, gonna have to go online, but I've seen some Yohji, CDG, and Acne all used in work-appropriate fits.  Keep in mind, you dress for work only so many hours of the week. How dressed up is this new job? Certain creative/ad/PR/marketing jobs have a bit more flexibility in what is acceptable to wear. Test the waters of new aesthetics in your free time, little by little, and buy for quality (as tempting as Zara or any of that other crap can be, hold off). You know the deal."
malefashion,37lw07,syahrulanuar,1 point,Thu May 28 21:40:23 2015 UTC,"You don't really have to splurge all your cash to get that TB/BBBF cropped aesthetic. Fuck around with uniqlo, get a couple of nice white oxfords maybe a shirt with a french cuff. Get yourself a few pair of different shades of grey trousers and get it slimmed, hemmed and cuffed wherever necessary. Search up TB's styling guide and get your fits tailored accordingly. You don't have to drop 3k purely for an aesthetic. Then again, be mindful whenever you're fucking around with cheaper/mall brands to get that aesthetic and buy quality when you can :)  I was tempted to splurge my savings on TB/BBBF a few months back and I felt that my current age and financial situation would simply not allow me to afford the whole look. Messing around with uniqlo's stuff and wearing a tailored womens blazer helps a lot(I got the sleeves hemmed to show off my shirt cuff), really gives the whole ""pseudo"" tb aesthetic.  And always buy quality when you can."

malefashion,37lw07,thecanadiancook,17,Thu May 28 16:50:16 2015 UTC,"Well that's a loaded question now isn't it?  I guess I will start off by saying I think anyone who likes  or wants to engage in a discussion about fashion belongs here. I think peoples attitudes about you have been brought up before and I don't think anything has changed. Things such as the fit dumps which cause people to search through everything you've worn for two weeks to see the good, the bad, and the ugly. And then your edgy nonchalant attitude that you seem to put in every one of your comments can also be off putting.   So I am not saying that you don't belong here, what I am saying is people would probably be more receptive to you if you adjusted your behaviour."
malefashion,37lw07,Retro_Specs,-14,Thu May 28 18:39:17 2015 UTC,"Youd be surprised what being a nice guy will get you. You'll be even more surprised what being an asshole gets you.

And being callused to the dumb stuff some people spew here doesn't make me ""edgy"" (what is this, 2013?) if people got something to say, so do I."
malefashion,37lw07,thecanadiancook,14,Thu May 28 20:59:19 2015 UTC,"This isnt a nice guy vs asshole kind of situation. This can just be about showing some degree of respect to the community, instead comments that come across flippant and childish.   Look, you asked for an opinon and when you got one you didnt like you immediately became defensive. So it sounds to me, along with your posting that you arent looking for an opinion but self validation. And if you are looking for an ego boost posting daily outfits in a photo with a smile, hair, and your dick than start a tumblr."
malefashion,37lw07,Retro_Specs,-18,Thu May 28 22:40:51 2015 UTC,"Respect is earned hombre, that's day one stuff. First day I came here I noticed you didn't treat each other very well.

malefashion,37lw07,CheerUpBrokeBoy,12,Thu May 28 22:49:10 2015 UTC,"dude, you initiated this comment chain with asking for an honest response, then when someone gets honest with you you pull this ""if you don't like it, deal with it"" attitude? i don't mean to be rude but it reeks of insecurity and a desire for validation.   you come from 4chan (i think), where there really is no community because everyone is a faceless voice spouting their opinions into threads. now we have some semblance of community here (for better or for worse) and it's your right not to care about it but you have no one to blame when you get downvoted or gain a bad rep here. you can't expect respect from others without giving it in return, that's real day one stuff"

I don't know what community means to you, but in my neighborhood it means we look out for one another. There is almost zero light heartedness in this board.

malefashion,37lw07,timmmmmay,8,Fri May 29 17:28:40 2015 UTC,"I'm actually interested in what MF people think of the broader question: what makes something ""belong"" in MF? On a related note, what makes something belong in MFA rather than MF?  I'll keep my thoughts short for now as I'd like to hear other's thoughts, but in my opinion, the most important factor is how stimulating of discussion a fit is. This often entails novelty, but novelty isn't necessarily a requirement.  This thought's been on my mind for a minute now, but I was motivated to make this post by two fits that recently got shat on -- 1 2  (To OP, I do think you have a place on MF, as I think your posts have definitely allowed people to consider style in a different light than before, which to me is the ultimate goal of posting fits here. Personally, though, the volume of fits you post is unappealing to me.)"
malefashion,37lw07,dakaf_fal,2,Thu May 28 18:49:08 2015 UTC,"To put it bluntly, MF is interested in clothing as experimentation while MFA is interested in clothing to fit social standards. MF intentionally seeks to stand out from the crowd while MFA wants to blend in. Both definitely have their favorite looks, but I wouldn't say that either is particularly accepting of styles atypical to the sub.  I think a lot of the difference is price point, since the neophytes who dominate MFA are typically looking for mall brand pricing, while the more unorthodox fits lauded by MF are often linked to a much higher price point. I think it would interesting to see MF & MFA at the same price point since there would probably be a lot more overlap."
malefashion,37lw07,timmmmmay,3,Thu May 28 23:52:47 2015 UTC,"Then, in your opinion, why was this shat on, while this and this are at the top of the month? Lurkers?"
malefashion,37lw07,BrickbirckBrick,3,Fri May 29 04:01:05 2015 UTC,"Couple reasons imo  First, you'll notice that this sub has a ridiculous subscriber:upvote:comment ratio compared to most others. There is a large subset of lurkers, a smaller subset of people who vote, and an even smaller that actually submit and participate.  As far as I can tell the most comments any post here has ever had is this one at 155, and the most upvotes anything has had was this post at 365. You'll notice that while it is really, really cool, its also not particularly avant garde, its a post that is likely to get upvotes from all demographics.  It's also interesting to look at how this post got nearly 1800 upvotes, or 5x the next highest post, because essentially everyone who viewed it upvoted it. That should provide a bit of insight into how many people lurk here vs how many participate.  Also, compare these statistics to other subreddits that are a similar size, like /r/treessuckingatthings, /r/circlebroke or /r/scrubs. The top actual post of all time here wouldn't even be in the top 200 at /r/scrubs, despite us having a similar amount of subscribers and a generally higher active viewer count. To put it simply, pretty much all content here is divisive.  This is why sometimes you see fits that have 40-60 upvotes but seemingly only negative feedback in the comments, since lurkers have votes too.  Additionally, experimentation ≠ completely rejecting societal norms or traditional aesthetic values.  It's like the difference between wearing drapey clothes and wearing ill-fitting clothes. They both reject what is considered standard to some degree, but the drapier outfit does it with more tact.  TL:DR WHY CAN'T WE JUST GET ALONG  I'm just spouting so forgive me if this comes out incoherent."
malefashion,37lw07,timmmmmay,1 point,Sat May 30 02:28:52 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the response. Some thoughts:   While in general I agree that mass appeal drowns out avant-garde, I think in addition to 'avant-garde' being overused and diluted in meaning, it's not in and of itself a sufficient criteria for the ideal /mf post. I think, as I previously stated, 'discussion-prompting' is much better, and sure, avant-garde falls under that, but damn, that's a great coat you don't see every day in that top post.  The second point I thought was interesting was your thought on when deviating on the norm goes wrong. To be, the final, visual result isn't the only thing that bears considering -- the amount of thought that goes into assembling a post should be considered as well. In terms of top posts that look like they didn't have much thought, I actually had trouble finding a good example so I'll use this one, which leans a bit towards the side of imitation than innovation. It looks good, it's ""avant-garde,"" but it sure isn't new. On the other hand, I really like this because it demonstrates a solid understanding and consideration of proportion and pattern. Very few people on this subreddit (or online, at all) can superbly pull off the casual-luxe menswear look and I think this really nails it -- it looks good (better if he'd tuck the damn shirt), it's avant-garde, and it's clear that a fair bit of thought went into it. I guess where I'm rambling with this is that posts should try to be thoughtful, which ultimately encompasses looking good and looking avant-garde (in the most basic sense of the word)."
malefashion,37lw07,dakaf_fal,0,Sat May 30 02:57:32 2015 UTC,"I'd say the first was primarily presentation, and the fact that Reddit loves couples who dress well together. The second one is in the happy medium where MF and MFA interests intersect. It's not particularly interesting, but it has mass appeal."
malefashion,37lw07,timmmmmay,2,Fri May 29 20:51:00 2015 UTC,"so in terms of the standards you described (experimentation vs. fitting in) was this voting outcome ""correct"""
malefashion,37lw07,dakaf_fal,1 point,Sat May 30 02:28:10 2015 UTC,"I'm not convinced that upvotes are an accurate representation of whether a post is successful. Some of the least upvoted threads have the best discussion. More controversial styles also result in a polarized reaction, so there would be a higher number of downvotes. On the other hand, more familiar fits probably get heavily upvoted due to a wider appeal, even if it's not innovative enough to warrant commenting."
malefashion,37lw07,timmmmmay,2,Sun May 31 01:51:46 2015 UTC,"That may be true for the discerning user, but not for people checking out the sub for the first time. It's easy to assume upvotes are an accurate signifier of quality because that's how the rest of reddit works."

malefashion,37lw07,Retro_Specs,-4,Thu May 28 19:51:45 2015 UTC,I believe there is some modern way I wear it all
malefashion,37lw07,klew3,0,Thu May 28 21:20:25 2015 UTC,Yes.  Because you stand out no matter what you're wearing and make things challenging but also achievable. I can see myself wearing everything you wear though many things would put me on the edge of my comfort zone. This is in contrast with a majority of posts in this sub that I wouldn't even consider myself wearing for various reasons (though mostly I'd feel idiotic).
malefashion,37lw07,Retro_Specs,-2,Thu May 28 21:42:45 2015 UTC,"Lol what a relief. I didn't think I was half as out landish as some of the fits I see here. I reserve my opinion because I don't think I stand at any point to try and tell someone they look bad. Because they could really like the way they look. And that's cool, except I think bondage outside the bedroom is a little much and black is a color reserved for a night scene."

malefashion,37lw07,EJ-ericjackson,1 point,Fri May 29 00:22:47 2015 UTC,"loveshinehero, Burt-Slice, Kaelyor, TESLA-fan, and you.  they all tend to post comments/fits that show they follow their own path.  they are fresh, self-propelled posters who are following there own rules, and have a VERY DEFINED style, when I see there fit(s) I can tell it was crafted based on them, and not from looking at look books or other places, they seem like actually creative people.  that said, theres a lot here that really don't like, its too ""trendy"" and takes itself too seriously, and despite the multi hundred dollar labels, the soul in what they do is non-existent, it's fake-   and thats that really, I'm entitled to my tastes, as are people to disagree with me.  and those are just the people i LOVE there are plenty of fits i have seen i like, or like elements of- i post nice things more then I post criticism. but I think MF would be less appealing to me if any of the people I named stopped posting."
malefashion,37lw07,Retro_Specs,3,Fri May 29 05:07:36 2015 UTC,The people who march to their own drum. I can dig that. I can relate. It seems more organic this way. It's the stuff I personally really like.   There must be a place for us.   (maybe I should just go to caretags)

Vest thing is pretty cool and pants look nice, but honestly I'm having a hard time responding constructively to the boots which are clearly the centerpiece. Maybe I'm just previous level. Would appreciate hearing your thought process behind this."
malefashion,37l722,timmmmmay,17,Thu May 28 14:48:47 2015 UTC,"I appreciate your honest comment. I get frustrated with the artificial delineation between male & female clothing. Many of the things we wear today in this sub would have been laughed at a decade ago as too ""gay"" or feminine. Remember the huge backlash against manpris in the 90s, but now every other guy is showing huge ankles.  Are men going to be wearing heels in the future? I don't know, but I like the look of heels, so I thought I should buy some and wear them. They were surprisingly more comfortable then I expected. This was the first time I wore them, and to be honest, most people mentioned the vest more than the boots.   A lot of the things that fall in women's fashion used to belong to men. Heels, makeup, skirts -- all used to be worn by men in western culture. We should be able to take them back.  And holy shit, I'm not a tall guy, but an extra 4 inches is amazing."
malefashion,37l722,timmmmmay,3,Thu May 28 16:51:47 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the response, pretty cool. I'd be interested in how this would look with full-out aggression, e.g. swapping out the tshirt for a mesh tank or something."

malefashion,37fydo,john_ft,9,Wed May 27 13:44:41 2015 UTC,Because it's a basic outfit and safe (which doesn't mean ugly or bad).  /r/malefashion is more about the exploratory side of fashion and self expression through clothing.  MFA uniforms don't really fit that bill.
malefashion,37fydo,TerdSandwich,-5,Wed May 27 17:05:59 2015 UTC,"what makes this fit inherently less self-expressive than a ""malefashion"" one"
malefashion,37fydo,john_ft,6,Wed May 27 17:48:46 2015 UTC,I just explained why.  It's basic/generic.
malefashion,37fydo,TerdSandwich,4,Wed May 27 17:58:14 2015 UTC,"Meanwhile this has 160 upvotes, totally not basic/generic at all, black and white makes any fit interesting and totally avant garde right  You prob like to think you're better than/above mfa but it's where you and so many other people here belong"

malefashion,37fydo,mc-lunar,-5,Wed May 27 14:26:52 2015 UTC,"i don't see how something being ""out of the ordinary"" in and of itself makes it ""better"" in anyway"

malefashion,37fydo,mc-lunar,6,Wed May 27 14:53:35 2015 UTC,"You have to define 'better,' as the two subreddits have two different (and equally valid) definitions. Novelty and creativity play a larger part in one's definition than the other."
malefashion,37fydo,timmmmmay,-1,Wed May 27 15:36:58 2015 UTC,that's my point-- it's completely subjective. no one definition
malefashion,37fydo,john_ft,11,Wed May 27 17:49:27 2015 UTC,"Think you just completely ignored my point, dude. While it's true there is no objective definition of better there are consensus-agreed definitions for use when evaluating fits posted to either /malefashion or /malefashionadvice based on the ethos of each subreddit, and as such something whose selling point is being ""out of the ordinary"" would indeed fit better in /malefashion compared to /malefashionadvice."
malefashion,37fydo,timmmmmay,0,Wed May 27 17:56:38 2015 UTC,"fair enough. what you mean, then, is that's why it's more suitable for this sub. not that it is inherently better in any way just for being ""out of the ordinary""."

malefashion,37fydo,notxavier,6,Thu May 28 01:20:27 2015 UTC,"Don't take what people are saying the wrong way, you look good and it's a cool fit. You don't need to be creative to look good. Go top all time on this thread and you see stuff that is creative but only 0.005 of society have the job, money and physique to pull it off.   You look great, and be happy with what you wear, these subs are always bottomless pits, the second you come you never think your dressing will enough."
malefashion,37fydo,Lets-Tessellate,2,Thu May 28 05:30:05 2015 UTC,"I think the jacket is the coolest part of the fit for sure. If you want to maintain that style but still get a little creative at the same time I say look into some mid-tier or more contemporary pieces, some of them have really cool subtle detailing/texturing that would go well with the current workwear style in this fit.    Other than that it can't hurt to spend your time looking at a ton of inspo."
malefashion,37fydo,HaroldLott,3,Thu May 28 02:26:46 2015 UTC,Super overplayed? Want to know what is super overplayed? The endless black and white outfits on /r/malefashion. And how is that creative? The best way to catch this sub's attention is buy some high end black and white clothes then post that incredibly bland and unoriginal outfit.

malefashion,3772yv,Trosso,1 point,Tue May 26 00:21:46 2015 UTC,I actually like the colors in these shots better than in the original image. Very well put together overall.
malefashion,3772yv,maps1488,2,Mon May 25 18:28:09 2015 UTC,Cheers. I like the latter as well but with the original image not having any color in it from trees etc it's hard to draw anything out so more often than not it's more effective to offset it slightly and add a tone. I went with the original image mostly because I liked the composition as well as the fact that it added a different color when posted on my blog so that all of the pictures aren't running together.
malefashion,3772yv,happytimmy123,1 point,Mon May 25 18:36:54 2015 UTC,"That's definitely understandable; I liked the composition there as well. It just comes down to personal preference for me; some people may not have liked the true colors as much, but I think they work very well here. Not as bold perhaps, but deeper/richer."

Everyone in my life has gotten used to the fact that I'm interested in style, the fact that my style has seen some changes over time is irrelevant because they just see it as me dressing nicely rather than switching from Americana to streetwear etc. I think people who take an interest in style and only see me through my blog or reddit etc are just seeing the change as obvious because that's their only interaction with me.

Gross plastic fake ass pencil mannequins- I wanted PEOPLE to wear my clothes.  so I went to a rehab centre, and a homeless shelter, found me some real people.  scars, miss matched completions, aged, black, white, bad teeth, awful posture, too fat, etc.  I honestly did it as a ""fuck you"" to my instructors, and for personal reasons.  but when you say ""normal people in high fashion"" i dont even know what the hell the difference between ""normal people"" vs ""high fashion people""  is.  unless the implication is that only gross ass plastic Skeletor with more freaking product on their hair and face then god damn Joan Rivers and Oprah Winfrey combined can wear high fashion or dress in that manner,   PS: I actually love Joan rivers,"

malefashion,378fh1,tectonic9,18,Tue May 26 01:38:08 2015 UTC,OMG so true that it's cool to dehumanize people for being attractive and slim! Let's do that to show our moral superiority.
malefashion,378fh1,EJ-ericjackson,-6,Tue May 26 05:49:22 2015 UTC,"the idea is that attractiveness is relative to the viewers preference,  and to be honest, I am slim, 6 feet and only 135 lbs and I hate my body, it is the result of genetic metabolism disorders, and correlating with a larger historical picture, being skinny like that is the result of things such as famine and disease, or in my case, disorders   so i guess the reason i dont find pencil people attractive, is because I am one and hate myself,  do I want to be 500 lbs? no, but a decent balance of comfortably managed bodyfat and muscle would be nice.  in order to make that statement, one has to challenge the norm in an extremist fashion, am i saying all fashion models should be 250 lbs 4 foot tall 60 year old women? not at all.  im saying that there should be balance and variety,"
malefashion,378fh1,tectonic9,12,Tue May 26 06:48:22 2015 UTC,"Gross plastic fake ass pencil mannequins- I wanted PEOPLE to wear my clothes.   I was snarky before, but seriously: I hope you can see that disliking your own body is not a good excuse for saying that conventionally attractive people are gross non-humans. If your goal is actually to showcase a broader variety of body types, or to feature types that you personally find attractive or interesting, do you see that demeaning conventionally attractive individuals does not advance your aim, but merely projects an image of yourself as a hateful person? I hope you're not a hateful person and that you'll use more caution when saying hateful, dehumanizing things about people. Those models you're talking about are people too, and they wouldn't love to be called gross non-humans. Hurling insults at people who work as models doesn't change your own body or society as a whole.  I'm not perfect, and of course I've said some ugly stuff at times too. But please look at your words and consider whether there's hypocrisy and whether the message is really the sort of thing that you want to put into the world."

Chris Palko's new look is fantastic especially because he used to dress terribly, he's quite a large inspiration in a lot of ways to me though, I'm sure a lot of people wouldn't really say his fashion is anything special but if you know his history he and listen to some interviews with him it's actually really interesting looking at how he's dressed at different stages of his life.  Hai from Darker Than Black because deep down I just want to submit myself to goth-ninja overlords and wear black all the time.  Lana Del Rey kills it, she cycles through such a variety of styles too.  All of the fashion in The Americans is fantastic but this shot of Keri Russell is <3    I'm sure there's heaps more I just can't think of right now."

The blazer and striped shirt screams Saint Laurent and would be incredible with black skinnies and Chelsea boots either in black leather or a light tan suede. The sneakers and jeans are more suited to a casual ""pale wave"" fit and would be better with a light blue/green sweatshirt or a white t shirt with an open button down of some kind."
malefashion,36vlpg,Retac,6,Fri May 22 14:46:19 2015 UTC,Thanks so much for the honest feedback. I have a pair of dark grey skinnies that might work.

IMO it would definitely be a more marketable logo if you spelled it right or made it obvious that it was purposeful."

Everything is uninspired and mass produced in China with inferior materials. This being a fashion forum look to innovative designers who specialize in glasses alone such as: Anne et Valentin(my favorite), Thierry Lasry, ic! Berlin. Or whatever your local optician is carrying staying clear from Oliver Peoples, Ray Ban, Chanel etc as everything is made by the same conglomerate."
malefashion,36k7bc,MyFloydisPink,9,Wed May 20 02:04:30 2015 UTC,"An often cited counter argument to your last point is that the conglomerate has different tiers of production, which brands like Oliver Peoples being on the very highest tier. I have ray bans that I bought from my local optician and I couldn't be happier with them, even if they were made by ""the conglomerate"". Luxotica (the conglomerate) is not inherently evil, though they do have a huge market share. If OP wants to look into more specialized smaller markets, perhaps he'd be better of with Salt or Cutler and Gross. Personally I want a pair of Oliver Peoples because I love the designs. OP if you really like a model of Oliver peoples, quality will not be an issue for you. If you enjoy smaller makers and more a more artisanal approach, then perhaps search elsewhere."
malefashion,36k7bc,Retac,7,Wed May 20 02:54:08 2015 UTC,"If you are looking for non-luxotica brands with similar design and quality to Oliver Peoples, maybe check out Moscot."

However I was going off of the assumption of OP having an inclination towards design and a superior product. Oliver Peoples is typically assumed to be among the best in eyewear, when it's really just ""the highest tier"" within the company Luxotica. For the same price point as Oliver Peoples you can get very sharply designed, specialized frames from a company that operates on smaller profit margins because they keep their production local, materials high quality, and designs innovative."
malefashion,36k7bc,MyFloydisPink,1 point,Wed May 20 03:11:38 2015 UTC,"Fair point, just depends on what OP values more. Not even to say that smaller brand styling is inferior, because its not and I happen to love a lot of frames from those smaller brands, but if OP finds a style he loves from Oliver People than quality should not be an issue. You're absolutely correct though that in the price range smaller brands that are more specialized and use better materials are available. The difference between Oliver Peoples and those brands is much smaller than say Oliver Peoples and a brand like Warby Parker where styling and affordability is more important to the company than materials.."

If you like how a particular pair looks, then buy it. If you're buying it for the brand, craftsmanship or ""uniqueness"", then buy it.

The only thing I somewhat agree is that Oliver Peoples are a bit over priced, but even at half the price point market value, they should still cost 3-5 times more than some low quality mass produced frames like Warby Parker. It's the same difference between buying a Fender Stratocaster (Made in USA) vs. Fender Squire (Made in China); or a Macbook Pro vs. a Dell...

I've always thought name brand/hi-end designer always use ""unique"" cutting of clothes stand out – which most of the times mean a plain tshirt costing 200+.  I know fashion people can always come up with reasons to justify that price (i.e. if you support the designer, buy their stuff).  But not everyone is about that plain, completely minimalistic look.  I like Balmain’s styling cue and more explicit details; it feels like what he is going for is easy to understand and less implied.

malefashion,36aq6g,something-ception,21,Sun May 17 20:55:22 2015 UTC,A sizeable percentage of people that buy designer fashion buy it at full price and aren't concerned with the secondary market (grailed forums etc) at all which may have some relevance to your question. I'm sure there are rich people that just picked up iconic Raf bombers that now go for 3000$+ because they popped into a boutique on a whim waiting for a taxi or something and they just sit in closets now
malefashion,36aq6g,mc-lunar,8,Sun May 17 23:47:23 2015 UTC,"From what I understand is that a lot of high fashion labels will host shows or present their clothes at shows. Retailers must attend these shows and personally view the items they want.  They must then decide which clothes they want and fill out an order form, with a minimum purchase price usually a certain number depending on the brand. This can be anywhere from 5-50k. In addition to the pieces at these shows brands will sometimes have commissioned pieces for celebrities or sell their runway pieces at flagship stores only. This is what I learned from having a drink with an owner of a highish fashion store."
malefashion,36aq6g,artfuldawdg3r,2,Mon May 18 01:37:37 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's almost spot on, but I'd like to add something -  If a huge buyer such as Selfridges (UK) or Barneys (USA) saw almost what they wanted, but felt that a few tweaks on the clothing would suit the market better for both the fashion house and the retailers, they'll generally make the tweak. It's not usually anything huge, could be as simple as slightly changing a collar or something.  Source: My father is a buyer for his own company, I attend a lot of these sort of events all over the world."
malefashion,36aq6g,Ellamm,7,Sun May 31 14:13:09 2015 UTC,"Yeah, designers runway pieces are distributed differently. Some brands/stores attend a fast-paced buyers market setting (I don't know the word for this event) where retailers/store buyers buy designs from the brands, mostly rtw. In terms of menswear, I assume most things are rtw and what you see in stores online/in-store reflects solely on what buyers think will sell in their stores. Edit: grammar"
malefashion,36aq6g,amoco18,4,Sun May 17 21:56:15 2015 UTC,"In considering how luxury and ready-to-wear brands distribute their products strategically, it might also be helpful to consider the opposite. How do boutique/contemporary labels as well as mass market labels do it?   At the mass market level, brands like H&M, Topman, and Forever 21 rely on enormous production scales to drive costs as low as they possibly can. This means that profit is driven almost entirely by volume and newness, which requires large numbers of stores, warehousing for large amounts of merchandise, and large-scale logistics to move product from production to receiving to customer as quickly and efficiently as possible. It's not in H&M's benefit to restrict how many retail locations they open; they won't really cannibalize their own business and more locations increases their visibility, further driving sales. At the contemporary level, brands like Theory, Gant, John Varvatos Star U.S.A. tap into medium-size production runs, but leverage savvy marketing and styling to position their brand at higher price point. You can make arguments for quality in either direction given the relatively wide scope that ""contemporary"" can encompass, so let's just ignore that part. For them, volume is important, but a large portion of revenue is often driven by repeat customers who come to associated with a particular value the brand espouses. At the designer level, the market for Raf Simons, Dries Van Noten, and Rick Owens is necessarily small because there are often design choices made in production that necessitate producing smaller runs. The clientele that buys this full price and/or regularly needs to be sold on it (though some already enter a retail established with a strong purchase intent), so instead of the company only selling it through its own channels where it has to pay for and manage the logistics and selling time of the goods, they can opt to wholesale parts or all of their range to third parties.   Some companies do this themselves with in-house wholesale departments while others utilize sales agencies or showrooms. During market weeks/seasons, buyers from third-party stores review collections, place orders, and then pass along the purchase order and merchandise to their sales departments who then stock the product on the floor. In terms of categories, one brand might opt to sell their entire collection to anything who wants it, while others may parcel out different categories. Consider Ann Demeulemeester. Anne Chapelle's plan for growth has been to expand the line in Blanche, and shoes-only AD, which lets her sell a slightly broader range of products to more stores, while protecting the cachet and limited distribution of the mainline. (You can argue with how good the products are separately, but we're just talking strategy here.)  Your cost comes at the designer needing to build in a production-to-wholesale markup so that they can sell the goods at a similar price, which then is transferred to customers as a wholesale-to-retail markup. But clientele at this price point can pretty much afford it, so the retailer presents the selling experience as an added value. And with that large of a margin built in, even smaller volume can still generate relatively large revenue."
malefashion,36aq6g,toomuchblack,1 point,Mon May 18 17:46:58 2015 UTC,"Depends on which company you look at, but tbh it's not very complicated.  Established houses tend to limit their distribution to proprietary retail locations, placed in high-traffic, high-income areas around the world. Both for revenue and visibility of the brand.  One tier down from that, there's distribution through preferred retail partners, that following the showing of a collection are allowed to order through catalogue. Usually production numbers will be adjusted based on popularity.  The preferred retail partners buy in, and if it doesn't sell, sometimes will be allowed to ship back what is left for a partial refund.  As for the reason you don't see many of these pieces online for resell, people tend to keep them because they don't want/need to resell, have worn it out or are just completely unaware of a second hand market for expensive designer pieces. And when they are sold, they are sold sporadically and sell quickly (hakama pants...)  This is a noticable contrast from designer bags, that are so likely to be resold that there are retail chains based on this, solely focused on reselling slightly used bags (Milan/Paris/etc station in Hong Kong for example)"
malefashion,36aq6g,alexwoodgarbage,1 point,Wed May 20 11:55:19 2015 UTC,"designer/luxury clothing is often scarce by nature. for raf, there's such a demand for his old clothing relative to the supply that the market is very hot. raf started very small (there isn't any photographic evidence of his first show) and made clothing in very small numbers. he has a cult following that lives and dies by his clothes, which is why people seek them out—the limited quantity with the heritage. but current day raf you can get, you just have to pay for it. but if you buy a 2003 raf bomber from Grailed, he won't see a penny of that of course.   additionally, fashion moves at a really fast pace. designers are always looking forward and the seasonal nature of the business (spring/summer, fall/winter) means they always need to be producing new stuff. raf could technically make all of the clothes he's made in the past, but he never would because that past is the past and it would likely interfere with the market for his early work. but the interesting part is that his stuff wasn't nearly as sought after when he started. he was just a kid in Belgium."

malefashion,362uwm,EJ-ericjackson,5,Mon May 18 18:05:31 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I dyed a hoodie in a bucket with RIT dye. Just followed the instructions. It turned out perfectly, and then I burned a hole in it the next weekend."

malefashion,362uwm,kinguah,2,Fri May 15 19:39:35 2015 UTC,"I tried to dye some tees, jeans, and sweaters with rit dye and it didn't take at all. I left it in for a long time but the color just washed out. I have seen other people have luck with it though."
malefashion,362uwm,Okuu6,2,Fri May 15 18:24:35 2015 UTC,"dyeing has everything to do with WHAT the item is made out of, and what the dye is made out of.  you can find charts on most commercial dyes that will direct you on what to do.  but the basics are simple,   -synthetic fibers = nearly impossible to dye.  -natural fibers = dyeable so long as they are not treated with waxes or other coatings such as waterproofing etc."
malefashion,362uwm,itsall-suicide,1 point,Sat May 16 07:44:54 2015 UTC,It is 100% cotton the only problem is that dyes say not to use on dry clean only materials
malefashion,362uwm,hazillius,1 point,Sat May 16 15:29:35 2015 UTC,"hmmm yea- if i had to guess, reason that is, is that the cotton is treated with some sort of coating, like a starch or a waterproofing.  sorry dude, i think you're SOL"

malefashion,362uwm,Ammarzk,1 point,Sat May 16 21:24:57 2015 UTC,"most likely a stiffing agent then, or who knows, tbh id need to touch it and do a burn test.  worst case? you dye the item and it is ruined, so do what you will."
malefashion,362uwm,OrderOfStego,2,Sun May 17 05:13:01 2015 UTC,"If it's dry clean only, you probably shouldn't. Using RIT dye or the like requires hot water, boiling if possible."

malefashion,3616qe,do_not_call_it_swag,-3,Sat May 16 00:43:38 2015 UTC,"Okay, but just remember that thug alone is not in the ""n-word"" in disguise. As a matter of fact, coining that term with the n-word is itself a complicated level of cultural appropriation.   During British Imperial rule in India, a group of assassin-bandits--known as thuggees--would utilize guerilla-based tactics to fight colonial oppression. The term thug derived from this, so I don't really see it being synonymous with the n-word.  Also since this is /mf, here's some Thuggee inspo"
malefashion,3616qe,HoneyIAteTheCat,8,Sat May 16 05:36:11 2015 UTC,The mental gymnastics you must've done to say that thug is not a racist term toward black people because it originally derived from Indian bandits have earned you a gold medal in the event of cognitive dissonance! Congrats!
malefashion,3616qe,do_not_call_it_swag,-2,Sat May 16 14:45:49 2015 UTC,I agree with you that it is ignorant in respect to it's contemporary use but just take a look at the bigger picture.
malefashion,3616qe,Kritios_Boy,4,Sat May 16 17:22:55 2015 UTC,"Don't even pretend that the contemporary use of the word thug has anything to do with Indian assassin-bandits. That is years removed and a whole new level of bulshit racism cover up. Plenty of other words in English are derived from other cultures. When you hear mass media mention thugs, they are specifically and negatively referring to black people."
malefashion,3616qe,TerdSandwich,-7,Sat May 16 06:17:34 2015 UTC,"You know what they say about assumptions?  I meant the body proportions is what I see, not the title."
malefashion,3616qe,HoneyIAteTheCat,0,Sat May 16 13:32:10 2015 UTC,You can't just remove context from a picture like that. Aesthetics don't work like that. It's still extraordinarily racist.
malefashion,3616qe,TerdSandwich,1 point,Sat May 16 14:43:36 2015 UTC,"You're grasping at straws.  OP looks like his pelvis is unusually low, so I posted a picture of what his anatomy would look like based on his clothes.

malefashion,3616qe,HoneyIAteTheCat,1 point,Sat May 16 15:04:25 2015 UTC,"I'm not grasping at straws and I'm not confused. I understand how his fit reminded you of that picture aesthetically. However, that picture is still extraordinarily racist.  You're trying to remove the context and implications of the picture and say, ""From a purely aesthetic point of view, your fit reminds me of this."" And I'm saying to you that that's impossible - linking to that picture, no matter your intent or interpretation, has racist undertones (and plenty of overtones)."

I'm from Belgrade too and the stuff I saw people wearing last summer is just, I don't know how else to say it but dated? Bizarrely incorporated fads that stopped being popular 5 years before in NA/Western Europe. You can almost always pick out the tourist from a crowd, even if they're only wearing casual clothes.  Of course, you also have the legions of men with the athletic clothes, buzzcut, and horrific little athletic crossover bag. Please tell me that trend is over, because it was everywhere last summer. It's the closest thing I found to the squatting slav stereotype."

A lot of the old trends also has to do with people being poor but wanting to wear expensive clothes and buying fakes, which are, for the most part, old models."

Yes, poverty is probably the reason behind the atrocious trends most of Serbia is plagued with. If there is one good thing fast fashion making incursions into Serbia has done, is offering palatable clothes to the poorer parts of the population.

malefashion,35wnge,FoppishDnD,3,Thu May 14 14:04:07 2015 UTC,"It's sort of judgmental to call them impoverished. As far as I know, it's from a working class subculture, definitely not wealthy, but I'd hesitate to say poor."
malefashion,35wnge,TerdSandwich,11,Thu May 14 20:37:49 2015 UTC,"Why is it patronizing or in bad taste? I see no reason why it couldn't be emulation or simply acknowledging an existing fad, regardless of the nationality of the designer.   When designers borrow from military styles, for example, we don't necessarily consider it critical. Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, right? The only way I can think of it as mockery is if Japanese culture had a reputation for mocking Mexican culture or fashion. I'm not aware of that if it exists.  Even Japanese yankii fashion or lifestyle I don't take offense to as an American. They drop out of school, sniffing glue and chain smoking while wearing jeans and leather jackets. They name this toxic culture after yankee, and I'm still not offended.   What is there to be upset about? That they don't understand you? Can you explain in more detail?"
malefashion,35wnge,FoppishDnD,-6,Thu May 14 15:44:41 2015 UTC,"If you were one of the impoverished Mexican's who came from the areas where this shoe/dance culture is popular, and you traveled to a big city and saw privileged, wealthy people wearing $600 leather versions of your shoes made by some Japanese designer you've never heard of, how would you feel?"
malefashion,35wnge,thasnotme,2,Thu May 14 16:03:09 2015 UTC,"Not being in a similar situation, I can't say how I'd feel. Are you saying that it feels hurtful when someone takes elements of your culture out of their context?"
malefashion,35wnge,FoppishDnD,4,Thu May 14 16:30:39 2015 UTC,"i don't think 'patronizing' was the best word to use, but it's definitely cultural appropriation"

Any time in history that people have been exposed to other cultures it has resulted in an exchange of ideas, aesthetics, words, food, etc. With globalization and the internet, exposure to different cultures and the exchange of cultural ideas is probably happening at a higher rate than ever before, but I don't see why that is inherently bad."

malefashion,35wnge,trashpile,2,Thu May 14 14:21:03 2015 UTC,"I'm not joking.  They're ""Guarachero"" boots, very obviously referencing the Mexican pointy boot fad and the tribal-guarachero music they dance too."
malefashion,35wnge,TerdSandwich,1 point,Thu May 14 14:28:16 2015 UTC,"nah, the theme of the collection is anti-war. medieval shoes were extra long as an extravagance and they were forced to cut the toes off in battle, making the long toe in this case symbolic of peace."
malefashion,35wnge,trashpile,8,Thu May 14 14:34:13 2015 UTC,Did you not read my comment? They're literally named after the music and look exactly like the Mexican boots... like come on man.  I can't tell if you're trolling or being serious.

malefashion,35wnge,trashpile,3,Thu May 14 14:52:09 2015 UTC,"So a random person's review overrides the actual name of the boot and it's indisputable references to a Mexican fad?  I mean if anything you could find some loose connection between anti-war and the cartels in Mexico, but still... I don't get why you're unwilling to accept the obvious."
malefashion,35wnge,fadedsong,-6,Thu May 14 14:54:53 2015 UTC,"sorry, i guess where i'm coming from is that the collection is clearly not a mexican gaucho inspired collection and there's have a boot that exists apparently by itself, devoid of reference except to the pointy boot boys. it's not a random thing out of left field to place it in this collection; it's the only modern reference to something symbolic of the past. the fact that it's a mexican fad is...uh, incidental? it's not like it was taken to reappropriate because it's mexican, it's being used to some other purpose."
malefashion,35wnge,amoco18,4,Thu May 14 15:01:05 2015 UTC,"I get what you're saying, but you can see why someone who's close to the cultural context of the Mexican originals would be put off by what they're doing, right?

malefashion,35qrkk,goodkareem,2,Wed May 13 03:50:02 2015 UTC,"Just made my 90th purchase on grailed awhile back so here are some tips.   1) Message for tagged pics to make sure you arent buying something on its third or 4th resale or if its at least still in condition.   2) If its not shoes or accessories ask for measurements, if its a high dollar item then ask for measurement pics. Try and then to lay down and tape measure on the picture. Make sure and try not to hint at your current sizing although they can prolly figure it out.   3) LOWBALL LOWBALL LOWBALL. Always initially offer low if you get some tagged pics. If you know the sizing of the item or its shoes then offer low and buy right away.   4) Pay attention to the popularity of the item. If its in 25+ dressing rooms then they have prolly made offers. Lowballing wont get you far. Also buying when its in that many dressing rooms in lower risk because you can almost always resell it if you dont like it.   5) Pay attention to how long its been posted. If its freshly posted and you really want it then be patient. If you message in the first 24 hours then they are unlikely to come down. If they drop the price in the first 24 hours then lowball and try and get then drop the price another ~20%.   7) Pay and ship quickly. Once your offer is accepted and the seller/buyer has made some other form of communication with you always pay and send quickly. Ive sold about 15 items between grailed and ebay and only had one dispute and two items I didnt recieve but I think it could have been a customs issue because they sent tracking and it was from the Ukraine. :(   8) Be patient. Could be the first rule. Either as a buyer or a seller be patient. You have 180 days to open a dispute though paypal. If its been over 5 days then make sure and send multiple messages. I had a guy take two weeks to even send but he communicated with me every few days. He was on vacation. People sometime have busy lives and have had these items posted for weeks. Some are really good about shipping but I wouldnt be too alarmed by a few days. I would give him till thursday at least before politely asking if he is sending it or suggestto him (dont threaten) that it might be a good idea to try this another time. When I was new to grailed I had gotten a full refund before and had the guy message me a few weeks later saying he just doesnt read his email and didnt know it had sold until he noticed the dispute in his paypal. He apologized and almost dropped the price by 40% for the trouble."
malefashion,35qrkk,Pengyster,5,Wed May 13 03:35:00 2015 UTC,please do not lowball
malefashion,35qrkk,Hyperios,4,Wed May 13 05:45:44 2015 UTC,As a buyer why not initially? If you don't get a decent response then make a more serious offer. Plenty of times if had the lowball offer get accepted and the item actually turning out in great condition.
malefashion,35qrkk,goodkareem,1 point,Wed May 13 09:55:40 2015 UTC,Because if u lowball someone they will ignore you
malefashion,35qrkk,Pengyster,3,Wed May 13 13:54:09 2015 UTC,This is wrong. You lowball they ignore your lowball then you make a better offer. No one is going to not sell to you because you started low. Until they make a feature where you can outright ban communication with someone I always start almost as low as i can. Like I said I've made over 90 purchases on the site. I'm not just throwing stuff out if my ass here.

You need to setup an account and it's fairly easy from there. You buy on whatever site and ship to your proxy company using the info they provide. They receive and then ship to the US for a reasonable fee. It didn't take long at all for me. The Nanamica site is in Japanese which can be translated fairly easy using google but some of the drop downs for sizing, shipping, etc are not translated automatically so that can be a challenge depending on the site you buy from. Most of the proxy sites are quite easy to use."

malefashion,35ngnl,Oppiken,7,Mon May 11 23:06:32 2015 UTC,"The new site looks good, but it's a pain to navigate on a computer.    Their buying certainly is fantastic, though. They continue to stock interesting stuff within a well-defined aesthetic (and their site fits that aesthetic as well), and I'm pretty sure they got on Number 288, Achilles Ion Gabriel, and maybe even Eytys before a lot of other online shops picked those brands up.    That all said, I've never bought anything from them except during their absurd end-of-season sales, so I guess I've been part of the problem."

malefashion,35ngnl,fatalistspalmistry,2,Tue May 12 12:08:11 2015 UTC,"Yeah, me neither. I can't afford their products at regular price so I've only looked during the end of season sales. The article brought up something that I found to be interesting, where they mentioned that when the store closed down that LN-CC couldn't pay back designers. I wonder when they opened up again and their buyers tried to contact designers, if any of them rejected LN-CC.   I'm curious to see how things will change for the store after their initial fail. Hopefully they still keep those crazy 80% off sales for end of season."
malefashion,35ngnl,thecanadiancook,1 point,Tue May 12 00:30:07 2015 UTC,The article mentions that the accounts have now been all settled but I wouldn't be surprised if some brands wouldn't immediately jump back into business with them.

malefashion,35ngnl,thecanadiancook,2,Tue May 12 01:08:42 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's what I noted too. I wonder if that has to do with their previous record.

malefashion,35ngnl,truthfulie,1 point,Tue May 12 06:18:43 2015 UTC,"They have mentioned that they want to be more of a marketing platform for new brands so picking up those brands before other online shops makes sense.  Though it is sad, I would argue they had more interesting purchases prior to not paying back certain brands. Like I still enjoy looking up their editorials from 2011-2013. Not to say their current buys are uninteresting but I do hope that if this system proves to work out that they can move back into even more interesting buys."

The jacket, albeit simple, works fine because it looks generic enough to not get in the way of things.  for example, the tee is a Wang - relatively expensive - yet that fact isn't adding anything here. It looks like a generic basic tee.  Don't get hung up on brands, designers and their uniforms. Style for yourself with whatever you find and like."

I've got a single wristband I wore every day for a year and a half...it started off black, so it never showed a patina like this, but it's still amazing how much the character of the leather changed over time.    With Greats and Clae getting on the undyed leather bandwagon, and Hender Scheme getting more popular by the day, we might see more appreciation for stuff like this going forward. I'm all for it."

malefashion,35blfd,CheerUpBrokeBoy,3,Sat May 9 20:28:32 2015 UTC,Its a diffusion line (CDG Play) of Comme des Garçons. An amazing experimental Japanese house that really pushed the boundaries in the 80's/90's and still does. I would check out the original lines (Comme des Garçons Homme Plus or Comme des Garçons Homme Deux) for some insane designs. Their owner/founder/creative director is the fascinating Rei Kwakobo. Essentially its saying I love Comme de Garçons but I'm not rich/daring enough to wear the main collections.

malefashion,358scg,jodylowroller,76,Fri May 8 01:34:47 2015 UTC,"Not surprised by this.  Not to hate on them too much, but the couple that was moderating that subreddit has had a weird history of getting into odd arguments/fights with people.  A few years back there was that gun thing with roidsrus, and more recently, there was an inside joke about them being the same person (because roidsrus has never posted a photo/fitpic of himself) and a_marsh got a little angry with someone for making that joke because it delegitimized their individual identities, or something like that.  Most recently there was an argument over the supposedly sexist nature of the EMF subreddit, and it seems like the mods flew off the handle a bit once their points were downvoted by people who disagreed with them. Neither of the two of them have made any Reddit posts since then, and now the subreddit is closed as of this evening.  The two of them were definitely interested in fashion, and had some engaging opinions, but they were a little odd in the way they moderated (what was with all the weirdly named reoccurring threads and strict rules?) and how they dealt with criticism.  I didn't mind discussing brands and clothing with them, but I felt like they took MODERATING (all caps) way too seriously, and this is just another example of unexpected behavior coming from them.  It's too bad they shut down the forum, in addition to essentially deleting their reddit accounts. But I guess that is the risk of putting too much reading/content/commenting into a subreddit moderated by only two individuals.  edit: There was also this thing from a year back on MFA"
malefashion,358scg,brian_g,18,Fri May 8 03:02:18 2015 UTC,I loved EMF. It had a solid community and good content. Then I was banned for commenting with an inspirational joke quote under another comment that mentioned they were banned as well. Apparently my comment was attacking a_march directly.   Incredibly odd to me.
malefashion,358scg,Deusis,3,Fri May 8 13:25:45 2015 UTC,"Oh shit, that's why you disappeared. I was wondering where you went.  They are just really trigger happy with the ban hammer, huge disappointment."
malefashion,358scg,nAVEEE,11,Fri May 8 18:29:25 2015 UTC,Yeah a little taking the ball and going home with shutting it down. What was the gun thing?
malefashion,358scg,spicedmeats,9,Fri May 8 03:08:38 2015 UTC,"I don't remember the exact details, since it was at least a year or two ago or longer that it happened. But I did see the gun photos in question and they were kind of weird.  There was some post on MFA or FFA about shoes or something and a photo was shared with the item being discussed, with a pistol leaned up against it, or propping it up in other photos. The gun had no relevance to the shoes (or whatever), so why was it included in the photos? I think some people took offense or even felt threatened by it, since it was such a non-sequitur.  I ultimately don't think anything bad came about, but that's always stuck out in my mind of a really odd sort of situation."
malefashion,358scg,brian_g,6,Fri May 8 03:15:26 2015 UTC,"from what i recall, someone responded to his girlfriend, roids took it as the poster hitting on her, and not-so-subtly posted the gun pic in response.   second-hand source"

malefashion,358scg,crpyvnce,6,Fri May 8 17:24:34 2015 UTC,"It's just such a disappointing response from them, honestly. Not the first time it happened, though, so not totally unexpected."
malefashion,358scg,greggyYO,23,Fri May 8 08:41:57 2015 UTC,"It's a bummer, EMF was the best fashion sub on reddit imo, partly due to the invite-only nature and the lack of the usual rehashed threads and opinions from mfa. Great discussions, tons of knowledge in the user base - invite only certainly helped that. Their moderating was a little... militant, which sometimes rubbed the wrong way. Having an RL couple as mods was not ideal."
malefashion,358scg,tarants,16,Fri May 8 04:27:41 2015 UTC,"You know, I'm not a fan of everything roids did but he and marsh ran a pretty cool sub. The heavy-handed modding was at times pretty funny (no discussing certain brands, etc.) and sometimes draconian, but it was ultimately how they wanted the sub to be run and everyone took part/didn't create an alternative. I don't think it had really been an issue at all in the past year or so and I never felt intimidated about posting something if I disagreed with the consensus of the board (near universal for SLP, bleh). It was a cool little thing they had going on and I hope they'd come back to it sooner rather than later."
malefashion,358scg,SisterRayVU,3,Fri May 8 06:16:59 2015 UTC,"Yeah, for all its flaws it was still a good sub."
malefashion,358scg,tarants,0,Fri May 8 13:21:09 2015 UTC,Concur whole wholeheartedly.  In some ways I almost feel like the rules added to the personality of the place; I would find myself waiting until Day X to post something I had been excited or curious about all week to fit within their posting schedule and in some oddball way that made it more compelling to me.
malefashion,358scg,vurtforge,1 point,Fri May 8 16:27:45 2015 UTC,New rules: MF will henceforth be invite only; invitees to be selected by /u/tarants only. You will all have good discussions. You will all spread and share knowledge. We will be original and no longer hash nor re-hash anything- neither topics nor smokable substances. I will marry someone and make them mod.

malefashion,358scg,spicedmeats,2,Fri May 8 01:52:05 2015 UTC,What exactly happened?
malefashion,358scg,mc-lunar,12,Fri May 8 02:36:37 2015 UTC,"i was banned for some reason that roids won't explain to me, but that seems bizarre considering literal dicks were being discussed and featured when rick's last collection came out"

malefashion,358scg,Damn_Croissant,11,Fri May 8 12:56:03 2015 UTC,"I was just kidding. The idea was for the sub to be a place for people to discuss fashion (especially higher end fashion) without people complaining about inaccessible prices. The application was a bit ridiculous, but it was intended to maintain high quality discussions"
malefashion,358scg,Xenataur,8,Fri May 8 13:10:26 2015 UTC,"Yeah that's the problem with MFA. Granted it's a beginner forum, but often times you can't have an intellectual discussion about expensive pieces without someone saying something along the lines of ""why the fuck would you pay that much for X, lol"". The same story gets tiring after a while."
malefashion,358scg,thinkerthought,2,Fri May 8 13:22:25 2015 UTC,without people complaining about inaccessible prices   Good idea

malefashion,358scg,Esoterrorism,4,Thu May 14 02:22:19 2015 UTC,"In retrospect, though, it's this sort of mentality that isn't conducive to open minded discussion. The entire idea behind EMF is that how much something costs should not factor whatsoever in a criticism or feedback of an outfit, or in an opinion of something that is being discussed. Neither should how wealthy there are.  You don't need to be rich to be into expensive fashion. It just indicates that you spend a higher proportion of your income or money or whatever on clothes, and are passionate about fashion.  The applications are simply to weed out people who aren't into fashion for the sake of fashion, really."
malefashion,358scg,akaghi,3,Thu May 14 21:12:43 2015 UTC,I asked because I genuinely didn't know.
malefashion,358scg,Esoterrorism,2,Fri May 8 18:45:48 2015 UTC,Yeah I know. It was a literal answer.
malefashion,358scg,kthoag,3,Fri May 8 15:23:52 2015 UTC,"They never got around to approving me, so where does that place me?"
malefashion,358scg,heck3,2,Fri May 8 15:32:41 2015 UTC,There's no clear answer yet. We're trying to reach a community standard on admissions.

malefashion,358scg,bootsnpantsnboots,2,Fri May 8 18:33:03 2015 UTC,"Ownership is not in any way a requirement, as long as you are interested in discussing it."
malefashion,358scg,nAVEEE,3,Fri May 8 18:42:24 2015 UTC,"Wouldn't making the sub private, admitting anyone, and then being quick to strike/warn/ban if someone complains about prices work just as well?"

malefashion,358scg,akaghi,14,Fri May 8 22:27:42 2015 UTC,"do you think if a new one was made, it should be exclusive again? i'm not going to lie, the main appeal of emf to me was that it was smaller, and the content/discussions were usually pretty interesting"
malefashion,358scg,thebakerbastard,12,Fri May 8 04:58:48 2015 UTC,"Yeah, there was a good reason it was made exclusive, but get rid of the waiting times for people who really did know what they were talking about, when I made this account they wouldn't let me in even though I was already accepted through my old account >.>"
malefashion,358scg,PoliticalNapkin,3,Fri May 8 10:12:27 2015 UTC,"Definitely. The smaller member count and the fact that you sort of had to prove you weren't a shitposter on MFA who condemns anything that you can't afford helped to make discussion on EMF far more pleasant. People DID get upset over weird shit, though."
malefashion,358scg,ImTheRealSanta,3,Fri May 8 04:11:08 2015 UTC,"The private sub-reddit system worked great. We rarely had problems, and if we did, they were almost always arguments with the mods."

malefashion,358scg,IkeaMonkeyCoat,5,Fri May 8 02:04:29 2015 UTC,"So this is a bummer. Probably sort of inevitable, but a bummer none the less. That original exchange in pics seems like an awful silly thing to close down something as nifty as EMF over.   I will miss the discussion and exposure to new and sometimes interesting brands and ideas I hadn't seen before. Also stuff like better homes and travel : / RIP EMF."
malefashion,358scg,headless_inge,13,Tue May 26 23:28:09 2015 UTC,"Pretty bummed about this, EMF was one of the only places i felt comfortable engaging in fashion discussions. Much more open minded and smaller community than mfa."
malefashion,358scg,catsforlife,7,Tue May 26 23:35:36 2015 UTC,Agreed. At the risk of sounding like a snob the discussions there felt more 'mature' on a daily basis.
malefashion,358scg,Deusis,12,Fri May 8 07:31:57 2015 UTC,"I don't think its snobby really. I mean MFA really is a sub that's hard to participate in discussion because of the absurd size (I have to be on the PC at 9am to post a fit and hope it doesnt get buried to get any sort of feedback), other communities of a decent size like rawdenim and goodyearwelt are a bit too focused on a specific category of fashion (that im not too invested in particularly) and then a sub like this, which has great potential, is usually extremely dead. EMF was a good place for ""mature"" fashion discussions with a good variety of posters into different things. This sub could actually act in a similar way if more people posted, but its mostly lurkers."

malefashion,358scg,EvilGRAHAM,14,Fri May 8 05:08:42 2015 UTC,No time to copy info from saved posts   That's honestly the saddest and most frustrating part of this - so much good information was shared and now it's potentially all lost? Just sad.

malefashion,358scg,CheerUpBrokeBoy,1 point,Fri May 8 09:01:19 2015 UTC,The issue with this is there were a lot of users that shared personal and somewhat private information on there that they may not want everyone else seeing. Being a closed sub it could be challenging to recover the posts and still make sure that only the old approved submitter have access to it.
malefashion,358scg,animatedrouge2,4,Fri May 8 13:19:36 2015 UTC,"You know, I might wait out the 60days on it, and then request the sub. That way we can collect whatever info we need, and then put it in read only mode or something."
malefashion,358scg,CheerUpBrokeBoy,2,Fri May 8 21:55:16 2015 UTC,"It's quite possible they made sure to delete every post/comment before shutting the sub down.

Newsboy hats can be pulled off with the right style and facial structure/hair but it's tricky and if you look like the guy you mentioned it's not going to work for you.

If you don't have the possibility to try them on in person I would go tts or even 1 size down since they will stretch out like most jeans.  At first they will fit very snug, especially around the knees but they will get more relaxed very fast.  If you want them to stay like they came in the beginning, you can take them to a dry cleaner where they treat them so they don't bleed, atleast that's what the sales assistant told me. If not they will slowly get fades, similar to raw denim, but much less noticably."

Quality is pretty poor and all the designs are blatant rip-offs, or rather copies. But they are cheap.  Could also look at zara. Their ""black"" collection might have something like this.   The third way, and the one I'd go with, is just buying some cheap leggings on asos or something and then try altering some shorts/pants/sweatpants to the look you're after. The result might not be that good but you'll probably get an idea if the aesthetic is worth investing in for you."
malefashion,34zuex,thecanadiancook,7,Tue May 5 23:39:51 2015 UTC,Just going to spring board off your third point and say /u/Wboar you should take a look at /u/thisistheodore. He has done what you are looking for 1 2 with hanes leggings and shorts (adidas/RO).

malefashion,34zuex,bulletiquette,1 point,Wed May 6 05:48:31 2015 UTC,maybe slimmer or just trim the length   Depends on the shoes. With low tops the stacks and folds balance it out proportion-wise imo.
malefashion,34zuex,translocution,1 point,Wed May 6 09:16:33 2015 UTC,"No hate, but I'd seriously advise against this.   If you have any respect for the designer then I urge you to go to whatever store stocks the garment, try it on and if you really love it then save up and purchase it.  A lot of effort goes into the development of these products, that's why they cost so much - it's not just the materials or marketing, it's the designers ingenuity and creativity that you're purchasing and supporting.  When you buy from fabrixsquare or to a lesser extent Zara all you do is encourage the ugly practice of ripping things off whilst disrespecting the designer who came up with the original idea.  Lastly, I think the idea of D.I.Y is a good option - if you've got the time."
malefashion,34zuex,bulletiquette,14,Wed May 6 01:27:12 2015 UTC,"I understand this train of thought in regards to intricately detailed and unique garments, but something like a pair of shorts and leggings? That's not exactly the pinnacle of ingenuity or creativity there."
malefashion,34zuex,SisterRayVU,-5,Wed May 6 01:40:03 2015 UTC,How often did you see leggings and shorts in streetwear 7-10 years ago?  Designers like Rick and Tisci made it a part of contemporary fashion.  Just because it's a simple object doesn't mean it didn't require creativity and ingenuity.
malefashion,34zuex,bulletiquette,10,Wed May 6 01:52:14 2015 UTC,So he can't buy Nike now either? Where do you think they got the idea from?
malefashion,34zuex,SisterRayVU,1 point,Wed May 6 02:03:52 2015 UTC,"I think you're misinterpreting what I'm talking about. Fabrixsquare and companies like them replicate designer garments. Like, literally copy them down to the thread. I don't think we should support that. And that's what I'm advising against.  If Wboat wants to go and buy a pair of Nike leggings and couple them with a pair of adidas shorts then all power to him."
malefashion,34zuex,bulletiquette,8,Wed May 6 02:14:57 2015 UTC,"They don't ""literally"" copy them, but okay. What I'm saying is those designers copied, albeit less literally, Nike. Shrug.  And what about the hoodie? Or the t-shirt? Should I only cop the most authentic, oldest t-shirt maker's stuff now? Or maybe do some things become generally accepted?"
malefashion,34zuex,SisterRayVU,5,Wed May 6 02:17:10 2015 UTC,"Firstly, they do 'literally' copy garments. http://www.fabrixquare.com/men/features/vandalique/drkncns-drop-crotch-geo-leather-effect-cargo-shorts.html  Secondly, there's a huge, gaping difference between copying and taking inspiration from.  The last point you brought up is interesting and worth additional discussion - my immediate answer would be that some objects because of their general consumption, over time, become a template for other objects, from a t-shirt all the way to a simple metal spoon."
malefashion,34zuex,translocution,2,Wed May 6 02:36:08 2015 UTC,"Fair, didn't realize they were close to exact copies."
malefashion,34zuex,bulletiquette,2,Wed May 6 18:01:36 2015 UTC,"I think I phrased my point incorrectly. I think that knocking off specific garments, duplicating their details and nuances that took the designer hours of work, is bad. However, I think taking a basic idea or silhouette i.e. ""leggings with shorts"" or ""bomber jacket with dropped shoulders"" or ""boxy wool jacket"" falls within the realm of acceptability. So buying a pair of shorts and leggings from fabrixquare which are (as I understand it at least) made by taking apart a pair of the originals, making a pattern from that and then making duplicates out of shoddy materials, would be shitty. But buying a pair of Zara jean legging combo things which are simply inspired by things seen on the runway would be ok imho."
malefashion,34zuex,twinsofliberty,1 point,Wed May 6 02:09:07 2015 UTC,I think we're on the same page - I still don't support Zara's dilution of designer garments but it's a far lesser evil then ripping things off wholesale.
malefashion,34zuex,hausofblaq,1 point,Wed May 6 02:24:47 2015 UTC,"yeah, but what's the purpose of buying an expensive piece to experiment with if you don't have that disposable income? if you're sure you want to pursue it, ok, but if there's a cheaper alternative: lets be real, why wouldnt the average user spend that much on something you're unsure you want to wear if you lack a large that disposable income."

malefashion,352l4d,EJ-ericjackson,-5,Wed May 6 16:17:42 2015 UTC,That's not how peer pressure works.
malefashion,352l4d,Discover_and_Become,1 point,Wed May 6 16:23:08 2015 UTC,My understanding was that peer pressure is when your peers pressure you into doing something that you usually don't want to do. So if there actually was peer pressure on this sub then they could just not look at it? Handle it like a normal human being and not care about random people on the Internet.
malefashion,352l4d,EJ-ericjackson,-5,Wed May 6 18:49:53 2015 UTC,"Poster is correct, anything that has been posted on this sub that is unconventional, innovative and unorthodox (and dare i say actually good?)  the subreddit shoots it down in flames with downvotes, or it gets overshadowed by the same crap that is posted every day.    so you say ""well post and contribute"" only when people do contribute, they are met with ""i dont like this because its different!"" so its slightly discouraging   sorta a reflection of the actual industry lol"
malefashion,352l4d,HugAndWug,7,Wed May 6 16:29:41 2015 UTC,Mate that's ridiculous.  Heckawheel is like the absolute best example. Retro specs is another good one
malefashion,352l4d,Vincenti,-4,Wed May 6 16:31:48 2015 UTC,"hmmm, I'll agree that Retro Specs is fairly unorthodox, though im not familiar with Heckawheel,"
malefashion,352l4d,WheelchairEpidemic,5,Wed May 6 16:39:39 2015 UTC,sorta a reflection of the actual industry lol   hello mr. fashion designer can you please post pictures of anything you've ever done ?   or how about posting pictures of anything you've ever worn that's unconventional innovative or unorthodox.
malefashion,352l4d,Vincenti,-8,Wed May 6 16:35:44 2015 UTC,"Yup, this is the /r/music of fashion subs."
malefashion,352l4d,WheelchairEpidemic,-6,Wed May 6 16:43:04 2015 UTC,You're right man. You should keep dressing like a Walmart ad. That's totally unique and not a product of corporate marketing pressure and influence.
malefashion,3522ao,DashingAndCo,0,Wed May 6 13:31:37 2015 UTC,"Nice. I like it. I'm quite a fan of being minimalistic. I wouldn't pay 25 GBP for it though. Then again, I'm from SA, so our spending range is different."
malefashion,350kit,LilMooseCub,9,Wed May 6 02:35:39 2015 UTC,"I am sorry but the whole left white/right black comes across as hokey and costumey (think Two-face). That being said its high school prom so you can probably get away with that kind of thing. One alternative still being ""unique and interesting"" is a vertical two-tone/dip-dye shirt. Think Ann D, Damir Doma. KTT has a great guide on DIY dip dye."
malefashion,350kit,thecanadiancook,2,Wed May 6 04:21:44 2015 UTC,I'm just worried how this will actually look tucked in I'm I'm love with the idea of the sleeves and collar/torso contrast though thanks so much for the input and the guide I see where the two face cliche could come in you are correct.
malefashion,350kit,ThatDrunkViking,7,Wed May 6 04:24:15 2015 UTC,"Also, for this to remotely work the fit of your tux needs to be on point, otherwise you'll just look like the hoards of neckbeards at prom trying to be unique and ""quirky""."

malefashion,350kit,ThatDrunkViking,3,Wed May 6 14:18:01 2015 UTC,"What about maybe going for a vertical gradient on your bow-tie? I think that might work better and actually look good.  The trouble with going for the DIY gradient is that there is many ways it's just look cheesy in stead of cool, but if you are going for the shirt remember to take the button-stance of your tux into consideration, don't want to start the gradient way above your button."
malefashion,350kit,ThatDrunkViking,1 point,Wed May 6 14:27:58 2015 UTC,Are bowties a necessity for prom attire? I've never totally been a fan since they were adopted as the uniform for the tumblresque doctor who high school cult.
malefashion,350kit,truthfulie,2,Wed May 6 15:57:28 2015 UTC,"No, not necessarily, but prom is some sort of a black-tie event so a bow-tie is appropriate in some sense. Just make sure it's not anything but white/grey/black and you should be able to get around the tumbr-crowd (also, hand-tied is a plus).  For my prom I just want for the classic-tux matches everything look, I think it's so super cheesy to match outfits and I haven't seen it pulled off well in a serious manner."
malefashion,350kit,CDev33,1 point,Wed May 6 16:38:48 2015 UTC,Thanks for the advice anyway
malefashion,350kit,NocturnalTaco,2,Wed May 6 16:39:58 2015 UTC,"Hey, no problem. As long as you are matching black/white it's not that cheesy, I more mean the people who match the exact same shade of turquoise/pink/gold with their cheap ""silk"" bow-tie and vest."

malefashion,34td8u,KawaiiHero,1 point,Mon May 4 22:47:24 2015 UTC,The jacket is Comme Des Garcons Homme Plus. Early 2000s I think. It's composed of a lightweight boiled polyester. It gives it a weightlessness - almost as if it's floating an inch away from the body. This image might give you more detail - it's essentially the same one. http://s221.photobucket.com/user/letsstayhome/media/Bi078.jpg.html

malefashion,34tkty,HoneyIAteTheCat,6,Mon May 4 13:22:32 2015 UTC,"Nice topic. Business casual has spread so far and it's by definition the worst style ever, neither casual nor business.  Jeans + Blazer seems to be the #1 definition of that here in Europe. But then what shoes would ever be appropriate with that?  My personal base is a good white ocbd and a pair of clean black derbies or similar. It opens up a lot of choices in terms of trousers and tops. Kinda monochrome kinda forward fits are possible. But the 'goth corporate fit' from below is one step too far imho, it's counter culture pretty much and likely not seen favourable in most companies."
malefashion,34tkty,banshee-ohara,14,Mon May 4 21:41:44 2015 UTC,Blue jeans and blazer is one of the worst looks ever IMO. I can't wait for that to die.

malefashion,34tkty,avapxia,2,Tue May 5 12:24:16 2015 UTC,Business casual means 100% no jeans here in the US.
malefashion,34tkty,thomaspaine,6,Mon May 4 23:57:17 2015 UTC,"Usually yes, but on the west coast I've seen ""nice jeans"" + button up or polo shirt as acceptable business casual wear."
malefashion,34tkty,maps1488,2,Tue May 5 00:39:12 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it stretches everywhere. I worked at a place in Boston where it essentially just meant ""something with a collar, no shorts and no basketball sneakers""."

malefashion,34tkty,thomaspaine,6,Mon May 4 19:31:39 2015 UTC,"I recently started a job at a pretty conservative company and am struggling with this myself. Men's capital F Fashion is pretty hard to reconcile with professional wear, because almost by definition you don't want to be drawing attention to your clothes. Conformity and blandness is pretty much the name of the game.  Black Fleece and BoO are good preppy-ish options that aren't as boring but still work appropriate for the most part.   Jil Sander and really anything that's just simple, sharp, and like two dark colors is a good look.  I'm pretty hyped on Boglioli and am kind of moving toward unstructured suits and jackets for work, since sleek suits feels a little too dressed up for my department but I'll kill myself before I go full business casual.  Here's some of the stuff I've been wearing     suit raf inspired unstructured blazer"

So I tend to stick to stick with my basics (RG/OL) or just change when I get to work.

malefashion,34tkty,KamikazeSexPilot,1 point,Tue May 5 04:55:32 2015 UTC,"Eh, where I'll be working is sort of similar. I'm not a fan of just having a shirt tucked into trousers, it feels naked and plain, but I tend to be in a rush and it's easier than putting on a jacket in the summer or buying a light-weight suit/jacket for the summer specifically. I think plain shirts from the likes of the brands you listed as well as ACNE trousers at least gives you a feeling of being cool and wearing what you want. /u/thomaspaine pretty much hits it on the mark, though. Simple, two colors, etc. You don't want to stand out for your clothes at all but you can still have people notice that you're not wearing Men's Warehouse or whatever."

malefashion,34o0b6,KamikazeSexPilot,-1,Sat May 2 22:56:34 2015 UTC,"Oh lol oops, that older fit was good on paper but looked bad in practice cause the shirt. Realized this thanks to the controversy and sold it, I think this tee makes it so the ensemble actually works."
malefashion,34o0b6,avapxia,7,Sat May 2 23:01:22 2015 UTC,Changing the tee to another drapey white shirt kind of misses the point. It's too textbook. It's like going on MFA with clark desert boots and an ocbd and asking for a critique
malefashion,34o0b6,trippy_grape,21,Sat May 2 23:15:52 2015 UTC,"It's like going on MFA with clark desert boots and an ocbd and asking for a critique   But this sub isn't for critique. Also, you could describe all of RO as 'too textbook' because he's made a style that is distinctly RO and is more or less that exact same aesthetic every season.  Is this fit the /r/malefashion look? yes. Is there anything wrong with that? I don't think so. Will it spark much discussion? I doubt it. Also when you take into account the fact that when he walks out the door in the morning there's a very high chance he won't look textbook because the entire world doesn't browse this subreddit."
malefashion,34o0b6,timmmmmay,8,Sat May 2 23:23:43 2015 UTC,"I dunno. The top posts right now have WTAPS, Y-3, Vivsim, H&M, CDG, and the dadcore/bad JCrew kid. There are a few users that post a lot of Rick fits, but it's not like the brand dominates or defines this sub."

malefashion,34mfyu,malti001,3,Sun May 3 11:56:30 2015 UTC,"""gooey-dee""  It helps if you know some Italian pronunciation too"
malefashion,34mfyu,Smartypantzzzz,2,Sun May 3 13:22:29 2015 UTC,"I'm italian so it's easy for me - I think that the english spelling would be ""Gooueedee"", or ""Gwedee""."

malefashion,34ew22,SisterRayVU,7,Thu Apr 30 18:51:51 2015 UTC,"Some bathroom tiles fell off the wall in my shower. To be fair, the grouting was starting to wear and I've been taking hot showers, so I guess it was a matter of time, but I'm scared to tell my landlady. I bought adhesive and grout and tried to repair it myself but it was pretty clearly not going to happen. I'm letting her know tomorrow but I really love my apartment and hope she'll let me re-sign for next year."
malefashion,34ew22,timmmmmay,9,Thu Apr 30 23:10:35 2015 UTC,"If you weren't negligent isn't it more her issue than yours? It's not like hot showers constitute improper tenant behavior, and I'd imagine the problems already existed before you got there. Granted, I live in an area which is very non-competitive tenant-wise, so the landlords tend to be pretty accommodating."
malefashion,34ew22,SisterRayVU,2,Fri May 1 01:31:54 2015 UTC,"I really love my apartment and it's a great deal. I should have told her when the grouting first started to go but I didn't.

malefashion,34ew22,hausofblaq,2,Fri May 1 04:52:12 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I would say your landlady shouldn't give you crap about it. Any other person might not have noticed when the grouting was weakening and the tiles would've fallen off anyhow."

Pulling of qasas in the spring/summer usually requires cropped pants or, alternatively, rolling them up above your ankles. The qasa's tounge is, in my opinion, what really makes its silhouette shine.

malefashion,34crwf,hausofblaq,1 point,Thu Apr 30 10:11:50 2015 UTC,I don't like the people that work at Kokko. They come up and hard sell you on products. You don't even get a minute to browse their stock before 3 sales people try to drag you to buy some CDG wallets or something.
malefashion,34crwf,Oppiken,1 point,Fri May 1 15:46:57 2015 UTC,"Oh, I've never had that experience the times that I've been to Kokko. However, their sales associates do follow you around which is a bit discouraging when browsing.   Service aside though, I would still recommend it just because they carry a decent amount of stock that you wouldn't be able to find in Vancouver."
malefashion,34crwf,hausofblaq,1 point,Fri May 1 17:25:47 2015 UTC,"Yeah, they get a lot of the obscure Japanese brands like Julius though at a pretty big mark up.   I don't like when sales associates follow me. There's a lot of pressure when I just want to casually browse at pieces and see if anything catches my eye. I think that's why I like Neighbors because they just let you do your thing until you got a question or need a size."
malefashion,34crwf,Oppiken,2,Fri May 1 17:36:28 2015 UTC,"As others have said for Portland, Frances May, Machus, Table of Contents. Also check out Physical Element, Jo is fantastic and she brings in a lot of unique items. Stand up Comedy is really fantastic as well. Look at the Portland Garment Factory's facebook to see if they have a collaboration going on when your in town. A lot of overly-expensive stuff on NW 23rd, and tons of vintage shops on SE Hawthorne. If you or your family is interested in perfume you can go to The Perfume House which has more scents than you can go through in a single trip. Across from Frances May is Parallel, which is mostly women's stuff. Also, there is a millinery next door which is fun to look through. If you are interested in a more conceptual aesthetic stick with Machus (even though they can get quite hypebeast-ish nowadays), Physical Element, Stand Up Comedy, and Frances May."

malefashion,34aege,Kritios_Boy,3,Wed Apr 29 16:02:27 2015 UTC,"Need a new pair of low tops. I'm thinking CP or Margiela, and maybe Lanvin. Which one is best?"
malefashion,34aege,Callusing,8,Wed Apr 29 16:26:05 2015 UTC,"Price independent, I'd say Margiela, then Lanvin, then CPs.    Style-wise, I like Margielas the best...they're the least minimal, but I think they always look good even in the basic models, and MM brings out some great finishes every season.    Quality-wise, I think Lanvin wins hands-down. Lanvin makes arguably the best-constructed sneakers I've ever encountered...phenomenal materials, and built like tanks.    CPs are CPs. They're the most minimal, and if they're the look you want, they're what you've gotta get. Epaulet just put out some admirable Achilles lookalikes if you want to save a bit, though.    And I'll take this opportunity to pitch Wings + Horns low-tops, which I think smoke all of the above."
malefashion,34aege,Kritios_Boy,2,Wed Apr 29 17:25:23 2015 UTC,"Oh snap those Wings + Horns lows look so good. Love the leather. The silhouette is a little bit chunkier, but I still like them a lot.  Thanks for a nicely detailed reponse."

malefashion,34aege,Callusing,1 point,Wed Apr 29 23:46:47 2015 UTC,"Those are too bold for me, but that doesn't mean they wouldn't work for you.    Basic whites and Pollacks are always a good decision. There are a couple nice all-black options (1, 2) and some cool mostly-white-with-some-flair versions (Holo and red sole).    But my favorite this season, without a doubt - and I think they'd work well with black or grey shorts - are the black ombre pair. They're one of my favorite replica renditions yet."
malefashion,34aege,frenchfrieskl,1 point,Thu Apr 30 02:49:52 2015 UTC,"Oh wow, the black ombre look extremely clean. Also was considering the pollacks. The thing about the pollacks though, is I think they might not work with a lot of things. Would they look best in a light colored (white/offwhite/light grey etc.) fit or a monochrome (including dark grey and black)?"
malefashion,34aege,Fatiloquent,1 point,Thu Apr 30 02:56:22 2015 UTC,"CPs are great minimial shoes, but I think they are way overpriced thanks to the hype. If you can get used ones for 180$ or less then it's definitely worth it."

The cuffs are uneven, the clothing rejects tailoring and 'fit', the palette is muted in an interesting way and the silhouette forms a sort of diamond shape, obscuring the human form with its bagginess.

malefashion,34271q,BarbaTenusSapientes,-4,Tue Apr 28 04:02:52 2015 UTC,"First you'd have to have an answer for what would be the exact number of shirt you can possess before being considered ""over-reductive"".

Maybe go as far as to actually argue that it's a faulty premise. You also didn't read the last sentence, or you'd know that my stance was strictly to not let sweatshops die out until political reform has been made in those countries. I obviously would prefer better quality clothing made by well paid workers, but good luck not having a single piece of sweatshop clothing end up in your closet. Unless of course you think that the problem isn't that it exists, but that there should be a limit to how much sweatshop clothes each person should own?"

I understand(or I assume at least; correct me if I'm wrong) that you want people to stop buying cheap shirts so that the companies that make those clothes go out of business, and that they'll be forced to close the sweatshops. Probably thinking that by having sweatshops not exist anymore, the quality of life will increase for them considerably. I am in no way in favor of having other people work in those conditions, but do you honestly feel that by restricting them from making clothes would keep them from finding another job(with a high chance of more hazardous conditions)? I would say that my sources weren't garbage, but you're entitled to your opinion and I would encourage you to provide evidence of your own. The problem it seems can not be permanently solved unless there is major political reform in those countries. However, it seems important to note that we do not live and those countries and we do not have any say in what the labor laws are like either."

Id pay a local kid to mow my lawn so that he can save up to buy whatever new Gamestation game he wants. Thats using cheap child labor to do a job I dont want to do. But with that, I let him set his own hours, give him a lemonade, and give him a fair wage. In that, child labor works great. Im not going to fault him for wanting to make a dollar.   What these factories are doing is unacceptable though. Paying below minimum wage, with long hours, in a shitty dangerous building isnt right. Hell, you shouldnt be treating adults that way let alone children."

As to why it's ""bad"", children are children, incapable of making many responsible decisions, it is in societies interest to ensure they are not exploited.  Also, a child who is laboring is using time away from being educated, in other words is missing out on the opportunity to gain knowledge necessary to improve their lot in live and eventually have a better job.    That all being said, it is still unavoidable in many instances."

But think a bit further, and see where these kids will be when they're not kids anymore. They'll lack intellectual development, they'll have a very limited skill-set, and they'll grow up accepting low, exploitative wages, which they'll in turn enforce on their kids by sending them to work in sweat-shops to help make ends meet - just like they had to do when they were kids.

I dont see how child labor causes any of that. I'd actually argue child labor is a benefit to these people if anything as the alternative, by definition, is worse poverty, maybe even starvation. In fact when nations like this ban child labor the kids either a. starve or b. go into prostitution. They arent working in factories cause of awful parenting, they are doing it cause they need to EAT. Not buying HM doesnt fix that problem. Dont see why i get downvoted for asking these things haha. You get where I'm coming from?"
malefashion,34271q,john_ft,1 point,Tue Apr 28 14:15:33 2015 UTC,"is that really caused by child labor, or by poverty   Poverty is a result from multiple reasons, one of which the lack of widespread intellectual development. Although child labour is not the sole cause for poverty, it most definitely is a contributing factor to perpetuating poverty.   I'd actually argue child labor is a benefit to these people if anything as the alternative, by definition, is worse poverty, maybe even starvation   And that's what's so fucked up about it. Many children do face that choice, and from their point of view, yes, child labour is the preferable option.  What would be preferable is that brands that know there is child labour in their supply chain, invest in facilities and initiatives to prevent child labour, like children's aid, funding orphanages and schools, or maybe even pay higher wages to parents.   Not buying HM doesn't fix that problem   Well, it does, actually. Eventually. Nowadays our wallet it our strongest voice. when something doesn't sell, marketing is forced to figure out why and what will sell. If consumers would be more aware of the actual cost of low-priced products, maybe they'd spend their money differently.   Dont see why i get downvoted for asking these things   I understand why, but I don't agree with it. I think differences of opinion lead to good conversations, and asking questions is the best way to have these conversations."

If anything, children being able to earn money to eat is AVOIDING worse poverty... if the kids stop working their poverty does not go away.   Many children do face that choice, and from their point of view, yes, child labour is the preferable option.   So not buying clothes from these companies does what to benefit these children?   If consumers would be more aware of the actual cost of low-priced products, maybe they'd spend their money differently.   Spend their money differently how? By not buying from child labor using companies? That means these companies would either pay the children LESS or not pay them at all, and put them out of work. This does not help anyone."
malefashion,34271q,john_ft,1 point,Tue Apr 28 15:55:06 2015 UTC,"If you're really interested, read up on it. This article is pretty insightful and goes beyond just child labour.  Basically it says that poverty is the main cause for child labour (obviously) and that poverty prevention is the key to eliminating child labour.   To do that, we as consumers should support companies that do just that, instead of supporting companies that perpetuate poverty.   So, for example, buy chocolate from a company that you know pays a fair wage to the cacao farmers and deals with them directly, instead of the brand that just buys it from where-ever as long as it's cheap.   Same goes for everything you buy. You will have to spend more, but you'll add to a solution, instead of contributing to a problem."

Completely agree.   To do that, we as consumers should support companies that do just that, instead of supporting companies that perpetuate poverty.   Don't see how this follows. In what ways do companies ""perpetuate poverty""? I think you are attempting to make this issue far more simple than it is. Extreme poverty in these nations is not as one-dimensional as ""H&M employs kids"". You do realize that parents allow their kids (or make them, possibly) to TAKE these jobs. There must be SOME reason for this.    You will have to spend more, but you'll add to a solution, instead of contributing to a problem.   As I see it, buying from companies like H&M, ZARA, etc. helps people in poverty. It allows them to keep their jobs, which they have in the first place for a reason, i.e. they need to eat."

malefashion,34271q,teckneaks,1 point,Tue Apr 28 03:16:47 2015 UTC,"For a purely economical reason, child labor can negatively impact unemployment rates among adults. If you have a high unemployment rate, banning child labor can cause an increase in jobs for the rest of the labor force. There's a downside to this, in that child labor is presumably cheaper, so banning it increases manufacturing costs.   Child labor laws in the US were largely a result of the Great Depression, from what I remember from my high school history class. People were upset that they couldn't find jobs but children could. I believe China began cracking down on child labor for similar reasons."
malefashion,3443zn,gojirainthemirror,9,Tue Apr 28 03:34:06 2015 UTC,I don't think it's something everyone goes through. Sounds like you're just developing your own style. I've always found the silhouette and colors of punk styles to be very aesthetically pleasing so I can see how you'd like it. By the way that fit is sick.
malefashion,3443zn,JxTG,13,Tue Apr 28 04:37:48 2015 UTC,"Honestly, it depends from where you approach fashion. Do you come to it from music? From something else? There's something contrived about someone wearing something associated with a culture but who has no connection to it. Something like Supreme is more universal -- you can put most anyone in it and it's gonna look fine. Something like torn up jeans and a hardcore band shirt is not. Hence the whole idea that some people can't pull of certain styles (valid or not).  I could write pages about why ""punk"" won, but I think the answer is that while not everyone goes through a punk phase, most everyone goes through something (in life) influenced by punk. I think youth counterculture culture is so intrinsically tied into punk that it's hard to escape it, but I am definitely biased. At the end of the day, it's such a dominant movement that you cannot escape it even if you do not adopt it. But obviously not everyone is sympathetic to it even if they wear the clothes influenced by it. And then you get into an argument about authenticity, posers, etc., that's kind of beyond the question asked.   But yeah, it's hard to escape in fashion and probably will be for a while. Think of when these designers grew up, what they were into, and the time period. Raf Simons was a skinny little dude into New Order, new wave, post-punk, and rave. Margiela had a bomber jacket featured in the Met's exhibit on punk fashion (that should tell you just how ubiquitous it is). Jun from Undercover was in a Sex Pistols cover band. Thom Browne has had collections overtly influenced by punk. You probably won't see Gucci or Versace put out punky pieces but look at when they were founded, who founded them, and what they were making.   I think what's really cool is what the punk kids do when they grow up. How do they dress? What do they listen to? Wes Eisold from Give Up the Ghost/American Nightmare is Cold Cave and he went from hardcore to that and from skinny jeans and band tees to Rick Owens. It's really not that big of a jump aesthetically, but it's cool to think about. Similarly, look at how brands like UC ""matured."" They still draw from the same well of influences but they come out with different results now. I don't think it's all just striving to be more commercial."
malefashion,3443zn,SisterRayVU,2,Tue Apr 28 06:27:47 2015 UTC,"pleasantly surprised at the mention of wes eisold. Can't lie, I emulated his style from everything to hair and clothes between his stint with AN/GUTG and Some Girls."

malefashion,3443zn,dukefoos,3,Tue Apr 28 04:16:29 2015 UTC,"as a mad old dude all i can say is this: your experience is in no way special or universal. i dont mean that to say to put you down. what you are experiencing certainly is one akin to what many teens go through, even what many teens interested in fashion go through, but you are a sample size of one, and prob a tiny minority of people who even like fashion have even heard of Undercover.  when i was a teen and into fashion things were demarcated along tribal lines--punk was literally for people who were into punk music (altho i guess in my town it was ""alternative"", supreme would have been for skaters, and streetwear was for hip hop. the emergence of a hip hop/skater aesthetic in the early Aughts is very recent, and would have made my head spin as a teenager, when those aesthetics sometimes literally were at war with each other."

I've grown up a bit now and my style isn't exactly the same as it was from 13-16 but theres still elements of grunge peppered through what i wear, its just a more mature style."

malefashion,342htw,Baddarn,4,Mon Apr 27 23:15:11 2015 UTC,It's technically this cropped tunic in a silk/cotton rather than a wool and part of the stumpyness comes from the boots I'm wearing and how low I'm wearing the Nasreddins.   Also the tuck on the left foot was awful and came partially out which also attributes to it.

malefashion,342htw,mursechester,2,Mon Apr 27 20:51:48 2015 UTC,"beautiful! always feel like this is the issue with the wiwt format... textures and ""feel"" never come through properly..."

malefashion,342xd8,drewdochop,21,Mon Apr 27 21:57:38 2015 UTC,"You know, I don't have anything against knockoffs/homages/copies of other brands' styles, but something about actually faking the branding leaves a bad taste in my mouth.  Solid photography, though, and it looks like a nice jacket. Long as you're happy with it, eh, live and let live I guess."
malefashion,342xd8,thepsyborg,6,Mon Apr 27 22:24:46 2015 UTC,I know what you mean. I was actually looking into getting a TOJ rider but the whole fiasco going on with their production status is shit. So I bought this instead.   But you're right. I kinda wish they didn't straight up copy the jacket straight down to the snaps. It's kinda overboard. Simple snaps and some good ball YKK zippers would've been ideal for me.
malefashion,342xd8,Prodigy-II,5,Mon Apr 27 22:54:45 2015 UTC,"Quality on this actually looks good, what do people pay for these replicas?"
malefashion,342xd8,Prodigy-II,4,Tue Apr 28 02:01:38 2015 UTC,I paid $478 shipped

malefashion,342xd8,most_illusive_man,1 point,Fri May 1 15:23:49 2015 UTC,What size do you generally wear? Looks like they run a size small.   I think that jacket is really great. Wish it didn't have the SLP logos though.
malefashion,342xd8,truthfulie,1 point,Tue Apr 28 06:46:33 2015 UTC,I wear medium in tops. the jacket looks small because I have a long torso and the jacket itself is a cropped rider.
malefashion,342xd8,loveshinehero,1 point,Tue Apr 28 06:55:26 2015 UTC,"It doesn't look small, I was looking at the measurements on the site. Usually mediums have a 20"" chest and it looks like that's what the large has. What size suit do you wear generally?"

malefashion,340abd,mursechester,8,Mon Apr 27 14:40:50 2015 UTC,"better pants would help, I've owned pants from that brand and you and I both know the quality is garbage, those back pockets being the prime example of it. Some black flight pants, or some more y-3 would be cool. Nice fit tho man, your stuffs always good."
malefashion,340abd,112jt,5,Mon Apr 27 12:06:34 2015 UTC,"Dope! Only thing i'm not too keen on is the backpack, it's a bit too bulky tbh."
malefashion,340abd,Endless_Reddit,8,Mon Apr 27 09:44:44 2015 UTC,I got a lot of stuff in the front pocket but it's pretty slim.
malefashion,340abd,JARSInc,1 point,Mon Apr 27 10:37:52 2015 UTC,Might get a lot of hate for this but I think this fit is pretty weak.  That backpack seems functional as f* though! I really wish Bagjack did something similar so I could attach it to my 3RDARM.
malefashion,340abd,Hacksaures,3,Mon Apr 27 18:09:33 2015 UTC,"How do you guys get your blacks to all match so closely even though they are different brands and likely different ages/levels of wear? Every time I wear all black it looks and feels more like black, darker black, and very dark grey, with varying tones at that. Yet here all four pieces look the same exact shade. Is this just an artifact of the photography/editing/filter?"
malefashion,340abd,digitalgaudium,2,Tue Apr 28 06:34:26 2015 UTC,"Everything here is the same shade of black except for the pants; they are a shade lighter (though not too noticeable).  However, if you look back to my other post with the zara/levi's, they are all the same shade.  My point is, you basically have to keep in mind what shade you're buying. Must brands will typically sell what I call ""true black."" My black clothes pretty much all match except for these particular pair of pants"
malefashion,340abd,monochrome_cat,2,Tue Apr 28 14:39:40 2015 UTC,"Really nice fit. But I agree with the other posters that the pants are a bit weird, but I dont know what pants would be better suited."

malefashion,341570,teckneaks,10,Mon Apr 27 14:12:10 2015 UTC,"I was so excited when I heard this was getting released, but the end result was a bit disappointing. This seemed to be a quick recap of why Martin Margiela matters in fashion history. I was hoping for a little deeper dive either in unknown facts about the maison or in commentary about his influence.  Ultimately, this seems like a 15 intro course to the house. Yet another PR move by Only the Brave (similar to all their cutesy promo videos, appointing Galliano as CD, etc) to justify keeping the maison around despite dwindling profits. I just wish they'd either let Margiela thrive in its niche, or end it. Explaining a brand that's supposed to be shrouded in secret is silly."

Lurk around on Grailed, SZ, and Sufu and you'll find lots of stuff for decent prices.  Knowing your measurements is really important for being able to visualize clothes on your self, but in my experience, trial and error is a big part of it. Every brand has a different idea of sizing and whatnot, so it just takes time to find ones that work."

malefashion,33qrp8,SisterRayVU,4,Fri Apr 24 19:17:52 2015 UTC,I definitely agree about the jeans thing. Time to go look for some 501s at the thrift store. What would yoh have suggested had you been criticizing the shoes?
malefashion,33qrp8,SisterRayVU,2,Fri Apr 24 19:57:35 2015 UTC,Eh I like the shoes with the outfit. I don't have anything in mind. A variety of things would work from AF1's to Chucks in a lot of colors to this.

malefashion,33qrp8,madnessman,5,Sat Apr 25 00:47:14 2015 UTC,Agreed. I think the bottom half really makes the fit. Going for standard sneakers would make this fit too generic to be interesting.

What's under your wait is what's making this fit though to me though, but I guess people have different opinions.

malefashion,33ql99,EJ-ericjackson,7,Fri Apr 24 18:19:13 2015 UTC,"A serious subject but approached from the wrong direction. They mention it in the Telegraph article, but as long as you can go fill up several bags with clothes from primark or places like that for next to nothing, it's hard to make people focus on where clothes are made. And another point, maybe it's the cynic in me, but all these internet-revolutions has lost their real impacts when they pop up every other month, all with actual problems that needs solving, but people only get super-hyped about it, than forget everything about it a couple of months later kony12."
malefashion,33ql99,filipsize,15,Fri Apr 24 20:16:22 2015 UTC,"Disagree completely. Will something like this make people forgo buying MiC and sweatshop labor clothes? Of course not, but nobody can posture as if the discussion isn't significantly more prevalent now.  I wish American Apparel didn't suck because it really, really could have been (and maybe still could be) much more than it is. People actually care about disappearing jobs, the value of labor, and how decisions we make here impact people in China or India or Malaysia. Does this mean people stop going to Target, H&M, or Uniqlo? Obviously not, but it means that at some point, they may decide to pay a few more dollars for an ethically made shirt.  It's easy to be cynical about people hopping from one vogue issue to the next, but I'd rather look at it positively. People who never even considered income inequality at least know what the ""1%"" means. The NSA is something a lot of people joke about now who never would have knows what it was beforehand. It's harder for people to keep up the energy about starvation and exploitation half a world away, but it was stuff like this that helped people come around to gay rights, makes them more aware of trans* issues, and just a little more conscious in general. The ""Patriarchy"" may be a meme and sort of a joke among some people online, but do you know how many more people know at least a little bit about feminist issues today compared to five years ago?   Awareness absolutely matters because it translates into little actions that cumulatively make a difference. It's not a sea change and it's not a quick fix, but I'd rather have more conscious people maybe change a small part of their behavior and see that it does something to stop an oppressive system than not. It's hard for people to care about sweatshops in India but it's easy to care about American/British jobs."
malefashion,33ql99,SisterRayVU,11,Fri Apr 24 20:46:39 2015 UTC,"I really love stuff like this, it's very bottom up and approaches the subject in a way which can often come across over bearing to those it's supposed to make aware of the issue. No one likes to be told what they're doing is awful and they're terrible people to buy clothes, but things like this use influencers and popular designers to say ""hey you can still do this stuff, but just be mindful of your impact"" which leaves a positive aftertaste opposed to a bitter pill to swallow. Some may criticise it for being a bit tokenistic or armchair activism but it's small things like this which can get people to start thinking and snowball years down the line.   I heard about this from Christopher Raeburns insta (the guy is wearing this seasons parachute sweater) he is one of my Absalute favourite designers and very much in my eyes, the spear head of ethical luxury fashion. I've visited his studio and spoke to him and his team briefly, the passion is held throughout the company to make clothes in their small little studio, or ethically around the world while still putting out stellar shows and clothing. The several bits I have from packable Blazers to iridescent chinos and hats are all amazing and I look forward to his whimsical shows every season. Although I wish they would stop using leather pull tabs and bags!"
malefashion,33ql99,erolsonhue,3,Fri Apr 24 19:28:23 2015 UTC,"Anytime I see some sort of advocacy in fashion I chuckle at the inherent hypocrisy of it all.  This is no different, as it seems to be lead by well meaning people who really don't understand the problem.  Our economic model is far more to blame than fashion for poor labour conditions.  Do I want people to buy fast fashion? No.  I think it's a blight on our society, but you can't expect people making minimum-median wage to spend a lot on their clothes, for fair labour practices,  when they are struggling to pay their bills and debts."
malefashion,33ql99,ninosdeudores,2,Sun Apr 26 16:12:33 2015 UTC,"But I think the issue is you don't need to spend a lot on your clothes. I agree that expecting people making little money to prioritize that over food, rent, etc., is foolish, the same way it's also foolish to tell people who don't make a lot of money to buy ""better"" food, but for someone who is reasonably middle class, American Apparel is a decent alternative."
malefashion,33ql99,SisterRayVU,1 point,Sun Apr 26 19:38:29 2015 UTC,"Yes, but then you can say that American Apparel is a bad choice because their CEO sexually harassed his employees with impunity and that their advertising is tantamount to child pornography."

My point was more that when it comes to campaigns like this there is always something to critique, or a reason to boycott. Heck, if you're looking for a reason, you could refuse to wear Rick Owens because the man lives in France and refuses to learn French."
malefashion,33ql99,ninosdeudores,2,Mon Apr 27 14:58:57 2015 UTC,"Well no, I disagree that you can always find a ""reason to boycott."" This isn't about agreeing with a brand, the director, etc., it's about ethical production of clothing. Dov Charney is a skeevy motherfucker who uses his power to take advantage of women who want to work for him. Arguably, that gets to the ethics of the clothes because he was such a huge part of AA. Whoever runs the show now may be a bad person but they aren't synonymous with the brand like he was, so that aspect isn't relevant anymore."

malefashion,33qij8,timmmmmay,8,Sat Apr 25 06:15:55 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure whether you understand fashion at all.  In no way is this Rick Owens outfit supposed to be ""flattering,"" a lot of high end ""avant-garde"" fashion doesn't cater to the ""flattering"" of the human body whatsoever. There's more anatomical cuts for certain brands, and there's the total rejection of contemporary notions of ""fit"" for others.  Why would you not consider this to be fashionable? Can the term ""fashionable"" even be properly defined?  And as for the fit being easy to pull off, is this even relevant to the discussion? Again, how does it being easy to pull off suddenly make it not fashionable? And if it's irrelevant, why bring it up?  What do you even want?"
malefashion,33qij8,Pulselol,35,Fri Apr 24 23:29:13 2015 UTC,What? A lot of Rick is meant to be flattering to one's physique. Rick celebrates the human form more than most avant-garde designers.
malefashion,33qij8,timmmmmay,2,Sat Apr 25 04:05:54 2015 UTC,"Are you just spouting whatever is tossed around on the internet? You can clearly see for yourself that Rick's clothing isn't always form fitting. Skirt pod shorts, his FW13 shearling jackets, geobaskets, his oversized geo sweater... all of these items are incredibly oversized and reject all modern notions of ""fit."""
malefashion,33qij8,Pulselol,13,Sat Apr 25 06:57:25 2015 UTC,"Sounds like you've only ever seen Rick on the runway and never actually worn. What's next, Thom Browne only designs for football players and funeral directors?"
malefashion,33qij8,timmmmmay,-1,Sat Apr 25 14:33:03 2015 UTC,I actually own a lot of Rick? What's with the insults?
malefashion,33qij8,SisterRayVU,2,Sat Apr 25 18:40:48 2015 UTC,"Not meant as a personal insult. You initially say:   a lot of high end ""avant-garde"" fashion doesn't cater to the ""flattering"" of the human body whatsoever.   and then go on to say:   Are you just spouting whatever is tossed around on the internet?   when I say:   A lot of Rick is meant to be flattering to one's physique.   When you see Rick worn on the street it is much more frequently in a way that accentuates rather than masks the body. I don't seek out Rick Owens' interviews or whatever but from the ones I've seen it's abundantly clear that celebrating the human form is central to the brand's DNA. Just look at how the dude wears his tees, and compare it to how OP wears his tees... emphasis on the hips.  This is in contrast to the more dramatic proportion play seen on the runway. Because that's what the runway is for. And if you dissect those runway looks to piece together an interpretation of the brand you're going to end up with utterly ridiculous conclusions like ""the idea of Rick flattering the physique is shit that's tossed around the internet."""
malefashion,33qij8,timmmmmay,3,Sat Apr 25 19:04:23 2015 UTC,"I didn't intend for you to take offense (if you did) to my statement - it's just that ""the idea of Rick flattering the physique"" is rampant in most fashion related boards. While I wholeheartedly agree that some of Rick's clothing IS meant to be form fitting, I do not with your assumption that it is central to the brand's DNA.  Take a look at these examples:  1 2 3  All of these are of Rick wearing his own things. In fact, he only wears his own designs. Most people wouldn't be able to tell that he's 6'0 from those pictures, as his proportions are ""off"" from his garments.   Most of Rick's tees are form fitting because they're a sheer material that he enjoys using and presumably because he (as a designer) thinks that they should fit close to the body. This doesn't always carry on to the rest of his garments, as demonstrated by the examples above. In fact, if you were not able to see his legs, I doubt anybody would assume that he worked out.  The runway isn't for ""more dramatic proportion play,"" it's for whatever the hell he wants to put up. Rick has always shied away from the concept of couture, preferring to make clothes that he deems to be ""wearable"" (this was in a passage in his massive book)."
malefashion,33qij8,SisterRayVU,3,Sat Apr 25 19:27:12 2015 UTC,"Agreed regarding the first two (I actually find the third very flattering in the body and sleeves -- it's just not body-hugging) but I feel those are more the exception than the norm (though of course at this point our interpretations of the ""norm"" depends on our personal range of experiences and can't go further without some sort of comparative database of dick pics, and you apparently own more Rick than me as long as you own more than zero Rick pieces so this argument sort of dies there).   I think my last statement was misconstrued as well because I didn't type it very clearly, I didn't meant o say the runway's purpose was for more dramatic proportion play, the causal relationship should be  reversed there, with the true purpose of the runway (in my eyes) is to illustrate the designer's particular vision for a season without needing to be limited by practicality or wearability (most clearly seen with Thom Browne FW12)... and proportion play more dramatic than what's seen in real life often plays a large part in that."
malefashion,33qij8,Pulselol,2,Sat Apr 25 20:11:10 2015 UTC,"Dude, not everything by Rick flatters the body, but most of his stuff is pretty flattering. Maybe Rick himself likes to wear chunkier pieces, maybe he dresses up for the runway, or maybe he was cold, but look at his outwear and the anatomical cuts and seams. Beyond that, there was that cute story about Rick buying a Strike Gold (I think) flannel so I'm not sure he only wears his stuff."

malefashion,33qij8,nytel,5,Sat Apr 25 06:55:43 2015 UTC,I think I can try and rephrase what he's saying for you: just because you're wearing clothes with a big price tag doesn't mean you wear them well or look good in them.

But if you think that entire style is bunk then guess it's just not your thing."
malefashion,33qij8,BluntSmokinAnus,3,Fri Apr 24 20:34:31 2015 UTC,Fashion isn't about making fits that are flattering. If it was everyone would just wear tight fitting clothes. Gtfo

malefashion,33npn1,Bemuzed,1 point,Sun Apr 26 02:47:37 2015 UTC,Don't particularly like the black boots; they don't contrast well with the navy colour scheme of the jeans and jacket and so just stick out awkwardly.
malefashion,33npn1,False_Dreamer,2,Fri Apr 24 01:16:39 2015 UTC,"What sort of shoes would you recommend? I do need to buy some more dress shoes, can't wear sneakers at work.."
malefashion,33nyug,NachosWithBeans,79,Fri Apr 24 01:56:03 2015 UTC,"First off, it's Purple Label. All of RL Purple Label shirts are between 450-700. It comes with the name and the line.   As for this shirt, it seems like the Jacquard print would take a lot of extra attention to detail to make this shirt and with that comes a hefty price. Also, factor in the materials used in this piece. Very high thread count cotton and almost definitely hand finished details.   All of these factors, combined with the Ralph Lauren name, make this shirt the 700 dollar price tag it is.   Fucking crazy if you ask me."
malefashion,33nyug,gevans10576,12,Fri Apr 24 02:14:21 2015 UTC,"And it is made in Italy. People like to complain about the low wages in Asia, but paying for 1st world labour really does increase the price significantly. Plus everything gevans said."
malefashion,33nyug,tcbarb,51,Sat Apr 25 08:28:43 2015 UTC,Because it's Ralph tho.
malefashion,33nyug,Wky,42,Fri Apr 24 03:17:10 2015 UTC,"Rich people don't live like you and I. Imagine working a fencing job at 16 years old. It's your first job. You're new to South Florida. You're a ginger. By God, you burn, motherfucker.   Like. A. Motherfucker.  For how much? $5 an hour. CASH! Clutch paper flow, right? You work a 40 hour week for the first time in your life. That's $200 for the non-mathletes.   Now you got that money after 16 years of mommy buying your clothes.   ""Not that shirt, too expensive.""   ""We can find the same shirt at Marshall's maybe.""  Mom, can I get this Misfits t-shirt from Hot Topic?  ""I'm not paying $15 for a rag with a skull on it.""  Well, fuck that shit. I'm a goddamned man now, mommy.   You ride your skateboard down to BC Surf and Sport on Federal hwy, grab a new pair of shoes, a new deck for your ripstick and by all that's holy you buy a branded t-shirt at retail price.  AND OH FUCK DOESNT THAT SHIT FEEL GOOD! THAT'S $21.19 AFTER TAXES! MORE THAN 10% OF YOUR TEENAGE NET WORTH!  I imagine it's difficult to get that same feeling as a rich person, so there's naturally a market for exorbitantly priced materials."
malefashion,33nyug,panzergling,9,Fri Apr 24 17:39:37 2015 UTC,"Because people will pay for it. All the construction, fabric, quality, and details are great and certainly in-line with the brand. Likewise with the pricing, it's based on what they expect buyers are willing to pay. You and I may not be these people, and that's fine."
malefashion,33nyug,squatsforlunch,13,Fri Apr 24 07:18:42 2015 UTC,"RL Purple Label uses very high quality fabrics, and as said, usually has a fair amount of hand finishing. There is going to be markup for the name, but as far as luxury brands the quality is usually fantastic. It would be up to you if it's worth it, and you may prefer Kiton or Borrelli, but i wouldn't say it's a bad price considering the quality."
malefashion,33nyug,Unhelpful_Suggestion,4,Fri Apr 24 03:59:40 2015 UTC,"Prestige pricing, sure there's a lot of detail that went into making the shirt from fantastic materials but some people are willing to pay the high price for exclusivity or to be seen wearing the brand."
malefashion,33nyug,Lord_of_the_Dance,2,Fri Apr 24 16:21:14 2015 UTC,"Why does anything cost what it does?  ANSWER: Because enough people will buy it to make it profitable.  Some people covet exclusivity.  They're willing to pay more to have something others cannot have or afford.  So, fashion designers create items with blah blah this and blah blah that in order to (wink wink) justify absurd prices.  A shirt made with custom thread weaved by the daughters of ex-monks and buttons made by the illegitimate children of rappers' unknown brothers.  $2,000 each.  Cha-CHING.  They won't sell many, but they don't have to.  They only have to sell enough to turn a profit.  Insane prices have higher profit margins, obviously."
malefashion,33nyug,Neapola,1 point,Fri Apr 24 20:38:38 2015 UTC,"by percentage prob still less overpriced than h&m @ retail. that being said, i would never buy a cotton shirt for 700$. and i buy some expensive shit. if you are into this style, rl purple lable on sale or 2nd hand can be a very good deal though"
malefashion,33nyug,abagofit,3,Fri Apr 24 06:43:45 2015 UTC,"What do you mean ""by percentage""?"
malefashion,33nyug,kpals,17,Fri Apr 24 11:06:20 2015 UTC,"If h&m makes a shirt for $0.10 and sells it for $10, that is 10,000% markup. If rl makes a shirt for $70 and sells it for $700, that is only a 1000% markup. No idea whether true or not. Just an example of what it could look like"
malefashion,33nyug,Lusit_,3,Fri Apr 24 13:20:48 2015 UTC,I'd imagine it costs even a little more than that too make the shirt as well based on the fact that there are probably some hand finished stuff
malefashion,33nyug,shallow-,1 point,Sat Apr 25 07:22:10 2015 UTC,"and you also have to consider tariffs/the cost of importing non-domestic made items (which I think people usually forget about)  the production of a shirt like this, factoring in materials, wage in non-slave labor factories, shipping and import costs (if bought non domestically/not online), and QC, is pretty high.  a supreme bogo resales (retails) for 200+"
malefashion,33nyug,ddak88,1 point,Mon Apr 27 23:30:38 2015 UTC,"High end luxury goods usually have higher margins, so they seem disproportionately more expensive (for the expected increase in quality, whatever that means)."
malefashion,33nyug,shallow-,17,Fri Apr 24 06:20:56 2015 UTC,"Higher margins? No they don't.  Nike has something like a 700-1000% margin, fast fashion places have similar margins.  If Rick had that kind of markup Geos would be like 3k."
malefashion,33nyug,thrashbat,5,Fri Apr 24 08:25:21 2015 UTC,Any data to back that up? because here's some analysis that shows Nike earns $21.50 profit from their $100 shoes.  http://solecollector.com/news/how-much-it-costs-nike-to-make-a-100-shoe/
malefashion,33nyug,Omnislip,4,Fri Apr 24 09:22:19 2015 UTC,"I think he's just talking about the cost price of the shoe itself vs the sale price.   Not taking into account distribution, advertising costs, etc."
malefashion,33nyug,ddak88,18,Fri Apr 24 09:25:52 2015 UTC,There is absolutely no reason you should not take those costs into account!
malefashion,33nyug,Anaract,3,Fri Apr 24 10:22:03 2015 UTC,That's the opposite of higher margins!

malefashion,33nyug,TRY_LSD,1 point,Fri Apr 24 16:21:52 2015 UTC,"it's from the highest-end line of an already very high-end company that is probably the most famous ""rich people clothes"" company in the world. They can charge whatever the fuck the want for anything and certain people will buy it.   that said, I'm sure it is very nice quality and the jacquard print is probably an expensive detail."
malefashion,33nyug,theloniousfunkd,1 point,Sun Apr 26 04:01:32 2015 UTC,"so jacquard is a really interesting and expensive fabric. if you look closely at the fabric there's a pattern on it. most patterns, especially camo, are printed on top of the fabric. they weave the fabric and then print the pattern on top, kind of like making the canvas and then painting on it.   but with jacquard, the pattern is actually woven in as the fabric is created. this means two things. 1) the pattern is actually part of the fabric, not printed on top. 2) this is a much more expensive process because the setup and testing for this specific print takes longer than just making a white shirting fabric that could then be printed on. but when you feel jacquard, you will understand how much nicer it is. it feels like the pattern was the intention from the start, not slapped on after the fact."
