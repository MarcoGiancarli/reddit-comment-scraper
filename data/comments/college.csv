If that's the case- you probably won't need a full out suit and tie- most people go to events and interviews in business casual type attire (at least for the tech companies). But it definitely won't hurt to bring it.

college,3e3pry,chevybow,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:57:22 2015 UTC,"Even for interviews- places like google don't require suits.   It's definitely not required in the workforce and day-to-day job.  However, there really is no excuse not to wear dress shoes and a button-down shirt to an interview.  Use your best judgement about a tie and/or jacket and try and match or exceed the general vibe by one level, but ""not required"" shouldn't even be in your vocabulary until you have a job offer in writing.  I have literally gotten low-level jobs where the manager told me I was the ""only one to dress like I was going to a job interview, so the interview process was a formality.""  They notice.  It's not about dressing like you already have the job.  It's about dressing like you respect your interviewer's time."

If you're thinking of going to CC and sending your AP score there, then having the AP score now turned to credits transfer over to the university, it's not going to work. AP scores will only count as credit at the school that accepts it. Yes, the 3 may transfer as HIST 1450 (made that up) when you send it to CC, but the CC will label it as an AP credit, so it can't be transferred.   I wish there was a way to cheat the system, or else I wouldn't have had to send my AP scores to 3 different schools while I was transferring."

It's not like high school where you see the same people almost every day and feel socially connected. Because of the size of most colleges (unless you are attending a small liberal arts college), you may see someone frequently when taking a class with them, but never see them again after the quarter or semester. I think this is one of the reasons why people can feel isolated during their first year in college."

Also, something that surprised me the most was how the people I was friends with my first semester I barely knew by the end of the year, let alone by graduation. A lot of your freshman year friends are friends by coincidence - you're thrown into some orientation group with them and you become buddies even though you don't have much in common, then you find your own friend groups that you're more compatible with and you drift apart. Its fascinating really.  Here I am a year into grad school and I don't actually really speak to any of my college friends."

Hell, it even seems like sometimes teachers are trying to make you fail in college. But that's just an initial reaction to being challenged, I think.  If I have any advice, I say, have an open mind to difficult situations and learn from every experience. Meaning, you will probably learn the most from the teachers that are the most difficult. These difficult teachers don't only teach you the material but are usually difficult because they challenge your time management skills and other random things. It prepares you in the long run, and you will thank them for it. I didn't at first, but I did once I realized I could either be mad about things or accept them and grow from them."
college,3e2sof,intprecipitation,10,Tue Jul 21 18:21:27 2015 UTC,"Developing an academic work ethic. It doesn't matter if you're interested in a subject, the goal is to better yourself. Passing classes – personally – was easy without studying. I entered college assuming this method would work and it didn't. It took me awhile (from freshman into sophomore year) to learn how to prioritize my studies without sacrificing my personal life. I also had to fail a class which definitely provided a resounding slap in the face. But once you develop your own schedule and prioritize your learning, everything will fall into place.  My suggestion? Treat your college career like a job: you put in X number of hours a day (substituting class time) and you work until Y. Once Y comes around, you stop working. Give yourself time to relax after Y. I'm working towards a PhD right now and this method is the only thing keeping me sane. I wake up at 7, read and write, exercise, eat right (a difficult task in college), and still call it quits at 5:30 every day. I'm sure it'd work for undergrad."

However, applications were an entirely different beast. I could apply the concepts in some ways, ways that interested me. I was driven to learn those myself. But college requires thorough comprehension, which can only be achieved through extensive application... even outside of what one finds interesting. For me, that took the most work, about 10-15 hours to learn material from a new chapter until I started working on a schedule.   I'm still trying to discipline myself to work this way, and its really hard - time management has been the most helpful thing I've learned about, but it has been the hardest for me to keep up with. I'd rather not adopt the practice, but it is just so darn beneficial. It feels so nice to work for a set amount of time and not feel guilty for stopping at a certain point and saying ""I've met my quota for the day, I have earned my free time."" Whereas when I didn't have a schedule I would just punish myself for procrastinating, and studying too long and be stressed out the entire time, not absorbing anything because I was worried about the deadline... its exhausting."

I honestly don't know how anyone working in financial aid can work there knowing there are people that cannot afford the ever rising cost of education. I'm in community college part time and a part time worker.So depending on what happens I'll be 26 by the time i can graduate (maybe). It's a disgrace how the college system is made to put the student in debt know matter what. You can work a bum job making chump change and every semester you can give most of what you earn to the college as the bill increase and the federal government tells you you're not eligible for Aid. Then the College tricks you into loans that will keep you in debt for a long time. Or you can be broke in college and not work at all and have to pay back everything when you graduate. I'm going to pull through the best I can but overall getting into college is a very risky thing if you do not learn the system and don't bust your ass both in income and in the classroom

It took me that first semester to realize that you have to do it for yourself. Your parents aren't going to do it, you're professors aren't, nor is anyone else there going to do things for you.

Maybe they're planning on posting a job soon, or know about something.  They will be more inclined to help you when they understand that it's the work that they are doing that you find valuable.  Pick a few places at first that you'd be fine working at but ok if you're snubbed.  That will warm you up for the big calls to the places you know you want to work. You want to feel over-prepared, but not cocky.  That's the sweet spot.  RESEARCH them before calling.  N.B. this only works for positions that pick up the phone.  The vast majority of positions should be applied for via regular channels.   Also, look at student job postings.  Working for a college department could be fun/good for resume/connections."

So, your goal is to make sure it's not an equal comparison, and that you're more qualified.  There's no reason a guy can't get these jobs.

What would have helped, and what is sorely lacking in most college graduates (STEM majors and liberal arts majors alike) is the ability to write - the ability to write clearly, coherently, and when necessary convincingly.  I have round-filed cover letters from Ivy League graduates who cannot compose a grammatically correct sentence and cannot communicate a clear thought.

Basic rules of real world writing:  Concision: Don't use 40 words when 3 does the trick.  Embellishments: Don't use them.  Ever.  Good - The policy increased usage of the fund.  Bad - The significant new policy dramatically increased usage of the fund.  Punctuation: If your sentence has more than 2 commas, you're doing it wrong.  If you include anything more advanced than a comma, you're doing it wrong.  If you want your course to be helpful to the majority of your students, don't mistake them for rhetoric majors.  Most of them, if they write at all in their careers, will be writing business or policy documents.

Occupy wasn't really my thing, but every class he pushed us to think outside the box, open out minds, take in all points of view, and then express our feels. Upon graduating, I still feel it was one of the best classes I had taken."
college,3e2cej,JBean85,4,Tue Jul 21 14:08:58 2015 UTC,"Well it's been 10 years since taking English 101 and 102, but the things that stick out in my mind are: - when lecturing, speak clearly. My 102 instructor ummed and uhhed enough that one day when I kept track I counted 25 in under 5 minutes. I get that we all need a second here and there to think of the next word coming out of our mouths, but this was overly excessive.  - I hated assignments involving non-literary elements. For example, we had one assignment where we had to go around campus and write (critique?) about the artwork in various locations.  - finally, I've supervised a writing center and taught a university 101 class. Many freshmen come into the university not knowing how to properly construct an essay. Teach them how to write an essay properly."
college,3e2cej,SillyJane,3,Tue Jul 21 15:19:11 2015 UTC,"At my school, the english 100 teachers have a ton of freedom over what they teach, which was nice. It was the first english class of my life that I truly enjoyed (reading and writing are not my favorite things - chem major). We didn't have to read any old classic novels or short stories, and I appreciated that so much. We read a lot of things with good imagery and nature themes (my teacher was a poet and environmental scientist). As a science major, it was refreshing to read stuff that wasn't totally uninteresting. That all kinda depends on your interests though.  Some other stuff that I enjoyed from freshman english was doing various ""field trips."" We went to the art museum on campus to write during one class. One day we had class on one of the docks on the lake. One day we toured the facility where dairy products are made on campus (it was somehow relevant to a project we did). We also had a day in the library learning about all the help that the library can provide and how to do research and whatnot. Basically getting out of the classroom once in a while was really nice.  One last thing: as a shy kid who isn't very good at asking for help, I really appreciated that our teacher required everyone to do a 15-20 minute conference with her to talk about our papers before handing them in. It helped a lot with making our essays better."
college,3e2cej,skierface,3,Tue Jul 21 17:39:23 2015 UTC,"My ENG 101 class was terrific, the material we covered were chosen by the students in the class and there was a lot of active interaction between students and professor. Although the focus was more on how to write academic papers, the topics we wrote were more on the side of popular culture. We wrote about commercial packaging, film comparisons of the magical negro and white savior, compared two advertisements and analyzed gender stereotypes, and the last one was a comparison on whatever stereotype you wanted in some form of media. These topics kept us, the students, really engaged because we could relate and voice an opinion on the topics.  We went over how to express ideas from different points of views. Doing he/she said, and agree/disagree. Introductions - specifically working on different ways to introduce topics that will interest the readers. Different ways to compare and contrast, taking full use of transition words. Sentence structures and diction. Lastly, we worked on expressing ideas concisely.  The most important thing I took away from my ENG 101 class was always going back to read and edit after your first draft. It made it so much easier to just let ideas pour out then go back to refine them afterwards.  P.S. Having a page range (4-5) instead of a word count helped me get through the assignments easier. I wasn't as worried about having x amounts of word so I wasn't bullshitting sentences or adding in fluff. Instead I was more concern that my ideas were meaningful and added to the essay than it was to meet a word count."
college,3e2cej,kitpanda,2,Tue Jul 21 18:52:31 2015 UTC,"Congrats on your placement at Michigan! ;)  I had to write about someone in my life was inspirational. It was a terrible assignment since there was no real argument to be made, just a bunch of opinions.   My advice is to give students concrete assignments with clear direction, at least to start."
college,3e2uff,bluntasaurus420,3,Tue Jul 21 15:09:18 2015 UTC,"Typically, a community college is a good place to start. Visit/contact the admissions office as well as the financial aid office. They should be able to help you get your foot in the door with how to register and receive financial aid."
college,3e2uff,mindaq,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:05:07 2015 UTC,"Financial aid wise, you should fill out the FAFSA form https://fafsa.ed.gov/. You may qualify for grants from the government or, if you want to take loans, loans with subsidized (i.e. much lower than private loans) interest rates. I believe the deadline for the 2015-2016 year FAFSA has passed already, but you could try to contact your college's financial aid office to perhaps get some scholarship or grant pointers.  As for enrolling in classes and such, it highly depends on how your specific community college is run. Registration and enrollment for my local community college can be done pretty much by yourself online. However, if you need additional guidance, perhaps your community college offers orientation sessions or something to that extent."

college,3e4h0l,chevybow,2,Tue Jul 21 22:39:27 2015 UTC,"It may be harder to get into a university with non-accredited courses because they will have to specifically evaluate if your courses are on par with those at an accredited high school. In my opinion, transferring to an accredited school is worth it, even if it means taking additional tests. It not only gives you an actual degree, but proves you're capable of handling courses on the level of an accredited school.  Side note: If you decide to stay at your non-accredited school, it would be suggestible to take the GED or whatever high school equivalency test is applicable because you will essentially not have a high school diploma in the eyes of anyone who asks for a high school degree in the future."
college,3e4h0l,paeder85,1 point,Wed Jul 22 02:46:11 2015 UTC,"Maybe try to reach out to admissions at the universities you are interested in and ask them if they would accept a degree from your school.  As a side note, if you do not get an associates degree the high school diploma may pose an issue in future employment. Backgrounds and education verifications often check the validity of the high school when you apply for a job."
college,3e4d0s,IronGoomba,2,Tue Jul 21 21:27:09 2015 UTC,"Highly recommend you read the FAQ over at /r/personalfinance.  As a brief primer: a credit card basically works like a debit card, except it is not connected directly to your bank account. Instead, when you buy something with it, it will rack up a balance that you must pay by the end of the month. If you don't pay in time, you will be charged interest, and suddenly the $100 console you bought will cost $112 to pay off. If you don't pay the next month, it will cost even more.   You may be wondering why you should get a credit card in the first place. If you use it well (pay it off every month, on time), it helps build credit. This will allow you to get better terms on larger, more important loans later in life, like a car loan or a mortgage. You can also get pretty nice rewards just by using certain cards, like cash back or travel points.  Read the FAQ for more info. And, no matter what, do NOT use your credit card to buy something you wouldn't normally be able to afford. It is merely for convenience, not a source of unlimited money! Pay it off in full every month."
college,3e4d0s,Landolphin,2,Tue Jul 21 21:42:31 2015 UTC,"In addition to what Landolphin said, I treat my credit card like my debit card. If I only have $100 in my checking account, I won't put more than $100 on my credit card. As long as you pay your balance off each month in full and on time, you won't have to worry about any interest rates or crippling debt."
college,3e4d0s,mindaq,0,Tue Jul 21 21:59:23 2015 UTC,"Obviously do your research, check our /r/personalfinance as mentioned. If I could tell my younger self advice, I would get a credit card and just use it for gas and snacks. Keep a low balance on it month to month and don't be late on payments. Knowing how to use a credit card to boost your credit score is really where their usefulness comes into play. It's a way to build a record that you are a responsible dependable person with your money and that will pay dividends later in life with a high credit score and getting low interest rates"

I don't want to face anyone that's my age, as they are years ahead of me, and I feel like a failure. My relatives and friends keep asking me about my education and it creates pressure."

Start here: https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/depression/index.shtml   Depression and anxiety often occur together. Sadly, some countries are not very well tuned in to the idea of depression as a mental health issue.

Perhaps you could find a medication that works, and then when your anxiety is more controlled, you'd feel talking to someone would be beneficial.

You might email an academic adviser for the university and explain your situation to get a sure answer.

I already have an ok job   Before you do anything else, find out if your work has a Tuition Reimbursement program.  They may, they may not, and they may with reservations.  For example my work will pay 100% of a Computer Science degree as a software developer, but will pay 0% of a Management degree because although they may promote me to manager after I get the degree, it's not in my current job description.  Do your research.  You can save a lot of money by picking the right major and getting someone else to foot the bill.   but the college says if I go back now I need to go an entire 30 credit hours (a full year)   Not really worth it if you already have a job; only worthwhile if you're still struggling to break into the industry.  One semester (15 credits) I could see, but not 2+.   and that it would somewhat override my BS in CS degree.   Seems to me like it would compliment it.  It's a related field (did you notice how many Math and CS classes overlap?) so it's not the same as deciding to be a Mathematician or Biologist.  Instead, it's more about being the Math guy with a software specialty, or the CS guy that can do higher level analytic work.   ( I am in software development but want to be more in research I think).   You can do that with your B.S.  Get two or three years of work experience and start applying for research-oriented jobs.  A Masters helps, but it's not a requirement by any means.   A computer science degree would further my career more than the Math degree would   You'd be surprised.  A Masters in Computer Science is very useful for people with a BS in another field, but not for those with a BS in Computer Science.  For those who already have a BS in Computer Science, an MS in Computer Science is worth about $5000 more per year.  Branching out into complementary or specialization fields (math, physics, etc.) is more financially rewarding.  That's not to say it won't benefit you or that I don't know people who have done it, just that you may get more bang for your buck complimenting your current education rather than extending it deeper into the same topics.   Am I being irrational for wanting a Mathematics degree?   I wouldn't do the Undergraduate degree.  A Masters in Mathematics at the stage you're at seems reasonable to me, though."

Do you have reason to believe you have specific problems with your writing, or with the course in general? Could you just go to the professor and discuss why you feel you are struggling? If it is the writing, maybe s/he could even take a quick look at your paper before you have to turn in the next one."
college,3e2l66,ProfessorUnrat,2,Tue Jul 21 14:49:32 2015 UTC,"well i believe i have issues with my writing, which is why i took the course: to improve them. there is a serious priority of my grade, however, so while i would like to improve my writing, i'd like to also get a good grade, too. but i can't improve my writing (or survive with a good grade) if i don't know what to improve on since my professor gives the papers back so late.   i spoke with him and told him that i can't improve if i don't know what to improve on. he does take a quick look at our drafts (which aren't graded) before we turn in our actual polished essays but that doesn't leave a window large enough to consider what i need to improve on because by then, the second draft of a separate paper is already written. hypothetically if my writing does suck (as he determines from my first essay i turned in) and i consequently write a terrible second essay, then i am not only wasting my time writing said second essay because i clearly have things to improve on, based on the late returned first essay, but i therefore am scrapping parts my second essay to accommodate the comments from my first essay -- which all could have been avoided the first time if i just had my first essay to model from to begin with.  in other words, there isn't enough time, and of the little time i do have, it's wasted continuing to write a bad essay (only because i don't know what to improve on)."
college,3e2l66,ProfessorUnrat,3,Tue Jul 21 15:12:11 2015 UTC,"You might appeal to the professor for an extension of the deadline on the second paper until the first paper is returned (assuming that is fairly soon), explaining why you feel the feedback (esp. since he is a careful marker) will be very important to you.   Although it won't solve your immediate dilemma, you should comment on any course evaluation how this scheduling hurts your chances to improve your writing during the course."

college,3e2hm2,ChaoticxSerenity,2,Tue Jul 21 16:36:13 2015 UTC,"I found that my social anxiety stemmed from worrying that I was doing something wrong. It made me resentful towards other people, so I avoided them. But, I realized I had to get rid of my anxiety if I wanted to have a life. I identified that I was being unnecessarily critical of others. So I convinced myself that everyone had something to offer. If I just gave them a chance, and tried to see what was good about them, I would learn to get along. I did eventually. After realizing that, it became clear. I needed to stop being critical of myself! My anxiety was stemming from a fear of not being perfect! So, over a year or so, I convinced myself that there was nothing wrong with me, and that I had things to offer, even if I didn't think so. Eventually I started seeing a change - people didn't want to leave conversation with me like they used to, they stayed. I realized everyone feels anxious sometimes, and the more confident we are towards each other, the more accepting we are of them and ourselves, the more likely we are to get along. Overtime, it just becomes natural and your thoughts just change. It can take years, but it will be worth it. It will benefit you the rest of your life.  So, literally, be yourself and know that who you are is not a bad thing, and destroy that feeling deep down inside you that says ""You need to be different than who you are!"" I know that saying ""be yourself"" sounds simple, and I know it's easier said than done, but really all you have to do, is respond the way you feel like responding to people and knowing theres nothing wrong with how you respond, regardless of what anyone else thinks. It will be forced at first, but will eventually become natural. It takes time and practice, like learning to ride a bike, and you will get better over time.  The most important thing when getting over anxiety is realizing that there is nothing wrong with you. There is no perfect way to be, and the anxiety you feel is exactly that. The feeling that you need to control your behavior so you come off as a perfect individual, but there is no perfect person. So, learn to love yourself, and once you do, people will flock to you and your confidence.  As for drinking? No way man, don't do it. Alcohol, once in the bloodstream, makes you exude a smell of alcohol and not just on your breath. It's very apparent. People might think you have a problem, especially with showing up to orientation buzzed.  TL;DR Anxiety stems from a fear of not being what others want us to be, or thinking that there is something wrong with ourselves. Anxiety is the fear of not meeting that expectation. Find out what about socializing makes you nervous if you can, find out why you think you're not performing ""up to par"" then tear that fear apart. Convince yourself there's nothing wrong with you, love yourself, *and then be yourself*. You can do it, it just takes time."

You weren't ready or motivated enough for college as a freshman, and it took some rough life experiences to learn humility.  You've learned humility and the lifelong career benefits of a formal education, and that's why you won't make the same mistakes again.  At the end of the day, lots of students fuck up for lots of reasons. That's not important. What's important is whether you've identified and corrected the problems that caused this to happen in the first place.

It would be helpful to indicate if you sought professional help, and whether or not you are continuing a program to keep it in check.  3) Understand that a lot of people aren't ready for college out of High School.  I wasn't.  So I joined the military instead after a botched attempt to ""just do it.""  Colleges understand that.  Don't be ashamed of it, but be prepared to make the case that you are now ready.

Key notable classes I can think of:   Linear Algebra Calculus 2 Combinatorics and Graph Theory Compiler Computer Science 1/2 Operating Systems Data Structures (trees, lists, etc.) Technical Writing Networking   I usually suggest interested students attempt Computer Science 1 and 2.  If you can pass those classes, there's a good chance you can learn to handle everything else the major throws at you.

When you look at mid-career numbers for physics vs. engineering Bachelor's degrees, you see a much different story: physics bachelors earn on par with engineering bachelors, most likely because a lot of these physicists are going into engineering or other, non-physics fields."

college,3dy860,grandpa_faust,4,Mon Jul 20 14:42:21 2015 UTC,"I'm going to address your concerns in the order of your bullet points. First, my credentials: I work at a college, but not in your geographical area, so I can be non-specifically specific, if that makes any sense. I also went back to college as an adult and did basically the same thing you’re doing, so I know both the student side of it as well as the administrator side of it.   Credit transfer: Depending on where your other credits were obtained and when you got them, you can probably transfer all or most of them. If you really are being required to transfer in as a sophomore, I second what u/doodlemissy said about community college first. CCs are more likely to take your credits as transfer, they cost generally less than 4-year schools—even state schools—and it will be easier to transfer to a 4-year from the position of currently attending a CC than straight off the street. Many CCs even have what are called articulation agreements with 4-year schools where students may transfer in with ""block transfers."" A block transfer means the accepting school (4-year) will take all your LDC (lower division credits) as a block and not pick it apart saying ""We'll take this class, but not that class."" I would suggest you finish being a sophomore at CC, then transfer to a 4-year school with Junior status. Speed: PLAN PLAN PLAN. You need to sit down with an academic advisor/counselor and figure out EXACTLY which classes you need. Take only those, no more, no less. You're not a kid who is feeling their oats and trying to figure out what you want in life. There is no solid reason for you to be taking experimental classes you're not sure you'll like. You need a gen ed social science class? Psych, Sociology, Anthro, History, or Political Science. Just pick one and push through it. Rinse and repeat. If you can, figure out what CC you’ll be at AND what 4-year you’re transferring to. Go over your academic plan with an advisor from both schools to make sure you’re taking the optimal classes to fill the necessary slots in your degree requirements for both schools. More on that in the next paragraph. Cost-effective. Save yourself time, money, and frustration by starting at a CC and coordinating with the 4-year school where you plan to transfer. My last year at a CC, I worked with the transfer advisor for the state college I was going to. She and I determined which classes fit both my Associate Degree requirements for the CC and which would fit nicely into my BS requirements, so I got the maximum bang for my buck. I actually took more classes than just finishing my sophomore year, though, because CC was so much cheaper, and I transferred the maximum number of Lower Division credits my 4-year school allowed. It ended up being 120 quarter credits of CC work, and I only needed 180 for my Bachelor’s, so I only had to pay for 60 credits at the higher cost. Each 4-year school has different transfer requirements, so look at all of them before you decide. Don’t discount financial aid. Even if you make a good deal of money, that doesn’t mean there aren’t scholarships and other sources of aid out there. I asked my transfer advisor when I was coming in and I ended up getting two scholarships, one specifically designed for older students and one because I had high grades. Both of these scholarships were awarded on merit alone, so it didn’t matter that on paper I seem to make a lot of money (believe me, it doesn’t feel like I make a lot of money!) Distance and other off-site courses: I'm not in your area, so I can't help you on this one specifically. What I did was to check out the OUS (Oregon University System) website and compare their transfer information. For you, there is this site that has info on the 11 colleges of the University System of Maryland http://www.usmd.edu/ and Virginia Public Universities and Colleges http://www.schev.edu/students/publiccollegelist.asp The Virginia link includes community colleges. Here is a link to the Maryland Community College group  http://www.mdacc.org/   I hope this info helps. PM me if you want more specifics. If you tell me what your major is, for instance, I can help you sort colleges and find one that might work best."

college,3dy860,JessicaGriffin,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:17:00 2015 UTC,"Ask your UDC advisor if CC is a good option, then. I'm surprised that you have completed an AA and they're transferring you in as a sophomore, rather than as a Junior. Generally in my experience, when we graduate our students with AAs, they transfer as Juniors.   The main advantage to staying at a CC as long as possible is cost. I checked UDC's site and it appears they only take up to 90 credits of transfer, which should be about the number you have for your AA, so you may not gain any advantage staying at a CC. However, I would confirm that with your UDC transfer advisor."

I know some who was in a similar situation to you, an associate's degree and credits from several other schools besides, and with all of her credits, TESC told her she would only have to take 18 credits to get a degree from them.

I would do a google search to find if the community colleges offer any kind of admissions guarantee or priority (such as honors,  or completing the core general ed classes, etc.). If you attended a regionally accredited university, you will most likely be able to transfer most of your classes, as long as they have an equivalent class.

If you don't get one this year- definitely aim to get an internship at the end of Junior year so you can graduate with some experience under your belt.
college,3dyx29,ARPK,2,Mon Jul 20 18:40:59 2015 UTC,"I did an almost six months long internship at a non-profit in LA, and I ended up doing mostly web design. I honestly didn't know what I'd end up doing at first but I went in, see what they had, and jumped at  whatever was available. Internships as a humanities major will usually end up being less focused than say what a CS students do, so keep an open mind. I transitioned from that summer internship to working in a small department on campus to do some techie work -- it was pretty much the best job I've had so far!"
college,3dyx29,DrewsephA,2,Mon Jul 20 20:58:16 2015 UTC,"Typically ""jobs"" and ""internships"" are specified when you talk about them. Usually, (almost all) internships are jobs, but not all jobs are internships. An internship is usually a job where you're more learning about an area of the job or position, rather than ""doing a job,"" such as being a cashier is a ""job,"" but you could get an ""internship"" with the store manager, which would fit into a Business Management major, for example.  As for getting one, it's pretty much whenever you want, and whenever it will fit into your schedule. If you're taking 20 credits a semester to graduate a year early so you can get into a special program and look good for grad schools, you might not want to get one during the school year, and look for a summer one instead. It really all depends on the company and internship position that you're looking for. Pretty much you do them to gain experience in the field you're interested in, so you can put that on your resume when applying for jobs. For example, without going into specifics, I'm doing a couple internships at different environmental organizations this summer, because that's what I want to do. One is working directly with the Director, and she's having me do a bunch of different things in a bunch of different departments, so that I can get an all around feel of the division and what it does. The other one, I'm working in the compliance department, learning about how they work and how they manage and enforce permits and violations and what-not.   When looking, see if your school has either a website for jobs or a student services office, either or both of those should be able to help you. Just look for something that interests you, and send an email with your resumé explaining who you are, what your major is, and why you want to work with/for them. Alternatively, if the organization/company has a corporate/local building/office that you can go to, drop off your resumé with the HR department or the front desk/secretary and just say ""hi, I'm /u/FantasyLiver, and I'm looking around for internships. Is there someone you or I could give this too?"" and then hand them the resumé. If they say ""yes I can,"" or ""yes, go over there,"" then ask the person you hand your resumé to if there's an email or phone number you can use to follow up on, and wait about 5-7 days or so, and call/email that person.   A lot of this you're going to have to look up on your own, which is mainly the point of internships. Employers want to see that you can think and act logically and independently. This is because they want to be able to tell you what your job is or what you have to do only once, and then see that you can finish it without needing someone looking over your shoulder the entire time (which is different that asking for help, which is not always a bad thing)."
college,3dyx29,rosem123,2,Mon Jul 20 18:47:23 2015 UTC,"You can find internships online or through your college. You can do them during the school year or the summer, but I have a friend who did an internship during the school year and it became too much to handle with school also. Make sure you can handle the pressure!"
college,3dyx29,blink2020,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:35:47 2015 UTC,"So internships can range from observing to basically being an unpaid employee. As for timing, it is usually in the summer, however, there are opportunities to have you work during the year as well. If you do have the opportunity to work during the year, your hours will be drastically reduced. You would typically work around 6-8 hours or so during the week during the school year and maybe around 40 hours a week during the summer. As for applying, the best way is to ask! Whatever you are majoring (most likely) has a tangible application (e.g. science major in a lab, business major at a company, etc.) Most places are fine with taking on unpaid interns. So just look around and see what you can do. Best of luck"
college,3dyx29,clearwaterrev,3,Mon Jul 20 18:40:51 2015 UTC,"internships can range from observing to basically being an unpaid employee   There are also paid internships.  It depends on the field/ industry whether internships are typically paid or unpaid.  If you're a business, engineering, or CS/IT student, internships in your field are typically paid, and often quite well.  You can make $20+ per hour as a summer intern at a large company.  Paid interns are generally expected to perform a job like a regular employee."
college,3dyx29,SmellsLikeDogBuns,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:20:37 2015 UTC,"Does your school have a career center?

Also your academic advisor might have leads."
college,3dyx29,RawhlTahhyde,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:23:40 2015 UTC,"What you'd be doing depends on the internship. Most people do internships during the summer. Others do ""co ops"" which is basically multiple internships over the course of a year or two, working during the school year as well.  You dont have to get an internship in your area of study, and having an internship is far better than not having one.  Most internships are basic auxiliary work in an office. You can get them by applying online or at career fairs, but its much easier to get them by asking around"
college,3e1bf4,Nosameel,4,Tue Jul 21 04:53:40 2015 UTC,"I was accepted into Dartmouth, Brown and Cornell. From my experience, your GPA looks fine if your course selection was hard enough. The only problem I have with your application is your test score. It's simply too low. You need to raise it to a 33 or a 34 to be considered competitive nowadays (unless you're an URM).  You will be applying to MIT through a system called CommonApp which has you list ten extracurriculars and five honors along with your essays. The best advice I could give you regarding applying to top tier schools is to specialize your extracurriculars. If you were majoring in music, make sure all your extracurriculars were related to music. Similar idea with any other major. Every applicant is some sort of varsity athlete club president, so you have to find someone to stand out.  At the end of the day, it's mostly just luck. Because thousands of similar applicants apply to these schools. So, make sure you apply to other schools as well!"
college,3e1bf4,fuzzwuzz123,4,Tue Jul 21 05:05:31 2015 UTC,You don't apply to MIT through CommonApp. They have their own application system.

I plan on majoring in engineering but I attend a small, rural school that does not provide any extracurriculars relating to the field. I mainly took music because I thought it was interesting but I didn't realize I would be a great player until a few years down the road."
college,3e1bf4,fuzzwuzz123,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:18:39 2015 UTC,"I forgot to mention the AP score thing. Don't sweat it if you got shitty scores. I did terrible on all of my AP tests and I just simply didn't send them in. Nobody knew. Likewise, I'd primarily focus on the ACT simply because you won't have to submit SAT subject test scores for many schools. I'm not sure about MIT, but I know that I didn't send a single one for any of the schools I applied for. Even if your extracurriculars don't relate to the field, it still looks better filling up the list of ten, then leaving half of it empty."

college,3e1bf4,kitpanda,2,Tue Jul 21 06:01:24 2015 UTC,"32 ACT is completely fine. A friend of mine got into stanford with that score, but he was also won something at the national level. If you can expand on your roles in leadership and community involvement from those executive positions or volunteer experience then I would gladly give you a more detailed opinion. For example, how often do you partake in said activities, for how long? Any quantitative numbers (did you raise x amount of dollars for March of Dimes?) Anything outside of school that you do?"
college,3e1bf4,cr42,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:10:30 2015 UTC,"Leadership - I helped raise ~$9000 for prom during my Junior year. I attended Boys' State which is a week long leadership/government camp that only a select group is allowed to attend. (I believe that it is considered a national honor. Not entirely sure though.) I have also been a section leader in my band for 3 years which means I'm at every practice and rehearsal trying to help my band excel. I assisted Stuco throughout the year to achieve the set goals. And the final leadership role that I'm in is varsity captain for academic bowl which takes up a lot of time with several practices/games a week in the Fall.  Volunteer work- I assist in the annual March of Dimes walk in my city. I have been doing so for 3 years. Unfortunately my town does not offer many volunteer opportunities. I tried to volunteer at the animal shelter and the soup kitchen but their spots were all filled. I know I'm lacking here but there isn't much I can do about it. I even considered making my own organization to help save some of the local wildlife (turtles) that are being run over constantly here and attempt to safely relocate them but I had no means of getting it off the ground.   Other- I take several scholastic tests at contests throughout the Winter and Spring. This year alone I placed: 1st in Trig, 2nd in Chemistry, 2nd in Accounting, 2nd in Business math, and 3rd in U.S History. At the state level I placed 11th in Trig, 13th in Chemistry, 4th in Accounting, 6th in Business Math, 14th in U.S History, and 3rd on the Scholar Test ( if you qualified for more than 3-4 subjects you could take a generalized test that covered multiple subjects.) I also placed 1st in my school's stock market competition and placed 2nd in the region for it as well. I also attended a team based finance challenge that our team did fairly well in. Besides that, I'm sure I missed a few things, I practice on my instrument 1-4 hours a day, compose music, study different subjects, read, cook, work, attend weekly therapy sessions, and I go to the gym about 4 times a week. To really top that off I try to be a teenager for at least a few hours a day. Aka I game as often as I can :)"
college,3e1bf4,agent_peggy_carter,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:53:42 2015 UTC,"You sound like you have the academic involvement just like everyone else applying to these schools, however they want to see that you are aware of your community and are getting involved with something that you are interested in outside of the classroom. The March of the Dimes sounds great, but what other things do you do when you're not doing that? Do you play a sport? How do you spend your weekends, Any hobbies or interest that you excel at? Have you won any honors like being named a State Scholar? You mention you composed music, have you been published or have had your piece played in public? Also you mentioned you had a job, what kind of job was it? Were you working just to make some extra change, or were you working with a company relevant to your desired field of study? My friend interned at a local start up prior to being admitted to MIT during her senior year, and the feedback she received from her interviewer (I recommend you set up an interview as well, these local graduates can help put in a good word for you and it'll come in handy if they have to decide between you and another person). You need to have something tangible that will separate you from the applicant pool.  There are a few other factors that may come into deciding your admissions depending on the applicant pool. Some that come directly into mind is your race, ethnicity, gender, family relation to the school, geographic location, first to attend college in family. Obviously these are uncontrollable but depending on how diverse the applicant pool is and how you compare to those other students fitting your same criteria, the better your chances are of getting admitted."
college,3e1bf4,kevinuh123,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:35:45 2015 UTC,"32 ACT is completely fine   I would actually agree with /u/fuzzwuzz123 that OP should try and get this score up, if possible.   In retrospect, I should have seriously studied and retaken the ACT to try for higher than a 32, because it is just high enough that people will tell you ""oh, its a great score, you're set!"" but just low enough that someone at one of these top schools might raise an eyebrow at it.   You're right that the most important things, though, are their activities. At the end of the day, a good ACT won't get anyone into a school of that caliber, but it's all about not giving them a reason to ask too many prying questions. A solid 34, or even a 33, on the ACT will help do that."
college,3e1bf4,mp10347,2,Tue Jul 21 08:11:07 2015 UTC,"A lot of the college admissions process is chance. So even if you have scores and grades that fit with a typically admitted student (or even if you don't) the outcome can still go either way. My main piece of advice is to also apply to other schools where the outcome is more in your favor and that you can afford whether or not you get scholarship or financial aid money (depending on your family's finances this could be an in state public university or your local community college (you can later transfer to another school once you have your 2 year degree)) and that you want to go to. Even though I like the outcome of my own college admissions process (I start college in the fall) I made the mistake of applying to safety schools that I didn't really like that much, had things not turned out the way they did I wouldn't have been very happy."
college,3e1bf4,zhaosi,2,Tue Jul 21 07:33:00 2015 UTC,"Hey :) Just got accepted into MIT and I'll be attending this fall. Almost everyone that applies to MIT has the scores and extracurriculars to be accepted (your scores are excellent but there is room for improvement). This is why your personal qualities are extremely important. As /u/fuzzwuzz123 already mentioned, you must make yourself stand out. This is crucial when you write your essays, and when you attend the interview. Ask yourself: 'What can I contribute to the campus and my classmates.' You need to self-evaluate."
college,3dzxpw,bigfootplays,2,Mon Jul 20 21:59:43 2015 UTC,I personally used cappex.com and U.S. News and World Report has some pretty good resources. I also used Zinch before they merged with Chegg so I can't really weigh in on what the new website is like. But Chegg is the bomb with homework help if you get a subscription (especially is you go to an engineering school). If you have any other questions about the college search process shoot me a PM. I went through it last year so it's relatively fresh in my head.

Until you can be more confident that there is a career behind that particular diploma, you might not want to invest more money/effort into it.    You don't have to leap all the way to CompSci to find stronger career options.    Look at MIS (Management Info Systems) or generic IS/IT programs.    Nothing has as strong a career path as CompSci (except maybe Petroleum Engineering) right now, but there are plenty of valid options within the ""lesser"" technology degrees.

college,3dz5aw,throwawaywhambam,3,Mon Jul 20 18:37:25 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I'm in the exact same boat. I started at a 4 year school my first year, did well in 2 courses and dropped/failed the rest due to depression/anxiety. I transferred to the community college in town and since then have dropped nearly every class I've signed up for, because of the same reason along with indecisiveness. I've changed my mind on what I want to major in several times.  The biggest thing I've realized is that it's completely okay to take time off of school in order to get your health in check, especially when it's affecting school performance. If you decide to get professional treatment, most schools will allow a retroactive withdrawal for the classes you haven't done well in due to health. Even if they don't allow it, all you can do is your best from there on out to try and make up for it. But honestly, when it's all said and done, even if you have Ws and Fs at first and then see consistent improvement from then on, that looks good.  As far as indecisiveness, that one is hard. Take electives in courses you think you may be interested in. Job shadow. Take online aptitude/career quizzes. And keep in mind that a lot of times, people end up in a career that doesn't directly align with their major. So don't stress it TOO much, as long as you're in the ball park of something you enjoy."
college,3dz5aw,mindaq,2,Mon Jul 20 21:48:18 2015 UTC,"Keep focusing on gen ed requirements. Make it a priority to retake the classes you have W's in and then classes that sound interesting (if they can double as gen ed requirements, great!). Your transcript is definitely not ""fucked"" since you have A's in all of the other classes you've taken.  Make use of the tutoring center your college most likely has. They can help you ""get in the groove"" and help you with homework studying, writing, test taking skills, and anything else you need. Also, I recommend checking out the counselling center as well- your tuition pays for it, and it's confidential. If you call them now, they may be able to see you before your classes begin or at least set you up with an appointment the first week of the semester."

college,3dzoie,rosem123,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:30:56 2015 UTC,Liberal arts.   Upper level classes do not transfer to a 4 year school so you're better off getting all of your gen eds out of the way and figuring out what area of student you will want to be in when you transfer.

I've had a Jansport backpack since junior year of high school and I am currently a sophomore in college, and it hasn't had a problem. Other crappy backpacks I used to buy died after about a year.

Also, a really sturdy backpack. If you splurge a little and get a good one, you can easily get away with using it for all 4 years without it tearing/breaking from all your heavy textbooks.

I've never had a problem and it still feels good since I bought it in 2012. They're ~$10 though.   For pens, get a box of those G2 Pilots.   Quick edit: If you're doing a mechanical pencil route, make sure you get decent lead. Don't cheap out and buy a dollar store box; they will break nonstop. Also, I would not advise you to get a box of those ballpoint pens (throwaway-style). I'm sure you know well enough that the ink does not come out consistently when writing and it'll make your notes look terrible. Rollerball pens are much better [than ballpoint], just be careful since the ink can smudge."

I fix my friends' bikes all the time and it's painfully obvious to see who cheaped out on a Walmart bike and who actually invested in a good brand. By the way, the latter bikes typically ride much more smoothly.   I also have one of these titanium sporks that I carry in my backpack. Students steal all sorts of things from the dining hall, which often means that the dining hall runs out of forks, knives, or spoons.

To receive financial aid, you must finish your degree is 1.5 times the hours.  So, if your particular engineering major is 120 hours, you must finish your degree is 180 hours. That's averaging 18 hours a semester with 5 years, or 15 hours a semester with 6 years.  See how many ATTEMPTED hours you have. Subtract that from 192 (M S&T requires 128, so 1.5 times that is 192) and those will be the number of hours still covered by FA."

college,3dzeu1,shut_the_duck_up,2,Mon Jul 20 20:59:46 2015 UTC,"You need to look at how many hours your major requires. That's the number you will multiply by 1.5. That s the number you need to fall at or under.  And I've seen a fair share of students with hours around 200. As long as you are making an attempt to graduate and have a reason (because 200 hours is around 6/7 year) I can't see it as all too horrible, but still not advisable.  Your major requires 128 hours, so you would need to complete your degree in 192 (attempted) hours. This is including AP and all classes failed. Anything over 192 would be coming out of your pocket."

I'd say see what you want to do and apply to schools early that have strong programs for that (like cornell/cmu for cs).

Internships for the following summer can start as early as September so be aware. Go to campus networking events and career fairs. If you haven't applied to more than a few, you're not doing it right."
college,3dx4l0,kitpanda,2,Mon Jul 20 07:06:20 2015 UTC,"I have a degree in finance and completed two summer internships while I was in college a few years ago.  The vast majority of college student that get internships also started with part-time jobs on their resume, and sometimes no work experience at all.  It's perfectly normal to not have office experience yet.    There are lots and lots of finance internships out there, and recruiting for those internships typically starts in September or October.  Does your university have career fairs?  You should absolutely attend those and talk to company recruiters about the summer internships they have available.  You'll need to wear a suit and bring with you a nice padfolio that has a pen and 30+ copies of your resume.  Many companies will talk to students at career fairs, take their resumes, and then schedule interviews with students that really impressed.  You should also attend info sessions that companies may host on campus.   You can work with your campus career services offer to prepare your resume and possibly complete a mock interview so you'll be prepared.    You should also apply online for internships.  I recommend applying to internships with the Big 4, Fortune 500 companies with large offices in your state, and any other companies that recruit at your school and are offering finance-related internships.  Internships are listed online like any other job on the career/ jobs section of a company's website.   Don't worry about the transition to an office environment, because you'll have a manager who helps you learn how to do your job and understand the company policies.    You should worry about getting interviews and then job offers.  Finance is a very popular major, and even though there are lots of finance-related internships, there will be stiff competition for those jobs.  You can't apply for a handful of internships and hope to get called for an interview, because there are probably dozens if not hundreds of applicants per job posting.  I recommend applying to several internships a week starting in September, and trying to get a few mock interviews in before you ever get a real interview."

This job has a lot to do with the jobs and internships I had as an undergrad. I just kept applying and kept interviewing until something happened. Took a year.

college,3dygaq,genekellypunk,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:43:11 2015 UTC,"First things first, tell your mom that professors are way too busy to give two shits about their students one way or another.   As regards subjectivity in grading, it's a thing in all subjects. Your average college exam or piece of coursework isn't the SAT: you don't get full marks just for knowing the right answer. You need to show your work, adhere to sometimes strange guidelines, show up to class ,etc etc.  I recall, for instance, getting a really bad grade on a math midterm once because the professor felt I wasn't explaining my thinking enough (it's a fucking integral, bro - do you want me to draw you a picture every time I take one or something?). Yes, students tend to struggle more with fixing their grades in the humanities because younger students don't know what they don't know (explaining your point well and structuring your arguments is harder than it looks), but in general, if you are unhappy with your grade, go to office hours and ask for clarification (like, not in an aggressive manner, duh), and most professors will be only too happy to go through your weaknesses with you. It's part of their job, after all.   I would take a class in History or Philosophy before I decide whether I want to major in either, though."
college,3dygaq,riggorous,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:08:20 2015 UTC,I'm planning on a philosophy minor. Philosophy can be subjective and instructors can take off points for disagreeing with you- but for the most part if you make a good argument you'll get a lot of points. I've been frustrated with some instructors and their grading but I've still walked away with an A in every philosophy class I've taken so far.   History grading could be subjective too though. Don't think its going to be graded objectively cause history is just memorizing facts (Which is the case for tests). Papers can be graded subjectively in history courses too.   Philosophy will help with law school. You should go for it. Don't worry about the subjectivity. Present good arguments and you will get good grades. I remember for one of my philosophy papers we had to choose what we would do in a certain scenario. One of the scenarios was more popular and later the teacher said he too would choose that option. I decided to write about the less popular option cause I thought it would be fun. Teacher said he disagreed but liked my paper because I presented strong arguments and still gave me an A.
college,3dygaq,chevybow,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:37:25 2015 UTC,"I'm not a philosophy major, but I have taken a number of humanities classes. Your grade for a class is dependent on the papers you write, and possibly for smaller assignments or tests in lower level classes. You have to really develop every argument you make (much more so than what you had to do in high school) and use examples and quotes from the book(s) the paper is based on, and make sure to follow every guideline the professor gives. There is the occasional professor who grades on whether or not they agree with your view, but the vast majority won't, and if you check ratemyprofessor and talk with older students you'll be warned ahead of time of which professors do that."
college,3dygaq,asimplekitten,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:55:49 2015 UTC,"I am not a philosophy major.  Yes, it is subjective. You may find yourself getting an 80 when you REALLY feel it was 90+ material.  No teacher is going to fail you ""because they don't like you"" though. They'd be putting their job on the line to do that.  The best thing you can do to protect yourself is ask for grading criteria/rubrics for everything in advance, and refute any grade by asking for specifics on where points were lost.  Keep a paper trail in case you need to bring it up with a department head at some point.  Of course my everything you write will be ""A"" level work.  Expect fair grades, not necessarily good ones.  Don't pick a fight over 3 points; pick your battles. But if you think you deserved 10+ points you absolutely should take steps to have it either explained or corrected. You can't learn if you don't know what you did wrong."

So god forbid I want to take something interesting beyond the bare minimum, e.g. linguistics, environmental science, a second history course, etc. That's when I'm scared that shit's really going to go down."

You can just tell them that you're taking all math/physical science courses, if they don't understand that you need a history course in order to graduate. If you are living at home, I don't know how to help.  (Side note: it's very odd that your Chinese parents are against you taking a Chinese history course. If my uni had an Ethiopian history course and my parents knew about it, they'd probably make me take that class, haha.)"

Now that they're in America and so much that they hear about China nowadays contradicts what they've been taught, it all seems so muddled and confusing and controversial, with power struggles and politics that are impossible to understand. They prefer everything to be logical and precise and understandable. That's probably why they're both computer programmers, haha."

However, it's your education and time, so you get to call the shots. The only way to get them off your back is to either lie about your schedule, deflect their questions, or ignore them.

One thing you can do is attempt is the 21 course load. You would learn more about how you can handle having that many classes. This is obviously more risky, but considering there are drop deadlines if you are not up for the workload you should be fine. Unless your school charges you for every individual unit, it is really nice to get classes like that out of the way.  You can also play it safe and save the class for a different quarter/ semester. You will eventually have to take it regardless because of history requirements."

college,3dwqf9,OffTheEdge23,6,Mon Jul 20 04:14:48 2015 UTC,"The biggest thing to remember is that your professors, and the university as a whole, want you to succeed and have resources available to offer you in order to help you do so. It's your job to ask for those resources, though, and you can't wait until the last minute to run to the prof's office in a panic and beg for an extension or a grade change. If you're struggling to grasp a concept from the lecture or the readings, or if you bomb the first test/assignment, talk to the professor after class and set up a meeting during his or her office hours to discuss the issue. You can also set up a meeting to talk more in depth with the professor about a point in the lecture or the reading that you found interesting and want to know more about. It's worth taking the time to introduce yourself outside of class and develop a one-on-one relationship with your professors; at some point, especially if graduate school is in your future, you will need a letter of recommendation and someone will need to be able to vouch for you academically. Professors are  professional nerds - they LOVE it when people show interest in their field. Even if you're not asking them about their personal favorite topic, they're usually more than willing to offer guidance on where to find more information on something that interests you within their field.   Some departments have dedicated tutors, and the prof may be able to give you contact information for one of these people, or direct you to an on-campus tutoring center. If you find that your struggles are not academic in nature, there is also likely an on-campus counseling center that offers free or low-cost counseling services to students.   At the beginning of the semester, you're going to receive a course syllabus. Unlike the syllabi you received in high school, this will be a multiple-page document that includes the goals of the course, details about the major assignments, and a (usually tentative) course schedule that tells you what you are expected to have read or completed for each class meeting. Most professors will expect you to read and refer to the syllabus; they won't write the homework assignment on the board or verbally tell it to you, and in fact may not even mention an assignment until they're asking you to turn it in. Also, remember how in high school ""read pages XX-XX"" basically translated to ""no homework tonight""? Not so in college. Reading is 90% of your homework, and the other 10% is writing papers about what you've read. Read the syllabus and if you have questions, ask the professor."

Ideally, I'd like to transfer to a smaller school (VCU is 32k+), but it's too much of a hassle and I've already made friends.  The best part for me is the Peppas, the pep band.  I don't know much about the graduate program and how the classes are.  I do know it's extremely competitive.  Don't feel discouraged by my opinion.

Your social life is what you make of it, and your social life has the potential to be better than you ever thought it could be.  source: I thought I had a good social life in high school, then I went to college."

If you can find a situation where all three are achieved, you will find it very easy to make friends.   Friendships is a complicate topic. This will break it down for you."

Ask them where they're from, their intended major, if they like where they're from (if it's different than where you're from), talk about the University a little, maybe try to ask about what kind of hobbies or extra curricular they enjoy, and then see if there's any similar information there for you to relate to.   Everyone's nervous during orientation so don't be shy to talk to people :) good luck!"
