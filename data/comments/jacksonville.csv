jacksonville,3e439c,roadslaya,2,Tue Jul 21 20:18:00 2015 UTC,"From Coj.net  HOW DO I DISCARD BUILDING MATERIALS OR CONSTRUCTION DEBRIS? For small home projects performed by the homeowner, residents can discard up to one cubic yard (two full construction wheelbarrows) of building materials weekly on household garbage collection day. Materials must not exceed 5 feet in length or width or weigh more than 40 pounds. If possible, containerize all materials and place them separately from the household garbage for verification of quantities. Small bulky items ( i.e., sofa, furniture, toilet and certain construction debris, etc.)  will be tagged and scheduled for collection the following business day. If you will be generating quantities more than listed above, you will need to hire a rubbish removal company to provide a construction debris container. Any debris from work performed by a contractor must be removed by the contractor. As with all household garbage, waste should be placed at the curb no later than 6:00 a.m. on collection day. Waste should not be placed at the curb before 5:00 p.m. the day prior to scheduled collection and all empty containers must be removed from the curb no later than 6:00 a.m. the day after scheduled collection.  PLEASE NOTE:  Carpet, padding, and fencing materials are not considered construction debris and is to be set out curbside with normal household garbage subject to weight and size restrictions or you may call 630-city (2489) to schedule bulk item(s) collection."

I recommend 3/5 local college professors be contracted to review the books and state their opinions. It should take about 15 minutes.

The beach is pretty packed down where you drive so don't worry about getting stuck. If you are 2 wheel drive and really worried just stick to the main paths near the dunes and you'll be fine.  Other than that you've got hanna park. Its a long stretch of beach south of the naval base; you cant drive on that one.   The public beaches just south of hannah park are really nice, most public entrances have showers and boardwalks to the beach. if you get there around 8am parking isnt too bad at the more private areas. Stay north of 6th street though everything south of that is just full of crazy people, drunks, and tourists.   Both hannah and hugenot have daily/extended state park passes probably 5-10$, they don't allow alcohol and they do patrol.

I not comfortable even typing that fucking word out, but it demonstrates the point more effectively than any other description I can think of.  To give it a more illustrious meaning is to whitewash history.  Here's what the modern use of the flag represents  In Georgia, the Confederate battle flag was reintroduced as an element of the state flag in 1956, just two years after the Supreme Court decision Brown v. Board of Education. It was considered by many to be a protest against school desegregation. It was also raised at the University of Mississippi (Ole Miss) during protests against integration of schools.    Did you know that (formerly named) Forrest High School was named after NBF as a fuck you to desegregation from the United Daughters of the Confederacy.   Bigotry can be found nearly everywhere, and in the South it likes to hide behind the 'rich and cultured history' propaganda.  In summary, I'm sorry your cousin and his wife had to witness a sampling from the least educated and most arrogant of the people here, willing to 'protest' over a flag but not over things which actually matter in their daily lives.  Most of us are (probably) not bigoted assholes. Disclaimer: other types of assholes are not covered under this warranty.  Cheers."

Lincoln was as openly racist as any President in U.S. history.  Go read his words.  Also his Emancipation Proclamation did not free a single slave.  The slaves in the North were not freed (yes, there were hundreds of thousands of slaves in the North), and Lincoln had no authority over the Confederate States.

jacksonville,3dsw7n,rohicks,22,Sun Jul 19 07:15:36 2015 UTC,"I believe the Vice President of the Confederate States of America is a good source of what the Confederacy (and by extension, its flags) stood for:     The prevailing ideas entertained by... most of the leading statesmen at the time of the formation of the [U.S.] Constitution was that the enslavement of the African was in violation of the laws of nature; that it was wrong in principle, socially, morally, and politically. It was an evil they knew not well how to deal with.... Our new government [The Confederacy] is founded upon exactly the opposite idea; its foundations are laid, its cornerstone rests, upon the great truth that the negro is not equal to the white man; that slavery subordination to the superior race is his natural and normal condition. This, our new government, is the first, in the history of the world, based upon this great physical, philosophical, and moral truth.   -Alexander H. Stevens, Vice President of the Confederate States of America     It's a symbol of open rebellion against the United States, with its main purpose being the preservation of human ownership (read the various states' Articles of Secession, every single one of them officially stated slavery as the primary reason for secession. Some of them said ""states' rights"", then quickly clarified they seceded over states' rights... to own slaves).   The flag fell into disuse for 60 years until the KKK started using it. State and local governments started using it in the 1950s as a direct response and show of solidarity against the Civil Rights movement.   Whatever positive thing you think it meant, if it ever meant anything positive, is now gone. If it ever was NOT a symbol of hatred and bigotry and ignorance, it now is to most people, whether you like it or not.

jacksonville,3dsw7n,trench_welfare,9,Sun Jul 19 11:45:44 2015 UTC,"Also (and I think this is even more important) - the meaning of symbols change over time. And since the 1950s, the only experience that people of color have had with the confederate flag is one associated with racism. And yes, there are people from the south that associate the flag with ""being a rebel"" and not the subjugation of non-white people, but they are far less in number than the people who are oppressed by it.   And just for the record, all of this ""banning of the flag"" has been done by entities other than the government. Amazon, Walmart, etc... Are simply responding to market forces. I.e.The invisible hand of the free market. Isn't that what the conservatives wanted?"
jacksonville,3dsw7n,rohicks,2,Sun Jul 19 11:39:33 2015 UTC,"Bingo on meanings changing. I want to fly this flag myself, due to what it means now, which is more ""rebel"" than anything else at this point. I don't get  how this is different from 4Chan-borne anonymous (nigger this, faggot that, kill yourself, tits or GTFO), regardless of where I stand on either. We have to give everyone the same freedoms we want to enjoy ourselves, and we have no right to tell them what they can and cannot believe something stands for.  Keep it off if government buildings, sure. That's legit. Wherever that 5-flag display was is interesting gray area, though - it show the history of the region, good or bad, and to deny that is ""revisionist history"", a buzzword being tossed around on one side, that I see applying to both sides of this flag business."

Early as in 9 or 10pm. Sundays? Forget about it, they usually are closed or open late and close even earlier at 6pm like the mall. There are two Tigerdirect stores in town, one located in Regency and one in the St. Johns Towncenter. THIS place can facilitate all your computer/technology purchases. For internet there are only TWO real choices in providing fast internet speeds. Comcast Xfinity or AT&T U-Verse. If you're into tech then I will spare you the pro's and con's of each. Prices are comparable to each other through out town. You will need a primary mode of transport like a motor bike or car. Public transit is a joke and with the standard afternoon showers around 2pm you don't want to be standing at a bus stop. Bus stops here in Jacksonville for the most part dont have benches let alone a covered waiting area. On the bright side there are many terrific Uber drivers in town. Racism can be bad at times, it is the South. Not as blatant as other cities in the south but it's there. It has definitely gotten better since I moved here 15 years ago.

jacksonville,3dnqu0,No1sadvocate,2,Fri Jul 17 22:38:46 2015 UTC,Gateway on the west side is outdoors. The day shooter rate is approx $20. I heard the range officers can be dicks to day shooters but as long as you follow the range rules you should have no issue. They take safety seriously. The first time there you will have to watch a safety video. But besides that I love the range and have had a membership for 2 years.

I also live there and it's nice and peaceful but still close to everything. Remember though that this city exists on the highways. If you are in Mandarin and leave after 7am, it will take you a while to get downtown!"
jacksonville,3dnb5g,dumbdiety,4,Fri Jul 17 21:07:56 2015 UTC,"For your age and where you'll be working, I'd look at Riverside first and foremost. It's the 'young', 'hipster' ish part of town, and you should definitely be able to find things in your budget there. There are a lot of great bars and restaurants around there.  If you don't mind a drive, I'd personally recommend Mandarin. You could find a nice HOUSE to rent in that price range, 3/2 with a garage. It's more generic suburbs, but it's NICE, safe, generic suburbs. It's where I live and I love it. Everything is close enough for me.   That said, I bet most people will recommend Riverside for you.  The places to avoid are Arlington, Northside, and Northwest Jax, really. Orange Park kind of sucks but not in quite the same way (those 3 areas have the most crime, gangs, and violent crime. Almost every shooting in Jax. is in NW Jax or Arlington.)"

He is a school board member, reporting on, even in an op-ed sytle, is absolutely fair and absolutely acceptable.  Guerrieri's abrasive style is not my own preferred way to approaching it, but he is generally on point with the subjects at hand.

jacksonville,3dfvzq,icosikaitrigon,2,Fri Jul 17 01:32:44 2015 UTC,"I work across the street from 220. This is a small urban core neighborhood called Brooklyn. It has a lot of things ""in the works"" right now and soon it will be a hoppin' place but right now, it's a lot of construction. All the apt buildings, most of the shops and restaurants, and even the Y across the street are under construction.  Pros: 1) Fresh Market and Corner Bakery are open. Soon a magical place called Burrito Gallery will open (Sept., I'm told), and then I will never have to leave the Brooklyn area agaaaiiiiiin!! Ahem. 2) Proximity to Riverside. Until Brooklyn is finished powering up to its final neighborhood form, Riverside/5 Points are your best bet for things to do. Hope you like antiquing or frolf during the day and drinking/Asian street fare at night. 3) You're right next door to Riverside Arts Market (RAM) and I'm jealous. Just go under the highway bridge (not as sketch as it sounds) during the day any Saturday.  Cons: Kind of said already, Brooklyn just isn't done yet. It's the bridge between downtown and Riverside, and for a while it's been a niche of corporate campuses. Now developers have gotten ahold of it and want to do something awesome, which I support, but you're catching them in the middle of the process.  Where are you going to be working? A short commute to the urban core neighborhoods is what makes this location gold."

jacksonville,3dcf9o,untouchedURL,2,Wed Jul 15 04:30:00 2015 UTC,Will these be real magnet schools or the bullshit lottery system again?
jacksonville,3dcf9o,youarecaught,2,Wed Jul 15 14:40:16 2015 UTC,"The more magnet options exist the less necessary a lottery becomes. I was raised in an area with lots of magnet programs and there was no lottery, just grade requirements."
jacksonville,3dcf9o,aristander,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:03:52 2015 UTC,"Previous magnet programs in Jacksonville had nothing to do with skills, knowledge or interest (there were a very few exceptions). Parents applied for up to 3 magnet programs for their children and the children were assigned by a lottery system (exceptions were made for siblings). This resulted in students in ""gifted intelligences"" classes who were reading 2 grade levels below their current assigned grade.    The DCPS magnet program was a voluntary scheme designed to comply with federally mandated desegregation. It had (and possibly still has) nothing to do with actually assigning students to programs where they can excel but rather to where they can improve the racial mix of schools."
jacksonville,3dcf9o,youarecaught,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:03:42 2015 UTC,Well that doesn't seem very productive on the whole.
jacksonville,3dcf9o,aristander,2,Wed Jul 15 17:07:38 2015 UTC,"Exactly. But it did provide racial integration and that is what all it was designed to do.   After hearing Vitti's comments on First Coast connect and what I read here it sounds to me like the purpose of this round of ""magnet"" schools will be to improve failing schools. So instead of improving the instruction and level of existing students they will just import higher performing students to bump the scores up a bit."

Sidecar’s vibe is super chill; long wooden tables make it a perfect happy hour or weekend spot with your friends. And the bartenders are really nice. Kurt’s my fave.
jacksonville,3d98rg,digitaldisease,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:11:06 2015 UTC,"Blind rabbit (great old fashioned, pretty good burgers)  Black sheep (sunset on the roof top while noshing poutine is pretty awesome)  If I can live in the long, long, long ago then also milk bar and Einsteins. Probably 2 of the best venues in the history of the city."
jacksonville,3d98rg,traveltopher,1 point,Wed Jul 15 02:08:55 2015 UTC,"Agree - Dos Gatos and Sidecar are great. Rooftop bar at Black Sheep in 5 Points and Volstead downtown are also worth checking out - great cocktails. The Parlour in San Marco is a speakeasy with great jazz on the weekends.   For beer - besides the ones mentioned - for a very laid back vibe, check out Ale Wife in 5 Points and Silver Cow in King St Corridor"
jacksonville,3d98rg,Demiansmark,1 point,Thu Jul 16 03:18:26 2015 UTC,"Burro Bar downtown has $3 craft beers from 4-7pm and is a good place to 'slum it' after work. Burrito Gallery is decent for after work drinks as well. Used to frequent Dos but it's a little dingy and too many of their drafts seem 'off' in an uncleaned lines sort of way. I like the selection and atmosphere at BREW Five Points but note that I'm an investor there so I'm biased, but it's still cool. Ale Wife across the street is solid as well."
jacksonville,3d9lel,Incodite,2,Tue Jul 14 15:57:24 2015 UTC,Crystal Springs park has a good trail and open area.  Leashes are required but honestly once I'm about 20 feet into the trail I take the leash off since its a pretty linear path and no one is around.

jacksonville,3d9lel,IamGrimReefer,2,Tue Jul 14 19:56:50 2015 UTC,"I don't necessarily need a dog park, just someplace where there are trails. I've been taking my dog to west side regional for awhile now and she loves it just wana switch it up because I've been there too much now. I will check out dogwood though thanks."
jacksonville,3d9lel,IamGrimReefer,2,Tue Jul 14 20:04:25 2015 UTC,"dogwood is pretty pricey, so unless you're going to get a membership i wouldn't really recommend it.  they only allow non-members on the weekends and the quality of dog owner drops considerably.  as a member i only go on weekdays or after hours on weekends to avoid the crappy owners."
jacksonville,3d9lel,Gorthax,2,Tue Jul 14 21:50:06 2015 UTC,"Maybe a little harsh?   Is it really that bad?   I would like to visit and evaluate a membership, but the weekend is when I would be able to enjoy it.  If a weekend is a no win situation, that kinda sucks..."
jacksonville,3d9lel,therobbo91,2,Wed Jul 15 00:19:19 2015 UTC,"If you come towards the end of the day, when the office is about to close, you might miss some of the craziness. Once you're in the park you can stay as long as you want. Once I got a membership I started going around 8 am or 6-7 pm on weekends and it wasn't that bad."
jacksonville,3d9lel,IamGrimReefer,1 point,Wed Jul 15 00:27:17 2015 UTC,"i first went on a weekday and said i was considering a membership and wanted to check out the park.  they let me in and i paid the daily rate.  after like an hour i was back in the office asking for a membership.  they even applied the fee to my membership cost.  this was years ago and they have since changed ownership, but it's worth a shot.  members get a thingy for the gate and can come and go when the office isn't open.  the office is open from like 2-5 on weekdays and like 10-5 or something on weekends.  so just use your key and avoid those hours on the weekends.  i think the lights stay on till 9 or 10.    but yeah, honestly the weekends suck.  during the week everyone is pretty chill and you get to know one another.  if you get into a routine and go at the same time you'll probably make some new friends.  on the weekends it's like every man for himself.  the dogs are going crazy because they haven't been out of the house in 2 weeks and the owners are on phone the whole time, annoyed that they're at a dog park.  they usually clear out around dinner time though, 5-6, so just come at like 7 and it's alright."
jacksonville,3d9lel,therobbo91,2,Wed Jul 15 01:52:18 2015 UTC,"It's the only one I'll go to. Yeah it's expensive but it's the only park where I haven't run into (many) bad owners. If someone's dog starts humping mine, the owner actually comes over and does something about it."

jacksonville,3d98m5,gators10,2,Tue Jul 14 14:21:16 2015 UTC,Depending on your budget I would also check out Kendall Lake/Lantern Square apartments. I've lived out here going on my second year and have no problems with anything. It's easily accessible to all parts of the city being right next to the Southside connector.  The apartment is very spacious something like 850 square feet that is really spread out. Comes with a washer and dryer in unit as well as a nightly trash service during the week. Prior to renewing our lease we looked around and didn't find anything that we felt was worth the amount of money and offered everything thing they do.
jacksonville,3d98m5,Crazymixedkid,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:40:19 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the response. Looks nice, I just emailed to get some current rates/availability. Would you say the area is safe? I read somewhere that the Arlington area can get a little sketchy."
jacksonville,3d98m5,Crazymixedkid,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:04:04 2015 UTC,"This part of Arlington isn't too bad. I freely walk to and from my apartment and car with no problem since I work midnight shift. They have a security guard that rides through every once in a while. Plus we have a JSO officer on each side of the complex.   I go to the Walmart that's literally walking distance with no problems in the middle of the night. Most of the problems in Arlington come from the apartments that are drug-ridden. This isn't one of those.   I know all of my neighbors, and we speak all the time. It's also very quiet out here(except for the occasional sirens and motorcycles passing by on the Southside connector.) But you can literally get to anywhere in the city in a decent amount of time from here. It takes about 20 minutes to get to the airport, and about 20 minutes to get to the Avenues mall. Which are on opposite side of the city. I work downtown and that takes me about 10 to get there at 5 pm everyday."

jacksonville,3d5kty,PotRoastPotato,4,Mon Jul 13 18:24:41 2015 UTC,I agree. A person should get free parking if they present a receipt from the restaurant with a date/time stamp within the last hour and if they have only been parked for a reasonable amount of time. It would take some coordination by the restaurant and parking staff but is workable.
jacksonville,3d5kty,youarecaught,7,Mon Jul 13 18:31:44 2015 UTC,I have. It's not worth going at all. So many other options on the beach that are actually worth checking out. The only thing this place has going for it is the numerous tvs to watch different sports which can be found elsewhere around jax.
jacksonville,3d5kty,rohicks,2,Mon Jul 13 19:49:03 2015 UTC,"I've never had a bad experience. It's not fine dining, but if you're looking for a place with the biggest/most screens to watch a game or that's comparable to Gators Dockside / Dicks wings food it's the place to go."
jacksonville,3d5kty,JaxJaguar,2,Mon Jul 13 20:18:20 2015 UTC,"It's a place for wings, beer and sports. Period. It's otherwise honestly a pretty terrible restaurant (it used to be one of the best sports bars around when Tony Boselli owned it long ago, it's been crappy ever since). Still, it's a great place if all you want to do is watch a game over a pitcher of beer. I think the wings are OK and the boneless wings are great. I wouldn't get anything else there."

The manager said he'd comp the parking on their bill, and that he disagreed with the policy but the owner can't do anything about it, but the person was so irrationally upset over $5 for parking that he/she ranted on the cesspool of negativity that is yelp as if it would have any impact.  Pretty much all parking lots at the beach are either private and company/shopping center owned or they're public and charge you to park there.  If you want Sneakers without paying for parking even though it's comped then go to the one near Regency."
jacksonville,3d5kty,swampdebutante,2,Tue Jul 14 11:15:53 2015 UTC,To be honest I would not be surprised if more beach businesses start doing/are doing this…
jacksonville,3d5kty,Jblood,2,Tue Jul 14 01:32:26 2015 UTC,World of beer/Blind Rabbit charges $5 to park on top of the building on weekends/nights too. They give you a credit on your bill if you show them the parking stub. The only inconvient part is needing to have a 5er.
jacksonville,3d5kty,swampdebutante,2,Mon Jul 13 19:43:04 2015 UTC,Good to know. I never carry cash anymore!
jacksonville,3d5kty,Blutroyale-_-,2,Mon Jul 13 21:01:55 2015 UTC,"Maybe it's just me, and i grew up in a much different area, and paying 5 dollars for parking and getting it credited back if you dine at the restaurant is pretty fair and extremely uncommon to find anywhere. Otherwise, if you don't want to pay for parking, then drive around and find some free space's."
jacksonville,3d5kty,thirsty904,1 point,Tue Jul 14 11:42:48 2015 UTC,"Depends on the lot. I would assume private could charge whatever they wanted.   Public lots do charge on weekends, like the one across from Lynchs on 1st street. I think its only a 5 dollar max for public lots.  If you live in local Jax Beach with a 32250 zip code, just have to show your ID and its free parking.  Beach access is still free parking though."

jacksonville,3cuuc0,youarecaught,1 point,Sat Jul 11 00:33:00 2015 UTC,Thanks. The zoo sounds like a winner. Someone else recommended going there on a cool day. The heat is something I'd not really considered as hot days are hard to come by over here!

jacksonville,3cuuc0,Owt_On_A_Limb,9,Sat Jul 11 12:19:15 2015 UTC,"For a one year old, certainly the beaches are pleasant. I recommend Hanna Park because (although it has a small entrance fee) you have access to bathrooms and in addition to the beach there is also a lake and other activities including a playground.  If we have a relatively cool day & she's feeling well, I highly recommend the zoo.   The Museum of Science and History is located downtown not far from the proton beam center and that's an interesting place to go. Possibly she's not quite old enough for that yet.  My friend swears by the Gymboree area at the Avenues Mall.  Will you be staying at Ronald McDonald house? The Museum of science and history is a reasonable walking distance for healthy adults from Ronald Mcdonald House."

We've temporary accommodation for the first week before getting something more permanent. If we are, we'll definitely check out the museum."
jacksonville,3cuuc0,LyraOfOxford,5,Sat Jul 11 05:12:20 2015 UTC,"I have very young kids and we like to take them to the beach in the evening.  The water is warm and the sun is very low.  The sun is brutal right now and very tiring so evening beach trips are the ticket.  I'm sure the saltwater and fresh air would be great for her.  The zoo is fantastic, they have put a lot of effort in providing a lot of natural shade so you can go on a hot day and stay out of the sun for the most part.  If you are up late enough for it to be dark there is a large fountain on the south bank from downtown that is a light show as well.  The Avenues mall is a good spot on a hot day, they even have a little train that rides through the mall.  St Johns Town Center has the same train outdoors and a really cool nature pond with fish, turtles and ducks etc.  There is a bookstore right there by the pond my children enjoy a lot as well."

jacksonville,3cuuc0,kapt_hook,2,Sat Jul 11 07:27:00 2015 UTC,"Right now I would say 6pm and that gives you a good 3 hours of beach time.  My favorite part of the beach is in Atlantic Beach on Beach Ave between 11th and 15th streets.  Drive to there and park where you can its a high end residential area but the beach end of the streets are access points that have showers.  There is a drop off and a shelf so when its at a lower tide there is usually a long tidal pool about a foot deep that gets super warm.  Coming from England, the water will feel like a hot tub anyway, I wouldn't sweat that. It's getting up to 86 F."

jacksonville,3cuuc0,Demiansmark,2,Sun Jul 12 05:02:41 2015 UTC,"I would suggest that you talk to the doctor down here before a trip to the beach, because if treatment leaves her with a compromised immune system she could be at risk of bacterial infection through a port or cut. You could definitely carry her along the beach but it might be best to keep her out of the water."
jacksonville,3cuuc0,Colomborican,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:28:25 2015 UTC,"Good point. She has a portacath, which cannot get wet while there's a gripper needle in it, so we knew she couldn't go swimming. Will check about her immune system and things we should avoid."

If you're over 50 you should remember Hecksher drive as a mosquito-infested unruly mudding road rather than where the affluent old folks drive too slow to houses that cost too much.  If you're in your 40s then you should experience some surrealism that the big football stadium isn't still called the gatorbowl and that the regency mall is so low-rent anymore.  If you're in your 30s then you might marvel at how the other parts of town that used to be mosquito swamp are now subdivision.

jacksonville,3coxks,nascentia,9,Thu Jul 9 16:30:07 2015 UTC,No matter where on the political spectrum you fall you have to admit that Florida's 5th Congressional District is a classic case of gerrymandering.
jacksonville,3coxks,youarecaught,3,Thu Jul 9 17:28:25 2015 UTC,"Everyone says that it favors the Democrats, but it's actually the Republicans who like it that way because it makes the surrounding districts safer."
jacksonville,3coxks,Logicalas,3,Thu Jul 9 19:59:30 2015 UTC,"From the Wikipedia article (emphasis mine):   On July 11, 2014, Florida Circuit Court Judge Terry Lewis ruled that this district, along with the neighboring District 10, had been drawn to favor Republicans. On August 1, Judge Lewis gave Florida's state legislature an Aug. 15 deadline to submit new congressional maps for those two districts.  5th District Representative Corrine Brown issued a statement blasting Lewis's decision on the district map as ""seriously flawed,"" and Congressional Black Caucus Chairwoman Marcia Fudge sent a sharply worded letter to Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee Chairman Steve Israel complaining about the party’s support for the lawsuit challenging Florida's district maps.  Brown said that ""we will go all the way to the United States Supreme Court, dealing with making sure that African Americans are not disenfranchised.""   So it's not Democrats that the current setup favors - it's Republicans and Black lawmakers."
jacksonville,3coxks,yellowstone10,2,Fri Jul 10 03:16:18 2015 UTC,No doubt it dilutes Democrat votes in surrounding districts. Corrine Brown has been opposed to redrawing her district simply because it would dilute her support.

jacksonville,3coxks,ShawnLeary,5,Sat Jul 11 14:16:13 2015 UTC,"Political gerrymandering needs to be fixed around the country. I was listening to a podcast once about it and one of the people had a great idea how to solve it. They suggested a mathematical problem that is used to calculate the districts. You could draw them anyway you wanted, but the equation prevented you from making too make ""sides""  or turns in the shape of the district. The issue we have is that the people drawing the districts literally draw the map around individual streets they want to include or not include. Using a equation like this limits the amount or times they can do that attempting to make the districts as even as possible."

If i remember correctly (without checking wikipedia) it's the only place in the world with that kind of sand.     Edit:  The coastal landscape and beach at Big Talbot Island is unique within the state of Florida as result of the lava like hardpan sedimentary deposits. These rocky formations are habitat for mollusca, crab, oysters, and other tide pool creatures. The formations and sand on Blackrock Beach are much darker in contrast to the coquina formations at Washington Oaks State Gardens, and the limestone outcroppings at Blowing Rocks Preserve further south on A1A.

He claims he was just minding his own business walking to a building on airport property. Yeah right. He was standing on the side of the road protesting on airport property. He could have simply parked in the parking lot of the building he wanted to go to, but he didn't. He could have simply told the officers he was walking to the building, and they could have given him that opportunity, but he didn't. Instead he refused to say anything and not move. They explained to him that he needed to fill out paperwork if he wanted to protest on airport property. The jury saw through his charade and convicted him like they should have.   You can claim your free speech, all day long, but at some point refusing to say anything to the police will do more harm than good. For example. If he had simply told them he wanted to go to that building, they could have given him that opportunity, but he didn't."

But Comcast left our ticket open for a year with no fix.  I ended up asking to be switched to business class because I am in IT and do work from home. When business class was installed the connection dropped out as the tech was testing the install. Only THEN did Comcast fix the tap.

The regulations include a ban on capturing, keeping, possessing, transporting or exhibiting venomous reptiles or reptiles of concern (listed python species, Green Anaconda, Nile monitor and other reptiles designated by the commission as a conditional or prohibited species.) Persons who hold pre-July 1, 2010, permits for these species may legally possess the species for the remainder of the reptile's life. Traveling wildlife exhibitors who are licensed or registered under the United States Animal Welfare Act and licensed zoos are exempted.""  Just a no cost class III license is required."

jacksonville,3bpodf,Phuriousgeorge78,7,Wed Jul 1 03:45:59 2015 UTC,"A fishing license, like a state or national park entrance fee, pays for conservation efforts and draws additional federal excise money for the same purpose. In Florida, that means beach preservation, artificial reef construction, and programs to support many of the 30,000 lakes in the state. If that is important to you, consider anteing up the $50. If not, take the risk and hope you don't get caught. I don't know where the fine money would go, but its just as likely to pay for law enforcement as conservation."
jacksonville,3bpodf,you_know_how_I_know,2,Wed Jul 1 13:29:42 2015 UTC,"You won't likely get asked, but if it happens, it's around a $200 fine. You can fish from the pier without a license, though.

jacksonville,3blzut,Smugsy2099,4,Tue Jun 30 16:18:59 2015 UTC,"Lived in Baltimore briefly and I was pretty surprised how positive people were about their town, especially considering the reputation that it has in other parts of the country. People there seemed more supportive of grassroots endeavors or opportunities to interact with each other/their community. But that was just my personal experience, so I admit that it's not an iron-clad basis for an opinion. What other towns did you live in and what made them less 'positive?'  I'm starting to think ""positive"" isnt the right word. Maybe ""outgoing,"" or ""supportive"" are more accurate. Compared to other familiar US cities, I don't think our average citizen is as outgoing or supportive of people who try big endeavors. It seems like there's always more people shitting on ideas than creating or supporting them.  Hey, maybe that is true everywhere, but having lived here nearly my whole life... it's always felt oppressively homegrown to me."

Of course that's a generalization but I think if I can make a generalization about my experience with people from Jacksonville so far it's that they're much more laid back than people were in the northeast.   People sort of suck no matter where they come from, and maybe that's where that negativity comes from. And honestly, I think Florida's politicians are some of the worst around, so optimism might not be at its highest point. But I think in comparison to a lot of places, you're doing okay living here your whole life."

They need to chill out and stop being so angry about stuff.  If they are angry about what is going on in the city then take some ownership of your city and go out and do something about it yourself instead of waiting on the corrupt slow backwards thinking government to do something because they aren't.

jacksonville,3bgmgx,Asphyxiiat3d,9,Mon Jun 29 01:28:15 2015 UTC,"Hey there.  Maybe I'm about to sound a bit blunt, but many of the questions you have you should find out for yourself.  A quick google search can help you.    There are plenty of websites for apartment hunting, and there are plenty of places near UNF that are cheaper than $600/mo (but you may have to have roommates).    I'm assuming you'll be an out of state student, and unfortunately tuition will be much higher as a result.  I'd recommend FSCJ for your two-year Associate's degree because it's cheaper and when you graduate you'll be able to start at UNF without skipping a beat and by then you may be eligible for in-state tuition rates (again, look into it; you have to have lived in Florida for some number of years before being classified as 'in-state').  For everything else, the internet is your friend.  Recent posts in this subreddit can answer your last question about places to avoid, but everything else is readily available.  Just search for 'how to get food stamps', or search AutoTrader or local listings for a cheap car, jobs can be found on Craigslist, etc.  Good luck, and really consider FSCJ over UNF at least for your first two years.  The tuition is something like half that at UNF which is even more significant given that you'll likely be paying out of state tuition."
jacksonville,3bgmgx,Arighea,3,Mon Jun 29 01:47:07 2015 UTC,"I second the advice about FSCJ. Pay less for your AA, get established in state then transfer to UNF for your last two years.  Apply for food stamps through accessflorida."

It takes a year to be considered a resident.  See your advisor at FSCJ for more information.    can I become a resident by getting a drivers license?

Avondale is really nice, not quite as artsy in my opinion. but really nice and really relaxed.  Murray Hill seems to be the new spot. A lot of new businesses are opening up there and it's really charming. Also, don't count out Springfield. A lot of hate for Springfield in the city and some on this sub, but I've been living here for 2 years. It definitely needs love, but there is a big community here that is all about preservation and throwing neighborhood parties (porchfest). The homes are beautiful, old, vacant, some completely run down but there is a new home being rehabbed every day. It'll happen eventually, now that a lot of people who made riverside cool are getting priced out.  edits"

So Jacksonville is attempting to mandate visibility of license plates that aren't even required to exist in the first place.

jacksonville,3bbmhu,yellowstone10,-1,Sat Jun 27 22:19:32 2015 UTC,"The proposed bill is aimed at cracking down on the visual blight that occurs when vehicle owners store cars that don't work on their property.  Proponents say it's needed because city code enforcement inspectors face problems cracking down on abandoned vehicles because they need to get the license plate information in order to write a citation. If they cannot see the tags from the street because the car is backed in, they cannot go onto private property to get a closer look at the front of the vehicle.  The bill filed by City Councilman Warren Jones says that if a vehicle's tag isn't visible from the street, the owner must write down that information with 2-inch tall letters and post it in a location that inspectors can easily see from the street.   This sounds... basically reasonable? Better option, in my opinion - require license plates on both the front and back of vehicles."
jacksonville,3bbmhu,Zak,10,Sun Jun 28 12:37:07 2015 UTC,"For the most part, when people have non-working cars in backed in to their driveways, it's because they're poor and can't afford to get the cars working or registered at the moment. Do you seriously want to make their lives worse by fining them, forcing them to sell their car for next to nothing or confiscating their car just because you think it doesn't look attractive? If you do, you might be a bad person."
jacksonville,3bbmhu,yellowstone10,-6,Sat Jun 27 22:59:57 2015 UTC,"Do you seriously want to make their lives worse   I want to live in a neighborhood that looks generally clean and well kept-up. That's going to require my neighbors and I to spend some time and money. If there's someone for whom that's an undue hardship, they should certainly be able to challenge the citation on those grounds in court. Or better yet - do what some other countries do and base fines on monthly income. Saying ""go ahead and leave whatever the hell you want in your front yard"" is not the solution."

For those who have specific standards they would like upheld in their neighborhoods, it appears Jacksonville has a number of areas with homeowners associations.  Do people in your neighborhood keep non-functioning cars backed in to their driveways so they can't be ticketed? I suspect this doesn't address a real problem and has more to do with ticket revenue or Warren Jones' dislike for poor people than anyone's quality of life being seriously impacted by their neighbors having non-working cars."

The beach is great for nightlife or spending time in the beach itself, but I suggest not spending your whole time there. What type of activities do you enjoy and where are you staying? We have a baseball team, St. Augustine is also nearby (very busy this time of year), zoo, water activities, etc. There's also a BYOB sunset cruise in Fernandina."

jacksonville,3b01ne,HonziPonzi,3,Thu Jun 25 10:31:47 2015 UTC,"That's the current code, and their proposal removes the 15 days, meaning if you are doing your own car repairs, you have to do it in an enclosed garage or you can be cited, on top of the proposed lunacy about your license plate being visible from the right of way.  THESE FUCKERS ARE CRAZY. Seriously. Crazy. Not like, ""haha politicians are crazy, right yall?"", but like, they are seriously, incompetently dangerous with the power they wield and should be removed from office crazy."
jacksonville,3b01ne,dezmd,-5,Thu Jun 25 11:06:01 2015 UTC,"Their problem isn't with people like you that are actively trying to repair their cars, or other people who really own and care for their cars.  They're trying to pass this to prevent actual abandoned vehicles.  For instance, there was a house on my street that was in foreclosure.  After sitting abandoned for over a year, a car suddenly showed up in the driveway with no wheels, and no license plates and just sat there.  Someone abandoned the car there rather than paying a junkyard to take it in.  THIS is what the city is trying to prevent.  We've all driven past those homes that have 4 cars in the front yard on cinderblocks that have been there so long trees are starting to grow through the floorboards.  That kind of thing, if left unchecked, can decrease property values for the whole neighborhood and could potentially become a danger to kids if they should become locked in an open trunk or something."

Their problem isn't with people like you   I don't repair my own car generally, the city already tries to prevent this with existing code.   If you are going to comment, take the fucking few moments of time to read the article, the proposed legislation (it's even linked in the article), and the comment above that actually states the current code without any need for legislation. This proposal eliminates the 15 day period, AND it makes it illegal to park your car in a way that blocks view of the license plate from the street.  It's entirely about revenue through nitpicking additions to zoning, it's nonsense and un-needed. Passing a law just to say you passed a law."
jacksonville,3b01ne,dezmd,-3,Fri Jun 26 00:16:55 2015 UTC,"Yes, I did read the article.  No need to be mean.  It specifically says in the first sentence of the article that it's to get rid of the problem with abandoned cars, which is becoming an increasing issue, especially since one city code officer told people that they could avoid getting tickets by backing their cars into their driveway because ""if I can't see it, I can't cite it.""  If you think they're seriously going to use this to go trolling regular neighborhoods to randomly cite average Joes that have parked backwards, then you're mistaken about the amount code officers we actually have in Jacksonville.  Go hurl your f-bombs somewhere else."

One morning at 8:00 I heard people talking in my back yard.  I went outside and said ""What the fuck are you doing in my backyard.""  They worked for the City and were looking to see if I had built a pool or any addition in my backyard without getting a permit.  They had to walk 250 feet across my property from the public road to get to my back yard.   The city gave a neighbor a citation for having a boat trailer in his yard without a tag.  It was in his yard, and not the street.  He was 92 years old at the time.  I have a vehicle in my garage that hasn't had a tag for ten years.  I guess if they see that I will get a citation.  Are there any cars at car dealerships that don't have tags?  How about at junk yards? Are they all getting citations? If they pass the law park your vehicle in the proper direction.  Bolt something to the rear of your vehicle so the tag isn't visible or cram another vehicle against the bumper that vehicle.  Edit: I saw another City employee walk into a neighbors backyard to see if they had mowed their grass.  City employees will walk onto your property if there is a chance of extracting money from you.

That doesn't mean that there are no good restaurants here though.

I don't have time to give descriptions of everything right now but they should all be easily found via google.

I've never been there for any other meal, because I've only gone a handful of times when visiting my mom in Jax, but it's delicious!  Moon River Pizza is the absolute best pizza Jacksonville has to offer.

Grumpy's in OP is good down-home style breakfast, but gets packed quick, and is most definitely the senior crowd's favorite hangout.   Metro Diner is good. It's the go-to, it's been on Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives on Food Network. There's a HUGE breakfast menu. HUGE biscuits and gravy that are fantastic, in my opinion.   Lastly, on San Jose in Mandarin, there's a Bob Evans - which is a chain, but damn it, they have good biscuits and gravy."

It has a spicy kick to it that I very much enjoy. They use the spicy gravy if you order Biscuits & Gravy, if you get the other biscuits with gravy and other stuff it will be a different gravy.

jacksonville,3atot5,beatboxing_parakeet,5,Tue Jun 23 17:30:44 2015 UTC,"One takeaway from the One Spark experience is that downtown Jacksonville can and will come alive when it gives people a reason to go there.  The problem, in my opinion, is that One Spark may have been in part a victim of its own success.  The people showed up, but were often there for the festival atmosphere.  This detracted from the purpose of One Spark.  I agree with Ben America that there needs to be a greater VC presence to foster the creativity and ideas that One Spark supports."
jacksonville,3atot5,johnmeeks1974,4,Tue Jun 23 17:50:32 2015 UTC,"Lots of conversation about this all over today. The MJ comments about VC is spot on. How are we hosting an idea festival and NOT using it to show off the city as a whole? Your points about Elton MMR are absolutely right based on feedback from those involved.  So is there a way a group of people could snatch this from the jaws of obscurity and turn it around? The basic idea is good. We just need people who are driven to execute.  I would also add that in addition to VC, ideas that fit a profile should be brought here at no cost to the developers. Bring innovative ideas and capital and you have yourself a festival."
jacksonville,3atot5,benAmerica,3,Tue Jun 23 16:00:15 2015 UTC,"There were a few VCs here in town for the festival, my partner and I were able to pitch in front of them on Thursday I think.  I believe there is a lot of room for improvement with the festival, and I certainly hope it continues, but the quality of the projects must improve as well.  Out of 500+ creators, only like 10 pitched to the VCs, and honestly,  only a few more should have been given a chance.   One Spark needs a creative identity.  Is it tech? Small stage growth? Brick and Mortar? Healthcare? Non-profits? All creators are allowed right now, and I think there needs to be a higher bar for inclusion."

Jason Primo from Primo Ventures was there, and he's from South Carolina. There were 2 others, that I'm pretty sure were also from out of the area.

They are doing a continuous (24 hours over at least 3 days) monitor of me in the EMU or Epilepsy Monitoring Unit. I am wired up to an EEG machine that is catching all of my brainwaves. The reason that they are doing it is because my episodes did not appear during a standard (40 minute) EEG session. As an aside, please pardon any misspellings, or grammar misuse. I got up at 5 AM after falling asleep at around 2 AM, and they are doing sleep-deprivation testing tonight."

Auxiliary (three-digit) Interstates (contiguous U%S%) of article  Interstate Highway System:       Auxiliary Interstate Highways are circumferential, radial, or spur highways that principally serve urban areas. These types of Interstate Highways are given three-digit route numbers, which consist of a single digit prefixed to the two-digit number of its parent Interstate Highway. Spur routes deviate from their parent and do not return; these are given an odd first digit. Circumferential and radial loop routes return to the parent, and are given an even first digit. Due to the large number of these routes, auxiliary route numbers may be repeated in different states along the mainline.  Some auxiliary highways do not follow these guidelines, however. See List of auxiliary Interstate Highways for examples. Auxiliary routes do not follow the same numbering scheme with regards to primary routes with regards to their compass designations.

jacksonville,3agv2m,extratoasty,2,Sat Jun 20 08:33:12 2015 UTC,How much of their business is coal?
jacksonville,3agv2m,nascentia,3,Sat Jun 20 10:46:33 2015 UTC,"Coal is only 5-7% of most rail traffic. I'd say since I'm a contractor for 66% of the US's freight railroads, I know a little bit more about it. CSX and railroads are only expanding and growing and hiring more and more. They aren't going anywhere.   Edit: I can't find exact figures but I looked at CSX's second quarter earnings report for this year (came out a week or two ago) and while coal is definitely down, intermodal and construction are way up, so their year over year projected income is expected to be higher than last year. So sure it sucks that they're losing coal traffic, but coal isn't the biggest deal for them any more. Intermodal is, and other things like natural gas, frac sand, and construction commodities are booking. CSX is worth $32 billion, it won't hurt them.   Anecdotally, I deal almost exclusively with small railroads. They've been hiring a LOT this year, and the small companies are growing massively. Genesee & Wyoming has their safety and operations centers here in Jax. They've tripled in size since 2009 and just recently bought Freightliner, which gave them a massive amount of rail and trucking in Europe and Australia. So trust me when I say, railroads are money generators and they aren't going anywhere."

jacksonville,3agv2m,jaxthrowawy,1 point,Sat Jun 20 06:32:07 2015 UTC,"as someone making just over 50k, affording even a 200k home being single is pretty unreasonable, i'm looking for homes in the range of 160k... at 300k, i'd be spending more than half my after tax income on my mortgage... doesn't leave much for transportation, food, entertainment, insurance, savings, retirement, etc... it's this attitude/mindset that caused the housing market collapse!"
jacksonville,3agv2m,Aycoth,1 point,Sat Jun 20 23:38:33 2015 UTC,"What has?  Its silly to look at your morgate payment as the equivalent of rent. If you really want to get down to it, you should be allocating some of your morgate payment as going into 'savings' as its the only thing on that list besides savings that builds equity. Its not like rent where you throw away the money you spend, it builds up into a tangible asset."
jacksonville,3agv2m,jaxthrowawy,1 point,Sun Jun 21 03:42:05 2015 UTC,"Its non-liquid and there's risk involved. I'm not saying buying a house isn't a good investment. You're more likely to gain value on a house, but its not guaranteed the growth in home value will keep up with inflation.  And it's not like when an emergency comes up, you can sell your house.  Not a great idea to rely on taking out a home equity loan either.  The rule of thumb I've always been told for a mortgage payment is no more than 35% of your after tax income... because there's property tax, home owners insurance, utilities, renovations (homes require a constant upkeep, an expense that is usually covered for rentals as it's the landlord's responsibility)... 50k after taxes comes to $3288 monthly. 35% of that is 1150.  at a 4% interest rate, that's the payment on a $240k mortgage...  That's not factoring in PMI, home owner insurance, property tax, and other important ""true"" take-home pay considerations (it's a good practice not to consider 401k and health insurance as take home pay) and assuming the largest percentage of take home income one should use towards a mortgage so that's the very end of what I would consider ""reasonably affordable"".  It would not be comfortable though..."

jacksonville,3afpeo,ASigIAm213,0,Sat Jun 20 17:41:02 2015 UTC,"Interested to see what everyone thinks but this. I obvious don't like it since I am a member of the fund and don't agree with the changes. It boils down to the fact that for the past 15 years we have given up ok better pay, benefits, given up raises, taken pay cuts, all with the promise that our retirement would remain untouched, which it is now changed.   In the end I feel sorry for the members that are staying, especially the people who are almost retired. If anyone did not know this doesn't effect members with 20 years or already retired, so someone with 19 years and 11 months who was 1 month from retiring still gets these changes. Although I decided months ago I am leaving the city because I don't fee confident in the cities ability to run this city anymore. Remember, the city now has extra pension payments on top of the usual payments, and the new mayor has already vowed to not raise taxes. And he has promised to hire back all the fired officers, all without a tax increase.   If anyone has any questions about the agreement, history, or the SO let me know.   Also, if anyone is interested in a ride along before I leave PM me. I have taken a few redditors on them and it is always a good time."

They go down to the welfare office and tell them they have no income and receive EBT and housing payments of another 20k or so.   Exactly what more do they want from the political system?  Welfare breeds welfare.  Their leadership needs to stop the cycle of public dependence but saying that would get you kicked out of the Democratic party.  The Democratic Party views them as an automatic block of votes and will do whatever it takes to retain that.  They are in chains they just can't see it.

Those people certainly exist. Those people don't vote most of the time.   Welfare does breed welfare in it's current design, because it's not helping anyone get out of that situation and into a better one. Don't give me the ""pull yourself up by your bootstraps stuff, I'm just being level about the viewpoint.   I wouldn't say the party views it as a block of votes, but several politicians in that party certainly do. Take a look at the Deep South. There are many, many poor, rural ares with extremely similar situations like the Northside.   But they go Republican in every election, why?  I agree that the poor are in chains and just can't see it. I agree that there are people like that out there. I don't agree that that's a typical scenario, but it is one that's growing.

The welfare system is designed to keep people poor. With the institution of the affordable care act behavior modification will become normal. For example if someone is part of all three they're greatest ideas/motivations could be disassembled by any roadblock built into these systems. If the individual wanted to be an athlete and got hurt but the affordable care option wouldn't be best due to some reason in a policy then the individual would have to accept as no other option would be available due to the education not being sufficient to think on alternatives and the fiscal limitations which are compounded by poor education.

Can you please find me ONE instance where the ACA tells a doctor to modify someone's behavior? Or is it discussed in the secret doctor meetings?   Your athlete statement is 100% incorrect. The ACA isn't a single payor system. The athlete can go buy themselves private insurance far and above what the ACA offers. Even if they WANTED to be an athlete, and weren't rich yet, there are tons of insurance options available with the ACA that aren't the bare minimum.   Cutting off legs to save money? Are you fucking high? How much do you think a prosthetic costs that your evil ACA would cover? Do you honestly think cutting a limb off is cheaper than saving it?  How would this person give consent? Would they say ""Don't cut my leg off bro"", and the Dr. is like ""yeah fuck that, it saves like $50, we're taking that shit and making the government/hospital purchase you a $10,000 prosthetic"".   How come this hasn't been posted? Stories, news articles, interviews? ""Doctor's took my leg to save money!""  You're literally just regurgitating a circlejerk between conservatives and have no idea what you're talking about.   I'm sure you're all ""hurr hurr piss off a liberal use facts!"", but you're 100% incorrect, and it isn't a matter of opinion. You're just wrong because you refuse to research for yourself, you have to be told what to think the right answer is."

jacksonville,3ac538,DontRapeKids69,3,Fri Jun 19 02:48:53 2015 UTC,"Not exactly, but this does occur. In Jacksonville once an item enters the waste stream it isn't removed. For example you toss a small TV into your now yellow recycling bin. If the automated pickup truck comes by, the bin will likely not be checked and said  TV will be dumped into the vehicle where it will at some level end up in a landfill. Traditional garbage crews sometimes do a quick check on bins to verify their contents and if something obvious like a computer or other electronic equipment is on top they'll remove it for an ancillary recycling vehicle that picks up appliances and other large items. I recycle large volumes of E-waste that is shipped off to R2 level refiners/recyclers for reprocessing and precious metal retrieval. Waste Management is a pretty basic trash pickup/processing company. What recyclable items they do get that are pre-sorted are sold to refineries."

jacksonville,3a7zgq,tedharvey,4,Thu Jun 18 14:18:36 2015 UTC,"Legally, fire spinning in public is considered open flame. Open flame in public is typically banned, without cooperation of the Parks Dept. and a Fire Marshall.  And locally, people get very prickly about open flame, especially when it's been so hot and dry.  That you've been able to fly under the radar so long is lucky. If you want to get legal, talk to the Fire Marshall about what action can be taken, if any."
jacksonville,3a7zgq,WhiskersMcMitten,0,Thu Jun 18 17:07:59 2015 UTC,Those bans apply to open continuous flames with a continuous fuel source. For example a a tiki torch with oil fueling it or a fire pit with wood and coal fueling it.

The Landing could be lovely, but it's just kind of a dumpy shopping mall. I'd turn it into the next Riverside, with small local-owned restaurants and shops, and 0 national chains allowed."
jacksonville,3a5ow2,LusciousPear,6,Wed Jun 17 19:59:11 2015 UTC,Tear it down and create a baltimore inner harbor style shopping and entertainment area. Just went there last weekend and our riverfront could be this:  http://baltimore.org/article/baltimore-inner-harbor
jacksonville,3a5ow2,swatjr,5,Wed Jun 17 13:42:21 2015 UTC,"As I recall, the Inner Harbor and the Landing are virtually identical in terms of architecture. I don't know where we went wrong with the Landing, but at it's peak levels it was just ""fine."""
jacksonville,3a5ow2,Smugsy2099,3,Wed Jun 17 18:29:28 2015 UTC,"While Baltimore and Jacksonville are home to Rouse-designed ""Festival Marketplaces,"" the Jacksonville Landing is designed in a way that does not connect downtown to the river as well as Baltimore's Harborplace links people with the Inner Harbor, IMHO."
jacksonville,3a5ow2,roadslaya,2,Wed Jun 17 21:10:47 2015 UTC,"I mentioned above, Baltimore harbor has the aquarium, multiple old boats + submarine to explore, a science center...a park called federal hill that overlooks the harbor, and the surrounding neighborhoods. None of the locals really go to harbor place (as it's called there) it's for tourists. The problem with Jax landing is there isn't much to really do..especially in walking distance.. that i've seen. Why not go to San Marco or Riverside? There isn't any incentive to do the landing thing, imo, even for tourists."
jacksonville,3a5ow2,Smugsy2099,2,Wed Jun 17 19:21:57 2015 UTC,"I agree. I think the Laura St Trio or the Barnett Building (both, preferably) could be the most important key to getting people there. If young people are living that close, and tourists are staying that close, there will be an increase in business and hopefully NEW businesses meant to get at the new money.  Museums and old ships and shit would be a fabulous step in the right direction though."
jacksonville,3a5ow2,roadslaya,2,Wed Jun 17 19:28:26 2015 UTC,"I still think young folks / meh peers would still opt to go to the local or neighborhood place over the chain/corporate atmosphere. I think chain restaurants are good for tourists (hooters isn't a risky option for food) but not for locals. The 'happening' neighborhoods in Baltimore are inundated with locally owned pubs/resturants/bistros that all offer their own flairs. I think the only big 'chain' places I hear about is Max's (which is like a world of beers) and I'm not so sure that is a chain. I don't know how you translate that into revitalizing the water front, but I don't think it would take a rocket scientist to go around to different cities and look at these things. I also don't mean to sound like I'm churching Baltimore up, because the city has some serious friggin' issues, but the Inner harbor, for the most part, seems to be a commercial success that most take pride in...and the city makes hardly any money off of LOL"

You may be right about the Landing being not so much 'hip' and more tourist-oriented. I guess I'm thinking of the success of the Town Center a bit. Different animal, sure, but if we had student housing downtown, maybe some of those corporate businesses will follow. Who would complain if suddenly the Landing had a new Chipotle, or The Loop or something along the lines of Blackfinn?

jacksonville,3a5ow2,roadslaya,2,Wed Jun 17 20:02:03 2015 UTC,I grew up in Baltimore..I haven't been to Jax Landing because it seriously reminded me and looked of baltimore's harbor place. It even looks like the same developer. Just sterile chain restaurants and shops. Baltimore has the added benefit of an awesome aquarium and some boats to explore but the real gems aren't in the inner harbor but in the surrounding neighborhoods.
jacksonville,3a5ow2,swatjr,2,Wed Jun 17 16:00:39 2015 UTC,Chain restaurants and shops are better than and empty landing building.

jacksonville,3a5ow2,swatjr,2,Wed Jun 17 19:18:53 2015 UTC,Well we need to figure out what went wrong for us bc the Baltimore one is thriving.
jacksonville,3a5ow2,roadslaya,0,Wed Jun 17 19:23:26 2015 UTC,"I kinda addressed that in another post. I wouldn't call it thriving cause businesses do move in and out of there like new fashions, however, they do catch all the foot traffic moving around so there is money to be made..There isn't much around jax landing that I know of (I've only been here two years), where as in Baltimore you have museums, concert venues, baseball etc.. plus Baltimore is more 'dense' so you can walk place to place. I think for the landing to work they'd have to develop more of the riverfront, make it so tourists go there as opposed to riverside or san marco (where the real culture of jax seems to be)"
jacksonville,3a5ow2,Smugsy2099,1 point,Wed Jun 17 19:29:09 2015 UTC,"True, some flagship destinations surrounding the Landing would go a long way. Museum, Aquarium, Barnes & Noble... those are what worked for Baltimore, it seems like. Tall orders, but not out of the question."
jacksonville,3a5ow2,PotRoastPotato,2,Wed Jun 17 19:51:30 2015 UTC,The Landing is already modeled after the Baltimore Inner Harbor.
jacksonville,3a5ow2,youarecaught,2,Wed Jun 17 19:23:38 2015 UTC,You are spot on!  I used to spend my summers in Baltimore as a kid and I was very impressed by the Inner Harbor.
jacksonville,3a5ow2,swatjr,2,Wed Jun 17 13:59:46 2015 UTC,Nice idea. Where should the funding come from?
jacksonville,3a5ow2,youarecaught,0,Wed Jun 17 15:21:31 2015 UTC,"I'd say sales tax or hotel tax increase. You can do a lot with a .25% sales tax increase and people really won't notice because you are talking a quarter on every 100 dollars. This coupled with a mix of private investment should be able to foot the bill. It would be a fairly long project I bet.  Possible state funding? Not sure if that is available for something like this. Maybe use some of that mysterious money they just ""found""."
jacksonville,3a5ow2,dickdonkers,2,Wed Jun 17 15:26:58 2015 UTC,I know tax rates are limited by state law and Jacksonville already imposes the maximum hotel tax of any Florida county (13%)  I'm not sure if they can go any higher on that.
jacksonville,3a5ow2,Jagator,6,Wed Jun 17 17:33:05 2015 UTC,"I really hope they do something to it soon. When people visit I show them around Riverside, and a little bit of downtown. I forgot that I swore I'd never take anyone to the Landing ever again (it's been over a year), and I recently took my brother who was visiting and it smelled like shit walking through the ""mall"" (I wish I could use a stronger gesture than quotes when I say mall), and  the live music was horrible and the area was just so fucking trashy.  It looks like we got stuck in an earlier decade, during a depression or something. The restaurants suck too. The only good thing is the water view, and it's so unfortunate that you have to wade through a pool of shit to get to it.   Can they just bulldoze it and THEN figure out a plan?"

But people on this sub really like to oversell downtown as something it's not and it doesn't help. People going off some people's advice here will go downtown and expect it to actually be nice or cool to go to, and think it's the best Jacksonville has to offer (when it clearly is not), and think worse of Jacksonville for it. We need to be honest about the strengths and weaknesses of the city. Downtown is improving little by little, and is much better than the shithole it was even 10 years ago, but it still is far from where it could be and should be (and will be eventually, I think/hope).  Side note: you have a history of mistaking my passion for improving the local education system (and driving out the politicians I think are actively harming our city's children) as ""bitching"". If you think I'm the kind of person who needs to ""be silent or move"", you're barking up the wrong tree."

Sleiman has dragged his feet and whined and screwed tenants and healthily contributed to making the Landing the shithole it currently is.  No, it's not ALL his fault. He was given - GIVEN - a turd.

If downtown Jax could create more affordable apartments nearby aimed at enticing the young demographic, it would likely draw in businesses to cater to them. Maybe a grocery, likely some bars and restaurants, maybe a brewery. Who knows.  If UNF is still interested in growing their presence Downtown, then maybe some classrooms/upper-classmen dorms closer to the Landing would help. They own MOCA and have classes there already. What if they moved their visual arts departments downtown, along with some dormitories? I know that was part of the plan for the Barnett Bldg, but that unfortunately fell through. :/"

Our parking is cheaper, more abundant and more accessible than any other city I've seen. This is because those other cities are becoming more successful, and we're still just complaining that we can't spit on our destination from our parking spot.  Nobody is going to go downtown in order to park in a new lot."

jacksonville,3a6159,asrhx4,6,Wed Jun 17 14:38:16 2015 UTC,"Jax is hit or miss. Sometimes we get awesome bands, it's just usually few and far between.  In the past few years i have seen Black Lips, Jenny Lewis, Connor Oberst, Diplo/Sleigh Bells, Surfer Blood, Local Natives, Aesop Rock, Why?, and Joyce Manor (just off the top of my head).  For me, my theory is: we get so few shows that even if I have only marginal interest in a band, I go.  Also, Gainesville gets good bands too and it is just a short drive."

If you're in the Julington Creek area there is Alpine Groves Park just south of Fruit Cove off SR13 that has a dock on the St. Johns. Rivertown Park is just south of that on SR13, with a dock, and the old Shands pier is a little further off SR13 where it meets SR16-A. The Shands pier is the largest one, it goes pretty far out into the St. Johns and is a popular spot for fishing and shrimping.   If you'd rather fish in lakes there are a few lakes off of Longleaf Pine Parkway that I've seen people fishing in. I haven't done it myself but if you see people there it typically means there are fish."

In that case, keep in mind that ""the tourists"" could be paying for something that benefits the people of Jacksonville with that money, instead of something that benefits billionaire Shad Khan.  Anyway, this article is about how the Jags get to keep the naming rights money for the stadium even though Everbank is city-owned. The Jaguars don't release how much money those naming rights are worth, but it's a good bet that we're talking about millions of dollars going into the pockets of the Jaguars owner, who again is already a billionaire."
jacksonville,3a5vu2,bhasden,3,Wed Jun 17 23:31:43 2015 UTC,The Jaguars are the only reason there's money from a naming rights deal. Letting them keep it doesn't seem like it's too far of a departure from the reality of the situation.

I mean, he just signed Gene Smith, who was doing an incredible job, to a 3 year extension so you know the Jags would have been better. Who needs stadium upgrades, national presence and brand marketing?  Who needs a multi billionaire to come into this city and try to actually revitalize it and make it more noticeable? The city of Jacksonville was obviously doing just fine without Khan. The Landing is a great spot for tourists and all of the abandoned buildings downtown are just room for future growth. The Shipyards  looks great the way it is, no need to do anything with it. The emptiness of that land just gives Jacksonville a nice ""natural"" feel.  Khan is by far the worst thing that has happened to this city. He's just trying to make millions of dollars taking advantage of our great city.

From there you will meet like minded people and find more and more opportunities to make a difference.   As a group /r/jacksonville is pretty ineffective at making change because we have such divergent ideas on what change is important and necessary.

I have friends who have similar feelings. I think there's more people lurking here than we realize. And for some reason, there seems to be an army of downvoters ready to strike down anything that they don't deem post worthy. For instance, my friend posted on this sub, politely asking if anyone knew of any drum and bass events. It was heavily downvoted. Why? And the other unfortunate thing about this subreddit is that seems to have a lot of negative Nancy's aka the Jacksonville sucks crowd. I have lived in Jacksonville most of my life, and I personally feel this city just gets better and better.

jacksonville,39vfw5,Thumb_Cock,2,Tue Jun 16 18:33:01 2015 UTC,I feel exactly the same which is why I was kinda thinking if putting something up that kinda centralized everything but with everyone's input. That way we can cut down on spamming the sub. You bring up a good point about the down votes. I feel this may address this to. If it's not just for the whole sub but someone particularly looking for something (local artists) it might do better here as people who aren't looking for it won't find it and down vote it. Also hell yeah I love Jacksonville I just wished I knew more of what was going on.
jacksonville,39vfw5,lordyloo,0,Tue Jun 16 19:39:06 2015 UTC,Like you said... You wish you knew more about what's going on. But half the time posts like that get down voted. I don't spend much time on this sub cuz too many hater vibes.
jacksonville,39vfw5,southernmonster,1 point,Mon Jun 29 23:13:37 2015 UTC,"From a mod standpoint - this is an interesting dilemma, and one to pose to the community. In the past, we have had many bar/club/restaurant owners posting, which becomes free advertising for them, but completely fills up r/jacksonville with essentially ads (and, other interesting content gets buried quickly). So, we would ask these businesses to post something uniquely for jacksonville redditors, and only if it was a event (and not something habitual). We also love music and art, but we walk a fine line with content. Basically, and this discussion comes up about once a year, we have been asked by the larger community not to let this become Craigslist for reddit (which was one reason for the no sale posts). We did have an awesome user in the past who would spend hours putting together a ""what's going on in Jacksonville this week."" This was amazing, and we highlighted that post. Anyway, this has been some of our experience with trying to maintain a content balance for everyone who is here. However, we are interested in community feedback! What are your thoughts?"
jacksonville,39vfw5,Thumb_Cock,2,Mon Jun 15 20:21:57 2015 UTC,Errr.. The flooding on the facebook group is not my favorite attribute. But I love the idea of a weekly collective post.

jacksonville,39vfw5,aknutty,3,Tue Jun 16 05:24:15 2015 UTC,Well I figured this way the amount of work one person would have to do would be minimal. Anyone can contribute and the community can find what they need. One person aggregating everything going on in Jacksonville sounds like way to big of a task but if you just created enough to sort easily and allow others to build a lot of work can be done easily and quickly. This way individuals and companies can contribute as much or as little as they want without spam being a problem. What were you thinking that could improve this model?
jacksonville,39vfw5,lordyloo,1 point,Tue Jun 16 05:41:05 2015 UTC,"I don't think that's a bad suggestion, (also, thank you for actually doing something - it is appreciated!). I just did a read-through, and there were some comments. I think your suggestion is great, now we just need to work out the logistics, like, how does a post with dates keep coming up in the postings so that people will keep posting updates? This could be a sidebar update, or spreadsheet, or other type of format?"
jacksonville,39vfw5,aknutty,2,Tue Jun 16 05:54:52 2015 UTC,That's why I thought the sticky would be best. But yeah it would get buried unless we said (please upvote) in the title. Also i think maybe pairing it down to weekly updates may be a better idea. But then it's hard to plan and hype for big events.

There's no menu and they only serve one thing (the gyro). I always get a kick out of the ordering process which usually goes something like:  Them: ""Hey, how are you?"" Me: ""Good"" Them: ""You want one?"" Me: ""Yes, please.""   And then about 5 minutes later they hand over a delicious gyro."
jacksonville,39vh72,bhasden,3,Mon Jun 15 15:29:29 2015 UTC,"Can't remember the name of the place anymore, but right next to that (I remember because it was adjacent to Cha Cha's) there was a little pizza place that also served gyro, and it was amazing because that guy made all the bread fresh.  He explained, almost all the gyro meat served comes from a small group of suppliers, it's all the same, so to do something different with one, it has to be outside the meat, and in his case, it was amazing bread.  That was back when I lived in the Villages of Baymeadows.  I moved away, and he closed up shop.  Coincidence?  You bet."

jacksonville,39ypu3,StainWaggin,1 point,Tue Jun 16 00:13:43 2015 UTC,That's what I was thinking. A mod asked me to try and make something up but I don't have hours to update everything myself for free. Just set up a quick model and let every member of the community add what they want. Also i was thinking sticking it to the top would be most efficient. One person doing 100 things is too much but a hundred doing one is easy. The trees could definitely be better but im not sure of the fastest way to make them up in reddit. Also i thought this would cut down on crazy spammers or on one person or group gaining to much control and drowning out others. If you can think of a better way I'm open to ideas.

jacksonville,39uevx,DaKingPin,3,Sun Jun 14 21:34:15 2015 UTC,Thursday nights at the Mellow on Jax beach has some of the most beautiful girls around.  The beach bars in general are pretty easy to meet new people but sometimes ( on the weekends) they get a little too loud and crowded.  I've been enjoying all the micro-brew places around since they seem to be more quite and you can actually hold conversations.
jacksonville,39uevx,SubClavianGroove,1 point,Mon Jun 15 17:30:07 2015 UTC,"I upvote the beautiful girls observation. Its INSANE at times. I just don't see how you actually get to talk to any of them. All in big groups with what appear to be frat guys.  The micro-brew idea isn't a bad one. And the beach bars seem to be alright but there's few people going it alone, which gets tough sometimes.  It's hard not to feel a little blue when you're at a pub crawl with almost a thousand people and you are quite literally the only person by yourself there."
jacksonville,39uevx,SubClavianGroove,0,Mon Jun 15 19:11:05 2015 UTC,That's true I guess I can't relate to that since I went to UNF it was very easy to meet new people. It's crazy how much easier it was to make new friends when you were younger.  I guess you could try and go out with coworkers and branch out from there?  Worst case scenerio you can use that meetup website.

jacksonville,39uevx,glycine_xx,3,Tue Jun 16 21:04:41 2015 UTC,Nothing good I've ever found. Jacksvonville sucks for meeting people. I don't even think singles bars are a thing anymore.  You're better off setting up an actual date on POF or something.

Okcupid on the other hand, I'm not bad. I pull a lot of numbers.  But lately it seems like 80% of the girls on these sites (including Tinder) don't actually want to meet anyone.

All of the riverside bars are pretty awesome, except loft on Thursdays. O'Brother's (actually met my wife there), Garage, Dahlia's... That's about the best you'll get in jax.

I’m with Tails From The Barkside Pet Rescue, a licensed 501(c)(3) charity based in South Florida, and we need help finding forever homes for two of our rescues.   If you are interested in adopting one of the dogs below you can reach us at tailsfromthebarkside@yahoo.com. You can also follow the dogs on Facebook or visit our webpage (looking for web design help)     Leia:  This sweet 6 month old princess was found roaming the streets of Miami. When Leia was brought in to Miami-Dade Animal (high kill) shelter she was severely emaciated, anemic, full of worms, marked with scars and sick with kennel cough. No one knows exactly what she’s been through or how she survived. Leia weighed only 16 pounds when we rescued her. Nearly all her bones were visible and she was very weak.   For the past month we have been nursing Leia back to health, and we are happy to say she has nearly doubled her body weight!   Leia gets along great with most dogs and prefers a cat-free home.  She loves to sit by your feet, on your lap or anywhere close to you. Consistent meals and toys are new and wonderful to her, and she enjoys laying out in the grass working on her tan. She is learning commands well and is (expectedly) very food driven. Pics (sorry some aren’t great quality):  Leia’s MDAS intake photo (they had her named Stoney)  First meal post-rescue  2 weeks later  Now 1,    2     Pixie:  Forced owner surrender, it is suspected Pixie was used again and again for backyard breeding. She spent much of her life in a makeshift cage with no comforts or protection from the elements. She was heartworm positive and urgently needed veterinary care. Pixie has been given medical treatment and love for four months; she is now ready to be adopted! With your help Pixie will never need to worry about her living conditions again. This 5 year old sweetheart is great with kids and adults. An attention hog, Pixie would do best in a home where she is the only dog. Pixie is a couch potato, she’s low maintenance and easy to please. Good Girl Pixie is ready to be your best friend!  Before Rescue  After 1,   2,   3     If you or someone you know would like to adopt Pixie or Leia please contact us. If you can help network them on social media we would really appreciate you sharing them. We are offering a free Barkside t-shirt (designed by Redditors) to any adopter or referral leading to Leia or Pixie’s adoption.  Thank you!"

If they would have demolished the building, they could have made it a much more driver friendly curve. Well, they tried. Several times. It is said to be very very haunted.

They tried to build over the top of it but the concrete in the pylons would never set right or crack soon after setting correctly. The metal would rust. You name it, it went wrong.

Aside from the cemetery some of the units are haunted as well. The lady who worked in the leasing office said the complexes used to be barracks until they converted them into loft style apartments. Just as much the vibe from the apartment upon moving in was a little overwhelming. There was strange feels coming from the walk in closet in the far right corner and while I showered I always felt well.. not alone. What really convinced me was the night me and my boyfriend were watching Wolf on Wall Street in bed. I had dozed off half way through the movie, when I awoke and felt for my boyfriend he wasn't there. I looked at the TV and the movie was paused, I turned my head to the right to look for him and he's standing in the corner next to the closet door, way, way across the room, it was 2am, dark as hell, and I hadn't even put my glasses on. But it was my bf. I called out his name. It didn't move, and my boyfriend just walked out of our bathroom like la Dee da  while I'm staring at his doppleganger I was so freaked out I couldn't  say anything. My boyfriend jumped on top of me, obstructing my view. When he laid down three seconds later it was gone. I never saw it full on again but I always felt something.

jacksonville,397c3n,Smugsy2099,3,Tue Jun 9 19:53:19 2015 UTC,"I'm kind of torn on all of this Khan and local business stuff going on in the past year.  One hand, it seems like Khan is bullying local entrepreneurs who are trying to think big and get access to the money needed to make their visions a reality.  Often times I really like what these people are trying to do and I really want to see them succeed, so it makes me sad to see Khan just take over.  I also don't want to see in Jacksonville what happened in Detroit with Dan Gilbert just buying all the property.  On the flip side, I may have only been here for five years, but it seems like these people have been playing this song and dance for a while.  What progress has this guy made on the building?  What the hell has he done with Khan's $3M plus any other financing he's been able to secure?  Why does his ""vision"" for the Barnett Building seem to change every year with no progress being done?  It's relevant to my issue with OneSpark.  I like the festival and I have a fun time at it, but it seems like the quality of the innovators has dropped as each year goes on.  What has the festival done for the city?  Is Jacksonville becoming the kind of hotbed of innovations and entrepreneurship that OneSpark was seeking?  If not, is because it's not working or because we haven't given it enough time?  While I don't like a single rich guy having such an impact on the city, at the same time if he's able to do something with that property that's in line with the original vision (not demolish it unless it's completely beyond saving), then why not if Atkins is just sitting on it otherwise?  It would help speed the progress of revitalizing the downtown area, benefit the small business owners who put their stake in the ground in downtown, and probably be a net positive for the city.    But he's probably going to ask the city for public money like the shipyards... I don't know.  I'm torn."
jacksonville,397c3n,amurrikan,3,Wed Jun 10 11:30:37 2015 UTC,"As far as the Barnett, I mean, he loaned the dude what, like $3M? And there hasn't really been any work done on it (you should see it from the inside-- ENORMOUS hole right in the middle of every floor going from 2nd story to the top). I feel like Khan has been put in the position of trying to do the right thing many times, and then the people he invests in dont come through and he has no choice but to sue them.  On that note, I think its encouraging if we give him public money (a stance I have definitely done a 180 on): the guy doesnt need to rip off the city by skimming off the top, so i dont see him making out like a bandit.   Plus, he obviously someone who expects actions, not words, so i think he will get the job done.  He kind of has to to improve his investment in the team.  As for One Spark, no, it isn't going to change the city beyond being a fun street party every year.  The reasons are myriad, but I don't really feel like going on about that at the moment."
jacksonville,397c3n,MURDER_ME_RACHEL,2,Wed Jun 10 12:39:22 2015 UTC,"I feel you. I'm not sure what to think of him either. I haven't been deep in the know for the Barnett situation, but I would love to hear about what progress had been made and even more I would love to know what Stache intends to do with the property. There are not a whole lot of takers on the property, I'm terrified that it will sit unfilled for another two decades until it cannot be saved and must be demolished in favor of a parking garage (knowing this city). Kahn can be a good thing for this city but you kind of have to get it right the first time or else he'll just split. If that happens enough times, he may just COMPLETELY uproot from Jax. He doesn't have patience for any type of speed bumps, it seems. As for One Spark, I love the thing. It has problems for sure, but the thing is modeled after Art Prize in Grand Rapids, and the results they've seen from their similar festival are staggeringly great. One Spark just needs to fine-tune the platform and hopefully it will continue to show and grow Jax's potential as a destination. I think that it needs at least ten years before anybody considers it a flop. So far it's certainly brought Downtown some business, at the very least."
jacksonville,397c3n,MURDER_ME_RACHEL,2,Wed Jun 10 12:36:10 2015 UTC,Just to add: I spoke with a longtime resident of Grand Rapids about Art Prize this month when I visited. The problems and hurdles he described were damn near exactly the same as the problems I would describe for One Spark. And even with those issues ArtPrize still restored their downtown area substantially. That gives me hope.
jacksonville,397c3n,MURDER_ME_RACHEL,2,Wed Jun 10 12:41:11 2015 UTC,"From what i have seen first hand, i don't really see any progress on the Barnett.  Maybe they have improved wiring and/or plumbing (i.e. things not visible to the eye), but when i was in there back in the winter, it didn't look like anything has been done.  As far as Art Prize/One Spark, yes, I'd say OS is modeled after Art Prize, but it is a very different beast.  Art and business ideas are very, very different animals in my eyes.  Plus, I'd be shocked if the people running Art Prize have egos as huge as some of the people running OS, which, in my belief is a HUGE impediment for OS."

And I don't know them all, but I know several One Spark employees/founders etc, and I've not experienced much of this ego. I mean, the PR is big talk, but PR usually is anyway. So I guess I'm not seeing what you're seeing there.  But enough One Spark, the Barnett still had no progress when I was in there at the last One Spark (and I think I've been in there since, but I'm drawing a blank on when). I don't blame Shad for pulling the plug, really. But I want to know what the circumstances of this failure were, before being too harsh of a critic on either of them. I'm not fool enough to think nobody was trying to make it work. So what went wrong I wonder?"

At one point recently, according to some (?) statistics, Jacksonville was the most dangerous city in the US for bicycles.    I think a lot of those statistics had more to do with the geographic size of the city than the attitude of Jacksonville drivers.  I would say that riding a bike in downtown can be done, but it would be more for the experienced biker.  I'm somewhat experienced but the thought of rush hour on a bike in downtown Jax curls my toes.  Daylight, non-rush hour would be a lot more safe.  I guess if I lived downtown and only had my bike I would get my groceries at Fresh Market at the corner of May and Stonewall.  It would require a pannier to be stable and carry a load, but it would not be too bad.  There is a company in town, Burro Bags, that is plugged into the downtown biking scene.  Good people and very friendly.  Best of luck to you and I hope you enjoy your Jacksonville experience."

I'm convinced Jacksonville folks don't have the first clue what that word means, it's like asking a fish if the air is breathable, most Jacksonville folks have never seen ""walkable"".  Five Points is the only ""walkable"" neighborhood in Jacksonville right now, thanks to the Publix (All other candidates for walkable neighborhoods lack a grocery store). Meaning restaurants, one or more parks and (most importantly) a supermarket of some kind within a 5, maybe 10 minute walk (unless you think a 60-minute round trip to carry groceries back to your place 3 times  a week is fun), and multiple strip malls in close proximity don't count."

From my dealings with the city government, they are 30 years behind in terms of Urban Planning and Land Use policies.

jacksonville,3944a6,joveryall,3,Tue Jun 9 16:05:49 2015 UTC,"As a person who works downtown, there is very limited entertainment outside of concerts at the Florida Theater or Times Union Center. Those go for about $60 a person on average.   Jacksonville's downtown is not a place that is designed for living. There are two apartment buildings that are close to the river (11 E. Forsyth and The Carling) both of those are really nice inside but don't leave your bicycle locked outside in the parking garage because it will get stolen. There are two more up near the homeles shelters. One on W. Ashley St and one on W. Church St. The one on Church St is nice the one on Ashley is really iffy.   There are restaurants, but they are pricey or disgusting. Mostly sandwich shops that are open during the day for the large corporate buildings or law firms. They close at about 5:30-6.   After 8 the ""sidewalks"" are rolled up. It does get busy downtown during One Spark (1week a year) and Fl/Ga. Fl/Ga is a nightmare for everything. Nothing but drunk college kids urinating, throwing up and fucking for blocks.   The only grocery store is at 777 N. Market St. which is a Winn Dixie. It is filled with homeless people, drug addicts etc.  you can bicycle to the Publix at the corner of Riverside and Margret St.   The only areas of town it is actually possible to get around by foot reasonably is Riverside, Murray Hill, Town Center area or beaches. If you are hell bent on living downtown look for some place in springfield.  If you could afford it there are new apartments being built in the Little Brooklyn area of town. Overall I would avoid moving to Jacksonville unless you had too.  I've lived her for 30 years in almost every part of town. The crime rate is insane.   Edit: The only free dog park worth a damn is in Springfield at the corner of Market and Phelps but it floods if it rains and the creek is marked that you cannot eat fish from it because of bacteria levels."

Plus, the riverwalk, which I'd recommend taking as your bike path to 5 Points, is awesome-- very well landscaped and looks terrific.  If you are considering downtown as an option, and really dont mind biking as your form of transportation, you'll be set.  I am assuming youre probably in your 20's? You'll be fine.

jacksonville,38qbay,kmethridge2,2,Fri Jun 12 21:18:30 2015 UTC,"Latitude 30 is fun. Basically an arcade where you get to get drunk. You'll probably spend more since there are drinks and games to pay for.  If I were you, I'd bar hop at the beach. The Ritz, Brix, Lynch's Irish Pub, and all the other bars you see in those 3 blocks.  edit: I didn't read the under 18 part... um... I guess you should be asking where to get fake IDs."
jacksonville,38qbay,Smugsy2099,1 point,Sat Jun 6 04:15:54 2015 UTC,"I'll look into Lat. 30! It sounds fun.   I heard some beach bars are 18 and up, I might call and check if they are!"

jacksonville,38qbay,Weigh13,2,Sat Jun 6 04:35:19 2015 UTC,"Just to offer an opposing viewpoint: Lat360 is fine, but some of the staff there have been, in my opinion, extremely unwelcoming and shitty, especially if you aren't spending as much as they want you to. I'm guessing your younger friends wont want to drop $50 on just dinner, so they may get the runaround and shitty service.  Beach bars are hit or miss. Brix cards for sure, but dont go there anyway unless you love the smell of desperate bros ready to grind on any human woman around. It's pretty gross. If you're beach bound, try Poe's instead and then go slum it at Pete's (assuming its 18+, cant remember). Thats a recipe for a fun night.  I think Kickbacks is a good option too, as stated elsewhere in this thread. Really, Riverside is your friend. Most bars don't card, and most do food as well.   I will say though that if it was me, I would go to the Burro Bar/Underbelly combo for a night of heavy drinking and hanging around. Food options are right there and I don't believe either will card you unless there's some bands playing from out of town or something."
jacksonville,38qbay,palocat,2,Tue Jun 9 13:04:09 2015 UTC,It's down off of A1A next to the avenues mall on the right. It's an awesome place. Atlantic/Neptune beach have a lot but I think a lot are 21+.

jacksonville,38qbay,Mattspyro,1 point,Sat Jun 6 23:41:34 2015 UTC,I think they do Bangarang Saturdays at Harmonious Monks at Jax Beach. That should be 18+ (they may have to pay a cover though)

In our general area there are tons of things that might elicit your interest. Hard to give advice with limited data.  Sports: Jax Sharks, Suns, Armada ... and Jags!

jacksonville,38pfej,Smugsy2099,1 point,Sat Jun 6 01:47:28 2015 UTC,"Depends on what you're fishing for. Eating fish out of the St Johns I would not recommend. For sport, sure.. If you want to take a short day trip and really see Florida, head out to the beach. If your Dad's place is around Plummers Cove, as the crow flys we're neighbors. At the same time, he see's that dock everyday.. take him out and see some other areas. Even a little further north of Huguenot is Talbot Island. Everything I've mentioned is really a 30 minute drive away from our neck of the woods. So, back to my original question, what do you like to do and how much time? Tons to do and it is all really close to us here. Oh... check out Clark's Fish Camp!!!!"

As a result, Intuition is accepting returns for any bottles people don't want to drink. Apparently the beer won't go to waste since the staff likes the sour flavor and will be drinking any returned bottles."
jacksonville,38l9tl,HalfGingGhost,6,Thu Jun 4 23:11:18 2015 UTC,"I know i am a little late to the party but here is my take:  Canned:   Intuition I-10 is good, Bold City Mad Manatee is better, but Hop Banshee by Veterans United is much better. I-10 is a bit lighter and less flavorful to me, Mad Manatee being middle of the road. Bold City Killer Whale Cream Ale is a great beer to get non craft beer drinkers to open up to craft, it is essentially a more full bodied, nutty, buttery, blonde ale. Speaking of Blonde Ale, Veterans United Raging Blonde is a great, not overly complex beer, another great introductory beer for non craft drinkers. Bold City Dukes Cold Nose Brown Ale, this shit is glorious, for a canned brown ale, nothing that is distributed in florida beats this in my opinion. Yes, i am including Cigar City's Maduro. Intuition John Boat doesn't really have any local competition, so i would say it is our best locally canned Kölsch style ale. These are a great Summer beer. Fishing, Mowing the lawn, camping, other hot outdoors activities, this beer is an instant thirst quencher. Intuition People Pale, Like I-10 but not as hoppy to me.  Intuition Kind Street Stout is a really good Imperial Stout, 9% abv, in a can, pours pitch black and viscous with a good stiff head (heh), smells like chocolate and coffee, tastes of caramel, chocolate, coffee.   Not So Canned  I am not going to go through the list of 100+ Local beers, I will point out some really good ones at each brewery, and what each brewery is really known for.   Aardwolf - These guys are known to really try some outside the box stuff, Things your should look out for are their sours: Sarah Lovely Dark Sour, Gose, Hipster Popsicle, and if you are really brave, Lactic Zeppelin. Their IPA's: Hop up the Wolves and Insert Hop Pun Here. Their Stouts: Styrofoam Pony and Zardoz. If they have Zagrues still, its a very good Belgian Tripel Bold City - These guys dont make quite as many beers, but they put a lot of effort into the ones they do and they make sure they are consistent. Besides the canned beers, their 1901 Red Ale is a pretty good beer.  Green Room - Count Shakula, Count Shakula, Count Shakula. Also, Quetzalcoatl. But avoid hanging out at their taproom on most nights, it has become a haven for all the beach bar douchebags who want to pretend they enjoy craft beer.  Intuition - Intuition is like a halfway point between Bold City and Aardwolf, they are willing to try some neat stuff, but not too crazy, and they usually have an impressive line up. Their Stouts: Coffee Dark Star, King Street Stout and Nior Belge are all amazing. Their Shotgun Shack Black Rye is a great American Black ale. Riverside Red, Penalty Kick ESB and Twisted Branch IPA (Collab with Aardwolf) are all good options as well. PingleHead - I feel bad, i have yet to make it out to these guys, i have heard great things. i have had their Red ale, which was delicious. Veterans United - Scout Dog 44 is a great Amber ale, and their Naughty Rye Pale Ale is probably my favorite Pale Ale or Rye beer locally. Zeta - A lot of people love this place, their Power to the Porter is very popular and their Twin Finn Lager and Ruby Beach are great Summer beers. Great Food, though a bit over priced for the small portions in my opinion, but I'm a fatty soooo...   EDIT: Forgot Wine.  As far as Wineries go, i think we only have 1. San Sebastian in St. Augustine. I have only had 3 or 4 of their wines, but their Castillo Red is my Favorite, oakey and spicey, deep burgundy and dry. Their Vintners Red and White are both Good, Both are Sweet and play up the flavor of Florida's native Muscadine Grape.  EDIT 2: BLARGH, forgot Engine 15...   Engine 15 - This place is small but has a great tap selection, including their own beers, i would keep an eye out for the Old Battle Axe IPA and their Nut Sack Brown Ale, and if you like hopmonsters their Double Drop is a very high IBU IPA"

I never said there was anything wrong with other people liking it. I never said it's a TERRIBLE beer, just that it doesn't have a lot of flavor. If someone came to Jacksonville and wanted to try out the craft beer scene, is that THE beer you would give them to showcase what we have to offer? If so, then I'm disagreeing with you. I'm not trying to invalidate your preferences. My favorite beer in Jacksonville is Aardwolf's Hasselhoffefeizen before it was discontinued. Do I think it's the BEST beer in Jacksonville? No, probably not. If your edit is referring to me, just like I told the other person that got very defensive and called me an IBU snob, I don't like IPAs, I don't like stouts or other ridiculously strong beers either, and I don't understand why people keep making this dichotomy of you either like a bland beer or the hoppiest beer in existence, as if there's no other beers out there."

jacksonville,38l9tl,carpespasm,2,Fri Jun 5 14:10:19 2015 UTC,"Just as a general guide: I haven't had many local brews that weren't good for some time or occasion, but here's my guide for what's generally the case as I've seen it. Not a hard and fast thing by any means. Bold City for good standbys. Their ales, reds, etc... They're stuff is smooth and where I start folks that are used to macrobrews. They and intuition have pretty wide distribution in town too. Their taproom feels homey and warm. If you go there and something's tapped that's barrel aged: GET IT. Thank me later. Intuition for IPAs and other hoppy/bitter standbys. They seem a bit more experimental with their short-run brews than BC. Their taproom is a bit ""cooler"", and they generally have more variation, but they're a bit pricier too. Not bad, just different. Brewer's Pizza/Pinglehead Brewery. Same place, Lots of local and regional small brews. Lots of high gravity goodness. Their signature in my mind is making beer that's 8-12%abv, is ""thick"", and tastes odd compared to most beer, but is always great. They also make good BBQ pizza. When they open a barrel-aged beer it's usually gone in a day or two, and with damn good reason. I've not been to the other local breweries enough to get a strong feel for their niches, but any of them are worth a taproom visit, you'll have a chance to try stuff that doesn't get distribution or bottling beyond growlers."

I'm sure that there will be people with different experiences, of course.    The area that you're looking in is probably good in terms of crime.  I'm out closer to the beach, and can get to the UNF area in 10 minutes or so.  When I hear crime statistics about Jacksonville, it feels like a different city.

Needless to say we are alarmed, and on high alert...  Just thinking about crime here, and the focus on violent crimes and murders. I think it's important to compare Duval with other Florida cities. In 2014, Duval County had 96 murders. That's one murder for ever 9,000 people or so. This is important as we rank the third highest county in that regard.   From a incidence standpoint, Miami Dade (212), Orange (90), Palm Beach (78), and Broward (75) are all relatively close except Miami.   2014 Murders/ Population/ Rate  LA- 541/ 3.9 million (1 for every 7,209 people)  Chicago- 407   /2.7 million (1 for every 6,634 people)  New York- 328/  8.4 million (1 for every 25,610 people)  Detroit- 304/ 689,000 (1 for every 2,266 people)  Jacksonville- 96/ 843,000 (1 for every 8,781 people)  Maybe it's time to realize we are a bigger city than we think, crime included. To echo what some have said, it's really about where you live. I will also say that almost everywhere in the city is safe during the daytime. Hanging out off N. Main street and 45th at midnight? Not a good idea.   TL;DR- We have more people than Detroit, we have less murder per capita than them, Chicago, and LA. Think Orlando is nice? They had about the same amount of murders we did and Palm Beach/ Broward are right behind us."

Haven't lived there in a year or so, so I don't know if there are any new restaurants or if some I listed are no longer there.  2 bedroom apartments are roughly 1,000/month, depending on what floor you live on (there's 3 floors, lower are more expensive).  They're pretty nice and the management doesn't put up with BS like noisy neighbors.

I also do drugs and I think that's such an important aspect of who I am that I gave myself a drug-related username. I did something stupid while diving once and lost my license but I have it back now. Who will hire me?  Reality questions for you: What skills do you have? What can you do that a machine can't?  Also, if you're a comedian... How quickly can you come up with new material? Because that is probably one of the most important skills you could have that would translate into real money.  Regardless of your job prospects I suggest you challenging yourself by never using the same joke more than once for as long as you can. Test them out on bystanders for sure but never repeat yourself when writing or performing. If you can do that you can basically print money. Make your own YouTube channel!  If you're even mildly funny your channel will be vastly superior to 99% of the absolute garbage that millions find entertaining and your subscribers will grow and grow until you're making thousands a week in ad revenue.  At first it will be basically no money... A $2 check after three months wouldn't surprise me. But if you keep it up a year later you'll be getting $100 checks. Then $200, $500, $1000, $10,000.

As for Guam, I doubt there's as big a sense of responsibility or liability, much less against a tourist.  I could be way off base, but I don't believe I am. People understand you're vulnerable, and valuing their life they have a sense of value over yours.  I've ridden for a good couple of years in the UK and have done a small amount of mileage here in comparison. You do get a bunch of dickheads, and I have illustrated this to them by helping drivers adjust their mirrors :). Would I let these morons keep me off the road? No fucking way, get yourself a bike and get out there man, it's 100% worth it.

Next, this is not even close to what you are originally looking for, but again, to round out your experience, look towards Jax Kitchens to volunteer with. Many of these are starting businesses, and would welcome help. Plus, you would gain catering preparation experience and many people who run their own packaged food business use their services."

In Clay County, it's perfectly legal to have your own private range on your property as long as you meet a couple of criteria.

jacksonville,380dxc,digifect,4,Sun May 31 22:38:16 2015 UTC,Every two months or so I get the same AT&T rep knocking on my door saying they are upgrading our area but he is always clueless about Gigapower. Hopefully next time he shows up he will be saying something different. This email is a good sign though.

jacksonville,380dxc,final_cut,1 point,Mon Jun 1 11:10:54 2015 UTC,Hopefully. Comcast has the worst service and it's the only one with decent upload speeds. I can't even connect to games reliably from U-verse.
jacksonville,380dxc,Benthum,4,Mon Jun 1 20:27:10 2015 UTC,I ain't holding my breathe.  If you look at the press releases over the past decade.  AT&T has been saying this every couple of years for the past decade.  Congress gave AT&T over a Billion dollars to build out their broadband but they just pocketed the money.   JEA has laid fiber in a lot of areas in Jacksonville before the Comcast lobbyists got to the State Legislature to pass a law making it near impossible for municipalities in Florida to have their own optical fiber ISP.  So JEA and the city made an agreement to allow ISPs like AT&T and Comcast to use that fiber but AT&T hasn't utilized any of it.
jacksonville,380dxc,JvilleJD,5,Mon Jun 1 15:30:52 2015 UTC,I've talked to one of their workers that is part of laying the fiber and he said that they are mainly putting fiber up on poles first.  He also said fiber that would need to be put in the ground likely won't be complete in this city until 2020.  My guess is Comcast fiber (if they start in Jacksonville soon) will target ground first so they can lock people in and fight away AT&T.
jacksonville,380dxc,Benthum,4,Sun May 31 23:46:12 2015 UTC,"There is plenty of fiber in a lot of newer subdivisions. Bellsouth had plans to turn to fiber, and went as far as to start laying it, but when ATT bought them, they nixed the fiber.   I have fiber under my driveway, but can't even get DSL anymore. They only offer DSL in my neighborhood, but there are no free ports. Uverse? Even if I had to go to that, I couldn't, not offered. It's Comcast, or satellite. Competition? What's that?  I don't expect anything from AT&T other than 10-20% coverage and then they'll do a press release saying that Jacksonville is a gigapower city."
jacksonville,380dxc,astrowayne,2,Mon Jun 1 03:06:16 2015 UTC,"Kinda in the same boat. I'm getting really tired of Comcast not caring about the constant issues they are having in my area.  I technically can get their Uverse, but they keep swearing to me on the phone they can offer me 24Mbps and when the tech guy gets to my house he says most they can offer is like 8Mbps.  I'm tempted to ask them if there would be any way to fast track a neighborhood. I'm guessing its expensive, but I know most of my neighborhood could afford to put a dent in the cost for laying fiber."

After installation things were great until about 3 months went by. The internet was slow at times and down at others. My roommate (huge gamer) must have called them 10 times in a week. They finally put us on our own 'channel' and since then it's been awesome. So, one technique is to bug the shit out of them."

jacksonville,37sk5q,SmilingAnus,1 point,Sat May 30 17:14:39 2015 UTC,"Southside is great, but you will still need a car to get around. Only 15 mins to the beaches and 15 mins to riverside/downtown ( the two places with the best nightlife).  I suggest going on a run or walk through the UNF nature trails. Shopping is big around southside with the town center near by.  Also, we have tinseltown which is a great movie theater. I miss the beaches, but southside is definitely great livin if you do it right."
jacksonville,37sk5q,SubClavianGroove,1 point,Wed Jun 3 19:50:03 2015 UTC,"Southside is a cool area, lots of different things to try and do. It's not the most walkable area, but it is fun to park and walk through the Town Center if you like shopping or checking out restaurants. If you're into outdoor activities I would look into some of the run groups that meet around the Town Center and Tinseltown areas (Mellow Mushroom has one each Wednesday at 6:30 p.m., Your Pie has one on Tuesdays, World of Beer has one on Mondays - each is a 5K route that ends back at the restaurant and you get a free beer), you can also check out the nature trails and ropes courses at UNF. Other things to do could include a night at the movies at Tinseltown, grabbing some brews and listening to live music at World of Beer, go check out 3(Fx) Ice Cream, Metro Diner for breakfast, craft cocktails at Moxie Kitchen & Cocktails, grabbing some tapas and wine while playing bocce ball at Ovinte. Lots of fun little things to do. Hope this helps!"

jacksonville,37sk5q,Majigger123,1 point,Sat May 30 02:51:08 2015 UTC,"San Marco isn't too far from Southside and it still has sort of a Riverside feel. Great dining options, the Grape and Grain, and Aardwolf brewery.  There's also the Skyway that takes you to downtown and Riverside from San Marco if you ever wanted to make a whole day out of exploring Jacksonville without driving all over the world, or even just hop over to Art Walk the first Wednesday of every month, or Riverside Arts Market on Saturday mornings.  Being off Southside also puts you very close to the St John's town center and fairly close to jax beach.  Jax beach has a pretty big bar scene.  There are also several restaurants around Gate and Southside.  Mellow Mushroom is a favorite of mine, and I believe they have trivia nights during the week."

jacksonville,37s89c,Spankapotamus,6,Fri May 29 23:39:05 2015 UTC,"Jax beach is great. Living at the beach, especially in the summer is not one you are going to want to miss out on. The atmosphere is great. It feels very hip, young, free spirited and at the same time very tight knit. There are some sketchy areas of Jax beach, but most of it is pretty safe. I would recommend just driving around and looking for ""for rent"" signs. Honestly, that is the best way to go. You can look on craigslist, but you will have better luck just driving around.   There is plenty of nightlife! Not a whole lot of clubs (there are plenty in town), however there is a fantastic bar scene. Monkey's Uncle, Lynch's, Blind Rabbit, Flask and Cannon, and the Lemon Bar are just a few of the awesome places down by the beach. There are also a slew of great places to have hungover brunch the next morning- Beach Hut, Metro Diner, Beach Diner, 3rd Street Diner, but Beach Hut is my personal favorite.  You could find a nice 1/1 in Jax Beach relatively close to the ocean. The commute from the beach to the Town Center/Gate Parkway area isn't bad at all. You can hop right on J. Turner Butler and make it to that area in about 25 minutes. Living at the beach is totally worth it. Lived here most of my life and I absolutely love it. From what you mentioned, it seems like it would be a great fit.  Riverside is also nice, but the vibe is much different from the one you would get at the beach. But, just like the beach it has very rich culture, which I think you would enjoy. It is very hipster-esque, and crunchy. I like it over there, but it is tricky to find housing as it is downtown. You can live on a nice street, and the next street over from you could be sketchy as hell. There is a lot of crime in comparison to the beach, but would probably be worth it if you really fell in love with the area.  I would advise against living around the Town Center/Gate Parkway area. Do not get me wrong, it is very nice. The only thing that gets me about that area is that it seems very cookie cutter. There isn't a whole lot of culture, and in my opinion it feels very stale and bland. I feel like it cheats you out of the Jacksonville experience. If you do live in town, coming out to the beach on the weekends is always an option. However, residents of the beach aren't always welcoming of what are called ""Townies"". There was actually a guy that started making stickers a few years ago that said ""townies go home"". People put them on their cars, signs, etc. It faded out relatively quickly but you get the point.  In a nutshell, I would highly recommend the beach area, riverside is also great but comes second to Jax Beach in my opinion. Overall, Jacksonville is an awesome city and I'm sure you will love it wherever you end up.  Edit: added a link"

I don't think I'd live anywhere else in the city. The beach would be cool to live by, but the atmosphere here is perfect for recent graduates. I'm 24, two years out of graduation so in a similar situation, and this is the place to be. There's many bars within walking distance, a laid back, friendly neighborhood, and engaged community.

jacksonville,37s89c,TheFertileJennings,3,Sat May 30 01:58:52 2015 UTC,"Yeah it is mostly houses. Honestly feels more like a suburban neighborhood rather than a city, and I've had to remind myself to keep the doors locked and stuff. It might be kind of hard to find a studio, but there are apartments and apartment buildings, so finding a one bedroom place for under $1100 a month shouldn't be too hard.

jacksonville,37s89c,DANGERFroggy,3,Sat May 30 05:27:37 2015 UTC,"There are a lot of places that have ""mother in law"" suites with a small place over a detached garage on the back of the property. Also, most of the houses are actually duplexes or quadplexes. You should have no problem finding a 1 bedroom place in your price range. I'm in a 2/1 that's pretty large for less than that."
jacksonville,37s89c,southernmonster,5,Sat May 30 11:43:00 2015 UTC,"In my experience town center is just full of commuters and yuppies. I mean, it's named after a shopping mall. I personally prefer the beaches, but riverside would be my second choice. Riverside has definitely more of a hip vibe while the beach is a little bit more laid back. Beach is a little bit more expensive than Riverside though. Welcome to Jax!"
jacksonville,37s89c,southernmonster,2,Fri May 29 23:49:17 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the input! Do you know if there's much traffic commuting from Riverside to Town Center? On google maps, the commute is about the same as from Jax Beach to Town Center, but Riverside looks a bit more dense than Jax Beach."
jacksonville,37s89c,DANGERFroggy,3,Sat May 30 00:01:14 2015 UTC,"Not really. There's gonna be some traffic either way at any time. I just care about where I spend most of my time besides my commute. =P it's about 15 mins in either direction, but I feel like traffic is a little heavier riverside to town center. 95/I-10 junction can suck."
jacksonville,37s89c,smt07c,2,Sat May 30 01:48:50 2015 UTC,"I live in the Town Center and doubt I could be a yuppie. I do like organic orange juice, Whole Foods, and pedicures so maybe I'm in denial.  How about a little more information about you before we give you some advice. Do you prefer new buildings or older buildings? Are you healthy lifestyle focused, career orientated, or a bit of a hipster?"
jacksonville,37s89c,shobawobadoba,2,Sat May 30 00:07:42 2015 UTC,"Thanks! Added some info to the post.   The vibe I've gotten from my search so far is that Town Center is kinda mall-ish/commercial (nice franchise restaurants but not much local influence). Living in Town Center, do you find you leave the area a lot for dinner/nightlife, or is it pretty self-sufficient?"
jacksonville,37s89c,SmilingAnus,3,Sat May 30 00:52:49 2015 UTC,"EDIT: I think based on your information, you're a good candidate for Riverside. There's a few new apartment complexes with a modern vibe that just opened. There's a few converted condos in older buildings, that would be up your alley, too! Not sure of the pricing on the Chelsea Lofts and I see someone just posted the new complex that opened in Riverside.   I used to live in Cali (Sacramento, to be exact) the traffic here is nothing. There is a pandemic of broken turn signals."

San Sebastian over in St Augustine uses them. They might be willing to sell you some, or would know someone else who grows them.  I would also reach out to a small local grocery store.

jacksonville,36w9er,bmrossman,5,Fri May 22 17:18:15 2015 UTC,"I am an Electrical Designer that works for a firm here in town. The majority of the companies that I have been around for a while ~6 years now have slowly started integrating Revit into their designs. The thing is that they, and we, still use it more as a 2d drafting tool more than 3d. Not because we don't know how to use it, but because the time that it takes to render a 3d model and coordinate with the appropriate disciplines (elec, mech, plumb, struct, arch) takes too much time and money and is not worth it in the long run. In the end the contractor is going to put the device in the approximate locations and knows how to do his job. I worked for a coordination firm in GA and was exclusively hired for 3d coordination in Revit. That company served as a middle man for Design firms and sub contractors to make HUGE buildings faster to build. The majority of firms here don't do that kind of work, speaking from experience. You'd be better off learning some Civil and working as a surveyor for the city drafting underground power lines, water lines, roads etc. The only other place that 3D is useful is military work, specifically NAVFAC and others where design standards are much higher because of LEED accreditation processes."
jacksonville,36w9er,RevLoki,3,Fri May 22 20:10:37 2015 UTC,"Well, honestly, most arch shops and BIM shops have an in house render and model guy (read: the drafting guy who builds models) I think 3d would be prohibitively expensive. It would come down to price, but having worked with architects for a looonnnnggggg time, I can't see them desiring that service, they mostly have I house guys learning revit at this point. Some of the older style architects might maybe want it, but again, it comes down to price. And those guys are seriously cost and technology averse (see B&H for a perfect example of this."
jacksonville,36w9er,forgeJAX,3,Fri May 22 19:23:50 2015 UTC,We provide that service for architects now to make color 3D prints of buildings.  If you streamline the conversion/rendering step we'd help market it beyond the 904.

I don't see a need to blow everything out of proportion. The only reason this is getting on the news is because of the recent bus shooting.  Where was all the news coverage about gun violence at the beginning of the year? Hell I had 10 of my students involved in a decent scuffle with firearms back at the beginning of the year; not a peep from the media.   You know if the media wanted a real story they should investigate why almost 0% of the almost felony sexual assault cases get shoved under the rug at the public schools. Bullying has gone to such an extreme that people don't even know how to process it. But its alright, Vitti is the one that did it, Fucking give em an IEP, classify em as ESE and you can't touch em. They could basically rape someone and only get a day in ISSP, its bullshit. Guns and a little defiance are not the concern right now.  We need student accountability."
jacksonville,36t3hs,ImAchickenHawk,2,Thu May 21 22:51:56 2015 UTC,"As an outgoing senior I cannot tell you how much I agree with you. There was a case where a sophomore basketball player, who was 6'7, basically walked the halls 24/7, got arrested twice while on probation, caused many problems for the star wrestler, fought twice, and got baker acted. All that shit was in one year, and he was still able to come to school, because he had an IEP, and played basketball, he felt as if he could do whatever he felt like. The wrestler was ""encouraged"" to transfer to AC, which is BS since basketball boy walked up to him and said ""Smell my dick and tell me who it smells like."" Referring to wrestler's girlfriend, that started a long feud between the two and their friends. He found out he ran out of chances early May, he was kicked off the team and tried to come to school, he was supposed to go to Grand Park.   Guy was tall for no reason."

jacksonville,36t3hs,eightbic,2,Fri May 22 14:29:10 2015 UTC,"Just comply with officers...if she was legitimately supposed to be on the bus, and the officer was mistaken, this could have been solved quickly if she would have listened to the officer and allowed him to investigate the issue. It seems she got confrontational with him when confronted, forcing the officer to escalate force to evict her from the bus. Officers are human and can have information miscommunicated to them. When this happens, don't catch an attitude with them and the situation will resolve itself."

jacksonville,36rjfm,flapyourwings,2,Sat May 23 12:54:45 2015 UTC,I had a very different definition in my head of what Panhandling was until I came to this thread. As an on-off street performer I was starting to get worried that people might call the police on me for doing something cool in public.
jacksonville,36rjfm,bangarang_bananagram,2,Sat May 23 13:24:16 2015 UTC,"I've had it happen while sitting on the porch of my home minding my own business. Guy walks up asking if he can mow my lawn for some cash, I kindly respond saying no thank you I take care of my own lawn. He then informs me that he's homeless and I tell him the same thing. At that point he decides to start yelling at me from the sidewalk about how I'm a horrible person. From a business perspective, that's a horrible strategy, perhaps one day I'd actually pay to have my lawn done and I'd seek out your services. Instead, you decided to verbally assault me, essentially destroying any chance of that happening."

I have never been harassed by panhandlers and bums anywhere else like I get harassed in Jacksonville.  The JSO don't care.  They panhandle right in front of the courthouse and city hall downtown.

jacksonville,36q3cn,southernmonster,3,Wed Jun 10 18:29:23 2015 UTC,I don't understand what you mean by more appropriate location. Do you mean you would only attend if it is not in a commercial establishment? Only if it's not a restaurant? Only if no alcohol is served?
jacksonville,36q3cn,BisFitty,0,Wed Jun 10 21:34:21 2015 UTC,"Well, I prefer a meetup to not be in a commercial establishment for one, because they can, and honestly should be able to, get a bit boisterous, rowdy and lewd (Especially when games like CAH are involved) which seems a bit inappropriate for a family establishment. Now, if the family establishment were switched to a bar, it would then be unapealing because it would all be centered around drinking, which not everyone is into. Non drinkers are often looked down upon by bar staff (I know this for a fact, being both a non drinker, and former bar worker) because they are not where the money and tips are. Furthermore, bars often have the exact opposite downfall of being TOO rowdy already, making it difficult for meetup participants to hang out and get to know one another. In previous year, the Jax meetup has been at more private establishments, with a potluck style meal and optional drinks. In my opinion, this provided a lot more laid back and comfortable setting for something of this nature than a ""family style"" bar that serves mostly overpriced pub food because it's restaurant is not it's main concern.   Disclaimer: I understand that not everyone will share these concerns, and I only laid them out because you asked me to, not because I want to hound you or argue or anything."
jacksonville,36q3cn,southernmonster,3,Wed Jun 10 21:49:49 2015 UTC,"Gosh, when they were looking for places to host the event.. You should have spoken up or offered to find a venue that met your extensively long criteria.

And the food isn't that bad here compared to most bars."

jacksonville,36ob15,Gorthax,1 point,Thu May 21 12:17:03 2015 UTC,"Dogwood is pretty much as good as it gets! A tip though: if you think you're going to go more than once, sign up for their mailing list. They have a new deal every week, pretty much. A few weeks ago they were doubling gift cards so I spent $50 (which they doubled to $100) and got a 3 month membership."
jacksonville,36ob15,therobbo91,1 point,Thu May 21 13:03:59 2015 UTC,"How long do you have your dog? Is he/she well socialized? I went to dogwood once with my first dog and he had a blast running around. There were many other dogs.   I know that I can't go with my second one, she does not do well with a crowded dog park and is just stressed and does not enjoy it at all. That's why I usually go to the fowler park, if there are to many dogs in the dog park I just take them on a hike instead."
jacksonville,36ob15,cvonderpost,1 point,Thu May 21 17:17:03 2015 UTC,I've had her since 8 weeks.  She is wonderfully social and seems to create groups of friends that wouldn't pack up otherwise.  We live in Nocatee and go to Davis park or the town center park here and she adores the interaction.
jacksonville,36ob15,Gorthax,1 point,Thu May 21 19:27:18 2015 UTC,"Beautifully derpy! If she's that friendly, try out dogwood, I think they can recommend dog trainers as well. I was really impressed by them (but not by the price!)"

She will check up with you later on and even stop by when she's in your area to talk to you and see how you're doing. I've recommended her to a lot of people and never heard anyone that had issues. I linked you to the Facebook so you could see reviews, but she has a standalone site as well.  It's not cheap but she accomplishes so much more than you could get done at something like Petsmart with someone who learned everything they know from a binder. We had two sessions with her and by that point she had taught us how to train so she wasn't necessary anymore. Plus, she works nights and Saturdays too so it's not hard to find an appointment that works for you."

jacksonville,36nai4,JaxJaguar,2,Wed May 20 20:23:37 2015 UTC,"Autobahn is worth checking out. I've been to OGP and several other similar outdoor tracks with gas karts. Autobahn can be really fun if you take the time to learn the turns. They give you print outs with your lap times which are very precise and it's fun to compete against the top times / your friends.   Anyways, give it a shot. You won't be disappointed. It's the largest indoor karting facility in the state.   Ps thoroughly warm up your tires on the first two practice laps. It helps a lot."

jacksonville,36nai4,digitaldisease,3,Wed May 20 23:42:09 2015 UTC,autobahn needs to make one of their tracks larger by utilizing the space better and make the other one more of a high speed oval.  the one in Orlando is much better.
jacksonville,36nai4,ShawnLeary,2,Wed May 20 18:28:24 2015 UTC,"Yeah, there needs to be more straight aways to take advantage of the speed. Once they finally turn the speed up you can't really take advantage of it or you're in a wall."

They are right next to a publix and 3 streets from the sand.  An immediate course of action you might want to take is getting a bicycle ASAP (the main form of transportation beachside).
jacksonville,36n3yz,SubClavianGroove,3,Wed May 20 16:29:31 2015 UTC,The apartments seem nice. I went by to tour it on a sunday while i was in town but the office was closed. They are a bit pricy for jax but the location is nice.

jacksonville,36n3yz,irieriley,2,Wed May 20 18:05:17 2015 UTC,I've been inside one so I can tell you. The apartments are just your typical mega complex - if you have been inside an upscale college apartment complex (The Flats is UNF's example) it is very similar on the inside. Obviously a great location though. Good friends of mine live there and as far as I know they are plenty happy with the location. You can walk to the heart of downtown Jax Beach and can get anywhere else at the beaches by bike or free buggy

Pete's Bar on Atlantic and 1st is a fun dive if you like pool, ping pong, foosball, etc.  Lemonbar about a block away is nice beachfront open-air, but close at 12 I think.  Flies Tie Irish Pub is cool for live local music.  The bars at the Beach and 1st are where the fratboys mostly go, so meh, I'd say stick to Neptune Beach."

It's the annual Jazzfest this weekend. There a re a lot of really cool spots downtown you could check out too. Volstead (Speakeasy style whiskey bar), Dos Gatos, Underbelly (cool venue right on Bay st that will have some cool acts for Jazz After Dark, I'm sure)."
jacksonville,36mz43,amurrikan,2,Wed May 20 17:28:11 2015 UTC,"Shouldn't be a lot of ""Spring Breakers"" for Memorial Day weekend, but Jax Beach proper (near intersection of Beach Blvd) would have the crowd that closely fits that so I'd recommend you avoid it.  Taco Lu is pretty damn good.  There is a local brewery called Engine 15 fairly next door.  I usually go there to grab a few drinks and play arcade games until the table is ready, as the wait is pretty long and they text when it's available.  Green Room is also a great brewery nearby.  If not into the ""Super Young Drunk Crowd"" I wouldn't go near bars like Ritz or Lynch's.  I'd stick to the north probably, though you'll still run into some of the ""young drunks.""  Blind Rabbit is a burger/whiskey bar though in Jax Beach.  You might like it; they probably have vegetarian options.  If you feel like taking a 30-45 minute drive you can go downtown to Riverside, where there are a few more breweries (Bold City and Intuition), different more hipster-y bars (though not nearly as bad as Brooklyn, haha), and a different restaurant selection.  Oh, and Lemon Bar during the day.  Some of the clientele may be a little too drunk bro for your liking, but drinking at a bar on the beach is tough to beat, you know?"

I know some hard core republicans who (at least said) they weren't going to vote for him because they thought saying he was an outsider was disingenuous. And maybe they didn't. Maybe they just didn't vote at all.   That being said, it's pretty sad that we're so disgusted with our politicians that running as the outsider has become the new it thing. Experienced might as well equal corrupt. But the irony is that the guy we voted in becomes the experienced one so then everyone hates him because their problems didn't magically disappear.  Wouldn't it be a better place if we just voted the best guy for the job so that we could get past this ""outsider"" BS?"
jacksonville,36kcyu,dezmd,5,Wed May 20 12:55:59 2015 UTC,"I was aiming more for cynically sarcastic than dramatic.  But the first sentence stands on its own, Curry was entirely full of shit with the outsider angle.  The best guy for the job was probably Bill Bishop, even though he was more of a spoiler type of candidate, but hindsight and all that...  Just wait, national elections are coming and we get to see how the real pros bullshit their way to the top.  Unless Bernie Sanders gets some traction, the candidates on either side will be riding waves of a popularity contest built of lies, half truths, and deceit."
jacksonville,36kcyu,Diogenes-the-dog,-4,Wed May 20 14:02:49 2015 UTC,"I voted for Bill too. Brown had just as many ties to national politics as Curry.  I'm not looking forward to the presidential elections. The local ads were bad enough. Bernie Sanders is just a master panderer promising comfort in exchange for a ""just little more liberty"". Luckily for him there are plenty of ignorant people still thinking ""outsider"" = ""good"". Unluckily for him he has zero chance of ever getting elected."

I'm not an expert on this stuff, but I would imagine he won the democratic vote so moving more to the left wouldn't have mattered there. The independent voters, however, seemingly went for Curry so moving left would've probably hurt him there.  If you're suggesting that fully supporting the HRO would've brought more voters to the polls you may have a point. It's my opinion that getting someone to vote who wouldn't have voted otherwise is very difficult. I don't think the HRO had enough juice to do that, but I'm usually wrong about stuff."

Ultimately, my point was don't get so upset because someone is a different party. Focus on their achievements or lack thereof and see which option is better for the city. Let's see what the guy can do."
jacksonville,36kcyu,Pilot1215,4,Wed May 20 10:31:56 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure what your point is you voted for your party. As someone who has mostly liberal views I voted for Bill Bishop in the primaries, because both Curry and Brown were not good choices. How is Curry better than Brown?  Curry was the Florida GOP president, he is a puppet in a much larger game. If you watched his debate all of his answers were canned and preselected. He was placed here, did you see all of the high profile politicians that spoke out about Curry? What did you find so appealing about Curry because to me he was an absolute idiot."

Yes, I voted for Curry. After reading my comment a day later, I'm not sure why I brought that up. The main point was the sheriff's race. I was on the fence oh that one, and almost voted democrat. My point was to vote for who you think will do the job the best."
jacksonville,36kcyu,mrpickem1,3,Thu May 21 10:12:37 2015 UTC,"I'm a conservative and voted for Curry   Why, Brown capitulated to conservatives all day long. Sounds like you voted a party line."

jacksonville,36kcyu,Mattyv29,1 point,Wed May 20 16:06:17 2015 UTC,"I couldn't vote for Jefferson after watching him on the news. He was a habitual ""victim blamer"", he clearly didn't believe in property rights or defending yourself. His stance was always ""you shouldn't leave valuables where crooks can see them. Don't drive a nice car. Don't wear nice clothes. Don't go out at night. Cower in the corner in your house and wait for sunrise. Don't let your kids go to the park"" I couldn't stand to listen to him because I knew what he was going to say. It's funny that the only group that has fought back against victim blaming has been feminist with rape and rightfully so. But the same applies to every crime and I truly believe that he thought people were responsible for being robbed and mugged."

This doesn't mean much, but from my own life an experience, everyone I know who has a college degree has no problem finding a GOOD job here (like, $60k/year plus amazing benefits good) and all of the friends and people I know without college degrees are the ones bouncing from PT job to PT job."

Also the nepotism in the city and the independent agencies like JEA, JTA, etc is rampant and will drive you mad when they hire and/or promote a family member over a more qualified person.

That policy is killing the students figuratively and sometimes literally at most of the north and west side schools.   I've had to deal with 4 gun related incidents at bus stops since Christmas, most, if not always, involving parents in the incident.  I cannot stand the people in these areas, they are part of a reciprocating unnecessary burden on our society. They are a plague that distracts us from the people who deserve attention.

jacksonville,35we3p,rohicks,1 point,Thu May 14 15:55:25 2015 UTC,Tint Specialist  I got it done 4.5 years ago there and it still looks brand new. Ignore the guy with the 1 star review as he has 10 one star reviews out of his 15 total on yelp. My mini is in the picture if you need a reference to how it looks like. Metallic on the sunroof and 18% all around for like 180 at the time.

I used to drink Adnams in the UK, it was my local brewery, this is their main seller. Could you recommend something based upon the descriptions of what they make? Hell, maybe I can get some shipped over here.  I only seem to be able to find dirty pilsner or IPA. At seven bridges they make one type of beer that could be compared to, or may well be a form of ale, but it tastes like someone could make better at home. (An ex gf's father would brew a surprisingly good beer at home.)  Perhaps I'm a bit snobbish in my ale ways, I've just simply found I've been drinking Strongbow Cider as opposed to anything I can find over here."

Hell, if I ever manage to source some Adnams or 6X over here, I'll drop you a couple of bottles off if you like.   I can really see you guys are starting to make a big deal about these craft beers, and it's great to not be forced to drink uh, what you guys would call domestic beers as they truly are awful.  I have subscribed to that sub and I'll be sure to continue to explore the world of American beer."
jacksonville,35ukhd,beaker_meep_,2,Wed May 13 19:09:25 2015 UTC,"I don't think you should hire someone. Look on craigslist for the beach area. Do you have time to come scout a few places out? It would definitely help as the nicer places are usually only listed for a few days before someone snatches them up. 900-1200 is totally doable, you could even end up 2-3 blocks from the beach for that price. If you find a place feel free to reply to me and i can tell you if it's in a nice area. There are a few areas at the beach you wouldn't really want to live."

jacksonville,35ukhd,beaker_meep_,2,Thu May 14 17:18:35 2015 UTC,"The beaches are nice, but they are also expensive. Ponte Vedra is one of the more expensive areas in town. With your budget, im sure you could find a nice apartment at the beaches but I would suggest that you open up your horizons a bit more and look at other areas. You could certainly get more bang for your buck elsewhere. The beach in never more than a short drive away no matter where you wind up in town! If you have any questions, let me know.

A lot of the ones in Mint and Money Pages have bad reputations if you dig deeper, and anyone who uses 'certified arborist' as a claim to fame is reaching for straws. All tree services know which trees they are cutting. you don't need to know the name of all the different species of flowers and bushes to cut down a tree. Just saying, if they are in mint magazine offering to hang up your lawn ornaments or trim your hedges, then they aren't very busy, and probably for a good reason."

Infinite Updates - There's probably an industry term that's more like 'Always Up-to-Date'.  The video was OK. Your value proposition needs to appeal to property management providers completely. They're the ones with the checkbooks. I know it's early in launch, but you need statistics about how much you can increase retention, lower costs, and improve service. If you retain 1 extra customer using this, it seems like it will pay for the software's subscription for a few months.  Screenshots - Very hard to navigate. The little circles on the laptop weren't obvious at first run.  There's some interesting things going on in Jacksonville too with entrepreneurs - JaxCOE is looking pretty good, bringing Angels into town."

jacksonville,35ie1k,houseinpa,16,Sun May 10 21:56:37 2015 UTC,"If you're into tech, you shouldn't have much issue finding work here. Get ready for everyone to look at you like you're insane when winter comes and you're still in shorts and T-shirts.  The bugs here are the size of small rodents. It's nothing like in Michigan where you get a good freeze and kill everything off, we get lucky with maybe a slight freeze to take out some of the mosquitos, but it's never enough. Oh yeah, and giant fucking roaches that fly.  I'm a transplant as well, but from under the bridge. We've got good beer here, there's some  good local food joints about, but it's all over town and the beaches. You don't  get a nice little town like A2 where everything is walkable and bike friendly.  Kiss the green goodbye (along with the orange and yellows of fall). While there are some spots that have old growth, most of the trees in this city are twigs. It's the side effect of newer development I guess, also the lack of give a shit about nature. Maybe that's just the Michigander in me talking...  If you're looking for parts of town to live in, I highly recommend moving out towards the beaches. Even if not at the beaches, check out intercoastal west. I'd also recommend landing at an apartment complex and getting a feel for the city before buying anything here (not to mention the market is still a bit dry and if it's a good find it will have an offer by the end of the day it's listed). The only reason I'm recommending the beaches over riverside is that if you're moving from the UP, there's no better way to piss off all your friends in the winter than sending them pics of chilling on the beach in October and complaining about how you have to ride 10 blocks to get there. Otherwise if you guys are without kids I'd recommend checking out riverside (one of the more walkable parts of town).   Oh yeah, I forgot to mention, you're going to have to get used to driving to everything for the most part."

Someone else mentioned Arlington, which is where I live. Yes it's safe-ish and close to downtown and easy to get anywhere else from there. Plenty of grocery stores, banking, a good library and traffic is not bad.   On the downside, it's a cultural wasteland - very few good places to eat and nothing nice, or hip or cool or interesting. The only sports bar (has ""wing"" in the name) has no personality, mediocre food, absolutely zero wow.   The other bars there are dull, uninteresting and have zero character. With the exception of a Middle Eastern restaurant and a Bono's BBQ, most of the rest of the local (non-chain) places to eat in Arlington completely suck.   We've gotten used to having to drive 15 minutes to get anywhere good to eat. Honestly, I hate living in Arlington. It's one of the most boring, unstimulating and lifeless places I've ever lived."

I've been in Florida for 10 years and Jacksonville for 9 years.   do not call carbonated soft drinks ""pop"". thems fightin' words round here. ""you aint felt cold till you felt ""wet"" cold"". I shit you not, people born down here have no concept of the kind of cold that can fucking kill you that exists for months up there. there are people who think 38 and rainy is worse than -15. love bugs. harmless flies that appear twice a year and float around mating. the beat-necks will try to tell you they were an experiment by the university of Florida that got out of control. its just a fly that lays its eggs on dead vegetation.  ""you aint seent bugs till you move to Florida."" not true. you'll find the same amount of insects here as you would anywhere else east of the Mississippi. there aren't any black flies here, and you wont see mosquitoes like you do in the UP.  the heat. if you hide in the A/C all day, you'll never acclimate to the long summers. there are so many people here that go 10+ years living less than 20 miles from the ocean without going to the beach. my inner Midwesterner still wants to slap those people. just get out there and embrace the heat.  traffic. the reason driving down here is a mess is due to a population made up of transplants from all over the world. Jacksonville has a diverse population with many different driving etiquettes clashing together.   7.beer. Florida is going trough its craft brewery growth spurt. it has gone to their heads a bit. there are some fantastic breweries right here in jacksonville, (aardwolf, intuition, veterans united) to name a few. however with more than twice the amount of people, we still have half as many breweries as Michigan. the battle against the baptists and ""Big Beer"" is real here. but you'll enjoy the scene if youre into that sort of thing.   lastly, here are some things to read up on before you move. boiled peanuts, corn nuggets, salt life, casual racism, ""the west side"", ""the north side"", southern baptists, palmetto bug, taco lu."

It doesn't free you from the consequences of abusing free speech. It doesn't protect you from criticism from private citizens (which, incidentally, also falls under the first amendment: why do you think that ""fags burn in hell"" would be protected but ""shut the fuck up"" wouldn't?)

No matter what part of town I've been in, I've never taken it upon myself to assume that the average Joe walking down the street was a criminal or thug. I encourage you to do the same. Not everyone in this city has the same opportunity as everyone else. Let's not make it worse by labeling each other based on the part of town they live in."

jacksonville,35b070,NoAbbreviation,1 point,Fri May 8 16:30:36 2015 UTC,"Just Copy-Pasted the Article here:  When making a decision on a candidate for public office, previous experience ought to be considered first. Has the candidate ever served well in public office? Has the candidate been a leader elsewhere in the community?  Experience is especially important in the at-large races for City Council.  AT-LARGE, GROUP 1: ANNA BROSCHE  Kimberly Daniels’ first term in office has been the most disappointing among the 19 members. Her achievements are not impressive.  In contrast, Anna Brosche is one of the most impressive candidates this editorial board has interviewed. She is a CPA with business experience, is chair of the United Way board and has outstanding communications skills.  There is no greater gap between candidates in this election than this one.  Jacksonville needs Brosche in office.  AT-LARGE, GROUP 3: TOMMY HAZOURI  So long as more than half the City Council turns over during each election, a distressing local tradition, it is important that some of the new members have government experience. Consolidated government is rare and complicated. The learning curve is huge.  Tommy Hazouri would bring an unmatched resume of experience, having served in the Florida Legislature, as mayor and as a member of the Duval County School Board.  He showed during his time on the School Board that he was perfectly capable of serving in a collegial role.  Geoff Youngblood appears to be a sharp businessman, but this would be his first elective job.  There is no comparison to Hazouri’s experience.  AT-LARGE, GROUP 5: JU’COBY PITTMAN  City Council could use a long-time leader in the nonprofit community with an up-close and personal connection with Jacksonville’s less fortunate people.  Ju’Coby Pittman would provide that valuable connection to the real life struggles of people on the streets through her role as the successful CEO of the Clara White Mission.  Her opponent, Samuel Newby, has been active with the YMCA in Northwest Jacksonville.  But the choice here is clear — Pittman.  DISTRICT 1: JOYCE MORGAN  Two candidates who appear to be evenly matched on the qualifications front are competing for a critical district seat in Arlington.  Arlington has a deserved reputation for civic activity. And as it transitions to a more urban neighborhood, there are serious issues to be addressed.  The question is which one has the best ability to take a leadership role here.  In her questionnaire and during an interview, Joyce Morgan showed common sense, an ability to deal with several sides of an issue, an open mind and a willingness to seek more information.  It’s rare to find candidates who admit they don’t have all the answers — but who also vow to make an effort to find them.  Morgan gets the nod over Mike Anania.  DISTRICT 2: LISA KING  As one of the more impressive candidates interviewed by the Times-Union, Lisa King brings a variety of experience.  She is a Jacksonville native, a small business leader, helped to save the ferry and has the valuable experience of serving on the Planning Commission. There is no better training for City Council than serving on the commission where members learn how to deal with open government rules and all the complications involved in zoning issues.  King’s district includes some of the fastest growing areas on the Northside. Thus, her planning experience would be invaluable. Her responses during the editorial board’s interview showed a depth and a maturity that is rare for a candidate.  Al Ferraro, her opponent, showed little interest in communicating with the Times-Union.  DISTRICT 4: SCOTT WILSON  This is a tight race between two candidates who are both highly qualified.  Ramon Day has impressive experience in government, including as chief of staff to U.S. Rep. Charles Bennett. He also shows a command of major issues. Unfortunately, most of his major experience dates back several decades.  Scott Wilson, in contrast, has been one of the most active and visible aides on City Council. He has been involved in issues involving the Southside district of his boss, Don Redman. However, Wilson, does not have the same close-minded views on social issues as Redman.  It is safe to say that voters would be well served by either candidate. At the end of the day, we give the nod to Wilson.  DISTRICT 7: GEORGE SPENCER  This core city district includes Springfield and Talleyrand areas. As George Spencer has said, this district has been ignored for too long.  Spencer appears to have the will, energy and commitment to help advocate for his constituents.  Spencer has backgrounds as both a CPA and lawyer, which is rare. His finance and legal expertise would be valuable on City Council, especially in this era of fiscal crises.  His opponent, Reggie Gaffney, has a record as chairman of the Jacksonville Port Authority. And Gaffney also founded the Community Rehabilitation Center.  However, Spencer’s qualifications and communications ability sets him apart.  DISTRICT 8: NO ENDORSEMENT  The Times-Union editorial board tries its best to pick a candidate in every race. We realize that voters must make a choice.  However, the best candidate in this Northwest district, Lynn Sherman, did not make the runoff.  Of the remaining two candidates, one did not have an impressive record during a previous term on City Council (Pat Lockett-Felder) — while the other has no previous public activity of note (Katrina Brown)."

It's BS.  Ref. 2 is a bit more benign, it just states that the mayor has to appoint two key fiscal officers and directors to the departments within 60 days of getting the job (and assuming the job is vacant) instead of dragging his feet. It's a bit unnecessary but more of a formality."

If ref 1 passes, and the mayor does something the council doesn't like. They can punish him by removing his general council.   Ref. 2 to me doesn't have any practicality. But it does prevent a budget nightmare I guess. However, if council holds appointments up, they can then punish the mayor somehow? I dunno. It's a bit vague."

jacksonville,3534il,kc102,2,Thu May 7 01:22:45 2015 UTC,"Well, taken in larger context, Ref 1 has a bit more back-stabby side to it. Mayor Brown is having GC review human rights and non-descrimination guidelines and procedures throughout town hall. And this is seen by some as a potential stick to beat GC with if they find something that the city council doesn't like. So yeah. I'm going no on both. There's really no need for either of them."

Either way, very accepting of people of all backgrounds. I have yet to check it out because I just moved to this area recently. I'm also 23 (seriously, is everyone on Reddit just a bunch of 23-year-olds?), considering getting more involved with a church. I'm not going to trash other churches listed, please go check them out and see if they're right for you, we're all different. I'm just going to share an article I just read today that I thought did good job of articulating my opinion on many of the nondenominational churches I've tried attending in the past.   http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/jesus-doesnt-tweet/2015/04/30/fb07ef1a-ed01-11e4-8666-a1d756d0218e_story.html?tid=pm_pop_b  Wanted to add- I'm Lutheran and have been attracted to the very tolerant nature of the religion.

For a guaranteed sighting drive down to Salt Springs (closer than Silver Springs) just south of Palatka. It takes about an hour and a half travel. They have a recreation area and you can spot them from shore.  The water is crystal clear.  If you want a closer experience, you can also rent a canoe."

They might be around, but not in any real concentrations. As others have said, the springs in NE FL are a popular spot for them in winter, and spring-fed rivers tend to be good spots to catch them all year, though it's not a sure thing. I've seen them at random about 4 times in my life, though admittedly having never actively sought them out having grown up on the creeks, rivers, and springs of Florida. If you want to see them spend more time on the water."

jacksonville,34leyi,dezmd,5,Sat May 2 12:37:57 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure what the 'new subdivision' you are referring too is the toll road access point that the FL legislature and Rick Scott has f''ed us into on 295. Adding a 'fast lane' toll to the road.  Despite Jacksonville's explicit abhorrence to tolls (and the fact that we originally raised the sales tax to 7% from 6.5 to pay for the roads that the tolls were supposed to pay for, and then made some nonsense up to continue paying it even though it was supposed to expire)."

Some things to consider before a long trip:  How's it running right now and what's it's maintenance history been like? Mileage? Before a long trip I'd give a good hard look at the cooling system (IIRC Magnas are liquid cooled right?) and get it flushed if it hasn't been done in a while. Same goes for the starter and battery if they're of any serious age. Worn brushes in a starter can leave you stuck and a battery more than a year old for a long trip might give up the ghost when you least want it to. Bump starts are at least an option there. Getting the valves' clearance tuned up and a carb rebuild if it's not running immaculately wouldn't be an aweful idea, as might new tires and chain if your bike has one (forget it magnas are shaft or not). A compression check to see if your cylinders are in good shape isn't a bad idea either."
jacksonville,34jyrv,carpespasm,1 point,Fri May 1 23:48:01 2015 UTC,"New tires just put on, it runs great, I'll probably get the new battery. Only issue is loose valves, but after riding for more the 20 minutes they seem to readjusted. Compression check is definitely one to consider."

The best bands I've ever seen in jax have been there or freebird, maybe veterans memorial if you count the big bands. Jack rabbits is probably my favorite venue in town.

jacksonville,34gras,Robert_Arctor,0,Fri May 1 15:15:53 2015 UTC,"Ticket prices are unusually high for local/small acts, payout is unusually low, it's much harder to get people to turn up to JackRabbits than it is to UB or Burro. Beer is too expensive.  The sound is great, and I've seen plenty of good shows there. However, there are better places for you to schedule your show."
jacksonville,34gras,Johnnyliar11,2,Fri May 1 15:50:19 2015 UTC,Not mavericks. Too much cigarette smoke and acoustics/sound is crap. I recommend maybe Jack Rabbits or Freebird Live or a coffee shop? It all depends on what she's lookin for.
jacksonville,34gras,permawingman,2,Fri May 1 01:58:21 2015 UTC,I completely agree with both Jack Rabbits and Freebird Live. I'd say it depends on how big of a following your friend has. Jack Rabbits is smaller and more intimate.

jacksonville,34a5d6,lightningusagi,11,Wed Apr 29 14:52:35 2015 UTC,"I was referred to him when my daughter was about 2 because our regular dentist didn't work on young children. We had nothing but issues. He's been in practice for years, and you can tell he just doesn't care or have the patience anymore. They also overbooked like nothing I'd ever seen. I never waited less than an hour for an appointment, and one day when we had a Saturday appointment, no one showed up to the office at all.  The first appointment we had for the exam went well, but she had a cavity and they had us make a new appointment to fill it. She came back, and they insisted on having her use gas. I wasn't totally comfortable with it, but they said it would make the procedure more comfortable for her. Everything went just fine, but after they finished and turned off the gas, my daughter started crying because she felt so weird.   She had other cavities that they had to work on, and despite us asking them not to use gas, they would still do it. My daughter was never afraid of dental procedures and wasn't fussing like other kids (every time we went in, there were kids screaming in the exam rooms). We had to have the same cavity filled 3 times because the filling kept coming out. Each time he'd blame it on something other than his own work. After the 3rd time, I asked around at work and found another dentist (that we love). They had to refill all of the cavities that he had done, and replace a crown that was too big for her tooth.   I realize it takes a special person to work with children in a field that they're so scared of, but he is not that person anymore. He stopped loving his job years ago and it shows."

jacksonville,345ppq,lookatthemonkeys,2,Tue Apr 28 14:46:19 2015 UTC,"Everyone is forgetting the big thing here, where the hell is the money coming from? Don't you think Khan is going to build this thing on his own dime. They want a large chunk of money from the city. Funny how they can't agree on a funding source to fund the pension and to put back the money the city stole, but this comes along and I bet they are all going to be willing to raise taxes all of a sudden.   Also, the city says the 30 year pension deal is illegal, that means the city owes back the 100 million dollars the fund gave the city as part of the deal on top of the money they owe back I to the city.   Oh yeah, and the cities infrastructure is falling apart, the city wants to dredge the river, and they need to improve the river instead of buying credits from JEA.   Funny how they can't say where the money for all that stuff is coming from but magically they will have money for this. I am all for doing something with the ship yards, but the city has better things to spend it's money on."
jacksonville,345ppq,lookatthemonkeys,9,Tue Apr 28 16:37:42 2015 UTC,"You have addressed multiple separate financial issues here but I'll answer the Shipyards issue to the best of my knowledge.   In the proposed deal the city will give up ownership of the Shipyards to Khan's investment company for $0. The city will also agree to fund cleaning up the shipyards and improving the infrastructure in the area of the shipyards, for a maximum of $35M. The actually estimates of cost are much lower than that but the max cost is $35M.   Khan's company will be funding the cost of construction and development of the property, estimated to be from $500M - $650M. Khan's company will also be giving the city a percentage of future revenue generated, estimated to be around $120M over 10 years (I think, might have been 20 years).  So, essentially, the city is giving up $35M + the estimated value of the shipyards as it is now for future gains of $120M+ over the next 10-20 years. Khan is funding the development and thus keeping the majority of the profit as well, as he should.   Unless I'm wrong somewhere I don't see where this is a bad deal for the city.   Basically, figure out where to get money from because this is a money making deal and will draw more people into Jacksonville in the long run. This is something that needs to be done."
jacksonville,345ppq,bhasden,2,Tue Apr 28 18:53:46 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the input! I totally agree with you that something needs to be done with the shipyards, it's been sitting there the same way since I moved hear over a decade ago. The problem is the city doesn't have the money to be wasting on projects like this, even if it is a good investment. You say it's only $35 million like it's not a lot of money. I'm sure it is a good investment, but I was sitting in the last years city council budget meeting where they are trying to scrounge together pennies to fund essential city services.   We still have restricted library hours, way under funding of essential infrastructure, our schools our some of the worst in the state with libraries essentially being closed in a majority of the schools. We need to fix the river, dredge the river, hire more police officers, appropriately fund the pension, etc, etc.... But somehow we are going to have money to build this. And also, that $35 million is just a starting point. It could easily end up like the court house.   The city has the same property tax rates as it did decades ago in the 80 and 90s.  That's fine if that is what you want, but this city is not the same city as it was 2 or 3 decades ago and we should have a tax rate that can appropriately fund all this stuff."
jacksonville,345ppq,I_hate_fountainhead,2,Tue Apr 28 20:18:39 2015 UTC,"The whole reason that the deal can be cancelled if the cleanup costs more than $35 million is so that the bill doesn't run up like it did with the court house. Although I agree with most of the points you made, making ~300% on an investment is how the city can help resolve those issues. Sacrificing the long term in order to patch something in the short term is how the city ended up in this mess to begin with.   I definitely agree that the property taxes should go up. As a homeowner, I'd rather kids be better educated than have uneducated minors on the street with nothing to do (among the other things that property taxes funds)."
jacksonville,345ppq,ChkYrHead,2,Tue Apr 28 20:59:32 2015 UTC,"As an environmental liability, the city would be stuck for the $35 mil anyhow. and I'm sure it will be a bartering point in the negotiations."

jacksonville,345ppq,shoreparty,7,Tue Apr 28 20:22:47 2015 UTC,"This solution is practical. This will create retail space for people to actually shop, leisure and necessity, something that doesn't currently exist there. This would make places for people to live to entice people to move downtown and places for them to work. The largest portion of this plan is slated for entertainment and entertainment = fun. Sure, it's not an aquarium (like we already don't have enough of those around) or a giant ferris wheel but it's a very large space dedicated to all types of all purpose entertainment, I'm sure there are loads of possibilities that could happen from that space."
jacksonville,345ppq,apcolleen,1 point,Tue Apr 28 18:58:47 2015 UTC,"I guess my problem is the entertainment area is so ambiguous that without a certain direction it'll end up barren and unused.  I remember seeing an ampitheater in one of the drafts, and once thing we actually don't need in the area is more performance space (Met Park, Fl Theater, Moran Theater, Vet's Arena, and Everbank Field all in one small area already).  Is there anything else planned for this entertainment area other than a naval museum? Are they reserving space to lease to a third party to bring in a larger, greater idea to actually bring people from other parts of town to the downtown bubble?  Yes, as I see it there's value in adding some nice retail, living, and working space to downtown, no-one can argue that. I just don't think that it would be the best use of space to place it there. Then again, there's a jail a couple blocks away from the river, so Jax really doesn't have a great history on using available space wisely."
jacksonville,345ppq,shoreparty,5,Tue Apr 28 20:30:58 2015 UTC,I think an amphitheater would be awesome. Jacksonville doesn't currently have a mid sized outdoors performance center. Most mid tier acts go and play at the St. Augustine amphitheater. Build one in the shipyards and you have an instant entertainment draw.

Seriously, if there's something on the panel you can grab go ahead and give it a strong pull. If it starts to come loose its probably a skimmer!  Seriously, credit card terminals of all kinds are made in such a way as to be difficult to tamper with. This means they almost always have a very strong construction with thick plastic and screws... If there's glue it will be in addition to the screws.  So pull on that front panel! It should feel strong and solid. If it gives way at all notify the business owner and they'll be able to confirm or fix the loose panel :)  No, you shouldn't be able to pull the front panel off of a gas station pump with your bare hands unless you're The Hulk."

jacksonville,33p7z7,sh1ttydefaults,6,Sat Apr 25 02:49:19 2015 UTC,I read the article yesterday. It appears the technology has a  advanced and the skimmers are now mounted inside.
jacksonville,33p7z7,youarecaught,1 point,Fri Apr 24 12:00:55 2015 UTC,Apparently they have somewhat universal keys to open the pumps and can add them inside.
jacksonville,33p7z7,apcolleen,4,Sun Apr 26 21:41:57 2015 UTC,"Banker here. Any swiper, be it on a gas pump or an ATM, should feel like it is cemented to the machine. If it jiggles or moves even a little, don't use it. A few more tips: If the display screen is telling you something weird, don't use the machine.(Sometimes this is the case with inside skimmers) Don't let employees where you're purchasing something take your card out of your sight to swipe it. Pay an alternate way or walk away. If the cashier says your first swipe ""didn't take', make sure you check the screen to see your card has not registered. Better yet, pay an alternate way or not at all- I got my own account breached with the ""second swipe "" scam and I WORK at a credit union. And for the love of everything holy, do not use those  ATMs in convenience stores. They are little nests of fraud."
jacksonville,33p7z7,ctnomom,1 point,Fri Apr 24 19:18:48 2015 UTC,"These were inside the machines, not the outside cover skimmers that are normal. As I understand it, these would be basically impossible to detect from the outside."

jacksonville,33p7z7,ctnomom,3,Sun Apr 26 23:04:49 2015 UTC,There are much more than 3 in Jax. That is just how many were found in that one search. We find them weekly. The scary thing is the newer skimmer get installed inside the gas pump machine so you can't see or tell anything at all.   Hopefully chip and pin or NFC payments will come soon.
jacksonville,33p7z7,lookatthemonkeys,1 point,Fri Apr 24 22:44:10 2015 UTC,"Chip, pin and NFC will do nothing to stop internally mounted skimmers.   What they need is to incorporate better encryption."
jacksonville,33p7z7,youarecaught,2,Sat Apr 25 14:03:00 2015 UTC,"Your statement doesn't make sense. Of course both of those would stop skimmers. Both of those technology up encryption. Your card number has zero encryption now, that's why it is so easy to skim.   Chip and pin, the data is on the chip, which a skimmer can't read. Even if they did read it, it is encrypted. NFC, same thing. Also NFC you need a pin on your phone so unless they can see your phone screen, or some phones use fingerprint verification.   Chip and pin or NFC are the answer. We know this because Europe had *massive * card fraud like we did but they switched over years ago and the problem virtually vanished."
jacksonville,33p7z7,lookatthemonkeys,2,Sat Apr 25 16:05:48 2015 UTC,this makes me feel 100x better about insisting that i go inside to pay with my debit card. I also only use presto atms because they are free for me and they changed the part where you enter your card so skimmers cant be attached

Having worked for and around these types of folks a bit over the years, yacht/country/golf clubs seem to be their main social staples and if you bother to look at the cost of whatever place you're at, or aren't instantly mortified by your bill you're probably not where those sorts of people are."

We have billionaires and many millionaires that live in Jacksonville with the majority of them bearing the ponte vedra club and inn stickers on the back of their cars so I would assume most of what they do is in the ponte vedra area or travel some where for what ever on their private jets out of signature or sheltair like you said. Not many own their own jets, mostly do the fractional private jet thing. The White Oak Plantation which is owned by the owner of the LA Dodgers seems to be a hot spot for the elite."

jacksonville,33gwyq,bwaters777,2,Wed Apr 22 14:11:19 2015 UTC,"My husband was at Mayport and is now at NAS Jax (hooray, more moving). You don't want to live right off the base, but the beaches area is fine if you're into being able to walk to the beach. We have friends that enjoy a lot of nightlife and they just bought a house a few blocks from the beach. You'll definitely pay more for less though due to location.  Kernan Blvd and Hodges Blvd and houses off of those are popular choices too. I wouldn't say they're good for people who want city life though, it's mostly suburbia with a lot of military and kids. I live near Monument Rd and it's... okay. If we had stayed at Mayport we probably would have looked at Kernan/Hodges because we're not exciting people.  If you want to be able to easily get to NAS Jax, you'll want to be close to 295 or 202 (Butler).   A lot of people seem to hate Mayport but we were hoping to stay there. There isn't a ton of traffic and it's easy to get to without dealing with 295 or Butler, where there are accidents seemingly multiple times a day. If you enjoy city life though, I think the beaches would be the best bet for you (or Riverside - but that's pretty far off).   Are you moving for the FRS, by any chance?

jacksonville,33cfj9,bongozap,11,Tue Apr 21 14:01:34 2015 UTC,And he got it for a hell of a deal.   He bought it from Jacksonville for 5 million. Jawboned the city out of paying rent for the land over lack of parking. Got the city to kick in over 3 million for him to purchase parking for the venue. Did nothing to improve the site so he could whine to the city about how it's all the city's fault and get them to kick in more money. Got in bed with contractors to lobby the city council and the mayor for stupid development projects including demolishing the landing in favor of residential rentals no one wants. And his projects will essentially cut off public access to the North Bank.   The guy is a hated and legendary commercial property slumlord who weaseled his way into deep pockets managed by dumbasses.  He's entirely lacking in vision and taste.
jacksonville,33cfj9,elendryst,10,Tue Apr 21 14:44:59 2015 UTC,This is his Modus operandi.

If I remember correctly I'm pretty sure the Department asked for 150million to fix roads and infrastructure last year and the city gave them 7 million. If the city want to play games and keep taxes low they are going to have to make serious concessions including infrastructure and other major departments like parks and libraries. I'm all for having low taxes, but you need to tax at a level that you can maintain the basic needs of the city. That's why I have little hope for the city anytime soon as no one has a serious plan for the city other than waiting it out and kicking problems down the road."

jacksonville,32pu44,seanconnerysbeard,4,Thu Apr 16 04:14:38 2015 UTC,"It's not that they are broke. The city decided it wants to keep taxes at the levels it was 10 - 20 years ago. That is fine if you want to spend and be the same city as they were 20 years ago, but we are not. Jacksonville has some of the lowest property taxes of a city this size in the state. That is all fine and dandy but you can't have your cake and eat it too. Added to this that the city hadn't been funding the 2 main pension systems (police and fire (1) and Jax general pension (2)) appropriately for years and when the markets crashed the city wasn't prepared and now owes tons of money to both pension systems. The city has tons of money, but since they don't want to raise taxes, or invest the money they do have appropriately tons of things are getting left behind, like infrastructure."

jacksonville,32pu44,SemenShooter,0,Thu Apr 16 02:56:27 2015 UTC,"I am a member of the cities pension system so I am quite aware of all these things. While pensions don't need to be funded fully (see Rick. And the FSR) the pensions in Jacksonville are getting close to 50% unfunded liability, which is a big problem. Also instead of putting more money into the system that they took out of the pension a decade ago they want to solve the problems by slashing benefits for current employees."
jacksonville,32pu44,lookatthemonkeys,3,Thu Apr 16 03:47:35 2015 UTC,"If you're a pension member then you should know that unfunded liability is a make believe number that was invented essentially to demonize the pensions. The way they calculate unfunded liability is they take the number of employees (both retired and working, even if they've only been on the job a month) and calculate how much money would be needed to pay everyone if they all retired today, without hiring anybody else, and they all received their maximum retirement benefit. The reason that number is so high is because that is an impossible scenario. For starters a one month employee isn't vested and would receive nothing if he quit after only a month. They're adding burden to the pension system in their make believe scenario that cannot exist. Unfunded liability is a scenario that cannot be achieved, and as such is a term and an idea that needs to be educated against.  Another way to put that into perspective that I think helps educate people about way unfunded liability is home ownership. Say you buy a home, 30 year mortgage. You pay on your home for 30 years and you then own it and can enjoy it for the rest of your life. What would happen if you made two payments and decided you weren't going to pay on your home any more? In our unfunded liability scenario the bank would just say ""oh well"" and hand you the title, allowing you to live the rest of your life in a home you didn't earn. Most people say that's a silly analogy, because the bank would never let someone keep a home they didn't pay for. That's precisely the point, the city doesn't give people full retirement benefits after 30 days of service. Again in our unfunded liability scenario that is exactly what they do to cone up with those numbers. The number is a fantasy, it is the equivalent of walking into a Kia dealership and them giving you a rolls Royce for the same price."
jacksonville,32pu44,SemenShooter,3,Thu Apr 16 10:30:26 2015 UTC,This is the most interesting thing I have read about the pension debate and exactly why I wanted to contribute to this sub.  All too often we take the argument provided at face value. I would love to dig in to the pension with the perspective you provided here.
jacksonville,32pu44,lookatthemonkeys,0,Thu Apr 16 16:12:01 2015 UTC,"First of all, thank you for being educated on this topic as many of this cities problems are that the citizens are not educated enough about important topics to know what is or isn't important.   Secondly, I am not disagreeing with anything you are saying, what you say is true, but that doesn't mean the unfunded liability isn't an important number to look at. You are right, pensions do not need to be funded anywhere near 100%  in fact, most studies say 70 % is a decent threshold for a healthy funded pension. But politicians like to through the unfunded liability is people's faces to help demonize pensions. Look at the USPS (postal service)  for example, where the GOP passed a bill saying their pension must must be funded at 100% and are now demonizing the USPS because they have now waste a bunch of money funding the pension to un realistic levels.   Next, let's look at Jacksonville. Again, you are right, the unfunded liability is a made up number that isn't as important as people say it is. But, at the same time it can't be too low. You are exaggerating the effects too much what if it was only 10% funded? Obviously we would all say that is too low. But the important thing is we want to look at the unfunded liability rates over time. You want that number to gradually rise. Yes, because of economic uncertainties, it might fluctuate, but if you look at the long term the perchance should gradually go up, but that isn't happening in Jacksonville. We went from over 90% unfunded liability to close to 50 % . Yes, some of this is from the stock market crashing, but much of it is not. The reason is because 1) the city took large sums of money out of the pension fund to help pad the cities general fund when times were tough and they did not want to raise taxes 2) the city used the double digit pensions return investments to pay their pension payments. That is like using your rewards points to pay your minimum payment. Yes, it might work once or twice but you can't sustain like that. 3)  the city has yet to pay back the money it took from the fund, so now that the market crashed, the city has no buffer to help pay the payments, and the minimum payment for the city ballooned out of control.   Now the city wants to cry foul and place the burden on the member of the fund. The thing is, the member of the fund don't have a choice whether we pay into the pension or not, it comes right out of our checks. The city is the only that is able to play games with their payments and then cry foul when they owe money. Look at New Jersey where Chris Christi is flat out refusing to make pension payments because he doesn't want to spent the money.   There is only one way to fix the pension in Jacksonville, add more money I to the pension due to the fact that the city borrow from the pension all those years ago and never paid it back. That is the only way. And the only real way to do that is 1)  make massive cuts elsewhere in the city 2) raise taxes to pay for it 3) just ignore it.   The city has been just ignoring it for years and letting it get out of control and now they point at the cities workers and blame them for the problem saying our benefits are too luxurious, which is reality reports show our pensions benefits, on average, are lower than most cities in Florida.   I could type about this all day, but I am more than happy to answer, or meet up with any questions anyone has. Or is you want come do a ride along with me and we can talk about pension all night."

Most ""creators"" I talked to were either trying to sell me a service or had a business already and were just trying to get their name out there. Felt like anybody could be a creator this year with no oversight.  If they do not do something about this I can see next year just being a street festival with them having lost focus on their original mission. That being said, I did really enjoy the festival atmosphere downtown and would go just for that."
jacksonville,32fh07,regnide,5,Mon Apr 13 15:42:54 2015 UTC,"I kinda agree. It was fun, but lost a lot of the small time (sometimes kooky & weird) startup vibe. A lot of stuff there were already established businesses already manufacturing & selling their service/product.  That shouldn't be allowed. Like at all. I saw an electric bike company on the riverwalk near the landing that were already well into production, selling their bikes at like $2k a pop. WTF?"

jacksonville,32fh07,bongozap,2,Mon Apr 13 20:26:25 2015 UTC,"I would like to see them add a new, non vote getting category just for vendors. Currently the creators are not allowed to sell directly to festival attendees. Having a limited vendor group would help reduce the problem you stated and add a new dimension to the festival. If they want to keep it all tied in to the original idea then limit the vendors to those who have already been creators in previous years."

But when advertised as a treatment option by ""Yoga Therapist"" who paid a couple hundred dollars for a yoga certification is scary. I've been a clinical psychologist for 27 years. I say the same things about Life Coaches. Unregulated and inadequately trained. A work around getting formal training as a psychotherapst. A bit naive to think people are that simple."

No one there is going to want to listen to your kid wailing it's lungs out, because it's grumpy/ pissed off/ pissed on/ hungry/ barfing or whatever.   Concerts are loud indoors or out. Loud constant noise is not something babies handle well at all.  Everyone at that concert deserves to enjoy it as much as you, but if you ruined their night out by bringing a fucking baby, are you going to make up for it? You going to buy them tickets for the next time? Haggle with their boss for time off? Pay for a hotel?  If you couldn't afford the sitter and the concert tickets maybe you should skip the entire thing. The kid is an 18year commitment, time to start owning it and be a parent, that means sacrifices.  If that means cutting back elsewhere or not going at all.. that is what you have to do because you decided to have a baby. Time to start acting responsible."

jacksonville,32dqqi,madam_waggles,2,Sun Apr 12 23:58:21 2015 UTC,"Depends on what you're looking for...  Riverside / San Marco are the up and coming spots with a very unique vibe. They're more historic so some areas look sketchy, but they're safe. A good mix of hipsters & young professionals. Parking can be an issue depending on where you are. Both are very walkable.  Beaches are similar to above, but replace hipster and young professionals with beach rats and socialites. Parking can be an issue in the spring / summer. Surprisingly cheap, but walkable and unique in a good way.  South side, blah. It's the place that always gets recommended to people moving to Jax. It's typical, modern urban sprawl. There's plenty to do and lots of parking, but no real identity and walk-ability is terrible aside from the town center. It's cheap and new, but expect to drive a lot.   North side is similar to south side, but much less to do and much further from everything... Crime is becoming a problem here too.  Arlington, don't even bother. Dangerous neighborhoods, traffic, running down into the ground.  Orange park is South side with 10x the traffic. Blanding blvd and Roosevelt are nearly constant gridlock during the day.  Downtown is surprisingly safe and quiet. There's not a lot to do unless you like to explore/eat and drink, but it's slowly coming to life. Unless you're really adventurous or like living in a metro area I wouldn't recommend starting here. I live here, but I also work downtown and enjoy being part of the movement here."

jacksonville,32czzt,yinyin123,2,Sun Apr 12 23:46:22 2015 UTC,Up toward Talbot Island state park there's a nice ride-you have to do the road for some of it but there are views of the water to be had and nice long bridges with beautiful views.

It's got a couple of harder tracks, and they all connect to each other in some way. It's very nice, especially if you've got people that are gonna be just as fast and good as you. A lot of the trails are two-way, or people just don't read the trail instructions, though, so you might be finding company that either you or them will have to stop for."

jacksonville,32czzt,LovelyTurret,2,Sun Apr 12 23:45:41 2015 UTC,"Yeah, Kemo. Also, Hannah park is a little bit more than just bike trails. It's a campground, it's got a beach, and a huge kids playground, as well as a pedalboating lake. It's 5 dollars or so to get in, though."

That's another reason we're staying here.   Otherwise, you can go to middleburg. It's got country areas as well."

There is a huge (or used to be, I'm not country and don't like horses ;) ) equestrian center on the west side of Jax too.    Keep in mind this is the 3rd largest city land wise in the world, so when someone says something about Jax, you can go 20 minutes in another direction, not leave the city, and it be totally different. Something for everyone really :)"
jacksonville,32a6on,Dude1975,3,Sun Apr 12 03:17:09 2015 UTC,Jacksonville is a country city.  You will like it.  Whether its Mayport or NAS you can find what you want in commuting distance.

jacksonville,32a6on,sanitystinks,2,Sun Apr 12 05:38:56 2015 UTC,"Plenty of country, in fact if you head west of the Naval base around an hour or so you'll be in heaven. There is plenty of land to be had south and North of Jax as well.   Overall cost of living near Jax isn't bad, you'll find plenty of things to do (as long as it's before 10pm).  The bugs can be bad, depending on your proximity to the water. Also drainage can be a problem to consider.  The drawbacks that you will encounter are typically: the heat, commute times.  Having gone from Pittsburgh, PA to Jacksonviile, FL to Fairfax, VA, to San Antonio, TX, and finally to Seattle, WA, I would say that each has their own 'country' areas that do not feel like city at all."

jacksonville,32a6on,sappypappy,3,Sun Apr 12 01:23:57 2015 UTC,"You will find that there isn't much in the way of ""seasons"" in Jax. You'll get a couple weeks of what SEA would consider fall and the rest of the time it will be summer temps. In my experience the grass grows fast enough in the summer to require a cut once a week, sometimes twice.  As /u/ITtoMD wrote earlier you can easily get outside of the city feel and still be inside of the city limits. MacCleny and Middleburg are both pretty rural still.  The commute times and (comparatively) lack of public transportation makes commute times increase."

Depending on where you work, you could take the SkyWay over. There's a station literally across the street and it's free to ride. Also, if you take the Acosta home there's a secret road not many people know about to get back to Riverplace Blvd... If you turn left here, the road loops under the expressway and spits you out near MOSH it save you a lot of time / lights."
jacksonville,32aa60,birdablaze,1 point,Sun Apr 12 17:19:22 2015 UTC,Hope you don't mind me asking but how much is your rent there?
jacksonville,32aa60,JaxJaguar,1 point,Mon Apr 13 02:49:12 2015 UTC,"I'm in a 2/2 with a river view and it's $1530. When I signed they had a special for a free month so I spread it out to lower my monthly. The price includes water / waste and two parking spots.   Something to keep in mind about this place though is all of the amenities and activities that are free of charge. In the lobby there are: monthly happy hours (free beer and wine), 2 wine tastings every month, several local catered food vendors that rotate out each night (not free, but super deliciousness), pool team and book club, fitness classes, running groups, etc. The building owns a box at the suns stadium which you can get free access to (free beer, wine, hotdogs, etc), there's a steam room/sauna, jacuzzi, grills, pool, massage room. I mean I think you get the point by now.   Yes, it's a little pricey, but when you consider what all you're getting and how beautiful the view is it's unbeatable. In any other city you'd be paying twice as much easily.  The only real downside is the elevators can be slow sometimes, especially when people are moving. Also when some impatient jackass rams the garage door it takes at least 2 weeks to fix since they're custom made. Other than that though I don't have any complaints. It's quiet, safe, the staff / concierges are nice and maintenance is top notch."

My advice would be to look into getting a Gopher Tortoise instead. They are native to Florida and are not only a keystone species, but they are listed as endangered, so being a partner in protecting them is important. There are several organizations in Florida that rescue/rehabilitate them. To have one you must have a permit, which can be obtained by contacting the local FWCC office."
jacksonville,328xjn,BatesianMimicry,3,Sat Apr 11 21:15:33 2015 UTC,"Sulcatas are sold as pets, so OP is probably hoping to adopt one that an owner can't take proper care of anymore."

KFC is the absolute king of fried chicken in England, but here in the states, you have many contenders for that title (plus KFC here isn't as nice as it is in England... go figure?).  Guess what my favourite restaurant is here... Applebee's. I've been to Bonefish, that Italian place at the town centre, Roy's... but it's Applebee's that wins. They even let me put the fucking football on the TV!!!!!!  I've never been to a football game in the flesh, so in that regard you're more British than I, squire. But yes I can imagine Tottenham fans are rather pleasant... at times ;-)  I desperately want to go to an Ice Hockey game over here, now that's the only North American sport I feel I can truly appreciate. Stanley Cup soon too, so I can see myself going to Applebee's quite often. I think I'll root for Calgary."

A few years back I was looking at homes in Alabama, and found a house in a not so rural area. The area in question however, was still considered ""farm land"", and a USDA loan for said farm land actually had a way better percentage rate and loan amount cap than the VA could offer me. Not really a subdivision, but it was a street with average sized plots and houses on like 1/8 and 1/4 acre lots. Not exactly suited for plowing up fields; it's just that the particular cities zoning had never changed what the land was designated for."

jacksonville,322p6q,Robert_Arctor,2,Fri Apr 10 15:10:34 2015 UTC,"Yeah you have to apply and it's based on income/background I think.

jacksonville,322p6q,Robert_Arctor,1 point,Fri Apr 10 13:41:01 2015 UTC,"Yes its true. FHA has additional requirements for the sellers to ensure the loan is worth it for them.

jacksonville,322p6q,schneikeys2,1 point,Sat Apr 11 00:25:37 2015 UTC,"Basically, the state of Florida and a few others complicate the foreclosure process to the point where the legal team won't bother trying to get an extension. It's presumably to keep banks from predatory foreclosure, and I'm sure it does that, but it also means you have to get the sale closed by a quickly approaching date you can't extend."
jacksonville,322p6q,VioletVenom,1 point,Sat Apr 11 04:09:16 2015 UTC,"We went through the process last year and we're told that there were no ""first time homeowner"" programs. My biggest advice would be to scrape up as much money as you can for a downpayment. Might not be financially possible but will save you money in the long run in interest and insurance. A VA loan is good for those with no credit/downpayment, as it gets you into a home. With a VA or standard mortgage, when you put down less than 20% the bank is going to require mortgage insurance (PMI). Once you have enough equity and or higher appraisal, believe 20% again, in your home you can request the PMI be dropped from your mortgage.  Give a try over at /r/personalfinance they're a good resource. The HUD website has some good info too.   http://portal.hud.gov/hudportal/HUD?src=/topics/buying_a_home  Good luck!"

jacksonville,31vwnd,RevLoki,10,Wed Apr 8 15:58:33 2015 UTC,"To be fair, brah, if we dems don't get out and vote then we have no one to blame but ourselves.   Turnout was good, but still abysmal in the grand scheme of things. I  mean, of over half a million registered voters, only 33 percent turned out... and that's including early voting.  EDIT: I want to provide a little further analysis on this. Because it's really important in underscoring the issue. It's not just a voter gap, there is also a large demographic gap as well. African American voters, especially older ones, tend to be devoutly religious and against gay rights and progressive causes (outside of ""race relation-based"" causes). While the statistics have been getting better in general, as of 2013, ""pro"" progressive cause, especially LGBT effords, African American voters still lagged ""anti"" by a good 8 percent. (source)  And then, let's break down brand recognition. Terry Reed was practically unheard of. And Kim's base is really, really solid for her. Check out the final tallies, Kim barely held on to her lead, and this is mostly due to dilution from two very popular Republican candidates. (These numbers also show that unequivocally, Republican voters turned out in her district with a 15k voter advantage. Had there not been two Republicans in the race, she would have been gutted.)  So, how do we win? Well, I don't know. I'm just an armchair political wonk. But the only things that I can see unseating her would be either a huge scandal or a Republican winning the next election. (Though, she has been party to numerous scandals and still come out unscathed.)  Take it as you will."

The light on the close side of the 95 overpass turns green. The light on the far side is red, so functionally, no one can go anywhere. Then the light on the far side turns green an the light on the near side turns red. That way, only people under the overpass can go.  The worst part is, it stays green at the far side for what seems like hours after it has emptied out under the overpass. So you're sitting there with a red light in front of you, and immediately behind it, there is a green light and a mile of open road.

JSO thinks they make things better by sitting in the patrol car and clicking the button every once and a while between 4 and 6 pm. What they don't seem to realize is that manually overriding the light screws the syncing with the other lights in the area and causes near gridlock... Every. Day.
jacksonville,31mnfx,jmanpc,3,Mon Apr 6 22:56:33 2015 UTC,"This is going to sound random, but it's a huge PITA.    Phillips Highway and Baymeadows Way. The first light South of Phillips Highway. Baymeadows way is a back Street that almost never gets uses but that light is always freaking red on Phillips Highway making you stop there *even though no one is trying to turn! * I work the midnight shift and drive up and down Phillips Highway all the time and that light is always red making you stop for no reason! I've submitted a complaint about it and heard nothing"
jacksonville,31mnfx,lookatthemonkeys,3,Mon Apr 6 16:59:09 2015 UTC,I think they make a few of the lights on Phillips change just to stop the flow of speeders.

jacksonville,31mnfx,PotRoastPotato,2,Mon Apr 6 19:23:37 2015 UTC,Five Points would be OK if the Park Street drivers realized they don't have to stop.
jacksonville,31mnfx,bongozap,1 point,Tue Apr 7 08:27:45 2015 UTC,"I don't know if I agree...Park Street drivers stop because they have no idea what anyone else is going to do.   CONSIDER:    You approach any intersection with a yellow light and immediately, you assume everyone else has a yellow light, too.  So your only sensible reaction is to approach the intersection with caution (which is exactly what the yellow light is supposed to compel you to do) and nervously consider what EVERY other driver at the intersection is going to do. Rules of the road tell you to watch who got to the intersection before you and wait for the person on your left to go.   So it's screwed up PRECISELY because it is a 3-way stop on a 5-way intersection.  And it's likely nothing will ever be done about it because the minute anyone tries, the local community will be up in arms about how changing it will ""destroy the character of 5-Points"".  I used to live in Riverside and I still work nearby so I get down there for lunch a lot. It's also one of my favorite places to bring the family or to meet my brother for drinks and a movie at SunRay."
jacksonville,31mnfx,PotRoastPotato,0,Tue Apr 7 13:34:12 2015 UTC,"I understand what you're saying, and I agree it would be better as a roundabout. But I'm not really talking about caution; Park Street drivers should have caution and shouldn't go through full-speed. But a lot of them completely stop prior to entering the intersection as if there were a stop sign, and that genuinely has caused almost every bit of trouble I've ever had on Five Points. I always am cautious myself at Five Points, but have never once made a complete stop when driving through Five Points on Park Street. But lots of other people do. That's what I'm talking about. You follow me?"
jacksonville,31mnfx,bongozap,1 point,Tue Apr 7 13:55:27 2015 UTC,"I do, completely. But I think you may be missing my point. Let me try a slightly different approach...  When approaching a strange and busy intersection with a yellow light, your natural cautious reaction is to assume everyone else ALSO has a yellow light and to stop and see what other drivers will do.  That so many people (including myself) have a problem there is a strong indicator that the design of the intersection is the real problem."
jacksonville,31mnfx,jaxsds,1 point,Tue Apr 7 14:20:32 2015 UTC,"When approaching a strange and busy intersection with a yellow light, your natural cautious reaction is to assume everyone else ALSO has a yellow light    I don't know why this would be the case because with any flashing yellow (forget Five Points) always only one street that has a yellow, and the other that has a red. In this case, one street has a yellow, and two others have a red. Really not much different for Park Street drivers.  People forget basic traffic signals. Flashing yellow means ""proceed with caution, the other streets (besides Park Street) have a stop sign/flashing red."""
jacksonville,31mnfx,ben4prez,1 point,Tue Apr 7 15:26:22 2015 UTC,"People forget basic traffic signals.   Bingo. Keep in mind, I'm not specifically talking about 'rules of the road' or how traffic signals are supposed to work.  I'm talking about how people actually respond to them. Most of the time, I see yellow light intersections are on country roads. So seeing them in a busy intersection like 5 points is, itself, a bit of a shock.  In any case, as I wrote before, the fact that this intersection is a legendary problem - even locals - suggests that the problem is not solely (or even largely) with driver.   It's just a plain poorly-designed intersection."

jacksonville,31mnfx,TheLoneHoot,2,Mon Apr 6 15:31:07 2015 UTC,"Depends on the criteria to me.  Sometimes (semi-regularly) US1 & Greenland/9A the light cycles sporadically.  This means Greenland Road backs up pretty badly and one crawls along for 15 minutes to go a half mile.  It's not regular enough to be a ""constant"" problem, but it's frequent enough to make one concerned what the morning will bring when leaving the house."
jacksonville,31mnfx,lightningusagi,2,Mon Apr 6 15:17:51 2015 UTC,I have to take Greenland/9A everyday. The light only allows approximately 3-4 cars only. So you can imagine the frustration of being the 3rd car and the lead taking forever to move.

From the other creators I spoke with during and after the event no one but the top 3 in each category made more than $1000, and from what I heard 3rd in one category was presented with a giant novelty check on stage for $800. It was a fun event to go around see what people were presenting, was a good little bit of PR, and more or less paid for itself, but definitely didn't do the vast majority of the Creators any real good at the end of the day. :(  At least downtown businesses got a boost, the mayor got a feather in his cap, and the guys that run OneSpark raked in a big wad of cash selling it. If you can talk people into personally donating that's the only real way to make it work, maybe put up one of those fundraising thermometer signs to help encourage it? Maybe they'll have enough money set aside for vote-awarded prize money than last year. :\"

There's obviously the chance of winning your group but winning doesn't really help you out too much as others have stated.  I don't know where you will be set up but expect a good amount of people to come by and take the opportunity to really generate interest in your company.  If I presented at OneSpark, my main goals would be to create exposure for the company and to create investment interest.

jacksonville,31bjoi,tatertom,1 point,Fri Apr 3 16:15:02 2015 UTC,"Att HAS to roll out gigabit now, or they'll be forced out of the market, and it's because Comcast is and has been providing outstanding competition in this market for years. Their legacy network (the one that runs MOST of this area) can't do Gigabit, even though Comcast's existing network can. Comcast doing FTTH now only makes business sense because they forced At&t to upgrade here, through competition.  Their arguments about stifling innovation do have at least some merit, as well, when you consider that their competitors - in last-mile connectivity by a major MSO - use a different format to perform the task. Twisted pair has had public spotlight on its improvements in how we utilize it, but it has been consistently outperformed by practically silent coax in terms of bandwidth every step of the way. While gigabit speeds are only a recent development over twisted pair (and it takes 4 pairs IIRC), coax has been doing gigabit for a LONG time now. Over the same basic type of wire we started with decades ago, despite coax last-milers basically copying the distribution methods phone companies invented, and for a completely different task.  I, for one, am going to be a little sad to see coax go, but as I mentioned in another comment in this thread, that's still not going to happen for a while for anyone here that doesn't live in a neighborhood that is currently being built new, or has yet to be built."
jacksonville,31bjoi,tatertom,2,Sat Apr 4 12:24:46 2015 UTC,"FTTH? K. If you live where they're putting it in, anyway. That goes for both the big A and the fat C. If neither company hasn't been digging up yards or swinging from the poles in your neighborhood, look at houses before you bother looking at gigabit prices.  While I know that DOCSIS 3 networks can totally achieve gigabit, I seriously doubt they're going to push that through existing coax for another year or two, since the competition needs fiber to compete with it performance-wise."
jacksonville,31bjoi,tatertom,2,Fri Apr 3 21:43:57 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry. I don't understand 3/4 of your post. Also, here's a news article about it. Rolling it out next month."
jacksonville,31bjoi,PartyOnDudes,2,Fri Apr 3 23:49:33 2015 UTC,"Sorry, let me take another stab, using the article's terms. Multi-gig connections require fiber to the home. If you don't have fiber to the home already built and ready for the particular address you want it at, you're going to be paying, you're going to be waiting, or you're going to be moving if you want this service when it ""rolls out"". I don't know of any currently ready FTTH neighborhoods anywhere near Jax for the time being, and I routinely look at where they're building homes and Comcast.   Their current residential network in this area uses Docsis 3 on coax instead of fiber, and is capable of at least gigabit download speeds with practically nothing to build, but they simply aren't doing that. I believe it's because there's no point, considering their main competition here HAS to upgrade to full-fiber in order to even truly compete with their coax, nudging the bar upwards. In other words, not enough people around here were deemed interested in a FTTH product from any provider until recently, and even now, it's only going to start in brand new neighborhoods. They're not likely to roll bucket trucks and trenching crews to put fiber into places they already have a gigabit-capable system in until they need to in order to maintain market share.  A side note about the article mentioning business fiber being available since 2010- there's more to it than that. They still call their business side a different company sometimes, and sometimes not. I don't fully get how that works, but the same system, it's ownership and maintenance, and of course with a less evolved footprint/market share, has been around in some form or another for at least a decade prior. There is still fiber running in businesses that says ""Continental Cablevision"" on the side of it. Overall, I'm stoked to be one of the first FTTH markets. Our topology here makes a great test-bed for something like FTTH, as it did with true-landline phone, before their current voip offering was around.  I do love to talk about this stuff. My career path keeps running me back to it somehow. I don't always pay attention to whether or not people know wtf I'm talking about, though."
jacksonville,31bjoi,nick_drake,1 point,Sat Apr 4 03:29:18 2015 UTC,"DOCSIS 3.1  Comcast is already doing 1GB. I seriously doubt that Comcast will provide it to Jacksonville though. We might be looking at 300Mbps (305 I believe is the exact number) or at the most 500.   AT&T has the setup ready for most of the areas that are able to get access to Uverse, I believe they are just waiting to see what Comcast does now... if anything.

jacksonville,317fyx,Scarlett_ptista,3,Thu Apr 2 17:14:11 2015 UTC,"Everywhere. Seriously, any local game store is going to carry MTG and have weekly (or nightly) events.   In order of preference, I'd recommend a few stores if you're wanting to get back into it:  Friendly Local Game Store on Roosevelt. Always people playing casual decks there, and everyone's pretty nice.   Cool Stuff Games on Beach Blvd. Huge store, has one of the largest online presence for cards/tabletop.  Jax Game Center also on Beach.  Small shop, nice staff, reasonable, and usually nice players.   Also happy Viking games, and borderlands. There's other stores, but I'm not that familiar.   And if you're interesting in playing Commander/EDH (which would be good as you could play with your old cards) we have a group that meets up in Riverside."
jacksonville,317fyx,Scarlett_ptista,2,Thu Apr 2 17:10:17 2015 UTC,"I have a friend who plays commander. That's what got me back into it. I need to pick up more for that style of play, as he lends me cards and dice to use. But I'd love to meet new people and nerd out. What days do you guys meet?"
jacksonville,317fyx,Scarlett_ptista,1 point,Thu Apr 2 17:13:50 2015 UTC,"Formerly The Garage, but it's been fluctuating due to the groups work/school schedules. If you're on Facebook, check out the group ""Tuesday Night Commander"", I know a lot of people have been using that.   Also, you're welcome to pm me sometime."
jacksonville,317fyx,salty_d0ge,1 point,Thu Apr 2 17:18:40 2015 UTC,I second the FLGS on Roosevelt. Very nice place with friendly employees.
jacksonville,317fyx,Scarlett_ptista,1 point,Thu Apr 9 15:24:28 2015 UTC,"It's a nice ""neighborhood"" spot, you can play causal games, and people are generally nice. I think their product is overpriced for the most part, but I enjoy the crowd and employees."
jacksonville,317fyx,salty_d0ge,1 point,Thu Apr 9 15:38:19 2015 UTC,"I'm a 40k player, so I completely geeked out when I saw their second hand miniatures section. A little extra work on those saves some cash. But that's obviously a special circumstance when you consider their pricing as a whole."
jacksonville,317fyx,Scarlett_ptista,1 point,Thu Apr 9 17:01:37 2015 UTC,"Ah, well that's a different ballpark altogether lol. I'm talking about the markup on MtG packs ($3.99 at FLGS vs $2.79 elsewhere) and tabletop games."
jacksonville,317fyx,salty_d0ge,1 point,Thu Apr 9 17:25:14 2015 UTC,"I can see your point. At least the full scale of the markup isn't too terribly expensive though, for MtG cards, as opposed to the expenses of other hobbies. I can imagine though that at a dollar and some change markup, it would add up fast if you were trying to build multiple decks and searching for specific rare cards.    If I want a brand new 40k [insert heavy assault unit type], I can expect to pay anywhere from $34 to $60+ (almost 1:1 ratio with Gamesworkshop's online prices), as opposed to the used stuff that's in the ballpark of $12 bucks to $30.    I did notice though, that they seemed to have a massive selection of single cards (if I saw correctly) that buyers could peruse. Is that a common feature in game stores? I'm not a MtG player, so I wouldn't know."

jacksonville,30kzbe,gimebankpls,14,Sat Mar 28 07:58:35 2015 UTC,VyStar is the best choice.  Especially if you are looking to start some credit and whatnot.  They have a ton of ATMs around town too.  Source - Im a former Wells Fargo banker and I have had VyStar since I was 20...now 32.
jacksonville,30kzbe,RedRoosterJK,11,Sat Mar 28 11:04:58 2015 UTC,Credit Unions >>>>>>>>> Banks
jacksonville,30kzbe,PotRoastPotato,2,Sat Mar 28 11:39:49 2015 UTC,"Chase is a bank, and therefore for-profit. Vystar is a credit union. You will always be treated better by a credit union than a bank. The draw back is that vystar is local only. If you move, they won't be an option to you anymore. And if you travel you may run into issues with them that can't be fixed remotely. I've been with vystar myself for 16 years now, and have never had an unhappy moment. Although a friend of mine complains that vystar doesn't support apple pay yet, but Google wallet works, so who cares?"

jacksonville,30kzbe,Darth_Corleone,3,Sat Mar 28 13:14:50 2015 UTC,VyStar > Chase    I'm with VyStar and their online bill pay is top notch.
jacksonville,30kzbe,sh1ttydefaults,3,Sat Mar 28 16:27:56 2015 UTC,Been with vystar since it was jax navy federal credit union. It's been almost 23 years now. Had a BOA account because my grandma insisted. Also have experience with wells Fargo when they bought out Wachovia. Vystar is hands down the best. 5 dollars to keep my savings account opened and the only penalties or fees I've gotten were my fault for over drafting. Solved several fraud issues through them when my hubby had his wallet stolen and card used several times as well as another time someone stole his info with a card sweeper. They sent a new card and reversed charges quickly. Boa was a pain to close the account and they have monthly fees of you don't have monthly deposits or a certain amount in the account. Pain in my ass. Basically banks want to charge you fees and such to make their money off you. Credit unions are more member owned and they don't try to nickel n dime your account until you overdraft so you have to pay an overdraft fee. There are hundreds of vystar atms in town and unless you travel out of state a lot it's perfect for someone your age. Banks are better for people with thousands that they want to put in cds and other accounts to make more money over time. I always got paid a day early with direct deposit in my vystar account. People would get theirs Friday and I'd already have mine. So there's that.
jacksonville,30kzbe,internetwife,2,Sat Mar 28 17:51:21 2015 UTC,Compare the savings/checking interest rates and car/CC/loan rates; you will almost definately find that VyStar has cheaper loan rates and higher saving interest rates.
jacksonville,30kzbe,McHildinger,2,Sat Mar 28 16:03:34 2015 UTC,car/boat/home loans are way better with vystar from my experience.
jacksonville,30kzbe,final_cut,3,Mon Mar 30 06:01:18 2015 UTC,"I don't have an experience with Vystar, but Chase is absolutely awful for many reasons.  But here's my annoying/mildly funny story with Chase; had a joint account with my now ex-wife, not much money in it but I didn't want to be on the account anymore.  Chase told me they couldn't take me off the account without her permission, so they tried calling her multiple times (no reply).  After about a week of this, they told me I could close the account without her permission.  WTF is that?  They can't remove me, but I can close it?"
jacksonville,30kzbe,timmaywi,2,Sat Mar 28 11:45:39 2015 UTC,that's some weird bank rule I have run into it at Navy Federal Credit Union and BofA.
jacksonville,30kzbe,Kairbear,1 point,Tue Mar 31 21:43:25 2015 UTC,"It really depends what you want out of the bank. If you're just looking for a place to park a little cash and have a checking account either will do.   If you are looking to build/establish credit for a credit card, you can do this with many of the big credit card companies.   You aren't going to get a significantly higher amount of interest at either bank for standard savings and checking accounts. A bank is a bank is a bank until you start putting your money to work for you through investing IMO.   Car loan? The CU will be a better choice potentially."

jacksonville,30kzbe,final_cut,2,Sat Mar 28 08:42:30 2015 UTC,"credit unions are member owned, so it's different. Less fees in general. From what I understand, credit unions can't charge excessive fees or raise rates on you, because of the fact they are member owned and it'd just hurt them? I was comparing Wells Fargo with Vystar the other day with my wife (she's not originally from jax) and it's crazy how different the fee structures are. I can probably give examples if you gave me a while."
jacksonville,30kzbe,Thumb_Cock,1 point,Mon Mar 30 06:00:27 2015 UTC,"Here's one example: The fee schedule at VyStar is a single page, & most of the fees listed are not applicable to most people.

jacksonville,30jrlx,poopmouth,5,Mon Mar 30 14:31:23 2015 UTC,"No. Jump to conclusions much? It never hits the news. Jacksonville has a bad habit of downplaying white murder. Correct me if I'm wrong but most murders in poverty stricken neighborhoods get more individual airtime than a shooting in Jax beach or riverside. There was a shooting in the gold club, not on the news, and more recently there was a fatal shooting in Jax beach right by Freebirds just 2 weeks ago. Never heard about it on the news. The only white murder that really hit the news was the super hush hush, twisted up story where a white ex cop shot a biker in the face at Nippers in front of a bunch of people.   If I was reading between the lines, I'd say they want us to feel safe in our own environment while alienating the black and poor sides of town."
jacksonville,30jrlx,RevLoki,0,Mon Mar 30 15:29:23 2015 UTC,"Dude, come on. Why are you berating people for wanting to stay informed in their own neighborhoods? Yeah, it IS surprising.

jacksonville,30jrlx,sadblue,4,Wed Apr 1 02:49:36 2015 UTC,"Shit in the hood is crazy. But it really doesn't affect anyone but the late night crowd. I haven't seen any news stories outside of what I've hear, my neighbor got beat up by some skipping Lee kids in broad daylight on Barr St..   Shit happens everywhere in jax. Just because it happens in your perceptively safe bubble, doesn't mean it isn't happening.   You ever wonder why riverside peeps don't store anything valuable in their cars and rarely bother locking them? It's because broken windows are expensive.  Sucks, but it's the truth of living in an urban neighborhood. You want perceived safety? Move to the burbs. Town center needs more schlocks."
jacksonville,30jrlx,rohicks,9,Sat Mar 28 02:00:25 2015 UTC,"It's still good to be aware of what's happening. I think the post is more about the lack of mention on local news?

I'm not a morning person but I like to get to the office earlier because traffic is much worse if I leave any later.  I'm guessing that Jacksonville is about the same.

jacksonville,30kmfh,IamGrimReefer,2,Sun Mar 29 18:59:19 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I noticed that.  Indy is pretty spread out, too, but with all the bridges and waterways I could tell that Jacksonville was larger.  We're focusing on the south side because we know where my wife's office is.  I've always ended up working downtown so I expect that to continue.  We're more suburbanite dwellers than city people and we've found some houses we like a little further out, but at the same time spending less than half your life in traffic is good, too.  There are so many choices to make, but it's a good dilemma to have, I guess.  If we were relocating to a city like LA or San Francisco that are notorious for ridiculous housing prices and multi-hour commutes I'd go insane."

jacksonville,308tu9,2TallPaul,1 point,Thu Mar 26 01:00:47 2015 UTC,I don't understand why it's called a primary election when you can vote for any candidate. I'm not accustomed to this method. Why can't they keep it simple? Why would they make everybody vote twice?
jacksonville,308tu9,bhasden,2,Thu Mar 26 01:06:41 2015 UTC,"The idea is that, like in the mayoral election, if a candidate doesn't get a majority of the vote, then they potentially aren't the person wanted by the majority of voters. What I mean is that the voters of the minority candidates (3rd place onward) may have voted for the 2nd place candidate if the candidate they had previously voted for wasn't on the ballot.   For example, let's say we have 4 candidates for mayor with a breakdown of vote percentage of the following:    30% - Candidate A 25% - Candidate B 25% - Candidate C 20% - Candidate D   Even though Candidate A got the highest percentage, it could be that Candidate B would've run away with 70% of the vote if it was just A & B on the ballot. Having a runoff prevents a minority/unpopular candidate from winning if there are a lot of likeable candidates in the race that split the majority vote. As a result, the top two candidates face each other in a runoff.  The city could save lots of money if they implemented an ""instant runoff"" voting system."

That and at the first debate he said something along the lines of (I'm paraphrasing here), ""I've never supported a Democrat"" which I thought that both Bishop and Brown missed an opportunity to call him out on since they both have more moderate views and could have painted Curry as an extremist."
jacksonville,308tu9,echopeus,2,Wed Mar 25 15:29:48 2015 UTC,"Because he is so rhetorical; It's impossible for him to uphold his promises. Firstly because, we don't have an autocracy.

jacksonville,30b3vb,End_Life_2012,5,Wed Mar 25 22:53:22 2015 UTC,"Hey, rider here.  Uhm, DON'T buy a motorcycle that cheap if you plan on riding it the week you get it. I was actually in that position a year ago and I found a $500 Ninja 500 for sale. I went to test ride it, and the rear brake was bent and wouldn't work, the headlight didn't turn on, and the front brakes were so jacked up it took about 100 feet to stop from 20mph. You will kill yourself.   If a car breaks down, stops running, or anything, there is a metal cage around to protect you. You don't want a motorcycle breaking down. If you haven't taken the MSF class, please take that. They will teach you how to inspect your bike before riding and what to check for. If you are lucky enough to find a bike in that $4-500 price range, it will need A LOT of work. Like easily a thousand dollars, and that's if you're lucky.   You're best bet, as a beginner would be a Suzuki SV650 IMO. This has been my bike for a while and I don't see myself ever selling it. Very reliable, very fun to drive, very beginner friendly (provided you're a comfortable car driver and have lots of experience shifting manually). You can find really nice ones that won't need much work in the 3 thousand dollar range. Anything cheaper than that isn't worth buying unless you plan on doing work on it and buying a lot of parts. I got my SV for 2 grand, and put another thousand into it within a month. New seals, new brakes, new fuel lines since they were all dry rotted, new tires (300$), new filters, oil change, new chain and sprockets, and the fuel injectors were clogged and I had to have them professionally cleaned. Motorcycles require a lot more maintenance than cars and skimping on any of it will eventually get you into an accident. Be careful out there and I hope you can find what you're looking for.  Edit: Just realized that my preference is sports bikes. You might be able to find a cruiser or something closer to that $500 price range, but I can promise you, it's going to need some work immediately or within the first 100 miles."
jacksonville,30b3vb,AugustFinster,3,Thu Mar 26 00:24:49 2015 UTC,I have a friend who is a mechanic and has worked on lots of bikes. That's why I'm not too worried about the condition. He helped me rebuild a car at no cost other than parts. I really have no preference on which kind of bike. Thank you for your concern though! I will keep all this advice in mind.
jacksonville,30b3vb,AugustFinster,1 point,Thu Mar 26 00:48:52 2015 UTC,"=) just be safe out there. If you have any questions about anything, please please PLEASE feel free to ask. Motorcycles are the best, but please buy something safe. Feel free to hit me up if you ever want to go for a ride or have any questions. You will definitely enjoy your new purchase, I found myself saying ""fuck cars"" a lot after my first bike. I did ALL of the mechanic work myself except clean to injectors (400$ total, bullshit) and it was still close to a thousand after everything. I live in mandarin but I am moving to Tallahassee next week to accept a job offer. If you'd like to test out the SV, let me know and I'll set something up for you =)  Edit: I'm REALLY drunk, but I really hope you find what you're looking for. If you're free at all this weekend, I'll be in town and can show you the SV! But your best bet is to drop the $200 and take the MSF course at Harley and learn as much as possible before jumping on a bike. I happen to have zero fear, which apparently is very rare, lol, so please learn as much as possible.   The one thing they didn't teach is to always watch the tires instead of the driver. When you're just cruising and a car is stopped at a sign/light/traffic, look at their front wheels. Those wheels tell the biggest part of the story. Once those start turning, you know the car is coming with it, so STOP."

Needing new tires/chain/brake pads/ clutch pads is expectable. Needing ""carb work"" is shorthand for ""runs like crap"". This could be because it genuinely just needs the carb(s) cleaned up and maybe rebuilt. It could also mean the bike runs like crap and is on it's last legs, or even if it could have lots of life left to it needs lots parts to get back to roadworthy.

I enjoyed learning this way very much but it is definitely not for everyone! Also I do not know how much parent involvement a kindergarten class would require which COULD be a lot. I would contact DVIA or FLVS (Florida Virtual School) to find out more information on their programs.  But, I did enjoy learning through FLVS and I feel it is a good way to learn, but it is not for everyone."
jacksonville,306znb,UrsaArctos,1 point,Wed Mar 25 00:31:11 2015 UTC,"There's a great deal of parent involvement from what I've read until Middle School.

She gets to decide ultimately, I'm okay with it, her dad is okay with it, it's entirely up to her. We wouldn't start until next year when she's in 1st grade though."
jacksonville,306znb,HotEducator,2,Wed Mar 25 11:13:55 2015 UTC,"Just so you know I-ready is personalized for individual students and a wonderful form of enrichment. I believe the program goes to 6th grade. Your child could be working on 1st, 2nd, 3rd, etc. material using that program. You should ask for a full report from her teacher - it is super easy to pull.   I haven't used the program, but I did take FLVS courses in high school. Since she's in kindergarten it would be you acting as her full time teacher. You will have to be the committed one. If you can do that, go for it. Don't forget her social skills though. Those are SOOO important at that age. Not just making friends, but learning ""classroom"" skills like raising hands, waiting their turn to talk, actively listening, and increasing her attention span."

Hated having a stacked washer dryer combo but it was something. The pool was right out our back door and we were on the second floor. The parking lot flooded one time during hurricane season and our car had about an inch of water in it. Soaked it up and cleaned it out no problem, just parked in a higher section of the parking lot. It's called villages because there are like five or six communities with different floor plans and things. We never had problems with management or neighbors. Maintenance always showed up quickly. Granted this was awhile ago they may be different. I can't remember the name of our village but it was the giant Orange buildings at the front of the property. Across the street at Princeton square is shit. Paradise apartments were nice but we had crappy neighbors. That's further south on Southside. Currently we are ""in the ghetto"" staying at city ridge apartments. These are some off the cheapest apartments we've rented and they are huge. Maintenance man lives next door and another employee lives under us. We have been here going on two years. It's on Arlington expressway.

So if you're looking for a 1 bedroom, they may have something for you."

The traffic is horrible during rush hour.  The Parking lots do flood as someone else mentioned, overall, i'd give it a 6/10.  Casa Del Mar while called luxury apartments, they weren't really luxury besides having a wet bar. Maintenance was good and fast.   We moved out of there and rented a house for a little bit more but over 2x the amount of room and enjoyed it much more."

jacksonville,2zyf0j,BFisOverMyShoulder,2,Mon Mar 23 21:53:27 2015 UTC,"Depending on how old you (im 22 y/o Male) are there is a lot.  The night life isn't the greatest, but it isn't the worst either.  I like the riverside bars.  The beach bars are fun too, but not really my scene.  Not sure if you enjoy sports, but there's the Jax Suns (baseball), the newest addition to Jax is Jax Armada fC (soccer), The Sharks (indoor football) and the Jaguars.  I personally am a huge Jags fan and enjoy going to the games.  There is always a surplus of events to go to in Jax.  A lot of concerts with some more mainstream names coming to town and also smaller shows and theater events etc.  The St. Johns towncenter is fun to go and shop and eat.  There are many museums and stuff downtown to go to.  St. Augustine is an amazing place to spend the day at.  A lot of history there it's fun to go to.  There's a lot of small shops and good food about St. Augustine specifically St. Georges Street.  Coming up in april is a huge CrowdFunding festival downtown called OneSpark.  I went to the event last year and it instantly became my favorite.  A lot of great food, and cool things to do/look at.  It a huge event that takes over downtown."

I'm from Houston and the nightlife here is pretty great and I'm looking for something similar. Also I was curious about housing because it seems that everything in riverside is housing for sale and not apartments.   Would I have any issues finding a good gym/fitness club? Preferably one with a basketball court?   Are there any cities you could compare Jacksonville to? I really have no idea what the city is like.  Thanks!
jacksonville,2zyf0j,JBurton90,1 point,Sun Apr 5 15:30:28 2015 UTC,"For cheap? Last I checked, MOSH was $5 on Friday night, its pretty cool. There's also a ice skating rink on Emerson that has $5 nights, I would go with a huge group and we always had a damn good time. It has a mini arcade and the cool rink is awesome in the ridiculously summer. For a little more money there's Adventure Landing with laser tag, arcade, mini golf and go karts.   Hanna park is super fun to camp at, just be careful with ""extras"" like beer and grass, but if you're not obnoxious it's fine. Probably a few more things I can think of if you have something you're specifically interested in."
jacksonville,2zyf0j,TedMosby-,2,Mon Mar 23 22:56:37 2015 UTC,"What's up man, 19yo guy here too. Lived here my whole life. Jax is like any other city, just really spread out. If you wanna do something, you can probably find a business that will help you.   If you're outdoorsy, you're in luck. The beach is obvious, but Jax also has great creeks and a river that you can kayak or fish in.   If you're sorta nerdy, there are card shops and comic book stores all over the place that you can meet people at and play Pokemon, Yu-Gi-O or whatever.   The music scene here is awesome as well. I don't know if you've ever heard of Lynyrd Skynyd, Molly Hatchet, .38 Special, Yellow Card, Tim McGraw, Limp Biscuit, or Shinedown, but they're all from Jacksonville. Hit up Freebird Live, Murray Hill Theatre, or Lynch's Irish Pub, and you might be the first to witness a star before anyone has heard of them.   The fair comes around in August, and that's always a good time. Walk around, eat some greasy food and ride roller coasters all day? What's not to love!  If you're more into sports, Jacksonville's got ya covered. Jaguars and Sharks for football, Suns for baseball, Arsenal for soccer and the Giants for basketball. Most tickets are pretty cheap, so a lot of fun can be had at games for not a lot of money.   If you have any other questions, let me know and I can probably answer it! Oh, and welcome to Jacksonville!"

jacksonville,2zxkuk,IIHammer91II,5,Sun Mar 22 19:38:17 2015 UTC,"For your age and what you're looking for, check out Riverside. There are some kinda meh parts, but if you focus looking around the king street / 5 points are you should be pretty golden. Most places are on street parking.   If you can find a place to buy that's in your price range there go for it and turn it into a rental later. Rental market in Jax is kinda fucked up, most apartment complexes will run you about 850-1k for a single in the better parts of town.   Meeting people - this one is a bit of a mix, people go all over town. Places like kickbacks are pretty common get together spots for many people. There are also quite a few local brewaries with tap rooms that people tend to meet up at. It really just depends on what you're looking for in terms of meeting up.  Pros/cons - Riverside/avendale = people more in your age group and the more bohemian part of town. Really, this is where if you aren't looking for school districts or dealing with beach prices (per sqft) you want to head. Lots of local eats, local bars, local events. Also Sunray cinema is a great venue for movies and also some shows (they do walking dead for free every sunday night). Southside / Tinseltown = not far from anything. I'm not going to say close to everything, but nothing in this city is really close to anything else. It's really a bunch of small towns clustered together. Any kind of shop you want is in this general area. Chain shops galore. It's got better school districts. There's nothing really amazing about this area, but it's a pretty good suburban feel and you can get anywhere else in town in 45 minutes or less (unless it's rush hour). Beaches - Great spots are throughout, the issue is that some parts of the beach are kinda meh. South Jax beach is pretty great, but it can be a bit of a hike if you want to get to the  clubs. Areas closer to the clubs tend to be a bit rougher. Atlantic beach (north beach before mayport), is pretty nice as well.  Rent vs Buy - If you can buy in this market, do it. The properties that are available go off the market quick. I'd suggest renting for your initial 6-9 months to get a lay of the land and figure out where you want to settle in (also it may take you 6-9 months just to find a place to buy).  Crime - Yeah, it happens. It's a thing, but it's not like Detroit or Camden. Jacksonville is really strange in how crime works. You can cross a street and things go from kinda sketch to really nice. When looking for a place, drive around at night if possible and see if it makes your spidey senses tingle.  Useful info - Get sunglass, wear sunscreen, get a pair of flip flops that are comfortable. Having lived in Michigan for a while (M GO BLUE, sorry.. had to), the heat and humidity here are off the charts. Your first year you're going to not understand why people are cold when it's 50 degrees out in winter. After you've been here a couple years your blood will thin and you'll be looking for your hoody like the rest of us. Also, if you don't have tint on your car windows, it's probably a good idea to get down to legal and get a sun shade (especially if you have leather and are wearing shorts). Also keep a thing of baby powder with you when you go to the beach, it gets sand off amazingly well when you can't get to a place to rinse off.  No ideas on roommates, but it probably wouldn't be too difficult as anything that gets rent prices down is a positive.  Tourism isn't an issue in jax so much in the summer. We have a few times a year when things get a bit crazy (Florida Georgia game, aka biggest cocktail party in the south). Overall though it's pretty manageable. Orlando on the other hand and Daytona during bike week and the 500 can be a bit more of a nightmare.  Absolutely love - This is kind of a hard one. I don't know if it's so much that I love Jacksonville or it's kind of the least of the worst in a lot of categories for me. Weather is mild (I will never shovel snow again), it's coastal, it's not hard to get to any other place I may want to go, Traffic isn't as bad as people make it out to be (seriously check out Atlanta or DC traffic and get back to me if you think jax traffic is that bad), there's a lot of craft breweries that are pretty good, plenty of variety on food (though sometimes you have to travel a bit to get to some of the better spots), it feels like a small town even though it's huge. Also there's usually something to do around town. Be it art walk, riverside arts market, something going on at the beaches, stuff going on downtown. It's really not a bad city, as much shit as everyone who's lived here gives it (which I think stems more from frustration on the fact that this city really could be one of the great cities of the south if the council & first baptist would pull their heads out of the asses and actually look at doing good and modernizing instead of worrying about a boob in a painting or building lighthouses on parking garages).  The main areas for young professionals are really town center / southside, riverside / avondale, or the beaches. Mandarin is really more family oriented, though if you're at NAS, it might be a good option to look at St. Augustine rd or San Jose near 295 to be able to get over the river quicker."
jacksonville,2zxkuk,digitaldisease,2,Sun Mar 22 20:25:12 2015 UTC,"Wow, thanks for all the info (even though you're a *ichigan fan). I do think I'll end up renting for the first year at least before buying, but we'll see how that goes. Couple things:   South Jax beach is pretty great, but it can be a bit of a hike if you want to get to the clubs.   What clubs (and where) are you referring to?  I didn't see much in Riverside like everyone says, it doens't look as busy as the beaches or towncenter.   If you had to pick a beach to be the best (Jax/Neptune/Atlantic/Ponte Vedra), which one would you pick and why?"
jacksonville,2zxkuk,digitaldisease,1 point,Sun Mar 22 21:30:17 2015 UTC,"Right at the end of beach blvd along 1st there are quite a few clubs/bars. There are a few more tucked up in various spots. Places like lynches Irish pub.  Riverside has places kind of scattered. There are a few bars in 5 points (search for Sunray cinema and you'll be able to see the area) as well as on king st. There are a few other places around, but those are a couple of the drags. Kickbacks is probably the first place to start, people may say the service sucks or the food is only par, but the beer selection is pretty great and chilling out on the new patio and talking to people is more important than the speed at which food comes out.   I like south jax beach, right beside ponte vedra. Once you cross the line into saint johns county it feels more like strip malls and yuppies than beach community. I personally think south jax beach has a better vibe. Neptune beach is ok, but most people just drive through without knowing if they're in jax beach or Atlantic (unless they live there). Atlantic beach is pretty nice as well, but I'd avoid going to far northeast into mayport. Hanna park is out that way which has a great beach as well as the poles (local surf spot) and nice mountain bike / hiking trails.  Once you're in town keep an eye out for the metro Jacksonville monthly magazine. They're free and lost of restaurants and local businesses have them up front. They're actually pretty good about having things that are going on. Also Jacksonville magazine has some stuff as well.   Dash cams shouldn't be an issue."
jacksonville,2zxkuk,digitaldisease,2,Sun Mar 22 22:16:21 2015 UTC,"I gotcha, I'll have to look at riverside again then. For the jax beach bars/clubs, that's where I thought you were talking about but just wanted to make sure. Atlantic beach does look nice, but at that point I'm kinda worried about the commute to NAS... I think Jax Beach is as far as I'd go unless I get a great deal some place."
jacksonville,2zxkuk,RDKlick,2,Sun Mar 22 22:20:54 2015 UTC,"yeah, the distance to atlantic beach is the biggest issue with going out that way. To get out there you either have to ride JTB all the way to A1A and then drive through traffic north, or jump off on San Pablo and then jump on atlantic. There's no express route out there. That's the reason I ended up on the townie side of the ditch (near hodges and JTB). It makes the commute to any part of the city pretty easy. The big issue with NAS jax though from the south bank is that you'll have to cross a bridge and the best bridge to cross is the buckman (which gets pretty congested at normal rush hours).   Honestly, if you're at NAS jax, I'd say check out riverside. One nice thing with riverside rentals is that it's usually du/quadplex kind of apartments instead of one of the mega apartment complex places. http://traditionsjax.com/properties-for-rent/ I think this is the realtor that a few people I know have used to find places in riverside.  Oh yeah, and san marco isn't too shabby, but you're going to have to cross a bridge to get to work, and other than the square area, it's pretty much residential. Jack rabbits is a great venue for bands though, so even if you don't live in san marco, you'll probably find yourself there if you keep tabs on bands coming through jax."
jacksonville,2zxkuk,beachlifewanted,1 point,Sun Mar 22 22:38:15 2015 UTC,"Jax native here. Lived in Jax for 26 years before succumbing to the desire to experience something new and moved to Seattle. Based on your self summary, I think you'd be doing yourself a disservice to not consider Riverside/Avondale seriously. I lived in Jax 3 years post-college, 1 near the Town Center and 2 in Avondale. If I ever lived in Jax again, Riverside/Avondale is the only place I'd consider living. Try looking closer to St. John's Ave, where the Mellow Mushroom and Mojo's BBQ is. I rented a two bedroom house over there for < $1000 a month and had great parks and bars/restaurants within walking distance which is EXTREMELY rare in Jax.  It may be my personal preference, but I would avoid the Beaches if I were you. The crowd there can be very bro-y. Bouncers at the Beach Bars think they're god incarnate and will deny you entrance just because they feel like it, and the crowd in the Beach Bars is generally pretty bro-y/scummy. There's two pretty solid breweries there though (Green Room and Engine 15). But Riverside offers great breweries as well.  PM me if you need any other info."
jacksonville,2zxx2g,ben4prez,1 point,Sun Mar 22 21:16:11 2015 UTC,"Direct voter contact is a heavy lift. It requires an understaning of targeting that often takes years of experience. Your point about field operations can be made about quite a few organizations, often even campaigns. DFA offers great material and support, whats lacking is an organization to offer that training.  Perhaps making being engaged ""cool"" isn't as powerful as an organization that seeks to run a full scale operation. But those resources are hard to find. Maybe this is a first step in building a group that could support an organization that utilizes direct voter contact to increase turn out and send a strong message that we want different options than the standard fare."

She had issues with the protein in her blood being too high or low and having to quit for a dew weeks before getting retested and deemed normal.

The ad that pops up shows Jesus wearing tie-dye and smoking out of a bong, which makes it hard to take anything I'm about to read seriously. There's a short novel about no knock raids before going into any details about the case. The author adds unnecessary adjectives and quotation marks throughout. It's painfully long. While the subject is interesting, the article is not. Sorry. I sincerely hope that growing plants won't be an issue a 2, 5, 10 years from now, but it is what it is. Best of luck to them."

Here in Riverside my kid goes to West Riverside Elementary, I love the staff but it's not the best rated school due to ESOL dragging the score down. San Marco has Hendricks Ave Elementary, which also gets high marks and I have parent friends that have kids there, they rave about the place. Really, any parent is going to say their school is the best, and there are a lot of really crappy schools. Greatschools has some pretty dead-on ratings. http://www.greatschools.org/florida/jacksonville/schools/?gradeLevels=e  ""Family friendly"" is going to dictate your budget and desire to be close to things.

jacksonville,2zi48e,gameguy360,2,Wed Mar 18 23:43:16 2015 UTC,"The duval county school board is going through a lot of changes right now, with a high teacher attrition rate. Most likely the wounded warrior project will be near NAS air base or at mayport. If you are going to be at NAS i recommend enrolling your kids into Clay county schools rather than duval. Also I would highly recommend St. Johns county schools south of Jacksonville, most of the schools there are A.   To be honest there is a lot of volatility in Duval schools right now and your kids have a high potential to fall through cracks and get left behind very quickly. If you start fresh on a new year it wont be so bad, but make sure you meet with teachers and staff before hand to get a grip on the school.  When you meet with administration ask them what are programs your child can participate in to achieve early high school or early college magnets when they get older. Start now and know what the future has in store. It is always too late to find out you needed Algebra I in 7-8 grade in order to get into that engineering program. Always plan 2-4 years ahead. If you say they are doing well then there is no reason they cant find a good school. Just don't get too frustrated with Duval county, we are doing our best with what we have."

Public utilities are a bit more complicated, there's massive requirements for investment in infrastructure. So for starters, that's not exactly a prime ""market"".

jacksonville,2zfhvr,wootonius,0,Wed Mar 18 05:12:37 2015 UTC,"If you look at the history of such public utilities such as electricity and telephone infrastructure, it is blatant that the ""massive requirements for infrastructure investment"" is required due to barriers to entry it 100% nonsense. This is explicitly an undeserved monopoly now, with prices having no bearing to what a market rate would be in the absence of such barrier. Furthermore, if you are concerned that no one would ""invest in the infrastructure"" then why do you care about protecting their monopoly? If you're right, then no one would want to invest to compete. If that were true then why are there laws making it a ""public infrastructure?""

I'd argue that electric and water infrastructure is not an investment engine, it's a required part of modern day life and too important to saddle with profit motives of private investment.  Let the private investment build from and extend the infrastructure, not actually be the infrastructure.  Otherwise, what the hell are we paying taxes for."

jacksonville,2z8uzp,Robert_Arctor,2,Mon Mar 16 16:53:10 2015 UTC,"If you're at the beach, maybe try Kimya 86 (not sure of the spelling) or Samurai. Samurai has great sushi, that other place is new and trendy and I've only been there once but it's always packed.  Or if you don't want Japanese, you could try Flying Iguana, Blind Rabbit, that new german place that looks really good, etc."

jacksonville,2z8uzp,JinaSensei,1 point,Wed Apr 1 15:28:52 2015 UTC,I am basically looking for a replacement German Restaurant. We would drive up to Savannah to eat at their Bier Haus but I have heard that it has closed. If I could find something much closer I am willing to try them out. German Schnitzel Haus was my foray into looking for good and local German cuisine.  Thanks for mentioning Hoptinger. I will definitely check it out.

They have a sight for their Oakleaf location, so I find it weird they don't for San Jose.  Kamiya sushi is good as well, never had Samurai.

I'm sorry you were disappointed but no wooden fort or structure has survived the riverbanks, which is why the FM Historical Society is raising money to build walls- like the state did with faux Fort Caroline.    I feel its important to share how the sanctions that powered FM greatly influenced tensions between the Spanish &English and played a part in the development of the French and Indian War/Seven Years War and the Treaty of Paris later on..."

Makes me tear up thinking what a great charity that is.  That said, they're looking for a house so they can have as close to normal family life as possible, and herein lies the problem. Family and friends have clubbed together to help them with this, so we're exceptionally fortunate to have a budget of $10k but the only home we've found is $17k.   We're not in dire straits and we're not begging - we're incredibly fortunate so far, family and friends have been so kind and generous and the NHS are incredibly helpful (let alone their paying the cost of the treatment) so we're in a good place, all things considering, I'm just trying to make a bad situation as.. enjoyable?..(seems like the wrong word).. as possible."

jacksonville,2yy8il,Khal-EE-see,4,Fri Mar 13 23:52:59 2015 UTC,"AirBnB is the way to go. And you can try to negotiate a lower price when owners understand your situation.   Where you stay has much to do with where you are having treatments. Jacksonville covers a large area and going from one part of town to another can take 30 minutes. So if it's Mayo, you want to be on the southside or the beach. If Nemours then San Marco, Riverside, Avondale, Saint Nicholas. And so on."

My suggestion is to look for vacation rentals, and this is a good website to do that: http://www.homeaway.com/vacation-rentals/florida/jacksonville-beach/r7552 St. Augustine--like 45 min. away from Jacksonville--has more options than Jacksonville, but since it is for a treatment (I'm guessing Mayo Clinic?) you should totally stay closer to the area since traffic can, and will suck, around here. They have several options available on Craigslits as well--this are exclusively vacation rentals so they'd be closer to a short-term rental and meet your criteria. http://jacksonville.craigslist.org/search/vac Best of luck!"

Vacation beach rentals will be ridiculous as will most vacation rentals, because if there's one thing we know how to do, it's how to fleece foreigners on vacation."

jacksonville,2yytk0,jimcutlers_buttspeed,2,Thu Mar 19 05:03:03 2015 UTC,"i think an unspoken rule for many restaurants is do not order seafood on a monday - it's whatever they didn't sell from the weekend specials. i doubt that applies to sushi joints that essentially deal strictly in fresh seafood. in fact, mondays might be best.  i don't think it would be rude at all to ask, though i would ask what day they get their uni delivered rather than when it's freshest, hence avoiding the implication that perhaps they would deign serve you something unfit for consumption due to some incompetency on their part. but i have a tendency to over-think things."
jacksonville,2yytk0,RevLoki,1 point,Thu Mar 19 05:16:00 2015 UTC,"Best bet (and this is a blatantly silly idea) would be to call the local seafood shops. Guaranteed it's going to be ""IQF"" but if you can find out where the sushi places buy theirs, then you should be golden."

jacksonville,2ywp8b,StainWaggin,4,Fri Mar 13 13:33:30 2015 UTC,"I can't get behind any of these candidates.  Bill Bishop says some good things but look at his voting record on the city council. All of the sudden he seems to be against things he voted in favor of previously.   Lennie Curry is the hand picked candidate by the FL GOP political machine. That says it all.  Alvin Brown is an empty suit that has done absolutely nothing in office, besides rolling over like a good dog for Shad Khan.   Above all else nobody is wanting to talk about the Police & Fire Pension fund. Bishop is the only one remotely touching it but his plan is boils down to jacking up taxes and hope the union will cut the city a break (won't happen.)"
jacksonville,2ywp8b,FSBlueApocalypse,6,Fri Mar 13 16:55:15 2015 UTC,Hearing Lenny Curry speak reminds me of a sleazy used car salesman.   Alvin Brown spoke often about what he would do concerning the exact same problems we as a city have been facing since before he was elected.
jacksonville,2ywp8b,youarecaught,2,Fri Mar 13 14:55:05 2015 UTC,I did. I think it pushed me solidly into voting for Bishop in this round. Brown looked like he lived in another world and Curry was little better. How'd you feel?

jacksonville,2yt2ok,PotRoastPotato,1 point,Thu Mar 12 19:51:18 2015 UTC,Seven Bridges on Southside Blvd is definitely one of my favorite places in Jacksonville. Their fish and chips are amazing. They are also a brewery and have several different kinds of beer to choose from. I recommend getting a sampler so you can try a little bit of each to see what you prefer. I found most of them to be a little too bitter for my taste but it's all a matter of preference. The flyer is my personal favorite. Their loaded nachos are superb and I also really enjoyed their meatloaf as well. Great food and quality service all around.

jacksonville,2ymlcx,celticherald,4,Wed Mar 11 01:08:37 2015 UTC,"I'm from Orlando, but have been following this referendum 1 with interest...  Last fall there was an inspector general board set up to investigate city departments for fraud, waste and irregularities. The Jax annual budget is approaching half a billion each year (about $400M) with a lot of space for waste to be hidden. This referendum expands the oversite authority to JEA, police and fire pension fund and several other independent offices. This is big in South Florida and 10's of millions have been saved in either Broward or WPB county. I forget which.   A biggie is that neither the SAO nor the PD offices are included and are specifically excluded. You don't want this to be a paper tiger like the ethics board has proven itself to be. (Do a little research on Aundra Wallace of the Jax Downtown Investment Authority and see the millions of $ that disappeared in his wake in Miami and Detroit and you have to wonder why the ethics board kept their mouth shut when he was hired.)  I'd support it, but it will have to be monitored so that it doesn't become a rubber stamp authority.  The straw ballot 1 just says that city employees, independent agencies like the sheriff's office employees will have to live with the city limits. It's a common requirement so that the employees have a vested interest in the community rather than commuting from St. Augustine, etc.. Jax is so big, I'd think emergency svcs would have a response time requirement for their employees in an emergency situation, but other than that, I don't know that it makes much difference.   HTH  EDIT:  if you have any interest in politics and want to make a long-term difference in Jax or anywhere you live, go to some police and fire pension board meetings. They're open here in Florida unless contract negotiations are going on. Unless the pension concept is changed dramatically, Jax and thousands of other municipalities will be bankrupted with the unfunded liabilities of city employee pensions. Police and fire unions along with very generous pension board members have negotiated citizens into a corner. The police and fire employees are eligible to retire much earlier and with very generous pensions that for the most part are unfunded liabilities. Jax currently has unfunded employee pension liabilities of $1.7B.   This isn't meant as a slam on FF or cops, just that they have negotiated some very generous pensions for themselves and going forward, these need to be adjusted significantly."

It does not lend credence to the accuracy of his writing related to the historical significance of the location.  You went in expecting the flavor of his writing style,  I had no such expectations.  In the context of not knowing his writing before hand, the abrupt inclusion of religious association in the form of a conspiracy theorist-esque association of biblical verse with a landing strip, it's simply sounds a bit looney.  I'm willing to explore his motivations and persona in other writings, but don't take offense for a rationally considered humorous response to his quirks of literary prose.  Cheers."

As a person who works on campaigns, local candidates will get washed out and have less access to volunteers focused on local issues.   The cost is negligible considering the local focus and if you wanted to actually fix that, charge a fee for every commercial run of .05 and fund the election that way. You'd make a profit."

Kahn and his company have been designing this for months and now that they unveil it other companies have 30 days to respond to the city to bid. Sounds like a rush job to me. Hopefully it doesn't end up like the court house or the previous shipyards projects, or countless other projects in Jax that the city messed up.   Also, while the idea of a brand new shipyards sounds great, the city has better things to do with its money than this. Watch the city jump up and down to raise taxes to pay for this, but could care less about the pension problem or crumbling infrastructure. The city needed 9 million to fix and repair roads last year and they only funded less than 1 million. How about the city pay off its debt, reopen libraries, fix roads etc, then you can have your shipyards."

jacksonville,2y3e0b,pigletpig,4,Fri Mar 6 02:41:20 2015 UTC,I second Chets Creek Elementary. I used to work there. It's an incredible school. There is nothing like it here in Northern Virginia where I live now.
jacksonville,2y3e0b,Tidalwave808,2,Fri Mar 6 05:25:18 2015 UTC,"I gotta go with /u/digitaldisease on this. I can't speak for the school but, Mayport has some rough neighborhoods unless you're a lot closer to Atlantic Beach. I used to live on Hodges I liked it. It's technically not considered the beaches area but it's within 5-10 minute drive of Jax beach.   Edit: I don't know what price range you're looking at for apts. but you can also try the Ponte Vedra area. Prices are a little higher but its also a great area. Used to live there too! Check out Ponte Vedra Lakes, I think there's about 4 or 5 apparent complexes back there."
jacksonville,2y3e0b,jbiz,2,Fri Mar 6 11:50:37 2015 UTC,"I used to live off of Hodges and still own a property in the area that I rent out. It's a great neighborhood. Hodges is a busy road itself but there are safe sidewalks that run down both sides. A nice Starbucks and a Publix sit at the south end of Hodges, and there's a Target and Walmart and tons of other shops/restaurants at the intersection of Hodges/Beach Blvd. So if you were to live somewhere between Butler Blvd. and Beach Blvd., all of that would be within walking/biking distance.   It's also 10 minutes from the beach, 10 minutes from the St. John's Town Center (lots of big box shopping), and 20 minutes from downtown (with no traffic)"
jacksonville,2y3e0b,digitaldisease,4,Fri Mar 6 15:44:32 2015 UTC,Also close enough to jax beach to hit trader joes and blind rabbit.
jacksonville,2y3e0b,digitaldisease,2,Sat Mar 7 00:11:14 2015 UTC,"For that location, if you were early 20's-30's with no kids I would tell you look at riverside and avondale. However because the schools in that area aren't that great, I'm going to stick with suburbs around the town center as your best bet. It will be a bit of a commute, (JTB -> 95 -> Main Street or Acosta Bridge) and that route will be full of construction for a while. (30-45 minute commute each way)  The good thing about living near JTB around hodges / san pablo / south jax beach, is that you really can get to everything pretty easily. You have reasonable access to get to 95 and quick access to 295. There's some pretty decent food out around the beach and in the general area (not as good as going into manhatten, and you'll want to check out nene's pizza off penman near beach blvd to get your pizza fix, if you find something better let me know but so far that's one of the best traditional NY slices I've found).   Having lived in Jacksonville for over 15 years and having lived all over town (Riverside, southside blvd, arlington, mandarin, Intercoastal west (aka hodges/san pablo), in my opinion ICW is the sweet spot of the city."
jacksonville,2y3e0b,digitaldisease,1 point,Fri Mar 6 15:56:32 2015 UTC,"Yeah, 95 and jtb is about to be a major pain in the ass for the next couple of years as they re-do the entire intersection. There really aren't that many great commutes into downtown right now anyway with all the construction at the fuller warren/Acosta/Main Street bridge.   It was real fun coming home from art walk, Main Street bridge was closed, detour to Acosta, acosta to 95 is closed (no heads up so you could detour to the fuller warren) so have to swing to San Marco, 95 on ramp there was closed so ended up going up Philips to jtb. Probably could have jumped on Emerson, but the wife and I were playing spot the prostitute (not as easy as it used to be back when all the hourly motels were on that strip)."

Based on everyone's comments about St Johns county schools and how they're better than Duval county, I'd definitely look at Ponte Vedra. It's right on the border of the two counties but still technically in St Johns so your kids would go to a St Johns county school but you would be still a 20 - 30 minute drive to downtown Jacksonville (depending on traffic of course, but you are used to that being from Long Island I'm sure) Ponte Vedra is really nice. It's more expensive than the Hodges area and you won't get as much apartment as you would on Hodges but it might be worth it to have your kids going to better schools!"

I think the area is called Ponte Vedra Lakes. We had some friends renting there for a while. Not sure how nice all of them all, but they're very close to Butler and Target/Publix, and part of the St Johns school district.   I'm trying to think of a few of the apt complex names in there... I want to say Soleil, Remington, Belleza... Pretty sure all of those are St Johns-zoned, plus there are lots of condos and garden homes/bungalows back there that are sometimes for rent. Good luck!!"

jacksonville,2y3e0b,djob13,3,Fri Mar 6 07:02:31 2015 UTC,"If you're still in Duval county when high school rolls around, Stanton and Paxon are two of the best rated public high schools in the country."
jacksonville,2y3e0b,Median1,2,Fri Mar 6 11:20:05 2015 UTC,"I'll be honest, if you have a smart kid, it's not gonna matter that much what school they go to.  The teachers will recognize that they're excelling and put them in a gifted program.  Once in those programs they have a step up to get into the college prep magnet schools.  I went to school in Duval and that happened to me.  I eventually found myself at Stanton which is consistently in the top 5 of the country (not county...the U.S.).  My son went to school in Duval and ended up at Stanton too, graduating IB.  I really think parents put too much emphasis on getting their kids into an A school.  Your involvement will have the most influence on their learning. With that being said, Fishweir is consistently A rated and in the Avondale area, closer to Downtown.  Hendricks Ave is A rated too and located in the San Marco area, again, close to downtown.  So there are a couple of options in Jacksonville that are close to downtown."
jacksonville,2y3e0b,amiker7709,0,Fri Mar 6 13:30:22 2015 UTC,"Clay County has the best schools in the area. There are definitely draw backs to living in Orange Park, but if your child's education is at the top of your priorities, that's the place to be."
jacksonville,2y3e0b,djob13,3,Fri Mar 6 21:27:08 2015 UTC,St. John's is number one... but Clay is about $50k cheaper for the same house. What you get in St. John's is a little better public education and no Blanding Blvd.
jacksonville,2y3e0b,amiker7709,2,Fri Mar 6 03:40:37 2015 UTC,"Just FYI, St Johns district is ranked 3rd in the state. Clay County is 17th.

Don't let the school grades deceive you, unless you are in a magnet in Duval, you are getting very low quality education. Low spending, poorly qualified and under experienced teachers (in general), and a district that is very very very poorly run. It doesn't help much that Florida is just about dead last in the country for education. Better counties (like St. John's mostly, but Clay a little too) have started to simply ignore the educational directives coming down from the state."

jacksonville,2xxhnz,heroesandnightmares,-3,Fri Mar 6 16:13:41 2015 UTC,"I wear at a minimum a jacket to work every single day. Unlined pants for men (brooks brothers sells them, so does jos. a bank) and light (summer weight / part silk generally) Jackets. For shirts I HATE the summer weight stuff and just pick something that's fitted (read has a sleeve length and neck, not a Medium). If you're warm take off the jacket. If you're still hot roll up the sleeves. For socks get lighter weight, but not shorter, socks. (Last edit: I promise) I also never ever wear a tie and I never wear an undershirt, It's too damn hot out for that. Gold bond is a thing, buy it and use it.  If you're young it's critical to be the best or second best dressed in the office. Also developing your own style at work is important for your image, this is how you present yourself to your co-workers. IF you wear a t-shirt shorts and flip flops ""casue you're allowed to"" as a software developer well, i'm going to pay you like that too. Everyone always comments that i'm the best dressed in the office. The guy that has giant holes in his pants and reeks of cigarette smoke get's noticed too, but nobody wants to work with him or go into his office."
jacksonville,2xxhnz,StainWaggin,0,Wed Mar 4 22:47:29 2015 UTC,"Always, ALWAYS, wear an undershirt with a button up shirt. No one wants to see your skin through the buttons or God forbid your shirt is see-through. Also, don't wear a ""wife beater"" as an undershirt; if your shirt is fitted you will see the tank top lines and it is tacky. Wear a light v-neck as an undershirt instead.   Unfortunately as guys, we don't have a ton of options other than slacks and button-up. Lighter colors and fabrics are your best bet. If you can get away with a polo short sleeve and khakis, go for that! Making sure your clothes fit properly really helps with heat, comfort, and looks. I cringe every time I see someone wearing a shirt that looks like a tent at work. Getting stuff tailored isn't as expensive as one might think, and makes a world of difference!  I think it's ok to wear shorts and t-shirt if you're allowed to, you work with younger people, most others are doing it, and depending on who your clients are. Just make sure it looks nice, fits well, and you don't have holes and stains. But unfortunately there aren't many places in Florida where it would be acceptable in my opinion."
jacksonville,2xybl6,Gods_Holocaust,1 point,Wed Mar 4 21:50:58 2015 UTC,I'm a RPCV. Id be happy to answer any questions you have. What do you want to know specifically?
jacksonville,2xybl6,alici827,1 point,Thu Mar 5 16:12:20 2015 UTC,"Thank you for your service!  What sector did you serve in? Would you say you felt satisfied with your training once you arrived to your host country? I've heard that the training is rather hit or miss. Could you describe to me what a bad day is like? I've heard the horror stories and the successes, but what's the struggle like on a day to day basis? I'm not concerned about a lack of toilets and a/c. My greatest fear is that I'll be more or less alone, without a support structure both within the PC and my local community.  I'm looking to join as a challenge to myself. To see what I can do. A test if you will. If I can help people, even in small ways too, that's even better. I'm hoping to develop as a person and learn how my fellow brothers and sisters live.  Lastly what were your credentials prior to serving? What experiences really allowed you to thrive?  Again thanks for your time."
jacksonville,2xybl6,alici827,2,Thu Mar 5 16:33:37 2015 UTC,"Right after my graduation with my double bachelors in Education and Biology I started my service. It is hard to tell what experiences on a professional level allowed me to thrive. To me it was my personal experiences that served me the best while overseas. I find myself to be a very independent person that went though many challenges early in life. This, (not a particular job or class in college) served me the best.   I was an education volunteer. Keep in mind however that your primary project is often not the only one you have. I taught science in a secondary school but worked in the community in health centers and aided in other development projects. I was also a volunteer trainer during my second year to new volunteers coming into the country.   Training for me was great. Living with a host family and having the first 10-12 weeks to learn the culture, language, and necessary skills to do your primary project effectively was essential. This time allows the volunteer to get used to the idea of being in a new country with no friends and family, while allowing you to build bonds with your fellow volunteers and community locals.   A bad day is hard to describe because each host country is vastly different with unique challenges. Though you do hit a nail on the head. A bad day for many volunteers was a day where they felt lonely. You are very much alone. You are at your site without any other volunteers. Over time however, you make friends within the local community. Each day was different but you have to focus on your project and why you are there. Keep in mind that most countries have cell service so you can get calls and texts from friends and family back home as well as what I considered my closest friends at the time, the other peace corps volunteers.   It is most definitely a challenge. It does change you. Your outlook on international issues, american life, and your overall personal demeanor will change.   I hope this answers some of your questions to your liking. Id be happy to answer any more."

Maverick's is fine though, it's a popular enough bar with a country theme/vibe and it's a perfectly fine venue.  The other downtown bars are great though."
jacksonville,2xts9m,Jove4,9,Tue Mar 3 21:13:44 2015 UTC,"Not sketchy at all. There is no reason at all to avoid the downtown area. I've seen a few shows there, mostly bluegrass, blues rock and it is a fine place to see a show. Nothing amazing about it, but the sound is quality and you can see the stage from most anywhere. The bars are huge and you really don't have to waste much time waiting for a drink. Enjoy downtown and be sure to wander down Bay and Adams Street if you are looking for a drink after the show.   I'm going to the Gin Blossoms show as well. Enjoy it."

It's kind of surreal, since was an old-western styled arcade before it was a (mostly) country bar.  They are booked there more than likely because there is one guy that books shows for Mavericks, Jack Rabbits, Freebird Live and the Ponte Vedra Concert Hall (along with other venues).  It's decent place to see a show.  I'm not going to Gin Blossoms but I will be going to Howard Jones at the end of the month there."

jacksonville,2xts9m,Jagator,1 point,Wed Mar 4 17:42:23 2015 UTC,"Mavericks is a good place to see shows. If you want to dance then stay downstairs of course but if you want the best view of the show go upstairs on the right side (if you're facing the stage) of the place and pick a spot on the rail early. That side gives the best view since the place sort of curves, you can't see the stage from every spot on the left."
jacksonville,2xts9m,Jagator,1 point,Wed Mar 4 17:41:46 2015 UTC,"Love mavericks. Nothing wrong with it, pretty chill country people. Expect line dancing. After a few beers, try it! There are some classier club type places near down town but expect a bit more snobbish people there."

We had a pretty intuitive idea to become a mobile repair solution in Jax. We did the whole 9 yards, banner, booth, flyers etc. At the end of the day, it didn't pan out. Even went onstage to pan our idea to the audience, but to no avail."

No, we've got to get an ineffective HRO in place ASAP and everyting else be damned.  Remember when we all looked down our noses and laughed at silly Mike Hogan building a mayoral campaign for a major metropolitan city on a platform of gun rights and abortion, two things that he could not address?

He's a Clintonian neo-liberal, which I personally despise. I also can't help to notice that we also elected his huge ego, as he loves any type of photo appearance and a chance to brand local events with his name.   Having said all that, some observations:  What's the curve we're grading him on? He can't get a fair shake from the media in this town. He really is damned if he does, damned if he doesn't. John Peyton has to be one of the worst mayors this town has had since consolidation, yet he got free passes all through out his administration.  Has anyone seen that courthouse? Didn't Gate Concrete, of Gate Petroleum do the pre-cast? Isn't John Peyton the scion of the Gate business interests? He had an IT scandal that, much like our Teflon Governor, didn't seem to affect him. He didn't do a thing for pension reform; he left it to the next guy, the poor idiot.  I honestly can't much comment on the budget issues, but fingers MUST also be pointed squarely at our City Council.  I thought the NBA team thing was just having pre-season games played here.  There have been a few already, haven't there? That seems like that would be a boon to the city, trucking that out of town money through here.  I can't speak to the Macy's thing. It's hard to argue that a major store downtown wouldn't do great things for the revitalization and maybe get Petra and Sleiman actually to do something with properties downtown. I don't think anyone wants Hemming Plaza to be replaced with a store.  Well, maybe some of our City Council members who fancy themselves beholden to developers rather than the citizenry of JAX.  So, we elected the guy self-appointed local king-maker, Peter Rummell wanted us to elect last time. Now he wants us to elect Lenny Curry, the former chair of the state GOP, because Alvin Brown's disappointing with his lack of leadership, and I think he also called him a coward.  Are we really supposed to assume that these business folk have the city's best interest at heart? A city where no one pays mobility fees and we have the third highest rate of pedestrian fatalities in the state AND in the nation, second only to Orlando and Tampa, two cities ruined and raped by developers and a City Council that enables them.   Make no mistake about it. HRO is what got us here, with this great dissatisfaction with Mayor Brown. We can say it was this and it was lack of that, but his refusal to address the HRO is the sexy issue that local voters can cut their teeth on.  They don't know or care about the boring nerd stuff, like pension or budget issues, and so Alvin Brown becomes any easy target in a town with one newspaper with a ridiculously right slant, a bi-polar alt weekly, four news stations owned by two conservative corporations, and a smattering of blogs by wanna be partisan operatives. We only get involved with politics when it's about LGBT issues or a naked boob hanging in a museum these days. Why aren't we embarrassed that this is all that gets us motivated anymore? We have one of the highest rates of homeless children in the nation.  HIV transmission has been exploding locally for years now, but not a peep or preventive program.  For all of our military bases and we rank very low on veteran wellness and quality of life, at least as of 2013. We have very particular and pertinent problems that are ignored by our cities elected leaders and media. And Curry and Bishop are not going to touch them. They are running to serve business, and certainly not small business. Alvin won't either, but it's harder for him to run from those issues, because he's from a party that's supposed to care about that sort of thing.  The GOP will just point us in the direction of our bootstraps.  I am going to clothespin my nose and vote for him. He's the evil I know. Bill Bishop is white-washing his past to seem more mainstream, but I can't forget that he was Florida campaign co-chair for Herman Cain, and supported him as he proposed a constitutional amendment banning same sex marriage, as he touted his 9-9-9 plan, a foolish economic plan lifted from a computer game that would have raised taxes on the working class, and of course, his full throated support of Mr. Cain after the allegations sexual impropriety began to emerge. I can't forget that he is an ambitious politician who will say what is most convenient at the time and is convinced he is the smartest guy in the room. Lenny Curry. Don't even want to talk about him. Just Google the man. I'll say it takes a certain type of creature to run the state GOP during one of the biggest scandals the RPOF had, and that's really saying something AND he couldn't even keep the state red during Obama's election. He had one job, and he couldn't even do that. He had one job! I mean, Rick Scott got re-elected using his own money, for glob's sake.  Ah, well. Maybe voter turn out will suck, as usual, and nothing will change.  It's sad that that's the best we have to hope for. Because none of these mayoral candidates are the 'droids we're looking for."

jacksonville,2x5hlz,uilol,6,Wed Feb 25 20:41:51 2015 UTC,"Without knowing your ages, I'd say that Dos Gatos is a great place downtown to go. Other places include Indochine, the Volstead, and Burrito Gallery.  Underbellys and 1904 are venue bars, so I'm not too sure what their hours/days open are like. Burro Bar is a pit (that I love) but I'm not sure that's what you guys will be looking for.  If you want to venture a little ways away from the elbow, I would recommend going to the area ""Five Points"" which has a few bars and is only 5 minutes or so away by car.  There is also the San Marco area which has a couple wine bars as well as a whiskey bar known as Sidecar.  Then, if you wanna venture a little further, King Street in riverside has a few bars but those can be packed wall to wall at times.  As for food, I'm a sucker for the various hotdog carts."

Watching the sunset there is absolutely beautiful. There's also nice (albeit pricey) restaurants nearby if you wanna make it a date.  edit: I lied. It's not called Riverfront Park. Give me a sec.  edit 2: so, it's called River Road in San Marco. It's right next to a European Street down there, so if you look for the ES in San Marco, you'll find River Road.

I'm a life long fan of the Ninja Turtles. I love reading, and movies and I go on rants to my closest friends about how I would change movies of books (i.e.: can you imagine Harry Potter as a multi-season show by HBO or netflix instead of just a handful of movies?!). So if you think you'd like a geeky friend to go drinking with or discuss why in spite of crushing the live-action movies Marvel still gets beat by DC in animated features, take a chance and show up.

Sandalwood is the high school and it gets a bad rap, but it actually has some really great programs for its students and excellent opportunities for its top students such as an IB program and the ability to graduate high school with your AA.  There's also a private school, Providence, in this area that is one of the most affordable in the city and has been growing rapidly.  It takes grades K - 12. The housing communities are a mix of gated and non-gated.  You can find just about anything you'd like here.  They have canal-front homes around the San Pablo Rd. area, homes in your price range in a gated community in the Woods, and several areas that are still being built if you want something brand-spankin'-new."

jacksonville,2wfp0o,CZiemba,7,Fri Feb 20 06:24:29 2015 UTC,"Yo, butcher here.   What cuts are we discussing?  Meat is graded prime, choice, select, standard.   Stay away from anything select and standard. It is total shit.   Choice is at most grocery stores. Prime is hard to find, and extremely expensive. But it is totally worth it.   When buying meat, don't think fat is bad. Fat is your friend. It adds flavor. Lean meat is less flavorful.   Preparation is also an important factor. Let's take a versatile piece of meat, such as chuck tender. Good flavor, fairly tender.   If I slap it in a pan and cook it, it probably won't taste good. If I add some onions, pepper, salt, mushrooms, and Worcestershire sauce, I've got me some good eats.   Grass fed vs normal. I have had both, but I have never cooked them exactly the sane for a blind taste test. Grass fed is a gimmick. It makes the animal leaner, which in turn, tougher and less flavor.   Organic, YMMV. Some are grain fed organic, others grass. Grain fed is better, but you won't get a distinction.   ""Good source"" my ass. It all comes from the same few suppliers, unless local or international. National beef, IBP, Swift, and a couple others. They supply most different types and qualities."

jacksonville,2w7md5,drayca,10,Wed Feb 18 14:21:46 2015 UTC,"I agree that an aquarium would be cool, but expecting people to stop in Jacksonville for an aquarium is unrealistic in my opinion. There's a great aquarium in Atlanta and there's one in St. Augustine and two in the Orlando area.   Depending on where someone is coming from, they'd potentially be better off stopping at one of those places to visit an aquarium.  If an aquarium is built, I think it should be more of a niche aquarium and something that locals could support without relying on tourists that are not likely to stop in just to visit it."

jacksonville,2w5mr4,beaueod1,7,Tue Feb 17 13:45:57 2015 UTC,"CCW licensed people have been consistently found to be more law abiding than the general public. Just by the nature of Florida's gun and CCW laws it's not going to be 18-20 year old non-sober, non-sound, Chads carrying guns all around campus. After this law passes I bet 99% of campus goers continue to go about their day not carrying a gun and not worrying about it. You think that people are going to go out and spend all that money licensing and arming themselves just to wave it around and intimidate people, but the short history of concealed carry being allowed in the united states just doesn't support that point of view."
jacksonville,2w5mr4,beaueod1,2,Tue Feb 17 13:55:42 2015 UTC,"This story has nothing to do with concealed carry on campus. Yet again I reiterate that people who go through the licensing process have been found to be more law abiding than the general population. This was a frat chad who committed manslaughter. Concealed carry is concealed carry. If someone is acting irresponsibly you can bet money that their right to carry will be taken away by the police quickly.   Unfortunately for you it looks like this is going to happen no matter what you want. So I guess when college campuses become the murder grounds of Florida you will be able to say I told you so. Or more likely, nothing will happen at all. Because as Americans we are safer now than we have ever been in the history of the planet."

jacksonville,2w5mr4,bhasden,-1,Tue Feb 17 16:34:56 2015 UTC,"The actual text of the 2nd amendment is ""A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.""

jacksonville,2w5mr4,bhasden,2,Tue Feb 17 17:14:46 2015 UTC,"Does it matter what the intention of the 2nd amendment was? It was written by people who didn't guarantee women or other races the right to vote, so saying it doesn't guarantee the right to use defensive weapons isn't much of an argument against the human right to self defense."
jacksonville,2w5mr4,beaueod1,1 point,Tue Feb 17 17:25:44 2015 UTC,"I tend to agree with you there that the original intention of the 2nd amendment shouldn't matter and we should deal with the world as it is today.   That said, the previous commenter implied that the founding fathers had clear intentions with the creation of the 2nd amendment (in regard to keeping personal weapons) and I don't think that's accurate. Whether intentional or not, that turns the argument away from the topic at hand, which is whether guns should be allowed in campus. I think that there are certain places that guns should be prohibited and college campuses should be one of them. College is a place for academic debate and the free exchange of ideas without repercussion. Anything that could possibly hinder that should be dealt with very carefully.   In this instance, the colleges and those attending them seem overwhelming against guns on campus. For me, that ends the argument. Others have different opinions that are perfectly valid, but should be argued with logic and facts, not hyped-up rhetoric.   BTW, I am not implying you're making an argument one way or another or that you aren't arguing with facts or logic, just that some others on here are doing so and it's taking focus away from a personally important discussion since my wife is a college professor."

As someone who owns multiple firearms, it doesn't bother me in the least to have an open mind in relation to the 2nd amendment.

When I am drinking, I take my holster and weapon off, unload the gun, and place the magazine in a separate location. I also believe alcohol is normally restricted on campuses. I know I've never seen anyone drinking at FSCJ. I feel that the students making stupid choices aren't the same students paying $50 to take a firearms safety class, $100 to apply for a license, $400 for a gun, $30 for a belt, and $60 for a holster. That would buy a lot of PBR. The students making stupid choices are probably the ones that would break into a car and find a gun that a law-abiding student was forced to leave in their car."

If trained military members sometimes have a hard time differentiating friendlies from enemies then I don't want civilians trying to decipher who the the bad guy is and trying to take him out. There are paid University police that are trained for those situations.  We should let the UPD do their job and I say that as someone whose wife works as a professor and is on campus all the time."
jacksonville,2w5mr4,beaueod1,2,Wed Feb 18 18:06:23 2015 UTC,"I feel that the chances of multiple concealed carriers confronting an aspiring mass shooter are slim to none. If that were the case, each one of those carriers chose to put themselves in a life threatening situation. If they are injured by the murderer or misidentified by another carrier or officer, that is a risk they accepted. They do not need or want to be ""protected"" by being banned from carrying on campus."
jacksonville,2w5mr4,KettleMeetPot,0,Tue Feb 17 13:40:07 2015 UTC,"I agree that an armed person assumes the risk of being shot and should clarify my previous point. I was trying to point out that having someone other than trained police officers trying to take out a gunman on a populated campus seems like it could lead to more dead and wounded than what would otherwise would have occurred.   With the increased focus on campus shootings, the procedures in place for keeping students and faculty safe and for the police to respond quickly seem to be better than ever. I think continuing to improve those procedures would lead to a safer campus than allowing guns on campus."
jacksonville,2w5mr4,beaueod1,1 point,Tue Feb 17 05:09:03 2015 UTC,"It's possible that a concealed carrier could injure or kill someone they did not intend to, and they would be held accountable. On the other hand, couldn't a mass shooter kill and injure more people the longer it takes for someone to engage them?   There is usually an officer in the parking lot on my campus and it takes me a few minutes to walk to class so lets say it would take the officer 1 minute to get to my class. Apparently even a novice shooter can fire 3 rounds per second, but I'll be generous and say a hypothetical shooter fires 1 round per second and takes an amazingly long 5 seconds to reload. That's 45 rounds a shooter could put inside of people before a cop on campus arrived. If a student in the classroom was able to legally carry a weapon it could have been over almost instantly.   Also, it's not just guns that are banned on campus. Right now we can choose between pepper spray and stun guns - neither of which are highly effective. Why can we not carry tasers? If you don't know, a stun gun is a prop for Jackass, and a taser incapacitates bad people. A taser is not a deadly weapon (usually), is not capable of rapid firing, and I believe each cartridge has a serial number. What's the argument against allowing tasers?"

Crazies shouldn't have been allowed to buy firearms in the first place, and its pretty much impossible to say that if other students had firearms the death toll would have been less. Maybe it would have - but that kid knew he was going to die, so would the knowledge potentially-armed students prevented anything? I think its an uphill battle, arguing for guns on campus."

Dude tells me where he works- he drives the golf cart shuttle at the Town Center on the weekends.  He asks what I do- I just tell him I work in software.  His response was something like ""Oh, then wow. It sounds like you know how to get things done. Let me give you something.""  Pulls out a business card with the blue and red Primerica logo. Same thing you heard- ""It's a real life changing opportunity, I could really use somebody who knows how to get things done.""    Explaining that he does financial services, I wonder how this financial guru is still driving a golf cart hauling lazy shoppers around.  Wary, I smile and nod as he writes his cell phone number on the back of the card.  He asks for mine, I laugh and say ""Well, you'll have it when I call you I guess!"" as I shake his hand and walk away.    Hell, it could have been your buddy- it's the same location.

Purchase a theme on WrapBootstrap ($10)  Use the Font Awesome icons to break up the site and provide more context.  Rework all of the product logo images that have white backgrounds on them (Samsung, Whirlpool, etc..).  I've seen good lists that have  multiple ones next to each other, they usually remove all colors until the user highlights them.  And because I'm a jerk.  Why not use Wordpress or Squarespace?  It gives your customers more control over the content and allows them to update their site with specials, new images, customer testimonials without your intervention.  Keep working through Boostrap though, it's a great platform, I just think building a site from scratch these days with no CMS is a bit naive."

People like to complain and cause problems over stupid things like this, that don't make a true impact or actually hurt anyone. My personal opinion, people like to feel important and have their precious little opinion heard.

And look at the ""revolution"" which left power in exactly the same hands but without having to send a pittance of tax revenue overseas, and left—I think—12 of 13 states with official state churches, the last of which wasn't disestablished until the 1830s.

Check the events at underbelly, jack rabbits, and freebird live if you like music (local and national ). You could also see whats going on at Florida theater.

Jackrabbits is good for live music if you prefer the dive bar type environment. Both venues get lots of great acts and are pretty safe places. Shanty town downtown is a chill hole in the wall with a nice vibe.  There are lots of parks in Jacksonville, some better than others but they are all pretty decent in one regard or another. Memorial Park is one of my personal favorites.   For great food, I highly recommend Seven Bridges on Southside. I've been there several times and I've never been disappointed with the food or service. Their fish and chips are the best in Jacksonville imo. They are also a brewery and have many varieties of their own beer available. You can ask for a sampler for a few bucks where you try a bit of each to decide what you like.   On beach blvd, there is all wet sports where you can rent a kayak and explore a cozy little stream next to the place or take the kayak to another launching point.  I'm not sure where you're coming in from, but St. Augustine isn't far from here and the drive down A1A to get there is absolutely gorgeous. I hate to say it but it's much easier to find things to do in St. Augustine than it is in Jacksonville.  If it's not too cold while you're here, renting mopeds and exploring the back roads of St. Augustine is great fun. There are lots of great food options that are easily accessible. St. Augustine just has such an awesome vibe to it. It shouldn't be missed if you haven't been there.   I'm not sure if you read this article, but it's by the Folio Weekly (which I highly suggest you get a copy while you're here as it's the best way to find out what's going on) so it's not your typical 100 things in Jax list. It's worth checking out, even for a native.  http://folioweekly.com/100-THINGS-YOU-MUST-DO-IN-JACKSONVILLE-BEFORE-YOU-DIE,11802  Good luck and have a great time while you're here!  *Edit: Be sure to check out The Catty Shack Ranch if you like big cats!

jacksonville,2vfl1q,RabidRoosters,2,Tue Feb 10 17:46:26 2015 UTC,Yup.  Their speeds aren't bad for the price.  If you get your own modem you can cut your cost by $8-10.
jacksonville,2vfl1q,StainWaggin,2,Tue Feb 10 18:18:00 2015 UTC,Second on this. If you get Comcast go buy a modem.

The only trouble was in initial setup since they hadn't yet run fiber down my street. To the box on the corner, yes, but not down the actual block. Took them two weeks to get the trucks out to do it, but they comped my first two months in return.  Everyone hates AT&T, but my U-Verse rocks.  And no, I don't work for AT&T."

jacksonville,2vfl1q,brainfreeze91,1 point,Tue Feb 10 19:01:16 2015 UTC,"I mean, it depends on what you are going for. Do you just want barely functional internet speeds? I can't speak for those options.  Unfortunately, Comcast looks like the only option with reasonable speeds (at least for my tastes, streaming Netflix, gaming etc.). The problem with Comcast is that if your location has a lot of users using a lot of bandwidth your speed will slow down due to you all sharing a line. An important advantage of AT&T depending on the area is that they can have a dedicated line so you would get a more consistent speed. Overall AT&T can't guarantee speeds as fast as Comcast though.  Take this with a grain of salt I am no expert in this. Anyone feel free to correct me."
jacksonville,2vfl1q,Fighteroftheniteman,2,Sun Feb 15 23:19:52 2015 UTC,"As far as streaming, I live with 2 other girls and we all have Netflix, etc. I got sucked into a roommate having DirectTV and I feel like I'm fucked. We got AT&T to take $10 off the cable, but now we're paying like $42-43 for AT&T internet and $99 for cable. $150/month for cable and internet (mind you, we only have 1 receiver/TV with cable & it's $10/mo. extra for any additional) is just giving away money - that I don't have.   Really just trying to figure out what other people have used and how it's working for them."
jacksonville,2vfl1q,brainfreeze91,1 point,Tue Feb 10 17:07:25 2015 UTC,"Yeah... I feel the pain, internet prices suck right now. I've got comcast with 50 Mbps internet and the basic cable package and I am paying $70 a month. I guess that is not so bad considering, but I don't get channels like AMC and Cartoon Network and stuff. I think the cheaper way to go if you can sacrifice it is to cut off cable as much as you think possible. It would be great if we could only pick the channels we wanted..."
jacksonville,2vfl1q,StainWaggin,2,Tue Feb 10 17:16:10 2015 UTC,"Is that with the promotion? I'm looking at that deal right now too but I don't care for TV. However if you just get the Internet, 25 Mb is 63 without tax and 50 Mb is 79 without tax . Crazy I'm not sure what to do"
jacksonville,2vfl1q,JinaSensei,2,Tue Feb 10 17:23:56 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I had some sort of promotion that actually made it cheaper to bundle basic cable with the 50 Mbps. I don't know if they are doing it anymore. You would need to talk to a Comcast rep to confirm, but you might be able to start with 25 and if you are feeling it is too slow upgrade to 50. This all depends on if your roommates want tv or not, which will be expensive either way.  If you're having trouble deciding, I would recommend going to one of their physical locations and talking to them. Despite the company's issues the employees themselves I found were helpful. It's better than being put on hold for an hour."

Our cable reception is bad to the point that half the things we DVR just get deleted - the video and audio is constantly out of sync, and we get digital artifacting constantly on certain channels. It's like watching your show as a jpeg flipbook someone printed in '98.  The internet is OK during certain times, but only when plugged in through ethernet - wireless just flatout does not work unless you reset the modem every couple of hours. Then it just gets slower and slower and slower until you reset it again.  DirectTV is what most of the people I know in town recommend, so if it's an option for you, take it. Our apartment is facing the wrong direction, so we can't get DirectTV. Obviously you can't get internet through them, but at least your TV will work."

I work from home, so I get up at 5:30 or 6:00am to get emails and work done before the connection dies at 8:30 every morning.  We've had a tech out here a few times, and the only answer we've gotten out of any of them is ""it's sometimes slow during peak times."" The way it was explained to us (which I don't know enough to disprove or support) was that the nature of the cable they use for internet means that the more people that are online at any given time, the less bandwidth each user gets. So, since we are in a building with a lot of other AT&T users, we have to 'share' the cable with them. So maybe it's not a problem in a single home?

jacksonville,2ur11v,flapyourwings,1 point,Wed Feb 4 17:04:09 2015 UTC,"Bell Boeing V-22 Osprey:       The Bell Boeing V-22 Osprey is an American multi-mission, military, tiltrotor aircraft with both a vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL), and short takeoff and landing (STOL) capability. It is designed to combine the functionality of a conventional helicopter with the long-range, high-speed cruise performance of a turboprop aircraft.  The V-22 originated from the United States Department of Defense Joint-service Vertical take-off/landing Experimental (JVX) aircraft program started in 1981. The team of Bell Helicopter and Boeing Helicopters was awarded a development contract in 1983 for the tiltrotor aircraft. The Bell Boeing team jointly produce the aircraft.  The V-22 first flew in 1989, and began flight testing and design alterations; the complexity and difficulties of being the first tiltrotor intended for military service in the world led to many years of development.  The United States Marine Corps began crew training for the Osprey in 2000, and fielded it in 2007; it supplemented and then replaced their Boeing Vertol CH-46 Sea Knights. The Osprey's other operator, the U.S. Air Force, fielded their version of the tiltrotor in 2009. Since entering service with the U.S. Marine Corps and Air Force, the Osprey has been deployed in both combat and rescue operations over Iraq, Afghanistan, Sudan and Libya.

If you don't have partial shade the florida sun can bake winter veggies even in Feb/March. So I would get leafy greens in the ground as soon as possible.  As far as what veggies, you really only have to be concerned about  the heat. You can supplement the soil with some good compost and fertilize well and grow whatever you want here not worrying about the sandy soil. But the heat kills off many things. All manner of green leafy veggies are rough to grow after March/April. Even hardier things like peppers need watering every day during peak summer. A partial shade garden would be best.

jacksonville,2uj4hl,condor85,1 point,Tue Feb 3 05:45:26 2015 UTC,i've never really had any problems with comcast.  their prices creep up though.  i started off paying ~60 bucks for bare bones cable and internet.  by the time i moved my bill was like 85 bucks.
jacksonville,2uj4hl,IamGrimReefer,1 point,Tue Feb 3 06:54:07 2015 UTC,I've had Comcast in Jax and it seemed priced a little high.  I've had AT&T/Uverse for the last 2 years and has worked well and seems to be about 20% cheaper. I don't use a great deal of broadband and my experience may be unique. just my 2 cents.
jacksonville,2uj4hl,Kaizen77,0,Tue Feb 3 20:39:08 2015 UTC,I got comcast for 50mbs and 10 channels for $60 a month.  Im usually get around 30mbs and low as 20 on high traffic times.

jacksonville,2ujde8,thetruepunk,3,Mon Feb 2 17:54:30 2015 UTC,"There is no place in Jax that you can drive or park on the sand on the ocean. In Mayport, heading towards the ferry, you can park on the jetties but I'm not sure how safe it is at night. The closest beach you can park on is in St Augustine. If you head south down a1a past Ponte Vedra there's a large parking area, but I don't know how visible the ocean is, ads as far as parking in jax, Neptune or Atlantic beaches I can't think of space that has prime viewing and even if there was beach cops will probably harass you after dark."
jacksonville,2ujde8,seamonkee,3,Mon Feb 2 18:02:10 2015 UTC,"Just about any cop I've ever encountered in Neptune Beach has been really professional. The one's in Atlantic Beach are pretty big douche-bags, as an example their former police chief just got indicted for trafficking drugs through the mail (while he was chief-of-police). Another one was arrested for having CP on his WORK laptop a few years ago.   I know a couple of Jax Beach cops, they have to deal with all the drunk drivers, fights, parties and crazy-as-fuck homeless people. So I feel like they get put out with that shit real quick."

jacksonville,2ujde8,seamonkee,1 point,Mon Feb 2 18:34:26 2015 UTC,Yeah I don't want to actually park on the beach beach. But atleast in a parking lot that you can just sit and look. Or maybe we will just find an area and park and walk on the beach and come back to the van and watch.
jacksonville,2ujde8,seamonkee,2,Mon Feb 2 18:15:44 2015 UTC,"I really really cannot encourage you to park and watch a movie. Some areas have issues with vagrants, other areas are too residential and others are patrolled constantly and you will most likely be asked to move if it's after dark. I don't think it'll be very romantic to have cops asking you what you're up to or keeping your eyes on the bums and general mischief makers."
jacksonville,2ujde8,Bear_Hopkins,2,Mon Feb 2 18:32:46 2015 UTC,"As far as sushi goes, there's a good place in Neptune Beach called Tama's. It's owned by a cool Japanese family.   For parking like you're talking about, I would try 4th Street, or 10th Street in Atlantic Beach (about a mile north of Tama's). Also you could try 16th Ave North and 8th Ave North in Jax Beach.   There's also some parking lots around the pier in Jax Beach. But there's lots of bums and shit around there, not very romantic."

jacksonville,2ujde8,904VietGuy,1 point,Mon Feb 2 18:24:27 2015 UTC,"This is the exact advice I came to give.

Not sure if that helps, but considering she'll have two adults there with her, I don't see why she'd have any issues.

I've been to Jack Rabbits several times and only once were the crowds obnoxiously moshing or pushing people around, and the artist I was seeing shut it down when he saw what was up. My musical tastes are tamer than most, though, so it's worth doing a bit of research.  They sell alcoholic and nonalcoholic drinks, have minimal seating, and have a serviceable but not great ladies room. I'd say go for it."

My band opened for less than jake there once, and they were at capacity, but I've been to plenty of shows where I was 1 of like, 6 people in there. Really depends on the act and what kind of crowd they'll draw.  The bathrooms are a wreck, but the sound is usually fantastic. Just make sure to bring ear plugs. They have a decent beer selection, if you're into that sort of thing and they no longer allow smoking inside.

It was easily the best shrimp scampi I've ever had and I would definitely get it again.  If I'm remembering properly, I believe my wife got the salmon and enjoyed it.

jacksonville,2tzmqz,DooWeeWoo,5,Wed Jan 28 18:41:52 2015 UTC,"You're going to have a hard time finding a realtor who will put much time and effort into helping you find a rental. It's commission based work and they would be better off spending their time working sales leads rather than helping you find a place to rent. However, if you are looking to rent for a while then find a place to buy, if you create a relationship with a realtor now and let them know you are planning on buying, then you might get better help. But, don't waste someone's time and say you're going to buy if it's not going to be true within the next couple years."

We did do a showing in person, which was a day after we had contacted them. A few of the other places we tried took days. One took over a week to attempt show us something.

jacksonville,2tmh86,CRizOFT,4,Sun Jan 25 16:36:11 2015 UTC,The big issue I was with the article was the mention of River City Brewing Company. That place is a reason to stay away from Jacksonville and shouldn't be referenced in an article praising the other fine establishments mentioned.
jacksonville,2tmh86,bhasden,1 point,Mon Jan 26 16:16:25 2015 UTC,"Hi - I'm the writer. I really enjoyed walking around downtown and Riverside this year, with the markets with creative local vendors, the good casual food, jogging the Riverwalk. And I met many good people, including a several folks who, upon seeing I was doing the the Elbow area clubs by myself into the night, asked me to join them. I'd visited in the past and while I enjoyed the gentrified Riverside 5 Points area, didn't find it worth writing about until the last recent days/nights I'd spent there (and definitely not with the tourism board). One of you mentioned River City Brewing Company - are you saying that's a bad place? I didn't drink their beer; I just jogged by when taking pictures a couple of hours on Southbank. It did seem touristy, but some happy folks leaving the place said they were locals."

Then, when I finished the degree at the top of my class, and scored a 98.8 out of 100 on their aptitude test (85 or above is considered well qualified and was the usual hiring range), they decided to allow anyone with 3 years full time work experience (in literally any job) or a Bachelor's to apply.

jacksonville,2tiwqx,Nolasmells,3,Sat Jan 24 16:58:39 2015 UTC,"Turn key to run position. Foot on brake shift from Park to low gear (1 or L) and then back to to Park. Try cranking. If that doesn't work you probably need a starter. When you try to crank the engine, does it make several clicking noises or one loud clunk for each time you engage the start position with the key? Trying to remote diagnose. Year make model would be helpful. Nonetheless it's probably a starter if you can't jump start it. Remember red to + and black to -"
jacksonville,2tiwqx,5cott,2,Sat Jan 24 20:46:50 2015 UTC,I actually did try all that when I was in the Walmart parking lot. The Car mechanic thinks it's the neutral safety switch. In this model they have to drop the transmission to replace.
jacksonville,2tiwqx,djob13,7,Sat Jan 24 23:39:38 2015 UTC,"This sounds like an issue with the battery. It's not hard to change it our for most cars, the battery is just a little heavy. Disconnect the red cable first, then the black cable using 10mm or 1/2 inch socket or wrench. Take the battery to any autozone or advanced auto. They'll test it for you and tell you if it's bad. If it is, get a new one and throw it back in there connecting the black cable first, then the red."
jacksonville,2tiwqx,carpespasm,3,Sat Jan 24 17:40:32 2015 UTC,Definitely not the battery. It's not the starter motor either. It might be something to with sensors the neutral free switch.

If you can test your battery and find its dead. Pick up a new battery and install yourself. It takes 10 minutes just need a socket wrench.   If you are not inclined to do it yourself. A simple battery change can be done at any local mechanic. A company like Sears will at least stand behind their work, but you will pay a fee. I'd expect anywhere from $100-200 dollars for a new battery and replacement.   Good luck!"
jacksonville,2tiwqx,PrintError,1 point,Sat Jan 24 18:02:57 2015 UTC,"A DC multimeter should read 12.7-13.5 volts for a good battery. Anything below 12V indicates depleted charge or a bad cell. There is also a little round sticker somewhere with a letter and a number, indicating the date the battery was made, for example F12 would be the 6th month (f being 6th letter of alphabet) and 12 being 2012. 3 years is the life to expect in most car batteries."

Intuition Brewery, Bold city brewery, Black Sheep restaurant is fantastic. A ton of good restaurants and Memorial park (really one of the nicer views of the river and city. On Saturdays we have Riverside Arts Market under the 95 bridge. It's a lot of fun (but in winter mode right now, so a bit smaller than normal.) Over in San Marco (across the river) Aardwolf brewery has some fantastic brews and there's a lot of neat boutique shops in San Marco square.   If you're adventurous, head out to the beach, I recommend Little Talbot Island, it's a hike out there (95 north to Hecksher drive and then a long trip out to A1A.) But it's my personal favorite beach. It's 2 bucks to get in (it's a state park) but worth it. But there's also Jacksonville Beach, which can be fun.  Depending on what day you're gonna be in town there's stuff to do. Check the events links in the sidebar. Don't listen to the negative nancys. There's lots to see and do!"

jacksonville,2t2t89,KettleMeetPot,5,Wed Jan 21 05:19:31 2015 UTC,"My 2 cents...move to the beaches area.  Why move to a city that has an ocean/beach and not take advantage of the lifestyle that offers? I work near your potential location and it is an easy commute from the beaches.  Cool vibe at the beach, plenty to do and beautiful, if your in for that sort of thing."

I've also lived in Tampa, Hawaii, Cali, Michigan, Alaska.  So unlike a lot of people who've never left Jacksonville, let alone Florida... Jacksonville isn't a premier destination.  If I go to the beach, I head up to Talbot or down to St. Augustine.  I won't go to Jax Beach for any reason unless one of my friends is having a special event, and I show up only to hang around them and 20 other people."

I've lived in Orlando and I have to say that Jax is quite different in my opinion. I don't have a reason to leave riverside too often but when I do, the drive is significant. Just be prepared to drive everywhere, public transport kinda sucks here."
jacksonville,2t2t89,Tolje,3,Tue Jan 20 19:44:16 2015 UTC,Check out the complexes on gate parkway. They're newer construction than the stuff off the access road on southside. Get a shorter lease to get a feel for the city and then decide what part of town you like the most and the kind of commute you're willing to tolerate.
jacksonville,2t2t89,martext,3,Wed Jan 21 03:53:38 2015 UTC,"just moved to jax in july, moved to south side, to an apt complex called evergreen club.  the glades is identical, but has pest issues.  very close to your job, and it is super quiet, we like it a lot.  they accept dogs, there is a pool, a mini gym, a volleyball net that no one uses, basketball stuff.  we moved from tallahassee, and don't party either.  we like it very much. the water in jax sucks by the way.  smells like farts."
jacksonville,2t2t89,prorook,2,Wed Jan 21 10:37:12 2015 UTC,Your job is very near a great place for ROI on rent. Check out the complexes on the Southside service road near Baymeadows or on Baymeadows Circle. A decently appointed one-bedroom will run you in the $500 area per month.

My upstairs neighbors were a couple who beat the shit out of each other regularly and the cops were there 1-2 times a month. The apartment complex changed hands 3 times in 18 months. The ""gym"" didn't have a single working machine in it the entire time. My apartment was broken into and robbed while I was out of town."

There's not much culture in the area, though. Strip malls, an outdoor mall, fast food joints...no hole in the wall anythings. Riverside or the beach can provide that, but its a tradeoff with the commute."
jacksonville,2t2t89,jack__worris,1 point,Tue Jan 20 21:23:11 2015 UTC,There's some nice places on Southside across the street from Tinseltown. There's also an apartment complex some friends lived in further down Southside across from the Avenues mall that seemed nice. I live in a house by Beach Blvd and Southside and it's nice and quiet. Only 8 miles from the ocean and near to a lot of things to do.

If you were going just to look at shotguns, I think it would have been a waste of your time.  At least, that was my opinion of it on the last day.

New guy kept me waiting for 10 minutes until I walked out.   Ended up using Lucas Honda because they had the most perfect car at my perfect price point. Guy was rude and wasted some of my time was negotiations were easy because I had outside financing.
jacksonville,2sowe9,birdablaze,2,Sat Jan 17 16:18:51 2015 UTC,"PSA: Get pre approved at your Credit Union. There is no reason in this day and age you should be at the dealership buying a car all day. Strut in with your pre approval, pick out a car in your price range, and drive away in it. If they pull the ""I have to speak to my manager "" bullshit, walk out."
jacksonville,2sowe9,ctnomom,1 point,Sun Jan 18 00:23:55 2015 UTC,Already got the pre approval from the CU. I dislike salesmen immensely and have a tendency to walk away when they talk too much. We'll see how that works out.

jacksonville,2sowe9,gojeffrey,8,Tue Jan 20 03:35:44 2015 UTC,A few years ago I got into a car accident with a transport driver from Duval while he was moving an F-150 between locations. The transport driver had no insurance or registration information on him so I (and the JSO officer who witnessed the accident) had to wait for a rep from the dealership to show up. The guy was a total dick to me and later actively interfered with me filling an insurance claim. Because of that one guy I refuse to shop in the Duval group and I recommend against them to all my friends.
jacksonville,2sowe9,therecameahero,1 point,Thu Jan 22 21:29:08 2015 UTC,I agree about the Duval group. Bought a Ford and a Honda and both were good experiences. Most recent was a few months ago for the Honda. The guys at Duval Honda were professional and courteous throughout the whole process.
jacksonville,2sowe9,legendz411,2,Sat Jan 17 03:33:17 2015 UTC,"I found that Carmax on Atlantic was pretty straightforward. They don't haggle prices, but my 2014 Kia Forte had less than 1500 miles and the price was better than all the other dealerships with Kia's or other brands with similiar specs. There was a minimal amount of upselling, once I made it clear what I was looking for they stuck with getting it for me. This is my first time buying from a dealership, so it went quite well from what I have heard, I will definitely go there again."

jacksonville,2sowe9,legendz411,1 point,Sat Jan 17 03:16:48 2015 UTC,"If at all possible, don't finance at the dealership unless they are giving 0%. Otherwise, you will almost always save money by financing directly with your credit union or bank."

If I ran into a jam they never threatened to come take my car, they worked with me about the payment. Of course that only happened a couple times over the 3 years of the loan.

Now on the avoid side: Keith Pierson Toyota (ignored, pressured) Jack Hanania dealers (Volkswagen OP, Acura OP, Hyundai OP, Subaru OP, Audi OP, etc.) have been pushy, rude, and don't seem to listen.

For nightlife, the Elbow in Downtown Jax has some pretty cool clubs that won't break your budget.

It is not rocket science. The city took millions from the pension and didn't pay into for years and now it is under funded. The city needs a dedicated funding source into the pension until it is properly funded, which means raising property taxes to appropriate levels for a city our size. The major even admits we need 40 million EXTRA a year to properly fund the pension, but refuses to say where the money will come from. He thinks it will magically appear. What will really happen is the city Council will be forced to raise taxes that way he can pretend he did nothing wrong."

Olive oil sucks because it cannot handle the high temps involved in deep frying. Coconut oil sucks because anything you deep fry in it tastes like coconuts. So unless it's used as either a saute oil or in a purpose made recipe (such as a curry or something) you will probably be hard pressed to find any restaurant on the face of the planet that would use either of those for the purpose for which you are asking."

My boyfriend got one of his tattoos worked on that another artist jacked up, and he did two sessions at a total of 3 hours and it only cost us about $80 total.

Both places are on the pricier side, but the drinks and atmosphere of both are worth it. I'd recommend you try them both out. They're only about a 6 minute walk from each other and the meters are free at night so you don't need to worry about leaving your car.  Pro-tip Dos Gatos is kinda hard to find as they don't really have signage... just know it's directly across the street from the Florida Theater.

I really can't tell from that picture she enclosed, but a dog with that body/fur type would almost without a doubt display a road rash. I used to do animal rescue. I've seen some bad ones.  Two, if she was mentally competent, you would be able to tell from the dog that it was previously well taken care of. (Look at the teeth, coat, overall attitude) I mean, a strange dog wouldn't just play with a stranger in their yard off the bat unless the dog had previous trust with humans.  There's a potential this person is just messed up. There are some sick people out there. Or she could be trying to get reward money out of this.

jacksonville,2saeai,PrintError,4,Tue Jan 13 16:38:54 2015 UTC,"I guess a lot of it depends on what you're looking for.  Jacksonville is very large and suburban, which can be either a pro or a con depending on who you are (or both!).  It's very Bible Belt-y, which again, could go either way for you.  There's not much of an urban core but there are plenty of pockets of exciting place around town.  What sort of place are you looking for?  What drew your attention to Jacksonville and what is it about southern Indiana that makes you want to leave?"
jacksonville,2saeai,Breakfast_King,8,Tue Jan 13 15:55:31 2015 UTC,"The main reason is the weather. Our winters can be as cold as Chicago and our summer are just as hot and humid as they are in Florida. I would love to be able to enjoy the outdoors during the winter months.   Second, there aren't a lot of job opportunities where we live. I am in the banking industry and there seem to be a decent number of banking related jobs in Jacksonville. Fiancée is in the medical field and should be able to find a job fairly easily.   Suburban sprawl isn't too big of a deal. I'm not really religious but, living in southern Indiana, I am used to being around it. About to start a family in the next few years so family friendly is important."
jacksonville,2saeai,Whittigo,1 point,Tue Jan 13 17:01:11 2015 UTC,"Medical treatment or billing/coding. Some huge health care call centers here. Lots of banking as you said.   Because I have nothing better to do I decided to look at historical weather records, I picked bloomington indiana, hopefully good enough, and compared it to jacksonville for june-august. 10-15 degrees warmer average temperatures and more rainfall in Jax. Humidity wasn't recorded but I can only assume it's higher. A lot of people think they know the heat and humidity Florida has to offer until they live here. Just a heads up, if you like walking through soup, you'll like Florida.   The warmer winter should be nice though, those average temps for december and january are low, compared to 40-50s for jax."
jacksonville,2saeai,Breakfast_King,2,Tue Jan 13 17:47:27 2015 UTC,"Actually I am near Evansville in the southwest corner. I am prepared to deal with the increased humidity. Being in the Ohio river valley, it isn't something that is completely foreign to me."
jacksonville,2saeai,bhasden,1 point,Tue Jan 13 18:22:01 2015 UTC,"Ah okay.  Yeah, seems like Jacksonville could be a really good fit for you.  It's always tough packing up and moving to a completely new city, but there are certainly lots of banking/medical jobs to be found here.  The tricky part now is finding out what side of town to move to :P"
jacksonville,2saeai,Relax_Redditors,3,Tue Jan 13 18:31:23 2015 UTC,We plan on renting for a year to get a good feel for where we want to live. Then we plan to buy a house. At the moment we are thinking Southside.
jacksonville,2saeai,submissivelittlewolf,2,Tue Jan 13 19:14:08 2015 UTC,The Southside is a good place to start. I lived there for a few years when I first moved to Jacksonville in my early 20s and it allowed me to figure out where I wanted to purchase a house and where I wanted to stay away from. Good luck.
jacksonville,2saeai,FapFlop,2,Wed Jan 14 16:46:36 2015 UTC,The Riverside and San Marco areas are pretty close to downtown and can give that feeling.

jacksonville,2saeai,youarecaught,1 point,Wed Jan 14 00:51:51 2015 UTC,"Just moved here. Love it. We live about 7 minutes from the beach and 7 minutes from a nice shopping area. The weather is awesome, it's a big city but it's split into so many suburbs that you would never know. Traffic isn't horrible, everyone I've talked to or encountered are really nice. The beaches are not the powdery white sand you would find in Panama city/ destin but beck its a beautiful beach. If you have kids I would recommend chets creek area. Awesome schools. It's a great place to live."
jacksonville,2saeai,SmilingAnus,-8,Thu Jan 15 02:47:33 2015 UTC,"More than likely you won't like it. Most people I've talked to hate it here. I've got over 3 decades of Jacksonville experience.   Traffic. It sucks. Jacksonville is one of the few places you can drive straight for 2 hours and still be in Jacksonville.   Unlike many cities, there are no ""good""  sides. You will always be within range of a ghetto. Don't believe me? Look up Florida murder rate and find Jacksonville #1.  Jacksonville is ranked #49 in Florida for education. Right next door in Saint john's County, they're #1.  Younger less mature people will tell you to move to Riverside, San Marco, beaches, or the town center. Riverside and San Marco are very fun places with lots of bars and hippies but that crowd is what you live around and the homes are old and in bad shape. Beaches are either dangerous, crowded, expensive, or any combination of the 3 depending on where you live. The town center is next to UNF and is a popular, albeit overcrowded, shopping destination where you will pay $1,500-3000/mo for rent.   Other than drink and go to the beach, there's not too much to do here but most your time will be spent driving so... I imagine reddit minded people would like Riverside. I imagine a bit matured minded person would look for a subdivision without HUD housing near i10.  Better option, Saint Augustine. The county is much better, the pay is better, the people are more adult, and all around a more subtle place to enjoy."
jacksonville,2saeai,youarecaught,9,Tue Jan 13 17:14:53 2015 UTC,"Having lived in various areas around the country, metropolitan and otherwise, I feel qualified to address some of your concerns.   -Jacksonville traffic is not bad at all. There is always a number of alternate routes if an accident backs up one thoroughfare. Rush hour can be slow sometimes but not as slow as many other places I have lived.   -The murders in Jacksonville are generally concentrated in a few high crime areas. The rest of the city, although not perfect, is not bad. I personally live in Arlington. Many people count that as a ""bad neighborhood"" however I have never been the victim of a crime while living there. As far as I know none of my neighbors have either (except for a little domestic violence that I called JSO on but that happens in every area.)  -Duval county education has some work to do. There are some good schools and some not so good schools. Duval county is currently ranked 58 of 68 Florida counties.   -Where to live is a personal choice. I know a number of 40+ people who live in the Riverside area and love it. Yes the homes are older but the ones I have seen are not in bad shape. I am sure there are some that have not been taken care of but I think the majority are fine.   -There is much to do in and around Jacksonville, if you actually try getting out of your house and doing it. I enjoy kayaking the various fresh/brackish waterways around Jacksonville. We have a number of fantastic museums. Local artists are featured monthly in the downtown artwalk. I could go on and on listing things to do in Jacksonville besides go to the beach and or drink.   -I don't understand why you stay here if you hate this area so much. Surely there are jobs elsewhere in the country that you would find more appealing."
jacksonville,2saeai,Blutroyale-_-,-6,Tue Jan 13 18:32:27 2015 UTC,"In my line of work, Arlington was the most entertaining. I saw the most drugs and police chases, cars crashing through gas stations, police stings where they wear skim asks and jump out of tahoes, etc... The fact that you say Arlington is good, negates everything else."
jacksonville,2saeai,sifractusfortis,7,Tue Jan 13 18:41:06 2015 UTC,But you hate everything about Jacksonville anyway so one example is irrelevant. I still don't understand why you have stayed here for 30+ years if you hate it so much.
jacksonville,2saeai,SmilingAnus,2,Tue Jan 13 19:18:01 2015 UTC,"i moved here from LA, if you like that shit, you should move to LA there's plenty more of it happening there i promise you :D"
jacksonville,2saeai,jack__worris,8,Tue Jan 13 20:08:11 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't take too seriously the opinion of a user with the name ""smilinganus"" and a condescending, negative attitude bashing on the city and deciding entire areas aren't ""adult"". Here's my view.  -Traffic is hit or miss. You'll be happier living somewhat close to where you work. You'll definitely need a car. Jacksonville is too big and the public transportation too ineffective to get around without one.  -Almost all murders are either domestic violence or drug-related. There are very few that are random victims.  -The schools are of varying quality depending on the area of town. Three of the nation's best public high schools are in Duval County (Stanton, Paxon, and Douglas Anderson).  -The homes in Riverside/Avondale and San Marco are old, but most are well maintained. It's a historic district and a beautiful area. The property value per square foot is the highest in the city. A diverse and friendly neighborhood with people of all ages and income levels. Very little crime, tons of public parks, and plenty to do. You can look on coj.net for crime statistics of different areas of town.  -St. Augustine and St. Johns county are nice, but there aren't as many jobs there. If you're in the banking industry, Jacksonville holds much more opportunity for you.  -Jacksonville has plenty to do. There's the river, the beaches, more public parks than any other city in the US, fishing, boating, kayaking, swimming, tennis, running, cycling, soccer, baseball, golf, concerts, lectures, museums, a minor league baseball team, an NFL team, an arena football team, soon to be a professional soccer team, great restaurants and bars, local breweries, professional organizations, libraries, One Spark, TPC, and much more. This is a great city and it's getting better. There's been a lot of revitalization of downtown and the urban core, we're attracting more businesses, the port is expanding, and the religious nuts are slowly losing their stranglehold on local politics."

jacksonville,2saeai,RevLoki,-2,Tue Jan 13 20:10:25 2015 UTC,"Should we dismiss Detroit for its crime because it's all gang related?   Have you been to any of those schools? They're all within walking distance of a crack house and they're all magnet schools. I went to paxon, got jumped everytime the black kids declared it cracker day.   Hud housing is growing and currently the city (last I heard) are requiring all new developments reserve their first sales to Hud.   Down vote all you want, I'm not blind to what happens in Jacksonville and I'll be damned if I withhold the truths in order to make it prettier if someone is going to pack up their life to move here.   Of all the down voted, how many of you are educated and have been here 30-40 years? Long enough to see great areas go down the drain? Hell, someone please tell him/her that our highways have been under construction for less than 10 years straight... Truthfully."

A company driven by the pockets of upper management with total disregard for the working man/woman.

jacksonville,2s4ne4,Darth_Corleone,5,Mon Jan 12 03:40:20 2015 UTC,"This is the Aluminum Overcast, and we flew it from Cecil Field around downtown Jacksonville, then back to Cecil Field on Saturday morning. Check out their website at www.b17.org to learn more about this piece of living, flying WW2 history!"
jacksonville,2s4ne4,NoAbbreviation,2,Mon Jan 12 03:41:49 2015 UTC,So cool!  Thanks for sharing.
jacksonville,2s4ne4,TeacherofCivics,2,Tue Jan 13 00:23:47 2015 UTC,Amazing.  My husband and I went out to see it but the price to fly was well out of our range. I will be sharing this post with him. Last year I sent him out on the Ford Tri - motor when it was at Craig. He was so excited he forgot to take his phone up with him.
jacksonville,2s4ne4,TeacherofCivics,1 point,Tue Jan 13 00:54:42 2015 UTC,I wouldn't have been able to go either if not for an amazing gift. Hope he enjoys the pics!
jacksonville,2s4ne4,sig04,2,Tue Jan 13 01:04:46 2015 UTC,OMG ..we're in the top photo! He's got his back to you and I'm taking a picture.  Si cool!!!
jacksonville,2s4ne4,KabyBittens,1 point,Tue Jan 13 01:08:48 2015 UTC,Jacksonville is a tiny little town spread out over 3 counties. :)
jacksonville,2s4ne4,KabyBittens,1 point,Tue Jan 13 14:13:13 2015 UTC,"I really wanted to attend, but had to be out of town for work. I was hopeful someone would post this on reddit. Thank you, OP."
jacksonville,2s4utm,jimcutlers_buttspeed,3,Mon Jan 12 04:53:16 2015 UTC,It wasn't the usual Sunday Maxwell House roasting smell drifting over when the wind is right?
jacksonville,2s4utm,ChipCharge,2,Mon Jan 12 13:22:14 2015 UTC,"Being an urban core neighborhood, we get drift from everywhere. If it isn't the normal coffee smell, it could be just general funk from off the river. or when it's damp like it was last night, all of the oak trees just smell weird.   I get it too when I leave town and come back. Every city has its own smell, it's particularly prominent when I come back from NYC or some other big city. Jacksonville smells like pine trees when you get off of the plane."
jacksonville,2s4utm,RevLoki,1 point,Mon Jan 12 13:46:48 2015 UTC,"I'm around that area every weekend and I haven't noticed it, no. Maybe it was just that day, but I hadn't smelled it on Saturday night when I was there."
jacksonville,2s4utm,ScottMiller,1 point,Mon Jan 12 12:22:36 2015 UTC,Yes. Smells like shit. I think it might be when the wind blows over the river the right way
jacksonville,2s3b9v,Nolasmells,7,Sun Jan 11 20:42:22 2015 UTC,Welcome.  If you're a drinker I recommend riverside to meet new people. King st or 5 points or even the breweries. Locals are quite friendly and chill on weekdays and weekends are packed with people from all over town.
jacksonville,2s3b9v,ChiTownDisplaced,5,Sun Jan 11 21:59:57 2015 UTC,Yes I am! I checked out Intuition this Saturday. I'm not sure what constitutes Riverside. I randomly found this place called The Landing during my wanderings but apparently intuition is Riverside?
jacksonville,2s3b9v,kishpa,7,Sun Jan 11 22:20:30 2015 UTC,"The Landing is a in a terrible state, but well suited for concerts. Kayaking is great here, with a couple of places to rent.   Depending on your age, try our Rotaract, Jaycees, or Impact Jax to meet people."
jacksonville,2s3b9v,kishpa,2,Sun Jan 11 22:48:42 2015 UTC,I'm 28. Which one is for me?
jacksonville,2s3b9v,MrVaper,1 point,Sun Jan 11 23:00:16 2015 UTC,"Any would work then. I'm in Rotaract and enjoy it, but would recommend you at least check out the others. I'll PM you the URL once I get home."
jacksonville,2s3b9v,peanutbuttershudder,1 point,Sun Jan 11 23:10:56 2015 UTC,Thanks I appreciate it!
jacksonville,2s3b9v,Fragilefish,2,Mon Jan 12 00:13:20 2015 UTC,The landing is the place in the lion king that doesn't touch the light...
jacksonville,2s3b9v,umdraco,1 point,Mon Jan 12 01:24:31 2015 UTC,Hahahah is that so? Thanks for tellin me. The mall there looked desolate. But the view of the bridges was beautiful.
jacksonville,2s3b9v,serial___killer,1 point,Mon Jan 12 01:49:36 2015 UTC,"I'm hurt /u/kishpa didn't mention another awesome young professionals group called ""The Magellan Society"" from the World Affairs Council. Check it out and PM me if you have any questions :) there's a nice, casual (and free) social coming up on the 20th."
jacksonville,2s3b9v,Captain_Turd_Dildo,1 point,Sun Jan 11 22:59:38 2015 UTC,Very nice! I hadn't considered joining a group sort of a kickball team. Good idea!
jacksonville,2s3b9v,carpespasm,1 point,Sun Jan 11 23:01:01 2015 UTC,"Just make sure to fold in your side view mirrors if you can, or park far away from the fun and walk. Used to sit on my buddy's porch just behind that crossroad with the gas station and the hot dog lady and listen to the mirrors get crunched off of parked cars. And the drunk fights, haha! I miss Friday nights."
jacksonville,2s3b9v,ChiTownDisplaced,5,Mon Jan 12 00:26:28 2015 UTC,"Im throwing a small party for my 33rd birthday this weekend, everyone there will be mid post college 20s to mid 30s. There will be a lot of people with differing interests, im sure you will find someone you get along with. Hit me up in a message if you are interested, I am looking foward to paying it forward like some someone did when I first moved here. The Party will be on Saturday 17th at 9ish."
jacksonville,2s3b9v,lurkinallday23,10,Mon Jan 12 18:08:06 2015 UTC,Just post the details here so we can all come. What could possibly go wrong?
jacksonville,2s3b9v,hailXenu,3,Mon Jan 12 02:15:31 2015 UTC,"You can trust this guy, he knows what he's talking about."
jacksonville,2s3b9v,hailXenu,1 point,Mon Jan 12 06:27:38 2015 UTC,Ah I'm so sorry I have to go out of town this weekend. Can I write a rain check?
jacksonville,2s3b9v,GarmaZed,4,Mon Jan 12 09:23:36 2015 UTC,Here's a tongue-in-cheek map of town to get you started. Where are you coming from? http://i.imgur.com/2pIq9Sz.png
jacksonville,2s3b9v,omg_IAMA_girl,1 point,Mon Jan 12 17:10:30 2015 UTC,"Ha. ""International"" Airport."
jacksonville,2s3b9v,superpj,1 point,Mon Jan 12 08:00:26 2015 UTC,Very accurate map.
